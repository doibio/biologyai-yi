antihyperglycemic, hepatoprotective, expectorant, and diuretic effects. A 
proprietary extract of the dried root of Astragalus membranaceus, called TA-65, 
was associated with a significant age-reversal effect in the immune system. Our 
review focuses on the function and the underlying mechanisms of Astragalus 
membranaceus in lifespan extension, anti-vascular aging, anti-brain aging, and 
anti-cancer effects, based on experimental and clinical studies.

The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) invited 
AstraZeneca, the manufacturer of ticagrelor (Brilique®), to submit evidence on 
the clinical and cost effectiveness of ticagrelor 60 mg twice daily (BID) in 
combination with low-dose aspirin [acetylsalicylic acid (ASA)] compared with ASA 
only for secondary prevention of atherothrombotic events in patients with a 
history of myocardial infarction (MI) and who are at increased risk of 
atherothrombotic events. Kleijnen Systematic Reviews Ltd (KSR), in collaboration 
with Maastricht University Medical Centre+, was commissioned as the evidence 
review group (ERG). This paper summarises the company submission (CS), the ERG 
report and the NICE guidance produced by the appraisal committee (AC) for the 
use of ticagrelor in England and Wales. The ERG critically reviewed the 
clinical- and cost-effectiveness evidence in the CS. The systematic review 
conducted as part of the CS identified one randomised controlled trial (RCT), 
PEGASUS-TIMI 54. This trial reported the time to first occurrence of any event 
from the composite of cardiovascular death, MI and stroke as the primary outcome 
(hazard ratio 0.84 ticagrelor 60 mg BID vs. placebo, 95% confidence interval 
0.74-0.95). The population addressed in the CS was a subgroup of the 
PEGASUS-TIMI 54 trial population, i.e. the 'base-case' population, which 
comprised patients who had experienced an MI between 1 and 2 years ago, whereas 
the full trial population included patients who had experienced an MI between 1 
and 3 years ago. While the ERG believed the findings of this RCT to be robust, 
doubts concerning the applicability of the trial to UK patients were raised. The 
company submitted an individual patient simulation model to estimate the 
cost-effectiveness of ticagrelor 60 mg BID + ASA versus ASA only. Parametric 
time-to-event models were used to estimate the time to first and subsequent 
(cardiovascular) events, time to treatment discontinuation and time to adverse 
events. The company's base-case analysis resulted in an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of £20,098 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) 
gained. The main issues surrounding the cost effectiveness of ticagrelor 60 mg 
BID + ASA were the use of parametric time-to-event models estimated based on the 
full trial population instead of being fitted to the 'label' population (the 
'label' population comprised the 'base-case' population and patients who started 
ticagrelor 60 mg BID within 1 year of previous adenosine diphosphate inhibitor 
treatment), the incorrect implementation of the probabilistic sensitivity 
analysis (PSA) of the individual patient simulation, and simplifications of the 
model structure that may have biased the health benefits and costs estimations 
of the intervention and comparator. The ERG believed the use of the full trial 
population to inform the parametric time-to-event models was not appropriate 
because the 'label' population was the main focus of the scope and CS. The ERG 
could not investigate the magnitude of the bias introduced by this assumption. 
The PSA of the individual patient simulation provided unreliable probabilistic 
results and underestimated the uncertainty surrounding the results because it 
was based on a single patient. The ERG used the cohort simulation presented in 
the cost-effectiveness model to perform its base-case and additional analyses 
and to obtain probabilistic results. The ERG amended the company 
cost-effectiveness model, which resulted in an ERG base-case ICER of £24,711 per 
QALY gained. In its final guidance, the AC recommended treatment with ticagrelor 
60 mg BID + low-dose ASA for secondary prevention of atherothrombotic events in 
adults who have had an MI and are at increased risk of atherothrombotic events.

Screening for asymptomatic peripheral artery disease (aPAD) with the 
ankle-brachial index (ABI) test is hypothesized to reduce disease progression 
and cardiovascular (CV) events by identifying individuals who may benefit from 
early initiation of medical therapy. Using a Markov model, we evaluated the cost 
effectiveness of initiating medical therapy (e.g. statin and ACE-inhibitor) 
after a positive ankle-brachial index (ABI) screen in 65-year-old patients. We 
modeled progression to symptomatic PAD (sPAD) and CV events with and without ABI 
screening, evaluating differences in costs and quality-adjusted life years 
(QALYs). The cost of the ABI test, physician visit, new medication, CV events, 
and interventions for sPAD were incorporated in the model. We performed 
sensitivity analysis on model variables with uncertainty. Our model found an 
incremental cost of US $338 and an incremental QALY of 0.00380 with one-time ABI 
screening, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of 
$88,758/QALY over a 35-year period. The variables with the largest effects in 
the ICER were aPAD disease prevalence, cost of monthly medication after a 
positive screen and 2-year medication adherence rates. Screening high-risk 
populations, such as tobacco users, where the prevalence of PAD may be 2.5 times 
higher, decreases the ICER to $24,092/QALY. Our analysis indicates the cost 
effectiveness of one-time screening for aPAD depends on prevalence, medication 
costs, and adherence to therapies for CV disease risk reduction. Screening in 
higher-risk populations under favorable assumptions about medication adherence 
results in the most favorable cost effectiveness, but limitations in the primary 
data preclude definitive assessment of cost effectiveness.

Health, Rennes, France.

OBJECTIVES: To examine health benefits and cost-effectiveness of implementing a 
freeway deck park to increase urban green space.
METHODS: Using the Cross-Bronx Expressway in New York City as a case study, we 
explored the cost-effectiveness of implementing deck parks. We built a 
microsimulation model that included increased exercise, fewer accidents, and 
less pollution as well as the cost of implementation and maintenance of the 
park. We estimated both the quality-adjusted life years gained and the societal 
costs for 2017.
RESULTS: Implementation of a deck park over sunken parts of Cross-Bronx 
Expressway appeared to save both lives and money. Savings were realized for 84% 
of Monte Carlo simulations.
CONCLUSIONS: In a rapidly urbanizing world, reclaiming green space through deck 
parks can bring health benefits alongside economic savings over the long term. 
Public Health Implications. Policymakers are seeking ways to create 
cross-sectorial synergies that might improve both quality of urban life and 
health. However, such projects are very expensive, and there is little 
information on their return of investment. Our analysis showed that deck parks 
produce exceptional value when implemented over below-grade sections of road.

Quantitative characterisation of upper limb motion allows the evaluation of the 
effect of pathology on functional task performance, potentially directing 
rehabilitation strategies. Movement patterns of the distal upper limb in healthy 
adults during functional tasks have not been extensively characterised. During 
five loaded functional tasks (drinking from a glass, pouring from a kettle, 
turning a handle, lifting a bag to a shelf, turning a key) the movement patterns 
were characterised using three-dimensional motion analysis with a minimal marker 
set in 16 healthy adults (10 M,6F, 27 (IQR:25-43)years). Joint angles reported 
include flexion/extension at the elbow and wrist, forearm supination/pronation 
and digits 2-5 metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint flexion/extension. Additionally 
for the thumb the angle between the metacarpal of the thumb and the 2nd digit 
(Thumb base), the thumb MCP (Thumb MCP) and interphalangeal (Thumb IP) joint 
angles are presented. Durations of activities performed at self-selected 
comfortable speeds (3.36 (IQR:3.07,3.66)s turning a key to 6.20 (IQR:5.44,6.38)s 
drinking from a glass) are reported. The maximum joint angles used (median of 
participants' maxima) were 141° of elbow flexion, 116° forearm supination, 36° 
wrist extension, 56° Thumb base, 14° Thumb MCP flexion, 18° Thumb IP flexion, 
85° MCP2-5 flexion. The tasks of drinking from a glass, lifting a bag to a shelf 
and turning a key appeared to have the least variation in performance, 
suggesting that these activities are better suited to be selected as 
standardized tasks for assessing the impact of pathology on movement than 
pouring from a kettle and turning a handle.

BACKGROUND: Although older adults with predialysis chronic kidney disease are at 
higher risk for falls, the prognostic significance of a serious fall injury 
prior to dialysis initiation has not been well described in the end-stage renal 
disease population.
METHODS: We examined the association between a serious fall injury in the year 
prior to starting hemodialysis and adverse health outcomes in the year following 
dialysis initiation using a retrospective cohort study of U.S. Medicare 
beneficiaries ≥ 67 years old who initiated dialysis in 2010-2012. Serious fall 
injuries were defined using diagnostic codes for falls plus an injury (fracture, 
joint dislocation, or head injury). Health outcomes, defined as time-to-event 
variables within the first year of dialysis, included four outcomes: a 
subsequent serious fall injury, hospital admission, post-acute skilled nursing 
facility (SNF) utilization, and mortality.
RESULTS: Among this cohort of 81,653 initiating hemodialysis, 2,958 (3.6%) 
patients had a serious fall injury in the year prior to hemodialysis initiation. 
In the first year of dialysis, 7.6% had a subsequent serious fall injury, 67.6% 
a hospitalization, 30.7% a SNF claim, and 26.1% died. Those with versus without 
a serious fall injury in the year prior to hemodialysis initiation were at 
higher risk (hazard ratio, 95% confidence interval) for a subsequent serious 
fall injury (2.65, 2.41-2.91), hospitalization (1.11, 1.06-1.16), SNF claim 
(1.40, 1.30-1.50), and death (1.14, 1.06-1.22).
CONCLUSIONS: For older adults initiating dialysis, a history of a serious fall 
injury may provide prognostic information to support decision making and 
establish expectations for life after dialysis initiation.

BACKGROUND: Preventive chemotherapy (PC), the large-scale administration of 
anthelminthics, is recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) for the 
control of soil-transmitted helminthiasis (STH). Since 2010, donated 
anthelminthics for STH have boosted the implementation of PC programmes in 
children, achieving global coverage of more than 60% in 2015. The WHO Global 
Health Estimates attribute an annual loss of over 3.3 million 
disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) to STH. The aim of this study is to 
estimate the impact of PC programmes on child morbidity.
METHOD: We used data from the WHO Global Health Estimates, national coverage 
data on PC and the results of an evaluation of the impact of PC in 17 countries 
on morbidity previously conducted by our group.
RESULTS: We estimated that the implementation of PC averted in 2015 over 44% of 
the DALYs that would have been caused in children by STH without the control 
intervention. A reduction in morbidity of over 75% is expected, if the global 
target is reached in 2020. If the programme is subsequently maintained, 
morbidity from STH will be almost totally removed by 2025.
CONCLUSIONS: In endemic areas, preventive chemotherapy provides a significant 
health benefit. We consider this estimation potentially useful to evaluate the 
cost utility of the investment made by several endemic countries on PC to 
control STH.

BACKGROUND: A rapidly ageing population presents major challenges to health and 
social care services. Cross-country comparative studies on survival among older 
adults are limited. In addition, Japan, the country with the longest life 
expectancy, is rarely included in these cross-country comparisons.
OBJECTIVE: We examined the relative contributions of social and behavioural 
factors on the differences in survival among older people in Japan and England.
METHODS: We used data from the Japan Gerontological Evaluation Study (JAGES; n = 
13,176) and the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA; n = 5,551) to 
analyse all-cause mortality up to 9.4 years from the baseline. Applying Laplace 
regression models, the 15th survival percentile difference was estimated.
RESULTS: During the follow-up, 31.3% of women and 38.6% of men in the ELSA died, 
whereas 19.3% of women and 31.3% of men in the JAGES died. After adjusting for 
age and baseline health status, JAGES participants had longer survival than ELSA 
participants by 318.8 days for women and by 131.6 days for men. Family-based 
social relationships contributed to 105.4 days longer survival in JAGES than 
ELSA men. Fewer friendship-based social relationships shortened the JAGES men's 
survival by 45.4 days compared to ELSA men. Currently not being a smoker 
contributed to longer survival for JAGES women (197.7 days) and ELSA men (46.6 
days), and having lower BMI reduced the survival of JAGES participants by 129.0 
days for women and by 212.2 days for men.
CONCLUSION: Compared to participants in England, Japanese older people lived 
longer mainly because of non-smoking for women and family-based social 
relationships for men. In contrast, a lower rate of underweight, men's better 
friendship-based social relationships, and a lower smoking rate contributed to 
survival among participants in England.

INTRODUCTION: There is a growing need for economic evaluations describing the 
disease course, as well as the costs and clinical outcomes related to the 
treatment of schizophrenia.
AREAS COVERED: A systematic review on studies describing health economic models 
in schizophrenia and a targeted literature review on utility mapping algorithms 
in schizophrenia were carried out. Models found in the review were collated and 
assessed in detail according to their type and various other attributes. 
Fifty-nine studies were included in the review. Modeling techniques varied from 
simple decision trees to complex simulation models. The models used various 
clinical endpoints as value drivers, 47% of the models used quality-adjusted 
life years, and eight percent used disability-adjusted life years to measure 
benefits, while others applied various clinical outcomes. Most models considered 
patients switching between therapies, and therapeutic adherence, compliance or 
persistence. The targeted literature review identified four main approaches to 
map PANSS scores to utility values.
EXPERT COMMENTARY: Health economic models developed for schizophrenia showed 
great variability, with simulation models becoming more frequently used in the 
last decade. Using PANSS scores as the basis of utility estimations is 
justifiable.

BACKGROUND: There is ongoing debate about the harms and benefits of a national 
prostate cancer screening programme. Several model-based cost-effectiveness 
analyses have been developed to determine whether the benefits of prostate 
cancer screening outweigh the costs and harms caused by over-detection and 
over-treatment, and the different approaches may impact results.
METHODS: To identify models of prostate cancer used to assess the 
cost-effectiveness of prostate cancer screening strategies, a systematic review 
of articles published since 2006 was conducted using the NHS Economic Evaluation 
Database, Medline, EMBASE and HTA databases. The NICE website, UK National 
Screening website, reference lists from relevant studies were also searched and 
experts contacted. Key model features, inputs, and cost-effectiveness 
recommendations were extracted.
RESULTS: Ten studies were included. Four of the studies identified some 
screening strategies to be potentially cost-effective at a PSA threshold of 
3.0 ng/ml, including single screen at 55 years, annual or two yearly screens 
starting at 55 years old, and delayed radical treatment. Prostate cancer 
screening was modelled using both individual and cohort level models. Model 
pathways to reflect cancer progression varied widely, Gleason grade was not 
always considered and clinical verification was rarely outlined. Where quality 
of life was considered, the methods used did not follow recommended practice and 
key issues of overdiagnosis and overtreatment were not addressed by all studies.
CONCLUSION: The cost-effectiveness of prostate cancer screening is unclear. 
There was no consensus on the optimal model type or approach to model prostate 
cancer progression. Due to limited data availability, individual patient-level 
modelling is unlikely to increase the accuracy of cost-effectiveness results 
compared with cohort-level modelling, but is more suitable when assessing 
adaptive screening strategies. Modelling prostate cancer is challenging and the 
justification for the data used and the approach to modelling natural disease 
progression was lacking. Country-specific data are required and recommended 
methods used to incorporate quality of life. Influence of data inputs on 
cost-effectiveness results need to be comprehensively assessed and the model 
structure and assumptions verified by clinical experts.

Glioblastoma remains the most common, malignant primary cancer of the central 
nervous system with a low life expectancy and an overall survival of less than 
1.5 years. The treatment options are limited and there is no cure. Moreover, 
almost all patients develop recurrent tumors, which typically are more 
aggressive. Therapeutically resistant glioblastoma or glioblastoma stem-like 
cells (GSCs) are hypothesized to cause this inevitable recurrence. Identifying 
prognostic biomarkers of glioblastoma will potentially advance knowledge about 
glioblastoma tumorigenesis and enable discovery of more effective therapies. 
Proteomic analysis of more than 600 glioblastoma-specific proteins revealed, for 
the first time, that expression of acid ceramidase (ASAH1) is associated with 
poor glioblastoma survival. CD133+ GSCs express significantly higher ASAH1 
compared to CD133- GSCs and serum-cultured glioblastoma cell lines, such as 
U87MG. These findings implicate ASAH1 as a plausible independent prognostic 
marker, providing a target for a therapy tailored toward GSCs. We further 
demonstrate that ASAH1 inhibition increases cellular ceramide level and induces 
apoptosis. Strikingly, U87MG cells, and three different patient-derived 
glioblastoma stem-like cancer cell lines were efficiently killed, through 
apoptosis, by three different known ASAH1 inhibitors with IC50's ranging from 
11-104 μM. In comparison, the standard glioblastoma chemotherapy agent, 
temozolomide, had minimal GSC-targeted effects at comparable or even higher 
concentrations (IC50 > 750 μM against GSCs). ASAH1 is identified as a de novo 
glioblastoma drug target, and ASAH1 inhibitors, such as carmofur, are shown to 
be highly effective and to specifically target glioblastoma GSCs. Carmofur is an 
ASAH1 inhibitor that crosses the blood-brain barrier, a major bottleneck in 
glioblastoma treatment. It has been approved in Japan since 1981 for colorectal 
cancer therapy. Therefore, it is poised for repurposing and translation to 
glioblastoma clinical trials.

Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most aggressive primary brain tumor with 
poor survival. Cytoreduction in association with radiotherapy and temozolomide 
(TMZ) is the standard therapy, but response is heterogeneous and life expectancy 
is limited. The combined use of chemotherapeutic agents with drugs targeting 
cell metabolism is becoming an interesting therapeutic option for cancer 
treatment. Here, we found that metformin (MET) enhances TMZ effect on 
TMZ-sensitive cell line (U251) and overcomes TMZ-resistance in T98G GBM cell 
line. In particular, combined-treatment modulated apoptosis by increasing 
Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, and reduced Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) production. We also 
observed that MET associated with TMZ was able to reduce the expression of 
glioma stem cells (GSC) marker CD90 particularly in T98G cells but not that of 
CD133. In vivo experiments showed that combined treatment with TMZ and MET 
significantly slowed down growth of TMZ-resistant tumors but did not affect 
overall survival of TMZ-sensitive tumor bearing mice. In conclusion, our results 
showed that metformin is able to enhance TMZ effect in TMZ-resistant cell line 
suggesting its potential use in TMZ refractory GBM patients. However, the lack 
of effect on a GBM malignancy marker like CD133 requires further evaluation 
since it might influence response duration.

Persistent population aging worldwide is focusing attention on modifiable 
factors that can improve later life health. There is evidence that religiosity 
and spirituality are among such factors. Older people tend to have high rates of 
involvement in religious and/or spiritual endeavors and it is possible that 
population aging will be associated with increasing prevalence of religious and 
spiritual activity worldwide. Despite increasing research on religiosity, 
spirituality and health among older persons, population aging worldwide suggests 
the need for a globally integrated approach. As a step toward this, we review a 
subset of the literature on the impact of religiosity and spirituality on health 
in later life. We find that much of this has looked at the relationship between 
religiosity/spirituality and longevity as well as physical and mental health. 
Mechanisms include social support, health behaviors, stress and psychosocial 
factors. We identify a number of gaps in current knowledge. Many previous 
studies have taken place in the U.S. and Europe. Much data is cross-sectional, 
limiting ability to make causal inference. Religiosity and spirituality can be 
difficult to define and distinguish and the two concepts are often considered 
together, though on balance religiosity has received more attention than 
spirituality. The latter may however be equally important. Although there is 
evidence that religiosity is associated with longer life and better physical and 
mental health, these outcomes have been investigated separately rather than 
together such as in measures of health expectancy. In conclusion, there is a 
need for a unified and nuanced approach to understanding how religiosity and 
spirituality impact on health and longevity within a context of global aging, in 
particular whether they result in longer healthy life rather than just longer 
life.

We evaluate the variability in estimates of self-reported physical limitations 
by age across four nationally representative surveys in the US. We consider its 
implications for determining whether, as previous literature suggests, the US 
estimates reveal limitations at an earlier age than in three countries with 
similar life expectancy: England, Taiwan, and Costa Rica. Based on 
cross-sectional data from seven population-based surveys, we use local mean 
smoothing to plot self-reported limitations by age for each of four physical 
tasks for each survey, stratified by sex. We find substantial variation in the 
estimates in the US across four nationally-representative surveys. For example, 
one US survey suggests that American women experience a walking limitation 15 
years earlier than their Costa Rican counterparts, while another US survey 
implies that Americans have a 4-year advantage. Differences in mode of survey 
may account for higher prevalence of limitations in the one survey that used a 
self-administered mail-in questionnaire than in the other surveys that used 
in-person or telephone interviews. Yet, even among US surveys that used the same 
mode, there is still so much variability in estimates that we cannot conclude 
whether Americans have better or worse function than their counterparts in the 
other countries. Seemingly minor differences in question wording and response 
categories may account for the remaining inconsistency. If minor differences in 
question wording can result in such extensive variation in the estimates within 
a given population, then lack of comparability is likely to be an even greater 
problem when examining results across countries that do not share the same 
language or culture. Despite the potential utility of self-reported physical 
function within a survey sample, our findings imply that absolute estimates of 
population-level prevalence of self-reported physical limitations are unlikely 
to be strictly comparable across countries-or even across surveys within the 
same population.

Surgeon-modified retrograde branched extension limb assembling technique and 
bridged endografts were successfully used to exclude an asymptomatic pararenal 
abdominal aortic aneurysm and to reconstruct the superior mesenteric artery and 
bilateral renal arteries in a case with high-grade celiac artery stenosis, 
nondilated aorta above the superior mesenteric artery, and large lumen below the 
renal arteries. In patient-specific models for hemodynamics analysis, enhanced 
flow diversion to visceral arteries up to 6-month follow-up confirmed treatment 
feasibility; however, endograft configurations could be improved to avoid sharp 
corners at bifurcations, thereby ensuring smooth flow transport and possibly 
reducing risk for endograft narrowing or the development of thrombosis.

Checkpoint Inhibitors, Palliative Care, or Hospice.

PURPOSE: Checkpoint (CTLA-4, PD-1, and PD-L1) inhibitors have changed the face 
of oncology. A subset of patients enjoys long, gratifying treatment responses. 
Unfortunately, most patients do not respond even when expressing favorably 
markers such as PD-L1. Checkpoint inhibitors are largely palliative (though a 
subset have long-term cancer responses) and as such patient-related outcome 
measures should be included when evaluating benefits. The purpose of this review 
is to place checkpoint inhibitor trials within a palliation context. Included is 
a discussion on potential adverse effects on end-of-life care.
RECENT FINDINGS: Pivotal studies have presented efficacy and safety data but we 
have little published data on quality of life or symptom responses. Extension of 
life is approximately 2-3 months with some long-term responses in a minority of 
patients. The cost of checkpoint inhibitors is high for utility (as measured by 
quality-adjusted life-year saved) and ranges from 81,000 to over 200,000 USD for 
quality-adjusted life-year saved. Adverse effects were suboptimally reported in 
multiple studies. Meaningful responses in many trials as defined by the European 
Society of Medical Oncology are modest. Because at least for now, checkpoint 
inhibitors are used in advanced cancer and largely palliative patients should be 
seen by palliative specialists, symptoms related to cancer assessed, and 
advanced directives addressed. Treatment-related autoimmune diseases represent 
toxicities which oncologists and palliative specialists must understand. This 
means that palliative care specialists should know about the benefits and 
adverse effects of these agents. Whether checkpoint inhibitors increase or 
decrease aggressive care, hospice referrals, and costs at the end of life is yet 
to be determined.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is frequently 
associated with co-morbidities that exacerbate cardiovascular (CV) risk. CV 
disease is the leading cause of death in people with diabetes across the world 
and accounts for approximately half the deaths in the T2DM population. Hence, 
the objective of present study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of 
empagliflozin, in addition to standard of care (SoC), for the treatment of adult 
patients with T2DM and high CV risk in Greece.
METHODS: A health economic model was used to project clinical and economic 
outcomes of patients receiving empagliflozin plus SoC compared with those 
receiving SoC alone over a lifetime horizon. CV and renal event rates were 
derived from patient level data from the EMPA-REG-OUTCOME® trial by fitting 
time-dependent parametric survival functions. 5000 individual patient profiles 
randomly sampled from the trial were simulated using a time-to-event approach. 
Model extrapolated outcomes included life years (LYs), quality-adjusted life 
years (QALYs), costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Following 
a Greek third-party payer perspective, only direct medical costs related to drug 
acquisition as well as fatal and non-fatal diabetes-related complications were 
considered (€2016). Cost units and utility data were extracted from the 
literature and publicly available official sources. Sensitivity analyses 
explored the impact of changes in input data.
RESULTS: Over a patient's lifetime, empagliflozin was predicted to result in 
longer mean survival (14.01 LY vs. 11.87 LY with SoC) and reduced rate of 
clinical events accumulating 7.75 QALYs versus 6.83 QALYs on SoC alone at 
additional costs of €4235. The generated ICER of empagliflozin was €4633 per 
QALY gained. One-way sensitivity analysis confirmed empagliflozin's 
cost-effective profile. At the defined willingness-to-pay threshold of €34,000 
per QALY gained, probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that empagliflozin 
was estimated to have a 100% probability of being cost-effective relative to 
SoC.
CONCLUSIONS: Empagliflozin added to SoC was estimated to be a highly 
cost-effective treatment option for the treatment of T2DM in adults with 
increased CV disease risk in Greece.

Preference elicitation studies reporting societal views on the relative value of 
end-of-life treatments have produced equivocal results. This paper presents an 
alternative method, combining Q methodology and survey techniques (Q2S) to 
determine the distribution of 3 viewpoints on the relative value of end-of-life 
treatments identified in a previous, published, phase of this work. These were 
Viewpoint 1, "A population perspective: value for money, no special cases"; 
Viewpoint 2, "Life is precious: valuing life-extension and patient choice"; and 
Viewpoint 3, "Valuing wider benefits and opportunity cost: the quality of life 
and death." A Q2S survey of 4,902 respondents across the United Kingdom measured 
agreement with these viewpoints; 37% most agreed with Viewpoint 1, 49% with 
Viewpoint 2, and 9% with Viewpoint 3. Regression analysis showed associations of 
viewpoints with gender, level of education, religion, voting preferences, and 
satisfaction with the NHS. The Q2S approach provides a promising means to 
investigate how in-depth views and opinions are represented in the wider 
population. As demonstrated in this study, there is often more than 1 viewpoint 
on a topic and methods that seek to estimate that averages may not provide the 
best guidance for societal decision-making.

The personal communities of men experiencing later life widowhood.

Collins T(1).

Author information:

Increasingly men are becoming widowed in later life due in part to a longer life 
expectancy. Social networks and social support are thought to help buffer the 
negative consequences of such later life transitions. This paper explores the 
personal communities of a group of older men experiencing widowhood. Qualitative 
in-depth interviews were conducted, September 2013-February 2014, with seven 
older widowers, 71-89 years of age, in North Staffordshire, UK. Interviews 
included personal community diagrams to identify the structure of the older 
men's social relationships. Data analysis comprised thematic analysis of 
interview transcripts and content analysis of personal community diagrams. Three 
overarching themes were identified from the interview data: "Personal identity 
and resilience assist transition," "Continuity in personal communities provides 
stability" and "Changes in social relationships and practices facilitate 
adaptation." The study identified three types of personal community among the 
older widowers, comprising different combinations of family, friends and others. 
The findings illustrate that some older widowers have very restricted personal 
communities which puts them at greater risk of loneliness and social isolation. 
The social needs of long-term carers should be addressed as isolation and 
loneliness can begin long before the death of a spouse. It is important to 
consider gender differences and preferences when designing interventions for 
older people in order to promote engagement, social inclusion and well-being.

OBJECTIVE: To study the clinical outcome of manipulation release combined with 
arthroscopic debridement and synovia resection under general anesthesia for 
early hip involvment in patients with ankylosing spondylitis.
METHODS: Manipulation release combined with arthroscpic debridement and synovium 
resection were performed for hip lesion in 22 patients with ankylosing 
spondylitis from June 2011 to June 2013, incuding 6 males and 16 females with 
anverage age of 24.7 years ranging from 17 to 23 years. The course of the 
diseases was from 10 to 41 months(22.1 months on average). After 6 months of 
conservative treatment, hip pain and other symptoms were no relief. The 
preoperative and postoperative follow-up evaluation was performed and compared 
by the hip movement, VAS pain score, mHHS score and NAHS score.
RESULTS: All the patients were followed up for 26 to 44 months with an average 
of 30.2 months. The range of motion in active flexion-extension, 
abduction-adduction, internal-external rotation in 0° flexion and 90° flexion 
increased from (78.2±10.2)°, (36.3±6.4)°, (31.1±9.2)° and (37.3±10.5)° before 
operation to (113.5±8.4)°, (55.7±8.4)°, (58.7±2.1)° and (60.1±9.8)° after 
operation, respectively. The VAS scores decreased from 8.5±9.4 before operation 
to 5.5±7.1 after operation. The modified Harris and NAHS scores increased from 
60.8±6.9 and 56.9±6.25 before operation to 88.1±10.4 and 84.6±5.4 after 
operation, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Manipulation release combined with arthroscopic debridement and 
synovium resection under general anesthesia could effectively control the 
progression of hip lesion in patients with ankylosing spondylitis restoring the 
ROM, relieve pain symptoms, delay joint deformity and ankylosis with less 
bleeding, faster recovery, and significantly improve patients' quality of life.

Health Care Public Sector Share and the U.S. Life Expectancy Lag: A 
Country-level Longitudinal Study.

Reynolds MM(1).

Growing research on the political economy of health has begun to emphasize 
sociopolitical influences on cross-national differences in population health 
above and beyond economic growth. While this research investigates the impact of 
overall public health spending as a share of GDP ("health care effort"), it has 
for the most part overlooked the distribution of health care spending across the 
public and private spheres ("public sector share"). I evaluate the relative 
contributions of health care effort, public sector share, and GDP to the large 
and growing disadvantage in U.S. life expectancy at birth relative to peer 
nations. I do so using fixed effects models with data from 16 wealthy democratic 
nations between 1960 and 2010. Results indicate that public sector share has a 
beneficial effect on longevity net of the effect of health care effort and that 
this effect is nonlinear, decreasing in magnitude as levels rise. Moreover, 
public sector share is a more powerful predictor of life expectancy at birth 
than GDP per capita. This study contributes to discussions around the political 
economy of health, the growth consensus, and the American lag in life 
expectancy. Policy implications vis-à-vis the U.S. Affordable Care Act are 
discussed.
