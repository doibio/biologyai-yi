resulting in suboptimal efficacy. Intravitreal aflibercept (IVT-AFL) every 
2 months after three initial monthly doses was clinically equivalent to RBZ 
monthly dosing (RBZ q4) in wAMD clinical trials. We assessed the 
cost-effectiveness of IVT-AFL versus RBZ q4 and RBZ PRN in Sweden.
METHODS: A Markov model compared IVT-AFL to RBZ q4 or RBZ PRN over 2 years. 
Health states were based on visual acuity in better-seeing eye; a proportion 
discontinued treatment monthly or upon visual acuity <20/400. Parameters were 
estimated from trial data, published literature or expert opinion. Analyses were 
performed from a societal perspective with a lifetime horizon. The model 
calculated costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), discounted 3% annually. Deterministic and 
probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed.
RESULTS: Lifetime cost of IVT-AFL was 578 400 SEK, compared with 565 700 SEK for 
RBZ PRN and 686 600 SEK for RBZ q4. Compared with RBZ PRN, the ICER of IVT-AFL 
was 27 000 SEK/QALY gained. RBZ q4 cost 20.4 million SEK/QALY gained versus 
IVT-AFL. Results were sensitive to IVT-AFL efficacy, but IVT-AFL had a 100% 
probability of being cost-effective versus both RBZ PRN and RBZ q4 at a 
willingness-to-pay threshold of 500 000 SEK.
CONCLUSION: Results suggest, in Sweden, at parity price level, IVT-AFL is less 
costly than RBZ q4, while demonstrating similar efficacy; IVT-AFL is 
cost-effective versus RBZ PRN.

BACKGROUND: Islet cell transplantation is a method to stabilize type 1 diabetes 
patients with hypoglycemia unawareness and unstable blood glucose levels by 
reducing insulin dependency and protecting against severe hypoglycemia through 
restoring endogenous insulin secretion. This study analyses the current 
cost-effectiveness of this technology and estimates the value of further 
research to reduce uncertainty around cost-effectiveness.
METHODS: We performed a cost-utility analysis using a Markov cohort model with a 
mean patient age of 49 to simulate costs and health outcomes over a life-time 
horizon. Our analysis used intensive insulin therapy (IIT) as comparator and 
took the provincial healthcare provider perspective. Cost and effectiveness data 
for up to four transplantations per patient came from the University of Alberta 
hospital. Costs are expressed in 2012 Canadian dollars and effectiveness in 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and life years. To characterize the 
uncertainty around expected outcomes, we carried out a probabilistic sensitivity 
analysis within the Bayesian decision-analytic framework. We performed a 
value-of-information analysis to identify priority areas for future research 
under various scenarios. We applied a structural sensitivity analysis to assess 
the dependence of outcomes on model characteristics.
RESULTS: Compared to IIT, islet cell transplantation using non-generic (generic) 
immunosuppression had additional costs of $150,006 ($112,023) per additional 
QALY, an average gain of 3.3 life years, and a probability of being 
cost-effective of 0.5 % (28.3 %) at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000 
per QALY. At this threshold the non-generic technology has an expected value of 
perfect information (EVPI) of $260,744 for Alberta. This increases substantially 
in cost-reduction scenarios. The research areas with the highest partial EVPI 
are costs, followed by natural history, and effectiveness and safety.
CONCLUSIONS: Current transplantation technology provides substantial 
improvements in health outcomes over conventional therapy for highly selected 
patients with 'unstable' type 1 diabetes. However, it is much more costly and so 
is not cost-effective. The value of further research into the cost-effectiveness 
is dependent upon treatment costs. Further, we suggest the value of information 
should not only be derived from current data alone when knowing that this data 
will most likely change in the future.

BACKGROUND: Long-term prognosis of patients with characteristics of both chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma, named asthma-COPD overlap, is 
poorly described. We investigated the long-term prognosis of individuals with 
different types of chronic airway disease, with a special focus on individuals 
with asthma-COPD overlap.
METHODS: We assigned participants from the Copenhagen City Heart Study into six 
subgroups: healthy never-smokers, ever-smokers without asthma and COPD, those 
with asthma with low cumulated smoking exposure and no airflow limitation, those 
with COPD, those with asthma-COPD overlap with asthma onset before the age of 40 
years, and those with asthma-COPD overlap with asthma onset after the age of 40 
years. We defined asthma-COPD overlap as current self-reported asthma and a 
postbronchodilatatory forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) to forced vital 
capacity ratio of less than 0·7, without any restrictions regarding smoking. We 
investigated the course of FEV1 decline for 18 years and risk of admission to 
hospital due to exacerbations or pneumonias and respiratory and all-cause 
mortality for 22 years. We analysed FEV1 decline in the six groups using a 
linear mixed-effects model.
FINDINGS: We included 8382 participants from the Copenhagen City Heart Study in 
our study: 2199 never-smokers, 5435 ever-smokers, 158 with asthma, 320 with 
COPD, 68 with asthma-COPD overlap with early-onset asthma, and 202 with 
asthma-COPD overlap with late-onset asthma. The multivariable-adjusted decline 
in FEV1 in asthma-COPD overlap with early-onset asthma was 27·3 mL (standard 
error 5·0) per year, which did not differ significantly from the decline of 20·9 
mL (1·2) per year in healthy never-smokers (p=0·19). FEV1 decline in individuals 
with asthma-COPD overlap with late-onset asthma was 49·6 mL (3·0) per year, 
higher than the decline in asthma-COPD overlap with early-onset asthma 
(p=0·0001), the decline of 39·5 mL (2·5) per year in COPD (p=0·003), and the 
decline in healthy never-smokers (p<0·0001). Hazard ratios for hospital 
admissions due to exacerbations of asthma or COPD were 39·48 (95% CI 
25·93-60·11) in asthma-COPD overlap with early-onset asthma, 83·47 
(61·67-112·98) in asthma-COPD overlap with late-onset asthma, 23·80 
(17·43-33·50) in COPD, and 14·74 (10·06-21·59) in asthma compared with 
never-smokers without lung disease (all p<0·0001). Life expectancy was 9·3 years 
(5·4-13·1) shorter in participants with asthma-COPD overlap with early-onset 
asthma, 12·8 years (11·1-14·6) shorter in those with asthma-COPD overlap with 
late-onset asthma, 10·1 years (8·6-11·5) shorter in those with COPD (all 
p<0·0001), and 3·3 years (1·0-5·5) shorter in those with asthma (p=0·004) than 
in healthy never-smokers.
INTERPRETATION: Prognosis of individuals with asthma-COPD overlap is poor and 
seems to be affected by the age of recognition of asthma, being worst in those 
with late asthma onset (after 40 years of age). Such patients should be followed 
up closely to prevent fast lung function decline and exacerbations.

Stabilizing survival selection on presenescent expression of a sexual ornament 
followed by a terminal decline.

Senescence is a decrease in functional capacity, increasing mortality rate with 
age. Sexual signals indicate functional capacity, because costs of ornamentation 
ensure signal honesty, and are therefore expected to senesce, tracking 
physiological deterioration and mortality. For sexual traits, mixed associations 
with age and positive associations with life expectancy have been reported. 
However, whether these associations are caused by selective disappearance and/or 
within-individual senescence of sexual signals, respectively, is not known. We 
previously reported that zebra finches with redder bills had greater life 
expectancy, based on a single bill colour measurement per individual. We here 
extend this analysis using longitudinal data and show that this finding is 
attributable to terminal declines in bill redness in the year before death, with 
no detectable change in presenescent redness. Additionally, there was a 
quadratic relationship between presenescent bill colouration and survival: 
individuals with intermediate bill redness have maximum survival prospects. This 
may reflect that redder individuals overinvest in colouration and/or associated 
physiological changes, while below-average bill redness probably reflects poorer 
phenotypic quality. Together, this pattern suggests that bill colouration is 
defended against physiological deterioration, because of mate attraction 
benefits, or that physiological deterioration is not a gradual process, but 
accelerates sharply prior to death. We discuss these possibilities in the 
context of the reliability theory of ageing and sexual selection.

How we manage immune thrombocytopenia in the elderly.

With prolonged life expectancy, immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is frequent in 
elderly people. In this setting, ITP diagnosis is challenging because of the 
concern about an underlying myelodysplastic syndrome. Studies of older adults 
are lacking, and recommendations for treatment are based mainly on expert 
opinion. The therapeutic strategy differs from that for younger patients and 
must take into account the greater risk of bleeding and thrombosis, presence of 
comorbidities, possible impaired cognitive performance or poor life expectancy 
and concomitant medications, such as anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy. 
Steroids and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) therapy remain the first-line 
treatments in elderly patients, but prolonged treatment with steroids should be 
avoided and IVIg treatment may lead to renal failure. Splenectomy is less 
effective than in young patients and risk of thrombosis is increased. Severe 
co-morbidities can also contraindicate surgery. Therefore, other second-line 
treatments are frequently preferred. Danazol and dapsone can be an option for 
the less severe ITP form. Rituximab is a good option except in patients with a 
history of infection or with hypogammaglobulinaemia. Thrombopoietin agonists are 
attractive, especially for patients with severe comorbidities or with limited 
life expectancy but the risk of thrombosis is a concern.

Medical Research, University of Sydney, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.

Discontinuation of statins may be considered for older individuals with a 
cancer, multi-morbidity, approaching end-of-life and in primary prevention. The 
aim of this study is to investigate the relationship between the rates of statin 
discontinuation in the last 12 months of life and a diagnosis of cancer, and in 
individuals using statins for primary or secondary prevention. A case-control 
study of matched cases and controls. Matching was based on age, Charlson 
comorbidity index scores and socioeconomic status. Prescription and diagnostic 
data for 20,482 individuals who were aged over 75 years, were in their last 
12 months of life and were receiving statins during the study period (1 January 
2007 to 31 December 2012). After propensity score matching, we identified 4832 
cases with a diagnosis of cancer and 4809 matched controls. We used Cox 
regression to test the relationship between the relative risk of statin 
discontinuation and a diagnosis of cancer, and in individuals using statins for 
primary or secondary prevention. Statins were discontinued in 70.4% of older 
adults with a diagnosis of cancer and 55.8% of those without cancer (P < 0.05). 
The Cox regression analysis supports that a diagnosis of cancer can increase the 
rate of statin discontinuation compared with individuals without a diagnosis of 
cancer regardless of whether statins were used for primary or secondary 
prevention (P < 0.05). The findings from this study support that statins are 
likely to be discontinued in the last year of life in older people with limited 
life expectancy from cancer, even if statins were indicated for secondary 
prevention of cardiovascular disease.

BACKGROUND: Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in pemphigus has been widely 
investigated; nevertheless, utility values for economic evaluations are still 
lacking.
OBJECTIVES: To estimate health utilities for hypothetical pemphigus vulgaris 
(PV) and pemphigus foliaceus (PF) health states in a general population sample.
METHODS: Three health states (uncontrolled PV, uncontrolled PF and controlled 
pemphigus) were developed based on a systematic literature review of HRQoL 
studies in pemphigus. Utilities were obtained from a convenience sample of 108 
adults using a visual analogue scale (VAS) and 10-year time trade-off (TTO). 
Lead-time TTO was applied for health states regarded as worse than dead with a 
lead time to disease time ratio of 1 : 1.
RESULTS: The mean VAS utility scores for PV, PF and controlled pemphigus were 
0·25 ± 0·15, 0·37 ± 0·17 and 0·63 ± 0·16, respectively. Corresponding TTO 
utilities were as follows: 0·34 ± 0·38, 0·51 ± 0·32 and 0·75 ± 0·31. Overall, 
14% and 6% judged PV and PF as being worse than dead. For both VAS and TTO 
values, significant differences were observed between all health states (P < 
0·001). VAS utilities were rated significantly lower compared with TTO in each 
health state (P < 0·001).
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study that reports health utility values for PV 
and PF. Successful treatment of pemphigus might result in significant utility 
gain (0·24-0·41). These empirical findings with respect to three health states 
in pemphigus may serve as anchor points for further utility studies and 
cost-effectiveness analyses.

We propose a strategy of scheduled intermittent dosing in place of daily 
administration of antipsychotic medications for the treatment of patients with 
schizophrenia. Intermittent (extended) dosing has already been demonstrated to 
be at least equally effective as daily administration of antipsychotic 
medications. It is increasingly appreciated that remission of positive symptoms 
is not the same as recovery: a resumption of a productive and socially 
gratifying life. Our field has focused on positive symptoms to the exclusion of 
cognitive deterioration and emotional blunting. Dopamine is the primary 
neurotransmitter responsible for the accumulation and processing of new 
information as well as the expression of emotions modulated via the nucleus 
accumbens. Data suggests that patients receiving less accumulated antipsychotic 
agents do better over the years in achieving meaningful recoveries. In addition 
to clinical improvement, there is the financial benefit in giving less 
medication, which is often costly, over several decades. Finally, there is the 
possibility, albeit not yet demonstrated, that less accumulated antipsychotic 
agents might reduce the occurrence of significant weight gain, the metabolic 
syndrome, with its accompanying medical complications which not only impacts the 
quality of life and life expectancy of those who suffer from it, but also 
increases the financial burden to society.

Obesity and its major comorbidities, including type 2 diabetes mellitus, 
nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), obesity cardiomyopathy, and certain 
cancers, have caused life expectancy in the United States to decline in recent 
years. Obesity is the increased accumulation of triglycerides (TG), which are 
synthesized from glycerol and long-chain fatty acids (LCFA) throughout the body. 
LCFA enter adipocytes, hepatocytes, and cardiomyocytes via specific, facilitated 
transport processes. Metabolism of increased cellular TG content in obesity may 
lead to comorbidities such as NAFLD and cardiomyopathy. Better understanding of 
LCFA transport processes may lead to successful treatment of obesity and NAFLD.

Liver-related mortality is the third cause of death in patients with 
nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, but the long-term prognosis basically depends 
on the presence and severity of liver damage. Thus, life expectancy in patients 
with simple steatosis is not different from the general population, but 
liver-related mortality is significantly higher in patients with nonalcoholic 
steatohepatitis (NASH), particularly in those with advanced fibrosis. 
Progression of liver disease is observed in up to one-third of patients with 
NASH. The long-term hepatic prognosis mostly depends on the histologic stage at 
initial liver biopsy, but multiple risk factors may concur.

OBJECTIVE: This study compared the cost-effectiveness of direct-acting antiviral 
therapies currently recommended for treating genotypes (GT) 1 and 4 chronic 
hepatitis C (CHC) patients in the US.
METHODS: A cost-effectiveness analysis of treatments for CHC from a US payer's 
perspective over a lifelong time horizon was performed. A Markov model based on 
the natural history of CHC was used for a population that included 
treatment-naïve and -experienced patients. Treatment alternatives considered for 
GT1 included ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir ± ribavirin (3D ± R), 
sofosbuvir + ledipasvir (SOF/LDV), sofosbuvir + simeprevir (SOF + SMV), 
simeprevir + pegylated interferon/ribavirin (SMV + PR) and no treatment (NT). 
For GT4 treatments, ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + ribavirin (2D + R), 
SOF/LDV and NT were compared. Transition probabilities, utilities and costs were 
obtained from published literature. Outcomes included rates of compensated 
cirrhosis (CC), decompensated cirrhosis (DCC), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) 
and liver-related death (LrD), total costs, life-years and quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs). Costs and QALYs were used to calculate incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios.
RESULTS: In GT1 patients, 3D ± R and SOF-containing regimens have similar 
long-term outcomes; 3D ± R had the lowest lifetime risks of all liver disease 
outcomes: CC = 30.2%, DCC = 5.0 %, HCC = 6.8%, LT = 1.9% and LrD = 9.2%. In GT1 
patients, 3D ± R had the lowest cost and the highest QALYs. As a result, 3D ± R 
dominated these treatment options. In GT4 patients, 2D + R had lower rates of 
liver morbidity and mortality, lower cost and more QALYs than SOF/LDV and NT.
LIMITATIONS: While the results are based on input values, which were obtained 
from a variety of heterogeneous sources-including clinical trials, the findings 
were robust across a plausible range of input values, as demonstrated in 
probabilistic sensitivity analyses.
CONCLUSIONS: Among currently recommended treatments for GT1 and GT4 in the US, 
3D ± R (for GT1) and 2D + R (for GT4) have a favorable cost-effectiveness 
profile.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether racial differences across a variety of medical 
factors collected in a longitudinal clinical database at a specialty clinical 
for children with Down syndrome provide insight into contributors to racial 
disparity in mortality.
STUDY DESIGN: Comprehensive medical histories of 763 children receiving medical 
care at a Down syndrome specialty clinic were retrospectively reviewed regarding 
prenatal, postnatal, and medical issues, as well as subspecialty referrals. 
Frequency calculations and logistic regression were performed. The National 
Death Index was used to query death record databases to correlate medical 
histories with mortality data.
RESULTS: Prenatal drug use and intubation were significantly more frequent, but 
hyperbilirubinemia was significantly less frequent, in black children compared 
with white children with Down syndrome. Among children with Down syndrome aged 
<5 years, significant increases in referral to cardiology were seen for black 
children compared with white children. Trends were seen in an increased 
incidence of congenital heart disease for black children. Correlations with 
death records did not demonstrate differences in rates of cardiac-related 
deaths. Minimal racial disparity was seen for all other measures investigated.
CONCLUSION: Racial disparity in mortality exists, but the underlying cause 
remains unidentified despite use of a comprehensive, longitudinal database of 
individuals with Down syndrome and review of death records. Referrals to 
cardiology might be a clue to the underlying cause, perhaps as an indicator of 
access to care, but cardiac disease does not account for the disparity in 
mortality.

IMPORTANCE: The relationship between income and life expectancy is well 
established but remains poorly understood.
OBJECTIVES: To measure the level, time trend, and geographic variability in the 
association between income and life expectancy and to identify factors related 
to small area variation.
DESIGN AND SETTING: Income data for the US population were obtained from 1.4 
billion deidentified tax records between 1999 and 2014. Mortality data were 
obtained from Social Security Administration death records. These data were used 
to estimate race- and ethnicity-adjusted life expectancy at 40 years of age by 
household income percentile, sex, and geographic area, and to evaluate factors 
associated with differences in life expectancy.
EXPOSURE: Pretax household earnings as a measure of income.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Relationship between income and life expectancy; 
trends in life expectancy by income group; geographic variation in life 
expectancy levels and trends by income group; and factors associated with 
differences in life expectancy across areas.
RESULTS: The sample consisted of 1,408,287,218 person-year observations for 
individuals aged 40 to 76 years (mean age, 53.0 years; median household earnings 
among working individuals, $61,175 per year). There were 4,114,380 deaths among 
men (mortality rate, 596.3 per 100,000) and 2,694,808 deaths among women 
(mortality rate, 375.1 per 100,000). The analysis yielded 4 results. First, 
higher income was associated with greater longevity throughout the income 
distribution. The gap in life expectancy between the richest 1% and poorest 1% 
of individuals was 14.6 years (95% CI, 14.4 to 14.8 years) for men and 10.1 
years (95% CI, 9.9 to 10.3 years) for women. Second, inequality in life 
expectancy increased over time. Between 2001 and 2014, life expectancy increased 
by 2.34 years for men and 2.91 years for women in the top 5% of the income 
distribution, but by only 0.32 years for men and 0.04 years for women in the 
bottom 5% (P < .001 for the differences for both sexes). Third, life expectancy 
for low-income individuals varied substantially across local areas. In the 
bottom income quartile, life expectancy differed by approximately 4.5 years 
between areas with the highest and lowest longevity. Changes in life expectancy 
between 2001 and 2014 ranged from gains of more than 4 years to losses of more 
than 2 years across areas. Fourth, geographic differences in life expectancy for 
individuals in the lowest income quartile were significantly correlated with 
health behaviors such as smoking (r = -0.69, P < .001), but were not 
significantly correlated with access to medical care, physical environmental 
factors, income inequality, or labor market conditions. Life expectancy for 
low-income individuals was positively correlated with the local area fraction of 
immigrants (r = 0.72, P < .001), fraction of college graduates (r = 0.42, 
P < .001), and government expenditures (r = 0.57, P < .001).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In the United States between 2001 and 2014, higher 
income was associated with greater longevity, and differences in life expectancy 
across income groups increased over time. However, the association between life 
expectancy and income varied substantially across areas; differences in 
longevity across income groups decreased in some areas and increased in others. 
The differences in life expectancy were correlated with health behaviors and 
local area characteristics.

Aspirin for the Primary Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease and Colorectal 
Cancer: A Decision Analysis for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force.

Dehmer SP, Maciosek MV, Flottemesch TJ, LaFrance AB, Whitlock EP.

BACKGROUND: Evidence indicates that aspirin is effective for the primary 
prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and colorectal cancer (CRC) but also 
increases the risk for gastrointestinal (GI) and cerebral hemorrhages.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the net balance of benefits and harms from routine aspirin 
use across clinically relevant age, sex, and CVD risk groups.
DESIGN: Decision analysis using a microsimulation model.
DATA SOURCES: 3 systematic evidence reviews.
TARGET POPULATION: Men and women aged 40 to 79 years with a 10-year CVD risk of 
20% or less, and no history of CVD and without elevated risk for GI or cerebral 
hemorrhages that would contraindicate aspirin use.
TIME HORIZON: Lifetime, 20 years, and 10 years.
PERSPECTIVE: Clinical.
INTERVENTION: Low-dose aspirin (≤100 mg/d).
OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcomes are length and quality of life measured in 
net life-years and quality-adjusted life-years. Benefits include reduced 
nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal ischemic stroke, fatal CVD, CRC 
incidence, and CRC mortality. Harms include increased fatal and nonfatal GI 
bleeding and hemorrhagic stroke.
RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: Lifetime net quality-adjusted life-years are 
positive for most adults initiating aspirin at ages 40 to 69 years, and life 
expectancy gains are expected for most men and women initiating aspirin at ages 
40 to 59 years and 60 to 69 years with higher CVD risk. Harms may exceed 
benefits for persons starting aspirin in their 70s and for many during the first 
10 to 20 years of use.
RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: Results are most sensitive to the relative risk 
for hemorrhagic stroke and CVD mortality but are affected by all relative risk 
estimates, baseline GI bleeding incidence and case-fatality rates, and 
disutilities associated with aspirin use.
LIMITATIONS: Aspirin effects by age are uncertain. Stroke benefits are 
conservatively estimated. Gastrointestinal bleeding incidence and case-fatality 
rates account only for age and sex.
CONCLUSION: Lifetime aspirin use for primary prevention initiated at younger 
ages (40 to 69 years) and in persons with higher CVD risk shows the greatest 
potential for positive net benefit.

Aspirin Use for the Primary Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease and Colorectal 
Cancer: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Recommendation Statement.

Bibbins-Domingo K; U.S. Preventive Services Task Force.

Comment in
    Ann Intern Med. 2016 Jun 21;164(12 ):846-7.
    Am J Kidney Dis. 2017 Mar;69(3):337-340.

DESCRIPTION: Update of the 2009 USPSTF recommendation on aspirin use to prevent 
cardiovascular disease (CVD) events and the 2007 recommendation on aspirin and 
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use to prevent colorectal cancer (CRC).
METHODS: The USPSTF reviewed 5 additional studies of aspirin for the primary 
prevention of CVD and several additional analyses of CRC follow-up data. The 
USPSTF also relied on commissioned systematic reviews of all-cause mortality and 
total cancer incidence and mortality and a comprehensive review of harms. The 
USPSTF then used a microsimulation model to systematically estimate the balance 
of benefits and harms.
POPULATION: This recommendation applies to adults aged 40 years or older without 
known CVD and without increased bleeding risk.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The USPSTF recommends initiating low-dose aspirin use for the 
primary prevention of CVD and CRC in adults aged 50 to 59 years who have a 10% 
or greater 10-year CVD risk, are not at increased risk for bleeding, have a life 
expectancy of at least 10 years, and are willing to take low-dose aspirin daily 
for at least 10 years. (B recommendation) The decision to initiate low-dose 
aspirin use for the primary prevention of CVD and CRC in adults aged 60 to 69 
years who have a 10% or greater 10-year CVD risk should be an individual one. 
Persons who are not at increased risk for bleeding, have a life expectancy of at 
least 10 years, and are willing to take low-dose aspirin daily for at least 10 
years are more likely to benefit. Persons who place a higher value on the 
potential benefits than the potential harms may choose to initiate low-dose 
aspirin. (C recommendation) The current evidence is insufficient to assess the 
balance of benefits and harms of initiating aspirin use for the primary 
prevention of CVD and CRC in adults younger than 50 years. (I statement) The 
current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of 
initiating aspirin use for the primary prevention of CVD and CRC in adults aged 
70 years or older. (I statement).

IMPORTANCE: Clinical practice recommendations increasingly advocate that older 
patients' life expectancy be considered to inform a number of clinical 
decisions. It is not clear how primary care practitioners approach these 
recommendations in their clinical practice.
OBJECTIVE: To explore the range of perspectives from primary care practitioners 
on long-term prognosis, defined as prognosis regarding life expectancy in the 
range of years, in their care of older adults.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A qualitative, semistructured interview study 
was conducted in a large group practice with multiple sites in rural, urban, and 
suburban settings. Twenty-eight primary care practitioners were interviewed; 20 
of these participants (71%) reported that at least 25% of their patient panel 
was older adults. The audiorecorded discussions were transcribed and analyzed, 
using qualitative content analysis to identify major themes and subthemes. The 
study was conducted between January 30 and May 13, 2015. Data analysis was 
performed between June 10 and September 1, 2015.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The constant comparative approach was used to 
qualitatively analyze the content of the transcripts.
RESULTS: Of the 28 participants, 16 were women and 21 were white; the mean (SD) 
age was 46.2 (10.3) years. Twenty-six were physicians and 2 were nurse 
practitioners. Their time since completing clinical training was 16.0 (11.4) 
years. These primary care practitioners reported considering life expectancy, 
often in the range of 5 to 10 years, in several clinical scenarios in the care 
of older adults, but balanced the prognosis consideration against various other 
factors in decision making. In particular, patient age was found to modulate how 
prognosis affects the primary care practitioners' decision making, with 
significant reluctance among them to cease preventive care that has a long lag 
time to achieve benefit in younger patients despite limited life expectancy. The 
participants assessed life expectancy based on clinical experience rather than 
using validated tools and varied widely in their prognostication time frame, 
from 2 years to 30 years. Participants often considered prognosis without 
explicitly discussing it with patients and disagreed on whether and when 
long-term prognosis needs to be specifically discussed. The participants 
identified numerous barriers to incorporating prognosis in the care of older 
adults including uncertainty in predicting prognosis, difficulty in discussing 
prognosis, and concern about patient reactions.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Despite clinical recommendations to increasingly 
incorporate patients' long-term prognosis in clinical decisions, primary care 
practitioners encounter several barriers and ambiguities in the implementation 
of these recommendations.

Organising healthcare services for persons with an intellectual disability.

Update of
    Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2008;(4):CD007492.

BACKGROUND: When compared to the general population, persons with an 
intellectual disability have lower life expectancy, higher morbidity, and more 
difficulty finding and obtaining healthcare. Organisational interventions are 
used to reconfigure the structure or delivery of healthcare services. This is 
the first update of the original review.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of organisational interventions of healthcare 
services for the mental and physical health problems of persons with an 
intellectual disability.
SEARCH METHODS: For this update we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and 
other databases, from April 2006 to 4 September 2015. We checked reference lists 
of included studies and consulted experts in the field.
SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials of organisational interventions 
of healthcare services aimed at improving care of mental and physical health 
problems of adult persons with an intellectual disability.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We employed standard methodological procedures as 
outlined in the Cochrane Handbook of Systematic Reviews of Interventions, in 
addition to specific guidance from the Cochrane Effective Practice and 
Organisation of Care (EPOC) Group.
MAIN RESULTS: We identified one new trial from the updated searches.Seven trials 
(347 participants) met the selection criteria. The interventions varied but had 
common components: interventions that increased the intensity and frequency of 
service delivery (4 trials, 200 participants), community-based specialist 
behaviour therapy (1 trial, 63 participants), and outreach treatment (1 trial, 
50 participants). Another trial compared two active arms (traditional 
counselling and integrated intervention for bereavement, 34 participants).The 
included studies investigated interventions dealing with the mental health 
problems of persons with an intellectual disability; none focused on physical 
health problems. Four studies assessed the effect of organisational 
interventions on behavioural problems for persons with an intellectual 
disability, three assessed care giver burden, and three assessed the costs 
associated with the interventions. None of the included studies reported data on 
the effect of organisational interventions on adverse events. Most studies were 
assessed as having low risk of bias.It is uncertain whether interventions that 
increase the frequency and intensity of delivery or outreach treatment decrease 
behavioural problems for persons with an intellectual disability (two and one 
trials respectively, very low certainty evidence). Behavioural problems were 
slightly decreased by community-based specialist behavioural therapy (one trial, 
low certainty evidence). Increasing the frequency and intensity of service 
delivery probably makes little or no difference to care giver burden (MD 0.03, 
95% CI -3.48 to 3.54, two trials, moderate certainty evidence). It is uncertain 
whether outreach treatment makes any difference for care giver burden (one 
trial, very low certainty evidence). There was very limited evidence regarding 
costs, with low to very low certainty evidence for the different interventions.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is very limited evidence on the organisation of 
healthcare services for persons with an intellectual disability. There are 
currently no well-designed studies focusing on organising the health services of 
persons with an intellectual disability and concurrent physical problems. There 
are very few studies of organisational interventions targeting mental health 
needs and the results of those that were found need corroboration. There is an 
urgent need for high-quality health services research to identify optimal health 
services for persons with an intellectual disability and concurrent physical 
problem.

Neuropscyhological Complications of HIV Disease and Substances of Abuse.

In the last decade, it has become increasingly apparent that neuropsychological 
deficits and impairments are associated with HIV infection. Given that 
antiretroviral therapies have extended the life expectancy of HIV-infected 
persons, it becomes critical to focus on the physical and mental health of these 
patients. Understanding the neuropsychology of HIV disease can provide insight 
into improving mental health, functional capacity and overall quality of life 
for persons living with HIV/AIDS. Furthermore, clinicians may be better able to 
assist patients to manage their symptoms, thereby increasing the number of 
patients who are able to successfully maintain difficult treatment schedules. In 
addition, it is equally important to understand the potentially exacerbating 
effects of various factors. One such factor is substance abuse, which has been 
associated with various neuropsychological impairments, irrespective of the 
substance of abuse. Therefore, a more complete understanding of the effects of 
substance abuse on the progression of impaired cognitive processes and 
functioning can allow for an enhanced evaluation and management of those 
patients who live with HIV disease and who suffer from substance abuse 
disorders. As such, the present paper provides an overview of the 
neuropsychology of HIV and substance abuse, as well as of the available research 
that has examined the potential interaction effects between HIV disease and 
substance abuse. The implications of the findings as well as directions for 
future research are discussed.
