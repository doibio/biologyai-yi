BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: An accurate estimate of the loss of lifetime 
employment duration resulting from kidney failure can facilitate comprehensive 
evaluation of societal financial burdens.
DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: All patients undergoing incident 
dialysis in Taiwan during 2000-2017 were identified using the National Health 
Insurance Research Database. The corresponding age-, sex-, and calendar 
year-matched general population served as the referents. The survival functions 
and the employment states of the index cohort (patients on dialysis) and their 
referents for each age strata were first calculated, and then extrapolated until 
age 65 years, where the sum of the product of the survival function and the 
employment states was the lifetime employment duration. The difference in 
lifetime employment duration between the index and referent cohort was the loss 
of lifetime employment duration. Extrapolation of survival function and relative 
employment-to-population ratios were estimated by the restricted cubic spline 
models and the quadratic/linear models, respectively.
RESULTS: A total of 83,358 patients with kidney failure were identified. Men had 
a higher rate of employment than women in each age strata. The expected loss of 
lifetime employment duration for men with kidney failure was 11.8, 7.6, 5.7, 
3.8, 2.3, 1.0, and 0.2 years for those aged 25-34, 35-40, 41-45, 46-50, 51-55, 
56-60, and 61-64 years, respectively; and the corresponding data for women was 
10.5, 10.1, 7.9, 5.6, 3.3, 1.5, and 0.3 years, respectively. The values for loss 
of lifetime employment duration divided by loss of life expectancy were all >70% 
for women and >88% for men across the different age strata. The sensitivity 
analyses indicated that the results were robust.
CONCLUSIONS: The loss of lifetime employment duration in patients undergoing 
dialysis mainly originates from loss of life expectancy.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the clinical and economic consequences of continuous 
subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) vs. multiple daily injections (MDI) in 
children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) from a public 
health care system in developed areas of developing country, considering changes 
in glycemic Control, daily insulin requirements, lipid profile, body mass index 
(BMI), frequency of severe hypoglycemia and Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA) and 
diabetic complications.
METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of children and adolescents with 
T1DM. Data were collected at baseline and the end of every year including 
glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), insulin dose, lipid profile, blood pressure, and 
adverse events (severe hypoglycemia and DKA). The Cost-effectiveness analysis 
was performed using the IQVIA CORE Diabetes Model (CDM) to simulate diabetes 
progression by utilizing the clinical data obtained from the two groups. The 
main outcome measures were Life Expectancy, Quality adjusted life years (QALYs), 
Total Costs and Incremental Costs and Effectiveness Ratio (ICER) of CSII 
compared with MDI in Chinese pediatric patients with T1DM in Qingdao City (60 
years).
RESULTS: Mean HbA1c values and daily insulin doses were significantly lower in 
those receiving CSII therapy throughout follow-up. Mean direct lifetime costs 
were ¥ 67,137 higher with CSII treatment than with MDI for pediatric patients. 
Treatment with CSII was associated with an improvement in life expectancy of 
0.41 years for pediatric patients compared with MDI based on CORE diabetes model 
simulation. The corresponding gains in QALYs were 0.42. These data produced 
corresponding ICER is ¥ 161,815 per QALY for pediatric T1DM patients in Qingdao. 
Sensitivity analyses suggested that our base-case assumptions were mostly 
robust.
CONCLUSIONS: CSII is associated with improved long-term clinical outcomes 
compared with MDI. Based on this model analysis, CSII appears to be more 
cost-effective for the Qingdao TIDM pediatric population and health care system.

Background: The non-homogenous distribution of antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) 
within solid tumors is a major limiting factor for their wide clinical 
application. Nanobodies have been shown to rapidly penetrate into xenografts, 
achieving more homogeneous tumor targeting. However, their rapid renal clearance 
can hamper their application as nanobody drug conjugates (NDCs). Here, we 
evaluate whether half-life extension via non-covalent interaction with albumin 
can benefit the efficacy of a HER2-targeted NDC. Methods: HER2-targeted nanobody 
11A4 and the irrelevant nanobody R2 were genetically fused to an albumin-binding 
domain (ABD) at their C-terminus. Binding to both albumin and tumor cells was 
determined by ELISA-based assays. The internalization potential as well as the 
in vitro efficacy of NDCs were tested on HER2 expressing cells. Serum half-life 
of iodinated R2 and R2-ABD was studied in tumor-free mice. The distribution of 
fluorescently labelled 11A4 and 11A4-ABD was assessed in vitro in 3D spheroids. 
Subsequently, the in vivo distribution was evaluated by optical molecular 
imaging and ex vivo by tissue biodistribution and tumor immunohistochemical 
analysis after intravenous injection of IRDye800-conjugated nanobodies in mice 
bearing HER2-positive subcutaneous xenografts. Finally, efficacy studies were 
performed in HER2-positive NCI-N87 xenograft-bearing mice intravenously injected 
with a single dose (250 nmol/kg) of nanobodies conjugated to auristatin F (AF) 
either via a maleimide or the organic Pt(II)‑based linker, coined Lx®. Results: 
11A4-ABD was able to bind albumin and HER2 and was internalized by HER2 
expressing cells, irrespective of albumin presence. Interaction with albumin did 
not alter its distribution through 3D spheroids. Fusion to ABD resulted in a 
14.8-fold increase in the serum half-life, as illustrated with the irrelevant 
nanobody. Furthermore, ABD fusion prolonged the accumulation of 11A4-ABD in 
HER2-expressing xenografts without affecting the expected homogenous 
intratumoral distribution. Next to that, reduced kidney retention of ABD-fused 
nanobodies was observed. Finally, a single dose administration of either 
11A4-ABD-maleimide-AF or 11A4-ABD-Lx-AF led to long-lasting tumor remission in 
HER2-positive NCI-N87 xenograft-bearing mice. Conclusion: Our results 
demonstrate that genetic fusion of a nanobody to ABD can significantly extend 
serum half-life, resulting in prolonged and homogenous tumor accumulation. Most 
importantly, as supported by the impressive anti-tumor efficacy observed after a 
single dose administration of 11A4-ABD-AF, our data reveal that monovalent 
internalizing ABD-fused nanobodies have potential for the development of highly 
effective NDCs.

In this study, World Bank socioeconomic data of 61 countries during 2009-2015 
combine with a semi-systematic literature review was applied to analyze the 
relationship between plastic consumptions and socioeconomic levels 
statistically. Based on a total data volume of 5551, we found that all countries 
can be divided into different groups like the continent, income status, and 
coastal countries. It is showed that most plastics were consumed by North 
America, Europe, high-income countries, and coastal countries in the Pacific and 
the Atlantic Ocean. A potential relation occurred in plastic consumptions with 
different socioeconomic parameters like Gross National Income (GNI) per capita, 
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita, life expectancy, agriculture land use, 
etc. The results indicated the need should continue to support initiatives to 
cover identified gaps, either geographic or thematic, to address plastic 
consumptions.

The pink stem borer, Sesamia cretica Lederer is considered as the main insect 
pest of maize and sugarcane worldwide. Reproductive and life table parameters of 
two populations of S. cretica were studied at 10 constant temperatures ranging 
from 12 to 36 (±1)°C, 50 ± 10% RH and a photoperiod of 0:24 (L:D) h for the 
larval stage and 16:8 (L:D) h for the other stages. At 12°C, no eggs hatched and 
at 15, 35, and 36°C only the incubation period was completed. The longest 
(135.81 and 156.49 d) and shortest (49.61 and 52.09 d) female life span were 
observed at 20 and 32°C for the Varamin and Rey populations, respectively. The 
highest (181.66 and 180.94 eggs/female) and lowest (13.40 and 32.85 eggs/female) 
total fecundity of the Varamin and Rey populations were found at 20°C and 34°C, 
respectively. At the same time, these two populations had the highest intrinsic 
rate of increase (r) (0.0343 and 0.0349 d-1) at 30 and 27°C, respectively. 
Similarly, both Varamin and Rey populations had the highest finite rate of 
increase (λ) at 27°C (1.0349 and 1.0355 d-1, respectively). It was found that 
the geographical populations of S. cretica were different in terms of the life 
table parameters at the same temperatures, and this issue can affect the results 
of forecasting studies. Accordingly, it is suggested that in the major 
corn-growing areas, a comprehensive study should be performed on different pest 
populations to address their commonalities and differences for future managing 
programs.

BACKGROUND: Adrenaline has been used as a treatment for cardiac arrest for many 
years, despite uncertainty about its effects on long-term outcomes and concerns 
that it may cause worse neurological outcomes.
OBJECTIVES: The objectives were to evaluate the effects of adrenaline on 
survival and neurological outcomes, and to assess the cost-effectiveness of 
adrenaline use.
DESIGN: This was a pragmatic, randomised, allocation-concealed, 
placebo-controlled, parallel-group superiority trial and economic evaluation. 
Costs are expressed in Great British pounds and reported in 2016/17 prices.
SETTING: This trial was set in five NHS ambulance services in England and Wales.
PARTICIPANTS: Adults treated for an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest were 
included. Patients were ineligible if they were pregnant, if they were aged < 16 
years, if the cardiac arrest had been caused by anaphylaxis or life-threatening 
asthma, or if adrenaline had already been given.
INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomised to either adrenaline (1 mg) or 
placebo in a 1 : 1 allocation ratio by the opening of allocation-concealed 
treatment packs.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was survival to 30 days. The 
secondary outcomes were survival to hospital admission, survival to hospital 
discharge, survival at 3, 6 and 12 months, neurological outcomes and 
health-related quality of life through to 6 months. The economic evaluation 
assessed the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained from the 
perspective of the NHS and Personal Social Services. Participants, clinical 
teams and those assessing patient outcomes were masked to the treatment 
allocation.
RESULTS: From December 2014 to October 2017, 8014 participants were assigned to 
the adrenaline (n = 4015) or to the placebo (n = 3999) arm. At 30 days, 130 out 
of 4012 participants (3.2%) in the adrenaline arm and 94 out of 3995 (2.4%) in 
the placebo arm were alive (adjusted odds ratio for survival 1.47, 95% 
confidence interval 1.09 to 1.97). For secondary outcomes, survival to hospital 
admission was higher for those receiving adrenaline than for those receiving 
placebo (23.6% vs. 8.0%; adjusted odds ratio 3.83, 95% confidence interval 3.30 
to 4.43). The rate of favourable neurological outcome at hospital discharge was 
not significantly different between the arms (2.2% vs. 1.9%; adjusted odds ratio 
1.19, 95% confidence interval 0.85 to 1.68). The pattern of improved survival 
but no significant improvement in neurological outcomes continued through to 6 
months. By 12 months, survival in the adrenaline arm was 2.7%, compared with 
2.0% in the placebo arm (adjusted odds ratio 1.38, 95% confidence interval 1.00 
to 1.92). An adjusted subgroup analysis did not identify significant 
interactions. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for adrenaline was 
estimated at £1,693,003 per quality-adjusted life-year gained over the first 6 
months after the cardiac arrest event and £81,070 per quality-adjusted life-year 
gained over the lifetime of survivors. Additional economic analyses estimated 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for adrenaline at £982,880 per percentage 
point increase in overall survival and £377,232 per percentage point increase in 
neurological outcomes over the first 6 months after the cardiac arrest.
LIMITATIONS: The estimate for survival with a favourable neurological outcome is 
imprecise because of the small numbers of patients surviving with a good 
outcome.
CONCLUSIONS: Adrenaline improved long-term survival, but there was no evidence 
that it significantly improved neurological outcomes. The incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio per quality-adjusted life-year exceeds the threshold of 
£20,000-30,000 per quality-adjusted life-year usually supported by the NHS.
FUTURE WORK: Further research is required to better understand patients' 
preferences in relation to survival and neurological outcomes after 
out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and to aid interpretation of the trial findings 
from a patient and public perspective.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN73485024 and EudraCT 
2014-000792-11.
FUNDING: This project was funded by the National Institute for Health Research 
(NIHR) Health Technology Assessment programme and will be published in full in 
Health Technology Assessment; Vol. 25, No. 25. See the NIHR Journals Library 
website for further project information.

Plain Language Summary: Cardiac arrest is a medical emergency that happens when 
the heart suddenly stops pumping effectively. When cardiac arrest happens, 
awareness is lost within seconds. If emergency treatment is not started quickly, 
the person will die. The first treatments of cardiac arrest involve pressing on 
the chest, giving rescue breaths and defibrillation (electric shocks applied to 
the heart). If these treatments do not work, ambulance paramedics use a drug 
called adrenaline to try to restart the heart. Although this treatment has been 
used for many years, some recent research suggests that it may cause more harm 
than good. In this research study, we compared the effects of giving adrenaline 
with the effects of not giving adrenaline to people who had a cardiac arrest in 
the community. The research showed that adrenaline was effective at restarting 
the heart, so more people survived long enough to be admitted to hospital. 
Thirty days later, 130 out of 4012 patients (3.2%) who received adrenaline and 
94 out of 3995 (2.4%) who did not receive adrenaline were alive. However, 
adrenaline did not improve the number of patients who went home from hospital 
having made a good recovery and were able to care for themselves. The evidence 
suggests that adrenaline represents a poor use of NHS funds on 
cost-effectiveness grounds. In a community survey, 95% of people who responded 
thought that long-term survival with good brain function was more important than 
just being alive. Further research exploring the opinions of patients and the 
public will help to understand the results of this research for the NHS.

BACKGROUND: Surgical options for breast cancer are numerous and span multiple 
surgical disciplines. Decision analyses aid surgeons in making the most 
cost-effective choice, thus reducing health care expenditure while maximizing 
patient outcome. In this study, we aimed to evaluate existing breast surgery 
cost-effectiveness literature against the Consolidated Health Economic 
Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) validated scoring system.
METHODS: A PRISMA search was performed for cost-effectiveness within breast 
surgery. Articles were scored with CHEERS criteria on a 0-24 scale and 
qualitative data were collected. Subgroup analysis was performed comparing 
pre-CHEERS (published in 2013 or earlier) and post-CHEERS (published in 2014 or 
later) cohorts. Chi-squared analysis was performed to compare where studies lost 
points between cohorts.
RESULTS: Of 2279 articles screened, 46 articles were included. The average 
CHEERS score was 18.18. Points were most often lost for characterizing 
heterogeneity, followed by discount rate, incremental costs and outcomes, and 
abstract. Quality-adjusted life year was the most commonly used health outcome, 
with visual model or analog scales as the most commonly used measure of 
effectiveness obtained primarily from surgeons or physicians. Most articles 
characterized uncertainty by deterministic sensitivity analysis, followed by 
both deterministic and probabilistic, then probabilistic. Average CHEERS scores 
were similar between pre- and post-CHEERS cohorts (17.67 vs. 18.40, P > .05) 
There were several significant differences in where articles lost points between 
pre- and post-CHEERS cohorts.
DISCUSSION: In order to standardize the reporting of results, cost-effectiveness 
studies in breast surgery should adhere to the current CHEERS criteria and aim 
to better characterize heterogeneity in their analyses.

The sustainable development of pension systems has been investigated from a 
financial perspective worldwide. However, the pension adequacy and its effect on 
the sustainability of a national pension system are still understudied. Using 
actual replacement rate and modified living standards replacement rate, this 
study empirically evaluates whether China's New Rural Pension Scheme (NRPS) 
grants enough livelihood protection for the rural residents in the Northwestern 
China. The results show that the NRPS fails to meet the basic needs of the 
elderly people (i.e., age of sixty years or older) or the middle-aged people 
(forty-five to fifty-nine years old), while it only provides limited protection 
for the young people (sixteen to forty-four years old). These findings suggest 
that the current NRPS benefits are very low in the Northwestern China and policy 
reforms should be further implemented to improve the sustainable development of 
the New Rural Pension Scheme.

BACKGROUND: Treatment of locally advanced rectal cancer with chemoradiotherapy, 
surgery, and adjuvant chemotherapy controls local disease, but distant 
metastases remain common. We aimed to assess whether administering neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy before preoperative chemoradiotherapy could reduce the risk of 
distant recurrences.
METHODS: We did a phase 3, open-label, multicentre, randomised trial at 35 
hospitals in France. Eligible patients were adults aged 18-75 years and had 
newly diagnosed, biopsy-proven, rectal adenocarcinoma staged cT3 or cT4 M0, with 
a WHO performance status of 0-1. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to either 
the neoadjuvant chemotherapy group or standard-of-care group, using an 
independent web-based system by minimisation method stratified by centre, 
extramural extension of the tumour into perirectal fat according to MRI, tumour 
location, and stage. Investigators and participants were not masked to treatment 
allocation. The neoadjuvant chemotherapy group received neoadjuvant chemotherapy 
with FOLFIRINOX (oxaliplatin 85 mg/m2, irinotecan 180 mg/m2, leucovorin 400 
mg/m2, and fluorouracil 2400 mg/m2 intravenously every 14 days for 6 cycles), 
chemoradiotherapy (50 Gy during 5 weeks and 800 mg/m2 concurrent oral 
capecitabine twice daily for 5 days per week), total mesorectal excision, and 
adjuvant chemotherapy (3 months of modified FOLFOX6 [intravenous oxaliplatin 85 
mg/m2 and leucovorin 400 mg/m2, followed by intravenous 400 mg/m2 fluorouracil 
bolus and then continuous infusion at a dose of 2400 mg/m2 over 46 h every 14 
days for six cycles] or capecitabine [1250 mg/m2 orally twice daily on days 1-14 
every 21 days]). The standard-of-care group received chemoradiotherapy, total 
mesorectal excision, and adjuvant chemotherapy (for 6 months). The primary 
endpoint was disease-free survival assessed in the intention-to-treat population 
at 3 years. Safety analyses were done on treated patients. This trial was 
registered with EudraCT (2011-004406-25) and ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01804790) 
and is now complete.
FINDINGS: Between June 5, 2012, and June 26, 2017, 461 patients were randomly 
assigned to either the neoadjuvant chemotherapy group (n=231) or the 
standard-of-care group (n=230). At a median follow-up of 46·5 months (IQR 
35·4-61·6), 3-year disease-free survival rates were 76% (95% CI 69-81) in the 
neoadjuvant chemotherapy group and 69% (62-74) in the standard-of-care group 
(stratified hazard ratio 0·69, 95% CI 0·49-0·97; p=0·034). During neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy, the most common grade 3-4 adverse events were neutropenia (38 
[17%] of 225 patients) and diarrhoea (25 [11%] of 226). During 
chemoradiotherapy, the most common grade 3-4 adverse event was lymphopenia (59 
[28%] of 212 in the neoadjuvant chemotherapy group vs 67 [30%] of 226 patients 
in the standard-of-care group). During adjuvant chemotherapy, the most common 
grade 3-4 adverse events were lymphopenia (18 [11%] of 161 in the neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy group vs 42 [27%] of 155 in the standard-of-care group), 
neutropenia (nine [6%] of 161 vs 28 [18%] of 155), and peripheral sensory 
neuropathy (19 [12%] of 162 vs 32 [21%] of 155). Serious adverse events occurred 
in 63 (27%) of 231 participants in the neoadjuvant chemotherapy group and 50 
(22%) of 230 patients in the standard-of-care group (p=0·167), during the whole 
treatment period. During adjuvant therapy, serious adverse events occurred in 18 
(11%) of 163 participants in the neoadjuvant chemotherapy group and 36 (23%) of 
158 patients in the standard-of-care group (p=0·0049). Treatment-related deaths 
occurred in one (<1%) of 226 patients in the neoadjuvant chemotherapy group 
(sudden death) and two (1%) of 227 patients in the standard-of-care group (one 
sudden death and one myocardial infarction).
INTERPRETATION: Intensification of chemotherapy using FOLFIRINOX before 
preoperative chemoradiotherapy significantly improved outcomes compared with 
preoperative chemoradiotherapy in patients with cT3 or cT4 M0 rectal cancer. The 
significantly improved disease-free survival in the neoadjuvant chemotherapy 
group and the decreased neurotoxicity indicates that the perioperative approach 
is more efficient and better tolerated than adjuvant chemotherapy. Therefore, 
the PRODIGE 23 results might change clinical practice.

The disproportionate evolutionary expansion of the human cerebral cortex with 
reinforcement of cholinergic innervations warranted a major rise in the 
functional and metabolic load of the conserved basal forebrain (BF) cholinergic 
system. Given that acetylcholine (ACh) regulates properties of the 
microtubule-associated protein (MAP) tau and promotes non-amyloidogenic 
processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP), growing neocortex predicts higher 
demands for ACh, while the emerging role of BF cholinergic projections in Aβ 
clearance infers greater exposure of source neurons and their innervation fields 
to amyloid pathology. The higher exposure of evolutionary most recent cortical 
areas to the amyloid pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) with synaptic 
impairments and atrophy, therefore, might involve attenuated homeostatic effects 
of BF cholinergic projections, in addition to fall-outs of inherent processes of 
expanding association areas. This unifying model, thus, views amyloid pathology 
and loss of cholinergic cells as a quid pro quo of the allometric evolution of 
the human brain, which in combination with increase in life expectancy overwhelm 
the fine homeostatic balance and trigger the disease process.

Schizophrenia is associated with a weighted average of 14.5 years of potential 
life lost according to a recent meta-analysis. This is partly explained by high 
rates of suicide and a high prevalence of non-psychiatric comorbidity 
(cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, cancers…). However, all these causes could 
not fully explain the loss of life expectancy in people suffering from 
schizophrenia. Life expectancy has been strongly correlated with telomere length 
(TL). Telomeres are noncoding structures consisting of DNA TTAGGG tandem repeats 
and associated proteins located at the end of the chromosomes. Their role is to 
help preserve genome stability by protecting chromosomal ends from the loss of 
genetic material. The progressive loss of telomeric material during cell 
divisions has led researchers to consider telomeres as molecular clocks that 
measure the number of divisions left until cellular death. The fact that both 
shorter telomeres and schizophrenia have been associated with a decrease in life 
expectancy has fueled the interest in the study of TL in schizophrenia. In this 
article, after a detailed review of the literature on the relationships between 
telomere length and schizophrenia, we discuss the different pathophysiological 
mechanisms which might explain this association. Based on this analysis, in the 
last part of the article we discuss potential research, therapeutic and 
prevention prospects. To date, the majority of the studies and meta-analyses 
found a decrease in TL in subjects with schizophrenia compared to control 
subjects. Conversely, all the studies exploring the TL in subjects suffering 
from first episode psychosis (FEP) have shown no significant difference from TL 
in control subjects. This suggests that excessive shortening of telomeres occurs 
during the course of the disease, thus it seems more probable that schizophrenia 
(or processes associated with it) affects TL rather than telomere erosion being 
a cause of the disorder. Several pathophysiological, non-mutually exclusive 
mechanisms have been proposed to explain the observed data. A first hypothesis 
to explain the acceleration of the physiological process of telomere erosion in 
schizophrenia is the activation of inflammation processes and oxidative stress 
as a consequence of schizophrenia per se. However, it seems more probable that 
reduced TL may be a result of cumulative exposure to chronic stress related to 
schizophrenia. Indeed, in healthy individuals a growing body of evidence has 
linked chronic stress to accelerated shortening of TL. This might explain why 
telomere erosion is too small to be detected in FEP patients who are younger and 
have a shorter duration of illness than subjects with schizophrenia. Based on 
these both explanations, telomere alterations may be considered as a biomarker 
of illness progression and might be useful for illness staging. Identifying 
processes associated with TL reduction might improve our understanding of the 
increased mortality and morbidity in schizophrenia, improve reliability of 
diagnosis, and hopefully suggest means for prevention and/or treatment. 
Treatments that prevent exposure and/or vulnerability to stressful life events 
that ameliorate schizophrenia may also prevent or decelerate telomere erosion. 
In this perspective, engaging subjects suffering from schizophrenia in a healthy 
diet and regular activity could be both promising strategies to protect telomere 
maintenance and improve health span at old age. In addition, the inflammatory 
process and oxidative stress involved in the physiopathology in at least a 
subgroup of subjects with schizophrenia could also be responsible for telomere 
erosion. Thus, an efficient anti-inflammatory therapeutic approach that targets 
these specific pathways could be of interest in this subgroup to limit telomere 
erosion. Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) therapies have been shown to 
reduce telomere erosion by increasing telomerase activity, although these 
psychological therapies should be used carefully in psychosis. Finally, 
advancing our understanding of the relationship between stress, inflammation and 
TL is of great interest for psychiatric research and for understanding stress 
effects in this population.

INTRODUCTION: In France, the cystic fibrosis (CF) care pathway is performed in 
45 CF centers, the life expectancy of patients has steadily increased, but to 
date there are no national recommendations for the transition from pediatric to 
adult care. The transition to an adult CF center still raises questions about 
the relevance of its organizational arrangements. The "SAFETIM need" study aimed 
to identify the organizational needs both of patients and of parents before the 
transfer to an adult CF center.
METHODS: This was a prospective, observational, multicenter study conducted 
between July 2017 and December 2018, involving the three CF centers of a 
regional network in southeastern France. Each adolescent registered with the 
center and his or her parents were interviewed individually, on the same day, 
during the 6 months leading up to transfer. They participated in semi-structured 
interviews during one of their routine consultations at the CF center. The 
interview manual, based on literature reviews and targeting national 
recommendations, was tested and validated by the national CF therapeutic 
education group (GETheM). All interviews were transcribed and checked by two 
different people, and analyzed by two researchers individually. The results were 
classified by topic according to content categorization.
RESULTS: Overall, 43 adolescents and 41 parents were interviewed, respectively, 
who were followed up by CF centers: 14% (n=6) in a mixed CF center (pediatric 
and adult); 19% (n=8) and 67% (n=29), respectively, in two different pediatric 
CF centers. Adolescents were between 16 and 19 years old. For adolescents, the 
average interview time was 5.11min. (standard deviation [SD]: 3.8min; minimum: 
2.53min; maximum: 17.14min). For parents, the average interview time was 7.99min 
(SD: 3.56min, minimum: 3.43min; maximum: 22.50min).
DISCUSSION: Our study enquired only about the preparation and organization of 
the transfer. We identified three areas of actions matching the needs of 
adolescents and parents before transfer. The first one is to anticipate team 
change to prepare follow-up in their future CF center: acquire new skills, 
consider the future CF center according to the adolescent's curriculum, be 
involved in the transition process. The second area is to accompany the upcoming 
change. The care team could help by providing information and support during the 
start of teenagers' transition toward autonomy. And parents were aware that the 
CF center change will reverse roles. They must provide their own knowledge and 
manage the ambivalence of this as well as letting go. The third one is to 
announce the transition process and functioning of the future adult CF center, 
because the transition would require time to find their place (patients and 
parents) with the new team.
CONCLUSION: The "SAFETIM needs" pre-transfer study results show that we can 
identify the main criteria to be developed and strengthened, to promote a 
smooth, high-quality transition from pediatric to adult CF care for patients in 
France. For most patients, the transition cannot be prepared at the last minute. 
Caregivers need to develop specific skills in adolescent and young adult care 
and follow-up. Each team must consider the transition as a normal part of the 
patient care cycle. While it must be structured, some flexibility must be 
allowed so as to give everyone the chance to be prepared and to personalize the 
care.

About 70-80% of early breast cancer (BC) patients receive adjuvant endocrine 
therapy (ET) for at least 5 years. ET includes in the majority of cases the use 
of aromatase inhibitors, as upfront or switch strategy, that lead to impaired 
bone health. Given the high incidence and also the high prevalence of BC, cancer 
treatment-induced bone loss (CTIBL) represents the most common long-term adverse 
event experimented by patients with hormone receptor positive tumours. CTIBL is 
responsible for osteoporosis occurrence and, as a consequence, fragility 
fractures that may negatively affect quality of life and survival expectancy. As 
recommended by main international guidelines, BC women on aromatase inhibitors 
should be carefully assessed for their fracture risk at baseline and 
periodically reassessed during adjuvant ET in order to early detect significant 
worsening in terms of bone health. Antiresorptive agents, together with adequate 
intake of calcium and vitamin D, should be administered in BC patients during 
all course of ET, especially in those at high risk of osteoporotic fractures, as 
calculated by tools available for clinicians. Bisphosphonates, such as 
zoledronate or pamidronate, and anti-RANKL antibody, denosumab, are the two 
classes of antiresorptive drugs used in clinical practice with similar efficacy 
in preventing bone loss induced by aromatase inhibitor therapy. The choice 
between them, in the absence of direct comparison, should be based on patients' 
preference and compliance; the different safety profile is mainly related to the 
route of administration, although both types of drugs are manageable with due 
care, since most of the adverse events are predictable and preventable. Despite 
advances in management of CTIBL, several issues such as the optimal time of 
starting antiresorptive agents and the duration of treatment remain unanswered. 
Future clinical trials as well as increased awareness of bone health are needed 
to improve prevention, assessment and treatment of CTIBL in these long-term 
survivor patients.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to analyse longitudinal development of 
prognostic awareness in advanced cancer patients and their families.
METHODS: This was a longitudinal cohort study, involving 134 adult cancer 
patients, 91 primary family caregivers and 21 treating oncologists. Key 
eligibility criterion for patients was life expectancy less than 1 year 
(estimated by their oncologists using the 12-month surprised question). 
Structured interviews, including tools to measure prognostic awareness, health 
information needs, and demographics were conducted face to face or via phone 
three times over 9 months. Forty-four patients completed all three phases of 
data collection.
RESULTS: Only 16% of patients reported accurate prognostic awareness, 58% being 
partially aware. Prognostic awareness of both patients and family caregivers 
remained stable over the course of the study, with only small non-significant 
changes. Gender, education, type of cancer, spirituality or health information 
needs were not associated with the level of prognostic awareness. Family 
caregivers reported more accurate prognostic awareness, which was not associated 
with patients' own prognostic awareness (agreement rate 59%, weighted kappa 
0.348, CI = 0.185-0.510).
CONCLUSIONS: Prognostic awareness appears to be a stable concept over the course 
of the illness. Clinicians must focus on the initial patients' understanding of 
the disease and be able to communicate the prognostic information effectively 
from the early stages of patients' trajectory.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a serious public health problem and its 
prevalence is growing in many countries, often related to issues resulting from 
the lifestyle in growing economies and the population's life expectancy. 
Nutritional therapy is a beneficial but still neglected strategy for preventing 
CKD and delaying disease progression. The aim of this study was to assess the 
association of dietary patterns with CKD development and progression. 
Observational studies conducted in adult humans and the correlation between the 
adopted dietary pattern and prevalent and incident cases of CKD were assessed. A 
significant association was observed between unhealthy dietary patterns and an 
increased risk of developing or worsening CKD, as well as an adverse effect. 
Whereas healthy eating patterns characterized by the consumption of fruit, 
vegetables and dietary fibre showed nephroprotective outcomes.
