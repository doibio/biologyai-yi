to ambient PM2.5 increased by 85.9% (APC: 2.21% [2.15, 2.27]), while 
HAP-associated ASDR decreased by 37.9% (APC: - 1.66% [- 1.82, - 1.50]). We 
observed a negative correlation between SDI and APC in ASMR (rs =  - 0.5, 
p < 0.001) and ASDR (rs = -0.4, p < 0.001) among 204 countries and territories. 
HAP-related diabetes experienced a sharp decline during 1990-2019, while global 
burden of diabetes attributable to ambient PM2.5 was rising rapidly. The elderly 
and people in low-SDI countries suffered from the greatest burden of diabetes 
due to PM2.5 pollution. More targeted interventions should be taken by 
governments to reduce PM2.5 exposure and related diabetes burden.

An issue that has not yet been explored in the religiosity-health literature is 
the macro-level effect of religiosity on health-the effect of the religiosity of 
a society on the absolute health of the population of that society as a whole. 
We address this issue using two panel datasets: The first is a time-series 
cross-sectional panel dataset for 17 countries from 1925 to 2000. The second is 
a cross-sectionally dominated panel dataset of up to 92 countries for the period 
1981-2016. Our main findings are as follows: first, religiosity has a 
significant negative causal effect on health at the macro level; second, a 
substantial part of this effect can be attributed to an indirect effect via 
public health expenditures; and third, changes in population health do not cause 
significant changes in societal religiosity.

BACKGROUND: Surgical pathologies contribute to a huge portion of the global 
burden of diseases. Surgical needs therefore remain high and is projected to 
increase even further in the near future with increasing life expectancy and 
comorbidities, given the projection that 16% of the world's population will be 
older than 65 years by 2050. The outcome of patients with surgical pathologies 
could be influenced by several factors. Key amongst them is the quality of care. 
Mortality as an outcome is one metric that could be used to assess the quality 
of surgical care in a health facility, hence this study with the objective of 
determining the pattern of inpatient mortality in our surgical wards and 
suggesting possible ways of addressing identified gaps in their care delivery, 
which may also improve the care in other centers.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of surgical inpatients' 
mortality in the surgical wards of Ahmadu Bello university teaching hospital 
from January 1st 2016 to December 31st 2019. Data was analyzed using the 
Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 20.0, and presented 
as descriptive statistics.
RESULTS: A total of 8862 admissions were made into the surgical wards, with 655 
deaths, giving a crude mortality rate of 7.4%. Most of the deaths occurred in 
patients in the 46-60 years age group (217, 33.1%). Malignancy was the commonest 
surgical condition, 294 (48.7%, n=604). This was followed by trauma-related 
conditions, 96 (15.9%, n=604). Civil gunshot injury admissions showed an upward 
trend from 19 in 2017, with an exponential rise to 45 in 2019.
CONCLUSION: Although malignancy- related deaths predominated amongst our 
surgical inpatients, the incidences of deaths from road traffic and burns 
injuries, as well as septic surgical conditions are also worrisomely high. There 
is a rise in civil gunshot- related injury admissions and deaths.

Publisher: CONTEXTE: Les pathologies chirurgicales contribuent à une part énorme 
du fardeau mondial des maladies. Les besoins chirurgicaux restent donc élevés et 
devraient encore augmenter dans un avenir proche avec l’augmentation de 
l’espérance de vie et des comorbidités que 16 % de la population mondiale aura 
plus de 65 ans en 2050. L’issue des patients atteints de pathologies 
chirurgicales peut être influencé par plusieurs facteurs. Parmi ceux-ci, la 
qualité des soins. La mortalité en tant que résultat est une mesure qui pourrait 
être utilisée pour évaluer la qualité des soins chirurgicaux dans un 
établissement de santé. Cette étude a pour objectif de déterminer le modèle de 
mortalité des patients hospitalisés dans nos services de chirurgie et de 
suggérer des solutions possibles de remédier aux les lacunes identifiées dans 
leur prestation de soins, ce qui pourrait également améliorer les soins dans 
d’autres centres.
PATIENTS ET MÉTHODES: Une étude de cohorte rétrospective de la mortalité des 
patients hospitalisés en chirurgie dans les services de chirurgie de l’hôpital 
universitaire d’Ahmadu Bello Ahmadu Bello, du 1er janvier 2016 au 31 décembre 
2019. Les données ont été analysées en utilisant la version 20.0 du progiciel de 
statistiques pour les Sciences (SPSS) et présentées sous forme de statistiques 
descriptives.
RÉSULTATS: Un total de 8862 admissions ont été faites dans les services de 
chirurgie, avec 655 décès., soit un taux de mortalité brut de 7,4 %. La plupart 
des décès sont survenus chez des patients de la tranche d’âge 46-60 ans (217, 
33.1%). La malignité était l’affection chirurgicale la plus fréquente, 294 
(48.7%, n=604). Elle était suivie par les affections liées à un traumatisme, 96 
(15.9%, n=604). Les admissions civiles pour blessure par balle ont connu une 
tendance à la hausse, passant de 19 en 2017, avec une augmentation exponentielle 
à 45 en 2019.
CONCLUSION: Bien que les décès liés à la malignité aient prédominé prédominaient 
parmi nos patients hospitalisés en chirurgie, l’incidence des décès dus aux de 
la circulation routière et des brûlures, ainsi que des états chirurgicaux 
septiques sont également inquiétantes. Il y a une augmentation des admissions et 
des décès liés à des blessures civiles par balle.
MOTS-CLÉS: Mortalité chirurgicale, Décès liés à un traumatisme, Décès liés à une 
arme à feu.

PURPOSE: It is well studied that physical function and social background affect 
the quality of life (QoL) of cancer patients. However, differences in QoL by age 
and factors affecting health state utility values (HSUV) of patients with 
hematological malignancies have not yet been sufficiently investigated. Our aim 
is to investigate the factors that affect QoL and HSUV in such patients.
METHODS: A total of 32 patients with hematological malignancies on outpatient 
chemotherapy were included. QoL and HSUV were evaluated using the EuroQol-5 
Dimension 5-level (EQ-5D-5L). Physical function was assessed using grip 
strength, knee extension strength, 6-min walking distance, and Short Physical 
Performance Battery (SPPB). Fatigue was assessed using Brief Fatigue Inventory 
(BFI), and nutritional status was assessed using Mini Nutritional 
Assessment-Short Form (MNA-SF).
RESULTS: In the EQ-5D-5L, a high percentage of the patients were aware of 
mobility problems and pain/discomfort, and mobility problems were more common in 
the older-aged group (≥ 65 years old, n = 16) than in the middle-aged group 
(< 65 years old, n = 16). In addition, the older-aged group showed lower HSUV 
and physical function. SPPB (β = 0.38, p < 0.01), BFI (β =  - 0.58, p < 0.01), 
and MNA-SF (β = 0.29, p = 0.02) were independent factors affecting HSUV 
(adjusted R2 = 0.65, p < 0.01). BFI was correlated with HSUV in both older and 
middle-aged groups.
CONCLUSION: Comprehensive supports, to improve lower extremity function, 
fatigue, and nutritional status, are required to augment QoL and HSUV in 
patients with hematological malignancies.

Influential factors of socio-economic and air pollution on life expectancy (LE) 
show complexity. The investigations of non-linear functions of LE, 
socio-economic, and air pollution factors have not been largely conducted, and 
spatial and temporal differences of the linear or non-linear relations between 
LE and the influential factors have been obscured across countries in the world. 
In this study, the non-linear relations between LE and factors of per capita 
gross national income (GNIpc), urban population rate (UPR), and fine-particulate 
(PM2.5) were estimated from 2000 to 2015 by using a generalized additive model 
(GAM). The collected data included the 219 countries and regions with sufficient 
data and covers the period 2000-2015. The results demonstrate that at the global 
level, the GNIpc plays a stable and significant non-linear role in LE, while the 
non-linear relationships between UPR, PM2.5, and LE are not significant. The 
temporal variation was further investigated that the non-linear effect of PM2.5 
on LE is gradually strengthened, and the non-linear effect of UPR on LE shows a 
weakened trend. However, GNIpc always plays a significantly non-linear role in 
the LE level. Furthermore, the spatial difference in the non-linear relations 
among different continents is detected. In sum, it cannot be ignored the 
non-linear effects of socio-economic and air pollution factors on LE at a global 
scale and across different continents.

BACKGROUND: Immunotherapies have shown clinical activity in patients with 
advanced biliary tract cancer, for which outcomes remain poor despite standard 
of care treatment with gemcitabine and cisplatin. We aimed to evaluate 
gemcitabine and cisplatin plus durvalumab with or without tremelimumab as 
first-line treatment in patients with advanced biliary tract cancer.
METHODS: This open-label, single-centre, phase 2 study was conducted at Seoul 
National University Hospital. Eligible patients were treatment-naïve adults aged 
18 years or older with histologically proven unresectable or recurrent biliary 
tract cancer, at least one measurable lesion based on the Response Evaluation 
Criteria in Solid Tumors (version 1.1), an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 
performance status of 0 or 1, life expectancy of 12 weeks or longer, and 
adequate healthy organ and bone marrow function. Initially, all patients 
received one 3-week cycle of gemcitabine (1000 mg/m2) and cisplatin (25 mg/m2) 
on day 1 and 8 followed by gemcitabine and cisplatin plus durvalumab (1120 mg) 
and tremelimumab (75 mg) on day 1 of each cycle, starting with the second cycle 
(chemotherapy followed by chemotherapy plus durvalumab and tremelimumab group). 
Following protocol amendment, patients were recruited to receive gemcitabine and 
cisplatin plus durvalumab, starting on day 1 of the first cycle (chemotherapy 
plus durvalumab group) or gemcitabine and cisplatin plus durvalumab and 
tremelimumab also from day 1 of the first cycle (chemotherapy plus durvalumab 
and tremelimumab group) in parallel and allocated using a random block method. 
Assessors and patients were not masked to the treatment group. The primary 
endpoint was objective response rate, assessed in the efficacy population (ie, 
patients who were treated at least until the first tumour response assessment). 
This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03046862 (active).
FINDINGS: Between March 2, 2017, and Feb 13, 2020, 128 patients were enrolled 
(32 in the chemotherapy followed by chemotherapy plus durvalumab and 
tremelimumab group, 49 in the chemotherapy plus durvalumab group, and 47 in the 
chemotherapy plus durvalumab and tremelimumab group). Four patients (two in the 
chemotherapy followed by chemotherapy plus durvalumab and tremelimumab group and 
two in the chemotherapy plus durvalumab group) were excluded and 124 were 
evaluable for tumour response. The median duration of follow-up was 48·2 months 
(IQR 41·5-49·4) for the chemotherapy followed by chemotherapy plus durvalumab 
and tremelimumab group, 26·6 months (19·0-27·9) for the chemotherapy plus 
durvalumab group, and 24·2 months (20·7-31·7) for the chemotherapy plus 
durvalumab and tremelimumab group. 82 (66%) of 124 patients achieved an 
objective response (15 [50%] of 30 in the chemotherapy followed by chemotherapy 
plus durvalumab and tremelimumab group, 34 [72%] of 47 in the chemotherapy plus 
durvalumab group, and 33 [70%] of 47 in the chemotherapy plus durvalumab and 
tremelimumab group). The most common grade 3 and 4 adverse events were decreased 
neutrophil count (67 [53%] of 126), anaemia (50 [40%]), and decreased platelet 
count (24 [19%]), with no unexpected safety events. No adverse events leading to 
discontinuation or death occurred.
INTERPRETATION: Gemcitabine and cisplatin plus immunotherapy showed promising 
efficacy and acceptable safety in patients with biliary tract cancer. 
Gemcitabine and cisplatin plus durvalumab are being evaluated in the phase 3, 
TOPAZ-1 study (NCT03875235) as first-line treatment in patients with advanced 
biliary tract cancer.

Mechanical thrombectomy (MT) has been established as a standard of care for 
patients with acute ischemic stroke for the past five years. However, the direct 
benefits of this treatment in patients with baseline disability remains unclear. 
This study aims to elucidate the cost impact of performing MT on patients with 
moderate-to-severe baseline disability to work towards an optimized system of 
care for acute ischemic stroke. We developed a Markov economic model with a 
life-time horizon analysis of costs associated with mechanical thrombectomy in 
patients grouped on baseline disability as defined by modified Rankin Score. Our 
clinical and economic data is based on an American payer perspective. Our 
results identified a marginal cost-effective ratio (mCER) of $18,835.00 per 
quality-adjusted life year (QALY) when mechanical thrombectomy is reserved as a 
treatment only for patients with no-to-minimal baseline disability as compared 
to those with any level of baseline disability. Our results provide a framework 
for these future studies and highlight key sectors that drive cost in the 
surgical treatment and life-long care of patients with acute ischemic stroke.

A case report of surgical treatment of traumatic drop hand by quadruple tendons 
transfer.

INTRODUCTION: Drop hand is the case of inability to dorsiflexion of the hand and 
fingers according to radial nerve palsy (complete syndrome) or PIN (Posterior 
Interosseous Nerve) palsy (partial syndrome). Therefore, the patient loses part 
of the normal function of his/her hand causing life problems especially if it is 
the dominant hand. Tendon transfer is the main surgical treatment.
CASE REPORT: We present a case of a young male who sustained multiple traumatic 
war injuries especially in the left upper limb; open humerus fracture, open ulna 
fracture, open radius fracture with a clear drop hand syndrome. After quadruple 
tendons transfer, he got a very good result especially in thumb movements with 
good ROM (Range Of Motions) in the wrist.
DISCUSSION: Since it is difficult to restore full ROM and full muscular strength 
in the wrist and fingers of a drop hand with triple tendon transfer routinely, 
especially in the case of multiple injury to the upper extremity with the 
pronator teres being nonfunctional, we decided to perform quadruple tendon 
transfer depending on the tendons; FCR, PL, 3rdFDS, 4thFDS for stronger 
extension of the wrist, thumb, and other fingers.
CONCLUSION: Our aim here is to confirm that the drop hand does not have standard 
findings in all cases. It may be a challenge, and may have atypical findings 
especially in the case of ipsilateral multiple traumatic limb, which in turn may 
have weakness or restriction in some important movements, so, it is important to 
keep in mind alternatives of tendon transfer.

BACKGROUND: Life expectancy has increased over the last century and a growing 
number of people is reaching age 90 years and over. However, data on 
nonagenarians' health trends are scarce due to difficulties in investigating 
this specific population. This study aims to identify risk factors for one-year 
mortality in nonagenarians using data collected within the "Mugello Study".
METHODS: Complete information on sociodemographic data, cognitive and functional 
status, lifestyle, medical history, and drug use was collected from 433 
nonagenarians, as well as information about survival after 1 year from the 
interview.
RESULTS: The sample included 314 women (72.5%) and 119 men (27.5%) with a median 
age of 92 years (range 90-99 years). The mortality rate was 20.3% (88 deaths). 
After adjustment for age and sex, a significantly higher risk of dying within 
12 months was observed in individuals with more severe cognitive impairment 
(HR = 5.011, p < 0.001), more severe disability in basic activities of daily 
living (HR = 4.193, p < 0.001), sedentary lifestyle (HR = 3.367, p < 0.001), 
higher number of drugs assumed (HR = 1.118, p = 0.031), and kidney dysfunction 
(HR = 2.609, p = 0.004). When all the variables were included in the analysis, 
only older age (HR = 1.079, p = 0.048), lower cognitive function (HR = 2.859, 
p = 0.015), sedentary lifestyle (HR = 2.030, p = 0.026), and kidney dysfunction 
(HR = 2.322, p = 0.018) remained significantly associated with reduced survival.
CONCLUSIONS: Data from the Mugello study support the hypothesis that survival at 
12 months in nonagenarians is not a stochastic process and that older age, 
reduced cognitive function, sedentary lifestyle, and the presence of kidney 
dysfunction are associated with mortality.

BACKGROUND: Suicidal behavior among pregnant mothers is one of the most common 
psychiatric emergencies that require a major public health concern by 
researchers and mental health task forces. Pregnant mothers experience suicidal 
attempt, which is a fatal problem to end life. Therefore, there was a need to 
assess the prevalence and associated factors of suicidal behavior among pregnant 
mothers to integrate mental health care, particularly suicide, with maternal 
management.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 504 pregnant mothers in the 
Gedeo zone, southern Ethiopia. Suicidal behavior was assessed using revised 
suicidal behavior questionnaire (SBQ-R) with a total score of 3-18; those 
scoring ≥7 were considered as having Suicidal behavior. Data were entered into 
Epi-data 3.1 and analyzed using SPSS version 20. Bivariate and multivariate 
binary logistic regression analysis was performed to identify associated factors 
of suicidal behavior. Variables with a P-value less than 0.05 with 95% CI were 
considered statistically significant.
RESULTS: In this study, the overall prevalence of suicidal behavior among 
pregnant mothers was 47(9.3%) with 95% CI (7.1- 11.9). Regarding the factors; 
being unmarried [AOR = 5.69, 95% CI, (1.19, 27.23)], gestation age greater than 
27 weeks, [AOR = 4.92, 95% CI (1.67, 14.53)], history of having chronic medical 
illness [AOR = 4.47, 95% CI (1.35, 14.85)], depression [AOR = 4.20, 95% CI 
(1.90, 9.28], and intimate partner violence [AOR = 7.60, 95% CI (3.27, 17.67)] 
were significantly associated with suicidal behavior at P value less than 0.05 
and corresponding 95% CI.
CONCLUSION: Pregnant mothers in the community had a high prevalence of suicidal 
behavior compared to studies conducted among general populations. It is better 
to include and implement the assessment of suicidal risk factors as a primary 
treatment package for pregnant mothers, training of health extension workers and 
other primary health workers on how to assess the risk of suicide among pregnant 
mothers is warranted.

BACKGROUND: Cardiosphere-derived cells (CDCs) ameliorate skeletal and cardiac 
muscle deterioration in experimental models of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. The 
HOPE-2 trial examined the safety and efficacy of sequential intravenous 
infusions of human allogeneic CDCs in late-stage Duchenne muscular dystrophy.
METHODS: In this multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
phase 2 trial, patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, aged 10 years or older 
with moderate upper limb impairment, were enrolled at seven centres in the USA. 
Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) using stratified permuted blocks to 
receive CAP-1002 (1·5 × 108 CDCs) or placebo intravenously every 3 months for a 
total of four infusions. Clinicians, caregivers, patients, and clinical 
operations personnel were fully masked to treatment groups. The primary outcome 
was the change in mid-level elbow Performance of Upper Limb version 1.2 (PUL 
1.2) score at 12 months, assessed in the intention-to-treat population. Safety 
was assessed in all individuals who received an investigational product. This 
trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03406780.
FINDINGS: Between March 1, 2018, and March 31, 2020, 26 male patients with 
Duchenne muscular dystrophy were enrolled, of whom eight were randomly assigned 
to the CAP-1002 group and 12 to the placebo group (six were not randomised due 
to screening failure). In patients who had a post-treatment PUL 1.2 assessment 
(eight in the CAP-1002 group and 11 in the placebo group), the mean 12-month 
change from baseline in mid-level elbow PUL1.2 favoured CAP-1002 over placebo 
(percentile difference 36·2, 95% CI 12·7-59·7; difference of 2·6 points; 
p=0·014). Infusion-related hypersensitivity reactions without long-term sequelae 
were observed in three patients, with one patient discontinuing therapy due to a 
severe allergic reaction. No other major adverse reactions were noted, and no 
deaths occurred.
INTERPRETATION: CAP-1002 cell therapy appears to be safe and effective in 
reducing deterioration of upper limb function in patients with late-stage 
Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Various measures of cardiac function and structure 
were also improved in the CAP-1002 group compared with the placebo group. 
Longer-term extension studies are needed to confirm the therapeutic durability 
and safety of CAP-1002 beyond 12 months for the treatment of skeletal myopathy 
and cardiomyopathy in Duchenne muscular dystrophy.

In this study pomegranate peel extract was evaluated as source of antioxidant 
encapsulated by nano-emulsions in soybean oil. Encapsulating agents maltodextrin 
(MD), whey proteins isolate (WPI) and complex of maltodextrin and whey protein 
isolate (MD/WPI) (1:1) were used as wall material. Average droplet size of 
primary W/O and double W/O/W nanoemulsions stabilised by MD, WPI and MD/WPI were 
108 nm, 157.82,189.94 nm and 191.12 nm respectively. Lyophilised nanoemulsion 
powders were added at 100, 200 and 300 ppm concentration to soyabean and mustard 
oil and observed for change in various oxidative stability indices during 
storage and were compared to non-encapsulated extract and synthetic antioxidant 
BHT. From the results, it can be suggested that nanoencapsulated extract at 
300 ppm concentration performed better in controlling oxidative changes in both 
oils than unencapsulated and synthetic one, however, extract encapsulated by 
MD/WPI exhibited higher antioxidant effects due to controlled release of 
bioactive compounds.

INTRODUCTION: Given the relatively short life expectancy of patients with 
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), quality of life (QOL) plays a significant role 
in treatment selection. This analysis aimed to compare time to deterioration 
(TTD) in QOL with transarterial radioembolization (TARE) and 
atezolizumab-bevacizumab, as well as sorafenib, in advanced and unresectable 
HCC.
METHODS: Patient-level data from SARAH (TARE using SIR-Spheres® Y-90 resin 
microspheres [SIR-Spheres] versus sorafenib) and aggregate data from IMbrave150 
(atezolizumab-bevacizumab versus sorafenib) randomized controlled trials were 
used to conduct an anchored matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC). 
Patients with a Child-Pugh score B in SARAH were excluded to align with 
exclusion criteria in IMbrave150. To identify potential effect modifiers for 
adjustment, the literature was searched and multivariate Cox proportional 
hazards models were implemented using SARAH data. Patients from SARAH were then 
weighted to balance with baseline characteristics from IMbrave150. Median TTD in 
QOL and hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated.
RESULTS: Four potential effect modifiers were identified and used for 
adjustment: cause of disease (viral/non-viral), macrovascular invasion, Eastern 
Cooperative Oncology Group performance score, and alpha-fetoprotein level. The 
MAIC included 217 patients from SARAH (TARE = 94; sorafenib = 123). Median TTD 
in QOL was 11.23 and 8.64 months for atezolizumab-bevacizumab and TARE, 
respectively (HR = 1.06; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.75-1.50; p = 0.725). A 
sensitivity analysis was conducted adjusting for cause of disease defined as 
hepatitis B/hepatitis C/non-viral: median TTD in QOL was higher for TARE 
compared with atezolizumab-bevacizumab (19.88 vs 11.23 months; HR = 0.66; 95% CI 
0.36-1.19; p = 0.163). Sorafenib resulted in the shortest TTD in QOL, with 
statistically significant differences in both base case and sensitivity 
analyses.
CONCLUSION: TARE using SIR-Spheres may achieve similar TTD in QOL compared with 
atezolizumab-bevacizumab, as the analyses found no statistically significant 
differences between these two interventions. Both TARE using SIR-Spheres and 
atezolizumab-bevacizumab seem to be more efficacious than sorafenib in 
maintaining QOL.

Plain Language Summary: For patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, as well as 
physicians treating hepatocellular carcinoma, the quality of life that different 
treatments can offer represents an increasingly important aspect to consider 
when choosing treatments. Transarterial radioembolization and 
atezolizumab–bevacizumab are two potential treatments for advanced and 
unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma, but no clinical trials have directly 
compared the outcomes of these two therapeutic options. With the data available 
(patient-level data from a clinical trial of transarterial radioembolization 
using SIR-Spheres® Y-90 resin microspheres [SIR-Spheres] versus sorafenib and 
data from a trial of atezolizumab–bevacizumab versus sorafenib from the 
literature), this study indirectly compared the time to deterioration of quality 
of life (i.e., how long quality of life is maintained) after treatment with 
transarterial radioembolization and atezolizumab–bevacizumab. The study showed 
that quality of life may be preserved over a similar time period with 
transarterial radioembolization using SIR-Spheres and atezolizumab–bevacizumab; 
also, both transarterial radioembolization using SIR-Spheres and 
atezolizumab–bevacizumab seem to maintain patients’ quality of life over a 
longer period of time compared with sorafenib. These results are expected to 
enrich the existing evidence on which patients and physicians can base their 
decisions, allowing them to choose the most appropriate treatment by assessing 
the treatments’ characteristics as a whole.

Smart packaging provides one possible solution that could reduce greenhouse gas 
emissions. In comparison with traditional packaging, which aims to extend the 
product's useful life and to facilitate transport and marketing, smart packaging 
allows increased efficiency, for example by ensuring authenticity and 
traceability from the product's origin, preventing fraud and theft, and 
improving security. Consequently, it may help to reduce pollution, food losses, 
and waste associated with the food supply chain. However, some questions must be 
answered to fully understand the advantages and limitations of its use. What are 
the most suitable smart packaging technologies for use in agro-industrial 
subsectors such as meat, dairy, fruits, and vegetables, bakery, and pastry? What 
are the opportunities from a perspective of life extension, process 
optimization, traceability, product quality, and safety? What are the future 
challenges? An up-to-date, systematic review was conducted of literature 
relevant to the application of indicator technologies, sensors, and data 
carriers in smart packaging, to answer these questions. © 2022 Society of

BACKGROUND: Deutetrabenazine is a vesicular monoamine transporter 2 inhibitor 
approved for the treatment of tardive dyskinesia (TD) in adults. In two 12-week 
pivotal studies, deutetrabenazine demonstrated statistically significant 
improvements in Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) scores, with 
favorable safety/tolerability in TD patients. This study reports long-term 
efficacy and safety of deutetrabenazine in a 3-year, single-arm, open-label 
extension (OLE) study.
METHODS: Patients who completed the pivotal studies could enroll in this 
single-arm OLE study, titrating up to 48 mg/day based on dyskinesia control and 
tolerability. Efficacy was assessed based on change from baseline in total motor 
AIMS score, Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGIC) and Patient Global 
Impression of Change (PGIC), and quality of life (QOL) assessments. Safety 
evaluation included adverse event (AE) incidence, reported using 
exposure-adjusted incidence rates, and safety scales.
RESULTS: 343 patients enrolled in the study (6 patients were excluded). At Week 
145 (mean dose: 39.4 ± 0.83 mg/day), mean ± SE change from baseline in total 
motor AIMS score was -6.6 ± 0.37 and 67% of patients achieved ≥50% improvement 
in total motor AIMS score. Based on CGIC and PGIC, 73% and 63% of patients 
achieved treatment success, respectively. QOL improvements were also observed. 
Deutetrabenazine was generally well tolerated, with low rates of 
mild-to-moderate AEs and no new safety signals; most safety scales remained 
unchanged over time.
CONCLUSIONS: Long-term deutetrabenazine treatment was associated with sustained 
improvement in AIMS scores, indicative of clinically meaningful long-term 
benefit, and was generally well tolerated. Results suggest deutetrabenazine may 
provide increasing benefit over time without increases in dose.

The nuclear gene TK2 encodes the mitochondrial thymidine kinase, an enzyme 
involved in the phosphorylation of deoxycytidine and deoxythymidine nucleosides. 
Biallelic TK2 mutations are associated with a spectrum of clinical presentations 
mainly affecting skeletal muscle and featuring muscle mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) 
instability. Current classification includes infantile- ( ≤ 1 year), childhood- 
(1-12 years), and late-onset (≥12 years) forms. In addition to age at onset, 
these forms differ for progression, life expectancy, and signs of mtDNA 
instability (mtDNA depletion vs. accumulation of multiple mtDNA deletions). 
Childhood-onset TK2 deficiency typically causes a rapidly progressive proximal 
myopathy, which leads to wheelchair-bound status within 10 years of disease 
onset, and severe respiratory impairment. Muscle biopsy usually reveals a 
combination of mitochondrial myopathy and dystrophic features with reduced mtDNA 
content. Here we report the case of an Italian patient presenting 
childhood-onset, slowly progressive mitochondrial myopathy, ptosis, hypoacusis, 
dysphonia, and dysphagia, harboring the TK2 variants c.278A>G and c.543del, the 
latter unreported so far. Compared to other childhood-onset TK2-patients, our 
case displays atypical features, including slowly progressive muscle weakness 
and absence of respiratory failure, which are usually observed in late-onset 
forms. This report extends the genetic background of TK2-related myopathy, 
highlighting the clinical overlap among different forms.
