and accrued person years. During the study period (1958-2009), there were 1,885 
cases of liver cancer, which included 383 death-certificate-only (DCO) cases; 
1,283 cases with chronic liver disease as the underlying cause of death; and 150 
DCO cases of pancreatic cancer among 105,444 study participants. Across the 
range of scenarios considered, radiation risk estimates based on corrected case 
counts were attenuated, on average, by 13-30%. Our results indicated that 
radiation risk estimates for liver cancer were potentially sensitive to 
death-certificate inaccuracies. Additional data are needed to inform 
misclassification rates in recent years.

Advancements in research and care have contributed to increase life expectancy 
of individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF). With increasing age comes a greater 
likelihood of developing CF bone disease, a comorbidity characterized by a low 
bone mass and impaired bone quality, which displays gender differences in 
severity. However, pathophysiological mechanisms underlying this gender 
difference have never been thoroughly investigated. We used bone marrow-derived 
osteoblasts and osteoclasts from Cftr+/+ and Cftr-/- mice to examine whether the 
impact of CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) deletion on cellular 
differentiation and functions differed between genders. To determine whether in 
vitro findings translated into in vivo observations, we used imaging techniques 
and three-point bending testing. In vitro studies revealed no 
osteoclast-autonomous defect but impairment of osteoblast differentiation and 
functions and aberrant responses to various stimuli in cells isolated from 
Cftr-/- females only. Compared with wild-type controls, knockout mice exhibited 
a trabecular osteopenic phenotype that was more pronounced in Cftr-/- males than 
Cftr-/- females. Bone strength was reduced to a similar extent in knockout mice 
of both genders. In conclusion, we find a trabecular bone phenotype in Cftr-/- 
mice that was slightly more pronounced in males than females, which is 
reminiscent of the situation found in patients. However, at the osteoblast 
level, the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying this phenotype differ 
between males and females, which may underlie gender differences in the way bone 
marrow-derived osteoblasts behave in absence of CFTR.

Using data from a longitudinal study, the present study employed a latent class 
mover-stayer analytical strategy to examine both the cross-sectional and 
longitudinal (+33 months) relationship between membership of stress classes, and 
subjective life expectancy. Participants were from 21 High schools in Scotland 
and Northern Ireland. Data were collected in the first year of High school (mean 
age = 12.5 years), and at +33 months (fourth year, or school year 11). Sample 1 
consisted of 1171 adolescents (40.82% females, 2.56% unreported) in Northern 
Ireland. Sample 2 consisted of 1059 adolescents (52.79% females, 1.32% 
unreported) in Scotland. Adolescents with the lowest levels of stress projected 
the highest subjective life expectancy scores. Longitudinal analyses were 
jumbled and not in keeping with cross-sectional results. More research may be 
needed on the trajectory of subjective life expectancy over time before it can 
be depended upon as a reliable outcome variable in adolescent development.

The best surgical treatment for acute type A aortic dissection (AAAD) is still a 
strongly debated issue of every cardiac surgeon. The successful result is 
obtained by taking into consideration both the preoperative and intraoperative 
aspects, such as cerebral, visceral or coronary malperfusion before surgery. 
More conservative approaches or more aggressive treatments are different 
strategies with their pros and cons to face the same problem, especially for the 
aortic arch management. The expertise of the center, the perfect surgical timing 
and a dedicated aortic team composed of expert aortic surgeons, 
anesthesiologist, radiologist and cardiologist are important but not mandatory 
to achieve the best results in this type of surgery since is not possible to 
offer it in all the hospitals. The accurate assessment of the aortic anatomy has 
to be performed, including the extension of the dissection process, the exact 
location of the entry and re-entry tears, the aortic diameters, the distribution 
of visceral vessels between the true and the false lumen and the assessment of 
perfect size of the prosthesis to avoid the oversize since it may cause new 
entry site in the descending thoracic aorta. We reviewed and analyzed different 
scenarios and techniques used for the aortic arch replacement in patients with 
AAAD, taking into consideration that the aim of surgery is to save patients 
life.

Background: Injectable botulinum neurotoxins are a mainstay of treatment for 
pediatric spasticity. AbobotulinumtoxinA and onabotulinumtoxinA are both 
injectable toxin therapies used to treat pediatric lower limb (PLL) spasticity 
in Canada. The objective of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of 
abobotulinumtoxinA vs. onabotulinumtoxinA in the treatment of PLL spasticity in 
Canada.Methods: A probabilistic Markov cohort model with a 2-year time horizon 
was developed, with health states defined by response to therapy, as 
characterized by the goal attainment scale (GAS). Based on randomized controlled 
trial evidence, response to therapy was similar or higher for abobotulinumtoxinA 
relative to onabotulinumtoxinA; uncertainty was incorporated into model 
parameters, however, as the two therapies have not been compared head-to-head. 
Canadian resource use and cost data were incorporated.Results: In the base case, 
abobotulinumtoxinA generated 1.48 quality-adjusted life years over the model 
time horizon, compared to 1.47 for onabotulinumtoxinA. AbobotulinumtoxinA was 
associated with cost savings of $123 CAD, reflecting lower costs in both 
medication acquisition and health services. The estimated improvement to quality 
of life and reduced costs result in an estimate of economic dominance for 
abobotulinumtoxinA over onabotulinumtoxinA. This dominant result persisted 
across probabilistic and scenario analyses.Key points for decision makersBased 
on a review of available clinical evidence, abobotulinumtoxinA was found to have 
significant and/or numerical efficacy benefits to onabotulinumtoxinA on 
functional outcomes (Goal Attainment Scale) and tone (Modified Ashworth Scale) 
and in the treatment of pediatric lower limb spasticityIn this 
cost-effectiveness analysis, abobotulinumtoxinA was found to be associated with 
greater quality-adjusted life years and lower costs than onabotulinumtoxinA 
(economically dominant)A limitation of this analysis was the uncertainty around 
key parameters. Specifically, the lack of head-to-head comparison data for the 
two therapies, and variable data regarding likely onabotulinumtoxinA dosing in 
PLL in clinical practice. However, across a range of plausible scenarios, the 
economic dominant result remained.

The importance of health management and maintenance occupations while homeless: 
A case study.

Author information:

St. Louis, MO, USA.

Life expectancy for persons experiencing homelessness (PEH) is two decades lower 
than the general population; often, middle-aged adults experience such 
debilitating health issues due to homelessness that their physical bodies 
resemble that of a geriatric population. Environmental barriers limiting the 
ability for PEH to follow medical recommendations and access healthcare often 
result in decreased health outcomes for this population. The need to participate 
in survival occupations can reduce time spent in occupations related to health 
and wellness. This article presents a case study to demonstrate the impact that 
limited and intermittent access to healthcare can have on quality of life and 
wellbeing for PEH. The case study illuminates the significant impact health 
concerns can cause for a PEH, including eviction from shelters, verbal abuse 
from staff and peers, and dehumanization. This case study and resulting 
manuscript are designed to explore the need for health promotion occupations 
within a population of PEH.

Economic Benefit of Hand Surgical Efforts in Low- and Middle-Income Countries: A 
Cost-Benefit Analysis.

BACKGROUND: Hand surgeons can alleviate the burden associated with various 
congenital anomalies, burn sequelae, and trauma that debilitate individuals in 
low- and middle-income countries. Because few surgeons in these areas have the 
necessary resources to perform complex hand surgery, surgical trips provide 
essential surgical care. The authors aimed to determine the economic benefit of 
hand surgical trips to low- and middle-income countries to comprehensively 
determine the economic implications of hand surgery trips in low-resource 
settings.
METHODS: The authors collected data from two major global hand surgery 
organizations to analyze the economic benefit of hand surgery trips in low- and 
middle-income countries. The authors used both the human capital approach and 
the value of a statistical life-year approach to conduct this cost-benefit 
analysis. To demonstrate the economic gain, the authors subtracted the budgeted 
cost of each trip from the economic benefit.
RESULTS: The authors analyzed a total of 15 trips to low- and middle-income 
countries. The costs of the trips ranged from $3453 to $87,434 (average, 
$24,869). The total cost for all the surgical trips was $373,040. The authors 
calculated a net economic benefit of $3,576,845 using the human capital approach 
and $8,650,745 using the value of a statistical life-year approach.
CONCLUSIONS: The authors found a substantial return on investment using both the 
human capital approach and the value of a statistical life-year approach. In 
addition, the authors found that trips emphasizing education had a net economic 
benefit. Cost-benefit analyses have substantial financial implications and will 
aid policy makers in developing cost-reduction strategies to promote surgery in 
low- and middle-income countries.

Osteoarthritis is a common condition involving articular surfaces that can 
develop gradually over time into a debilitating condition that causes pain and 
restriction of motion. An estimated 80% of Americans have an episode of low back 
pain during their lifetime. Low back pain is among the most common causes of 
healthcare visits in the United States, accounting for over 45 million trips in 
2006. Spine osteoarthritis is a significant source of chronic low back pain. 
While most cases of spine arthritis-related pain are self-limited, requiring 
only conservative therapy, chronic back pain treatment involves significant 
healthcare dollars. In 2016, patients in the United States spent an estimated 
$380 billion on low back and neck pain. $3.1 trillion, about 17.9% of the gross 
domestic product, was spent on this diagnosis. Low back pain and spine arthritis 
are among the leading health-related causes of disability and reduction in 
patient quality of life. The number of back pain cases continues to increase 
with the current obesity epidemic and increased life expectancy. Furthermore, 
low back pain accounts for an estimated 149 million lost workdays each year in 
the United States. These lost wages substantially affect America’s gross 
domestic product. Due to the complexity of the innervation of the spine and its 
surrounding structures, delineating the cause of low back pain can be 
difficult. In approximately 85% of cases, the source of back pain is 
unknown. Also complicating the diagnosis is how radiographic imaging of spine 
osteoarthritis does not necessarily correlate with patients' pain, leading to 
treatment options that may not improve symptoms. Arthritis can affect any 
articular surface; it is more likely to affect weight-bearing joints, including 
the joints of the spinal column. Functionally, the spine protects the spinal 
cord, sustains weight-bearing, and provides mobility. The spinal cord is 
composed of a three-joint complex. This complex consists of two facet joints 
(zygapophyseal joints), and one intervertebral disc, all of which are potential 
origins for back pain. These three components comprise a spinal motion segment, 
which facilitates degeneration over time. Degeneration forms vertebral 
osteophytes, facet joint osteoarthritis, and disc space narrowing. Specifically, 
spine osteoarthritis is the presence of disc degeneration and osteophyte 
formation.

BACKGROUND: In the literature, obesity is discussed as a determinant of high 
oxidative stress (OS). Hence, prevention or reduction of obesity could prevent 
high OS and subsequently serve as a target for "healthy aging."
METHODS: Diacron's reactive oxygen metabolites test (D-ROM) and total thiol 
levels (TTL), a marker of antioxidant defense capacity, were measured in 1,734 
participants of a population-based cohort study of older adults (age range: 
57-83 years) at 2 time points 3 years apart. The longitudinal associations of 
body mass index, waist-to-hip ratio, and waist circumference with D-ROM and TTL 
were assessed with multivariable adjusted generalized linear models. 
Dose-response analyses were conducted with restricted cubic splines.
RESULTS: D-ROM was not significantly associated with any of the weight measures. 
On the contrary, TTL showed statistically significant, inverse linear 
associations with all weight measures.
CONCLUSION: A healthy body weight seems to be highly relevant for the 
antioxidative defense capacity of human beings. In contrast, D-ROM levels were 
independent of the study participant's weight. Clinical trials are needed to 
corroborate if loss of weight by obese individuals can effectively increase TTL 
and subsequently also life expectancy.

BACKGROUND: Patients with heart failure (HF) discharged from the hospital are at 
high risk for death and rehospitalization. Transitional care service 
interventions attempt to mitigate these risks.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of 3 types of postdischarge HF 
transitional care services and standard care.
DESIGN: Decision analytic microsimulation model.
DATA SOURCES: Randomized controlled trials, clinical registries, cohort studies, 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention life tables, Centers for Medicare & 
Medicaid Services data, and National Inpatient Sample (Healthcare Cost and 
Utilization Project) data.
TARGET POPULATION: Patients with HF who were aged 75 years at hospital 
discharge.
TIME HORIZON: Lifetime.
PERSPECTIVE: Health care sector.
INTERVENTION: Disease management clinics, nurse home visits (NHVs), and nurse 
case management.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), costs, net monetary 
benefits, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs).
RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: All 3 transitional care interventions examined 
were more costly and effective than standard care, with NHVs dominating the 
other 2 interventions. Compared with standard care, NHVs increased QALYs (2.49 
vs. 2.25) and costs ($81 327 vs. $76 705), resulting in an ICER of $19 570 per 
QALY gained.
RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: Results were largely insensitive to variations 
in in-hospital mortality, age at baseline, or costs of rehospitalization. 
Probabilistic sensitivity analysis confirmed that transitional care services 
were preferred over standard care in nearly all 10 000 samples, at 
willingness-to-pay thresholds of $50 000 or more per QALY gained.
LIMITATION: Transitional care service designs and implementations are 
heterogeneous, leading to uncertainty about intervention effectiveness and costs 
when applied in particular settings.
CONCLUSION: In older patients with HF, transitional care services are 
economically attractive, with NHVs being the most cost-effective strategy in 
many situations. Transitional care services should become the standard of care 
for postdischarge management of patients with HF.

INTRODUCTION: Severe psychiatric disorders are typically associated with a 
significant reduction in life expectancy compared with the general population. 
Among the different hypotheses formulated to explain this observation, 
accelerated ageing has been increasingly recognised as the main culprit. At the 
same time, telomere shortening is becoming widely accepted as a proxy molecular 
marker of ageing. The present study aims to fill a gap in the literature by 
better defining the complex interaction/s between inflammation, age-related 
comorbidities, telomere shortening and gut microbiota in psychiatric disorders.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A cross-sectional study is proposed, recruiting 40 
patients for each of three different diagnostic categories (bipolar disorder, 
schizophrenia and major depressive disorder) treated at the Section of 
Psychiatry and at the Unit of Clinical Pharmacology of the University Hospital 
Agency of Cagliari (Italy), compared with 40 age-matched and sex-matched 
non-psychiatric controls. Each group includes individuals suffering, or not, 
from age-related comorbidities, to account for the impact of these medical 
conditions on the biological make-up of recruited patients. The inflammatory 
state, microbiota composition and telomere length (TL) are assessed.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study protocol was approved by the Ethics 
Committee of the University Hospital Agency of Cagliari (PG/2018/11693, 5 
September 2018). The study is conducted in accordance with the principles of 
good clinical practice and the Declaration of Helsinki, and in compliance with 
the relevant Italian national legislation. Written, informed consent is obtained 
from all participants. Participation in the study is on a voluntary basis only. 
Patients will be part of the dissemination phase of the study results, during 
which a local conference will be organised and families of patients will also be 
involved. Moreover, findings will be published in one or more research papers 
and presented at national and international conferences, in posters or oral 
communications.

BACKGROUND: The Daily Mile is designed to increase physical activity levels with 
children running or walking around school grounds for 15-min daily. It has been 
adopted by schools worldwide and endorsed as a solution to tackle obesity, 
despite no robust evidence of its benefits. We conducted a cluster randomised 
controlled trial to determine its clinical and cost-effectiveness.
METHODS: Forty schools were randomly assigned (1:1) to either the Daily Mile 
intervention or control group in which only the usual school health and 
wellbeing activities were implemented. The primary outcome was BMI z-score 
(BMIz) at 12 months follow-up from baseline, with planned subgroup analysis to 
examine differential effects. Primary economic analysis outcome was incremental 
cost per Quality-Adjusted-Life-Year (QALY) gained.
RESULTS: Using a constrained randomisation approach, balanced on school size, 
baseline BMIz and proportion of pupils eligible for free school meals, 20 
schools were allocated to intervention (n = 1,153 participants) and 20 to 
control (n = 1,127); 3 schools withdrew (2 intervention, 1 control). At 12 
months, BMIz data were available for 18 intervention schools (n = 850) and 19 
control schools (n = 820 participants). Using intention-to-treat analysis the 
adjusted mean difference (MD) in BMIz (intervention - control) was -0.036 (95% 
CI: -0.085 to 0.013, p = 0.146). Pre-specified subgroup analysis showed a 
significant interaction with sex (p = 0.001) suggesting a moderate size benefit 
of The Daily Mile in girls (MD -0.097, 95% CI -0.156 to -0.037). This was 
consistent with the exploratory economic results that showed The Daily Mile to 
be highly cost-effective in girls (£2,492 per QALY), but not in boys, and 
overall to have a 76% chance of cost-effectiveness for the whole sample, at the 
commonly applied UK threshold of £20,000 per QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall the Daily Mile had a small but non-significant effect on 
BMIz, however, it had a greater effect in girls suggesting that it might be 
considered as a cost-effective component of a system-wide approach to childhood 
obesity prevention.

Polyene antibiotics, including amphotericin, nystatin, pimaricin, and 
tetramycin, are important antifungal agents. Increasing the production of 
polyenes and generation of their improved analogues based on the biosynthetic 
pathway engineering has aroused wide concern in application researches. Herein, 
tetramycin and nystatin, both of which share most of acyl-CoA precursors, are 
produced by Streptomyces hygrospinosus var. beijingensis CGMCC 4.1123. Thus, the 
intracellular malonyl-CoA is found to be insufficient for PKSs (polyketide 
synthases) extension of tetramycin by quantitative analysis in this wild-type 
strain. To circumvent this problem and increase tetramycin titer, the acyl-CoA 
competing biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) of nystatin was disrupted, and the 
biosynthetic genes of malonyl-CoA from S. coelicolor M145 were integrated and 
overexpressed in nys-disruption mutant strain (SY02). Moreover, in order to 
specifically accumulate tetramycin B from A, two copies of tetrK and a copy of 
tetrF were introduced, resulting in elevating tetramycin B fermentration titer 
by 122% to 865 ± 8 mg/L than the wild type. In this optimized strain, a new 
tetramycin derivative, 12-decarboxy-12-methyl tetramycin B, was generated with a 
titer of 371 ± 26 mg/L through inactivation of a P450 monooxygenase gene tetrG. 
Compared with tetramycin B, the new compound exhibited higher antifungal 
activity against Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Rhodotorula glutinis, but lower 
hemolytic toxicity to erythrocyte. This research provided a good example of 
employing biosynthetic engineering strategies for fermentation titer improvement 
of polyene and development of the derivatives for medicinal applications.

INTRODUCTION: Oncoplastic breast surgery (OBS) has developed as an extension of 
breast-conserving surgery (BCS) in an effort to improve esthetic and functional 
outcome following surgery for breast cancer. The aim of the present study was to 
evaluate the possible benefits of OBS, as compared with BCS, with regard to 
health-related quality of life (HRQoL), using patient-reported outcome measures 
(PROMs).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients treated with OBS (n = 200) and BCS (n = 1304) in 
the period 1 January 2008 to 31 December 2013 were identified in a research 
database and in the Danish Breast Cancer Cooperative Group (DBCG) registry. Data 
on patient, tumor, and treatment characteristics were retrieved from the DBCG 
registry. Patients were sent a survey including the Breast-Q™ BCT postoperative 
module and a study-specific questionnaire (SSQ) in 2016. A good outcome in the 
Breast-Q module was defined as above the median. OBS was compared to BCS using a 
logistic regression analysis, and then adjusted for potential confounders, 
yielding odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals.
RESULTS: There was a statistically significant better outcome considering the 
HRQoL domain "Psychosocial Well-being " for patients treated with OBS as 
compared with BCS (OR 2.15: 1.25-3.69). No statistically significant differences 
were found for the domains "Physical Well-being" (0.83: 0.50-1.39), 
"Satisfaction with Breast" (0.95: 0.57-1.59), or "Sexual Well-being" (1.42: 
0.78-2.58).
CONCLUSION: The present study indicates better outcomes of HRQoL for breast 
cancer patients treated with OBS as compared to patients treated with BCS. There 
was no increase in physical discomfort among OBS patients despite more extensive 
surgery.

Biases in health expectancies due to educational differences in survey 
participation of older Europeans: It's worth weighting for.

Health expectancies are widely used by policymakers and scholars to analyse the 
number of years a person can expect to live in good health. Their calculation 
requires life tables in combination with prevalence rates of good or bad health 
from survey data. The structure of typical survey data, however, rarely 
resembles the education distribution in the general population. Specifically, 
low-educated individuals are frequently underrepresented in surveys, which is 
crucial given the strong positive correlation between educational attainment and 
good health. This is the first study to evaluate if and how health expectancies 
for 13 European countries are biased by educational differences in survey 
participation. To this end, calibrated weights that consider the education 
structure in the 2011 censuses are applied to measures of activity limitation in 
the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe. The results show that 
health expectancies at age 50 are substantially biased by an average of 
0.3 years when the education distribution in the general population is ignored. 
For most countries, health expectancies are overestimated; yet remarkably, the 
measure underestimates health for many Central and Eastern European countries by 
up to 0.9 years. These findings highlight the need to adjust for distortion in 
health expectancies, especially when the measure serves as a base for 
health-related policy targets or policy changes.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of deep tissue massage 
('massage'), strengthening and stretching exercises ('exercises') or a 
combination of both ('combined therapy') in comparison with advice to stay 
active ('advice') for subacute and persistent neck pain, from a societal 
perspective.
METHODS: We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis alongside a four-arm 
randomized controlled trial of 619 participants followed-up for one year. 
Health-related quality of life was measured using EQ-5D-3L and costs were 
calculated from baseline to one year. The interventions were ranked according to 
quality adjusted life years (QALYs) in a cost-consequence analysis. Thereafter, 
an incremental cost per QALY was calculated.
RESULTS: In the cost-consequence analysis, in comparison with advice, exercises 
resulted in higher QALY gains, and massage and the combined therapy were more 
costly and less beneficial. Exercises may be a cost-effective treatment compared 
with advice to stay active if society is willing to pay 17 640 EUR per QALY. 
However, differences in QALY gains were minimal; on average, participants in the 
massage group, spent a year in a state of health valued at 0.88, exercises: 
0.89, combined therapy: 0.88 and, advice: 0.88.
CONCLUSIONS: Exercises are cost-effective compared to advice given that the 
societal willingness to pay is above 17 640 EUR per year in full health gained. 
Massage and a combined therapy are not cost-effective. While exercise appeared 
to have the best cost/benefit profile, even this treatment had only a modest 
benefit and treatment innovation is needed. Advice to stay active remains as a 
good therapeutic alternative from an economical perspective.

As multiple myeloma (MM) treatments evolve, frequent updates are required to 
monitor the long-term effect of changes in approach. Traditionally, MM is 
considered an incurable disease, with most patients eventually relapsing. 
However, improvements in treatments has raised the possibility that MM might be 
functionally curable. To examine improvements in long-term survival, we followed 
4329 patients with newly diagnosed MM treated with autologous stem cell 
transplantation (ASCT) at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences from 
1989 through 2018. Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) 
were evaluated using Kaplan-Meier analysis, Cox proportional hazards models, 
relative survival analysis, and cure modeling among different time periods, risk 
groups, and demographic traits. Steady improvements in OS were found, with 
patients treated in 2014 or later having superior OS (hazard ratio, 0.35; 95% 
confidence interval [CI], 0.27-0.45) and reduced excess risk for MM death 
(relative excess risk, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.22-0.41) compared with patients treated 
in 1997 or earlier. Patients treated during intervening time periods often had 
intermediate survival, but trends in OS, PFS, and landmarked analyses were 
inconsistent. Cure models support the potential for cure, ranging from 6.3% to 
31.3%, depending on the year of treatment, with 10.0% to 18.6% of patients 
achieving their normal life expectancy across multiple periods. There was some 
evidence of reductions in early mortality within 3 years of diagnosis, longer 
complete response (CR) duration, and reductions in relapse after achieving CR. 
However, results differed depending on age, risk group, and cytogenetic 
characteristics.

STUDY QUESTION: Have mean age at menarche or mean age at natural menopause 
changed from the 1939 birth cohort to the 1964 birth cohort?
SUMMARY ANSWER: We estimated a minor decrease in mean age at menarche and an 
increase by nearly 3 years in mean age at natural menopause.
WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: In the Western world, age at menarche decreased across 
birth cohorts from the early 1800s until the 1950s. Whether mean age at menarche 
has continued to decrease in birth cohorts after the 1950s remains uncertain. It 
is also uncertain whether mean age at natural menopause has changed across birth 
cohorts.
STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: We performed a retrospective population study of 
312 656 women who were born in Norway during the years 1936-1964.
PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: The data were obtained by two 
self-administered questionnaires from women who participated in the Norwegian 
breast cancer screening program (BreastScreen Norway) during the years 
2006-2014. We used flexible parametric survival models with restricted cubic 
splines to estimate mean age at menarche, mean age at menopause and mean number 
of years between menarche and menopause according to the women's year of birth. 
The women who were still having menstrual periods contributed with follow-up 
time until the time of data collection, and the women who had reported surgical 
removal of the uterus and/or both ovaries prior to natural menopause contributed 
with follow-up time until the time of surgery.
MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: The mean age at menarche was 13.42 years 
(95% CI: 13.40-13.44 years) among women born during 1936-1939, and it was 
13.24 years (95% CI: 13.22-13.25 years) among women born during 1960-1964. The 
mean age at natural menopause increased from 50.31 years (95% CI: 
50.25-50.37 years) among women born during 1936-1939 to 52.73 years (95% CI: 
52.64-52.82 years) among women born during 1960-1964. The mean number of years 
between menarche and menopause increased from 36.83 years (95% CI: 
36.77-36.89 years) to 40.22 years (95% CI: 40.11-40.34 years).
LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Information about age at menarche and age at 
menopause was based on self-reports.
WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Late menopause is associated with increased 
risk of breast cancer but also with increased life expectancy. Thus, higher mean 
age at menopause may partly explain the increase in breast cancer incidence 
after menopause and the increase in life expectancy in recent time. Also, a 
longer interval between menarche and menopause could suggest that the number of 
years of female fecundity has increased.

Trichogramma brassicae (Bezdenko) is an important biological control agent that 
has been used widely against many lepidopteran pests. Commonly, colonies of 
Trichogramma are mass reared on factitious hosts such as Sitotroga cerealella 
(Olivier) over many generations. In this study, we evaluated the quality and 
performance of a colony of T. brassicae that had been reared for over 45 
generations (G) using two-sex life table parameters and parasitism capacity. We 
found that female adult longevity was significantly different among sequential 
generations, ranging from 5.58 ± 2.5 d (at G5) to 3.75 ± 1.42 d (at G45). 
However, no significant difference was found in male adult longevity among 
different generations. Although female wasps survived longer until the 15th 
generation, they allocated more days for egg laying at G5 and G10. The highest 
values of gross reproductive rate (GRR), net reproductive rate (R0 ), intrinsic 
rate of increase (r), finite rate of increase (λ) and mean generation time (T) 
were found in G5 and G10, which also showed significantly higher c0 . No 
significant difference in the finite parasitism rate (ω) was found among 
generations up to G15. These results suggest that T. brassicae wasps held under 
continuous laboratory rearing can be used successfully in biological control 
programs until the 15th generation without any loss of quality or performance. 
However, laboratory mass rearing colonies declined in quality after 15 
generations and we suggest that they should be rejuvenated regularly by adding 
field-collected parasitoids periodically.

INTRODUCTION: Recent randomized controlled trials have confirmed the ability of 
renal denervation to lower blood pressure (BP) in patients, resistant to the 
BP-lowering effect of multiple antihypertensive drug administration. Evidence is 
limited, however, in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and 
haemodialysis, a condition in which a persistent BP elevation, despite 
administration of many antihypertensive drugs, is common. Aim of the present 
study was to test the BP-lowering efficacy of renal denervation in patients with 
resistant hypertension and ESRD on haemodialysis. BP was measured repeatedly in 
the office and over the 24 h during 1-year follow-up.
METHODS AND RESULTS: The study was conducted from February 2017 to January 2018 
at the Policlinico of Monza, Monza, Italy. We included 24 men and women aged at 
least 20 years (mean 55 ± 16) who had ESRD, were on long-term haemodialysis and 
exhibited resistant hypertension, that is, elevated office and ambulatory BP 
values, despite multidrug antihypertensive treatment (n = 5.4 ± 1). We excluded 
patients with renal artery stenosis, malignancy, and a probable life expectancy 
less than 1 year. Twelve patients were included in the renal denervation and 12 
in the medical treatment (control) group. All patients underwent office and 24 h 
ambulatory BP measurements at baseline and at 1, 6 and 12 months during the 
follow-up. In the renal denervation group, baseline office and 24 h mean SBP 
were 180 ± 112 and 175 ± 11 mmHg, respectively, the corresponding values in the 
control group being 181 ± 19 and 181 ± 20 mmHg. Most of the other baseline 
characteristics were also similar or only slightly different between groups, 
including the mean number of administered antihypertensive drugs at baseline. 
SBP showed an early and persistent reduction after renal denervation (office 
SBP: 165 ± 13; 150 ± 7 and 149 ± 11mmHg; 24 h SBP 163 ± 20, 148 ± 10 and 
149 ± 17 mmHg after 1, 6 and 12 months, respectively). The BP-lowering effect 
was almost always present and statistically significant during both the day and 
night. DBP changes followed a similar pattern whereas heart rate never showed 
any significant change. No significant periprocedural complication of renal 
denervation was seen. The mean number of administered drugs did not show any
