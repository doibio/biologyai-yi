with neurons and microglia subjected to stress factors and in vivo models using 
mainly murine models. Quercetin, curcumin, anthocyanins, tea polyphenols, and 
other less studied phenolic compounds such as kaempferol, hesperetin, and 
icariin can also modulate Nrf2 by regulating several Nrf2 upstream activators. 
Another group of phytochemical compounds that upregulate this pathway are 
terpenoids, including monoterpenes (aucubin, catapol), diterpenes (ginkgolides), 
triterpenes (ginsenosides), and carotenoids (astaxanthin, lycopene). This review 
aims to update the knowledge on the influence of secondary metabolites of health 
interest on the activation of the Nrf2 pathway and their potential as treatments 
for NDs.

Cancer metastases into the brain constitute one of the most severe, but not 
uncommon, manifestations of cancer progression. Several factors control how 
cancer cells interact with the brain to establish metastasis. These factors 
include mediators of signaling pathways participating in migration, infiltration 
of the blood-brain barrier, interaction with host cells (e.g., neurons, 
astrocytes), and the immune system. Development of novel therapies offers a 
glimpse of hope for increasing the diminutive life expectancy currently 
forecasted for patients suffering from brain metastasis. However, applying these 
treatment strategies has not been sufficiently effective. Therefore, there is a 
need for a better understanding of the metastasis process to uncover novel 
therapeutic targets. In this review, we follow the journey of various cancer 
cells from their primary location through the diverse processes that they 
undergo to colonize the brain. These processes include EMT, intravasation, 
extravasation, and infiltration of the blood-brain barrier, ending up with 
colonization and angiogenesis. In each phase, we focus on the pathways engaging 
molecules that potentially could be drug target candidates.

Brassica napus is the most important oilseed crop in the world, and the lipid 
was stored in the oil body (OB) in the form of triacylglycerol. At present, most 
of studies on the relationship between oil body morphology and seed oil content 
in B. napus was focused on mature seeds. In the present study, the OBs in 
different developing seeds of B. napus with relatively high oil content (HOC) of 
about 50% and low oil content (LOC) of about 39% were analyzed. It was revealed 
that the size of OBs was first increased and then decreased in both materials. 
And in late seed developmental stages, the average OB size of rapeseed with HOC 
was higher than that of LOC, while it was reversed in the early seed 
developmental stages. No significant difference was observed on starch granule 
(SG) size in HOC and LOC rapeseed. Further results indicated that the expression 
of genes that involved in malonyl-CoA metabolism, fatty acid carbon chain 
extension, lipid metabolism, and starch synthesis in the rapeseed with HOC was 
higher than that of rapeseed with LOC. These results give some new insight for 
understanding the dynamics of OBs and SGs in embryos of B. napus.

Long-chain fatty acid elongases (ELOs) play important roles in the metabolism of 
fatty acids in insects. In this study, the genes for two elongases from Aedes 
aegypti were identified, AeELO2 and AeELO9. Quantitative real time PCR showed 
that AeELO2 and AeELO9 are expressed at all developmental stages and some body 
parts, but with different expression patterns. RNAi-mediated knockdown of AeELO2 
and AeELO9 was performed to investigate their roles in the development, growth, 
osmotic balance, and cold tolerance of Ae. aegypti. Knockdown of AeELO2 slowed 
larval growth and development by causing molting abnormalities. Additionally, 
33% ± 3.3% of adults died during oviposition, accompanied by an abnormal 
extension of cuticles in AeELO2-dsRNA knockdown mosquitos. Knockdown of AeEL09 
resulted in abnormal balance of cuticular osmotic pressure and a reduction in 
egg production. The maximal mRNAs of AeELO2 and AeELO9 were detected in eggs at 
72 h after oviposition. Moreover, AeELO2 knockdown reduced the egg hatching 
rates and AeELO9 knockdown larvae did not develop well. In summary, AeELO2 is 
involved in larval molting and growth, and its knockdown affects the flexibility 
and elasticity of adult mosquito cuticles. AeELO9 regulates cold tolerance, 
osmotic balance, and egg development in Ae. aegypti.

Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most frequent form of lung cancer and 
represents a set of histological entities that have an ominous long-term 
prognosis, for example, adenocarcinoma, squamous carcinoma and large cell 
carcinoma. Both small cell and non-small cell lung cancer are the main causes of 
oncological death and the oncological diseases with the highest incidence 
worldwide. With regard to clinical approaches for NSCLC, several advances have 
been achieved in diagnosis and treatment; the analysis of different molecular 
markers has led to the development of new targeted therapies that have improved 
the prognosis for selected patients. Despite this, most patients are diagnosed 
in an advanced stage, presenting a limited life expectancy with an ominous 
short-term prognosis. Numerous molecular alterations have been described in 
recent years, allowing for the development of therapies directed against 
specific therapeutic targets. The correct identification of the expression of 
different molecular markers has allowed for the individualization of treatment 
throughout the disease course, expanding the available therapeutic arsenal. The 
purpose of this article is to summarize the main characteristics of NSCLC and 
the advances that have occurred in the use of targeted therapies, thus 
explaining the limitations that have been observed in the management of this 
disease.

Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is among the newest techniques of 
advanced neuroimaging that offer the opportunity for neuroradiologists, 
neurophysiologists, neuro-oncologists, and neurosurgeons to pre-operatively plan 
and manage different types of brain lesions. Furthermore, it plays a fundamental 
role in the personalized evaluation of patients with brain tumors or patients 
with an epileptic focus for preoperative planning. While the implementation of 
task-based fMRI has increased in recent years, the existing resources and 
evidence related to this technique are limited. We have, therefore, conducted a 
comprehensive review of the available resources to compile a detailed resource 
for physicians who specialize in managing patients with brain tumors and seizure 
disorders. This review contributes to the existing literature because it 
highlights the lack of studies on fMRI and its precise role and applicability in 
observing eloquent cerebral areas in surgical oncology and epilepsy patients, 
which we believe is underreported. Taking these considerations into account 
would help to better understand the role of this advanced neuroimaging technique 
and, ultimately, improve patient life expectancy and quality of life.

Memory deficits are common in patients with dementia, such as Alzheimer's 
disease, but also in patients with other neurological and psychiatric disorders, 
such as brain injury, multiple sclerosis, ischemic stroke and schizophrenia. 
Memory loss affects patients' functionality and, by extension, their quality of 
life. Non-invasive brain training methods, such as EEG neurofeedback, are used 
to address cognitive deficits and behavioral changes in dementia and other 
neurological disorders by training patients to alter their brain activity via 
operant activity. In this review paper, we analyze various protocols of EEG 
neurofeedback in memory rehabilitation in patients with dementia, multiple 
sclerosis, strokes and traumatic brain injury. The results from the studies show 
the effectiveness of the ΕΕG-NFB method in improving at least one cognitive 
domain, regardless of the number of sessions or the type of protocol applied. In 
future research, it is important to address methodological weaknesses in the 
application of the method, its long-term effects as well as ethical issues.

University of London, Blizard Institute, 4, Newark Street, London E1 2AT, UK.

A fundamental characteristic of living organisms is their ability to separate 
the internal and external environments, a function achieved in large part 
through the different physiological barrier systems and their component 
junctional molecules. Barrier integrity is subject to multiple influences, but 
one that has received comparatively little attention to date is the role of the 
commensal microbiota. These microbes, which represent approximately 50% of the 
cells in the human body, are increasingly recognized as powerful physiological 
modulators in other systems, but their role in regulating barrier function is 
only beginning to be addressed. Through comparison of the impact commensal 
microbes have on cell-cell junctions in three exemplar physiological 
barriers-the gut epithelium, the epidermis and the blood-brain barrier-this 
review will emphasize the important contribution microbes and microbe-derived 
mediators play in governing barrier function. By extension, this will highlight 
the critical homeostatic role of commensal microbes, as well as identifying the 
puzzles and opportunities arising from our steadily increasing knowledge of this 
aspect of physiology.

Active motion examination of patients with cervical spine-related pathologies is 
necessary to establish baseline function, set physical therapy goals, and choose 
interventions. This study investigated the sagittal plane active range of motion 
(ROM) of the global (GCS) and upper cervical spine (UCS) in relation to age and 
sex in healthy volunteers. One hundred twenty-two volunteers aged 18 to 75 years 
participated. Volunteers were excluded if they displayed any characteristic that 
could affect cervical spine ROM. GCS and UCS flexion and extension were each 
measured three times using a CROM device. Linear regression models (LRMs) were 
developed to explore the relationships between age and sex and GCS and UCS ROM. 
The LRM for age showed a decrease in GCS flexion (-2.01°), GCS extension 
(-3.33°), and UCS extension (-1.87°) for every decade of increasing age. The LRM 
for sex showed that men displayed less ROM than women in GCS extension (-6.52°) 
and UCS extension (-2.43°). These results suggest an age-related loss of 
sagittal plane GCS ROM and UCS extension ROM, and sex-related differences in GCS 
and UCS extension with women having greater motion than men.

Introduction. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is associated with poor 
prognosis and 98% loss-of-life expectancy. 80% of patients with PDA are unfit 
for radical surgery. In those cases, emphasis is set on management of 
cancer-related symptoms, among which obstructive jaundice is most common. 
Endoscopic ultrasound-guided biliary drainage (EUS-BD) emerges as a valid 
alternative to the well-accepted methods for treatment of biliary obstruction. 
Patient Selection. Five consecutive patients with unresectable pancreatic 
malignancy, were subjected to EUS-BD, particularly EUS-guided 
choledochoduodenostomy (EUS-CDS). Ethics. Oral and written informed consent was 
obtained in all cases prior procedure. Technique. EUS-guided puncture of the 
common bile duct was performed, followed by advancement of a guidewire to the 
intrahepatic bile ducts. After dilation of the fistulous tract with a cystotome, 
a fully covered self-expandable metal stent was inserted below the hepatic 
confluence and extending at least 3 cm in the duodenum. Technical and clinical 
success was achieved in four patients without adverse events. In one patient 
procedure failed due to dislocation of the guidewire, with consequent biliary 
leakage requiring urgent surgery. Recovery was uneventful with no further 
clinical sequelae and there was no mortality associated with procedure. 
Discussion. Introduced in 2001, EUS-guided biliary drainage has become an 
accepted option for treatment of obstructive jaundice. According to recent 
guidelines published by European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) in 
2022, EUS-CDS is a preferred modality to percutaneous transhepatic biliary 
drainage (PTBD) and surgery in patients with failed ERCP, with comparable 
efficiency and better safety profile, which is supported by our experience with 
the procedure. Conclusions. Our case series suggests that EUS-CDS is an 
excellent option for palliative management of malignant distal biliary 
obstruction, emphasizes on the importance of adequate technique and experience 
for the technical success, and urges the need for future research on 
establishing the best choice for guidewire and dilation device.

To evaluate the value of Cirsium japonicum (CJ; thistle) as a material for 
functional foods, we studied the functional composition of cultivated CJ and the 
in vitro and in vivo antioxidant activity of the functional substance. The 
detected phenolics in farmed CJ were chlorogenic acid (CA), linarin (LIN), and 
pectolinarin (PLIN) by HPLC analysis. As a result of the antioxidant activity of 
CJ and its phenolics by DPPH and ABTS method, CA had shown the greatest 
antioxidant activity. We employed Caenorhabditis elegans to validate that in 
vitro effects of CA are shown in vivo. CA delayed reduction in pumping rate and 
progeny production during aging of C. elegans. Under both normal and oxidative 
stress conditions, CA reduced the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in 
worms and increased their lifespan. In particular, CA showed the reducing effect 
of ROS accumulation due to aging in aged worms (8 days old). To gain insight 
into the mechanism, we used skn-1/Nrf2 and daf-16/FOXO transformed worms. The CA 
effects (on catalase activity and lifespan extension) in the wild-type (WT) 
decreased in skn-1 and daf-16 mutants. In particular, CA strongly relied on 
daf-16 under mild oxidative condition and skn-1 under overall (from mild to 
strong) oxidative stress to reduce ROS and extend healthspan. Thus, we conclude 
that CA, a key bioactive phenolic of CJ, reduces ROS production and ultimately 
extends healthspan, and this effect is the result of actions of daf-16 or skn-1 
at different stages depending on the degree of oxidation or aging. Our results 
suggest that CJ containing CA can be used as an antiaging material due to its 
antioxidant properties.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a genetic multisystemic autosomal dominant 
disorder determining reduced life expectancy due to higher risk of developing 
benign and malignant tumors. Low levels of vitamin D and reduced bone mineral 
density (BMD) have been reported in young patients with NF1. However, 
correlation between vitamin D and NF1 phenotype needs to be elucidated. Aim of 
this study was to assess vitamin D levels and bone metabolism in NF1 patients, 
analyzing potential correlations with clinical phenotype. A cross-sectional 
study was carried out in a monocentric series of NF1 patients, evaluating 
genotype, clinical phenotype, BMD, biochemical evaluation with focus on serum 
25OH-vitamin D, parathyroid hormone (PTH), calcium and phosphate levels. 
Correlations between clinical manifestations, neurofibromas, and vitamin D 
status have been studied in comparison with healthy controls. 31 NF1 adult 
patients were matched for sex, age and body mass index with 31 healthy controls. 
A significantly difference in vitamin D level emerged in NF1 patients compared 
to controls. Interestingly low vitamin D levels correlated with a more 
aggressive phenotype and with a bigger size of neurofibromas. These data 
underline that vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency may play a role in clinical 
severity of neurofibromas in patients with NF1, suggesting the need to check 
bone status and replace vitamin D in these patients.

Edible chitosan or alginate coatings and their combinations with oregano 
essential oil or olive oil, have been examined for their effect on the 
microbiological, physicochemical and organoleptic characteristics of mutton. The 
results indicated that these edible coatings can contribute to maintaining good 
quality characteristics and extending mutton shelf-life. The total mesophilic 
counts in mutton ranged from 3.48 to 8.00 log10 CFU/g, the total psychrophilic 
counts from 4.00 to 9.50 log10 CFU/g, the B. thermosphacta counts from 2.30 to 
7.77 log10 CFU/g and the lactic acid bacteria counts from 2.00 to 5.85 log10 
CFU/g. Chitosan coatings significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the total mesophilic, 
the total psychrophilic (1-2 log10 cfu/g), the B. thermosphacta and the lactic 
acid bacteria counts in mutton. Alginate exhibited a lower L* value and a higher 
a* value and chroma compared with the control and chitosan lots. No significant 
differences were observed in the chemical composition of meat pieces among the 
experimental groups. Oregano oil positively affected the sensory attributes of 
meat. The most favourable combination, based on the microbiological counts, the 
organoleptic characteristics and the shelf-life extension of mutton, was that of 
chitosan with oregano essential oil.

With the extension of the human life span and the increasing pressure of women's 
work and life, menopause syndrome (MPS) refers to a problem that puzzles almost 
all women worldwide. Hormone replacement treatment (HRT) can effectively 
mitigate the symptoms but can also exert adverse effects to a certain extent. 
Glycyrrhizae radix et rhizome (GRR) is commonly made into a charcoal processed 
product, termed GRR Carbonisatas (GRRC), for use in traditional Chinese medicine 
(TCM). GRRC is widely used to treat MPS and other gynecological diseases. In 
this study, GRRC was prepared through pyrolysis. Subsequently, GRR-derived 
carbon dots (GRR-CDs) were purified through dialysis and characterized using 
transmission electron microscopy, high-resolution transmission electron 
microscopy, Fourier-transform infrared, ultraviolet, fluorescence, X-ray 
photoelectron microscopy, and high-performance liquid chromatography. The 
effects of GRR-CDs on MPS were examined and confirmed using ovariectomized 
female mice models. The GRR-CDs ranged from 1.0 to 3.0 nm in diameter and with 
multiple surface chemical groups, as indicated by the results. GRR-CDs can 
elevate the estradiol (E2) level of healthy female mice. Moreover, GRR-CDs can 
alleviate MPS using the typical ovariectomized mice model, as confirmed by 
elevating the estradiol (E2) level and reducing the degree of follicle 
stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) and raising the degree of 
uterine atrophy. The results of this study suggested that GRR-CDs may be a 
potential clinical candidate for the treatment of MPS, which also provides a 
possibility for nanodrugs to treat hormonal diseases.

Pinus. ponderosa (P. Lawson and C. Lawson) is a commercial tree and one of the 
most important forest species in North America. Ponderosa pine suffers hardship 
when going through vegetative propagation and, in some cases, 15-30 years are 
needed to achieve full reproductive capacity. Based on previous works on P. 
ponderosa regeneration through in vitro organogenesis and trying to improve the 
published protocols, our objective was to analyze the influence of different 
types of explants, basal culture media, cytokinins, auxins, and light treatments 
on the success of shoot multiplication and rooting phases. Whole zygotic embryos 
and 44 µΜ 6-benzyladenine showed the best results in terms of explants survival. 
For shoot organogenesis, whole zygotic embryos and half LP (LP medium, Quoirin 
and Lepoivre, 1977, modified by Aitken-Christie et al., 1988) macronutrients 
were selected. A significant positive interaction between whole zygotic embryos 
and half LP macronutrients was found for the percentage of explants forming 
shoots. Regarding the light treatments applied, a significantly higher 
percentage of shoots elongated enough to be rooted was detected in shoots 
growing under blue LED at a light intensity of 61.09 µmol m-2 s-1. However, the 
acclimatization percentage was higher in shoots previously cultivated under 
fluorescent light at a light intensity of 61.71 µmol m-2 s-1. Anatomical studies 
using light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy showed the light 
treatments promoted differences in anatomical aspects in in vitro shoots; 
needles of plantlets exposed to red and blue LEDs revealed less stomata compared 
with needles from plantlets exposed to fluorescent light.

Glia have an emergent role in brain aging and disease. In the Drosophila 
melanogaster brain, ensheathing glia function as phagocytic cells and respond to 
acute neuronal damage, analogous to mammalian microglia. We previously reported 
changes in glia composition over the life of ants and fruit flies, including a 
decline in the relative proportion of ensheathing glia with time. How these 
changes influence brain health and life expectancy is unknown. Here, we show 
that ensheathing glia but not astrocytes decrease in number during Drosophila 
melanogaster brain aging. The remaining ensheathing glia display dysregulated 
expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism and apoptosis, which may lead 
to lipid droplet accumulation, cellular dysfunction, and death. Inhibition of 
apoptosis rescued the decline of ensheathing glia with age, improved the 
neuromotor performance of aged flies, and extended lifespan. Furthermore, an 
expanded ensheathing glia population prevented amyloid-beta accumulation in a 
fly model of Alzheimer's disease and delayed the premature death of the diseased 
animals. These findings suggest that ensheathing glia play a vital role in 
regulating brain health and animal longevity.

CONTEXT: In recent years, patient-centered healthcare has become a primary 
concern for researchers and healthcare professionals. When included in 
randomized controlled trials (RCTs), patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures 
serve a critical role in supplementing efficacy outcomes with a patient 
perspective.
OBJECTIVES: The goals of this study are to evaluate the reporting completeness 
of PROs within literature concerning carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) utilizing the 
Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials Patient-Reported Outcomes 
(CONSORT-PRO) extension.
METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of 
Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) for published RCTs relating to CTS with at least one 
PRO measure from 2006 to 2020. Two investigators screened all RCTs for inclusion 
utilizing Rayyan (https://rayyan.qcri.org/), a systematic review screening 
platform. In an independent, masked fashion, investigators then evaluated all 
RCTs utilizing the CONSORT-PRO adaptation and Cochrane Collaboration Risk of 
Bias (RoB) 2.0 tool. Bivariate regression analyses were utilized to assess 
relationships between trial characteristics and completeness of reporting.
RESULTS: Our search returned 374 publications, yet only 31 unique RCTs met the 
inclusion criteria. The mean overall percent of adherence for CONSORT-PRO was 
41%. Our secondary outcome-assessing study characteristics-indicated 
significantly higher completeness of reporting in the absence of a conflict of 
interest statement (p<0.05), 'some concerns' for bias (p<0.005), and when 
journals required the use of the CONSORT statement (p<0.005). The RoB assessment 
determined overall suspicion for bias among included RCTs, with 35% (n=11/31) 
being labeled as 'high,' 58% (n=18/31) as 'some concerns,' and 7% (n=2/31) as 
'low.'
CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicated that the completeness of CONSORT-PRO reporting 
was deficient within CTS trials. Because of the importance placed on PROs in 
clinical practice, we recommend adherence to CONSORT-PRO prior to publication of 
RCTs to increase the understanding of various interventions on patients' quality 
of life (QoL).

Conditional relative survival (CRS) is useful for communicating prognosis to 
patients as it provides an estimate of the life expectancy after having survived 
a certain time after treatment. Our study estimates the 3-year relative survival 
conditional on having survived a certain period for patients with esophageal or 
gastric cancer. Patients with nonmetastatic esophageal or gastric cancer 
diagnosed between 2006 and 2020 treated with curative intent (resection with or 
without [neo]adjuvant therapy, or chemoradiotherapy) were selected from the 
Netherlands Cancer Registry. CRS was calculated since resection or last day of 
chemoradiotherapy. The probability of surviving an additional 3 years (ie, 
3-year CRS), if the patients survived 1, 3 and 5 years after diagnosis was 62%, 
79%, 87% and 69%, 84%, 90% for esophageal and gastric cancer, respectively. The 
3-year CRS after having survived 3 years for patients with esophageal cancer who 
underwent a resection (n = 12 204) was 91%, 88%, 77% and 60% for pathological 
Stage 0, I, II and III, and for patients with esophageal cancer who received 
chemoradiotherapy (n = 4158) was 51% and 66% for clinical Stage II and III, 
respectively. The 3-year CRS after having survived 3 years for patients with 
gastric cancer who underwent a resection (n = 6531) was 99%, 90%, 73% and 59% 
for pathological Stage 0, I, II and III, respectively. Despite poor prognosis of 
patients with esophageal or gastric cancer, life expectancy increases 
substantially after patients have survived several years after treatment. Our 
study provides valuable information for communication of prognosis to patients 
during follow-up after treatment.

BACKGROUND: Although pharmaceutical expenditures have been rising for decades, 
the question of their drivers remains unclear, and long-term projections of 
pharmaceutical spending are still scarce. We use a Markov approach considering 
different cost-risk groups to show the possible range of future drug spending in 
Germany and illustrate the influence of various determinants on pharmaceutical 
expenditure.
METHODS: We compute different medium and long-term projections of pharmaceutical 
expenditure in Germany up to 2060 and compare extrapolations with constant 
shares, time-to-death scenarios, and Markov modeling based on transition 
probabilities. Our modeling is based on data from a large statutory sickness 
fund covering around four million insureds. We divide the population into six 
risk groups according to their share of total pharmaceutical expenditures, 
determine their cost growth rates, survival and transition probabilities, and 
compute different scenarios related to changes in life expectancy or spending 
trends in different cost-risk groups.
RESULTS: If the spending trends in the high-cost groups continue, per-capita 
expenditure will increase by over 40% until 2040. By 2060, pharmaceutical 
expenditures could more than double, even if these groups would not benefit from 
rising life expectancy. By contrast, the isolated effect of demographic change 
would "only" lead to a long-term increase of around 15%.
CONCLUSION: The long-term development of pharmaceutical spending in Germany will 
depend mainly on future expenditure and life expectancy trends of particularly 
high-cost patients. Thus, appropriate pricing of new expensive pharmaceuticals 
is essential for the sustainability of the German healthcare system.

PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to assess the cost effectiveness of 
letermovir prophylaxis with the option for subsequent pre-emptive therapy (PET) 
for the prevention of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection compared with a PET-only 
scenario in adult allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (allo-HCT) 
recipients in the United States over a 10-year time horizon.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A publicly available decision tree model was constructed 
using a commercial third-party payer perspective to simulate an allo-HCT 
recipient's clinical trajectory in the first-year post-transplant, followed by 
entry to a Markov model to simulate years 2 through 10. Clinical inputs and 
utility estimates were derived from published literature. Costs were derived 
from published literature and US Department of Veterans Affairs Federal Supply 
Schedule drug pricing. Outcomes assessed included life expectancy, 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), direct medical costs, and the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses 
(PSA) were performed to test the robustness of the findings.
RESULTS: Compared with PET alone, letermovir prophylaxis was projected to 
increase life-years per person (4.99 vs. 4.70 life-years), and increase QALYs 
(3.29 vs. 3.08) and costs (US$83.411 vs. US$70,698), yielding an ICER of 
US$59,356 per QALY gained. One-way sensitivity analyses indicated our model was 
sensitive to mortality (ICER: $164,771/QALY) and utility (letermovir ICER: 
$117,447/QALY; PET ICER: $107,290/QALY) in the first-year post-transplant. In 
57.1% of the PSA simulations, letermovir was a cost-effective option using a 
willingness-to-pay threshold of US$100,000 per QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: Letermovir prophylaxis is cost effective compared with PET alone 
with a willingness-to-pay threshold of US$100,000 per QALY gained. Sensitivity 
analysis results indicate future research is required to understand the impact 
of mortality and quality of life in the first-year post-transplant to arrive at 
a conclusive decision on letermovir adoption.

High temperature is a main cause to result in the outbreak of tilapia 
streptococcal disease. However, the underlying mechanisms are not well 
understood. In this study, we first confirmed that tilapia infected with 
Streptococcus agalactiae (S. agalactiae) had a higher mortality at high 
temperature (35 °C) than that at normal temperature (28 °C). Subsequently, the 
effects of high temperature on gene expression pattern of S. agalactiae and 
intestinal microbiota of tilapia were respectively detected by RNA-seq and 16S 
rDNA sequencing. RNA-seq identified 357 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in 
S. agalactiae cultured at 28 °C and 35 °C. GO and KEGG analysis showed that 
these DEGs were highly involved in metabolic processes, including glucose, lipid 
and amino acid metabolisms, which indicates that S. agalactiae have stronger
