following the first wave of the pandemic in England based solely on historical 
trends results in an overestimate, and excess mortality will therefore be 
underestimated. Our findings, using this exemplar dataset are conditional on 
having experienced a hip fracture, which is not generalisable to the general 
population. Fractures that impede mobility in the weeks that follow the 
accident/surgery considerably shorten life expectancy and are in themselves 
markers of significant frailty. It is therefore important to apply these novel 
methods to the general population, among whom we anticipate strong patterns in 
mortality displacement - both in its length and prevalence - by age, sex, 
frailty and types of comorbidities. This counterfactual method may also be used 
to investigate a wider range of disruptive population health events. This has 
important implications for public health monitoring and the interpretation of 
public health data in England and globally.

BACKGROUND: Stroke is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide. Despite 
the prevalence and associated burden of cognitive impairment post-stroke, there 
is uncertainty regarding optimal cognitive rehabilitation for people 
post-stroke. This study aimed to assess whether a multicomponent intervention, 
called OptiCogs, is feasible, acceptable, and safe for people with cognitive 
impairment post-stroke. A secondary aim was to explore changes in cognitive 
function, fatigue, quality of life, physical function, and occupational 
performance, from pre-intervention to post-intervention.
METHODS: A feasibility study was conducted where people post-stroke with 
cognitive impairment enrolled in a 6-week multicomponent intervention. The 
primary outcomes recorded included response rate, recruitment rate, retention 
rate, adherence to the intervention protocol, adverse events, and acceptability 
of the intervention to people post-stroke. Secondary outcomes included (i) 
change in cognitive functioning using the Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination 
III, (ii) fatigue using the Fatigue Severity scale, (iii) quality of life using 
the Stroke Specific Quality of Life scale (iv) physical function using the 
patient-reported outcomes measurement information system, and (v) 
patient-reported occupational performance using the Canadian Occupational 
Performance Measure. The Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials extension 
reporting guidelines were followed, for pilot and feasibility studies, to 
standardize the conduct and reporting of this study.
RESULTS: The response rate was 10.9%. Nine eligible participants were enrolled 
during the 4-month recruitment period, with eight participants completing the 
entire 6-week intervention, as well as the pre- and post-intervention outcome 
measures. There were no reported adverse events. Participants were satisfied 
with the intervention and found it acceptable overall. Results of the secondary 
outcomes were promising for cognitive function (ACE III, pre: 63.3 ± 23.9 to 
post: 69 ± 24.6), fatigue (FSS, pre: 52.5 ± 7.3 to post: 45.6 ± 7.2), quality of 
life (SSQoL, pre: 131.0 ± 26.3 to post: 169.9 ± 15.3), physical function 
(PROMIS-PF, pre: 15.5 ± 6.3 to post: 15.8 ± 5.3), and occupational performance 
(COPM performance, pre: 9.3 ± 2.3 to post: 22.9 ± 4.2) and COPM satisfaction, 
pre: 9.9 ± 2.1 to post: 22.7 ± 3.5).
CONCLUSION: Preliminary results suggest low-modest recruitment and high 
retention rates for the OptiCogs intervention. Changes in cognitive function, 
fatigue, quality of life, and self-reported occupational performance show 
improvement from pre- to post-intervention. These potential benefits require 
further testing in a larger pilot trial.

The transition from pediatric to adult care is a critical milestone in managing 
children, especially in those with complex chronic conditions. It involves 
ensuring the patient and family adapt correctly to the new phase, maintaining 
continuity of ongoing treatments, and establishing an appropriate follow-up plan 
with specialists. Patients with Inborn error of immunity (IEI), formerly known 
as Primary Immune Disorders (PID) are part of a group of disorders characterized 
by alterations in the proper functioning of the immune system; as the diagnostic 
and treatment tools for these entities progress, life expectancy increases, and 
new needs emerge. These children have special needs during the transition. 
Particularly important in the group of children with PID and syndromic features, 
who often present multiple chronic medical conditions. In these cases, 
transition planning is a significant challenge, involving not only the patients 
and their families but also a wide range of specialists. To achieve this, a 
multidisciplinary transition team should be established between the pediatric 
specialists and the adult consultants, designing a circuit in which 
communication is essential. As few transition care guidelines in the field of 
PID are available, and to our knowledge, there is no specific information 
available regarding patients with PID associated with syndromic features, we 
share our experience in this issue as a Primary Immunodeficiencies Unit that is 
a National Reference Center for PID, and propose a guide to achieve an adequate 
and successful transition to adulthood in these patients, especially in those 
with associated syndromic features.

As life expectancy continues to rise, age-related diseases are becoming more 
prevalent. For example, proteinuric glomerular diseases typified by podocyte 
injury have worse outcomes in the elderly compared to young patients. However, 
the reasons are not well understood. We hypothesized that injury to non-aged 
podocytes induces senescence, which in turn augments their aging processes. In 
primary cultured human podocytes, injury induced by a cytopathic anti-podocyte 
antibody, Adriamycin, or Puromycin Aminonucleoside increased the 
senescence-related genes CDKN2A (p16INK4a/p14ARF), CDKN2D (p19INK4d), and CDKN1A 
(p21). Podocyte injury in human kidney organoids was accompanied by increased 
expression of CDKN2A, CDKN2D, and CDKN1A. In young mice, experimental FSGS 
induced by Adriamycin and anti-podocyte antibody increased the glomerular 
expression of p16, p21, and senescence-associated beta-galactosidase (SA-β-gal). 
To assess the long-term effects of early podocyte injury-induced senescence, we 
temporally followed young mice with experimental FSGS through adulthood (12m of 
age) and middle age (18m of age). p16 and Sudan Black staining were higher at 
middle age in mice with earlier FSGS compared to age-matched mice that did not 
get FSGS when young. This was accompanied by lower podocyte density, reduced 
canonical podocyte protein expression, and increased glomerular scarring. These 
results are consistent with injury-induced senescence in young podocytes, 
leading to increased senescence of podocytes by middle age accompanied by lower 
podocyte lifespan and health span.

Rod Fixation for Pediatric Atlantoaxial Subluxation: A Minimal 10-Year Follow-up 
Outcome Analysis.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Although the short-term outcomes of the 1-step 
reduction and fixation technique using C1 transposterior arch lateral mass 
screws combined with C2 pedicle screw and rod fixation system for the treatment 
of pediatric atlantoaxial subluxation (AAS) have been satisfactory, its 
long-term outcomes and impact on spinal development are not well studied. This 
study was intended to assess the long-term reliability of this technique for 
pediatric AAS.
METHODS: A retrospective case series study was conducted to analyze the minimum 
10-year follow-up outcomes from 7 pediatric patients with AAS who underwent 
atlantoaxial fusion using the aforementioned technique. Quality of life and 
cervical range of motion were both measured thoroughly. In addition, vertical 
growth within the fusion construct (C1-2), overall cervical alignment, and 
subaxial cervical spine degeneration were evaluated radiographically.
RESULTS: The mean age of the 7 patients was 8.14 ± 2.41 (6-12) years at the time 
of surgery. The mean follow-up period was 11.00 ± 1.15 (10-13) years. No 
patients presented identifiable intervertebral disk degeneration or segmental 
instability in the subaxial cervical spine except for 1 patient who showed mild 
intervertebral disk degeneration. Vertical growth did continue within the 
atlantoaxial complex after surgery (11.90% ± 2.37%); however, there was a 
decrease in the percentage of vertical growth compared with the corresponding 
normal populations of the same age and sex. Moreover, there was a significant 
decrease in the range of cervical extension and rotation motion, and the overall 
cervical alignment straightened at the latest follow-up.
CONCLUSION: The 1-step reduction and fixation technique is a relatively reliable 
surgical technique for pediatric AAS, which does not adversely affect the 
postoperative quality of life or the subaxial cervical degeneration. 
Nevertheless, certain limitations, such as decreased cervical range of motion 
and changes in cervical alignment, should be concerned.

We study the relationship of wealth with the "quality" of longevity as measured 
by years after age 65 containing disability or work. By comparing cohorts 
turning 65 in 1996 and 2006, we observe strong within-cohort gradients of wealth 
in which the more wealthy live more years disability-free and work more years, 
yet also experience more work-free years. We document that these gradients 
steepened over the decade we study. We explore robustness using education as an 
alternative indicator for socioeconomic status, and rule out certain 
explanations for these trends by analyzing the effect of health shocks on wealth 
accumulation.

Signal-mediated cell fusion is vital for colony development in filamentous 
fungi. Arthrobotrys oligospora is a representative nematode-trapping (NT) fungus 
that produces adhesive networks (traps) to capture nematodes. Here, we 
characterized Aoadv-1, Aoso, Aoham-6, and Aoham-5 of A. oligospora, homologs of 
proteins involved in cellular communication and fusion in the model fungus 
Neurospora crassa. The deletion of four genes resulted in the complete loss of 
cell fusion, and traps produced by mutants did not close to form mycelial rings 
but were still capable of capturing nematodes. The absence of these genes 
inhibits aerial mycelial extension, slows colony growth, and increases mycelial 
branching. In addition, the mutants showed reduced sporulation capacity and 
tolerance to oxidative stress, increased sensitivity to SDS, and disturbed lipid 
droplet accumulation and autophagy. In addition, transcriptome and metabolomic 
analyses suggested that Aoadv-1 and Aoso are involved in multiple cellular 
processes and secondary metabolism. Our results revealed that Aoadv-1, Aoso, 
Aoham-6, and Aoham-5 regulate mycelial growth and trap morphogenesis through 
cell fusion, which contributed to elucidating the molecular mechanisms of 
cellular communication regulating mycelial development and trap morphogenesis in 
NT fungi.

INTRODUCTION: total knee arthroplasty has gained popularity over decreasing 
pain, restoring mobility and improving patients' quality of life. At the 
institutional level, there is no multidisciplinary model in the treatment of our 
patients, and in our environment, physical rehabilitation starts late, making it 
difficult for patients to reincorporate and attain adequate pain control.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: a controlled, randomized, prospective and longitudinal 
study was conducted, 55 patients underwent total knee arthroplasty, assigned to 
two study groups: the ERAS (enhanced recovery after surgery) group (n = 27) and 
the usual group (n = 28). Inclusion criteria were patients with 
Kellgren-Lawrence classification grade 4 gonarthrosis, age between 30-70 years 
and follow-up for six months. Descriptive statistics were performed using 
medians and interquartile range, while inferential statistics were performed 
using the Kruskal-Wallis test.
RESULTS: the results obtained at six months showed no statistically significant 
differences in age (p = 0.327) and gender (p = 0.588). The results obtained in 
the scales of VAS, WOMAC and IKDC showed statistically significant difference (p 
= 0.000). The rapid recovery group with a 120° flexion median and the usual 
group with 90° flexion, both groups with 0° extension.
CONCLUSIONS: the enhanced recovery after surgery pathway in joint replacement 
procedures showed good results on pain, function, mobility and complications 
compared to patients undergoing usual management.

Publisher: INTRODUCCIÓN: la artroplastía total de rodilla ha ganado popularidad 
sobre la disminución del dolor, restablecer la movilidad y mejorar la calidad de 
vida de los pacientes. A nivel institucional, no existe un modelo 
multidisciplinario en el tratamiento de nuestros pacientes y en nuestro medio la 
rehabilitación física se inicia de manera tardía, dificultando la 
reincorporación de los pacientes y el control analgésico.
MATERIAL Y MÉTODOS: se realizó un estudio clínico controlado, aleatorizado, 
prospectivo y longitudinal que incluyó 55 pacientes sometidos a artroplastía de 
rodilla, asignados a dos grupos de estudio: el grupo ERAS (Enhanced Recovery 
After Surgery) (n = 27) y el grupo habitual (n = 28). Los criterios de inclusión 
fueron pacientes con gonartrosis grado IV de Kellgren y Lawrence, edad 
comprendida entre 30-70 años y seguimiento de seis meses. La estadística 
descriptiva se realizó mediante medianas y rango intercuartílico, mientras la 
estadística inferencial mediante la prueba de Kruskal-Wallis.
RESULTADOS: los resultados obtenidos a los seis meses no mostraron diferencias 
estadísticas significativas de edad (p = 0.327) y género (p = 0.588). Los 
resultados obtenidos en las escalas de EVA, WOMAC e IKDC mostraron diferencia 
estadística significativa (p = 0.000). El grupo de recuperación rápida con una 
mediana de flexión de 120° y el grupo habitual con flexión de 90°, ambos grupos 
con extensión de 0°.
CONCLUSIONES: el programa de recuperación rápida en procedimientos de remplazo 
articular, mostró buenos resultados sobre el dolor, función, movilidad y 
complicaciones en comparación con los pacientes sometidos al manejo habitual.

In our efforts to create more public awareness about Parkinson’s disease, we 
often emphasize the tremendous impact of this common disease on an individual’s 
life. However, in public awareness campaigns, we largely avoid discussions on 
the survival of people with Parkinson’s disease (PwP). Many clinicians even 
state that the survival with Parkinson’s disease is close to normal. In this 
article, we contemplate on findings regarding the mortality of Parkinson’s 
disease in order to spark a discussion about what information we should provide 
to affected individuals and their near ones about the life expectancy of PwP. 
Our narrative review of the evidence indicates that although the survival of PwP 
has improved over time, PwP still live fewer years than their age- and 
sex-matched population comparators, albeit at older ages this difference can be 
small. We feel that it is important to emphasize this information towards PwP, 
the general public, policymakers and funding bodies. We hope that this will help 
to create a better understanding of the enormous impact that this disorder can 
have on affected individuals, even beyond the disability that is experienced 
during life.

As life expectancy continues to increase worldwide, age-related dysfunction will 
largely impact our societies in the future. Aging is well established to promote 
the deterioration of cognitive function and is the primary risk factor for the 
development of prevalent neurological disorders. Even in the absence of 
dementia, age-related cognitive decline impacts specific types of memories and 
brain structures in humans and animal models. Despite this, preclinical and 
clinical studies that investigate age-related changes in brain physiology often 
use largely different methods, which hinders the translational potential of 
findings. This review seeks to integrate what is known about age-related changes 
in the brain with analogue cognitive tests used in humans and rodent studies, 
ranging from "pen and paper" tests to virtual-reality-based paradigms. Finally, 
we draw parallels between the behavior paradigms used in research compared to 
the enrollment into clinical trials that aim to study age-related cognitive

The Orthoptera are a diverse insect order well known for their locomotive 
capabilities. To jump, the bush-cricket uses a muscle actuated (MA) system in 
which leg extension is actuated by contraction of the femoral muscles of the 
hind legs. In comparison, the locust uses a latch mediated spring actuated 
(LaMSA) system, in which leg extension is actuated by the recoil of spring-like 
structure in the femur. The aim of this study was to describe the jumping 
kinematics of Mecopoda elongata (Tettigoniidae) and compare this to existing 
data in Schistocerca gregaria (Acrididae), to determine differences in control 
of rotation during take-off between similarly sized MA and LaMSA jumpers. 269 
jumps from 67 individuals of M. elongata with masses from 0.014 g to 3.01 g were 
recorded with a high-speed camera setup. In M. elongata, linear velocity 
increased with mass0.18 and the angular velocity (pitch) decreased with 
mass-0.13. In S. gregaria, linear velocity is constant and angular velocity 
decreases with mass-0.24. Despite these differences in velocity scaling, the 
ratio of translational kinetic energy to rotational kinetic energy was similar 
for both species. On average, the energy distribution of M. elongata was 
distributed 98.8% to translational kinetic energy and 1.2% to rotational kinetic 
energy, whilst in S. gregaria it is 98.7% and 1.3%, respectively. This energy 
distribution was independent of size for both species. Despite having two 
different jump actuation mechanisms, the ratio of translational and rotational 
kinetic energy formed during take-off is fixed across these distantly related 
orthopterans.

BACKGROUND: Ankle osteoarthritis (OA) is a serious problem with high associated 
pain and disability. While education and exercise are recommended for the 
initial management of OA, this has not been investigated in ankle OA. The 
primary aim of this study is to establish the feasibility of running a 
full-scale randomised controlled trial (RCT) investigating a combined education 
and exercise program compared to a general advice program for people with ankle 
OA. The secondary aims are to collect preliminary data which will inform sample 
size calculations, and understand the perspectives of people with ankle OA on 
their participation in the trial.
METHODS: Thirty individuals aged 35 years or older with symptomatic radiographic 
ankle OA will be recruited from the community and randomised to receive either a 
combined education and exercise program or a general advice program, both of 
which will be delivered by a physiotherapist in a group setting. Primary 
outcomes of feasibility include responses to study advertisements, number of 
eligible participants, recruitment rate, adherence with the intervention, 
fidelity of the intervention, adverse events, drop-out rate, and credibility and 
expectancy of the intervention. Secondary participant-reported outcomes will 
include global rating of change, patient acceptable symptom state, severity of 
ankle pain and stiffness, self-reported function, quality of life, satisfaction 
with treatment, and use of co-interventions. Follow up will be at 8 weeks and 3 
months. Physical measures of 40 m walking speed, timed stairs descent, heel 
raise endurance and ankle dorsiflexion range of motion will be collected at 
baseline and 8 weeks. Primary feasibility outcomes will be reported 
descriptively, and estimates of the variability of secondary 
participant-reported and physical outcomes will be calculated. Semi-structured 
interviews will be conducted with participants to understand perspectives about 
the intervention and participation in the trial, with data analyzed 
thematically.
DISCUSSION: Study findings will establish the feasibility of running a 
full-scale RCT to investigate a combined education and exercise program compared 
to a general advice program for people with ankle OA. This study is a necessary 
first step to advance the international research agenda of evaluating the 
efficacy of exercise in the management of ankle OA.

Would You Be Surprised? Prospective Multicenter Study of the Surprise Question 
as a Screening Tool to Predict Mortality in Trauma Patients.

Hoffman MR, Slivinski A, Shen Y, Watts DD, Wyse RJ, Garland JM, Fakhry SM; and 
the Surprise Question in Trauma Research Group.

BACKGROUND: The Surprise Question (SQ) ("Would I be surprised if the patient 
died within the next year?") is a validated tool used to identify patients with 
limited life expectancy. As it may have potential to expedite palliative care 
interventions per ACS TQIP Palliative Care Best Practices Guidelines, we sought 
to determine if trauma team members could utilize the SQ to accurately predict 
1-year mortality in trauma patients.
METHODS: A multicenter, prospective, cohort study collected data (8/20-2/21) on 
trauma team members' responses to the SQ at 24 hours from admission. One-year 
mortality was obtained via social security death index records. 
Positive/negative predictive values (PPV/NPV) and accuracy were calculated 
overall, by provider role, and by patient age.
RESULTS: Ten Level I/II centers enrolled 1172 patients (87.9% blunt). Median age 
was 57 (IQR 36-74), median ISS 10 (IQR 5-14). Overall 1-year mortality was 
13.3%. Positive predictive value (PPV), was low (30.5%) regardless of role. 
Mortality prediction minimally improved as age increased (PPV highest between 
65-74 years old, 34.5%), but consistently trended to over-prediction of death, 
even in younger patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Trauma team members' ability to forecast 1-year mortality using the 
SQ at 24 hours appears limited perhaps due to overestimation of injury effects, 
pre-injury conditions and/or team bias. This has implications for the TQIP 
Guidelines and suggests that more research is needed to determine the optimal 
time to screen trauma patients with the SQ.

DNA integrity is crucial for the clinical pregnancy outcome and offspring 
health, while detection methods currently used (comet assay, TUNNEL assay, SCSA, 
etc.) can only provide the ratio of positive sperms at the cellular level and 
are unable to quantitatively detect the breakpoints at the DNA molecular level. 
Herein, we developed a detection system based on terminal deoxynucleotidyl 
transferase and DNA strand displacement fluorescent probe, which could 
efficiently and conveniently measure the number of 3'-OH (equivalent to the 
number of breakpoints). We further investigated the use of this technique in 
assisted reproduction after completing the principle verification, system 
optimization, and research on analytical performance. The detection system was 
shown to have a good linear range from 0.01 nM to 4 nM, using single-stranded 
DNA with 3'-OH end as the calibrator. The system underwent thorough optimization 
for stability and accuracy. In comparison to the widely accepted index DFI 
detected by SCSA, the new system demonstrated reasonable correlation and better 
prediction efficiency. Its applicability was also proven through its use in 
assisted reproductive technology procedures.

Presentation.

Considering the increase in life expectancy in the general population and the 
need for a more active lifestyle, total hip arthroplasty has become an 
absolutely necessary surgical intervention to maintain these desired results. 
Along with the evolution of medicine and the increase in the quality and 
performance of the materials used to make prostheses, the number of patients who 
benefit from total hip replacement is constantly increasing, and proportionally, 
the number of patients who will require revision arthroplasty is increasing. 
Before discussing the need for hip arthroplasty revision, it is necessary to 
carry out a rigorous clinical and imaging examination for differential diagnosis 
with other pathologies such as low back pain, the presence of bone or soft 
tissue tumors, arterial occlusions and claudication, or other systemic diseases. 
One of the biggest challenges for the orthopedic surgeon in planning a hip 
revision is the compensation of the remaining acetabular bone defect, either as 
a result of the osteolysis process or following the process of removing the 
acetabular component, which in some cases can lead to severe bone loss that is 
difficult to anticipate in the preoperative planning. In this paper, we will 
present the short-term results of the use of reinforcement cages fixed with 
screws and cemented retentive acetabular cups in the case of hip revisions with 
extensive bone loss. The discussions that derive from the presented series of 
cases are related to the use of reinforcement cages, which are based on the 
principle of primary stability obtained with the help of screw fixation but 
whose risk of osteolysis and implant fixation damage is greater than in the case 
of implants that also associate biological integration at bone level. The use of 
reinforcement cages together with the retentive acetabular cup in the case of 
elderly patients with associated comorbidities, a moderate level of physical 
activity, and severe muscle insufficiency at the hip level as a result of not 
using the affected pelvic limb is still a viable solution that allows the 
patient to walk immediately after the surgery, avoiding the risk of dislocation 
(especially in patients who use the posterolateral approach) and avoiding 
morbidity induced by prolonged bed rest.

AIMS: The primary aim was to explore the age dependency of health state values 
derived via trade-offs between health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and life 
years in a discrete choice experiment (DCE). The secondary aim was to explore if 
people weigh life years and HRQoL differently for children, adolescents, adults, 
and older adults.
METHODS: Participants from the general population of the Netherlands and China 
first completed a series of choice tasks offering choices between two EQ-5D-Y 
states with a given lifespan. The choice model captured the value of a year in 
full health, disutility determined by EQ-5D-Y, and a discount rate. Next, they 
received a slightly different choice task, offering choices between two lives 
that differed in HRQoL and life expectancy but produced the same number of 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Participants were randomly assigned to fill 
out the survey for three or four age frames: a hypothetical person of 10, 15, 
40, and 70 years (the last one only applicable to China) to allow the age 
dependency of the responses to be explored.
RESULTS: A total of 1,234 Dutch and 1,818 Chinese people administered the 
survey. Controlling for time preferences, we found that the agreement of health 
state values for different age frames was generally stronger in the Netherlands 
than in China. We found no clear pattern of differences in the QALY composition 
in both samples. The probability distribution over response options varied most 
when levels for lifespan or severity were at the extremes of the spectrum.
CONCLUSION/DISCUSSION: The magnitude and direction of age effects on values 
seemed dimension- and country specific. In the Netherlands, we found a few 
differences in dimension-specific weights elicited for 10- and 15-year-olds 
compared to 40-year-olds, but the overall age dependency of values was limited. 
A stronger age dependency of values was observed in China, where values for 
70-year-olds differed strongly from the values for other ages. The 
appropriateness of using existing values beyond the age range for which they 
were measured needs to be evaluated in the local context.

BACKGROUND: Local area immigrant fraction is strongly and positively correlated 
with local life expectancy in the United States. The aim of the study was to 
determine the relationship between local area immigrant fraction and local 
prevalence of coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke.
METHODS: Cross-sectional study design, with ZIP code as the unit of observation. 
Demographic data was obtained from the American Community Survey, and linked to 
indicators of health access (e.g., insurance, annual check-ups, cholesterol 
screening), obesity, behavior (smoking, exercise), and cardiovascular outcomes 
data from the 2020 Population Level Analysis and Community Estimates. 
Multivariable regression and path analyses were used to assess both direct and 
indirect relationships among variables.
FINDINGS: CHD prevalence was lower in the second (3.9% relative difference, 95% 
CI: 3.1-4.5%), third (6.5%, 95% CI: 5.8-7.1%), and fourth (14.8%, 95% CI: 
14.1-15.8%) quartiles of immigrant fraction compared to the lowest (p-trend 
<0.001). These effects remained robust in multivariable analysis following 
adjustment for indicators of access, obesity, and behavioral variables (p-trend 
<0.0001). For stroke, only the highest quartile demonstrated a significant 
difference in prevalence (2.1%, 95% CI: 1.2-3.0% with full adjustment). In CHD 
path analysis, ∼45% of the association of immigrant fraction was direct, and 
∼55% was mediated through lower prevalence of deleterious behaviors (e.g., 
smoking). In stroke path analysis, the effect was entirely mediated through 
indirect effects.
INTERPRETATION: In the United States, ZIP codes with higher immigrant fractions 
have lower prevalence of cardiovascular diseases. These associations are 
partially mediated through differences in health behaviors at the community 
level.

As healthcare systems are improving and thereby the life expectancy of human 
populations is increasing, cancer is representing itself as the second leading 
cause of death. Although cancer biologists have put enormous effort on cancer 
research so far, we still have a long way to go before being able to treat 
cancers efficiently. One interesting approach in cancer biology is to learn from 
natural resistance and/or predisposition to cancer. Cancer-resistant species and 
tissues are thought-provoking models whose study shed light on the inherent 
cancer resistance mechanisms that arose during the course of evolution. On the 
other hand, there are some syndromes and factors that increase the risk of 
cancer development, and revealing their underlying mechanisms will increase our 
knowledge about the process of cancer formation. Here, we review natural 
resistance and predisposition to cancer and the known mechanisms at play. 
Further insights from these natural phenomena will help design future cancer 
research and could ultimately lead to the development of novel cancer 
therapeutic strategies.
