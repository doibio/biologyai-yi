LINKING EVIDENCE TO ACTION: This study showed that POD incidence in older people 
undergoing surgery varied widely across surgery type. The more complex surgeries 
like cardiac and abdominal surgeries were associated with a higher risk of POD. 
This highlights the need to include the level of surgery complexity as a risk 
factor in preoperative assessments.

BACKGROUND: Changed health behaviours can contribute significantly to improved 
health. Consequently, significant investments have been channelled towards 
health behaviour change initiatives in Africa. Health behaviour change 
initiatives that address social, economic and environmental levers for behaviour 
change can create more sustained impact.
OBJECTIVES: Through a scoping study of the literature, we explored the 
literature on behaviour change initiatives in Africa, to assess their 
typologies. We explored whether the availability of initiatives reflected 
country demographic characteristics, namely life expectancy, gross domestic 
product (GDP), and population sizes. Finally, we assessed topical themes of 
interventions relative to frequent causes of mortality.
METHODS: We used the Behaviour Change Wheel intervention categories to 
categorise each paper into a typology of initiatives. Using Pearson's 
correlation coefficient, we explored whether there was a correlation between the 
number of initiatives implemented in a country in the specified period, and 
socio-demographic indicators, namely, GDP per capita, total GDP, population 
size, and life expectancy.
RESULTS: Almost 64% of African countries were represented in the identified 
initiatives. One in five initiatives was implemented in South Africa, while 
there was a dearth of literature from Central Africa and western parts of North 
Africa. There was a positive correlation between the number of initiatives and 
GDP per capita. Most initiatives focused on addressing sexually transmitted 
infections and were short-term trials and/or pilots. Most initiatives were 
downstream focused e.g. with education and training components, while upstream 
intervention types such as the use of incentives were under-explored.
CONCLUSION: We call for more emphasis on initiatives that address contextual 
facilitators and barriers, integrate considerations for sustainable development, 
and consider intra-regional deprivation.

PURPOSE: The incidence of early gastric cancer is increasing in older patients 
alongside life expectancy. For early gastric cancer of the upper third of the 
stomach, laparoscopic function-preserving gastrectomy (LFPG), including 
laparoscopic proximal gastrectomy (LPG) and laparoscopic subtotal gastrectomy 
(LSTG), is expected to be an alternative to laparoscopic total gastrectomy 
(LTG). However, whether LFPG has advantages over LTG in older patients remains 
unknown.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed data of consecutive patients 
aged ≥75 years who underwent LTG, LPG, or LSTG for cT1N0M0 gastric cancer 
between 2005 and 2019. Surgical and nutritional outcomes, including blood 
parameters, percentage body weight (%BW) and percentage skeletal muscle index 
(%SMI) were compared between LTG and LPG or LSTG. Survival outcomes were also 
compared between LTG and LFPG groups.
RESULTS: A total of 111 patients who underwent LTG (n=39), LPG (n=48), and LSTG 
(n=24) were enrolled in this study. To match the surgical indications, LTG was 
further categorized into "LTG for LPG" (LTG-P) and "LTG for LSTG" (LTG-S). No 
significant differences were identified in the incidence of postoperative 
complications among the procedures. Postoperative nutritional parameters, %BW 
and %SMI were better after LPG and LSTG than after LTG-P and LTG-S, 
respectively. The survival outcomes of LFPG were better than those of LTG.
CONCLUSIONS: LFPG is safe for older patients and has advantages over LTG in 
terms of postoperative nutritional parameters, body weight, skeletal 
muscle-sparing, and survival. Therefore, LFPG for upper early gastric cancer 
should be considered in older patients.

INTRODUCTION: The KEYNOTE-054 trial found that adjuvant treatment with 
pembrolizumab improved recurrence-free survival versus placebo in completely 
resected high-risk stage III melanoma patients. We assessed the 
cost-effectiveness of adjuvant pembrolizumab in Colombia compared with watchful 
waiting, a widely used strategy despite the high risk of recurrence with surgery 
alone.
METHODS: A four-health state [recurrence-free (RF), locoregional recurrence 
(LR), distant metastases (DM), and death) Markov model was developed to assess 
the lifetime medical costs and outcomes (3% annual discount), along with 
cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). The transitions from the RF and LR states 
were modeled using KEYNOTE-054 data, and those from the DM state were modeled 
using data from the KEYNOTE-006 trial and a network meta-analysis of advanced 
treatments received after adjuvant pembrolizumab and watchful waiting. The 
health state utilities were derived from KEYNOTE-054 Euro-QoL data and 
literature. Costs are expressed in 2021 Colombian pesos (COP).
RESULTS: Over a 46-year time horizon, patients on adjuvant pembrolizumab and 
watchful waiting were estimated to gain 9.69 and 7.56 quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs), 10.83 and 8.65 life-years (LYs), and incur costs of COP 
663,595,726 and COP 563,237,206, respectively. The proportion of LYs spent in RF 
state was 84.63% for pembrolizumab and 72.13% for watchful waiting, yielding 
lower subsequent treatment, disease management, and terminal care costs for 
pembrolizumab. Adjuvant pembrolizumab improved survival by 2.18 LYs and 2.13 
QALYs versus watchful waiting. The ICER per QALY was COP 47,081,917, primarily 
driven by recurrence rates and advanced melanoma treatments. The deterministic 
sensitivity analysis results were robust and consistent across various 
reasonable inputs and alternative scenarios. At a willingness-to-pay threshold 
of COP 69,150,201 per QALY, the probability of pembrolizumab being 
cost-effective was 65.70%.
CONCLUSION: Pembrolizumab is cost-effective as an adjuvant treatment compared to 
watchful waiting among patients with high-risk stage III melanoma after complete 
resection in Colombia.

The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) invited the 
manufacturer (Celgene) of oral azacitidine (ONUREG), as part of the Single 
Technology Appraisal (STA) process, to submit evidence for the clinical 
effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of oral azacitidine for maintenance 
treatment of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) after induction therapy compared with 
watch-and-wait plus best supportive care (BSC) and midostaurin. Kleijnen 
Systematic Reviews Ltd, in collaboration with Maastricht University Medical 
Centre+, was commissioned to act as the independent Evidence Review Group (ERG). 
This paper summarises the company submission (CS), presents the ERG's critical 
review on the clinical and cost-effectiveness evidence in the CS, highlights the 
key methodological considerations and describes the development of the NICE 
guidance by the Appraisal Committee. In the QUAZAR AML-001 trial, oral 
azacitidine significantly improved overall survival (OS) versus placebo: median 
OS gain of 9.9 months (24.7 months versus 14.8 months; hazard ratio (HR) 0.69 
(95% CI 0.55-0.86), p < 0.001). The median time to relapse was also better for 
oral azacitidine, and the incidences of TEAEs were similar for the two arms. The 
company excluded two of the comparators listed in the scope, low-dose cytarabine 
and subcutaneous azacitidine, informed only by clinical expert opinion, leaving 
only best supportive care (BSC) and midostaurin for the FLT3-ITD and/or FLT3-TKD 
(FLT3 mutation)-positive subgroup. An ITC comparing oral azacitidine to 
midostaurin as maintenance therapy in the appropriate subgroup demonstrated that 
the OS and relapse-free survival (RFS) HRs were favourable for oral azacitidine 
when compared with midostaurin. However, in the only available trial of 
midostaurin as maintenance treatment in AML that was used for this ITC, subjects 
were not randomised at the maintenance phase, but at induction, which posed a 
substantial risk of bias. The revised and final probabilistic incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) presented by the company, including a commercial 
arrangement, was £32,480 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained for oral 
azacitidine versus watch-and-wait plus BSC. Oral azacitidine was dominant versus 
midostaurin in the FLT-3 subgroup. The ERG's concerns included the approach of 
modelling haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), the generalisability 
of the population and the number of cycles of consolidation therapy 
pre-treatment in the QUAZAR AML-001 trial to UK clinical practice, and 
uncertainty in the relapse utility. The revised and final ERG base case resulted 
in a similar probabilistic ICER of £33,830 per QALY gained versus watch-and-wait 
plus BSC, but with remaining uncertainty. Oral azacitidine remained dominant 
versus midostaurin in the FLT-3 subgroup. After the second NICE appraisal 
committee meeting, the NICE Appraisal Committee recommended oral azacitidine 
(according to the commercial arrangement), within its marketing authorisation, 
as an option for maintenance treatment for AML in adults who are in complete 
remission, or complete remission with incomplete blood count recovery, after 
induction therapy with or without consolidation treatment, and cannot have or do 
not want HSCT.

BACKGROUND: Quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE) combines mortality risk and 
multidimensional health-related quality of life (HRQoL) information to measure 
healthy life expectancy in terms of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). This 
paper estimates the relative importance of individual quality of life dimensions 
in explaining inequalities in QALE.
METHODS: We combined EQ-5D-5L data from the Health Survey for England for 2017 
and 2018 (N = 14,412) with full population mortality data from the Office for 
National Statistics to calculate QALE by age, sex and deprivation quintile. The 
effect of HRQoL dimensions on the socioeconomic gradient in QALE was decomposed 
using an iterative imputation approach, in which inequalities associated with 
socioeconomic status in each domain were removed by imputing the response 
distribution of the richest quintile for all participants. Sampling uncertainty 
in the HRQoL data was evaluated using bootstrapping.
RESULTS: People in the least deprived fifth of neighbourhoods in England can 
expect to live 7.0 years longer and experience 11.1 more QALYs than those in the 
most deprived fifth. Inequalities in HRQoL accounted for 28.0% and 45.7% of QALE 
inequalities for males and females, respectively. Pain/discomfort, 
anxiety/depression and mobility were the most influential HRQoL domains.
DISCUSSION: Our results identify the extent of inequalities associated with 
socioeconomic status in lifetime health and the relative importance of 
inequalities by mortality and HRQoL. The contributions of the individual 
dimensions of HRQoL towards lifetime inequalities vary substantially by sex. Our 
findings can help to identify the types of interventions most likely to 
alleviate health inequalities, which may be different for males and females.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has been the third leading cause of 
death worldwide. As the traditional risk factors (like smoking and ambient air 
pollution) on the burden of COPD being well characterized, the burden of COPD 
due to non-optimal temperature has been widely concerned. In this study, we 
extracted the relevant burden data of COPD attributable to non-optimal 
temperature from GBD 2019 and adopted estimated annual percent changes, Gaussian 
process regression (GPR), and age-period-cohort model to evaluate the 
spatiotemporal patterns, relationships with socio-demographic level, and the 
independent effects of age, period and cohort from 1990 to 2019. In brief, the 
global COPD burden attributable to non-optimal temperatures showed declining 
trends but was still more severe in the elderly, males, Asia, and regions with 
low socio-demographic index (SDI). And cold had a greater burden than heat. The 
inverted U-shape is expected for the relationship between SDI and the burden of 
COPD caused by non-optimal temperatures according to the GPR model, with the 
inflection point around SDI 0.45. Besides, the improvements were observed in 
period and cohort effects but were relatively limited in low and low-middle SDI 
regions. Public health managers should execute more targeted programs to lessen 
this burden predominantly among lower SDI countries.

AIMS: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of standard-of-care treatment (SoC) to 
SoC in combination with omalizumab (OML + Soc) in patients with severe asthma 
using real-world prospective clinical data from four major medical centers in 
Turkey.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between February 2018 and November 2019, a total of 206 
patients with severe asthma, including 126 of whom were in the OML + SoC group 
and 80 in the SoC group, were followed for 12 months to evaluate their asthma 
status and quality of life. Cost data for this patient-level economic evaluation 
were sourced from the MEDULA database of the hospitals and expressed in Turkish 
Lira (₺). Efficacy data were obtained by means of Turkish versions of the Asthma 
Control Test for asthma status, the 5-level EQ-5D-5L version (EQ-5D-5L), and the 
Asthma Quality of Life Scale for quality of life. A Markov model with 2-week 
cycles was specified, comparing costs and treatment effects of SoC vs. OML + SoC 
over a lifetime from the Turkish payer perspective.
RESULTS: Per-patient costs were ₺23,607.08 in the SoC arm and ₺425,329.81 in the 
OML + Soc arm, for a difference of ₺401,722.74. Life years (LY) and 
quality-adjusted life years (QALY) were 13.60 and 10.08, respectively, in the 
SoC group; and 21.26 and 13.35, respectively, in the OML + SoC group, for 
differences of 7.66 LYs and 3.27 QALYs. This yielded an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio of an additional ₺52,427.04 to gain 1 LY and an 
incremental cost-utility ratio of an incremental ₺122,675.57 to gain 1 QALY; the 
latter being below the ₺156,948 willingness-to-pay threshold for Turkey 
referenced by WHO. One-way and multivariate sensitivity analyses confirmed the 
base-case results.
CONCLUSION: Whereas most economic evaluations are based on aggregate data, this 
independent cost-effectiveness analysis using prospective real-world 
patient-level data suggests that omalizumab in combination with standard of care 
is cost-effective for severe asthma from the Turkish public payer perspective.

Plain Language Summary: What is the context? Severe asthma, a subset of 
difficult-to-treat asthma, refers to asthma that cannot be controlled despite 
adherence to optimized maximal therapy and treatment of contributing factors, or 
asthma that worsens when high-dose therapy is reduced.Omalizumab is the first 
biologic therapy approved for the treatment of allergic asthma. Its main role is 
to prevent the release of various inflammation factors that cause severe asthma 
episodes.Cost-effectiveness analysis is an economic method of determining how 
much more a new and better treatment costs relative to the current treatment in 
terms of how many life years (LY) and how many quality-adjusted life years 
(QALY) are gained with the new treatment. Cost-effectiveness results tell us how 
much more money is needed over the cost of the current treatment to achieve one 
additional LY, regardless of the quality of life, or one additional LY with good 
quality of life.No cost-effectiveness data obtained from actual clinical patient 
data are available for Turkey. What is new? Our study found that the addition of 
omalizumab to the current standard of care for severe asthma increases costs but 
also increases life years and quality-adjusted life years. The additional cost 
was less than what the World Health Organization assumes is reasonable for 
Turkey.This study used actual clinical patient data and noted that asthma 
patients in the omalizumab group used fewer health services, had a better 
clinical course, had a better quality of life, and lived longer with their 
disease under control.What is the impact? In severe asthmatic patients, adding 
omalizumab to standard-of-care, while more costly, yields better outcomes and is 
therefore cost-effective.The cost-effectiveness estimates fall within the 
margins of being cost-responsible. The Turkish public payer should strongly 
consider making omalizumab available to all eligible patients. This will enable 
working-age patients to work, and contribute to their families, while also 
strengthening the Turkish economy.

Technology, 100029, Beijing, China.

Artificial dissipative networks have emerged as advanced bionic systems for the 
development of material technology and synthetic biology. Here, a DNA-based 
artificial dissipation system is demonstrated that synchronizes multiple 
energy-rich molecules (fuels) including oligonucleotide, dNTP, and ATP. The 
autonomous operation of the dissipation system relies on the integration of DNA 
reaction network including polymerase extension, kinase phosphorylation, and 
exonuclease digestion. The use of multiple fuels provides multiple transient 
states with different energy levels and fine-tuning dissipative kinetics. The 
lifetime of the transient state can be programmed to increase or decrease just 
by varying one of the fuel molecules unlike conventional DNA-based dissipative 
systems where the increase in the concentration of fuel molecule extends the 
lifetime. This design greatly expands the toolkits for establishing 
dissipative/dynamic DNA networks. The dissipation system is harnessed to 
dynamically regulate the assembly of DNA nanotubes allowing for controlling the 
assembly kinetics by multiple fuels. Owing to the multiple transient states in 
the dissipation system, two nanotubes can be regulated in parallel. It is 
envisioned that the system will find broad application in responsive materials, 
soft robotics, biosensors, and on-demand drug delivery.

INTRODUCTION AND IMPORTANCE: Primary hyperparathyroidism is the most common 
cause of hypercalcemia in outpatients. Giant parathyroid adenomas are rare and 
can present diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. The clinical presentation is 
often insidious, and acute presentation is uncommon.
CASE PRESENTATION: Herein we report a case of primary hyperthyroidism secondary 
to giant parathyroid adenoma in a 54-year-old woman presenting with acute and 
severe hypercalcemia. Preoperative laboratory exams indicated elevated values of 
parathormone and serum calcium. CT scan and parathyroid scintigraphy showed a 
giant right inferior parathyroid adenoma measuring 6 cm in its largest diameter 
extending to the mediastinum. Despite its size and extension, the gland was 
successfully managed through a transcervical parathyroidectomy. The patient is 
actually asymptomatic and normocalcemic after a follow up of 3 years.
CLINICAL DISCUSSION: Giant parathyroid adenomas can cause severe hypercalcemia. 
Imaging studies are crucial for preoperative localization. A classic 
transcervical approach can be used to remove giant adenomas, even when they 
extend into the anterior mediastinum. Despite their size, giant parathyroid 
adenomas have a good prognosis if they are removed surgically.
CONCLUSIONS: Hypercalcemia associated with a giant, functional parathyroid 
adenoma can be life-threatening. It is management is urgent. It is both medical 
and surgitforward, and various morphologiccal including correction of 
hypercalcemia and parathyroidectomy.

INTRODUCTION: Depression frequently affects patients with cardiovascular disease 
(CVD). When these conditions co-occur, outcomes such as quality of life and life 
expectancy worsen. In everyday practice, this specific and prevalent 
disease-disease interaction complicates patient management. Clinical practice 
guidelines (CPGs) aim to provide the best available advice for clinical 
decision-making to improve patient care. This study will aim to evaluate how 
CPGs specifically address depression in patients with CVD, and whether they 
provide any operational guidance for screening and management of depression in 
the primary care and outpatient setting.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will conduct a systematic review of CPGs on CVD 
management published from 2012 to 2023. A broad literature search for guidelines 
will be performed through electronic medical databases, grey literature search 
tools, and websites of national and professional medical organisations.Based on 
the inclusion criteria, two independent reviewers will evaluate eligible 
guidelines for screening and management recommendations on depression in 
patients with CVD. Additional points to be evaluated will be any mention of 
drug-drug or drug-disease interactions, other aspects of specific relevance to 
treating physicians, as well as general information on mental health. We will 
assess the quality of CPGs with a recommendation regarding depression in CVD 
patients using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: As this systematic review is based on available 
published data, ethics approval and consent are not applicable. Our intent is 
that our results will be published in a peer-reviewed journal, presented at 
international scientific meetings, and distributed to healthcare providers.

INTRODUCTION: Interstitial lung diseases consist of a range of lung disorders, 
the most prevalent being idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). IPF is a chronic, 
progressive disease, resulting in loss of lung function and potentially 
significant impacts on quality of life. There is an increasing need to address 
unmet needs in this population as there is evidence that unmet needs may impact 
quality of life and health outcomes. The key objective of this scoping review is 
to define the unmet needs of patients living with a diagnosis of IPF and to 
identify gaps in the literature relating to unmet needs. Findings will inform 
the development of services and the introduction of patient-centred clinical 
care guidelines for IPF.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This scoping review is guided by the methodological 
framework for conducting scoping reviews developed by the Joanna Briggs 
Institute. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and 
Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews checklist is used for guidance. The 
following databases will be searched: CINAHL, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Web of Science, 
Embase and ASSIA and include a comprehensive grey literature search. The review 
will report on adult patients >18 with a diagnosis of IPF or pulmonary fibrosis 
and be limited to publications from 2011 onwards, with no language restrictions 
applied. Two independent reviewers will screen articles in consecutive stages 
for relevance against the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Data will be 
extracted using a predefined data extraction form and analysed using descriptive 
and thematic analysis. Findings will be presented in tabular form, coupled with 
a narrative summary of the evidence.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethics approval is not required for this scoping 
review protocol. We will disseminate our findings using traditional approaches 
that include open access peer-reviewed publications and scientific 
presentations.

Developing new capabilities to predict the risk of intracranial aneurysm rupture 
and to improve treatment outcomes in the follow-up of endovascular repair is of 
tremendous medical and societal interest, both to support decision-making and 
assessment of treatment options by medical doctors, and to improve the life 
quality and expectancy of patients. This study aims at identifying and 
characterizing novel flow-deviator stent devices through a high-fidelity 
computational framework that combines state-of-the-art numerical methods to 
accurately describe the mechanical exchanges between the blood flow, the 
aneurysm, and the flow-deviator and deep reinforcement learning algorithms to 
identify a new stent concepts enabling patient-specific treatment via accurate 
adjustment of the functional parameters in the implanted state.

Influenza A virus (IAV) is a respiratory virus that causes epidemics and 
pandemics. Knowledge of IAV RNA secondary structure in vivo is crucial for a 
better understanding of virus biology. Moreover, it is a fundament for the 
development of new RNA-targeting antivirals. Chemical RNA mapping using 
selective 2'-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension (SHAPE) coupled 
with Mutational Profiling (MaP) allows for the thorough examination of secondary 
structures in low-abundance RNAs in their biological context. So far, the method 
has been used for analyzing the RNA secondary structures of several viruses 
including SARS-CoV-2 in virio and in cellulo. Here, we used SHAPE-MaP and 
dimethyl sulfate mutational profiling with sequencing (DMS-MaPseq) for 
genome-wide secondary structure analysis of viral RNA (vRNA) of the pandemic 
influenza A/California/04/2009 (H1N1) strain in both in virio and in cellulo 
environments. Experimental data allowed the prediction of the secondary 
structures of all eight vRNA segments in virio and, for the first time, the 
structures of vRNA5, 7, and 8 in cellulo. We conducted a comprehensive 
structural analysis of the proposed vRNA structures to reveal the motifs 
predicted with the highest accuracy. We also performed a base-pairs conservation 
analysis of the predicted vRNA structures and revealed many highly conserved 
vRNA motifs among the IAVs. The structural motifs presented herein are potential 
candidates for new IAV antiviral strategies.

BACKGROUND: Mitochondrial genome sequences have become critical to the study of 
biodiversity. Genome skimming and other short-read based methods are the most 
common approaches, but they are not well-suited to scale up to multiplexing 
hundreds of samples. Here, we report on a new approach to sequence hundreds to 
thousands of complete mitochondrial genomes in parallel using long-amplicon 
sequencing. We amplified the mitochondrial genome of 677 specimens in two 
partially overlapping amplicons and implemented an asymmetric PCR-based indexing 
approach to multiplex 1,159 long amplicons together on a single PacBio SMRT 
Sequel II cell. We also tested this method on Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) 
MinION R9.4 to assess if this method could be applied to other long-read 
technologies. We implemented several optimizations that make this method 
significantly more efficient than alternative mitochondrial genome sequencing 
methods.
RESULTS: With the PacBio sequencing data we recovered at least one of the two 
fragments for 96% of samples (~ 80-90%) with mean coverage ~ 1,500x. The ONT 
data recovered less than 50% of input fragments likely due to low throughput and 
the design of the Barcoded Universal Primers which were optimized for PacBio 
sequencing. We compared a single mitochondrial gene alignment to half and full 
mitochondrial genomes and found, as expected, increased tree support with longer 
alignments, though whole mitochondrial genomes were not significantly better 
than half mitochondrial genomes.
CONCLUSIONS: This method can effectively capture thousands of long amplicons in 
a single run and be used to build more robust phylogenies quickly and 
effectively. We provide several recommendations for future users depending on 
the evolutionary scale of their system. A natural extension of this method is to 
collect multi-locus datasets consisting of mitochondrial genomes and several 
long nuclear loci at once.

OBJECTIVES: Infant massage (IM) is a well-studied, safe intervention known to 
benefit infants born preterm. Less is known about the benefits of 
maternally-administrated infant massage for mothers of preterm infants who often 
experience increased rates of anxiety and depression in their infants' first 
year of life. This scoping review summarizes the extent, nature, and type of 
evidence linking IM and parent-centered outcomes.
METHODS: The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses 
Extension for scoping reviews (PRISMA-ScR) protocol was followed using three 
databases: PubMed, Embase, and CINAHL. Thirteen manuscripts evaluating 11 
separate study cohorts met pre-specified inclusion criteria.
RESULTS: Six primary topics related to the influence of infant massage on parent 
outcomes emerged: 1) anxiety, 2) perceived stress, 3) depressive symptoms, 4) 
maternal-infant interaction, 5) maternal satisfaction, and 6) maternal 
competence. Emerging evidence supports that infant massage, when administered by 
mothers, benefits mothers of preterm infants by reducing anxiety, stress, and 
depressive symptoms and improving maternal-infant interactions in the 
short-term, but there is limited evidence to support its effectiveness on these 
outcomes in longer periods of follow-up. Based on effect size calculations in 
small study cohorts, maternally-administered IM may have a moderate to large 
effect size on maternal perceived stress and depressive symptoms.
CONCLUSIONS: Maternally-administered IM may benefit mothers of preterm infants 
by reducing anxiety, stress, depressive symptoms, and by improving 
maternal-infant interactions in the short-term. Additional research with larger 
cohorts and robust design is needed to understand the potential relationship 
between IM and parental outcomes.

INTRODUCTION: Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Diseases (CVD) are among the most 
relevant causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide, especially in aged people. 
Statins are one of the leading pharmacological interventions against 
atherosclerosis and are widely used to reduce the risk of occurring coronary 
artery diseases and related outcomes in both primary and secondary prevention. 
The management of chronic diseases is improved considerably over time, leading 
to an increase in life expectancy despite heavier comorbidity-related burdens in 
the elderly.
AIMS: The paper focused on the role of statins in the management of 
atherosclerosis and related burdens in elderly patients.
RESULTS: Statins are essential in reducing the risk of CVD in secondary and 
primary prevention, particularly in high-risk individuals. Guidelines encourage 
using specific algorithms with age-specific cutoffs to assess individual 
cardiovascular risk irrespective of baseline age, as the expansion of life 
expectancy produces favorable effects of statin treatment in those over 70.
DISCUSSION: Besides the estimation of baseline CV risk, a specific age-related 
assessment is also necessary before prescribing statin treatment in aged people 
focusing on frailty, potential pharmacological interactions due to 
polypharmacotherapy, cognitive impairment, and background chronic comorbidities, 
such as diabetes mellitus. Before starting statin therapy, an accurate choice of 
type and dose of statins is needed as potential adverse events are more 
prevalent with high-dose than low-to-moderatedose regimens and with lipophile 
than hydrophile statins (e.g., potential implication on intra-cerebral 
cholesterol metabolism).
CONCLUSION: Despite possible adverse events, elderly patients should receive 
statins, when appropriate, to avoid the first occurrence of recurrent 
cardiovascular events and related burdens.

Australia.

BACKGROUND: There is a disparity in health outcomes between indigenous and 
nonindigenous Australians, with higher chronic disease burden and shorter life 
expectancy in this minority population. Although rates of breast cancer among 
indigenous women are lower than nonindigenous women, they face a higher breast 
cancer-associated mortality, which may not entirely be explained by 
socio-economic disadvantage.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study investigated previously described 
pathologic prognostic factors in indigenous Australians in the Northern 
Territory.
RESULTS: Data analyzed confirmed that indigenous women were more likely to have 
poorer prognostic disease features, including ER/PR negative and human epidermal 
growth factor receptor 2 amplified tumors, larger tumors, and higher stage 
disease.
CONCLUSION: These pathologic features portend to a poor prognosis, raising the 
possibility these factors contribute to the disparity in health outcomes between 
indigenous and nonindigenous women with breast cancer, in addition to known 
socio-economic factors.

BACKGROUND: People with serious mental illness (SMI) have a significantly 
shorter life expectancy than the general population. This study investigates 
whether the mortality rate in this group has changed over the last decade.
METHODS: Using Clinical Record Interactive Search software, we extracted data 
from a large electronic database of patients in South East London. All patients 
with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder or bipolar disorder from 2008 to
