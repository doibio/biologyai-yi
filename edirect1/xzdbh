BACKGROUND: With an increase in life expectancy and improvement of surgical 
safety, more elderly patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), even with 
large tumors, are now considered for hepatectomy. This study aimed to clarify 
the impact of age on short- and long-term outcomes after major hepatectomy (≥3 
segments) for large HCC (≥5 cm).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Using a multicenter database, patients who underwent 
curative-intent major hepatectomy for large HCC between 2006 and 2016 were 
identified. Postoperative morbidity and mortality, overall survival (OS) and 
recurrence-free survival (RFS) were compared between the elderly (≥65 years) and 
younger (<65 years) patients. Univariable and multivariable Cox-regression 
analyses were performed to identify the risk factors of OS and RFS in the entire 
and elderly cohorts, respectively.
RESULTS: Of 830 patients, 92 (11.1%) and 738 (88.9%) were elderly and younger 
patients, respectively. There were no significant differences in postoperative 
30-day mortality and morbidity between the two groups (5.4% vs 2.6% and 43.5% vs 
38.3%, both P>0.05). The 5-year OS and RFS rates in elderly patients were also 
comparable to younger patients (35.0% vs 33.2% and 20.0% vs 20.8%, both P>0.05). 
In the entire cohort, multivariable Cox-regression analyses identified that old 
age was not independently associated with OS and RFS. However, in the elderly 
cohort, preoperative alpha-fetoprotein level >400 μg/L, multiple tumors, 
macrovascular invasion and microvascular invasion were independently associated 
with decreased OS and RFS.
CONCLUSION: Carefully selected elderly patients benefited from major hepatectomy 
for large HCC as much as younger patients, and their long-term prognosis was 
determined by preoperative alpha-fetoprotein level, tumor number and presence of 
macro- or micro-vascular invasion.

BACKGROUND: The development of antiretroviral drugs and subsequent access to 
combined antiretroviral therapy contributed to the decline in morbidity and 
mortality rates associated with acquired immune deficiency syndrome, resulting 
in an increased life expectancy and improved quality of life for people living 
with human immunodeficiency virus. However, a cluster of metabolic derangements 
such as dyslipidemia is increasing, especially for those on antiretroviral 
therapy. Limited studies were done on the prevalence of dyslipidemia and its 
associated factors among adult patients on antiretroviral therapy in Ethiopia 
which demand the conduct of the present investigation entitled on the prevalence 
of dyslipidemia and its associated factors among adult patients on 
antiretroviral therapy in Armed Force Comprehensive and Specialized Hospital 
Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, 2018.
METHODS: Institution-based cross-sectional study design was employed between 
March and April 2018. Systematic sampling method was used to select 353 study 
participants. Pretested stepwise approach of the World Health Organization 
questionnaire (WHO Stepwise), document review, anthropometric measurements, and 
laboratory analysis were used to collect data on different variables under the 
study. Collected data were entered in Epidata version 3 and analyzed by SPSS 
version 21.
RESULTS: The prevalence of dyslipidemia among study participants was 74.8%. 
Female participants were twice and half at risk of developing dyslipidemia 
compared to males (AOR= 2.38; 95% CI: 1.15, 3.66). Similarly, compared to those 
attended college level of education, not attended formal education (AOR=0.19; 
95% CI: 0.05, 0.66), and having primary/secondary educational level (AOR= 0.33; 
95% CI: 0.16, 0.66) showed lower odds to develop dyslipidemia. Furthermore, WHO 
clinical stage II (AOR= 0.35; 95% CI: 0.14,0.92), stage III (AOR=0.25; 95% 
CI:0.10,0.64), duration on ART (AOR= 1.01; 95% CI: 1.001,1.02), and BMI (AOR 
=1.13; 95% CI: 1.06,1.23) were significantly associated with dyslipidemia.
CONCLUSION: There exists a high prevalence of dyslipidemia among study 
participants. Sex, educational status, WHO clinical stage, duration on ART, and 
BMI were significantly associated factors for dyslipidemia. Intervention 
strategies including the identified factors are demanded in the setting.

In the aging society in Japan, the occurrence of multiple primary cancers has 
recently increased due to an increase in life expectancy and increased 
development in cancer diagnostic technology and improvement in treatment 
outcomes. However, few reports have focused on multiple primary cancers in 
patients with bone and soft tissue tumors. The present study aimed to analyze 
the clinical characteristics of patients with multiple malignancies of the bone 
and soft tissue. Between April 2008 and April 2017, among 973 patients treated 
at the Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Osaka City University Hospital, those 
with multiple primary cancers involving bone and soft tissue were identified. 
The number of cases with multiple cancers in the present study was 30/973 
(3.08%), including 21 males and 9 females. The median age at diagnosis of 
patients with bone and soft tissue sarcoma was 73.5 years (range, 7-83 years). 
There were 22 patients with double cancers, and 5, 2 and 1 patients with triple, 
quadruple and quintuple cancers, respectively. Colorectal cancer was the most 
common primary cancer (n=9). In total, 28.6% of patients had simultaneous 
cancer, while 71.4% of patients had heterochronous cancer. The overall 5-year 
survival for all patients was 75.6%. The prognosis of patients with double 
cancer of bone and soft tissue sarcoma was not necessarily poor. However, it is 
necessary to pay attention to the possibility of secondary malignancy. 
Therefore, it is essential to be careful and well organized when selecting 
treatment modalities and to adopt a logistical approach for the care of patients 
with ongoing multiple malignancies.

OBJECTIVE: To describe the levels and trends of point prevalence, annual 
incidence, and years lived with disability (YLD) for gout and its attributable 
risk factors in 195 countries and territories from 1990 to 2017 according to 
age, sex, and Sociodemographic Index (SDI; a composite of sociodemographic 
factors).
METHODS: Data were extracted from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2017 study. 
A comprehensive systematic review of databases and the disease-modeled analysis 
were performed by the GBD team at the Institute for Health Metrics and 
Evaluation, in collaboration with researchers and experts worldwide, to provide 
estimates at global, regional, and national levels during 1990 and 2017. Counts 
and age-standardized rates per 100,000 population, along with 95% uncertainty 
intervals (95% UIs), were reported for point prevalence, annual incidence, and 
YLD.
RESULTS: Globally, there were ~41.2 million (95% UI 36.7 million, 46.1 million) 
prevalent cases of gout, with 7.4 million incident cases per year (95% UI 6.6 
million, 8.5 million) and almost 1.3 million YLD (95% UI 0.87 million, 1.8 
million) in 2017. The global age-standardized point prevalence estimates and 
annual incidence rates in 2017 were 510.6 (95% UI 455.6, 570.3) and 91.8 (95% UI 
81.3, 104.1) cases per 100,000 population, respectively, an increase of 7.2% 
(95% UI 6.4%, 8.1%) and 5.5% (95% UI 4.8%, 6.3%) from 1990. The corresponding 
age-standardized YLD rate was 15.9 (95% UI 10.7, 21.8) cases per 100,000 
persons, a 7.2% increase (95% UI 5.9%, 8.6%) from 1990. In 2017, the global 
point prevalence estimates for gout were higher in males, and higher prevalence 
was seen in older age groups and increased with age for both males and females. 
The burden of gout was generally highest in developed regions and countries. The 
3 countries with the highest age-standardized point prevalence estimates of gout 
in 2017 were New Zealand (1,394.0 cases [95% UI 1,290.1, 1,500.9]), Australia 
(1,171.4 cases [95% UI 1,038.1, 1,322.9]), and the US (996.0 cases [95% UI 
923.1, 1,076.8]). The countries with the highest increases in age-standardized 
point prevalence estimates of gout from 1990 to 2017 were the US (34.7% [95% UI 
27.7%, 43.1%]), Canada (28.5% [95% UI 21.9%, 35.4%]), and Oman (28.0% [95% UI 
21.5%, 34.8%]). Globally, high body mass index and impaired kidney function 
accounted for 32.4% (95% UI 18.7%, 49.2%) and 15.3% (95% UI 13.5%, 17.1%), 
respectively, of YLD due to gout in the 2017 estimates. The YLD attributable to 
these risk factors were higher in males.
CONCLUSION: The burden of gout increased across the world from 1990 to 2017, 
with variations in point prevalence, annual incidence, and YLD between countries 
and territories. Besides improving the clinical management of disease, 
prevention and health promotion in communities to provide basic knowledge of the 
disease, risk factors, consequences, and effective treatment options (tailoring 
to high-risk groups such as the middle-aged male population) are crucial to 
avoid disease onset and hence to decrease the global disease burden.

OBJECTIVE: In 2007, the Ministry of Health (MoH) in Mexico implemented a 
multidisciplinary health-care model (MHC) for patients with type-2 diabetes 
(T2D), which has proven more effective in controlling this condition than the 
conventional health-care model (CHC).
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We compared the cost-effectiveness of the MHC vs. 
the CHC for patients with T2D using a quasi-experimental, retrospective design. 
Epidemiologic and cost data were obtained from a randomly selected sample of 
health-care units, using medical records as well as patient- and facility-level 
data. We modelled the cost-effectiveness of the MHC at one, 10 and 20 years 
using a simulation model.
RESULTS: The average cumulative costs per patient at 20 years were US$4,225 for 
the MHC and US$4,399 for the CHC. With a willingness to pay one gross domestic 
product (GDP) per capita per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) (US$8,910), the 
incremental net benefits per patient were US$1,450 and US$3,737 at 10 and 
20 years, respectively. The MHC was cost-effective from the third year onward; 
however, increasing coverage to 500 patients per year rendered it cost-effective 
at year one.
CONCLUSIONS: The MHC is cost-effective at 10 and 20 years. Cost-effectiveness 
can be achieved in the short term by increasing MHC coverage.

Cost-effectiveness of a proportionate universal offer of free exercise: Leeds 
Let's Get Active.

BACKGROUND: The purpose of this paper is to assess the cost-effectiveness of a 
proportionate universal programme to reduce physical inactivity (Leeds Let us 
Get Active (LLGA)) in adults.
METHODS: A continuous-time Markov chain model was developed to assess the cost 
implications and QALY gains associated with increases in physical activity 
levels across the adult population. A parametric survival analysis approach was 
applied to estimate the decay of intervention effect over time. Baseline model 
data were obtained from previous economic models, population-based surveys and 
other published literature. A cost-utility analysis was conducted from a health 
care sector perspective over the programme duration (39 months). Scenario and 
probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to test the robustness of 
cost-effectiveness results.
RESULTS: In total, 51 874 adult residents registered to the programme and 
provided baseline data,19.5% of which were living in deprived areas. Under base 
case assumptions, LLGA was found to be likely to be cost-effective. However, 
variations in key structural assumptions showed sensitivity of the results.
CONCLUSIONS: Results from this study suggest a non-negligible level of 
uncertainty regarding the effectiveness, and therefore, cost-effectiveness of a 
universal offer of free leisure centre-based exercise that targets hard to reach 
groups. Further data collection and a shift towards prospective evaluations are 
needed.

AIMS: There are only very few data on the prognostic value of stress 
cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) in elderly people, while life expectancy 
of the general population is steadily increasing. Therefore, this study aims to 
assess the prognostic value of vasodilator stress perfusion CMR in elderly 
>75 years.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Between 2008 and 2017, we included consecutive elderly 
>75 years without known coronary artery disease (CAD) referred for dipyridamole 
stress CMR. They were followed for the occurrence of major adverse 
cardiovascular events (MACE) including cardiac death or non-fatal myocardial 
infarction. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to determine the 
prognostic value of ischaemia or late gadolinium enhancement. Of 754 elderly 
individuals (82.0 ± 3.9 years, 48.4% men), 659 (87.4%) completed the follow-up 
with median follow-up of 4.7 years. Using Kaplan-Meier analysis, the presence of 
myocardial ischaemia was associated with the occurrence of MACE [hazard ratio 
(HR) 5.38, 95% confidence interval (CI): 3.56-9.56; P < 0.001]. In a 
multivariable Cox regression including clinical characteristics and CMR indexes, 
inducible ischaemia was an independent predictor of a higher incidence of MACE 
(HR 4.44, 95% CI: 2.51-7.86; P < 0.001). In patients without ischaemia, the 
occurrence of MACE was lower in women when compared with men (P < 0.01).
CONCLUSION: Stress CMR is safe and has discriminative prognostic value in 
elderly, with a significantly lower event rate of future cardiovascular event or 
death in subjects without ischaemia or infarction.

BACKGROUND: Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is a rare neurodegenerative disorder, 
and its parkinsonian variant can be difficult to delineate from Parkinson's 
disease (PD). Despite laryngeal dysfunction being associated with decreased life 
expectancy and quality of life, systematic assessments of laryngeal dysfunction 
in large cohorts are missing.
OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to systematically assess laryngeal 
dysfunction in MSA and PD and identify laryngeal symptoms that allow for 
differentiating MSA from PD.
METHODS: Patients with probable or possible MSA underwent flexible endoscopic 
evaluation of swallowing performing a systematic task protocol. Findings were 
compared with an age-matched PD cohort.
RESULTS: A total of 57 patients with MSA (64 [59-71] years; 35 women) were 
included, and task assessments during endoscopic examination compared with 57 
patients with PD (67 [60-73]; 28 women). Patients with MSA had a shorter disease 
duration (4 [3-5] years vs 7 [5-10]; P < 0.0001) and higher disease severity 
(Hoehn & Yahr stage 4 [3-4] vs 3 [2-4]; P < 0.0001). Of the patients with MSA, 
43.9% showed clinically overt laryngeal dysfunction with inspiratory stridor. 
During endoscopic task assessment, however, 93% of patients with MSA 
demonstrated laryngeal dysfunction in contrast with only 1.8% of patients with 
PD (P < 0.0001). Irregular arytenoid cartilages movements were present in 91.2% 
of patients with MSA, but in no patients with PD (P < 0.0001). Further findings 
included vocal fold motion impairment (75.4%), paradoxical vocal fold motion 
(33.3%), and vocal fold fixation (19.3%). One patient with PD showed vocal fold 
motion impairment.
CONCLUSION: Laryngeal movement disorders are highly prevalent in patients with 
MSA when assessed by a specific task protocol despite the lack of overt clinical 
symptoms. Our data suggest that irregular arytenoid cartilage movements could be 
used as a clinical marker to delineate MSA from PD with a specificity of 1.0 and 
sensitivity 0.9. © 2020 The Authors. Movement Disorders published by Wiley

Climate warming has substantially advanced spring leaf flushing, but winter 
chilling and photoperiod co-determine the leaf flushing process in ways that 
vary among species. As a result, the interspecific differences in spring 
phenology (IDSP) are expected to change with climate warming, which may, in 
turn, induce negative or positive ecological consequences. However, the temporal 
change of IDSP at large spatiotemporal scales remains unclear. In this study, we 
analyzed long-term in-situ observations (1951-2016) of six, coexisting temperate 
tree species from 305 sites across Central Europe and found that phenological 
ranking did not change when comparing the rapidly warming period 1984-2016 to 
the marginally warming period 1951-1983. However, the advance of leaf flushing 
was significantly larger in early-flushing species EFS (6.7 ± 0.3 days) than in 
late-flushing species LFS (5.9 ± 0.2 days) between the two periods, indicating 
extended IDSP. This IDSP extension could not be explained by differences in 
temperature sensitivity between EFS and LFS; however, climatic warming-induced 
heat accumulation effects on leaf flushing, which were linked to a greater heat 
requirement and higher photoperiod sensitivity in LFS, drove the shifts in IDSP. 
Continued climate warming is expected to further extend IDSP across temperate 
trees, with associated implications for ecosystem function.

Spinal metastases are a common manifestation of malignant tumors that can cause 
severe pain, spinal cord compression, pathological fractures, and hypercalcemia, 
and these clinical manifestations will ultimately reduce the health-related 
quality of life and even shorten life expectancy in patient with cancer. 
Effective management of spinal bone metastases requires multidisciplinary 
collaboration, including radiologists, surgeons, radiation oncologists, medical 
oncologists, and pain specialists. In the past few decades, conventional 
radiotherapy has been the most common form of radiotherapy, which can achieve 
favorable local control and pain relief; however, it lacks precise methods of 
delivering radiation and thus cannot provide sufficient tumoricidal dose. The 
advent of stereotactic radiosurgery has changed this situation by using highly 
focused radiation beams guided by 3-dimensional imaging to deliver a high 
biologic equivalent dose to the target region, and the spinal cord can be 
identified and excluded from the target volume to reduce the risk of 
radiation-induced myelopathy. Separation surgery can provide a 2- to 3-mm safe 
separation of tumor and spinal cord to avoid radiation-induced damage to the 
spinal cord. Targets for separation surgery include decompression of metastatic 
epidural spinal cord compression and spinal stabilization without partial or en 
bloc tumor resection. Combined with conventional radiotherapy, stereotactic 
radiosurgery can provide better local tumor control and pain relief. Several 
scoring systems have been developed to estimate the life expectancy of patients 
with spinal metastases treated with radiotherapy. Thorough understanding of 
radiotherapy-related knowledge including the dose-fractionation schedule, 
separation surgery, efficacy and safety, scoring systems, and feasibility of 
combination with other treatment methods is critical to providing optimal 
patient care.

PURPOSE: The purpose of this pilot study was to evaluate the feasibility, 
acceptability, and initial efficacy of adding a sleep extension intervention to 
a well-established diabetes prevention intervention among midlife women with 
short sleep duration at risk for type 2 diabetes.
METHODS: For this 2-group comparative design, 26 women with prediabetes or 
metabolic syndrome and sleep duration <7 hours were recruited from the community 
to participate in an 8-session diet and physical activity lifestyle intervention 
alone (L-alone) or L-alone plus a behavioral sleep intervention (L+Sleep). Body 
mass index (BMI), waist circumference, and other outcomes were compared at 
baseline and 3 and 6 months using analysis of covariance.
RESULTS: Incorporating a sleep intervention into lifestyle changes proved 
feasible and acceptable to midlife women at risk for type 2 diabetes. 
Significant decreases in BMI and waist circumference over time were observed in 
both groups, but comparative efficacy of L+Sleep versus L-alone yielded few 
group differences. Exploratory analysis indicated that women who increased their 
sleep to ≥7 h/night, regardless of group assignment, lost more weight than women 
who continued to report sleeping <7 h/night.
CONCLUSION: Adding sleep extension to a lifestyle change intervention proved 
feasible and satisfactory to participants, but initial efficacy did not 
differentiate the 2 intervention groups.

Feasibility and Acceptability of Heart Rate Variability Biofeedback in a Group 
of Veterans with Fibromyalgia.

Reneau M(1).

Author information:
(1)Integrative Pain Clinic, Ralph H. Johnson VA Medical Center, Charleston, SC, 
USA.

Objectives: To determine the feasibility and acceptability of a heart rate 
variability biofeedback (HRVB) protocol in a focus group of Veterans with 
fibromyalgia (FM). Design: A multimethod feasibility and acceptability study. 
Settings/location: A Veterans Health outpatient pain medicine clinic in the 
southern United States. Subjects: The researcher enrolled seven women and three 
men between the ages of 33 and 68 years with a diagnosis of FM. Interventions: 
Participants practiced HRVB on the emWave2 at home for 20 min twice daily for 7 
weeks. Outcome measures: Feasibility to adhere to the HRVB protocol was measured 
using the practice frequency and time (minutes) data collected from the emWave2. 
The author compared the individual reports from participants with the 
Credibility/Expectancy Questionnaire to measure the acceptability of the 
intervention. In addition, the principal investigator evaluated data from the 
Short-form McGill Pain Questionnaire (SFMQ) and the Revised Fibromyalgia Impact 
Questionnaire (FIQR) at the baseline and weekly study visits for a signal of 
efficacy for pain control, functional status, and quality of life (QOL). 
Results: The majority of participants (80%) expected 50% or more improvement in 
their pain, and (70%) felt HRVB would reduce their FM-related pain by 50%-80%. 
The mean daily practice frequency rate was 0.80. The mean practice duration was 
19.36 min. Pain score differences from the SFMQ were insignificant 
preintervention and postintervention. The mean total FIQR scores 
postintervention improved by 18.1 points. Conclusions: Findings suggest 
twice-daily HRVB practice protocol is not feasible. However, 20-min HRVB 
sessions were feasible and acceptable. Improved FIQR scores post-treatment 
suggest HRVB may be an effective strategy to improve functional status and QOL 
for Veterans with FM. ClinicalTrials.gov ID: Pro00079144.

treatment of schizophrenia in China.

Lin Z(1), Xuan J(1).

Author information:
(1)Health Economic Research Institute, Sun Yat-sen University , Guangzhou, 
China.

BACKGROUND: Orally disintegrating tablet (ODT) formulation of antipsychotics is 
one of the innovative drug delivery systems developed to improve medication 
adherence. We aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of aripiprazole ODT vs. 
aripiprazole standard oral tablet (SOT), as well as olanzapine SOT in China.
METHODS: We developed a discrete event simulation model from government payers' 
perspective. On the entry, 100,000 patients in each group were simulated for 
relapse, adverse events, changing adherence level, medication discontinuation, 
switching or quitting in response to three different medication adherence 
levels. The model projected quality adjusted life years (QALYs) and treatment 
costs over a 1-year time horizon. Parameter uncertainties were assessed through 
sensitivity analyses.
RESULTS: The QALYs per patient over 1-year treatment with aripiprazole ODT, 
aripiprazole SOT, or olanzapine SOT, were 0.7282, 0.7112, and 0.7218, 
respectively. The corresponding costs were $1,423, $2,215, and $1,493. In both 
comparisons, aripiprazole ODT was dominant. Compared with aripiprazole SOT and 
olanzapine SOT, the likelihood of aripiprazole ODT being cost-effective was 
99.2% and 69.2%, respectively, using 3 times per capita GDP per QALY as 
willingness-to-pay threshold.
CONCLUSIONS: The aripiprazole ODT is associated with more QALYs at lower costs 
compared with both aripiprazole SOT and olanzapine SOT in treating schizophrenia 
in China.

BACKGROUND: Hip fractures are one of the leading causes of disability and 
dependency among the elderly. The rate of hip fractures has been progressively 
increasing due to the continuing increase in average life expectancy. Surgical 
intervention is the mainstay of treatment, but with an increasing prevalence of 
comorbid conditions and decreased functional capacity in elderly patients, more 
patients are prone to postoperative complications.
OBJECTIVES: Assess the value of surgical intervention for hip fractures among 
the elderly by quantifying the 1-year mortality rate and assessing factors 
associated with mortality.
DESIGN: Medical record review.
SETTING: Tertiary care center.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: All patients 60 years o age or older who sustained a hip 
fracture between the period of 2008 to 2018 in a single tertiary healthcare 
center. Data was obtained from case files, using both electronic and paper 
files.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The 1-year mortality rate for hip fracture, postoperative 
complications and factors associated with mortality.
SAMPLE SIZE: 802 patients.
RESULTS: The majority of patients underwent surgical intervention (93%). Intra- 
and postoperative complications were 3% and 16%, respectively. Four percent of 
the sample died within 30 days, and 11% died within one year. In a multivariate 
analysis, an increased risk of 1-year mortality was associated with neck of 
femur fractures and postoperative complications (P=.034, <.001, respectively) 
CONCLUSION: The 1-year mortality risk in our study reinforces the importance of 
aggressive surgical intervention for hip fractures.
LIMITATION: Single-centered study.
CONFLICT OF INTEREST: None.

BACKGROUND: Anxiety and depression are common mental health problems among 
patients with cancer. While many psychological variables have been proven to 
influence anxiety and depressive symptoms, the variables are not mutually 
exclusive and their integrated effects on patients with oral cancer are yet 
unknown. The present study aims to explore the prevalence of anxiety and 
depressive symptoms among patients with oral cancer, to find out key potentially 
predictive factors associated with anxiety and depressive symptoms.
METHOD: A cross-sectional study was carried out for Chinese patients with oral 
cancer between May 2016 and October 2017 in two Grade-A Tertiary Hospitals in 
Shenyang, China. Two hundred thirty patients with oral cancer were interviewed 
with questionnaires on demographic variables, Zung Self-Rating Anxiety Scale 
(SAS), Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), Herth Hope 
Index (HHI), Social Impact Scale, Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social 
Support (MSPSS), Revised Life Orientation Test (LOT-R), Perceived Stress 
Scale-10 (PSS-10), and General Perceived Self-efficacy Scale(GSE). Chi-square 
test, nonparametric test, t-test and logistic regression analyses were conducted 
where appropriate to explore predictive factors of anxiety symptoms and 
depressive symptoms.
RESULTS: The prevalence of anxiety symptoms and depressive symptoms in the 
sample population was 36.96% (85/230) and 65.21% (150/230), respectively. Social 
isolation dimension of stigma (β = 0.436, OR = 1.547, CI:1.211 ~ 1.975), 
optimism (β = - 0.276, OR = 0.759, CI:0.624 ~ 0.922), and perceived stress 
(β = 0.217, OR = 1.243, CI:1.092 ~ 1.414) were predictors of anxiety symptoms. 
Marriage (β = 1.648, OR = 5.198, CI:1.427 ~ 18.924), positive readiness and 
expectancy dimension of hope (β = - 0.505, OR = 0.604, CI:0.395 ~ 0.923), social 
isolation dimension of stigma (β = 0.314, OR = 1.368, CI:1.054 ~ 1.776) and 
perceived stress (β = 0.273, OR = 1.314, CI:1.134 ~ 1.524) were predictors of 
depressive symptoms among oral cancer patients.
CONCLUSION: The prevalence of anxiety symptoms and depressive symptoms was high 
among oral cancer patients in China. The communal predictors of anxiety and 
depressive symptoms in patients with oral cancer were levels of perceived stress 
and social isolation of stigma. In addition, optimism was a predictor of anxiety 
symptoms and hope was a predictor of depressive symptoms.

BACKGROUND: Menopause and midlife are stages in a woman's life that can be 
marked by debilitating symptoms and increasing risks for cancer, cardiovascular, 
metabolic, and bone health issues. Walking represents a simple, low cost, and 
widely accessible activity with proven health benefits, though its therapeutic 
effect on alleviating menopause symptoms is not well characterized. Women are 
generally not opposed to exercise programs; however, increasing or maintaining 
exercise levels remains a challenge. We undertook a qualitative descriptive 
study to explore features of a walking program that would be conductive to 
menopausal women's participation, as well as to inform the development of such a 
program.
METHODS: We conducted focus groups with women recruited from two menopause 
clinics and who suffered from moderate to severe menopause symptoms. The focus 
groups were audio recorded and transcribed. Women were prompted to talk about 
their menopause experience and exercise practice and how they would envision a 
walking exercise program that would keep them engaged. Qualitative content 
analysis was used to analyze the data and to identify characteristics of a 
walking exercise program.
RESULTS: Twenty women participated in 5 focus groups. Women were very interested 
in trying walking as a means of staying healthy and possibly reducing menopause 
symptoms. Four major characteristics emerged as important for a walking program: 
(a) sensitivity to health realities of menopausal women, (b) inclusivity of 
various needs/levels of physical ability, (c) attentiveness to the need for 
mutual social support, (d) flexibility in planning of locations and scheduling. 
A restricted social network platform with features catering to women in 
menopause was suggested as suitable to initiate and sustain an adequate walking 
program.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study will be essential in designing a program 
that would be attractive for women to start and maintain a walking habit. The 
program would assist in elucidating whether walking is a useful and valuable 
alternative therapy for menopausal symptoms and, ultimately, might help women 
staying fit in midlife and postmenopausal.

OBJECTIVE: An ecological study using secondary open data from Japanese 
government statistics was conducted. The study aimed to verify differences in 
three measures of healthy life expectancy (HLE); namely, disability-free life 
expectancy without activity limitation (DFLE-AL), life expectancy with 
self-perceived health (LE-SH), and disability-free life expectancy without care 
need (DFLE-CN).
RESULTS: Each HLE from 47 prefectures in 2010, 2013, and 2016 was extended over 
time. There were strong Cronbach's coefficient alpha (α) between DFLE-AL and 
LE-SH (Minimum α; 0.80, Maximum α; 0.90) as well as between LE and DFLE-CN 
(Minimum α; 0.92, Maximum α; 0.99) in both sexes in every data year. However, 
the other pairs had weaker associations. In regression analysis with each HLE as 
a dependent variable and aging rate, mortality, the proportion of unhealthy 
people as independent variables, the subjective unhealthy rate had significant 
standardized partial regression coefficients (β) in models with DFLE-AL and 
LE-SH as dependent variables (Minimum β; - 0.56, Maximum β; - 0.34). Therefore, 
DFLE-CN tended to differ from the other HLEs. The subjective unhealthy rate had 
a significant influence on DFLE-AL and LE-SH.

Cancer is a fatal illness often caused by genetic disorder aggregation and a 
variety of pathological changes. Cancerous cells are abnormal areas often 
growing in any part of human body that are life-threatening. Cancer also known 
as tumor must be quickly and correctly detected in the initial stage to identify 
what might be beneficial for its cure. Even though modality has different 
considerations, such as complicated history, improper diagnostics and treatement 
that are main causes of deaths. The aim of the research is to analyze, review, 
categorize and address the current developments of human body cancer detection 
using machine learning techniques for breast, brain, lung, liver, skin cancer 
leukemia. The study highlights how cancer diagnosis, cure process is assisted 
using machine learning with supervised, unsupervised and deep learning 
techniques. Several state of art techniques are categorized under the same 
cluster and results are compared on benchmark datasets from accuracy, 
sensitivity, specificity, false-positive metrics. Finally, challenges are also 
highlighted for possible future work.

While genome-wide association studies have identified susceptibility variants 
for numerous traits, their combined utility for predicting broad measures of 
health, such as mortality, remains poorly understood. We used data from the UK 
Biobank to combine polygenic risk scores (PRS) for 13 diseases and 12 mortality 
risk factors into sex-specific composite PRS (cPRS). These cPRS were moderately 
associated with all-cause mortality in independent data within the UK Biobank: 
the estimated hazard ratios per standard deviation were 1.10 (95% confidence 
interval: 1.05, 1.16) and 1.15 (1.10, 1.19) for women and men, respectively.
