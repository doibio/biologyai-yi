BACKGROUND: Little is known about muscle morphology in people with hip-related 
pain, without signs of femoro-acetabular impingement syndrome (FAIS). 
Identifying changes in hip muscle volume, fatty infiltrate and establishing 
relationships between muscle volume and strength, may provide insight into 
potential early treatment strategies.
PURPOSES: To: (i) compare the volumes and fatty infiltrate of gluteus maximus, 
gluteus medius, gluteus minimis, tensor fascia latae and quadratus femoris 
between symptomatic and less-symptomatic sides of participants with hip-related 
pain; (ii) compare the volumes and fatty infiltrate of hip muscles between 
healthy controls and symptomatic participants; and (iii) explore relationships 
of hip muscle volumes to muscle strength and patient-reported outcome measures 
in people with hip-related pain.
STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study.
METHODS: Muscle volume and fatty infiltrate (from magnetic resonance imaging), 
hip muscle strength, patient-reported symptoms, function and quality of life 
(QOL) were determined for 16 participants with hip-related pain (no clinical 
signs of FAIS; 37±9 years) and 15 controls (31±9 years). Using One Way Analysis 
of Co-Variance tests, muscle volume and fatty infiltrate was compared between 
the symptomatic and less-symptomatic sides in participants with hip-related pain 
as well as between healthy controls and symptomatic participants. In addition, 
hip muscle volume was correlated with hip muscle strength, hip-reported 
symptoms, function and QOL.
RESULTS: No differences in all the studied muscle volumes or fatty infiltrate 
were identified between the symptomatic and less-symptomatic hips of people with 
hip-related pain; or between people with and without hip-related pain. Greater 
GMED volume on the symptomatic side was associated with less symptoms and better 
function and QOL (ρ=0.522-0.617) for those with hip-related pain. Larger GMAX 
volume was associated with greater hip abduction and internal rotation strength, 
larger GMED volume was associated with greater hip extension strength, and 
larger QF volume was associated with greater hip abduction strength 
(rho=0.507-0.638).
CONCLUSION: People with hip-related pain and no clinical signs of FAIS have hip 
muscle volumes that are not significantly different than those of matched 
pain-free controls or their less-symptomatic hip. Larger GMED muscle volume was 
associated with fewer symptoms and greater strength.

BACKGROUND: Dupuytren's disease is a common fibrotic condition that causes the 
fingers to flex irreversibly into the palm. Treatments for late-stage disease 
all have limitations, and there is no approved treatment for early-stage 
disease. We identified tumour necrosis factor as a therapeutic target in 
Dupuytren's disease, and in a dose ranging trial found 40 mg adalimumab in 0·4 
mL to be most efficacious. Here we aimed to assess the effects of intranodular 
injection of adalimumab in early-stage disease.
METHODS: In this phase 2b, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial 
adults with early-stage Dupuytren's disease and an established clinically 
distinct nodule with a clear history of progression in the preceding 6 months 
were recruited from two clinical centres in the UK and were randomly assigned 
1:1 to receive four injections of adalimumab or saline every 3 months. 
Participants and assessors were masked. The primary outcome was nodule hardness 
measured with a durometer at 12 months. Data were analysed by linear mixed 
effects regression models in the intention-to-treat population with multiple 
imputation for missing primary outcome data. The trial is registered at the 
ISRCTN registry, ISRCTN 27786905 and is complete.
FINDINGS: Between Feb 17, 2017, and Jan 11, 2019, 284 participants were screened 
in the UK and 140 were enrolled. 47 (34%) participants were female and 93 (66%) 
were male. Mean age of participants was 59·7 years (SD 10·0). Primary outcome 
data were available from 113 participants. Nodule hardness was lower (-4·6 AU 
[95% CI -7·1 to -2·2], p=0·0002) in the adalimumab compared with the saline 
group at 12 months. There were no related serious adverse events; the most 
common adverse events were minor injection site reactions.
INTERPRETATION: Intranodular injections of adalimumab in participants with 
early-stage Dupuytren's disease resulted in softening and reduction in size of 
the nodules. Longer follow-up would be required to assess the effect of tumour 
necrosis factor inhibition on disease progression, extension deficit and hand 
function.

OBJECTIVES: This study aims to understand the effectiveness of whole-body 
vibration (WBV) exercises performed with home exercise program in patients with 
post-polio syndrome (PPS) in terms of muscle strength, fatigue, the quality of 
life, and laboratory parameters.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between October 2015 and March 2016, a total of 14 
patients (7 males, 7 females; mean age: 45.1±6.6 years; range, 34 to 57 years) 
who were diagnosed with PPS were included in the study. The patients were 
randomized into two groups: the first group received WBV, home exercise program 
and patient education while the second (control) group received home exercise 
program and patient education. The patients were evaluated by knee isometric and 
isokinetic peak torque, Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), Fatigue Impact Scale 
(FIS), Nottingham Health Profile (NHP), serum creatine kinase, aspartate 
aminotransferase, and alanine aminotransferase at baseline and at the end of the 
treatment.
RESULTS: At the end of the treatment, the exercise program administered to the 
patients was found to be effective in increasing knee muscle strength in PPS 
patients (p<0.05). This difference was more apparent on the sequela side, 
isometric extension peak torque in the group with WBV. There was no significant 
change in the markers of muscle damage or NHP in both groups.
CONCLUSION: Inclusion of WBV in home exercise program in PPS patients does not 
seem to be superior, except for reducing the effect of fatigue on the patient's 
life.

INTRODUCTION: With an increasing life expectancy and proportion of older adults, 
the number of people in need of care services is also increasing. This study 
aimed to determine and describe various available care services for older 
persons reported in literature.
METHODS: English-language articles published between the years of 1990 and 2018 
in Scopus, ProQuest, PubMed, and Google Scholar databases or search engines were 
reviewed. The search resulted in 46,927 articles. All selected studies were 
systematically evaluated and screened based on title, abstract, and full text 
related to the study's objective. Finally, 246 articles were included in the 
study. The care services in older persons care systems were identified from the 
selected articles and were presented in extraction tables. Final conclusions 
were made based on the types of services provided and their frequency of 
citation.
RESULTS: The research results showed that numerous systems exist to provide care 
services for older adults, including long-term care services, home care 
services, housing for the aged, day care centres, senior centres, nursing homes, 
and hospice care services. Regarding older adults' care needs and the objectives 
and missions of each care system, different care services, such as personal 
care, social support services, medical care services, and nutrition services, 
have been identified in the service packages.
CONCLUSION: This study describes the diverse care services available for older 
persons that have been reported in the literature. Further research in different 
healthcare systems is required regarding what is most essential and lacking in 
each setting.

Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Shenzhen, P. R. China.

Patients diagnosed with radioiodine refractory thyroid cancer (RAIR-TC) are not 
amenable to novel 131 I therapy due to the reduced expression of sodium iodide 
symporter (Na+/I- symporter, NIS) and/or the impairment of NIS trafficking to 
the plasma membrane. RAIR-TC patients have a relatively poor prognosis with a 
mean life expectancy of 3-5 years, contributing to the majority of TC-associated 
mortality. Identifying RAIR-TC patients and selecting proper treatment 
strategies remain challenging for clinicians. In this review, we demonstrate the 
updated clinical scenarios or the so-called "definitions" of RAIR-TC suggested 
by several associations based on 131 I uptake ability and tumor response 
post-131 I therapy. We also discuss current knowledge of the molecular 
alterations involved in membrane-localized NIS loss, which provides a 
preclinical basis for the development of targeted therapies, in particular, 
tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), redifferentiation approaches, and immune 
checkpoint inhibitors.

BACKGROUND: Long-term preventive treatment such as treatment with statins should 
be reassessed among patients approaching end of life. The aim of the study was 
to describe the rate of discontinuation of statin treatment and factors 
associated with discontinuation in the 6 months before death.
METHODS: This study is a retrospective cohort study using national registers and 
blood test results from primary health care patients. Patients in the Copenhagen 
municipality, Denmark who died between 1997 and 2018 and were statin users 
during the 10-year period before death were included. We calculated the 
proportion who remained statin users in the 6-month period before death. Factors 
associated with discontinuation were tested using logistic regression.
RESULTS: A total of 55,591 decedents were included. More patients continued 
treatment (64%, n = 35,693) than discontinued (36%, n = 19,898) the last 6 
months of life. The 70 and 80 age groups had the lowest odds of discontinuing 
compared to the 90 (OR 1.59, 95% CI 0.93-2.72) and 100 (OR 3.11, 95% CI 
2.79-3.47) age groups. Increasing comorbidity score (OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.87; 0.90 
per 1-point increase) and use of statins for secondary prevention (OR 0.89, 95% 
CI 0.85; 0.93) reduced the likelihood of discontinuation as did a diagnosis of 
dementia, heart failure, or cancer.
CONCLUSION: A substantial portion of patients continued statin treatment near 
end of life. Efforts to promote rational statin use and discontinuation are 
required among patients with limited life expectancy, including establishing 
clear, practical recommendations about statin discontinuation, and initiatives 
to translate recommendations into clinical practice.

Myelofibrosis (MF) is a clonal myeloproliferative neoplasm, typically associated 
with disease-related symptoms, splenomegaly, cytopenias and bone marrow 
fibrosis. Patients experience a significant symptom burden and a reduced life 
expectancy. Patients with MF receive ruxolitinib as the current standard of 
care, but the depth and durability of responses and the percentage of patients 
achieving clinical outcome measures are limited; thus, a significant unmet 
medical need exists. Pelabresib is an investigational small-molecule bromodomain 
and extraterminal domain inhibitor currently in clinical development for MF. The 
aim of this article is to describe the design of the ongoing, global, phase III, 
double-blind, placebo-controlled MANIFEST-2 study evaluating the efficacy and 
safety of pelabresib and ruxolitinib versus placebo and ruxolitinib in patients 
with JAKi treatment-naive MF. Clinical Trial Registration: NCT04603495 
(ClinicalTrials.gov).

Plain Language Summary: Myelofibrosis (MF) is a rare type of blood cancer that 
interferes with the process of blood cell production by the bone marrow. In 
patients with MF, the bone marrow becomes overactive, leading to scarring and 
subsequently a lack of healthy blood cells being produced. The main symptoms of 
MF include anemia, fatigue, weakness and pain or discomfort in the abdomen. MF 
is associated with a shortened life expectancy. The current go-to treatment for 
MF is ruxolitinib. However, ruxolitinib has shown limited efficacy in improving 
clinical symptoms long term; so, new safe and effective treatments are needed. 
Pelabresib is a novel drug currently in clinical development for treating MF. 
The aim of this article is to describe the design of the ongoing, global phase 
III MANIFEST-2 study. MANIFEST-2 is evaluating the efficacy and safety of 
pelabresib and ruxolitinib versus placebo and ruxolitinib in patients with MF.

OBJECTIVE: In patients with cancer across the illness trajectory, treatment 
decisions are often influenced by one's perception of their prognosis (i.e., 
curability of disease, life expectancy, quality of life). However, research on 
how patients understand their prognosis (i.e., prognostic understanding) has 
been limited by simplistic measurement tools that fail to capture the complexity 
of the construct. This study describes the initial development of a measure of 
prognostic understanding: the Prognostic Understanding Perceptions Scale (PUPS) 
for use in patients with advanced cancer.
METHOD: An initial pool of 16 candidate items were developed through 
semi-structured interviews with 15 experts (oncology, psycho-oncology and 
palliative care professionals) and 30 advanced cancer patients. We investigated 
the dimensionality, internal item structure, item difficulty and item 
discrimination of the item pool using exploratory factor analysis (EFA), 
classical test theory (CTT) and item response theory (IRT) analyses. Convergent 
and divergent validity were based on correlations between PUPS, terminal illness 
acknowledgement, and self-report measures of depression, anxiety, hopelessness, 
and death acceptance.
RESULTS: The final measure was comprised of nine items encompassing three 
factors (perceived curability, illness trajectory, treatment options), yielding 
strong psychometric properties.
CONCLUSION: These results provide preliminarily support for PUPS as a 
multifaceted measure of prognostic understanding developed for use in patients 
with advanced cancer. Preliminary findings also highlight the potential utility 
of the PUPS for clinical settings, as a means of enhancing communication between 
patients and physicians.

Indonesia is located along the 'Thalassemia Belt' and a hotspot for 
hemoglobinopathies. Around 3.0-10.0% of the population carry β-thalassemia 
(β-thal) and 2.6-11.0% of the population carry α-thalassemia (α-thal). It is 
estimated that around 2500 babies are born with β-thal major (β-TM) each year. 
At present, the cornerstone of treatment for β-TM in Indonesia remains 
supportive, including blood transfusions and iron chelation therapy. 
Hemovigilance systems in some cities are poor and it increases the risk of 
transfusion-transmitted infections and transfusion reactions. The availability 
of iron chelators remains uncertain, even in some rural areas, iron chelators do 
not exist. The poor adherence to iron chelation therapy and maintaining 
pretransfusion hemoglobin (Hb) levels above 9.0 g/dL are still a major issue in 
Indonesia. The cost of blood transfusion and iron chelation are covered by 
national health insurance. In line with the rise of life expectancy, the 
financial burden of thalassemia in Indonesia is increasing sharply. Thus, 
optimizing preventive programs may be the most suitable option for the current 
thalassemia condition in Indonesia.

Background: Sorafenib and lenvatinib are multikinase inhibitors (MKIs) approved 
for patients with radioactive iodine-refractory (RAI-R) differentiated thyroid 
cancer (DTC). There is no consensus on when to initiate MKI treatment. The 
objective of this study was to evaluate time to symptomatic progression (TTSP) 
in patients with RAI-R DTC for whom the decision to treat with an MKI was made 
at study entry. Methods: International, prospective, open-label, 
noninterventional cohort study (NCT02303444). Eligible patients had asymptomatic 
progressive RAI-R DTC, with ≥1 lesion ≥1 cm in diameter and life expectancy ≥6 
months. The decision to treat with an MKI was at the treating physician's 
discretion. Primary endpoint was TTSP from study entry. Two cohorts were 
evaluated: patients for whom a decision to initiate an MKI was made at study 
entry (Cohort 1) and patients for whom there was a decision not to initiate an 
MKI at study entry (Cohort 2). Cohorts were compared descriptively. Results: The 
full analysis set (FAS) comprised 647 patients. The median duration of 
observation was 35.5 months (range <1-59.4). Of 344 MKI-treated patients, 209 
received sorafenib, 191 received lenvatinib, and 19 received another MKI at some 
point. Median TTSP was 55.4 months (interquartile range [IQR] 18.6-not estimable 
[NE]) overall, 55.4 months (IQR 15.2-NE) in Cohort 1 (n = 169), and 51.4 months 
(IQR 20.0-NE) in Cohort 2 (n = 478). TTSP ≥36 months was achieved in 64.5% of 
patients overall, 59.5% of patients in Cohort 1, and 66.4% of patients in Cohort 
2. Median overall survival from classification as RAI-R was 167 months and 
median progression-free survival from start of MKI therapy was 19.2 months and 
from start of sorafenib therapy 16.7 months. Among sorafenib-treated patients, 
70% had dose modifications, 35% had a dose reduction, 89% experienced ≥1 
treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE), and 82% experienced ≥1 drug-related 
TEAE. Conclusions: This real-world study provides valuable insight into outcomes 
in patients with asymptomatic, progressive RAI-R DTC under observation or 
receiving MKI treatment. TTSP in the FAS provides insight into the current 
prognosis for patients with RAI-R DTC in the era of MKIs. Registration: 
NCT02303444.

Following our previous reports on dual-action antibacterial and 
collagenesis-inducing hybrid peptide constructs based on "pentapeptide-4" (PP4, 
with amino acid sequence KTTKS), whose N-palmitoyl derivative is the well-known 
cosmeceutical ingredient Matrixyl, herein we disclose novel ionic liquid/PP4 
conjugates (IL-KTTKS). These conjugates present potent activity against either 
antibiotic-susceptible strains or multidrug resistant clinical isolates of both 
Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial species belonging to the so-called 
"ESKAPE" group of pathogens. Noteworthy, their antibacterial activity is 
preserved in simulated wound fluid, which anticipates an effective action in the 
setting of a real wound bed. Moreover, their collagenesis-inducing effects in 
vitro are comparable to or stronger than those of Matrixyl. Altogether, IL-KTTKS 
exert a triple antibacterial, antifungal, and collagenesis-inducing action in 
vitro. These findings provide solid grounds for us to advance IL-KTTKS 
conjugates as promising leads for future development of topical treatments for 
complicated skin and soft tissue infections (cSSTI). Further studies are 
envisaged to incorporate IL-conjugates into suitable nanoformulations, to reduce 
toxicity and/or improve resistance to proteolytic degradation. IMPORTANCE As 
life expectancy increases, diseases causing chronic wound infections become more 
prevalent. Diabetes, peripheral vascular diseases, and bedridden patients are 
often associated with non-healing wounds that become infected, resulting in high 
morbidity and mortality. This is exacerbated by the fact that microbes are 
becoming increasingly resistant to antibiotics, so efforts must converge toward 
finding efficient therapeutic alternatives. Recently, our team identified a new 
type of constructs that combine (i) peptides used in cosmetics to promote 
collagen formation with (ii) imidazolium-based ionic liquids, which have 
antimicrobial and skin penetration properties. These constructs have potent 
wide-spectrum antimicrobial action, including against multidrug-resistant 
Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, and fungi. Moreover, they can boost 
collagen formation. Hence, this is an unprecedented class of lead molecules 
toward development of a new topical medicine for chronically infected wounds.

OBJECTIVE: Isometric exercise training (IET) is established as an effective 
antihypertensive intervention. Despite this, the physiological mechanisms 
driving blood pressure (BP) reductions following IET are not well understood. 
Therefore, we aimed to perform the first meta-analysis of the mechanistic 
changes measured following IET.
METHODS: PubMed, Cochrane library and SPORTDiscus were systematically searched 
for randomized controlled trials published between January 2000 and December 
2021 reporting the effects of IET on resting BP and at least one secondary 
mechanistic parameter following a short-term intervention (2-12 weeks).
RESULTS: Eighteen studies with a pooled sample size of 628 participants were 
included in the final analysis. IET produced significant reductions in resting 
systolic and diastolic BP of 9.35 mmHg (95% confidence interval [CI] = -7.80 to 
-10.89, P  < 0.001) and 4.30 mmHg (CI = -3.01 to -5.60, P  < 0.001), 
respectively. Mechanistically, IET produced a statistically significant 
reduction in resting heart rate (mean difference [MD]: -1.55 bpm, CI = -0.14 to 
-2.96, P  = 0.031) and a significant increase in stroke volume (MD: 6.35 ml, 
CI = 0.35 to 12.60, P  = 0.038), with no significant change in cardiac output. 
Conversely, total peripheral resistance (TPR) significantly decreased following 
IET (MD: -100.38 dyne s -1 cm 5 , CI = -14.16 to -186.61, P  = 0.023), with 
significant improvements in the low frequency to high frequency heart rate 
variability ratio (MD: -0.41, CI = -0.09 to -0.73, P  = 0.013) and baroreceptor 
reflex sensitivity (MD: 7.43 ms/mmHg, P  < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: This work demonstrates that a reduction in TPR, potentially mediated 
through enhanced autonomic vasomotor control, is primarily responsible for BP 
reductions following IET. Furthermore, this novel analysis suggests wall squat 
interventions to be the most effective IET mode, with clinically relevant 
differences in BP reductions compared to handgrip and leg extension IET; 
although future direct comparative research is required.

The impact of COVID-19 on population health is recognised as being substantial, 
yet few studies have attempted to quantify to what extent infection causes mild 
or moderate symptoms only, requires hospital and/or ICU admission, results in 
prolonged and chronic illness, or leads to premature death. We aimed to quantify 
the total disease burden of acute COVID-19 in the Netherlands in 2020 using the 
disability-adjusted life-years (DALY) measure, and to investigate how burden 
varies between age-groups and occupations. Using standard methods and diverse 
data sources (mandatory notifications, population-level seroprevalence, hospital 
and ICU admissions, registered COVID-19 deaths, and the literature), we 
estimated years of life lost (YLL), years lived with disability, DALY and DALY 
per 100,000 population due to COVID-19, excluding post-acute sequelae, 
stratified by 5-year age-group and occupation category. The total disease burden 
due to acute COVID-19 was 286,100 (95% CI: 281,700-290,500) DALY, and the 
per-capita burden was 1640 (95% CI: 1620-1670) DALY/100,000, of which 99.4% 
consisted of YLL. The per-capita burden increased steeply with age, starting 
from 60 to 64 years, with relatively little burden estimated for persons under 
50 years old. SARS-CoV-2 infection and associated premature mortality was 
responsible for a considerable direct health burden in the Netherlands, despite 
extensive public health measures. DALY were much higher than for other 
high-burden infectious diseases, but lower than estimated for coronary heart 
disease. These findings are valuable for informing public health decision-makers 
regarding the expected COVID-19 health burden among population subgroups, and 
the possible gains from targeted preventative interventions.

enactment.

Effectively managing to-do lists and getting things done is a desirable 
competence. However, when things get difficult or demanding, many individuals 
struggle to put their intentions into subsequent actions. According to 
Personality Systems Interactions (PSI) theory, changes in positive affect are 
decisive for efficient intention enactment. Based on this understanding, in the 
present study we designed and evaluated an affect-focused intervention that 
practices shifting between high and low positive affect. In a control group 
design (N = 252, Mage = 26.40, SD = 10.24, range 18-66) the affective shifting 
intervention was contrasted against two other conditions (affective boosting and 
neutral). To test our assumptions, personal real-life intentions were assessed, 
and multifaceted measures (self-report, nonreactive) were applied and measured 
at different time points. To evaluate affective shifting, we tested 
interindividual benefits in the Stroop task. Additionally, we analyzed 
intervention effects on positive affect and intention enactment in real life. In 
line with our assumptions, we found that specifically those individuals who 
struggle with intention enactment (i.e., state-oriented) benefited in terms of 
better intention enactment ability in the Stroop task. Further, affective 
shifting fostered the decisive self-regulation of positive affect that directly 
improved intention enactment 3 weeks after the intervention. Lastly, affective 
shifting led to more self-coherent intention enactment, meaning a greater 
integration of Expectancy × Value considerations 3 weeks after the intervention. 
Discussion of our findings highlights the importance of theory-driven and 
affect-related interventions to close the gap between intention and action.

BACKGROUND: We report the first study to estimate the socioeconomic gap in 
period life expectancy (LE) and life years spent with and without complications 
in a national cohort of individuals with type 1 diabetes.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study used linked healthcare records from 
SCI-Diabetes, the population-based diabetes register of Scotland. We studied all 
individuals aged 50 and older with a diagnosis of type 1 diabetes who were alive 
and residing in Scotland on 1 January 2013 (N = 8591). We used the Scottish 
Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD) 2016 as an area-based measure of 
socioeconomic deprivation. For each individual, we constructed a history of 
transitions by capturing whether individuals developed retinopathy/maculopathy, 
cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, and diabetic foot, or died 
throughout the study period, which lasted until 31 December 2018. Using 
parametric multistate survival models, we estimated total and state-specific LE 
at an attained age of 50.
RESULTS: At age 50, remaining LE was 22.2 years (95% confidence interval (95% 
CI): 21.6 - 22.8) for males and 25.1 years (95% CI: 24.4 - 25.9) for females. 
Remaining LE at age 50 was around 8 years lower among the most deprived SIMD 
quintile when compared with the least deprived SIMD quintile: 18.7 years (95% 
CI: 17.5 - 19.9) vs. 26.3 years (95% CI: 24.5 - 28.1) among males, and 21.2 
years (95% CI: 19.7 - 22.7) vs. 29.3 years (95% CI: 27.5 - 31.1) among females. 
The gap in life years spent without complications was around 5 years between the 
most and the least deprived SIMD quintile: 4.9 years (95% CI: 3.6 - 6.1) vs. 9.3 
years (95% CI: 7.5 - 11.1) among males, and 5.3 years (95% CI: 3.7 - 6.9) vs. 
10.3 years (95% CI: 8.3 - 12.3) among females. SIMD differences in transition 
rates decreased marginally when controlling for time-updated information on risk 
factors such as HbA1c, blood pressure, BMI, or smoking.
CONCLUSIONS: In addition to societal interventions, tailored support to reduce 
the impact of diabetes is needed for individuals from low socioeconomic 
backgrounds, including access to innovations in management of diabetes and the 
prevention of complications.

OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate the cost-effectiveness of the add-on 
exenatide to conventional pharmacotherapy in patients with Parkinson's disease 
(PD) when considering the coexistence of diabetes mellitus (DM).
METHODS: We used the Keelung and Community-based Integrated Screening databases 
to understand the medical utilisation in the Hoehn and Yahr stages of patients 
with PD. A Markov model with 1-year cycle length and 50-year time horizon was 
used to assess the cost-effectiveness of add-on exenatide to conventional 
pharmacotherapy compared to conventional pharmacotherapy alone. All costs were 
adjusted to the value of the new Taiwanese dollar (NT$) as of the year 2020. 
One-way sensitivity and probability analyses were performed to test the 
robustness of the results.
RESULTS: From a societal perspective, the add-on exenatide brought an average of 
0.39 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained, and a cost increment of 
NT$104,744 per person in a 50-year horizon compared to conventional 
pharmacotherapy. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was NT$268,333 
per QALY gained. As the ICER was less than the gross domestic product per capita 
(NT$839,558), the add-on exenatide was considered to be very cost-effective in 
the two models, according to the World Health Organization recommendation. 
Add-on exenatide had a 96.9% probability of being cost-effective in patients 
with PD, and a 100% probability of being cost-effective in patients with PD and 
DM.
CONCLUSION: Add-on exenatide is cost-effective in PD combined with DM. 
Considering that DM may be a risk factor for neurodegenerative diseases, 
exenatide provides both clinical benefits and cost-effectiveness when 
considering both PD and DM.

The objective of this study was to establish whether specific organisms play 
important roles in the spoilage rate of vacuum-packed (VP) lamb at low storage 
temperatures. The spoilage potential of representative organisms (n = 13) of the 
spoilage community of VP lamb were investigated through a series of shelf-life 
challenge trials. Each isolate was individually inoculated onto sterile 
(irradiated) and non-sterile (i.e., containing natural microbial community) VP 
lamb meat. Meat quality was assessed over time by measuring sensorial qualities, 
bacterial growth and pH. Among all test organisms, Clostridium spp. had the 
highest spoilage potential and had a major effect on the spoilage rate of VP 
lamb (based on sensory assessment). C. estertheticum caused premature 'blown 
pack' spoilage; however, the spoilage was delayed in a community setting. C. 
putrefaciens and C. algidicarnis caused premature spoilage of VP lamb 
independently and in a community setting. In contrast, all facultative anaerobes 
and Pseudomonas sp. tested were not capable of spoiling meat independently or 
within a community, expect for Carnobacterium divergens and Serratia spp., which 
spoiled meat prematurely when present in a community. Overall, these results 
highlight that Clostridium could be one of the main taxa driving the faster rate 
of quality loss of chilled VP lamb compared to beef. This research can help to 
inform opportunities for shelf-life extension by targeting organisms with 'high' 
spoilage potential, such as Clostridium.
