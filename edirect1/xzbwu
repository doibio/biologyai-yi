The purpose of this study was to determine if simultaneous bilateral carpal 
tunnel release (CTR) is a cost-effective strategy compared with bilateral staged 
CTR for the treatment of bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome.
METHODS: A decision analytic model was created to compare the cost effectiveness 
of three strategies (ie, bilateral simultaneous CTR, bilateral staged CTR, and 
no treatment). Direct medical costs were estimated from 2013 Medicare 
reimbursement rates and wholesale drug costs in US dollars. Indirect costs were 
derived from consecutive patients undergoing unilateral or simultaneous 
bilateral CTR at our institution and from national average wages for 2013. 
Health state utility values were derived from a general population of volunteers 
using the Short Form-6 dimensions (SF-6D) health questionnaire.
RESULTS: Both surgical strategies were cost effective compared with the 
no-treatment strategy. Bilateral simultaneous CTR had lower total costs and 
higher total effectiveness than bilateral staged CTR, and had an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio of $921 per quality-adjusted life year compared with 
the no-treatment strategy. The conclusions of the analysis remained unchanged 
though all sensitivity analyses, displaying robustness against parameter 
uncertainty.
CONCLUSIONS: Surgical management is cost effective for the treatment of 
bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome. Bilateral simultaneous CTR, however, has lower 
total costs and higher total effectiveness compared with bilateral staged CTR.

Medical University, Shanghai, China.

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective study.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to compare the clinical outcomes between 
adolescent and young adult (AYA) patients and old adult patients with cervical 
chordoma who were treated surgically and present the surgical consideration for 
adolescents and young adults with cervical chordoma.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: With predominance in senior patients, chordoma is 
distinctively rare in AYAs. Because of the rarity of AYA chordoma, individual 
case report represents most of the literature on this disease entity on mobile 
spine and lack of long-term follow up, which leads to the paucity of clinical 
evidence for treatment planning and prognosis prediction.
METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted to investigate the prognosis of AYA 
patients with cervical chordoma who were treated surgically. We collected the 
clinical data of these patients and their older counterparts, and further 
compared the prognosis of the patients in different age groups. To estimate 
survival curves, Kaplan-Meier method was used, and significance was assessed 
using a log-rank test.
RESULTS: Forty consecutive patients with chordoma of the cervical spine treated 
in our institution were included in the study. Two groups were identified 
according to age. Group 1 comprised children and adolescents (age ≤ 25 yrs; 
n = 9) and Group 2 comprised adults (age > 25 years; n = 31). In comparison, 
Group 1 was featured by significantly higher rate of recurrence and shorter 
overall survival, although no difference found in the surgical modality between 
two groups.
CONCLUSION: There is a dismal prognosis in young patients with chordoma, and 
thus support the notion that as radical a total en bloc spondylectomy (TES) of 
the lesions as possible may benefit the overall survival of these young 
patients. Although the ensuing neurological deficits may be devastating, it will 
be worth sacrificing if the life expectancy of these young patients is 
prolonged.

In order to estimate the health losses caused by common risk factors in the 
Hubei province, China, we calculated the deaths and disability-adjusted life 
years (DALYs) attributable to 11 risk factors. We estimated the exposure 
distributions of risk factors in Hubei Province in 2013 from the monitoring 
system on chronic disease and related risk factors, combined with relative risk 
(RR) in order to calculate the population attributable fraction. Deaths and 
DALYs attributed to the selected risk factors were then estimated together with 
cause-specific deaths and DALYs. In total, 53.39% of the total deaths and 36.23% 
of the total DALYs in Hubei were a result of the 11 selected risk factors. The 
top five risk factors were high blood pressure, smoking, high body mass index, 
diet low in fruits and alcohol use, accounting for 14.68%, 12.57%, 6.03%, 3.90% 
and 3.19% of total deaths, respectively, and 9.41%, 7.22%, 4.42%, 2.51% and 
2.44% of total DALYs, respectively. These risk factors, especially high blood 
pressure, smoking and high body mass index, significantly influenced quality of 
life, causing a large number of deaths and DALYs. The burden of chronic disease 
could be substantially reduced if these risk factors were effectively 
controlled, which would allow people to enjoy healthier lives.

This study analyzed a cross-section of patients with severe chronic wounds and 
multiple comorbidities at an outpatient wound clinic, with regard to the 
cost-effectiveness and cost-benefit of negative pressure wound therapy 
(intervention) vs. no negative pressure wound therapy (control) at 1 and 2 
years. Medicare reimbursement charges for wound care were used to calculate 
costs. Amputation charges were assessed using diagnosis-related groups. 
Cost-benefit analysis was based on ulcer-free months and cost-effectiveness on 
quality-adjusted life-years. Undiscounted costs, benefits, quality-adjusted 
life-years, undiscounted and discounted incremental net health benefits, and 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated for unmatched and matched 
cohorts. There were 150 subjects in the intervention group and 154 controls 
before matching and 103 subjects in each of the matched cohorts. Time to heal 
for the intervention cohort was significantly shorter compared to the controls 
(270 vs. 635 days, p = 1.0 × 10-7 , matched cohorts). The intervention cohort 
had higher benefits and quality-adjusted life-year gains compared to the control 
cohort at years 1 and 2; by year 2, the gains were 68-73% higher. In the 
unmatched cohorts, the incremental net health benefit was $9,933 per ulcer-free 
month at year 2 for the intervention; the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
was -825,271 per quality-adjusted life-year gained (undiscounted costs and 
benefits). For the matched cohorts, the incremental net health benefits was only 
$1,371 per ulcer-free month for the intervention, but the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio was $366,683 per quality-adjusted life-year gained for 
year 2 (discounted costs and benefits). In a patient population with severe 
chronic wounds and serious comorbidities, negative pressure wound therapy 
resulted in faster healing wounds and was more cost-effective with greater 
cost-benefits than not using negative pressure wound therapy. Regarding overall 
cost-effectiveness, the intervention was still expensive, but that is the 
reality amidst limited treatment options for such serious cases of chronic 
wounds.

BACKGROUND: The impact of spontaneous neurobiological recovery is still 
neglected in designing rehabilitation trials early post stroke. We aimed to 
investigate the impact of the timing of randomization and prognostic 
stratification on the required sample sizes that are needed to reveal 
significant intervention effects on upper limb function at 26 weeks after 
first-ever ischemic stroke.
METHOD: Sample size calculations were based on a cohort study of 159 patients, 
using the Fugl-Meyer Assessment Upper Extremity and Action Research Arm Test as 
outcome measures (power = 80 %; two-tailed alpha = 0.05). We investigated 
different scenarios: random sampling of patients within five time intervals 
(stroke onset to 1, 3, 5, 8 and 12 weeks post stroke), and within stratified 
groups according to the presence or absence of voluntary extension of the thumb 
and/or two or more fingers at intake.
RESULTS: The heterogeneity between outcome scores of patients, and subsequently 
the required sample sizes, increased from the first to the fifth time interval. 
Compared to the whole group, the sample sizes for both stratified groups (i.e., 
patients with and without Voluntary Finger Extension (VFE)) were lower. The 
required sample sizes for the patient group without VFE markedly increased when 
the time interval was broadened from 1 to 12 weeks post stroke, as opposed to 
the decrease seen for the group of patients with VFE.
CONCLUSION: These results are fundamental for designing upper limb trials early 
post stroke. To prevent type II error, future upper limb trials should randomize 
patients at a fixed moment early post stroke and stratify patients according to 
their potential neurobiological recovery.

Using a health impact assessment framework, we estimated the population health 
effects arising from alternative land-use and transport policy initiatives in 
six cities. Land-use changes were modelled to reflect a compact city in which 
land-use density and diversity were increased and distances to public transport 
were reduced to produce low motorised mobility, namely a modal shift from 
private motor vehicles to walking, cycling, and public transport. The modelled 
compact city scenario resulted in health gains for all cities (for diabetes, 
cardiovascular disease, and respiratory disease) with overall health gains of 
420-826 disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) per 100 000 population. However, 
for moderate to highly motorised cities, such as Melbourne, London, and Boston, 
the compact city scenario predicted a small increase in road trauma for cyclists 
and pedestrians (health loss of between 34 and 41 DALYs per 100 000 population). 
The findings suggest that government policies need to actively pursue land-use 
elements-particularly a focus towards compact cities-that support a modal shift 
away from private motor vehicles towards walking, cycling, and low-emission 
public transport. At the same time, these policies need to ensure the provision 
of safe walking and cycling infrastructure. The findings highlight the 
opportunities for policy makers to positively influence the overall health of 
city populations.

Grafting of exogenous bioactive sites or functional motifs onto structurally 
stable scaffolds to gain new functions represents an important research 
direction in protein engineering. Some engineered proteins have been developed 
into therapeutic drugs. MeuNaTxα-3 (abbreviated as MT-3) is a newly 
characterized scorpion sodium channel toxin-like peptide isolated from the venom 
of the scorpion Mesobuthus eupeus, which contains a rigid scaffold highly 
similar to classical scorpion sodium channel toxins and an extension of eight 
amino acids in its J-loop region. This extended loop constitutes a flexible 
region extruded from the scaffold and could be substituted by exogenous 
functional sequences. In this study, we experimentally evaluated the scaffold 
potential of MT-3 through grafting two small antimicrobial motifs to replace 
residues within the loop. Functional assays showed that the two engineered 
molecules exhibited elevated antimicrobial potency, as compared with the 
unmodified scaffold, without structural disruption, providing experimental 
evidence in favor of MT-3 as a promising scaffold in protein engineering.

The cellular cytoskeleton forms the primary basis through which a cell governs 
the changes in size, shape, migration, proliferation, and forms the primary 
means through which the cells respond to their environment. Indeed, cell and 
tissue morphologies are used routinely not only to grade tumors but also in 
various high-content screening methods with an aim to identify new small 
molecules with therapeutic potential. This study examines the expression of 
various cytoskeleton regulators in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). GBM is a very 
aggressive disease with a low life expectancy even after chemo- and 
radiotherapy. Cancer cells of GBM are notorious for their invasiveness, ability 
to develop resistance to chemo- and radiotherapy, and to form secondary site 
tumors. This study aims to gain insight into cytoskeleton regulators in GBM 
cells and to understand the effect of various oncology drugs, including 
temozolomide, on cytoskeleton regulators. We compare the expression of various 
cytoskeleton regulators in GBM-derived tumor and normal tissue, CD133-postive 
and -negative cells from GBM and neural cells, and GBM stem-like and 
differentiated cells. In addition, the correlation between the expression of 
cytoskeleton regulators with the clinical outcome was examined to identify genes 
associated with longer patient survival. This was followed by a small molecule 
screening with US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved oncology drugs, 
and its effect on cellular cytoskeleton was compared to treatment with 
temozolomide. This study identifies various groups of cytoskeletal regulators 
that have an important effect on patient survival and tumor development. 
Importantly, this work highlights the advantage of using cytoskeleton regulators 
as biomarkers for assessing prognosis and treatment design for GBM.

It is well documented that adults with intellectual disability (ID) experience 
higher rates of a series of health conditions compared to their peers without 
disability. These health conditions include cardiovascular disease, obesity, 
diabetes, gastrointestinal disorders, and psychiatric and behavioral disorders. 
With life expectancy approximating the general population, adults with ID are 
also now experiencing health conditions related to aging, further increasing 
their risk for diminished function and well-being. This increased morbidity 
poses new challenges in geriatric healthcare planning for this population. 
Relatively simple health prevention practices, such as the implementation of a 
health screening tool, can substantially increase disease detection and clinical 
activities directed toward improved health outcomes for people with ID. This 
study examines data collected from the District of Columbia Developmental 
Disabilities Administration's (DC DDA's) health screening component of its 
Health and Wellness Standards. Findings are presented, along with 
recommendations and implications for improving preventive health screening 
practices in the ID population.

Populations in developed nations throughout the world are rapidly aging, and the 
search for geroprotectors, or anti-aging interventions, has never been more 
important. Yet while hundreds of geroprotectors have extended lifespan in animal 
models, none have yet been approved for widespread use in humans. GeroScope is a 
computational tool that can aid prediction of novel geroprotectors from existing 
human gene expression data. GeroScope maps expression differences between 
samples from young and old subjects to aging-related signaling pathways, then 
profiles pathway activation strength (PAS) for each condition. Known substances 
are then screened and ranked for those most likely to target differential 
pathways and mimic the young signalome. Here we used GeroScope and shortlisted 
ten substances, all of which have lifespan-extending effects in animal models, 
and tested 6 of them for geroprotective effects in senescent human fibroblast 
cultures. PD-98059, a highly selective MEK1 inhibitor, showed both 
life-prolonging and rejuvenating effects. Natural compounds like 
N-acetyl-L-cysteine, Myricetin and Epigallocatechin gallate also improved 
several senescence-associated properties and were further investigated with 
pathway analysis. This work not only highlights several potential geroprotectors 
for further study, but also serves as a proof-of-concept for GeroScope, 
Oncofinder and other PAS-based methods in streamlining drug prediction, 
repurposing and personalized medicine.

Triatoma infestans (Heteroptera: Reduviidae) Klug is the main vector of Chagas 
disease in Latin America. Resistance to deltamethrin was reported in Argentina 
and recently associated with reproductive and longevity trade-offs. The 
objectives of the present study were to describe the demographic consequences of 
deltamethrin resistance in T. infestans and to establish possible target stages 
for chemical control in susceptible and resistant colonies. A stage-classified 
matrix model was constructed based on the average stage length for susceptible, 
resistant and reciprocal matings' progeny. The differences between colonies were 
analysed by prospective and retrospective analysis. The life table parameters 
indicated reduced fecundity, fertility and population growth in resistant 
insects. The retrospective analysis suggested the latter was associated with 
lower reproductive output and increased fifth-instar nymph stage length. The 
prospective analysis suggested that the adult stage should be the main target 
for insecticide control. Although, fifth-instar nymphs should also be targeted 
when resistance has been detected. The presented results show demographic 
effects of deltamethrin resistance in T. infestans. While the older stages could 
be the main targets for chemical control, this approach is impeded by their 
higher tolerance to insecticides. It is concluded that the different mode of 
action insecticides would be more effective than a dose increase for the control 
of deltamethrin-resistant T. infestans.

Heart failure is a life-threatening disease with a growing incidence in the 
Netherlands. This growing incidence is related to increased life expectancy, 
improvement of survival after myocardial infarction and better treatment options 
for heart failure. As a consequence, the costs related to heart failure care 
will increase. Despite huge improvements in treatment, the prognosis remains 
unfavourable with high one-year mortality rates. The introduction of implantable 
devices such as implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICD) and cardiac 
resynchronisation therapy (CRT) has improved the overall survival of patients 
with chronic heart failure. However, after ICD implantation for primary 
prevention in heart failure a high percentage of patients never have appropriate 
ICD discharges. In addition 25-50 % of CRT patients have no therapeutic effect. 
Moreover, both ICDs and CRTs are associated with malfunction and complications 
(e. g. inappropriate shocks, infection). Last but not least is the relatively 
high cost of these devices. Therefore, it is essential, not only from a clinical 
but also from a socioeconomic point of view, to optimise the current selection 
criteria for ICD and CRT. This review focusses on the role of cardiac 
sympathetic hyperactivity in optimising ICD selection criteria. Cardiac 
sympathetic hyperactivity is related to fatal arrhythmias and can be 
non-invasively assessed with 123I-meta-iodobenzylguanide (123I-mIBG) 
scintigraphy. We conclude that cardiac sympathetic activity assessed with 
123I-mIBG scintigraphy is a promising tool to better identify patients who will 
benefit from ICD implantation.

BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) is a burdensome condition for individuals to 
live with and an increasingly costly condition for health services to treat. 
Cost-effective treatment strategies are required to delay the onset and slow the 
progression of diabetes related complications. The Diabetes Telephone Coaching 
Study (DTCS) demonstrated that telephone coaching is an intervention that may 
improve the risk factor status and diabetes management practices of people with 
T2DM. Measuring the cost effectiveness of this intervention is important to 
inform funding decisions that may facilitate the translation of this research 
into clinical practice. The purpose of this study is to assess the 
cost-effectiveness of telephone coaching, compared to usual diabetes care, in 
participants with poorly controlled T2DM.
METHODS: A cost utility analysis was undertaken using the United Kingdom 
Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) Outcomes Model to extrapolate outcomes 
collected at 6 months in the DTCS over a 10 year time horizon. The 
intervention's impact on life expectancy, quality-adjusted life expectancy 
(QALE) and costs was estimated. Costs were reported from a health system 
perspective. A 5 % discount rate was applied to all future costs and effects. 
One-way sensitivity analyses were conducted to reflect uncertainty surrounding 
key input parameters.
RESULTS: The intervention dominated the control condition in the base-case 
analysis, contributing to cost savings of $3327 per participant, along with 
non-significant improvements in QALE (0.2 QALE) and life expectancy (0.3 years).
CONCLUSIONS: The cost of delivering the telephone coaching intervention 
continuously, for 10 years, was fully recovered through cost savings and a trend 
towards net health benefits. Findings of cost savings and net health benefits 
are rare and should prove attractive to decision makers who will determine 
whether this intervention is implemented into clinical practice.

Central nervous system (CNS) diseases constitute a set of challenging 
pathological conditions concerning diagnosis and therapeutics. For most of these 
disorders, there is a lack of early diagnosis, biomarkers to allow proper 
follow-up of disease progression and effective therapeutic strategies to allow a 
persistent cure. The poor prognosis of most CNS diseases is, therefore, a global 
concern, especially regarding chronic age-related neurodegenerative disorders, 
which are already considered problems of public health due to the increasing 
average of life expectancy. The difficulties associated with the treatment of 
CNS diseases are owed, at least in part, to very specific characteristics of the 
brain and spinal cord, when compared to peripheral organs. In this regard, the 
CNS is physically and chemically protected by the blood-brain barrier (BBB), 
which, while maintaining essential brain homeostasis, significantly restricts 
the delivery of most therapeutic agents to the brain parenchyma. On the other 
hand, regenerative properties of the tissue are lacking, meaning that a CNS 
insult resulting in neuronal death is a permanent phenomenon. Approaches for 
transposing the BBB aiming to treat CNS diseases, relying on specific properties 
of nanosystems, have been reported for therapeutic delivery to CNS without 
interfering with the normal function of the brain. In this chapter, we address 
the latest advances concerning the principles of such approaches, employing 
lipid-based nanoparticles and cell-produced exosomes as drug and nucleic acid 
delivery systems, and summarize recent example of applications in the context of 
neurological diseases. Major achievements obtained in preclinical studies and 
the trends identified by these studies are emphasized to provide new prospects 
for further developments in this area, thus enabling us to move from the 
research realm to the clinical arena.

AIM: The aim of this study was to analyse gender differences in wellbeing, as 
related to work status, among working-age people with severe impairments.
METHODS: This study is based on register and survey data for a sample of 7298 
persons, drawn from the entire Swedish population of 15,515 working-age people 
16-64 years old who, at the end of 2010, received Sweden's unique personal 
assistance allowance, an allowance paid from the Swedish Social Insurance Agency 
(SSIA) to persons with severe impairments, enabling them to pay for assistants 
to support them in the functions of daily life. Logistic regression models were 
used to estimate the strength of relations between six measures of wellbeing, 
work status (not working, irregular work and regular work) and gender, together 
with key confounders.
RESULTS: Of the persons surveyed, 21% responded that they had regular work. 
Gender differences were found for all confounders, except for age. They were 
mostly in favour of men, which could reflect the general pattern in the labour 
market at large. Our results indicated there are substantial differences between 
non-working, irregularly working and working persons for several wellbeing 
aspects.
CONCLUSIONS: This study analyses the contributions to wellbeing of work 
participation among working-age people with severe impairments, with a focus on 
gender differences. The analysis shows that work is an important determinant of 
the six measures of wellbeing examined, where the relationship between work 
participation and wellbeing is especially strong for peoples' perceived standard 
of living. This major finding holds for both genders; however, the data show 
gender imbalance, in that compared with women, there was a larger percentage of 
men with severe impairments who have regular work. Future research should focus 
on finer distinctions between the types of work and the value added of personal 
assistants in the work context. Measures of general health not available for 
this study are needed to filter out a clearer picture of the interaction of work 
and well-being. Despite drawbacks, this study is nevertheless path-breaking in 
its focus on the value of work participation for the well-being of persons with 
severe impairments. For this reason, it provides a valuable extension of our 
knowledge and a clear point of departure for future studies.

AIM: To investigate the cost effectiveness of routine small bowel biopsies 
(SBBs) in patients with iron deficiency anemia (IDA) independent of their celiac 
disease (CD) serology test results.
METHODS: We used a state transition Markov model. Two strategies were compared: 
routine SBBs during esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) in all patients with IDA 
regardless their celiac serology status (strategy A) vs SBBs only in IDA 
patients with positive serology (strategy B). The main outcomes were quality 
adjusted life years (QALY), average cost and the incremental cost effectiveness 
ratio (ICER). One way sensitivity analysis was performed on all variables and 
two way sensitivity analysis on selected variables were done. In order to 
validate the results, a Monte Carlo simulation of 100 sample trials with 10, and 
an acceptability curve were performed.
RESULTS: Strategy A of routine SBBs yielded 19.888 QALYs with a cost of $218.10 
compared to 19.887 QALYs and $234.17 in strategy B. In terms of 
cost-effectiveness, strategy A was the dominant strategy, as long as the cost of 
SBBs stayed less than $67. In addition, the ICER of strategy A was preferable, 
providing the cost of biopsy stays under $77. Monte Carlo simulation 
demonstrated that strategy A yielded the same QALY but with lower costs than 
strategy B.
CONCLUSION: Our model suggests that EGD with routine SBBs is a cost-effective 
approach with improved QALYs in patients with IDA when the prevalence of CD is 
5% or greater. SBBs should be a routine screening tool for CD among patients 
with IDA, regardless of their celiac antibody status.

Tendon xanthoma are most commonly associated with Familial Hypercholesterolemia, 
but the differential diagnosis includes sitosterolemia and cerebrotendinous 
xanthomatosis (CTX). The case presented here is of a 48-year old male with large 
tendon xanthomas attributable to CTX. CTX is a rare, recessive disorder caused 
by mutations in the CYP27A1 gene. The resultant defect in bile acid synthesis 
leads to cholestanol deposition in different tissues in the body, including 
tendons. CTX is associated with neurologic symptoms and a reduced life 
expectancy. Treatment consists of bile acid supplementation in combination with 
a statin. When patients present with tendon xanthomas and FH is ruled out, 
clinicians should consider CTX as a possible diagnosis.

BACKGROUND: The adverse relation between dietary trans fatty acid (TFA) intake 
and coronary artery disease risk is well established. Many countries in the 
European Union (EU) and worldwide have implemented different policies to reduce 
the TFA intake of their populations.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the added value of EU-level 
action by estimating the cost-effectiveness of 3 possible EU-level policy 
measures to reduce population dietary TFA intake. This was calculated against a 
reference situation of not implementing any EU-level policy (i.e., by assuming 
only national or self-regulatory measures).
DESIGN: We developed a mathematical model to compare different policy options at 
the EU level: 1) to do nothing beyond the current state (reference situation), 
2) to impose mandatory TFA labeling of prepackaged foods, 3) to seek voluntary 
agreements toward further reducing industrially produced TFA (iTFA) content in 
foods, and 4) to impose a legislative limit for iTFA content in foods.
RESULTS: The model indicated that to impose an EU-level legal limit or to make 
voluntary agreements may, over the course of a lifetime (85 y), avoid the loss 
of 3.73 and 2.19 million disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), respectively, 
and save >51 and 23 billion euros when compared with the reference situation. 
Implementing mandatory TFA labeling can also avoid the loss of 0.98 million 
DALYs, but this option incurs more costs than it saves compared with the 
reference option.
CONCLUSIONS: The model indicates that there is added value of an EU-level 
action, either via a legal limit or through voluntary agreements, with the legal 
limit option producing the highest additional health benefits. Introducing 
mandatory TFA labeling for the EU common market may provide some additional 
health benefits; however, this would likely not be a cost-effective strategy.

Objectives To examine the prevalence of health consciousness regarding "Health 
Japan 21" (2nd edition) among the Japanese population, we conducted a telephone 
survey of a sample extracted randomly from the whole nation in 2013 and 
2014.Methods We extracted 1800 men and women with 150 persons for each gender 
and 10-year age group (6 age groups ranging from 20 years to 70 years and older) 
using Random Digital Dialing sampling. Each participant was asked about 1) 
recognition of the following items: "Health Japan 21," "healthy life 
expectancy," "metabolic syndrome (MetS)," "chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
(COPD)," "locomotive syndrome," "Active Guide," "WHO Framework Convention on 
Tobacco Control," and "Smart Life Project" and 2) health consciousness toward 
the following: "health examination taken within the past one year," "smoking 
status," and "the amount of vegetables considered desirable to consume per day 
for health." We performed simple tabulation of the collected answers and 
cross-tabulation by sex and age groups, respectively. For each question about 
recognition, we categorized "I know the name and meaning" and "I know the name 
but not the meaning" as "awareness." We compared data between 2013 and 2014, 
sexes, and age groups, using chi-squared test.Results In 2013, the top 5 items 
with high awareness were "MetS" (96.2%), "COPD" (51.1%), "healthy life 
expectancy" (34.2%), "locomotive syndrome" (30.2%), and "WHO Framework 
Convention on Tobacco Control" (28.0%). Moreover, awareness of "healthy life 
expectancy," "locomotive syndrome," and "Active Guide" were significantly higher 
in 2014 than in 2013. Meanwhile, the proportion of participants who correctly 
chose "350 grams" as "the desirable amount of vegetables to consume per day" was 
41.6% in 2013 and became significantly higher at 50.1% in 2014. In 2013, 
awareness of "healthy life expectancy," "COPD," and "locomotive syndrome" and 
the proportion of correct answers for "the desirable amount of vegetables to 
consume per day" were significantly higher among women than among men. In 2013, 
there were significant differences among age groups in awareness of "MetS," 
"COPD," "healthy life expectancy," and "locomotive syndrome" and the proportion 
of correct answers for "the desirable amount of vegetables to consume per 
day."Conclusion Awareness of "healthy life expectancy," "locomotive syndrome," 
and health consciousness of "the desirable amount of vegetables to consume per 
day" were significantly higher in 2014 than in 2013. There were discrepancies on 
respective items among both sexes and age groups. Therefore, interventions for 
groups with lower awareness or health consciousness may be required.

INTRODUCTION: Life expectancy is constantly increasing and as a consequence 
older men, frequently with multiple comorbidities, are seeking treatment for 
benign prostatic hyperplasia. Given their frail health, these men need extreme 
attention in their management, as efficacious and safe treatment strategies in 
the general population may not be adequate for them.
EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: The National Library of Medicine Database was searched for 
relevant articles published between 2006 and 2015. Each article's title, 
abstract and text were reviewed for their appropriateness and their relevance. 
57 articles were eligible for the review.
EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: In the elderly and frail, α1-antagonists should be used with 
caution given the risk of orthostatic hypotension and consequent falls, cause of 
significant morbidity in the elderly. 5ARIs present a good safety profile. 
Anticholinergics must also be prescribed with caution, given the risk of 
aggravating symptoms of dementia due to a central blockage of cholinergic 
neuronal pathways. Prostatic urethral lift is a medical device with low 
morbidity and valid functional results, which appear to endure over time. 
Prostatic artery embolization is demonstrating good results with minimal 
complication rates. Laser prostate vaporization or enucleation is also safe in 
elderly men and in those receiving anticoagulation therapy, due to its excellent 
hemostatic effect on prostatic tissue.
CONCLUSIONS: Urologists should be familiar with the safety and efficacy profile 
of medical and surgical therapy in the elderly population, given the inevitable 
increase in older patients which we will observe in the near future.
