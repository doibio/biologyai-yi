Older breast cancer patients often suffer from comorbid diseases, which may 
influence life expectancy. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of 
specific comorbidities on overall survival and distant recurrence free period 
(DRFP) of older breast cancer patients. Patients were included from the 
population-based FOCUS cohort which contains 3,672 breast cancer patients aged 
65 years or older. The impact of comorbidity on overall survival and DRFP was 
analyzed using multivariable Cox proportional hazard models and Poisson 
regression models. Median follow-up time was 6.8 years (range 0-14.0). 
Irrespective of age; the number of comorbid diseases was significantly 
associated with worse overall survival [hazard ratio (HR) per increasing number 
of comorbid diseases: 1.20, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.13-1.27 and HR 1.09, 
95 % CI 1.05-1.13 for age <75 and age ≥ 75, respectively]. Median follow-up time 
for DRFP was 5.7 years (range 0-14.0). An increasing number of comorbid diseases 
was associated with a decreasing risk of metastases among patients aged ≥ 75 (HR 
0.94, 95 % CI 0.87-1.02), whereas an increasing risk was shown for patients aged 
<75 (HR 1.09, 95 % CI 1.01-1.19). This study shows that in older breast cancer, 
patients overall survival and DRFP are influenced by comorbidity. This 
reiterates that patient outcome is not only influenced by breast cancer, and 
non-cancer-related factors should be taken into account.

BACKGROUND: Obesity is an abnormal accumulation of body fat directly 
proportional to reduced life expectancy. Treatment of this ailment should be 
preceded by proper and accurate assessment of the degree of obesity.
OBJECTIVES: The main objective is the justification of anthropometric empirical 
indicator (AEI) by the utilization of chest and pelvic radiographs, so that 
precise measurement of obesity on economical grounds can be manifested. Also, 
the subsequent objective is to establish a comparative scenario between dual 
energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and novel, portable, bioelectric impedance 
analysis (BIA)-based body composition analyzer, MI-105 (Meditech International 
Inc. India).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The cross-sectional design was adopted in the present 
study, in which 20 female participants from urban south India were involved. The 
measurements of body composition, anthropometry and chest (covering the region 
from neck to abdomen) as well as hip radiography of the studied population were 
acquired.
RESULTS: The higher significant difference of ≤0.001 was evidenced in all female 
studied population in the main body composition parameters measured by DXA and 
low-cost BIA. The same framework of significance is applicable to AEI, AEI 
(image morphed) and AEI (image automatic).
CONCLUSION: The novel-derived parameters: AEI (image morphed) and AEI (image 
automatic) can precisely gauge obesity and can be the effective alternatives for 
high-cost DXA. In addition, low-cost BIA-based body composition analyzer can 
also be the better substitute for DXA.

Treatment guidance for chronic hepatitis C (CHC) released by the American 
Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and the Infectious Diseases 
Society of America (IDSA) offers two options for interferon 
(IFN)-ineligible/intolerant individuals with genotype 1 infection: 
sofosbuvir/ribavirin (SOF/RBV) for 24 weeks or sofosbuvir/simeprevir (SOF/SMV) 
for 12 weeks. A 24-week course of SOF/RBV costs approximately US$169,000, with 
sustained virologic response (SVR) rates ranging from 52% to 84%; 12 weeks of 
SOF/SMV costs approximately $150,000, with SVR between 89% and 100%. Because 
SOF/SMV is currently used off-label, debate exists among physicians and payers 
about whether it should be prescribed and covered. This article presents a 
cost-effectiveness analysis of these two treatment regimens accounting for costs 
of drugs, treatment-related medical care, retreatment for individuals who do not 
achieve SVR, and natural history of continued HCV infection after failed 
retreatment. Analysis uses a Markov model with a lifetime horizon and a societal 
perspective. In the base-case scenario, SOF/SMV dominated SOF/RBV in a modeled 
50-year-old cohort of treatment-naïve and -experienced subjects, excluding those 
who failed earlier therapy with telaprevir or boceprevir. SOF/SMV yielded lower 
costs and more quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) for the average subject, 
compared to SOF/RBV ($165,336 and 14.69 QALYs vs. $243,586 and 14.45 QALYs, 
respectively). In base-case cost analysis, the SOF/SMV treatment strategy saved 
$91,590 per SVR, compared to SOF/RBV. Under all one-way sensitivity scenarios, 
SOF/SMV remained dominant and resulted in cost savings.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that a 12-week course of SOF/SMV is a more 
cost-effective treatment for genotype 1 CHC than 24 weeks of SOF/RBV among 
IFN-ineligible/intolerant individuals, supporting the AASLD/IDSA guidance and 
offering implications for both clinical and regulatory decision making as well 
as pharmaceutical pricing.

Because of the ongoing debate on the benefit of ultrasound (US) screening for 
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), we assessed the impact of screening on hepatitis 
C virus (HCV)-related compensated cirrhosis patients aware of their HCV status. 
A Markov model simulated progression from HCC diagnosis to death in 700 patients 
with HCV-related compensated cirrhosis aware of their HCV status to estimate 
life expectancy (LE) and cumulative death at 5 years. Five scenarios were 
compared: S1, no screening; S2, screening by currently existing practices (57% 
access and effectiveness leading to the diagnosis of 42% at Barcelona Clinic 
Liver Cancer stage [BCLC-0/A]); S3, S2 with increased access (97%); S4, S2 with 
an efficacy of screening close to that achieved in a randomized controlled trial 
leading to the diagnosis of 87% of patients at stage BCLC-0/A; S5, S3+S4. The 
analysis was corrected for lead-time bias. Currently existing practices of HCC 
screening increased LE by 11 months and reduced HCC mortality at 5 years by 6% 
compared to no screening (P = 0.0013). Compared to current screening practices, 
we found that: 1) increasing the rate of access to screening would increase LE 
by 7 months and reduce HCC mortality at 5 years by 5% (P = 0.045); 2) optimal 
screening would increase LE by 14 months and reduce HCC mortality at 5 years by 
9% (P = 0.0002); 3) the combination of an increased rate of access and optimal 
effectiveness of HCC screening would increase LE by 31 months and decrease HCC 
mortality at 5 years by 20% (P < 0.0001).
CONCLUSION: The present study shows that US screening for HCC in patients with 
compensated HCV-related cirrhosis aware of their HCV status improves survival 
and emphasizes the crucial role of screening effectiveness.

Cost-effectiveness analysis and insurance coverage: solving a puzzle.

Pauly M(1).

Author information:

Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.

The conventional model for the use of cost-effectiveness analysis for health 
programs involves determining whether the cost per unit of effectiveness of the 
program is lower than some socially determined maximum acceptable cost per unit 
of effectiveness. If a program is better by this criterion, the policy 
implication is that it should be implemented by full coverage of its cost by 
insurance; if not, the program should not be implemented. This paper examines 
the unanswered question of how cost-effectiveness analysis should be performed 
and interpreted when insurance coverage may involve cost sharing. It explores 
the question of how cost sharing should be related to the magnitude of a 
cost-effectiveness ratio. A common view that cost sharing should vary inversely 
with program cost-effectiveness is shown to be incorrect. A key issue in correct 
analysis is whether there is heterogeneity in marginal effectiveness of care 
that cannot be perceived by the social planner but is known by the demander. It 
is possible that some programs that would fail the social efficiency test at 
full coverage will be acceptable with positive cost sharing. Combining 
individual and social preferences affects both the choice of programs and the 
extent of cost sharing.

Engineering of a bispecific affibody molecule towards HER2 and HER3 by addition 
of an albumin-binding domain allows for affinity purification and in vivo 
half-life extension.

Emerging strategies in cancer biotherapy include the generation and application 
of bispecific antibodies, targeting two tumor-associated antigens for improved 
tumor selectivity and potency. Here, an alternative format for bispecific 
molecules was designed and investigated, in which two Affibody molecules were 
linked by an albumin-binding domain (ABD). Affibody molecules are small (6 kDa) 
affinity proteins and this new format allows for engineering of molecules with 
similar function as full-length bispecific antibodies, but in a dramatically 
smaller size (around eight-fold smaller). The ABD was intended to function both 
as a tag for affinity purification as well as for in vivo half-life extension in 
future preclinical and clinical investigations. Affinity-purified bispecific 
Affibody molecules, targeting HER2 and HER3, showed simultaneous binding to the 
three target proteins (HER2, HER3, and albumin) when investigated in biosensor 
assays. Moreover, simultaneous interactions with the receptors and albumin were 
demonstrated using flow cytometry on cancer cells. The bispecific Affibody 
molecules were also able to block ligand-induced phosphorylation of the HER 
receptors, indicating an anti-proliferative effect. We believe that this compact 
and flexible format has great potential for developing new potent bispecific 
affinity proteins in the future, as it combines the benefits of a small size 
(e.g. improved tissue penetration and reduced cost of goods) with a long 
circulatory half-life.

BACKGROUND: Duloxetine hydrochloride, a selective serotonin (5-HT) and 
norepinephrine (NE) reuptake inhibitor, is relatively balanced in its affinity 
for both 5-HT and NE reuptake inhibition and is the first US Food and Drug 
Administration-approved prescription drug for the management of diabetic 
peripheral neuropathic pain (DPNP).
OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine whether management of DPNP 
with duloxetine interferes with the treatment of diabetes. It also examined the 
tolerability of long-term exposure to duloxetine with regard to the progression 
of diabetic complications, and assessed the impact of DPNP management with 
duloxetine versus routine care.
METHODS: This was a 52-week, multicenter, re-randomized, open-label extension of 
a parallel, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, acute (12-week) study. 
Patients who completed the duloxetine or placebo acute treatment period were 
randomly reassigned in a 2:1 ratio to treatment with duloxetine 60 mg BID or 
routine care for an additional 52 weeks. The study included male and female 
outpatients aged ≥18 years with a diagnosis of DPNP caused by type 1 or type 2 
diabetes. Over the course of the 52-week study, visits were scheduled on the 
following weeks (of the extension phase of the study): 1 (via phone only), 2, 4, 
8, 12, 20, 28, 40, and 52. Tolerability was assessed by review and analyses of 
discontinuation rates, adverse events (AEs), laboratory data, vital signs, 
electrocardiographic results, concomitant medications, and diabetic 
complications. Treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) were defined as AEs that appeared 
during therapy (were not present at baseline) or were exacerbated during 
treatment. Data on AEs and concomitant medications were collected at every 
visit. Data on blood pressure, heart rate, and significant hypoglycemic events 
were collected at every visit starting from week 2. Fasting clinical chemistry 
and electrolyte group laboratory assessments were done at every visit, starting 
from week 4. Electrocardiographic data was collected at weeks 4 and 52, and 
glycosylated hemoglobin and lipid profile data were collected at weeks 20 and 
52. Hematology and urinalysis laboratory assessments and diabetic complication 
assessments were done at week 52. All safety data was assessed in cases of early 
discontinuation. Treatment differences on quality of life (QOL) were compared 
using the Short Form-36 Health Status Survey (SF-36) and the EQ-5D instrument of 
the European Health-Related Quality of Life Measures. This was assessed at the 
last visit or at early discontinuation.
RESULTS: The open-label extension-phase study included 337 patients (duloxetine, 
n = 222; routine care, n = 115). For the duloxetine group, mean age was 60.2 
years, 61.3% were male, and 78.4% were white. For the routine-care group, mean 
age was 58.9 years, 60.0% were male, and 74.8% were white. Mean weight was 95.3 
kg for both groups. None of the TEAEs occurred significantly more often in the 
duloxetine-treated group than in the routine-care-treated group. No TEAEs were 
reported by >10% of patients in the duloxetine group. The TEAEs reported by >10% 
of patients in the routine-care group included dizziness (11.3%), somnolence 
(13.0%), headache (10.4%), and vomiting (10.4%). No significant differences were 
found between treatment groups in the occurrence of serious AEs or in the number 
of patients discontinuing because of AEs. Duloxetine was significantly better 
than routine care on the bodily pain subscale of the SF-36 (mean change: 1.5 vs 
-4.1; P= 0.021) and on the EQ-5D (mean change: -0.00 vs -0.09; P = 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Over 52 weeks of follow-up, treatment of these diabetic patients 
with duloxetine for peripheral neuropathic pain was associated with outcomes 
similar to, or significantly better than, that of routine care on most measures 
of tolerability, diabetic complications, and QOL.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Although there is supporting evidence for the stress 
generation hypothesis (i.e., the tendency for depression-prone individuals to 
experience more negative dependent events influenced by their behaviors and 
characteristics), additional research is required to advance current 
understanding of the specific types of dependent events relevant to this effect. 
The present study elaborated on the stress generation hypothesis, in which the 
content of negative dependent events experienced by individuals is contingent 
upon, and matches, the nature of their particular vulnerabilities. This 
extension was tested within the context of Cole's competency-based model of 
depression.
DESIGN: Participants (n=185) were assessed at two time-points separated by a 
four-month interval.
METHODS: Self-perceived competence in academic, social, and appearance domains 
at the initial time-point were examined in relation to negative life events 
prospectively occurring over the four-month follow-up period, assessed using the 
"contextual threat" method.
RESULTS: Partial support was obtained for vulnerability-specific stress 
generation. Stress-generation specificity was found for self-perceived 
competence in appearance and academic domains, but not for self-perceived social 
competence.
CONCLUSIONS: The current findings are consistent with the possibility of a more 
complex relation between self-perceived social competence and domain-congruent 
stress generation. Individuals may be more likely to experience negative 
dependent events in domains matching their specific vulnerabilities.

BACKGROUND: In the late 1990s, new developments in knee replacement were 
identified as a priority for research within the NHS. The newer forms of 
arthroplasty were more expensive and information was needed on their safety and 
cost-effectiveness.
OBJECTIVES: The Knee Arthroplasty Trial examined the clinical effectiveness and 
cost-effectiveness of four aspects of knee replacement surgery: patellar 
resurfacing, mobile bearings, all-polyethylene tibial components and 
unicompartmental replacement.
DESIGN: This study comprised a partial factorial, pragmatic, multicentre 
randomised controlled trial with a trial-based cost-utility analysis which was 
conducted from the perspective of the NHS and the patients treated. Allocation 
was computer generated in a 1 : 1 ratio using a central system, stratified by 
eligible comparisons and surgeon, minimised by participant age, gender and site 
of disease. Surgeons were not blinded to allocated procedures. Participants were 
unblinded if they requested to know the prosthesis they received.
SETTING: The setting for the trial was UK secondary care.
PARTICIPANTS: Patients were eligible for inclusion if a decision had been made 
for them to have primary knee replacement surgery. Patients were recruited to 
comparisons for which the surgeon was in equipoise about which type of operation 
was most suitable.
INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomised to receive a knee replacement with the 
following: patellar resurfacing or no patellar resurfacing irrespective of the 
design of the prosthesis used; a mobile bearing between the tibial and femoral 
components or a bearing fixed to the tibial component; a tibial component made 
of either only high-density polyethylene ('all polyethylene') or a polyethylene 
bearing fixed to a metal backing plate with attached stem; or unicompartmental 
or total knee replacement.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was the Oxford Knee Score (OKS). 
Other outcomes were Short Form 12; EuroQol 5D; intraoperative and postoperative 
complications; additional surgery; cost; and cost-effectiveness. Patients were 
followed up for a median of 10 years; the economic evaluation took a 10-year 
time horizon, discounting costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) at 3.5% 
per annum.
RESULTS: A total of 116 surgeons in 34 centres participated and 2352 
participants were randomised: 1715 in patellar resurfacing; 539 in mobile 
bearing; 409 in all-polyethylene tibial component; and 34 in the 
unicompartmental comparisons. Of those randomised, 345 were randomised to two 
comparisons. We can be more than 95% confident that patellar resurfacing is 
cost-effective, despite there being no significant difference in clinical 
outcomes, because of increased QALYs [0.187; 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.025 
to 0.399] and reduced costs (-£104; 95% CI -£630 to £423). We found no definite 
advantage or disadvantage of mobile bearings in OKS, quality of life, 
reoperation and revision rates or cost-effectiveness. We found improved 
functional results for metal-backed tibias: complication, reoperation and 
revision rates were similar. The metal-backed tibia was cost-effective 
(particularly in the elderly), costing £35 per QALY gained.
CONCLUSIONS: The results provide evidence to support the routine resurfacing of 
the patella and the use of metal-backed tibial components even in the elderly. 
Further follow-up is required to assess the stability of these findings over 
time and to inform the decision between mobile and fixed bearings.

BACKGROUND: Collaborative care programmes lead to better outcomes in the 
management of depression. A programme of this nature has demonstrated its 
effectiveness in primary care in Spain. Our objective was to evaluate the 
cost-effectiveness of this programme compared to usual care.
METHODS: A bottom-up cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted within a 
randomized controlled trial (2007-2010). The intervention consisted of a 
collaborative care programme with clinical, educational and organizational 
procedures. Outcomes were monitored over a 12 months period. Primary outcomes 
were incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER): mean differences in costs 
divided by quality-adjusted life years (QALY) and mean differences in costs 
divided by depression-free days (DFD). Analyses were performed from a healthcare 
system perspective (considering healthcare costs) and from a society perspective 
(including healthcare costs plus loss of productivity costs).
RESULTS: Three hundred and thirty-eight adult patients with major depression 
were assessed at baseline. Only patients with complete data were included in the 
primary analysis (166 in the intervention group and 126 in the control group). 
From a healthcare perspective, the average incremental cost of the programme 
compared to usual care was €182.53 (p<0.001). Incremental effectiveness was 
0.045 QALY (p=0.017) and 40.09 DFD (p=0.011). ICERs were €4,056/QALY and 
€4.55/DFD. These estimates and their uncertainty are graphically represented in 
the cost-effectiveness plane.
LIMITATIONS: The amount of 13.6% of patients with incomplete data may have 
introduced a bias. Available data about non-healthcare costs were limited, 
although they may represent most of the total cost of depression.
CONCLUSIONS: The intervention yields better outcomes than usual care with a 
modest increase in costs, resulting in favourable ICERs. This supports the 
recommendation for its implementation.

Crude rates such as the crude death rate are functions of both the age-specific 
rates and the age composition of a population. However, differences in the age 
structure between two populations or two time periods can result in specious 
differences in the corresponding crude rates making direct comparisons between 
populations or across time inappropriate. Therefore, when comparing crude rates 
between populations, it is desirable to eliminate or minimize the influence of 
age composition. This task is accomplished by using a standard age structure 
yielding an age-standardized rate. This paper proposes an updated International 
Network for the Demographic Evaluation of Populations and Their Health (INDEPTH) 
standard for use in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) based on newly 
available data from the health and demographic surveillance system site members 
of the INDEPTH network located throughout Africa and southern Asia. The updated 
INDEPTH standard should better reflect the age structure of LMICs and result in 
more accurate health indicators and demographic rates. We demonstrate use of the 
new INDEPTH standard along with several existing 'world' standards and show how 
resulting age-standardized crude deaths rates differ when using the various 
standard age compositions.

BACKGROUND: Spinal muscular atrophy is a rare hereditary neuromuscular disorder 
(with a prevalence of 1 per 30,000) that greatly debilitates patients and, in 
most cases, shortens their life expectancy. Although there is no causal therapy, 
improvements in symptomatic therapy have extended patients' life expectancy and 
increased their quality of life. Unfortunately, the advancements in care vary 
from country to country. To improve the care for children with spinal muscular 
atrophy in the Czech Republic, we created a survey to obtain the baseline 
information about their quality of life and compared the data with equivalent 
data from the United States.
METHODS: We used the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory 3.0 Neuromuscular 
Measurement Model, which is a health-related quality of life questionnaire 
specific to children with neuromuscular disorders. The survey was conducted on 
35 children with genetically proven spinal muscular atrophy and their parents.
RESULTS: Compared with the US data, the Czech data generally show a lower 
quality of life, mainly in the family resources part. The greatest score was 
achieved in the section about communication. Altogether, the parents' scores are 
lower than those of the children.
CONCLUSION: In the Czech Republic, patients with spinal muscular atrophy and, 
especially their parents, have a significantly lower quality of life compared 
with US patients, mostly because of economic factors and a lack of social 
support. Our results reveal areas toward which improvement should be directed. 
The need for family support through social care as well as civic, patient, or 
organizational support is accentuated.

OBJECTIVE: There is a lack of clarity in the literature regarding the 
cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of antidepressants for treating real-world 
patients. The impact of comorbid cardiovascular disease (CVD) on the economic 
evaluations of antidepressants remains to be determined.
METHOD: Adult patients prescribed with antidepressants for depression were 
identified from the National Health Insurance Research Database in Taiwan. A 
cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analysis was conducted comparing selective 
serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake 
inhibitors (SNRIs), and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and by the presence of 
comorbid CVD.
RESULTS: In terms of treatment success rates, SSRIs were the most cost-effective 
option compared to TCAs and SNRIs as revealed in the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios. The cost-effectiveness acceptability curves further 
showed differential findings in the cost-utility results by the presence of 
comorbid CVD.
CONCLUSION: To improve treatment success rates and quality-adjusted life years, 
SSRIs can be considered the most cost-effective option. Future research is 
needed to further clarify the impacts of physical comorbidities and other 
associated factors on the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of pharmacological 
treatments in patients with depression.

BACKGROUND: Work disability has implications for individual health, national 
health care expenditures, economic productivity, and the social safety net. 
Knowledge about population dynamics and risk factors associated with work 
disability are not delineated by cross-sectional research.
OBJECTIVE: In this paper the authors estimate, for the first time, the 
prospective lifetime risk that a head of household will report a work 
disability.
METHODS: Using forty years of longitudinal data from the Panel Study of Income 
Dynamics (PSID), we estimate the lifetime risk of developing a work disability 
and conduct a logistic regression analysis to examine personal characteristics 
that increase the likelihood of a self-reported work disability. Life table 
methods are used to calculate lifetime prevalence, and to compute covariate 
effects.
RESULTS: Between the ages of 25 and 60, over half (54.6%) of U.S. household 
heads will self-report a work disability, and approximately one quarter (24.1%) 
will self-report a severe work disability. Persons with income below 150% of the 
federal poverty level, or lower educational attainment, have an increased 
likelihood of reporting a work disability.
CONCLUSIONS: This study finds that more than half of U.S. household heads will 
self-report a work disability, which is a higher prevalence than in existing 
cross-sectional estimates. The social context for this finding is that work 
disability is a major driver of spending on health care services and the social 
safety net.

Half-life extension (HLE) is becoming an essential component of the industrial 
development of small-sized therapeutic peptides and proteins. HESylation(®) is a 
HLE technology based on coupling drug molecules to the biodegradable 
hydroxyethyl starch (HES). In this study, we report on the synthesis, 
characterization and pharmacokinetics of HESylated anakinra, where anakinra was 
conjugated to propionaldehyde-HES using reductive amination, leading to a 
monoHESylated protein. Characterization using size exclusion chromatography and 
dynamic light scattering confirmed conjugation and the increase in molecular 
size, while Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy showed that the secondary 
structure of the conjugate was not affected by coupling. Meanwhile, 
microcalorimetry and aggregation studies showed a significant increase in 
protein stability. Surface plasmon resonance and microscale thermophoresis 
showed that the conjugate retained its nanomolar affinity, and finally, the 
pharmacokinetics of the HESylated protein exhibited a 6.5-fold increase in the 
half-life, and a 45-fold increase in the AUC. These results indicate that 
HESylation(®) is a promising HLE technology.

The RNA polymerase flow model of gene transcription.

Edri S, Gazit E, Cohen E, Tuller T.

Gene expression is a fundamental cellular process by which proteins are 
synthesized based on the information coded in the genes. The two major steps of 
this process are the transcription of the DNA segment corresponding to a gene to 
mRNA molecules and the translation of the mRNA molecules to proteins by the 
ribosome. Thus, understanding, modeling and engineering the different stages of 
this process have both important biotechnological applications and contributions 
to basic life science. In previous studies we have introduced the Homogenous 
Ribosome Flow Model (HRFM) and demonstrated its advantages in analyses of the 
translation process. In this study we introduce the RNA Polymerase Flow Model 
(RPFM), a non trivial extension of the HRFM, which also includes a backward flow 
and can be used for modeling transcription and maybe other similar processes. We 
compare the HRFM and the RPFM in the three regimes of the transcription process: 
rate limiting initiation, rate limiting elongation and rate limiting termination 
via a simulative and analytical analysis. In addition, based on experimental 
data, we show that RPFM is a better choice for modeling transcription process.

Knowledge of genes essential for the life-extending effect of dietary 
restriction (DR) in mammals is incomplete. In this study, we found that 
neuropeptide Y (Npy), which mediates physiological adaptations to energy 
deficits, is an essential link between DR and longevity in mice. The 
lifespan-prolonging effect of lifelong 30% DR was attenuated in Npy-null mice, 
as was the effect on the occurrence of spontaneous tumors and oxidative stress 
responses in comparison to wild-type mice. In contrast, the physiological 
processes activated during adaptation to DR, including inhibition of anabolic 
signaling molecules (insulin and insulin-like growth factor-1), modulation of 
adipokine and corticosterone levels, and preferential fatty acid oxidation, were 
unaffected by the absence of Npy. These results suggest a key role for Npy in 
mediating the effects of DR. We also provide evidence that most of the 
physiological adaptations to DR could be achieved in mice without Npy.

BACKGROUND/AIMS: Retinal screening programmes in England and Scotland have 
similar photographic grading schemes for background (non-proliferative) and 
proliferative diabetic retinopathy, but diverge over maculopathy. We looked for 
the most cost-effective method of identifying diabetic macular oedema from 
retinal photographs including the role of automated grading and optical 
coherence tomography, a technology that directly visualises oedema.
METHODS: Patients from seven UK centres were recruited. The following features 
in at least one eye were required for enrolment: microaneurysms/dot haemorrhages 
or blot haemorrhages within one disc diameter, or exudates within one or two 
disc diameters of the centre of the macula. Subjects had optical coherence 
tomography and digital photography. Manual and automated grading schemes were 
evaluated. Costs and QALYs were modelled using microsimulation techniques.
RESULTS: 3540 patients were recruited, 3170 were analysed. For diabetic macular 
oedema, England's scheme had a sensitivity of 72.6% and specificity of 66.8%; 
Scotland's had a sensitivity of 59.5% and specificity of 79.0%. When applying a 
ceiling ratio of £30,000 per quality adjusted life years (QALY) gained, 
Scotland's scheme was preferred. Assuming automated grading could be implemented 
without increasing grading costs, automation produced a greater number of QALYS 
for a lower cost than England's scheme, but was not cost effective, at the 
study's operating point, compared with Scotland's. The addition of optical 
coherence tomography, to each scheme, resulted in cost savings without reducing 
health benefits.
CONCLUSIONS: Retinal screening programmes in the UK should reconsider the 
screening pathway to make best use of existing and new technologies.

Effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of an awareness campaign for colorectal 
cancer: a mathematical modeling study.

BACKGROUND: A campaign to increase the awareness of the signs and symptoms of 
colorectal cancer (CRC) and encourage self-presentation to a GP was piloted in 
two regions of England in 2011. Short-term data from the pilot evaluation on 
campaign cost and changes in GP attendances/referrals, CRC incidence, and CRC 
screening uptake were available. The objective was to estimate the effectiveness 
and cost-effectiveness of a CRC awareness campaign by using a mathematical model 
which extrapolates short-term outcomes to predict long-term impacts on cancer 
mortality, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and costs.
METHODS: A mathematical model representing England (aged 30+) for a lifetime 
horizon was developed. Long-term changes to cancer incidence, cancer stage 
distribution, cancer mortality, and QALYs were estimated. Costs were estimated 
incorporating costs associated with delivering the campaign, additional GP 
attendances, and changes in CRC treatment.
RESULTS: Data from the pilot campaign suggested that the awareness campaign 
caused a 1-month 10 % increase in presentation rates. Based on this, the model 
predicted the campaign to cost £5.5 million, prevent 66 CRC deaths and gain 404 
QALYs. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio compared to "no campaign" was 
£13,496 per QALY. Results were sensitive to the magnitude and duration of the 
increase in presentation rates and to disease stage.
CONCLUSIONS: The effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a cancer awareness 
campaign can be estimated based on short-term data. Such predictions will aid 
policy makers in prioritizing between cancer control strategies. Future 
cost-effectiveness studies would benefit from campaign evaluations reporting as 
follows: data completeness, duration of impact, impact on emergency 
presentations, and comparison with non-intervention regions.

Periprosthetic fractures around the knee: current concepts and advances in 
management.

Whitehouse MR(1), Mehendale S.

Author information:

Knee replacement is an effective treatment for pain and functional impairment 
secondary to degenerative joint conditions. The number of knee replacements 
performed continues to rise. Periprosthetic fractures around total knee 
arthroplasties are a relatively rare complication but are complex injuries that 
require the treating surgeon to be familiar with and proficient at arthroplasty 
and trauma reconstructive techniques. An increase in life expectancy and in the 
functional demands of elderly patients may lead to an increased incidence of 
periprosthetic fractures. Supracondylar fractures of the femur are the most 
common type and this review will focus on the incidence, risk factors, 
classification, investigation, and treatment options for periprosthetic 
fractures around total knee arthroplasties.
