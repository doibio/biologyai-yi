dysfunction. On the other hand, admission to the ICU should be offered to 
patients with newly diagnosed cancer and acute life-threatening cancer related 
events. The critical care of patients with cancer contribute and support to 
continue the fight against cancer.

BACKGROUND: Older adults (OA) with advanced cancer (AC) undergoing phase I 
clinical trials (PICT) have poor prognosis. There are no studies which describe 
symptoms experienced by OA.
METHODS: Retrospective chart review of PICT participants >60 years. OA were 
compared by age (>65 vs 60-65) and by number of symptoms (>3 vs ≤3).
RESULTS: N = 56. Mean age = 67.09; 48.21% female. Median life-expectancy = 5 
months (interquartile range = 2-9 months); 80.36% had pain; of those 64% without 
pain scale. Most did not have interdisciplinary professionals or hospice 
referrals. Older adults with >3 symptoms had more admissions (37.5% vs 14.29%; P 
= .0335), complications (46.43% vs 16.07%; P = .0026), and greater decline in 
functional status (24 participants >3 symptoms vs 8; P = .0173). There were no 
significant differences comparing OA by age.
CONCLUSIONS: Older adults enrolled in PICT with more symptoms may sacrifice QOL 
for experimental treatment.

The Asia Pacific region is home to more than 60% of the world's population. Life 
expectancy at birth differs between countries by as much as 27 years. This 
article suggests that asymmetric economic growth, unplanned urbanization, marked 
environmental change, unequal improvements in daily living conditions, and the 
unequal distribution and access to quality health care have contributed to 
health inequities in the Asia Pacific region. Contextually specific evidence and 
action are needed. This requires ongoing monitoring of health inequities and 
systematic evaluation of societal changes and their impact on health inequities. 
It requires better understanding of how to translate theoretical and empirical 
demonstrations of the social and environmental impact on health inequities into 
evidence-informed policies and programs, in diverse geopolitical, socioeconomic, 
and sociocultural contexts across the Asia Pacific region and the range of 
associated complex policy processes. A spotlight is needed on health inequities 
and their causes else the status quo will persist.

BACKGROUND: The high rate of cardiovascular mortality in patients with end-stage 
renal disease (ESRD) is a significant barrier to improved life expectancy. 
Unique in this population is the marked development and aggressive worsening of 
vascular calcification (VC). Pyrophosphate (PPi), an endogenous molecule, 
appears to naturally inhibit soft tissue calcification, but may be depressed in 
chronic kidney disease (CKD) and ESRD. Although once thought to be a promising 
therapeutic, PPi's very short half-life in circulation curtailed earlier 
studies. We tested the possibility that a slow, continuous entry of PPi into the 
circulation and prevention of VC might be achieved by daily peritoneal dialysis 
(PD).
METHODS: Pharmacokinetic studies were first carried out in rats with renal 
impairment resulting from a 5/6 nephrectomy. Efficacy studies were then 
performed in the apolipoprotein E gene knockout mouse model overlaid with CKD. 
PPi was delivered by means of a permanent peritoneal catheter in a solution 
simulating PD, but without the timed removal of spent dialysate. von Kossa's 
staining followed by semiquantitative morphological image processing, with 
separation of inside (intimal) and outside (presumed medial) lesions, was used 
to determine aortic root calcification.
RESULTS: In comparison to an intravenous bolus, delivery of PPi in a PD solution 
resulted in a slower, extended delivery over >4 h. Next, the efficacy studies 
showed that a 6-day/week PD-simulated administration of PPi resulted in a 
dose-dependent inhibition of aortic calcification in both intimal and medial 
lesions. A dose-response effect on total aortic calcification was also 
documented, with a full inhibition seen at the highest dose. A limited 
peritoneal catheter-related inflammation was observed, as expected, and included 
the placebo-treated control groups. This inflammatory response could have masked 
a lower level PPi-specific adverse effect, but none was observed.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest potential for PPi, administered during PD, to 
prevent the development of VC and to potentially extend the life of ESRD 
patients.

The impact of pandemic influenza H1N1 on health-related quality of life: a 
prospective population-based study.

Agency, London, United Kingdom. AlbertJan.vanHoek@hpa.org.uk

BACKGROUND: While the H1N1v influenza pandemic in 2009 was clinically mild, with 
a low case-fatality rate, the overall disease burden measured in 
quality-adjusted life years (QALY) lost has not been estimated. Such a measure 
would allow comparison with other diseases and assessment of the 
cost-effectiveness of pandemic control measures.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: Cases of H1N1v confirmed by polymerase chain reaction 
(PCR) and PCR negative cases with similar influenza-like illness (ILI controls) 
in 7 regions of England were sent two questionnaires, one within a week of 
symptom onset and one two weeks later, requesting information on duration of 
illness, work loss and antiviral use together with EQ-5D questionnaires. Results 
were compared with those for seasonal influenza from a systematic literature 
review. A total QALY loss for the 2009 pandemic in England was calculated based 
on the estimated total clinical cases and reported deaths. A total of 655 
questionnaires were sent and 296 (45%) returned. Symptoms and average illness 
duration were similar between confirmed cases and ILI controls (8.8 days and 8.7 
days respectively). Days off work were greater for cases than ILI controls (7.3 
and 4.9 days respectively, p  =  0.003). The quality-adjusted life days lost was 
2.92 for confirmed cases and 2.74 for ILI controls, with a reduction in QALY 
loss after prompt use of antivirals in confirmed cases. The overall QALY loss in 
the pandemic was estimated at 28,126 QALYs (22,267 discounted) of which 40% was 
due to deaths (24% with discounting).
CONCLUSION: Given the global public health significance of influenza, it is 
remarkable that no previous prospective study of the QALY loss of influenza 
using standardised and well validated methods has been performed. Although the 
QALY loss was minor for individual patients, the estimated total burden of 
influenza over the pandemic was substantial when compared to other infectious 
diseases.

Increase in serum growth hormone induced by electrical stimulation of muscle 
combined with blood flow restriction.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of muscle metaboreflex on 
exercise-induced growth hormone (GH) secretion. In order to accumulate 
metabolites within exercised muscle with minimized central motor activity, 
electromyostimulation (EMS) was performed combined with blood flow restriction 
(BFR). Seven men performed one-legged isometric knee extension evoked by EMS 
(frequency, 20 Hz; pulse duration, 400 μs; on-off ratio, 3-1 s). Just before the 
exercise, proximal portion of either a stimulated thigh (ST) or a non-stimulated 
thigh (NT) was compressed at 150 mmHg with an air-pressure cuff for the purpose 
of BFR. The compression was kept throughout the exercise session, and was 
released 2 min after the end of the exercise. Two exercise sessions (ST(BFR), 
BFR for ST; NT(BFR), BFR for NT) were separated by 1 week. ST(BFR) was aimed to 
accumulate metabolites within exercised muscle, whereas NT(BFR) was aimed to 
match mechanical stress with ST(BFR) without accumulating metabolites. Blood 
samples for hormonal measurements were taken from the antecubital vein before 
and after the exercise. Blood lactate increased immediately after the exercise 
in the NT(BFR), whereas it increased after the cuff deflation in the ST(BFR), 
suggesting that locally produced metabolites were retained and accumulated 
within the exercised muscle in the ST(BFR). Although serum cortisol and plasma 
noradrenaline increased in a similar manner in two conditions, serum 
immunoreactive GH (irGH) increased only in the ST(BFR). These results suggest 
that muscle metaboreflex plays an important role in the exercise-induced GH 
secretion, at least in terms of irGH secretion.

The study was aimed at the experimental assessment of the efficacy of 
recombinant interleukin-1beta in the early therapy of haemopoiesis disorders 
caused by X-ray irradiation. The efficacy of the product was based on the 30-day 
survival rate and average life expectancy of dead animals. Endogenous and 
exogenous colony-formations were studied to reveal possible mechanisms of 
therapeutic effects of interleukin-1beta on the bone marrow. The early 
administration (10-15 min after exposure to radiation) of recombinant 
interleukin-1beta in a dose of 50 microg/kg increased the survival rate and 
prevented the post-irradiation decrease in the number of endogenous and 
exogenous CFU-S9 in irradiated mice.

Cost-effectiveness of telemetry for hospitalized patients with low-risk chest 
pain.

USA. wardmj@uc.edu

BACKGROUND: The majority of chest pain admissions originate in the emergency 
department (ED). Despite a low incidence of cardiac events, limited telemetry 
availability, and its questionable benefit, these patients are routinely 
admitted to a monitored setting.
OBJECTIVES: The objectives were to analyze the cost-effectiveness of admission 
to telemetry versus admission to an unmonitored hospital bed in low-risk chest 
pain patients and explore when the use of telemetry may be cost-effective.
METHODS: The authors constructed a decision analytic model to evaluate the 
scenario of an ED admission of an otherwise healthy 55-year-old patient with 
low-risk chest pain defined as an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) probability of 
2%. Costs were estimated from 2009 Medicare data for hospital reimbursement and 
physician services, as well as published data on disability costs. Published 
studies were used to estimate the risk of ACS, cardiac arrest, time to 
defibrillation, survival, long-term disability, and quality of life.
RESULTS: In the base case, telemetry was more effective (0.0044 quality-adjusted 
life-years [QALYs]) but more costly ($299.67) than a floor bed, resulting in a 
high marginal cost-effectiveness ratio (mCER) of $67,484.55 per QALY. In 
comprehensive sensitivity analyses, the mCER crossed below the 
willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of $50,000 per QALY when the following 
scenarios were met: the probability of ACS exceeds 3%, the probability of 
cardiac arrest is greater than 0.4%, the probability of shockable dysrhythmia is 
above 83%, the probability of delay in telemetry bed availability is below 52%, 
and the opportunity cost of delay to telemetry bed placement is below $119.
CONCLUSIONS: Telemetry may be a "cost-effective" use of health care resources 
for chest pain patients when patients have a probability of ACS above 3% or for 
patients with a minimal delay and cost associated with obtaining a monitored 
bed. Further research is needed to better stratify low-risk chest pain patients 
to the appropriate inpatient setting and to understand the frequency and costs 
associated with delays in obtaining monitored beds.

Overcoming barriers to diabetes control in geriatrics.

INTRODUCTION: Diabetes mellitus is approaching epidemic proportions in most 
countries and has captured the attention of physicians at local, national and 
global levels. The elderly population remains at a higher risk for diabetes 
mellitus (1), and the disease poses unique concerns for geriatricians, primary 
care physicians, nurses and specialised pharmacists who provide care to the 
elderly. Glycaemic control, geriatric-related syndromes and cardiovascular risk 
factors considerably affect the elderly patient's functional status and life 
expectancy (2). Geriatric syndromes may include polypharmacy, chronic pain, 
injurious falls, cognitive impairment, urinary incontinence and depression. 
Higher rates of premature death; functional disability; and chronic illnesses, 
such as hypertension, cerebrovascular accidents, dementia and coronary artery 
disease, often affect elderly diabetic patients.
DISCUSSION: Collaborative efforts are continually needed to allocate and 
maximise utilisation of resources to help empower older adults with diabetes to 
overcome barriers to disease management. Healthcare providers are increasingly 
challenged by the complexity of problems that face old patients, and must 
therefore be prepared to assess and treat diabetes mellitus within the milieu of 
many geriatric-related chronic illnesses. Healthcare providers must tailor 
individualised treatment methods, with the ultimate goal of not only achieving 
laboratory norms but also improving the quality of life for this vulnerable 
population.
CONCLUSION: There is a need for extra care and overcoming barriers to diabetes 
control in old patients as a dynamic and a continuous task that needs 
coordination of healthcare systems and professionals at all levels of care.

of Medicine, St. Louis, MO 63110, USA.

Life expectancy in the world has increased dramatically during the last century; 
the number of older adults is expected to rise while the number of youths will 
decline in the near future. This demographic shift has considerable public 
health and economic implications since aging is associated with the development 
of serious chronic diseases. Calorie restriction (CR) is the most effective 
nutritional intervention for slowing aging and preventing chronic disease in 
rodents. In non-human and human primates, CR with adequate nutrition protects 
against abdominal obesity, diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular diseases. 
Cancer morbidity and mortality are also diminished in CR monkeys, and data 
obtained from individuals practicing long-term CR show a reduction of metabolic 
and hormonal factors associated with increased cancer risk.

INTRODUCTION: Today COPD is generally regarded as a generalised illness starting 
in the respiratory system. Numerous extra-pulmonary manifestations and a range 
of co-morbidities complicate the natural history of the disease. They aggravate 
the symptoms, affect the quality of life and increase the risks of hospital 
admission and death. Recently a new step has been taken with the recognition of 
prognostic factors that are independent of bronchial obstruction.
BACKGROUND: The true predictive factors of survival in patients with COPD are 
effort intolerance, loss of independence, the level of physical activity, 
diminution of body mass index, loss of muscle mass or quadriceps strength, 
dispense, anxiety, depression and quality of life. Different tools, such as the 
BODE index or its modifications which integrate the predictive value of several 
manifestations of COPD, are now validated for the estimation of life expectancy.
CONCLUSION: These new data are a further advance in the understanding of the 
disease and the optimisation of the diagnosis, evaluation and management of 
patients.

Cost-effectiveness of sacral neuromodulation compared to botulinum neurotoxin a 
or continued medical management in refractory overactive bladder.

OBJECTIVES: This study assessed the cost-effectiveness and health-care budget 
impact of sacral neuromodulation (SNM) in refractory idiopathic OAB-wet patients 
in Spain.
METHODS: A 10-year Markov analytic model was developed to estimate 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained and incontinence episode avoided 
associated with SNM therapy compared with botulinum neurotoxin A (BoNT-A) or 
continued optimized medical treatment (OMT).
RESULTS: At 10 years, the cumulative costs of SNM, BoNT-A, and OMT were €29,166, 
€29,458, and €29,370, respectively, whereas the QALYs for SNM, BoNT-A, and OMT 
are 6.89, 6.38, and 5.12, respectively. Consequently, incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for SNM demonstrate that although the initial 
costs for SNM are higher than those for the other treatments, decreasing 
follow-up costs coupled with consistently greater effectiveness in the long term 
make SNM the economically dominant option at 10 years. Sensitivity analyses 
suggest that 99.7% and 99.9% (for SNM vs. BoNT-A and OMT, respectively) of the 
1000 Monte Carlo iterations fall within the €30,000 cost-effectiveness 
threshold, considered to be acceptable in Spain. The 10-year incremental cost 
per incontinence episode avoided for SNM also makes this therapy the dominant 
option compared to BoNT-A or OMT. Additionally, the estimated budget impact of 
the gradually increased referral for SNM for the management of OAB patients in 
Spain is small.
CONCLUSIONS: As a treatment option for refractory idiopathic OAB, at 10 years, 
SNM provides a considerable possibility of symptom and quality-of-life 
improvement and is cost-effective compared to BoNT-A or continued OMT.

BACKGROUND: Very few randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have compared 
laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication (LNF) to proton pump inhibitors (PPI) medical 
management for patients with chronic gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). 
Larger RCTs have been relatively short in duration, and have reported mixed 
results regarding symptom control and effect on quality of life (QOL). Economic 
evaluations have reported conflicting results.
OBJECTIVES: To determine the incremental cost-utility of LNF versus PPI for 
treating patients with chronic and controlled GERD over 3 years from the 
societal perspective.
METHODS: Economic evaluation was conducted alongside a RCT that enrolled 104 
patients from October 2000 to September 2004. Primary study outcome was GERD 
symptoms (secondary outcomes included QOL and cost-utility). Resource 
utilization and QOL data collected at regular follow-up intervals determined 
incremental cost/QALY gained. Stochastic uncertainty was assessed using 
bootstrapping and methodologic assumptions were assessed using sensitivity 
analysis.
RESULTS: No statistically significant differences in GERD symptom scores, but 
LNF did result in fewer heartburn days and improved QOL. Costs were higher for 
LNF patients by $3205/patient over 3 years but QOL was also higher as measured 
by either QOL instrument. Based on total costs, incremental cost-utility of LNF 
was $29,404/QALY gained using the Health Utility Index 3. Cost-utility results 
were sensitive to the utility instrument used ($29,404/QALY for Health Utility 
Index 3, $31,117/QALY for the Short Form 6D, and $76,310/QALY for EuroQol 5D) 
and if current lower prices for PPIs were used in the analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: Results varied depending on resource use/costs included in the 
analysis, the QOL instrument used, and the cost of PPIs; however, LNF was 
generally found to be a cost-effective treatment for patients with symptomatic 
controlled GERD requiring long-term management.

An economic evaluation of short-acting opioids for treatment of breakthrough 
pain in patients with cancer.

Vissers DC(1), Lenre M, Tolley K, Jakobsson J, Sendersky V, Jansen JP.

(1)Mapi Values, Houten, The Netherlands.

OBJECTIVE: Breakthrough cancer pain (BTCP) represents a considerable economic 
burden. A decision-analysis model was developed to evaluate the 
cost-effectiveness of intranasal fentanyl spray (INFS) compared with oral 
transmucosal fentanyl citrate (OTFC) and fentanyl buccal tablet (FBT) for the 
treatment of BTCP.
METHODS: The model was parameterized for Sweden to estimate the costs and 
benefits associated with treatments. Expected reductions in pain intensity (PI; 
measured on a numeric rating scale ranging from 0 to 10) per BTCP episodes were 
translated into resource use and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Relative 
analgesic efficacy of interventions was derived from a mixed treatment 
comparison of six randomized controlled trials. The relationship between PI and 
utility was obtained from a time-trade off study in the general population. 
Resource use and unit cost data were obtained from the literature and validated 
by Swedish clinical experts. The base case scenario assumed three BTCP 
episodes/day, a background PI of 2, and a time horizon of 180 days. Prices of 
INFS and OTFC were assumed to be equal with FBT ∼14% less. Uncertainty in the 
source data was incorporated by probabilistic sensitivity analyses and different 
scenario analyses.
RESULTS: With INFS, 55% of BTCP (95% uncertainty interval [UI]: 46-68%) was 
avoided, which is greater than expected with OTFC (29%; UI 22-38%) or FBT (31%; 
UI 25-39%). INFS was dominating OTFC (resulting in 0.046 QALY gain and saving 
174 Euros with a time horizon of 180 days) and cost-effective versus FBT 
(incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 12203 Euros/QALY). Despite uncertainty in 
the source data, there is a >99% probability that INFS is the most 
cost-effective intervention.
CONCLUSION: Given inherent limitations of modelling studies, the greater 
efficacy of INFS translates to cost and QALY advantages over competing 
interventions in the treatment for BTCP in Sweden.

Health, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.

OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to estimate the quality-adjusted life 
expectancy (QALE) and the expected lifetime utility loss of patients with 
prolonged mechanical ventilation (PMV).
METHODS: PMV was defined as more than 21 days of mechanical ventilation. A total 
of 633 patients fulfilled this definition and were followed for 9 years 
(1998-2007) to obtain their survival status. Quality of life of 142 patients was 
measured with the EuroQol five-dimensional (EQ-5D) questionnaire during the 
period 2008 to 2009. The survival probabilities for each time point were 
adjusted with a utility measurement of quality of life and then extrapolated to 
300 months to obtain the QALE. We compared the age-, gender-matched reference 
populations to calculate the expected lifetime utility loss.
RESULTS: The average age of subjects was 76 years old. The life expectancy and 
loss of life expectancy were 1.95 years and 8.48 years, respectively. The QALE 
of 55 patients with partial cognitive ability and the ability to respond was 
0.58 quality-adjusted life years (QALY), whereas the QALEs of 87 patients with 
poor consciousness were 0.28 and 0.29 QALY for the EQ-5D measured by family 
caregivers and nurses, respectively. The loss of QALE for PMV patients was 9.87 
to 10.17 QALY, corresponding to a health gap of 94% to 97%.
CONCLUSIONS: Theses results of poor prognosis would provide stakeholders 
evidence for communication to facilitate clinical decisions. The estimation may 
be used in future studies to facilitate the cost-effectiveness and reduction of 
the health gap.

OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to develop and validate an algorithm 
that predicts EQ-5D utility from the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire 
(SGRQ) in subjects with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and to examine the 
effect of using this algorithm in predicting quality-adjusted life-years 
(QALYs).
METHODS: In the TORCH (Towards a Revolution in COPD Health) trial, the SGRQ and 
EQ-5D were administered at baseline and every 24 weeks for 3 years. To map EQ-5D 
utility from the SGRQ, ordinary least squares (OLS), generalized linear models 
(GLMs) and two-part models were used. Algorithms were developed in a fitting 
sample and used to predict utility scores in a validation sample and selected 
based on root-mean-square error (RMSE). QALYs were estimated from the algorithm 
and compared to QALYs derived from EQ-5D utility scores collected in the trial.
RESULTS: A simple OLS algorithm was found to perform as well as algorithms 
developed using more complex modeling structures. The resulting model was (RMSE 
0.1723): EQ-5D = 0.9617 - 0.0013 × SGRQ total - 0.0001 × SGRQ total(2) + 0.0231 
× male. Ordering of treatments by QALY gain was dependent on the method of 
utility estimation.
CONCLUSION: A mapping algorithm can be used to predict EQ-5D utility scores from 
the SGRQ and may be useful in some situations; however, for use in a health 
technology assessment (HTA) submission in which precision of estimation is 
important, it is in the interests of both the manufacturer and the HTA body that 
utility scores be directly derived from the clinical trial population.

PURPOSE: To understand the impact of breast cancer on older women's survival, we 
compared survival of older women diagnosed with breast cancer with matched 
controls. METHODS Using the linked 1992 to 2003 Surveillance, Epidemiology, and 
End Results (SEER) -Medicare data set, we identified women age 67 years or older 
who were newly diagnosed with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or breast cancer. 
We identified women not diagnosed with breast cancer from the 5% random sample 
of Medicare beneficiaries residing in SEER areas.We matched patient cases to 
controls by birth year and registry (99% or 66,039 [corrected] patient cases 
matched successfully). We assigned the start of follow-up for controls as the 
patient cases' date of diagnosis. Mortality data were available through 2006. We 
compared survival of women with breast cancer by stage with survival of controls 
using multivariable proportional hazards models adjusting for age at diagnosis, 
comorbidity, prior mammography use, and sociodemographics. We repeated these 
analyses stratifying by age.
RESULTS: Median follow-up time was 7.7 years. Differences between patient cases 
and controls in sociodemographics and comorbidities were small (< 4%). Women 
diagnosed with DCIS (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 0.7; 95% CI, 0.7 to 0.7) or 
stage I disease (aHR, 0.8; 95% CI, 0.8 to 0.8) had slightly lower mortality than 
controls.Women diagnosed with stage II disease or higher had greater mortality 
than controls (stage II disease:aHR, 1.2; 95% CI, 1.2 to 1.2). The association 
of a breast cancer diagnosis with mortality declined with age among women with 
advanced disease [corrected].
CONCLUSION: Compared with matched controls, a diagnosis of DCIS or stage I 
breast cancer in older women is associated with better [corrected] survival, 
whereas a diagnosis of stage II or higher breast cancer is associated with worse 
survival.

Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA 19107, USA. amurchison@willseye.org

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the necessity of neuroimaging in patients with acute, 
isolated ocular motor mononeuropathies.
METHODS: A prospective case series evaluating diagnostic technology results in 
93 patients older than 50 years with acute isolated mononeuropathies was 
performed. Patients were included in the study if they had new-onset diplopia 
with an isolated cranial neuropathy (cranial nerve III, IV, or VI palsy) and no 
other signs of neurologic dysfunction. All patients had gadolinium-enhanced 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The number of patients with lesions noted on 
MRI and the overall cost of imaging the patients were determined. Cost analysis 
of the MRI was conducted using Current Procedural Terminology codes and Medicare 
costs in 2010 dollars. Cost utility was estimated using cost data as well as 
published utility values for adults with diplopia and sex-specific life tables 
for life expectancy in the United States.
RESULTS: Four of 93 patients had lesions on MRI; however, only 1 of the 93 
patients had a lesion related to the cranial mononeuropathy. The total modeled 
cost of imaging for these 93 patients was $131,688 to determine an underlying 
cause in 1 patient with no change in treatment. The estimated cost utility for 
the patient with a causative lesion found by MRI was $90.19 for diagnosis alone.
CONCLUSIONS: It may not be medically necessary to perform MRI scanning on every 
patient with an isolated cranial nerve III, IV, or VI palsy. In adults older 
than 50 years with an isolated mononeuropathy, physicians should carefully 
review the patients' history and findings to determine which patients to image 
at the initial evaluation.

Cost-effectiveness of chemoprevention of breast cancer using tamoxifen in a 
postmenopausal US population.

BACKGROUND: Previous cost-effectiveness analyses of tamoxifen therapy account 
for breast cancer risk reduction during active treatment but not for its 
persistent protective effect after active treatment.
METHODS: A detailed, continuous time, mathematical model of breast cancer and 
healthcare processes was used to simulate a postmenopausal population aged <55 
years in a virtual trial comparing tamoxifen treatment with no treatment for 
lifetime follow-up. Unlike previous work, the current model of tamoxifen therapy 
is based on a meta-analysis of 4 randomized, placebo-controlled chemoprevention 
trials with breast cancer risk reduction continuing for 10 years after treatment 
termination. Cancer incidence and survival data were derived from Surveillance, 
Epidemiology and End Results statistics. Noncancer disease incidences, 
quality-adjusted life year (QALY) utility weights, and costs were derived from 
the literature.
RESULTS: Tamoxifen treatment (vs no treatment) saved 29 QALYs in a population of 
1000 postmenopausal women aged <55 years with an additional cost of $333,000 
over the population's lifetime (average cost-effectiveness ratio, $11,530 per 
QALY). Tamoxifen therapy, compared with no treatment, was cost saving when 
higher risk populations were targeted (5-year risk ≥1.66%). The 
cost-effectiveness results were sensitive to parameters that characterized 
menopausal symptoms and adverse side effects of tamoxifen.
CONCLUSIONS: The current results indicated that tamoxifen chemoprophylaxis for 
postmenopausal women aged <55 years is a cost-effective health policy that 
reduces breast cancer incidence and improves life expectancy. Focusing on a 
postmenopausal population aged <55 years minimized the threat of adverse events 
associated with tamoxifen.

Estimating the cost-effectiveness of a national program to eliminate disparities 
in influenza vaccination rates among elderly minority groups.

States. michaelidis.constant@medstudent.pitt.edu

Influenza is a major cause of preventable morbidity and mortality in the United 
States, particularly among the elderly. Yet, there remain large disparities in 
influenza vaccination rates across elderly Caucasian (70%), African-American 
(50%) and Hispanic (55%) populations, with substantial mortality consequences. 
In this study, we built a decision-analysis model to estimate the 
cost-effectiveness of a hypothetical national vaccination program designed to 
eliminate these disparities in influenza vaccination rates. Taking a societal 
perspective, we developed a Markov model with a one-year cycle length and 
lifetime time horizon. In the base case, we conservatively assumed that the cost 
of promoting the vaccination program was $10 per targeted elder per year and 
that by year 10, the vaccination rate of the elderly African-American and 
Hispanic populations would equal the vaccination rate of the elderly Caucasian 
population (70%). The cost-effectiveness of the vaccination program compared to 
no vaccination program was $48,617 per QALY saved. Probabilistic sensitivity 
analyses suggested that at willingness-to-pay thresholds of $50,000 and $100,000 
per QALY saved, the likelihood of the vaccination program being cost-effective 
was 38% and 92%, respectively. In an analysis using conservative assumptions, we 
found that a hypothetical program to ameliorate disparities in influenza 
vaccination rates has a moderate to high likelihood of being cost-effective.

University of Ioannina, Ioannina 45110, Greece.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of natural antimicrobial 
agents EDTA, lysozyme, and 2 essential oils (rosemary and oregano) on the 
quality of a ready-to-eat poultry product (semicooked coated; SCC) stored under 
aerobic packaging conditions at 4°C (retail) and 8°C (abuse) for a period of 16 
d. Treatments included the following: air-packaged chicken fillets (control, 
untreated); with EDTA (1.50% wt/wt); with lysozyme solution (1.50% wt/wt); with 
rosemary oil (0.20% vol/wt); with oregano oil (0.20% vol/wt); with a combination 
of EDTA and lysozyme solutions (1.50% wt/wt each); and with the combination of 
EDTA, lysozyme, and either rosemary or oregano essential oils (all added at 
concentrations previously mentioned). The shelf life of the SCC samples 
(untreated and treated) was determined using both microbiological and sensory 
analyses. Natural antimicrobial combinations consisting of EDTA, lysozyme, and 
rosemary or oregano essential oil affected the growth of Pseudomonas and yeasts 
and molds, whereas EDTA, lysozyme, and rosemary essential oil controlled 
Brochothrix thermosphacta population in the SCC chicken fillets stored at 4 and 
8°C. The combination of EDTA, lysozyme, and either rosemary or oregano resulted 
in a shelf life extension of 5 d compared with the control samples at both 4 and 
8°C, with the former combination producing a more sensorially acceptable 
product.

BACKGROUND: There is a substantial variation in life expectancy across US 
counties, primarily owing to differentials in chronic diseases. The authors' aim 
was to examine the association of life expectancy and mortality from selected 
diseases with altitude.
METHODS: The authors used data from the National Elevation Dataset, National 
Center for Heath Statistics and US Census. The authors analysed the crude 
association of mean county altitude with life expectancy and mortality from 
ischaemic heart disease (IHD), stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
(COPD) and cancers, and adjusted the associations for socio-demographic factors, 
migration, average annual solar radiation and cumulative exposure to smoking in 
multivariable regressions.
RESULTS: Counties above 1500 m had longer life expectancies than those within 
100 m of sea level by 1.2-3.6 years for men and 0.5-2.5 years for women. The 
association between altitude and life expectancy became non-significant for 
women and non-significant or negative for men in multivariate analysis. After 
adjustment, altitude had a beneficial association with IHD mortality and harmful 
association with COPD, with a dose-response relationship. IHD mortality above 
1000 m was 4-14 per 10,000 people lower than within 100 m of sea level; COPD 
mortality was higher by 3-4 per 10,000. The adjusted associations for stroke and 
cancers were not statistically significant.
CONCLUSIONS: Living at higher altitude may have a protective effect on IHD and a 
harmful effect on COPD. At least in part due to these two opposing effects, 
living at higher altitude appears to have no net effect on life expectancy.

OBJECTIVES: Endoscopic resection (ER) including endoscopic submucosal dissection 
has been widely accepted for treatment of early gastric cancer (EGC) in Japan. 
Additional surgery is recommended when ER is non-curative histologically. Many 
elderly patients, however, do not undergo radical surgery due to comorbid 
disease or limited life expectancy. The aim of this study is to assess the 
survival outcomes of radical surgery compared with observation only in elderly 
patients after non-curative ER.
METHODS: We reviewed existing data of all elderly patients (older than 75 years) 
who had undergone ER for EGC at the National Cancer Center Hospital between 
January 1999 and December 2005. We compared the overall and disease-free 
survival rates between three patients groups: curative ER, non-curative ER with 
additional surgery, and non-curative ER without additional surgery.
RESULTS: In total, 428 patients underwent ER; 308 (72%) curative ER and 120 
(28%) non-curative ER. Of the 120 non-curative ER patients, 38 patients (31.7%) 
underwent additional surgery and 82 patients (68.3%) were followed without 
surgery. There was no significant difference in American Society of 
Anesthesiologist score between three groups. Patients who did not undergo 
surgery tended to be older. Overall 5-year survival rates in the curative ER, 
non-curative ER with surgery, and non-curative ER without surgery were 85, 92, 
and 63%, respectively. There was no significant difference in overall and 
disease-free survival between patients in the curative ER and non-curative ER 
with surgery groups. On the contrary, a significant difference in overall and 
disease-free survival was evident between the curative ER and non-curative ER 
without surgery groups (hazard ratio (95% confidence interval): 1.89 
(1.08-3.28), 2.30 (1.35-3.94)).
CONCLUSIONS: In our elderly patient cohort, additional surgery following 
non-curative ER improved overall and disease-free survival compared with 
non-surgical observation only. Thus, surgery should be considered following 
non-curative ER in EGC patients >75 years of age.

BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Nutritional intervention with oral nutritional 
supplements (ONS) has been shown to increase quality of life in malnourished 
patients. We investigated whether post-hospital supplementation with ONS is 
cost-effective according to international benchmarks in malnourished patients.
SUBJECTS/METHODS: In total, 114 malnourished patients (50.6±16.1 years, 57 
female) with benign gastrointestinal disease were included and randomised to 
receive either ONS for 3 months and dietary counselling at discharge 
(intervention, n=60) or only dietary counselling at discharge (control group, 
n=54). Nutritional status was assessed with Subjective Global Assessment. 
Intervention patients documented daily intake of ONS; quality of life was 
assessed with Short-Form (SF)-36 Health Survey and SF-36 values were transformed 
into health-status utilities. Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were 
calculated by adopting the area under the curve method. We used two different 
pricing scenarios for ONS (minimum price: [euro]2.30 and maximum: 
[euro]2.93/tetrapack). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of 
supplementation with ONS was calculated for both price scenarios. All analyses 
were corrected for age and gender.
RESULTS: Intervention patients consumed 2.4±0.8 ONS per day. Intervention and 
control patients did not differ in their health status utilities at baseline 
(0.594±0.017 vs 0.619±0.018), but after 3 months, the health status utilities 
were significantly higher in intervention patients than in control patients 
(0.731±0.015 vs 0.671±0.016, P=0.028). Intervention was associated with 
significantly higher costs (ICER: [euro]9497 and [euro]12,099/additional QALY, 
respectively) but deemed cost-effective according to international thresholds (< 
[euro]50,000/QALY).
CONCLUSIONS: A 3-month intervention with ONS increases quality of life in 
malnourished patients. This treatment appears to be cost-effective according to 
international benchmarks.

This study estimates the direct costs of multiple sclerosis (MS) in Italy from 
the perspective of the National Health System. Patients diagnosed with MS for ≥1 
year prior to study entry were included in the analysis; neurological disability 
was assessed using the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS). Cost variables 
were analyzed according to: MS phenotype, disease course over the previous year 
and EDSS rating. A total of 510 patients were included in the analysis. Overall 
costs were significantly higher for relapsing-remitting MS and secondary 
progressive MS than for primary progressive MS (P < 0.05). Costs were higher for
