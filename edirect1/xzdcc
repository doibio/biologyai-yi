We investigated changes in motor unit (MU) behavior and vasti-muscle contractile 
properties during sustained submaximal fatiguing contractions with a new 
time-domain tracking technique to understand the mechanisms responsible for task 
failure. Sixteen participants performed a nonfatiguing 15-s isometric knee 
extension at 50% of the maximum voluntary (MVC) torque, followed by a 30% MVC 
sustained contraction until exhaustion. Two grids of 64 surface electromyography 
electrodes were placed over vastus medialis and lateralis. Signals were 
decomposed into MU discharge times and the MUs from the 30% MVC sustained 
contraction were followed until task failure by overlapping decomposition 
intervals. These MUs were then tracked between 50% and 30% MVC. During the 
sustained fatiguing contraction, MUs of the two muscles decreased their 
discharge rate until ∼40% of the endurance time, referred to as the reversal 
time, and then increased their discharge rate until task failure. This reversal 
in firing behavior predicted total endurance time and was matched by opposite 
changes in twitch force (increase followed by a decrease). Despite the later 
increase in MU firing rates, peak discharge rates at task failure did not reach 
the frequency attained during a nonfatiguing 50% MVC contraction. These results 
show that changes in MU firing properties are influenced by adjustments in 
contractile properties during the course of the contraction, allowing the 
identification of two phases. Nevertheless, the contraction cannot be sustained, 
possibly because of progressive motoneuron inhibition/decreased excitability, as 
the later increase in firing rate saturates at a much lower frequency compared 
with a higher-force nonfatiguing contraction.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Motor unit firing 
and contractile properties during a submaximal contraction until failure were 
assessed with a new tracking technique. Two distinct phases in firing behavior 
were observed, which compensated for changes in twitch area and predicted time 
to failure. However, the late increase in firing rate was below the rates 
attained in absence of fatigue, which points to an inability of the central 
nervous system to sufficiently increase the neural drive to muscle with fatigue.

BACKGROUND: Persons who inject drugs (PWID) are at a disproportionately high 
risk of HIV infection. We aimed to determine the highest-valued combination 
implementation strategies to reduce the burden of HIV among PWID in 6 US cities.
METHODS: Using a dynamic HIV transmission model calibrated for Atlanta, 
Baltimore, Los Angeles, Miami, New York City, and Seattle, we assessed the value 
of implementing combinations of evidence-based interventions at optimistic 
(drawn from best available evidence) or ideal (90% coverage) scale-up. We 
estimated reduction in HIV incidence among PWID, quality-adjusted life-years 
(QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for each city 
(10-year implementation; 20-year horizon; 2018 $ US).
RESULTS: Combinations that maximized health benefits contained between 6 
(Atlanta and Seattle) and 12 (Miami) interventions with ICER values ranging from 
$94 069/QALY in Los Angeles to $146 256/QALY in Miami. These strategies reduced 
HIV incidence by 8.1% (credible interval [CI], 2.8%-13.2%) in Seattle and 54.4% 
(CI, 37.6%-73.9%) in Miami. Incidence reduction reached 16.1%-75.5% at ideal 
scale.
CONCLUSIONS: Evidence-based interventions targeted to PWID can deliver 
considerable value; however, ending the HIV epidemic among PWID will require 
innovative implementation strategies and supporting programs to reduce social 
and structural barriers to care.

INTRODUCTION: Perinatal and pediatric diseases related to neurovascular 
disorders cause significant problems during life, affecting a population with a 
long life expectancy. Early diagnosis and assessment of the severity of these 
diseases are crucial to establish an appropriate neuroprotective treatment. 
Currently, physical examination, neuroimaging and clinical judgment are the main 
tools for diagnosis, although these tests have certain limitations. There is 
growing interest in the potential value of noninvasive biomarkers that can be 
used to monitor child patients at risk of brain damage, allowing accurate, and 
reproducible measurements.
AREAS COVERED: This review describes potential biomarkers for the diagnosis of 
perinatal neurovascular diseases and discusses the possibilities they open for 
the classification and treatment of neonatal neurovascular diseases.
EXPERT OPINION: Although high rates of ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke exist in 
pediatric populations, most studies have focused on biomarkers of 
hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy. Inflammatory and neuronal biomarkers such as 
S-100B and GFAP, in combination with others yet to be discovered, could be 
considered as part of multiplex panels to diagnose these diseases and 
potentially for monitoring response to treatments. Ideally, noninvasive 
biofluids would be the best source for evaluating these biomarkers in proteomic 
assays in perinatal patients.

Metabolism and aging are tightly connected. Alpha-ketoglutarate is a key 
metabolite in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, and its levels change upon 
fasting, exercise, and aging. Here, we investigate the effect of 
alpha-ketoglutarate (delivered in the form of a calcium salt, CaAKG) on 
healthspan and lifespan in C57BL/6 mice. To probe the relationship between 
healthspan and lifespan extension in mammals, we performed a series of 
longitudinal, clinically relevant measurements. We find that CaAKG promotes a 
longer, healthier life associated with a decrease in levels of systemic 
inflammatory cytokines. We propose that induction of IL-10 by dietary AKG 
suppresses chronic inflammation, leading to health benefits. By simultaneously 
reducing frailty and enhancing longevity, AKG, at least in the murine model, 
results in a compression of morbidity.

Aging is a risk factor for the development of multiple chronic diseases, 
including cardiovascular disease, cancer and dementia. Life expectancy has 
increased in certain countries but this phenomenon is associated with a 
reduction of years of healthy life. Aging is associated with a number of 
physical and functional changes, especially sarcopenia. Sarcopenia is a clinical 
condition associated with a decrease in skeletal muscle and muscle strength, 
however, sarcopenia is a reversible condition. On the basis of the current 
scientific literature, sarcopenia could more appropriately capture an 
individual's vulnerability to negative health-related outcomes since it 
represents an early form of the chronic diseases. Recognition of this clinical 
condition can improve the management of older individuals in many different 
clinical settings. Despite the limitations of the indirect methods used to study 
body composition, the Italian College of the Academic Nutritionists ME/49 
recommends that health authorities and health professionals around the world 
should make a greater effort to diagnose sarcopenia earlier and to manage it 
more effectively. In line with the development of cancer screening, the use of 
two diagnostic tools for sarcopenia (BIA and DXA) should be implemented.

BACKGROUND: Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare cutaneous neuroendocrine tumor 
that primarily affects elderly patients. Despite aggressive treatment, overall 
survival (OS) remains low.
METHODS: This study is a multi-institutional, retrospective review of 102 
patients with MCC. We evaluated OS, disease-specific survival (DSS), and risk 
factors for recurrence.
RESULTS: Median age of patients was 71.46% of patients recurred. Patients with 
stage I disease had median 5-year OS of 59.3%, compared to 68.1% DSS. For stage 
III, median 5-year OS was 46.0% vs 58.2% DSS. Disease stage and advanced age 
were risk factors for recurrence and decreased OS. Immunocompromised status and 
disease stage were the strongest predictors of DSS.
CONCLUSIONS: DSS is significantly better than OS for patients with MCC. Many 
elderly patients with newly diagnosed MCC have low remaining life expectancy, 
regardless of their MCC diagnosis. Patient age and overall health status should 
be considered to personalize care plans for patients with MCC.

Salivary secretion and salivary stress hormone level changes induced by tongue 
rotation exercise.

Dentistry at Niigata, Niigata, Japan.

PURPOSE: Prevention of xerostomia and stress is important to prolong healthy 
life expectancy and improve the quality of life. We aimed to investigate the 
effects of tongue rotation exercise for increasing salivary secretions and 
stabilizing salivary stress hormone levels.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty four participants without subjective oral dryness 
were enrolled. The exercises comprised tongue rotation exercise and empty 
chewing. The salivary stress hormone level was measured using a Salivary Amylase 
Monitor. Unstimulated whole saliva volume and salivary amylase activity were 
measured before tongue rotation exercise or empty chewing and subsequently 5, 
10, and 15 minutes after these exercises. Differences in the rates of change of 
unstimulated whole saliva volume and salivary amylase activity were analyzed by 
repeated measure analysis of variance.
RESULTS: Statistically significant differences among the rates of change were 
not observed after empty chewing for unstimulated whole saliva volume and 
salivary amylase activity at the four measurement times. However, the rate of 
change of unstimulated whole saliva volume and salivary amylase activity were 
statistically significantly different among the four time points: before the 
tongue rotation exercise and 5, 10, and 15 minutes post-exercise (P< .05 and 
P<.01, respectively).
CONCLUSION: Tongue rotation is effective in increasing saliva secretion, 
reducing stress, improving oral function, and extending healthy life expectancy.

Proposals for allocating scarce lifesaving resources in the face of the Covid-19 
pandemic have aligned in some ways and conflicted in others. This paper attempts 
a kind of priority setting in addressing these conflicts. In the first part, we 
identify points on which we do not believe that reasonable people should 
differ-even if they do. These are (i) the inadequacy of traditional clinical 
ethics to address priority-setting in a pandemic; (ii) the relevance of saving 
lives; (iii) the flaws of first-come, first-served allocation; (iv) the 
relevance of post-episode survival; (v) the difference between age and other 
factors that affect life-expectancy; and (vi) the need to avoid quality-of-life 
judgments. In the second part, we lay out some positions on which reasonable 
people can and do differ. These include (i) conflicts between maximizing 
benefits and priority to the worst off; (ii) role-based priority; and (iii) 
whether patients' existing lifesaving resources should be subject to 
redistribution.

BACKGROUND: Physical activity (PA) interventions capable of producing health 
benefits cost effectively are a public health priority across the Western world. 
'Men on the Move' (MOM), a community-based PA intervention for men, demonstrated 
significant health benefits up to 52-weeks (W) post-baseline. This article 
details the economic evaluation of MOM with a view to determining its 
cost-effectiveness as a public health intervention to be rolled out nationally 
in Ireland.
METHODS: Cost-effectiveness was determined by comparing the costs (direct and 
indirect) of the programme to its benefits, which were captured as the impact on 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). For the benefits, cost-utility analysis was 
conducted by retrospectively adapting various health-related measures of 
participants to generate health states using Brazier et al.'s (2002) short 
form-6D algorithm. This in turn allowed for 'utility measures' to be generated, 
from which QALYs were derived.
RESULTS: Findings show MOM to be cost-effective in supporting an 'at risk' 
cohort of men achieves significant improvements in aerobic fitness, weight loss 
and waist reduction. The total cost per participant (€125.82 for each of the 501 
intervention participants), the QALYs gained (11.98 post-12-W intervention, or 
5.3% health improvement per participant) and estimated QALYs ratio costs of 
€3723 represents a cost-effective improvement when compared to known QALY 
guidelines.
CONCLUSIONS: The analysis shows that the cost per QALY achieved by MOM is 
significantly less than the existing benchmarks of £20 000 and €45 000 in the UK 
and Ireland respectively, demonstrating MOM to be cost-effective.

OBJECTIVE: Salutogenetic aspects are valuable for consideration in 
patient-centred care of advanced oncological diseases with a limited life 
expectancy. The Milestone Communication Approach (MCA), involving 
physician-nurse tandems, addresses specific challenges and needs over the 
disease trajectory of patients with stage IV lung cancer and their informal 
caregivers. This study aims to explore patients' and informal caregivers' 
salutogenetic experiences with the MCA concept.
METHODS: This qualitative study used face-to-face semi-structured interviews 
with patients and informal caregivers. All generated data were audio-recorded, 
pseudonymised and transcribed verbatim. Data were structured using Qualitative 
Content Analysis. The material was coded deductively into themes related to the 
components of sense of coherence (Aaron Antonovsky) and emerging sub-themes. All 
data was managed and organised in MAXQDA.
RESULTS: In 25 interviews, sense of coherence was referred to with all three 
components: "Comprehensibility" was supported by information conveyed suitably 
for the patients; "meaningfulness" was addressed as accepting the situation; and 
"manageability" led to advance care planning the patients were comfortable with. 
Patients and informal caregivers experienced the interprofessional tandem as an 
added value for patient care.
CONCLUSIONS: Participants appreciate the MCA in its support for coping with a 
life-limiting disease. Considering salutogenetic aspects facilitates prognostic 
awareness and advance care planning. Nevertheless, individual needs of patients 
and informal caregivers require an individualised application of the MCA.

Spoilage of agrifood produce is a major issue in the industry. Cooling is an 
effective technique for extending the shelf life of fresh agrifood produce to 
minimize spoilage. Due to the practical inability of directly solving the wide 
spatial and temporal scales in large industrial agrifood cooling systems, the 
porous medium approach is mostly used. However, improvements of current porous 
medium models and modeling across much wider scales are needed to better 
understand the multiscale cooling process and system problems. Recently, as a 
result of increased computational capacity, multiscale computational fluid 
dynamics (CFD) modeling approaches have been developed to tackle some of these 
challenges. The associated problems and applications of CFD in the design and 
process optimization of cooling processes and systems at different scales are 
considered. CFD solution and scale bridging techniques relevant for handling 
multiscale cooling processes and systems problems are discussed. Innovative 
applications of various CFD modeling techniques at different scales in cooling 
processes and systems are reviewed. CFD modeling techniques can be used to 
handle multiscale cooling process and system problems. Lattice Boltzmann method 
(LBM) is a potentially viable discrete modeling technique for complimentary 
usages alongside current continuum techniques in future multiscale CFD modeling. 
The multiscale CFD modeling paradigm can overcome the computational resource 
limitations associated with the direct modeling approach and enhance model 
extension across wider spatial and temporal scales. Information from multiscale 
CFD could be used to improve the accuracy of current porous medium models, and 
thus the design of more efficient cooling systems.

BACKGROUND: It is a familiar story. A promising multiple sclerosis (MS) 
treatment clears the three regulatory hurdles of safety, quality and efficacy, 
only to fall at the fourth: cost-effectiveness. This has led to concerns about 
the validity of the measures typically used to quantify treatment effects in 
cost-effectiveness analyses and in 2012, in the United Kingdom, the National 
Institute for Health and Care Excellence called for an improvement in the 
cost-effectiveness framework for assessing MS treatments.
OBJECTIVE AND METHODS: This review describes what is meant by cost-effectiveness 
in health/social care funding decision-making, and usual practice for assessing 
treatment benefits.
RESULTS: We detail the use of the quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) in resource 
allocation decisions, and set out limitations of this approach in the context of 
MS.
CONCLUSION: We conclude by highlighting methodological and policy developments 
which should aid addressing these limitations.

BACKGROUND: The addition of adjuvant trastuzumab to chemotherapy has 
significantly improved outcomes for people with human epidermal growth factor 
receptor 2 (HER2)-positive, early, potentially curable breast cancer. Twelve 
months' trastuzumab, tested in registration trials, was adopted as standard 
adjuvant treatment in 2006. Subsequently, similar outcomes were demonstrated 
using 9 weeks of trastuzumab. Shorter durations were therefore tested for 
non-inferiority.
OBJECTIVES: To establish whether or not 6 months' adjuvant trastuzumab is 
non-inferior to 12 months' in the treatment of HER2-positive early breast cancer 
using a primary end point of 4-year disease-free survival.
DESIGN: This was a Phase III randomised controlled non-inferiority trial.
SETTING: The setting was 152 NHS hospitals.
PARTICIPANTS: A total of 4088 patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer 
who it was planned would receive both chemotherapy and trastuzumab took part.
INTERVENTION: Randomisation (1 : 1) to 6 months' or 12 months' trastuzumab 
treatment.
MAIN OUTCOMES: The primary end point was disease-free survival. The secondary 
end points were overall survival, cost-effectiveness and cardiac function during 
treatment with trastuzumab. Assuming a 4-year disease-free survival rate of 80% 
with 12 months' trastuzumab, 4000 patients were required to demonstrate 
non-inferiority of 6 months' trastuzumab (5% one-sided significance, 85% power), 
defining the non-inferiority limit as no worse than 3% below the standard arm. 
Costs and quality-adjusted life-years were estimated using a within-trial 
analysis and a lifetime decision-analytic model.
RESULTS: Between 4 October 2007 and 31 July 2015, 2045 patients were randomised 
to 12 months' trastuzumab and 2043 were randomised to 6 months' trastuzumab. 
Sixty-nine per cent of patients had ER-positive disease; 90% received 
anthracyclines (49% with taxanes; 41% without taxanes); 10% received taxanes 
without anthracyclines; 54% received trastuzumab sequentially after 
chemotherapy; and 85% received adjuvant chemotherapy (58% were node negative). 
At 6.1 years' median follow-up, with 389 (10%) deaths and 566 (14%) disease-free 
survival events, the 4-year disease-free survival rates for the 4088 patients 
were 89.5% (95% confidence interval 88.1% to 90.8%) in the 6-month group and 
90.3% (95% confidence interval 88.9% to 91.5%) in the 12-month group (hazard 
ratio 1.10, 90% confidence interval 0.96 to 1.26; non-inferiority p = 0.01), 
demonstrating non-inferiority of 6 months' trastuzumab. Congruent results were 
found for overall survival (non-inferiority p = 0.0003) and landmark analyses 6 
months from starting trastuzumab [non-inferiority p = 0.03 
(disease-free-survival) and p = 0.006 (overall survival)]. Six months' 
trastuzumab resulted in fewer patients reporting adverse events of severe grade 
[365/1929 (19%) vs. 460/1935 (24%) for 12-month patients; p = 0.0003] or 
stopping early because of cardiotoxicity [61/1977 (3%) vs. 146/1941 (8%) for 
12-month patients; p < 0.0001]. Health economic analysis showed that 6 months' 
trastuzumab resulted in significantly lower lifetime costs than and similar 
lifetime quality-adjusted life-years to 12 months' trastuzumab, and thus there 
is a high probability that 6 months' trastuzumab is cost-effective compared with 
12 months' trastuzumab. Patient-reported experiences in the trial highlighted 
fatigue and aches and pains most frequently.
LIMITATIONS: The type of chemotherapy and timing of trastuzumab changed during 
the recruitment phase of the study as standard practice altered.
CONCLUSIONS: PERSEPHONE demonstrated that, in the treatment of HER2-positive 
early breast cancer, 6 months' adjuvant trastuzumab is non-inferior to 12 
months'. Six months' treatment resulted in significantly less cardiac toxicity 
and fewer severe adverse events.
FUTURE WORK: Ongoing translational work investigates patient and tumour genetic 
determinants of toxicity, and trastuzumab efficacy. An individual patient data 
meta-analysis with PHARE and other trastuzumab duration trials is planned.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN52968807, EudraCT 
2006-007018-39 and ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00712140.

Plain Language Summary: THE BACKGROUND: There are several different types of 
breast cancer and some are called ‘HER2 positive’. These cancers can often be 
cured by treatment with chemotherapy and a drug called trastuzumab (also known 
as Herceptin®; Roche, Basel, Switzerland). Although the first trials of 
trastuzumab used 12 months treatment, we did not know if less treatment could 
work as well. A small trial in Finland showed that giving trastuzumab for just 9 
weeks was also effective. We know that trastuzumab can have some side effects, 
including heart problems, so it was important to see if we could reduce the 
length of treatment time, which is usually 12 months.
WHAT DID WE DO? We wanted to find out if we could treat patients safely with 6 
months rather than 12 months of trastuzumab. We carried out a clinical trial 
called PERSEPHONE, in which over 4000 patients with this type of early breast 
cancer took part. Half of the patients were given 12 months of trastuzumab and 
half were given 6 months of trastuzumab.
WHAT DID WE FIND? We found that the two groups of patients had very similar 
benefit from treatment. At 4 years after diagnosis 90.3% of those who had 
received 12 months of trastuzumab were alive and free of any breast cancer 
recurrence, compared with 89.5% of those who had received 6 months. In other 
words, 125 patients would need to be treated with 12 months’ trastuzumab rather 
than 6 months’ trastuzumab for one more person to be alive and cancer-free 4 
years from diagnosis.
THE SIDE EFFECTS? Severe side effects of trastuzumab were seen on at least one 
occasion in 24% of 12-month patients compared with 19% of 6-month patients. More 
patients receiving 12 months of trastuzumab had to stop trastuzumab early 
because of heart problems (8% of 12-month patients compared with 3% of 6-month 
patients).
WHAT DOES THIS ALL MEAN? We have shown that 6 months of trastuzumab has similar 
outcomes to 12 months in treating patients with HER2-positive early breast 
cancer but with fewer severe side effects, including heart problems, fewer 
visits to hospital for patients and significant cost savings for the NHS.

IMPORTANCE: Between 2 and 3.5 million people live with chronic hepatitis C virus 
(HCV) infection in the US, most of whom (approximately 75%) are not aware of 
their disease. Despite the availability of effective HCV treatment in the early 
stages of infection, HCV will result in thousands of deaths in the next decade 
in the US.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the cost-effectiveness of universal screening for all 
US adults aged 18 years or older for HCV in the US and of targeted screening of 
people who inject drugs.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This simulated economic evaluation used 
cohort analyses in a Markov model to perform a 10 000-participant Monte Carlo 
microsimulation trail to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of HCV screening 
programs, and compared screening programs targeting people who inject drugs with 
universal screening of US adults age 18 years or older. Data were analyzed in 
December 2019.
EXPOSURES: Cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Cost per QALY gained.
RESULTS: In a 10 000 Monte Carlo microsimulation trail that compared a baseline 
of individuals aged 40 years (men and women) and people who inject drugs in the 
US, screening and treatment for HCV were estimated to increase total costs by 
$10 457 per person and increase QALYs by 0.23 (approximately 3 months), 
providing an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $45 465 per QALY. Also, 
universal screening and treatment for HCV are estimated to increase total costs 
by $2845 per person and increase QALYs by 0.01, providing an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio of $291 277 per QALY.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The findings of this study suggest that HCV screening 
for people who inject drugs may be a cost-effective intervention to combat HCV 
infection in the US, which could potentially decrease the risk of untreated HCV 
infection and liver-related mortality.

The incidence of most cancers increases with age. Cancer is the second most 
common cause of death in older adults after cardiovascular disease. Many common 
cancers in older adults can be prevented from occurring or can be identified at 
an early stage and treated effectively. The prevention and identification of 
cancer in its early stages, in an attempt to reduce discomfort and disability 
associated with advanced cancer and cancer treatment, is also a priority. 
Overscreening for cancer in older adults can lead to unnecessary diagnostic 
testing and unnecessary treatment. Both older adults and their healthcare 
providers need guidance on the appropriate use of cancer prevention and 
screening interventions. This first of a two-part review addresses special 
considerations regarding cancer prevention for adults aged 65 and older. 
Screening decisions and the impact of limited life expectancy and an older 
adult's ability to tolerate cancer treatment are also addressed. Guidance is 
provided regarding the prevention and early identification of lung, colorectal, 
bladder, and kidney cancer in older adults. The prevention of breast, prostate, 
and female urogenital cancers are addressed in Part 2. J Am Geriatr Soc

Institute of Science, Bangalore, Karnataka, India.

BACKGROUND: The treatment of non-melanoma skin cancer and deadliest malignant 
melanoma skin cancer are the fifth and ninth most expensive treatments in 
Medicare, respectively. Moreover, the recurrence of cancer after currently 
available therapies, that is, surgery or radiotherapy, reduces the patient's 
life expectancy.
AIMS: In view of this, we fabricated magnetic nanofibrous mat-based bandage to 
treat skin cancer non-invasively using an external alternating current (AC) 
magnetic field induced hyperthermia.
METHODS: The Fe3 O4 nanoparticles incorporated polycaprolactone (PCL) fibers 
based bandages were fabricated using the electrospinning technique. The efficacy 
of the bandage was investigated in vitro using parental/doxorubicin 
hydrochloride (Dox)-resistant HeLa cells and in vivo using BALB/c mouse model in 
the presence of an external AC magnetic field (AMF).
RESULTS: The PCL-Fe3 O4 fibrous mat-based bandages dissipate heat energy locally 
on the application of an external AMF and increase the surrounding temperature 
in a controlled way up to 45°C in a few mins. The in vitro study confirms the 
elevated temperature could kill parental and Dox-resistant HeLa cells 
significantly. As the activity of Dox enhanced at a higher temperatures, more 
than 85% of parental HeLa cells were dead when cells incubated with Dox 
contained fibrous mat in the presence of AMF for 10 minutes. Further, we confirm 
the full recovery of chemically induced skin tumors on BALB/c mice within a 
month after five hyperthermic doses for 15 minutes. Also, there was no sign of 
inflammation and recurrence of cancer post-therapy.
CONCLUSION: The present study confirms the PCL-Fe3 O4 nanofibrous based bandages 
are unique and compelling to treat skin cancer.

BACKGROUND: Hand transplantation and advances in the field of prostheses have 
opened new frontiers in the restoration of hand function among bilateral hand 
amputees (BHA). There is only scarce literature evaluating the health utility 
(HU) and quality adjusted life years (QALY) gained by bilateral hand composite 
tissue allotransplantation (CTA) or prosthesis over amputation. The study was 
focused on BHA restored with prosthesis or CTA.
METHODS: The HU of three different health states (HS) namely, BHA, using 
prosthesis or with CTA and net QALYs gained by hand transplantation or 
prosthesis over amputation were computed by time trade-off (TTO) method among 
236 study participants.
RESULTS: Among 236 study participants, medical professional (120), general 
public (89), BHA (23), and bilateral hand transplant recipients (4) were 
included. The mean HU by TTO method among the study participants (n = 232) as 
BHA, using prosthesis or CTA was 0.34 (±0.24), 0.50 (±0.26) and 0.69 (±0.26) 
respectively. Bilateral hand CTA imparted an expected gain of 12.57 (±11.43) 
mean QALYs over amputation among the study participants. The subgroup analysis 
displayed higher mean HU in hand CTA recipient HS along with maximum QALY gained 
by CTA over amputation.
CONCLUSIONS: Bilateral hand CTA HS stands above the other 2 HSs, namely BHA and 
prosthesis, in terms of the health utility. As demonstrated by QALY gain of 
12.57, participants' valuation of health utility is notably higher for CTA with 
acceptance of lifelong immunosuppressant rather than for a state of 
uncompromised physical health with a bilateral hand amputation.
