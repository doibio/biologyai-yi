Physical activity increases life expectancy and sport is a priori not harmful. 
Exhausted sporting activity (e.g. endurance running, triathlon, cycling or 
competitive sport) can lead under individual conditions to negative cardiac 
remodelling (pathological enlargement/function of cardiac cavities/structures) 
or in worst case to cardiac arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death (SCD). This 
individually disposition can be genetically determined or 
behaviourally/environmentally acquired. Overall competitive young male athletes 
suffer five-fold higher than non-competitive athletes from sudden death and 
athletes aged over 30 bear a potential for arrhythmias, atrial fibrillation or a 
20-fold higher possibility for SCD as female athletes. Patients with diabetes, 
coronary disease, obesity or hypertension require different special managements. 
Screening of cardiorespiratory health for sport activities has a lot of faces. 
Basically there is a need for indicated examinations or possible preventive 
measures inside or outside of pre-competition screening. The costs of screening 
compared to expenditure of whole effort for sporting activities are acceptable 
or even negligible, but of course dependent on national/regional settings. The 
various causes and possibilities of screening will be discussed in this article 
as basic suggestion for an open discussion beyond national borders and settings.

INTRODUCTION: The number of cancer cases and related deaths worldwide is 
expected to double over the next 20-30 years. African countries will be the most 
affected by the burden of cancer. The improving economic situation of Angola 
creates conditions for an increase in life expectancy which by itself is 
associated with an increased risk of oncological diseases. Because cancer 
therapy requires a multidisciplinary approach, trained health professionals, 
satisfactory infrastructure and appropriate facilities, the availability of 
effective cancer therapy is a difficult task that requires support. The aim of 
this article is to share our experience achieved in the establishment of cancer 
units in Angola and to validate our checklist for this action.
METHODS: The survey method was a questionnaire addressed to Angolan cancer 
units, in order to evaluate the usefulness and feasibility of a checklist 
developed by the authors--The Cancer Units Assessment Checklist for low or 
middle income African countries--which was used previously in the establishment 
of those units. Afterwards, the crucial steps taken for the establishing of the 
main sites of each cancer unit considering, facilities, resources and 
professionals, were also recorded.
RESULTS: All cancer units reported that the checklist was a useful tool in the 
development of the cancer program for the improvement of the unit or the 
establishing of cancer unit sites. This instrument helped identifying resources, 
defining the best practice and identifying barriers. Local experts, who know the 
best practices in oncology and who are recognized by the local heads, are also 
important and they proved to be the major facilitators.
CONCLUSION: The fight against cancer has just started in Angola. The training, 
education, advocacy and legislation are ongoing. According to our results, the 
assessment checklist for the establishment of cancer units is a useful 
instrument.

Secundum atrial septal defect in adults: a practical review and recent 
developments.

Secundum atrial septal defect (ASDII) is a common congenital heart defect that 
causes shunting of blood between the systemic and pulmonary circulations. 
Patients with an isolated ASDII often remain asymptomatic during childhood and 
adolescence. If the defect remains untreated, however, the rates of exercise 
intolerance, supraventricular arrhythmias, right ventricular dysfunction and 
pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) increase with patient age, and life 
expectancy is reduced. Transcatheter and surgical techniques both provide valid 
options for ASDII closure, the former being the preferred method. With the 
exception of those with severe and irreversible PAH, closure is beneficial to, 
and thus indicated in all patients with significant shunts, regardless of age 
and symptoms. The symptomatic and survival benefits conferred by defect closure 
are inversely related to patient age and the presence of PAH, supporting timely 
closure after diagnosis. In this paper we review the management of adult 
patients with an isolated ASDII, with a focus on aspects of importance to the 
decision regarding defect closure and medical follow-up.

BACKGROUND: It is anticipated that demands on ambulatory HIV services will 
increase in coming years as a consequence of the increased life expectancy of 
HIV patients on highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART). Accurate cost 
data are needed to enable evidence based policy decisions be made about new 
models of service delivery, new technologies and new medications.
METHODS: A micro-costing study was carried out in an HIV outpatient clinic in a 
single regional centre in the south of Ireland. The costs of individual 
appointment types were estimated based on staff grade and time. Hospital 
resources used by HIV patients who attended the ambulatory care service in 2012 
were identified and extracted from existing hospital systems. Associations 
between patient characteristics and costs per patient month, in 2012 euros, were 
examined using univariate and multivariate analyses.
RESULTS: The average cost of providing ambulatory HIV care was found to be €973 
(95% confidence interval €938-€1008) per patient month in 2012. Sensitivity 
analysis, varying the base-case staff time estimates by 20% and diagnostic 
testing costs by 60%, estimated the average cost to vary from a low of €927 per 
patient month to a high of €1019 per patient month. The vast majority of costs 
were due to the cost of HAART. Women were found to have significantly higher 
HAART costs per patient month while patients over 50 years of age had 
significantly lower HAART costs using multivariate analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides the estimated cost of ambulatory care in a 
regional HIV centre in Ireland. These data are valuable for planning services at 
a local level, and the identification of patient factors, such as age and 
gender, associated with resource use is of interest both nationally and 
internationally for the long-term planning of HIV care provision.

BACKGROUND: Most older adults want to live independently in a familiar 
environment instead of moving to a nursing home. Preventive home visits based on 
multidimensional geriatric assessment can be one strategy to support this 
preference and might additionally reduce health care costs, due to the avoidance 
of costly nursing home admissions. The purpose of this study was to analyse the 
cost-effectiveness of preventive home visits from a societal perspective in 
Germany.
METHODS: This study is part of a multi-centre, non-blinded, randomised 
controlled trial aiming at the reduction of nursing home admissions. 
Participants were older than 80 years and living at home. Up to three home 
visits were conducted to identify self-care deficits and risk factors, to 
present recommendations and to implement solutions. The control group received 
usual care. A cost-utility analysis using quality-adjusted life years (QALY) 
based on the EQ-5D was performed. Resource utilization was assessed by means of 
the interview version of a patient questionnaire. A cost-effectiveness 
acceptability curve controlled for prognostic variables was constructed and a 
sensitivity analysis to control for the influence of the mode of QALY 
calculation was performed.
RESULTS: 278 individuals (intervention group: 133; control group: 145) were 
included in the analysis. During 18 months follow-up mean adjusted total cost 
(mean: +4,401 EUR; bootstrapped standard error: 3,019.61 EUR) and number of QALY 
(mean: 0.0061 QALY; bootstrapped standard error: 0.0388 QALY) were higher in the 
intervention group, but differences were not significant. For preventive home 
visits the probability of an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio <50,000 EUR 
per QALY was only 15%. The results were robust with respect to the mode of QALY 
calculation.
CONCLUSIONS: The evaluated preventive home visits programme is unlikely to be 
cost-effective.

BACKGROUND: Despite positive changes in the health of the population of Poland, 
compared to the EU average, the average life expectancy in 2011 was 5 years 
shorter for males and 2.2 years shorter for females. The immediate cause is the 
great number of premature deaths, which results in years of life lost in the 
population. The aim of the study was to identify the major causes of years of 
life lost in Poland.
METHODS: The analysis was based on a database of the Central Statistical Office 
of Poland, containing information gathered from 375,501 death certificates of 
inhabitants of Poland who died in 2011. The SEYLLp (Standard Expected Years of 
Life Lost per living person) and the SEYLLd (SEYLL per death) measures were 
calculated to determine years of life lost.
RESULTS: In 2011, the total number of years of life lost by in Polish residents 
due to premature mortality was 2,249,213 (1,415,672 for males and 833,541 for 
females). The greatest number of years of life lost in males were due to 
ischemic heart disease (7.8 per 1,000), lung cancer (6.0), suicides (6.6), 
cerebrovascular disease (4.6) and road traffic accidents (5.4). In females, the 
factors contributing to the greatest number of deaths were cerebrovascular 
disease (3.8 per 1,000), ischemic heart disease (3.7), heart failure (2.7), lung 
cancer (2.5) and breast cancer (2.3). Regarding the individual scores per person 
in both males and females, the greatest death factors were road traffic 
accidents (20.2 years in males and 17.1 in females), suicides (17.4 years in 
males and 15.4 in females) and liver cirrhosis (12.1 years in males and 11.3 in 
females).
CONCLUSIONS: It would be most beneficial to further reduce the number of deaths 
due to cardiovascular diseases, because they contribute to the greatest number 
of years of life lost. Moreover, from the economic point of view, the most 
effective preventative activities are those which target causes which result in 
a large number of years of life lost at productive age for each death due to a 
particular reason, i.e. road traffic accidents, suicides and liver cirrhosis.

BACKGROUND: Many publicly-funded health systems apply cost-benefit frameworks in 
response to the moral dilemma of how best to allocate scarce healthcare 
resources. However, implementation of recommendations based on costs and benefit 
calculations and subsequent challenges have led to 'special cases' with certain 
types of health benefits considered more valuable than others. Recent debate and 
research has focused on the relative value of life extensions for people with 
terminal illnesses. This research investigates societal perspectives in relation 
to this issue, in the UK.
METHODS: Q methodology was used to elicit societal perspectives from a 
purposively selected sample of data-rich respondents. Participants ranked 49 
statements of opinion (developed for this study), onto a grid, according to 
level of agreement. These 'Q sorts' were followed by brief interviews. Factor 
analysis was used to identify shared points of view (patterns of similarity 
between individuals' Q sorts).
RESULTS: Analysis produced a three factor solution. These rich, shared accounts 
can be broadly summarised as: i) 'A population perspective - value for money, no 
special cases', ii) 'Life is precious - valuing life-extension and patient 
choice', iii) 'Valuing wider benefits and opportunity cost - the quality of life 
and death'. From the factor descriptions it is clear that the main philosophical 
positions that have long dominated debates on the just allocation of resources 
have a basis in public opinion.
CONCLUSIONS: The existence of certain moral positions in the views of society 
does not ethically imply, and pragmatically cannot mean, that all are translated 
into policy. Our findings highlight normative tensions and the importance of 
critically engaging with these normative issues (in addition to the current 
focus on a procedural justice approach to health policy). Future research should 
focus on i) the extent to which these perspectives are supported in society, ii) 
how respondents' perspectives relate to specific resource allocation questions, 
and iii) the characteristics of respondents associated with each perspective.

BACKGROUND: Life expectancy (LE) at birth has increased steadily in Bangladesh 
since its independence. When people live longer, quality of life becomes a 
central issue. This study examines whether healthy life expectancy (HLE) at ages 
15, 25, 35, and 45 is keeping pace with LE at those ages between 1996 and 2002. 
It also seeks to investigate the correlates of self-rated health (SRH) in 1996 
and 2002.
METHODS: We used data from the World Values Survey conducted in 1996 and 2002 
among individuals 15 years and older. The Sullivan method was used to compute 
HLE. Socio-demographic differences and their association with different states 
of health were examined by chi-square and Pearson's correlation tests. Multiple 
linear regression models were fitted to examine the correlates of SRH.
RESULTS: The results show that perceived health improved between 1996 and 2002. 
For males, statistically significant increases in the expected number of years 
lived in good SRH were found. Proportionally, in 2002, both males and females at 
ages 15, 25, 35 and 45 expected more life years in good health and fewer life 
years in fair and poor health than did their counterparts in 1996. 
Comparatively, males expected fewer life years spent in good health but a much 
larger proportion of expected life in good health than did females. Finally, in 
multivariate analyses, life satisfaction was the only factor found to be 
significantly and positively associated with SRH for males and females in both 
years, although in both years the association was much more pronounced for 
females than for males.
CONCLUSION: This study documented changes in HLE during 1996-2002. Women outlive 
men, but they have a lower quality of life and are more likely to live a greater 
part of their remaining life in poor SRH. Life satisfaction as well as other 
significant factors associated with SRH should be promoted, with special 
attention given to women, to improve healthy life expectancy and the quality of 
life of the Bangladeshi people.

BACKGROUND: Inequalities in health are acknowledged in many developed countries, 
whereby disadvantaged groups systematically suffer from worse health outcomes 
such as lower life expectancy than non-disadvantaged groups. Engaging members of 
disadvantaged communities in public health initiatives has been suggested as a 
way to reduce health inequities. This systematic review was conducted to 
evaluate the effectiveness of public health interventions that engage the 
community on a range of health outcomes across diverse health issues.
METHODS: We searched the following sources for systematic reviews of public 
health interventions: Cochrane CDSR and CENTRAL, Campbell Library, DARE, NIHR 
HTA programme website, HTA database, and DoPHER. Through the identified reviews, 
we collated a database of primary studies that appeared to be relevant, and 
screened the full-text documents of those primary studies against our inclusion 
criteria. In parallel, we searched the NHS EED and TRoPHI databases for 
additional primary studies. For the purposes of these analyses, study design was 
limited to randomised and non-randomised controlled trials. Only interventions 
conducted in OECD countries and published since 1990 were included. We conducted 
a random effects meta-analysis of health behaviour, health consequences, 
self-efficacy, and social support outcomes, and a narrative summary of community 
outcomes. We tested a range of moderator variables, with a particular emphasis 
on the model of community engagement used as a potential moderator of 
intervention effectiveness.
RESULTS: Of the 9,467 primary studies scanned, we identified 131 for inclusion 
in the meta-analysis. The overall effect size for health behaviour outcomes is 
d = .33 (95% CI .26, .40). The interventions were also effective in increasing 
health consequences (d = .16, 95% CI .06, .27); health behaviour self-efficacy 
(d = .41, 95% CI .16, .65) and perceived social support (d = .41, 95% CI .23, 
.65). Although the type of community engagement was not a significant moderator 
of effect, we identified some trends across studies.
CONCLUSIONS: There is solid evidence that community engagement interventions 
have a positive impact on a range of health outcomes across various conditions. 
There is insufficient evidence to determine whether one particular model of 
community engagement is more effective than any other.

INTRODUCTION: Fabry disease (FD) is a lysosomal storage disorder resulting in 
progressive nervous system, kidney and heart disease. Enzyme replacement therapy 
(ERT) may halt or attenuate disease progression. Since administration is 
burdensome and expensive, appropriate use is mandatory. We aimed to define 
European consensus recommendations for the initiation and cessation of ERT in 
patients with FD.
METHODS: A Delphi procedure was conducted with an online survey (n = 28) and a 
meeting (n = 15). Patient organization representatives were present at the 
meeting to give their views. Recommendations were accepted with ≥75% agreement 
and no disagreement.
RESULTS: For classically affected males, consensus was achieved that ERT is 
recommended as soon as there are early clinical signs of kidney, heart or brain 
involvement, but may be considered in patients of ≥16 years in the absence of 
clinical signs or symptoms of organ involvement. Classically affected females 
and males with non-classical FD should be treated as soon as there are early 
clinical signs of kidney, heart or brain involvement, while treatment may be 
considered in females with non-classical FD with early clinical signs that are 
considered to be due to FD. Consensus was achieved that treatment should not be 
withheld from patients with severe renal insufficiency (GFR < 45 
ml/min/1.73 m(2)) and from those on dialysis or with cognitive decline, but 
carefully considered on an individual basis. Stopping ERT may be considered in 
patients with end stage FD or other co-morbidities, leading to a life expectancy 
of <1 year. In those with cognitive decline of any cause, or lack of response 
for 1 year when the sole indication for ERT is neuropathic pain, stopping ERT 
may be considered. Also, in patients with end stage renal disease, without an 
option for renal transplantation, in combination with advanced heart failure 
(NYHA class IV), cessation of ERT should be considered. ERT in patients who are 
non-compliant or fail to attend regularly at visits should be stopped.
CONCLUSION: The recommendations can be used as a benchmark for initiation and 
cessation of ERT, although final decisions should be made on an individual 
basis. Future collaborative efforts are needed for optimization of these 
recommendations.

BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer is associated with high morbidity and mortality 
rates among young women in Japan. The objective of this study was to assess and 
project the economic burden associated with cervical cancer in Japan and 
identify factors affecting future changes in this burden on society.
METHODS: Utilizing government-based statistical nationwide data, we used the 
cost of illness (COI) method to estimate the COIs for 1996, 1999, 2002, 2005, 
2008, and 2011 to make predictions for 2014, 2017, and 2020. The COI comprised 
direct and indirect costs (morbidity and mortality costs).
RESULTS: The COI was estimated to have increased by 66% from 96.1 billion yen in 
1996 to 159.9 billion yen in 2011. The number of deaths increased, but the 
proportion of those aged ≥65 years as a percentage of all deaths remained mostly 
unchanged, with no increase in the average age at death. The mortality cost per 
person was estimated to have increased (31.5 million yen in 1996 vs. 43.5 
million yen in 2011). Assuming that the current trend in health-related 
indicators continues, the COI is predicted to temporarily decrease in 2014, 
followed by almost no change in 2020 (the estimated COI is 145.3-164.6 billion 
yen). The mortality cost per person is predicted to remain almost unchanged 
(39.4-46.3 million yen in 2020).
CONCLUSIONS: The fact that the life expectancy of affected individuals is not 
being prolonged and that the mortality in young individuals with a high human 
capital value is not decreasing may contribute to future sustainment of the COI. 
We believe that the results of the present study are applicable to discussions 
of disease control priorities.

BACKGROUND: In Estonia, women have much longer life expectancy than men. The aim 
of this study was to examine sex differences in cancer survival in Estonia and 
to explore the role of age at diagnosis, stage at diagnosis and tumour subsite.
METHODS: Using data from the population-based Estonian Cancer Registry, we 
examined the relative survival of adult patients diagnosed with nine common 
cancers in Estonia in 1995-2006 and followed up through 2011. Excess hazard 
ratios (EHR) of death associated with female gender adjusted for age, stage at 
diagnosis and tumour subsite were estimated.
RESULTS: A total of 20 828 male and 13 166 female cases were analysed. The main 
data quality indicators were similar between men and women. Women had more cases 
with unknown extent of disease at diagnosis. Overall, the age-adjusted 5-year 
relative survival ratio was higher among women than men for all studied sites, 
but the difference was significant for cancers of mouth and pharynx (22% units), 
lung (5% units), skin melanoma (17% units) and kidney (8% units). The increase 
in survival over time was larger for women than men for cancers of mouth and 
pharynx, colon, rectum, kidney and skin melanoma. In multivariate analysis, 
women had a significantly lower EHR of death within five years after diagnosis 
for five of the nine cancers studied (cancers of mouth and pharynx, stomach, 
lung, skin melanoma and kidney). Adjustment for stage and subsite explained 
some, but not all of the women's advantage.
CONCLUSIONS: We found a significant female survival advantage in Estonia for 
cancers of mouth and pharynx, stomach, lung, kidney and skin melanoma. The 
differences in favour of women tended to increase over time as from the 1990s to 
the 2000s, survival improved more among women than among men. A large part of 
the women's advantage is likely attributable to biological factors, but other 
factors, such as co-morbidities, treatment compliance or health behaviour, are 
also probable contributors to gender survival disparities in Estonia and merit 
further investigation. Our findings have implications for public health, early 
detection and cancer care in Estonia.

OBJECTIVE: High levels of high-frequency heart rate variability (HF-HRV), 
related to parasympathetic-nervous-system functioning, have been associated with 
longer survival in patients with myocardial infarction and acute trauma and in 
patients undergoing palliative care. From animal studies linking higher vagal 
activity with better immune system functioning and reduced metastases, we 
hypothesized that higher HF-HRV would predict longer survival in patients with 
metastatic or recurrent breast cancer (MRBC).
METHODS: Eighty-seven patients with MRBC participated in a laboratory task 
including a 5-minute resting baseline electrocardiogram. HF-HRV was computed as 
the natural logarithm of the summed power spectral density of R-R intervals 
(0.15-0.50 Hz). In this secondary analysis of a study testing whether diurnal 
cortisol slope predicted survival, we tested the association between resting 
baseline HF-HRV on survival using Cox proportional hazards models.
RESULTS: A total of 50 patients died during a median follow-up of 7.99 years. 
Higher baseline HF-HRV predicted significantly longer survival, with a hazard 
ratio of 0.75 (95% confidence interval = 0.60-0.92, p = .006). Visceral 
metastasis status and baseline heart rate were related to both HF-HRV and 
survival. However, a combination of HF-HRV and heart rate further improved 
survival prediction, with a hazard ratio of 0.64 (95% confidence interval = 
0.48-0.85, p = .002).
CONCLUSIONS: Vagal activity of patients with MRBC strongly predicted their 
survival, extending the known predictive window of HF-HRV in cancer beyond 
palliative care. Vagal activity can be altered by behavioral, pharmacological, 
and surgical interventions and may be a promising target for extending life 
expectancy in patients with metastasizing cancer.

BACKGROUND: In the general population the prevalence of bipolar and 
schizophrenia is 0.24% and 1.4% respectively. People with schizophrenia and 
bipolar disorder have a significantly reduced life expectancy, increased rates 
of unemployment and a fear of stigma leading to reduced self-confidence. A core 
outcome set is a standardised collection of items that should be reported in all 
controlled trials within a research area. There are currently no core outcome 
sets available for use in effectiveness trials involving bipolar or 
schizophrenia service users managed in a community setting.
METHODS: A three-step approach is to be used to concurrently develop two core 
outcome sets, one for bipolar and one for schizophrenia. First, a comprehensive 
list of outcomes will be compiled through qualitative research and systematic 
searching of trial databases. Focus groups and one-to-one interviews will be 
completed with service users, carers and healthcare professionals. Second, a 
Delphi study will be used to reduce the lists to a core set. The three-round 
Delphi study will ask service users to score the outcome list for relevance. In 
round two stakeholders will only see the results of their group, while in round 
three stakeholders will see the results of all stakeholder group by stakeholder 
group. Third, a consensus meeting with stakeholders will be used to confirm 
outcomes to be included in the core set. Following the development of the core 
set a systematic literature review of existing measures will allow 
recommendations for how the core outcomes should be measured and a stated 
preference survey will explore the strength of people's preferences and estimate 
weights for the outcomes that comprise the core set.
DISCUSSION: A core outcome set represents the minimum measurement requirement 
for a research area. We aim to develop core outcome sets for use in research 
involving service users with schizophrenia or bipolar managed in a community 
setting. This will inform the wider PARTNERS2 study aims and objectives of 
developing an innovative primary care-based model of collaborative care for 
people with a diagnosis of bipolar or schizophrenia.

INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: The health indicator disability-adjusted life years 
combines the fatal and nonfatal consequences of a disease in a single measure. 
The aim of this study was to evaluate the burden of ischemic heart disease in 
2008 in Spain by calculating disability-adjusted life years.
METHODS: The years of life lost due to premature death were calculated using the 
ischemic heart disease deaths by age and sex recorded in the Spanish National 
Institute of Statistics and the life-table in the 2010 Global Burden of Disease 
study. The years lived with disability, calculated for acute coronary syndrome, 
stable angina, and ischemic heart failure, used hospital discharge data and 
information from population studies. Disability weights were taken from the 2010 
Global Burden of Disease study. We calculated crude and age standardized rates 
(European Standard Population). Univariate sensitivity analyses were performed.
RESULTS: In 2008, 539 570 disability-adjusted life years were lost due to 
ischemic heart disease in Spain (crude rate, 11.8/1000 population; standardized, 
8.6/1000). Of the total years lost, 96% were due to premature death and 4% due 
to disability. Among the years lost due to disability, heart failure accounted 
for 83%, stable angina 15%, and acute coronary syndrome 2%. In the sensitivity 
analysis, weighting by age was the factor that changed the results to the 
greatest degree.
CONCLUSIONS: Ischemic heart disease continues to have a huge impact on the 
health of our population, mainly because of premature death. The results of this 
study provide an overall vision of the epidemiologic situation in Spain and 
could serve as the basis for evaluating interventions targeting the acute and 
chronic manifestations of cardiac ischemia.

BACKGROUND: Achieving the goal of eliminating mother-to-child HIV transmission 
(MTCT) necessitates increased access to antiretroviral therapy (ART) for 
HIV-infected pregnant women. Option B provides ART through pregnancy and 
breastfeeding, whereas Option B+ recommends continuous ART regardless of CD4 
count, thus potentially reducing MTCT during future pregnancies. Our objective 
was to compare maternal and pediatric health outcomes and cost-effectiveness of 
Option B+ versus Option B in Ghana.
METHODS: A decision-analytic model was developed to simulate HIV progression in 
mothers and transmission (in utero, during birth, or through breastfeeding) to 
current and all future children. Clinical parameters, including antenatal care 
access and fertility rates, were estimated from a retrospective review of 817 
medical records at two hospitals in Ghana. Additional parameters were obtained 
from published literature. Modeled outcomes include HIV infections averted among 
newborn children, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and cost-effectiveness 
ratios.
RESULTS: HIV-infected women in Ghana have a lifetime average of 2.3 children (SD 
1.3). Projected maternal life expectancy under Option B+ is 16.1 years, versus 
16.0 years with Option B, yielding a gain of 0.1 maternal QALYs and 3.2 
additional QALYs per child. Despite higher initial ART costs, Option B+ costs 
$785/QALY gained, a value considered very cost-effective by World Health 
Organization benchmarks. Widespread implementation of Option B+ in Ghana could 
theoretically prevent up to 668 HIV infections among children annually. 
Cost-effectiveness estimates remained favorable over robust sensitivity 
analyses.
CONCLUSIONS: Although more expensive than Option B, Option B+ substantially 
reduces MTCT in future pregnancies, increases both maternal and pediatric QALYs, 
and is a cost-effective use of limited resources in Ghana.

BACKGROUND: Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has extended life 
expectancy and enhanced the well-being of HIV-positive individuals. Since there 
are concerns regarding HAART-mediated onset of cardio-metabolic diseases in the 
long-term, we evaluated the anthropometric profile of black HIV-infected 
individuals in a peri-urban setting (Western Cape, South Africa).
METHODS: A cross sectional study design was followed to describe the gender 
differences in different HAART treatment groups. HIV-positive patients (n = 44 
males, n = 102 females; 20-40 years) were recruited for three groups: 1) control 
(HIV-positive, HAART-naïve), 2) HIV-positive (<3 years HAART), and 3) 
HIV-positive (>3 years HAART).
RESULTS: All participants underwent comprehensive anthropometric and 
bio-electrical impedance analyses. No significant differences were observed in 
the male treatment groups. HAART-naïve females are mostly overweight 
(73.90 ± 2.79). This is followed by a period of muscle wasting seen in the 
triceps skinfold (29.30 ± 2.19 vs 20.63 ± 1.83; p < 0.01), muscle mass 
(22.23 ± 0.46 vs 19.82 ± 0.54; p < 0.01), and fat free mass (49.40 ± 1.08 vs 
44.16 ± 1.21; p < 0.01) upon HAART initiation (<3 years HAART). Thereafter all 
parameters measured had levels similar to that seen for the female HAART-naïve 
group. Females on <3 years HAART exhibited significantly decreased body cell 
mass (p < 0.01), protein mass (p < 0.01), muscle mass (p < 0.01), fat free mass 
(p < 0.01), and fat mass (p < 0.001) versus matched HAART-naïve controls. The 
W:H ratio for the female treatment groups placed the females overall at a higher 
risk for developing cardiovascular disease compared to the males.
CONCLUSIONS: This study found striking gender-based anthropometric differences 
in black South African HIV-positive individuals on HAART. We also conclude from
