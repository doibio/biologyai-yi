BACKGROUND: Elderly patients diagnosed with high-risk prostate cancer (PCa) 
present a therapeutic dilemma of balancing treatment of a potentially lethal 
malignancy with overtreatment of a cancer that may not threaten life expectancy.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate treatment patterns and overall survival outcomes in 
this group of patients.
DESIGN SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted. We 
queried the National Cancer Database for high-risk PCa in patients aged 80 yr or 
older diagnosed during 2004-2016.
INTERVENTION: Eligible patients underwent no treatment following biopsy (ie, 
observation), androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) alone, radiation therapy (RT) 
alone, RT + ADT, or surgery.
OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Kaplan-Meier, log rank, and 
multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression was performed to compare overall 
survival (OS).
RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: A total of 19 920 men were eligible for analysis, and 
the most common treatment approach was RT + ADT (7401 patients; 37.2%). 
Observation and ADT alone declined over time (59.3% in 2004 vs 47.5% in 2016). 
There was no observed difference in OS between observation and ADT alone 
(adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 1.04, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.99-1.09; 
p = 0.105). Definitive local treatment was associated with improved OS compared 
with ADT alone (RT alone, HR 0.54, 95% CI, 0.50-0.59, p < 0.0001; ADT + RT, HR 
0.48, 95% CI, 0.46-0.50, p < 0.0001; surgery, HR 0.50, 95% CI, 0.42-0.59, 
p < 0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: This analysis demonstrates that the use of definitive local 
therapy, including surgery or RT ± ADT, is increasing and is associated with a 
50% reduction in overall mortality compared with observation or ADT alone. While 
prospective validation is warranted, elderly men with high-risk disease eligible 
for definitive management should be counseled on the risks, including a possible 
compromise in OS, with deferring definitive management.
PATIENT SUMMARY: Elderly men are more often diagnosed with higher-risk prostate 
cancer but are less likely to receive curative treatment options than younger 
men. Our analysis demonstrates that for men ≥80 yr of age with high-risk 
prostate cancer, definitive local therapy, including surgery or radiation 
therapy and/or androgen deprivation therapy, is associated with a 50% reduction 
in overall mortality compared with observation or androgen deprivation therapy 
alone. We therefore recommend that life expectancy (ie, physiologic age) be 
taken into account, over chronologic age, and that elderly men with good life 
expectancy (eg, >5 yr; minimal comorbidity) should be offered definitive, 
life-prolonging therapy.

Yellowfin goatfish Mulloidichthys vanicolensis (Valenciennes, 1831) is a widely 
distributed commercial fish in the Indo-Pacific. The authors examined the age, 
growth, sexual maturity and spawning season of M. vanicolensis around Okinawa 
Island, southwestern Japan, based on sectioned otolith and gonadal histology. 
Monthly changes in the appearance of an opaque edge indicate the annual 
formation of otolith bands. This fish shows sexual size dimorphism due to the 
faster growth and larger size of females compared to males. The von Bertalanffy 
growth functions were Lt  = 31.0{1 - exp(-0.39(t + 1.62))} for females and Lt 
 = 28.3{1 - exp(-0.42(t + 1.45))} for males. This species has a short life span, 
with a maximum age of 7.75 years, and reaches maturity in its first year of 
life. Observed fork lengths at 50% maturity were 19.4 cm for female and 16.2 cm 
for male. The main spawning season occurs from May to October. The authors 
compared their findings with those of previous studies on the life-history 
characteristics of M. vanicolensis. Spawning season, growth and maturity size 
differed from those found in previous studies in areas with genetic continuity. 
Differences in life-history traits between genetically continuous populations 
suggest a high degree of environmental adaptability for this species, which may 
be one of the reasons for its widespread distribution.

In this 52-week, phase 3 open-label study, efficacy and safety of adalimumab 
were evaluated in Japanese patients with active ulcers due to pyoderma 
gangrenosum (PG) during a 26-week treatment period and another 26-week extension 
period. Patients received adalimumab 160 mg at week 0, 80 mg at week 2, and 
40 mg every week from week 4. At week 26, 12 of 22 patients (54.5%, p < 0.001) 
achieved the primary efficacy endpoint of PG area reduction 100 (PGAR 100, 
complete skin re-epithelialization) for the target ulcer. Nine patients with 
Physician's Global Assessment (PGA) score of 1, 2, or 3, including four patients 
achieving PGAR 100, continued into the extension period. During the extension 
period, six of nine patients (66.7%) achieved PGAR 100 for the target PG ulcer 
at 52 weeks; one patient who achieved PGAR 100 before week 26 experienced a 
relapse 162 days after achieving this endpoint. Six patients achieved PGA 0 by 
week 52, and one patient reported new ulcers at day 57 of the extension period. 
Continued improvements from study baseline to week 52 were observed in pain 
(mean [95% CI] -4.0 [-6.5 to -1.5] numeric rating scale) and Dermatology Life 
Quality Index (-7.3 [-15.1 to 0.4]). In addition to the adverse events (AE) 
reported in 18 patients (including four serious AE) through week 26 (most 
commonly infections [n = 11]), there was one 1 additional AE (infection) during 
the extension period. These results suggest that adalimumab is effective and 
generally well tolerated in Japanese patients with active PG ulcers.

OBJECTIVES: Effective antiretroviral therapy (ART) has improved the life 
expectancy of women living with HIV (WLWH). This population is now experiencing 
age-related comorbidities. This systematic review presents the current 
understanding of the prevalence and impact of comorbidities in WLWH in the 
modern ART era.
METHODS: MEDLINE and Embase were searched for studies (1 January 2010 to 1 
September 2020) reporting the prevalence of cardiovascular, bone, renal and 
neurocognitive disease in WLWH aged > 18 years. Studies were included if at 
least 100 participants (or > 50%) were female and data analysis included 
prevalence by sex.
RESULTS: In all, 3050 articles were identified and screened; 153 full-text 
articles were assessed for eligibility and 38 were included in the final review. 
Significant gaps in the literature were identified, notably a lack of data on 
WLWH aged > 50 years. The data suggest a high burden of cardiovascular, bone, 
renal and neurocognitive disease in WLWH compared with HIV negative women. 
Traditional risk factors, such as hypertension, diabetes and dyslipidaemia, were 
common and often poorly managed. Generalizability of the results was limited, as 
many studies were conducted in the USA. Comparisons between WLWH and men with 
HIV were limited by marked differences in demographic and socioeconomic factors.
CONCLUSIONS: Women living with HIV experience a high burden of comorbid disease. 
Traditional risk factors are common and often poorly managed. This review also 
highlights the magnitude of differences between women and men living with HIV 
beyond the pathophysiological. Future research must unpick the complex drivers 
of morbidity in WLWH, to improve the holistic management of this population.

Conserved G-Quadruplex Motifs Regulate Gene Expression in Neisseria 
meningitidis.

Technology, Simrol, Indore 453552, India.

The noncanonical structures, G-quadruplexes (GQs), formed in the guanine-rich 
region of nucleic acids regulate various biological and molecular functions in 
prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Neisseria meningitidis is a commensal residing in a 
human's upper respiratory tract but occasionally becomes virulent, causing 
life-threatening septicemia and meningitis. The factors causing these changes in 
phenotypes are not fully understood. At the molecular level, regulatory 
components help in a clearer understanding of the pathogen's virulence and 
pathogenesis. Herein, genome analysis followed by biophysical assays and 
cell-based experiments revealed the presence of conserved GQ motifs in N. 
meningitidis. These GQs are linked to the essential genes involved in cell 
adhesion, pathogenesis, virulence, transport, DNA repair, and recombination. 
Primer extension stop assay, reporter assays, and quantitative real-time 
polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) further affirmed the formation of stable GQs 
in vitro and in vivo. These results support the existence of evolutionarily 
conserved GQ motifs in N. meningitidis and uphold the usage of GQ-specific 
ligands as novel antimeningococcal therapeutics.

AIM: To describe the burden of breast and gynecological cancers in Tunisia in 
2017, to analyze the trend between 1990 and 2017 and to performit's prediction 
by 2030.
METHODS: This was a study using data estimated by the Institute for Health 
Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) for years of life by breast cancer and 
gynecological cancers: ovary, cervix and uterus (endometrium and other 
unspecified parts of the uterus) in Tunisia in 2017.The trend analysis of age 
standardized DALYrate between 1990 and 2017 was analyzed by using Join Point 
software.The projection of number of DALY and YLL by 2030 was conducted by SPSS 
software using Age-Period-Cohort (APC) models.
RESULTS: In 2017, the age standardized DALYs rate for breast and gynecological 
cancers was 538.5/100,000 women. Breast cancer proved observed the highest rate 
of standardized DALY rate with 378.5/100,000 women followed by ovarian cancer 
(rate standardized DALY=72.7/100,000 women).The standardized DALY rate increased 
between 1990 and 2017 except for cervix cancer and uterine cancer which have 
been on a downward trend. According to the same conditions between 1990 and 
2017, the age standardized DALY rate in 2030 will reach 674.6/100,000 women (95% 
CI=667.2/100,000-682.1/100,000).
CONCLUSION: Strengthening prevention strategy against cancer in general and 
women's cancers in particularis strongly recommended to reduce cancer burden and 
to changeits trend.

BACKGROUND: Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) is a rare, autosomal, recessive DNA 
repair-deficiency disorder with a frequency of 1-3 per million livebirths in 
Europe and USA but with higher frequencies in isolated islands or in countries 
with a high level of consanguinity. XP is characterized by high incidence of 
skin cancers on sun-exposed sites. Recent improvement in life expectancy of XP 
patients suggests an increased risk of frequently aggressive and lethal internal 
tumors. Our purpose was to quantify relative risks of internal tumor development 
for XP patients by tumor type, XP-subtype, patients' ages and ethnicity through 
comparison with the US general population.
METHODS: We analyzed four independent international well-characterized XP 
cohorts (from USA, UK, France and Brazil) with a total of 434 patients, where 
11.3% developed internal tumors and compared them to the American general 
population. We also compiled, through PubMed/Medline, a dataset of 89 internal 
tumors in XP patients published between 1958 and 2020.
RESULTS: In the combined 4-XP cohort, relative risk of internal tumors was 34 
(95% confidence interval (CI) 25-47) times higher than in the general population 
(p-value = 1.0E-47) and tumor arose 50 years earlier. The XP-C group was at the 
highest risk for the 0-20 years old-patients (OR = 665; 95% CI 368-1200; 
p-value = 4.3E-30). The highest risks were observed for tumors of central 
nervous system (OR = 331; 95% CI 171-641; p-value = 2.4E-20), hematological 
malignancies (OR = 120; 95% CI 77-186; p-value = 3.7E-36), thyroid (OR = 74; 95% 
CI 31-179; p-value = 1.2E-8) and gynecological tumors (OR = 91; 95% CI 42-193; 
p-value = 3.5E-12). The type of mutation on the XPC gene is associated with 
different classes of internal tumors. The majority of French XP-C patients (80%) 
are originated from North Africa and carried the XPC delTG founder mutation 
specific from the South Mediterranean area. The OR is extremely high for young 
(0-20 years) patients with more than 1300-fold increase for the French XPs 
carrying the founder mutation.
CONCLUSION: Because the age of XP population is increasing due to better 
sun-protection and knowledge of the disease, these results are of particular 
importance for the physicians to help in early prevention and detection of 
internal tumors in their XP patients. Few preventive blood analyses or simple 
medical imaging may help to better detect early cancer appearance in this 
population.

BACKGROUND: Total hip and total knee replacement surgery are in high demand, 
leading to long wait times for many patients. While on the waiting list, 
patients may experience worsening pain, reduced mobility, and deteriorating 
health. Given that long wait times are common for lower joint replacement 
surgery, it is important to understand how patient health changes during the 
wait period and whether this impacts patient outcomes after surgery. The aim of 
this scoping review will be to identify and describe the evidence regarding the 
impact of wait time on patient outcomes for patients who undergo total knee and 
total hip replacement surgery.
METHODS: This scoping review was designed with guidance from the Joanna Briggs 
Institute Manual for Evidence Synthesis, and results will be reported following 
the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension 
for scoping reviews. EMBASE, Medline, PubMed, Scopus, CINAHL, and Cochrane 
electronic databases will be searched for English language articles published 
after 1999. Studies of adult patients with osteoarthritis undergoing primary 
knee or hip replacement surgery, which measure patient outcomes over the wait 
period for surgery, will be included. Two independent reviewers will screen 
titles and abstracts followed by full article review. Data will be extracted by 
two reviewers using a standardized form. Outcomes assessed during the wait 
period will be identified and described in tables. Factors associated with 
changes in health status during the wait period will be qualitatively described.
DISCUSSION: This review will map the evidence regarding wait times for lower 
extremity joint replacement surgery. Better understanding of how the impact of 
wait times on patient health status is measured over the perioperative period 
will inform future research on wait times.

BACKGROUND: The life expectancy for individuals with sickle cell disease (SCD) 
has greatly increased over the last 50 years. Adults with SCD experience 
multiple complications such as cardiopulmonary disease, strokes, and avascular 
necrosis that lead to limitations that geriatric populations often experience. 
There are no dedicated instruments to measure functional decline and functional 
age to determine risk of future adverse outcomes in older adults with SCD. The 
objective of this study was to assess the feasibility of performing the Sickle 
Cell Disease Functional Assessment (SCD-FA).
METHODS: We enrolled 40 adults with SCD (20 younger adults aged 18-49 years as a 
comparison group and 20 older adults aged 50 years and older) in a single-center 
prospective cohort study. Participants were recruited from a comprehensive 
sickle cell clinic in an academic center in the southeastern United States. We 
included measures validated in an oncology geriatric assessment enriched with 
additional physical performance measures: usual gait speed, seated grip 
strength, Timed Up and Go, six-minute walk test, and 30-second chair stand. We 
also included an additional cognitive measure, which was the Montreal Cognitive 
Assessment, and additional patient-reported measures at the intersection of 
sickle cell disease and geriatrics. The primary outcome was the proportion 
completing the assessment. Secondary outcomes were the proportion consenting, 
duration of the assessment, acceptability, and adverse events.
RESULTS: Eighty percent (44/55) of individuals approached consented, 91% (40/44) 
completed the SCD-FA in its entirety, and the median duration was 89 min (IQR 
80-98). There were no identified adverse events. On the acceptability survey, 
95% (38/40) reported the length as appropriate, 2.5% (1/40) reported a question 
as upsetting, and 5% (2/40) reported portions as difficult. Exploratory analyses 
of physical function showed 63% (25/40) had a slow usual gait speed (< 1.2 m/s).
CONCLUSION: The SCD-FA is feasible, acceptable, and safe and physical 
performance tests identified functional impairments in adults with SCD. These 
findings will inform the next phase of the study where we will assess the 
validity of the SCD-FA to predict patient-important outcomes in a larger sample 
of adults with SCD.

Osteoporosis is becoming increasing important health problem in China. This 
study shows that the disease burden of low bone mineral density (BMD) in China 
is large and will remain increasing with the growth of aging population. In 
addition, male low BMD should not be ignored. Although burden of low BMD is 
partially representative of the real burden of osteoporosis, the information 
provided in our study could be used to better inform targeted public health 
prevention and management programs for osteopososis.
PURPOSE: We aim to investigate the pattern and trends of disease burden due to 
low BMD by gender, year, and age in China from 1990 to 2019.
METHODS: Data on summary exposure value (SEV) and disability-adjusted life years 
(DALYs) due to low BMD was obtained from the Global Burden of Disease Study 
2019, and analyzed by gender, age, and years. Average annual percent change 
(AAPC) and annual percent change (APC) were calculated to qualify the trends of 
burden due to low BMD.
RESULT: In 2019, the age-standardized SEV was higher in females than that in 
males (23.04, 95% UI = [17.25-29.83] and 12.50, 95% UI = [7.71-19.25], 
respectively), while the total number of DALYs was higher in males than females 
with 1,698,705.92 (95% UI = 1,281,580.79 to 2,076,364.25) and 1,621,569 (95% 
UI = 1,266,284.89 to 2,016,399.16), respectively. Though SEV exhibited 
decreasing trends during 1990 to 2019 in both sexes, the absolute number of 
DALYs due to low BMD increased steadily and almost doubled in 2019 compared to 
that in 1990.
CONCLUSION: The burden of low BMD remains large and continues to increase. 
Although females are prone to low BMD, the disease burden for males should not 
be ignored.

Gene drives and population persistence vs elimination: The impact of spatial 
structure and inbreeding at low density.

Synthetic gene drive constructs are being developed to control disease vectors, 
invasive species, and other pest species. In a well-mixed random mating 
population a sufficiently strong gene drive is expected to eliminate a target 
population, but it is not clear whether the same is true when spatial processes 
play a role. In species with an appropriate biology it is possible that 
drive-induced reductions in density might lead to increased inbreeding, reducing 
the efficacy of drive, eventually leading to suppression rather than 
elimination, regardless of how strong the drive is. To investigate this question 
we analyse a series of explicitly solvable stochastic models considering a range 
of scenarios for the relative timing of mating, reproduction, and dispersal and 
analyse the impact of two different types of gene drive, a Driving Y chromosome 
and a homing construct targeting an essential gene. We find in all cases a 
sufficiently strong Driving Y will go to fixation and the population will be 
eliminated, except in the one life history scenario (reproduction and mating in 
patches followed by dispersal) where low density leads to increased inbreeding, 
in which case the population persists indefinitely, tending to either a stable 
equilibrium or a limit cycle. These dynamics arise because Driving Y males have 
reduced mating success, particularly at low densities, due to having fewer 
sisters to mate with. Increased inbreeding at low densities can also prevent a 
homing construct from eliminating a population. For both types of drive, if 
there is strong inbreeding depression, then the population cannot be rescued by 
inbreeding and it is eliminated. These results highlight the potentially 
critical role that low-density-induced inbreeding and inbreeding depression 
(and, by extension, other sources of Allee effects) can have on the eventual 
impact of a gene drive on a target population.

BACKGROUND: Nursing personnel are critical for enabling access to health service 
in primary health care. However, the State of the World's Nursing 2020 report 
showed important inequalities in nurse availability between countries.
METHODS: The purpose of this study/analysis was to describe the differences in 
nurse-to-population density in 58 countries from six regional areas and the 
relationship between differences in access to nurses and other indicators of 
health equity.
RESULTS: All countries and income groups showed subnational inequalities in the 
distribution of nursing personnel with Gini coefficients ranging from 1 to 39. 
The latter indicated situation such as 13% of the population having access to 
45% of nurses in a country. The average max-to-min ratio was on average of 
11-fold. In our sample, the African region had the highest level of subnational 
inequalities with the average Gini coefficient of 19.6. The European Region had 
the lowest level of within-country inequalities with the average Gini 
coefficient being 5.6. A multivariate analysis showed a clustering of countries 
in three groups: (1) high Gini coefficients comprised mainly African countries; 
(2) moderate Gini coefficients comprised mainly South-East Asian, Central and 
South American countries; (3) low Gini coefficients comprised mainly Western 
countries, Japan, and Korea. The analysis also showed that inequality in 
distribution of nurses was correlated with other indices of health and 
inequality such as the Human Development Index, maternal mortality, and life 
expectancy.
CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that there is a high level of geographic 
inequality in the distribution of nurses at subnational level. Inequalities in 
nursing distribution are multifactorial, to improve access to nurses, policies 
should be bundled, tailored to the local context and tackle the various root 
causes for inequalities.

BACKGROUND: Heterotopic ossifications (HO) are a common complication after total 
hip arthroplasty (THA). Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have proven to 
reduce the occurrence of HO. It is still unclear when the formation of HO is 
finished. Aim of our study was to answer this question.
METHODS: In a prospective study, the occurrence of periarticular HO was checked 
during the follow-up (FU) examinations. In total, 75 consecutive patients who 
underwent THA were included. To ensure a high follow-up rate, only patients with 
a life expectancy of at least 10 years were included. A medical ossification 
prophylaxis with mostly etoricoxib (90 mg once daily) was administered. 
Follow-up examinations were performed at 3 months, 1 year, 3, 5, and 10 years 
postoperatively. Each time, a clinical and radiological examination was carried 
out. The HO was graded according to Brooker's method.
RESULTS: Low-grade HO classified by Brooker grade I and II occurred 
significantly more frequent than HO grade III. In patients with present HO, a 
possible increase in Brooker stage could further be observed within 3 years 
postoperatively. After 3 years, the formation of HO was completed in all 
patients.
CONCLUSION: Three years after THA, the formation of HO is complete. After more 
than 3 years postoperatively, if HO occurs or increases, other triggering causes 
such as new trauma, periarticular infection, or implant loosening should be 
considered.

BACKGROUND: Gefapixant is an oral P2X3 receptor antagonist that has previously 
shown efficacy and safety in refractory chronic cough and unexplained chronic 
cough. We therefore aim to confirm the efficacy and safety of gefapixant in 
participants with refractory chronic cough and unexplained chronic cough.
METHODS: COUGH-1 and COUGH-2 were both double-blind, randomised, parallel-group, 
placebo-controlled, phase 3 trials. COUGH-1 was done in 156 sites in 17 
countries and COUGH-2 in 175 sites in 20 countries. We enrolled participants who 
were 18 years or older with a diagnosis of refractory chronic cough or 
unexplained chronic cough of 1 year duration or more. Participants were also 
required to have a cough severity visual analogue scale score of 40 mm or more 
at screening and baseline. Eligible participants were randomly allocated 
(1:1:1), using a computer-generated allocation schedule, to one of three 
treatment groups: placebo, gefapixant 15 mg twice per day, or gefapixant 45 mg 
twice per day. All study treatments were given orally. Participants were treated 
over a 12-week main study period in COUGH-1 and a 24-week main study period in 
COUGH-2; followed by extension periods for a total of up to 52 weeks of 
treatment in both trials. The primary outcome was placebo-adjusted mean change 
in 24-h cough frequency at 12 weeks in COUGH-1 and 24 weeks in COUGH-2. Both 
studies were registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03449134 (COUGH-1) and 
NCT03449147 (COUGH-2).
FINDINGS: From March 14, 2018, (first participant screened) to July 26, 2019, 
(last participant screened) 732 patients were recruited in COUGH-1 and 1317 in 
COUGH-2. COUGH-1 randomly assigned and treated 730 participants (243 [33×3%] 
with placebo, 244 [33×4%] with gefapixant 15 mg twice per day, and 243 [33×3%] 
with gefapixant 45 mg twice per day); COUGH-2 randomly assigned and treated 1314 
participants (435 [33×1%] with placebo, 440 [33×5%] with gefapixant 15 mg twice 
per day, and 439 [33×4%] with gefapixant 45 mg twice per day). Participants were 
mostly female (542 [74×2%] of 730 in COUGH-1 and 984 [74×9%] of 1314 in 
COUGH-2). The mean age was 59×0 years (SD 12×6) in COUGH-1 and 58×1 years (12×1) 
in COUGH-2, and the mean cough duration was 11·6 years (SD 9·5) in COUGH-1 and 
11·2 years (9·8) in COUGH-2. Gefapixant 45 mg twice per day showed significant 
reductions in 24-h cough frequency compared with placebo at week 12 in COUGH-1 
(18·5% [95% CI 32·9-0·9]; p=0·041) and at week 24 in COUGH-2 (14·6% [26·1-1·4]; 
p=0·031). Gefapixant 15 mg twice per day did not show a significant reduction in 
cough frequency versus placebo in both studies. The most common adverse events 
were related to taste disturbance: ageusia (36 [4·9%] of 730 in COUGH-1 and 86 
[6·5%] of 1314 in COUGH-2), dysgeusia (118 [16·2%] in COUGH-1 and 277 [21·1%] in 
COUGH-2), hypergeusia (3 [0·4%] in COUGH-1 and 6 [0×5%] in COUGH-2), hypogeusia 
(19 [2·6%] in COUGH-1 and 80 [6·1%] in COUGH-2), and taste disorder (28 [3·8%] 
in COUGH-1 and 46 [3·5%] in COUGH-2).
INTERPRETATION: Gefapixant 45 mg twice per day is the first treatment to show 
efficacy with an acceptable safety profile in phase 3 clinical trials for 
refractory chronic cough or unexplained chronic cough.

Cognitive dysfunction is one of the most prevalent non-motor symptoms in 
patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). While it tends to worsen in the later 
stages of disease, it can occur at any time, with 15-20% of patients exhibiting 
cognitive deficits at diagnosis (Aarsland et al., 2010; Goldman and Sieg, 2020). 
The characteristic features of cognitive dysfunction include impairment in 
executive function, visuospatial abilities, and attention, which vary in 
severity from subtle impairment to overt dementia (Martinez-Horta and 
Kulisevsky, 2019). To complicate matters, cognitive dysfunction is prone to 
fluctuate in PD patients, impacting diagnosis and the ability to assess 
progression and decision-making capacity. The diagnosis of cognitive impairment 
or dementia has a huge impact on patient independence, quality of life, life 
expectancy and caregiver burden (Corallo et al., 2017; Lawson et al., 2016; 
Leroi et al., 2012). It is therefore essential that physicians caring for 
patients with PD provide education, screening and treatment for this aspect of 
the disease. In this chapter, we provide a practical guide for the assessment 
and management of various degrees of cognitive dysfunction in patients with PD 
by approaching the disease at different stages. We address risk factors for 
cognitive dysfunction, prevention strategies prior to making the diagnosis, 
available tools for screening. Lastly, we review aspects of care, management and 
considerations, including decision-making capacity, that occur after the patient 
has been diagnosed with cognitive dysfunction or dementia.

BACKGROUND: In Ethiopia, cervical cancer is the second most common cancer among 
women of the reproductive age group. Since 2018, the quadrivalent human 
papillomavirus (4vHPV) vaccine ﻿targeting four HPV types (6/11/16/18) has been 
introduced in the national immunization program in Ethiopia. Currently, however, 
a nonavalent HPV (9vHPV) vaccine which provides broader protection against nine 
HPV types (﻿6/11/16/18/31/33/45/52/58) is available for global use. Our study, 
therefore, aims to estimate the cost-effectiveness of 9vHPV vaccine ﻿compared to 
the current HPV vaccination program in Ethiopia.
METHOD: A static Markov cohort model was used to simulate the progression of HPV 
infection to cervical cancer for a cohort of 12-years-old girls (N = 100,000) in 
Ethiopia. The model ran up to the age of 100 years, with a cycle length of 
1 year. One-way and ﻿probabilistic sensitivity analyses were used to explore the 
robustness of the model and uncertainties around the parameters included in the 
model. Cost-effectiveness thresholds of one and three times gross domestic 
product (GDP) per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained were considered.
RESULTS: At a price of US$ 6.9, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) 
per QALY gained for the 9vHPV vaccine was US$ 454 compared to the 4vHPV vaccine, 
which is less than one times GDP per capita of Ethiopia. The ICER was most 
sensitive to the change in the discount rate of QALYs. Compared to 4vHPV 
vaccine, for 9vHPV vaccine to remain very cost-effective and cost-effective, its 
price per dose should not exceed US$ 8.4 and US$ 15, respectively, at a 
threshold of one and three times GDP per capita.
CONCLUSION: Compared to the 4vHPV vaccine, the 9vHPV vaccine is a cost-effective

OBJECTIVES: Amidst conflicting expectations about the benefits of personalized 
medicine (PM) and the potentially high implementation costs, we reviewed the 
available evidence on the cost-effectiveness of PM relative to non-PM.
METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature review of economic evaluations of 
PM and extracted data, including incremental quality-adjusted life-years 
(ΔQALYs) and incremental costs (Δcosts). ΔQALYs and Δcosts were combined with 
estimates of national cost-effectiveness thresholds to calculate incremental net 
monetary benefit (ΔNMB). Regression analyses were performed with these variables 
as dependent variables and PM intervention characteristics as independent 
variables. Random intercepts were used to cluster studies according to country.
RESULTS: Of 4774 studies reviewed, 128 were selected, providing 
cost-effectiveness data for 279 PM interventions. Most studies were set in the 
United States (48%) and the United Kingdom (16%) and adopted a healthcare 
perspective (82%). Cancer treatments (60%) and pharmaceutical interventions 
(72%) occurred frequently. Prognostic tests (19%) and tests to identify 
(non)responders (37%) were least and most common, respectively. Industry 
sponsorship occurred in 32%. Median ΔQALYs, Δcosts, and ΔNMB per individual were 
0.03, Int$575, and Int$18, respectively. We found large heterogeneity in 
cost-effectiveness. Regression analysis showed that gene therapies were
