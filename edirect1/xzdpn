option; however, the results are inconsistent. Importantly, anti-epileptic drugs 
such as valproate-which cause mitochondrial dysfunction-should be avoided in 
patients with SURF1-associated LS presenting with seizures.

Cell adhesion and polarized cellular behaviors play critical roles in a wide 
variety of morphogenetic events. In the zebrafish embryo, epiboly represents an 
important process of epithelial morphogenesis that involves differential cell 
adhesion and dynamic cell shape changes for coordinated movements of different 
cell populations, but the underlying mechanism remains poorly understood. The 
adaptor protein Lurap1 functions to link myotonic dystrophy kinase-related 
Rac/Cdc42-binding kinase with MYO18A for actomyosin retrograde flow in cell 
migration. We previously reported that it interacts with Dishevelled in 
convergence and extension movements during gastrulation. Here, we show that it 
regulates blastoderm cell adhesion and radial cell intercalation during epiboly. 
In zebrafish mutant embryos with loss of both maternal and zygotic Lurap1 
function, deep cell multilayer of the blastoderm exhibit delayed epiboly with 
respect to the superficial layer. Time-lapse imaging reveals that these deep 
cells undergo unstable intercalation, which impedes their expansion over the 
yolk cell. Cell sorting and adhesion assays indicate reduced cellular cohesion 
of the blastoderm. These defects are correlated with disrupted cytoskeletal 
organization in the cortex of blastoderm cells. Thus, the present results extend 
our previous works by demonstrating that Lurap1 is required for cell adhesion 
and cell behavior changes to coordinate cell movements during epithelial 
morphogenesis. They provide insights for a further understanding of the 
regulation of cytoskeletal organization during gastrulation cell movements.

Although many Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPGs) have been published for the 
care of patients with Cystic Fibrosis (CF), including a variety of nutrition 
recommendations, the quality of these CPGs has never been evaluated. The aim of 
this study was to compare, review, and critically appraise CPGs for the 
nutritional management of CF, throughout the lifespan. We searched PubMed, 
Guidelines International Network (GIN), ECRI Institute, and Guidelines Central 
for CPGs, with information on the nutritional management of CF. Retrieved CPGs 
were appraised by three independent reviewers, using the Appraisal of 
Guidelines, Research and Evaluation II (AGREE II) instrument and checklist. A 
total of 22 CPGs (seven solely nutrition oriented), by 14 different publishers, 
were retrieved. The Thoracic Society of Australia and New Zealand CPGs scored 
the highest overall quality (94.4%), while the Paediatric Gastroenterology 
Society/Dietitians Association of Australia CPGs had the lowest score (27.8%). 
Great variation in AGREE II domain-specific scores was observed in all CPGs, 
suggesting the existence of different strengths and weaknesses. Despite the 
availability of several CPGs, many appear outdated, lacking rigor, transparency, 
applicability, and efficiency, while incorporating bias. Considering that CPGs 
adherence is associated with better outcomes and the need for improving life 
expectancy in patients with CF, the development of CPGs of better quality is 
deemed necessary.

The main goal of this study is to consider SLC34A2 as a potential prognostic 
marker of oncological diseases using the mutational, expression, and survival 
data of cancer studies which are publicly available online. We collected data 
from four databases (cBioPortal, The Cancer Genome Atlas; cBioPortal, Genie; 
International Cancer Genome Consortium; ArrayExpress). In total, 111,283 samples 
were categorized according to 27 tumor locations. Ninety-nine functionally 
significant missense mutations and twelve functionally significant indel 
mutations in SLC34A2 were found. The most frequent mutations were SLC34A2-ROS1, 
p.T154A, p.P506S/R/L, p.G257A/E/R, p.S318W, p.A396T, p.P410L/S/H, p.S461C, 
p.A473T/V, and p.Y503H/C/F. The upregulation of SLC34A2 was found in samples of 
myeloid, bowel, ovarian, and uterine tumors; downregulation was found in tumor 
samples of breast, liver, lung, and skin cancer tumors. It was found that the 
life expectancy of breast and thymus cancer patients with an SLC34A2 mutation is 
lower, and it was revealed that SLC34A2 overexpression reduced the life span of 
patients with brain, ovarian, and pancreatic tumors. Thereby, for these types of 
oncological diseases, the mutational profile of SLC34A2 can be a potential 
prognostic marker for breast and thymus cancers, and the upregulation of SLC34A2 
can be a potential prognostic marker for brain, ovarian, and pancreatic cancers.

INTRODUCTION: Early intervention of bystanders (the first links of the chain of 
survival) have been shown to improve survival and good neurological outcomes of 
patients suffering out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). Many initiatives have 
been implemented to increase the engagement of communities in early basic life 
support (BLS) and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), especially of lay people 
with no duty to respond. A better knowledge of the most effective initiatives 
might help improve survival and health system organization. Aim of the scoping 
review: To assess the impact of specific interventions involving lay communities 
on bystander BLS rates and other consistent clinical outcomes, and to identify 
relevant knowledge gaps.
METHODS: This scoping review was part of the continuous evidence evaluation 
process of the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation (ILCOR), and was 
performed following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and 
Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews. We performed a literature search 
using the PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases until 1 February 2021. The 
screening process was conducted based on predefined inclusion/exclusion 
criteria, and for each included study, we performed data extraction focusing on 
the type of intervention implemented, and the impact of these interventions on 
the specific OHCAs outcomes.
RESULTS: Our search strategy identified 19 eligible studies, originating mainly 
from the USA (47.4%) and Denmark (21%). The type of intervention included in 
57.9% of cases was a community CPR training program, in 36.8% bundled 
interventions, and in 5.3% mass-media campaigns. The most commonly reported 
outcome for OHCAs was bystander CPR rate (94.7%), followed by survival to 
hospital discharge (36.8%), proportion of people trained (31.6%), survival to 
hospital discharge with good neurological outcome (21%), and Return of 
Spontaneous Circulation (10.5%). Community training programs and bundled 
interventions improved bystander CPR in most of the included studies.
CONCLUSION: Based on the results of our scoping review, we identified the 
potential benefit of community initiatives, such as community training in BLS, 
even as part of bundled intervention, in order to improve bystander CPR rates 
and patient outcomes.

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a monogenic autosomal recessive disease caused by cystic 
fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene mutations. CF is 
characterized by a high phenotypic variability present even in patients with the 
same genotype. This is due to the intervention of modifier genes that interact 
with both the CFTR gene and environmental factors. The purpose of this review is 
to highlight the role of non-CFTR genetic factors (modifier genes) that 
contribute to phenotypic variability in CF. We analyzed literature data starting 
with candidate gene studies and continuing with extensive studies, such as 
genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and whole exome sequencing (WES). The 
results of both types of studies revealed that the number of modifier genes in 
CF patients is impressive. Their identification offers a new perspective on the 
pathophysiological mechanisms of the disease, paving the way for the 
understanding of other genetic disorders. In conclusion, in the future, genetic 
analysis, such as GWAS and WES, should be performed routinely. A challenge for 
future research is to integrate their results in the process of developing new 
classes of drugs, with a goal to improve the prognosis, increase life 
expectancy, and enhance quality of life among CF patients.

We investigated effects of exercise habits (EHs) in adolescence and old age on 
osteoporosis prevalence and hip joint and lumbar spine bone mineral density 
(BMD). Body composition and BMD in 1596 people aged 65-84 years living in 
Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, were measured using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. We 
divided participants into four groups by a combination of EHs in adolescence and 
old age: none in either period (None-None), only in adolescence (Active-None), 
only in old age (None-Active), and in both periods (Active-Active). Logistic 
regression models were employed to estimate multivariable-adjusted odds ratios 
(ORs) for osteoporosis determined by T-score (less than -2.5 SD) using the 
None-None reference group. In men, the combination of EHs in adolescence and old 
age was not associated with osteoporosis prevalence. However, the lumbar spine's 
BMD was significantly higher in the Active-Active than the None-Active group (p 
= 0.043). In women, the Active-Active group had lower lumbar spine osteoporosis 
prevalence than the None-None group (OR 0.65; 95% CI, 0.42-1.00, p = 0.049). 
Furthermore, hip BMD was significantly higher in the Active-Active group than in 
the other three groups (p = 0.001). Older women with EHs in adolescence and old 
age had higher lumbar BMD and lower risk of osteoporosis.

The development of yellow color is an important aspect of fruit quality in 
yellow fleshed kiwifruit during fruit ripening, and it has a large influence on 
consumer preference. The yellow color is determined by carotenoid accumulation 
and chlorophyll degradation and is likely affected by ethylene production. This 
study investigates the expression of carotenoid, chlorophyll degradation, and 
ethylene response factors in 'Qihong' fruit, which had reached the near ripening 
stage (firmness ≈ 20 N) and were either left untreated (controls) or treated 
with 0.5 μL L-1 of 1-MCP for 12 h. Both the accumulation of β-carotene (not 
lutein) and degradation of chlorophyll a and b increased in response to the 
1-MCP treatment, resulting in more yellow colored flesh in the 1-MCP treated 
fruit with higher carotenoid and lower chlorophyll contents. 1-MCP up-regulated 
AcLCY-β, AcSGR1, and AcPAO2, but reduced the expression of AcCCD1. These four 
genes were correlated with the concentrations of β-carotene and the 
chlorophylls. The expression of three ethylene response factors, including 
Acc29730, Acc25620, and Acc23763 were delayed and down-regulated in 1-MCP 
treated fruit, showing the highest correlation with the expression of AcLCY-β, 
AcSGR1, AcPAO2, and AcCCD1. Dual-Luciferase assays showed that 1-MCP treatment 
not only eliminated the inhibition of Acc23763 on the promoters of both AcPAO2 
and AcLCY-β, but also reduced the activation of Acc29730 and Acc25620 on the 
AcCCD1 promoter. Our findings indicate that Acc29730, Acc25620, and Acc23763 may 
play an important role in the response to 1-MCP treatment during the fruit 
eating ripe stage, which likely altered the promoter activities of carotenoid 
and chlorophyll-related genes (AcPAO2, AcLCY-β and AcCCD1) to regulate their 
transcripts, resulting in more yellow color in the fruit flesh of 'Qihong'.

Fresh baby spinach leaves are popular in salads and are sold as chilled and 
plastic-packed products. They are of high nutritional value but very perishable 
due to microbial contamination and enzymatic browning resulting from leaf 
senescence. Therefore, innovative food processing methods such as 
plasma-activated water (PAW) treatment are being explored regarding their 
applicability for ensuring food safety. PAW's impact on food quality and 
shelf-life extension has, however, not been investigated extensively in 
vegetables so far. In the present study, a comprehensive metabolomic analysis 
was performed to determine possible changes in the metabolite contents of 
spinach leaves stored in a refrigerated state for eight days. Liquid 
chromatography high-resolution mass spectrometry, followed by stringent 
biostatistics, was used to compare the metabolomes in control, tap-water-rinsed 
or PAW-rinsed samples. No significant differences were discernible between the 
treatment groups at the beginning or end of the storage period. The observed 
loss of nutrients and activation of catabolic pathways were characteristic of a 
transition into the senescent state. Nonetheless, the presence of several 
polyphenolic antioxidants and γ-linolenic acid in the PAW-treated leaves 
indicated a significant increase in stress resistance and health-promoting 
antioxidant capacity in the sample. Furthermore, the enhancement of 
carbohydrate-related metabolisms indicated a delay in the senescence 
development. These findings demonstrated the potential of PAW to benefit food 
quality and the shelf-life of fresh spinach leaves.

Heart diseases are some of the most common and pressing threats to human health 
worldwide. The American Heart Association and the National Institute of Health 
jointly work to annually update data on cardiac diseases. In 2018, 126.9 million 
Americans were reported as having some form of cardiac disorder, with an 
estimated direct and indirect total cost of USD 363.4 billion. This necessitates 
developing therapeutic interventions for heart diseases to improve human life 
expectancy and economic relief. In this review, we look into gamma-secretase as 
a potential therapeutic target for cardiac diseases. Gamma-secretase, an 
aspartyl protease enzyme, is responsible for the cleavage and activation of a 
number of substrates that are relevant to normal cardiac development and 
function as found in mutation studies. Some of these substrates are involved in 
downstream signaling processes and crosstalk with pathways relevant to heart 
diseases. Most of the substrates and signaling events we explored were found to 
be potentially beneficial to maintain cardiac function in diseased conditions. 
This review presents an updated overview of the current knowledge on 
gamma-secretase processing of cardiac-relevant substrates and seeks to 
understand if the modulation of gamma-secretase activity would be beneficial to 
combat cardiac diseases.

In this article, we introduce a new three-parameter distribution called the 
extended inverse-Gompertz (EIGo) distribution. The implementation of three 
parameters provides a good reconstruction for some applications. The EIGo 
distribution can be seen as an extension of the inverted exponential, inverse 
Gompertz, and generalized inverted exponential distributions. Its failure rate 
function has an upside-down bathtub shape. Various statistical and reliability 
properties of the EIGo distribution are discussed. The model parameters are 
estimated by the maximum-likelihood and Bayesian methods under Type-II censored 
samples, where the parameters are explained using gamma priors. The performance 
of the proposed approaches is examined using simulation results. Finally, two 
real-life engineering data sets are analyzed to illustrate the applicability of 
the EIGo distribution, showing that it provides better fits than competing 
inverted models such as inverse-Gompertz, inverse-Weibull, inverse-gamma, 
generalized inverse-Weibull, exponentiated inverted-Weibull, generalized 
inverted half-logistic, inverted-Kumaraswamy, inverted Nadarajah-Haghighi, and 
alpha-power inverse-Weibull distributions.

The chronic infection established by the human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) 
produces serious CD4+ T cell immunodeficiency despite the decrease in HIV-1 
ribonucleic acid (RNA) levels and the raised life expectancy of people living 
with HIV-1 (PLWH) through treatment with combined antiretroviral therapies 
(cART). HIV-1 enters the central nervous system (CNS), where perivascular 
macrophages and microglia are infected. Serious neurodegenerative symptoms 
related to HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) are produced by 
infection of the CNS. Despite advances in the treatment of this infection, HAND 
significantly contribute to morbidity and mortality globally. The pathogenesis 
and the role of inflammation in HAND are still incompletely understood. 
Principally, growing evidence shows that the CNS is an anatomical reservoir for 
viral infection and replication, and that its compartmentalization can trigger 
the evolution of neurological damage and thus make virus eradication more 
difficult. In this review, important concepts for understanding HAND and 
neuropathogenesis as well as the viral proteins involved in the CNS as an 
anatomical reservoir for HIV infection are discussed. In addition, an overview 
of the recent advancements towards therapeutic strategies for the treatment of 
HAND is presented. Further neurological research is needed to address 
neurodegenerative difficulties in people living with HIV, specifically regarding 
CNS viral reservoirs and their effects on eradication.

Background and Objectives: Urine insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 7 
(IGFBP-7), tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase 2 (TIMP-2), and 
neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) monomer are novel tubular 
kidney injury biomarkers. In multiple myeloma (MM), immunoglobulin free light 
chains (FLCs) play an integral role in renal impairment. This study aimed to 
investigate the correlation between new biomarkers and acclaimed parameters of 
renal failure, MM stage, and prognosis. Materials and Methods: The examined 
parameters included: urinary and serum cystatin-C, IGFBP-7, and TIMP-2, and 
urinary NGAL monomer in 124 enrolled patients. Results: Urinary and serum 
IGFBP-7 and urinary NGAL were higher among patients with an estimated glomerular 
filtration rate (eGFR) < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2, and positively correlated with urine 
light chains. Serum and urine IGFBP-7 and urine NGAL were greater among patients 
with a higher disease stage. In the whole study group, urinary concentrations of 
the studied markers were positively correlated with each other. In multiple 
linear regression, urinary IGFBP-7 and NGAL were associated with lower eGFR, 
independently of other urinary markers. Conclusions: Urinary IGFBP-7 and NGAL 
monomer may be useful markers of tubular renal damage in patients with MM. 
Biomarker-based diagnostics may contribute to earlier treatment that may improve 
renal outcomes and life expectancy in MM.

Background and Objectives: Smart wearable devices are effective in diabetic foot 
ulcer (DFU) prevention. However, factors determining their acceptance are poorly 
understood. This systematic review aims to examine the literature on patient and 
provider perspectives of smart wearable devices in DFU prevention. Materials and 
Methods: PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science were systematically searched up to 
October 2021. The selected articles were assessed for methodological quality 
using the quality assessment tool for studies with diverse designs. Results: A 
total of five articles were identified and described. The methodological quality 
of the studies ranged from low to moderate. Two studies employed a quantitative 
study design and focused on the patient perspective, whereas three studies 
included a mixed, quantitative/qualitative design and explored patient or 
provider (podiatrist) perspectives. Four studies focused on an insole system and 
one included a smart sock device. The quantitative studies demonstrated that 
devices were comfortable, well designed and useful in preventing DFU. One mixed 
design study reported that patients did not intend to adopt an insole device in 
its current design because of malfunctions, a lack of comfort. and alert 
intrusiveness, despite the general perception that the device was a useful tool 
for foot risk monitoring. Two mixed design studies found that performance 
expectancy was a predictor of a podiatrist's behavioural intention to recommend 
an insole device in clinical practice. Disappointing participant experiences 
negatively impacted the podiatrists' intention to adopt a smart device. The need 
for additional refinements of the device was indicated by patients and providers 
before its use in this population. Conclusions: The current evidence about 
patient and provider perspectives on smart wearable technology is limited by 
scarce methodological quality and conflicting results. It is, thus, not possible 
to draw definitive conclusions regarding acceptability of these devices for the 
prevention of DFU in people with diabetes.

Research comparing health care systems of countries, with a particular emphasis 
on health care spending and health care outcomes, has found unexplained 
differences which are often attributed to the countries' cultures, yet these 
cultural dimensions are never completely identified or measured. This study 
examines if culture predicts a country's population health, measured as life 
expectancy and health care spending. Using the Hofstede country-level measures 
(six dimensions) of culture as independent variables, two regression models to 
predict life expectancy and per capita health care using 2016 World Bank data 
were developed. The original data set included 112 countries which was reduced 
to a final total of 60 due to missing or incomplete data. The first regression 
model, predicting life expectancy, indicated an adjusted R square of 0.45. The 
second regression model, predicting per capita health care spending, indicated 
an adjusted R square of 0.63. The study suggests culture is a predictor of both 
life expectancy and health care spending. However, by creating a composite 
measure for all six culture measures, we have not found a significant 
association between culture and life expectancy and healthcare expenditure. The 
study is limited by small sample size, differences in geography, climate and 
political systems. Future research should examine more closely the relative 
influence of individualism on life expectancy and assumptions about models of 
socialized medicine.

Out-of-pocket (OOP) payments are perceived as the most regressive means of 
health financing. Using the panel-data approach and region-aggregated data from 
Statistics Poland, this research investigated associations between 
socio-economic factors and OOP health spending in 16 Polish regions for the 
period 1999-2019. The dependent variable was real (inflation-adjusted) monthly 
OOP health expenditure per person in Polish households. Potential independent 
variables included economic, labour, demographic, educational, health, 
environmental, and lifestyle measures based on previous research. A set of 
panel-data estimators was used in regression models. The factors that were 
positively associated with OOP health spending were disposable income, the 
proportions of children (aged 0-9) and elderly (70+ years) in the population, 
healthcare supply (proxied by physicians' density), air pollution, and tobacco 
and alcohol expenditure. On the other hand, the increased unemployment rate, 
life expectancy at age 65, mortality rate, and higher sports participation were 
all related to lower OOP health spending. The results may guide national 
strategies to improve health-care allocations and offer additional financial 
protection for vulnerable groups, such as households with children and elderly 
members.

Set-Theoretic Formalism for Treating Ligand-Target Datasets.

Data on ligand-target (LT) interactions has played a growing role in drug 
research for several decades. Even though the amount of data has grown 
significantly in size and coverage during this period, most datasets remain 
difficult to analyze because of their extreme sparsity, as there is no activity 
data whatsoever for many LT pairs. Even within clusters of data there tends to 
be a lack of data completeness, making the analysis of LT datasets problematic. 
The current effort extends earlier works on the development of set-theoretic 
formalisms for treating thresholded LT datasets. Unlike many approaches that do 
not address pairs of unknown interaction, the current work specifically takes 
account of their presence in addition to that of active and inactive pairs. 
Because a given LT pair can be in any one of three states, the binary logic of 
classical set-theoretic methods does not strictly apply. The current work 
develops a formalism, based on ternary set-theoretic relations, for treating 
thresholded LT datasets. It also describes an extension of the concept of data 
completeness, which is typically applied to sets of ligands and targets, to the 
local data completeness of individual ligands and targets. The set-theoretic 
formalism is applied to the analysis of simple and joint polypharmacologies 
based on LT activity profiles, and it is shown that null pairs provide a means 
for determining bounds to these values. The methodology is applied to a dataset 
of protein kinase inhibitors as an illustration of the method. Although not 
dealt with here, work is currently underway on a more refined treatment of 
activity values that is based on increasing the number of activity classes.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a disabling neurodegenerative disorder that leads to 
long-term functional and cognitive impairment and greatly reduces life 
expectancy. Early genetic studies focused on tracking variations in genome-wide 
DNA sequences discovered several polymorphisms and novel susceptibility genes 
associated with AD. However, despite the numerous risk factors already 
identified, there is still no fully satisfactory explanation for the mechanisms 
underlying the onset of the disease. Also, as with other complex human diseases, 
the causes of low heritability are unclear. Epigenetic mechanisms, in which 
changes in gene expression do not depend on changes in genotype, have attracted 
considerable attention in recent years and are key to understanding the 
processes that influence age-related changes and various neurological diseases. 
With the recent use of massive sequencing techniques, methods for studying 
epigenome variations in AD have also evolved tremendously, allowing the 
discovery of differentially expressed disease traits under different conditions 
and experimental settings. This is important for understanding disease 
development and for unlocking new potential AD therapies. In this work, we 
outline the genomic and epigenomic components involved in the initiation and 
development of AD and identify potentially effective therapeutic targets for 
disease control.

Olives are one of the most important fruit and woody oil trees cultivated in 
many parts of the world. Olive oil is a critical component of the Mediterranean 
diet due to its importance in heart health. Olives are believed to have been 
brought to the United States from the Mediterranean countries in the 18th 
century. Despite the increase in demand and production areas, only a few 
selected olive varieties are grown in most traditional or new growing regions in 
the US. By understanding the genetic background, new sources of genetic 
diversity can be incorporated into the olive breeding programs to develop 
regionally adapted varieties for the US market. This study aimed to explore the 
genetic diversity and population structure of 90 olive accessions from the USDA 
repository along with six popular varieties using genotyping-by-sequencing 
(GBS)-generated SNP markers. After quality filtering, 54,075 SNP markers were 
retained for the genetic diversity analysis. The average gene diversity (GD) and 
polymorphic information content (PIC) values of the SNPs were 0.244 and 0.206, 
respectively, indicating a moderate genetic diversity for the US olive germplasm 
evaluated in this study. The structure analysis showed that the USDA collection 
was distributed across seven subpopulations; 63% of the accessions were grouped 
into an identifiable subpopulation. The phylogenetic and principal coordinate 
analysis (PCoA) showed that the subpopulations did not align with the 
geographical origins or climatic zones. An analysis of the molecular variance 
revealed that the major genetic variation sources were within populations. These 
findings provide critical information for future olive breeding programs to 
select genetically distant parents and facilitate future gene identification 
using genome-wide association studies (GWAS) or a marker-assisted selection 
(MAS) to develop varieties suited to production in the US.

There are more than 350 species of amphipods (Crustacea) in Lake Baikal, which 
have emerged predominantly through the course of endemic radiation. This group 
represents a remarkable model for studying various aspects of evolution, one of 
which is the evolution of mitochondrial (mt) genome architectures. We sequenced 
and assembled the mt genome of a pelagic Baikalian amphipod species 
Macrohectopus branickii. The mt genome is revealed to have an extraordinary 
length (42,256 bp), deviating significantly from the genomes of other amphipod 
species and the majority of animals. The mt genome of M. branickii has a unique 
gene order within amphipods, duplications of the four tRNA genes and Cox2, and a 
long non-coding region, that makes up about two thirds of the genome's size. The 
extension of the mt genome was most likely caused by multiple duplications and 
inversions of regions harboring ribosomal RNA genes. In this study, we analyzed 
the patterns of mt genome length changes in amphipods and other animal phyla. 
Through a statistical analysis, we demonstrated that the variability in the mt 
genome length may be a characteristic of certain phyla and is primarily 
conferred by expansions of non-coding regions.

In vitro measurements are widely used to implement gait kinematic and kinetic 
parameters to predict THA wear rate. Clinical tests of materials and designs are 
crucial to prove the accuracy and validate such measurements. This research 
aimed to examine the effect of CoC and CoXLPE kinematics and kinetics on wear 
during gait, the essential functional activity of humans, by comparing in vivo 
data to in vitro results. Our study hypothesis was that both implants would 
present the same hip joint kinematics and kinetics during gait. In total, 127 
unilateral primary cementless total hip arthroplasties were included in the 
research. There were no statistically significant differences observed at mean 
peak abduction, flexion, and extension moments and THA kinematics between the 
two groups. THA gait kinematics and kinetics are crucial biomechanical inputs 
associated with implant wear. In vitro studies report less wear in CoC than 
CoXLPE when tested in a matched gait kinematic protocol. Our findings confirm 
that both implants behave identically in terms of kinematics in a clinical 
environment, thus strengthening CoC advantage in in vitro results. Correlated to 
all other significant factors that affect THA wear, it could address in a 
complete prism the wear on CoC and CoXLPE.

Two Opposing Functions of Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (ACE) That Links 
Hypertension, Dementia, and Aging.

A 2018 report from the American Heart Association shows that over 103 million 
American adults have hypertension. The angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) (EC 
3.4.15.1) is a dipeptidyl carboxylase that, when inhibited, can reduce blood 
pressure through the renin-angiotensin system. ACE inhibitors are used as a 
first-line medication to be prescribed to treat hypertension, chronic kidney 
disease, and heart failure, among others. It has been suggested that ACE 
inhibitors can alleviate the symptoms in mouse models. Despite the benefits of 
ACE inhibitors, previous studies also have suggested that genetic variants of 
the ACE gene are risk factors for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other 
neurological diseases, while other variants are associated with reduced risk of 
AD. In mice, ACE overexpression in the brain reduces symptoms of the AD model 
systems. Thus, we find two opposing effects of ACE on health. To clarify the 
effects, we dissect the functions of ACE as follows: (1) angiotensin-converting 
enzyme that hydrolyzes angiotensin I to make angiotensin II in the 
renin-angiotensin system; (2) amyloid-degrading enzyme that hydrolyzes 
beta-amyloid, reducing amyloid toxicity. The efficacy of the ACE inhibitors is 
well established in humans, while the knowledge specific to AD remains to be 
open for further research. We provide an overview of ACE and inhibitors that 
link a wide variety of age-related comorbidities from hypertension to AD to 
aging. ACE also serves as an example of the middle-life crisis theory that 
assumes deleterious events during midlife, leading to age-related later events.
