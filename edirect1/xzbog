Infections can have detrimental effects on the fitness of an animal. Reproducing 
females may therefore be sensitive to cues of infection and be able to 
adaptively change their oviposition strategy in the face of infection. As one 
possibility, females could make a terminal investment and shift reproductive 
effort from future to current reproduction as life expectancy decreases. We 
hypothesized that females of the noctuid moth Heliothis virescens make a 
terminal investment and adapt their oviposition timing as well as their 
oviposition site selectivity in response to an immune challenge. We indeed found 
that females that were challenged with the bacterial entomopathogen Serratia 
entomophila laid more eggs than control females one night after the challenge. 
Additionally, bacteria-challenged females were less discriminating between 
oviposition sites than control females. Whereas control females preferred 
undamaged over damaged plants, immune-challenged females did not differentiate 
between the two. These results indicate that terminal investment is part of the 
life history of H. virescens females. Moreover, our results suggest that the 
strategy of terminal investment in H. virescens oviposition represents a fitness 
trade-off for females: in the face of infection, an increase in oviposition rate 
enhances female fitness, whereas low oviposition site selectivity reduces female 
fitness.

BACKGROUND: Arthroscopic partial meniscectomy (APM) is extensively used to 
relieve pain in patients with symptomatic meniscal tear (MT) and knee 
osteoarthritis (OA). Recent studies have failed to show the superiority of APM 
compared to other treatments. We aim to examine whether existing evidence is 
sufficient to reject use of APM as a cost-effective treatment for MT+OA.
METHODS: We built a patient-level microsimulation using Monte Carlo methods and 
evaluated three strategies: Physical therapy ('PT') alone; PT followed by APM if 
subjects continued to experience pain ('Delayed APM'); and 'Immediate APM'. Our 
subject population was US adults with symptomatic MT and knee OA over a 10 year 
time horizon. We assessed treatment outcomes using societal costs, 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and calculated incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), incorporating productivity costs as a 
sensitivity analysis. We also conducted a value-of-information analysis using 
probabilistic sensitivity analyses.
RESULTS: Calculated ICERs were estimated to be $12,900/QALY for Delayed APM as 
compared to PT and $103,200/QALY for Immediate APM as compared to Delayed APM. 
In sensitivity analyses, inclusion of time costs made Delayed APM cost-saving as 
compared to PT. Improving efficacy of Delayed APM led to higher incremental 
costs and lower incremental effectiveness of Immediate APM in comparison to 
Delayed APM. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses indicated that PT had 3.0% 
probability of being cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of 
$50,000/QALY. Delayed APM was cost effective 57.7% of the time at WTP = 
$50,000/QALY and 50.2% at WTP = $100,000/QALY. The probability of Immediate APM 
being cost-effective did not exceed 50% unless WTP exceeded $103,000/QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that current cost-effectiveness evidence does not 
support unqualified rejection of either Immediate or Delayed APM for the 
treatment of MT+OA. The amount to which society would be willing to pay for 
additional information on treatment outcomes greatly exceeds the cost of 
conducting another randomized controlled trial on APM.

Preliminary studies on HCV-cirrhotics listed for transplant suggest that 
sofosbuvir in combination with ribavirin is very effective in promoting viral 
clearance and preventing disease recurrence. Unfortunately, the high cost of 
such treatment (€46 500 per 12 weeks of treatment) makes its cost-effectiveness 
questionable. A semi-Markov model was developed to assess the cost-effectiveness 
of sofosbuvir/ribavirin treatment in cirrhotic patients without HCC (HCV-CIRRH) 
and with HCC (HCV-HCC) listed for transplant. In the base-case analysis, the 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for 24 weeks of sofosbuvir/ribavirin was 
€44 875 per quality-adjusted life-year gained in HCV-CIRRH and €60 380 in 
HCV-HCC patients. Both results were above the willingness to pay threshold of 
€37 000 per quality-adjusted life-year. Our data also show that in order to 
remain cost-effective (with a 24-week treatment), any novel interferon-free 
treatment endowed with ideal efficacy should cost less than €67 224 or €95 712 
in HCV-cirrhotics with and without HCC, respectively. The results shows that 
sofosbuvir/ribavirin therapy, given to patients listed for transplant, is not 
cost-effective at current prices despite being very effective, and new, more 
effective treatments will have little economic margins to remain cost-effective. 
New interferon-free combinations have the potential to revolutionize the 
treatment and prognosis of HCV-positive patients listed for transplant; however, 
without sustainable prices, this revolution is unlikely to happen.

OBJECTIVE: This study evaluates the cost-effectiveness of memantine extended 
release (ER) as an add-on therapy to acetylcholinesterase inhibitor (AChEI) 
[combination therapy] for treatment of patients with moderate-to-severe 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) from both a healthcare payer and a societal perspective 
over 3 years when compared to AChEI monotherapy in the US.
METHODS: A phase III trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of memantine ER for 
treatment of AD patients taking an AChEI. The analysis assessed the long-term 
costs and health outcomes using an individual patient simulation in which AD 
progression is modeled in terms of cognition, behavior, and functioning changes. 
Input parameters are based on patient-level trial data, published literature, 
and publicly available data sources. Changes in anti-psychotic medication use 
are incorporated based on a published retrospective cohort study. Costs include 
drug acquisition and monitoring, total AD-related medical care, and informal 
care associated with caregiver time. Incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR), life 
years, care time for caregiver, time in community and institution, time on 
anti-psychotics, time by disease severity, and time without severe symptoms are 
reported. Costs and health outcomes are discounted at 3% per annum.
RESULTS: Considering a societal perspective over 3 years, this analysis shows 
that memantine ER combined with an AChEI provides better clinical outcomes and 
lower costs than AChEI monotherapy. Discounted average savings were estimated at 
$18,355 and $20,947 per patient and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) 
increased by an average of 0.12 and 0.13 from a societal and healthcare payer 
perspective, respectively. Patients on combination therapy spent an average of 4 
months longer living at home and spend less time in moderate-severe and severe 
stages of the disease.
CONCLUSION: Combination therapy for patients with moderate-to-severe AD is a 
cost-effective treatment compared to AChEI monotherapy in the US.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The heterogeneous nature of breast cancer can make 
decisions on adjuvant chemotherapy following surgical resection challenging. 
Oncotype DX is a validated gene expression profiling test that predicts the 
likelihood of adjuvant chemotherapy benefit in early-stage breast cancer. The 
aim of this study is to determine the costs of chemotherapy in private hospitals 
in France, and evaluate the cost-effectiveness of Oncotype DX from national 
insurance and societal perspectives.
METHODS: A multicenter study was conducted in seven French private hospitals, 
capturing retrospective data from 106 patient files. Cost estimates were used in 
conjunction with a published Markov model to assess the cost-effectiveness of 
using Oncotype DX to inform chemotherapy decision making versus standard care. 
Sensitivity analyses were performed.
RESULTS: The cost of adjuvant chemotherapy in private hospitals was estimated at 
EUR 8,218 per patient from a national insurance perspective and EUR 10,305 from 
a societal perspective. Cost-effectiveness analysis indicated that introducing 
Oncotype DX improved life expectancy (+0.18 years) and quality-adjusted life 
expectancy (+0.17 QALYs) versus standard care. Oncotype DX was found 
cost-effective from a national insurance perspective (EUR 2,134 per QALY gained) 
and cost saving from a societal perspective versus standard care. Inclusion of 
lost productivity costs in the modeling analysis meant that costs for eligible 
patients undergoing Oncotype DX testing were on average EUR 602 lower than costs 
for those receiving standard care.
CONCLUSIONS: As Oncotype DX was found both cost and life-saving from a societal 
perspective, the test was considered to be dominant to standard care. However, 
the delay in coverage has the potential to erode the quality of the French 
healthcare system, thus depriving patients of technologies that could improve 
clinical outcomes and allow healthcare professionals to better allocate hospital 
resources to improve the standard of care for all patients.

CONTEXT: Unplanned cancer-related hospital admissions often herald entry into 
the final phase of life. Hospitalized patients with advanced cancer have a high 
symptom burden and a short life expectancy, which may warrant palliative care 
intervention.
OBJECTIVES: To identify the impact of implementing triggered palliative care 
consultation (TPCC) as part of standard care for patients admitted to the 
solid-tumor oncology service with advanced cancer.
METHODS: We conducted a prospective, sequential, three-cohort study to evaluate 
TPCC feasibility and impact using patient-reported outcomes, electronic medical 
records to identify resource utilization, and surveys of oncologists' 
perspectives on TPCC.
RESULTS: Sixty-five patients were evaluated before TPCC implementation (Cohort 
1). Seventy patients (Cohort 2) were evaluated after initiation of TPCC, and 68 
patients (Cohort 3) were evaluated after modifications based on implementation 
barriers identified in Cohort 2. The percentage of patients correctly 
identifying their cancer as incurable increased from 65% in Cohort 1 to 94% in 
Cohorts 2 and 3. TPCC had minimal impact on hospice utilization, cost of care, 
survival, patient-reported symptoms, and patient satisfaction, likely because of 
the limited nature of the intervention. Implementation was challenging, with 
only 60% of patients in Cohort 2 and 62% in Cohort 3 receiving TPCC. Overall, 
the intervention was viewed favorably by 74% of oncologists.
CONCLUSION: Although TPCC was viewed favorably, implementation was logistically 
challenging because of short stays, high-acuity symptoms, and individual 
provider resistance. TPCC improved patients' understanding of their cancer. This 
population demonstrates high palliative care needs, warranting further research 
into how best to deliver care.

Design and Evaluation of an Intelligent Remote Tidal Volume Variability 
Monitoring System in E-Health Applications.

Fekr AR, Radecka K, Zilic Z.

A reliable long-term monitoring and diagnosis of breath disorders at an early 
stage provides an improvement of medical act, life expectancy, and quality of 
life while decreasing the costs of treatment and medical services. Therefore, a 
real-time unobtrusive monitoring of respiration patterns, as well as breath 
parameters, is a critical need in medical applications. In this paper, we 
propose an intelligent system for patient home care, capable of measuring 
respiration rate and tidal volume variability via a wearable sensing technology. 
The proposed system is designed particularly for the goal of diagnosis and 
treatment in patients with pathological breathing, e.g., respiratory 
complications after surgery or sleep disorders. The complete system was 
comprised of wearable calibrated accelerometer sensor, Bluetooth low energy, and 
cloud database. The experiments are conducted with eight subjects and the 
overall error in respiration rate calculation is obtained 0.29%±0.33% 
considering SPR-BTA spirometer as the reference. We also introduce a method for 
tidal volume variability estimation while validated using Pearson correlation. 
Furthermore, since it is essential to detect the critical events resulted from 
sudden rise or fall in per breath tidal volume of the patients, we provide a 
technique to automatically find the accurate threshold values based on each 
individual breath characteristics. Therefore, the system is able to detect the 
major changes, precisely by more than 98%, and provide immediate feedback such 
as sound alarm for round-the-clock respiration monitoring.

BACKGROUND: Several organizations have underscored the crucial need for 
patient-centered decision tools to enhance shared decision-making in advanced 
heart failure. The purpose of this study was to investigate the decision-making 
process and informational and decisional needs of patients and their caregivers 
regarding left ventricular assist device (LVAD) placement.
METHODS: In-depth, structured interviews with LVAD patients, candidates and 
caregivers (spouse, family members) (n = 45) were conducted. We also 
administered a Decisional Regret Scale.
RESULTS: Participants reported LVAD decision-making to be quick and reflexive (n 
= 30), and deferred heavily to clinicians (n = 22). They did not perceive 
themselves as having a real choice (n = 28). The 2 most prevalent informational 
domains that participants identified were lifestyle issues (23 items), followed 
by technical (drive-line, battery) issues (14 items). Participants easily and 
clearly identified their values: life extension; family; and mobility. 
Participants reported the need to meet other patients and caregivers before 
device placement (n = 31), and to have an involved caregiver (n = 28) to 
synthesize information. Some participants demonstrated a lack of clarity 
regarding transplant probability: 9 of 15 patients described themselves as on a 
transplant trajectory, yet 7 of these were destination therapy patients. 
Finally, we found that decisional regret scores were low (1.307).
CONCLUSIONS: Informed consent and shared-decision making should: (a) help 
patients offered highly invasive technologies for life-threatening disease get 
past the initial "anything to avoid thinking about death" reaction and make a 
more informed decision; (b) clarify transplant status; and (c) focus on 
lifestyle and technical issues, as patients have the most informational needs in 
these domains.

Zealand.

OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to estimate the incidence, prevalence and 
disability-adjusted life years (DALY) for traumatic brain injury (TBI) in New 
Zealand (NZ) in 2010.
METHODS: A multi-state life table model was constructed using inputs from the 
Brain Injury Outcomes New Zealand in the Community study for the first-ever 
incidence of TBI in a lifetime and its severity distribution, from the NZ 
Ministry of Health's Mortality Collection for the data on TBI mortality and from 
Statistics of NZ for the population data. The modeled estimate of prevalence was 
combined with the disability weights for TBI (by stage and severity level) from 
the Global Burden of Disease 2010 study to obtain estimates of health loss 
(DALYs) for TBI.
RESULTS: Approximately, 11,300 first-ever incident TBIs occurred in NZ during 
2010, with 527,000 New Zealanders estimated to have ever experienced a TBI 
(prevalent cases). The estimated 20,300 DALYs attributable to TBI accounted for 
27% of total injury-related health loss and 2.4% of DALYs from all causes. Of 
the total DALYs attributable to TBI, 71% resulted from fatal injuries. However, 
non-fatal outcomes accounted for a substantial share of the burden (29%) with 
mild TBI making the greater contribution of non-fatal outcomes (56%).
CONCLUSIONS: The burden of TBI in NZ is substantial, and mild TBI contributes to 
a major part of non-fatal outcomes.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The continually increasing life expectancy in man comes 
along with an increasing number of endoscopic interventions performed in 
patients with advanced or even very advanced age. Data on the feasibility and 
safety of ERCP in elderly patients are relatively scarce.
METHODS: By a systematic query of the University Hospital Frankfurt clinical 
database, patients undergoing their first ERCP procedure at our center were 
retrospectively identified. Patients were grouped according to age at the day of 
the intervention (>80 years, 61-80 years, 40-60 years, and <40 years). 
Demographic data, indication, outcome, and risk factors were compared among the 
indicated groups.
RESULTS: A total of 758 patients who underwent ERCP procedures at our center 
were identified and included in the study. Main indications for ERCP were 
intraductal gallstones in 345 patients (45%) and tumor obstruction of the bile 
ducts (distal common bile duct: n = 126 [16.5%], hilar cholangiocarcinoma: n = 
89 [11.7%], tumor of papilla of Vater: n = 16 [2.1%]). Gallstones were the most 
common cause for ERCP in patients aged >80 years (53.8%), and normal findings 
indicating exclusion of relevant disease were more frequent in patients <80 
years (13.4%) compared with older patients (4.3%) (P < .01). Sedation adverse 
events were significantly more common in individuals aged >80 years compared 
with younger patients (3.4% vs 0.5%; P < .01). However, post-ERCP pancreatitis 
was significantly less frequent in the older patients (>80 years) (0.9% vs 5.3%; 
P < .05). Other adverse events were equally distributed in all age groups. The 
ERCP success rate (>80%) was not different among age groups.
CONCLUSIONS: ERCP is safe and efficient in patients aged 80 years or older. 
However, conscious sedation must be carefully monitored in older patients 
because risk of sedation adverse events is increased. The incidence of post-ERCP 
pancreatitis is lower in older patients compared with younger ones.

OBJECTIVES: We present a review of what is known about the population dynamics 
from Classic and Post-Classic Maya settlements in coastal areas of the Yucatan 
Peninsula such as Jaina, Chac Mool, El Meco and Xcambó and two other urban 
centers, Palenque and Copan.
METHODS: This contribution discusses the available data on mortality, survival, 
life expectancy, fertility and migration, obtained by paleodemographic 
methodology. Data for Xcambó and El Meco were obtained from Tiesler Bloss et 
al., (2005) and Ortega (2007); information from other sites was obtained from 
previous work conducted by the authors.
RESULTS: This review proposes that the demographic dynamics of the Classical 
period are typical of densely populated and developing areas with overall 
average birth rates of six children per woman and a life expectancy at birth of 
between 20 and 42.2 years, which is equivalent to birth rates above 40 per 
thousand inhabitants. Post-Classic settlements show evidence of great population 
mobility with unfavorable changes in living conditions that lead us to think of 
fertility decrease and low life expectancies at birth.
CONCLUSIONS: There are indications of a demographic change between the 
Late-Terminal Classic and Post-Classic periods. Life expectancies are lower than 
30 years, a high infant mortality and low adult survival after 50 years is 
shown. The Post-Classic period is characterized by population rearrangements and 
mobility. Results obtained for both Chac Mool series showed deterioration in 
health and reduced life expectancy and fertility levels from one period to 
another. El Meco and Xcambó series showed differences with Chac Mool's due to 
higher growth rates.

BACKGROUND: As the population ages, older people account for a greater 
proportion of the health and social care budget. Whereas some research has been 
conducted on the use of music therapy for specific clinical populations, little 
rigorous research has been conducted looking at the value of community singing 
on the mental health-related quality of life of older people.
AIMS: To evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of community group 
singing for a population of older people in England.
METHOD: A pilot pragmatic individual randomised controlled trial comparing group 
singing with usual activities in those aged 60 years or more.
RESULTS: A total of 258 participants were recruited across five centres in East 
Kent. At 6 months post-randomisation, significant differences were observed in 
terms of mental health-related quality of life measured using the SF12 (mean 
difference = 2.35; 95% CI = 0.06-4.76) in favour of group singing. In addition, 
the intervention was found to be marginally more cost-effective than usual 
activities. At 3 months, significant differences were observed for the mental 
health components of quality of life (mean difference = 4.77; 2.53-7.01), 
anxiety (mean difference = -1.78; -2.5 to -1.06) and depression (mean difference 
= -1.52; -2.13 to -0.92).
CONCLUSIONS: Community group singing appears to have a significant effect on 
mental health-related quality of life, anxiety and depression, and it may be a 
useful intervention to maintain and enhance the mental health of older people.

Malnutrition is a global public health problem more prevalent in developing 
countries than in developed countries. Indicators of malnutrition include 
household food security and life expectancy. Corruption might be one of 
socio-political problems fuelling malnutrition in developing countries. The aim 
of this paper is to compare influence of corruption on food security, live 
expectancy (LE) and population in developed and developing countries. Thirty two 
least corrupt countries (LCC) and most corrupt countries (MCC) representing 
developed and developing countries were systematically selected using Corruption 
Perceptions Index (CPI). Countries' data on population, food security index 
(FSI) and LE scores were obtained from Global food security index (GFSI) and 
Population reference bureau. T-test, Multivariate (Wilks' Lambda), Pearson 
product moment analysis were performed to determine relationship between CPI, 
FSI, LE, and population in LCC and MCC at p < .05. Data were presented in 
tables, means and percentages. Mean CPI, Population, FSI, and LE in LCC and MCC 
were 71.5% and 24.2%; 34.8 and 41.7 million; 75.0% and 37.4%; and 78.4 years and 
62.4 years. There was a significant difference between CPI, FSI and LE in LCC 
and MCC (p < 0.05). CPI had a significant positive relationship with FSI and LE 
in LCC not MCC. There was also a significant relationship between FSI and LE in 
MCC. Low CPI influenced high FSI and LE in LCC while Low LE was associated with 
low FSI in MCC. Policies discouraging corrupt practices and promoting good 
governance should be embraced to eradicate malnutrition in developing countries.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is becoming more common due to the increase in life 
expectancy. This study evaluated the effect of selenofuranoside (Se) in an 
Alzheimer-like sporadic dementia animal model. Male mice were divided into 4 
groups: control, Aβ, Se, and Aβ + Se. Single administration of Aβ peptide 
(fragments 25-35; 3 nmol/3 μL) or distilled water was administered via 
intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection. Selenofuranoside (5 mg/kg) or 
vehicle (canola oil) was administered orally 30 min before Aβ and for 7 
subsequent days. Memory was tested through the Morris water maze (MWM) and 
step-down passive-avoidance (SDPA) tests. Antioxidant defenses along with 
reactive species (RS) were assessed. Inflammatory cytokines levels and AChE 
activity were measured. SOD activity was inhibited in the Aβ group whereas RS 
were increased. AChE activity, GSH, and IL-6 levels were increased in the Aβ 
group. These changes were reflected in impaired cognition and memory loss, 
observed in both behavioral tests. Se compound was able to protect against 
memory loss in mice in both behavioral tests. SOD and AChE activities as well as 
RS and IL-6 levels were also protected by Se administration. Therefore, Se is 
promising for further studies.

Osteoarthritis (OA) is becoming a major public health problem in China, 
especially considering the increase in average life expectancy of the 
population. Thus, enhanced understanding of the molecular changes associated 
with OA is urgently needed to develop more effective strategies for the 
diagnosis and treatment of this debilitating disease. LncRNAs play an important 
role in the processes of bone and cartilage development. Maternally expressed 
gene 3 (MEG3) is a maternally expressed lncRNA and may function as a tumor 
suppressor by inhibiting angiogenesis. OA is closely associated with 
angiogenesis and the inhibition of angiogenesis presents a novel therapeutic 
approach to reduce inflammation and pain in OA. In this study, we detected the 
mRNA expression of MEG3 and VEGF in articular cartilage samples from 20 OA 
patients and 10 healthy volunteers by real-time RT-PCR. VEGF protein is detected 
by ELISA in cartilage samples. The results show that human MEG3 is significantly 
downregulated in OA patients compared to normal cartilage samples. However, 
higher levels of VEGF mRNA and protein are found in OA compared to the control. 
Moreover, MEG3 levels are inversely associated with VEGF levels, suggesting that 
MEG3 may be involved in OA development through the regulation of angiogenesis.

Since the first living-donor kidney transplantation in 1954, more than half a 
million living kidney donations have occurred and research has advanced 
knowledge about long-term donor outcomes. Donors in developed countries have a 
similar life expectancy and quality of life as healthy non-donors. Living kidney 
donation is associated with an increased risk of end-stage renal disease, 
although this outcome is uncommon (<0·5% increase in incidence at 15 years). 
Kidney donation seems to elevate the risks of gestational hypertension and 
pre-eclampsia. Many donors incur financial expenses due to factors such as lost 
wages, need for sick days, and travel expenses. Yet, most donors have no regrets 
about donation. Living kidney donation is practised ethically when informed 
consent incorporates information about risks, uncertainty about outcomes is 
acknowledged when it exists, and a donor's risks are proportional to benefits 
for the donor and recipient. Future research should determine whether outcomes 
are similar for donors from developing countries and donors with pre-existing 
conditions such as obesity.

OBJECTIVE: We describe trends in life expectancy at birth (LE) and 
between-country LE disparities since 1965, in Latin America and the Caribbean.
METHODS & FINDINGS: LE trends since 1965 are described for three geographical 
sub-regions: the Caribbean, Central America, and South America. LE disparities 
are explored using a suite of absolute and relative disparity metrics, with 
measurement consensus providing confidence to observed differences. LE has 
increased throughout Latin America and the Caribbean. Compared to the Caribbean, 
LE has increased by an additional 6.6 years in Central America and 4.1 years in 
South America. Since 1965, average reductions in between-country LE disparities 
were 14% (absolute disparity) and 23% (relative disparity) in the Caribbean, 55% 
and 51% in Central America, 55% and 52% in South America.
CONCLUSIONS: LE in Latin America and the Caribbean is exceeding 'minimum 
standard' international targets, and is improving relative to the world region 
with the highest human longevity. The Caribbean, which had the highest LE and 
the lowest between-country LE disparities in Latin America and the Caribbean in 
1965-70, had the lowest LE and the highest LE disparities by 2005-10. Caribbean 
Governments have championed a collaborative solution to the growing burden of 
non-communicable disease, with 15 territories signing on to the Declaration of 
Port of Spain, signalling regional commitment to a coordinated public-health 
response. The persistent LE inequity between Caribbean countries suggests that 
public health interventions should be tailored to individual countries to be 
most effective. Between- and within-country disparity monitoring for a range of 
health metrics should be a priority, first to guide country-level policy 
initiatives, then to contribute to the assessment of policy success.

The protein family of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs) or diphtheria 
toxin-type ADP-ribose transferases (ARTDs) are multidomain proteins originally 
identified as DNA repair factors. There are 17 PARP enzymes in humans, and it is 
now evident that PARPs undertake more tasks than DNA repair. The aim of this 
review is to give a comprehensive view of the biological roles of the PARP 
family starting from the simplest biochemical reactions to complex regulatory 
circuits. Special attention will be laid on discussing linkage of PARP enzymes 
with tumor biology, oxidative stress, inflammatory, and metabolic diseases. A 
better understanding of PARP-mediated processes and pathologies may help in 
identifying new pathways and, by these, new targets to combat diseases that 
affect large populations and seriously shorten life expectancy and the quality 
of life, such as cancer, metabolic, or inflammatory diseases.

BACKGROUND: Within the standard gamble approach to the elicitation of health 
preferences, no previous studies compared probability equivalent (PE) and 
certainty equivalent (CE) techniques
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore the differences between CE and PE 
techniques when payoffs are expressed in terms of life-years or quality of life.
METHODS: Individuals were interviewed through both CE and PE techniques within 
an experimental setting. Inferential statistics and regression analysis where 
applied to process data. Order and sequence effect were also investigated.
RESULTS: On average, the elicitation technique did not affect individuals' risk 
attitude significantly. Individuals proved to be risk averse in gambles 
concerning life-years and risk seekers in those concerning quality of life. No 
order or sequence effect was observed. Risk premium, measuring the strength of 
risk attitude as the percentage variation between the individual's estimated PE 
or CE and the risk neutral PE or CE, was affected by the kind of gamble that the 
interviewee is presented with. It increased in gambles concerning health 
profiles, denoting a stronger risk propensity, and decreased in gambles 
concerning life years, denoting a stronger risk aversion.
CONCLUSION: The choice of the elicitation technique did not affect the 
individuals' risk attitude significantly, which instead was sensitive to the 
kind of gamble.

OBJECTIVES: To summarize the value adults place on child health and functional 
status and provide a new quantitative tool that enhances our understanding of 
the benefits of new health technologies and illustrates the potential 
contributions of existing data sets for comparative effectiveness research in 
pediatrics.
METHODS: Respondents, ages 18 years and older, were recruited from a nationally 
representative panel between August 2012 and February 2013 to complete an online 
survey. The survey included a series of paired comparisons that asked 
respondents to choose between child health and functional status outcomes, which 
were described using the National Survey of Children with Special Health Care 
Needs, a 14-item descriptive system of child health outcomes. Using respondent 
choices regarding an unnamed 7- or 10-year-old child, generalized linear model 
analyses estimated the value of child health and functional status on a 
quality-adjusted life-year scale.
RESULTS: Across the domains of health and functional status, repeated or chronic 
physical pain, feeling anxious or depressed, and behavioral problems (such as
