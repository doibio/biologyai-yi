Type 1 diabetes is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by the destruction 
of pancreatic beta cells which leads to an insulin deficiency. The onset of type 
1 diabetes mostly occurs before 25 years of age, but can also occur later in 
life. In 2015, 3.4 million Canadians were living with diabetes, of which an 
estimated 9% of adult patients and most pediatric patients are classified as 
type 1. Of this cohort, 0.3% of patients suffer from labile diabetes (also 
referred to as brittle or unstable diabetes and meaning hard to control) and may 
experience frequent episodes of hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia, diabetic 
ketoacidosis, and hypoglycemic unawareness. The lability of these patients’ 
blood glucose levels leads to a decreased quality of life and may reduce life 
expectancy. Type 1 diabetes is generally treated with insulin replacement 
therapy in the form of multiple daily injections. However, one alternative to 
insulin therapy, which may be beneficial to patients with labile diabetes, 
involves restoring endogenous insulin production via islet cell transplantation. 
Islet cell transplantation involves the infusion of purified islet cells from a 
deceased donor pancreas into the liver through the portal vein. As such, islet 
cell transplantation recipients require life-long treatment with 
immunosuppressive agents. With the introduction of ever improving, steroid free 
immunosuppression regimens (the first of which was the Edmonton Protocol in the 
year 2000), islet cell transplantation has become an increasingly feasible 
treatment option for patients with labile diabetes. In patients with type 1 
diabetes, islet cell transplantation may result in glucose stability (i.e., a 
reduction or elimination of hypoglycemia), improvement in glycated hemoglobin 
A1c (HbA1c), insulin independence, and may stabilize or improve microvascular 
complications (retinopathy and neuropathy) of diabetes. However, as a result of 
the small number of specialized transplantation centers and donor pancreases, 
the availability of treatment with islet cell transplantations for patients with 
type 1 diabetes has been limited. A CADTH report published in 2014 reviewed the 
clinical effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, and evidence-based guidelines 
regarding islet cell transplantation in patients with unstable diabetes. The 
report concluded that there was limited evidence to suggest that islet 
transplantation was effective in improving clinical outcomes in patients with 
unstable type 1 diabetes. Another CADTH report, which examined islet cell 
transplantation relative to different interventions, was published in March 2020 
and provided a reference list of studies and evidence-based guidelines published 
since the end of the aforementioned report’s literature search. This report aims 
to provide a summary and critical appraisal of the evidence regarding the 
clinical effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, and evidence-based guidelines 
regarding the use of islet cell transplantation in patients with unstable type I 
diabetes mellitus which was identified in the previous CADTH Reference List 
report.

Background/objective: To describe the design of 'DepMod,' a health-economic 
Markov model for assessing cost-effectiveness and budget impact of user-defined 
preventive interventions and treatments in depressive disorders.Methods: DepMod 
has an epidemiological layer describing how a cohort of people can transition 
between health states (sub-threshold depression, first episode of mild, moderate 
or severe depression (partial) remission, recurrence, death). Superimposed on 
the epidemiological layer, DepMod has an intervention layer consisting of a 
reference scenario and alternative scenario comparing the effectiveness and 
cost-effectiveness of a user-defined package of preventive interventions and 
psychological and pharmacological treatments of depression. Results are 
presented in terms of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained and healthcare 
expenditure. Costs and effects can be modeled over 5 years and are subjected to 
probabilistic sensitivity analysis.Results: DepMod was used to assess the 
cost-effectiveness of scaling up preventive interventions for treating people 
with subclinical depression, which showed that there is an 82% probability that 
scaling up prevention is cost-effective given a willingness-to-pay threshold of 
€20,000 per QALY.Conclusion: DepMod is a Markov model that assesses the 
cost-utility and budget impact of different healthcare packages aimed at 
preventing and treating depression and is freely available for academic purposes

BACKGROUND: Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people experience a greater 
burden of disease and die younger than non-Indigenous Australians, with 
Aboriginal people living in remote areas of the Northern Territory of Australia 
having the lowest life expectancy estimates. Despite a high burden of chronic 
disease among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, access to specialist 
health services remains low and models of care that increase engagement, may 
improve health outcomes.
METHODS: We describe client and staff perspectives of a model of clinical 
genetics services provided by the MJD Foundation (MJDF) in geographically and 
culturally complex contexts within the Northern Territory of Australia. We seek 
to understand the MJDF model's success in supporting Aboriginal families with 
the familial, neurodegenerative condition Machado-Joseph disease and how it 
could be applied in the provision of other specialist services. Thematic 
analysis was undertaken on semi-structured interviews with primary health care 
staff (n = 2), Non-Aboriginal MJDF Staff (n = 7) and Aboriginal MJDF Clients / 
Community workers (n = 13).
RESULTS: Four key themes regarding the MJDF model of service delivery were 
identified with the service being; 1) client led 2) accepting of various 
understandings of genetic disease causation 3) focused on relationships, 
continuity and trust between the service provider and the clients, and 4) 
committed to incorporating an inclusive whole-of-family practice. The MJDF model 
takes a community-based, person-and family-centred approach to successfully 
deliver effective specialist genetic health services in remote community 
settings. We propose that these approaches have broad application in the future 
design and delivery of specialist health services particularly in culturally 
complex settings.

Telomere length (TL) is a biomarker of biological aging that may be affected by 
prenatal exposure to air pollution. The aim of this study was to assess the 
association between prenatal exposure to air pollution and TL in maternal blood 
cells (leukocytes), placenta and umbilical cord blood cells, sampled immediately 
after birth in 296 Danish mother-child pairs from a birth cohort. Exposure data 
was obtained using the high-resolution and spatial-temporal air pollution 
modeling system DEHM-UBM-AirGIS for PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NH4+, black carbon (BC), 
organic carbon (OC), CO, O3, NO2, and NOx at residential and occupational 
addresses of the participating women for the full duration of the pregnancy. The 
association between prenatal exposure to air pollutants and TL was investigated 
using distributed lag models. There were significant and positive associations 
between TL in umbilical cord blood cells and prenatal exposure to BC, OC, NO2, 
NOx, CO, and O3 during the second trimester. TL in umbilical cord blood was 
significantly and inversely associated with prenatal exposure to PM2.5, BC, OC, 
SO2, NH4+, CO and NO2 during the third trimester. There were similar inverse 
associations between TL from umbilical cord blood cells and air pollution 
exposure at the residential and occupational addresses. There were weaker or no 
associations between air pollution exposure and TL in placenta tissue and 
maternal blood cells. In conclusion, both the second and third trimesters of 
pregnancy are shown to be sensitive windows of exposure to air pollution 
affecting fetal TL.

BACKGROUND: Primary endocrine therapy (PET) has been used as an alternative to 
primary surgery for elderly with estrogen receptor (ER) positive breast tumors. 
Such practices are less commonly performed in Asian countries and the response 
to PET in Chinese cohort is still lacking. This study aims to compare the 
clinical outcome of PET to primary surgery.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Medical records of Chinese patients aged 70 and above with 
stage I to III, ER positive breast cancer treated at a University affiliated 
tertiary hospital from 2008 to 2017 were reviewed. Excluding those with extreme 
comorbidity, a one-to-one case-control survival analysis of patients treated 
with PET or primary operation was performed, using propensity score case-match 
analysis to adjust for confounding factors.
RESULTS: 292 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria during the study period. 
209 patients received primary operation, whereas 83 patients received PET. 
Excluding those with extreme comorbidity, a one-to-one matching was performed, 
and the dataset was stratified into survival time within 0-5 years and beyond 5 
years. Both groups had similar survival within 0-5 years (p = 0.63). The 
survival curves diverged beyond 5 years, with a significantly better outcome in 
patients operated than those treated with PET (p = 0.0029).
CONCLUSIONS: For frail older patients with limited life expectancy, PET may be 
appropriate since equivalent survival can be achieved for PET with or without 
surgery. Those patients with longer life expectancy may gain survival benefits 
from local treatment. A comprehensive geriatric assessment is useful to predict 
the survival probability and guide the optimal treatment.

OBJECTIVE: To identify early life adversity (ELA) risk factors for earlier 
pubertal timing, itself a risk factor for poor cardiometabolic health, and to 
determine whether such ELA-related risk may be mediated by pre-pubertal body 
mass index (BMI).
METHODS: Subjects included 426 female participants in a prospective birth cohort 
study, the NICHD Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development. Survival 
analysis models were fit to examine ELA exposures, representing childhood 
socioeconomic status (SES), maternal sensitivity, mother-child attachment, and 
negative life events, along with child health indicators and covariates, in 
relation to pubertal timing outcomes, including age at menarche and ages at 
Tanner stage II for breast and pubic hair development.
RESULTS: Higher childhood SES emerged as an independent predictor of older age 
at menarche, showing each one standard deviation increase in childhood SES 
corresponded to a 1.3% increase in age at menarche (factor change = 1.013; 
1.003-1.022; p < .01), but did not predict breast or pubic hair development (ps 
> .05). In mediation analyses, indirect (mediated) effects of mother-child 
attachment on the pubertal timing outcomes, via pre-pubertal BMI, were all 
statistically significant (ps < .05).
CONCLUSIONS: Higher childhood SES predicted directly, and secure (vs. insecure) 
mother-child attachment predicted indirectly (via pre-pubertal BMI), later 
pubertal timing, suggesting these factors may protect girls from earlier 
pubertal development. By extension, clinical implications are that intervention 
strategies designed to lessen ELA- and pre-pubertal obesity-related risk may be 
effective in remediating life course pathways linking ELA, accelerated pubertal 
development, and cardiometabolic risk.

Education empowers humans and gets them ready to face challenges of life 
efficiently. Literacy and social media campaigns make people aware of the tools 
and techniques requisite for protection against the emerging diseases. In this 
paper, we investigate the combined impacts of literacy and social media on the 
dynamics of infectious diseases spreading through direct contact. Normalized 
forward sensitivity indices explore the impacts of parameters on basic 
reproduction number. We perform global sensitivity analysis for the infective 
population with respect to some controllable epidemiologically important 
parameters. If the growth rate of broadcasting informations through social media 
is very high, the system shows limit cycle oscillations. On the other hand, the 
baseline number of social media advertisements stabilize the system by 
evacuating persistent oscillations and ultimately settling the system from 
stable endemic equilibrium to stable disease-free state. The dissemination of 
awareness among literate people also suppresses the prevalence of limit cycle 
oscillations and drives the system to disease-free zone. An extension in model 
is made by assuming the growth rate of social media advertisements as periodic 
function of time. The simulation results show that the nonautonomous system 
showcases periodic as well as higher periodic solutions on the increase in the 
growth rate of advertisements. Our results evoke that media and education play a 
tremendous role in mounting awareness among the population leading to 
elimination of disease in the society.

BACKGROUND: Honeybees have extraordinary phenotypic plasticity in their 
senescence rate, making them a fascinating model system for the evolution of 
aging. Seasonal variation in senescence and extrinsic mortality results in a 
tenfold increase in worker life expectancy in winter as compared to summer. To 
understand the evolution of this remarkable pattern of aging, we must understand 
how individual longevity scales up to effects on the entire colony. In addition, 
threats to the health of honey bees and other social insects are typically 
measured at the individual level. To predict the effects of environmental change 
on social insect populations, we must understand how individual effects impact 
colony performance. We develop a matrix model of colony demographics to ask how 
worker age-dependent and age-independent mortality affect colony fitness and how 
these effects differ by seasonal conditions.
RESULTS: We find that there are seasonal differences in honeybee colony 
elasticity to both senescent and extrinsic worker mortality. Colonies are most 
elastic to extrinsic (age-independent) nurse and forager mortality during 
periods of higher extrinsic mortality and resource availability but most elastic 
to age-dependent mortality during periods of lower extrinsic mortality and lower 
resource availability.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that seasonal changes in the strength of 
selection on worker senescence partly explain the observed pattern of seasonal 
differences in worker aging in honey bees. More broadly, these results extend 
our understanding of the role of extrinsic mortality in the evolution of 
senescence to social animals and improve our ability to model the effects of 
environmental change on social insect populations of economic or conservation 
concern.

BACKGROUND: The Indian Ocean tsunami experience in 2004 caused a major loss of 
life and subsequent emotional trauma for survivors. Psychosocial needs in the 
aftermath of this disaster were extensive, yet the cohesion and effectiveness of 
response were limited due to lack of preparedness and relevant policy. The 
Schizophrenia Research Foundation (SCARF) was one of the organizations that 
quickly responded to provide psychosocial assistance to people in the tsunami 
affected areas and recognized a need for relevant research on disaster response. 
Therefore, we undertook research on the challenges, success and limitations of 
psychosocial interventions in alleviating post-traumatic symptomology.
DISCUSSION: Both community-level workers and researchers were limited in their 
preparedness to carry out tasks related to response. Language barriers, cultural 
differences, and a gap in long-term services limited the breadth and scope of 
research that was able to be completed. Lack of policy, poor co-ordination of 
services, lack of trained researchers and limited resources were challenges that 
emerged during this period and various strategies were adopted to meet these 
challenges.
CONCLUSIONS: Continued research and evaluation of data has brought crucial 
considerations to light, including the variance in symptomology, effective tools 
of measurement, and the nuanced response of survivors. Future research should 
take relevant factors into consideration including barriers to care. 
Understanding of the local language and religious beliefs are significant 
resources in understanding the nature of survivors' trauma response and 
effective means of coping. Lastly, limitations regarding time frame and scope of 
research should be evaluated to provide more effective, comprehensive methods in 
future studies.

INTRODUCTION: The objective of this study was to assess incremental costs and 
benefits of a human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination program expanded to include 
"mid-adults" (adults aged 27 through 45 years) in the United States.
METHODS: We adapted a previously published, dynamic mathematical model of HPV 
transmission and HPV-associated disease to estimate the incremental costs and 
benefits of a 9-valent HPV vaccine (9vHPV) program for people aged 12 through 
45 years compared to a 9vHPV program for females aged 12 through 26 years and 
males aged 12 through 21 years.
RESULTS: A 9vHPV program for females aged 12 through 26 years and males aged 12 
through 21 years was estimated to cost < $10,000 quality-adjusted life year 
(QALY) gained, compared to no vaccination. Expanding the 9vHPV program to 
include mid-adults was estimated to cost $587,600 per additional QALY gained 
when including adults through age 30 years, and $653,300 per additional QALY 
gained when including adults through age 45 years. Results were most sensitive 
to assumptions about HPV incidence among mid-adults, current and historical 
vaccination coverage, vaccine price, and the impact of HPV diseases on quality 
of life.
CONCLUSIONS: Mid-adult vaccination is much less cost-effective than the 
comparison strategy of routine vaccination for all adolescents at ages 11 to 
12 years and catch-up vaccination for women through age 26 years and men through 
age 21 years.

BACKGROUND: Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) and axillary lymph node dissection 
(ALND) may cause lymphatic and nervous system side effects in patients with 
breast cancer. It is imperative to develop a model to evaluate the risk of 
sentinel lymph node metastasis to avoid unnecessary operation.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 2705 cases of female breast cancer patients 
enrolled in this retrospective study. We divided into the training group (SLNB 
group) and the validation group (ALND group) to analyze the relathionship 
between lymph node metastasis and clinical-pathological factors. Logistic 
regression analysis was performed to verify the variables which involved in ALN 
metastasis and established a prediction model. ROC curves were employed to 
evaluate the predictive ability of the model.
RESULTS: In the SLNB group, 9 variables, including pathological type, 
histological grade, tumor size, hormone receptor, HER-2, Ki-67, multifocality, 
and molecular subtypes, were related to breast cancer ALN metastasis. Clinically 
negative lymph nodes, favorable histologic type, tumor size <2 cm, and Ki-67 
<15% were at very low risk for lymph node metastasis. The AUC of the validation 
group was 0.786.
CONCLUSION: We successfully establish a mathematics model to predict lymph node 
metastasis of breast cancer. Axillary surgery should be individual with 
preoperative clinical characteristics, especially for patients with a longer 
life expectancy.

Early diagnosis, multidisciplinary care, and optimized and preventive treatments 
have changed the face of cystic fibrosis. Life expectancy has been expanded in 
the last decades. Formerly a pediatric disease, cystic fibrosis has reached 
adulthood. Mutation-specific treatments will expand treatment options and give 
hope for further improvement of quality of life and life expectancy. Newborn 
screening for CF fits perfectly into these care structures and offers the 
possibility of preventive treatment even before symptoms occur. Especially in 
countries without screening, newborn screening will fulfill that promise only 
with increased awareness and new care structures.

OBJECTIVES: To describe the trend in the impact of lower urinary tract symptoms 
attributed to benign prostatic hyperplasia (LUTS/BPH) on a global scale using 
the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) database.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using the GBD database, worldwide data aggregated from 
registries and health systems from 1990 to 2017 were filtered for LUTS/BPH 
diagnoses. Calculation of years lived with disability (YLD) were compared with 
other urological diseases. YLD were calculated by a standardized method using 
assigned disability weights. The GBD-defined sociodemographic index (SDI) was 
used to assess impact of LUTS/BPH by global SDI quintile.
RESULTS: Global Burden of Disease data over the 1990-2017 study period were 
summarized and global numbers and trends noted with other urological diseases 
for comparison. A total of 2 427 334 YLD were attributed to BPH in 2017 alone, 
almost three times more than those attributed to the next highest urological 
disease, prostate cancer (843 227 YLD). When stratified by SDI quintile, a much 
lower impact of BPH was found in the bottom three quintiles, despite this subset 
representing 66.9% of the 2017 world population.
CONCLUSIONS: Lower urinary tract symptoms attributed to benign prostatic 
hyperplasia exert a rapidly rising human burden far exceeding other urological 
diseases. As the population ages and men in a lower SDI enjoy increased life 
expectancy and decreased competing mortalities, a continually accelerating wave 
of LUTS/BPH can be forecast. These epidemiological trends have serious 
implications for the future allocation of resources and the global urological 
workforce.

Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.

PURPOSE: To assess the trend patterns and gender disparity in global burden of 
vision loss due to diabetic retinopathy (DR) by year, age, region and 
socioeconomic status using prevalence and years lived with disability (YLDs) 
from Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study 2017.
METHODS: Prevalence and YLDs data of vision loss attributable to DR were 
extracted from GBD Study 2017 in 195 countries and territories. 
Socio-demographic Index (SDI) in 2017 was cited as indicators of socioeconomic 
status. Kruskal-Wallis test, Dunn's multiple comparisons and Pearson linear 
correlation were adopted to evaluate the gender disparity and association with 
socioeconomic levels.
RESULTS: Globally, total age-standardized prevalence and YLDs rates of vision 
loss due to DR peaked around 2005, with prevalence rate of 58.98 [95% 
uncertainty interval (UI) 50.95-68.56] and YLDs rate of 5.00 (95% UI 3.51-6.84) 
per 100 000 population, respectively. The burden were expected to increase to 
65.74 (95% UI 60.14-70.86) and 5.68 (95% UI 4.07-7.22) by 2050. The burden would 
increase according to our projection based on current epidemiological situation. 
However, gender disparity has existed since 1990 and been enlarging in recent 
years, with female being more heavily impacted. This pattern remained with 
ageing among different stages of vision impairments and varied through GBD super 
regions. Gender difference (females minus males) of age-standardized prevalence 
rates was positively related to SDI (r = 0.1661, p = 0.0203). Diabetes has 
become a more important risk over the past 3 decades among the leading causes of 
vision loss.
CONCLUSIONS: The DR-related vision loss burden tended to increase under ageing 
population according to our projection with significant gender disparity. Public 
awareness of DR and gender sensitive health policy should be emphasized.

Sushi meal has been adapting to different countries and traditions ever since it 
was invented. Recently there is a growing popularity of ready-to-eat sushi 
meals, with new sushi production plants emerging in many countries. This 
relatively new sushi industry is facing many challenges, one of which is the 
microbiological hazard related to sushi consumption. The aim of this review was 
to summarize the most significant aspects with regard to microbiological quality 
of sushi, reported cases of sushi-related poisoning, as well as the potential of 
modern innovative and emerging technologies to inhibit microbiological growth. 
Although there is a limited amount of studies in relation to sushi shelf-life 
extension, the existing data shows potential of using novel minimal processing 
technologies to improve the shelf-life and quality of sushi meals. Those 
technologies include the use of cold plasma, plasma activated water and 
electrolyzed water, as well as the use of innovative packaging and edible 
coatings. Based on the collected data, the possible microbiological hazards in 
the production process of sushi, with possible use of emerging technologies to 
reduce or eliminate those risks, are also emphasized.

Readmission Risk Factors and Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction.

Harmon D, Rathousky J, Choudhry F, Grover H, Patel I, Jacobson T, Boura J, 
Crawford J, Arnautovic J.

CONTEXT: Cases of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) 
exacerbations continue to affect patients' quality of life and cause significant 
financial burden on our healthcare system.
OBJECTIVE: To identify risk factors for readmission in patients discharged with 
a diagnosis of HFpEF.
METHODS: Electronic health records of patients over 18 years of age with a 
primary diagnosis of HFpEF treated between August 1, 2017 and March 1, 2018 in a 
community hospital were retrospectively reviewed. The study population included 
patients with HFpEF greater than 40% who were screened but did not qualify for 
the ongoing CONNECT- HF trial being conducted by Duke Clinical Research. To be 
included, subjects had to fall into 1 of 2 classifications (NYHA Class II-IV or 
ACC/AHA Stage B-D) and have a life expectancy greater than 6 months. Patients 
were excluded if they had terminal illness other than HF, a prior heart 
transplant or were on a transplant list, a current or planned placement of a 
left ventricular assist device, chronic kidney disease requiring hemodialysis, 
inability to use mobile applications, or inability to participate in 
longitudinal follow up. Readmission rate was analyzed at 30 and 90 days along 
with patients' demographics and associated comorbidities, including peripheral 
vascular disease, anemia, pulmonary hypertension, arrythmia, and valvular heart 
disease. Patients were risk stratified using the LACE index readmission score 
and the Charlson comorbidity index.
RESULTS: Of the 492 cases of HFpEF identified during the 7-month study period, 
212 patients were included. The majority of patients were women (126; 59.4%), 
had a median body mass index above 30 kg/m2 (123; 58%), and had pulmonary 
hypertension (94; 44.3%), anemia (146; 68.8%), and arrhythmia (101, 47.6%). 
Forty-five (21.2%) patients were readmitted for HFpEF within 90 days of initial 
discharge; 32 of those (71.1%) were readmitted within 30 days of initial 
discharge. Patients with higher LACE and Charlson comorbidity index scores were 
more likely to be readmitted within 90 days. Peripheral vascular disease 
(P=.002), tricuspid regurgitation (P=.001), pulmonary hypertension (P=.049), and 
anemia (P=.029) were risk factors associated with readmissions. Use of ACEi/ARBs 
(P=.017) was associated with fewer readmissions.
CONCLUSION: Anemia, peripheral vascular disease, pulmonary hypertension, and 
valvular heart disease are not only postulated mechanisms of HFpEF, but also 
important risk factors for readmission. These study findings affirm the need for 
continued research of the pathophysiology and associated comorbidities of the 
HFpEF population to improve quality of life and lower healthcare costs.

Continuation of Anti-TNF in Patients With Ulcerative Colitis in Remission Is Not 
Cost-effective Compared With Treatment Withdrawal: A Markov Model.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Anti-tumour necrosis factor alpha [anti-TNF] treatment 
accounts for 31% of health care expenditures associated with ulcerative colitis 
[UC]. Withdrawal of anti-TNF in patients with UC in remission may decrease side 
effects and infections, while promoting cost containment. Approximately 36% of 
patients relapse within 12-24 months of anti-TNF withdrawal, but reintroduction 
of treatment is successful in 80% of patients. We aimed to evaluate the 
cost-effectiveness of continuation versus withdrawal of anti-TNF in patients 
with UC in remission.
METHODS: We developed a Markov model comparing cost-effectiveness of anti-TNF 
continuation versus withdrawal, from a health care provider perspective. 
Transition probabilities were calculated from literature, or estimated by an 
expert panel of 11 gastroenterologists. Deterministic and probabilistic 
sensitivity analyses were performed to account for assumptions and uncertainty. 
The cost-effectiveness threshold was set at an incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio of €80,000 per quality-adjusted life-year [QALY].
RESULTS: At 5 years, anti-TNF withdrawal was less costly [-€10,781 per patient], 
but also slightly less effective [-0.04 QALY per patient] than continued 
treatment. Continuation of anti-TNF compared with withdrawal costs 
€300,390/QALY, exceeding the cost-effectiveness threshold. Continued therapy 
would become cost-effective if the relapse rate following anti-TNF withdrawal 
was ≥43% higher, or if adalimumab or infliximab [biosimilar] prices fell below 
€87/40 mg and €66/100 mg, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Continuation of anti-TNF in UC patients in remission is not 
cost-effective compared with withdrawal. A stop-and-reintroduction strategy is 
cost-saving but is slightly less effective than continued therapy. This strategy 
could be improved by identifying patients at increased risk of relapse.

BACKGROUND: Accurate diagnosis of the disease extension of cholangiocarcinoma 
(CCA) is often difficult in clinical practice. The diagnostic yield of 
conventional pre-operative imaging or endoscopic procedures is sometimes 
insufficient for the evaluation of longitudinal spreading of CCA. Here we 
investigated the usefulness of 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) for the pre- or 
intra-operative diagnosis of CCA, using patient-derived organoids.
METHODS: Four CCA- and two adjacent tissue-derived organoids were established. 
After 5-ALA treatment, we assessed their photodynamic activity using 
fluorescence microscopy.
RESULTS: CCA organoids established from different patients showed diverse 
morphology in contrast to monolayer structures of non-tumor organoids, and had 
the ability to form subcutaneous tumors in immunodeficient mice. CCA organoids 
demonstrated remarkably high photodynamic activity based on higher accumulation 
of protoporphyrin IX as a metabolite of 5-ALA compared to non-tumor organoids 
(40-71% vs. < 4%, respectively). Importantly, cancer cell-specific high 
photodynamic activity distinguished the organoids originated from biliary 
stenotic lesions from those of non-stenotic lesions in a CCA patient. The high 
photodynamic activity did not depend on the expression profile of heme 
biosynthesis genes.
CONCLUSIONS: Distinct 5-ALA-based photodynamic activity could have diagnostic 
potential for the discrimination of CCA from non-tumor tissues.

Advances in medicine and dietary standards over recent decades have remarkably 
increased human life expectancy. Unfortunately, the chance of developing 
age-related diseases, including neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs), increases 
with increased life expectancy. High metabolic demands of neurons are met by 
mitochondria, damage of which is thought to contribute to the development of 
many NDDs including Parkinson's disease (PD). Mitochondrial damage is closely
