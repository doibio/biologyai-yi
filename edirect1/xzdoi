People living with serious mental illness (SMI) experience physical health 
complications at disproportionate rates to people without an SMI. Unhealthy 
dietary intake and disordered eating behaviors are key driving factors. There is 
a lack of valid nutrition-risk screening tools targeted to mental health 
services, and typically used nutrition-risk screening tools are not suitable for 
mental health services. This paper details the rationale and study protocol for 
development and validation of the NutriMental screener, a tool for use in 
clinical practice to identify service users who are at risk for common nutrition 
issues experienced by this population group and trigger referral to a specialist 
clinician. The development process includes five phases. Phase I is the 
development of nutrition-related domains of interest from screening tools used 
in mental health services. Phase II involves a literature review and 
service-user interviews to identify additional domains. Phase III consists of 
international workshops with relevant clinicians and persons with SMI to gain a 
consensus on questions to be included in the draft tool. Phase IV involves 
conducting multinational feasibility and preliminary validation studies. Phase V 
consists of performing formal validation studies. The development of a 
nutrition-risk screening tool for mental health services is a necessary step to 
help rectify the physical-health disparities and life-expectancy gap for people 
with SMI.

The 'conventional framework' of economic evaluation, the comparative public 
sector healthcare costs and quality adjusted life year (QALY) of two or more 
interventions, has become synonymous with commissioning decisions in many 
countries. However, while useful as a framework in guiding value-based 
decisions, it has limited relevance in areas such as end of life care in 
children and young people, where the costs fall across multiple stakeholders and 
QALY gains are not the primary outcome. This paper makes the case that the 
restricted relevance of the 'conventional framework' has contributed to the 
inconsistent and varied provision of care in this setting, and to the knock-on 
detrimental impact on children nearing the end of their lives as well as their 
families. We explore the challenges faced by those seeking to conduct economic 
evaluations in this setting alongside some potential solutions. We conclude that 
there is no magic bullet approach that will amalgamate the 'conventional 
framework' with the requirements of a meaningful economic evaluation in this 
setting. However, this does not imply a lack of need for the summation of the 
costs and outcomes of care able to inform decision makers, and that methods such 
as impact inventory analysis may facilitate increased flexibility in economic 
evaluations.

The 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase (2-OGD) superfamily is one of the 
largest protein families in plants. The main oxidation reactions they catalyze 
in plants are hydroxylation, desaturation, demethylation, epimerization, and 
halogenation. Four members of the 2-OGD superfamily, i.e., flavonone 
3β-hydroxylase (F3H), flavones synthase I (FNS I), flavonol synthase (FLS), and 
anthocyanidin synthase (ANS)/leucoanthocyanidin dioxygenase (LDOX), are present 
in the flavonoid pathway, catalyzing hydroxylation and desaturation reactions. 
In this review, we summarize the recent research progress on these proteins, 
from the discovery of their enzymatic activity, to their functional 
verification, to the analysis of the response they mediate in plants towards 
adversity. Substrate diversity analysis indicated that F3H, FNS Ⅰ, ANS/LDOX, and 
FLS perform their respective dominant functions in the flavonoid pathway, 
despite the presence of functional redundancy among them. The phylogenetic tree 
classified two types of FNS Ⅰ, one mainly performing FNS activity, and the 
other, a new type of FNS present in angiosperms, mainly involved in C-5 
hydroxylation of SA. Additionally, a new class of LDOXs is highlighted, which 
can catalyze the conversion of (+)-catechin to cyanidin, further influencing the 
starter and extension unit composition of proanthocyanidins (PAs). The 
systematical description of the functional diversity and evolutionary 
relationship among these enzymes can facilitate the understanding of their 
impacts on plant metabolism. On the other hand, it provides molecular genetic 
evidence of the chemical evolution of flavonoids from lower to higher plants, 
promoting plant adaptation to harsh environments.

Celiac disease (CeD) is an immune-mediated enteropathy precipitated by ingestion 
of gluten in genetically predisposed individuals. Considering that CeD affects 
approximately 1% of the Western population, it may be considered a global health 
problem. In the large majority of cases, CeD has a benign course, characterized 
by the complete resolution of symptoms and a normal life expectancy after the 
beginning of a gluten-free-diet (GFD); however, an increased risk of developing 
malignancies, such as lymphomas and small bowel carcinoma (SBC), has been 
reported. In particular, enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma (EATL), a 
peculiar type of T-cell lymphoma, is characteristically associated with CeD. 
Moreover, the possible association between CeD and several other malignancies 
has been also investigated in a considerable number of studies. In this paper, 
we aim to provide a comprehensive review of the current knowledge about the 
associations between CeD and cancer, focusing in particular on EATL and SBC, two 
rare but aggressive malignancies.

BACKGROUND: Hypersensitivity reactions (HSR)s to platinum agents are increasing 
in frequency, due to their extensive use and repeated exposures in patients with 
increased life expectancy. The aims of our study are to analyze the frequency of 
both type I and type IV HSRs in patients with gynecological cancer treated with 
(CBDCA) carboplatin and/or (CDDP) cisplatin, to evaluate the role of skin tests 
in the diagnosis and prevention of HSRs.
METHODS: From 2011 to 2018, we evaluated 124 consecutive female patients 
previously treated with CBDCA and/or CDDP for gynecological cancer. All 
patients, including those with and without HSR to previous platinum-based 
therapy, underwent in-vivo skin tests for platinum agents before starting the 
second or more therapeutic lines. To reduce the risk of false negative results, 
patients with a negative skin test at the first evaluation were re-tested after 
3 weeks from the platinum re-exposure.
RESULTS: Among the 124 patients evaluated, 58 (47%) experienced HSRs to at least 
one platinum agent: 35% were to CBDCA, 5% to CDDP, 7% to both. Fifty-six of the 
58 HSRs were classified as immediate and two delayed. Skin tests confirmed an 
IgE-dependent mechanism in 67% of patients with immediate-HSRs to CBDCA and 
identified a cross-reactivity between platinum agents in 18% of patients. 
Moreover, among those who had never developed an HSRs during platinum-based 
therapy, in-vivo skin tests identified 12% of sensitized patients.
CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of our findings, skin test for platinum agents is a 
simple and sensitive tool for the diagnosis and prevention of HSRs to CBDCA 
and/or CDDP and can be useful for detecting possible cross-reactivity among 
platinum agents.

BACKGROUND: Different approaches have been used by dentists to base their 
decision. Among them, there are the aesthetical issues that may lead to more 
interventionist approaches. Indeed, using a more interventionist strategy (the 
World Dental Federation - FDI), more replacements tend to be indicated than 
using a minimally invasive one (based on the Caries Around Restorations and 
Sealants-CARS). Since the resources related to the long-term health effects of 
these strategies have not been explored, the economic impact of using the 
less-invasive strategy is still uncertain. Thus, this health economic analysis 
plan aims to describe methodologic approaches for conducting a trial-based 
economic evaluation that aims to assess whether a minimally invasive strategy is 
more efficient in allocating resources than the conventional strategy for 
managing restorations in primary teeth and extrapolating these findings to a 
longer time horizon.
METHODS: A trial-based economic evaluation will be conducted, including three 
cost-effectiveness analyses (CEA) and one cost-utility analysis (CUA). These 
analyses will be based on the main trial (CARDEC-03/ NCT03520309 ), in which 
children aged 3 to 10 were included and randomized to one of the diagnostic 
strategies (based on FDI or CARS). An examiner will assess children's 
restorations using the randomized strategy, and treatment will be recommended 
according to the same criteria. The time horizon for this study is 2 years, and 
we will adopt the societal perspective. The average costs per child for 
24 months will be calculated. Three different cost-effectiveness analyses (CEA) 
will be performed. For CEAs, the effects will be the number of operative 
interventions (primary CEA analysis), the time to these new interventions, the 
percentage of patients who did not need new interventions in the follow-up, and 
changes in children's oral health-related quality of life (secondary analyses). 
For CUA, the effect will be tooth-related quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). 
Intention-to-treat analyses will be conducted. Finally, we will assess the 
difference when using the minimally invasive strategy for each health effect 
(∆effect) compared to the conventional strategy (based on FDI) as the reference 
strategy. The same will be calculated for related costs (∆cost). The discount 
rate of 5% will be applied for costs and effects. We will perform deterministic 
and probabilistic sensitivity analyses to handle uncertainties. The net benefit 
will be calculated, and acceptability curves plotted using different 
willingness-to-pay thresholds. Using Markov models, a longer-term economic 
evaluation will be carried out with trial results extrapolated over a primary 
tooth lifetime horizon.
DISCUSSION: The main trial is ongoing, and data collection is still not 
finished. Therefore, economic evaluation has not commenced. We hypothesize that 
conventional strategy will be associated with more need for replacements of 
restorations in primary molars. These replacements may lead to more 
reinterventions, leading to higher costs after 2 years. The health effects will 
be a crucial aspect to take into account when deciding whether the minimally 
invasive strategy will be more efficient in allocating resources than the 
conventional strategy when considering the management of restorations in primary 
teeth. Finally, patients/parents preferences and consequent utility values may 
also influence this final conclusion about the economic aspects of implementing 
the minimally invasive approach for managing restorations in clinical practice. 
Therefore, these trial-based economic evaluations may bring actual evidence of 
the economic impact of such interventions.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT03520309 . Registered May 9, 2018. Economic evaluations 
(the focus of this plan) are not initiated at the moment.

The Etruscan shrew (Suncus etruscus) is one of the smallest mammals on earth and 
is used in many fields of research, including physiology, behavioral science and 
neuroscience. However, establishing and maintaining a breeding colony of this 
species in the laboratory can be challenging, as it requires specific husbandry 
conditions that greatly differ from those of more common laboratory species such 
as mice or rats. Over the past 15 y, we have successfully established a 
long-term thriving colony of 150 to 200 animals originating from 36 founders. 
The colony shows longer life expectancy and larger litter sizes than wild 
conspecifics. Breeding occurs year-round, independent of seasons, and a breeding 
pair can regularly produce 2 to 6 offspring with an average life expectancy of 
more than 3 y. The shrews are housed in glass or plastic enclosures on a 
specific soil-sand-mixture bedding and are provided with hideouts and nesting 
material consisting of moss, wood, or bark. Due to their high basal metabolic 
rate, the shrews require food intake greater than their body weight per day, can 
hunt arthropods as large as themselves, and cannot survive more than a few hours 
without food. Live feed such as crickets or mealworms is crucial and must be 
provided daily or, at the very least, every 2 d. Although our husbandry 
practices have constantly been adapted and refined, shrew husbandry remains 
challenging, and great care is necessary to meet the specific needs of this 
species. Here, we describe the establishment of a long-term stable colony of 
Etruscan shrews in a research animal facility and the specific husbandry 
requirements for animal wellbeing.

BACKGROUND: A patent foramen ovale (PFO) is formed when the ovale foramen does 
not close spontaneously or re-opens leaving the right and left atrium connected. 
The present study was conducted to analyze the cost-effectiveness of PFO closure 
with Amplatzer device plus medical therapy (MT) compared to MT alone in the 
French reimbursement system for PFO patients with a prior history of stroke, 
using the RESPECT study data.
METHODS: A multi-state Markov model was used. The analysis was conducted from a 
collective perspective over a 10-year time horizon with 4% discount applied for 
costs and health effects. The simulated population included adult patients with 
PFO. Sub-group analysis was limited to patients with atrial septal aneurysm 
and/or a large-shunt. Clinical inputs were derived from the RESPECT study and 
literature. Costs associated with the device, drugs, and management were sourced 
from literature and national databases. The outcomes of analyses included 
life-years (LYs), quality-adjusted LYs (QALYs), incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio (ICER), and number of recurrent strokes avoided. Scenario and sensitivity 
analyses were conducted to assess the robustness of the results.
RESULTS: The use of Amplatzer plus MT provided additional QALYs (0.16) at an 
incremental cost of 7301€, generating an ICER of 46,288€/QALY for Amplatzer vs. 
MT alone. In the sub-group analysis, Amplatzer plus MT provided additional QALYs 
(0.20) at an incremental cost of 5818€, generating an ICER of 28,624€/QALY for 
Amplatzer plus MT vs. MT alone. Amplatzer plus MT led to lower number of 
recurrent strokes in comparison to MT alone in both populations. Scenario and 
sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of the results.
CONCLUSION: Amplatzer plus MT represents a cost-effective treatment option and 
is associated with lower stroke recurrence compared to MT alone for PFO patients 
with a prior history of stroke.

OBJECTIVE: Little is known about clinicians' decision-making about decreasing 
active surveillance (AS) testing/converting patients to watchful waiting (WW), 
nor are there any guidelines. The objective of this study was to identify 
factors that clinicians consider when decreasing AS testing/converting to WW for 
men with prostate cancer.
DESIGN: Exploratory qualitative study.
SETTING: All participants practiced in various institutions in the USA.
PARTICIPANTS: Eligible clinicians had to provide clinical care for patients with 
prostate cancer in the USA and speak English. Clinicians could be either 
urologists or radiation oncologists. Of the 24 clinicians, 83% were urologists 
representing 11 states, 92% were men and 62% were white.
METHODS: This qualitative study used data from semi-structured interviews. 
Purposive sampling was used to ensure geographical variation in the USA. Data 
collection continued until thematic saturation was achieved. Framework analysis 
guided coding and identification of themes. Two researchers coded all 
transcripts independently, met to discuss and reached consensus.
RESULTS: Interviews with clinicians demonstrated that testing or monitoring for 
AS or transitioning to WW is happening in practice, whether intentionally or 
unintentionally. Decisions to decrease AS were personalised and tailored to 
patients' health status. Life expectancy was the dominant factor that influenced 
decision, but clinicians were generally hesitant to specify an age when they 
would decrease AS or transition to WW. Fear that poor adherence could lead to 
missed progression and concerns about the medico-legal issue of not doing enough 
were cited as barriers to decreasing AS.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that in certain situations, AS frequency is 
reduced or transitioned to WW, yet decisions appear to be inconsistent and there 
are no significant barriers. These findings could inform further areas to 
explore when drafting recommendations that consider patients' values and 
preferences when making decisions about decreasing AS/converting to WW.

OBJECTIVES: Hearing loss is one of the most prevalent congenital disorders among 
children. Many countries have implemented universal newborn hearing screening 
(UNHS) for the early diagnosis and treatment of hearing loss. Despite widespread 
implementation, the value for money of UNHS is unclear due to lack of cost and 
outcomes data from rigorous study designs. The objective of this research is to 
conduct a within-study cost-effectiveness analysis of UNHS compared with 
targeted screening (targeting children with risk factors of hearing loss) from 
the Australian healthcare system perspective. This evaluation is the first 
economic evaluation to assess the cost-effectiveness of UNHS compared to 
targeted screening using real-world data from a natural experiment.
DESIGN: The evaluation assumed the Australian healthcare system perspective and 
considered a time horizon of 5 years. Utilities were estimated using responses 
to the Health Utilities Index Mark III. Screening costs were estimated based on 
the Victorian Infant Hearing Screening Program. Ongoing costs were estimated 
based on administrative data, while external data sources were used to estimate 
costs related to hearing services. Missing data were handled using the multiple 
imputation method. Outcome measures included quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) 
and four language and communication-related outcomes: Peabody Picture Vocabulary 
Test, Wechsler Nonverbal Scale of Ability, Progressive Achievement Test, and 
comprehensive, expressive, and total language scores based on the Preschool 
Language Scale.
RESULTS: On average, the UNHS cost an extra Australian dollar (A$)22,000 per 
diagnosed child and was associated with 0.45 more QALYs per diagnosed child 
compared with targeted screening to 5 years, resulting in an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of A$48,000 per QALY gained. The ICERs for 
language outcomes lay between A$3,900 (for expressive language score) and 
A$83,500 per one-point improvement in language score (for Wechsler Nonverbal 
Scale of Ability). UNHS had a 69% probability of being more cost-effective 
compared to targeted screening at a willingness to pay threshold of A$60,000 per 
QALY gained. ICERs were most sensitive to the screening costs.
CONCLUSIONS: The evaluation demonstrated the usefulness of a within-study 
economic evaluation to understand the value for money of the UNHS program in the 
Australian context. Findings from this evaluation suggested that screening costs 
were the key driver of cost-effectiveness results. Most outcomes were not 
significantly different between UNHS and targeted screening groups. The ICER may 
be overestimated due to the short follow-up period. Further research is 
warranted to include long-term resource use and outcome data, late diagnosis, 
transition and remission between severity levels, and timing of diagnosis and 
treatment.

Posttranslational modifications (PTMs) could influence many aspects of protein 
behavior and function in organisms. Protein glycosylation is one of the major 
PTMs observed in bacteria, which is crucial for functional regulations of many 
prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. Mycobacterium bovis bacillus 
Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine has been recognized as an indispensable tool in 
the global fight against tuberculosis (TB) worldwide over several decades. 
Nevertheless, analysis of glycoprotein profiles of BCG has not been clearly 
investigated. In this study, we performed O-mannosylated protein analysis in BCG 
bacteria using gel-based and gel-free approaches. In total, 1,670 hexosylated 
peptides derived from 754 mannosylated proteins were identified. Furthermore, 20 
novel protein products supported by 78 unique peptides not annotated in the BCG 
database were detected. Additionally, the translational start sites of 384 
proteins were confirmed, and 78 proteins were validated through the extension of 
translational start sites based on N-terminus-derived peptides. The 
bioinformatic analysis of the O-mannosylated proteins was performed and the 
expression profiles of four randomly selected proteins were validated through 
Western blotting. A number of proteins involved in metabolic pathways, including 
the tricarboxylic acid cycle, glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation, and 
two-component system, are discussed. Taken together, these results offer the 
first O-mannosylated protein analysis of a member of mycobacteria reported to 
date by using complementary gel-based and gel-free approaches. Some of the 
proteins identified in this study have important roles involved in metabolic 
pathways, which could provide insight into the immune molecular mechanisms of 
this recognized vaccine strain.

Comorbidities and advanced stage diagnosis (ASD) are both associated with poorer 
cancer outcomes, but the association between comorbidities and ASD is poorly 
understood. We summarized epidemiological evidence on the association between 
comorbidities and ASD of selected cancers in a systematic review and 
meta-analysis. We searched PubMed and Web of Science databases up to June 3rd, 
2021 for studies assessing the association between comorbidities and ASD of 
lung, breast, colorectal, or prostate cancer. Summary odds ratios (ORs) and 95% 
confidence intervals (95%CIs) were calculated using random-effects models. Also, 
potential variations in the associations between comorbidities and ASD by cancer 
type were investigated using random-effects meta-regression. Thirty-seven 
studies were included in this review, including 8,069,397 lung, breast, 
colorectal, and prostate cancer patients overall. The Charlson comorbidity index 
score was positively associated with ASD (stages III-IV) of breast cancer but 
was inversely associated with ASD of lung cancer (pinteraction = 0.004). 
Regarding specific comorbidities, diabetes was positively associated with ASD 
(OR = 1.17, 95%CI = 1.09-1.26), whereas myocardial infarction was inversely 
associated with ASD (OR = 0.84, 95%CI = 0.75-0.95). The association between 
renal disease and ASD differed by cancer type (pinteraction < 0.001). A positive 
association was found with prostate cancer (OR = 2.02, 95%CI = 1.58-2.59) and an 
inverse association with colorectal cancer (OR = 0.84, 95%CI = 0.70-1.00). In 
summary, certain comorbidities (e.g., diabetes) may be positively associated 
with ASD of several cancer types. It needs to be clarified whether closer 
monitoring for early cancer signs or screening in these patients is reasonable, 
considering the problem of over-diagnosis particularly relevant in patients with 
short remaining life expectancy such as those with comorbidities. Also, 
evaluation of the cost-benefit relationship of cancer screening according to the 
type and severity of comorbidity (rather than summary scores) may be beneficial 
for personalized cancer screening in populations with chronic diseases.

Type 1 diabetes is on the rise globally; however, the burden of mortality 
remains disproportionate in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). As 
2021 marks 100 years since the discovery of insulin, we revisit progress, global 
burden of type 1 diabetes trends, and understanding of the pathogenesis and 
management practices related to the disease. Despite much progress, inequities 
in access and availability of insulin formulations persist and are reflected in 
differences in survival and morbidity patterns related to the disease. Some of 
these inequities have also been exacerbated by health-system challenges during 
the COVID-19 pandemic. There is a clear opportunity to improve access to insulin 
and related essential technologies for improved management of type 1 diabetes in 
LMICs, especially as a part of universal health coverage. These improvements 
will require concerted action and investments in human resources, community 
engagement, and education for the timely diagnosis and management of type 1 
diabetes, as well as adequate health-care financing. Further research in LMICs, 
especially those in Africa, is needed to improve our understanding of the 
burden, risk factors, and implementation strategies for managing type 1 
diabetes.

BACKGROUND: Since 2013, Hong Kong has sustained the world's highest life 
expectancy at birth-a key indicator of population health. The reasons behind 
this achievement remain poorly understood but are of great relevance to both 
rapidly developing and high-income regions. Here, we aim to compare factors 
behind Hong Kong's survival advantage over long-living, high-income countries.
METHODS: Life expectancy data from 1960-2020 were obtained for 18 high-income 
countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development from the 
Human Mortality Database and for Hong Kong from Hong Kong's Census and 
Statistics Department. Causes of death data from 1950-2016 were obtained from 
WHO's Mortality Database. We used truncated cross-sectional average length of 
life (TCAL) to identify the contributions to survival differences based on 263 
million deaths overall. As smoking is the leading cause of premature death, we 
also compared smoking-attributable mortality between Hong Kong and the 
high-income countries.
FINDINGS: From 1979-2016, Hong Kong accumulated a substantial survival advantage 
over high-income countries, with a difference of 1·86 years (95% CI 1·83-1·89) 
for males and 2·50 years (2·47-2·53) for females. As mortality from infectious 
diseases declined, the main contributors to Hong Kong's survival advantage were 
lower mortality from cardiovascular diseases for both males (TCAL difference 
1·22 years, 95% CI 1·21-1·23) and females (1·19 years, 1·18-1·21), cancer for 
females (0·47 years, 0·45-0·48), and transport accidents for males (0·27 years, 
0·27-0·28). Among high-income populations, Hong Kong recorded the lowest 
cardiovascular mortality and one of the lowest cancer mortalities in women. 
These findings were underpinned by the lowest absolute smoking-attributable 
mortality in high-income regions (39·7 per 100 000 in 2016, 95% CI 34·4-45·0). 
Reduced smoking-attributable mortality contributed to 50·5% (0·94 years, 
0·93-0·95) of Hong Kong's survival advantage over males in high-income countries 
and 34·8% (0·87 years, 0·87-0·88) of it in females.
INTERPRETATION: Hong Kong's leading longevity is the result of fewer diseases of 
poverty while suppressing the diseases of affluence. A unique combination of 
economic prosperity and low levels of smoking with development contributed to 
this achievement. As such, it offers a framework that could be replicated 
through deliberate policies in developing and developed populations globally.

BACKGROUND: India faces a high burden of diabetes and hypertension. Currently, 
there is a dearth of economic evidence about screening programmes, affected age 
groups, and frequency of screening for these diseases in Indian settings. We 
assessed the cost effectiveness of population-based screening for diabetes and 
hypertension compared with current practice in India for different scenarios, 
according to type of screening test, population age group, and pattern of 
health-care use.
METHODS: We used a hybrid decision model (decision tree and Markov model) to 
estimate the lifetime costs and consequences from a societal perspective. A 
meta-analysis was done to assess the effectiveness of population-based 
screening. Primary data were collected from two Indian states (Haryana and Tamil 
Nadu) to assess the cost of screening. The data from the National Health System 
Cost Database and the Costing of Health Services in India study were used to 
determine the health system cost of diagnostic tests and cost of treating 
diabetes or hypertension and their complications. A total of 962 patients were 
recruited to assess out-of-pocket expenditure and quality of life. Parameter 
uncertainty was evaluated using univariate and multivariable probabilistic 
sensitivity analyses. Finally, we estimated the incremental cost per 
quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained with alternative scenarios of scaling 
up primary health care through a health and wellness centre programme for the 
treatment of diabetes and hypertension.
FINDINGS: The incremental cost per QALY gained across various strategies for 
population-based screening for diabetes and hypertension ranged from US$0·02 
million to $0·03 million. At the current pattern of health services use, none of 
the screening strategies of annual screening, screening every 3 years, and 
screening every 5 years was cost-effective at a threshold of 1-time per capita 
gross domestic product in India. In the scenario in which health and wellness 
centres provided primary care to 20% of patients who were newly diagnosed with 
uncomplicated diabetes or hypertension, screening the group aged between 30 and 
65 years every 5 years or 3 years for either diabetes, hypertension, or a 
comorbid state (both diabetes and hypertension) became cost-effective. If the 
share of treatment for patients with newly diagnosed uncomplicated diabetes or 
hypertension at health and wellness centres increases to 70%, from the existing 
4% at subcentres and primary health centres, annual population-based screening 
becomes a cost saving strategy.
INTERPRETATION: Population-based screening for diabetes and hypertension in 
India could potentially reduce time to diagnosis and treatment and be 
cost-effective if it is linked to comprehensive primary health care through 
health and wellness centres for provision of treatment to patients who screen 
positive.

This research used a qualitative and quantitative approach to classify factors 
influencing wheat farmers' social, economic, and environmental vulnerability in 
Khorasan Razavi province, Iran, from the perspective of elite wheat farmers and 
agricultural specialists, and then to establish some recommendations based on 
the results. To achieve the study objectives, in the qualitative part, in-depth 
interviews were held with 20 agricultural specialists in the field of wheat 
cultivation, and 9 elite wheat farmers were selected using a purposive sampling 
method. Using stratified random sampling, 391 wheat farmers participated in the 
quantitative part. From the agricultural specialists' viewpoint, the prime 
factor affecting vulnerability was the social factor "farm management". The 
second factor was the environmental vulnerability factor "Sunn pest and heat", 
and the final factor was the economic vulnerability factor "the costs of 
fertilizer, equipment, and machines and their maintenance". In contrast, from 
the viewpoint of elite wheat farmers, the dominant factor affecting 
vulnerability was the economic factor "the costs of equipment, fertilizer, and 
machines and their maintenance". Regarding social vulnerability, "Governmental 
support" was stressed and the most important environmental vulnerability factor 
was "Sunn pest and cold". The results of confirmatory factor analysis were more 
in line with the views of agricultural specialists. According to the results, it 
is suggested that the agricultural extension system provides timely training to 
farmers in order to properly manage farms in times of crisis. The government 
should also compensate part of the costs of social and economic damage to 
farmers by providing free or low-interest loans.
