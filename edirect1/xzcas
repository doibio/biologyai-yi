partners, but those concerns proved to be less a problem than anticipated. All 
current patients are willing to continue daily HD; only a nursing shortage 
limits further extension of the program in the self-care/limited-care center.

BACKGROUND: West Nile virus (WNV) is the leading cause of domestically-acquired 
arboviral disease in the United States. Several WNV vaccines are in various 
stages of development. We estimate the cost-effectiveness of WNV vaccination 
programs targeting groups at increased risk for severe WNV disease.
METHODS: We used a mathematical model to estimate costs and health outcomes of 
vaccination with WNV vaccine compared to no vaccination among seven cohorts, 
spaced at 10year intervals from ages 10 to 70years, each followed until 
90-years-old. U.S. surveillance data were used to estimate WNV neuroinvasive 
disease incidence. Data for WNV seroprevalence, acute and long-term care costs 
of WNV disease patients, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and vaccine 
characteristics were obtained from published reports. We assumed vaccine 
efficacy to either last lifelong or for 10years with booster doses given every 
10years.
RESULTS: There was a statistically significant difference in cost-effectiveness 
ratios across cohorts in both models and all outcomes assessed (Kruskal-Wallis 
test p<0.0001). The 60-year-cohort had a mean cost per neuroinvasive disease 
case prevented of $664,000 and disability averted of $1,421,000 in lifelong 
model and $882,000 and $1,887,000, respectively in 10-year immunity model; these 
costs were statistically significantly lower than costs for other cohorts 
(p<0.0001). Vaccinating 70-year-olds had the lowest cost per death averted in 
both models at around $4.7 million (95%CI $2-$8 million). Cost per disease case 
averted was lowest among 40- and 50-year-old cohorts and cost per QALY saved 
lowest among 60-year cohorts in lifelong immunity model. The models were most 
sensitive to disease incidence, vaccine cost, and proportion of persons 
developing disease among infected.
CONCLUSIONS: Age-based WNV vaccination program targeting those at higher risk 
for severe disease is more cost-effective than universal vaccination. Annual 
variation in WNV disease incidence, QALY weights, and vaccine costs impact the 
cost effectiveness ratios.

Head and neck cancer in elderly patients represents a major health burden 
because its management provides unique and complex challenges for 
multidisciplinary teams, such as reduced treatment tolerance, multiple 
comorbidities, and altered pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. Despite the 
prominent challenges involved, high-level evidence for the management of this 
group of patients is scarce. Substantial advances in treatment, such as robotic 
surgery, dynamic intensity-modulated radiation therapy, immunotherapy, and 
de-escalation trials, might allow for improved treatment tolerance in this 
patient population. Advanced age alone does not appear to be a contraindication 
to curative treatment. Evaluation of age-specific factors such as life 
expectancy, impaired functional status, and cognitive decline warrant 
consideration as part of the management decision process. In this Review, we 
provide an update of the available evidence on the management of locoregionally 
confined head and neck cancer in elderly patients and propose a practical 
treatment algorithm for clinicians to help manage this patient population.

BACKGROUND: Several authors have reported on the utility of a laparoscopic 
approach for the palliation of malignant bowel obstruction (MBO); however, the 
advantages of laparoscopic surgery for MBO have not yet been confirmed.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients who 
underwent palliative surgery for MBO between 2007 and 2015. Laparoscopic 
procedures have been performed when technically possible since 2014. Successful 
palliation was defined as the ability to tolerate solid food (TSF) for at least 
2 weeks.
RESULTS: Twenty-two patients underwent laparoscopic palliative surgery, and 171 
patients underwent conventional open palliative surgery to relieve the symptoms 
of MBO. Laparoscopic palliative surgery was performed for patients with MBO due 
to colorectal cancer (n = 12), uterine cancer (n = 3), and other types of 
cancers (including gastric, prostate, and renal cancer). The following 
laparoscopic procedures were performed: stoma placement (n = 18), palliative 
resection (n = 3) and bypass (n = 2). The median operative time was 100 min and 
the median operative blood loss was 9 ml. The laparoscopic palliative operation 
allowed 91% (20/22) of the patients to consume a solid diet for more than 2 
weeks, and be discharged from hospital. There were no significant differences 
between laparoscopic surgery and open surgery with regard to the ability to TSF 
or the postoperative mortality rate. The postoperative morbidity (Clavien-Dindo 
Grade ≥ II) rates in the laparoscopic and open surgery groups were 14% and 32%, 
respectively. Laparoscopic surgery led to a significantly lower rate of 
postoperative surgical site infection (SSI) in comparison to open surgery (4.5% 
vs 32%; P = 0.0053).
CONCLUSION: A laparoscopic approach in palliative surgery for MBO was safe and 
feasible, and was associated with a lower incidence of SSIs. By minimizing the 
postoperative morbidity rate, the laparoscopic approach may provide significant 
benefits to patients with MBO who have a limited life expectancy.

BACKGROUND Retrograde advancement of microcatheters through septal/epicardial 
connectors can be challenging. Although several tricks might help to do so 
(e.g., balloon trap of retro wire in second guiding, balloon trap of retro wire 
in native coronary artery, and use of antegrade extension to approximate the 
antegrade conduit to the retrograde gear), these tricks cannot always be 
applied, especially in patients with poor access. Also, puncturing, knuckling, 
and crossing of the distal CTO cap (or the aorta as described in 1 of the cases) 
sometimes needs a lot of backup of the microcatheter. CASE REPORT We describe 3 
cases in which we used a novel telescopic technique with 5F Guidion (IMDS®) 
supported retrograde Corsair (Asahi®) advancement in complex CTO lesions. 
CONCLUSIONS The telescopic Corsair in 5F Guidion may offer the support needed to 
end successfully in these situations.

Pseudoexfoliation syndrome (PES) is a common age-related disorder affecting 
60-70 million people worldwide. Patients with PES have abnormal production and 
deposition of fibrillar material in the anterior chamber of the eye. These 
exfoliated fibrils, easily detected by ocular slit-lamp examination, have also 
been found to exist systematically in the skin, heart, lungs, liver and kidneys. 
Recently, myriad studies have associated PES with systemic conditions such as 
increased vascular risk, risk of dementia and inflammatory state. We review here 
the most current literature on the systemic implications of PES. Our aim is to 
encourage further studies on this important clinical entity.

Life expectancy of patients with rToF has considerably improved due to refined 
surgical interventions. Monomorphic fast VTs are frequently encountered in adult 
patients with rToF. The dominant substrate of VT is anatomical isthmuses 
bordered by surgical incisions, patch material and valve annuli. Substrate based 
ablation strategies aim to transect all slow conducting anatomical isthmuses 
(SCAI) as identified by electroanatomical mapping. Procedural success is defined 
as non-inducibility of VT and confirmed conduction block over the SCAI resulting 
in long-term VT free survival in most patients. The identification of SCAIs in 
rToF may have important implications for risk stratification and preventive 
treatment.

BACKGROUND: The Meridional Hospital Liver transplant unit is the only one active 
in all Espírito Santo State, Brazil, since 2004.
OBJECTIVE: The aim is to analyze data of the first 250 transplants performed by 
the team.
METHODS: This retrospective study reviewed files from patients transplanted in 
the Meridional Hospital from January 2005 to December 2015.
RESULTS: There were 250 liver transplants in 236 patients and 14 retransplants. 
72.4% were male recipients, with average age of 51.1 years (1-70 years), and the 
main etiology was alcoholic cirrhosis (33.6% of the cases). Surgical 
reintervention occurred in 58 patients (include retransplantations) during the 
same hospitalization, with revision of homeostasis and retransplant as main 
indications. In the retransplant group, 73.3% of patients died within 2 months. 
Thrombosis of the hepatic artery was responsible for 40% of the indications for 
retransplant. The average time between first and second transplant was 223 days 
(median 14 days). Currently 152 of 236 patients are living, with 1-year life 
expectancy of approximately 71%. The mortality peak occurred from the immediate 
postoperative period to 2 months post-transplant (63.8% of the deaths). 32% of 
subjects did not need intraoperative blood transfusion. The average time of 
intensive care unit stay was of 8.52 days, and overall hospital stay was 21.7 
(median 15 days).
CONCLUSION: Despite the logistic difficulties and lack of donors our unit, keep 
in advance with survival comparable to other national centers (68% to 74% in 
1-year).

Palliative care consultation (PCC) during hospitalization is increasingly common 
for older adults with life-limiting illness discharged to nursing homes. The 
objective of this qualitative descriptive study was to describe the care 
trajectories and experiences of older adults admitted to a nursing home 
following a PCC during hospitalization. Twelve English-speaking adults, mean age 
80 years, who received a hospital PCC and discharge to a nursing home without 
hospice. Data were collected from medical records at five time points from 
hospital discharge to 100 days after nursing home admission and care 
trajectories were mapped. Interviews (n = 15) with participants and surrogates 
were combined with each participant's medical record data. Content analysis was 
employed on the combined dataset. All PCC referrals were for goals of care 
conversations during which the PCC team discussed poor prognosis. All 
participants were admitted to a nursing home under the Medicare skilled nursing 
facility benefit. Seven were rehospitalized; six of the 12 died within 6 weeks 
of initial nursing home admission. The two care trajectories were Focus on 
Rehabilitative Care and Comfort Care Continuity. There was a heavy emphasis on 
recovering functional status through rehabilitation and skilled nursing care, 
despite considerable symptom burden and poor prognosis. Regardless of PCC with 
recommendations for palliative interventions, frail older adults with limited 
life expectancy and their family caregivers often perceive that rehabilitation 
will improve physical function. This perception may contribute to inappropriate, 
ineffective care. More emphasis is needed to coordinate care between PCC 
recommendations and post-acute care.

PURPOSE: To use patient-level microsimulation models to evaluate the comparative 
cost-effectiveness of early corneal cross-linking (CXL) and conventional 
management with penetrating keratoplasty (PKP) when indicated in managing 
keratoconus in Canada.
DESIGN: Cost-utility analysis using individual-based, state-transition 
microsimulation models.
PARTICIPANTS: Simulated cohorts of 100 000 individuals with keratoconus who 
entered each treatment arm at 25 years of age. Fellow eyes were modeled 
separately. Simulated individuals lived up to a maximum of 110 years.
METHODS: We developed 2 state-transition microsimulation models to reflect the 
natural history of keratoconus progression and the impact of conventional 
management with PKP versus CXL. We collected data from the published literature 
to inform model parameters. We used realistic parameters that maximized the 
potential costs and complications of CXL, while minimizing those associated with 
PKP. In each treatment arm, we allowed simulated individuals to move through 
health states in monthly cycles from diagnosis until death.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: For each treatment strategy, we calculated the total cost 
and number of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained. Costs were measured in 
Canadian dollars. Costs and QALYs were discounted at 5%, converting future costs 
and QALYs into present values. We used an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
(ICER = difference in lifetime costs/difference in lifetime health outcomes) to 
compare the cost-effectiveness of CXL versus conventional management with PKP.
RESULTS: Lifetime costs and QALYs for CXL were estimated to be Can$5530 
(Can$4512, discounted) and 50.12 QALYs (16.42 QALYs, discounted). Lifetime costs 
and QALYs for conventional management with PKP were Can$2675 (Can$1508, 
discounted) and 48.93 QALYs (16.09 QALYs, discounted). The discounted ICER 
comparing CXL to conventional management was Can$9090/QALY gained. Sensitivity 
analyses revealed that in general, parameter variations did not influence the 
cost-effectiveness of CXL.
CONCLUSIONS: CXL is cost-effective compared with conventional management with 
PKP in the treatment of keratoconus. Our ICER of Can$9090/QALY falls well below 
the range of Can$20 000 to Can$100 000/QALY and below US$50 000/QALY, thresholds 
generally used to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of health interventions in 
Canada and the United States. This study provides strong economic evidence for 
the cost-effectiveness of early CXL in keratoconus.

BACKGROUND: Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) is effective for obsessive-compulsive 
disorder (OCD), but requires expensive medical procedures. To date, no study has 
examined the cost-effectiveness of DBS for OCD.
OBJECTIVE: To perform the first economic evaluation of DBS for therapy 
refractory OCD.
METHODS: We conducted a 2-year prospective, open cost-effectiveness study, 
comparing DBS (n = 17) with treatment as usual (TAU) (n = 11), with cost per 
Quality-Adjusted-Life-Year (QALY) as outcome measure. Apart from the base-case, 
or primary analysis, we conducted two practice-based scenarios: (1) standard 
care scenario, without research and innovation costs, and (2) rechargeable 
scenario, in which we assume the use of a rechargeable battery. Base-case and 
both scenarios were extrapolated to four years to estimate long-term 
cost-effectiveness.
RESULTS: Compared to TAU, DBS provides an additional 0.26 QALY (SD = 0.16). 
Median cost per QALY gained is estimated at €141,446 for base-case, €115,916 for 
standard care and €65,394 for the rechargeable scenario. Extending the 
time-horizon to four years results in a median cost per QALY of €80,313 for 
base-case, €69,287 for standard care, and turned out to be cost-saving at €4678 
per QALY for the rechargeable scenario. Assuming a willingness to pay threshold 
of €80,000/QALY, DBS, under base-case and standard care had 25% and 35% 
probability of being more cost-effective than TAU. With the rechargeable 
scenario and in all scenarios extrapolated to four years, the probability of 
cost-effectiveness was equal or higher than TAU.
CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates DBS for OCD is cost-effective in the 
long-term, especially when rechargeable batteries are taken into account.

Although the peptide, exenatide, has been widely used as a drug for the 
treatment of type 2 diabetes, its short plasma half-life requires frequent 
subcutaneous injection, resulting in poor patient compliance in addition to side 
effects such as infection at the sites of injection. Here, we report a novel 
long-acting fusion peptide comprising exenatide and a human serum albumin 
(HSA)-binding aptide. A phage display screen of a library of aptides, yielded an 
HSA-specific aptide (APTHSA) that bound HSA with a Kd of 188nM. The recombinant 
fusion peptide comprising exenatide and APTHSA (exenatide-APTHSA) was expressed 
in Escherichia coli and purified by affinity and size-exclusion chromatography. 
The resulting exenatide-APTHSA fusion peptide showed glucose-induced insulin 
secretion activity similar to that of native exenatide when tested in vitro 
using the INS-1 cell line. A pharmacokinetic analysis of exenatide-APTHSA after 
subcutaneous administration revealed a 4-fold longer plasma half-life (1.3 vs. 
0.35h) compared with exenatide. Furthermore, exenatide-APTHSA showed 
significantly improved anti-hyperglycemic effects in oral glucose tolerance 
tests and enhanced hypoglycemic effects compared with exenatide in a db/db type 
2 diabetes mouse model. These results suggest that the exenatide-APTHSA fusion 
peptide could be used as a potential anti-diabetic agent for the treatment of 
type 2 diabetes.

AIM: To evaluate the frequency and the factors associated with the use of 
chemotherapy and artificial nutrition near the end of life in hospitalised 
patients with metastatic oesophageal or gastric cancer.
METHODS: Nationwide, register-based study, including all hospitalised adults 
(≥20 years) who died with metastatic oesophageal or gastric cancer between 2010 
and 2013, in France. Chemotherapy and artificial nutrition during the final 
weeks of life were considered as primary outcomes.
RESULTS: A total of 4031 patients with oesophageal cancer and 10,423 patients 
with gastric cancer were included. While the proportion of patients receiving 
chemotherapy decreased from 35.9% during the 3rd month before death to 7.9% in 
the final week (p < 0.001 for trend), the use of artificial nutrition rose from 
9.6% to 16.0% of patients. During the last week before death, patients with 
stomach cancer were more likely to receive chemotherapy (adjusted odds ratio 
(aOR) = 1.35, 95% CI = 1.17-1.56) but less likely to receive artificial 
nutrition (aOR = 0.80, 95%CI = 0.73-0.88) than patients with cancer of the 
oesophagus. The adjusted rates of chemotherapy use during the last week of life 
varied from 1.6% in rural hospitals to 11.2% in comprehensive cancer centres, 
while the adjusted probability to receive artificial nutrition varied from 12.1% 
in private for-profit clinics up to 19.9% in rehabilitation care facilities 
(p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that in hospitalised patients with metastatic 
oesophageal or gastric cancer, the use of chemotherapy decreases while the use 
of artificial nutrition increases as death approaches. This raises important 
questions, as clinical guidelines clearly recommend to limit the use of 
artificial nutrition in contexts of limited life expectancy.

The Japanese diet and the Mediterranean diet are both known to be good for 
health, but there had been no direct comparison of their health benefits. In 
this study, we compared the 1975 Japanese diet, which has been found to have 
high health benefits, with the 2010 Italian diet, which contributes to the 
longest life expectancy in Mediterranean countries. Diets were created using 
one-week menus of the two diets based on FAOSTAT Food Balance Sheets. The diets 
were prepared, freeze-dried, powdered and fed to mice for 4 weeks to examine 
their effects on lipid metabolism. In mice fed the Japanese diet, the visceral 
fat weight was lower, adipocytes were smaller, the liver weight was lower and 
liver TG tended to be lower than those fed the Italian diet, and little lipid 
accumulation was observed in hepatocytes of mice fed the Japanese diet. In 
addition, in mice fed the Japanese diet, the expression levels of genes related 
to fatty acid synthesis were lower, whereas those of genes related to catabolism 
of fatty acids and cholesterol were higher than those fed the Italian diet. 
Therefore, the Japanese diet reduced accumulation of lipids in the white adipose 
tissue and liver by suppressing fatty acid synthesis and promoting catabolism of 
fatty acids and cholesterol in the liver, compared to the Italian diet.

Ivemark syndrome is a heterotaxy syndrome which affects multiple organs and 
affects roughly 1 in every 6000 deliveries. Specifically, it can cause total 
anomalous pulmonary venous return and cardiac defects, which ultimately lead to 
decreased life expectancy. In order to better understand the nature of cardiac 
structures, CT angiogram has been heavily relied upon as it also allows for 3D 
reconstruction and optimal visualization of those features. This specific case 
presents with an anomalous venous return accompanied by multi-organ right 
isomerism that was reconstructed with 3D CT angiogram to better visualize and 
understand the cardiopulmonary system, as well as contribute to a fund of 
knowledge in hopes of discovering a solution to this condition.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review examines the delivery of rehabilitation care to 
cancer patients with relation to disease prognosis. This includes the evaluation 
when patients are referred for rehabilitation services and the effectiveness of 
rehabilitation interventions across the cancer continuum.
RECENT FINDINGS: Although prognosticating life expectancy is difficult, 
referrals for rehabilitation interventions appear to be affected by physician 
attitudes towards patients with advanced disease, in part because of 
misconceptions about the nature of rehabilitation for oncology patients. 
Rehabilitation may also be underutilized in long-term survivors with no evidence 
of disease. Despite this, our review found that rehabilitation in advanced 
disease, end-of-life, geriatric cancer patients, and in long-term survivors can 
be beneficial. There is a relative dearth in studies on rehabilitation 
interventions specifically at the end-of-life.
SUMMARY: Cancer rehabilitation can be helpful to patients along the spectrum of 
cancer prognoses. Examining more accurate ways to prognosticate life expectancy, 
improving communication and education between oncologists and rehabilitation 
team members, and modifying survivorship plans to include patient education on 
functional changes over time may improve the delivery of rehabilitation care.

Rehabilitation 2030: A Call to Action Relevant to Improving Musculoskeletal 
Health Care Globally.

Briggs AM, Dreinhöfer KE.

The profile of human health is changing across the globe such that the burden of 
noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), particularly musculoskeletal conditions, is 
becoming more profound. Such change demands that health systems adapt to better 
support people in maintaining a functional health state and quality of life, as 
life expectancy continues to increase. In parallel to the rising burden of NCDs, 
in particular a disability burden, the need for rehabilitation services is 
increasing. The World Health Organization (WHO) responded recently with 
"Rehabilitation 2030: A Call for Action" (February 6-7, 2017, Geneva, 
Switzerland) and the publication of key recommendations for action. In this 
editorial, the authors reflect on Rehabilitation 2030 and consider its 
implications for health system reform in the context of rehabilitation for 
musculoskeletal health. J Orthop Sports Phys Ther 2017;47(5)297-300.

Occupational therapy interventions in the treatment of people with severe mental 
illness.

University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Life expectancy of people with severe mental illness is 
considerably shortened and their risk for cardiovascular and metabolic disorders 
is increased. They spend more time in solitary and less time in structured 
activities than the general population.Engagement in healthy patterns of 
activity, including active, meaningful participation in the community can, 
therefore, be critical to recovery from severe mental illness. Occupational 
therapy is a profession that focuses on time use, activity patterns and 
occupational engagement, and the links to health and well-being. In this study, 
we review research evidence regarding approaches to occupational engagement, 
including behavioural activation, time use, and activity promotion. We also will 
review studies that specifically evaluate the impact of occupational therapy 
interventions.
RECENT FINDINGS: There is a growing body of evidence regarding the value of 
interventions addressing occupational engagement of individuals with severe 
mental illness, including a range of activation strategies and approaches. There 
is a need, however, for documentation of theoretically informed approaches that 
are supported by fidelity measures to ensure standardization.
SUMMARY: Larger-scale studies are needed, including consistent outcome measures 
to document engagement and changes in activity patterns as well as 
health-related outcomes. High-quality randomized clinical trials are important 
to establish effectiveness. As occupational therapy interventions are complex 
and embedded within a range of multidisciplinary approaches, new models of 
pragmatic trials within the naturalistic context of psychiatric rehabilitation 
are also needed.

BACKGROUND: Physical activity (PA) improves fatigue and quality of life (QOL) in 
cancer survivors. Our aim was to assess whether a 2-month PA intervention 
improves fatigue and QOL for people with advanced lung cancer.
METHODS: Participants with advanced lung cancer, Eastern Cooperative Oncology 
Group performance status (PS) ≤2, >6 months life expectancy, and ability to 
complete six-min walk test, were stratified (disease stage, PS 0-1 versus 2, 
centre) and randomized (1:1) in an open-label study to usual care (UC) 
(nutrition and PA education materials) or experimental intervention (EX): UC 
plus 2-month supervised weekly PA and behaviour change sessions. Assessments 
occurred at baseline, 2, 4, and 6 months. The primary endpoint was fatigue 
[Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Fatigue (FACT-F) questionnaire] at 
2 months. The study was designed to detect a difference in mean FACT-F subscale 
score of 6. Analysis was intention-to-treat using linear mixed models.
RESULTS: We recruited 112 patients: 56 (50.4%) were randomized to EX, 55(49.5%) 
to UC; 1 ineligible. Male 55%; median age 64 years (34-80); 106 (96%) non-small 
cell lung cancer; 106 (95.5%) stage IV. At 2, 4 and 6 months, 90, 73 and 62 
participants were assessed, respectively, with no difference in attrition 
between groups. There were no significant differences in fatigue between the 
groups at 2, 4 or 6 months: mean scores at 2 months EX 37.5, UC 36.4 (difference 
1.2, 95% CI - 3.5, 5.8, P = 0.62). There were no significant differences in QOL, 
symptoms, physical or functional status, or survival.
CONCLUSIONS: Adherence to the intervention was good but the intervention group 
did not increase their PA enough compared to the control group, and no 
difference was seen in fatigue or QOL.

This study explores how plasticity in biochemical attributes, used as indicators 
of health and condition, enables the coral Acropora tenuis to respond to 
differing water quality regimes in inshore regions of the Great Barrier Reef. 
Health attributes were monitored along a strong and weak water quality gradient, 
each with three reefs at increasing distances from a major river source. 
Attributes differed significantly only along the strong gradient; corals grew 
fastest, had the least dense skeletons, highest symbiont densities and highest 
lipid concentrations closest to the river mouth, where water quality was 
poorest. High nutrient and particulate loads were only detrimental to skeletal 
density, which decreased as linear extension increased, highlighting a 
trade-off. Our study underscores the importance of assessing multiple health 
attributes in coral reef monitoring. For example, autotrophic indices are poor 
indicators of coral health and condition, but improve when combined with 
attributes like lipid content and biomass.

BACKGROUND: Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a progressive motor neuron disease 
causing loss of motor function and reduced life expectancy, for which limited 
treatment is available. We investigated the safety and efficacy of olesoxime in 
patients with type 2 or non-ambulatory type 3 SMA.
METHODS: This randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 study was 
done in 22 neuromuscular care centres in Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, 
Netherlands, Poland, and the UK. Safety and efficacy of olesoxime were assessed 
in patients aged 3-25 years with genetically confirmed type 2 or non-ambulatory 
type 3 SMA. A centralised, computerised randomisation process allocated patients 
(2:1 with stratification by SMA type and centre) to receive olesoxime (10 mg/kg 
per day) in an oral liquid suspension or placebo for 24 months. Patients, 
investigators assessing outcomes, and sponsor study personnel were masked to 
treatment assignment. The primary outcome measure was change from baseline 
compared with 24 months between the two treatment groups in functional domains 1 
and 2 of the Motor Function Measure (MFM D1 + D2) assessed in the full analysis 
population. A shorter, 20-item version of the MFM, which was specifically 
adapted for young children, was used to assess patients younger than 6 years. 
Safety was assessed in all patients who received one or more doses of the study 
drug. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01302600.
FINDINGS: The trial was done between Nov 18, 2010, and Oct 9, 2013. Of 198 
patients screened, 165 were randomly assigned to olesoxime (n=108) or placebo 
(n=57). Five patients in the olesoxime group were not included in the primary 
outcome analysis because of an absence of post-baseline assessments. The change 
from baseline to month 24 on the primary outcome measure was 0·18 for olesoxime 
and -1·82 for placebo (treatment difference 2·00 points, 96% CI -0·25 to 4·25, 
p=0·0676). Olesoxime seemed to be safe and generally well tolerated, with an 
adverse event profile similar to placebo. The most frequent adverse events in 
the olesoxime group were pyrexia (n=34), cough (n=32), nasopharyngitis (n=25), 
and vomiting (n=25). There were two patient deaths (one in each group), but 
these were not deemed to be related to the study treatment.
INTERPRETATION: Olesoxime was safe at the doses studied, for the duration of the 
trial. Although the primary endpoint was not met, secondary endpoints and 
sensitivity analyses suggest that olesoxime might maintain motor function in 
patients with type 2 or type 3 SMA over a period of 24 months. Based on these 
results, olesoxime might provide meaningful clinical benefits for patients with 
SMA and, given its mode of action, might be used in combination with other drugs 
targeting other mechanisms of disease, although additional evidence is needed.

Chitosan edible films and coatings have shown great promise for their 
application in food preservation and also are promising systems to be used as 
essential oil (EO) carriers. This review reports the most recent and relevant 
studies concerning chitosan films and coatings containing EOs. The effect of EO 
incorporation on the antioxidant, antibacterial and antifungal activities of 
chitosan films and coatings in vitro and in vivo, as well as their applications 
in food systems have been discussed. In general, incorporation of EOs 
significantly increased the antioxidant, antibacterial and antifungal efficacy 
of chitosan films and coatings in vitro. EO-incorporated films and coatings also 
showed greater effectiveness against postharvest fungi and foodborne bacteria in 
food systems than pure films and coatings. The application of chitosan films and 
coatings containing EOs usually led to an extension of the shelf-life and 
reduction of lipid peroxidation of fish and meat products over pure chitosan 
films and coatings. In addition, chitosan coatings incorporated with EOs were 
more effective in maintaining fruit and vegetable quality, and controlling their 
postharvest decay during storage and shelf life than pure chitosan coatings.
