BACKGROUND: Data on health care utilization may be collected using a variety of 
mechanisms within research studies, each of which may have implications for cost 
and cost effectiveness.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this observational study is to compare data collected from 
medical records searches and self-report questionnaires for the cost analysis of 
a cardiac secondary prevention intervention.
METHODS: Secondary data analysis of the Secondary Prevention of Heart Disease in 
General Practice (SPHERE) randomized controlled trial (RCT). Resource use data 
for a range of health care services were collected by research nurse searches of 
medical records and self-report questionnaires and costs of care estimated for 
each data collection mechanism. A series of statistical analyses were conducted 
to compare the mean costs for medical records data versus questionnaire data and 
to conduct incremental analyses for the intervention and control arms in the 
trial.
RESULTS: Data were available to estimate costs for 95% of patients in the 
intervention and 96% of patients in the control using the medical records data 
compared to 65% and 66%, respectively, using the questionnaire data. The 
incremental analysis revealed a statistically significant difference in mean 
cost of -€796 (95% CI: -1447, -144; P-value: 0.017) for the intervention 
relative to the control. This compared to no significant difference in mean cost 
(95% CI: -1446, 860; P-value: 0.619) for the questionnaire analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings illustrate the importance of the choice of health care 
utilization data collection mechanism for the conduct of economic evaluation 
alongside randomized trials in primary care. This choice will have implications 
for the costing methodology employed and potentially, for the cost and cost 
effectiveness outcomes generated.

People with severe mental illness (SMI) experience a reduction in life 
expectancy of 15-20 years. Physical health and mortality experience may be even 
worse for ethnic minority groups with SMI, but evidence is limited. We suggest 
clinical, policy and research recommendations to address this inequality.

BACKGROUND: Leishmaniasis covers a range of clinical manifestations. Estimation 
of the burden of leishmaniasis may help guide healthcare management personnel 
and policy-makers in applying effective interventions. The present study aimed 
to calculate the incidence and burden of cutaneous and visceral leishmaniasis in 
Iran in 2013.
METHODS: To evaluate the epidemiological aspects of the disease in Iran, 
published studies over the past 20 years were searched and the viewpoints of 
relevant specialists in Iran were obtained. Data were collected from the 
Ministry of Health and from the Tehran University of Medical Sciences. To 
calculate years of life lost due to premature death, standard expected years of 
life lost was used. Standard life table of Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2010 
with the life expectancy of 86.02 years for both sexes was used to calculate the 
remaining potential years of life at any age from death.
RESULTS: The overall incidence of cutaneous and visceral leishmaniasis was 
calculated as 22 and 0.092 per 100000 population of Iran, respectively. The 
burden of leishmaniasis was 99.5 years: 95.34 and 4.16 years for cutaneous and 
visceral, respectively. Sensitivity was analyzed and deaths predicted by the 
Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation added, the burden of visceral 
leishmaniasis was 726 years.
CONCLUSION: The share of leishmaniasis burden in Iran is lower than the global 
burden of the disease. GBD 2010 standard method is recommended to calculate the 
burden of leishmaniasis in different countries and set local priorities on the 
basis of these measures.

As advances in the medical field have resulted in increased life expectancy, 
performing surgery under general anesthesia in elderly patients has become an 
important issue. A 99-year-old Okinawan female was admitted to the hospital 
presenting with pain in the tongue. Following physical examination, a clinical 
diagnosis of early stage tongue cancer (T2N0Mx) was confirmed. Early stage 
tongue cancer is particularly easy to access for surgical resection. By 
contrast, later stages of tongue cancer are associated with pain, dysphagia and 
throat obstruction. The patient and their family agreed to surgery due to the 
worsening pain associated with the tumor and gave informed consent for surgery. 
Following consultation with a cardiologist and an anesthesiologist, the tongue 
tumor was surgically resected under general anesthesia. Subsequent to surgery, 
the patient experienced pain relief and was discharged from the hospital on day 
14 post-surgery. The patient was able to maintain the same quality of life, and 
lived for 5 years and 2 months longer without evidence of disease, surviving to 
the age of 104 years old. The present case demonstrates that surgery under 
general anesthesia may be appropriate in patients of an advanced age, with a 
treatment plan that should ideally be based on careful assessment of the wishes 
of the patient and their family, medical risks, and benefits and economic costs 
of alternative treatments, in addition to consideration of the patient's 
culture.

Finland.

BACKGROUND: To reduce the risk of thromboembolic complications, clinical 
guidelines recommend anticoagulation treatment for almost all atrial 
fibrillation (AF) patients. Although warfarin has long been the primary 
treatment alternative, now newer alternatives such as apixaban have proven 
effective in prevention of the thromboembolic complications of non-valvular AF. 
The aim of this study is to assess the cost-effectiveness of apixaban when 
compared with warfarin in the prevention of AF-associated thromboembolic 
complications in Finland.
METHODS: The assessment was performed with a lifetime Markov-model with the 
following health states: non-valvular AF, ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, 
other intracranial bleed, other major bleed, clinically relevant non-major 
bleed, myocardial infarction, and systemic embolism. The treatment efficacies 
were obtained from the ARISTOTLE trial. Representative Finnish input data were 
used for the model states, including background mortality, resource use, costs 
(in 2014 values), and EQ-5D-3L-based quality of life. The results (with 3 % 
annual discounting) are presented as incremental cost-effectiveness ratios 
[ICER, cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained], the expected value of 
perfect information (EVPI), and the probability of apixaban being cost-effective 
at various willingness-to-pay levels.
RESULTS: Apixaban increased life-expectancy by 0.17 years and quality-adjusted 
life-expectancy by 0.14 QALYs when compared with warfarin. Additional QALY was 
gained with apixaban at a cost of 1824 euros based on the deterministic 
analysis. The maximum EVPI was 649 euros/patient at 1282 euros per QALY gained 
in the probabilistic analysis. The probability of apixaban being cost-effective 
reached 80 % when the willingness-to-pay per QALY gained was 14,857 euros. In 
deterministic sensitivity analyses, ICERs varied from dominance of apixaban to 
additional QALY being gained at a cost of 12,312 euros.
CONCLUSIONS: The ICERs obtained were well below the WHO-CHOICE threshold values 
for cost-effective interventions, suggesting that apixaban is a very 
cost-effective treatment alternative for warfarin in Finnish patients with AF.

Many neoplasms of the head and neck extend centripetally, gaining access to the 
central nervous system via nerves through the skull base foramina. Often 
patients with perineural spread have been excluded from aggressive interventions 
given the overall poor prognosis and technical difficulty when addressing the 
perineural components. However, in carefully selected patients combined surgical 
approaches can provide the greatest potential for disease control as well as 
neural decompression for symptom relief. We performed a retrospective chart 
review of 20 consecutive patients who underwent skull base approaches for 
resection of tumors with intracranial extension via perineural spread from 2011 
to 2014. Patients were evaluated for symptom change, surgical approaches, 
histopathology, adjuvant therapy, outcome, and prognosis. The most common 
presenting symptoms were pain or cranial nerve palsies. 55% of patients 
underwent endoscopic endonasal approaches, 50% transcranial approaches, and 15% 
underwent transfacial approaches. Overall 85% of patients reported symptom 
improvement in the post-operative period while 40% were completely asymptomatic 
following surgical resection. Ultimately, we observed a 45% mortality rate with 
an average survival of 8 months after diagnosis. In carefully selected patients, 
an aggressive multidisciplinary approach using a combination of surgical avenues 
to the skull base for the treatment of intracranial tumor via perineural 
extension can improve patient quality of life.

It has been reported that nitrate supplementation can improve exercise 
performance. Most of the studies have used either beetroot juice or sodium 
nitrate as a supplement; there is lack of data on the potential ergogenic 
benefits of an increased dietary nitrate intake from a diet based on fruits and 
vegetables. Our aim was to assess whether a high-nitrate diet increases nitric 
oxide bioavailability and to evaluate the effects of this nutritional 
intervention on exercise performance. Seven healthy male subjects participated 
in a randomized cross-over study. They were tested before and after 6 days of a 
high (HND) or control (CD) nitrate diet (~8.2 mmol∙day(-1) or ~2.9 mmol∙day(-1), 
respectively). Plasma nitrate and nitrite concentrations were significantly 
higher in HND (127 ± 64 µM and 350 ± 120 nM, respectively) compared to CD (23 ± 
10 µM and 240 ± 100 nM, respectively). In HND (vs. CD) were observed: (a) a 
significant reduction of oxygen consumption during moderate-intensity constant 
work-rate cycling exercise (1.178 ± 0.141 vs. 1.269 ± 0.136 L·min(-1)); (b) a 
significantly higher total muscle work during fatiguing, intermittent 
sub-maximal isometric knee extension (357.3 ± 176.1 vs. 253.6 ± 149.0 
Nm·s·kg(-1)); (c) an improved performance in Repeated Sprint Ability test. These 
findings suggest that a high-nitrate diet could be a feasible and effective 
strategy to improve exercise performance.

BACKGROUND: Lung remodeling and pulmonary fibrosis are serious, life-threatening 
conditions resulting from diseases such as chronic severe asthma and idiopathic 
pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Preclinical evidence suggests that JNK enzyme function 
is required for key steps in the pulmonary fibrotic process. However, a 
selective JNK inhibitor has not been investigated in translational models of 
lung fibrosis with clinically relevant biomarkers, or in IPF patients.
METHODS: The JNK inhibitor CC-930 was evaluated in the house dust mite-induced 
fibrotic airway mouse model, in a phase I healthy volunteer pharmacodynamic 
study, and subsequently in a phase II multicenter study of mild/moderate IPF 
(n = 28), with a 4-week, placebo-controlled, double-blind, sequential 
ascending-dose period (50 mg QD, 100 mg QD, 100 mg BID) and a 52-week open-label 
treatment-extension period.
RESULTS: In the preclinical model, CC-930 attenuated collagen 1A1 gene 
expression, peribronchiolar collagen deposition, airway mucin MUC5B expression 
in club cells, and MMP-7 expression in lung, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and 
serum. In the phase I study, CC-930 reduced c-Jun phosphorylation induced by UV 
radiation in skin. In the phase II IPF study, there was a CC-930 dose-dependent 
trend in reduction of MMP-7 and SP-D plasma protein levels. The most commonly 
reported adverse events were increased ALT, increased AST, and upper respiratory 
tract infection (six subjects each, 21.4 %). A total of 13 subjects (46.4 %) 
experienced adverse events that led to discontinuation of study drug. Nine out 
of 28 subjects experienced progressive disease in this study. The mean FVC (% 
predicted) declined after 26-32 weeks at doses of 100 mg QD and 100 mg BID. 
Changes in MMP-7, SP-D, and tenascin-C significantly correlated with change in 
FVC (% predicted).
CONCLUSIONS: These results illustrate JNK enzymatic activity involvement during 
pulmonary fibrosis, and support systemic biomarker use for tracking disease 
progression and the potential clinical benefit of this novel intervention in 
IPF. Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01203943.

OBJECTIVE: Fabry disease is a rare inherited lysosomal storage disorder caused 
by deficiency of α-galactosidase A. Effective enzyme replacement therapies are 
available that are administered intravenously. However, a new oral treatment is 
being developed as an alternative option for patients with amenable mutations. 
This study was designed to understand the value that people place on the 
different features of treatments for Fabry disease.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A discrete choice experiment (DCE) was designed to 
assess the importance of different aspects of treatments for Fabry disease. The 
attributes included overall survival, mode of administration, treatment related 
reactions, treatment related headaches and risk of antibody formation. 
Attributes were combined using a published orthogonal array into choice sets. A 
research panel was used to survey the UK general public. The mixed logit model 
was used to estimate strength of preference for the attributes and marginal 
rates of substitution (MRSs). Disutilities were estimated from the DCE data for 
changes in each attribute.
RESULTS: The sample (n = 506) was broadly representative of UK demographics. The 
logit model revealed that all attributes were significant predictors of choice. 
Participants were significantly more likely to choose a treatment which meant an 
increase in their life expectancy by 1 year (odds ratio = 1.574; 95% CI = 
1.504-1.647) and significantly less likely to choose self-administered 
intravenous (IV) treatment compared to an every other day tablet (OR = 0.426 95% 
CI = 0.384-0.474). Estimated disutilities were -0.0543 (self-administered 
infusion), treatment related headaches 12 times a year (-0.0361) and infusion 
reactions six times a year (-0.0202).
CONCLUSIONS: The survey revealed a significant preference for oral treatment 
compared with IV even in the context of a treatment that can extend overall 
survival. MRSs were used as a basis for estimating disutilities associated with 
changes in attribute levels which could be used to weight QALYs. It is possible 
that other important treatment attributes are missing from this research which 
may have provided further insights. It would also be useful to extend this 
research to include Fabry disease patients so their preferences can be assessed 
against the societal perspective.

BACKGROUND: Competitive athletes value the ability to return to competitive play 
after the treatment of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries. ACL 
reconstruction has high success rates for return to play, but some studies 
indicate that patients may do well with nonoperative physical therapy treatment.
PURPOSE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the treatment of acute ACL tears 
with either initial surgical reconstruction or physical therapy in competitive 
athletes.
STUDY DESIGN: Economic and decision analysis; Level of evidence, 2.
METHODS: The incremental cost, incremental effectiveness, and incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of ACL reconstruction compared with physical 
therapy were calculated from a cost-effectiveness analysis of ACL reconstruction 
compared with physical therapy for the initial management of acute ACL injuries 
in competitive athletes. The ACL reconstruction strategy and the physical 
therapy strategy were represented as Markov models. Costs and quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs) were evaluated over a 6-year time horizon and were analyzed 
from a societal perspective. Quality of life and probabilities of clinical 
outcomes were obtained from the peer-reviewed literature, and costs were 
compiled from a large academic hospital in the United States. One-way, 2-way, 
and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were used to assess the effect of 
uncertainty in variables on the ICER of ACL reconstruction.
RESULTS: The ICER of ACL reconstruction compared with physical therapy was 
$22,702 per QALY gained. The ICER was most sensitive to the quality of life of 
returning to play or not returning to play, costs, and duration of follow-up but 
relatively insensitive to the rates and costs of complications, probabilities of 
return to play for both operative and nonoperative treatments, and discount 
rate.
CONCLUSION: ACL reconstruction is a cost-effective strategy for competitive 
athletes with an ACL injury.

Primary medical prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) has received low 
priority in Tanzania, despite evidence of the rising prevalence of CVD risk 
factors. Different guidelines have been proposed for medical CVD prevention, 
including the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and the World Health 
Organization (WHO) guidelines, which recommend medical prevention for all 
individuals based on the consideration of single CVD risk thresholds. A third 
alternative is differentiated risk thresholds according to age. This paper 
compares the WHO and the differentiated risk threshold by age approaches against 
a baseline of no medical CVD prevention and a best scenario identical to the ESC 
approach in Tanzania. Assuming fixed budgets, we evaluate the guidelines 
according to three outcome measures, namely: efficiency, inequality and the 
combination of efficiency and inequality. We ran a Markov analysis for an 
estimated Tanzanian population at risk of CVD employing a 40 years time horizon 
to estimate the total expected costs and CVD deaths associated with provision of 
the different guidelines. The results were then used to calculate three 
outcomes: life expectancy at age 40 as a proxy for efficiency, the Gini 
coefficient (a measure of inequality), and the achievement index (which combines 
concerns of efficiency and inequality). Our results suggest that higher life 
expectancy (28.3 vs. 26.6 years) and more equally distributed health (Gini 
coefficient of 0.22 vs. 0.24) could be attained if medical CVD prevention was 
based on the differentiated risk threshold approach compared to the WHO single 
risk threshold, when the total cost of these approaches is the same. Preventing 
CVD based on differentiating risk thresholds by age seems to be the better 
alternative when concerns of both efficiency and inequality are considered 
important. However, further research on the country-specific distribution of CVD 
risk levels and budget impact analysis are important to assess the feasibility 
of its implementation.

To estimate the health impact of bathing in urban river waters a two-step risk 
assessment was conducted using the example of the Ruhr River in North-Rhine 
Westphalia (Germany). The risk of acquiring gastrointestinal illness (GI) due to 
bathing in the Ruhr River was the focus of this analysis. Referring to the WHO 
guidelines for safe recreational water environments, risk was defined as the 
probability of occurrence x severity of harm. Thus, the probability of acquiring 
GI by bathing in the Ruhr River has been calculated by means of the quantitative 
microbial risk assessment (QMRA) method. Additionally to this, harm was 
operationalized by using the DALY metric, quantifying the impact of disability 
for public health. The calculation of the DALYs based on the QMRA results, 
disease and lethality data of the population, duration of diseases, disability 
weights and a demographic profile of a regionally determined potential bathing 
population. DALYs were calculated for norovirus gastroenteritis, rotavirus 
gastroenteritis, cryptosporidiosis and giardiasis. The calculated DALYs were set 
into relation to other risks of daily life. Furthermore the effect of age 
weighting and time discounting for this site-specific population was considered. 
The viral load caused the main part of the environmental burden of disease by 
bathing in the river. The calculated DALYs are significantly lower than DALYs 
for all cause GI in Germany, which reach 1.19 DALY/1000, or DALYs accepted for 
an official EG designated bathing water (2.579 DALYs/1000 persons) but on a 
comparable level with the DALY for drowning (0.26 DALY/1000 Persons). The DALY 
concept provides a complementary tool to the QMRA for evaluating and comparing 
health risks arising from a specific environment for a specific population and 
behaviour and for comparing with other health risks of daily life.

Top themes of international research on disability in the past three decades are 
discussed: disability dynamics, buffers and barriers for disability, disability 
trends, and disability among very old persons. Each theme is highlighted by 
research examples. Turning to measurement, I discuss traditional measures of 
disability, new longer and shorter ones, and composites like disability-free 
life expectancy, noting their merits. Contemporary models of disability are 
presented, ranging from visual images to formal theories. The article ends on 
how scientists can facilitate movement of disability science into health care 
practice and policy.

OBJECTIVE: Most studies of population aging focus on only one characteristic of 
people: their chronological age. Many important characteristics of people vary 
with age, but age-specific characteristics also vary over time and differ from 
place to place. We supplement traditional measures of aging with new ones that 
consider the changing characteristics of people.
METHOD: The characteristics approach to measuring of population aging is 
employed. We provide examples of new measures of population aging using 
characteristics, such as remaining life expectancy, health, normal public 
pension age, and hand-grip strength.
RESULTS: Past and future population aging look less rapid using the 
characteristics approach, compared with traditional ones. For some regions, 
almost no aging occurred in the recent past.
DISCUSSION: Supplementing chronological age with ages that take into account the 
changing characteristics of people allows us to analyze aging more 
comprehensively and more accurately.

OBJECTIVE: To provide an example of a new methodology for using multiple 
characteristics in the study of population aging and to assess its usefulness.
METHOD: Using the English Longitudinal Study of Aging (ELSA), we investigate 
three characteristics of each person 60 to 85 years old, by level of education, 
hand-grip strength in 2004 (measured in kilos), chair rise speed in 2004 
(measured in rises per minute), and whether the person survived from 2004 to 
2012. Because the three characteristics are measured in different units, we 
convert them into a common metric, called alpha-ages.
RESULTS: We find that the average of the alpha-age differentials in the measures 
of upper body and lower body strength predicts educational differentials in 
subsequent survival better than either physical measure alone.
DISCUSSION: This result demonstrates the benefit of combining characteristics, 
using alpha-ages to convert incommensurate observations into a common metric.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of the article is to analyze past and present developments of 
working life expectancy (WLE) at age 50 by age, sex, and education in Europe. 
WLE is also compared with life expectancy (LE) and healthy life expectancy 
(HLE).
METHOD: WLE is calculated with the Sullivan method. Labor force participation is 
based on the European Union (EU) Labor Force Survey.
RESULTS: WLE at age 50 has been increasing since the mid- to late 1990s in most 
European countries. Increases were more pronounced among women than men. 
Differences in WLE by education are substantial. The comparison of WLE, LE, and 
HLE for the year 2009 reveals that the correlation between WLE and LE is smaller 
than between WLE and HLE.
DISCUSSION: The analysis of trends in WLE at age 50, particularly when set in 
relation to remaining LE, provides useful insights about the development of the 
distribution of economically active and inactive years in Europe's aging 
societies.

Pratique des Hautes Etudes (EPHE) and Institut National d'Etudes Démographiques 
(INED), France.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this article is to study to what extent European 
variations in differentials in disability by education level are associated to 
variation in poverty.
METHOD: Using the European Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC) 
for 26 countries, we measure the prevalence of activity limitation (AL) and the 
rate of economic hardship (EH) by level of education. We measure the increased 
AL prevalence (disadvantage) of the low-educated relative to the middle-educated 
and the reduced AL prevalence (advantage) of the high-educated groups, 
controlling or not for EH.
RESULTS: The rate of EH and the extent of the AL-advantage/disadvantage vary 
substantially across Europe. EH contributes to the AL-advantage/disadvantage but 
to different extent depending on its level across educational groups.
DISCUSSION: Associations between poverty, education, and disability are complex. 
In general, large EH goes along with increased disability differentials. Actions 
to reduce poverty are needed in Europe to reduce the levels and differentials in 
disability.

OBJECTIVE: To examine the health and functional characteristics of Mexican and 
Mexican American adults aged ≥80.
METHOD: Data came from Wave I (2001) and Wave III (2012) of the Mexican Health 
and Aging Study (MHAS), and Wave IV (2000-2001) and Wave VII (2010-2011) of the 
Hispanic Established Populations for Epidemiologic Studies of the Elderly 
(HEPESE).
RESULTS: In 2000-2001, diabetes, arthritis, hypertension, and stroke were higher 
in the HEPESE than in the MHAS. In the HEPESE, activities of daily living (ADL) 
difficulties and all health conditions, except heart attack, were greater in 
2010-2011 than in 2000-2001. In the MHAS, hypertension and ADL difficulties were 
greater, and arthritis was lower in 2012 compared with 2001. In 2010-2011, all 
self-reported health conditions were higher in the HEPESE compared with the 2012 
observation of the MHAS.
DISCUSSION: The observed differences may reflect worse health for Mexican 
Americans, health care access, reporting bias, and more selective survival to 
very old age in Mexico.

(3)Nihon University, Tokyo, Japan.

OBJECTIVE: This study examined the educational gradient of health and mortality 
between two long-lived populations: Japan and the United States.
METHOD: This analysis is based on the Nihon University Japanese Longitudinal 
Study of Aging and the Health and Retirement Study to compare educational 
gradients in multiple aspects of population health-life expectancy with/without 
disability, functional limitations, or chronic diseases, using prevalence-based 
Sullivan life tables.
RESULTS: Our results show that education coefficients from physical health and 
mortality models are similar for both Japan and American populations, and older 
Japanese have better mortality and health profiles.
DISCUSSION: Japan's compulsory national health service system since April 1961 
and living arrangements with adult children may play an important role for its 
superior health profile compared with that of the United States.

OBJECTIVE: To assess variation in gender gap (female-male) in inactive life 
expectancy (IALE) and active life expectancy (ALE) by definition of inactivity.
METHOD: Inactivity, among older Singaporeans, was defined as follows: Scenario 
1-health-related difficulty in activities of daily living (ADLs); Scenario 
2-health-related difficulty in ADLs/instrumental ADLs (IADLs); Scenario 
3-health-related difficulty in ADLs/IADLs or non-health-related non-performance 
of IADLs. Multistate life tables computed IALE and ALE at age 60, testing three 
hypotheses: In all scenarios, life expectancy, absolute and relative IALE, and 
absolute ALE are higher for females (Hypothesis 1 [H1]); gender gap in absolute 
and relative IALE expands, and in absolute ALE, it contracts in Scenario 2 
versus 1 (Hypothesis 2 [H2]); gender gap in absolute and relative IALE 
decreases, and in absolute ALE, it increases in Scenario 3 versus 2 (Hypothesis 
3 [H3]).
RESULTS: H1 was supported in Scenarios 1 and 3 but not Scenario 2. Both H2 and 
H3 were supported.
DISCUSSION: Definition of inactivity influences gender gap in IALE and ALE.

OBJECTIVE: Initiatives designed to monitor health typically incorporate numerous 
specific measures of health and the health system to assess improvements, or 
lack thereof, for policy and program purposes. The addition of summary measures 
provides overarching information which is essential for determining whether the 
goals of such initiatives are met.
METHOD: Summary measures are identified that relate to the individual indicators 
but that also reflect movement in the various parts of the system.
RESULTS: A hierarchical framework that is conceptually consistent and which 
utilizes a succinct number of summary measures incorporating indicators of 
functioning and participation is proposed.
DISCUSSION: While a large set of individual indicators can be useful for 
monitoring progress, these individual indicators do not provide an overall 
evaluation of health, defined broadly, at the population level. A hierarchical 
framework consisting of summary measures is important for monitoring the success 
of health improvement initiatives.

IgE-mediated Cannabis (C. sativa, marihuana) allergy seems to be on the rise. 
Both active and passive exposure to cannabis allergens may trigger a C. sativa 
sensitization and/or allergy. The clinical presentation of a C. sativa allergy 
varies from mild to life-threatening reactions and often seems to depend on the 
route of exposure. In addition, sensitization to cannabis allergens can result 
in various cross-allergies, mostly for plant foods. This clinical entity, 
designated as the 'cannabis-fruit/vegetable syndrome', might also imply 
cross-reactivity with tobacco, natural latex and plant-food-derived alcoholic 
beverages. Hitherto, these cross-allergies are predominantly reported in Europe 
and appear mainly to rely upon cross-reactivity between nonspecific lipid 
transfer proteins or thaumatin-like proteins present in C. sativa and their 
homologues, ubiquitously distributed throughout plant kingdom. At present, 
diagnosis of cannabis-related allergies predominantly rests upon a thorough 
history completed with skin testing using native extracts from crushed buds and 
leaves. However, quantification of specific IgE antibodies and basophil 
activation tests can also be helpful to establish correct diagnosis. In the 
absence of a cure, treatment comprises absolute avoidance measures. Whether 
avoidance of further use will halt the extension of related cross-allergies 
remains uncertain.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is a leading cause of morbidity 
and mortality in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). Although 
several ERCP-based diagnostic modalities are available for diagnosing CCA, it is 
unclear whether one modality is more cost-effective than the others. The primary 
aim of this study was to compare the cost-effectiveness of ERCP-based techniques 
for diagnosing CCA in patients with PSC-induced biliary strictures.
METHODS: We performed a cost utility analysis to assess the net monetary benefit 
for accurately diagnosing CCA using 5 different diagnostic strategies: (1) ERCP 
with bile duct brushing for cytology, (2) ERCP with brushings for cytology and 
fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)-trisomy, (3) ERCP with brushings for 
cytology and FISH-polysomy, (4) ERCP with intraductal biopsy sampling, and (5) 
single-operator cholangioscopy (SOC) with targeted biopsy sampling. A Monte 
Carlo simulation assessed outcomes including quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) 
and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Sensitivity analyses were 
also performed.
RESULTS: SOC with targeted biopsy sampling, as compared with ERCP with brushing 
for FISH-polysomy, produced an incremental QALY gain of .22 at an additional 
cost of $8562.44, resulting in a base case ICER of $39,277.25. Deterministic and
