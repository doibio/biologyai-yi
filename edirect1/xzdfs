the mechanism behind the effect of electric-acoustic stimulation (EAS) on the 
targeted SGNs. In this work, a biocompatible cochlear implant/graphene EAS 
system was created by combining a cochlear implant to provide the electrically 
transformed sound stimulation with graphene as the conductive neural interface. 
SGNs were cultured on the graphene and exposed to EAS from the cochlear implant. 
Neurite extension of SGNs was accelerated with long-term stimulation, which 
might contribute to the development of growth cones. Our system allows us to 
study the effects of cochlear implants on SGNs in a low-cost and time-saving 
way, and this might provide profound insights into the use of cochlear implants 
and thus be of benefit to the populations suffering from sensorineural hearing 
loss.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Mechanical thrombectomy (MT) has been recommended for 
the treatment of nonminor ischemic stroke by national and international 
guidelines, but cost-effectiveness evidence has been generated for only a few 
countries using heterogeneous evaluation methods. We estimate the 
cost-effectiveness of MT across 32 European countries.
METHODS: A Markov model was developed to estimate the cost-effectiveness of MT 
compared with standard care over a 5-year time horizon. Patients with ischemic 
stroke eligible for MT were identified from 2017 country-specific incidence 
data. A societal perspective was adopted, including health, social, and informal 
care costs, and productivity losses. Model outcomes were expressed as 
quality-adjusted life years. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to test the 
robustness of findings.
RESULTS: We identified 267 514 ischemic stroke cases that were eligible for MT 
treatment across 32 European countries. MT was found to be more effective and 
cheaper than standard care in two-thirds of the countries (21/32) and 
cost-effective in all but one country (Bulgaria). Across Europe, the 
intervention was estimated to produce over 101 327 additional quality-adjusted 
life years (95% uncertainty interval, 65 180-149 085) and cost savings of $981 
million (€868 million, 95% uncertainty interval, -1544 to 2564) and of $1.7 
billion (€1.5 billion, 95% uncertainty interval, -1.2 to 3.6) in health and 
social care and societal costs, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: MT is highly likely to be cost-effective compared with standard 
care across Europe as a whole and in the vast majority of European countries.

Alport Syndrome: A Comprehensive Review on Genetics, Pathophysiology, Histology, 
Clinical and Therapeutic Perspectives.

BACKGROUND: Alport syndrome (AS) is a disease caused by mutations in COL4A3, 
COL4A4 or COL4A5, the genes that encode distinct chains of type IV collagen. The 
vast majority of cases present as an inherited disorder, although de novo 
mutations are present in around 10% of the cases.
METHODS: This non-systematic review summarizes recent evidence on AS. We discuss 
the genetic and pathophysiology of AS, clinical manifestations, histopathology, 
diagnostic protocols, conventional treatment and prognostic markers of the 
disease. In addition, we summarize experimental findings with novel therapeutic 
perspectives for AS.
RESULTS: The deficient synthesis of collagen heterotrimers throughout the 
organism leads to impaired basement membranes (BM) in several organs. As a 
result, the disease manifests in a wide range of conditions, particularly renal, 
ocular and auricular alterations. Moreover, leiomyomatosis and vascular 
abnormalities may also be present as atypical presentations. In this framework, 
diagnosis can be performed based on clinical evaluation, skin or renal biopsy 
and genetic screening, the latter being the gold standard. There are no formally 
approved treatments for AS, even though therapeutic options have been described 
to delay disease progression and increase life expectancy. Novel therapeutic 
targets under pre-clinical investigation included paricalcitol, sodium-glucose 
co-transporter- 2 inhibitors, bardoxolone methyl, anti-microRNA-21 
oligonucleotides, recombinant human pentraxin-2, lysyl oxidase-like-2 blockers, 
hydroxypropyl-b-cyclodextrin, sodium 4-phenylbutyrate and stem cell therapy.
CONCLUSION: AS is still a greatly under and misdiagnosed disorder. The 
pathophysiology is still not fully understood and genetics of the disease also 
have some gaps. Up to know, there is no specific and effective treatment for AS. 
Further studies are necessary to establish novel and effective therapeutic 
protocols.

BACKGROUND: Locomotive syndrome (LS) is a high risk condition that requires 
nursing care. It is important to investigate the prevalence of and factors 
related to LS to maintain a healthy life expectancy for patients; however, only 
a few reports have focused on the relationship between LS and total hip 
arthroplasty (THA). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of 
LS and to identify factors associated with LS in patients more than 10 years 
after THA.
METHODS: This is a cross-sectional cohort study. Patients were assessed via a 
mail survey that included items regarding demographic data, cardiometabolic and 
motor disorders, the incidence of falls, physical activity level, and the 
25-question Geriatric Locomotive Function Scale (GLFS-25) questionnaire. LS was 
defined as having a score ≥16 on the GLFS-25, and the respondents were 
categorized into two groups: an LS group and a non-LS group. The prevalence of 
LS was calculated in each gender and age group. Differences in variables between 
the groups were determined using the unpaired t-test and chi-squared test.
RESULTS: A total of 593 patients were included in the study (mean age, 70.4 
years; 525/593 females). According to the GLFS-25, 164 patients (27.7%; 21.1% 
men and 28.8% women) were classified as having LS, which increased with age. In 
addition, compared with the non-LS group, the LS group had a significantly 
higher prevalence of motor diseases, cardiometabolic diseases, and falls and 
significantly lower levels of activity.
CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that the prevalence of LS in patients more 
than 10 years after THA is 27.7%. The result suggest that the prevalence of LS 
in patients more than 10 years after THA is similar to the prevalence of LS in 
the general elderly population. Furthermore, LS is related to not only motor 
diseases but also cardiometabolic diseases.

In every field of life, advanced technology has become a rapid outcome, 
particularly in the medical field. The recent epidemic of the coronavirus 
disease 2019 (COVID-19) has promptly become outbreaks to identify early action 
from suspected cases at the primary stage over the risk prediction. It is 
overbearing to progress a control system that will locate the coronavirus. At 
present, the confirmation of COVID-19 infection by the ideal standard test of 
reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) by the extension of 
RNA viral, although it presents identified from deficiencies of long reversal 
time to generate results in 2-4 h of corona with a necessity of certified 
laboratories. In this proposed system, a machine learning (ML) algorithm is used 
to classify the textual clinical report into four classes by using the textual 
data mining method. The algorithm of the ensemble ML classifier has performed 
feature extraction using the advanced techniques of term frequency-inverse 
document frequency (TF/IDF) which is an effective information retrieval 
technique from the corona dataset. Humans get infected by coronaviruses in three 
ways: first, mild respiratory disease which is globally pandemic, and human 
coronaviruses are caused by HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, and HCoV-229E; 
second, the zoonotic Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV); 
and finally, higher case casualty rate defined as severe acute respiratory 
syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). By using the machine learning techniques, the 
three-way COVID-19 stages are classified by the extraction of the feature using 
the data retrieval process. The TF/IDF is used to measure and evaluate 
statistically the text data mining of COVID-19 patient's record list for 
classification and prediction of the coronavirus. This study established the 
feasibility of techniques to analyze blood tests and machine learning as an 
alternative to rRT-PCR for detecting the category of COVID-19-positive patients.

Options and limitations of implant constraint.

Marya SKS(1), Singh C(1).

With an ever-increasing number of revisions, the surgeons will be faced with the 
dilemma of choosing the right implant for the revision knee. The soft tissue 
viability governs the choice of an implant at the time of revision. The 
selection ranges from the cruciate-retaining to the rotating/fixed hinge 
implants. The surgeon needs to plan preoperatively, but usually, the final 
decisions are made intraoperative. As determining the amount of constraint 
necessary can be challenging, we have tried to lay down a few pointers, which 
would help to make that choice. The posterior stabilized implants can manage 
most revision knees; in certain situations where they cannot accommodate the 
flexion-extension gap imbalance, a varus-valgus constrained implant should be 
used. The rotating hinge implants are used for severe instabilities or loss of 
soft tissue or bone around the knee. The use of a higher constraint implant has 
its consequences like reduced life span and reduced function. Thus it is crucial 
to use the least amount of constraint as necessary - however, as much as 
required.

All biotic species, including humans, requires energy for their survival and 
obtained from the process of metabolism. Present work deals with the 
thermodynamic analysis of the metabolic process of humans and establishes the 
relation for entropy generation. Further, this entropy generation is linked with 
the thermodynamics life cycle assessment of humans. Data used in this work is 
provided by the National sample survey office (NSSO), Government of India. 
Entropy generation is determined on the bases of per kg of carbohydrate, 
palmitic acid and 20 amino acids. Finally, the life span of humans has been 
determined on the grounds of the entropy generation. Entropy generated by 
Haryana people is maximum in all states, and Tamilnadu people have the minimum 
among all the states. Total entropy production for Haryana is 23.59 kJ/K-kg-food 
and for Tamilnadu 19.71 kJ/K-kg-food. People living in Haryana has a life span 
of 66 years, and Tamilnadu people have a life span of 79 years. The life span 
for other states ranging in 66-79 years. Variation of ±3% is recorded in the 
life span of people when compared with the NITI Aayog report. There is a minor 
difference of 1.22 years in case of life expectancy of Kerla when compared to 
the NITI Aayog report. In current research work effect of water and air, 
inhalation is not considered. So one can think these parameters and analyze the 
variation of the result.

Introduction The number of octogenarian invasive breast cancer cases is 
projected to increase, as there is a significant increase in life expectancy. 
However, no specific treatment guideline has been established so far for this 
vulnerable group of patients. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the 
treatment outcomes of octogenarians diagnosed with early and locally advanced 
invasive breast cancer, to compare those who underwent surgery with conventional 
treatment and those who did not, and to reveal the potential social factors that 
may affect their therapy outcomes. Material and methods A total of 78 patients 
aged 80 and over were included in the study. There was a significant 
relationship between a patient's social milieu and treatment status (p < 0.001). 
The relationship between receiving endocrine therapy or surgical treatment was 
also significant (p = 0.029). Results The surgical treatment rate was 90.9% in 
survivors, which was significantly lower in those who passed away (37.8%, p < 
0.001). According to the log-rank test results, life expectancy was 
significantly longer in operated patients than in non-operated ones (p < 0.001). 
The median survival length was 62 months (range: 33.8-90.2) in operated patients 
80 years of age and above and 19 months (range: 16.3-21.7) in non-operated ones. 
The surgical treatment frequency was 15.30 times (range: 4.86-48.21) higher in 
patients living with family than in patients living alone or in a nursing home. 
Conclusion Thus, the social milieu of the patients, especially the place of 
residence, had a major impact on the treatment of the elderly (octogenarians) 
patients with breast cancer. Surgery and endocrine therapy as an adjuvant 
treatment were tolerable and had positive impacts on survival.

Research efforts in the twenty-first century have been paramount to the 
discovery and development of novel pharmacological treatments in a variety of 
diseases resulting in improved life expectancy. Yet, cardiac disease remains a 
leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Over time, there has been an 
expansion in conditions such as atrial fibrillation (AF) and heart failure (HF). 
Although past research has elucidated specific pathways that participate in the 
development of distinct cardiac pathologies, the exact mechanisms of action 
leading to disease remain to be fully characterized. Protein turnover and 
cellular bioenergetics are integral components of cardiac diseases, highlighting 
the importance of mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in driving 
cellular homeostasis. More specifically, the interactions between mitochondria 
and ER are crucial to calcium signaling, apoptosis induction, autophagy, and 
lipid biosynthesis. Here, we summarize mitochondrial and ER functions and 
physical interactions in healthy physiological states. We then transition to 
perturbations that occur in response to pathophysiological challenges and how 
this alters mitochondrial-ER and other intracellular organelle interactions. 
Finally, we discuss lifestyle interventions and innovative therapeutic targets 
that may be used to restore beneficial mitochondrial and ER interactions, 
thereby improving cardiac function.

BACKGROUND: Coronary intramural haematoma (CIH) is an uncommon but potentially 
life-threatening complication during aortic root surgery (such as Bentall 
procedure). Depending on its extension it can lead to cardiogenic shock. 
Documented reports of this complication are lacking in literature.
CASE SUMMARY: In the report we present a case of CIH and its management and we 
show a stepwise imaging of the healing process that gives an insight of the fate 
of CIHs.
DISCUSSION: This case raises awareness of CIH as differential diagnosis for 
myocardial ischaemia during aortic root surgery. It underlines the effectiveness 
of immediate surgical revascularization, highlights the potential temporary role 
of coronary artery bypass graft that can stabilize the acute coronary syndrome 
and may give time to the CIH to reabsorb and native coronary circulation to 
re-establish.

Radical prostatectomy is a commonly adopted treatment for localized/locally 
advanced prostate cancer in men with a life expectancy of ten years or more. 
Robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) is comparable to open radical 
prostatectomy on cancer control and complication rates; however, new evidence 
suggests that RARP may have better functional outcomes, especially with respect 
to urinary incontinence and erectile dysfunction. Some of the surgical steps of 
RARP are not adequately described in published literature and, as such, may have 
an impact on the final outcomes of the procedure. We organized a Brazilian 
experts' panel to evaluate best practices in RARP. The confection of the 
recommendations broadly involved: selection of the experts; establishment of 
working groups; systematic review of the literature and elaboration of a 
questionnaire; and construction of the final text with the approval of all 
participants. The participants reviewed the publications in English from 
December 2019 to February 2020. A one-round Delphi technique was employed in 188 
questions. Five reviewers worked on the final recommendations using consensual 
and non-consensual questions. We found 59.9% of questions with greater than 70% 
agreement that were considered consensual. Non-consensual questions were 
reported according to the responses. The recommendations were based on 
evidence-based literature and individual perceptions adapted to the Brazilian 
reality, although some issues remain controversial. We believe that these 
recommendations may help urologists involved in RARP and hope that future 
discussions on this surgical procedure may evolve over the ensuing years.

BACKGROUND: Despite worldwide use of parenteral methotrexate (pMTX), health 
economic evidence for its use in Crohn's disease (CD) is limited. The low price 
of this generic drug has removed any commercial incentive to further invest in 
research. However, there is an unmet need for treatment of mild-to-moderate CD, 
since biological/targeted therapies are usually reserved for patients with more 
severe disease due to the higher costs of these treatments.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of pMTX compared to the standard 
of care (SOC, i.e., high doses of oral corticosteroids (hdCS) followed by 
gradual tapering) for the treatment of mild-to-moderate CD in the Czech 
Republic.
METHODS: We developed a 3-year Markov model with a 1-week cycle length 
comprising five health states. The model projected quality-adjusted life-years 
(QALYs) and costs from the healthcare payers' perspective. Efficacy data were 
obtained from a systematic literature review of clinical trials and extrapolated 
using survival analysis.
RESULTS: Over a 3-year time-horizon, pMTX yields additional 0.111 QALYs (1.798 
vs. 1.687) at an additional cost of €513 (€3087 vs. €2574), with an incremental 
deterministic (probabilistic) cost-effectiveness ratio of €4627 (€4742)/QALY, 
far below the willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold (≈ €47,000/QALY). The 
probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that the probability of pMTX being 
cost-effective was 100%. A one-way sensitivity and scenario analysis confirmed 
the robustness of the base-case result.
CONCLUSION: Parenteral MTX proved to be cost-effective in patients with 
mild-to-moderate CD. This is the first published cost-effectiveness analysis of 
pMTX for this indication. It also shows an example of a lack of valuation of 
generic therapy despite its cost-effectiveness and a clear benefit to the 
healthcare system.

Age-related variation in reproductive performance in long-lived iteroparous 
vertebrate species is common, with performance being influenced by 
within-individual processes, such as improvement and senescence, in combination 
with among-individual processes, such as selective appearance and disappearance. 
Few studies of age-related reproductive performance have compared the role of 
these drivers within a metapopulation, subject to varying degrees of resource 
competition. We accounted for within- and among-individual changes among 
known-aged Adélie penguins Pygoscelis adeliae during 17 years (1997-2013), at 
three clustered colonies of disparate size, to understand patterns in 
age-related reproductive success during early and late adulthood. Age at first 
reproduction (AFR) was lowest, and number of breeding attempts highest, at the 
largest colony. Regardless of AFR, success improved with early post-recruitment 
experience. For both oldest and youngest recruitment groups, peak performance 
occurred at the end of their reproductive life span indicating a possible cost 
of reproduction. Intermediate recruitment groups reached peak performance in 
their mid-reproductive life span and with intermediate breeding experience, 
before decreasing. Breeding success was lowest for the initial breeding attempt 
regardless of AFR, but we observed subsequent variation relative to recruitment 
age. Gaining experience by delaying recruitment positively influenced 
reproductive performance early in the reproductive life span and was most 
evident for the youngest breeders. Oldest recruits had the highest initial and 
peak breeding success. Differences in AFR resulted in trade-offs in reproductive 
life span or timing of senescence but not in the overall number of breeding 
attempts. Patterns differed as a function of colony size, and thus competition 
for resources. Early life improvement in performance at the larger colonies was 
primarily due to within-individual factors and at the largest colony, AFR. 
Regardless of colony size late-life performance was positively related to the 
age at last reproduction, indicating selective disappearance of lower performing 
individuals. These results highlight that different life-history strategies were 
equally successful, indicating that individuals can overcome potential 
trade-offs associated with early- and late-life performance. These results have 
important implications for understanding the evolution of life-history 
strategies responsible for driving population change.

BACKGROUND: The life expectancy of people with Down syndrome (DS) has 
significantly increased in the last decades. We describe the congenital 
malformations and main comorbidities of a cohort of children and young people 
with DS and analyse their differences according to age and gender groups.
METHODS: This retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted at DS centre of 
Bambino Gesù Children's Hospital in Rome (Italy). The period for reviewing all 
electronic health records ran from July 2016 to September 2017. We collected 
data on clinical conditions and compared them with the general paediatric 
population. Moreover, we compared the main comorbidities, dental diseases and 
body mass index data between age groups.
RESULTS: Seven hundred sixty-three children and young people with DS included in 
this study were aged 7.45 ± 5.49 years. Gender distribution included 58.19% male 
patients. The majority of our population (71.04%) came from central regions of 
Italy. Respiratory diseases (19%), congenital heart defects (72.23%), 
malocclusions (58.62%), astigmatism (20.31%), farsightedness (16.51%), 
near-sightedness (12.19%) and autoimmune hypothyroidism (3.28%) were more 
frequent in our population compared with the typical paediatric population. 
Upper respiratory tract infections and underweight were significantly more 
frequent in the youngest children, whereas dental diseases, refractive errors, 
obesity and autoimmune hypothyroidism increased over age.
CONCLUSIONS: Children and young people with DS present a high prevalence of 
potentially treatable medical conditions making multidisciplinary teams a 
mandatory need for this population.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical efficacy of micro-locking plate through 
vertical or parallel technique for treatment of Dubberley B-type capitellar 
fractures.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed in 24 patients (17 males and 
seven females, with an average age of 44.9 years, range from 19 to 75 years) 
with capitellar fractures that were treated with micro-locking plate using 
vertical or parallel technique between January 2016 to January 2019. The 
inclusion criteria include closed capitellar fracture, normal anterior elbow 
joint movement before injury, and recent capitellar fracture with injury within 
past 3 weeks. Fractures classified according to Dubberley included four cases of 
type IB, eight cases of type IIB, and 12 cases of type IIIB. Radiographic 
evaluation was performed. Surgery time, blood loss, range of motion of the 
elbow, forearm rotation, and complications were recorded. Elbow joint function 
was evaluated by Mayo Elbow Performance Score (MEPS).
RESULTS: The mean follow-up period was 19.6 months (range, 12-36 months). The 
average clinical healing time for fractures was 11.2 ± 3.2 weeks (range, 
8-20 weeks). Fracture united in all patients. Two patients showed slight delayed 
union, but union was achieved eventually. The mean time from injury to surgery 
was 6.3 ± 3.1 days (range, 2-15 days). The average surgical time was 
68.1 ± 11.5 min (range, 50-90 min), and the mean blood loss was 75.2 ± 26.5 mL 
(range, 40-120 mL). The mean range of flexion was 122.5° ± 10.5°(range, 
95°-140°). The mean range of extension was 8.5° ± 5.8°(range, 0°-20°). The mean 
range of pronation was 79.7° ± 8.0°(range, 65°-90°). The mean range of 
supination was 80.5° ± 7.1°(range, 60°-90°). The mean MEPS at final follow-up 
was 89.8 ± 9.0 (range, 60-100). Based on the MEPS, 18 (75%) patients had 
excellent, five (20.8%) patients had good, and one (4.2%) patient had fair. None 
of the 24 patients suffered vascular or nerve injury. One patient showed 
superficial infection, which was treated with surgical dressing.
CONCLUSIONS: The vertical or parallel technique of the micro-locking plate is an 
excellent method for treating Dubberley B-type capitellar fractures.

Secondary ocular malignancies most commonly spread to the choroid. Previously, 
the prognosis was poor however, with newer treatments including immunotherapy, 
patient's life expectancy have increased. It is therefore, important that 
ophthalmologists diagnose this condition in a timely manner and offer treatment 
to maximize visual potential and refer them on to oncology colleagues in order 
to optimize their systemic treatment for their primary cancer.

The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended catch-up 
9-valent Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination through age 26 years, and shared 
clinical decision-making for adults aged 27-45 years, compared with catch-up 
through age 26 years and 21 years for females and males, respectively (status 
quo; pre-June-2019 recommendations). This study assessed the public health 
impact and cost-effectiveness of expanded catch-up vaccination through age 
45 years (expanded catch-up) compared with status quo. We used an HPV dynamic 
transmission infection and disease model to assess disease outcomes and 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of expanded catch-up compared with 
status quo. Costs (2018 USD), calculated from a healthcare sector perspective, 
and quality-adjusted life years (QALY) were discounted at 3% annually. 
Historical vaccination coverage was estimated using NIS-TEEN survey data (NHANES 
data for sensitivity analysis). Alternative scenario analyses included 
restricting upper age of expanded catch-up through 26 years (June-2019 ACIP 
recommendation), 29 years, and further 5-year increments. Our results show 
expanded catch-up vaccination would prevent additional 37,856 cancers, 314,468 
cervical intraepithelial neoplasia-2/3s, 1,743,461 genital warts, and 10,698 
deaths compared with status quo over 100 years at cost of $141,000/QALY. With 
NHANES coverage, the ICER was $96,000/QALY. The June-2019 ACIP recommendation 
also provided public health benefits with an ICER of $117,000/QALY, compared 
with status quo. The ICER for expanded vaccination through age 34 years was 
$107,000/QALY. Expanding catch-up vaccination program through age 45 years-old 
in the US is expected to provide public health benefits, and cost-effectiveness 
improves with expanding catch-up through age 34.

Statin therapy for primary cardiovascular prevention in adults older than 75 
years.

Rasmussen P, Yandrapalli S, Aronow W.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a major contributor to morbidity and mortality 
worldwide. An abundance of research demonstrated that low‑density lipoprotein 
cholesterol (LDL‑C) is an important risk factor for CVD that can be modified 
with the drug class hydroxymethylglutaryl‑CoA reductase inhibitors, or 
statins.Statins have an unequivocal benefit in reducing CVD risk across age 
groups for secondary prevention. However, the benefit of these drugs for primary 
prevention in adults older than 75 years of age remains equivocal and 
controversial. The global population is aging rapidly and primary CVD prevention 
recommendations to guide statin therapy above the age of 75 years are necessary. 
However, current trends in statin therapy illustrate that it is underutilized 
for primary prevention in that age group. Concerns exist regarding the higher 
incidence of common adverse events from statin use in the older population; 
however, there are no confirmatory data regarding these associations. In the 
light of available evidence, it is reasonable to offer statin therapy for 
primary prevention to all older individuals following a shared decision‑making 
process that takes life expectancy, polypharmacy, frailty, and potential adverse 
effects into consideration. Combination therapies with other agents for the 
management of dyslipidemia should be considered to facilitate the use of 
tolerable doses of statins. Future investigations of dyslipidemia therapies must 
appropriately include this at‑risk population to identify optimal drugs and drug 
combinations that have a high benefit‑to ‑risk ratio for the prevention of CVD 
in the very old.

BACKGROUND: Population aging is now a universal trend. Many elderly persons can 
only conduct limited and short time walking because of age-related skeletal 
muscle decline of the lower limbs. The wearable device for walking assistance is 
beneficial to improve the life quality of the elderly.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to propose a soft exosuit for walking assistance of 
the elderly and verify its feasibility.
METHODS: The wearable structure and control strategy were presented. The 
performance of the soft exosuit was tested by force tracking evaluation and 
metabolic cost test.
RESULTS: The mean error of the measured and target peak force was 1.1%. The 
metabolic cost with assistance on while wearing the exosuit was reduced by 9.2% 
compared with that in locomotion assistance off. The reduction of assistance on 
was 7.1% compared with no exosuit.
CONCLUSIONS: The proposed soft exosuit has the potential to improve the walking 
efficiency of the elderly.

BACKGROUND: As life expectancy of people with Down syndrome (DS) increases, so 
does the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Identifying symptoms and tracking 
disease progression is especially challenging whenever levels of function vary 
before the onset of dementia. Goal Attainment Scaling (GAS), an individualized 
patient-reported outcome, can aid in monitoring disease progression and 
treatment effectiveness in adults with DS. Here, with clinical input, a 
validated dementia symptom menu was revised to facilitate GAS in adults living 
with Down Syndrome-associated Alzheimer's disease (DS-AD).
METHODS: Four clinicians with expertise in DS-AD and ten caregivers of adults 
living with DS-AD participated in semi-structured interviews to review the menu. 
Each participant reviewed 9-15 goal areas to assess their clarity and 
comprehensiveness. Responses were systematically and independently coded by two 
researchers as 'clear', 'modify', 'remove' or 'new'. Caregivers were encouraged 
to suggest additional items and recommend changes to clarify items.
RESULTS: Median caregiver age was 65 years (range 54-77). Most were female 
(9/10) with ≥15 years of education (10/10). Adults with DS-AD had a median age 
of 58 years (range 52-61) and either a formal diagnosis (6/10) or clinical 
suspicion (4/10) of dementia. The initial symptom menu consisted of 67 symptoms 
each with 2-12 descriptors (589 total). The clinicians' adaptation yielded 58 
symptoms each with 4-17 descriptors (580 total). Of these 580 descriptors, 
caregivers identified 37 (6%) as unclear; these were reworded, and one goal area 
(4 descriptors) was removed. A further 47 descriptors and one goal area were 
added to include caregiver-identified concepts. The final menu contained 58 goal 
areas, each with 7-17 descriptors (623 total).
CONCLUSIONS: A comprehensive symptom menu for adults living with DS-AD was 
developed to facilitate GAS. Incorporating expert clinician opinion and input 
from caregivers of adults with DS-AD identified meaningful items that 
incorporate patient/caregiver perspectives.

BACKGROUND: Osteoarthritis (OA) represents a significant burden to societies, as 
it affects quality of life and performance and implies a large cost in terms of 
health care. Autologous platelets are a regenerative treatment modality for OA 
that are thought to be a potential stimulation of the natural healing cascade.
PURPOSE: To describe the effect of the platelet concentrate V-PET in the 
management of OA in a naturally occurring canine model, using several outcome 
assessment modalities.
STUDY DESIGN: Controlled laboratory study.
METHODS: A total of 40 joints of active working police dogs with hip OA were 
randomly assigned to a control group (CG) and a platelet concentrate group (PCG; 
treatment) and evaluated. At treatment day (T0) and 8, 15, 30, 90, and 180 days 
after treatment, weight distribution, joint range of motion at flexion and 
extension, thigh girth, digital thermography, radiographic signs, 4 clinical 
metrology instruments, and synovial fluid interleukin 1 and C-reactive protein 
levels were recorded. Results were compared using repeated-measures analysis of 
variance with a Huynh-Feldt correction, paired-samples t test, or Wilcoxon 
signed rank test, with P < .05.
RESULTS: Dogs were 6.5 ± 2.4 years old (mean ± SD) and had a body weight of 26.7 
± 5.2 kg. At T0, 32 (80%) joints were graded as having mild OA, 6 (15%) as 
moderate, and 2 (5%) as severe. No differences were found between groups at T0. 
Between the PCG and CG, the symmetry index showed significant improvements in 
the PCG from 8 days (P = .01) to 180 days (P = .01). Joint flexion also improved 
in the PCG up to 90 days (P < .05) and extension improved up to 180 days (P < 
.01). Several clinical metrology instrument scores also improved up to 90 to 180 
days after treatment. In the CG, radiographic signs progressed, while the PCG
