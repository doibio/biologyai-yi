group of young people with PAH have regarding having children. Seven 
participants (five females and two males) currently or previously in an intimate 
relationship, aged 18-23 years, two of whom were parents, were recruited from a 
UK hospital clinic. They were interviewed using a semi-structured interview, 
with data analysed according to the principles of Interpretative 
Phenomenological Analysis. Four main themes were elicited: the perceived impact 
of having a child on intimate relationships, the effect of normative beliefs on 
parenting intentions and expectations, the thoughts and feelings about 
disclosing parental HIV status to one's children in the future, and the 
perceived impact of HIV on procreational intentions. Implications for supporting 
young people with PAH in parenting decision-making are explored.

Microvascular free-flap transfer for head and neck reconstruction in elderly 
patients.

Turrà F, La Padula S, Razzano S, Bonavolontà P, Nele G, Marlino S, Canta L, 
Graziano P, Dell'Aversana Orabona G, Schonauer F.

BACKGROUND: With the increase in life expectancy, the incidence of head and neck 
cancer has grown in the elderly population. Free tissue transfer has become the 
first choice, among all the reconstructive techniques, in these cases. The 
safety and success of micro vascular transfer have been well documented in the 
general population, but its positive results achieved in elderly patients have 
received less attention.
METHODS: We retrospectively studied 28 patients over the age of 60 years. The 
aim of this paper was to study the success rate of free tissue transfer and 
investigate the complication incidence in this patient population.
RESULTS: Twenty-eight free flaps were performed to reconstruct medium to large 
cervico-facial surgical defects in six years. No difference was noted between 
success and complication rates observed between general and elderly population.
CONCLUSION: This study indicates that free-flap technique for head and neck 
reconstruction could be considered a safe option in elderly patients when a good 
pre-operative general status is present.

The epidemiology of cardiovascular diseases in sub-Saharan Africa is unique 
among world regions, with about half of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) due to 
causes other than atherosclerosis. CVD epidemiology data are sparse and of 
uneven quality in sub-Saharan Africa. Using the available data, the Global 
Burden of Diseases, Risk Factors, and Injuries (GBD) 2010 Study estimated CVD 
mortality and burden of disease in sub-Saharan Africa in 1990 and 2010. The 
leading CVD cause of death and disability in 2010 in sub-Saharan Africa was 
stroke; the largest relative increases in CVD burden between 1990 and 2010 were 
in atrial fibrillation and peripheral arterial disease. CVD deaths constituted 
only 8.8% of all deaths and 3.5% of all disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) 
in sub-Sahara Africa, less than a quarter of the proportion of deaths and burden 
attributed to CVD in high income regions. However, CVD deaths in sub-Saharan 
Africa occur at younger ages on average than in the rest of the world. It 
remains uncertain if increased urbanization and life expectancy in some parts of 
sub-Saharan African nations will transition the region to higher CVD burden in 
future years.

The Global Burden of Disease Study 2010 does not show a rise in the 
age-standardized mortality rate for cardiovascular disease in sub-Saharan 
Africa.

High-quality information on the distribution of disease, disability, and death 
should be available to all governments tasked with making decision regarding the 
judicious use of limited resources. GBD 2010 was a systematic effort to quantify 
disease and disability by age and sex in 187 countries from 1990 to 2010, 
including all the countries of sub-Saharan Africa. The study adopted the 
perspective that all available epidemiological information should be used and 
adjusted for known limitations, an approach that is particularly important for 
Africa. Despite Cooper and Bovet's concern that studies like GBD 2010 report a 
"tsunami of cardiovascular disease" in sub-Saharan Africa, GBD showed a trend 
toward a decline in age-standardized rates of death due to cardiovascular 
disease in sub-Saharan Africa but confidence intervals were broad, reflecting 
the limited available data. Scientific efforts should work toward making 
measures of bias and uncertainty more rigorous and transparent in reporting 
measures of public health.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Transferring the results from clinical trials on type 2 
diabetes prevention is the objective of the Diabetes in Europe-Prevention using 
Lifestyle, Physical Activity and Nutritional intervention (DE-PLAN) project in 
Catalonia, whose cost-effectiveness analysis is now presented.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A prospective cohort study was performed in primary care 
involving individuals without diagnosed diabetes aged 45-75 years (n=2054) 
screened using the questionnaire Finnish Diabetes Risk Score (FINDRISC) and a 
subsequent oral glucose tolerance test. Where feasible, high-risk individuals 
who were identified (n=552) were allocated sequentially to standard care 
(n=219), a group-based (n=230) or an individual-level (n=103) intensive 
(structured programme of six hours using specific teaching techniques) lifestyle 
intervention (n=333). The primary outcome was the development of diabetes (WHO). 
We evaluated the cost of resources used with comparison of standard care and the 
intervention groups in terms of effectiveness and quality of life (15D 
questionnaire).
RESULTS: After 4.2-year median follow-up, the cumulative incidences were 18.3% 
(14.3-22.9%) in the intensive intervention group and 28.8% (22.9-35.3%) in the 
standard care group (36.5% relative-risk-reduction). The corresponding 4-year HR 
was 0.64 (0.47-0.87; P<.004). The incremental cost induced by intensive 
intervention compared with the standard was 106€ per participant in the 
individual level and 10€ in the group-based intervention representing 746€ and 
108€ per averted case of diabetes, respectively. The estimated incremental 
cost-utility ratio was 3243€ per quality-adjusted life-years gained.
CONCLUSION: The intensive lifestyle intervention delayed the development of 
diabetes and was efficient in economic analysis.

Prognostic factors in elderly patients with breast cancer.

Cappellani A, Di Vita M, Zanghì A, Cavallaro A, Piccolo G, Majorana M, Barbera 
G, Berretta M.

BACKGROUND: Breast cancer (BC) remains principally a disease of old ages; with 
35-50% of cases occurring in women older than 65 years. Even mortality for 
cancer increases with aging: 19.7% between 65 and 74 years; 22.6% between 75 and 
84 years; and 15.1% in 85 years or more.
METHODS: A search was performed on Medline, Embase, Scopus using the following 
Key words: Breast cancer, Breast neoplasms, Aged, Elder, Elderly, Eldest, Older, 
Survival analysis, Prognosis, Prognostic factors, Tumor markers, Biomarkers, 
Comorbidity, Geriatric assessment, Axilla, Axillary surgery. 3029 studies have 
been retrieved. Paper in which overall or disease free survival were not end 
points, or age class was not well defined, or the sample was too small, were 
excluded. At last 42 papers fulfilled the criteria.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Lack of screening and delay in diagnosis may be 
responsible for the minor improvement in survival observed in elderly respect to 
younger breast cancer patients. Predictive factors are the same and must be 
assessed with the same attention reserved to younger women.
CONCLUSIONS: Most of elderly patient are fit to undergo standard treatment and 
can get the same benefits of younger women. Nevertheless it is possible that 
some older women with early breast cancer can be spared too aggressive 
treatments. Geriatric assessment and co-morbidities can affect the prognosis 
modifying surveillance, life expectancy and compliance to therapies. They can 
thus be useful to select the better treatment, either surgical or radio or 
hormone - or chemo-therapy.

Cerebral palsy.

The syndrome of cerebral palsy encompasses a large group of childhood movement 
and posture disorders. Severity, patterns of motor involvement, and associated 
impairments such as those of communication, intellectual ability, and epilepsy 
vary widely. Overall prevalence has remained stable in the past 40 years at 
2-3·5 cases per 1000 livebirths, despite changes in antenatal and perinatal 
care. The few studies available from developing countries suggest prevalence of 
comparable magnitude. Cerebral palsy is a lifelong disorder; approaches to 
intervention, whether at an individual or environmental level, should recognise 
that quality of life and social participation throughout life are what 
individuals with cerebral palsy seek, not improved physical function for its own 
sake. In the past few years, the cerebral palsy community has learned that the 
evidence of benefit for the numerous drugs, surgery, and therapies used over 
previous decades is weak. Improved understanding of the role of multiple 
gestation in pathogenesis, of gene environment interaction, and how to influence 
brain plasticity could yield significant advances in treatment of the disorder. 
Reduction in the prevalence of post-neonatal cerebral palsy, especially in 
developing countries, should be possible through improved nutrition, infection 
control, and accident prevention.

BACKGROUND: Zinc status has been previously documented in cystic fibrosis (CF) 
infants, children and adolescents. However, despite the increasing life 
expectancy observed in CF populations, data regarding zinc status of CF adults 
are surprisingly lacking. The objectives of this study were to (1) characterize 
zinc status and (2) explore associations between zinc status and clinical 
outcomes of CF adult patients.
METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed for patients who had their 
plasma zinc measured between 2009 and 2012. Data included demographics, clinical 
characteristics, biochemical parameters and co-morbid conditions.
RESULTS: A total of 304 CF patients were included in the study. These patients 
displayed a good nutritional status (mean BMI±SD: 22.7±3.5) and moderate lung 
disease (mean FEV1±SD: 66.3±22.2). Low plasma zinc concentration (<9.2μmol/L) 
was found in 68 out of 304 CF patients (22.4%). Compared to patients with normal 
zinc, those with low zinc had significantly lower forced vital capacity and 
forced expiratory volume in one second. 72% of CF adults with low zinc suffered 
from bone disease (vs 49% with normal zinc, p=0.037) and 79% had impaired 
glycemic status (vs 58%, p=0.016). Accordingly, negative correlations were found 
between plasma zinc and glucose (r=-0.139, p=0.0001), HbA1c (r=-0.237, p=0.0001) 
and fructosamine (r=-0.134, p=0.034). In multiple linear regression, albumin and 
glycemic status were significant predictors of plasma zinc.
CONCLUSION: Our data indicated that nearly one quarter of CF adults with good 
nutritional status and moderate lung disease had low plasma zinc concentration 
and that low zinc status was associated with worse clinical outcomes.

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a debilitating condition with life 
expectancy of two to five years from diagnosis. Treatment strategies for IPF are 
disappointingly limited and pirfenidone is currently the only licensed drug that 
has been shown to reduce the decline in forced vital capacity (FVC) at six 
months. We demonstrate our experience in prescribing pirfenidone in a single 
centre observational study of forty patients involved in a named patient 
programme (NPP) from September 2011 to January 2013. We demonstrate that 
improved adherence and compliance can be achieved by specialist nurse and 
clinician review, support and education of the patient. Twenty three of 40 (58%) 
patients experienced predominantly gastrointestinal adverse effects. Importantly 
we have enhanced patient adherence and compliance from an initial 
discontinuation rate of six patients (15%) at the beginning of the study to a 
zero discontinuation rate in the subsequent ten months. This study shows that in 
the real world pirfenidone is well tolerated and with expert regular specialist 
review adherence can be optimised and improved.

CONTEXT: Pressure ulcers are the most prevalent wounds affecting patients with 
advanced illness. Although complete wound healing is the most desired outcome, 
it remains unlikely in the setting of patients with limited life expectancy. 
Realistic goal setting may be enabled using objective clinical parameters.
OBJECTIVES: To identify clinical parameters associated with complete healing of 
Stage II pressure ulcers.
METHODS: Univariable and multivariable competing risk analyses were used to 
assess the association of complete healing with the following six clinical 
parameters, namely gender, age, total number of pressure ulcers, total number of 
other wounds, number of failing organ systems, and Palliative Performance Scale 
(PPS) scores.
RESULTS: A total of 147 patients with 245 Stage II pressure ulcers were followed 
until death; 9.4% of Stage II pressure ulcers achieved complete healing. 
Univariable analyses showed hazard ratios (HRs) for complete healing in favor of 
higher levels of PPS scores (HR 1.82-5.99, P<0.001) and age younger than 80 
years (HR 3.28, P=0.031). Multivariable analyses showed HRs for complete healing 
in favor of higher levels of PPS scores (HR 1.49-3.34, P=0.003).
CONCLUSION: Higher levels of PPS scores are associated with complete healing of 
Stage II pressure ulcers in patients with advanced illness.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Hepatitis C (HCV) is a common cause of chronic liver disease 
worldwide. Current standard treatment for genotype-1 patients uses a triple 
combination of pegylated-interferon alpha (IFN), ribavirin (RBV) and a 
direct-acting antiviral agent (DAA) with 75-80% sustained virologic response 
(SVR) rates. The aim is to determine cost-effectiveness of staging-guided vs. 
treat all HCV genotype-1 patients with interferon-based vs. interferon-free 
regimens.
METHODS: A decision analytic Markov model simulating patients until death 
compared four strategies for treating HCV genotype-1: Triple therapy (IFN, RBV, 
DAA) with staging-guidance or treat all, and oral IFN-free regimen with 
staging-guidance or treat all. Strategies with staging initiated treatment at 
fibrosis stages F2-F4, with staging repeated every 5 years until age 70. The 
reference case was a treatment-naïve 50-year-old. Analysis was repeated for 50% 
increase in cost of oral therapy. Effectiveness was measured in quality-adjusted 
life years (QALYs).
RESULTS: Treatment of all patients with oral IFN-free regimen was the most 
cost-effective strategy, with an ICER of $15,709/QALY at baseline cost of oral 
therapy. The ICER remained below $50,000/QALY in sensitivity analyses for 
baseline and +50% cost of oral therapy scenarios. The treat all strategy was 
also the most effective strategy; associated with the lowest risk of developing 
advanced liver disease.
CONCLUSIONS: Treating all HCV patients with oral IFN-free regimen reduced the 
number of patients developing advanced liver disease and increased life 
expectancy. Additionally, IFN-free regimen without staging may be the most 
cost-effective approach for treating HCV genotype-1 patients. The efficacy and 
safety of these regimens must be confirmed using randomized clinical trials.

Assessing the cost effectiveness of pre-exposure prophylaxis for HIV prevention 
in the US.

About 50,000 people are infected with HIV in the US each year and this number 
has remained virtually the same for the past decade. Yet, in the last few years, 
evidence from several multinational randomized clinical trials has shown that 
the provision of antiretroviral drug to uninfected persons (i.e. pre-exposure 
prophylaxis) reduces the incidence of HIV by about 50 %. However, evidence from 
cost-effectiveness studies conducted in the US yield widely varying estimates of 
the cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained, and this variation 
reflects the substantial uncertainty surrounding the determinants of HIV 
transmission (e.g. adherence rates to prophylactic medications, the average 
number of sexual partners, the number and types of sexual acts, the viral load 
of infected partners, and the proportion of contacts where condoms are used), as 
well as different approaches to translating a reduction in HIV cases into an 
estimate of the increase in the number of QALYs.

histories are integrated into these estimates. Future distributions of body mass 
indices are projected using transition matrices applied to the initial 
distribution in 2010. In addition to projections of current obesity, we project 
distributions of obesity when cohorts are age 25. To these distributions, we 
apply death rates by current and age-25 obesity status observed in the National 
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 1988-2006. Estimates of the effects of 
smoking changes are based on observed relations between cohort smoking patterns 
and cohort death rates from lung cancer. We find that changes in both smoking 
and obesity are expected to have large effects on U.S. mortality. For males, the 
reductions in smoking have larger effects than the rise in obesity throughout 
the projection period. By 2040, male life expectancy at age 40 is expected to 
have gained 0.83 years from the combined effects. Among women, however, the two 
sets of effects largely offset one another throughout the projection period, 
with a small gain of 0.09 years expected by 2040.

for a stratified approach to surveillance colonoscopy.

Kingdom.

BACKGROUND: The incidence of metachronous cancer will become an important 
clinical consideration as the life expectancy of the population increases and as 
rates of curative resection improve.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the pattern of metachronous cancer development following 
curative resection of colorectal cancer in an unselected patient population 
offered postoperative colonoscopic surveillance.
METHOD: Prospective clinical follow-up after curative colorectal cancer 
resection and surveillance colonoscopy with or without polypectomy in accordance 
with the national guidelines. Actuarial analysis and competing risk analysis 
were performed to account for death and recurrence and to stratify for age, 
gender, stage, and tumor site.
RESULTS: Five hundred thirty-eight patients with median follow-up 4 years 2 
month (0-16) years. Fifteen patients (3%) developed metachronous cancer, at a 
median time interval of 90 months from primary resection. Thirteen metachronous 
cancer patients (87%, 13/15) underwent one to five surveillance colonoscopies: 
nine patients were asymptomatic at time of diagnosis of metachronous cancer. 
Competing risks analysis suggests that the adjusted cumulative incidence in 
males aged 55 is 4% at 10 years compared with 1% in females aged 85 years old.
CONCLUSIONS: A patient aged under 65 at the time of the primary curative 
resection carries a 2% 5-year risk of metachronous cancer, implying that 3 year 
surveillance colonoscopy is justified. Whereas patients aged over 75 carry less 
than a 2% 10-year risk, implying that it is seldom warranted to repeat the 
colonoscopy more frequently than every 5 years. A stratified approach to the 
frequency of surveillance colonoscopy requires further consideration.

Healing homophobia: Volunteerism and "sacredness" in AIDS.

Kayal PM(1).

Author information:
(1)Department of Sociology at Seton Hall University in South Orange, New Jersey.

That it is impossible to understand the societal response to AIDS, if not the 
very occurrence of the disease itself, independently of "religiously sustained" 
homophobia is the starting point and premise of this article. Unlike the 
reaction of the gay community, the institutional reply of the broader society, 
especially in the health care industry, has been less than optimal. After 
overcoming its own internalized and learned sense of shame, guilt, and sin, the 
gay community in New York was able to organize the most successful support 
system for People with AIDS nationwide. Through "bearing witness" to PWAs at the 
Gay Men's Health Crisis, Inc., an AIDS-specific social service agency, gay 
volunteers were brought into direct face-to-face contact with "the other," and, 
therefore, with themselves. This reconciliation and acceptance (healing) made 
AIDS volunteerism a political event because the sacred was rediscovered in the 
community as an extension of the self. The power of established religions to 
define and control gay life was thus ended by the shift of self-adjudication 
from institutional approval to self-acceptance. This is why volunteerism heals 
homophobia in AIDS and is radical political and religious activity, and not mere 
charity or altruism.

The relationship between active ageing and health using longitudinal data from 
Denmark, France, Italy and England.

and Public Policy, King's College London, , London, UK.

BACKGROUND: 'Active ageing' has been promoted as a strategy for extending 
quality of life and healthy life expectancy. However, there is limited evidence 
from nationally representative longitudinal studies on whether engagement among 
older adults is associated with better outcomes and few studies have considered 
possible bias arising from differential study attrition.
METHODS: We investigate associations between the engagement of people aged 50-69 
in three types of activity with self-rated health and depression 2 years later 
using nationally representative longitudinal data from four European countries 
(Denmark, France, Italy and England). Data were drawn from waves 1 and 2 of the 
Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe and the English Longitudinal 
Study of Ageing. Multivariable analysis was used to analyse associations between 
baseline activity and outcomes at follow-up controlling for socioeconomic, 
demographic and health-related variables at baseline. Multiple imputation 
techniques and sensitivity analyses were undertaken to investigate possible bias 
arising from sample attrition.
RESULTS: Respondents in paid work at baseline were less likely to be depressed 
or to report poor or fair health at follow-up than those who were 'inactive', 
although not in Italy. Engagement in formal and informal activities was not 
significantly associated with health at follow-up. Sensitivity analyses showed 
that assuming that those in bad health were over-represented among study 
attritors weakened the association between work at baseline and health at 
follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: Engagement in paid work may help maintain health in later life, 
although mechanisms and contextual influences need further investigation.

Global disease burden of conditions requiring emergency surgery.

Comment in
    Br J Surg. 2014 Jan;101(1):e23.

BACKGROUND: Surgical disease is inadequately addressed globally, and emergency 
conditions requiring surgery contribute substantially to the global disease 
burden.
METHODS: This was a review of studies that contributed to define the 
population-based health burden of emergency surgical conditions (excluding 
trauma and obstetrics) and the status of available capacity to address this 
burden. Further data were retrieved from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010 
and the University of Washington's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation 
online data.
RESULTS: In the index year of 2010, there were 896,000 deaths, 20 million years 
of life lost and 25 million disability-adjusted life-years from 11 emergency 
general surgical conditions reported individually in the Global Burden of 
Disease Study. The most common cause of death was complicated peptic ulcer 
disease, followed by aortic aneurysm, bowel obstruction, biliary disease, 
mesenteric ischaemia, peripheral vascular disease, abscess and soft tissue 
infections, and appendicitis. The mortality rate was higher in high-income 
countries (HICs) than in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) (24.3 versus 
10.6 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants respectively), primarily owing to a higher 
rate of vascular disease in HICs. However, because of the much larger 
population, 70 per cent of deaths occurred in LMICs. Deaths from vascular 
disease rose from 15 to 25 per cent of surgical emergency-related deaths in 
LMICs (from 1990 to 2010). Surgical capacity to address this burden is 
suboptimal in LMICs, with fewer than one operating theatre per 100,000 
inhabitants in many LMICs, whereas some HICs have more than 14 per 100,000 
inhabitants.
CONCLUSION: The global burden of surgical emergencies is described 
insufficiently. The bare estimates indicate a tremendous health burden. LMICs 
carry the majority of emergency conditions; in these countries the pattern of 
surgical disease is changing and capacity to deal with the problem is 
inadequate. The data presented in this study will be useful for both the 
surgical and public health communities to plan a more adequate response.

Damage control surgery for abdominal emergencies.

Weber DG(1), Bendinelli C, Balogh ZJ.

Author information:
(1)Department of Traumatology, John Hunter Hospital and University of Newcastle, 
Newcastle, New South Wales, Australia.

BACKGROUND: Damage control surgery is a management sequence initiated to reduce 
the risk of death in severely injured patients presenting with physiological 
derangement. Damage control principles have emerged as an approach in non-trauma 
abdominal emergencies in order to reduce mortality compared with primary 
definitive surgery.
METHODS: A PubMed/MEDLINE literature review was conducted of data available over 
the past decade (up to August 2013) to gain information on current understanding 
of damage control surgery for abdominal surgical emergencies. Future directions 
for research are discussed.
RESULTS: Damage control surgery facilitates a strategy for life-saving 
intervention for critically ill patients by abbreviated laparotomy with 
subsequent reoperation for delayed definitive repair after physiological 
resuscitation. The six-phase strategy (including damage control resuscitation in 
phase 0) is similar to that for severely injured patients, although non-trauma 
indications include shock from uncontrolled haemorrhage or sepsis. Minimal 
evidence exists to validate the benefit of damage control surgery in general 
surgical abdominal emergencies. The collective published experience over the 
past decade is limited to 16 studies including a total of 455 (range 3-99) 
patients, of which the majority are retrospective case series. However, the 
concept has widespread acceptance by emergency surgeons, and appears a logical 
extension from pathophysiological principles in trauma to haemorrhage and 
sepsis. The benefits of this strategy depend on careful patient selection. 
Damage control surgery has been performed for a wide range of indications, but 
most frequently for uncontrolled bleeding during elective surgery, haemorrhage 
from complicated gastroduodenal ulcer disease, generalized peritonitis, acute 
mesenteric ischaemia and other sources of intra-abdominal sepsis.
CONCLUSION: Damage control surgery is employed in a wide range of abdominal 
emergencies and is an increasingly recognized life-saving tactic in emergency 
surgery performed on physiologically deranged patients.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and corticosteroid 
use in patients with moderate to severely active SLE enrolled in two 
international, multicentre, randomized controlled trials of epratuzumab 
(ALLEVIATE-1 and -2) and a long-term extension study (SL0006).
METHODS: Ninety ALLEVIATE patients (43% BILAG A, mean BILAG score 13.2) were 
randomized to receive 360 mg/m(2) (n = 42) or 720 mg/m(2) (n = 11) epratuzumab 
or placebo (n = 37), plus standard of care, in 12-week cycles. Corticosteroid 
use, patient and physician global assessments of disease activity (PtGA and PGA) 
and 36-item Medical Outcomes Survey Short Form (SF-36) results were recorded at 
baseline and every 4 weeks. Both trials were prematurely discontinued due to a 
drug supply interruption; patients followed for ≥6 months were analysed. 
Twenty-nine patients continued in SL0006, with interim analysis at a median 
exposure of 120 (range 13-184) weeks.
RESULTS: At week 12, proportions of patients with a PGA ≥20% above baseline or 
with a PtGA improvement greater than or equal to the minimum clinically 
important difference were higher in the epratuzumab arms than the placebo arm. 
PGA and PtGA improvements were sustained but did not reach statistical 
significance. At week 24, mean cumulative corticosteroid doses with epratuzumab 
360 and 720 mg/m(2) were 1051 and 1973 mg less than placebo (P = 0.034 and 
0.081, respectively). At week 48, SF-36 scores approached or exceeded US age- 
and gender-matched norms in five domains with the 360 mg/m(2) treatment. 
Improvements were maintained in SL0006 over ∼2 years.
CONCLUSION: Epratuzumab treatment produced clinically meaningful and sustained 
improvements in PGA, PtGA and HRQOL and reductions in corticosteroid doses.

a.arber@surrey.ac.uk

Malignant pleural effusion (MPE) is a distressing condition for the patient, 
causing many symptoms such as shortness of breath, dry cough, an uncomfortable 
feeling of heaviness in the chest, and pleuritic pain. MPE reduces quality of 
life and functional status. It indicates that the disease is now advanced and 
life expectancy is generally short, with a median prognosis of 3-12 months 
depending on the stage of the disease and the underlying malignancy. This paper 
discusses the palliative treatment options for MPE, which include thoracentesis, 
medical pleurodesis, and indwelling pleural catheter. It is important that 
decisions about treatment are made within the multidisciplinary team and 
alongside the patient and family. Treatment goals are concerned with the relief 
or elimination of dyspnoea, restoration of near-normal activity and function, 
and avoidance of inpatient care.

OBJECTIVES: The main objective of the study is to identify changes that occur in 
lung function in patients with pulmonary TB. The secondary objective is to 
determine the characteristics of bronchial obstruction associated with pulmonary 
TB.
METHODS: There were included in the study patients with pulmonary TB diagnosed 
in Bacau Pneumology Hospital between January 2011 and March 2012. Data was 
collected on gender, age, origin, education, occupation, smoking, and TB case 
category. Expansion of lung lesions was assessed on chest radiographs. Lung 
function was measured by spirometry and bronchodilatator test.
RESULTS: The study group included 84 patients with a mean age of 44.9 years, 
predominantly male (86.9%6) and rural (61.9%). Investigation revealed that 
smoking status was 23.81% nonsmoking, 22.62% former smokers and 53.57% smokers. 
64.29% of patients were new cases of pulmonary TB, 15.47% relapse and 20.24% 
patients with chronic pulmonary TB. Assessment of ventilatory function found 
58.33% of patients with respiratory defects. These were mainly restrictive 
(33.33%), mixed (17.86%) and obstructive (7.14%). Obstructive and mixed 
ventilatory defects are significantly associated with age over 40 years (chi2 = 
4.70, r = 0.419, p = 0.036, 95% CI), male gender (chi2 = 8.14, r = 0.688, p = 
0.027, 95% CI), smoking (chi2 = 11.251, r = 0.758, p = 0.032, 95% CI), category 
of chronic case of TB (chi2 = 11.25, r = 0.475, p = 0.0008, 95% CI) and 
radiological lung lesions extension (chi2 = 8.128, r = 0.658, p = 0.01293, 95% 
CI).
CONCLUSIONS: Pulmonary TB is often associated wit significant functional 
changes, present since the early stages of the disease and which are often 
ignored. Early detection and proper treatment of TB could contribute to reducing 
the incidence of ventilatory defects associated with TB, and their rapid 
detection would allow better monitoring and thus improved quality of life of 
these patients. Extensive, multicenter, longitudinal studies are necessary to 
investigate and deepen knowledge of the functional consequences of tuberculosis.

Physical health inequities in people with severe mental illness: identifying 
initiatives for practice change.

Cunningham C(1), Peters K, Mannix J.

Author information:
(1)Thomas Embling Hospital, Melbourne, Australia.

People with severe mental illness have a higher prevalence of co-morbid physical 
diseases and a significantly reduced life expectancy when compared with people 
in the general population. This article explores the literature published 
between 2002 and 2012 in order to identify causes of poor physical health in 
those with severe mental illness and discusses interventions that may be 
implemented to enhance health outcomes for this group. The causes of poor 
physical health in those with severe mental illness are difficult to address. 
However, existing literature does identify some interventions that can 
potentially provide the basis for practice change.

Pharmacoeconomics of depot antipsychotics for treating chronic schizophrenia in 
Sweden.

Einarson TR, Vicente C, Zilbershtein R, Piwko C, Bø CN, Pudas H, Jensen R, 
Hemels ME.

AIMS: To determine the cost-effectiveness of long-acting injectable (LAI) 
antipsychotics for chronic schizophrenia in Sweden.
METHODS: A 1-year decision tree was developed for Sweden using published data 
and expert opinion. Five treatment strategies lasting 1 year were compared: 
paliperidone palmitate (PP-LAI), olanzapine pamoate (OLZ-LAI), risperidone 
(RIS-LAI), haloperidol decanoate (HAL-LAI) and olanzapine tablets (oral-OLZ). 
Patients intolerant/failing drugs switched to another depot; subsequent failures 
received clozapine. Resources and employment time lost (indirect costs) were 
costed in 2011 Swedish kroner (SEK), from standard government lists. The model 
calculated the average cost/patient and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), 
which were combined into incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. Multivariate and 
1-way sensitivity analyses tested model stability.
RESULTS: PP-LAI followed by OLZ-LAI had the lowest cost/patient (189,696 SEK) 
and highest QALYs (0.817), dominating in the base case. OLZ-LAI followed by 
PP-LAI cost 229,775 SEK (0.812 QALY), RIS-LAI followed by HAL-LAI cost 221,062 
SEK (0.804 QALY), HAL-LAI followed by oral-OLZ cost 243,411 SEK (0.776 QALY), 
and oral-OLZ followed by HAL-LAI cost 249,422 SEK (0.773 QALY). The greatest 
proportions of costs (52.5-83.8%) were for institutional care; indirect costs 
were minor (2.4-3.8%). RESULTS were sensitive to adherence and hospitalization 
rates, but not drug cost. PP-LAI followed by OLZ-LAI dominated OLZ-LAI followed 
by PP-LAI in 59.4% of simulations, RIS-LAI followed by HAL-LAI in 65.8%, HAL-LAI 
followed by oral-OLZ in 94.0% and oral-OLZ followed by HAL-LAI in 95.9%; PP-LAI 
followed by OLZ-LAI was dominated in 1.1% of the 40,000 iterations.
CONCLUSION: PP-LAI followed by OLZ-LAI was cost-effective in Sweden for chronic 
schizophrenia and cost-saving overall to the healthcare system.

Research Centre, Liverpool, UK. Electronic address: J.K.Field@liv.ac.uk.

Implementation of lung cancer CT screening is currently the subject of a major 
policy decision within the USA. Findings of the US National Lung Screening Trial 
showed a 20% reduction in lung cancer mortality and a 6·7% decrease in all-cause 
mortality; subsequently, five US professional and clinical organisations and the 
US Preventive Services Task Force recommended that screening should be 
implemented. Should national health services in Europe follow suit? The European 
community awaits mortality and cost-effectiveness data from the NELSON trial in 
2015-16 and pooled findings of European trials. In the intervening years, a 
recommendation is proposed that a demonstration trial is done in the UK. In this 
Review, we summarise the existing evidence and identify questions that remain to 
be answered before the implementation of international lung cancer screening 
programmes.

HIV protease inhibitors and onset of cardiovascular diseases: a central role for 
oxidative stress and dysregulation of the ubiquitin-proteasome system.

The successful roll-out of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has 
extended life expectancy and enhanced the overall well-being of HIV-positive 
individuals. There are, however, increased concerns regarding HAART-mediated 
metabolic derangements and its potential risk for cardiovascular diseases (CVD) 
in the long-term. Here certain classes of antiretroviral drugs such as the HIV 
protease inhibitors (PIs) are strongly implicated in this process. This article 
largely focuses on the direct PI-linked development of cardio-metabolic 
complications, and reviews the inter-linked roles of oxidative stress and the 
ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) as key mediators driving this process. It is 
proposed that PIs trigger reactive oxygen species (ROS) production that leads to 
serious downstream consequences such as cell death, impaired mitochondrial 
function, and UPS dysregulation. Moreover, we advocate that HIV PIs may also 
directly lower myocardial UPS function. The attenuation of cardiac UPS can
