clinical impact is increasing in parallel with the increase of life expectancy 
due to modern safe replacement treatments and the improvement of comprehensive 
care of these patients. No rigorous trial concerning treatment of ischemic 
coronary disease is currently available, and such studies are probably not 
feasible in this setting. Given the lack of evidence-based guidelines, the 
analysis of case reports describing management of coronary artery disease and 
cardiac surgery in hemophilic patients suggests that treatment strategies should 
be similar to those used in nonhemophilic subjects, provided that an adequate 
concentrate replacement is administered. On the whole, treatment should be 
tailored for balancing the actual thrombotic risk and the preexisting bleeding 
tendency, enhanced by the use of antithrombotic agents. In this review, the 
available information is discussed, together with the recent suggestions of 
experts developed to provide more uniform approaches and collection of data. 
Treatment of cardiovascular disease reflects the evolving scenario in which 
clinicians who treat hemophilia will have to extend their interactions with 
other specialists to confront the new challenges of the comprehensive care of 
aging hemophilic patients.

[Simulation of the distribution of spinocerebellar ataxia type I in Yakut 
populations: description of the model].

[Article in Russian]

Koneva LA, Konev AV, Kucher AN.

A simulation model has been developed for predicting the distribution of 
trinucleotide repeat expansion diseases in human populations. The interface of 
the software used to run this model presents the options for simulating natural 
reproduction of a population, with the population demographic parameters taken 
into account, and for simulating the appearance of a dynamic mutation in 
populations, transmission of the mutant gene from parents to offspring, and the 
effect of the phenotypic expression of the disease (the patients' life 
expectancy and birthrate) on the transmission of the mutant allele in the 
patients' families and its accumulation in the population.

United Kingdom. sjcr1@york.ac.uk

OBJECTIVES: There is evidence that breastmilk feeding reduces mortality and 
short and long-term morbidity among infants born too soon or too small. The aim 
of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of enhanced staff contact 
for mothers with infants in a neonatal unit with a birth weight of 500-2,500 g 
from the perspective of the UK National Health Service.
METHODS: A decision-tree model linked clinical outcomes with long-term health 
outcomes. The study population was divided into three weight bands: 500-999 g, 
1000-1,749 g, and 1,750-2,500 g. Clinical and resource use data were obtained 
from literature reviews. The measure of benefit was quality-adjusted life-years. 
Uncertainty was evaluated using cost-effectiveness acceptability curves and 
sensitivity analyses.
RESULTS: The intervention was less costly and more effective than the comparator 
in the base-case analysis for each birth weight group. The results were quite 
robust to the sensitivity analyses performed.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first economic evaluation in this complex field and 
offers a model to be developed in future research. The results provide 
preliminary indications that enhanced staff contact may be cost-effective. 
However, the limited evidence available, and the limited UK data in particular, 
suggest that further research is required to provide results with confidence.

Dear policy maker: have you made up your mind? A discrete choice experiment 
among policy makers and other health professionals.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to get insight in what criteria as 
presented in Health technology assessment (HTA) studies are important for 
decision makers in healthcare priority setting.
METHODS: We performed a discrete choice experiment among Dutch healthcare 
professionals (policy makers, HTA experts, advanced HTA students). In 
twenty-seven choice sets, we asked respondents to elect reimbursement of one of 
two different healthcare interventions, which represented unlabeled, curative 
treatments. Both treatments were incrementally compared with usual care. The 
results of the interventions were normal outputs of HTA studies with a societal 
perspective. Results were analyzed using a multinomial logistic regression 
model. Upon completion of the questionnaire, we discussed the exercise with 
policy makers.
RESULTS: Severity of disease, costs per quality-adjusted life-year gained, 
individual health gain, and the budget impact were the most decisive decision 
criteria. A program targeting more severe diseases increased the probability of 
reimbursement dramatically. Uncertainty related to cost-effectiveness was also 
important. Respondents preferred health gains that include quality of life 
improvements over extension of life without improved quality of life. Savings in 
productivity costs were not crucial in decision making, although these are to be 
included in Dutch reimbursement dossiers for new drugs. Regarding subgroups, we 
found that policy makers attached relatively more weight to disease severity 
than others but less to uncertainty.
CONCLUSIONS: Dutch policy makers and other healthcare professionals seem to have 
reasonably well articulated preferences: six of seven attributes were 
significant. Disease severity, budget impact, and cost-effectiveness were very 
important. The results are comparable to international studies, but reveal a 
larger set of important decision criteria.

Association between mammalian lifespan and circadian free-running period: the 
circadian resonance hypothesis revisited.

Biological rhythms that oscillate with periods close to 24 h (circadian cycles) 
are pervasive features of mammalian physiology, facilitating entrainment to the 
24 h cycle generated by the rotation of the Earth. In the absence of 
environmental time cues, circadian rhythms default to their endogenous period 
called tau, or the free-running period. This sustained circadian rhythmicity in 
constant conditions has been reported across the animal kingdom, a ubiquity that 
could imply that innate rhythmicity confers an adaptive advantage. In this 
study, we found that the deviation of tau from 24 h was inversely related to the 
lifespan in laboratory mouse strains, and in other rodent and primate species. 
These findings support the hypothesis that misalignment of endogenous rhythms 
and 24 h environmental cycles may be associated with a physiological cost that 
has an effect on longevity.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Arterial hypertension is a well known risk factor for 
cardiovascular diseases. Today, it is possible to calculate the cardiovascular 
risk at 10 years with the risk card. The reduction of cardiovascular risk is 
based on a multi-factorial approach including the lifestyle modification. In 
Italy, OEC study has calculated that a certain proportion of borderline 
hypertensives, not eligible for a pharmacological treatment, remain at risk. 
Borderline arterial hypertension (140-150/90-95 mmHg) in Italian population is 
documented in 19% of males and 14% of females.: Aim of the study is to examine 
the efficacy of the lifestyle changes in reducing the global cardiovascular risk 
in bordeline hypertensives.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: 102 patients affected by borderline hypertensive (46 M 
and 56 F, mean age: 55.6 yrs ) were enclosed in a 12 months prospective study. 
Three checks were programmed during the follow-up, i.e., at beginning, 6 months 
and 12 months later. At the start of the study every patient received a list of 
lifestyle changes to be respected. Pressure arterial systolic and diastolic were 
obtained at beginning and at the end of successive. At the last check each 
patient received a questionnaire to be filled up. According to the calculated 
score, each patient was classified as: non-responder (score: 0-3), partially 
responder (score: 4-6), responder (score: 7-9).
RESULTS: A significant reduction of the globalcardiovascular risk has been 
observed at the end of the study in both the responders and partially 
responders. Such a reduction was seen to be due to positive changes in blood 
pressure and total, HDL, LDL cholesterol.
CONCLUSIONS: This study confirmed that a non-pharmacological therapy based on 
lifestyle changes has to be preventively administered in the presence of a 
borderline hypertension because of its beneficial effects in reducing the global 
risk of cardiovascular disease. Therefore, we firmly think that a prompt 
utilization of a correct lifestyle can sort the triple effect of improving the 
expectancy of life, ameliorating the quality of life, reducing the social costs 
of arterial hypertension.

OBJECTIVES: To identify potentially low-value services for inclusion in 
value-based insurance design (VBID) programs and to discuss challenges involved 
in incorporating such information.
METHODS: We searched the Tufts Medical Center Cost-Effectiveness Analysis 
Registry (www.cearegistry.org) to identify examples of low-value services, 
defined as interventions that make health worse without saving money or those 
that cost at least $100,000 per quality-adjusted life-year gained. We restricted 
our attention to papers published since 2000. We supplemented this literature 
review with a list of services recently rejected by the United Kingdom's 
National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence for coverage by the UK's 
National Health Service.
RESULTS: The list of potentially low-value services includes several drugs to 
treat cancer, as well as other therapies such as left ventricular assist devices 
and lung volume reduction surgery. Building negative incentives into VBID 
programs to discourage use of low-value care will involve a number of 
challenges, including identification of appropriate candidates; the scope of 
services to be covered (ie, whether VBID should be expanded beyond drugs to 
address medical devices, procedures, and diagnostics); and whether VBID programs 
should target specific subgroups.
CONCLUSION: Identifying noncontroversial low-value services and designing VBID 
programs to discourage their use will not be easy. However, to fulfill their 
promise of improving value and moderating cost growth, VBID programs should 
target low-value as well as high-value care.

Ethanol exposure affects cell movement during gastrulation and induces split 
axes in zebrafish embryos.

To explore the toxic effects of ethanol on axis formation during embryogenesis, 
zebrafish embryos at different developmental stages were treated with 3% ethanol 
for 3h. The effects of ethanol exposure appeared to be stage-dependent. The dome 
stage embryo was most sensible to form posterior split axes upon ethanol 
exposure. Morphological and histological observations and whole-mount in situ 
hybridization results showed that ethanol exposure at this stage caused a 
general gastrulation delay, and induced double notochords, double neural tubes 
and two sets of somites in the posterior trunk. Mechanistically, no ectopic 
organizer was found by examining the expression patterns of dorsoventral markers 
including goosecoid, chordin and eve1 at the onset of gastrulation. However, 
radial intercalation, epiboly and convergence extension were inhibited by 
ethanol exposure as revealed by cell labeling, phenotypic observation and the 
expression patterns of axial or paraxial markers. Further investigation showed 
that the cell aggregation might be affected by ethanol exposure, as indicated by 
the much more scattered expression pattern of chordin, eve1 and wnt11 at the 
early gastrula stage, and the discontinuous gsc positive cells during migration. 
These results imply that ethanol might affect cell movement before and during 
gastrulation and as a consequence, induces a split axes phenotype.

Effects of age and limb dominance on upper and lower limb muscle function in 
healthy males and females aged 40-80 years.

This study investigated the effects of gender, age, and dominance on upper and 
lower limb muscle function. One hundred and fifty-two males and females aged 
20-30 and 40-80 years were recruited. Maximal voluntary isometric strength (MVC) 
and rate of force development (RFD) of the knee extensor muscles, and handgrip 
MVC were measured bilaterally as indicators of lower and upper limb muscle 
function, respectively. In both sexes, significant main effects were found for 
age (knee extension MVC, RFD, and handgrip MVC) and limb dominance (handgrip 
MVC). Men exhibited a steeper age-related decline in muscle function than women, 
particularly in the lower limb [dominant limb: knee extension MVC -56% (men) vs. 
-35% (women); handgrip MVC -30% (men) vs. -26% (women); RFD -67% (men) vs. -47% 
(women); non-dominant limb: knee extension MVC -49% (men) vs. -36% (women); 
handgrip MVC -26% (men) vs. -24% (women); RFD -62% (men) vs. -44% (women)]. 
Although men showed a higher rate of decline in muscle function, in absolute 
terms they demonstrated better muscle function than women in all age groups, 
which has important implications for independence and quality of life. A clear 
asymmetry in muscle function was evident in both sexes only for handgrip MVC.

Surgical treatment of prostate cancer: what to do?

Eckrich P(1).

Author information:
(1)Sanford School of Medicine, The University of South Dakota, USA.

Although there is a paucity of prospective studies comparing surgical treatment 
of prostate cancer to other treatments, surgical treatment is usually 
recommended for men with a good chance for cure who have ten or more years life 
expectancy. Proper selection of men undergoing surgery is critical to achieve 
cures and minimize side effects. Laparoscopic and robotic prostatectomy have 
become the predominant approach for surgery despite a very slow learning curve, 
greater expense, and higher dissatisfaction rates compared to more traditional 
approaches. Outcomes using a laparoscopic or robotic approach are equivalent to 
open methods only after 250 to 1000 procedures. In this era of increasing 
medical costs, utilization of robotic and laparoscopic approaches to prostatic 
cancer surgery needs to be critically examined.

BACKGROUND: Short stay (admission, surgery, and discharge the same day or within 
24 hours) following breast cancer surgery is part of an established care 
protocol but as yet not well implemented in Europe. Alongside a before-after 
multi-centre implementation study, an economic evaluation was performed 
exploring the cost-effectiveness of a short stay programme (SSP) versus care as 
usual (CAU).
MATERIAL AND METHODS: In the implementation study, 324 patients were included. 
In the economic evaluation a societal perspective was applied with a six week 
time horizon. Cost data were obtained from Case Record Forms and cost diaries. 
Effectiveness was assessed by calculating Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs), 
using the EuroQol-5D. Cost-effectiveness was expressed as the incremental costs 
per QALY.
RESULTS: Mean societal costs decreased by euro955,- (95% CI euro - 2104,- to 
euro157,-) for patients in SSP (n=127) compared with CAU (n=135). Mean 
healthcare costs differed euro883,- (95% CI euro - 1560,- to euro870,-) in 
favour of SSP. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio could not be calculated 
due to similar effectiveness for both groups, i.e. the difference in QALYs was 
zero. The cost-effectiveness acceptability curves showed that the probability 
that SSP was more cost-effective than CAU was over 90% in the base-case 
analysis.
DISCUSSION: A short stay programme as implemented is cost-effective compared 
with care as usual. In achieving good and more efficient quality of care, larger 
scale implementation is warranted.

Brain volume and survival from age 78 to 85: the contribution of Alzheimer-type 
magnetic resonance imaging findings.

Kingdom.

OBJECTIVES: To test the prediction of survival using magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI)-derived global and regional brain volumes in subjects aged 78 to 79 
without dementia.
DESIGN: Observational follow-up study.
SETTING: University teaching hospital.
PARTICIPANTS: Participants born in 1921, recruited in 1997/98 to a longitudinal 
study, who underwent brain MRI in 1999/2000.
MEASUREMENTS: Vital status on May 12, 2006, global and regional brain volumes.
RESULTS: Thirty-seven of 98 (34.9%) participants died during follow-up. After 
adjustment for cognitive ability at time of MRI examination, childhood 
intelligence, sex, hypertension, smoking history, obesity, hyperlipidemia, and 
age at MRI, proportion of intracranial volume occupied by the brain (brain 
fraction) predicted death before age 85 (P=.04). Participants with brain 
fraction less than 0.726 had more than twice the relative risk (2.8, 95% 
confidence interval=1.1-7.3) of death than participants with brain fraction 
greater 0.726. Lower survival was significantly associated with lower gray 
matter volumes in bilateral parietal and left frontoparietal areas and with 
lower white matter volumes in left parietal and right posterior temporal 
regions. Cox regression analysis showed that parietal white matter volume 
(P=.003), a subsequent diagnosis of dementia (P<.001), and sex (P=.004) were 
independent predictors of survival.
CONCLUSION: In participants aged 78 to 79, a lower global brain fraction 
predicted survival to approximately age 85. Smaller regional volumetric brain 
reductions, seen in Alzheimer's disease (AD), also predicted survival 
independent of dementia. The presence of prodromal AD probably explain the main 
findings.

Molecular gene therapy: overexpression of the alternative NADH dehydrogenase 
NDI1 restores overall physiology in a fungal model of respiratory complex I 
deficiency.

Defects in oxidative phosphorylation lie at the heart of a wide variety of 
degenerative disorders, cancer, and aging. Here, we show, using the fungal model 
Podospora anserina, that the overexpression of the native mitochondrial 
matrix-faced type II NADH dehydrogenase NDI1, paralogue of the human apoptosis 
inducing factor AIF1, can fully restore all physiological consequences of 
respiratory complex I deficiency. We disrupted the 19.3-kDa subunit of the 
complex I catalytic core, orthologue of the human PSST subunit, leading to a 
complete absence of the complex without affecting the assembly and/or stability 
of the rest of the respiratory chain. This disruption caused a several-fold life 
span extension at the expense of both male and female fertility. The effect was 
generally similar but markedly milder than that caused by defects in the complex 
III/IV-dependent pathway and not associated with a clear reduction in the 
steady-state level of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species. Whereas the native 
expression of NDI1 was sufficient to overcome lethality, only the artificial, 
constitutive overexpression of NDI1 could fully remedy this deficiency: The 
latter strikingly restored both life span and fertility to levels 
indistinguishable from wild type, thus demonstrating its unique potential in 
molecular gene therapy.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the effects of physical exercise on physical, functional 
and psychological dimensions in nursing home residents.
MATERIAL AND METHOD: A quasi-experimental design was used to test for treatment 
effects in a sample of elderly residents in two nursing homes. The treatment 
consisted of 8 weeks (two 60-minute sessions per week) of light physical 
exercise. Joint mobility, muscle strength, walking and stability, functional 
capacity, pain, cognitive status and psychological well-being were assessed as 
potential treatment outcomes.
RESULTS: Participants were divided in a treatment group (n=24) and a control 
group (n=27). Statistically significant differences were found in knee 
extension, elbow flexors and knee extensors, stability and walking ability, as 
well as in functional capacity, cognitive functioning, and well-being. Pain 
perception decreased after the treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: The application of a physical activity program had positive effects 
on physical, functional and psychological facets of the residents' lives. 
Therefore, physical activity may prevent or reduce several medical and 
psychological problems associated with old age, thus avoiding functional loss 
and disability.

Synapse-specific vesicle pools have been widely characterized at central 
terminals. Here, we demonstrate a vesicle pool that is not confined to a synapse 
but spans multiple terminals. Using fluorescence imaging, correlative electron 
microscopy, and modeling of vesicle dynamics, we show that some recycling pool 
vesicles at synapses form part of a larger vesicle "superpool." The vesicles 
within this superpool are highly mobile and are rapidly exchanged between 
terminals (turnover: approximately 4% of total pool/min), significantly changing 
vesicular composition at synapses over time. In acute hippocampal slices we show 
that the mobile vesicle pool is also a feature of native brain tissue. We also 
demonstrate that superpool vesicles are available to synapses during 
stimulation, providing an extension of the classical recycling pool. Experiments 
using focal BDNF application suggest the involvement of a local 
TrkB-receptor-dependent mechanism for synapse-specific regulation of presynaptic 
vesicle pools through control of vesicle release and capture to or from the 
extrasynaptic pool.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of a provider initiated primary care outreach 
intervention compared with usual care among older adults at risk of functional 
decline.
DESIGN: Randomised controlled trial.
SETTING: Patients enrolled with 35 family physicians in five primary care 
networks in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.
PARTICIPANTS: Patients were eligible if they were 75 years of age or older and 
were not receiving home care services. Of 3166 potentially eligible patients, 
2662 (84%) completed the validated postal questionnaire used to determine risk 
of functional decline. Of 1724 patients who met the risk criteria, 769 (45%) 
agreed to participate and 719 were randomised.
INTERVENTION: The 12 month intervention, provided by experienced home care 
nurses in 2004-6, consisted of a comprehensive initial assessment using the 
resident assessment instrument for home care; collaborative care planning with 
patients, their families, and family physicians; health promotion; and referral 
to community health and social support services.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Quality adjusted life years (QALYs), use and costs of 
health and social services, functional status, self rated health, and mortality.
RESULTS: The mean difference in QALYs between intervention and control patients 
during the study period was not statistically significant (0.017, 95% confidence 
interval -0.022 to 0.056; P=0.388). The mean difference in overall cost of 
prescription drugs and services between the intervention and control groups was 
not statistically significant, (-$C165 ( pound107; euro118; $162), 95% 
confidence interval -$C16 545 to $C16 214; P=0.984). Changes over 12 months in 
functional status and self rated health were not significantly different between 
the intervention and control groups. Ten patients died in each group.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study do not support adoption of this 
preventive primary care intervention for this target population of high risk 
older adults. Trial registration Clinical trials NCT00134836.

: The purpose of this study was to document joint range of motion of premature, 
very low birthweight infants and to describe developmental changes in joint 
range in the first year of life. The relationship between a group of three 
central nervous system complications and obtained range of motion was 
investigated. A longitudinal descriptive design was used documenting joint range 
of motion values over the first year of life in 65 premature, very low 
birthweight infants. Joint range of motion values were obtained using a plastic 
goniometer. Measures were based on an adaptation of the Amiel-Tison assessment. 
Infants were tested at the time of hospital discharge, and at 4, 8, and 12 
months chronological age. The obtained values were summarized through 
descriptive statistical methods. Longitudinal trends in the sample demonstrated 
changes in joint range of motion over time. However, the preterm infants never 
displayed the high amount of flexion characteristic of full-term babies. The 
premature infants in the present study demonstrated more hip extension as they 
approached term conceptional age than previously reported values for full-term 
newborns. The present sample also had more elbow extension and less ankle 
dorsiflexion in comparison with previously reported findings for term infants. 
These findings may have developmental implications for a divergent course of 
neuromotor development in premature infants.

BACKGROUND: Quality of life (QoL) measures are important in growth hormone (GH) 
deficiency (GHD) in adults. Ideally, for use in health economics, QoL should be 
expressed in utilities. The aim of this study was to obtain reference values and 
utilities for QoL of GHD in adults in Belgium and the Netherlands.
METHODS: The study was conducted in three stages: (1) The Quality of 
Life-Assessment for Growth Hormone Deficiency in Adults (QoL-AGHDA) and the 
EQ-5D were administered in a representative sample of 6,875 individuals from the 
Belgian and 1,400 individuals from the general Dutch population. The 
EQ-5D(index) can be used to estimate utilities. Using a regression, utilities 
were predicted from the QoL-AGHDA. (2) QoL-AGHDA scores were obtained from 299 
Belgian and 234 Dutch adult patients with GHD and no GH replacement. These 
scores were converted to utilities and compared the burden of disease with other 
patient groups. (3) To test the criterion validity, the 'standard' EQ-5D(index) 
was used in a subsample of 64 Dutch GHD patients and compared with the predicted 
utilities.
RESULTS: We obtained data from 1,026 Belgian (response rate = 15%) and 1,038 
Dutch respondents (response rate = 74%). The Belgian mean QoL-AGHDA value was 
6.95 (90% range = 14.00), and the Dutch mean was 5.48 (range = 13.00). The R (2) 
of the regression model to predict the EQ-5D(index) was 0.360 (Belgium) and 
0.482 (the Netherlands). We demonstrated a considerable burden of disease in GHD 
patients, comparable to patients with hypertension or with type II diabetes. The 
criterion validity was 0.407 (intraclass correlation, ICC).
CONCLUSIONS: Interventions in GHD can now be evaluated more validly in Belgium 
and the Netherlands.

Nicaragua.

Reyna Creole cattle originated from Bos taurus cattle brought to Latin America 
during the Spanish colonization in the fifteenth century and are the only 
remaining local breed in Nicaragua. However, the current genetic status of this 
breed is unknown. Therefore, the population structure of three recorded Reyna 
Creole herds in Nicaragua was studied to estimate their level of inbreeding, 
effective population size, and generation intervals. Data from 2,609 animals 
born between 1958 and 2007 were analyzed. A pedigree completeness index higher 
than 0.8 was required to obtain reliable estimates of the level of inbreeding, 
and this criterion was met for 367 animals (14%) in two herds. The average level 
of inbreeding was 13.0%, with values ranging from 0% to 43.8% for individual 
animals. One of the herds had an average inbreeding level of 21.6%, primarily 
due to long periods in which the same bulls were used for mating, leading to 
excessive frequencies of matings between closely related animals. The effective 
population size differed between years and ranged from 28 to 46 animals, showing 
that the Reyna Creole cattle breed is endangered, close to critical status. The 
average generation interval was 6.9 years with values as high as 19.1 years for 
some sires that were used for artificial insemination over a long period of 
time. Due to the high level of inbreeding and small population size, urgent 
actions are required for the development of a breeding program to protect the 
breed and support its sustainable utilization.

This study aimed to estimate the health burden and the direct as well as 
indirect costs of morbidity and mortality attributable to obesity and overweight 
in Germany for the year 2002. We used the concept of attributable fractions 
based on German prevalence data and relative risks from US studies as well as 
routine statistics. We estimated obesity- and overweight-attributable deaths, 
years of potential life lost (YPLL) and quality-adjusted life years lost (QALY) 
for various diseases associated with obesity and overweight. Direct costs were 
estimated for inpatient and outpatient treatment, rehabilitation and non-medical 
costs. Indirect costs were estimated for sickness absence, early retirement and 
mortality using the human capital approach. We estimated 36,653 obesity- and 
overweight-attributable deaths with 428,093 consecutive YPLL and 367,772 QALYs 
lost. Obesity caused 4,854 million EUR in direct costs corresponding to 2.1% of 
the overall German health expenditures in 2002 and 5,019 million EUR in indirect 
costs. Forty-three percent of direct costs resulted from endocrinological 
diseases like diabetes and obesity itself, followed by cardiovascular diseases 
(38%), neoplasms (14%) and digestive diseases (6%). Sixty percent of indirect 
costs resulted from unpaid work, and 67% of overall indirect costs were due to 
mortality. Obesity and overweight are connected to considerable morbidity and 
mortality as well as societal costs. Improvement and further development of 
effective strategies for preventing and dealing with obesity and overweight are 
necessary.

OBJECTIVES: The emergence of non-AIDS-related events in the HIV-infected 
population experiencing a longer life expectancy implies the implementation of a 
comprehensive approach of HIV clinical management through better access to care, 
prevention, and early diagnosis of co-morbidities.
METHODS: The Orchestra program is a computer-assisted HIV care and support tool 
implemented since December 2004 in the outpatient clinic of a University 
Hospital set in Paris, France. The intervention aims at improving access to HIV 
information care and support specifically targeted five areas of actions: 
cardiovascular risk factors; gynecological follow-up; anti-hepatitis B virus 
(HBV) vaccine coverage; sexuality and prevention of sexually transmitted 
infections; and compliance to antiretrovirals. The impact of this program was 
examined prospectively on a "before-after" basis after a two-year 
implementation.
RESULTS: In the two-year period, 1717 patients were regularly followed. The 
level of the database information significantly increased in time (low density 
lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and glycemia were informed in 74% of patients at 
inclusion versus 95% at two years, and 83% versus 97%, p < 0.001, respectively). 
The number of targeted interventions was also higher. For eligible women, 
papanicolaou smears and mammography were prescribed in 52% of cases after 
intervention, versus 44% at inclusion, p0.04 and 83% versus 50%, p < 0.001, 
respectively. Indicators of care eventually improved significantly. Initially 
72% non-adherent patients declared to be adherent after the intervention ( p < 
0.001) and 67% of patients with initial LDL-hypercholesterolemia normalized 
their LDL level within two years ( p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: The Orchestra program has provided a unique opportunity to assess 
and improve prevention and management of co-morbidities in HIV patients.

As the life expectancy of our Western population progressively increases, so 
does the prevalence of cardiovascular disease and thus the use of antithrombotic 
drugs. The use of central neuraxial anaesthesia techniques in patients treated 
with these drugs is a major clinical problem as the presence of an impaired 
coagulation has been found to be the most important risk factor contributing to 
the formation of a spinal haematoma. The growing number of case reports of 
spinal haematoma has led many national societies of anaesthetists to come up 
with guidelines. This article presents an overview of current guidelines on the 
use of regional anaesthetic techniques in patients treated with various 
anticoagulants and also describes a possible strategy to deal with new 
antithrombotic drugs that have recently been introduced in some countries or 
will be shortly in others.

Recommendations in the UK suggest restricting treatment of Alzheimer's disease 
with cholinesterase inhibitors, on cost-effectiveness grounds, to patients with 
moderate cognitive decline. As the economic analyses that informed these 
recommendations have been the subject of debate, we sought to address the 
potential limitations of existing models and produce estimates of donepezil 
treatment cost effectiveness in the UK using the most recent available data and 
simulation techniques. A discrete-event simulation was developed that predicts 
progression of Alzheimer's disease through correlated changes in cognition, 
behavioural disturbance and function. Patient-level data from seven randomized, 
placebo-controlled donepezil trials and a 7-year follow-up registry provided the 
basis for modeling longitudinal outcomes. Individuals in the simulation were 
assigned unique demographic and clinical characteristics and then followed for 
10 years, with severity of disease tracked on continuous scales. Patient mix and 
costs were developed from UK-specific literature. Analyses were run for severity 
subgroups to evaluate outcomes for sub-populations with disease of mild versus 
moderate severity from both a healthcare payer and societal perspective. All 
costs are reported in pound, year 2007 values, and all outcomes are discounted 
at 3.5% per annum. Over 10 years, treatment of all patients with mild to 
moderate disease reduces overall direct medical costs by an average of over 
pound2300 per patient. When unpaid caregiver time is also taken into 
consideration, savings increase to over pound4700 per patient. Compared with 
untreated patients, patients receiving donepezil experience a discounted gain in 
QALYs averaging 0.11, with their caregivers gaining, on average, 0.01 QALYs. For 
the subset of patients starting treatment with more severe disease, savings are 
more modest, averaging about pound1600 and pound3750 from healthcare and 
societal perspectives, respectively. In probabilistic sensitivity analyses, 
donepezil dominated no treatment between 57% and 62% of replications when only 
medical costs were considered, and between 74% and 79% of replications when 
indirect costs were included, with results more favourable for treatment 
initiation in the mild versus moderate severity stages of the disease. Although 
the simulation results are not definitive, they suggest that donepezil leads to 
health benefits and cost savings when used to treat mild to moderately severe 
Alzheimer's disease in the UK. They also indicate that both benefits and savings 
may be greatest when treatment is started while patients are still in the mild 
stages of Alzheimer's disease.

IMPORTANCE OF THE FIELD: The increase in life expectancy in developed countries 
has given rise to several emerging social problems. Of particular note is the 
dramatic rise in the incidence of neurodegenerative diseases. Given this new 
social scenario, there is a need to identify therapeutic strategies to delay the 
advance of these pathologies, for which no effective treatment is currently 
available.
AREAS COVERED IN THIS REVIEW: The present review discusses some of the drugs 
that are now under development with antiapoptotic activity or currently on the 
market that may have a potential application for the treatment of 
neurodegenerative diseases. Moreover, we also comment on potential compounds 
such as resveratrol and melatonin. Despite the lack of information from clinical 
trials on these two compounds, they are attracting considerable attention 
because of their natural origin and antioxidant and antiapoptotic action. 
Furthermore, they do not show toxicity in humans. In addition, we discuss the 
potential application of several compounds, such as NMDA antagonists, JNK 
inhibitors and GSK-3 inhibitors, for the treatment of neurodegenerative 
disorders.
WHAT THE READER WILL GAIN: This article will review recent developments in the 
field of apoptosis inhibitors, which might provide future tools for the 
treatment of the neurodegenerative diseases.
TAKE HOME MESSAGE: The treatment of neurodegenerative diseases is a major 
challenge in medicine. This is partly because the incidence of these disorders 
is expected to rise in the coming years. New developments in the field of 
apoptosis inhibitors may provide future tools for the treatment of the 
aforementioned neurodegenerative diseases.

BACKGROUND: Malignant pleural effusion is a common sequelae in patients with 
certain malignancies. It represents a terminal condition with short median 
survival (in terms of months) and the goal is palliation. Aim of our study is to 
analyze morbidity, mortality and life expectancy following videothoracoscopic 
talc poudrage.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: From September 2004 to October 2009, 400 patients 
underwent video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) for malignant pleural effusion. 
The conditions of patients were assessed and graded before and after treatment 
concerning morbidity, mortality, success rate of pleurodesis and median
