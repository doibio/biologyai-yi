BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection causes both acute and 
chronic liver disease, performing the key driver toward the global elimination 
of viral hepatitis by 2030. We used data from Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 
study to quantify the burden of liver disease due to hepatitis B at the global, 
regional and national levels.
METHODS: Annual incident cases and age-standardized incidence rates (ASIRs) of 
liver disease due to hepatitis B between 1990 and 2019 were collected from GBD 
study 2019. Percentage changes of incident cases and estimated annual percentage 
changes (EAPCs) of ASIRs were calculated to quantify their temporal trends. 
Correlations between EAPC and socio-demographic index (SDI) and universal health 
coverage index (UHCI) were evaluated by Pearson correlation analyses.
RESULTS: Globally, the incident cases of liver disease due to hepatitis B 
decreased by 4.51% from 84.45 million in 1990 to 80.65 million in 2019 and ASIR 
decreased by an average of 1.52% (95%CI - 1.66%, - 1.37%) per year in this 
period. For the spectrum of liver disease due to hepatitis B, ASIR of cirrhosis 
and other chronic liver diseases increased by an average of 0.13% (95%CI 0.04%, 
0.22%) per year in low SDI region and 0.24% (95%CI 0.04%, 0.34%) per year in 
low-middle SDI region, and ASIR of liver cancer increased by an average of 0.91% 
(95%CI 0.37%, 1.46%) per year in high SDI region in 1990-2019. Positive 
correlations of EAPC in ASIR of liver cancer with SDI and UHCI were observed in 
nations with SDI ≥ 0.7 or UHCI ≥ 70.
CONCLUSION: HBV infection remains a global health problem, causing low and 
low-middle SDI regions with an increasing trend of cirrhosis and other chronic 
liver diseases, and high SDI region with an increasing trend of liver cancer. 
Efforts to eliminate hepatitis B by 2030 needs to focus on not only developing 
regions but also developed regions.

These guidelines are an update and extension of previous AAHA peer-reviewed 
canine vaccination guidelines published in 2017. Vaccination is a cornerstone of 
canine preventive healthcare and one of the most cost-effective ways of 
maintaining a dog's health, longevity, and quality of life. Canine vaccination 
also serves a public health function by forming a barrier against several 
zoonotic diseases affecting dogs and humans. Canine vaccines are broadly 
categorized as containing core and noncore immunizing antigens, with 
administration recommendations based on assessment of individual patient risk 
factors. The guidelines include a comprehensive table listing canine core and 
noncore vaccines and a recommended vaccination and revaccination schedule for 
each vaccine. The guidelines explain the relevance of different vaccine 
formulations, including those containing modified-live virus, inactivated, and 
recombinant immunizing agents. Factors that potentially affect vaccine efficacy 
are addressed, including the patient's prevaccination immune status and vaccine 
duration of immunity. Because animal shelters are one of the most challenging 
environments for prevention and control of infectious diseases, the guidelines 
also provide recommendations for vaccination of dogs presented at or housed in 
animal shelters, including the appropriate response to an infectious disease 
outbreak in the shelter setting. The guidelines explain how practitioners can 
interpret a patient's serological status, including maternally derived antibody 
titers, as indicators of immune status and suitability for vaccination. Other 
topics covered include factors associated with postvaccination adverse events, 
vaccine storage and handling to preserve product efficacy, interpreting product 
labeling to ensure proper vaccine use, and using client education and healthcare 
team training to raise awareness of the importance of vaccinations.

This article aims to focus on identifying hepatic encephalopathy (HE) due to 
portal hypertension and cirrhosis and implementing the most appropriate 
treatment. The occurrence of hepatic encephalopathy is prognostic in the life 
expectancy and quality of life of individuals with cirrhosis. Patients diagnosed 
with cirrhosis should be thoroughly assessed for HE. Many studies have 
identified that even HE in a subclinical (covert) presentation is a predicator 
of increased mortality before and after liver transplant. HE, rather minimal or 
overt, indicates diminished quality of life and increased health care dollars 
and mortality.

INTRODUCTION: There are several studies in the literature about pathological 
fractures but almost no information about patients whose pathological fracture 
caused by a malignant lesion misdiagnosed and treated as a simple fracture. The 
aim of this study was to investigate patient and fracture characteristics, and 
outcomes in cases where fractures occurred in the presence of a malign pathology 
but were treated as simple fractures.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Cases of malign bone lesions between 2000 and 2020 were 
retrospectively reviewed. Patients with a final diagnosis of malign bone lesion 
but whose pathological fractures were treated ignoring the underlying malign 
bone disease were included. Demographic, clinical and outcome data were 
collected from patient's medical records and analyzed.
RESULTS: Six patients met the inclusion criteria. Three of the patients were 
female and the cohort mean age was 56.8 ± 21.8 years at the time of admission. 
Patient diagnoses were: renal cell carcinoma metastasis (n = 1); colon cancer 
metastasis (n = 1); chondrosarcoma (n = 2); osteosarcoma (n = 1); and 
undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma of bone (n = 1). In all cases surgical 
management differed from those that should have been applied if the pathological 
fracture had been identified. Furthermore, surgical management after definitive 
histological diagnosis were more aggressive compared to if the malignancy had 
been identified at first admission. All patients died after a mean follow-up of 
16.67 ± 11.7 months and the complication rate was 100%.
CONCLUSION: When a pathological fracture is misdiagnosed and managed as a simple 
bone fracture, outcomes are extremely poor. In these situations, remedial 
surgery is more extensive, with increased complication rates and there is poor 
life expectancy.

BACKGROUND: For some patients with advanced cancer not knowing prognosis is 
essential. Yet, in an era of informed decision-making, the potential protective 
function of unawareness is easily overlooked. We aimed to investigate 1) the 
proportion of advanced cancer patients preferring not to know prognosis; 2) the 
reasons underlying patients' prognostic information preference; 3) the 
characteristics associated with patients' prognostic information preference; and 
4) the concordance between physicians' perceived and patients' actual prognostic 
information preference.
METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study with structured surveys (PROSPECT). 
Medical and thoracic oncologists included patients (n = 524), from seven Dutch 
hospitals, with metastatic/inoperable cancer and an expected median overall 
survival of ≤ 12 months. For analysis, descriptive statistics and logistic 
regression models were used.
RESULTS: Twenty-five to 31% of patients preferred not to know a general life 
expectancy estimate or the 5/2/1-year mortality risk. Compared to patients 
preferring to know prognosis, patients preferring unawareness more often 
reported optimism, avoidance and inability to comprehend information as reasons 
for wanting limited information; and less often reported expectations of others, 
anxiety, autonomy and a sense of control as reasons for wanting complete 
information. Females (p < .05), patients receiving a further line of systemic 
treatment (p < .01) and patients with strong fighting spirit (p < .001) were 
more likely to prefer not to know prognosis. Concordance between physicians' 
perceived and patients' actual prognostic information preference was poor 
(kappa = 0.07).
CONCLUSIONS: We encourage physicians to explore patients' prognostic information 
preferences and the underlying reasons explicitly, enabling individually 
tailored communication. Future studies may investigate changes in patients' 
prognostic information preferences over time and examine the impact of 
prognostic disclosure on patients who prefer unawareness.

BACKGROUND: Chagas disease (CD) is a neglected tropical disease, endemic in 
Latin America, but due to migration and environmental changes it has become a 
global public health issue.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the global prevalence and disability-adjusted life years 
due to CD using findings from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019.
METHODS: The Global Burden of Disease data was obtained from the Global Burden 
of Disease Collaborative Network; results were provided by the Institute for 
Health Metrics and Evaluation. The prevalence and disability-adjusted life-years 
(DALYs) were described at a global, regional, and national level, including data 
from 1990 to 2019.
RESULTS: Globally, CD prevalence decreased by 11.3% during the study period, 
from 7,292,889 cases estimated in 1990 to 6,469,283 in 2019. Moreover, the 
global DALY rate of CD decreased by 23.7% during the evaluated period, from 
360,872 in 1990 to 275,377 in 2019. In addition, significant differences in the 
burden by sex, being men the most affected, age, with the elderly having the 
highest burden of the disease, and sociodemographic index (SDI), with countries 
with the lowest SDI values having the highest prevalence of the disease, were 
observed. Finally, the prevalence trends have followed different patterns 
according to the region, with a sustained decrease in Latin America, compared to 
an increasing trend in North America and Europe until 2010.
CONCLUSION: The global burden of CD has changed in recent decades, with a 
sustained decline in the number of cases. Although the majority of cases remain 
concentrated in Latin America, the increase observed in countries in North 
America and Europe highlights the importance of screening at-risk populations 
and raising awareness of this neglected tropical disease.

BACKGROUND: The trends in deaths from and disability-adjusted life years (DALY) 
of endometriosis in China remain largely unknown. This study revealed these 
trends and the effects of age, period, and cohort on the death from and DALY of 
endometriosis in China from 1990 to 2019.
METHODS: Data on endometriosis death and DALY in China between 1990 and 2019 
were obtained from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019 (GBD 2019). The 
annual percentage change and average annual percent change (AAPC) were analyzed 
by joinpoint regression. The effects of age, period, and birth cohort on death 
and DALYs were estimated using an age-period-cohort analysis.
RESULTS: The age-standardized death rate (ASDR) and age-standardized DALY rate 
for endometriosis significantly decreased in China, with AAPC values of -4.7 
(95% confidence interval [CI]: -5.10, -4.30) and -1.2 (95% CI: -1.20, -1.10), 
respectively. The joinpoint regression analysis showed that the ASDR and 
age-standardized DALY rate decreased across all age groups. Moreover, the effect 
of age on endometriosis death and DALY decreased with advancing age. Both the 
period and cohort effects on endometriosis death and DALY showed decreasing 
trends, with the effects on death decreasing faster than the effects on DALY.
CONCLUSIONS: The endometriosis ASDR and age-standardized DALY rate decreased 
from 1990 to 2019. The effects of the period and birth cohort on endometriosis 
death and DALY showed a declining trend across all age groups. The effect of age 
on endometriosis deaths and DALYs decreased with advancing age.

BACKGROUND: Trigger digits or stenosing tenosynovitis comprise a pathologic 
condition of the fingers caused by inflammation and thickening of the synovial 
tendon sheaths. Treatment of trigger digits is performed to relieve pain and 
improve function of the affected fingers.
CASE: A 64-year-old male patient, with pain (visual analogue scale [VAS] score 
of 5) and stiffness in the fifth finger of his right hand. He was diagnosed with 
a trigger digit and controlled type 2 diabetes. He received laser acupuncture 
therapy at a Nogier ABF frequency at a dose of 6 Joules per point at the SI-2 
Qiangu point, Ex-UE-9 Baxie point, and a local point on the nodule of his right 
hand; and manual acupuncture at the LI-4 Hegu point bilaterally.
RESULTS: After 7 sessions of acupuncture therapy, this patient did not have any 
pain (a VAS score of 0), the fifth finger of his right hand could be fully 
flexed, and there was almost no resistance to finger extension. There was no 
longer swelling and redness of his fingers, and the size of the nodules was 
reduced. There was an increase in his quality of life per the EQ-5D 
questionnaire from a scale of 70/100 to a scale of 85/100.
CONCLUSIONS: This report describes an elderly patient with a trigger digit and 
diabetes for whom a combination of laser and manual acupuncture therapy was very 
helpful. Laser acupuncture can be an option for patients who have 
contraindications to pharmacologic or interventional therapies.

The pathogen transmitting Aedes albopictus mosquito is spreading rapidly in 
Europe, putting millions of humans and animals at risk. This species is 
well-established in Albania since its first detection in 1979. The sterile 
insect technique (SIT) is increasingly gaining momentum worldwide as a component 
of area-wide-integrated pest management. However, estimating how the sterile 
males will perform in the field and the size of target populations is crucial 
for better decision-making, designing and elaborating appropriate SIT pilot 
trials, and subsequent large-scale release strategies. A mark-release-recapture 
(MRR) experiment was carried out in Albania within a highly urbanized area in 
the city of Tirana. The radio-sterilized adults of Ae. albopictus Albania strain 
males were transported by plane from Centro Agricoltura Ambiente (CAA) 
mass-production facility (Bologna, Italy), where they were reared. In Albania, 
sterile males were sugar-fed, marked with fluorescent powder, and released. The 
aim of this study was to estimate, under field conditions, their dispersal 
capacity, probability of daily survival and competitiveness, and the size of the 
target population. In addition, two adult mosquito collection methods were also 
evaluated: BG-Sentinel traps baited with BG-Lure and CO2, (BGS) versus human 
landing catch (HLC). The overall recapture rates did not differ significantly 
between the two methods (2.36% and 1.57% of the total male released were 
recaptured respectively by BGS and HLC), suggesting a similar trapping 
efficiency under these conditions. Sterile males traveled a mean distance of 
93.85 ± 42.58 m and dispersed up to 258 m. Moreover, they were observed living 
in the field up to 15 days after release with an average life expectancy of 4.26 
± 0.80 days. Whether mosquitoes were marked with green, blue, yellow, or pink, 
released at 3.00 p.m. or 6.00 p.m., there was no significant difference in the 
recapture, dispersal, and survival rates in the field. The Fried competitiveness 
index was estimated at 0.28. This mark-release-recapture study provided 
important data for better decision-making and planning before moving to pilot 
SIT trials in Albania. Moreover, it also showed that both BG-traps and HLC were 
successful in monitoring adult mosquitoes and provided similar estimations of 
the main entomological parameters needed.

Telomere length (TL) is a biomarker of biological aging. Shorter telomeres have 
been associated with mortality and increased rates of age-related diseases. 
However, observational studies are unable to conclude whether TL is causally 
associated with those outcomes. Mendelian randomization (MR) was developed for 
assessing causality using genetic variants in epidemiological research. The 
objective of this study was to test the potential causal role of TL in 
neurodegenerative disorders and life expectancy through MR analysis. Summary 
level data were extracted from the most recent genome-wide association studies 
for TL, Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease, Frontotemporal dementia, 
Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, Progressive Supranuclear Palsy and life 
expectancy. MR estimates revealed that longer telomeres inferred a protective 
effect on risk of AD (OR = 0.964; adjusted p-value = 0.039). Moreover, longer 
telomeres were significantly associated with increased life expectancy (βIVW 
 = 0.011; adjusted p-value = 0.039). Sensitivity analyses suggested evidence for 
directional pleiotropy in AD analyses. Our results showed that genetically 
predicted longer TL may increase life expectancy and play a protective causal 
effect on AD. We did not observe significant causal relationships between longer 
TL and other neurodegenerative diseases. This suggests that the involvement of 
TL on specific biological mechanisms might differ between AD and life 
expectancy, with respect to that in other neurodegenerative diseases. Moreover, 
the presence of pleiotropy may reflect the complex interplay between TL 
homeostasis and AD pathophysiology. Further observational studies are needed to 
confirm these results.

BACKGROUND: To demonstrate the real-word situation of burdens that are 
attributed to the risk factor of high low-density lipoprotein cholesterol 
(LDL-C) at the global, regional, national levels, among different age groups and 
between genders.
METHODS: We analyzed data from the Global Burden of Disease study 2019 related 
to global deaths, disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), summary exposure value 
(SEV), average annual percentage change (AAPC), and observed to expected ratios 
(O/E ratios) attributable to high LDL-C from 1990 to 2019.
RESULTS: Globally, in 2019, the total numbers of deaths and DALYs attributed to 
high LDL cholesterol were 1.47 and 1.41 times higher than that in 1990. The 
age-standardized deaths and DALYs rate was 1.45 and 1.70 times in males compared 
to females, while the age-standardized SEVs rate was 1.10 times in females 
compared to males. The deaths, DALYs, and SEV rates increased with age. In 2019, 
the highest age-standardized rates of both deaths and DALYs occurred in Eastern 
Europe while the lowest occurred in high-income Asia Pacific. High-income North 
America experienced a dramatic reduction of risk related to high LDL-C. 
Correlation analysis identified that the age-standardized SEV rate was 
positively correlated with Socio-demographic Index (SDI; r = 0.7753, P < 0.001). 
The average annual percentage change (AAPC) of age-standardized SEV rate 
decreased in the high SDI and high-middle SDI regions but increased in the 
middle SDI, low-middle SDI, and low SDI regions. High LDL-C mainly contributed 
to ischemic heart diseases.
CONCLUSION: High LDL-C contributed considerably to health burden worldwide. 
Males suffered worse health outcomes attributed to high LDL-C when compared to 
females. The burden attributed to high LDL-C increased with age. Lower SDI 
regions and countries experienced more health problem challenges attributed to 
high LDL-C as the result of social development and this should be reflected in 
policymaking.

This study aimed to provide updated evidence on the status of female breast 
cancer and cancer treatment facilities in Asia, with a special focus on Nepal. 
This review used search phrases that included, breast neoplasm or cancer, health 
status, epidemiology, breast cancer survivors, cancer care facilities, Asia, 
Nepal. Researchers examined databases from January 2011 to December 2020 
(PubMed, PMC, Google Scholar, and the reference lists of included papers). 
Studies of any design and reviews, were included in the study, except for 
qualitative studies. The study findings are presented in a narrative synthesis 
format using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses 
Extension for Scoping Reviews. An initial search resulted in 974 papers, and 896 
were reviewed after being checked for duplication using the Zotero software. 
Accordingly, utilizing the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 188 publications 
were selected, and after review of titles and abstracts, an additional 98 papers 
were removed for different reasons. Finally, the study looked at 90 female 
breast cancer papers. Results showed that the number of cases of breast cancer 
is growing all around the world, including in Asia and Nepal. Age, early 
menarche, late menopause, nulliparity, positive family history, excessive fat 
consumption, alcohol, and smoking are all frequent risk factors for breast 
cancer found in Asian women. Breast self-examination, clinical breast 
examination, and mammography screening are common methods for detecting breast 
carcinoma. Chemotherapy, radiation, and modified mastectomy are commonly used 
options for treatment. The number of breast cancer survivors is growing 
throughout the world, indicating better clinical care. There is a paucity of 
survival data in many Asian countries, including Nepal. There is also a scarcity 
of health workforce specialized in cancer care and treatment, as well as a few 
health facilities that are available to treat cancer cases in many Asian 
countries, including Nepal.

BACKGROUND: The Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) is a well-established tool that has 
been widely employed to assess patients' frailty status and to predict clinical 
outcomes in the acute phase of a disease, but more information is needed to 
define the implications that this tool have when dealing with Non-Communicable 
Diseases (NCDs).
METHODS: An electronic literature search was performed on PubMed, Scopus, 
EMBASE, Web of Science, and EBSCO databases to identify studies employing the 
CFS to assess frailty in patients with NCDs.
FINDINGS: After database searching, article suitability evaluation, and studies' 
quality assessment, 43 studies were included in the systematic review. 
Researches were conducted mostly in Japan (37.5%), and half of the studies were 
focused on cardiovascular diseases (46.42%), followed by cancer (25.00%), and 
diabetes (10.71%). Simplicity (39.29%), efficacy (37.5%), and rapidity (16.07%) 
were the CFS characteristics mostly appreciated by the authors of the studies. 
The CFS-related results indicated that its scores were associated with patients' 
clinical outcomes (33.92%), with the presence of the disease (12.5%) and, with 
clinical decision making (10.71%). Furthermore, CFS resulted as a predictor of 
life expectancy in 23 studies (41.07%), clinical outcomes in 12 studies 
(21.43%), and hospital admissions/readmissions in 6 studies (10.71%).
DISCUSSION: CFS was found to be a well-established and useful tool to assess 
frailty in NCDs, too. It resulted to be related to the most important 
disease-related clinical characteristics and, thus, it should be always 
considered as an important step in the multidisciplinary evaluation of frail and 
chronic patients.

BACKGROUND: Measures of knee stability by symptoms, physical examination, and 
imaging do not accurately reflect the condition of knee movement. Therefore, 
this study aimed to introduce a model for assessing knee stability during 
walking in patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA).
AIMS: Three dimensional(3D) gait analysis system was used to quantify the gait 
of patients and display the clinical diagnosis model of knee instability with 
nomogram to guide clinical diagnosis and treatment.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study performed a 3D gait analysis in 93 
participants with knee OA and 40 healthy control subjects. Multiple linear 
regression analysis investigated the correlation between gait parameters and 
knee extension/flexion stability. The predicting models were built applied 
multinomial logistic regression analysis and calibration plot, C-index, decision 
curve analysis, bootstrapping validation were used to assess the predicting 
nomograms' clinical usefulness and internal validation.
RESULTS: Multiple linear regression analysis indicated knee extension stability 
was correlated with walking speed (β = 0.256, P = 0.006), knee extensor strength 
(β = -0.196, P = 0.03), static HKA (β = 0.218, P = 0.016), width of the femoral 
diaphysis (β = -0.282, P = 0.002) and WOMAC score (β = 0.281, P = 0.002); 
however, knee flexion stability was correlated with walking speed (β = 0.340, 
P < 0.001), knee flexor strength (β = -0.327, P < 0.001), posterior tibial slope 
(PTS) (β = 0.291, P < 0.001), knee flexion/extension range of motion (ROM) 
(β = 0.177, P = 0.018) and HSS score (β = -0.173, P = 0.028). We developed and 
internally validated a knee instability risk nomogram in patients with knee OA.
CONCLUSIONS: These results indicated that using the 3D motion analysis system is 
feasible to quantify knee instability. The current prediction models could serve 
as a reliable tool to quantify the possibility of knee instability in OA 
patients.

BACKGROUND: A previous randomized controlled trial (RCT) demonstrated a trend 
toward a reduced risk of implant-related revision surgery following fixation 
with use of a Proximal Femoral Nail Antirotation (PFNA) with TRAUMACEM V+ 
Injectable Bone Cement augmentation versus no augmentation in patients with 
unstable trochanteric fractures. To determine whether this reduced risk may 
result in long-term cost savings, the present study assessed the 
cost-effectiveness of TRAUMACEM V+ cement augmentation versus no augmentation 
for the fixation of unstable trochanteric fractures from the German health-care 
payer's perspective.
METHODS: The cost-effectiveness model comprised 2 stages: a decision tree 
simulating clinical events, costs, and utilities during the first year after the 
index procedure and a Markov model extrapolating clinical events, costs, and 
utilities over the patient's lifetime. Sources of model parameters included the 
previous RCT, current literature, and administrative claims data. Outcome 
measures were incremental costs (in 2020 Euros), incremental quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). Model 
uncertainty was assessed with deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity 
analyses.
RESULTS: The base-case analysis showed that fixation with cement augmentation 
was the dominant strategy as it was associated with cost savings (€50.3/patient) 
and QALY gains (0.01 QALY/patient). Major influential parameters for the ICER 
were the utility of revision, rates of revision surgery within the first year 
after fixation surgery, and the costs of augmentation and revision surgery. 
Probabilistic sensitivity analyses demonstrated that estimates of cost savings 
were more robust than those of increased QALYs (66.4% versus 52.7% of the 
simulations). For a range of willingness-to-pay thresholds from €0 to €50,000, 
the probability of fixation with cement augmentation being cost-effective versus 
no augmentation remained above 50%.
CONCLUSIONS: Fixation with use of cement augmentation dominated fixation with no 
augmentation for unstable trochanteric fractures, resulting in cost savings and 
QALY gains. Given the input parameter uncertainties, future analyses are 
warranted when long-term costs and effectiveness data for cement augmentation 
are available.

The fall armyworm (FAW) Spodoptera frugiperda is an important invasive pest in 
Africa and Asia. It is a polyphagous pest with at least 353 recorded host plant 
species, including corn. Chemical control of this pest is unsuccessful because 
of a developed resistance and harmful effects on the environment. 
Entomopathogenic fungi are potential biological control agents for FAW. In this 
study, the native strain of Metarhizium rileyi (KNU-Ye-1), collected from a 
cornfield at Yeongcheon, Korea, was identified by morphological and molecular 
characterization. The susceptibility of the fourth-instar larvae of FAW to the 
native strain M. rileyi was examined in the laboratory. The results showed that 
the Korean strain of M. rileyi (KNU-Ye-1) was highly virulent to FAW larvae, 
causing 89% mortality 7 days posttreatment. Therefore, M. rileyi (KNU-Ye-1) 
identified in this study is highly valuable for the biological control of FAW in 
the field.

OBJECTIVE: To report the modified osteotomy and the short-term effectiveness of 
the total elbow joint replacement in patients of hemophilic elbow arthritis with 
severe flexion contracture deformity.
METHODS: This study introduced the therapeutic approach of the total elbow joint 
replacement in patients of hemophilic elbow arthritis with severe flexion 
contracture deformity, and assessed the short-term effectiveness in three cases 
(three elbows) of end-stage hemophilic elbow arthritis admitted from October 
2020 to December 2020. The included patients were all diagnosed with hemophilia 
A (factor VII deficiency), accompanied by severe bilateral elbow joint flexion 
contracture, which seriously affects daily life and requires surgical 
intervention. Clinical data and follow-up results were analyzed before total 
elbow arthroplasty and 1, 3, and 6 months postoperatively. Pre- and 
postoperative range of motion, pain score, and function score were compared, and 
intraoperative and postoperative complications are reported.
RESULTS: All three patients were male, with an average age of 31 years. The main 
clinical manifestations were bilateral elbow arthritis with flexion contracture. 
Two of the patients underwent right elbow replacement, and one patient underwent 
left elbow replacement. All cases were followed up for 6 months postoperatively. 
No incision infection or ulnar nerve injury occurred. Postoperative triceps 
brachii muscle strength was slightly weakened compared with preoperative muscle 
strength. Average elbow flexion and extension range of motion was 60° (30°-100°) 
preoperatively and increased to 127° (110°-140°) postoperatively; rotational 
range of motion of the affected forearm was 47° (10°-85°) preoperatively and 
increased to 117° postoperatively. The mean visual analogue scale (VAS) was 6 
(5-8) preoperatively and decreased to 3 (2-4) postoperatively. The mean MEPS 
score was 62 (55-75) and increased to 87 (80-95) postoperatively. During the 
follow-up, anteroposterior and lateral radiographs showed no signs of prosthesis 
loosening in the elbow.
CONCLUSIONS: For severe hemophilic elbow arthritis patients, the short-term 
treatment effect of total elbow replacement is good, following the strict 
adherence to the surgical indications and proper preparation for the 
perioperative period. The modified osteotomy can fully expose the visual field 
and reduce complications of ulnar nerve injury. The long-term effects need to be 
study future.
