constituted the most abundant group. Interestingly, total plate counts (TPCs) 
and LAB counts, exceeding the limit value of 7logcfu/g, in T and T-RO turkey 
samples coincided with low taste scores (5 and 6, respectively) on days 12 and 
18 of storage. The shelf-life was approximately 10, 17-18 and >21days for the 
control (T), T-RO, T-CH and T-CH-RO turkey samples, respectively. Thus, a 
shelf-life extension of 7-8 and >11days was obtained for T-RO and T-CH, and 
T-CH-RO turkey samples, respectively. The presence of chitosan in T-CH and 
T-CH-RO samples did not negatively influence the taste of cooked turkey meat.

A new approach to understanding racial disparities in prostate cancer treatment.

Presley CJ, Raldow AC, Cramer LD, Soulos PR, Long JB, Yu JB, Makarov DV, Gross 
CP.

OBJECTIVE: Previous studies addressing racial disparities in treatment for 
early-stage prostate cancer have focused on the etiology of undertreatment of 
black men. Our objective was to determine whether racial disparities are 
attributable to undertreatment, overtreatment, or both.
METHODS: Using the SEER-Medicare dataset, we identified men 67–84 years-old 
diagnosed with localized prostate cancer from 1998 to 2007. We stratified men 
into clinical benefit groups using tumor aggressiveness and life expectancy. 
Low-benefit was defined as low-risk tumors and life expectancy <10 years; 
high-benefit as moderate-risk tumors and life expectancy ≥10 years; all others 
were intermediate-benefit. Logistic regression modeled the association between 
race and treatment (radical prostatectomy or radiotherapy) across benefit 
groups.
RESULTS: Of 68,817 men (9.8% black and 90.2% white), 56.2% of black and 66.3% of 
white men received treatment (adjusted odds ratio (OR)=0.65; 95% CI, 0.62–0.69). 
The percent of low-, intermediate-, and high-benefit men who received treatment 
was 56.7%, 68.4%, and 79.6%, respectively (P=<0.001). In the low-benefit group, 
51.9% of black vs. 57.2% of white patients received treatment (OR=0.74; 95% CI, 
0.67–0.81) compared to 57.2% vs. 69.6% in the intermediate-benefit group 
(OR=0.64; 95% CI, 0.59–0.70). Racial disparity was largest in the high-benefit 
group (64.2% of black vs. 81.4% of white patients received treatment; OR=0.57; 
95% CI, 0.48–0.68). The interaction between race and clinical benefit was 
significant (P<0.001).
CONCLUSION: Racial disparities were largest among men most likely to benefit 
from treatment. However, a substantial proportion of both black and white men 
with a low clinical benefit received treatment, indicating a high level of 
overtreatment.

A vulnerability-stress examination of response styles theory in adolescence: 
stressors, sex differences, and symptom specificity.

Stange JP(1), Hamilton JL, Abramson LY, Alloy LB.

Author information:

The stress-reactivity extension of the response styles theory of depression 
suggests that individuals who ruminate (or fail to engage in distraction or 
problem solving) in response to dysphoric mood are likely to experience higher 
levels of depression following stress. However, previous studies have not 
addressed (a) the specificity of these vulnerability-stress relations to 
symptoms of depression following different types of stressors, and (b) to what 
extent rumination and stress can account for the sex differences in depression 
that emerge during early adolescence. A community sample of 256 early 
adolescents (ages 12-13) completed a baseline visit and a follow-up visit 9 
months later. Response styles and symptoms of depression and anxiety were 
assessed at baseline, and intervening life events, emotional maltreatment, peer 
relational victimization, and symptoms of depression and anxiety were assessed 
at follow-up. Higher rumination and lower distraction/problem solving interacted 
with several types of stressors to predict higher levels of symptoms of 
depression but not anxiety. Rumination was more strongly associated with 
elevations in depressive symptoms following the occurrence of relational 
victimization events in girls than in boys. In addition, dependent interpersonal 
stress mediated the sex difference in depressive symptoms that emerged at 
follow-up, and this indirect pathway was stronger among adolescents who tended 
to ruminate. Rumination may confer vulnerability that is specific to symptoms of 
depression following recent stressors during early adolescence. Girls who 
ruminate may be particularly likely to experience depression following 
relational victimization, and dependent interpersonal stressors may help to 
account for girls' greater risk for depression during adolescence.

AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: This randomised controlled trial was conducted to estimate 
the cost-effectiveness of a nurse-led education and psychosocial support 
programme for patients with heart failure (HF) and their partners.
BACKGROUND: There are few studies evaluating cost-effectiveness of interventions 
among HF patient-partner dyads.
METHODS: Dyads randomised to the experimental group received nurse-led 
counselling, computer-based education and written materials aimed at developing 
problem-solving skills at two, six and 12 weeks after hospitalisation with HF 
exacerbation. The dyads in the control group received usual care. A 
cost-effectiveness analysis that included costs associated with staff time to 
deliver the intervention and travel costs was conducted at 12 months. 
Quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) weights for patients and partners were 
estimated by SF-6D.
RESULTS: A total of 155 dyads were included. The intervention cost was €223 per 
patient. Participants in both groups showed improvements in QALY weights after 
12 months. However, no significant difference in QALY weights was found between 
the patients in the two groups, nor among their partners.
CONCLUSION: The intervention was not proven cost-effective, neither for patients 
nor for partners. The intervention, however, had trends (but not significant) 
effects on the patient-partner dyads, and by analysing the QALY gained from the 
dyad, a reasonable mean cost-effectiveness ratio was achieved.
RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: The study shows trends of a cost-effective 
education and psychosocial care of HF patient-partner dyads.

The impact of supported telemetric monitoring in people with type 2 diabetes: 
study protocol for a randomised controlled trial.

Wild S, Hanley J, Lewis S, McKnight J, McCloughan L, Padfield P, Paterson M, 
Pinnock H, McKinstry B.

BACKGROUND: Diabetes prevalence is increasing and current methods of management 
are unsustainable. Effective approaches to supporting self-management are 
required. The aim of this randomized controlled trial is to establish whether 
supported telemetric monitoring of glycemic control and blood pressure results 
in reductions in glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c; the primary outcome of a 
measure of long-term glycemic control) and secondary outcomes of blood pressure 
and weight among people with poorly controlled diabetes compared to a control 
group receiving usual care.
METHODS/DESIGN: Design: multi-center, randomized controlled trial with embedded 
qualitative study. Setting: primary care in Lothian, Kent, Glasgow and Borders 
regions in the UK. Participants: people with type 2 diabetes and confirmed 
HbA1c>7.5% (58 mmol/mol). Intervention/comparison: randomization to intervention 
or control groups will be performed by the Edinburgh Clinical Trials Unit. 
Participants in the intervention group will be shown how to use blood glucose 
and blood pressure monitors and weighing scales which use Bluetooth wireless 
technology to transmit readings via modem to a remote server. These participants 
will be asked to provide at least twice weekly measurements of morning and 
evening blood glucose and weekly measurements of weight and blood pressure. 
Measurements will be checked at least weekly by practice nurses who will contact 
the patients to adjust therapy according to guidelines and reinforce lifestyle 
advice. Participants in the control group will receive usual care. All 
participants will receive an individual education session. Follow-up: 
measurements will be performed at practices 9 months after randomization by 
research nurses blinded to allocation. The primary outcome measure is HbA1c and 
secondary outcomes measure are daytime systolic and diastolic blood pressure, 
weight and cost per quality-adjusted life year. Analysis: intention-to-treat 
analyses will be performed. The sample size of 320 participants allows for 20% 
drop-out and has 80% power at 5% significance to detect a 0.5% absolute (6 
mmol/mol) fall in HbA1c in the intervention group. The qualitative study will 
explore the experiences of patients and professionals using the intervention.

An economic model to evaluate cost-effectiveness of computer assisted knee 
replacement surgery in Norway.

BACKGROUND: The use of Computer Assisted Surgery (CAS) for knee replacements is 
intended to improve the alignment of knee prostheses in order to reduce the 
number of revision operations. Is the cost effectiveness of computer assisted 
surgery influenced by patient volume and age?
METHODS: By employing a Markov model, we analysed the cost effectiveness of 
computer assisted surgery versus conventional arthroplasty with respect to 
implant survival and operation volume in two theoretical Norwegian age cohorts. 
We obtained mortality and hospital cost data over a 20-year period from 
Norwegian registers. We presumed that the cost of an intervention would need to 
be below NOK 500,000 per QALY (Quality Adjusted Life Year) gained, to be 
considered cost effective.
RESULTS: The added cost of computer assisted surgery, provided this has no 
impact on implant survival, is NOK 1037 and NOK 1414 respectively for 60 and 
75-year-olds per quality-adjusted life year at a volume of 25 prostheses per 
year, and NOK 128 and NOK 175 respectively at a volume of 250 prostheses per 
year. Sensitivity analyses showed that the 10-year implant survival in cohort 1 
needs to rise from 89.8% to 90.6% at 25 prostheses per year, and from 89.8 to 
89.9% at 250 prostheses per year for computer assisted surgery to be considered 
cost effective. In cohort 2, the required improvement is a rise from 95.1% to 
95.4% at 25 prostheses per year, and from 95.10% to 95.14% at 250 prostheses per 
year.
CONCLUSIONS: The cost of using computer navigation for total knee replacements 
may be acceptable for 60-year-old as well as 75-year-old patients if the 
technique increases the implant survival rate just marginally, and the 
department has a high operation volume. A low volume department might not 
achieve cost-effectiveness unless computer navigation has a more significant 
impact on implant survival, thus may defer the investments until such data are 
available.

About three-fourths of the total world population live in the tropics but 
consume only 6% of worldwide food production and contribute 15% of the world's 
net revenue explaining the short life expectancy, high infantile mortality, and 
poor daily caloric intake; moreover, lack of clean drinking water and deficient 
sanitation promote water-borne infections, diarrhea, and risk of malabsorption 
that contribute to the prevalence of malnutrition in the tropics. One-third of 
the world's population consumes insufficient iodine increasing the risk for 
mental retardation and deafness due to maternal hypothyroidism. The main 
nutritional syndromes comprise protein-energy malnutrition (marasmus and 
kwashiorkor); nutritional neuropathies, myelopathies and neuromyelopathies, as 
well as specific deficiencies of vitamins and micronutrients including iodine, 
iron, zinc, and selenium.

Erratum in
    Soc Sci Med. 2017 Dec 11;:

Stigma operates at multiple levels, including intrapersonal appraisals (e.g., 
self-stigma), interpersonal events (e.g., hate crimes), and structural 
conditions (e.g., community norms, institutional policies). Although prior 
research has indicated that intrapersonal and interpersonal forms of stigma 
negatively affect the health of the stigmatized, few studies have addressed the 
health consequences of exposure to structural forms of stigma. To address this 
gap, we investigated whether structural stigma-operationalized as living in 
communities with high levels of anti-gay prejudice-increases risk of premature 
mortality for sexual minorities. We constructed a measure capturing the average 
level of anti-gay prejudice at the community level, using data from the General 
Social Survey, which was then prospectively linked to all-cause mortality data 
via the National Death Index. Sexual minorities living in communities with high 
levels of anti-gay prejudice experienced a higher hazard of mortality than those 
living in low-prejudice communities (Hazard Ratio [HR] = 3.03, 95% Confidence 
Interval [CI] = 1.50, 6.13), controlling for individual and community-level 
covariates. This result translates into a shorter life expectancy of 
approximately 12 years (95% C.I.: 4-20 years) for sexual minorities living in 
high-prejudice communities. Analysis of specific causes of death revealed that 
suicide, homicide/violence, and cardiovascular diseases were substantially 
elevated among sexual minorities in high-prejudice communities. Strikingly, 
there was an 18-year difference in average age of completed suicide between 
sexual minorities in the high-prejudice (age 37.5) and low-prejudice (age 55.7) 
communities. These results highlight the importance of examining structural 
forms of stigma and prejudice as social determinants of health and longevity 
among minority populations.

[Sexuality of the elderly: a survey and management].

[Article in French]

Ribes G(1), Cour F.

Author information:
(1)gerard.ribes@gmail.com

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate sexuality in elderly couples and have the knowledge of 
its specific therapeutic options.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Review of articles published on this subject in the 
Medline database, selected according to their scientific relevance together with 
a reflexion from our own experience.
RESULTS: Due to increased life expectancy and the changes in society leading to 
a life with more than one consecutive partner, couples expect to continue sexual 
activity after the age of 65. Clinicians are asked to address this issue 
frequently. With age the frequency of genital sexual relations decreases. Sexual 
activity should be higher both for males and females. The quality of the 
relationship of the couple is a key element in maintaining sexual relations in 
this age group. Sexual satisfaction depends on the understanding, by both 
partners, of the physical and psychological changes due to increased age.
CONCLUSION: The sexuality of the elderly couple must be analysed using specific 
criteria. The clinician's task is to explain to the patients the physiological 
change due to aging and give them advice on how to adapt their sexual behavior 
accordingly. Management will, at the same time, include pharmacological 
treatment, notably for erectile dysfunction, in order to restore satisfactory 
sexual relations. For women, vaginal lubrication products are essential. This 
global management should allow many elderly couples wishing to continue sexual 
relations, to enjoy this period of their lives in harmony with what they desire.

Cytokines released from microglia mediate defensive responses in the brain, but 
the underlying mechanisms are obscure. One proposed process is that nucleotide 
leakage or release from surrounding cells is sensed by metabotropic (P2Y) and 
ionotropic (P2X) purinergic receptors, which may trigger long-term intracellular 
Ca(2+) flux and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) release. Indeed, 3h of exposure 
to ATP was required to evoke TNF-α release from a murine microglial cell line 
(MG5). A Ca(2+) chelator, ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid (EGTA), reduced 
ATP-induced TNF-α release, suggesting that intracellular Ca(2+) is important in 
this response. Therefore, Ca(2+) sensor genes (YC3.6) were transfected into MG5 
cells to investigate the Ca(2+) dynamics underlying ATP-induced TNF-α release. 
The results demonstrated ATP-induced biphasic Ca(2+) mobilization mediated by 
P2Y (~5min) and P2X7 receptors (5-30min). Moreover, Ca(2+) spiking activity in 
cell processes progressively increased with a reduction in P2X7 
receptor-mediated Ca(2+) elevation during 3-h ATP stimulation. Increased Ca(2+) 
spiking activity paralleled the reduction in thapsigargin-sensitive internal 
Ca(2+) stores, dendrite extension, and expression of macrophage scavenger 
receptors with collagenous structure. The Ca(2+) spiking activity was enhanced 
by a P2X7 receptor antagonist (A438079), but inhibited by a store-operated 
channel antagonist (SKF96365) or by co-transfection of small interference 
ribonucleic acid (siRNA) targeted on the channel component (Orai1). Furthermore, 
ATP-induced TNF-α release was enhanced by A438079 but was inhibited by SKF96365. 
Because store-operated channels (Stim1/Orai1) were expressed both in MG5 and 
primary microglial cultures, we suggest that P2X7 receptor signaling inhibits 
store-operated channels during ATP stimulation, and disinhibition of this 
process gates TNF-α release from microglial cells.

BACKGROUND: The quadrivalent and bivalent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines 
are now licensed in several countries. We compared the cost-effectiveness of the 
HPV vaccines to provide evidence for policy decisions.
METHODS: We developed HPV-ADVISE, a multi-type individual-based 
transmission-dynamic model of HPV infection and disease (anogenital warts, and 
cervical, anogenital and oropharyngeal cancers). We calibrated the model to 
sexual behavior and epidemiologic data from Canada, and estimated 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) lost and costs ($CAN 2010) from the 
literature. Vaccine-type efficacy was based on a systematic literature review. 
The analysis was performed from the healthcare provider perspective, and costs 
and benefits were discounted at 3%. Predictions are presented using the median 
[10th;90th percentiles] of simulations.
RESULTS: Under base-case assumptions (vaccinating 10-year-old girls, 80% 
coverage, $95/dose), using the quadrivalent and bivalent vaccines is estimated 
to cost $15,528 [12,056;19,140] and $20,182 [15,531;25,240] per QALY-gained, 
respectively. At equal price, the quadrivalent vaccine is more cost-effective 
than bivalent under all scenarios investigated, except when assuming longer 
duration of protection for the bivalent and minimal anogenital warts burden. 
Under base-case assumptions, the maximum additional cost per dose for the 
quadrivalent vaccine to remain more cost-effective than the bivalent is $32 
[17;46] (using a $40,000/QALY-gained threshold). Results were most sensitive to 
discounting, time-horizon, differences in durations of protection and anogenital 
warts burden.
CONCLUSIONS: Vaccinating pre-adolescent girls against HPV is predicted to be 
highly cost-effective. If equally priced, the quadrivalent is the most 
economically desirable vaccine. However, ultimately, the most cost-effective HPV 
vaccine will be determined by their relative price.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate longitudinally ART sealants placed in Chinese school 
children under field conditions.
METHOD: 191 ART sealants were placed in 140 children, aged 11-14 years, by five 
assistant dentists in four secondary schools in Deyang, Sichuan Province, China. 
Teeth selected for sealing were those with pits and fissures that were deep or 
showing early enamel caries. Teeth were excluded if there was obvious cavitation 
extending into dentine. Standard instruments and procedures for ART sealants 
were used. The material used was a high-viscosity glass-ionomer (Ketac-Molar, 
3MESPE) that was inserted into the pits and fissures with the "press-finger" 
technique. The status of the sealants was evaluated annually over 6 years after 
placement by the same examiner who was not involved in the placement of the 
sealants using explorers, mouth-mirrors and an intra-oral fibre-optic light. No 
missing sealants were replaced during the study.
RESULTS: 107 sealants (56% of the original) were examined after 6 years. The 
cumulative survival rates of the sealants (partially or fully retained) after 2, 
4 and 6 years were 79%, 68% and 59%, respectively. Caries prevention lagged the 
fall in sealant survival but remained high throughout the study period, being 
over 90% in the first 4 years and 85% after 6 years.
CONCLUSIONS: ART sealants placed under field conditions in Chinese 
schoolchildren have a high retention rate. Missing sealants should be replaced 
to maintain their preventive efficacy.
CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The sealing of pits and fissures can be an effective 
caries preventive approach. Resin-based sealants have the disadvantage in that 
they require an optimal level of moisture control during placement. In children 
and in outreach situations glass ionomer ART sealants, which are more moisture 
tolerant, can offer a viable alternative.

Alcohol-attributable mortality and years of potential life lost in Chile in 
2009.

Independencia 939, Santiago, Chile. alvacasti@gmail.com.

AIMS: The aim of the study was to estimate mortality and years of potential life 
lost (YPLL) attributable to alcohol consumption in 2009 in Chile.
METHODS: The population considered for this study included those 15 years and 
over. Exposure to alcohol in the population was estimated by triangulating the 
records of alcohol per capita consumption in Chile with information from the 
Eighth National Study of Drugs in the General Population (2008). The effect of 
alcohol consumption on each cause of death (relative risk) was extracted from 
previously published meta-analyses. With this information we estimated the 
alcohol-attributable fraction (AAF) and deaths and YPLL due to alcohol 
consumption. The confidence intervals for the AAF were estimated with Monte 
Carlo sampling using the estimated variances of the exposure prevalence and 
relative effect.
RESULTS: The estimated total number of deaths attributable to alcohol 
consumption was 8753 (95% CI: 6257, 11,584) corresponding to 9.8% (95% CI: 
7.01%, 12.98%) of all deaths in Chile in 2009. The total estimated YPLL 
attributable to alcohol were 195,475 (95% CI: 164,287, 227,726), corresponding 
to 21.5% (95% CI: 18.1%, 25.0%) of total YPLL for that year in Chile.
CONCLUSION: Alcohol consumption is a major risk factor and accounts for nearly 
one of ten deaths in Chile. These results may be used to guide the design of 
public health policies and evaluations.

The characterization and antimicrobial properties of water chestnut 
starch-chitosan (WSC) films containing Cornus officinalis fruit extract (COE 1% 
w/w), glycerol monolaurate (GML 1% w/w), nisin (10,000 IU/g), pine needle 
essential oil (PNEO 0.35% v/v), and their combinations were evaluated. 
Incorporation of COE decreased pH value of the film-forming solution, the 
moisture content and the water absorption expansion ability (WAEA). 
GML-incorporated film had lower WAEA, tensile strength, elongation and puncture 
strength. However, films with nisin displayed good mechanical properties. All 
the treated films were less transparent and higher in water vapour permeability 
values. For film microstructure, the presence of PNEO caused discontinuities 
with lipid droplets or holes embedded in a continuous network and the 
incorporation of GML led to abaisse-like structures. The COE, GML, nisin, PNEO 
and their combinations incorporated in the WSC films are effective in inhibiting 
the growth of Escherichia coli O157:H7, Staphylococcus aureus and Listeria 
monocytogenes at different levels. The results showed that WSC films containing 
COE and GML, GML and nisin, COE and nisin were able to reduce the number of E. 
coli O157:H7, S. aureus and L. monocytogenes. This research has potential 
applications to the extension of the shelf life of food products.

Rapid progression of antiviral treatments of chronic hepatitis C virus 
infection.

The treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection with pegylated interferon 
alfa and ribavirin leads to a sustained virologic response in around 50% of 
patients with HCV genotype 1, 65% with HCV genotype 4, 75% with HCV genotype 3 
and around 80% with HCV genotype 2. A better understanding of the HCV life-cycle 
recently resulted in the development of several potential direct-acting 
antiviral drugs (DAAs) targeting viral proteins (NS3/4A protease inhibitors, 
NS5B nucleos(t)idic and non nucleos(t)idic polymerase inhibitors, NS5A 
replication complex inhibitors). A lot of data have been reported with the 
combinations of pegylated interferon-alfa/ribavirin and the first generation 
oral DAAs, Telaprevir and Boceprevir. These regimens have demonstrated a high 
level of antiviral efficacy and an acceptable safety profile in treatment-naïve 
patients and in prior non-responders to pegylated interferon-alfa/ribavirin. 
After this first major step, the combination of the second generation DAAs with 
pegylated interferon-alfa/ribavirin will impact antiviral potency and tolerance 
and will reduce the duration of therapies and the pill burden. The next step 
will be the oral combination of new DAAs which is likely to become the standard 
of care for chronic HCV after 2015. Most studies are conducted in small numbers 
of "easy-to-treat" patients with short post-treatment period for concluding to a 
sustained virologic response: extension of both the numbers of treated patients 
and post-treatment follow-up, inclusion of more difficult-to-treat patients 
(experienced genotype 3-infected or genotype 1-infected patients who failed to 
first generation protease inhibitors, cirrhotic, HIV co-infected patients, 
allograft recipients or candidates to transplantation) will probably reduce the 
overall rate of cure.

Incidence rates of cognitive impairment and dementia are rising with the ageing 
population. Meanwhile, the limited success of current treatments has led to a 
search for early markers of dementia which could predict future progression or 
improve quality of life for those already suffering from the disease. One focus 
has been on the correlation between physical and cognitive measures with an 
increasing interest in the association between frailty and cognitive decline. 
Frailty is an age-related syndrome described as the decreased ability of an 
organism to respond to stressors. A number of epidemiological studies have 
reported that frailty increases the risk of future cognitive decline and that 
cognitive impairment increases the risk of frailty suggesting that cognition and 
frailty interact within a cycle of decline associated with ageing. This paper 
reviews the evidence for an association between frailty and cognitive impairment 
and outlines some of the mechanisms that potentially underpin this relationship 
from brain neuropathology and hormonal dysregulation to cardiovascular risk and 
psychological factors.

Combined inhibition of HER1/EGFR and RAC1 results in a synergistic 
antiproliferative effect on established and primary cultured human glioblastoma 
cells.

Glioblastoma is the most frequent brain tumor of glial origin in adults. With 
the best available standard-of-care, patients with this disease have a life 
expectancy of only approximately 15 months after diagnosis. Because the EGF 
receptor (HER1/EGFR) is one of the most commonly dysregulated oncogenes in 
glioblastoma, HER1/EGFR-targeted agents, such as erlotinib, were expected to 
provide a therapeutic benefit. However, their application in the clinical 
setting failed. Seeking an explanation for this finding, we previously 
identified several candidate genes for resistance of human glioblastoma cell 
lines toward erlotinib. On the basis of this panel of genes, we aimed at 
identifying drugs that synergistically enhance the antiproliferative effect of 
erlotinib on established and primary glioblastoma cell lines. We found that 
NSC23766, an inhibitor of RAC1, enhanced the antineoplastic effects of erlotinib 
in U87MG, T98MG, and A172MG glioblastoma cell lines for the most part in a 
synergistic or at least in an additive manner. In addition, the synergistic 
antiproliferative effect of erlotinib and NSC23766 was confirmed in primary 
cultured cells, indicating a common underlying cellular and molecular mechanism 
in glioblastoma. Therefore, agents that suppress RAC1 activation may be useful 
therapeutic partners for erlotinib in a combined targeted treatment of 
glioblastoma.

Constructing indirect utility models: some observations on the principles and 
practice of mapping to obtain health state utilities.

The construction of mapping models is an increasingly popular mechanism for 
obtaining health state utility data to inform economic evaluations in health 
care. There is great variation in the sophistication of the methods utilized but 
to date very little discussion of the appropriate theoretical framework to guide 
the design and evaluation of these models. In this paper, we argue that 
recognizing mapping models as a form of indirect health state valuation allows 
the use of the framework described by Dolan for the measurement of social 
preferences over health. Using this framework, we identify substantial concerns 
with the method for valuing health states that is implicit in indirect utility 
models (IUMs), the conflation of two sets of respondents' values in such models, 
and the lack of a structured and statistically reasonable approach to choosing 
which states to value and how many observations per state to require in the 
estimation dataset. We also identify additional statistical challenges 
associated with clustering and censoring in the datasets for IUMs, additional to 
those attributable to the descriptive systems, and a potentially significant 
problem with the systematic understatement of uncertainty in predictions from 
IUMs. Whilst recognizing that IUMs appear to meet the needs of reimbursement 
organizations that use quality-adjusted life years in their appraisal processes, 
we argue that current proposed quality standards are inadequate and that IUMs 
are neither robust nor appropriate mechanisms for estimating utilities for use 
in cost-effectiveness analyses.

[Management of cerebral small vessel disease for the diagnosis and treatment of 
dementia].

[Article in Japanese]

Cardiovascular Center, Japan.

With the demographic shift in life expectancy inexorably increasing in developed 
countries, dementia is set to become one of the most important health problems 
worldwide. In recent years, cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) has received 
much attention as an important cause of dementia. The reason for this is 
twofold: firstly, arteriosclerosis (type 1 SVD) is the leading cause of vascular 
cognitive impairment, and secondly, cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA; type 2 
SVD) is an almost invariable accompaniment of Alzheimer's disease. SVD is known 
to induce a variety of pathological changes; for example, type 1 SVD results in 
lacunar infarction, deep microbleeds, and white matter damage, while type 2 SVD 
leads to cortical microinfarcts, lobar microbleeds, and white matter damage. SVD 
is considered a spectrum of abnormalities, with the majority of patients 
experiencing symptoms from both type 1 and type 2 SVD as the disease progresses. 
The discouraging results of immunotherapy clinical trials for Alzheimer's 
disease have shifted the scientific attention from the classical neuron-centric 
approach towards a novel neurovascular approach. As arteries stiffen with age or 
with other co-morbid factors such as life-related diseases, amyloid β (Aβ) 
synthesis becomes upregulated, resulting in the deposition of insoluble Aβ not 
only in the parenchyma as senile plaques but also in the perivascular drainage 
pathways as CAA. Therefore, therapeutic strategies such as vasoactive drugs that 
enhance the patency of this Aβ drainage pathway may facilitate Aβ removal and 
help prevent cognitive decline in the elderly. Based on this emerging paradigm, 
clinical trials are warranted to investigate whether a neurovascular therapeutic 
approach can effectively halt cognitive decline and act as a preemptive medicine 
for patients at risk of dementia.

Improving life expectancy: how many years behind has the USA fallen? A 
cross-national comparison among high-income countries from 1958 to 2007.

Verguet S(1), Jamison DT.

Author information:
(1)Department of Global Health, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, 
USA.

OBJECTIVE: Many studies have documented higher mortality levels in the USA 
compared to other high-income nations. We add to this discussion by quantifying 
how many years behind comparison countries the USA has fallen and by identifying 
when US mortality rates began to diverge.
DESIGN: We use full life tables, for men and women, for 17 high-income countries 
including the USA. We extract the life expectancy at birth and compute the 
mortality rates for each 5-year age group from birth up to age 80. Using the 
metric of how many 'years behind' a country has fallen, we compare US mortality 
levels with those in other high-income countries ('comparators').
RESULTS: We report life expectancy for 17 high-income countries, for the period 
1958-2007. Up to the late 1970s, US men and especially women closely tracked 
comparators in life expectancy. In the late 1970s in the USA, most strikingly 
women began to diverge from comparators so that the US female life expectancy in 
2007 corresponded to that of the comparators' average 10 years earlier. 
Mortality rates also began to diverge from the late 1970s, and the largest 
mortality gap was in the 15-49 age group, for both men and women, where the USA 
had fallen about 40 years behind the comparators by 2007.
CONCLUSIONS: Some causes proposed for the relatively high US mortality 
today-racial differences, lack of universal health insurance, US 
exceptionalism-changed little while the mortality gap emerged and grew. This 
suggests that explanations for the growing gap lie elsewhere. Quantification of 
how many years behind the USA has fallen can help provide clues about where to 
look for potential causes and remedies.

Introduction to aortic stenosis.

Carabello BA(1).

blaseanthony.carabello@med.va.gov

Aortic stenosis is perhaps the most common of all valvular heart diseases in the 
developed nations of the world. Once primarily caused by rheumatic fever, the 
most common pathogenesis today is an active inflammatory process with some 
features that are similar to atherosclerosis. Because of this shift, the age at 
onset of severe obstruction has changed from the sixth decade 50 years ago to 
the eighth decade in most individuals today. The onset of symptoms remains a key 
determinant of outcome, although the later age at onset may make it difficult to 
discern if aortic stenosis or other age-related comorbidities is the cause of 
the symptoms. Once symptoms of aortic stenosis develop, life expectancy is 
shortened to ≈3 years unless the mechanical obstruction to left ventricular 
outflow is relieved by aortic valve replacement. Traditionally performed during 
cardiac surgery, aortic valve replacement now may be performed safely and 
effectively using transcatheter techniques, potentially revolutionizing the 
approach to this potentially fatal disease.

Comment in
    Clin J Am Soc Nephrol. 2013 Aug;8(8):1276-8.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Patients with kidney failure sometimes do not receive 
chronic renal replacement therapy (RRT), even though this may reduce their life 
expectancy. This study aimed to identify factors associated with initiation of 
chronic RRT.
DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: This cohort study was conducted 
with Albertans aged >18 years between May 2002 and March 2009, using linked data 
from the provincial renal programs, clinical laboratories, and provincial health 
ministry. This study focused on those who developed kidney failure, defined by 
an estimated GFR (eGFR) <15 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) at last measurement during 
follow-up, together with prior CKD (eGFR <60 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) at least 90 
days earlier). Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to 
determine factors significantly associated with initiation of chronic RRT.
RESULTS: In total, 7901 participants had eGFR <15 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) at last 
measurement. After adjustment, older participants were less likely to initiate 
chronic RRT. Remote residence location, dementia, and metastatic cancer also 
decreased the likelihood of initiating RRT. The cumulative probability of 
initiating RRT during follow-up was 76.8% for urban-dwelling men aged <50 years 
without comorbidity, but was only 3.2% among remote-dwelling women aged ≥70 
years with dementia and metastatic cancer. In contrast, patients with diabetes 
and heavy/severe proteinuria were more likely to initiate chronic RRT.
CONCLUSIONS: There is substantial variability in the likelihood of RRT 
initiation for patients with eGFR <15 ml/min per 1.73 m(2). Further studies are 
needed to delineate factors that influence this outcome.

Bariatric surgery developed in the late 1970 to treat severe hyperlipidemias in 
overweight individuals, not necessarily obese. Several techniques have been 
developed, and the concept has come first of a surgery for morbid obesity, then 
of a cure for diabetes in morbid obesity. There are other aspects of bariatric 
surgery that deserve attention, beyond BMI and diabetes, such as hypertension, 
poor life expectancy, increased prevalence of cancer, congestive heart failure, 
social inadequacy. The aim of this presentation is to review some recent 
development in clinical research, in the fields of liver steatosis, ferritin 
metabolism, and cholesterol metabolism. Liver steatosis, also called fatty liver 
encompasses a graduation of diseases with different clinical relevance and 
prognosis. NAFLD correlates with atherosclerosis, insulin resistance and 
diabetes mellitus. There is now evidence that weight loss, obtained through diet 
or restrictive surgery, reduces the prevalence (and the severity) of NAFLD. An 
other issue is represented by serum ferritin concentrations, that are strongly 
associated with fibrosis, portal and lobular inflammation in NAFLD patients, 
especially in the presence of obesity. Body iron contributes to excess oxidative 
stress already at non iron overload concentrations. Moreover, serum ferritin is 
an important and independent predictor of the development of diabetes. Weight 
loss is accompanied by reduction of ferritin, more after restrictive than 
malabsorptive surgery. Metabolic changes are greater after malabsorptive or 
mixed surgery than after purely restrictive surgery, and this has been ascribed 
to a greater weight loss. Studies comparing the two kinds of surgery indicate 
that, for the same amount of weight loss, decrease of cholesterol is greater 
with the former than with the latter techniques, and this difference is mainly 
due to a greater reduction of intestinal absorption of cholesterol. In the 
choice of surgery for the single patient, among other aspects, malabsorptive 
surgery seems to be more indicated in subjects with hyperlipidemia, especially 
with high cholesterol levels.

Publisher: La cirugía bariátrica se desarrolló a finales de la década de los 70 
para tratar la hiperlipidemia severa en personas con sobrepeso, no 
necesariamente obesos. A lo largo de los años se han desarrollado varias 
técnicas quirúrgicas que han sido utilizadas en primer lugar en la obesidad 
mórbida y posteriormente en el tratamiento de la diabetes. Hay otros aspectos de 
la cirugía bariátrica que merecen atención más allá del IMC y la diabetes, como 
la hipertensión, la pobre esperanza de vida, una mayor prevalencia de cáncer, 
insuficiencia cardíaca e inadaptación social. El objetivo de este artículo es 
revisar los recientes avances clínicos en campos de investigación relacionados 
con la esteatosis hepática, el metabolismo de ferritina y el metabolismo del 
colesterol. La esteatosis hepática, también llamada hígado graso abarca una 
serie de las enfermedades con diferente pronóstico y relevancia clínica. El 
Hígado Graso No Alcohólico (NAFLD siglas en ingles) se correlaciona con la 
aterosclerosis, resistencia a la insulina y diabetes mellitus. Hoy en día 
existen evidencias de que la pérdida de peso que se obtiene a través de la dieta 
o cirugía restrictiva, reduce la prevalencia (y la gravedad) de la NAFLD. Otro 
tema de estudio incluye las concentraciones de ferritina sérica, que están 
fuertemente asociadas con la fibrosis e inflamación lobular y portal en 
pacientes con NAFLD, especialmente en presencia de obesidad. El exceso de hierro 
corporal en obesos contribuye a un aumento del estrés oxidativo debido a una 
sobrecarga en su concentración. Por otra parte, la ferritina sérica es un 
indicador importante e independiente del desarrollo de la diabetes. La pérdida 
de peso se acompaña de una disminución de la ferritina. Esta disminución es más
