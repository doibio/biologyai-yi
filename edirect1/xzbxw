RESULTS: Total 218 (87%) younger patients and 33 (13%) older patients who 
underwent ACDF were analyzed. Both the groups demonstrated a significant 
improvement in PROs 2-year following surgery. The older patients had a lower 
mean cumulative gain in QALYs compared to younger patients at 1 year (0.141 vs. 
0.28, P = 0.05) and 2 years (0.211 vs. 0.424, P = 0.04). There was no 
significant difference in the mean total 2-year cost between older [$21,041 (95% 
CI $18,466-$23,616)] and younger [$22,669 (95% CI $$21,259-$24,079)] patients 
(P = 0.27). Two-year cost per QALY gained in older vs. younger patients was 
($99,720/QALYs gained vs. ($53,464/QALYs gained, P = 0.68).
CONCLUSION: ACDF surgery provided a significant gain in health-state utility in 
older patients with degenerative cervical pathology, with a mean cumulative 
2-year cost per QALY gained of $99,720/QALY. While older patients have a 
slightly higher cost utility compared to their younger counterparts, surgery in 
the older cohort does provide a significant improvement in pain, disability, and 
quality-of-life outcomes.

One of the major drivers of change in the practice of cardiology is population 
change. This article discusses the current debate about epidemiologic transition 
paired with other ongoing transitions with direct relevance to cardiovascular 
conditions. Challenges specific to patterns of risk factors over time; readiness 
for disease surveillance and meeting global targets; health system, prevention, 
and treatment efforts; and physiologic traits and human-environment interactions 
are identified. This article concludes that a focus on the most populated 
regions of the world will contribute substantially to protecting the large gains 
in global survival and life expectancy accrued over the last decades.

BACKGROUND: Recovery can be understood as a subjective process guided by 
personal expectations, goals and hopes. The aim of the study was to explore how 
persons using a Community Mental Health Centre (CMHC) experienced that their 
expectations for treatment, and goals and hopes for recovery were supported by 
the health professionals during treatment.
METHODS: Employing a hermeneutic-phenomenological approach, eight service users 
were interviewed about their expectations for treatment and their goals and 
hopes for recovery at the start of their contact with health professionals at a 
CMHC. Two years later, they were re-interviewed about their experiences of 
treatment and support from the health professionals in their work towards these 
goals and hopes. A collaborative approach was adopted. A co-researcher with 
lived experience took part in all stages of the study. Data were analysed by 
means of a data-driven stepwise approach in line with thematic analysis.
RESULTS: Five themes reflecting how participants experienced support from health 
professionals at the CMHC in their work towards their recovery goals were 
elicited, as follows: developing an understanding of oneself and one's mental 
health problems; learning how to change feelings and behaviours; being 'pushed' 
into social arenas; finding helpful medication; and counselling in family, 
practical and financial issues. The participants' expectations about counselling 
with regard to longer-term family, practical, and financial challenges were 
insufficiently met by the CMHC. In the experience of the service users, recovery 
occurred within the context of their everyday life with or without the support 
of their professional helpers.
CONCLUSIONS: To facilitate recovery, health professionals should acknowledge the 
service user's personal goals and hopes and take a more comprehensive and 
longer-term approach to his or her needs and desires. Acknowledging and 
facilitating recovery goals by offering counselling with regard to family, 
practical and financial issues seems particularly important.

BACKGROUND: Modern combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) has improved 
survival for people living with HIV (PLWHIV). Non-AIDS comorbidities have 
replaced opportunistic infections as leading causes of mortality and morbidity, 
and are becoming a key health concern as this population continues to age. The 
aim of this study is to estimate the prevalence and incidence of non-AIDS 
comorbidity among PLWHIV in Denmark in the cART era and to determine risk 
factors contributing to the pathogenesis. The study primarily targets 
cardiovascular, respiratory, and hepatic non-AIDS comorbidity.
METHODS/DESIGN: The Copenhagen comorbidity in HIV-infection (COCOMO) study is an 
observational, longitudinal cohort study. The study was initiated in 2015 and 
recruitment is ongoing with the aim of including 1500 PLWHIV from the Copenhagen 
area. Follow-up examinations after 2 and 10 years are planned. Uninfected 
controls are derived from the Copenhagen General Population Study (CGPS), a 
cohort study including 100,000 uninfected participants from the same 
geographical region. Physiological and biological measures including blood 
pressure, ankle-brachial index, electrocardiogram, spirometry, exhaled nitric 
oxide, transient elastography of the liver, computed tomography (CT) angiography 
of the heart, unenhanced CT of the chest and upper abdomen, and a number of 
routine biochemical analysis are uniformly collected in participants from the 
COCOMO study and the CGPS. Plasma, serum, buffy coat, peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells (PBMC), urine, and stool samples are collected in a biobank 
for future studies. Data will be updated through periodical linking to national 
databases.
DISCUSSION: As life expectancy for PLWHIV improves, it is essential to study 
long-term impact of HIV and cART. We anticipate that findings from this cohort 
study will increase knowledge on non-AIDS comorbidity in PLWHIV and identify 
targets for future interventional trials. Recognizing the demographic, clinical 
and pathophysiological characteristics of comorbidity in PLWHIV may help inform 
development of new guidelines and enable us to move forward to a more 
personalized HIV care.

The anatomical organization of African Mormyrids' brain is a clear example of 
departure from the average brain morphotype in teleosts, probably related to 
functional specialization associated to electrosensory processing and 
sensory-motor coordination. The brain of Mormyrids is characterized by a 
well-developed rhombencephalic electrosensory lobe interconnected with 
relatively large mesencephalic torus semicircularis and optic tectum, and a huge 
and complex cerebellum. This unique morphology might imply cell addition from 
extraventricular proliferation zones up to late developmental stages. Here we 
studied the ontogeny of these brain regions in Mormyrus rume proboscirostris 
from embryonic to adult stages by classical histological techniques and 3D 
reconstruction, and analyzed the spatial-temporal distribution of proliferating 
cells, using pulse type BrdU labeling. Brain morphogenesis and maturation 
progressed in rostral-caudal direction, from 4day old free embryos, through 
larvae, to juveniles whose brain almost attained adult morphological complexity. 
The change in the relative size of the telencephalon, and mesencephalic and 
rhombencephalic brain regions suggest a developmental shift in the relative 
importance of visual and electrosensory modalities. In free embryos, 
proliferating cells densely populated the lining of the ventricular system. 
During development, ventricular proliferating cells decreased in density and 
extension of distribution, constituting ventricular proliferation zones. The 
first recognizable one was found at the optic tectum of free embryos. Several 
extraventricular proliferation zones were found in the cerebellar divisions of 
larvae, persisting along life. Adult M. rume proboscirostris showed scarce 
ventricular but profuse cerebellar proliferation zones, particularly at the 
subpial layer of the valvula cerebelli, similar to lagomorphs. This might 
indicate that adult cerebellar proliferation is a conserved vertebrate feature.

BACKGROUND: Previous studies of the outcome after perineal stapled prolapse 
resection (PSPR) have included a limited number of patients with a short 
follow-up and high recurrence rates. The present study was designed to assess 
the initial results, complications, recurrence rate, and outcomes up to 4 years 
after PSPR, as well as the need for a repeated procedure.
METHODS: Fifty-four consecutive patients with rectal prolapse (mean age 
77.2 years, range 46-93 years; n = 3 men) were selected for PSPR between May 
2009 and February 2015. Prolapse length was measured at baseline and after 
surgery. Patients were asked to grade intensity of symptoms as a satisfaction 
score of 1-10, 10 representing being symptom-free.
RESULTS: The mean operation time was 45.3 min (SD = 17.5, range 25-95 min). The 
mean rectal prolapse length was reduced significantly from 9.5 cm (SD = 5.0, 
range 4-30 cm) to 1.2 cm (SD = 2.6, range 0-10 cm; p < 0.0001). Bleeding 
requiring surgical intervention occurred in two patients (3.7%). Postoperative 
satisfaction score increased from a mean of 2.2 (SD = 0.9) to a mean of 6.4 
(SD = 2.8, p ≤ 0.0001). After a mean follow-up of 13.4 months (SD = 14.1), six 
patients with recurrence underwent a new PSPR and five patients underwent 
colostomy, mainly because of incontinence, resulting in a recurrence rate of 
20.4%. There were no complications after redo PSPR, and after a median of 
10-month follow-up (range 6-37), there were no recurrences.
CONCLUSIONS: PSPR is a rather new surgical procedure for external rectal 
prolapse. Immediate complications are few and not serious. Although recurrences 
can be treated with a second PSPR, the operation may only be the best option for 
old and fragile patients with comorbidities and a short life expectancy.

BACKGROUND: In order to evaluate the health status of a population, besides 
indicators measuring the incidence of diseases and deaths, potential measures 
are becoming more frequently used, ie. measures that take into account life-time 
potential of the individuals in the population. They can particularly by applied 
to analyse the problem of premature mortality, which is measured by lost life 
years.
AIM: The aim of the study was to evaluate life years lost due to diseases of 
digestive system in Polish population in 2013.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was based on a dataset containing 387,312 death 
certificates of Poles who died in 2013, provided by the Central Statistical 
Office in Poland. Data on deaths caused by diseases of digestive system (K00-K93 
by ICD-10) were used in the study – that were 16,543 records (4.3% of all the 
deaths). Lost life years were assessed with the measures: SEYLL (Standard 
Expected Years of Life Lost), SEYLLp (Standard Expected Years of Life Lost per 
living person), SEYLLd (Standard Expected Years of Life Lost per death).
RESULTS: In the analysed year among men there were 9,275 deaths caused by 
diseases of digestive system and in women 7,268 deaths. SEYLL in the group of 
men amounted to 102 230.7 and in the group of women it was 53,475.5. The number 
of lost life years calculated per 10 000 male inhabitants was 54.9, and for 
10,000 females it was 26.9. The highest share in lost life years had alcoholic 
liver disease (SEYLLp for men – 20.87, for women – 6.1), fibrosis and cirrhosis 
of the liver (SEYLLp for men- 9.7, for women- 5.6) and acute pancreatitis 
(SEYLLp for men – 5.3, for women – 2.1).
CONCLUSIONS: The results of the study indicate that diseases of digestive system 
have an important contribution to the loss of life-time potential in Polish 
population (6.6% of all SEYLL in 2013). The dominant role in this class of 
diseases played alcoholic liver disease – K70, fibrosis and cirrhosis of the 
liver – K74 and acute pancreatitis – K85.

Primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma is characterized by a high chance of cure, 
and cured patients have a long disease-free life-expectancy; however, prognosis 
is severe in the case of relapsed or refractory disease. The initial use of the 
most effective chemoimmunotherapy regimen is therefore crucial. Understanding 
who will benefit from postinduction radiotherapy is also of paramount 
importance; positron emission tomography may be a reliable guide for physicians 
in determining which patients will require consolidation. New drugs with 
mechanisms of action including the most relevant biologic features of the tumor 
may allow better disease control.

OBJECTIVES: As life expectancy for women with cystic fibrosis (CF) improves, 
reproductive decision-making is becoming increasingly relevant. We sought to 
characterize fertility intentions, contraceptive use, and preferences among 
adult females with CF.
STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a cross-sectional survey of contraceptive use and 
preferences in reproductive-aged women with CF. Subjects were recruited via an 
electronic mailing list from the Penn Adult Cystic Fibrosis Program.
RESULTS: Fifty-three women with CF responded and met eligibility criteria. Most 
(83%) were sexually active, however only 49% used contraception. Condoms and the 
oral contraceptive pill were the most commonly used methods. Compared to the 
national contraceptive use among Caucasian women (65%), use in our cohort was 
significantly lower (p = 0.01). Participants prioritized effectiveness and ease 
of use in their contraceptive method; they wanted to avoid side effects and 
interference with sexual enjoyment. Although these priorities are similar to 
Caucasian women in the literature, additional contraceptive priorities differed 
significantly between the groups.
CONCLUSIONS: This CF cohort is sexually active but contraceptive utilization was 
low, and women with CF identify specific contraceptive preferences. There is a 
significant unmet need for contraception among women with CF.

The extension of life expectancy is a global phenomenon. The growth in the 
ageing population has created a new health scenario in which there is a higher 
prevalence of frailty and multimorbidity. The attention received by both 
conditions derives from their strong association with disability, 
hospitalization, and death. The aim of the present paper is to conceptualize and 
differentiate these terms and to discuss their interrelations. We conclude that, 
yet related, they represent two different clinical conditions. Frailty 
identifies the increased vulnerability to stressors due to a dynamic, 
non-linear, and multidimensional depletion of physiological reserve and 
redundancy, whereas multimorbidity refers to the coexistence of two or more 
clinically manifest chronic diseases.

The widespread availability of effective antiretroviral therapy (ART) has 
transformed HIV from a life-limiting condition to one with near-normal life 
expectancy. HIV is associated with an increased risk of osteopenia and 
osteoporosis, with people living with HIV (PLHIV) potentially experiencing these 
conditions at a younger age than their HIV-negative counterparts. The mechanisms 
driving bone disease in HIV are complex and include: an increased prevalence of 
traditional risk factors; other comorbid conditions; and HIV-associated factors 
such as viral effects, systemic inflammation, and ART-related factors. One-third 
of PLHIV in the United Kingdom are female, and increasing numbers of women 
living with HIV (WLHIV) are reaching menopausal age. Oestrogen decline in the 
context of an elevated background risk of poor bone health results in WLHIV 
being at greater risk of osteoporosis than women without HIV. European HIV 
guidelines therefore recommend routine screening of postmenopausal WLHIV using 
FRAX© for clinical risk factors, with or without bone mineral density scanning. 
Data support the use of calcium and vitamin D supplementation, and 
bisphosphonates in the treatment of osteoporosis in PLHIV. Additionally, some 
patients with confirmed osteoporosis may benefit from a switch to an ART agent 
with a better bone safety profile. However, there remains a notable paucity of 
data on HIV and menopause, including the impact of hormone replacement therapy 
on the bone health of WLHIV. In conclusion, it is important that clinicians are 
aware that postmenopausal WLHIV are a group at particular risk of bone disease, 
who require proactive screening and advice about preventative measures.

BACKGROUND: The study of stigma's influence on health has surged in recent 
years. Hatzenbuehler et al.'s (2014) study of structural stigma's effect on 
mortality revealed an average of 12 years' shorter life expectancy for sexual 
minorities who resided in communities thought to exhibit high levels of anti-gay 
prejudice, using data from the 1988-2002 administrations of the US General 
Social Survey linked to mortality outcome data in the 2008 National Death Index.
METHODS: In the original study, the key predictor variable (structural stigma) 
led to results suggesting the profound negative influence of structural stigma 
on the mortality of sexual minorities. Attempts to replicate the study, in order 
to explore alternative hypotheses, repeatedly failed to generate the original 
study's key finding on structural stigma. Efforts to discern the source of the 
disparity in results revealed complications in the multiple imputation process 
for missing values of the components of structural stigma. This prompted efforts 
at replication using 10 different imputation approaches.
RESULTS: Efforts to replicate Hatzenbuehler et al.'s (2014) key finding on 
structural stigma's notable influence on the premature mortality of sexual 
minorities, including a more refined imputation strategy than described in the 
original study, failed. No data imputation approach yielded parameters that 
supported the original study's conclusions. Alternative hypotheses, which 
originally motivated the present study, revealed little new information.
CONCLUSION: Ten different approaches to multiple imputation of missing data 
yielded none in which the effect of structural stigma on the mortality of sexual 
minorities was statistically significant. Minimally, the original study's 
structural stigma variable (and hence its key result) is so sensitive to 
subjective measurement decisions as to be rendered unreliable.

Triatominae are blood-sucking insects that localise their hosts using a range of 
sensory signals to find food, and among them, the heat emitted by the hosts. 
Heat is one of the main short-range cues in vertebrate hosts, able to trigger 
alone the Proboscis Extension Response (PER) that precedes the bite. Previous 
studies demonstrated that heat responsiveness of fifth-instar nymphs is maximum 
to moderate temperatures (30-35°C) compatible with those of their vertebrate 
host's body surface. This study investigated whether this thermal preference for 
biting is maintained along the life cycle of R. prolixus, from the first larval 
instar to male and female adults. The results showed that PER rates were at 
maximum around 30-35°C and decreased for a warmer temperature. The same thermal 
preference was maintained all along the life cycle, despite the increase in the 
size of the antennae linked to the growth. Interestingly, a decreased thermal 
responsiveness was stated in males as compared with larval instars and females. 
This decrease might reveal a lower motivation for host-seeking and might have an 
impact on males's vectorial competence.

BACKGROUND: The surgical tactics in cases of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) 
and intra-abdominal malignancy are not uniform in the literature and are still a 
matter of debate. In this case report, we present a patient with coexisting AAA 
and primary liver cancer managed by simultaneous open AAA repair and liver 
resection After laparotomy and intraoperative liver ultrasonography that 
confirmed resectability of the tumor, aneurysm repair was performed with 
aorto-aortic tube grafting after interrenal cross-clamping 
Radiofrequency-assisted liver transection was performed to complete an anterior 
anatomic resection of liver segments VI and VII. The postoperative course was 
uneventful and the patient was discharged on a postoperative day 10.
METHODS: This was prospective follow up of one patient.
RESULTS: The patient is free from disease at 18-month follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: The best treatment strategy for patients with AAA and malignant 
disease is still not clearly defined. Strategy selection is made individually 
according to the risk of rupture of AAA, general condition of the patient, 
experience of the teams that should perform the procedure and estimated life 
expectancy after resection of malignant disease.

Adolescent smokers are more likely to be addicted to nicotine and develop a 
chronic habit. Chronic smoking has a direct impact on quality of life and life 
expectancy. Repeated environmental exposure and smoke inhalation can be 
deleterious to health. In order to evaluate the core functioning of the lungs, 
Pulmonary Function Tests (PFTs) are conducted. This panel of tests should be 
advised for all patients complaining of shortness of breath. Since clinical 
features resulting from chronic smoking tend to appear late in the course of the 
disease, PFTs are immensely useful for early identification of abnormalities in 
asymptomatic adult smokers. Numerous studies have shown that normal PFT 
parameters begin to deteriorate immediately after smoking is initiated. However, 
most physicians prefer to wait for characteristic signs and symptoms of Chronic 
Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) to develop before proceeding with PFTs in 
the patients. This leads to inadvertent and often dangerous delay in reaching a 
definitive diagnosis and initiating treatment. Therefore, we undertook this 
review to determine whether conducting PFTs in asymptomatic adult smokers can 
facilitate the early detection and/or prevention of COPD. We reviewed and 
analyzed articles from PubMed, Google Scholar, Index Medicus, WHO Global Health 
Library and Scopus, which specifically demonstrated the presence of abnormal PFT 
changes in asymptomatic adult smokers. With PFTs, we now have the advantage of 
diagnosing early changes in the lung volumes. Hence, we conclude that PFTs 
should be performed early in smokers and cessation of smoking should be 
encouraged to check the increasing incidence of COPD.

Situs inversus is a rare congenital anomaly, which is characterized by right 
sided heart (Dextrocardia) and inversely rotated visceral organs of abdomen. In 
present case, the patient reported with G3p2l2, 34 weeks of gestational period 
along with breathlessness accompanied and labour pains. On further 
investigation, she was diagnosed as dextrocardia with situs inversus and 
moderate pulmonary artery hypertension along with severe iron deficiency 
anaemia. Patient had normal vaginal delivery with intra-partum and post-partum 
period. Normally, any patient having situs inversus has a normal life expectancy 
and is not associated with any significant morbidity or mortality.

CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: CLPB (caseinolytic peptidase B) deficiency is 
characterized by neurologic involvement and neutropenia, which can range from 
severe to mild. In severe CLPB deficiency, death usually occurs at a few months 
of age due to significant neonatal neurologic involvement (hyperekplexia or 
absence of voluntary movements, hypotonia or hypertonia, swallowing problems, 
respiratory insufficiency, and epilepsy) and severe neutropenia associated with 
life-threatening infections. Individuals with moderate CLPB deficiency present 
with neurologic abnormalities in infancy including hypotonia and feeding 
problems, and develop spasticity, a progressive movement disorder (ataxia, 
dystonia, and/or dyskinesia), epilepsy, and intellectual disability. Neutropenia 
is variable, but not life threatening. In those with mild CLPB deficiency there 
is no neurologic involvement, intellect is normal, neutropenia is mild and 
intermittent, and life expectancy is normal.
DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The diagnosis of CLPB deficiency is established in a proband 
by identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in CLPB or identification of 
one of several specific heterozygous CLPB pathogenic variants associated with 
autosomal dominant CLPB deficiency on molecular genetic testing.
MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: Treatment is supportive. A 
multidisciplinary team including a metabolic physician, pediatric neurologist, 
dietitian, and physical therapist is recommended. No specific dietary or 
metabolic treatment is available. Feeding therapy; gastrostomy tube placement 
for persistent feeding issues; treatment of seizures per neurologist; management 
of movement disorder per orthopedist, physical medicine and rehabilitation 
specialist, physical therapist, and occupational therapist; botulinum toxin 
injection in the salivary glands, extirpation of saliva glands, and/or rerouting 
of glandular ducts for excessive drooling; developmental support including early 
intervention (physical therapy, occupational therapy, and/or speech therapy) and 
special education services; granulocyte-colony stimulating factor to increase 
neutrophil counts to reduce the frequency of infections, especially in 
individuals with the mild or moderate phenotype; standard immunizations to 
prevent infections; treatment of cataracts per ophthalmologist; treatment of 
endocrine dysfunction per endocrinologist; treatment of renal disease per renal 
specialist; consider hematopoietic stem cell transplant in those without severe 
neurologic disease. Surveillance: At each visit: assess for seizures, changes in 
tone, and movement disorders; assess growth, feeding, developmental progress, 
mobility, and family needs; measure white blood cell count with differential. 
Ophthalmology examination with frequency per ophthalmologist. Annually: TSH to 
assess thyroid function; assessment of gonadal function in females (beginning at 
age 10 years). Agents/circumstances to avoid: Drugs potentially toxic to 
mitochondria, including chloramphenicol, aminoglycosides, linezolid, valproic 
acid, and nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors.
GENETIC COUNSELING: CLPB deficiency associated with biallelic CLPB pathogenic 
variants is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. CLPB deficiency 
associated with specific heterozygous CLPB pathogenic variants is inherited in 
an autosomal dominant manner. Autosomal recessive CLPB deficiency. If both 
parents are known to be heterozygous for a CLPB pathogenic variant associated 
with autosomal recessive CLPB deficiency, each sib of an affected individual has 
at conception a 25% chance of inheriting biallelic pathogenic variants and being 
affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of 
inheriting neither of the familial CLPB pathogenic variants. Carrier testing for 
at-risk relatives requires prior identification of the CLPB pathogenic variants 
in the family. Autosomal dominant CLPB deficiency. All individuals reported to 
date with autosomal dominant CLPB deficiency have the disorder as the result of 
a de novo CLPB pathogenic variant. Each child of an individual with a 
heterozygous CLPB pathogenic variant has a 50% chance of inheriting the 
pathogenic variant. Once the CLPB pathogenic variant(s) have been identified in 
an affected family member, prenatal and preimplantation genetic testing for CLPB 
deficiency are possible.

Impact of Adjuvant Chemotherapy in Elderly Breast Patients in Taiwan, A 
Hospital-Based Study.

Purpose: Decisions as to whether to provide adjuvant treatment in older breast 
cancer patients remains challenging. Side effects of chemotherapy have to be 
weighed against life expectancy, comorbidities, functional status, and frailty. 
To aid decision-making, we retrospectively analyzed 110 women with breast cancer 
treated with a curative intention from 2006 to 2012. Survival data with clinical 
and pathological parameters were evaluated to address the role of adjuvant 
chemotherapy in this study population. Method: A total of 110 elderly (>70 
years) patients that received mastectomy at two hospitals in Taiwan were 
observed retrospectively for a medium of 51 months. After mastectomy, patients 
received conservative treatment or adjuvant chemotherapy, or hormone therapy 
following clinical guidelines or physician’s preference. Data were collected 
from the cancer registry system. Results: Median age at diagnosis was 75.7 
years. Thirty-five percent of patients received adjuvant chemotherapy, these 
having a significantly younger age (mean=74.0±5.3 vs 77.5±5.3, p<0.001) and 
higher tumor staging (p=0.003) compared with their non-chemotherapy 
counterparts.Five-year overall survival was non-significantly higher in patients 
who received adjuvant chemotherapy (with chemotherapy 64.2% vs without 
chemotherapy 62.6%, p=0.635), while five-year recurrence free survival was 
non-significantly lower (with chemotherapy 64.1% vs without chemotherapy 90.5%, 
p=0.80). Conclusions: In this analysis, adjuvant chemotherapy tended to be given 
to patients with a younger age and higher tumor staging at our institute. It was 
not associated with any statistically significant improvement in survival and 
recurrence rate. Until age specific recommendations are available, physicians 
must use their clinical judgment and assess the tumor biology with the patient’s 
comorbidities to make the best choice. Clinical trials focusing on this critical 
issue are warranted.

Surveillance Mammography in Older Patients With Breast Cancer-Can We Ever Stop?: 
A Review.

IMPORTANCE: Approximately 4% to 5% of breast cancer survivors will develop a new 
ipsilateral or contralateral cancer (in-breast event) over the 5 years following 
diagnosis, and annual surveillance mammography is recommended for those with 
residual breast tissue. The risk for such in-breast events persists over time, 
though increasing age at cancer diagnosis and treatment with hormonal therapy 
are associated with lower risk, and most older survivors of breast cancer will 
ultimately die from nonbreast cancer-related causes. Specific guidelines for 
surveillance strategies in older patients are limited. Prospective data on the 
benefits and harms of surveillance mammography in this population are lacking, 
and most of the evidence is derived from observational, retrospective data, 
often in the general population.
OBSERVATIONS: We review the current recommendations for breast cancer screening 
and surveillance for older patients, the current evidence for ipsilateral and 
contralateral breast cancer risks in older survivors of breast cancer, and 
suggested approaches for discussions about surveillance mammography with older 
patients. We recommend individualized decision making for surveillance breast 
imaging in older survivors of breast cancer, with consideration of the following 
strategy for women 70 years or older: 1-time imaging 6 to 12 months after 
completion of local therapy followed by annual or biennial surveillance 
mammography for healthy women and cessation of mammography in patients whose 
life expectancy is less than 5 years to 10 years, regardless of age. Decisions 
on mammographic surveillance should also incorporate whether hormonal therapy is 
being administered, whether a patient's anticipated life expectancy is 
extraordinary, and whether a patient's individual risk for in-breast events is 
higher (or lower) than average risk for breast cancer survivors.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: We propose reframing discussions around surveillance 
mammography in older breast cancer survivors and to consider cessation while 
taking into account life expectancy, the estimated risk for subsequent in-breast 
events, and patient preferences.

Miller School of Medicine, Miami, Florida, United States.

PURPOSE: To evaluate the global patterns in health burden of uncorrected 
refractive error (URE) by year, age and sex, region, and socioeconomic status, 
using disability-adjusted life years (DALYs).
METHODS: Global, regional, or national DALY numbers, crude DALY rates, and 
age-standardized DALY rates caused by URE, by year, or age and sex, were 
obtained from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013. Human development index 
(HDI) in 2013 as a national socioeconomic indicator was obtained from the Human 
Development Report. Kruskal-Wallis test and linear regression were performed to 
explore the association between age-standardized DALY rates and HDI.
RESULTS: From 1990 to 2013, global DALY numbers caused by URE rose by 43.8%, 
crude rates remained relatively constant, and age-standardized rates fell by 
8.8%. Global DALY rates increased with age, and older females had higher DALY 
numbers and rates than males of the same age. Age-standardized DALY rates in 
Eastern Mediterranean, South-East Asia, and Africa were higher than that at a 
global level. Multiple comparisons indicated higher age-standardized DALY rates 
in lower HDI countries. Age-standardized DALY rates were inversely related to 
HDI (standardized β = -0.616, P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: The global health of URE is improving but crude DALY rates are 
keeping constant, implying that health progress does not mean fewer demands of 
refractive services. Worldwide, older age, female sex, and lower socioeconomic 
status are associated with higher URE burden. The findings of this study may 
raise public awareness of the global URE burden and are important for health 
policy making.

Confounding of the association between radiation exposure from CT scans and risk 
of leukemia and brain tumors by cancer susceptibility syndromes.

Amsterdam, The Netherlands.

Recent studies linking radiation exposure from pediatric computed tomography 
(CT) to increased risks of leukemia and brain tumors lacked data to control for 
cancer susceptibility syndromes (CSS). These syndromes might be confounders 
because they are associated with an increased cancer risk and may increase the 
likelihood of pediatric CT scans. We identify CSS predisposing to leukemia and 
brain tumors through a systematic literature search and summarize prevalence and 
risk. Since empirical evidence is lacking in published literature on patterns of 
CT use for most types of CSS, we estimate confounding bias of relative risks 
(RR) for categories of radiation exposure based on expert opinion about patterns 
of CT scans among CSS patients. We estimate that radiation-related RRs for 
leukemia are not meaningfully confounded by Down syndrome, Noonan syndrome and 
other CSS. Moreover, tuberous sclerosis complex, von Hippel-Lindau disease, 
neurofibromatosis type 1 and other CSS do not meaningfully confound RRs for 
brain tumors. Empirical data on the use of CT scans among CSS patients is 
urgently needed. Our assessment indicates that associations with radiation 
exposure from pediatric CT scans and leukemia or brain tumors reported in 
previous studies are unlikely to be substantially confounded by unmeasured CSS.
