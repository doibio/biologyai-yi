addition, presence of extreme thrombocytosis (platelets >1000 × 10(9)/L) might 
be associated with acquired von Willebrand syndrome (AvWS) and, therefore, risk 
of bleeding.
RISK-ADAPTED THERAPY: The main goal of therapy in PV and ET is to prevent 
thrombohemorrhagic complications. All patients with PV require phlebotomy to 
keep hematocrit below 45% and once-daily aspirin (81 mg). In addition, high-risk 
patients with PV require cytoreductive therapy. Very low risk ET patients might 
not require any form of therapy while low-risk patients require at least 
once-daily aspirin therapy. Cytoreductive therapy is also recommended for 
high-risk ET patients but it is not mandatory for intermediate-risk patients. 
First-line drug of choice for cytoreductive therapy, in both ET and PV, is 
hydroxyurea and second-line drugs of choice are interferon-α and busulfan. We 
currently do not recommend treatment with ruxolutinib or other JAK2 inhibitors 
in PV or ET, unless in the presence of severe and protracted pruritus or marked 
splenomegaly that is not responding to the aforementioned drugs. Screening for 
AvWS is recommended before administrating aspirin, in the presence of extreme 
thrombocytosis. Am. J. Hematol. 92:95-108, 2017. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

BACKGROUND: A significant number of women in low and middle income countries 
(L-MICs) who need any family planning, experience a lack in access to modern 
effective methods. This study was conducted to review potential cost 
effectiveness of scaling up family planning interventions in these regions from 
the published literatures and assess their implication for policy and future 
research.
STUDY DESIGN: A systematic review was performed in several electronic databases 
i.e Medline (Pubmed), Embase, Popline, The National Bureau of Economic Research 
(NBER), EBSCOHost, and The Cochrane Library. Articles reporting full economic 
evaluations of strategies to improve family planning interventions in one or 
more L-MICs, published between 1995 until 2015 were eligible for inclusion. Data 
was synthesized and analyzed using a narrative approach and the reporting 
quality of the included studies was assessed using the Consolidated Health 
Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) statement.
RESULTS: From 920 references screened, 9 studies were eligible for inclusion. 
Six references assessed cost effectiveness of improving family planning 
interventions in one or more L-MICs, while the rest assessed costs and 
consequences of integrating family planning and HIV services, concerning 
sub-Saharan Africa. Assembled evidence suggested that improving family planning 
interventions is cost effective in a variety of L-MICs as measured against 
accepted international cost effectiveness benchmarks. In areas with high HIV 
prevalence, integrating family planning and HIV services can be efficient and 
cost effective; however the evidence is only supported by a very limited number 
of studies. The major drivers of cost effectiveness were cost of increasing 
coverage, effectiveness of the interventions and country-specific factors.
CONCLUSION: Improving family planning interventions in low and middle income 
countries appears to be cost-effective. Additional economic evaluation studies 
with improved reporting quality are necessary to generate further evidence on 
costs, cost-effectiveness, and affordability, and to support increased funding 
and investments in family planning programs.

INTRODUCTION: There is hardly any information regarding years of life lost due 
to cancer in Colombia.
OBJECTIVE: To quantify total and average years of life lost due to cancer in 
Colombia, and to investigate changes in this burden between 1997 and 2012.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We obtained sex-specific data on age distribution, 
remaining life expectancy, deaths due to specific cancers and total number of 
deaths from the Colombian Departamento Administrativo Nacional de Estadísticas. 
We calculated years of life lost based on each individual´s age at death and the 
remaining life expectancy at that age; as for average years of life, we divided 
these by the number of deaths due to specific cancers.
RESULTS: The total number of cancer deaths increased by 33% between 1997 and 
2012, comprising 15% of male and 20% of female deaths in the period 2010-2012. 
Total years of life lost due to cancer increased by 25.1% for males and 31.1% 
for females over the study period. The highest increases (>40%) were observed 
for colorectal, pancreas and kidney cancers in both sexes, for melanomas and 
bladder cancer in men, and for breast and ovarian cancer in women. Trends in 
average years of life lost were stable. Almost half (48-50%) of the years of 
life lost due to childhood cancers were due to leukemia.
CONCLUSION: Cancer is an increasing health burden in Colombia. The high average 
years of life lost illustrate the poor prognosis of the disease compared to 
other countries. Primary prevention, early detection, and adequate and timely 
treatments are needed to change this situation.

INTRODUCTION: Mental disorders are the first causes of disability adjusted life 
years (DALY), contributing with the 7.4%. This value increases as the DALYs of 
the transmittable diseases decrease.
OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence and associated factors of the major 
depressive and anxious disorders.
METHODS: Data obtained from the IV Mental Health Survey with representation from 
5 regions. A computerised interview was conducted, focusing on the most frequent 
anxiety and depressive disorders, using the CIDI CAPI 3.0. A sample of 10,870 
adults over 18 years old was obtained.
RESULTS: The lifetime prevalence of any of these disorders is 10.1% (95% CI: 
8.8-11.5) in the population between 18 and 44 years, and of 7.7% (95% CI: 
6.5-9.1) in those older than 45 years. The prevalence in the last 12 months was 
5.1% (95% CI: 4.3-6.0) in the younger group, and 2.3% (95% CI: 1.8-3.0) in the 
older group. Of the people with evaluated mental disorders, 17.6% (95% CI: 
13.1-23.4) had 2 or more disorders, a comorbidity that is more common in the 
female population (20.4%, 95% CI: 14.2-28.3) than in males (13.5%, 95% CI: 
7.9-22.0). Major depressive disorder is the most prevalent of the disorders, 
with a lifetime prevalence of 4.3% (95% CI: 3.7-5.0). After adjusting in a 
multivariate model, being divorced or widowed (OR=1.3), previous suicide attempt 
(OR=3.3), and having 6 or more features of border-line personality, were 
associated with an increased risk of presenting with any of the studied 
disorders.
CONCLUSIONS: Anxiety and depressive mental disorders are an important health 
burden in Colombia.

PURPOSE: Active surveillance is a treatment option for favorable risk prostate 
cancer. However, data are missing on populations of African descent. We 
evaluated the safety and benefit of active surveillance in an African Caribbean 
cohort with favorable risk prostate cancer.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between 2005 and 2016, a single center, prospective 
cohort study was performed in Guadeloupe, French West Indies, including patients 
on active surveillance who had low risk prostate cancer (prostate specific 
antigen 10 ng/ml or less and Gleason score 6 or less) or favorable intermediate 
risk prostate cancer (prostate specific antigen 10 to 20 ng/ml, Gleason score 3 
+ 4 or less and life expectancy less than 10 years). Treatment was recommended 
in case of grade progression, increased tumor volume, prostate cancer doubling 
time less than 36 months or patient wish. Overall survival, disease specific 
survival and duration of active surveillance were calculated with the 
Kaplan-Meier method. Multivariate analysis was performed using the Cox 
proportional hazards model to identify predictors of active surveillance 
termination.
RESULTS: A total of 234 patients with a median age of 64 years were enrolled in 
study. Median followup was 4 years (IQR 2.3-5.5). Overall survival at 30 months, 
5 years and 10 years was 99.5%, 98.5% and 90.7%, respectively. Disease specific 
survival at 30 months, and 5 and 10 years was 100%. At 30 months, 5 years and 10 
years 72.7%, 52.6% and 40.4% of patients, respectively, remained untreated and 
on active surveillance. Age (HR 0.96 per additional year, 95% CI 0.93-0.99) and 
prostate specific antigen density (HR 1.52 per additional 0.1 ng/ml, 95% CI 
1.20-1.89) were found to be independent predictors of active surveillance 
termination.
CONCLUSIONS: Active surveillance is safe and beneficial for highly selected 
African Caribbean patients. It seems to be feasible for patients at low risk and 
intermediate favorable risk. Prostate specific antigen density could help better 
select these patients.

The Chinese soft-shelled turtle (Pelodiscus sinensis) is a highly important 
freshwater aquaculture species in China. The molecular mechanisms underlying 
changes in immunity and growth in hybrid vigor are not well understood. In the 
present study, the transcriptomes from significantly different P. sinensis 
strains (Qingxi black turtle, B and Japanese strain, J) and the resulting hybrid 
(Zajiao-1, F) were sequenced using an Illumina sequencing platform. 
Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between Zajiao-1 and the Qingxi black 
turtle were enriched mainly in the HTLV-I infection and Hippo signaling 
pathways, while DEGs between the Zajiao-1 and Japanese strain were enriched 
mainly in tryptophan metabolism, caner-associated pathways, transcriptional 
dysregulation in cancer, amebiasis, Fcγ-mediated phagocytosis and the peroxisome 
pathway. Highly expressed genes involved in the regulation of disorders of the 
fatty acid biosynthesis, immune and cardiovascular systems in P. sinensis were 
found among the DEGs. Enrichment categories for gene ontology included cellular 
processes, metabolic pathways, and the actin cytoskeleton pathway. The 
reliability of the sequencing data was verified through quantitative real-time 
polymerase chain reaction analysis of 20 immunity or growth-related genes. These 
findings offer new insights into heterosis of growth traits and resistance to 
stresses and potential strategies for selective breeding.

The Burden of Premature Mortality in Turkey in 2001 and 2008.

Tokuç B(1), Ayhan S(1), Saraçoğlu GV(1).

Author information:

Turkey.

BACKGROUND: Standard expected years of life lost (SEYLL) is a measure that is 
used to evaluate losses due to premature deaths.
AIMS: The present study provides an analysis of premature mortality in Turkey 
for the years 2001 and 2008 and supplies evidence for making policies and 
setting health agendas over the long term.
STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study.
METHODS: This study calculated SEYLL by gender, age group and causes of death in 
Turkey in 2014. The SEYLL measure counts the years lost in a population as a 
result of premature mortality and is computed by multiplying the number of 
deaths and standard life expectancy at the age at which death occurs.
RESULTS: The burden of premature mortality in Turkey was calculated as 4 104 253 
SEYLL and 4 472 443 SEYLL in 2001 and 2008, respectively. Among these 42.7% and 
43.9% of SEYLL were in females in 2001 and 2008, respectively. The leading five 
causes of premature mortality in the Turkish population in 2001 were 
cardiovascular system diseases (34.72%), perinatal conditions (12.69%), 
neoplasms (12.51%), external causes of injury (7.66%), and infections and 
parasitic diseases (6.57%). In 2008, the major causes were cardiovascular 
diseases (41.17%), neoplasms (14.63%), respiratory system diseases (9.81%), 
perinatal conditions (5.59%), and external causes of injury (5.29%).
CONCLUSION: The majority of the burden of premature mortality in Turkey is 
attributable to non-communicable diseases. While premature deaths from 
infections and parasitic diseases, perinatal conditions and congenital anomalies 
decreased between 2001 and 2008, deaths from cardiovascular diseases, neoplasms 
and respiratory system diseases increased dramatically. Coordinated efforts for 
effective national prevention programs (such as regular monitoring of adults for 
early diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases and for malignancies by family 
physicians) should be developed by policy makers to decrease preventable and 
premature deaths from non-communicable diseases.

Oral drugs stimulating endogenous insulin production (insulin secretagogues) may 
have detrimental effects on breast cancer outcomes. The data presented shows the 
relationship between pre-existing insulin secretagogues use, adipokine profiles 
at the time of breast cancer (BC) diagnosis and subsequent cancer outcomes in 
women diagnosed with BC and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The Pearson 
correlation analysis evaluating the relationship between adipokines stratified 
by T2DM pharmacotherapy and controls is also provided. This information is the 
extension of the data presented and discussed in "Insulin use, adipokine 
profiles and breast cancer prognosis" (Wintrob et al., in press) [1].

Mastocytosis is a rare, almost exclusively sporadically occurring disease 
involving an increase in clonal tissue mast cells. The disease spectrum is 
heterogenous, ranging from isolated skin lesions with a normal life expectancy 
to rare, aggressive forms with very poor prognosis. Children are often affected. 
But whereas these almost invariantly display solely a cutaneous mastocytosis 
with polymorphous skin lesions, in adults the lesions are small and 
maculopapular and in over 80% of cases accompanied by involvement of bone marrow 
and the D816V activating mutation of the gene for the c‑Kit receptor. There are 
many symptoms for the disease. Patients suffer frequently from pruritus, 
diarrhea, abdominal cramp, palpitations and flush. Osteoporosis is often 
present, with osteolysis with pathological fractures frequently involved in more 
aggressive forms. Patients are especially at risk to severe anaphylaxis caused 
by hymenoptera stings. Therapy is symptomatic, with cytoreductive therapy 
reserved for resistant and aggressive forms.

AIMS: Despite recent findings of increased life expectancy among individuals 
with type 1 diabetes, mortality remains greatly increased compared to the 
general population. As this is largely the result of cardiovascular and renal 
complications, we aimed to review recent findings surrounding these diseases in 
type 1 diabetes.
METHODS: We reviewed published findings concerning the cardiovascular 
complications of type 1 diabetes, with a particular focus on links with renal 
disease.
RESULTS: The cardiovascular and renal complications of type 1 diabetes share 
many features including insulin resistance, oxidative damage, and genetic 
associations with the Haptoglobin genotype, and both are strongly affected by 
glycemic control.
CONCLUSIONS: Although current knowledge on predictors of type 1 diabetes 
cardiovascular and renal complications has increased, further investigation is 
required to understand the mechanisms leading to cardio-renal complications in 
this population.

BACKGROUND: In the development of efficacious driven gait orthoses (DGO), it is 
an added value to consider patients' and therapists' perspectives concerning 
robot-assisted gait training (RAGT). A better understanding of these issues may 
improve the process of care and outcome.
OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to examine stroke patients' motivation and 
expectations of RAGT, and therapists' expectations and perspectives on the 
usability of RAGT. Additionally, the differences in expectations between stroke 
patients and their therapists were analyzed.
METHODS: A cross sectional, multi-center, three-group trial was conducted. 
Included were (1) stroke patients who have experience with RAGT (i.e. the stroke 
user group), (2) stroke patients who have no experience with RAGT (i.e. the 
stroke non-user group), and (3) therapists who have experience with RAGT (i.e. 
the therapist user group). The Intrinsic Motivation Inventory (IMI), 
Credibility/Expectancy Questionnaire (CEQ), and Usefulness, Satisfaction and 
Ease of Use Questionnaire (USE) were used. Descriptive statistics and 
non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis tests were conducted.
RESULTS: In total, 46 subjects were assessed (stroke user group: n = 23, stroke 
non-user group: n = 14, therapist user group: n = 9). IMI subscale scores ranged 
from 42 to 88%. Mean credibility and expectancy ranged from 80 to 85% and 57 to 
72%, respectively, with no significant differences between groups. USE subscale 
scores ranged from 61 to 72%.
CONCLUSIONS: Stroke user group patients seem quite motivated to train with the 
DGO and both patients and therapists reasonably believe that this training could 
improve gait functioning. Therapists are moderately satisfied with the usability 
of the DGO, but there is room for improvement with respect to usefulness and 
ease of use.

BACKGROUND: Heart disease has an impact on patient's identity and 
self-perception. Taking into account the wide literature about psychological 
aspects before and after heart transplant, it clearly emerges that there is a 
lack of data and results for patients up to implantation of ventricular assist 
devices (VAD). The aim of the present study was to explore quality of life and 
factors correlated with psychological adjustment in patients supported with VAD.
METHODS: From February 2013 to August 2014, 18 patients (17 male, mean age 57 
years) under clinical evaluation before and after VAD implantation were 
enrolled. During interviews, patients were assessed with EuroQoL-5D 
questionnaire to monitor improvement of quality of life before implantation and 
at 3 and 6 months; critical issues, needs and point of views of patients have 
been described.
RESULTS: A significant improvement in the quality of life score was observed at 
3 (score 38 [interquartile range 30-40] vs 75 [60-80], p<0.05) and 6 months (38 
[30-40] vs 70 [60-80], p<0.05). Overall, patients' psychological state 
investigated by the test showed a clear and positive trend. All patients need to 
empower through complete information about the device, related risks and life 
expectancy. Interdisciplinary approach improved compliance with therapy.
CONCLUSIONS: Successful treatment and efficient psychological care are closely 
related to assessment and continuous clinical support. This approach ensures a 
better selection of patients and improves their compliance. Further data are 
needed to support our preliminary observations and to explore long-term quality 
of life.

Effective predictive and management approaches for species occurring in a 
metapopulation structure require good understanding of interpopulation 
connectivity. In this study, we ask whether population genetic structure of 
marine species with fragmented distributions can be predicted by stepping-stone 
oceanographic transport and habitat continuity, using as model an 
ecosystem-structuring brown alga, Cystoseira amentacea var. stricta. To answer 
this question, we analysed the genetic structure and estimated the connectivity 
of populations along discontinuous rocky habitat patches in southern Italy, 
using microsatellite markers at multiple scales. In addition, we modelled the 
effect of rocky habitat continuity and ocean circulation on gene flow by 
simulating Lagrangian particle dispersal based on ocean surface currents 
allowing multigenerational stepping-stone dynamics. Populations were highly 
differentiated, at scales from few metres up to thousands of kilometres. The 
best possible model fit to explain the genetic results combined current 
direction, rocky habitat extension and distance along the coast among rocky 
sites. We conclude that a combination of variable suitable habitat and 
oceanographic transport is a useful predictor of genetic structure. This 
relationship provides insight into the mechanisms of dispersal and the role of 
life-history traits. Our results highlight the importance of spatially explicit 
modelling of stepping-stone dynamics and oceanographic directional transport 
coupled with habitat suitability, to better describe and predict marine 
population structure and differentiation. This study also suggests the 
appropriate spatial scales for the conservation, restoration and management of 
species that are increasingly affected by habitat modifications.

OBJECTIVES: To estimate the lifetime prevalence of official investigations for 
child maltreatment among children in the United States.
METHODS: We used the National Child Abuse and Neglect Data System Child Files 
(2003-2014) and Census data to develop synthetic cohort life tables to estimate 
the cumulative prevalence of reported childhood maltreatment. We extend previous 
work, which explored only confirmed rates of maltreatment, and we add new 
estimations of maltreatment by subtype, age, and ethnicity.
RESULTS: We estimate that 37.4% of all children experience a child protective 
services investigation by age 18 years. Consistent with previous literature, we 
found a higher rate for African American children (53.0%) and the lowest rate 
for Asians/Pacific Islanders (10.2%).
CONCLUSIONS: Child maltreatment investigations are more common than is generally 
recognized when viewed across the lifespan. Building on other recent work, our 
data suggest a critical need for increased preventative and treatment resources 
in the area of child maltreatment.

The Eatwell Guide: Modelling the Health Implications of Incorporating New Sugar 
and Fibre Guidelines.

Disease Prevention, Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of 
Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.

OBJECTIVE: To model population health impacts of dietary changes associated with 
the redevelopment of the UK food-based dietary guidelines (the 'Eatwell Guide').
METHOD: Using multi-state lifetable methods, we modelled the impact of dietary 
changes on cardiovascular disease, diabetes and cancers over the lifetime of the 
current UK population. From this model, we determined change in life expectancy 
and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) that could be averted.
RESULTS: Changing the average diet to that recommended in the new Eatwell Guide, 
without increasing total energy intake, could increase average life expectancy 
by 5.4 months (95% uncertainty interval: 4.7 to 6.2) for men and 4.0 months (3.4 
to 4.6) for women; and avert 17.9 million (17.6 to 18.2) DALYs over the lifetime 
of the current population. A large proportion of the health benefits are from 
prevention of type 2 diabetes, with 440,000 (400,000 to 480,000) new cases 
prevented in men and 340,000 (310,000 to 370,000) new cases prevented in women, 
over the next ten years. Prevention of cardiovascular diseases and colorectal 
cancer is also large. However, if the diet recommended in the new Eatwell Guide 
is achieved with an accompanying increase in energy intake (and thus an increase 
in body mass index), around half the potential improvements in population health 
will not be realised.
CONCLUSIONS: The dietary changes required to meet recommendations in the Eatwell 
Guide, which include eating more fruits and vegetables and less red and 
processed meats and dairy products, are large. However, the potential population 
health benefits are substantial.

Objective: To gather available evidence related to the economic evaluation on 
breast cancer screening in mainland China and to provide reference for further 
research. Methods: A systematic review was conducted to identify articles in 
PubMed and three Chinese databases (CNKI, Wanfang and VIP) during 1995-2015. 
Data related to descriptive characteristics, rates on participation and 
detection for population-based studies, methods for model-based studies, types 
of economic evaluation and results, were extracted. A Consolidated Health 
Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) was used to assess the 
reporting quality of included studies. Results: Of the 356 records searched in 
the databases, 13 studies (all published between 2012 and 2015) were included in 
the current paper involving 11 population-based studies and 3 model-based 
evaluations (1 study using both methods). Age of the participants who started to 
be engaged in the screening program ranged from 18 to 45 years old, but 
terminated at the age of 59 years or older. The screening modalities included 
single-used clinical breast examination, mammography and ultrasound or combined 
applications. Study persepectives were described in 7 studies, with 5 from the 
healthcare providers, and 2 from societal angles. Only 5 studies discounted cost 
or effectiveness. Out of 11 papers, 9 showed the results on cost-effectiveness 
analysis (CEA) that reporting the cost per breast cancer detection, with median 
as 145.0 thousand Chinese Yuan (CNY), ranging from 49.7 thousand to 2 293.0 
thousand CNY. From 4 papers with results of cost-utility analysis (CUA), the 
cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained or cost per disability 
adjusted life year (DALY) averted, were evaluated. The incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was from 2.9 thousand to 270.7 thousand CNY (GDP 
per capita of China was CNY 49.3 thousand in 2015). In 13 studies, the quality 
of reporting varied, with an average score of 14.5 (range: 9.5-21.0). In the 
domains of study perspective, discounting, ICER and uncertainty, all the scores 
of equalities were relatively levels. Conclusions: Currently, evidence on 
economic evaluation of breast cancer screening in mainland China remained 
limited and weakly comparable, particularly model-based studies. Comprehensive 
analysis from societal perspective and QALY or DALY related cost-utility 
analysis should be implemented.

OBJECTIVES: This study 1) investigated life expectancy and cause-specific 
mortality rates associated with type 2 diabetes and 2) quantified these 
relationships in ethnic subgroups.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a cohort study using Clinical Practice 
Research Datalink data from 383 general practices in England with linked 
hospitalization and mortality records. A total of 187,968 patients with incident 
type 2 diabetes from 1998 to 2015 were matched to 908,016 control subjects. 
Abridged life tables estimated years of life lost, and a competing risk survival 
model quantified cause-specific hazard ratios (HRs).
RESULTS: A total of 40,286 deaths occurred in patients with type 2 diabetes. At 
age 40, white men with diabetes lost 5 years of life and white women lost 6 
years compared with those without diabetes. A loss of between 1 and 2 years was 
observed for South Asians and blacks with diabetes. At age older than 65 years, 
South Asians with diabetes had up to 1.1 years' longer life expectancy than 
South Asians without diabetes. Compared with whites with diabetes, South Asians 
with diabetes had lower adjusted risks for mortality from cardiovascular (HR 
0.82; 95% CI 0.75, 0.89), cancer (HR 0.43; 95% CI 0.36, 0.51), and respiratory 
diseases (HR 0.60; 95% CI 0.48, 0.76). A similar pattern was observed in blacks 
with diabetes compared with whites with diabetes.
CONCLUSIONS: Type 2 diabetes was associated with more years of life lost among 
whites than among South Asians or blacks, with older South Asians experiencing 
longer life expectancy compared with South Asians without diabetes. The findings 
support optimized cardiovascular disease risk factor management, especially in 
whites with type 2 diabetes.

Owing to their great potentials in genetic code extension and the development of 
nucleic acid-based functional nanodevices, DNA duplexes containing HgII-mediated 
base pairs have been extensively studied during the past 60 years. However, 
structural basis underlying these base pairs remains poorly understood. Herein, 
we present five high-resolution crystal structures including one first-time 
reported C-HgII-T containing duplex, three T-HgII-T containing duplexes and one 
native duplex containing T-T pair without HgII. Our structures suggest that both 
C-T and T-T pairs are flexible in interacting with the HgII ion with various 
binding modes including N3-HgII-N3, N4-HgII-N3, O2-HgII-N3 and N3-HgII-O4. Our 
studies also reveal that the overall conformations of the C-HgII-T and T-HgII-T 
pairs are affected by their neighboring residues via the interactions with the 
solvent molecules or other metal ions, such as SrII. These results provide 
detailed insights into the interactions between HgII and nucleobases and the 
structural basis for the rational design of C-HgII-T or T-HgII-T containing DNA 
nanodevices in the future.

Crapemyrtle bark scale, Acanthococcus (=Eriococcus) lagerstroemiae (Kuwana) 
(Hemiptera: Eriococcidae), is a newly introduced insect pest on crapemyrtles, 
Lagerstroemia spp. (Myrtales: Lythraceae), one of the most popular flowering 
shrubs in the U.S. Since first detected in Texas in 2004, this pest has spread 
to twelve states causing losses to stakeholders. To develop a management plan, 
we reviewed current knowledge about the pest's biology and ecology, and 
suggested research approaches including studying its thermal tolerance, host 
range, plant resistance and biological control. Parasitoids and predators have 
been reared from A. lagerstroemiae in the U.S. and China. However, new surveys 
of natural enemies should be conducted in China, and studies on the host range 
and impacts of natural enemies on A. lagerstroemiae may help determine the 
potential for classical biological control. The life history, preying efficiency 
and rearing methods are important for coccinellid predators found in the U.S. 
including Chilocorus cacti L. and Hyperaspis spp. To enhance natural enemy 
performance, it is important to evaluate a sustainable insecticide program that 
considers efficacy, timing, rate and impact on pollinator health. Finally, an 
integrated management program of A. lagerstroemiae is discussed including 
planting resistant cultivars, using host specific natural enemies, and prudent 
use of insecticides.

Advances in the treatment and life expectancy of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients 
mean that motherhood is now a realistic option for many women with CF. This 
qualitative study explored the psychosocial impact and adjustments made when 
women with CF become mothers. Women with CF (n = 11) were recruited via an 
online forum and participated in semistructured telephone interviews about their 
experiences of becoming a mother. Transcriptions were analysed using Grounded 
Theory. Analysis revealed three core categories: (i) "Living with CF": how 
becoming a mother impacted on health and treatment adherence, requiring a change 
in support from the CF team, (ii) "Becoming a Mother": balancing issues common 
to new mothers with their CF, and (iii) "Pooling Personal Resources": coping 
strategies in managing the dual demands of child and CF care. Participants 
experienced a variety of complex psychosocial processes. Most participants 
acknowledged an initial negative impact on CF care; however over time they 
reported successful adaptation to managing dual commitments and that adherence 
and motivation to stay well had improved. This study highlights the need for 
preconceptual psychosocial counselling and postpartum adjustment to CF care.

INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of 
rivaroxaban and apixaban versus enoxaparin for the universal prophylaxis of 
venous thromboembolism (VTE) and associated long-term complications in Chinese 
patients after total hip replacement (THR).
METHODS: A decision model, which included both acute VTE (represented as a 
decision tree) and the long-term complications of VTE (represented as a Markov 
model), was developed to assess the economic outcomes of the three prophylactic 
strategies for Chinese patients after THR. Transition probabilities for acute 
VTE were derived from two randomized controlled studies, RECORD1 and ADVANCE3, 
of patients after THR. The transition probabilities of long-term complications 
after acute VTE, utilities, and costs were derived from the published literature 
and local healthcare settings. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses 
(PSA) were performed to test the uncertainty concerning the model parameters. 
The quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and direct medical costs were reported 
over a 5-year horizon, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were 
also calculated.
RESULTS: Thromboprophylaxis with apixaban was estimated to have a higher cost 
(US $178.70) and more health benefits (0.0025 QALY) than thromboprophylaxis with 
enoxaparin over a 5-year time horizon, which resulted in an ICER of US $71,244 
per QALY gained and was more than three times the GDP per capita of China in 
2014 (US $22,140). Owing to the higher cost and lower generated QALYs,
