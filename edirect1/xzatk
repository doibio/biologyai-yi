METHODS AND RESULTS: We used a Markov model to assess the cost-effectiveness of 
3 strategies for treating an asymptomatic 10-year-old, first-degree relative of 
a patient with clinically evident LQTS. In the genetic testing strategy, 
relatives undergo genetic testing only for the mutation identified in the index 
patient, and relatives who test positive for the mutation are treated with 
β-blockers. This strategy was compared with (1) empirical treatment of relatives 
with β-blockers and (2) watchful waiting, with treatment only after development 
of symptoms. The genetic testing strategy resulted in better survival and 
quality-adjusted life years at higher cost, with a cost-effectiveness ratio of 
$67 400 per quality-adjusted life year gained compared with watchful waiting. 
The cost-effectiveness of the genetic testing strategy improved to less than $50 
000 per quality-adjusted life year gained when applied selectively either to (1) 
relatives with higher clinical suspicion of LQTS (pretest probability 65% to 
81%), or to (2) families with a higher than average risk of sudden death, or to 
(3) larger families (2 or more first-degree relatives tested).
CONCLUSIONS: Genetic testing of young first-degree relatives of patients with 
definite LQTS is moderately expensive, but can reach acceptable thresholds of 
cost-effectiveness when applied to selected patients.

CNS-targeted viral delivery of G-CSF in an animal model for ALS: improved 
efficacy and preservation of the neuromuscular unit.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease 
characterized by progressive loss of motoneurons. We have recently uncovered a 
new neurotrophic growth factor, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), 
which protects α-motoneurons, improves functional outcome, and increases life 
expectancy of SOD-1 (G93A) mice when delivered subcutaneously. However, chronic 
systemic delivery of G-CSF is complicated by elevation of neutrophilic 
granulocytes. Here, we used adeno-associated virus (AAV) to directly target and 
confine G-CSF expression to the spinal cord. Whereas intramuscular injection of 
AAV failed to transduce motoneurons retrogradely, and caused a high systemic 
load of G-CSF, intraspinal delivery led to a highly specific enrichment of G-CSF 
in the spinal cord with moderate peripheral effects. Intraspinal delivery 
improved motor functions, delayed disease progression, and increased survival by 
10%, longer than after systemic delivery. Mechanistically, we could show that 
G-CSF in addition to rescuing motoneurons improved neuromuscular junction (NMJ) 
integrity and enhanced motor axon regeneration after nerve crush injury. 
Collectively, our results show that intraspinal delivery improves efficacy of 
G-CSF treatment in an ALS mouse model while minimizing the systemic load of 
G-CSF, suggesting a new therapeutic option for ALS treatment.

Resection arthrodesis for giant cell tumors around the knee.

Kapoor SK(1), Tiwari A.

Author information:
(1)Department of Orthopaedics, Lady Hardinge Medical College and Associated 
Hospitals, New Delhi - 110 001, India.

BACKGROUND: Giant cell tumors (GCTs) of bone are aggressive benign tumors. Wide 
resection is reserved for a small subset of patients with biologically more 
aggressive, recurrent and extensive tumors. As the patients affected with GCT 
are young or middle-aged adults with a normal life expectancy, arthrodesis is an 
attractive option for reconstruction in these patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-six patients of mean age 33.1 years with 
Campanacci Grade III giant cell tumors around the knee (20 distal femoral and 16 
proximal tibial) were treated with wide resection and arthrodesis from January 
1996 through January 2006. Arthrodesis was performed using plating with free 
fibular graft (n = 18), IM nail with free fibular graft (n = 8) and IM nail 
combined with ring fixator using bone transport (n = 10).
RESULTS: Fusion after the first surgery was achieved in 77.7%, 75% and 90% of 
the patients in the three groups respectively. Local recurrence was seen in two 
patients and repeat surgery for nonunion/ graft fracture had to be done in four 
patients and two patients in the plating and nailing groups respectively.
CONCLUSION: Wide resection and arthrodesis in aggressive GCTs around the knee is 
a good treatment option. IM nail combined with a ring fixator seems to be a good 
method of arthrodesis with high fusion rates, least shortening and early 
rehabilitation.

[The truth is in the eye of the beholder? Quality in rehabilitation from the

The definition of "good" quality in health research and quality management in 
health care and rehabilitation are primarily based on health professionals and 
their associations. But laypersons, patients, and participants in rehabilitation 
programmes, too, develop cognitive concepts about what defines good quality in 
health care. Until now systematic knowledge about the role of the patients' 
views on quality in rehabilitation is rare. Existing data demonstrate that 
patients report detailed ideas about indicators and preconditions of good 
quality of rehabilitative care. Patients' quality concepts differ in some aspect 
from the quality definitions of health care professionals. There is some 
evidence that patients' views on quality are a necessary extension and 
completion of programme evaluation and of quality management. They influence 
usage and selection of rehabilitation facilities and programme elements and 
probably patient satisfaction and long-term outcomes as well. Patients' ideas 
could contribute to gaining a deeper understanding of patients' needs. Here, 
patients are experts to define challenges for long-term improvements in health 
and health-related behavior with regard to everyday life and related resources 
and barriers. Taking patients' views on the quality of rehabilitation into 
account could help to adapt rehabilitation features, programmes and long-term 
offers more adequately to patients' needs. More systematic evidence is however 
needed as a basis for further developments in rehabilitation programmes.

The Poor Law of old England: institutional innovation and demographic regimes.

Kelly M, Gráda CÓ.

The striking improvement in life expectancy that took place in England between 
the Middle Ages and the seventeenth century cannot be explained either by an 
increase in real wages or by better climatic conditions. The decrease in the 
risk of utter destitution or of death from famine that was evident on the eve of 
the Industrial Revolution stemmed, in part, from institutional changes in the 
old poor law, which began to take shape and become effective early in the 
seventeenth century.

Loss of membrane targeting of Vangl proteins causes neural tube defects.

Iliescu A(1), Gravel M, Horth C, Kibar Z, Gros P.

(1)Department of Biochemistry and Complex Traits Program, McGill University, 
Montreal, Canada H3G 0B1.

In the mouse, the loop-tail mutation (Lp) causes a very severe neural tube 
defect, which is caused by mutations in the Vangl2 gene. In mammals, Vangl1 and 
Vangl2 code for integral membrane proteins that assemble into asymmetrically 
distributed membrane complexes that establish planar cell polarity in epithelial 
cells and that regulate convergent extension movements during embryogenesis. To 
date, VANGL are the only genes in which mutations cause neural tube defects in 
humans. Three independently arising Lp alleles have been described for Vangl2: 
D255E, S464N, and R259L. Here we report a common mechanism for both the 
naturally occurring Lp (S464N) and a novel ENU-induced mutation 
Lp(m2Jus)(R259L). We show that the S464N and R259L variants stably expressed in 
polarized MDCK kidney cells fail to reach the plasma membrane, their site for 
biological function. The mutant variants are retained intracellularly in the 
endoplasmic reticulum, colocalizing with ER chaperone calreticulin. Furthermore, 
the mutants also show a dramatically reduced half-life of ∼3 h, compared to ∼22 
h for the wild-type protein, and are rapidly degraded in a proteasome-dependent 
and MG132-sensitive fashion. Coexpressing individually the three known allelic 
Lp variants with the wild-type protein does not influence the localization of 
the WT at the plasma membrane, suggesting that the codominant nature of the Lp 
trait in vivo is due to haploid insufficiency caused by a partial loss of 
function in a gene dosage-dependent pathway, as opposed to a dominant negative 
phenotype. Our study provides a biochemical framework for the study of recently 
identified mutations in hVANGL1 and hVANGL2 in sporadic or familial cases of 
neural tube defects.

Global aging, well-ordered science, and prospection.

Farrelly C(1).

Aristotle described the study of politics as an "architectonic" science that 
aspires to bring together insights from different fields of scientific inquiry 
to ensure that citizens have the opportunities to flourish. To meet the health 
and economic challenges of aging populations, we must revive this Aristotelian 
vision of politics. Prioritizing biogerontology is a requirement of well-ordered 
science. But a number of cognitive limitations and biases impair our ability to 
perceive both the harms of the inborn aging process and the magnitude of the 
likely benefits of age retardation. Thus, well-ordered science also requires us 
to address the social and cultural, and not merely scientific, obstacles that 
impede the aspiration to retard human aging.

BACKGROUND: Overweight and obesity are highly prevalent among persons with 
serious mental illness. These conditions likely contribute to premature 
cardiovascular disease and a 20 to 30 percent shortened life expectancy in this 
vulnerable population. Persons with serious mental illness need effective, 
appropriately tailored behavioral interventions to achieve and maintain weight 
loss. Psychiatric rehabilitation day programs provide logical intervention 
settings because mental health consumers often attend regularly and exercise can 
take place on-site. This paper describes the Randomized Trial of Achieving 
Healthy Lifestyles in Psychiatric Rehabilitation (ACHIEVE). The goal of the 
study is to determine the effectiveness of a behavioral weight loss intervention 
among persons with serious mental illness that attend psychiatric rehabilitation 
programs. Participants randomized to the intervention arm of the study are 
hypothesized to have greater weight loss than the control group.
METHODS/DESIGN: A targeted 320 men and women with serious mental illness and 
overweight or obesity (body mass index ≥ 25.0 kg/m2) will be recruited from 10 
psychiatric rehabilitation programs across Maryland. The core design is a 
randomized, two-arm, parallel, multi-site clinical trial to compare the 
effectiveness of an 18-month behavioral weight loss intervention to usual care. 
Active intervention participants receive weight management sessions and physical 
activity classes on-site led by study interventionists. The intervention 
incorporates cognitive adaptations for persons with serious mental illness 
attending psychiatric rehabilitation programs. The initial intensive 
intervention period is six months, followed by a twelve-month maintenance period 
in which trained rehabilitation program staff assume responsibility for 
delivering parts of the intervention. Primary outcomes are weight loss at six 
and 18 months.
DISCUSSION: Evidence-based approaches to the high burden of obesity and 
cardiovascular disease risk in person with serious mental illness are urgently 
needed. The ACHIEVE Trial is tailored to persons with serious mental illness in 
community settings. This multi-site randomized clinical trial will provide a 
rigorous evaluation of a practical behavioral intervention designed to 
accomplish and sustain weight loss in persons with serious mental illness.

Although urban agriculture (UA) in the developing world may enhance nutrition 
and local economies, it may also lead to higher densities of mosquito breeding 
sites and, consequently, to increased transmission of malarial parasites. If 
targeted interventions against malaria vectors are to be successful in urban 
areas, the habitats that support Anopheles breeding need to be identified and 
detected. Mosquito breeding sites have recently been characterised, and the 
factors associated with productive Anopheles habitats identified, in market 
gardens of Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire. Two surveys were conducted in seven 
vegetable-production areas, one towards the end of the rainy season and one 
during the dry season. A standardized methodology was used for habitat 
characterisation and the detection of Anopheles larvae and mosquito pupae. 
Overall, 454 and 559 potential mosquito-breeding sites were recorded in the 
rainy-season and dry-season surveys, respectively. In the rainy season, 
Anopheles larvae and mosquito pupae were found in 29.7% and 5.5% of the 
potential breeding sites, respectively, whereas the corresponding percentages in 
the dry season were 24.3% and 8.6%. The potential breeding sites in an 
agricultural zone on the periphery of Abidjan were those least likely to be 
positive for Anopheles larvae and mosquito pupae whereas 'agricultural trenches' 
between seedbeds were the sites most likely to be positive. In a 
spatially-explicit Bayesian multivariate logistic-regression model, although one 
out of every five such wells was also found to harbour Anopheles larvae, 
irrigation wells were found to be the least productive habitats, of those 
sampled, for pupae. In the study area, simple and cost-effective strategies of 
larval control should be targeted at agricultural trenches, ideally with the 
active involvement of local stakeholders (i.e. urban farmers and urban 
agricultural extension services).

Medicine and Primary Care Research Center, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, 
Beer-Sheva, Israel.

CONTEXT: Cancer patients have impaired humoral and cellular immunity, and are 
more susceptible to infections; their immunological response is expected to be 
less effective than that of healthy people.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the immune response to influenza vaccine in terminally ill 
cancer patients in a home palliative care unit.
METHODS: During the fall of 2000-2001, 2005-2006, and 2006-2007, terminally ill 
cancer patients treated by our home palliative care unit were vaccinated against 
influenza with Vaxigrip(®). Blood samples were taken before and four weeks after 
vaccination. Influenza immunological response parameters accepted in the 
literature were calculated.
RESULTS: Eighteen terminal cancer patients were vaccinated against influenza 
strains predicted for that year; 13 completed the study. The other five patients 
died within less than a month from the time of vaccination. The serum protection 
rate increased from 15.4% before to 61.5% after vaccination, and the serum 
response rate was 53.8% for all the three strains of vaccination. Mean-fold 
increase was 24.9 for influenza A-H1N1, 15.4 for influenza A-H3N2, and 2.8 for 
influenza B. Geometric mean titer was increased for influenza A-H3N2 from 8.3 
before vaccination to 159.4 after vaccination; for influenza A-H1N1 from 5.2 to 
124.3, and for influenza B from 5.7 to 44.6.
CONCLUSION: The results indicate that influenza vaccination is probably 
effective and can be offered to terminally ill cancer patients with a life 
expectancy of about three months in a home care palliative care unit.

Central versus lower body obesity distribution and the association with lower 
limb physical function and disability.

City, IA, USA.

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether fat distribution in obese adults is 
significantly associated with decreased function and increased disability.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional epidemiologic analysis.
SETTING: Multicenter, community-based study.
PARTICIPANTS: Multicenter Osteoarthritis Study participants included adults ages 
50-79 years at high risk of developing or already possessing knee 
osteoarthritis. A total of 549 men and 892 women from the Multicenter 
Osteoarthritis Study who had a body mass index ≥ 30 kg/m² and who underwent dual 
energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scans were included in these analyses. 
Exclusion criteria included bilateral knee replacements, cancer, or other 
rheumatologic disease.
METHODS: Body fat distribution was determined using baseline DEXA scan data. A 
ratio of abdominal fat in grams compared with lower limb fat in grams 
(trunk:lower limb fat ratio) was calculated. Participants were divided into 
quartiles of trunk:lower limb fat ratio, with highest and lowest quartiles 
representing central and lower body obesity, respectively. Backward elimination 
linear regression models stratified by gender were used to analyze statistical 
differences in function and disability between central and lower body obesity 
groups.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Lower limb physical function measures included 20-meter 
walk time, chair stand time, and peak knee flexion and extension strength. 
Disability was assessed using the Late Life Function and Disability Index.
RESULTS: Trunk:lower limb fat ratio was not significantly associated with 
physical function or disability in women or men (P value .167-.972). Total 
percent body fat (standardized β = -0.1533 and -0.1970 in men and women, 
respectively) was a better predictor of disability when compared with 
trunk:lower limb fat ratio (standardized β = 0.0309 and 0.0072).
CONCLUSIONS: Although fat distribution patterns may affect clinical outcomes in 
other areas, lower limb physical function and disability do not appear to be 
significantly influenced by the distribution of fat in obese older adults with, 
or at risk for, knee osteoarthritis. These data do not support differential 
treatment of functional limitations based on fat distribution.

    J Pain Symptom Manage. 2011 Dec;42(6):e3-4.

CONTEXT: The benefits of anticoagulation treatment for primary prophylaxis in 
patients with advanced progressive diseases are unclear. Moreover, there are no 
empirically based guidelines on thromboprophylaxis for palliative care patients.
OBJECTIVES: To prospectively evaluate a quality improvement protocol on the use 
of thromboprophylaxis on a 36-bed palliative care unit (PCU).
METHODS: A protocol was developed to guide and standardize practice related to 
venous thromboembolic events (VTE) and anticoagulation medication use on the PCU 
in patients with a life expectancy of less than six months. Through a 
prospective audit, data were collected for consecutively admitted patients over 
a period of four months.
RESULTS: Of the 127 patients admitted to the PCU, 41 (32.3%) were on 
thromboprophylaxis on admission. All but one of these patients had come from an 
acute care hospital. Thromboprophylaxis was discontinued in 36 (87.8%) of these 
patients; one patient went on to develop a VTE. Of the 71 patients admitted 
without thromboprophylaxis, none of the patients were started on 
thromboprophylaxis and six went on to develop a VTE.
CONCLUSION: In this quality improvement study of patients admitted to a PCU 
largely for end-of-life care, thromboprophylaxis was discontinued in most 
patients without a significant increase in the incidence of symptomatic VTE. The 
validity of recommendations extrapolated from the general hospitalized cancer 
population supporting routine thromboprophylaxis and applied to these patients 
can be challenged. A policy that requires thromboprophylaxis in all hospitalized 
cancer patients may run the risk of indiscriminately including patients who are 
in the terminal phase of their lives.

Electrolyte disturbances and acute kidney injury in patients with cancer.

Lameire N(1), Van Biesen W, Vanholder R.

Author information:
(1)Renal Division, University Hospital, Gent, Belgium. norbert.lameire@ugent.be

The interrelation between kidney disease and cancer is complex and reciprocal. 
Among the most frequent cancer-associated kidney diseases are the electrolyte 
and acid-base disturbances, which occur frequently and often are associated with 
an ominous prognosis, and acute kidney injury. Tumor lysis syndrome is a 
potentially life-threatening condition that frequently occurs in patients with a 
high tumor burden and high cellular turnover after cytotoxic therapy (including 
steroids in steroid-sensitive hematologic malignancies). Electrolyte and 
acid-base disturbances are the consequence of neoplastic spread, anticancer 
treatment, or, more rarely, paraneoplastic phenomena of all types of tumors. 
This article reviews hyponatremia and hypernatremia, hypokalemia and 
hyperkalemia, hypomagnesemia, hypercalcemia and hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia, 
and the most important disturbances in acid-base balance in cancer patients. 
Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a frequent occurrence in cancer patients and has 
the potential to substantially alter the outcome of patients with cancer and 
jeopardize their chances of receiving optimal cancer treatment and a potential 
cure. As in many other circumstances, the etiology of AKI in cancer patients is 
multifactorial. Initiation and/or continuation of dialysis in the AKI cancer 
patient should be based on the general clinical condition and overall life 
expectancy and the personal patient expectations on quality of life after 
eventual recovery.

48109, USA. bschoeni@umich.edu.

BACKGROUND: Higher educational attainment is associated with better health 
status and longer life.
PURPOSE: This analysis estimates the annual dollar value of the benefits that 
would accrue to less-educated American adults if they experienced the lower 
mortality rates and better health of those with a college education.
METHODS: Using estimates of differences in mortality among adults aged ≥ 25 
years by educational attainment from the National Longitudinal Mortality Survey 
and of education-based differentials in health status from published studies 
based on the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, combined with existing estimates 
of the economic value of a healthy life year, the economic value of raising the 
health of individuals with less than a college education to the health of the 
college educated is estimated.
RESULTS: The annual economic value that would accrue to disadvantaged 
(less-educated) Americans if their health and longevity improved to that of 
college-educated Americans is $1.02 trillion.
CONCLUSIONS: This modeling exercise does not fully account for the social costs 
and benefits of particular policies and programs to reduce health disparities; 
rather, it provides a sense of the magnitude of the economic value lost in 
health disparities to compare with other social issues vying for attention. The 
aggregate economic gains from interventions that improve the health of 
disadvantaged Americans are potentially large.

Low cardiorespiratory fitness and physical functional capacity in obese patients 
with schizophrenia.

Ontario, Canada.

BACKGROUND: Low cardiorespiratory fitness is a prominent behavioral risk factor 
for cardiovascular disease (CVD) morbidity and mortality, as cardiorespiratory 
fitness is strongly associated with CVD outcomes. High rates of CVD have been 
observed in the schizophrenia population, translating into a markedly reduced 
life expectancy as compared to healthy controls. Surprisingly however, while 
cardiorespiratory fitness is an eminent indicator for overall cardiovascular 
health as well as eminently modifiable risk factor for CVD, no studies have 
systematically assessed cardiorespiratory fitness in schizophrenia.
METHODS: Community-dwelling schizophrenia patients underwent graded-exercise 
tests, to ascertain maximal oxygen uptake (Max Vo2), considered to be the gold 
standard for the evaluation of cardiorespiratory fitness and physical functional 
capacity. The modified Bruce protocol was used to ascertain cardiorespiratory 
fitness and physical functional capacity; data was normalized and compared to 
population standards derived from the ACLS (Aerobics Center Longitudinal Study) 
and the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES), Cycles III 
and IV.
RESULTS: Data for n=117 participants (41% male, 46% white) was analyzed. Mean 
age (y) was 43.2±9.9, and mean BMI was 37.2±7.3. Peak HR attained during 
exercise was 145.6±19.6, after 8.05±3.6 min, achieving 111.2±44.2W. Max Vo2 was 
1.72±6.6l/min, MaxVCo2 1.85±7.2l/min, and minute ventilation (VE) was 55.6±21.9 
ml/s. PANSS Positive subscores (13.3±4.4; r=-0.21, p=0.024) were inversely 
correlated with Max Vo2 ml(-1)min(-1) kg(-1). Neither PANSS Total (56.3±12.3; 
r=-0.105, p=0.72), PANSS Negative (14±5.1; r=-0.52, p=0.57) nor PANSS General 
Psychopathology (28.4±7.4; r=-0.28, p=0.76) scores were correlated with Max Vo2 
ml(-1) min(-1) kg(-1). Peak heart rate and duration of exercise were not 
correlated with PANSS scores. Compared to healthy controls derived from the ACLS 
and NHANES, respectively, 115 participants achieved 'low levels' of fitness 
only, as well as highly significantly reduced Max Vo2, across all age groups.
CONCLUSION: The test was generally well received and tolerated by those who 
elected to participate; and adherence to the protocol was good. Among 
participants with schizophrenia, most of whom were obese, and across all age 
groups, cardiorespiratory fitness was exceedingly poor. Only two participants in 
our entire sample fit the categorization of 'moderate fitness level'; that is, a 
fitness level at or above the 20th percentile of ACLS-derived population 
comparisons. Conversely, this left 98.3% of participants with schizophrenia 
below population standards. Low cardiorespiratory fitness emerges as an eminent 
modifiable risk factor for CVD mortality and morbidity in schizophrenia 
complicated by obesity.

BACKGROUND: Haptoglobin (HP), which scavenges free, cell-toxic hemoglobin and 
has anti-inflammatory and immune-modulatory function in extravascular tissues, 
may represent an excellent candidate gene to investigate the life-span 
expectancy.
METHODS: HP 1/2 polymorphism has been determined for 1072 (569 females, 503 
males) unrelated healthy individuals from Central Italy, 18-106 years old, 
divided into three gender-specific age classes defined according to demographic 
information and accounting for the different survivals between sexes. HP*1F/S 
subtyping was also performed to check the possible existence for a preferential 
advantage of HP*1F or HP*1S allele.
RESULTS: HP*1/*1 genotype results associated to increased probability of young 
subjects of attaining longevity (Comparison 1: O.R. 1.709, p=0.0114) with a 
concomitant advantage of HP*1 allele (Comparison 1: O.R. 1.273, p=0.0194). On 
the other side, carriers of HP*2 allele displayed an overall significant 
disadvantage in reaching Age Class 2 (O.R. 0.585, p=0.0092). No significant 
differences were noticed between age groups either considering total HP*1F and 
HP*1S allele frequencies or according to HP 1/2 genotypes.
CONCLUSION: The crucial role played by HP in aging process is warranted by its 
many established functions and its related phenotypes so that it may be 
considered an important gene involved in the determination of human survival.

The involvement of Eph-Ephrin signaling in tissue separation and convergence 
during Xenopus gastrulation movements.

Technology, Nam-gu, Pohang, Kyungbuk, Republic of Korea.

In Xenopus gastrulation, the involuting mesodermal and non-involuting ectodermal 
cells remain separated from each other, undergoing convergent extension. Here, 
we show that Eph-ephrin signaling is crucial for the tissue separation and 
convergence during gastrulation. The loss of EphA4 function results in aberrant 
gastrulation movements, which are due to selective inhibition of tissue 
constriction and separation. At the cellular levels, knockdown of EphA4 impairs 
polarization and migratory activity of gastrulating cells but not specification 
of their fates. Importantly, rescue experiments demonstrate that EphA4 controls 
tissue separation via RhoA GTPase in parallel to Fz7 and PAPC signaling. In 
addition, we show that EphA4 and its putative ligand, ephrin-A1 are expressed in 
a complementary manner in the involuting mesodermal and non-involuting 
ectodermal layers of early gastrulae, respectively. Depletion of ephrin-A1 also 
abrogates tissue separation behaviors. Therefore, these results suggest that Eph 
receptor and its ephrin ligand might mediate repulsive interaction for tissue 
separation and convergence during early Xenopus gastrulation movements.

Zoo animal husbandry aims at constantly improving husbandry, reproductive 
success and ultimately animal welfare. Nevertheless, analyses to determine 
factors influencing husbandry of different species are rare. The relative life 
expectancy (rLE; life expectancy (LE) as proportion of longevity) describes 
husbandry success of captive populations. Correlating rLE with biological 
characteristics of different species, reasons for variation in rLE can be 
detected. We analysed data of 166 901 animals representing 78 ruminant species 
kept in 850 facilities. The rLE of females correlated with the percentage of 
grass in a species' natural diet, suggesting that needs of species adapted to 
grass can be more easily accommodated than the needs of those adapted to browse. 
Males of monogamous species demonstrate higher rLE than polygamous males, which 
matches observed differences of sexual bias in LE in free-living populations and 
thus supports the ecological theory that the mating system influences LE. The 
third interesting finding was that rLE was higher in species managed by 
international studbooks when compared with species not managed in this way. Our 
method facilitates the identification of biological characteristics of species 
that are relevant for their husbandry success, and they also support ecological 
theory. Translating these findings into feeding recommendations, our approach 
can help to improve animal husbandry.

Médicale Unité 895/C3M, 06202 Nice, France.

CONTEXT: Recombinant human GH treatment and oocyte donation (OD) have improved 
the quality of life in women with Turner syndrome (TS). However, life expectancy 
is reduced, mainly due to cardiovascular complications. Pregnancy may itself 
increase that risk and be associated with hazardous materno-fetal outcome.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the materno-fetal outcome 
of ongoing pregnancies beyond 20 wk of gestation obtained by OD in TS.
DESIGN: This was a multicenter retrospective study including all assisted 
reproductive technology centers affiliated with the French Study Group for 
Oocyte Donation.
RESULTS: Among 93 patients, only 37.6% were prescreened with echocardiography or 
thoracic magnetic resonance imaging. Maternal outcome was dominated by 37.8% of 
pregnancy-associated hypertensive disorders including preeclampsia in 54.8% and 
severe eclampsia in four patients. Prematurity occurred in 38.3% and was 
correlated with pregnancy-associated hypertensive disorder (P = 0.01). The 
frequency of in utero growth retardation was 27.5%. One fetal demise was linked 
to eclampsia. Two patients died from aortic rupture after cesarean section in a 
context of aortic root dilatation. Only 40% of pregnancies were associated with 
an absolutely normal materno-fetal outcome.
CONCLUSIONS: OD pregnancies in TS who have not been managed following recent 
specific recommendations were at high risk for maternal death by aortic 
dissection and for preeclampsia and its complications (fetal distress and in 
utero growth retardation). These recommendations include previous 
echocardiography, thoracic magnetic resonance imaging, and overnight blood 
pressure monitoring associated with a tight follow-up during pregnancy. Until 
future assessment of these recent recommendations, pregnancies obtained in TS 
after OD must be still considered as very high-risk pregnancies.

and Medicaid Services, Baltimore,Maryland, USA.

This paper examines differences in national health care spending by gender and 
age. Our research found significant variations in per person spending by gender 
across age groups, health services, and types of payers. For example, in 2004 
per capita health care spending for females was 32 percent more than for males. 
Per capita differences were most pronounced among the working-age population, 
largely because of spending for maternity care. Except for children, total 
spending for and by females was greater than that for and by males, for most 
services and payers. The gender difference in total spending was most pronounced 
in the elderly, as a result of the longer life expectancy of women.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a fairly common rheumatic disease in Hong 
Kong, China. The prevalence and annual incidence of SLE are estimated to be 0.1% 
and 6.7/100,000 population, respectively. The 10-year cumulative survival of SLE 
patients in Hong Kong is 83% and the age and gender-adjusted standardized 
mortality ratio was 5.25 (1.64-10.4) from 1999 to 2008. The commonest cause of 
death is infections (60%), followed by cardiovascular complications (16%). Life 
expectancy analysis reveals a loss of 20 years in women and 27 years in men when 
SLE develops at birth. The loss in life years is greatest in the younger age 
groups. Renal damage is the most frequent disease-related damage, whereas 
musculoskeletal damage is the commonest treatment-related complication. The 
quality of life of our SLE patients is impaired and declines over time, which is 
contributed by new organ damage. One-third of our patients lose their ability to 
work within 5 years of disease onset, which is mainly attributed to 
musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, anxiety and depression symptoms, and memory 
deterioration. With the availability of novel therapeutics and an increased 
awareness of complication prevention in SLE, it is expected that our patients 
will live longer with a better quality of life in the next decade.

    Interact Cardiovasc Thorac Surg. 2011 Mar;12(3):398-9.

This study was performed to assess the cost-effectiveness of concomitant 
ablation surgery (AS) compared to regular cardiac surgery in atrial fibrillation 
(AF) patients over a one-year follow-up. Cost analysis was performed from a 
societal perspective alongside a prospective, randomised, double-blinded, 
multicentre trial. One hundred and fifty patients with documented AF were 
randomly assigned to undergo cardiac surgery with or without AS. One hundred and 
thirty-two patients were included in the cost-effectiveness study. All costs 
(medical and non-medical) were measured during follow-up. Costs data were 
combined with quality adjusted life years (QALYs) to obtain the incremental 
costs per QALY. Total costs of the AS group were significantly higher compared 
to the regular cardiac surgery group [cost difference bootstrap: €4,724; 95% 
uncertainty interval (UI), €2,770-€6,678]. The bootstrapped difference in QALYs 
was not statistically significant (0.06; 95% UI: -0.024 to 0.14). The 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio is €73,359 per QALY. The acceptability 
curve showed that, even in the case of a maximum threshold value of €80,000 per 
QALY gained, the probability of AS being more cost-effective than regular 
cardiac surgery did not reach beyond 50%. Concluding that concomitant AS in AF 
is not cost-effective after a one-year follow-up compared to regular cardiac 
surgery.

Mitral valve repair is the operation of choice for mitral valve regurgitation, 
with appropriate selection. Studies have shown that mitral repair is associated 
with a decrease in both long-term thromboembolic complications and mortality. 
Since its initial description, various selection criteria and techniques of 
mitral valve repair have been discussed in the literature. This review serves as 
a synopsis of the previous achievements, present status, and possible future 
directions of mitral valve repair, specifically from an Asian perspective. Vast 
experience has been amassed in understanding mitral valve pathophysiology, and 
excellent surgical treatments for mitral regurgitation have been developed. With 
the efforts of pioneers in the field of mitral valve repair, standard surgical 
treatment strategies have been proven to restore the life-expectancy of patients 
with degenerative mitral regurgitation to that of the age-adjusted population. 
Minimally invasive techniques of mitral valve repair further reduce access 
trauma, and could potentially benefit patients previously excluded from 
conventional surgery.

The prevalence, correlates, and impact of logically inconsistent preferences in 
utility assessments for joint health states in prostate cancer.

IL 60637, USA. wdale@medicine.bsd.uchicago.edu

BACKGROUND: Variations in health state utilities can impact cost-effectiveness 
analyses. One potential source of error is when joint health state (JS) 
utilities are rated higher than the embedded single state (SS) utilities. 
Knowing when and in whom this occurs can improve cost-effectiveness analyses.
METHODS: Men (n = 323) were surveyed at the time of prostate biopsy. Time 
tradeoff SS and JS utilities for prevalent prostate cancer (PCa) health states 
were collected. JS utilities assessed included those most prevalent for PCa. 
"Inconsistency" was defined in the following 3 ways: (1) any size rank order 
violation; (2) total number of violations; and (3) differences greater than 1 
standard deviation (SD). Regression analysis assessed independent patient 
characteristics associated with inconsistent responses.
RESULTS: Aggregate JS utilities were consistent. At the individual level, 36% to 
41% of responses violated rank order and 12% to 14% were larger than 1 SD. In 
all, 69% of respondents had at least 1 JS inconsistency, and 24% had >1 SD 
inconsistencies. Being married and feeling anxious were independently correlated 
with giving all types of inconsistent ratings, and lower education correlated 
with making >SD errors. SS utilities, and not JS utilities, were significantly 
lower for the inconsistent group. "Correcting" JS inconsistencies decreased 
aggregate utilities 1 to 9 units.
CONCLUSIONS: Inconsistent JS utilities for PCa are prevalent in men at biopsy. 
Being married, more anxious, and having less education are correlated with 
inconsistencies. It is the SS utilities, rather than the JS utilities, that 
differ between consistent and inconsistent raters. Better understanding of the 
source of these inconsistencies is needed.
