Campinas, Campinas, Sao Paulo, Brazil.

BACKGROUND: Feeding intolerance (FI) is a common clinical problem in preterm 
infants often caused by some neonatal disorders and drugs, including antenatal 
exposure to magnesium sulfate (MgSO4 ).
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between hypermagnesemia at birth and FI 
in preterm infants during the first 72 h of life.
METHOD: This was a cohort study conducted with preterm infants aged <34 weeks' 
gestation. Infants presenting at least two of the following signs were 
considered as having FI: vomiting, abdominal distension, the need for continuous 
intermittent feeding, and delayed meconium passage. Hypermagnesemia was 
characterized by umbilical serum Mg levels > 2.5 mEq/L.
RESULTS: A total 251 infants were evaluated. The median birth weight and 
gestational age were 1390 g (IQR, 1020-1070) and 31 weeks (IQR, 28-32). The FI 
rate was 17.5%. The exposure rate to MgSO4 was similar in the tolerant and 
intolerant groups (53.1% × 63.6%; P = 0.204), but hypermagnesemia was more 
frequent in the FI group (40.9% × 24.2%; P = 0.024). The univariate analysis 
showed that infants with hypermagnesemia were twofold more likely to present FI 
(odds ratio [OR], 2.16; 95% CI, 1.09-4.26). In the multiple logistic regression 
analysis, we found that hypermagnesemia was independently associated with FI 
(OR, 2.51; 95% CI, 1.06-5.91), as well as maternal diabetes mellitus (OR, 2.56; 
95% CI, 1.07-6.14), Score for Neonatal Acute Physiology-Perinatal Extension II 
(OR, 1.051; 95% CI, 1.025-1.078), and brain hemorrhage (OR, 3.61; 95% CI, 
1.31-9.91).
CONCLUSION: In addition to other factors, hypermagnesemia at birth was 
independently associated with early FI in preterm infants.

Life expectancy in humans is increasing, resulting in a growing aging 
population, that is accompanied by an increased disposition to develop cognitive 
deterioration. Hypometabolism is one of the multiple factors related to 
inefficient brain function during aging. This review emphasizes the metabolic 
interactions between glial cells (astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and microglia) 
and neurons, particularly, during aging. Glial cells provide support and 
protection to neurons allowing adequate synaptic activity. We address metabolic 
coupling from the expression of transporters, availability of substrates, 
metabolic pathways, and mitochondrial activity. In aging, the main metabolic 
exchange machinery is altered with inefficient levels of nutrients and 
detrimental mitochondrial activity that results in high reactive oxygen species 
levels and reduced ATP production, generating a highly inflammatory environment 
that favors deregulated cell death. Here, we provide an overview of the 
glial-to-neuron mechanisms, from the molecular components to the cell types, 
emphasizing aging as the crucial risk factor for developing 
neurodegenerative/neuroinflammatory diseases.

The availability of antiretroviral therapy (ART) has increased the life 
expectancy of people with HIV (PWH) and reduced the incidence of AIDS-associated 
malignancies, yet PWH have a significantly increased incidence of malignancy and 
less favorable outcomes of cancer treatment compared with the general 
population.Immunotherapy has revolutionized cancer therapy, becoming the 
standard of care for various malignancy treatments. However, PWH are an 
underserved population with limited access to clinical trials and cancer 
treatment.This review of the available evidence on different classes of cancer 
immunotherapy in PWH is mostly based on case reports, case series, but few 
prospective studies and clinical trials due to the exclusion of PWH from most 
oncologic clinical trials. The results of the available evidence support the 
safety of immunotherapy in PWH. Immunotherapy has similar effectiveness in PWH, 
an acceptable toxicity profile, and has no clinically significant impact on HIV 
viral load and CD4-T cell count. In addition, there is no reported change in the 
incidence of opportunistic infections and other complications for PWH with 
well-controlled viremia.This review aims to briefly summarize the current state 
of immunotherapy in cancer, guide clinicians in the management of immunotherapy 
in cancer PWH, and encourage the inclusion of PWH in clinical trials of cancer 
immunotherapy.

Supplementation of glucogenic precursors in roughage diets may increase 
production responses due to improved efficiencies of nutrient utilization. 
Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine the effect of source of 
supplemental glucogenic potential (GP) on forage digestibility, serum 
metabolites, energy utilization, and rumen parameters of growing wethers 
consuming a roughage diet (8.8% crude protein, 71.4% ash-free neutral detergent 
fiber). Crossbred wethers (49.1 ± 4.7 kg initial BW; n = 16) were utilized in a 
4 × 4 replicated Latin Square design with four periods of 21 d. Supplements were 
designed to supplement increasing amount of GP: 1) no supplementation (CON; 
0 g), 2) 40 g of calcium propionate (CAP; 30 g of GP), 3) 70 g of blood meal + 
100 g of feather meal (BF; 40 g of GP), or 4) combination of CAP and BF (COMBO; 
70 g of GP). Total fecal and urine collection was conducted from days 13-17 to 
calculate digestibility estimates and urinary losses. An acetate tolerance test 
was administered on day 17 to determine the effect of GP on acetate clearance. 
Blood samples were collected on day 19 and were analyzed for serum 
concentrations of glucose, urea N (SUN), non-esterified fatty acids, and amino 
acids. Rumen fluid was collected on day 21 to determine supplementation effects 
on ruminal volatile fatty acid (VFA) and ammonia concentrations. Wethers 
receiving BF and COMBO supplementation had greatest (P ≤ 0.01) DM and OM total 
tract digestibility. Supplementation did not affect (P ≥ 0.37) NDF digestibility 
or digestible energy. Urinary nitrogen excretion was greatest (P = 0.02) for BF 
and COMBO. Circulating serum essential amino acid concentration was increased (P 
< 0.01) in BF and COMBO compared to CAP and CON. In addition, BF and COMBO had 
increased (P < 0.01) SUN concentrations compared to CAP and CON. Acetate 
half-life was not affected (P = 0.39) by supplementation strategy. However, area 
under the curve (AUC) for acetate was decreased (P = 0.04) with supplementation 
of BF and COMBO compared to CON-fed wethers. Ruminal propionate concentration 
was increased (P ≤ 0.01) for wethers fed CAP and COMBO supplementation, which 
resulted in decreased (P ≤ 0.01) A:P ratio. Overall, these results indicate that 
the increased propionate supply by providing propionate salts did not result in 
a protein sparing impact or increased N retention.

A cost-benefit analysis of COVID-19 lockdowns in Australia.

This paper conducts a cost-benefit analysis of Australia's Covid-19 lockdown 
strategy relative to pursuit of a mitigation strategy in March 2020. The 
estimated additional deaths from a mitigation strategy are 11,500 to 40,000, 
implying a Cost per Quality Adjusted Life Year saved by locking down of at least 
11 times the generally employed figure of $100,000 for health interventions in 
Australia. The lockdowns do not then seem to have been justified by reference to 
the standard benchmark. Consideration of the information available to the 
Australian government in March 2020 yields a similar ratio and therefore the 
same conclusion that lockdown was not warranted. If Australia experiences a new 
outbreak, and cannot contain it without resort to a nationwide lockdown, the 
death toll from adopting a mitigation strategy at this point would be even less 
than had it done so in March 2020, due to the vaccination campaign, lessons 
learned since March 2020, and because the period over which the virus would then 
inflict casualties would now be much less than the period from March 2020. This 
would favour a mitigation policy even more strongly than in March 2020. This 
approach of assessing the savings in quality adjusted life years and comparing 
them to a standard benchmark figure ensures that all quality adjusted life years 
saved by various health interventions are treated equally, which accords with 
the ethical principle of equity across people.

BACKGROUND: Injurious falls in hospitals and care homes are a life-limiting and 
costly international issue. Shock-absorbing flooring may offer part of the 
solution; however, evidence is required to inform decision-making.
OBJECTIVES: The objectives were to assess the clinical effectiveness and 
cost-effectiveness of shock-absorbing flooring for fall-related injury 
prevention among older adults in care settings.
REVIEW METHODS: A systematic review was conducted of experimental, 
observational, qualitative and economic studies evaluating flooring in care 
settings targeting older adults and/or staff. Studies identified by a scoping 
review (inception to May 2016) were screened, and the search of MEDLINE, AgeLine 
and Scopus (to September 2019) was updated, alongside other sources. Two 
independent reviewers assessed risk of bias in duplicate (using Cochrane's Risk 
of Bias 2.0 tool, the Risk Of Bias In Non-randomized Studies - of Interventions 
tool, or the Joanna Briggs Institute's qualitative tool).
RESULTS: Of the 22 included studies, 20 assessed the outcomes (three randomised 
controlled trials; and seven observational, five qualitative and five economic 
studies) on novel floors (n = 12), sports floors (n = 5), carpet (n = 5) and 
wooden subfloors (n = 1). Quantitative data related to 11,857 patient/resident 
falls (nine studies) and 163 staff injuries (one study). Qualitative studies 
included patients/residents (n = 20), visitors (n = 8) and staff (n = 119). 
Hospital-based randomised controlled trial data were too imprecise; however, 
very low-quality evidence indicated that novel/sports flooring reduced injurious 
falls from three per 1000 patients per day on vinyl with concrete subfloors to 
two per 1000 patients per day (rate ratio 0.55, 95% confidence interval 0.36 to 
0.84; two studies), without increasing falls rates (two studies). One care 
home-based randomised controlled trial found that a novel underlay produces 
similar injurious falls rates (high-quality evidence) and falls rates 
(moderate-quality evidence) to those of a plywood underlay with vinyl overlays 
and concrete subfloors. Very low-quality data demonstrated that, compared with 
rigid floors, novel/sports flooring reduced the number of falls resulting in 
injury in care homes (26.4% vs. 33.0%; risk ratio 0.80, 95% confidence interval 
0.70 to 0.91; three studies) and hospitals (27.1% vs. 42.4%; risk ratio 0.64, 
95% confidence interval 0.44 to 0.93; two studies). Fracture and head injury 
outcomes were imprecise; however, hip fractures reduced from 30 per 1000 falls 
on concrete to 18 per 1000 falls on wooden subfloors in care homes (odds ratio 
0.59, 95% confidence interval 0.45 to 0.78; one study; very low-quality 
evidence). Four low-quality economic studies concluded that shock-absorbing 
flooring reduced costs and improved outcomes (three studies), or increased costs 
and improved outcomes (one study). One, more robust, study estimated that 
shock-absorbing flooring resulted in fewer quality-adjusted life-years and lower 
costs, if the number of falls increased on shock-absorbing floors, but that 
shock-absorbing flooring would be a dominant economic strategy if the number of 
falls remained the same. Staff found moving wheeled equipment more difficult on 
shock-absorbing floors, leading to workplace adaptations. Staff injuries were 
observed; however, very low-quality evidence suggests that these are no less 
frequent on rigid floors.
LIMITATIONS: Evidence favouring shock-absorbing flooring is of very low quality; 
thus, much uncertainty remains.
CONCLUSIONS: Robust evidence is lacking in hospitals and indicates that one 
novel floor may not be effective in care homes. Very low-quality evidence 
indicates that shock-absorbing floors may be beneficial; however, wider 
workplace implications need to be addressed. Work is required to establish a 
core outcome set, and future research needs to more comprehensively deal with 
confounding and the paucity of hospital-based studies, and better plan for 
workplace adaptations in the study design.
STUDY REGISTRATION: This study is registered as PROSPERO CRD42019118834.

website for further project information.

Plain Language Summary: AIM: The aim of this study was to summarise what is 
known about shock-absorbing flooring for reducing injurious falls in hospitals 
and care homes.
BACKGROUND: Falls and fall-related injuries are a major problem for older adults 
in both hospitals and care homes. Shock-absorbing flooring (such as carpet, 
sports floors or specially designed floors) provides a more cushioned surface 
and is one potential solution to help reduce the impact forces from a fall.
METHODS: From literature searches, we identified relevant studies on 
shock-absorbing flooring use in hospitals and care homes. We gathered data on 
the quality of the studies’ methods, what and who the studies involved, and the 
study findings. Members of the public were involved throughout the project. They 
helped improve the clarity of the reporting and collaborated in meetings to help 
guide the study team.
FINDINGS: One high-quality study in a care home found that vinyl overlay with 
novel shock-absorbing underlay was no better at reducing injuries than vinyl 
overlay with plywood underlay on concrete subfloors. We found very low-quality 
evidence that shock-absorbing flooring may reduce injuries in hospitals and care 
homes, without increasing falls; if this were true, then economic evidence 
suggested that shock-absorbing flooring would be the best-value option for 
patients (lower cost and improved outcomes). There was insufficient evidence to 
determine the effects of shock-absorbing flooring on fractures or head injuries, 
although wooden subfloors resulted in fewer hip fractures than concrete 
subfloors. Shock-absorbing flooring made it harder for staff to move equipment 
such as beds and trolleys, and led to staff changing how they work.
IMPLICATIONS: The evidence suggests that one type of shock-absorbing floor may 
not work in care homes, compared with rigid flooring; however, gaps still exist 
in the knowledge. The evidence in favour of shock-absorbing flooring was of very 
low quality, meaning it is uncertain. There is a lack of robust evidence in 
hospitals, which often have concrete subfloors and different population 
characteristics. If planning to install shock-absorbing flooring, it is 
important to consider the wider impacts on the workplace and how best to manage 
these.

As human life expectancy continues to increase and the birth rate continues to 
decline, the phenomenon of aging is becoming more prominent worldwide. 
Therefore, addressing the problems associated with global aging has become a 
current research focus. The main manifestations of human aging are structural 
degeneration and functional decline of aging tissues and organs, quality of life 
decline, decreased ability to resist diseases, and high incidence rates of a 
variety of senile degenerative diseases. Thus far, no ideal treatments have been 
found. Stem cell (SC) therapies have broad application prospects in the field of 
regenerative medicine due to the inherent biological characteristics of SCs, 
such as their plasticity, self-renewal, and multidirectional differentiation 
potential. Thus, SCs could delay or even reverse aging. This manuscript reviews 
the causes of human aging, the biological characteristics of SCs, and research 
progress on age reversal.

Intracardiac metastasis of cervical squamous cell carcinoma (C-SCC) is rare, 
with historically poor long-term survival. We report the case of a 55-year-old 
woman with prior metastatic C-SCC who was found to have a right ventricular mass 
causing functional pulmonic stenosis and multiple pulmonary emboli 19 months 
after her initial diagnosis. She underwent surgical resection to prevent further 
embolization and heart failure. Pathology confirmed metastatic C-SCC and she was 
maintained on adjuvant pembrolizumab. She remained well 32 months later without 
further disease progression. Surgical resection of intracardiac metastasis of 
C-SCC combined with pembrolizumab therapy may result in improved postoperative 
life expectancy.

BACKGROUND: Fine particulate matter pollution (PM2.5) is widely considered to be 
a top-ranked risk factor for premature mortality and years of life lost (YLL). 
However, evidence regarding the effect of daily air quality improvement on life 
expectancy is scarce, especially in the Middle East such as Iran. This study 
aimed to investigate the potential benefits in life expectancy at concentrations 
meeting the daily PM2.5 standards during 2012-2016 in Tehran, Iran.
METHODS: We collected daily non-accidental mortality and data on air pollutants 
and weather conditions from Tehran, Iran, 2012-2016. A quasi-Poisson or Gaussian 
time-series regression was employed to fit the associations between ambient 
PM2.5 and mortality or YLL. Potential gains in life expectancy (PGLE) and 
attributable fraction (AF) were estimated by assuming that daily PM2.5 
concentrations attained the World Health Organization air quality guidelines 
(WHO AQG) 2005 (25 μg/m3) and 2021 (15 μg/m3).
RESULTS: During the study period, a total of 221,231 non-accidental deaths were 
recorded in Tehran, resulting in 3.6 million YLL. The mean concentration of 
ambient PM2.5 was 34.7 μg/m3 (standard deviation: 15.3 μg/m3). For a 10-μg/m3 
rise in 4-day moving average (lag 03-day) in PM2.5 concentration, non-accidental 
mortality and YLL increased by 1.12% (95% confidence interval: 0.60, 1.65) and 
20.73 (7.08, 34.39) person years, respectively. A relatively higher effect was 
observed in males and young adults aged 18-64 years. We estimated that 39830 
[AF = 1.1%] and 74284 [AF = 2.1%] YLL could potentially be avoided if daily 
PM2.5 concentrations attained the WHO AQG 2005 and 2021, respectively, which 
corresponded to potential gains in life expectancy of 0.18 (0.06, 0.30) and 0.34 
(0.11, 0.56) years for each deceased person. PM2.5-associated PGLE estimates 
were largely robust when performing sensitivity analyses.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicated that short-term exposure to PM2.5 is 
associated with increased non-accidental YLL and mortality. Prolonged life 
expectancy could be achieved if the particulate matter air pollution level were 
kept under a stricter standard.

This study aims to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and long-term 
cost-effectiveness of fixed-dose busulfan (Bu) administration and 
pharmacokinetically (PK) guided adjustment of Bu dose for patients who underwent 
hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The efficacy and safety of both dosing 
strategies were compared using a systematic review and meta-analysis. A Markov 
model was used in estimating relevant cost and health outcomes from the 
perspective of the health system. The primary outcomes of interest were lifetime 
cost, quality adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained, and incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) in dollar per QALY gained. Results showed that 
progression-free survival and overall survival in the PK-guided group were 
higher than that in the fixed-dose group, and the PK-guided group was associated 
with low non-relapse mortality and relapse rate. In contrast to safety, the 
incidence of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was the same in the two 
groups (P > 0.05). Cost-effectiveness analysis showed that the QALY of the 
PK-guided group (12.8135 QALYs and $582,475.07) increased by 2.0609 relative to 
that in the fixed-dose group (10.7526 QALYs and $562,833.20), and the ICER was 
$9530.72/QALY. One-way and probability sensitivity analyses confirmed the 
reliability of the results. In conclusion, the PK-guided approach has higher 
efficacy and is safer.

Muscular dystrophies are a group of rare genetic disorders characterized by 
progressive muscle weakness, which, in the most severe forms, leads to the 
patient's death due to cardiorespiratory problems. There is still no cure 
available for these diseases and significant effort is being placed into 
developing new strategies to either correct the genetic defect or to compensate 
muscle loss by stimulating skeletal muscle regeneration. However, the vast 
anatomical extension of the target tissue poses great challenges to these goals, 
highlighting the need for complementary strategies. Nanomedicine is an actively 
evolving field that merges nanotechnologies with biomedical and pharmaceutical 
sciences. It holds great potential in regenerative medicine, both in supporting 
tissue engineering and regeneration, and in optimizing drug and oligonucleotide 
delivery and gene therapy strategies. In this review, we will summarize the 
state-of-the-art in the field of nanomedicine applied to skeletal muscle 
regeneration. We will discuss the recent work toward the development of 
nanopatterned scaffolds for tissue engineering, the efforts in the synthesis of 
organic and inorganic nanoparticles for gene therapy and drug delivery 
applications, as well as their use as immune modulators. Although nanomedicine 
holds great promise for muscle and other degenerative diseases, many challenges 
still need to be systematically addressed to assure a smooth transition from the 
bench to the bedside. This article is categorized under: Implantable Materials 
and Surgical Technologies > Nanotechnology in Tissue Repair and Replacement.

BACKGROUND: Significant improvements in breast cancer survival have been made in 
the past few decades in many developed countries including Australia with a 
five-year relative survival of 90%. The aim of the present study is to obtain a 
brief estimate of the relative importance of demographic factors such as 
rurality, socio-economic standard and ethnicity versus traditional risk factors 
for women diagnosed with breast cancer in Far North Queensland, Australia.
METHODS: This was a retrospective longitudinal study of all women diagnosed with 
their first episode of breast cancer in 1999-2013 in Far North Queensland, 
Australia. Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was used to identify 
factors independently associated with mortality for women with any type of 
breast cancer (in situ or invasive) and for women with invasive cancer. Life 
tables were used to assess five and ten-year absolute survival. Standard linear 
regression and binary logistic regression were used to identify any association 
between demographic factors and late presentation.
RESULTS: Five and ten-year absolute survival was 0.90 and 0.86 respectively. 
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander status, remoteness of area of residence, 
and socioeconomic status were not associated with more advanced disease at 
presentation or increased risk of breast cancer death. Only traditional risk 
factors such as increased tumour size, absence of progesterone receptor, high 
tumour grade and presence of metastasis in axillary lymph nodes were associated 
with increased risk of breast cancer death.
CONCLUSION: The effect of the classical risk factors on breast cancer mortality 
outweighs the effects of demographic factors. The fact that ethnicity, 
remoteness and socioeconomic status is not associated with late presentation or 
breast cancer death suggests that given appropriate resources it may be possible 
to close the gap of inequalities in breast cancer.

The Community as the Unit of Healing: Conceptualizing Social Determinants of 
Health and Well-Being for Older American Indian Adults.

Author information:

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Multiple racial and social inequities shape health 
and access to health care for American Indian Elders, who have a lower life 
expectancy than all other aging populations in the United States. This 
qualitative study examines how upstream social determinants of health influence 
Elders' ability to access and use health care.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Between June 2016 and March 2017, we conducted 
individual, semistructured interviews with 96 American Indian Elders, aged 55 
and older, and 47 professionals involved in planning or delivering care to 
Elders in 2 states in the U.S. Southwest. Transcripts were analyzed iteratively 
using grounded theory approaches, including open and focused coding. A group of 
American Indian Elders and allies called the Seasons of Care Community Action 
Board guided interpretation and prioritization of findings.
RESULTS: Participants described multiple barriers that hindered Elders' ability 
to access health care services and providers, which were largely tied to funding 
shortages and bureaucratic complexities associated with health care and 
insurance systems. Where available, community resources bridged service gaps and 
helped Elders navigate systems.
DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Longstanding structural inequities for American 
Indians manifest in barriers to health equity, many of which are situated at the 
community level. These are compounded by additional disparities affecting older 
adults, rural residents, and marginalized citizens in general. Findings 
underscore the importance of health and policy initiatives for American Indian 
Elders that emphasize the community as the focus of intervention.

Due to the presence of blood-brain barrier (BBB), various chemotherapy drugs 
against B-cell lymphoma cannot be effectively transmitted into the brain, 
leading to poor prognosis of primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL). 
Exosomes can cross the BBB as a bio- and immune-compatible drug carrier. In this 
study, we developed a novel drug delivery system, in which the exosomes (Exo) 
are conjugated with anti-CD22 monoclonal antibody fragments (CD22-F(ab')2) and 
encapsulate doxorubicin (DOX) to form CD22-F(ab')2-Exo-DOX. We showed that 
CD22-F(ab')2-Exo-DOX can cross BBB and deliver DOX precisely to tumor cells. The 
average apoptosis rate of lymphoma cells was 84.60% ± 10.69%. The tumor-bearing 
mice treated with CD22-F(ab')2-Exo-DOX have significantly prolonged life 
expectancy and the enhanced anti-tumor activity. CD22-F(ab')2-Exo-DOX might be 
ingested by brain microvascular endothelial cells through endocytosis to cross 
the BBB. Therefore, targeted chemotherapy mediated by CD22-F(ab')2-Exo-DOX is a 
promising option for the treatment of PCNSL.

INTRODUCTION: The prevalence of squamous cell carcinoma of the eyeball is low, 
and this is a rare condition. There are multiple therapeutic strategies for the 
treatment and depend on the degree of local involvement and extension of the 
tumor which, in turn, will have an impact on the patient's prognosis.
PRESENTATION OF CASE: We present a case of a patient with a mass of progressive 
growth on the left eyeball whit vision damage. The biopsy showed a squamous cell 
carcinoma of the conjunctiva, and imaging studies showed orbital invasion 
cT4bN0cM0, so surgery was indicated. The surgery was done with macroscopic 
margins of 5 mm. After resection, a radial free flap reconstruction was 
performed. Adjuvant treatment with radiotherapy was performed without 
complications. After six months, the patient manifested an improvement in his 
quality of life, and there is no evidence of relapse.
DISCUSSION: The prevalence of squamous cell carcinoma of the conjunctiva is low. 
The most important risk factor is exposure to UV rays. Most are derived from 
conjunctival intraepithelial neoplasms. There are topical management protocols 
with chemotherapeutic agents and in patients with ocular or orbital invasion, 
enucleation and exanteration are the treatments of choice.
CONCLUSION: The squamous cell carcinoma of the conjunctive is rare. The 
management in the locally advanced tumors is surgical. The use of a radial free 
flap reconstruction is one of the reconstructive strategies to take into 
account, and the knowledge of additional strategies required to control the 
disease is important to ensure an optimal treatment.

An ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE) was optimized for the extraction of 
bioactive compound (total phenolic compound and total flavonoid content) with 
antioxidant activity (DPPH and FRAP assays) using response surface methodology 
based on Box-Behnken design (BBD). The effect of extraction temperature (X1: 
30-70 °C), extraction time (X2: 25-45 min) and amplitude (X3: 30-50%) were 
determined. In addition, antimicrobial activity and application of optimized 
makiang seed extract (MSE) were also evaluated. Results showed that the optimum 
condition of UAE were X1: 51.82 °C, X2: 31.87 min and X3: 40.51%. It was also 
found that gallic acid was the major phenolic compound of optimized MSE and its 
minimum inhibitiory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration 
(MBC) was between 1.56 - 6.25 and 25-100 mg/mL respectively. The addition of MSE 
could enhance the stability of orange juice and shelf life extension was also 
obtained. This research finding suggests the beneficial opportunities for 
ultrasound-assisted extraction for the production of bioactive compound from 
makiang seed with antioxidant activity leading to an application in medicinal 
and functional food industry.

PURPOSE: To describe the clinical features, histopathology, treatment, and 
outcomes of patients with ocular surface squamous neoplasia (OSSN) presenting to 
a referral centre in India.
METHODS: Retrospective interventional study.
RESULTS: Of 438 patients, the mean age at presentation was 49 years. Human 
immunodeficiency virus infection was noted in 72 (16%), xeroderma pigmentosum in 
22 (5%), hepatitis B virus infection in 14 (3%), and systemic cancer in 8 (2%) 
patients. Tumor pigmentation was noted in 243 (54%) tumors with a mean 
percentage of tumor pigmentation of 44% (median, 40%; range, 1 to 100%). 
Intraocular tumor extension was noted in 12 (3%), and orbital tumor extension in 
16 (4%) eyes. Of the 381 treated lesions, excisional biopsy (n = 247; 65%) was 
the most common treatment modality. Of the 311 lesions with histopathology 
diagnosis of OSSN, invasive squamous cell carcinoma (n = 92; 30%) was the most 
common. Over a mean follow-up period of 11 months (median, 5 months; range, 1 to 
108 months) in 368 patients, tumor recurrence was noted in 16 (4%) eyes, globe 
salvage was achieved in 341 (90%) eyes, vision salvage in 338 (89%) eyes, 
regional lymph node metastasis occurred in 9 (2%), and metastasis-related death 
in 9 (2%) patients.
CONCLUSION: Pigmented OSSN is common in Asian Indian population. Appropriate 
management of OSSN is associated with good vision, globe, and life salvage rates 
in India.

BACKGROUND: The assessment of patient-reported outcomes in clinical trials has 
enormous potential to promote patient-centred care, but for this potential to be 
realized, the patient-reported outcomes must be captured effectively and 
communicated clearly. Over the past decade, methodologic tools have been 
developed to inform the design, analysis, reporting, and interpretation of 
patient-reported outcome data from clinical trials. We formed the PROTEUS-Trials 
Consortium (Patient-Reported Outcomes Tools: Engaging Users and Stakeholders) to 
disseminate and implement these methodologic tools.
METHODS: PROTEUS-Trials are engaging with patient, clinician, research, and 
regulatory stakeholders from 27 organizations in the United States, Canada, 
Australia, the United Kingdom, and Europe to develop both organization-specific 
and cross-cutting strategies for implementing and disseminating the methodologic 
tools. Guided by the Knowledge-to-Action framework, we conducted consortium-wide 
webinars and meetings, as well as individual calls with participating 
organizations, to develop a workplan, which we are currently executing.
RESULTS: Six methodologic tools serve as the foundation for PROTEUS-Trials 
dissemination and implementation efforts: the Standard Protocol Items: 
Recommendations for Interventional Trials-patient-reported outcome extension for 
writing protocols with patient-reported outcomes, the International Society for 
Quality of Life Research Minimum Standards for selecting a patient-reported 
outcome measure, Setting International Standards in Analysing Patient-Reported 
Outcomes and Quality of Life Endpoints Data Consortium recommendations for 
patient-reported outcome data analysis, the Consolidated Standards for Reporting 
of Trials-patient-reported outcome extension for reporting clinical trials with 
patient-reported outcomes, recommendations for the graphic display of 
patient-reported outcome data, and a Clinician's Checklist for reading and using 
an article about patient-reported outcomes. The PROTEUS-Trials website 
(www.TheProteusConsortium.org) serves as a central repository for the 
methodologic tools and associated resources. To date, we have developed (1) a 
roadmap to visually display where each of the six methodologic tools applies 
along the clinical trial trajectory, (2) web tutorials that provide guidance on 
the methodologic tools at different levels of detail, (3) checklists to provide 
brief summaries of each tool's recommendations, (4) a handbook to provide a 
self-guided approach to learning about the tools and recommendations, and (5) 
publications that address key topics related to patient-reported outcomes in 
clinical trials. We are also conducting organization-specific activities, 
including meetings, presentations, workshops, and webinars to publicize the 
existence of the methodologic tools and the PROTEUS-Trials resources. Work to 
develop communications strategies to ensure that PROTEUS-Trials reach key 
audiences with relevant information about patient-reported outcomes in clinical 
trials and PROTEUS-Trials is ongoing.
DISCUSSION: The PROTEUS-Trials Consortium aims to help researchers generate 
patient-reported outcome data from clinical trials to (1) enable investigators, 
regulators, and policy-makers to take the patient perspective into account when 
conducting research and making decisions; (2) help patients understand treatment 
options and make treatment decisions; and (3) inform clinicians' discussions 
with patients regarding treatment options. In these ways, the PROTEUS Consortium 
promotes patient-centred research and care.
