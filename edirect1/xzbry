BACKGROUND: The relationships between group size, survival, and longevity vary 
greatly among social species. Depending on demographic and ecological 
circumstances, there are both positive and negative effects of group size 
variation on individual survival and longevity. For socially foraging species in 
particular there may be an optimal group size that predicts maximum individual 
survival that is directly related to the potential for information transfer, 
social coordination, and costs of conspecific interference. Our aim was to 
investigate this central aspect of evolutionary ecology by focusing on a 
socially foraging bat, Molossus molossus. This species optimizes foraging 
success by eavesdropping on the echolocation calls of group members to locate 
ephemeral food patches. We expected to find the highest survival and longest 
lifespans in small groups as a consequence of a trade-off between benefits of 
information transfer on ephemeral resources and costs of conspecific 
interference.
RESULTS: In a mark-recapture study of 14 mixed-sex M. molossus social groups in 
Gamboa, Panama, spanning several years we found the expected relatively small 
and intermediate, but stable groups, with a mean size of 9.6 ± 6.7 adults and 
juveniles. We estimated survival proxies using Cox proportional hazard models 
and multistate-mark recapture models generated with recapture data as well as 
automated monitoring of roost entrances in a subset of the groups. Median 
survival of females was very short with 1.8 years and a maximum estimated 
longevity of 5.6 years. Contrary to our expectations, we found no relationship 
between variation in group size and survival, a result similar to few other 
studies.
CONCLUSIONS: Strong selection towards small group size may result from 
psychoacoustic and cognitive constraints related to acoustic interference in 
social foraging and the complexity of coordinated flight. The short lifespans 
were unexpected and may result from life at the energetic edge due to a highly 
specialized diet. The absence of a relationship between group size and survival 
may reflect a similar but optimized survival within the selected range of group 
sizes. We expect the pattern of small group sizes will be consistent in future 
research on species dependent on social information transfer about ephemeral 
resources.

BACKGROUND: Behavioural problems are common among adolescents. The burden on 
society in social disturbance, health, failures to contribute and costs has 
triggered innovative community-based interventions such as multisystemic therapy 
(MST).
AIMS: Our aim was to compare the cost-effectiveness of MST and treatment as 
usual (TAU).
METHODS: Cost-effectiveness was assessed alongside a randomised clinical trial. 
One hundred and sixteen adolescents were allocated to MST or TAU. Follow-up 
lasted six months. Quality of life (EQ-5D) as perceived by the adolescents was 
the primary outcome. A societal perspective was used for cost assessment.
RESULTS: There was no significant difference between groups in the small 
improvement experienced in quality of life (EQ-5D average score improvement in 
both 0.02 points, standard deviation 0.13 MST; 0.23 TAU). Dropout before 
follow-up was 48% and 69% respectively. Overall costs attributed to these young 
people were, however, 50% lower in the MST group. The incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was 384,633€ (95% CI: -2,001,433 to 2,024,681€), 
which indicates dominance of MST over TAU.
CONCLUSIONS/IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Our study shows that, at worst, MST 
offers no advantage to young offenders in terms of their experienced quality of 
life, but 'TAU' included family focused intervention as well as standard 
supervision. There were some cost advantages for the individual and his/her 
family in the MST group, but substantial cost benefits for wider society. The 
case for a large, multi-centre, perhaps international trial is strong as 
widespread implementation of MST would benefit everyone if these findings are 
confirmed. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Despite overwhelming evidence demonstrating a persisting gap in life expectancy 
between those with psychotic illness and the general population, there has been 
no widespread implementation of interventions to improve the physical wellbeing 
of people with psychotic illness. This article explores opportunities to 'Bridge 
the Gap' in life expectancy. We describe an Australian evidence-based 
intervention that has substantially improved the physical health of young people 
recently commenced on antipsychotic medication. Further epidemiological 
research, accompanied by cultural change within mental health services, is an 
essential precursor to the implementation of effective and sustainable lifestyle 
interventions. There are other relatively neglected areas of physical wellbeing 
for people with psychotic illness, such as screening and diagnosis of 
malignancies, which need more research and clinical attention. While there has 
been progress with intervention development and evaluation, translation of 
evidence-based short-term intervention studies into feasible and sustainable 
system-wide changes within routine mental health service settings remains a 
challenge. Developing an implementation framework to support such change is an 
urgent priority so as to bridge the persisting premature mortality in people 
living with psychotic illness.

Patau syndrome was first described in 1960 as a group of birth defects caused by 
trisomy of chromosome 13 (T13). Providing accurate information and relevant 
reproductive genetic counseling that would allow parents to make informed 
decisions is not easily accomplished because of the limited information 
available prenatally. Only 1/3 of all cases of T13 are diagnosed prenatally, 
which means it cannot be expected that most cases will be detected early in 
pregnancy, that the parents will decide to terminate the pregnancy, and that 
difficulties will be avoided. There is no good prenatal screening for T13, and 
there are many kinds and degrees of anomalies. About 60% of cases are first 
detected in the second trimester, and life expectancy is difficult to predict. 
When patients choose not to terminate pregnancy, or when the pregnancy has 
progressed to a viable gestational age, pregnancy termination is no longer an 
option. Also, nowadays 12% of couples choose to continue pregnancy following 
chromosomal confirmation of a suspected T13. The aim of this work is to 
eludicate for health care providers what problems they are likely to face in the 
care of children with T13 and in contact with their parents. It is crucial for 
the management of each case to discuss neonatal procedures of resuscitation, 
alternatives to aggressive resuscitation, the possibilities for correcting some 
of the defects, and to be prepared to guide the parents through the trauma of 
having a child with a lethal defect.

OBJECTIVES: The increasing frequency of skin tumors and longer life expectancy 
of the general population are likely to increase the frequency of dermatological 
surgery among elderly patients. The purpose of this study is to assess the rate 
of postoperative complications related to dermatological surgery in elderly 
patients and highlight the factors associated with these complications.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective monocentric study of patients aged >75 
years who presented at our multidisciplinary consultation specialized for skin 
tumors from January 2008 to December 2010. The clinical characteristics, 
demographic information, and cancer history of these patients were analyzed. 
Postoperative complications (dehiscence, infection, hematomas, and other 
sequelae) were identified to establish the postoperative complication rate and 
determine risk factors.
RESULTS: We included 241 patients. Basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell 
carcinoma, and melanoma accounted for 46%, 25%, and 28% of tumors, respectively. 
Skin carcinomas were mainly located on the face (93% of basal cell carcinomas 
and 72% of squamous cell carcinomas), and melanomas were mainly located on the 
limbs (50%). The average number of comorbidities was 3.0±1.5. The average 
postoperative complication rate was 20%. Multivariate analysis identified three 
independent risk factors: male gender (p<0.033), histological type (squamous 
cell carcinoma and melanoma) (p<0.008), and insufficient surgical resection 
(p<0.004).
CONCLUSION: This study highlighted a high rate of postoperative complications in 
this elderly population. Three significant postoperative risk factors were 
identified. They may be used to assess a patient's operational risk as well as 
geriatric assessment tools.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of cardiac CT compared with exercise 
stress testing (EST) in improving the health-related quality of life of patients 
with stable chest pain.
METHODS: A cost-utility analysis alongside a single-centre randomised controlled 
trial carried out in Northern Ireland. Patients with stable chest pain were 
randomised to undergo either cardiac CT assessment or EST (standard care). The 
main outcome measure was cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained at 
1 year.
RESULTS: Of the 500 patients recruited, 250 were randomised to cardiac CT and 
250 were randomised to EST. Cardiac CT was the dominant strategy as it was both 
less costly (incremental total costs -£50.45; 95% CI -£672.26 to £571.36) and 
more effective (incremental QALYs 0.02; 95% CI -0.02 to 0.05) than EST. At a 
willingness-to-pay threshold of £20 000 per QALY the probability of cardiac CT 
being cost-effective was 83%. Subgroup analyses indicated that cardiac CT 
appears to be most cost-effective in patients with a likelihood of coronary 
artery disease (CAD) of <30%, followed by 30%-60% and then >60%.
CONCLUSIONS: Cardiac CT is cost-effective compared with EST and 
cost-effectiveness was observed to vary with likelihood of CAD. This finding 
could have major implications for how patients with chest pain in the UK are 
assessed, however it would need to be validated in other healthcare systems.

BACKGROUND: Anticipating adverse outcomes guides decisions but can be 
particularly challenging in heart failure.
AIM: We sought to assess the accuracy and comfort of physicians in predicting 
prognosis in heart failure.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey
PARTICIPANTS/SETTING: Faculty and trainees in internal medicine, cardiology, and 
oncology estimated survival for three standardized patients: (1) 59-year-old 
patient with stage IV lung cancer; (2) 79-year-old woman with New York Heart 
Association class 4 heart failure symptoms and preserved ejection fraction; and 
(3) 40-year-old man with New York Heart Association class 3 heart failure 
symptoms and reduced ejection fraction of 20%. Survival predictions were derived 
from surveillance, epidemiology, and end results-Medicare database and the 
Seattle Heart Failure Model. Accuracy was defined as <2-fold difference between 
the clinician and model estimate.
RESULTS: Totally, 79% (338/427) of participants responded. Physicians were more 
accurate in survival estimates for lung cancer than heart failure (74% vs 48%, 
respectively; p < 0.001). Cardiologists were more accurate in predicting 
survival in heart failure symptoms and reduced ejection fraction compared to 
generalists (67% vs 45%; p = 0.005) and oncologists (39%; p = 0.041) but no 
different at predicting heart failure symptoms and preserved ejection fraction. 
Cardiologists predicted longer survival in heart failure compared to others 
(p < 0.05). Physicians felt more uncomfortable discussing palliative care with 
heart failure patients compared to lung cancer.
CONCLUSIONS: Less than half of physicians accurately estimate survival in heart 
failure. Cardiologists were more accurate than other specialties for heart 
failure symptoms and reduced ejection fraction but no different for heart 
failure symptoms and preserved ejection fraction.

BACKGROUND: Cancer patients' preferences regarding disclosure of prognosis and 
end-of-life care remain under-reported from low- and middle-income countries 
where cancer poses an increasing demand on scarce healthcare resources. A better 
knowledge of these preferences can help in achievement of shared treatment 
goals.
AIM: To survey preferences of adult cancer patients regarding disclosure of 
prognosis and end-of-life care
DESIGN: A multidimensional questionnaire was developed to survey consecutively 
sampled patients. A fifth of the participants completed a repeat survey 3 months 
later.
SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Adult patients at a specialist cancer center in Pakistan.
RESULTS: In total, 520 patients were surveyed initially (participation rate 
98.6%) and 100 completed the repeat survey. Three in five respondents wanted a 
healthcare provider to give them detailed information about their prognosis and 
life expectancy. Those who wanted information withheld were significantly more 
likely to be female, to have a lower socioeconomic status, or to have lung 
cancer. Only two in five patients agreed that they wanted to die at home and 
more than 90% wanted all possible care till end-of-life. Yet, a little over half 
also agreed that they did not wish to be placed on a ventilator. In rank 
ordering preferences about end-of-life, respondents ranked "religious wellbeing" 
as the highest and "avoiding inappropriate prolongation of dying" as the lowest 
of six options.
CONCLUSION: A majority of adult cancer patients surveyed in this study wanted a 
truthful disclosure about their disease prognosis and expressed a preference for 
hospital-based care at end-of-life. Healthcare providers should find ways to 
tailor prognostic information to patients' expressed information needs.

An Age Old Problem? Estimating the Impact of Dementia on Past Human Populations.

Smith M(1), Atkin A(2), Cutler C(1).

Author information:
(1)1 Bournemouth University, Poole, Dorset, UK.
(2)2 University of Sheffield, UK.

OBJECTIVE: To model the impact of dementia on past societies.
METHOD: We consider multiple lines of evidence indicating elderly individuals to 
have been more common throughout the past than is frequently accepted. We then 
apply known dementia incidence/prevalence rates to plausible assumptions of past 
population structures to suggest prevalence in the past.
RESULTS: Dementia prevalence in premodern societies is likely to have been 
around 5% of the rate seen in modern, developed countries but with a total past 
incidence running into billions.
DISCUSSION: Dementia is often seen as a "modern" challenge that humans have not 
had to contend with before. We argue that this condition has had considerably 
greater effects than previously envisaged and is a challenge that humans have 
already withstood successfully, on one hand at a lower incidence but on the 
other without the considerable clinical, technological, and social advances that 
have been made in recent times.

Social Structural Influences on Healthy Aging: Community-Level Socioeconomic 
Conditions and Survival Probability of Becoming a Centenarian for Those Aged 65 
to 69 in South Korea.

This study estimated the associations between community-level socioeconomic 
conditions and survival probability of becoming a centenarian (SPBC) for those 
aged 65 to 69 in South Korea to determine the social structural influences on 
healthy aging. The indicators of socioeconomic and data of centenarians were 
obtained from Statistics Korea database 2014: population census and social 
survey. Significant positive correlations were found between SPBC and 
community-level socioeconomic conditions (minimum cost of living and 
economically active population, water supply and sewerage, pave a road with 
asphalt, and urbanization). SPBC male and female predictors had higher economic 
level and base facilities (R2)=0.578, p<.001). The study provides evidence that 
community-level socioeconomic conditions are important correlates of SPBC for 
those aged 65 to 69 in South Korea. These strategies should include social 
structural influences on successful aging in the overall socioeconomic 
conditions.

Estimating mortality using data from civil registration: a cross-sectional study 
in India.

Research, Chandigarh 160012, India .

Canberra, Australia .

OBJECTIVE: To analyse the design and operational status of India's civil 
registration and vital statistics system and facilitate the system's development 
into an accurate and reliable source of mortality data.
METHODS: We assessed the national civil registration and vital statistics 
system's legal framework, administrative structure and design through document 
review. We did a cross-sectional study for the year 2013 at national level and 
in Punjab state to assess the quality of the system's mortality data through 
analyses of life tables and investigation of the completeness of death 
registration and the proportion of deaths assigned ill-defined causes. We 
interviewed registrars, medical officers and coders in Punjab state to assess 
their knowledge and practice.
FINDINGS: Although we found the legal framework and system design to be 
appropriate, data collection was based on complex intersectoral collaborations 
at state and local level and the collected data were found to be of poor 
quality. The registration data were inadequate for a robust estimate of 
mortality at national level. A medically certified cause of death was only 
recorded for 965,992 (16.8%) of the 5,735,082 deaths registered.
CONCLUSION: The data recorded by India's civil registration and vital statistics 
system in 2011 were incomplete. If improved, the system could be used to 
reliably estimate mortality. We recommend improving political support and 
intersectoral coordination, capacity building, computerization and state-level 
initiatives to ensure that every death is registered and that reliable causes of 
death are recorded - at least within an adequate sample of registration units 
within each state.

Publisher: OBJECTIF: Analyser la conception et la situation opérationnelle du 
système indien d'enregistrement et de statistiques de l'état civil et favoriser 
l'évolution du système en une source précise et fiable de données sur la 
mortalité.
MÉTHODES: Nous avons évalué le cadre juridique, la structure administrative et 
la conception du système national d'enregistrement et de statistiques de l'état 
civil à travers une étude de documents. Nous avons réalisé une étude 
transversale pour l'année 2013, à l'échelle nationale et dans l'État du Pendjab, 
afin d'évaluer la qualité des données du système sur la mortalité; à cet effet, 
nous avons analysé les tables de mortalité et examiné le caractère complet des 
enregistrements de décès ainsi que la proportion de décès inscrits comme étant 
dus à des maladies. Nous avons interrogé des officiers de l'état civil, des 
médecins et des codeurs de l'État du Pendjab afin d'évaluer leurs connaissances 
et leur pratique.
RÉSULTATS: Bien que le cadre juridique et la conception du système aient été 
appropriés, le recueil de données reposait sur des collaborations 
intersectorielles complexes, au niveau local et de l’État, et les données 
recueillies étaient de mauvaise qualité. Les données enregistrées ne 
permettaient pas d'estimer correctement la mortalité au niveau national. Une 
cause de décès certifiée médicalement n'était notée que pour 965 992 (16,8%) des 
5 735 082 décès enregistrés.
CONCLUSION: Les données enregistrées en 2011 par le système indien 
d'enregistrement et de statistiques de l'état civil étaient incomplètes. Une 
fois amélioré, ce système pourrait permettre de faire une estimation fiable de 
la mortalité. Nous recommandons de renforcer le soutien politique ainsi que la 
coordination intersectorielle, les compétences, l'informatisation et les 
initiatives menées à l'échelle de l'État afin de s'assurer que chaque décès soit 
enregistré et que des causes de décès fiables soient notées – au moins dans une 
partie des unités d'état civil de chaque État.

del sistema hacia una fuente precisa y fiable de datos de mortalidad.
MÉTODOS: Se evaluó el marco legal, la estructura administrativa y el diseño del 
sistema nacional de registro civil y de estadísticas vitales a través de la 
revisión de documentos. Se llevó a cabo un estudio transversal del año 2013 a 
nivel nacional y en el estado de Punjab para evaluar la calidad de los datos de 
mortalidad del sistema a través del análisis de tablas de mortalidad y se 
investigó la exhaustividad del registro de defunciones y la proporción de 
defunciones atribuidas a causas no definidas. Se entrevistó a agentes de 
registro, oficiales médicos y codificadores del estado de Punjab para evaluar 
sus conocimientos y experiencia.
RESULTADOS: Aunque se observó que el marco legal y el diseño del sistema eran 
apropiados, la recopilación de datos estaba basada en colaboraciones 
intersectoriales complejas a nivel estatal y local y se descubrió que los datos 
recogidos eran de mala calidad. Los datos de registro eran inadecuados para una 
buena estimación de la mortalidad a nivel nacional. Solo se documentó una causa 
de muerte médicamente certificada para 965.992 (16,8%) de las 5.735.082 
defunciones registradas.
CONCLUSIÓN: Los datos registrados por el sistema de registro civil y de 
estadísticas vitales de India en 2011 fueron incompletos. Si se mejorase, el 
sistema podría utilizarse para estimar la mortalidad de forma fiable. Se 
recomienda mejorar el apoyo político y la coordinación intersectorial, el 
aumento de capacidad, la informatización y las iniciativas a nivel estatal para 
asegurar que se registran todas las defunciones y que se documentan causas de 
muerte fiables, al menos dentro de unas unidades de muestra de registro 
adecuadas para cada estado.

Publisher: الغرض: تحليل خطة نظام التسجيل المدني والإحصاءات الحيوية والوضعية 
التنفيذية له بالهند وتيسير تطوير هذا النظام ليصبح مصدرًا دقيقًا وموثوقًا به فيما 
يتعلق ببيانات الوفيات.
الطريقة: أجرينا تقييمًا لنظام التسجيل المدني والإحصاءات الحيوية على المستوى 
المحلي فيما يتعلق بالإطار القانوني والهيكل الإداري والخطة الخاصة به، وذلك من 
خلال مراجعة الوثائق. وأجرينا دراسة متعددة القطاعات لعام 2013 على المستوى المحلي 
وفي ولاية البنجاب لتقييم جودة بيانات الوفيات بالنظام من خلال تحليلات جداول 
الوفيات واستقصاء اكتمال تسجيل حالات الوفاة ونسبة حالات الوفاة المسندة إلى أسباب 
تفتقر إلى دقة التحديد. وأجرينا مقابلات مع موظفي السجل المدني، ومسؤولي الخدمات 
الطبية، ومسؤولي الترميز الإحصائي في ولاية البنجاب لتقييم ما لديهم من معلومات 
ولتقييم ممارساتهم.
النتائج: على الرغم من أننا رأينا أن الإطار القانوني وخطة النظام ملائمان، اعتمد 
جمع البيانات على أنشطة تعاونية معقدة فيما بين القطاعات على مستوى الولاية وعلى 
المستوى المحلي، كما أننا توصلنا إلى أن البيانات التي تم جمعها شابها تدني مستوى 
الجودة. وكانت البيانات المتوفرة بنظام التسجيل غير ملائمة لإجراء تقييم متقن لمعدل 
الوفيات على المستوى المحلي. وتم فقط تسجيل سبب الوفاة الصادر به شهادة طبية لعدد 
من حالات الوفاة يبلغ 965,992 (16.8%) من بين 5,735,082 من حالات الوفاة التي تم 
تسجيلها.
الاستنتاج: لقد شاب النقصان البيانات المسجلَّة من جانب نظام التسجيل المدني 
والإحصاءات الحيوية بالهند لعام 2011. وإذا تم تحسينها، يمكن استخدام هذا النظام 
لتقدير معدل الوفيات على نحو جدير بالثقة. ونوصي بتحسين الدعم السياسي والتنسيق 
فيما بين القطاعات، وبناء القدرات، واستخدام أجهزة الكمبيوتر، والمبادرات على مستوى 
الولاية لضمان تسجيل كل حالة وفاة وتدوين أسباب الوفاة الموثوق بها - في نطاق عينة 
وافية على الأقل من وحدات التسجيل داخل كل ولاية.

Publisher: 目的: 旨在分析印度户籍和生命统计体系的设计和运行状态，促使该体系成为精确可靠的死亡数据来源。.
方法: 
通过文档审核，我们评估了该国户籍和生命统计体系的法律框架、管理结构和设计。根据 2013 年的国家数据，我们在旁遮普邦展开了一项横断面调查，通过分析生命表和调查死亡登记的完整性以及被认定为因不明原因而死亡的比例，评估该体系死亡数据的精确性。 
我们访问了旁遮普邦户籍员、卫生官员和编码员，以评估其知识和实践能力。.
结果: 
尽管我们发现法律框架和体系设计合理，但是由于数据收集仍基于邦和地方复杂的跨部门合作，我们发现所收集的数据仍不准确。登记数据无法用于精确估计全国死亡率。根据记录，登记的 5 735 082 例死亡中，死因经医学证明的案例仅为 965 992 例 (16.8%)。结论 印度户籍和生命统计体系 2011 年记录的数据不完整。如果经过改进，可使用该体系对死亡率进行可靠评估。我们建议改进政策支持和跨部门协作，能力构建、计算机化和邦级举措，确保登记每一例死亡并记下可靠的死因——至少在各邦登记部门的精确样例中照此登记。.

Publisher: ЦЕЛЬ: Проанализировать строение и рабочее состояние системы 
регистрации актов гражданского состояния и статистики естественного движения 
населения в Индии и содействовать превращению системы в точный и достоверный 
источник данных о смертности.
МЕТОДЫ: Путем изучения документации нами была проведена оценка юридической базы, 
на основании которой функционируют система регистрации актов гражданского 
состояния и статистики естественного движения населения, а также их 
административная структура и схема. В течение 2013 года было проведено 
одномоментное поперечное исследование на национальном уровне и на уровне штата 
Пенджаб для оценки качества данных о смертности, предоставляемых системой; 
оценка проводилась путем анализа таблиц смертности по поколениям и изучения 
полноты записей при регистрации смерти, а также путем определения доли смертей, 
для которых причины были определены неточно. Были опрошены сотрудники ЗАГСов, 
медицинские сотрудники и кодировщики, работающие в штате Пенджаб, для оценки их 
знания и практических методов работы.
РЕЗУЛЬТАТЫ: Хотя юридическая база и организационная схема системы были оценены 
как приемлемые, сам сбор данных на уровне штата и на местном уровне опирался на 
сложную систему межсекторальных взаимодействий и собранные данные оказались 
низкого качества. Данные регистрации не удовлетворяли требованиям твердой оценки 
смертности на национальном уровне. Из 5 735 082 зарегистрированных смертей 
медицинская справка о причине смерти была выдана только в 965 992 случаях 
(16,8%).
ВЫВОД: Данные, зарегистрированные в системе записи актов гражданского состояния 
и статистики естественного движения населения Индии в течение 2011 года, были 
неполными. При условии внесения улучшений система может послужить для 
достоверной оценки уровня смертности. Рекомендуется улучшить политическую 
поддержку на уровне стратегического планирования и межсекторальной координации, 
развивать мощности, внедрять компьютеризацию и проявлять инициативы на уровне 
штатов, чтобы гарантировать регистрацию каждой смерти с указанием достоверно 
установленной ее причины хотя бы в пределах соответствующей выборки по 
регистрационным отделениям в каждом штате.

Older adults fighting obesity with bariatric surgery: Benefits, side effects, 
and outcomes.

University, Fargo, ND, USA.

The aging population is growing exponentially worldwide. Associated with this 
greater life expectancy is the increased burden of chronic health conditions, 
many of which are exacerbated by the continued rise in obesity. In the US, the 
prevalence of obesity in adults aged 60 years and older increased from 23.6% to 
37% in 2010.
OBJECTIVES: This review examines bariatric surgery as a treatment option for 
obese adults > 60 years old. The most common types of weight-loss surgery are 
laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding, vertical sleeve gastrectomy, Roux-en-Y 
gastric bypass, and the duodenal switch.
METHODS: A comprehensive literature search found 349 articles that referred to 
bariatric surgery in older adults. Of these, 70 relevant articles on bariatric 
surgery for older adults were utilized for this article.
RESULTS: Weight-loss surgery procedures were found to be equally safe for both 
older adults and their younger counterparts. Pre-surgical psychological 
assessment is critical for positive outcomes for older adults. Benefits of 
bariatric surgery include a decrease in comorbidities, chronic disease risk, and 
medication use coupled with improved mobility and quality of life outcomes. Side 
effects include surgical failure, changes in psychological status, and increased 
physical and mental stress.
CONCLUSIONS: Bariatric surgery can offer patients an effective and long-lasting 
treatment for obesity and related diseases. There does not appear to be any one 
bariatric procedure that is recommended for older adults, so individual needs 
should be taken into consideration when exploring options. Costs range from 
US$17,000 for laparoscopic procedures to US$26,000 for open gastric surgeries. 
Estimated savings start accruing within 3 months of surgery making bariatric 
surgery a serious cost saving consideration.

Patients diagnosed with glioblastoma multiforme receiving stereotactic biopsy 
only either due to tumor localization or impaired clinical status face a 
devastating prognosis with very short survival times. One strategy to provide an 
initial cytoreductive and palliative therapy at the time of the stereotactic 
biopsy is interstitial irradiation through the pre-defined trajectory of the 
biopsy channel. We designed a novel treatment planning system and evaluated the 
treatment potential of a fixed-source and a stepping-source algorithm for 
interstitial radiosurgery on non-spherical glioblastoma in direct adjacency to 
risk structures. Using both setups, we show that radiation doses delivered to 
100% of the gross tumor volume shifts from sub-therapeutic (10-12 Gy) to 
sterilizing single doses (25-30 Gy) when using the stepping source algorithm due 
to improved sparing of organs-at-risk. Specifically, the maximum doses at the 
brain stem were 100% of the PTV dose when a fixed central source and 38% when a 
stepping-source algorithm was used. We also demonstrated precision of 
intracranial target points and stability of superficial and deep trajectories 
using both a phantom and a body donor study. Our setup now for the first time 
provides a basis for a clinical proof-of-concept trial and may widen palliation 
options for patients with limited life expectancy that should not undergo 
time-consuming therapies.

BACKGROUND: Ageing is the inevitable time-dependent decline in physiological 
organ function that eventually leads to death. Age is a major risk factor for 
many of the most common medical conditions, such as cardiovascular disease, 
cancer, diabetes and Alzheimer's disease. This study reviews currently known 
hallmarks of ageing and their clinical implications.
METHODS: A literature search of PubMed/MEDLINE was conducted covering the last 
decade.
RESULTS: Average life expectancy has increased dramatically over the past 
century and is estimated to increase even further. Maximum longevity, however, 
appears unchanged, suggesting a universal limitation to the human organism. 
Understanding the underlying molecular processes of ageing and health decline 
may suggest interventions that, if used at an early age, can prevent, delay, 
alleviate or even reverse age-related diseases. Hallmarks of ageing can be 
grouped into three main categories. The primary hallmarks cause damage to 
cellular functions: genomic instability, telomere attrition, epigenetic 
alterations and loss of proteostasis. These are followed by antagonistic 
responses to such damage: deregulated nutrient sensing, altered mitochondrial 
function and cellular senescence. Finally, integrative hallmarks are possible 
culprits of the clinical phenotype (stem cell exhaustion and altered 
intercellular communication), which ultimately contribute to the clinical 
effects of ageing as seen in physiological loss of reserve, organ decline and 
reduced function.
CONCLUSION: The sum of these molecular hallmarks produces the clinical picture 
of the elderly surgical patient: frailty, sarcopenia, anaemia, poor nutrition 
and a blunted immune response system. Improved understanding of the ageing 
processes may give rise to new biomarkers of risk or prognosis, novel treatment 
targets and translational approaches across disciplines that may improve 
outcomes.

Changing Paradigm of Hemophilia Management: Extended Half-Life Factor 
Concentrates and Gene Therapy.

Management of hemophilia has evolved significantly in the last century-from 
recognition of the causative mechanism in the 1950s to commercially available 
clotting factor concentrates in the 1960s. Availability of lyophilized 
concentrates in the 1970s set the stage for home-based therapy, followed by 
introduction of virally attenuated plasma-derived, and then recombinant factor 
concentrates in the 1980s and 1990s, respectively. The subsequent years saw a 
paradigm shift in treatment goals from on-demand therapy to prophylactic factor 
replacement starting at an early age, to prevent hemarthrosis becoming the 
standard of care for patients with severe hemophilia. In the developed world, 
the increasing use of home-based prophylactic regimens has significantly 
improved the quality of life, and life expectancy of patients with severe 
hemophilia. Seminal developments in the past 5 years, including the commercial 
availability of extended half-life factor concentrates and the publication of 
successful results of gene therapy for patients with hemophilia B, promise to 
further revolutionize hemophilia care over the next few decades. In this review, 
we summarize the evolution of management for hemophilia, with a focus on 
extended half-life factor concentrates and gene therapy.

OBJECTIVE: Arthritis and its associated joint pain act as significant barriers 
for adults attempting to perform land-based physical activity. Swimming can be 
an ideal form of exercise for patients with arthritis. Yet there is no 
information on the efficacy of regular swimming exercise involving patients with 
arthritis. The effect of a swimming exercise intervention on joint pain, 
stiffness, and physical function was evaluated in patients with osteoarthritis 
(OA).
METHODS: Using a randomized study design, 48 sedentary middle-aged and older 
adults with OA underwent 3 months of either swimming or cycling exercise 
training. Supervised exercise training was performed for 45 min/day, 3 days/week 
at 60-70% heart rate reserve for 12 weeks. The Western Ontario and McMaster 
Universities Arthritis Index was used to measure joint pain, stiffness, and 
physical limitation.
RESULTS: After the exercise interventions, there were significant reductions in 
joint pain, stiffness, and physical limitation accompanied by increases in 
quality of life in both groups (all p < 0.05). Functional capacity as assessed 
by maximal handgrip strength, isokinetic knee extension and flexion power 
(15-30% increases), and the distance covered in the 6-min walk test increased 
(all p < 0.05) in both exercise groups. No differences were observed in the 
magnitude of improvements between swimming and cycling training.
CONCLUSION: Regular swimming exercise reduced joint pain and stiffness 
associated with OA and improved muscle strength and functional capacity in 
middle-aged and older adults with OA. Additionally, the benefits of swimming 
exercise were similar to the more frequently prescribed land-based cycling 
training.

AIM: Pelvic exenteration is an aggressive operation for locally advanced rectal 
cancer. Social deprivation has been shown to reduce life expectancy and has been 
linked to a poorer outcome in patients with colorectal cancer. The aim of this 
study was to analyse the effect of social deprivation scores on the outcome in 
these complex patients.
METHOD: A retrospective review of all patients undergoing pelvic exenteration 
for primary rectal cancer between 2006 and 2014 was performed. Deprivation 
scores were calculated for all patients using the Welsh Index of Multiple 
Deprivation. Patients were then grouped into quartiles, from Q1 (most deprived) 
to Q4 (least deprived). The primary outcome measure was 5-year survival.
RESULTS: In all, 120 patients were included (65 female) with a median age of 64 
(31-90) years. No differences between quartiles were identified for neoadjuvant 
therapy (P = 0.687) or type of exenteration (P = 0.690). The median length of 
stay was significantly higher in the most deprived groups (Q1-Q2; P = 0.023). 
There was a significant difference in survival between the groups, with lowest 
5-year survival rates (53%) in the most deprived quartile (Q1) (P = 0.015).
CONCLUSION: Social deprivation is significantly associated with postoperative 
length of stay and survival in patients undergoing pelvic exenteration for 
primary rectal cancer.

Among the various myopathies, Duchenne muscular dystrophy represents the 
myopathy with the most stereotypical respiratory evolution. This progressive 
respiratory failure is going to develop in a parallel way of motor deficit, 
conducting patients to mechanical ventilation at the end of their second decade. 
In the absence of curative therapeutics, respiratory cares like home ventilation 
and prevention of respiratory complications, in a systematic and organized way, 
allowed to decrease the morbidity and the mortality of these patients. It is not 
exceptional to meet patients with life expectancy of which overtakes about 
forty. Besides axial stabilization, cough assistance techniques and swallowing 
disorders management need to be associated to mechanical ventilation. Invasive 
techniques of ventilation as tracheostomy keep their place in this pathology 
even if alternative techniques allowing full day non-invasive ventilation were 
generalized these last years.

Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is the most frequent hereditary neuromuscular 
disorder in childhood. Over the past 30 years, increasingly better standards of 
care have considerably improved the quality of life as well as the life 
expectancy of DMD patients. Despite such progress in disease management, DMD 
remains a devastating disorder with continuous decline of motor and cardiac 
function. Until recently, corticosteroids were the only treatment available to 
slow down, however modestly, disease progression. Importantly, novel innovative 
therapeutic approaches are currently being developed. This review discusses the 
rational and underlying molecular mechanism of these novel strategies as well as 
the progress made by recent clinical trials. Importantly, these new therapeutic 
advances bear the potential to profoundly modify the disease course of DMD.
