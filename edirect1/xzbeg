PURPOSE: The long-term results after using the iliotibial band autograft (ITB) 
in anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction are not fully known. If equal 
in quality to conventional methods, the ITB graft could be a useful alternative 
as a primary graft, in revision surgery or multi-ligament reconstruction. The 
purpose is to assess whether the ITB autograft is a long-term reliable 
alternative to the bone-patella-tendon-bone (BPTB) autograft, using a 
prospective randomized controlled trial design.
METHODS: From 1995 to 1996, sixty patients scheduled for primary ACL 
reconstruction were included in a prospective randomized controlled trial. Three 
senior knee surgeons, experienced in both types of ACL surgery, performed all 
the operations. A standardized and supervised rehabilitation programme was used 
for both groups for 6 months. Thirty patients received the ITB reconstruction, 
and 30 received the BPTB reconstruction. Forty-nine participated at follow-up in 
2010 (82%). Primary outcome was the failure rate after ACL reconstruction. 
Secondary outcomes were knee injury osteoarthritis outcome score (KOOS) [pain, 
symptoms, Sport/Rec, quality of life (QOL), daily living function], Tegner 
activity scale, anterior knee pain-score, Lysholm score, Rolimeter laxity, 
extension deficit, single hop and crossover hop for distance.
RESULTS: At 15-year follow-up, no significant difference existed between the 
groups. Graft failure occurred in 4 ITB subjects (16%) and 3 BPTB subjects 
(13%). KOOS (Sport/Rec) for the ITB group was 75 and 73 for the BPTB group. The 
KOOS (QOL) was 72 and 68 for the ITB group and BPTB group, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Similar graft failure rates and KOOS were found when comparing ITB- 
and BPTB-operated individuals, at 15-year follow-up. The ITB graft had equal 
long-term clinical results compared to the BPTB graft and is recommended as a 
reliable alternative autograft for ACL reconstruction.

Tafamidis, a transthyretin (TTR) kinetic stabilizer, delayed neuropathic 
progression in patients with Val30Met TTR familial amyloid polyneuropathy 
(TTR-FAP) in an 18-month randomized controlled trial (study Fx-005). This 
12-month, open-label extension study evaluated the long-term safety, 
tolerability, and efficacy of tafamidis 20 mg once daily in 86 patients who 
earlier received blinded treatment with tafamidis or placebo. Efficacy measures 
included the Neuropathy Impairment Score in the Lower Limbs (NIS-LL), Norfolk 
Quality of Life-Diabetic Neuropathy total quality of life (TQOL) score, and 
changes in neurologic function and nutritional status. We quantified the monthly 
rates of change in efficacy measures, and TTR stabilization, and monitored 
adverse events (AEs). Patients who continued on tafamidis had stable rates of 
change in NIS-LL (from 0.08 to 0.11/month; p = 0.60) and TQOL (from -0.03 to 
0.25; p = 0.16). In patients switched from placebo, the monthly rate of change 
in NIS-LL declined (from 0.34 to 0.16/month; p = 0.01), as did TQOL score (from 
0.61 to -0.16; p < 0.001). Patients treated with tafamidis for 30 months had 
55.9 % greater preservation of neurologic function as measured by the NIS-LL 
than patients in whom tafamidis was initiated later. Plasma TTR was stabilized 
in 94.1 % of patients treated with tafamidis for 30 months. AEs were similar 
between groups; no patients discontinued because of an AE. Long-term tafamidis 
was well tolerated, with the reduced rate of neurologic deterioration sustained 
over 30 months. Tafamidis also slowed neurologic impairment in patients 
previously given placebo, but treatment benefits were greater when tafamidis was 
begun earlier.

Comorbidities in psoriasis.

Aurangabadkar SJ(1).

Author information:

Moderate to severe psoriasis is associated with concomitant diseases that may 
have a significant impact on patients. It is necessary for the treating 
physician to recognize these concomitant diseases, known as comorbidities, early 
as they influence the management options. Important comorbidities are psoriatic 
arthritis, metabolic syndrome, Crohn's disease, depression, and cancer. Patients 
with severe psoriasis may be at an increased risk for myocardial infarction and 
this subgroup of patients tends to have a reduced life expectancy. The presence 
of co-morbid diseases is associated with an increase in concomitant medication, 
some of which may worsen psoriasis; conversely, systemic treatment of psoriasis 
with certain drugs may impact the co-morbid conditions. As dermatologists are 
the primary health-care providers for psoriasis, adequate knowledge of 
comorbidities helps in choosing the appropriate therapy as well as timely 
intervention.

Medicine, Bronx, New York 10467, USA. vtabatab@montefiore.org

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: As life expectancy increases and population age advances, 
diagnosis and treatment of diseases common in the geriatric population assume an 
increasingly important role in modern medicine. In the last few years, the 
emergence of age-specific reference ranges for thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) 
has added to the complexity of diagnosis of thyroid dysfunction in this age 
group, especially in the 'subclinical' category.
RECENT FINDINGS: The recent studies confirm an increase in population TSH 
distribution with age, both in cross-sectional and longitudinal studies. 
Conclusive evidence about adverse cardiovascular, metabolic, and cognitive 
consequences of subclinical hypothyroidism in the elderly remains elusive. The 
transient nature of subtle degrees of thyroid dysfunction in a significant 
proportion of elderly patients has also been reproduced in the recent 
publications.
SUMMARY: A growing body of literature in the last few years, reviewed here, 
highlights the importance of employing additional caution before assigning 
diagnoses of hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism to elderly patients and 
initiation of treatment modalities that can have long-lasting effects.

Perioperative management of delirium and dementia in the geriatric surgical 
patient.

Hamrick I(1), Meyer F.

Author information:
(1)Geriatric Services, Department of Family Medicine, University of Wisconsin, 
Madison, WI, USA.

BACKGROUND: Older adults undergo operations as our population ages. Increasing 
life expectancy and disease burden, along with decreased functional status and 
organ reserve, place the elderly surgical patient at higher general risk in the 
perioperative state. In particular, these patients have more diseases including 
dementia and medications that put them specifically at higher risk of delirium.
PURPOSE: This overview describes the diagnosis, pathophysiology, and treatment 
of delirium and its interface with depression and dementia, and explains aging 
changes based on the picture of perioperative management in surgical 
interventions.
CONCLUSIONS: Today, surgeons must be equipped to attend the geriatric patient's 
needs. Early recognition of comorbidities such as dementia and delirium as well 
as speedy and competent therapeutic treatment can limit consequences and impact.

    Clin Orthop Relat Res. 2014 Jan;472(1):368-9.

BACKGROUND: Hemiarthroplasty has been shown superior to internal fixation for 
displaced femoral neck fractures (FNF) in the first 2 years. However, there are 
unanswered questions about the performance of hemiarthroplasty over the longer 
term compared with internal fixation.
QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We sought to compare hemiarthroplasty with internal fixation 
in terms of (1) outcomes scores for pain, hip function, and quality of life at a 
minimum of 5 years after surgery in a randomized trial. A secondary purpose was 
to compare (2) patient survival and (3) frequency of reoperation in the two 
groups.
METHODS: A total of 222 consecutive patients older than 60 years, including 
those cognitively impaired, with FNF were randomized to either internal fixation 
with two parallel screws or bipolar hemiarthroplasty. At a minimum followup of 
4.9 years (mean, 5.9 years; range, 4.9-7.2 years), 68 of the 70 surviving 
patients were examined by a study nurse and study physiotherapist blinded to 
initial treatment. Questionnaires on hip function (Harris hip score), quality of 
life (Eq5D), and activity of daily living function (Barthel ADL) were 
administered. The Barthel ADL index score was split into good function (score 95 
or 100) and reduced function (score below 95).
RESULTS: The mean survival of the groups was similar with 66.4% (73 of 110) of 
the patients undergoing hemiarthroplasty and 70.5% (79 of 112) of the patients 
undergoing internal fixation having died since surgery (p = 0.51). Only 12 of 31 
living patients in the internal fixation group had retained their native hips at 
a mean of 6 years. Between 2 and 6 years, there were two new major reoperations 
(both in the internal fixation group, for avascular necrosis and deep wound 
infection). The mean Harris hip score was 66 (SD 19) and 67 (SD 20) in the 
internal fixation and hemiarthroplasty groups, respectively (p = 0.96). The mean 
Eq5D index was 0.50 (SD 0.40) in the internal fixation group and 0.34 (SD 0.36) 
in the hemiarthroplasty group (p = 0.10). Function in terms of ADLs was 
comparable between the groups; of the patients in the internal fixation group, 
42% reported good function on the Barthel ADL index, and the corresponding 
number in the hemiarthroplasty group was 51% (p = 0.44).
CONCLUSIONS: Hemiarthroplasty has predictable and good long-term results after 
FNF and is the treatment of choice compared with internal fixation. Further 
studies will evaluate if total hip arthroplasty has advantages over 
hemiarthroplasty in patients with fracture with long life expectancy.

Is a diabetes pay-for-performance program cost-effective under the National 
Health Insurance in Taiwan?

Tan EC(1), Pwu RF, Chen DR, Yang MC.

Author information:
(1)Institute of Health Policy and Management, College of Public Health, National 
Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.

PURPOSE: In October 2001, a pay-for-performance (P4P) program for diabetes was 
implemented by the National Health Insurance (NHI), a single-payer program, in 
Taiwan. However, only limited information is available regarding the influence 
of this program on the patient's health-related quality of life. The aim of this 
study was to estimate the costs and consequences of enrolling patients in the 
P4P program from a single-payer perspective.
METHODS: A retrospective observational study of 529 diabetic patients was 
conducted between 2004 and 2005. The data used in the study were obtained from 
the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) in Taiwan. Direct cost data were 
obtained from NHI claims data, which were linked to respondents in the NHIS 
using scrambled individual identification. The generic SF36 health instrument 
was employed to measure the quality-of-life-related health status and 
transformed into a utility index. Patients enrolled in the P4P program for at 
least 3 months were categorized as the P4P group. Following propensity score 
matching, 260 patients were included in the study. Outcomes included life-years, 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), diabetes-related medical costs, overall 
medical costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). A single-payer 
perspective was assumed, and costs were expressed in US dollars. Nonparametric 
bootstrapping was conducted to estimate confidence intervals for 
cost-effectiveness ratios.
RESULTS: Following matching, no significant difference was noted between two 
groups with regard to the patients' age, gender, education, family income, 
smoking status, BMI, or whether insulin was used. The P4P group had an increase 
of 0.08 (95 % CI 0.077-0.080) in QALYs, and the additional diabetes-related 
medical cost was US$422.74 (95 % CI US$413.58-US$435.05), yielding an ICER of 
US$5413.93 (95 % CI US$5226.83-US$5562.97) per QALY gained.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results provides decision makers with valuable information 
regarding the impact of the P4P program of diabetes care through a direct 
comparison of equivalent groups of patients receiving regular care. Under the 
single-payer NHI system, the use of financial incentives under the DM-P4P 
program may be an effective means to ensure the quality of follow-up treatment.

How and when to refer a child for specialist paediatric palliative care.

Harrop E(1), Edwards C.

Author information:
(1)Paediatric Palliative Care, Helen & Douglas House Hospices, , Oxford, UK.

Specialist paediatric palliative care is a relatively new area of paediatrics, 
and the interface with other disciplines can occasionally pose challenges for 
referrers due to lack of information about the diverse services available. 
Although services vary on a regional basis, there are common principles which 
may be used to guide and support referrals. Children may be referred to 
palliative care services via a number of routes from community-based primary 
care to regional tertiary centres. Identifying those most likely to benefit from 
the finite resources available can be a challenge, and healthcare professional's 
negative attitudes to palliative care have been further identified as a 
potentially modifiable barrier. This article aims to clarify the role of 
specialist paediatric palliative care, identify who should be eligible for such 
care, describe the services available (including those from children's hospices) 
and provide a tool for assessing some of the most challenging referrals. Many of 
the documents referenced can be downloaded from the Together for Short Lives 
website, and in many cases, there is no charge.

BACKGROUND: Although terminal cancer is a widely used term, its meaning varies, 
which may lead to different attitudes toward end-of-life issues. The study was 
conducted to investigate differences in the understanding of terminal cancer and 
determine the relationship between this understanding and attitudes toward 
end-of-life issues.
METHODS: A questionnaire survey was performed between 2008 and 2009. A total of 
1242 cancer patients, 1289 family caregivers, 303 oncologists from 17 hospitals, 
and 1006 participants from the general population responded.
RESULTS: A "6-month life expectancy" was the most common understanding of 
terminal cancer (45.6%), followed by "treatment refractoriness" (21.1%), 
"metastatic/recurrent disease" (19.4%), "survival of a few days/weeks" (11.4%), 
and "locally advanced disease" (2.5%). The combined proportion of "treatment 
refractoriness" and "6-month life expectancy" differed significantly between 
oncologists and the other groups combined (76.0% v. 65.9%, P = 0.0003). 
Multivariate analyses showed that patients and caregivers who understood 
terminal cancer as "survival of a few days/weeks" showed more negative attitudes 
toward disclosure of terminal status compared with participants who chose 
"treatment refractoriness" (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.42, 95% confidence 
interval [CI] 0.22-0.79 for patients; aOR 0.34, 95% CI 0.18-0.63 for 
caregivers). Caregivers who understood terminal cancer as "locally advanced" or 
"metastatic/recurrent disease" showed a significantly lower percentage of 
agreement with withdrawal of futile life-sustaining treatment compared with 
those who chose "treatment refractoriness" (aOR 0.19, 95% CI 0.07-0.54 for 
locally advanced; aOR 0.39, 95% CI 0.21-0.72 for metastatic/recurrent).
CONCLUSIONS: The understanding of terminal cancer varied among the 4 participant 
groups. It was associated with different preferences regarding end-of-life 
issues. Standardization of these terms is needed to better understand 
end-of-life care.

Cost effectiveness of moderate to severe psoriasis therapy with etanercept and 
ustekinumab in the United States.

BACKGROUND: Limited information is available on the cost effectiveness of 
ustekinumab and alternative biologic treatments in a United States (US) setting. 
Given the recent head-to-head clinical trial study of ustekinumab and 
etanercept, an economic model comparing the two treatments can be constructed. 
Etanercept and ustekinumab are indicated for the treatment of chronic moderate 
to severe plaque psoriasis in adult patients who are candidates for phototherapy 
or systemic therapy.
OBJECTIVE: Clinical trials have evaluated the efficacy of ustekinumab, an 
anti-cytokine biologic, for the treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis. This 
study evaluated the cost effectiveness of ustekinumab compared with etanercept 
from a US societal perspective.
METHODS: A Markov model was constructed to simulate the incremental cost per 
quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained every 12 weeks over a base-case 3-year 
time horizon. A hypothetical patient cohort was based on the characteristics of 
the phase III Active Comparator Psoriasis Trial (ACCEPT). The main outcome 
measures were costs and QALYs, which were estimated from the US societal 
perspective. Costs, utilities, treatment strategy, and resource use estimates 
were obtained from relevant literature. All costs were adjusted to 2011 US 
dollars. A 3 % annual discount rate was applied to costs and QALYs. Incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios were in US dollars per QALY gained.
RESULTS: For the base-case 3-year time horizon, the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio comparing ustekinumab 90 mg with etanercept 50 mg was 
US$384,401 per QALY gained. Ustekinumab 45 mg dominates etanercept 50 mg for the 
same time horizon. These results were robust to sensitivity analyses involving 
treatment strategy, transition probabilities, valuing outcomes, and resource use 
and costs. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis suggests ustekinumab 90 mg has 
a minimal (4 %) chance of being cost effective compared with etanercept 50 mg at 
a willingness-to-pay threshold of US$150,000 per QALY improvement. For the same 
threshold, ustekinumab 45 mg has a high (88 %) chance of being cost effective 
compared with etanercept 50 mg.
CONCLUSION: Under typical US willingness-to-pay cutoffs, ustekinumab 90 mg is 
not cost effective compared with etanercept 50 mg therapy in moderate to severe 
psoriasis patients for the base-case 3-year time horizon. Ustekinumab 45 mg 
dominates etanercept 50 mg therapy for an equivalent patient psoriasis severity 
and time horizon.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune chronic disease which is associated 
with an increasing disability in patients and high socioeconomic burden. Given 
the large number of economic evaluations considered by national health 
technology assessments (HTAs), this review attempts to clarify whether results 
from biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) economic 
evaluations form the basis of official recommendation by national HTA agencies 
in Australia, Canada, Scotland and England. The results show that evidence of 
cost-effectiveness was not equally perceived by decision makers and did not have 
equal weightage in defining the official listing of biologic DMARDs for the 
treatment of RA. As it has been demonstrated in previous studies, major barriers 
exist for the integration of cost-effectiveness and cost-utility results with 
national HTA activity. In fact, as shown in this review, even when such analysis 
are available, cost-minimization and comparative effectiveness studies seemed to 
be preferred by some HTA agencies as tools to inform allocation of healthcare 
resources.

There has been substantial debate on the need for decreasing discounting for 
monetary and health gains in economic evaluations. Next to the discussion on 
differential discounting, a way to identify the need for such discounting 
strategies is through eliciting the time preferences for monetary and health 
outcomes. In this article, the authors investigate the perceived time preference 
for money and health gains through a pilot survey on Dutch university students 
using methods on functional forms previously suggested. Formal objectives of the 
study were to review such existing methods and to pilot them on a convenience 
sample using a questionnaire designed for this specific purpose. Indeed, a 
negative relation between the time of delay and the variance of the discounting 
rate for all models was observed. This study was intended as a pilot for a 
large-scale population-based investigation using the findings from this pilot on 
wording of the questionnaire, interpretation, scope and analytic framework.

analysis.

Columbia, Vancouver, Canada. Electronic address: nadia.zalunardo@vch.ca.

BACKGROUND: The optimal time for arteriovenous fistula (AVF) referral is 
uncertain. Improving the timeliness of referral may reduce central venous 
catheter (CVC) use.
STUDY DESIGN: Monte Carlo simulation model.
SETTING & POPULATION: Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) followed up in 
a multidisciplinary clinic, overall and stratified by age.
MODEL, PERSPECTIVE, & TIMEFRAME: Decision analysis, patient, patient's lifetime.
INTERVENTION: AVF referral, using 1 of 2 strategies: refer when hemodialysis is 
anticipated to begin within a certain time frame or refer when estimated 
glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) drops below a certain threshold.
OUTCOMES: A range of values for each strategy are compared to each other with 
respect to incident vascular access type (AVF or CVC), percentage of patients 
with an unnecessary AVF creation, and life expectancy after dialysis therapy 
initiation.
RESULTS: A 15-month referral time frame gave 34% with incident CVCs, 14% with 
unnecessary AVFs, and a life expectancy of 1,751 days. Time frames of 12-18 
months performed similarly. Referral at eGFR of 20 mL/min/1.73 m(2) gave 38% 
with incident CVCs, 20% with unnecessary AVFs, and life expectancy of 1,742 
days. Using an eGFR threshold of 15 mL/min/1.73 m(2), 10% had an unnecessary 
AVF. Policy performance was affected by CKD progression rate and age. For fast 
progressors (ΔeGFR = -7mL/min/1.73 m(2) per year), referral at eGFR of 25 
mL/min/1.73 m(2) achieved a similar incident CVC percentage (~40%) as referral 
at 15 mL/min/1.73 m(2) in slower progressors (ΔeGFR = -2.78 mL/min/1.73 m(2) per 
year). For patients aged 70-80 and 80-90 years, time frames of 15-18 months 
yielded 16%-22% with unnecessary AVFs (vs 9%-11% in 50- to 60-year-olds); an 
eGFR threshold strategy of 20 mL/min/1.73 m(2) yielded 24% unnecessary AVFs in 
80- to 90-year-olds versus 16% in 50- to 60-year-olds.
LIMITATIONS: Our model does not consider patients with nonlinear CKD progression 
or acute kidney injury. We did not include arteriovenous grafts or consider cost 
or quality of life.
CONCLUSIONS: In general, AVF referral within about 12 months of the estimated 
time to dialysis performed best among time frame strategies, and referral at 
eGFR < 15-20 mL/min/1.73 m(2) performed best among threshold strategies. The 
timing of referral should also be guided by the individual rate of CKD 
progression. Elderly patients with CKD could be referred later to reduce the 
risk of creating an AVF that is never used.

Years of life lost in the first wave of the 2009 influenza A(H1N1) pandemic in 
Hong Kong.

Zhou Y, Lau EH, Ip DK, Nishiura H, Leung GM, Seto WH, Cowling BJ.

The impact of influenza pandemics might be overestimated; the published studies 
of years of life lost (YLL) have typically ignored the presence of underlying 
chronic conditions or health risk behaviors in most deaths. We used data on 
deaths involving laboratory-confirmed 2009 influenza A(H1N1) virus infection 
that occurred between April 2009 and May 2010 in Hong Kong, China, to adjust for 
these underlying risk factors. Life expectancy was corrected with hazard-based 
modifications to the life tables. The excess hazards posed by underlying risk 
factors were added to the "baseline" age-specific hazards in the local life 
tables to reflect the life expectancy associated with each underlying risk 
factor. Of 72 deceased persons with laboratory-confirmed 2009 influenza A(H1N1) 
virus infection, 56% had underlying risk factors. We estimated that the 2009 
pandemic was associated with 1,540 (95% confidence interval: 1,350, 1,630) YLL 
after adjustment for age and underlying risk factors. This figure is 
approximately 25% lower than the YLL estimate of 2,080 derived after adjustment 
for age but not for risk factors. Our analysis demonstrates the potential scale 
of bias in YLL estimation if underlying risk factors are ignored. The estimation 
of YLL with correction for underlying risk factors in addition to age could also 
provide a framework for similar calculations elsewhere.

Posterior vertebral column resection in early onset spinal deformities.

PURPOSE: Early onset spinal deformities (EOSD) can be life-threatening in very 
young children. In the growing spine, surgical intervention is often unavoidable 
and should be carried out as soon as possible. A deformed section of the spine 
not only affects the development of the remaining healthy spine, but also that 
of the chest wall (which influences pulmonary function), the extremities and 
body balance. Posterior vertebral column resection (PVCR) represents an 
effective surgical solution to address such problems. However, reports in the 
literature concerning PVCR are mostly limited to its use in adolescents or 
adults. The purpose of this study was to illustrate our experience with PVCR in 
EOSD and to describe the surgical technique with respect to the unique anatomy 
of young children.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four children [mean age 3.7 (range 2.5-5.2) years] with 
severe spinal deformity underwent PVCR through a single approach. Multimodal 
intraoperative monitoring was used in all cases. Surgery included one stage 
posterior circumferential resection of one vertebral body along with the 
adjoining intervertebral discs and removal of all posterior elements. A 
transpedicular screw-rod system was used for correction and stabilisation. 
Fusion was strictly limited to the resection site, allowing for later conversion 
into a growing rod construct at the remaining spine, if necessary. Relevant data 
were extracted retrospectively from patient charts and long spine radiographs.
RESULTS: The mean operation time was 500 (range 463-541) min, with an estimated 
blood loss of 762 (range 600-1,050) ml. Mean follow-up time was 6.3 (range 
3.5-12.4) years. After PVCR, the mean Cobb angle for scoliosis was reduced from 
69° (range 50-99°) to 29° (5-44°) and the sagittal curvature (kyphosis) from 
126° (87-151°) to 61° (47-75°). The mean correction of scoliosis was 57 % 
(18-92°) and of kyphosis, 51 % (44-62°). There were no spinal cord-related 
complications. In three patients, spinal instrumentation for growth guidance 
(fusion less growing rod technique) was applied. Two patients had complications: 
one patient had a complication of anesthesia, halo pin failure, and revision 
surgery with extension of the instrumentation cranially due to loss of 
correction; the second patient had a postoperative infection, which required 
plastic reconstructive measures.
CONCLUSION: PVCR appears to be an effective technique to treat severe EOSD. 
There are important differences in its use in young children when compared with 
older patients. In patients with EOSD, additional surgical procedures are often 
necessary during growth, and hence non-fusion instrumentation beyond the 
vertebral resection site is advantageous, as it permits spinal growth and the 
later addition of fusion.

Opportunity costs associated with caring for older Mexican-Americans.

TX, USA, Henry.S.Brown@uth.tmc.edu.

Long-term care use among older Mexican-Americans is poorly understood, despite 
the adverse effects on health and economic disadvantage in this vulnerable 
population. This study examines gender-based risk of long-term care use in 628 
women and 391 men, age 70 and over in the 2000-2001 and 2004-2005 waves of the 
Hispanic Established Populations for Epidemiologic Studies of the Elderly. 
Logistic regression models are employed to assess the impact of the opportunity 
cost implications of family support (kin availability and co-residence) relative 
to health care needs (quality-adjusted life years (QALY) weighted scores and 
functional limitations) on women's risk of entry into a nursing home. A small 
percentage (~5%) of men and women had entered a long-term care facility. Women 
had lower weights for QALY weights and greater disability than men, but on 
average were more likely to live with or in closer proximity to an adult child. 
Higher disability rates (p < 0.01) increased the risk of institutionalization 
regardless of gender because disability increases time burdens. Families with 
fewer adult children faced higher time burdens per child in caring for elderly 
parents; particularly for elderly mothers. Demographic trends suggest that the 
number of adult children available to share the caregiving load may decrease 
long-term care use.

OBJECTIVE: The benefit of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) over medical therapy in 
patients with asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis is predicated upon a life 
expectancy of at least 5 years after the procedure. The goal of this study was 
to create a scoring system for prediction of 5-year survival after CEA that can 
be used to triage patients with ACAS.
METHODS: All patients who underwent CEA for severe asymptomatic carotid stenosis 
from 1989 to 2005 were identified. Long-term survival was determined by a review 
of hospital records and the social security death index. Because all patients 
had at least 5-year follow-up, a logistic regression of predictors of survival 
at 5 years was performed and the odds ratios associated with particular 
significant comorbidities were used to create a scoring system to predict 
survival. The scoring system was then validated within the cohort using the 
Hosmer-Lemeshow Test and a derivation/validation receiver operating 
characteristic (ROC) curve.
RESULTS: There were 2004 CEA performed in 1791 patients. The average follow-up 
was 130 ± 49 months. The clinical profile of the cohort data included 84% 
hypertension, 56% coronary artery disease (CAD), 24% diabetes, and 71% on 
statins. The 30-day stroke rate was 1.1% and the death rate was 0.7%. The actual 
5-year survival was 73%. Logistic regression yielded the following predictors of 
mortality: age (by decade) (odds ratio [OR] = 1.8, P < 0.0001), CAD (OR = 1.5, P 
= 0.0007), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (OR = 2.5; P < 0.0001), 
diabetes (OR = 1.7, P < 0.0001), neck radiation (OR = 2.6, P = 0.005), no statin 
(OR = 2.1, P < 0.0001), and creatinine more than 1.5 (OR = 2.6, P < 0.0001). 
These variables were then assigned a hierarchal point scoring system in 
accordance with the OR value. The 5-year survival based on the scoring system 
was as follows: 0 to 5 points = 92.5%, 6 to 8 points = 83.6%, 9 to 11 points = 
63.7%, 12 to 14 points = 46.5%, and more than 15 points = 33.8%. The 
Hosmer-Lemeshow test validated the scoring system (P = 0.26) and there was no 
difference in the ROC curves (C statistic = 0.74 vs 0.73).
CONCLUSIONS: This validated scoring system can be a useful tool for determining 
which patients are likely to benefit most from CEA based on the probability of 
long-term survival. Given that the 5-year survival of patients in the medical 
arm of the asymptomatic CEA trials was 60% to 70%, it is reasonable to conclude 
that patients who score 0 to 8 points are excellent candidates for CEA whereas 
most patients with ≥12 points should be managed with medical therapy alone.

The road not taken: transferability issues in multinational trials.

BACKGROUND: National regulatory agencies often have to use cost-effectiveness 
(CE) data from multinational randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for national 
decision making on reimbursement of new drugs. We need to make the best use of 
these patient-level data to obtain estimates of country-specific CE. Several 
methods, ranging from simple to statistically complex, have existed for years. 
We investigated which of these methods are used to estimate CE ratios in 
economic evaluations performed alongside recent, multinational RCTs that 
enrolled at least 500 patients.
METHODS: In this systematic literature review, studies were classified based on 
whether resource use, unit costs, health outcomes and utility value sets were 
obtained from all countries, a subset of countries or one country. We recorded 
if the study presented trial-wide and country-specific CE results and reported 
the statistical analyses that were used to estimate them.
RESULTS: We included 21 studies, of which the majority used measurements of 
health care utilization and health outcomes from all countries to estimate CE. 
Thirteen studies used a one-country valuation of health care utilization; six 
used a multi-country valuation. Despite the availability of country-specific 
utility value sets, none of the studies that presented quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs) used multi-country valuation. Valuation of health care 
utilization and health outcomes was not always consistent within a study: three 
studies combined a multi-country valuation of health care utilization, with a 
one-country valuation of health outcomes. Most studies calculated trial-wide CE 
estimates, while 11 studies calculated country- or region-specific estimates. 
Thirteen studies used relatively simple methods, which do not take the possible 
interaction between the country and treatment effect on health care utilization 
and health outcomes into account. Eight studies used more advanced statistical 
methods. Three of them used a fixed-effects modeling approach. Five studies 
explicitly took the hierarchical structure of the data into account, which leads 
to more appropriate estimates of population average results and associated 
standard errors. In this way, they help improve transferability of the published 
results.
CONCLUSION: Based on this systematic review, we concluded that the uptake of 
more advanced statistical methods has been relatively slow, while simpler naïve 
methods are still routinely employed.

BACKGROUND: Patient self reported measures for Health Related Quality of Life 
(HRQOL) and mental distress are frequently used to evaluate outcome of 
therapeutic strategies in cardiac patients.Our study aims to describe changes in 
HRQOL and mental distress after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) 
focusing on temporal pattern of change and interdependences between both outcome 
measures.
METHOD: 163 PCI patients recruited at 7 cardiovascular care units in Austria 
answered MacNew Health Related Quality of Life and Hospital Anxiety and 
Depression Scale (HADS) questionnaires during hospital stay after intervention 
and at 1, 6, 12 and 24 months.
RESULTS: Improvement of MacNew HRQOL was found up to 6 month after PCI. Mental 
distress declined during the first month of the follow-up period. MacNew HRQOL 
is negatively correlated to mental distress. The relationship could be well 
described by a linear regression with MacNew HRQOL as dependent and HADS Total 
score as independent variable. The explained variance (R2) of the regression 
equation increases drastically from 45% at the baseline to a level between 67% 
and 77% in the follow up.
CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that the regression equation describing the 
relation between MacNew HRQOL and HADS-Total score six month after PCI defines a 
state of equilibrium: In absence of actual symptoms of coronary artery disease 
(CAD) both measures reflect the general health status and the general attitude 
underlying the self-assessment of health. At the baseline this equilibrium is 
imbalanced because the symptoms of CAD have a more pronounced impact on the 
disease specific MacNew HRQOL measure than on the non-disease specific HADS 
measure for mental distress. In order to use the MacNew questionnaire as a 
monitoring and/or prognostic tool it seems promising to refer to the state of 
equilibrium to define expectancy values for successful treatment.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of 
nurse-led care (NLC) for people with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
METHODS: In a multicentre pragmatic randomised controlled trial, the assessment 
of clinical effects followed a non-inferiority design, while patient 
satisfaction and cost assessments followed a superiority design. Participants 
were 181 adults with RA randomly assigned to either NLC or rheumatologist-led 
care (RLC), both arms carrying out their normal practice. The primary outcome 
was the disease activity score (DAS28) assessed at baseline, weeks 13, 26, 39 
and 52; the non-inferiority margin being DAS28 change of 0.6. Mean differences 
between the groups were estimated controlling for covariates following 
per-protocol (PP) and intention-to-treat (ITT) strategies. The economic 
evaluation (NHS and healthcare perspectives) estimated cost relative to change 
in DAS28 and quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) derived from EQ5D.
RESULTS: Demographics and baseline characteristics of patients under NLC (n=91) 
were comparable to those under RLC (n=90). Overall baseline-adjusted difference 
in DAS28 mean change (95% CI) for RLC minus NLC was -0.31 (-0.63 to 0.02) for PP 
and -0.15 (-0.45 to 0.14) for ITT analyses. Mean difference in healthcare cost 
(RLC minus NLC) was £710 (-£352, £1773) and -£128 (-£1263, £1006) for PP and ITT 
analyses, respectively. NLC was more cost-effective with respect to cost and 
DAS28, but not in relation to QALY utility scores. In all secondary outcomes, 
significance was met for non-inferiority of NLC. NLC had higher 'general 
satisfaction' scores than RLC in week 26.
CONCLUSIONS: The results provide robust evidence to support non-inferiority of 
NLC in the management of RA.

Playfulness over the lifespan and its relation to happiness: results from an 
online survey.

of Zurich, Binzmühlestr. 14/7, 8050, Zurich, Switzerland, 
r.proyer@psychologie.uzh.ch.

BACKGROUND: Playfulness is an understudied topic in adults and particularly 
among the elderly. There is no large study to date on age-related changes in 
playfulness across the lifespan, nor have relations with different indicators of 
well-being been investigated in much detail as yet.
PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: In total, 4100 adults completed online self-ratings on 
their playfulness, happiness and Seligman's three orientations to happiness (a 
pleasurable, engaged and meaningfully fulfilled life).
RESULTS: In a cross-sectional design, playfulness was stable across the 
lifespan; variations in the mean scores were relatively small (half a standard 
deviation). Yet participants <40 years yielded the comparatively lowest scores. 
There were no gender differences. Playfulness was best predicted by the scale 
assessing a pleasurable life and was positively related to happiness.
CONCLUSION: Playfulness seems to be of relevance in all age groups and displays 
robust relations with different indicators of well-being.

Ageing and Health (Stroke Research Group) (C.P., H.R., G.A.F.), Newcastle 
University, Newcastle Upon Tyne, United Kingdom.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Prehospital redirection of stroke patients to a regional 
center is used as a strategy to maximize the provision of intravenous 
thrombolysis. We developed a model to quantify the benefit of redirection away 
from local services that were already providing thrombolysis.
