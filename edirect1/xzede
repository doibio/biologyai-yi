a fully centralized BMS structure. Another research contribution made in this 
work is the development of a methodical modeling procedure based on Petri Nets, 
which establishes, in a visible, organized, and precise way, the set of 
conditions that will determine the operation of the BMS. If this modeling is not 
carried out, the threshold values and their conditions remain scattered, not 
very transparent, and difficult to deal with in an aggregate way.

It is considered that 1 in 10 adults worldwide have diabetes. Diabetic foot 
ulcers are some of the most common complications of diabetes, and they are 
associated with a high risk of lower-limb amputation and, as a result, reduced 
life expectancy. Timely detection and periodic ulcer monitoring can considerably 
decrease amputation rates. Recent research has demonstrated that computer vision 
can be used to identify foot ulcers and perform non-contact telemetry by using 
ulcer and tissue area segmentation. However, the applications are limited to 
controlled lighting conditions, and expert knowledge is required for dataset 
annotation. This paper reviews the latest publications on the use of artificial 
intelligence for ulcer area detection and segmentation. The PRISMA methodology 
was used to search for and select articles, and the selected articles were 
reviewed to collect quantitative and qualitative data. Qualitative data were 
used to describe the methodologies used in individual studies, while 
quantitative data were used for generalization in terms of dataset preparation 
and feature extraction. Publicly available datasets were accounted for, and 
methods for preprocessing, augmentation, and feature extraction were evaluated. 
It was concluded that public datasets can be used to form a bigger, more diverse 
datasets, and the prospects of wider image preprocessing and the adoption of 
augmentation require further research.

Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is one of the most common leukemias occurring in 
the adult population. The course of CML is divided into three phases: the 
chronic phase, the acceleration phase, and the blast phase. Pathophysiology of 
CML revolves around Philadelphia chromosome that constitutively activate 
tyrosine kinase through BCR-ABL1 oncoprotein. In the era of tyrosine kinase 
inhibitors (TKIs), CML patients now have a similar life expectancy to people 
without CML, and it is now very rare for CML patients to progress to the blast 
phase. Only a small proportion of CML patients have resistance to TKI, caused by 
BCR-ABL1 point mutations. CML patients with TKI resistance should be treated 
with second or third generation TKI, depending on the BCR-ABL1 mutation. 
Recently, many studies have shown that it is possible for CML patients who 
achieve a long-term deep molecular response to stop TKIs treatment and maintain 
remission. This review aimed to provide an overview of CML, including its 
pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, the role of stem cells, CML 
treatments, and treatment-free remission.

The coexistence of several chronic diseases is very common in older adults, 
making it crucial to understand multimorbidity (MM) patterns and associated 
mortality. We aimed to determine the prevalence of MM and common chronic disease 
combinations, as well as their impact on mortality in men and women aged 
65 years and older using the population-based KORA-Age study, based in South of 
Germany. The chronic disease status of the participants was determined in 
2008/9, and mortality status was followed up until 2016. MM was defined as 
having at least two chronic diseases. We used Cox proportional hazard models to 
calculate the hazard ratios (HRs) and the 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for 
associations between MM and all-cause mortality. During the study period 495 men 
(24.6%) and 368 women (17.4%) died. Although the MM prevalence was almost the 
same in men (57.7%) and women (60.0%), the overall effect of MM on mortality was 
higher in men (HR: 1.81, 95% CI: 1.47-2.24) than in women (HR: 1.28, 95% CI: 
1.01-1.64; p-value for interaction <0.001). The type of disease included in the 
MM patterns had a significant impact on mortality risk. For example, when both 
heart disease and diabetes were included in the combinations of two and three 
diseases, the mortality risk was highest. The risk of premature death does not 
only depend on the number of diseases but also on the specific disease 
combinations. In this study, life expectancy depended strongly on a few 
diseases, such as diabetes, hypertension, and heart disease.

BACKGROUND: This study obtained data on patients with cutaneous malignant 
melanoma (CMM) from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) 
database, and used a deep learning and neural network (DeepSurv) model to 
predict the survival rate of patients with CMM and evaluate its effectiveness.
METHODS: We collected information on patients with CMM between 2004 and 2015 
from the SEER database. We then randomly divided the patients into training and 
testing cohorts at a 7:3 ratio. The likelihood that patients with CMM will 
survive was forecasted using the DeepSurv model, and its results were compared 
with those of the Cox proportional-hazards (CoxPH) model. The calibration 
curves, time-dependent area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 
(AUC), and concordance index (C-index) were used to assess the prediction 
abilities of the model.
RESULTS: This study comprised 37,758 patients with CMM: 26,430 in the training 
cohort and 11,329 in the testing cohort. The CoxPH model demonstrated that the 
survival of patients with CMM was significantly influenced by age, sex, marital 
status, summary stage, surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, postoperative lymph 
node dissection, tumor size, and tumor extension. The C-index of the CoxPH model 
was 0.875. We also constructed the DeepSurv model using the data from the 
training cohort, and its C-index was 0.910. We examined how well the 
aforementioned two models predicted outcomes. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year AUCs were 
0.928, 0.837, and 0.855, respectively, for the CoxPH model, and 0.971, 0.947, 
and 0.942 for the DeepSurv model. The DeepSurv model presented a greater 
predictive effect on patients with CMM, and its reliability was better than that 
of the CoxPH model according to both the AUC value and the calibration curve.
CONCLUSION: The DeepSurv model, which we developed based on the data of patients 
with CMM in the SEER database, was found to be more effective than the CoxPH 
model in predicting the survival time of patients with CMM.

Placement of a Subclavian Tunneled Hemodialysis Catheter with the Patient's Arm 
Raised May Reduce the Risk of Complications: Two Cases Report.

Yoo J, Shim DJ, Kim D, Baek SH, Park CS, Lee JW.

The subclavian vein is an uncommon route for tunneled hemodialysis catheter 
(tHDC) placement because of its potency for future dialysis access. However, 
when favored access routes have been exhausted because of repeated 
catheterization or limited life expectancy, the subclavian vein can be used for 
urgent hemodialysis. A subclavian catheterization has a technical problem. The 
subclavian vein often forms a right angle with the vena cava, and advancing 
stiff peel-away sheath can cause a vascular injury. However, raising the 
patient's arm can alter the position of the guidewire and, therefore, change the 
angle of the vein favorable for tHDC placement. Herein, we report two patients 
who underwent subclavian catheterization; one experienced an injury to the 
superior vena cava after undergoing the conventional procedure, whereas the 
other patient with raised arm during the catheterization procedure had safe 
catheter placement.

Studies on detailed types of health changes and the associations between the 
types and income inequality are inadequate. This study analyses the global 
distribution of the compression and expansion of morbidity in 194 countries and 
territories between 1990 and 2016, and investigates the role of income 
inequality in the distribution. This study shows that all seven types of health 
changes coexist, despite being distributed unevenly. The relative expansion of 
morbidity with increased or constant life expectancy (Type 6, 54.48%) is the 
most popular type, followed by the relative compression of morbidity with 
increased or constant life expectancy (Type 3, 30.71%). Income distribution 
within a society matters for health changes. Societies with greater income 
inequality tend to have Type 6, a worse scenario of health changes. Measures to 
reduce income inequality or mitigate its adverse effects will contribute to the 
relative compression of morbidity with increased or constant life expectancy.

BACKGROUND: Leadless pacemakers were developed to reduce complications 
associated with transvenous pacemaker implantation and long-term follow-up. 
Existing international guidelines lack detailed instructions on patients 
suitable for leadless pacemaker implantation. Our aim was to develop a consensus 
document that provides medical guidance for all health professionals involved in 
the indication and implantation of Transcatheter Pacing System single-chamber 
device (VR leadless) pacemakers for patients with atrial fibrillation or in 
sinus rhythm.
METHODS: A panel of experts, including interventional and non-interventional 
cardiologists, used the Research ANd Development/University of California at Los 
Angeles (RAND/UCLA) method to rate the appropriateness of leadless pacemaker 
implantation for 64 scenarios in patients with atrial fibrillation and 192 
scenarios in sinus rhythm. The scenarios were rated individually and again 
during a moderated group session. Median ratings and level of agreement were 
calculated to classify each scenario as appropriate, inappropriate, or 
questionable.
RESULTS: This consensus statement, based on available literature and the 
experts' opinions, summarizes recommendations for standardizing and optimizing 
leadless pacemaker implantation. The limitation for vascular access via the 
superior vena cava was the most influential variable when indicating leadless 
pacemaker implantation in both patients with atrial fibrillation and patients in 
sinus rhythm.
CONCLUSIONS: Life expectancy, risk of infection, prosthetic valve, left 
ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), limitation for vascular access via the 
superior vena cava, and mobility and exercise capacity determine who is advised 
to undergo VR leadless pacemaker implantation. More prospective studies are 
needed to optimize existing recommendations.

Diseases of the heart and the kidney, including heart failure and chronic kidney 
disease, can dramatically impair life expectancy and the quality of life of 
patients. The heart and kidney form a functional axis; therefore, functional 
impairment of 1 organ will inevitably affect the function of the other. Fibrosis 
represents the common final pathway of diseases of both organs, regardless of 
the disease entity. Thus, inhibition of fibrosis represents a promising 
therapeutic approach to treat diseases of both organs and to resolve functional 
impairment. However, despite the growing knowledge in this field, the exact 
pathomechanisms that drive fibrosis remain elusive. RNA-sequencing approaches, 
particularly single-cell RNA-sequencing, have revolutionized the investigation 
of pathomechanisms at a molecular level and facilitated the discovery of 
disease-associated cell types and mechanisms. In this review, we give a brief 
overview over the evolution of RNA-sequencing techniques, summarize most recent 
insights into the pathogenesis of heart and kidney fibrosis, and discuss how 
transcriptomic data can be used, to identify new drug targets and to develop 
novel therapeutic strategies.

BACKGROUND: Oral multikinase inhibitors and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) 
are effective for treating advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (aHCC) but may 
increase cost. This study compared the cost-effectiveness of oral multikinase 
inhibitors and ICIs in the first-line treatment of patients with aHCC.
METHODS: A three-state Markov model was established to study the 
cost-effectiveness of drug treatment from the perspective of Chinese payers. The 
key outcomes in this study were total cost, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), 
and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER).
RESULTS: The total costs and QALYs of sorafenib, sunitinib, donafenib, 
lenvatinib, sorafenib plus erlotinib, linifanib, brivanib, sintilimab plus 
IBI305, and atezolizumab plus bevacizumab were $9070 and 0.25, $9362 and 0.78, 
$33,814 and 0.45, $49,120 and 0.83, $63,064 and 0.81, $74,814 and 0.82, $81,995 
and 0.82, $74083 and 0.85, and $104,188 and 0.84, respectively. The drug regimen 
with the lowest ICER was sunitinib ($551 per QALY), followed by lenvatinib 
($68,869 per QALY). For oral multikinase inhibitors, the ICER of lenvatinib, 
sorafenib plus erlotinib, linifanib and brivanib compared with sunitinib was 
$779576, $1534,347, $1768,971, and $1963,064, respectively. For ICIs, sintilimab 
plus IBI305 is more cost effective than atezolizumab plus bevacizumab. The model 
was most sensitive to the price of sorafenib, the utility of PD, and the price 
of second-line drugs.
CONCLUSION: For oral multikinase inhibitors, the order of possible treatment 
options is sunitinib > lenvatinib > sorafenib plus erlotinib > linifanib > 
brivanib > donafenib. For ICIs, the order of possible treatment options is 
sintilimab plus IBI305 > atezolizumab plus bevacizumab.

BACKGROUND: Early cholesterol screening and treatment in adolescents and young 
adults (AYAs) may improve cardiovascular disease (CVD) outcomes from lifelong 
high cholesterol; however, it remains controversial, and pediatric and adult 
lipid guidelines conflict.
OBJECTIVES: (Aim 1) To assess variation in patient-centered preferences about 
cholesterol screening and treatment from 17- to 21-year-old AYAs with familial 
hypercholesterolemia (FH), with obesity (OB), and also healthy (HA) and parents. 
(Aim 2) To compare cholesterol guideline strategies for AYAs.
METHODS: A diverse 20-member stakeholder panel informed our approach. For aim 1, 
we conducted an observational study of preferences using semistructured 
interviews incorporating vignettes, visual analogue scales (VAS), and open-ended 
questions about cholesterol screening and treatment scenarios. For aim 2, we 
performed a literature review and evidence synthesis and analyzed national data 
to estimate FH prevalence as key inputs for simulation and statistical models 
comparing the effectiveness of pediatric versus adult cholesterol guidelines for 
(1) 1-year screening and treatment outcomes in AYAs (including patient-centered 
quality of life estimates [VAS] from aim 1); (2) 30-year cardiovascular disease 
incidence; and (3) life expectancy for AYAs, including FH patients.
RESULTS: In aim 1, AYAs (n = 41) and parents (n = 35) from all groups (FH, OB, 
HA) perceived that all cholesterol screening scenarios would result in 
comparatively less than perfect health, with the high-risk result being furthest 
from perfect health (median = 0.50; IQR = 0.31-0.60). Notably, responses varied 
substantially, with minimum and maximum VAS ranging from 0.25 to 1.0 for 
lifestyle changes and 0.20 to 0.99 for statin. In aim 2, over 1 year the 
pediatric versus adult guidelines in the US population resulted in 240 000 
additional AYAs receiving new statin prescriptions, 2 million AYAs being 
referred for intensive lifestyle interventions, and 600 000 fewer AYAs receiving 
standard-of-care lifestyle advice. Both guidelines yielded similar 1-year 
cholesterol levels for AYAs with high low-density lipoprotein cholesterol 
(LDL-C) levels, but pediatric guidelines yielded larger declines for those with 
moderately high LDL-C. When applying VAS scores, adult guidelines resulted in 
higher 1-year VAS-adjusted outcomes for diagnosis, treatment, and diagnosis plus 
treatment because the pediatric guidelines led to more diagnoses of high 
cholesterol and more statin and lifestyle interventions, which negatively 
affected perceived health. For the 20.4 million 20-year-olds in the United 
States, the Pencina model predicted the pediatric guidelines would produce lower 
average individual 30-year CVD event likelihood compared with adult guidelines 
(3.13% [95% CI, 2.97%-3.30%] versus 3.18% [95% CI, 3.00%-3.35%]), resulting in 
10 200 fewer CVD events over 30 years. The primary benefit of screening from 
either approach accrued to AYA with FH, who experienced a 2.1-year increased 
survival. The pediatric guidelines provided additional benefit over the adult 
guidelines to the 530 000 AYA with LDL of 130 mg/dL to 189 mg/dL, increasing 
average life expectancy by 63 days.
CONCLUSIONS: We found cholesterol screening and treatment impacts AYAs’ 
perceptions of their current health, with broad variability in responses. The 
pediatric versus adult lipid guidelines would lead to more diagnoses and 
treatment, thereby lowering LDL and increasing survival. Long-term follow-up of 
AYAs undergoing cholesterol screening and treatment is needed to understand the 
real-world impact of cholesterol guidelines on patient-centered experiences and 
CVD events.

PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES: We aimed to determine why the Eagle Books, an 
illustrated series for American Indian and Alaska Native (AIAN) children to 
address type 2 diabetes, remain viable long after their release. We sought to 
answer 2 questions: Why did the books maintain popularity? What factors have 
sustained them?
INTERVENTION APPROACH: Type 2 diabetes burgeoned in the US after World War II, 
compounding a long legacy of injustices for AIAN peoples. By the 1980s, their 
rates soared above those of White people. Concerned for future generations, 
Tribal Leaders suggested that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and 
Indian Health Service use traditional storytelling to teach children about 
staying healthy. Public health interventions are most effective when culture and 
history are integrated into health education, particularly stories to address a 
relatively new disease for AIAN peoples.
EVALUATION METHODS: From 2008 through 2013, we conducted a case study among 8 
tribal communities to evaluate the uptake of the Eagle Books across Indian 
Country. To understand the Eagle Books' sustained appeal, in 2022 we reanalyzed 
the original case study themes and analyzed for the first time themes that 
emerged from evaluation results in the Eagle Books' program literature. These 
were programs that had independently evaluated their use of the Eagle Books and 
published their findings.
RESULTS: Outcomes demonstrated continuous application of the Eagle Books in 
diverse community interventions, influencing children's healthy choices. 
Community implementers described sustainability components, such as the books' 
versatility, flexibility of use, and availability online and in print.
IMPLICATIONS FOR PUBLIC HEALTH: Historical, social, economic, and environmental 
health determinants intersect with biological and behavioral factors to weave a 
complex web of causation for type 2 diabetes, beginning early in life. 
Compelling, colorful stories reflecting traditional wisdom and respect for 
Western and Indigenous science - through the eyes of a wise eagle, a clever 
rabbit, a tricky coyote, and kids in T-shirts and sneakers - can positively 
influence community health.

INTRODUCTION: Due to longer life expectancy, an increasing number of older 
people are at risk of developing cancer. Surgical resection of a non-metastatic 
and resectable digestive tumor remains the main therapeutic weapon. The 
objective of our study is to assess the possibility of curative oncological 
surgery in patients over 80years of age, to study its impact in terms of 
morbidity and mortality, and to look for risk factors for the occurrence of 
complications.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study-included patients aged 80 and over operated on 
for digestive cancer in a curative situation. This was a multicenter prospective 
cohort study. A total of 230 patients were included in the study. In addition to 
demographic and medical data, the patients all benefited from an onco-geriatric 
assessment with the performance of various tests: WHO score, G8 score, IADL 
score, ADL score, mobility score, nutritional assessment, clock, thymic 
evaluation (Mini-GDS). Data collection of geriatric scores was repeated 3months 
postoperatively.
RESULTS: Of a total of 230 patients, 51% were male and 49% female. The average 
age was 84.7years. Tumor localization was mainly colorectal (65.81%). Age had no 
influence on the mortality rate, with a mean age with no significant difference 
in the event of an unfavorable outcome or not (84.6 vs. 85years). The results at 
the different scores were then analyzed in search of a significant difference 
between preoperative and at 3months. The only significant difference found was 
in the number of patients with a WHO status of 0 (P=0.021).
CONCLUSION: Our study shows that curative oncological surgery is possible in 
elderly patients without any adverse effect on their quality of life and level 
of postoperative autonomy. The multidisciplinary geriatric approach to the 
patient must make it possible to distinguish the patients who will benefit from 
a curative treatment and those in whom the benefit-risk balance is unfavorable.

BACKGROUND: Sarcopenia, defined as an age-associated loss of skeletal muscle 
mass and function, is a major risk factor for requiring long-term care. Because 
physical activity in adolescence and older age enhances peak muscle function in 
youth and prevents muscle function decline in older age, older adults with 
exercise habits during both periods may be at a lower risk for sarcopenia. We 
investigated the relationship between exercise habits in adolescence and older 
age and sarcopenia and its components in community-dwelling older Japanese 
adults.
METHODS: This study included 1607 community-dwelling individuals (aged 65-84, 
medians 73 years, 679 men and 928 women) with complete health examinations, 
including measurements of skeletal muscle index, handgrip strength and gait 
speed, who were enrolled in the Bunkyo Health Study. We divided the participants 
into four groups according to exercise habits in adolescence and older age: no 
exercise in either period (none-none; NN), exercise only in adolescence 
(active-none; AN), exercise only in older age (none-active; NA) and exercise in 
both periods (active-active; AA). Multivariate-adjusted logistic regression 
models were used to estimate the odds ratios (ORs) and associated 95% confidence 
intervals (CIs) in each group for the prevalence of sarcopenia, defined as low 
muscle mass and low muscle performance, as compared with the NN group. Low 
muscle performance was defined as low muscle strength and/or low gait speed.
RESULTS: The total prevalence of sarcopenia was 6.6% (45/679) in men and 1.7% 
(16/928) in women, the total prevalence of low muscle mass was 14.3% (97/679) in 
men and 5.2% (48/928) in women, and the total prevalence of low muscle 
performance was 25.6% (174/679) in men and 19.6% (182/928) in women. In men, the 
ORs (95% CIs) for sarcopenia, low muscle mass and low muscle performance were 
significantly lower in the AA group (sarcopenia: 0.29 [0.09-0.95], P = 0.041; 
low muscle mass: 0.21 [0.09-0.52], P = 0.001; and low muscle performance: 0.52 
[0.28-0.97], P = 0.038). In women, the OR (95% CI) for low muscle performance 
was significantly lower in the AA group than in the other groups (0.48 
[0.27-0.84], P = 0.010), whereas none of the ORs for sarcopenia and low muscle 
mass were significant.
CONCLUSIONS: Older men with exercise habits in both adolescence and older age 
were at a lower risk of sarcopenia, low muscle mass and low muscle performance, 
whereas older women with exercise habits at both time periods were at a lower 
risk of low muscle performance.

BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: The World Health Organisation recommended immediate 
initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in all adult human immunodeficiency 
virus (HIV) patients regardless of their CD4 cell count. This study was 
undertaken to ascertain the cost-effectiveness of implementation of these 
guidelines in India.
METHODS: A Markov model was developed to assess the lifetime costs and health 
outcomes of three scenarios for initiation of ART treatment at varying CD4 cell 
count <350/mm[3], <500/mm[3] and test and treat using health system perspective 
using life-time horizon. A few input parameters for this model namely, 
transition probabilities from one stage to another stage of HIV and incidence 
rates of TB were calculated from the data of Centre of Excellence for HIV 
treatment and care, Chandigarh; whereas, other parameters were obtained from the 
published literature. Total HIV-related deaths averted, HIV infections averted 
and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio per quality adjusted life years (QALYs) 
gained were calculated.
RESULT: Test and treat intervention slowed down the progression of disease and 
averted 18,386 HIV-related deaths, over lifetime horizon. It also averted 16,105 
new HIV infections and saved 343,172 QALYs as compared to the strategy of 
starting ART at CD4 cell count of 500/mm[3]. Incremental cost per QALY gained 
for the immediate initiation of ART as compared to ART at CD4 cell count of 
500/mm[3] and 350/mm[3] was ₹ 46,599 and 80,050, respectively at reported rates 
of adherence to the therapy.
INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: Immediate ART (test and treat) is highly 
cost-effective strategy over the past criteria of delayed therapy in India. 
Cost-effectiveness of this policy is largely because of reduction in the 
transmission of HIV.

Extending the sociology of candidacy: Bourdieu's relational social class and 
mid-life women's perceptions of alcohol-related breast cancer risk.

Alcohol is a modifiable breast cancer risk, increasing risk in a dose-dependent 
manner. Mid-life women (aged 45-64 years) consume alcohol at higher rates than 
younger women and this, combined with age, make them a high-risk group for 
breast cancer. This critical public health problem has a seemingly obvious 
solution (reduce drinking); however, women do not necessarily know alcohol 
causes breast cancer, and if they do, reducing consumption is not always 
possible, or desirable. To innovate public health responses, we employ an 
interpretative sociological framework 'candidacy' to understand women's 
perspectives on breast cancer risk relative to alcohol consumption and their 
social class. Drawing on 50 interviews with Australian mid-life women, our 
findings reveal the socio-structural determinants of 'candidacy', that mean 
modifying alcohol consumption for breast cancer prevention is impacted by social 
class. Utilising Bourdieu's relational capitals, our interpretations show how 
social class shapes women's ascriptions and enactments of breast cancer 
candidacy. We offer an important theoretical extension to 'candidacy' by 
demonstrating more or less fluidity in women's assessment of breast cancer risk 
according to their agency to adopt breast cancer prevention messages. 
Understanding the social class possibilities and limitations in women's 
perceptions of breast cancer risk provides a new opportunity to reduce 
inequities in breast cancer incidence.

Effects of glycemic control on frailty: a multidimensional perspective.

Abdelhafiz AH(1).

Author information:

Diabetes prevalence increases with increasing age due to increased life 
expectancy. In older people with diabetes, frailty is an emerging 
diabetes-related complication. Although the literature is focused on the 
physical decline as the main manifestation of frailty, other domains such as 
cognitive and emotional dysfunction are commonly associated with physical 
frailty constituting a triad of impairment (TOI). The TOI is a better predictor 
of adverse outcomes than physical frailty alone. Previous diabetes studies 
focused on cardiovascular events as the main outcome with little data exploring 
the effect of glycemic control on frailty as a multidimensional perspective. 
Current evidence suggests that poor glycemic control may be associated with an 
increased risk of the three components of the TOI, however, the association of 
tighter glycemic control and the risk of TOI is inconsistent. In general HbA1c 
range of 6.5-7.9% appears to be less associated with TOI, while HbA1c > 8.0% is 
associated with a higher risk although most of the studies have limitations such 
as retrospective or cross-sectional design. So far, there is very little 
evidence from clinical trials to suggest that tight glycemic control would 
prevent or delay the development of frailty as a wide spectrum of physical, 
cognitive or emotional dysfunction. Therefore, future clinical trials are 
required to explore the effect of tight glycemic control on the multidimensional 
aspect of frailty as the main outcome. However, tight glycemic control in older 
people is associated with increased risk of hypoglycemia, which increases the 
risk of frailty. Therefore, novel hypoglycemic agents with intrinsic properties 
to reduce the risk of frailty, independent of glycemic control, are also 
required.

OBJECTIVE: To describe survival of patients with hepatic encephalopathy (HE), up 
to 5 years after initiation of rifaximin-α (RFX) treatment.
DESIGN/METHOD: A retrospective, observational extension study within 9 National 
Health Service secondary/tertiary UK care centres. All patients had a clinical 
diagnosis of HE, were being treated with RFX and were included in the previous 
IMPRESS study which reported the 1-year experience. Demographics, clinical 
outcomes, selected cirrhosis-related complications, hospital admissions and 
attendances up to 5 years from RFX initiation were extracted from patient 
medical records and hospital electronic databases. The primary outcome measure 
was survival at 5 years post-initiation of RFX treatment.
RESULTS: The study included 138 patients. The survival rate at 5 years 
post-initiation of RFX was 35% (95% CI 28.2% to 44.4%) overall and 36% (95% CI 
26.1% to 45.4%) for patients with alcohol-related liver disease. Median survival 
from RFX initiation was 2.8 years (95% CI 2.0 to 3.8; n=136). Among 48 patients 
alive at 5 years, 69% remained on RFX treatment at the end of the observation 
period, 74% reported no cirrhosis-related complications and 24% (9/37) had 
received a liver transplant. Between 1 and 5 years post-initiation, total 
numbers of liver-related emergency department visits, inpatient admissions, 
intensive care unit admissions and outpatient visits were 84, 194, 3 and 709, 
respectively; the liver-related 30-day readmission rate was 37%.
CONCLUSION: Within UK clinical practice, RFX use in HE was associated with a 35% 
survival rate with high treatment adherence, 76% transplant-free survival rate, 
minimal healthcare resource and low rates of complications at 5 years 
post-initiation.

The study of sex differences in Alzheimer's disease is increasingly recognized 
as a key priority in research and clinical development. People with Down 
syndrome represent the largest population with a genetic link to Alzheimer's 
disease (>90% in the 7th decade). Yet, sex differences in Alzheimer's disease 
manifestations have not been fully investigated in these individuals, who are 
key candidates for preventive clinical trials. In this double-centre, 
cross-sectional study of 628 adults with Down syndrome [46% female, 44.4 (34.6; 
50.7) years], we compared Alzheimer's disease prevalence, as well as cognitive 
outcomes and AT(N) biomarkers across age and sex. Participants were recruited 
from a population-based health plan in Barcelona, Spain, and from a convenience 
sample recruited via services for people with intellectual disabilities in 
England and Scotland. They underwent assessment with the Cambridge Cognitive 
Examination for Older Adults with Down Syndrome, modified cued recall test and 
determinations of brain amyloidosis (CSF amyloid-β 42 / 40 and amyloid-PET), tau 
pathology (CSF and plasma phosphorylated-tau181) and neurodegeneration
