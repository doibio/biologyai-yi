patients had Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans (80.0 % vs 31.7 %; p <  
0.001), but fewer had fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography 
(PET)-computed tomography (CT) scans (10.0 % vs 28.0 %; p = 0.004).
CONCLUSION: These data from clinical practice show minor differences in 
HRQoL/HRU between patients with advanced NSCLC with/without CNS metastases when 
applying selected clinical trial criteria. Although follow-up was short, HRQoL 
scores were similar between cohorts at all visits, supporting the wider 
inclusion of selected patients with CNS disease into clinical trials.

Importance of Wrist Movement Direction in Performing Activities of Daily Living 
Efficiently.

Moser N, O'Malley MK, Erwin A.

The wrist is an essential component in performing the activities of daily living 
(ADLs) associated with a high quality of life. After a neurological disorder, 
motor function of the hand and wrist can be affected, reducing quality of life. 
Many experiments have illustrated that more wrist flexion/extension is required 
than radial/ulnar deviation when performing ADLs; however, how this result 
translates to efficiency in performing ADLs has not been investigated. Motivated 
by clinical assessment during neurorehabilitation, in this paper we investigate 
with able-bodied participants how performing tasks representative of the 
Jebsen-Taylor Hand Function Test are impacted when a splint constrains the user 
to a single rotational degree of freedom of the wrist. Twenty participants 
enrolled in the study, performing five tasks under five conditions, including 
constraint to pure flexion/extension and radial/ulnar deviation. The importance 
of wrist movement direction in performing ADLs efficiently found in this study 
could shape clinical wrist rehabilitation paradigms and wrist rehabilitation 
robot designs.

Usability and acceptance of using a lower-limb exoskeleton controlled by a BMI 
in incomplete spinal cord injury patients: a case study.

Quiles V, Ferrero L, Ianez E, Ortiz M, Megia A, Comino N, Gil-Agudo AM, Azorin 
JM.

Spinal cord injury (SCI) limits life expectancy and causes a restriction of 
patient's daily activities. In the last years, robotics exoskeletons have 
appeared as a promising rehabilitation and assistance tool for patients with 
motor limitations, as people that have suffered a SCI. The usability and 
clinical relevance of these robotics systems could be further enhanced by 
brain-machine interfaces (BMIs), as they can be used to foster patients' 
neuroplasticity. However, there are not many studies showing the use of BMIs to 
control exoskeletons with patients. In this work we show a case study where one 
SCI patient has used a BMI based on motor imagery (MI) in order to control a 
lower limb exoskeleton that assists their gait.

Design of a Passive, Variable Stiffness Exoskeleton for Triceps Deficiency 
Mitigation.

McPherson A, Matthew R, Estrada M, Bajcsy R, Tomizuka M.

Individuals with neurological impairment, particularly those with cervical level 
spinal cord injuries (SCI), often have difficulty with daily tasks due to 
triceps weakness or total loss of function. More demanding tasks, such as 
sit-skiing, may be rendered impossible due to their extreme strength demands. 
Design of exoskeletons that address this issue by providing supplemental 
strength in arm extension is an active field of research but commercial devices 
are not yet available for use. Most current designs employ electric motors that 
necessitate the addition of bulky power sources and extraneous wiring, rendering 
the devices impractical in daily life. The possibility of powering an upper 
extremity exoskeleton passively has been explored, but to date, none have 
delivered sufficient function or strength to provide useful assistance for 
sit-skiing. We seek to rectify this with the design of a passively actuated 
exoskeletal arm brace capable of operating in two, adjustable-strength modes: 
one for low level gravity compensation to aid in active range of motion, and the 
other for more stringent weight bearing activities. The mechanism developed 
through this paper allows for an affordable, lightweight, modular device that 
can be adjusted and customized for the needs of each individual patient.

Development of a Tendon-Driven Wearable Assist System for Thumb Motion of Hand 
Paralysis.

Yoshikawa D, Kawamoto H, Sankai Y.

Thumb movement is very important for object gripping. However, when a 
cerebrovascular disorder or spinal cord injury causes hand paralysis, which 
impairs the motor function of the fingers, it becomes impossible to flex and 
extend the fingers and to move the thumb to the opposition position; this makes 
it difficult to grip objects in daily life. Several assistive devices have been 
developed for people with hand paralysis. However, they only assist 
flexion/extension of the thumb, narrow the type of grip by fixing the thumb 
position, or have large sizes and weights due to using links and frames to 
assist thumb adduction and opposition. They are not effective for daily use. 
Thumb motion assistance that does not hinder the degree of freedom of the thumb 
is important for gripping objects in everyday life. In this study, we developed 
a wearable ring and a fingertip-cap that assist two-degree-of-freedom thumb 
motion by means of a tendon-drive based on the hand's anatomy; the feasibility 
of the device is confirmed through basic experiments, in which the device was 
evaluated by a hand in a weakened state. It was confirmed that opposing movement 
and flexion/extension motion of the thumb were possible. In addition, we 
confirmed that it was possible to grip thin objects by using only thumb motion 
assistance. In conclusion, we developed a tendon-driven thumb motion assistive 
device using a ring-shaped component and confirmed the feasibility of this 
system to support the opposition/reposition and flexion/extension motions of the 
thumb.

Markov Decision Process Modeling for Multi-stage Optimization of Intervention 
and Treatment Strategies in Breast Cancer.

Imani F, Qiu Z, Yang H.

The breast cancer is a prevalent problem that undermines quality of patients' 
lives and causes significant impacts on psychosocial wellness. Advanced sensing 
provides unprecedented opportunities to develop smart cancer care. The available 
sensing data captured from individuals enable the extraction of information 
pertinent to the breast cancer conditions to construct efficient and 
personalized intervention and treatment strategies. This research develops a 
novel sequential decision-making framework to determine optimal intervention and 
treatment planning for breast cancer patients. We design a Markov decision 
process (MDP) model for both objectives of intervention and treatment costs as 
well as quality adjusted life years (QALYs) with the data-driven and 
state-dependent intervention and treatment actions. The state space is defined 
as a vector of age, health status, prior intervention, and treatment plans. 
Also, the action space includes wait, prophylactic surgery, radiation therapy, 
chemotherapy, and their combinations. Experimental results demonstrate that 
prophylactic mastectomy and chemotherapy are more effective than other 
intervention and treatment plans in minimizing the expected cancer cost of 25 to 
60 years-old patient with in-situ stage of cancer. However, wait policy leads to 
an optimal quality of life for a patient with the same state. The proposed MDP 
framework can also be generally applicable to a variety of medical domains that 
entail evidence-based decision making.

RATIONALE: Primary repair of acute ligament injury is possible due to the 
proximity of the ends. In the case of chronic injury, however, primary repair is 
difficult because the ends of ruptured ligament will have receded, and tendon 
graft, transfer, or reconstruction is needed. Satisfactory clinical results have 
been reported after reconstruction with newly formed interposed scar tissue 
between the ends of the ruptured tendon in chronic Achilles tendon injury and 
chronic extensor halluces longus (EHL) tendon injury. Here, we report a patient 
treated with reconstructive surgery using well-formed scar tissue between the 
ends in a case of chronic EDL tendon rupture.
PATIENT CONCERNS: A 34-year-old woman visited the clinic with pain in the dorsum 
aspect of the right foot associated with weakness and loss of extension of the 
second toe. She had sustained an injury to the dorsal aspect of her foot by 
falling on broken glass 3 months before coming to our clinic. The patient 
reported pain and limitation of the extension of the second toe for 2 months. 
Her pain continued to worsen, and 1 month later she was transferred to our 
hospital because a different local clinician suspected she had ruptured her 
second EDL tendon.
DIAGNOSIS: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed complete rupture of the 
second EDL tendon at the metatarsal neck junction, with displacement of the 
distal end to the proximal phalanx shaft area and of the proximal end to the 
metatarsal shaft area.
INTERVENTIONS: Chronic rupture of the EDL tendon was treated with direct 
reconstruction using interposed scar tissue.
OUTCOMES: At the 3-month follow-up, the patient was almost asymptomatic and had 
nearly full range of motion in dorsiflexion of the second toe. She has no 
discomfort in her daily life and has returned to almost her preoperative level 
of functional activities.
LESSONS: Here, we presented an extremely rare case of reconstruction using 
interposed scar tissue in a patient with neglected EDL tendon rupture. Direct 
reconstruction using interposed scar tissues located between the ends of the 
ruptured tendon is considered a reliable method with satisfactory clinical 
results in carefully selected patients.

University, Asan 31499, Korea.

BACKGROUND: In recent years, a three-dimensional ankle exercise has been 
proposed as a practice for strengthening the intrinsic foot muscles, however 
this topic still requires further research. This study aimed to compare the 
activities of the intrinsic muscles in healthy participants during 3D foot-ankle 
exercises, namely, short foot (SF), and toe spread out (TSO).
METHODS: Prior to the experiment, 16 healthy adults were trained on how to 
perform SF, TSO, and 3D foot-ankle exercises for an hour. Once all participants 
passed the foot-ankle exercise performance test, we randomly measured the 
activity of the intrinsic foot muscles using electromyography while the patients 
were performing foot-ankle exercises.
RESULTS: The abductor hallucis (AbH), extensor hallucis longus (EHL), and flexor 
hallucis brevis (FHB) activities showed significant differences among the 
exercises for intrinsic foot muscle strengthening (p < 0.01). Additionally, the 
AbH/AdH (adductor hallucis) ratio showed significant differences among the 
exercises for strengthening the intrinsic foot muscles (p < 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed that the 3D extension exercise is as effective 
as the therapeutic exercise in terms of the AbH and FHB activities, and the 
AbH/AdH ratio. On the contrary, the 3D flexion exercise showed superiority in 
terms of the EHL activity.

INTRODUCTION: Aim of this study was to analyze the overall complication and 
failure rates of Peripherally Inserted Central Catheters (PICCs), in a 1-year 
consecutive unselected cohort of 482 adult patients, affected by 
non-hematological malignancies undergoing chemotherapy.
METHODS: Adult outpatients (aged 18-75 years), with an Eastern Cooperative 
Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-2, bearing solid tumors and 
candidates for intravenous chemotherapy were eligible for the study. Exclusion 
criteria were active infections, coagulopathy (defined as platelet count 
<50,000/μL and/or prothrombin time more than 18 s), life expectancy <6 months, 
or inability to give written informed consent. Devices were all implanted in an 
outpatients' hospital facility, following predefined evidence-based 
institutional guidelines and protocols by a PICC-dedicated team at the European 
Institute of Oncology in Milan, Italy, during the 12-month period from January 1 
to December 31, 2019.
RESULTS: Five-hundred PICCs were implanted in a cohort of 482 patients during 
the time interval of this study. Thirty devices were overall removed (6.2%), 23 
as a consequence of a complication occurred, and seven inadvertently. The 
inserted PICCs accounted for a total of 49,718 catheter days in situ, median 
duration was 85.5 days [interquartile range (IQR): 56-146]. Overall there were 
42 (8.7%) complications, corresponding to 0.84 catheter-adverse events 
(CAE)/1000 PICC-days (95% CI: 0.61-1.14). There were N = 13 (2.7%) thromboses, 
N = 11 (2.3%) irreversible occlusions, N = 7 (1.5%) accidental removals, N = 5 
(1.0%) infections [two Catheter Related Blood Stream Infection (CRBSI) and three 
exit site/local infection], N = 3 (0.6%) ruptures and N = 3 (0.6%) primary or 
secondary malpositions.
CONCLUSION: This large prospective study supports the increasing use of PICCs in 
adult oncology outpatients treated in specialized centers with chemotherapy for 
non-hematological malignancies. In this clinical setting, PICC failure occurred 
in 6% only of the inserted devices.

The development of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has 
significantly improved the life expectancy of patients with human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV), but has led to the rise of chronic conditions 
including peripheral artery disease (PAD). However, trends and outcomes among 
patients with HIV undergoing lower extremity revascularization are poorly 
characterized. The aim of this study was to investigate the trends and 
perioperative outcomes of lower extremity revascularization among patients with 
HIV and PAD in a national database. The National Inpatient Sample (NIS) was 
reviewed between 2003 and 2014. All hospital admissions with a diagnosis of PAD 
undergoing lower extremity revascularization were stratified based on HIV 
status. Outcomes were assessed using propensity score matching and multivariable 
regression. Among all patients undergoing lower extremity revascularization for 
PAD, there was a significant increase in the proportion of patients with HIV 
from 0.21% in 2003 to 0.52% in 2014 (p < 0.01). Patients with HIV were more 
likely to be younger, male, and have fewer comorbidities, including coronary 
artery disease and diabetes, at the time of intervention compared to patients 
without HIV. With propensity score matching and multivariable regression, HIV 
status was associated with increased total hospital costs, but not length of 
stay, major amputation, or mortality. Patients with HIV with PAD who undergo 
revascularization are younger with fewer comorbidities, but have increased 
hospital costs compared to those without HIV. Lower extremity revascularization 
for PAD is safe for patients with HIV without increased risk of in-hospital 
major amputation or mortality, and continues to increase each year.

The organisms have the capacity to sense and adapt to their surroundings for 
their life in a dynamic environment. In response to amino acid starvation, cells 
activate a rectifying physiological program, termed the integrated stress 
response (ISR), to restore cellular homeostasis. General controlled 
non-repressed (GCN2) kinase is a master regulator of the ISR and modulates 
protein synthesis in response to amino acid starvation. We previously 
established the GCN2/ATF4/4E-BP pathway in development and aging. Here, we 
investigated the tissue-specific roles of GCN2 upon dietary restriction of amino 
acid in a Drosophila model. The knockdown of GCN2 in the gut and fat body, an 
energy sensing organ in Drosophila, abolished the beneficial effect of GCN2 in 
lifespan extension upon dietary restriction of amino acids. Proteome analysis in 
an autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (ADRP) model showed that dietary 
restriction of amino acids regulates the synthesis of proteins in several 
pathways, including mitochondrial translation, mitochondrial gene expression, 
and regulation of biological quality, and that gcn2-mutant flies have reduced 
levels of these mitochondria-associated proteins, which may contribute to 
retinal degeneration in ADRP. These results indicate that the tissue-specific 
regulation of GCN2 contributes to normal physiology and ADRP progression.

BACKGROUND: Pregnant women and infants are known as high risk groups for 
influenza. WHO recommend pregnant women be vaccinated with inactivated influenza 
vaccine. In Japan, some municipalities started to give subsidy to encourage 
pregnant women to receive a shot on their own accord, which has made the 
introduction of seasonal antepartum maternal vaccination program (AMVP) into the 
routine vaccination list a current topic in health policy and has raised the 
need to evaluate the value for money of such possibility.
METHODS: We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis to evaluate the efficiency 
of conducting AMVP in Japan. A decision tree model was adopted taking into 
consideration the duration of single-year vaccine effectiveness for infants and 
for mothers. The program targeted pregnant women aged 20-49 years old at or over 
12 weeks gestation during October 1 through March 30. Estimated probabilities of 
treatments received due to influenza for pregnant/postpartum women or their 
infants varied by calendar time, vaccination status, and/or gestational age. 
Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) compared with current no-AMVP from 
societal perspective was calculated. Transition probabilities, utility weights 
to estimate quality-adjusted life year (QALY), and disease treatment costs were 
either calculated or extracted from literature. Costs per vaccination was 
assumed at ¥3,529/US$32.1.
RESULTS: AMVP reduces disease treatment costs, while the reduction cannot offset 
the vaccination cost. Incremental QALYs were at 0.00009, among them 84.2% were 
from infants. ICER was ¥7,779,356/US$70,721 per QALY gained. One-way sensitivity 
analyses revealed that vaccine effectiveness for infant and costs per shot were 
the two main key variables affecting the ICER.
CONCLUSION: We found that vaccinating pregnant women with influenza vaccine to 
prevent unvaccinated infants and pregnant/postpartum women from 
influenza-associated disease in Japan can be cost-effective from societal 
perspective, under the WHO-suggested "cost-effective" criteria (1-3 times of 
GDP).

We present results on the mortality statistics of the COVID-19 epidemic in a 
number of countries. Our data analysis suggests classifying countries in five 
groups, (1) Western countries, (2) East Block, (3) developed Southeast Asian 
countries, (4) Northern Hemisphere developing countries and (5) Southern 
Hemisphere countries. Comparing the number of deaths per million inhabitants, a 
pattern emerges in which the Western countries exhibit the largest mortality 
rate. Furthermore, comparing the running cumulative death tolls as the same 
level of outbreak progress in different countries reveals several subgroups 
within the Western countries and further emphasises the difference between the 
five groups. Analysing the relationship between deaths per million and life 
expectancy in different countries, taken as a proxy of the preponderance of 
elderly people in the population, a main reason behind the relatively more 
severe COVID-19 epidemic in the Western countries is found to be their larger 
population of elderly people, with exceptions such as Norway and Japan, for 
which other factors seem to dominate. Our comparison between countries at the 
same level of outbreak progress allows us to identify and quantify a measure of 
efficiency of the level of stringency of confinement measures. We find that 
increasing the stringency from 20 to 60 decreases the death count by about 50 
lives per million in a time window of 20  days. Finally, we perform logistic 
equation analyses of deaths as a means of tracking the dynamics of outbreaks in 
the "first wave" and estimating the associated ultimate mortality, using four 
different models to identify model error and robustness of results. This 
quantitative analysis allows us to assess the outbreak progress in different 
countries, differentiating between those that are at a quite advanced stage and 
close to the end of the epidemic from those that are still in the middle of it. 
This raises many questions in terms of organisation, preparedness, governance 
structure and so on.

BACKGROUND: The RECOURSE trial (Study of TAS-102 in Patients With Metastatic 
Colorectal Cancer Refractory to Standard Chemotherapies) demonstrated an overall 
survival (OS) benefit of trifluridine/tipiracil (FTD/TPI) vs placebo in 
refractory metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). Given the limited benefit of 
later line treatments, we developed the Colon Life nomogram to assess the 
12-week death probability in the refractory setting.
METHODS: This post hoc analysis of RECOURSE included patients with available 
data to calculate the nomogram score: Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 
Performance Status, primary tumor resection, lactate dehydrogenase, and 
peritoneal metastases. The nomogram calibration was assessed by calibration 
plots and C-index. The nomogram prognostic and predictive ability was assessed 
by Cox model analyses and the nomogram score predictive value was explored 
according to the cutoff identified at maximum value of the Youden index in 
time-dependent receiver operating characteristic curve analysis.
RESULTS: Overall, 251 trial patients were evaluable: 90 in the placebo arm and 
161 in the FTD/TPI arm. The calibration was optimal in the placebo arm (C-index 
0.807) and suboptimal in the FTD/TPI arm (0.657). The cutoff of the nomogram 
score of 23 showed the best discriminative ability for 12-week OS (hazard ratio 
3.46, 95% confidence interval 2.17-5.51 for scores 40 vs 15) and had maximum 
value of the Youden index (0.381). Median OS and 3-month PFS were 9.0 vs 7.5 
months and 39.3% vs 5.2%, respectively, for FTD/TPI vs placebo in the low-risk 
group (score <23) and 4.8 vs 3.4 months and 22.3% vs 9.8% in the high-risk group 
(score ⩾23) (interaction NS).
CONCLUSION: The Colon Life nomogram is an accurate tool for estimating life 
expectancy in refractory mCRC. The benefit of FTD/TPI was independent of the 
predicted risk of early death.

BACKGROUND: Heart failure (HF) is a major public health issue in Canada that is 
associated with high prevalence, morbidity, and mortality rates and high 
financial and social burdens. Telemonitoring (TM) has been shown to improve 
all-cause mortality and hospitalization rates in patients with HF. The Medly 
program is a TM intervention integrated as standard of care at a large Canadian 
academic hospital for ambulatory patients with HF that has been found to improve 
patient outcomes. However, the cost-effectiveness of the Medly program is yet to 
be determined.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to conduct a cost-utility analysis of the Medly 
program compared with the standard of care for HF in Ontario, Canada, from the 
perspective of the public health care payer.
METHODS: Using a microsimulation model, individual patient data were simulated 
over a 25-year time horizon to compare the costs and quality-adjusted life years 
(QALYs) between the Medly program and standard care for patients with HF treated 
in the ambulatory care setting. Data were sourced from a Medly Program 
Evaluation study and literature to inform model parameters, such as Medly's 
effectiveness in reducing mortality and hospitalizations, health care and 
intervention costs, and model transition probabilities. Scenario analyses were 
conducted in relation to HF severity and TM deployment models. One-way 
deterministic effectiveness analysis and probabilistic sensitivity analysis were 
performed to explore the impact on the results of uncertainty in model 
parameters.
RESULTS: The Medly program was associated with an average total cost of Can 
$102,508 (US $77,626) per patient and total QALYs of 5.51 per patient compared 
with the average cost of Can $97,497 (US $73,831) and QALYs of 4.95 per patient 
in the Standard Care Group. This led to an incremental cost of Can $5011 (US 
$3794) and incremental QALY of 0.566, resulting in an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio of Can $8850 (US $6701)/QALY. Cost-effectiveness 
improved in relation to patients with advanced HF and with deployment models in 
which patients used their own equipment. Baseline and alternative scenarios 
consistently showed probabilities of cost-effectiveness greater than 85% at a 
willingness-to-pay threshold of Can $50,000 (US $37,718). Although the results 
showed some sensitivity to assumptions about effectiveness parameters, the 
intervention was found to remain cost-effective.
CONCLUSIONS: The Medly program for patients with HF is cost-effective compared 
with standard care using commonly reported willingness-to-pay thresholds. This 
study provides evidence for decision makers on the use of TM for HF, supports 
the use of a nurse-led model of TM that embeds clinically validated algorithms, 
and informs the use of economic modeling for future evaluations of early-stage 
health informatics technology.

Solid organ transplant (SOT) has transformed the survival and quality of life of 
patients with end-organ dysfunction. Lifelong need for immunosuppressive 
medications prolongs life expectancy, but results in altered immune function and 
is associated with a higher risk of certain malignancies, including chronic 
myeloid leukemia (CML). In this article, we report on six patients, aged 
41-79 years, diagnosed with CML, from 3 to 132 months post-various organ 
transplants and treated with different tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), 
including first generation (i.e., imatinib) and second generation (i.e., 
dasatinib and nilotinib). Use of second-generation TKIs has not been previously 
reported in this population. In these six cases, treatment with different TKIs 
in SOT patients was feasible, well tolerated and achieved good efficacy, which 
was maintained in extended follow-up, as well.

BACKGROUND: Cabozantinib Versus Sunitinib as Initial Targeted Therapy for 
Patients With Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma of Poor or Intermediate Risk: The 
Alliance A031203 CABOSUN Trial (CABOSUN) was a randomized, open-label, phase 2 
trial evaluating first-line cabozantinib versus sunitinib in patients with 
advanced renal cell carcinoma (aRCC). This post hoc analysis evaluated 
quality-adjusted survival using Quality-adjusted Time Without Symptoms of 
disease or Toxicity of treatment (Q-TWiST).
METHODS: Survival plots for cabozantinib and sunitinib (650-day follow-up) were 
partitioned into 3 health states: time spent before disease progression without 
toxicity (TWiST; toxicity based on National Cancer Institute Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events [version 4.0] grade 3/4 adverse events), time spent 
before disease progression with toxicity (TOX; durations of adverse events based 
on published literature), and time after disease recurrence (relapse) or 
progression to death (REL). Q-TWiST was the sum of the mean time spent in each 
state, with each state weighted to reflect patient preferences (from 0 [worst] 
to 1 [best]) using utility scores. TWiST was always weighted as 1. Overall 
survival and time to disease progression were based on all randomized patients 
(157 patients); TOX was based on all randomized and treated patients (150 
patients).
RESULTS: Across all utility combinations tested, Q-TWiST was found to be longer 
with cabozantinib versus sunitinib (range of differences, +24 days to +137 
days). Q-TWiST differences that were found to be statistically significant (+92 
days [95% confidence interval, 5-178 days] to +137 days [95% confidence 
interval, 60-214 days]) were of a clinically meaningful effect size (≥80 days), 
and were based on utility values that included those considered relevant for 
patients with aRCC (REL utility weight of 0.355, TOX utility weight of 0-1, and 
TWiST utility weight of 1).
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with aRCC, first-line cabozantinib was found to provide 
longer quality-adjusted survival compared with sunitinib. These findings may 
help to inform clinical decision making.
LAY SUMMARY: Cabozantinib and sunitinib are drugs that are used to treat 
patients with advanced kidney cancer. Clinical trials have shown that 
cabozantinib offers benefits over sunitinib, giving patients more time before 
their cancer progresses. It is important that this additional time before 
disease progression does not come at the expense of patients' quality of life, 
which can be affected by treatment side effects and/or ongoing cancer symptoms. 
Both quantity and quality of life are central to optimal treatment. In the 
current analysis of patients with advanced kidney cancer who were initiating 
treatment for the first time, cabozantinib provided more quality time before 
cancer progression compared with sunitinib.

Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) are a group of chemical compounds that 
present a considerable public health problem due to their pervasiveness and 
associations with chronic diseases. EDCs can interrupt the endocrine system and 
interfere with hormone homeostasis, leading to abnormalities in human 
physiology. Much attention has been focused on the adverse effects EDCs have on 
the reproductive system, neurogenesis, neuroendocrine system, and thyroid 
dysfunction. The eye is usually directly exposed to the surrounding environment; 
however, the influences of EDCs on the eye have received comparatively little 
attention. Ocular diseases, such as ocular surface diseases and retinal 
diseases, have been implicated in hormone deficiency or excess. Epidemiologic 
studies have shown that EDC exposure not only causes ocular surface disorders, 
such as dry eye, but also associates with visual deficits and retinopathy. EDCs 
can pass through the human blood-retinal barrier and enter the neural retina, 
and can then accumulate in the retina. The retina is an embryologic extension of 
the central nervous system, and is extremely sensitive and vulnerable to EDCs 
that could be passed across the placenta during critical periods of retinal 
development. Subtle alterations in the retinal development process usually 
result in profound immediate, long-term, and delayed effects late in life. This 
review, based on extensive literature survey, briefly summarizes the current 
knowledge about the impact of representative manufactured EDCs on retinal 
toxicity, including retinal structure alterations and dysfunction. We also 
highlight the potential mechanism of action of EDCs on the retina, and the 
predictive retinal models of EDC exposure.

OBJECTIVE: To examine the relationship between fear of cancer recurrence (FCR) 
and healthcare utilization among long-term breast cancer survivors (BCS).
METHODS: In a cross-sectional survey study, 505 younger survivors (YS: ≤45 
years) and 622 older survivors (OS: 55-70 years) 3-8 years from diagnosis 
completed a questionnaire assessing demographics, medical history, FCR, and 
healthcare utilization. Healthcare utilization consisted of breast cancer (BC) 
and non-BC-related routine and nonroutine utilization.
RESULTS: YS had significantly higher FCR than OS (p < 0.01). Independent of age, 
FCR was significantly associated with all three types of BC-related utilization 
(p < 0.05). In the multivariate models, we found a significant, positive 
interaction effect between FCR and increased comorbidities on nonroutine BC 
appointments (p = 0.01) and BC-related emergency room visits (p = 0.03). 
Additionally, comorbidities were associated with non-BC-related utilization (p < 
0.01), and nonwhites were more likely to utilize nonroutine resources, both BC 
and non-BC-related (p < 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: Increased FCR has been associated with hypervigilance among 
survivors and may lead to increased healthcare utilization. YS are at higher 
risk for increased FCR and psychosocial concerns, which may lead to 
overutilization. Providers should be aware that higher FCR may be related to 
increased use of healthcare resources and that these patients might be better 
served with supportive resources to increase quality of life and decrease 
inappropriate utilization. While this study provides increased evidence of the 
relationship between FCR and healthcare utilization, interventions are needed 
for survivors at risk to address unmet needs, especially as life expectancy 
increases among BCS.

Whether patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (aHCC) benefit from 
hepatitis C virus (HCV) eradication is uncertain. We aimed to investigate 
whether a survival benefit was conferred by HCV eradication in aHCC patients. 
This retrospective cohort study enrolled 168 HCV-infected aHCC patients from 
April 2013 to January 2019. All patients were treated with sorafenib. Endpoints 
included overall survival (OS), progression free survival (PFS), and time to 
liver decompensation. Patients with undetectable HCV RNA exhibited reduced 
aspartate aminotransferase and alpha fetoprotein levels, as well as an 
attenuated proportion of aHCC at initial diagnosis but increased albumin and 
mean sorafenib daily dosing. Patients with undetectable HCV RNA exhibited 
significantly longer OS compared to patients with detectable or unknown HCV RNA, 
which was an independent factor of OS (HR: 0.56, 95% CI: 0.350-0.903, P = .017). 
Patients with undetectable HCV RNA also presented a trend for longer PFS (HR 
0.68, 95% CI: 0.46-1.00, P = .053). The survival benefit was considered with 
respect to the significantly prolonged time to Child-Pugh B scores in patients 
with undetectable HCV RNA (HR 0.59, 95% CI: 0.38-0.92, P = .020). Patients with 
detectable HCV RNA at sorafenib initiation who further received direct acting 
antiviral therapy also had significantly longer OS (HR 0.11, 95% CI: 0.02-0.81, 
P = .030) and PFS (HR 0.23, 95% CI: 0.06-0.99, P = .048). In conclusion, 
abolishing HCV viremia preserves liver function and confers a survival benefit 
in advanced HCC patients on sorafenib treatment.

Reproductive Potential of Yeast Cells Depends on Overall Action of 
Interconnected Changes in Central Carbon Metabolism, Cellular Biosynthetic 
Capacity, and Proteostasis.

Carbon metabolism is a crucial aspect of cell life. Glucose, as the primary 
source of energy and carbon skeleton, determines the type of cell metabolism and 
biosynthetic capabilities, which, through the regulation of cell size, may 
affect the reproductive capacity of the yeast cell. Calorie restriction is 
considered as the most effective way to improve cellular physiological capacity, 
and its molecular mechanisms are complex and include several nutrient signaling 
pathways. It is widely assumed that the metabolic shift from fermentation to 
respiration is treated as a substantial driving force for the mechanism of
