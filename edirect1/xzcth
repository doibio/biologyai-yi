In this study, effects of public and private health expenditures on life 
expectancy at birth and infant mortality are analysed on a global scale with 195 
countries in the years 1995-2014. The global data set is divided into country 
categories according to growth in life expectancy, decrease in infant mortality 
rate, and level of gross national income per capita. Some new dynamic panel 
model estimators, argued to be more efficient with high persistence series and 
predetermination compared to popular but complex GMM estimators, show that 
public health expenditures are generally more health-promoting than private 
expenditures. However, the health effects are not as great as primary education 
effects. Although the new estimators provide some new and valuable information 
on health expenditure effects on life expectancy and infant mortality on a 
global scale, they do not show desired robustness.

Although human life expectancy has increased significantly over the last two 
centuries, this has not been paralleled by a similar rise in healthy life 
expectancy. Thus, an important goal of anti-aging research has been to reduce 
the impact of age-associated diseases as a way of extending the human 
healthspan. This review will explore some of the potential avenues which have 
emerged from this research as the most promising strategies and drug targets for 
therapeutic interventions to promote healthy aging.

OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were to: (1) examine whether the 
smoking status of the Canadian population is associated with a reduction in 
health-related quality of life (HRQoL); (2) calculate the overall economic 
burden of loss in HRQoL using a commonly accepted $100,000 willingness-to-pay 
(WTP) threshold to gain one quality-adjusted life year (QALY); and (3) calculate 
the loss of HRQoL over a lifetime.
METHODS: We used the 2015 Canadian Community Health Survey. The variations in 
HRQoL were estimated using a multivariable generalized linear model. Total 
expected lifetime QALYs lost due to smoking were calculated by compounding the 
annual adjusted health utility loss associated with smoking across a 
respondent's remaining years of life expectancy stratified by age. A discount 
rate of 1.5% was applied to the analysis based on recent analysis of the costs 
of borrowing in Canada.
RESULTS: Smoking is significantly associated with HRQoL loss. This study 
demonstrated that smoking is associated with a 0.05 and 0.01 reduction in Health 
Utilities Index Mark 3 (HUI3) score for current and former smokers, which also 
corresponds to a loss of 0.66 quality-adjusted life years in average, and also 
is associated with substantial individual and societal economic cost. The total 
lifetime economic burden of HUI3 loss per smoker was $65,935, yielding in 
the aggregate a societal burden of $1068.88 billion in the study population.
CONCLUSION: Tobacco control, prevention and intervention not only will improve 
HRQoL but also will generate social returns on investment.

OBJECTIFS: Dans cette étude, nous avons voulu : 1) déterminer si l’usage du 
tabac dans la population canadienne est associé à une diminution de la qualité 
de vie liée à la santé (QVLS); 2) calculer le fardeau économique global de la 
perte de QVLS à l'aide d’un seuil communément accepté, soit la volonté de payer 
100 000 $ pour gagner une année de survie ajustée pour la qualité de vie (SAQV); 
et 3) calculer la perte de QVLS sur toute une vie.
MÉTHODES: Nous avons utilisé l’édition 2015 de l’Enquête sur la santé dans les 
collectivités canadiennes. Les écarts dans la QVLS ont été estimés à l'aide d’un 
modèle linéaire généralisé multivarié. Le nombre prévu d’années de SAQV perdues 
en raison du tabagisme sur toute une vie a été calculé en additionnant la perte 
annuelle de services publics de santé associée au tabagisme sur la durée de vie 
restante de l’espérance de vie d’un répondant, stratifiée selon l’âge. Un taux 
de réduction de 1,5 % a été appliqué à l’analyse d’après une analyse récente des 
coûts d’emprunt au Canada.
RÉSULTATS: Le tabagisme présente une corrélation significative avec la perte de 
QVLS. L’étude montre qu’il est associé à une diminution de 0,05 et de 0,01 du 
HUI3 (Health Utilities Index Mark 3) pour les fumeurs actuels et les anciens 
fumeurs, respectivement, ce qui correspond aussi à une diminution de 0,66 de la 
survie ajustée pour la qualité de vie en moyenne, en plus d’être associé à un 
coût considérable pour l’individu et pour la société. Le fardeau économique 
total de la baisse du HUI3 sur la vie d’un fumeur était de 65 935 $, soit un 
fardeau sociétal global de 1 068,88 milliards de dollars dans la population 
étudiée.
CONCLUSION: Les mesures de prévention, de contrôle et d’intervention liées au 
tabagisme améliorent la QVLS, mais ce sont aussi des investissements qui 
génèrent des rendements sociaux.

BACKGROUND: The average life expectancy for people with a severe mental illness 
(SMI) such as schizophrenia or bipolar disorder is 15 to 20 years less than that 
for the population as a whole. Diabetes contributes significantly to this 
inequality, being 2 to 3 times more prevalent in people with SMI. Various risk 
factors have been implicated, including side effects of antipsychotic medication 
and unhealthy lifestyles, which often occur in the context of socioeconomic 
disadvantage and health care inequality. However, little is known about how 
these factors may interact to influence the risk of developing diabetes and poor 
diabetic outcomes, or how the organization and provision of health care may 
contribute.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to identify the determinants of diabetes and to 
explore variation in diabetes outcomes for people with SMI.
METHODS: This study will employ a concurrent mixed methods design combining the 
interrogation of electronic primary care health records from the Clinical 
Practice Research Datalink (CPRD GOLD) with qualitative interviews with adults 
with SMI and diabetes, their relatives and friends, and health care staff. The 
study has been funded for 2 years, from September 2017 to September 2019, and 
data collection has recently ended.
RESULTS: CPRD and linked health data will be used to explore the association of 
sociodemographics, illness, and health care-related factors with both the 
development and outcomes of type 2 diabetes in people with SMI. Experiences of 
managing the comorbidity and accessing health care will be explored through 
qualitative interviews using topic guides informed by evidence synthesis and 
expert consultation. Findings from both datasets will be merged to develop a 
more comprehensive understanding of diabetes risks, interventions, and outcomes 
for people with SMI. Findings will be translated into recommendations for 
interventions and services using co-design workshops.
CONCLUSIONS: Improving diabetes outcomes for people with SMI is a high-priority 
area nationally and globally. Understanding how risk factors combine to generate 
high prevalence of diabetes and poor diabetic outcomes for this population is a 
necessary first step in developing health care interventions to improve outcomes 
for people with diabetes and SMI.

BACKGROUND: Over 800,000 individuals die as a consequence of suicide annually, 
and almost two thirds of these deaths are in males. This analysis aimed to 
explore sex differences in global suicide rates with regards to geographic 
location, religion and other societal factors.
METHODS: Data on sex-specific suicide rates were collated for 182 countries in 
2015. The exposures of interest were geographical location, majority religion, 
life expectancy, total fertility rate (TFR), literacy percentage, gender 
development index and gross domestic product.
RESULTS: Both continent and predominant religion were strongly associated with 
the male:female ratio for deaths from suicide (p < 0.001 for both variables). 
The highest male:female suicide ratio was observed in the Americas with a median 
value of 4.0 (interquartile range IQR: 3.0-5.0) and the lowest gender suicide 
ratios were observed in Africa (2.7, IQR: 2.4-3.3) and Asia (2.7, IQR: 1.8-3.9). 
The predominantly Christian countries revealed the highest male:female suicide 
ratio (3.3, IQR: 2.7-4.4) whereas the predominantly Hindu countries revealed the 
lowest (1.3, IQR 1.3-3.8). The following variables were all positively 
associated with male:female ratio of suicide mortality: Life expectancy 
(Spearman's correlation coefficient r = +0.21, p = 0.004), GDP per capita 
(r = +0.26, p = 0.003), literacy percentage (r = +0.46, p < 0.0001), and Gender 
Development Index (r = +0.56, p < 0.0001). TFR was negatively associated with 
sex suicide ratio (-0.30, p < 0.0001).
CONCLUSION: There are significant differences between male and female suicide 
rates across continents and cultures. Markers of societal development are 
associated with a higher proportion of male suicides compared to females.

Comment in
    Lancet Public Health. 2019 Sep;4(9):e432-e433.

BACKGROUND: A comprehensive evaluation of the burden of injury is an important 
foundation for selecting and formulating strategies of injury prevention. We 
present results from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors 
Study (GBD) 2017 of non-fatal and fatal outcomes of injury at the national and 
subnational level, and the changes in burden for key causes of injury over time 
in China.
METHODS: Using the methods and results from GBD 2017, we describe the burden of 
total injury and the key causes of injury based on the rates of incidence, 
cause-specific mortality, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) in China 
estimated using DisMod-MR 2.1. We additionally evaluated these results at the 
provincial level for the 34 subnational locations of China in 2017, measured the 
change of injury burden from 1990 to 2017, and compared age-standardised DALYs 
due to injuries at the provincial level against the expected rates based on the 
Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a composite measure of development of income per 
capita, years of education, and total fertility rate.
FINDINGS: In 2017, in China, there were 77·1 million (95% uncertainty interval 
[UI] 72·5-81·6) new cases of injury severe enough to warrant health care and 
733 517 deaths (681 254-767 006) due to injuries. Injuries accounted for 7·0% 
(95% UI 6·6-7·2) of total deaths and 10·0% (9·5-10·5) of all-cause DALYs in 
China. In 2017, there was a three-times variation in age-standardised injury 
DALY rates between provinces of China, with the lowest value in Macao and the 
highest in Yunnan. Between 1990 and 2017, the age-standardised incidence rate of 
all injuries increased by 50·6% (95% UI 46·6-54·6) in China, whereas the 
age-standardised mortality and DALY rates decreased by 44·3% (41·1-48·9) and 
48·1% (44·6-51·8), respectively. Between 1990 and 2017, all provinces of China 
experienced a substantial decline in DALY rates from all injuries ranging from 
16·3% (3·1-28·6) in Shanghai and 60·4% (53·7-66·1) in Jiangxi. Age-standardised 
DALY rates for drowning; injuries from fire, heat and hot substances; adverse 
effects of medical treatments; animal contact; environmental heat and cold 
exposure; self-harm; and executions and police conflict each declined by more 
than 60% between 1990 and 2017.
INTERPRETATION: Between 1990 and 2017, China experienced a decrease in the 
age-standardised DALY and mortality rates due to injury, despite an increase in 
the age-standardised incidence rate. These trends occurred in all provinces. The 
divergent trends in terms of incidence and mortality indicate that with rapid 
sociodemographic improvements, the case fatality of injuries has declined, which 
could be attributed to an improving health-care system but also to a decreasing 
severity of injuries over this time period.

BACKGROUND: The value of a statistical life-year (VSLY) is the central number 
for the economic allocation of health resources. Nevertheless, empirical data on 
VSLY are lacking for most low- and middle- income countries. In the absence of 
empirically established VSLY, researchers typically use an arbitrary 3-times 
multiple of per-capita gross domestic product or per-capita income per life-year 
saved to establish cost-effectiveness.
OBJECTIVE: In this study, we establish an empirical VSLY for the first time for 
a community in sub-Saharan Africa.
METHODS: To empirically establish VSLY, we randomly selected 4000 individuals in 
the Ukonga community of Tanzania and employed a contingent valuation survey to 
measure VSLY. Using the contingent valuation methodology, we elicited 
willingness to pay for a 2% mortality risk reduction and had individuals convert 
this into an annualized payment to be paid each year over their expected 
remaining life.
RESULTS: We compared our elicited value to per-capita income and found that mean 
VSLY is $9340 (95% CI $6206-$12 373). The mean annual income in our sample was 
$2069, resulting in a VSLY that is equivalent to 4.5 times per-capita income.
CONCLUSION: Our results provide empirical evidence to support moving away from 
using the World Health Organization cost-effectiveness thresholds in practice 
because they will likely result in inefficient underinvestment in cost-effective 
interventions, even in relatively poor samples.

OBJECTIVE: We examined how personality traits of the Five Factor Model were 
related to years of healthy life years lost (mortality and disability) for 
individuals and the population.
METHOD: Participants were 131,195 individuals from 10 cohort studies from 
Australia, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States (n = 43,935 from 
seven cohort studies for the longitudinal analysis of disability, assessed using 
scales of Activities of Daily Living).
RESULTS: Lower Conscientiousness was associated with higher mortality and 
disability risk, but only when Conscientiousness was below its median level. If 
the excess risk associated with low Conscientiousness had been absent, 
population life expectancy would have been 1.3 years longer and disability-free 
life 1.0 years longer. Lower emotional stability was related to shorter life 
expectancy, but only among those in the lowest 15% of the distribution, and 
disability throughout the distribution: if the excess risk associated with low 
emotional stability had been absent, population life expectancy would have been 
0.4 years longer and disability-free life 2.4 years longer.
CONCLUSIONS: Personality traits of low Conscientiousness and low emotional 
stability are associated with reduced healthy life expectancy of individuals and 
population.

Background High levels of physical activity have been associated with longer 
life expectancy free of cardiovascular disease (CVD), but specific types of CVD 
and sedentary behavior have not been examined. We examined associations of 
leisure-time moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (LTPA) and television 
viewing with life expectancy free of 3 types of CVD. Methods and Results We 
included 13 534 participants from the ARIC (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities) 
cohort. We used multistate survival models to estimate associations of LTPA in 
the past year (no LTPA, less than the median, equal to or greater than the 
median) and television viewing (often or very often, sometimes, seldom or 
rarely) with life expectancy at age 50 free of nonfatal coronary heart disease 
(CHD), stroke, and heart failure (HF). Over 27 years of follow-up, 4519 
participants developed one of the 3 nonfatal CVDs and 5475 deaths occurred. 
Compared with participants who engaged in no LTPA, participants who engaged in 
LTPA equal to or greater than the median had longer life expectancy free of 
nonfatal CHD (men: 1.5 years [95% CI, 1.0-2.0]; women: 1.6 years [95% CI, 
1.1-2.2]), stroke (men: 1.8 years [95% CI, 1.2-2.3]; women: 1.8 years [95% CI, 
1.3-2.3]), and HF (men: 1.6 years [95% CI, 1.1-2.1]; women: 1.7 years [95% CI, 
1.2-2.2]). Compared with viewing more television, watching less television was 
associated with longer life expectancy free of CHD, stroke, and HF (≈0.8 year). 
Conclusions Higher levels of LTPA and less television viewing were associated 
with longer life expectancy free of CHD, stroke, and HF. Engaging in LTPA and 
watching less television may increase the number of years lived free of CHD, 
stroke, and HF.

BACKGROUND: The increase in life expectancy and the aging of the population have 
a significant impact on the informal care provided by caregivers. Protecting 
caregivers against excessive burden has become a public health priority. The 
majority of studies target only those providing care for dependent elderly 
people. The aim of this study was to describe the characteristics of informal 
caregivers of non-dependent elderly persons, their difficulties and their level 
of burden.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 876 dyads: elderly people 
(over 70 years of age, non-dependent, living at home and having requested 
assistance from CARSAT South-East) and their caregivers. Two questionnaires were 
administered: one for the elderly (including the Frailty Group Iso-Resource 
Evaluation) and one for caregivers (including the Mini-Zarit Scale). A 
multi-component analysis and a logistic regression were performed.
RESULTS: The elderly were mainly women (77.6%) with a mean age of 82.2±5.8 years 
and most were frail (94.7%). Most of the caregivers were women (64.5%) with a 
mean age of 62.7±13.7 years. The multi-component analysis showed three 
categories of caregivers: spouses, children and others. Among them, spouses 
performed the most tasks (4.8±2.6) and had the greatest burden. Caregivers in 
the "others" category were the least burdened and were the least impacted in 
their daily life. The children category caregivers were divided into two 
subgroups: those with characteristics similar to "others" caregivers and those 
with characteristics similar to "spouse" caregivers. Heavy burden was related to 
greater impact on daily life, poor relationships with the elderly and 
caregivers' difficulties in performing their role.
CONCLUSION: This study confirms the heterogeneous nature of informal caregiver 
profiles. It also shows that the characteristic features and the burden of these 
caregivers are similar whether the elderly person is dependent or non-dependent 
but frail.

OBJECTIVES: Although stronger social relationships have been associated with 
reduced mortality risk in prior research, their associations with favorable 
health outcomes are understudied. We evaluated whether higher social integration 
levels were associated with longer life span and greater likelihood of achieving 
exceptional longevity.
METHOD: Women from the Nurses' Health Study completed the Berkman-Syme Social 
Network Index in 1992 (N = 72,322; average age = 58.80 years), and were followed 
through 2014 with biennial questionnaires. Deaths were ascertained from 
participants' families, postal authorities, and death registries. Accelerated 
failure time models adjusting for relevant covariates estimated percent changes 
in life span associated with social integration levels; logistic regressions 
evaluated likelihood of surviving to age 85 years or older among women who could 
reach that age during follow-up (N = 16,818).
RESULTS: After controlling for baseline demographics and chronic diseases, 
socially integrated versus isolated women had 10% (95% confidence interval [CI] 
= 8.80-11.42) longer life span and 41% (95% CI = 1.28-1.54) higher odds of 
surviving to age 85 years. All findings remained statistically significant after 
further adjusting for health behaviors and depression.
DISCUSSION: Better social integration is related to longer life span and greater 
likelihood of achieving exceptional longevity among midlife women. Findings 
suggest social integration may be an important psychosocial asset to evaluate 
for promoting longer, healthier lives.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the decision-making processes applied by people with 
dementia and family carers participating in using health economic approaches to 
value dementia-specific quality of life states.
METHODS: People with dementia (n = 13) and family carers (n = 14) participated 
in valuing quality of life states using two health economic approaches: Discrete 
Choice Experiment (DCE) and Best Worst Scaling (BWS). Participants were 
encouraged to explain their reasoning using a "Think Aloud" approach.
RESULTS: People with dementia and family carers adopted a range of 
decision-making strategies including "anchoring" the presented states against 
current quality of life, or simplifying the decision-making by focusing on the 
sub-set of attributes deemed most important. Overall, there was strong evidence 
of task engagement for BWS and DCE.
CONCLUSIONS: Health economic valuation approaches can be successfully applied 
with people with dementia and family carers. These data can inform the 
assessment of benefits from their perspectives for incorporation within economic 
evaluation.

Hepatocellular carcinoma is one of the most frequent malignant tumors worldwide: 
Portal vein tumor thrombosis (PVTT) occurs in about 35%-50% of patients and 
represents a strong negative prognostic factor, due to the increased risk of 
tumor spread into the bloodstream, leading to a high recurrence risk. For this 
reason, it is a contraindication to liver transplantation and in several 
prognostic scores sorafenib represents its standard of care, due to its 
antiangiogenetic action, although it can grant only a poor prolongation of life 
expectancy. Recent scientific evidences lead to consider PVTT as a complex 
anatomical and clinical condition, including a wide range of patients with 
different prognosis and new treatment possibilities according to the degree of 
portal system involvement, tumor biological aggressiveness, complications caused 
by portal hypertension, patient's clinical features and tolerance to 
antineoplastic treatments. The median survival has been reported to range 
between 2.7 and 4 mo in absence of therapy, but it can vary from 5 mo to 5 
years, thus depicting an extremely variable scenario. For this reason, it is 
extremely important to focus on the most adequate strategy to be applied to each 
group of PVTT patients.

BACKGROUND: To assess the cost and patient impact of using small bowel and colon 
video capsule endoscopy (SBC) for scheduled monitoring of Crohn's disease (CD).
METHODS: An individual-patient, decision-analytic model of the CD care pathway 
was developed given current practice and expert input. A literature review 
informed clinical endpoints with data from peer-reviewed literature. Four 
thousand simulated CD patients were extrapolated from summary patient data from 
the Project Sonar Database. Two monitoring scenarios were assessed in this 
population. The first scenario represented common monitoring practice (CMP) for 
CD (ileocolonoscopy plus imaging), while in the second scenario patients were 
converted to disease monitoring using SBC. The cost-effectiveness of using SBC 
was assessed over 20 years. The cost of switching 50% of patients to SBC was 
assessed over 5 years for a health-plan including 12,000 patients with CD. 
Uncertainty of results was assessed using probabilistic sensitivity analysis.
RESULTS: All patient groups showed increased quality of life with SBC versus 
CMP, with the highest gain in active symptomatic patients. Over 20 years, SBC 
reduced costs ($313,367 versus $320,015), increased life expectancy (18.15 
versus 17.9 years) and increased quality of life (8.7 versus 8.0 QALY), making 
it a cost-effective option. SBC was cost-effective in 71% of individuals and 78% 
of populations including 50 patients. A payer implementing SBC in 50% of 
patients over 5 years could expect a decreased cost of monitoring (-$469 mean 
per patient) and surgery (-$698), but increased costs for active treatments 
(+$717). The discounted mean annual cost of care using CMP was $22,681 per 
patient over 5 years. The annual savings were $1135 per SBC-patient. The total 
savings for the payer over 5 years were $36.5 million.
CONCLUSION: SBC is likely to be a cost-effective and cost-saving strategy for 
monitoring CD in the US.

King Saud University, Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

BACKGROUND: In the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the 2016 Census indicated that there 
were more than 1 million people aged 65 years and older, representing 3.3% of 
the population. Increased life expectancy will lead to a significant increase in 
the elderly population in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia by 5-fold (18%) in 2050.
AIM: This study aimed to measure internal medicine and family medicine 
residents' attitudes toward elderly patients and evaluate their interest in and 
barriers to geriatric medicine at King Saud University Medical City.
METHOD: A cross-sectional observational analytical study using a convenient 
sampling method was performed in the internal medicine and family medicine 
departments at King Saud University Medical City, Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi 
Arabia, from April 2017 to August 2017. The total sample size was 101 residents. 
Data were collected via an online survey using a predesigned validated 
questionnaire (University of California at Los Angeles Geriatrics Attitudes 
Scale).
RESULTS: The results showed a neutral attitude of both family and internal 
medicine residents with p=0.9 and p=0.6, respectively, without any significant 
association with their training levels. Moreover, this study showed that 87% of 
the residents were not willing to consider geriatric medicine as a subspecialty 
due to the unavailability of a local geriatric training program (59.5%), whereas 
the cognitive capacity of the patients was the least barrier chosen by the 
residents (4.8%).
CONCLUSION: Based on the findings of this study, most of the participants did 
not receive training in geriatric medicine, which mandates the need for early 
exposure to geriatric training in medical schools and the need to integrate this 
type of training within the major postgraduate training programs of the Saudi 
Commission for Health Specialties .

University, Toyoake, Nagoya, Aichi Prefecture, Japan.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The elderly population is increasing in the world, 
especially in developed countries. The gain in life expectancy is remarkable in 
Japan, consequently incidence of aneurysms increases in this population. The 
purpose of this study is to evaluate the surgical treatment and outcome of 
patients aged more than 75 years treated for unruptured intracranial aneurysms.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study for unruptured cerebral 
aneurysms operated between September 2014 and August 31, 2018, in Fujita Health 
University, Banbuntane Hotokukai Hospital, for people aged more than 75 years. A 
demographic study was done. We also studied aneurysm location, aneurysm size, 
outcome, duration of stay, and complications.
RESULTS: About 61 patients aged more than 75 years were operated in 4 years, 
comprising 12 males and 45 females. The mean age was 79.32 ± 3.29 years. Mean 
size of the aneurysm was 6.22 ± 3.28. Aneurysm location (P = 0.0037), associated 
risk factors (P = 0.006), and association of hypertension and diabetes (P = 
0.0362) influence outcome. Length of stay is directly correlated with outcome (P 
= 0.009).
CONCLUSIONS: Elder patients with hypertension and diabetes or associated risk 
factors having a posterior circulation aneurysm have a poor diagnosis.

Objective: The value of cochlear implantation (CI) has not been established in 
Taiwan. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of 
paediatric CI within the context of Taiwan's national health insurance (NHI) 
programme.Design: A Markov model-based cost-utility analysis (CUA) was conducted 
to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a unilateral CI (UCI) with a contralateral 
acoustic hearing aid (UCI-HA) compared with a bilateral HA. We performed one-way 
sensitivity analyses to identify the cost variables that affected the 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) the most. Monte Carlo simulation was 
used to explore the simultaneous effect of all uncertain parameters on 
cost-effectiveness.Study sample: Not applicable.Results: Compared with bilateral 
HAs, the ICER for UCI-HA was $6487 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. 
The ICERs were consistently below $7000 per QALY gained and were most sensitive 
to the selling price of the external CI device. When this selling price 
increased by 10%, the ICER of UCI-HA would increase to $6954 per QALY gained. 
UCI-HA has a probability greater than 50% of being cost-effective if the 
cost-effectiveness threshold exceeds approximately $10,000 per QALY.Conclusions: 
Our analysis suggested that within the context of Taiwan's NHI programme, UCI is 
highly cost-effective for deaf children.

Molecularly-targeted anticancer treatments - a short appraisal Abstract. 
Molecularly-targeted or personalized systemic treatment has substantially 
transformed modern oncology, and has improved the prognosis of many tumor 
entities, in particular advanced solid and hematological malignancies. The bulk 
of molecularly-targeted anticancer drugs comprise small orally administered 
molecules, most prominently the tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI). The respective 
tumor entities treated by those drugs typically harbour specific genetic 
aberrations that we often call 'driver mutations', referring to their 
transforming and tumorigenic properties. Molecularly-targeted anticancer drugs 
fit to these genetic aberrations as they are able to specifically inhibit 
growth-stimulating signals. The success story of modern TKI's started 1999 with 
the use of the anti-BCR / ABL TKI imatinib in chronic myelogenous leucemia (CML) 
that enables those patients to achieve a virtually normal life expectancy. Since 
then, many molecularly-targeted anticancer drugs and TKI's have been approved 
for a wide range of malignancies. The next level of personalized oncological 
treatment will have to deal with much less frequent genetic aberrations that are 
inherently more difficult to spot in the tumor and to study. Newer techniques 
including next-generation sequencing (NGS) will help cancer specialists to 
screen their patients for genetic aberrations and get the most benefit from 
personalized oncology.

Publisher: Zusammenfassung. Die molekular zielgerichtete oder personalisierte 
Onkologie hat die Therapie etlicher Tumorentitäten transformiert, und ist in 
diesem Sinne zu einem gewissen Synonym für eine zukunftsgerichtete Medizin 
geworden. Bei der personalisierten Onkologie kommen primär ’kleine Moleküle’ 
(molecularly targeted therapy, MTT zum Zuge, welche meist peroral verabreicht 
werden. Die entsprechenden Tumorerkrankungen weisen dabei entsprechende 
somatische Genmutationen auf, die wir gerne als Treibermutationen bezeichnen, da 
sie zu einem grossen Teil für das Tumorwachstum verantwortlich sind, und durch 
die verabreichten MTT inhibiert werden. Selbstverständlich weisen nur gewisse 
Tumorerkrankungen solche Treibermutationen auf und werden entsprechend mit MTT 
behandelt. Seit Entwicklung des ersten MTT, dem anti-BCR / ABL 
Tyrosinkinaseinhibitor (TKI) Imatinib bei der chronisch myeloischen Leukämie 
(CML) im Jahre 1999, hat eine grosse Anzahl MTT ihre Zulassung in der Onkologie 
erhalten. Dabei wurden bis anhin vor allem die ’tiefhängenden Früchte’ geerntet, 
indem die meisten Treibermutationen in einer Häufigkeit von über 1 % vorkommen. 
In einem nächsten Schritt soll die Einführung der Methodik des sogenannten’next 
generation sequencing’ (NGS) die personalisierte Onkologie für noch mehr 
Krebspatienten zugänglich machen.

Obesity: epidemiology, socio-political implications and conventional management 
Abstract. Obesity is a chronic and complex psychosomatic disorder of 
multifactorial origin associated with cardiovascular, metabolic, respiratory, 
orthopedic and psychological comorbidities. This polimorbidity requires lifelong 
monitoring and specialized multidisciplinary management. In addition, the silent 
nature of these diseases, associated with the aging of the population and 
growing life expectancy, further increases the impact of this chronic disease on 
the overall morbidity and mortality. In Switzerland, obesity is now epidemic, as 
it is worldwide, and affects about 11 % of our population. This percentage is 
gradually increasing to the point that obesity is considered a public health 
problem. The direct and indirect costs of obesity account for about 8 % of total 
health consumption. The management of this complex disease must always be 
long-term and must integrate the dietary, behavioral and psychological aspects 
according to the profile of the patient.

Publisher: Résumé. L’obésité est une maladie psychosomatique chronique et 
complexe d’origine multifactorielle souvent associée à comorbidités 
cardiovasculaires, métaboliques, respiratoires, orthopédiques et psychologiques. 
Ce contexte de polimorbidité nécessite d’un suivi à vie et d’une prise en charge 
multidisciplinaire spécialisé. De plus le caractère silencieux de ces maladies, 
associé au vieillissement de la population et l’augmentation de l’espérance de 
vie, augmente encore plus l’impact de la maladie chronique sur la globalité de 
la morbidité et de la mortalité. En Suisse l’obésité a désormais un caractère 
épidémique, comme dans le monde entier, et concerne environ le 11 % de notre 
population. Ce pourcentage augmente progressivement au point que l’obésité est 
considérée comme un problème de santé publique. En effet les coûts directs et 
indirects imputés à l’obésité correspondent à environ 8 % des dépenses totales 
de la santé. La prise en charge de cette maladie complexe doit être toujours à 
long terme et doit intégrer les aspects diététiques, comportementaux et 
psychologiques en fonction du profil du patient.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this review is to critically appraise the literature 
for evidence supporting the health care resource utilization and 
cost-effectiveness of spinal cord stimulation (SCS) compared with conventional 
therapies (CTs) for chronic low back and leg pain.
METHODS: The PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and Rehabilitation & Sports 
Medicine databases were searched for studies published from January 2008 through 
October 2018, using the following MeSH terms: "spinal cord stimulation," 
"chronic pain," "back pain," "patient readmission," "economics," and "costs and 
cost analysis." Additional sources were added based on bibliographies and 
consultation with experts. The following data were extracted and analyzed: 
demographic information, study design, objectives, sample sizes, outcome 
measures, SCS indications, complications, costs, readmissions, and resource 
utilization data.
