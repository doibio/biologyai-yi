compared with the baseline or standard of care. In a theoretical cohort of 
480,000 births, collaborative implementation added 182 QALYs (0.000379/birth) by 
averting 913 cases of SMM, 28 emergency hysterectomies, and one maternal 
mortality. Additionally, it saved $9 million ($17.78/birth) due to averted SMM 
costs. Although sensitivity analyses across parameter uncertainty ranges 
provided cases where the intervention was not cost saving, it remained cost 
effective throughout all analyses. Additionally, scenario-based sensitivity 
analysis found the intervention cost effective regardless of birth volume and 
implementation costs.
CONCLUSION: California's statewide perinatal quality collaborative initiative to 
reduce SMM from hemorrhage was cost effective-representing an inexpensive 
quality-improvement initiative that reduces the incidence of maternal morbidity 
and mortality, and potentially provides cost savings to the majority of birthing 
hospitals.

BACKGROUND: We aimed to estimate the incremental lifetime effects, costs, and 
net-monetary-benefit (NMB) of knowing BRCA information by testing of patients 
with low-risk localized prostate cancer (PCa) in the US and guiding subsequent 
screening and treatment, and the cumulative savings or losses of yearly cohort 
testing over 16 years. We compared two strategies: (1)'with BRCA information' 
and (2)'without BRCA information.' We also estimated the expected value of 
perfect information.
METHODS: The incremental NMB (INMB) quantified the monetized benefit per person 
of knowing BRCA status. The net-monetized-value of knowing BRCA information was 
estimated by multiplying the INMB with the eligible population.
RESULTS: The INMBs of knowing BRCA information were $43,357 (payer) and $43,487 
(society). in payer and societal perspectives, respectively. Escalated to the 
eligible patients in 2020, knowing BRCA status resulted in net monetized 
lifetime value of $1.7 billion (payer and society) for the 2020 cohort; and 
yielded accumulated net-monetized-value of $28.0 billion (payer) and $28.1 
billion (society) over 16 yearly cohorts of eligible PCa patients.
CONCLUSIONS: The economic value of knowing BRCA status for all low-risk 
localized PCa patients in the US provides short-term and long-term evidence for 
BRCA testing to screen early and optimize treatment.

BACKGROUND: Prenatal fine particulate matter (PM2.5) exposure is related to 
various neonatal diseases (ND). However, data and studies assessing the neonatal 
disease burden caused by PM2.5 at the global level are limited, especially 
comparing countries with various socioeconomic development levels. We, 
therefore, assessed three-decades spatiotemporal changes in neonatal disease 
burden from 1990 at a national level, combined with the socio-demographic index 
(SDI).
METHODS: We extracted statistics from the Global Burden of Disease Study 
database for this retrospective study, and analyzed differences in the 
age-standardized mortality rate (ASMR) of ND and five sub-causes related to 
PM2.5 by gender, nationality, and SDI. To describe the trend of ASMR, the 
Joinpoint model was adopted to predict the annual percentage change (APC) and 
the average annual percentage changes (AAPCs). We executed the Gaussian process 
regression model to predict the relevance between SDI and ASMR.
RESULTS: The ND burden associated with PM2.5 kept rising since 1990, especially 
in low-middle SDI regions, South Asia, and Sub-Saharan Africa, and the sex ratio 
of ASMR was >1 at the global level and all five SDI regions. The leading cause 
of death was neonatal preterm birth. The global ASMR level of ND was 2.09 per 
100,000 population in 2019 and AAPCs was 0.91 (98 % CI: 0.28, 1.55) meanwhile 
AAPCs decreased with rising SDI levels. The decreasing trend of ASMR in ND was 
detected in regions with higher SDI, such as North America, Europe, and 
Australasia.
CONCLUSIONS: In the past three decades, the global burden of ND related to PM2.5 
has ascended considerably in lower SDI regions hence PM2.5 is still considered a 
notable environmental hazard factor for newborn diseases.

Sinorhizobium meliloti Rm1021 (S. meliloti Rm1021) is a Gram-negative, 
soil-dwelling α-proteobacterium which serves as a model microorganism for the 
studies of symbiotic nitrogen fixation. The S. meliloti Rm1021 genome consists 
of one chromosome and two megaplasmids, pSymA and pSymB. Gene deletion is an 
essential tool for the elucidation of gene function and generation of mutants 
with improved properties. However, only two gene deletion methods, 
counterselectable marker sacB-based and FLP/FRT, Cre/loxP site-specific 
recombination, have been reported for S. meliloti Rm1021 gene deletion. Both 
methods require time-consuming and tedious gene cloning and conjugation steps. 
Herein, a λ Red recombineering-mediated gene deletion strategy is reported. The 
mutant was obtained via electroporating overlap-extension PCR-generated linear 
targeting DNA into Red-proficient cells. One gene each from the S. meliloti 
Rm1021 chromosome, megaplasmid SymA and pSymB was deleted, with deletion 
efficiency up to 100%. The straightforward and highly efficient recombineering 
procedure holds the promise to be a general gene manipulation method for S. 
meliloti Rm1021.

Obesity is caused by a long-term difference between energy intake and 
expenditure - an imbalance that is seemingly easily restored by increasing 
exercise and reducing caloric consumption. However, as simple as this solution 
appears, for many people, losing excess weight is difficult to achieve and even 
more difficult to maintain. The reason for this difficulty is that energy intake 
and expenditure, and by extension body weight, are regulated through complex 
hormonal, neural and metabolic mechanisms that are under the influence of many 
environmental factors and internal responses. Adding to this complexity, the 
microorganisms (microbes) that comprise the gut microbiota exert direct effects 
on the digestion, absorption and metabolism of food. Furthermore, the gut 
microbiota exerts a miscellany of protective, structural and metabolic effects 
both on the intestinal milieu and peripheral tissues, thus affecting body weight 
by modulating metabolism, appetite, bile acid metabolism, and the hormonal and 
immune systems. In this Review, we outline historical and recent advances in 
understanding how the gut microbiota is involved in regulating body weight 
homeostasis. We also discuss the opportunities, limitations and challenges of 
using gut microbiota-related approaches as a means to achieve and maintain a 
healthy body weight.

BACKGROUND: Neonatal health is a cornerstone for the healthy development of the 
next generation and a driving force for the progress of population and society 
in the future. Updated information on the burden of neonatal disorders (NDs) are 
of great importance for evidence-based health care planning in China, whereas 
such an estimate has been lacking at national level. This study aims to estimate 
the temporal trends and the attributable burdens of selected risk factors of NDs 
and their specific causes in China from 1990 to 2019, and to predict the 
possible trends between 2020 and 2024.
METHODS: Data was explored from the Global Burden of Disease study (GBD) 2019. 
Six measures were used: incidence, mortality, prevalence, disability-adjusted 
life years (DALYs), years lived with disability (YLDs), and years of life lost 
(YLLs). Absolute numbers and age-standardized rates (with 95% uncertainty 
intervals) were calculated. The specific causes of NDs mainly included neonatal 
preterm birth (NPB), neonatal encephalopathy due to birth asphyxia and trauma 
(NE), neonatal sepsis and other neonatal infections (NS), and hemolytic disease 
and other neonatal jaundice (HD). An autoregressive integrated moving average 
(ARIMA) model was used to forecast disease burden from 2020 to 2024.
RESULTS: There were notable decreasing trends in the number of deaths (84.3%), 
incidence (30.3%), DALYs (73.5%) and YLLs (84.3%), while increasing trends in 
the number of prevalence (102.3%) and YLDs (172.7%) from 1990 to 2019, 
respectively. The corresponding age-standardized rates changed by -74.9%, 0.1%, 
-65.8%, -74.9%, 86.8% and 155.1%, respectively. Four specific causes of NDs 
followed some similar and different patterns. The prediction results of the 
ARIMA model shown that all measures still maintained the original trends in the 
next five years. Low birth weight, short gestation, ambient particulate matter 
pollution and household air pollution from solid fuels were the four leading 
risk factors.
CONCLUSION: The health burden due to NDs is declining and is likely to continue 
to decline in the future in China. Delaying the increasing burden of disability 
may be the next target of concern. Targeted prevention and control strategies 
for specific causes of NDs are urgently needed to reduce the disease burden.

An increasing number of studies emphasize the role of non-coding variants in the 
development of hereditary diseases. However, the interpretation of such variants 
in clinical genetic testing still remains a critical challenge due to poor 
knowledge of their pathogenicity mechanisms. It was previously shown that 
variants in 5'-untranslated regions (5'UTRs) can lead to hereditary diseases due 
to disruption of upstream open reading frames (uORFs). Here, we performed a 
manual annotation of upstream translation initiation sites (TISs) in human 
disease-associated genes from the OMIM database and revealed ∼4.7 thousand of 
TISs related to uORFs. We compared our TISs with the previous studies and 
provided a list of 'high confidence' uORFs. Using a luciferase assay, we 
experimentally validated the translation of uORFs in the ETFDH, PAX9, MAST1, 
HTT, TTN,GLI2 and COL2A1 genes, as well as existence of N-terminal CDS extension 
in the ZIC2 gene. Besides, we created a tool to annotate the effects of genetic 
variants located in uORFs. We revealed the variants from the HGMD and ClinVar 
databases that disrupt uORFs and thereby could lead to Mendelian disorders. We 
also showed that the distribution of uORFs-affecting variants differs between 
pathogenic and population variants. Finally, drawing on manually curated data, 
we developed a machine-learning algorithm that allows us to predict the TISs in 
other human genes.

Rho promotes Rho-dependent termination (RDT) at the Rho-dependent terminator, 
producing a variable-length region without secondary structure at the 3' end of 
mRNA. Determining the exact RDT site in vivo is challenging, because the 3' end 
of mRNA is rapidly removed after RDT by 3'-to-5' exonuclease processing. Here, 
we applied synthetic small RNA (sysRNA) to identify the RDT region in vivo by 
exploiting its complementary base-pairing ability to target mRNA. Through the 
combined analyses of rapid amplification of cDNA 3' ends, primer extension, and 
capillary electrophoresis, we could precisely map and quantify mRNA 3' ends. We 
found that complementary double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) formed between sysRNA and 
mRNA was efficiently cleaved by RNase III in the middle of the dsRNA region. The 
formation of dsRNA appeared to protect the cleaved RNA 3' ends from rapid 
degradation by 3'-to-5' exonuclease, thereby stabilizing the mRNA 3' end. We 
further verified that the signal intensity at the 3' end was positively 
correlated with the amount of mRNA. By constructing a series of sysRNAs with 
close target sites and comparing the difference in signal intensity at the 3' 
end of wild-type and Rho-impaired strains, we finally identified a region of 
increased mRNA expression within the 21-bp range, which was determined as the 
RDT region. Our results demonstrated the ability to use sysRNA as a novel tool 
to identify RDT regions in vivo and expand the range of applications of sysRNA. 
IMPORTANCE sysRNA, which was formerly widely employed, has steadily lost 
popularity as more novel techniques for suppressing gene expression come into 
existence because of issues such as unstable inhibition effect and low 
inhibition efficiency. However, it remains an interesting topic as a regulatory 
tool due to its ease of design and low metabolic burden on cells. Here, for the 
first time, we discovered a new method to identify RDT regions in vivo using 
sysRNA. This new feature is important because since the discovery of the Rho 
protein in 1969, specific identification of RDT sites in vivo has been difficult 
due to the rapid processing of RNA 3' ends by exonucleases, and sysRNA might 
provide a new approach to address this challenge.

The expansion of life expectancy has precipitated a cultural transformation of 
the life course - altering the perceived temporal contours of middle and later 
life. However, our understanding of these perceptions is limited by the absence 
of a framework within which to examine them. This paper builds on the life 
course perspective - which emphasizes the objective patterning of lives - by 
focusing on the subjective side of the life course. Drawing on theoretically, 
methodologically, and substantively diverse studies, this paper develops the 
concept of the subjective life course - a term we use to denote individuals' 
perceptions of the life course, including its structure and timing and their 
advancing location in it. We outline two dimensions of the subjective life 
course - the target of the perception (i.e., generalized other versus self) and 
the temporal frame of reference (i.e., past, present, or future). Using the 
resulting framework as an organizational tool, we then discuss key constructs 
located at each intersection along these dimensions, providing examples, where 
possible, of empirical studies examining them. We close with a discussion of two 
broad directions for research: leveraging the framework to yield insight on the 
subjective life course and exploring links between objective and subjective 
dimensions of the life course.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The IMbrave150 clinical trial assessed the efficacy and 
safety of atezolizumab in combination with bevacizumab (ATZ+BVA) versus 
sorafenib in adults with advanced/unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma, who 
have not received prior systemic treatment. Our aim was to assess the 
cost-effectiveness of ATZ+BVA versus sorafenib in France based on an updated 
prices and considering French National real-world data, to confirm the initial 
recommendations from the Heath Technology Assessment submission published in 
2021, and provide additional visibility to decision-makers reflecting current 
clinical practice.
METHODS: A partition survival model was developed to project clinical outcomes, 
quality of life, and costs of patients with HCC treated with ATZ+BVA versus 
sorafenib over a lifetime horizon. Survival outcomes were extrapolated via 
parametric functions for both treatment strategies. Quality of life (EQ-5D-5L, 
French tariffs) were sourced from IMbrave150. The Guyot method was considered as 
a scenario analysis by integrating retrospective real-world data extracted from 
the French Health Insurance Database to refine long term survival 
extrapolations.
RESULTS: In the reference case, ATZ+BVA was associated with 0.61 additional 
Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) compared to sorafenib (1.95 vs 1.35), and an 
incremental cost of €92,704. The incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR) was 
152,974 €/QALY gained. Adjusting the survival curves with French external 
evidence led to a 14% ICUR reduction (131,163 €/QALY).
CONCLUSIONS: ATZ+BVA is a cost-effective strategy based on the range recently 
published for the value of a QALY in France and offers better chances of 
survival to patients.

INTRODUCTION: Persons with schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders (PwS) 
smoke more, and have twice the rate of mortality, with 10-25 years lower life 
expectancy than the general population. Evidence-based tobacco cessation 
interventions would help in quitting.
AIM: To evaluate the effectiveness of a personalized tobacco cessation 
intervention package for patients attending the outpatient psychiatry 
department.
METHODS: The study adopted a two-group experimental design in PwS, using a 
simple randomization method. Eligible participants were randomly allocated to 
either the intervention group (n = 85) receiving the intervention package or the 
control group (n = 85) receiving brief advice to stop tobacco. The study 
outcomes were measured at baseline, 1, 3, and 6 months. SPSS 23 was used for 
data analysis. Intention-to-treat analysis was used to manage missing data. The 
p-value of < 0.05 is considered statistically significant.
RESULTS: At 6 months, there was a significant difference (p < 0.001) in 7 days 
point-prevalence abstinence (28 % vs 10.8 %), reduction of tobacco by at least 
50 % (62.4 % vs 40.9 %) with an attrition rate of 15.3 % vs 30.5 % in 
intervention and control group respectively. Reduction in nicotine dependence 
and tobacco craving, an increase in motivation level, quit attempts and clinical 
improvement favored the intervention group. 16.5 % of participants expressed 
interest in pharmacotherapy for tobacco cessation, 3.5 % were referred to a 
specialized tobacco cessation center, two control group participants were 
hospitalized for drug default, and withdrawal symptoms reported were mild.
CONCLUSION: Implementing a tobacco cessation intervention based on the stage of 
motivation aids in abstinence and reduction of tobacco use in PwS.

Acute palliative care units (APCUs) are lacking in most cancer hospitals and 
even when palliative care units are present, they are predominantly based on a 
traditional hospice-like model for patients with short life expectancy. This 
scoping review examined the papers assessing the activities of APCU. Data from 
literature regarding APCU characteristics, activities and outcomes have shown 
important differences among different countries.In comparison with existing data 
on traditional hospices, APCU provided a whole range of palliative care 
interventions, from an early treatment of pain and symptoms at time diagnosis 
and during the oncological treatment, up to the advanced stage of disease when 
they may favour the transition to the best supportive care or palliative care 
only, also indicating the best palliative care service that may fits the 
clinical and social condition of individuals. Large differences in the 
characteristics of such units, including hospital stay and mortality, have been 
evidenced, in some cases resembling those of a traditional hospice. It likely 
that in some countries such units supply the lack of other palliative care 
services.Further studies on APCUs are needed, even on other outcome processes, 
to provide a more precise identification among the palliative care settings, 
which should not interchangeable, but complimentary to offer the full range of 
activities to be activated according to the different needs of the patients.

In this study, we describe the identification of a new gammacarmovirus infecting 
Cucurbita pepo plants showing a range of mosaic, stunting, yellowing, and 
wilting symptoms. The virus had a narrow host range and mostly produced 
chlorotic and necrotic local lesions in the majority of the tested plants. 
However, Nicotiana benthamiana showed systemic symptoms under laboratory 
conditions. Using a combination of Sanger sequencing and rapid amplification of 
cDNA ends (RACE), the complete genome sequence of the virus was determined to be 
4274 nucleotides (nt) in length. Its genome organization is similar to that of 
members of the genus Gammacarmovirus in the family Tombusviridae, consisting of 
five overlapping open reading frames (ORFs) encoding p28, replicase, p7A, p7B, 
and coat protein (CP), respectively. The genome is flanked by short 5' and 3' 
non-coding regions (NCR) at either end. In pairwise comparisons of replicase and 
CP sequences, the virus showed the highest amino acid sequence identity of 
71.55% and 54.86%, respectively, to melon necrotic spot virus (MNSV), the type 
member of the genus Gammacarmovirus. Since the sequence identity values are 
below the species demarcation threshold suggested by the International Committee 
on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV), the virus from Cucurbita pepo plants, for which 
the name "cucurbit carmovirus" (CuCV) is proposed, represents a new species. In 
phylogenetic analysis based on the replicase and CP amino acid sequences, CuCV 
clustered with MNSV but formed a distinct branch, further confirming that the 
virus is a distinct member of the genus Gammacarmovirus.

The quadratic rank transmutation map is used in this article to suggest a novel 
extension of the power inverted Topp-Leone distribution. The newly generated 
distribution is known as the transmuted power inverted Topp-Leone (TPITL) 
distribution. The power inverted Topp-Leone and the inverted Topp-Leone are 
included in the recommended distribution as specific models. Aspects of the 
offered model, including the quantile function, moments and incomplete moments, 
stochastic ordering, and various uncertainty measures, are all discussed. Plans 
for acceptance sampling are created for the TPITL model with the assumption that 
the life test will end at a specific time. The median lifetime of the TPITL 
distribution with the chosen variables is the truncation time. The smallest 
sample size is required to obtain the stated life test under a certain 
consumer's risk. Five conventional estimation techniques, including maximum 
likelihood, least squares, weighted least squares, maximum product of spacing, 
and Cramer-von Mises, are used to assess the characteristics of TPITL 
distribution. A rigorous Monte Carlo simulation study is used to evaluate the 
effectiveness of these estimators. To determine how well the most recent model 
handled data modeling, we tested it on a range of datasets. The simulation 
results demonstrated that, in most cases, the maximum likelihood estimates had 
the smallest mean squared errors among all other estimates. In some cases, the 
Cramer-von Mises estimates performed better than others. Finally, we observed 
that precision measures decrease for all estimation techniques when the sample 
size increases, indicating that all estimation approaches are consistent. 
Through two real data analyses, the suggested model's validity and adaptability 
are contrasted with those of other models, including the power inverted 
Topp-Leone, log-normal, Weibull, generalized exponential, generalized inverse 
exponential, inverse Weibull, inverse gamma, and extended inverse exponential 
distributions.

Fecal Microbiota Transplant in Immunotherapy-Resistant Melanoma: What Can We 
Expect in the Near Future?

Melanoma is a malignancy of melanocytes, melanin-producing cells in the basal 
layer of the epidermis. Despite representing only 1% of skin cancers, melanoma 
is responsible for over 80% of skin cancer deaths. Treatment with immune 
checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) that target the programmed death 1 (PD-1) protein 
and the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) pathways drastically 
transformed the management of patients with advanced melanoma. Before the 
introduction of ICIs, the average life expectancy for a patient with advanced 
melanoma ranged from six to 12 months, and now, this average survival has 
increased to over six years. However, despite this outstanding clinical success, 
most patients with advanced melanoma treated with ICIs will experience disease 
progression, immediately or after an initial response to treatment. Nowadays, 
some studies have looked at the mechanism behind the resistance to 
immunotherapy, with the aim of developing new treatments to overcome it. 
Emerging data suggest that gut microbiota (GM) influences response to 
immunotherapy. Importantly, unlike tumor genomics, the GM is changeable; thus, 
modulation of the GM is an attractive approach to overcome immunotherapy 
resistance. One of these approaches is the fecal microbiota transplant (FMT), 
which consists of the exchange of manipulated feces from a donor to a recipient 
who has a disorder related to intestinal dysbiosis to directly change the 
recipient's gut microbial composition and confer a health benefit. This review 
pretends to discuss the clinical benefit of FMT in the treatment of 
immunotherapy-resistant melanoma and potential adverse effects, including recent 
and ongoing clinical trials.

BACKGROUND: Glioblastoma (GBM) is a devastating form of brain cancer, with a 
short life expectancy. In addition to this poor prognosis, people with GBM often 
experience symptoms that may have a profound impact on their subjective 
well-being (SWB). The aim of this study was to investigate the lived experiences 
and perceptions of people with GBM regarding their SWB.
METHODS: The study adopted a longitudinal, hermeneutical phenomenological 
approach. Twenty-seven interviews were conducted with 15 patients over a period 
of two years. Most participants were interviewed twice on a face-to-face basis 
(during combined chemotherapy and radiotherapy, and again during adjuvant 
chemotherapy). The hermeneutic circle was used to guide data analysis.
RESULTS: Data analysis identified four key themes that depicted the lived 
experiences and perceptions of SWB of people with GBM. "Experience of the 
disease" focuses on the impact of diagnosis, symptoms and side effects. "Daily 
life" relates to daily activities, family roles, work and social lives. "Coping" 
includes the importance of normality and goal-setting. "Experiences of care" 
focuses on the impact of the treatment schedule, experiences of care and 
impressions of the monitoring of QoL.
CONCLUSION: SWB is affected by a variety of factors throughout the GBM disease 
and treatment journey. The findings of this study suggest that healthcare 
professionals can enhance the SWB of people with GBM by providing personalized 
care that supports people to set themselves goals for the future and retain a 
degree of normality wherever possible.

Background Antibiotics significantly increased life expectancy and decreased 
mortality rates due to infections. However, this trend is starting to fade with 
the rise of multidrug-resistant organisms (MDR); these strains are becoming a 
global burden on healthcare and the economy. The dramatic increase and spread of 
carbapenem-resistant gram-negative bacteria (CRGNB) has become a serious global 
public health concern. In this retrospective cross-sectional study, we aimed to 
estimate the rates of gram-negative bacteremia in five tertiary care hospitals 
in different geographical locations in Saudi Arabia for five years. Methods A 
retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted in five tertiary care 
hospitals in Saudi Arabia among patients with bacteremia due to CRGNB. 
Electronic medical records were used to retrieve data regarding patient 
demographics and antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) over five years 
between January 2016 and December 2020. Patients with positive blood cultures 
for carbapenem-resistant Escherichia (E.) coli, Klebsiella (K.) pneumonia, 
Pseudomonas (P.) aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter (A.) baumannii comprise the final 
study population. Results This retrospective multicentric study was conducted 
between 2016 and 2020 in five tertiary care hospitals across five cities in 
Saudi Arabia. E. coli (n=2190, 38.03%), K. pneumoniae (n=2154, 37.41%), P. 
aeruginosa (n = 918, 15.94%), and A. baumannii (n=496, 8.61%) constitute the 
5758 gram-negative bacteria isolates. E. coli was the most frequently identified 
species in Riyadh, AlAhsa, Dammam, and Madinah (40%, 46.50%, 61.67%, and 43.66%, 
respectively), with a p-value of (p<0.001), except in Jeddah, where K. 
pneumoniae was the most prevalent (42%). The mean age of patients across Riyadh, 
AlAhsa, Dammam, and Madinah was 62.2 years (± 4.24). In contrast to Jeddah, 
where the majority of isolates (702; 41.8%) belonged to the adult age group. 
Most isolates were from male patients (3045; 52.9%), compared to 2713 (47.1%) 
from female patients. K. pneumoniae 1226 (40.3%) was the most prevalent isolate 
among male patients while E. coli (1135; 41.8%) was the most prevalent isolate 
among female patients. Conclusion Our study showed that the prevalence of 
carbapenem non-susceptible Gram-negative bacteria is relatively high, which 
therefore makes them very challenging to treat. The results show an urgent need 
for improved antibiotic stewardship strategies, including better surveillance 
and more effective infection control measures to reduce this issue. Further 
research into the molecular epidemiology and risk factors associated with these 
infections is necessary to guide public health policymakers in developing 
interventions to help control the spread of carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative 
bacteria.

Life expectancy has increased exponentially in the last century accompanied by 
disability, poor quality of life, and all-cause mortality in older age due to 
the high prevalence of obesity and physical inactivity in older people. 
Biologically, the aging process reduces the cell's metabolic and functional 
efficiency, and disrupts the cell's anabolic and catabolic homeostasis, 
predisposing older people to many dysfunctional conditions such as 
cardiovascular disease, neurodegenerative disorders, cancer, and diabetes. In 
the immune system, aging also alters cells' metabolic and functional efficiency, 
a process known as 'immunosenescence', where cells become more broadly 
inflammatory and their functionality is altered. Notably, autophagy, the 
conserved and important cellular process that maintains the cell's efficiency 
and functional homeostasis may protect the immune system from age-associated 
dysfunctional changes by regulating cell death in activated CD4+ T cells. This 
regulatory process increases the delivery of the dysfunctional cytoplasmic 
material to lysosomal degradation while increasing cytokine production, 
proliferation, and differentiation of CD4+ T cell-mediated immune responses. 
Poor proliferation and diminished responsiveness to cytokines appear to be 
ubiquitous features of aged T cells and may explain the delayed peak in T cell 
expansion and cytotoxic activity commonly observed in the 'immunosenescence' 
phenotype in the elderly. On the other hand, physical exercise stimulates the 
expression of crucial nutrient sensors and inhibits the mechanistic target of 
the rapamycin (mTOR) signaling cascade which increases autophagic activity in 
cells. Therefore, in this perspective review, we will first contextualize the 
overall view of the autophagy process and then, we will discuss how body 
adiposity and physical fitness may counteract autophagy in naïve CD4+ T cells in 
aging.

AIM: To evaluate the long-term cost-effectiveness of tirzepatide (5, 10 and 
15 mg doses), a novel glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and 
glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist, versus semaglutide 1.0 mg, an 
injectable glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist, based on the results of the 
head-to-head SURPASS-2 trial, from a US healthcare payer perspective.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The PRIME Type 2 Diabetes Model was used to make 
projections of clinical and cost outcomes over a 50-year time horizon. Baseline 
cohort characteristics, treatment effects and adverse event rates were derived 
from the 40-week SURPASS-2 trial. Intensification to insulin therapy occurred 
when HbA1c reached 7.5%, in line with American Diabetes Association 
recommendations. Direct costs in 2021 US dollars (US$) and health state 
utilities were derived from published sources. Future costs and clinical 
benefits were discounted at 3% annually.
RESULTS: All three doses of tirzepatide were associated with lower 
diabetes-related complication rates, improved life expectancy, improved 
quality-adjusted life expectancy and higher direct costs versus semaglutide. 
This resulted in incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of US$ 75 803, 58 908 and 
48 785 per quality-adjusted life year gained for tirzepatide 5, 10 and 15 mg, 
respectively, versus semaglutide. Tirzepatide remained cost-effective versus 
semaglutide over a range of sensitivity analyses.
CONCLUSIONS: Long-term projections based on the SURPASS-2 trial results indicate 
that 5, 10 and 15 mg doses of tirzepatide are likely to be cost-effective versus 
semaglutide 1.0 mg for the treatment of type 2 diabetes in the United States.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of adding 
atezolizumab to first-line chemotherapy for advanced nonsquamous non-small-cell 
lung cancer (NSCLC) from Chinese healthcare system.
METHODS: A partitioned survival model (PSM) was established to simulate 3-week 
patients transition in a 20-year time horizon to estimate the health and 
economic outcomes of adding atezolizumab to first-line chemotherapy for advanced 
nonsquamous NSCLC. Costs and utility values were obtained from the local charges 
and published studies. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to confirm the 
robustness of the model results.
RESULTS: Atezolizumab plus chemotherapy yielded additional 0.36 life years (LYs) 
and 0.23 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and the marginal cost was 
$60,154.48, resulting in an ICER of atezolizumab plus chemotherapy versus 
chemotherapy was $267,264.85/QALY. One-way sensitivity analyses revealed that 
the cost of atezolizumab was the main driver of the model outcomes, and the 
probabilistic sensitivity analyses suggested that atezolizumab plus chemotherapy 
had 0% probability of being cost-effective first-line option at the 
willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of $37,652/QALY in China.
CONCLUSIONS: Atezolizumab plus chemotherapy could not be considered 
cost-effective compared with chemotherapy alone as the first-line strategy for 
patients with advanced nonsquamous NSCLC in China. And appropriately reduce the 
price of atezolizumab is necessary.

The golden spice turmeric with its main bioactive component curcumin is one of 
the most popular and extensively studied nutraceuticals. Despite numerous 
pre-clinical studies reporting positive pharmacodynamics of turmeric extracts 
and curcumin, the main issues in translating the pharmacological effects to 
clinical efficacy have been to overcome its poor pharmacokinetics and to deliver
