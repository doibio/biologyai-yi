OBJECTIVE: To present a long-term policy model of cardiovascular disease (CVD) 
in moderate-to-advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD).
METHODS: A Markov model with transitions between CKD stages (3B, 4, 5, on 
dialysis, with kidney transplant) and cardiovascular events (major 
atherosclerotic events, haemorrhagic stroke, vascular death) was developed with 
individualised CKD and CVD risks estimated using the 5 years' follow-up data of 
the 9270 patients with moderate-to-severe CKD in the Study of Heart and Renal 
Protection (SHARP) and multivariate parametric survival analysis. The model was 
assessed in three further CKD cohorts and compared with currently used risk 
scores.
RESULTS: Higher age, previous cardiovascular events and advanced CKD were the 
main contributors to increased individual disease risks. CKD and CVD risks 
predicted by the state-transition model corresponded well to risks observed in 
SHARP and external cohorts. The model's predictions of vascular risk and 
progression to end-stage renal disease were better than, or comparable to, those 
produced by other risk scores. As an illustration, at age 60-69 years, projected 
survival for SHARP participants in CKD stage 3B was 13.5 years (10.6 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs)) in men and 14.8 years (10.7 QALYs) in 
women. Corresponding projections for participants on dialysis were 7.5 (5.6 
QALYs) and 7.8 years (5.4 QALYs). A non-fatal major atherosclerotic event 
reduced life expectancy by about 2 years in stage 3B and by 1 year in dialysis.
CONCLUSIONS: The SHARP CKD-CVD model is a novel resource for evaluating health 
outcomes and cost-effectiveness of interventions in CKD.

Objective: To analyze the levels and trends of the burden of disease 
attributable to asbestosis from 2006 to 2015. Methods: Theincidence of 
asbestosis from 2006 to 2015 was used for calculation, with data of disability 
weight and remission rate from Global burden of disease study 2015 (GBD 2015) 
and DisMoD-MR 2.1 software for the calculation of duration and age of year 
onset. The reference template of GBD was adopted to calculate disability 
adjusted life year (DALY) , year of life lost (YLL) and year of lived with 
disability (YLD) value in order to analyze the level and changing trend of 
burden of disease attributable to asbestosis. Results: A total YLD attributable 
to asbestosis during 2006 and 2015 in China was 39632. The YLD burden of female 
was more severe than male, which accounted for 20361 in female and 19271 in 
male. In 2015, DALY attributable to asbestosis decreased from 8623.76 in 2006 to 
6436. Among that, in 2015, YLD was 6436 and YLL was 73.76. 2006 had a highest 
level of DALY and 2008 had the lowest level of DALY, which accounted for 8623.76 
in 2006 and 1558 in 2008. DALY during 2008 and 2015 had a fluctuant increase, 
and both male and female had such trend. Conclusion: The level of burden of 
disease attributable to asbestosis is higher in male than in female during 2006 
and 2015. Between 2006 and 2015, burden of disease attributable to asbestosis 
has a fluctuant increase trend.

The phenomenon of aging has gained widespread attention in recent times. 
Although significant advances have been made to better understand aging and its 
related pathologies including cancer, there is not yet a clear mechanism 
explaining why diseases and cancer are inherent parts of the aging process. 
Finding a unifying equation that could bridge aging and its related diseases 
would allow therapeutic development and solve an immense human health problem to 
live longer and better. In this review, we discuss NAD+ reduction as the central 
mechanism that may connect aging to its related pathologies and cancer. NAD+ 
boosters would ensure and ameliorate health quality during aging.

The human body is an open system that receives a variety of xenobiotics in the 
course of dietary route or respiration and in the form of the drugs. As a lump 
sum scores of toxic and potentially toxic substances are detected in a human 
body that significantly affect health and human lifespan. There are also 
thousands of diseases, dozens of which latently occur in the body of each 
person. Traditional diagnosis is not able to screen all the variety of 
xenobiotics and potential human diseases. For this purpose metabolomic blood 
test is available which is of non-targeted (review) nature. The test can reveal 
all the diversity of low molecular weight substances in blood, including tens of 
thousands of xenobiotics and markers of different diseases. Detection of 
xenobiotics in the blood, directional detoxification and subsequent monitoring 
of "body's chemical purity" together with the control of "normality" of all 
biochemical processes in the organism, using metabolomics blood tests is a 
necessary and presumably a sufficient condition in the implementation of 
inherent human genotype longevity. This article describes the purpose, 
implementation and interpretation of metabolomic blood test facilitating the 
implementation of this method in the Russian Federation, in order to 
significantly increase the average life expectancy.

Hospital , Odense, Denmark .

OBJECTIVES: Mental illness is often accompanied by poor physical health and 
shorter life expectancy. Second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) are suspected 
of increasing cardiovascular risk, possibly through development of metabolic 
syndrome (MetS), and the risk of adverse outcome is even higher if obesity or 
metabolic aberration starts in childhood or adolescence.
METHODS: Drug-naive adolescents were recruited after contact with an outpatient 
Psychosis Team. Changes relative to baseline in body mass index (BMI), waist 
circumference (WC), blood pressure (BP), fasting blood glucose (FBG), 
triglycerides (TG), and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol were 
determined through regular follow-ups.
RESULTS: The sample included 35 SGA-naive patients aged 7-19 (mean: 15.5) with a 
diagnosis of psychosis. Over 12 months, the overall rate of MetS changed 
significantly (from 0% to 20% [p < 0.016]). There was a significant increase in 
BMI (18.4% [p < 0.001]), WC (14.3% [p < 0.001]), TG (25.2% [p = 0.039]), and FBG 
(3.6% [p = 0.038]), whereas there was a significant decrease in HDL (-11.5% 
[p < 0.001]). No significant change was found for BP. Compared with the 2014 
Danish references BMI-for-age charts, after 12 months the participants' BMI had 
increased from 0.5 to 1.57 standard deviation (SD) above the 50th percentile for 
age and gender (p = 0.0001).
CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the first study to include all the aspects 
of MetS in a sample of drug-naive adolescents followed over the first 12 months 
after starting SGA treatment. A significant shift in all parameters (except BP) 
toward MetS was found, presumably due to SGA use. Therefore, these adolescents 
will need proper follow-up, consisting of not only monitoring but also 
preventive measures to diminish these effects of SGA use.

PURPOSE: We sought to describe practice patterns, attitudes, and barriers to the 
integration of palliative care services by gynecologic oncologists.
METHODS: Members of the Society of Gynecologic Oncology were electronically 
surveyed regarding their practice of incorporating palliative care services and 
to identify barriers for consultation. Descriptive statistics were used, and 
two-sample z-tests of proportions were performed to compare responses to related 
questions.
RESULTS: Of the 145 respondents, 71% were attending physicians and 58% worked at 
an academic medical center. The vast majority (92%) had palliative care services 
available for consultation at their hospital; 48% thought that palliative care 
services were appropriately used, 51% thought they were underused, and 1% 
thought they were overused. Thirty percent of respondents thought that 
palliative care services should be incorporated at first recurrence, whereas 42% 
thought palliative care should be incorporated when prognosis for life 
expectancy is ≤ 6 months. Most participants (75%) responded that palliative care 
consultation is reasonable for symptom control at any stage of disease. 
Respondents were most likely to consult palliative care services for pain 
control (53%) and other symptoms (63%). Eighty-three percent of respondents 
thought that communicating prognosis is the primary team's responsibility, 
whereas the responsibilities for pain and symptom control, resuscitation status, 
and goals of care discussions were split between the primary team only and both 
teams. The main barrier for consulting palliative care services was the concern 
that patients and families would feel abandoned by the primary oncologist (73%). 
Ninety-seven percent of respondents answered that palliative care services are 
useful to improve patient care.
CONCLUSION: The majority of gynecologic oncologists perceived palliative care as 
a useful collaboration that is underused. Fear of perceived abandonment by the 
patient and family members was identified as a significant barrier to palliative 
care consult.

Regularized Semipaired Kernel CCA for Domain Adaptation.

Mehrkanoon S, Suykens JAK.

Domain adaptation learning is one of the fundamental research topics in pattern 
recognition and machine learning. This paper introduces a regularized semipaired 
kernel canonical correlation analysis formulation for learning a latent space 
for the domain adaptation problem. The optimization problem is formulated in the 
primal-dual least squares support vector machine setting where side information 
can be readily incorporated through regularization terms. The proposed model 
learns a joint representation of the data set across different domains by 
solving a generalized eigenvalue problem or linear system of equations in the 
dual. The approach is naturally equipped with out-of-sample extension property, 
which plays an important role for model selection. Furthermore, the Nyström 
approximation technique is used to make the computational issues due to the 
large size of the matrices involved in the eigendecomposition feasible. The 
learned latent space of the source domain is fed to a multiclass semisupervised 
kernel spectral clustering model that can learn from both labeled and unlabeled 
data points of the source domain in order to classify the data instances of the 
target domain. Experimental results are given to illustrate the effectiveness of 
the proposed approaches on synthetic and real-life data sets.

OBJECTIVE: Acquired dietary habits and lifestyle behaviors of patients with 
schizophrenia may affect their life expectancy, disease complications and 
prognosis. The objectives of the current study were to assess the dietary habits 
and other lifestyle behaviors for Bahraini patients with schizophrenia, and to 
determine their associations with different medical comorbidities.
METHOD: A case-control study was conducted during the period of March to 
December 2016. A sample of 120 cases were recruited from the Psychiatric 
Hospital, Bahrain and age-sex-matched with 120 controls. Controls were recruited 
from primary health centres, and were free from serious mental illness. Dietary 
habits and lifestyle behaviors including smoking, alcohol intake and physical 
activity were assessed using a questionnaire. All medical records were reviewed 
retrospectively. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify dietary and 
lifestyle risk factors that are associated with one or more disease 
comorbidities.
RESULTS: Cases had higher prevalence of smoking and alcohol intake, excessive 
dietary intake, and decreased physical activity (all P<0.05) compared with 
controls. Cases appeared to be at higher risk for developing chronic medical 
conditions such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular 
disease, and musculoskeletal disorders. Cases were three times more likely to 
have up to three or more medical comorbidities compared with controls. Excessive 
dietary intake and decreased physical activity were identified as the main risk 
factors.
CONCLUSION: Excessive caloric intake and decreased physical activity represent 
the main dietary and lifestyle risk factors associated with comorbidities among 
patients with schizophrenia in Bahrain.

Over the last 2 decades, the rate of oophorectomy at the time of hysterectomy in 
the United States has consistently been between 40-50%. A decline in hormone use 
has been observed since the release of the principal results of the Women's 
Health Initiative. Oophorectomy appears to be associated with an increased risk 
of coronary heart disease, as well as deleterious effects on overall mortality, 
cognitive functioning, and sexual functioning. Estrogen deficiency from surgical 
menopause is associated with bone mineral density loss and increased fracture 
risk. While hormone therapy may mitigate these effects, at no age does there 
appear to be a survival benefit associated with oophorectomy. Reduction of 
ovarian cancer risk may be accomplished with salpingectomy at the time of 
hysterectomy.

Hyperbaric storage (HS) of raw watermelon juice, up to 10days at 50, 75, and 
100MPa at variable/uncontrolled room temperature (18-23°C, RT) was studied and 
compared with storage at atmospheric pressure (AP) under refrigeration (4°C, RF) 
and RT, being evaluated microbiological (endogenous and inoculated), 
physicochemical parameters, and enzymatic activities. Ten days of storage at 
50MPa resulted in a microbial growth evolution similar to RF, while at 75/100MPa 
were observed microbial load reductions on endogenous and inoculated 
microorganisms (Escherichia coli and Listeria innocua, whose counts were reduced 
to below the detection limit of 1.00 log CFU/mL), resulting in a shelf-life 
extension compared to RF. The physicochemical parameters remained stable at 
75MPa when compared to the initial raw juice, except for browning degree that 
increased 1.72-fold, whilst at 100MPa were observed higher colour variations, 
attributed to a lycopene content decrease (25%), as well as reductions on 
peroxidase residual activity (16.8%) after 10days, while both polyphenol oxidase 
and pectin methylesterase residual activities were similar to RF. These outcomes 
hint HS as a reliable alternative to RF as a new food preservation methodology, 
allowing energy savings and shelf-life extension of food products. This is the 
first paper studying the effect of HS on inoculated microorganisms and on a 
broad number of physicochemical parameters and on endogenous enzymatic 
activities, for a preservation length surpassing the shelf-life by RF.

We investigated whether drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
through expedited review have offered larger health gains, compared to drugs 
approved through conventional review processes. We identified published 
estimates of additional health gains (measured in quality-adjusted life-years, 
or QALYs) associated with drugs approved in the period 1999-2012 through 
expedited (seventy-six drugs) versus conventional (fifty-nine) review processes. 
We found that drugs in at least one expedited review program offered greater 
gains than drugs reviewed through conventional processes (0.182 versus 0.003 
QALYs). We also found that, compared to drugs not included in the same program, 
greater gains were provided by drugs in the priority review (0.175 versus 0.007 
QALYs), accelerated approval (0.370 versus 0.031 QALYs), and fast track (0.254 
versus 0.014 QALYs) programs. Our analysis suggests that the FDA has prioritized 
drugs that offer the largest health gains.

Appalachia-a region that stretches from Mississippi to New York-has historically 
been recognized as a socially and economically disadvantaged part of the United 
States, and growing evidence suggests that health disparities between it and the 
rest of the country are widening. We compared infant mortality and life 
expectancy disparities in Appalachia to those outside the region during the 
period 1990-2013. We found that infant mortality disparities widened for both 
whites and blacks, with infant mortality 16 percent higher in Appalachia in 
2009-13, and the region's deficit in life expectancy increased from 0.6 years in 
1990-92 to 2.4 years in 2009-13. The association between area poverty and life 
expectancy was stronger in Appalachia than in the rest of the United States. We 
found wide health disparities, including a thirteen-year gap in life expectancy 
among black men in high-poverty areas of Appalachia, compared to white women in 
low-poverty areas elsewhere. Higher mortality in Appalachia from cardiovascular 
diseases, lung cancer, chronic lower respiratory diseases or chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease, diabetes, nephritis or kidney diseases, suicide, 
unintentional injuries, and drug overdose contributed to lower life expectancy 
in the region, compared to the rest of the country. Widening health disparities 
were also due to slower mortality improvements in Appalachia.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Using a discovery/replication approach, we 
investigated associations between a multiplex panel of 80 circulating proteins 
associated with cardiovascular pathology or inflammation, and eGFR decline per 
year and CKD incidence.
DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: We used two cohorts, the 
Prospective Investigation of the Vasculature in Uppsala Seniors Study (PIVUS; 
n=687, mean age of 70 years, 51% women) and the Uppsala Longitudinal Study of 
Adult Men (ULSAM; n=360 men, mean age of 78 years), with 5-year follow-up data 
on eGFR. There were 231 and 206 incident cases of CKD during follow-up in the 
PIVUS and ULSAM studies, respectively. Proteomic profiling of 80 proteins was 
assessed by a multiplex assay (proximity extension assay). The assay uses two 
antibodies for each protein and a PCR step to achieve a high-specific binding 
and the possibility to measure multiple proteins in parallel, but gives no 
absolute concentrations.
RESULTS: In the discovery cohort from the PIVUS Study, 28 plasma proteins were 
significantly associated with eGFR decline per year, taking into account the 
multiple testing. Twenty of these proteins were significantly associated with 
eGFR decline per year in the replication cohort from the ULSAM Study after 
adjustment for age, sex, cardiovascular risk factors, medications, and urinary 
albumin-to-creatinine ratio (in order of significance: TNF-related 
apoptosis-inducing ligand receptor 2*, CD40L receptor, TNF receptor 1*, placenta 
growth factor*, thrombomodulin*, urokinase plasminogen activator surface 
receptor*, growth/differentiation factor 15*, macrophage colony-stimulating 
factor 1, fatty acid-binding protein*, cathepsin D, resistin, kallikrein 11*, 
C-C motif chemokine 3, proteinase-activated receptor 1*, cathepsin L, chitinase 
3-like protein 1, TNF receptor 2*, fibroblast growth factor 23*, monocyte 
chemotactic protein 1, and kallikrein 6). Moreover, 11 of the proteins predicted 
CKD incidence (marked with * above). No protein consistently predicted eGFR 
decline per year independently of baseline eGFR in both cohorts.
CONCLUSIONS: Several circulating proteins involved in phosphate homeostasis, 
inflammation, apoptosis, extracellular matrix remodeling, angiogenesis, and 
endothelial dysfunction were associated with worsening kidney function. 
Multiplex proteomics appears to be a promising way of discovering novel aspects 
of kidney disease pathology.

The NCCN Guidelines for Palliative Care provide interdisciplinary 
recommendations on palliative care for patients with cancer. These NCCN 
Guidelines Insights summarize and provide context for the updated guidelines 
recommendations regarding hospice and end-of-life (EOL) care. Updates for 2017 
include revisions to and restructuring of the algorithms that address important 
EOL concerns. These recommendations were revised to provide clearer guidance for 
oncologists as they care for patients with cancer who are approaching the 
transition to EOL care. Recommendations for interventions and reassessment based 
on estimated life expectancy were streamlined and reprioritized to promote 
hospice referrals and improved EOL care.

Cancer.

Background: After completing 5 years of adjuvant tamoxifen, women with estrogen 
receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer benefit from 5 more years of endocrine 
therapy, either with tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor (AI). For premenopausal 
women, ovarian ablation (OA) would be required before starting an AI (OA/AI). 
According to the SOFT/TEXT studies, OA/AI improves 5-year disease-free survival 
compared with tamoxifen alone, suggesting that OA/AI could be superior to 
tamoxifen as extended endocrine therapy. The long-term costs and consequences of 
premature menopause from OA are unknown, but could be estimated through a 
cost-effectiveness analysis. Methods: A Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation 
model estimated the costs and benefits of 3 extended endocrine strategies in a 
hypothetical cohort of premenopausal women with ER-positive early breast cancer: 
(1) no further treatment; (2) tamoxifen for 5 years (extended tamoxifen); or (3) 
OA/AI for 5 years. Effectiveness was measured in years of life expectancy gain. 
Sensitivity analyses accounted for uncertainty surrounding various parameters. 
Monte Carlo simulation estimated the number of adverse events and deaths from 
each strategy in the US population over a 40-year period. Results: Extended 
tamoxifen yielded a higher average life expectancy gain than OA/AI (17.31 vs 
17.06 years) at lower average cost ($3,550 vs $14,312). For 18,000 premenopausal 
ER-positive women, the simulation estimated 13,236, 12,557, and 11,338 deaths 
with no further treatment, extended tamoxifen, and OA/AI, respectively, but an 
additional 1,897 deaths from OA, for a total of 13,235 deaths associated with 
OA/AI. After 24.6 years of follow-up, more women are expected to die from OA/AI 
than extended tamoxifen. Conclusions: For premenopausal women with ER-positive 
cancer who have completed adjuvant tamoxifen, another 5 years of tamoxifen is 
the preferable extended endocrine strategy. The potential long-term health 
consequences of OA could affect overall survival when it precedes the use of an 
AI.

Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome (VHL) is a familial neoplastic condition seen in 
approximately 1 in 36,000 live births. It is caused by germline mutations of the 
tumor suppressor gene VHL, located on the short arm of chromosome 3. While the 
majority of the affected individuals have a positive family history, up to 20% 
of cases arise from de novo mutations. VHL syndrome is characterized by the 
presence of benign and malignant tumors affecting the central nervous system, 
kidneys, adrenals, pancreas, and reproductive organs. Common manifestations 
include hemangioblastomas of the brain, spinal cord, and retina; 
pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma; renal cell carcinoma; pancreatic cysts and 
neuroendocrine tumors; and endolymphatic sac tumors. Diagnosis of VHL is 
prompted by clinical suspicion and confirmed by molecular testing. Management of 
VHL patients is complex and multidisciplinary. Routine genetic testing and 
surveillance using various diagnostic techniques are used to help monitor 
disease progression and implement treatment options. Despite recent advances in 
clinical diagnosis and management, life expectancy for VHL patients remains low 
at 40-52 years. This article provides an overview of the major clinical, 
histological, and radiological findings, as well as treatment modalities.

Should all dialysis patients with hepatitis C be treated? If so, before or after 
kidney transplantation?

HCV infection by genotype 1 and 4 can now be cured in close to 100% of patients 
with stage 4 or 5 CKD, including dialysis patients. Several regimens are 
available, all interferon-free and given for only 12 weeks. Thus unless life 
expectancy is short, HCV infection should be treated. The optimal timing of 
antiviral treatment will be dependent on several parameters: the possibility of 
being transplanted rapidly (either with a HCV+ graft or from a living donor) 
calls for treatment after transplantation. On the contrary, severe liver 
fibrosis, especially with portal hypertension calls for immediate treatment of 
HCV. Finally specific HCV genotype also impacts the treatment decision as 
genotypes 2,3,5 and 6 currently can be treated more easily after restoration of 
kidney function rather than in the presence of severe CKD, although this is 
anticipated to change soon once newer pangenotypic regimens are licensed.

Alabama, USA.

As life expectancy continues to rise worldwide, health concerns associated with 
advanced age are increasingly becoming prominent public health concerns. Among 
these concerns, nearly 30 years of discussion and research have yielded a wealth 
of information regarding the pathophysiology, biologic etiology, and clinical 
implications of age-related declines in skeletal muscle mass and function (i.e., 
sarcopenia). Recent years have yielded several debates surrounding both the 
definition and terminology of sarcopenia, yet many questions remain regarding 
interventions to treat the condition. Among major future challenges in the area 
will be to design and conduct high-quality clinical trials to ultimately provide 
new therapeutic strategies for the treatment of sarcopenia.

BACKGROUND: Ensuring adequate end-of-life care for prisoners is a critical 
issue. In France, data investigating the impact of laws allowing release of 
seriously ill prisoners are lacking.
AIM: To assess the number and characteristics of prisoners requiring palliative 
care in French prisons.
DESIGN: A prospective, national survey collecting data over a 3-month period.
SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: All healthcare units ( n = 190) providing care for 
prisoners in France. The prison population was 66,698 during the study period. 
Data collection concerned prisoners requiring end-of-life care, that is, with 
serious, advanced, progressive, or terminal illness and life expectancy <1 year.
RESULTS: Estimated annual prevalence of ill prisoners requiring end-of-life care 
was 15.2 (confidence interval: 12.5-18.3) per 10,000 prisoners. The observed 
number of prisoners requiring palliative care ( n = 50) was twice as high as the 
expected age- and sex-standardized number based on the general population and 
similar to the expected number among persons 10 years older in the free 
community. In all, 41 of 44 (93%) of identified ill prisoners were eligible for 
temporary or permanent compassionate release, according to their practitioner. 
Only 33 of 48 (68%) of ill prisoners requested suspension or reduction in their 
sentence on medical grounds; half (16/33) received a positive answer.
CONCLUSION: The proportion of prisoners requiring palliative care is higher than 
expected in the general population. The general frailty and co-existing 
conditions of prisoners before incarceration and the acceleration of these 
phenomena in prison could explain this increase in end-of-life situations among 
prisoners.

Lysosomal acid lipase deficiency is a rare, autosomal recessive condition caused 
by mutations in the gene encoding lysosomal acid lipase (LIPA) that result in 
reduced or absent activity of this essential enzyme. The severity of the 
resulting disease depends on the nature of the underlying mutation and magnitude 
of its effect on enzymatic function. Wolman's disease is a severe disorder that 
presents during infancy, resulting in failure to thrive, hepatomegaly, and 
hepatic failure, and an average life expectancy of less than 4 months. 
Cholesteryl ester storage disorder arises later in life and is less severe, 
although the two diseases share many common features, including dyslipidaemia 
and transaminitis. The prevalence of these diseases has been estimated at one in 
40 000 to 300 000, but many cases are undiagnosed and unreported, and awareness 
among clinicians is low. Lysosomal acid lipase deficiency-which can be diagnosed 
using dry blood spot testing-is often misdiagnosed as non-alcoholic fatty liver 
disease (NAFLD), non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), hereditary dyslipidaemia, 
or cryptogenic cirrhosis. There are no formal guidelines for treatment of these 
patients, and treatment options are limited. In this Review we appraise the 
existing literature on Wolman's disease and cholesteryl ester storage disease, 
and discuss available treatments, including enzyme replacement therapy, oral 
lipid-lowering therapy, stem-cell transplantation, and liver transplantation.

BACKGROUND: Schizophrenia is a complex medical entity with a reduced life 
expectancy, mostly due to an increased prevalence of cardiovascular diseases 
compared to the general population. An unbalanced immune response and a 
pro-inflammatory state might underlie this process. In treated patients, 
abnormal white blood cell (WBC), lymphocyte and neutrophil count suggests 
atypical immune response related to clinical variables. We aimed to test the 
hypothesis that newly diagnosed naïve patients with non-affective psychosis 
would show abnormal blood cell count values after controlling for potential 
confounding factors compared to matched controls.
METHODS: Seventy-five patients were compared with 80 controls matched for age, 
gender, body mass index and smoking. Analyses were conducted before and after 
controlling for smoking.
RESULTS: Patients and controls displayed similar mean values (×103 /μL [SD]) for 
WBC count 7.02 [2.2] vs 6.50 [1.7] (P = .159), neutrophil count 4.25 [1.8] vs 
3.84 [1.3] (P = .110) and monocyte count 0.43 [0.2] vs 0.40 [0.1] (P = .326). 
After controlling for smoking, 38 non-smoking patients showed a higher WBC and 
neutrophil count compared with 49 matched controls. Respective means of 7.01 
[2.2] vs 5.97 [1.4] (P = .011) for WBC and 4.24 [1.9] vs 3.51 [1.2] (P = .028) 
for neutrophil count. Monocyte count showed an increased mean value 0.43 [0.2] 
vs 0.36 [0.1] with a trend towards signification (P = .063).
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that abnormal immune response is present 
before the effects of medication and other confounders had taken place. 
Increased immune parameters might underlie the high ratio of medical 
co-morbidities described in schizophrenia.

Happier countries, longer lives: an ecological study on the relationship between 
subjective sense of well-being and life expectancy.

Evans GF(1), Soliman EZ(1).

Author information:

Winston-Salem, NC, USA.

The relationship between sense of well-being and longevity is not 
well-established across populations of varying levels of socioeconomic status. 
We sought to examine the relationship between happiness, or subjective sense of 
well-being and life expectancy using data from 151 countries. This analysis is 
based on the 2012 Happy Planet Index project conducted by the Center of 
Well-Being of the New Economics Foundation, based in the United Kingdom. 
Well-being data for each country were taken from responses to the 'Ladder of 
Life' question in the 2012 Gallup World Poll in which participants were asked to 
rate their quality of life on a scale from 1 (worst possible life) to 10 (best 
possible life). Life expectancy and gross domestic product data were taken from 
the 2011 United Nations records. Ecological footprint data were taken from 
Global Footprint Network records. Subjective sense of well-being was highly 
correlated with life expectancy (Pearson correlation r = 0.71, p < 0.0001). In a 
multivariable linear regression model adjusted for gross domestic product, 
ecological footprint, and population, each 1 unit of the well-being scale was 
associated with an increase in life expectancy of 4.0 years (95% confidence 
interval = 2.7-5.3). In conclusion, better sense of well-being has a strong 
relationship with life expectancy regardless of economic status or population 
size, suggesting that governments should foster happiness in order to support 
long-living populations.

During epithelial tube morphogenesis, linear arrays of cells are converted into 
tubular structures through actomyosin-generated intracellular forces that induce 
tissue invagination and lumen formation. We have investigated lumen 
morphogenesis in the C. elegans vulva. The first discernible event initiating 
lumen formation is the apical constriction of the two innermost primary cells
