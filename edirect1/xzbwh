PURPOSE: The VisQoL instrument was constructed as a vision-specific addition to 
the AQoL-6D multi-attribute utility instrument. The composite instrument, the 
AQoL-7D, was assigned utility scores that are the basis for now estimating 
VisQoL utilities when it is used as a stand-alone instrument. This study aimed 
to construct mapping functions that allow utility scores to be assigned to the 
Vision Related Quality of Life (VisQoL) instrument, a stand-alone 
vision-specific quality-of-life measure.
METHODS: A sample of 164 patients completed the AQoL-7D, which includes the 
VisQoL. Mapping algorithms between VisQoL and AQoL-7D were then derived using 
two econometric methods, ordinary least squares estimator and generalized linear 
model (GLM). Two model specifications were considered with either six VisQoL raw 
item values or VisQoL overall dimension value as the key independent variables. 
The predictive performance of each method on each model specification was 
assessed using the mean absolute error (MAE) and intraclass correlation 
coefficient (ICC). Both internal and external validation tests (using a second, 
independent sample of 164 patients) were performed.
RESULTS: The mapping algorithms derived from the GLM had superior properties to 
the ordinary least squares-based algorithms in both internal and external 
validation tests. The ICC values ranged from 0.851 to 0.913, and the MAE ranged 
from 0.043 to 0.052 for two model specifications, based on two econometric 
methods. However, predicted utilities tend to over-predict/under-predict the 
lowest/highest observed utility.
CONCLUSIONS: Mapping algorithms predicting AQoL-7D utility based on six VisQoL 
items or VisQoL dimension value have been developed. The algorithm can be used 
to estimate quality adjusted life years. This allows the VisQoL to be used in 
cost utility analyses.

Moxifloxacin (MOX) is a Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA gyrase inhibitor. Due to 
its intense hydrophilicity, MOX is cleared from the body within 24 h and 
required for repetitive doses which may then result in hepatotoxicity and 
acquisition of MOX resistant-TB, related with its use. To overcome the 
aforementioned limitations, the current study aimed to develop PLGA 
nanoparticles (PLGA NPs), to act as an efficient carrier for controlled delivery 
of MOX. To achieve a substantial extension in blood circulation, a combined 
design, affixation of polyethylene glycol (PEG) to MOX-PLGA NPs and adsorption 
of water-soluble chitosan (WSC) (cationic deacetylated chitin) to particle 
surface, was rose for surface modification of NPs. Surface modified NPs 
(MOX-PEG-WSC NPs) were prepared to provide controlled delivery and circulate in 
the bloodstream for an extended period of time, thus minimizing dosing 
frequency. In vivo pharmacokinetic and in vivo biodistribution following oral 
administration were investigated. NP surface charge was closed to neutral 
+4.76 mV and significantly affected by the WSC coating. MOX-PEG-WSC NPs 
presented striking prolongation in blood circulation, reduced protein binding, 
and long-drawn-out the blood circulation half-life with resultant reduced liver 
sequestration vis-à-vis MOX-PLGA NPs. The studies, therefore, indicate the 
successful formulation development of MOX-PEG-WSC NPs that showed sustained 
release behavior from nanoparticles which indicates low frequency of dosing.

PURPOSE: Hypopituitary patients have a reduced life expectancy owing to 
cardiovascular events. We investigated the prevalence of metabolic syndrome in 
hypopituitary patients for a follow-up period of at least 1 year in comparison 
with an age- and sex-matched nationwide control group.
METHODS: A total of 515 patients with hypopituitarism who visited Seoul National 
University Hospital between January 2000 and December 2010 were included. Data 
for an age- and sex-matched control group were obtained from the Korean National 
Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (KNHANES) (n = 1545). Metabolic 
syndrome was defined according to the modified National Cholesterol Education 
Program (NCEP-ATPIII).
RESULTS: The prevalence of metabolic syndrome did not differ significantly 
between the hypopituitary and control groups for men (34.9 versus 30.3 %), but 
the risk of metabolic syndrome was higher in hypopituitary women than in 
controls (39.8 versus 28.5 %). In both sexes, the risks of central obesity and 
dyslipidemia were higher in the hypopituitary group than in the control group. 
Men had lower risks of hypertension and hyperglycemia in the hypopituitary 
group, which attenuated the risk of metabolic syndrome. Age greater than 
40 years and obesity (BMI ≥25 kg/m2) contributed to a higher risk of metabolic 
syndrome.
CONCLUSIONS: The metabolic syndrome prevalence was higher in the hypopituitry 
group than in the control group in Korean women, and this was attributed to an 
increased risk of central obesity and dyslipidemia. Accordingly, early 
intervention to reduce metabolic syndrome needed in hypopituitary patients, i.e. 
women.

In a period of generalized economic crisis, it seems particularly appropriate to 
try to manage a continuing growing sector such as healthcare in the best 
possible way. The crucial aim of optimization of available healthcare resources 
is obtaining the maximum possible benefit with the minimum expenditure. This has 
important social implications, whether individual citizens or tax-funded 
national health services eventually have to pay the bill. The keyword here is 
efficiency, which means either, maximizing the benefit from a fixed sum of 
money, or minimizing the resources required for a defined benefit. In order to 
achieve these objectives, economic evaluation is a helpful tool. Five different 
types of economic evaluation exist in the health-care field: cost-minimization, 
cost-benefit, cost-consequences, cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analysis. 
The objective of this narrative review is to provide an overview of the 
principal methods used for economic evaluation in healthcare. Economic 
evaluation represents a starting point for the allocation of resources, the 
decision of the valuable investments and the division of budgets across 
different health programs. Moreover, economic evaluation allows the comparison 
of different procedures in terms of quality of life and life expectancy, bearing 
in mind that cost-effectiveness is only one of multiple facets in the decision 
making-process. Economic evaluation is important to critically evaluate clinical 
interventions and ensure that we are implementing the most cost-effective 
management protocols. Clinicians are called to fulfill the complex task of 
optimizing the use of resources, and, at the same time, improving the quality of 
healthcare assistance.

BACKGROUND: Adalimumab is effective in the treatment of Crohn's disease. We have 
already reported data on the efficacy of adalimumab in 110 steroid-dependent 
patients. At the end of the study 90 patients (64.5%) maintained clinical 
remission.
AIMS: To assess efficacy and safety of adalimumab after 6 years in patients of 
the original cohort who responded to treatment.
METHODS: The present study is an extension of the published paper on 90/110 
patients. We report results on clinical remission and safety of 6 year 
maintenance therapy with adalimumab.
RESULTS: Of the original cohort 90 patients completed the study, 17 were lost to 
follow-up and 3 died. At the end of follow-up (74.16±10.3 months) 37/90 patients 
(41%) maintained clinical remission. Of these, 32 (86%) continued adalimumab and 
5 (13%) discontinued treatment due to clinical remission and mucosal healing. Of 
the remaining 53/90 patients, 47 (52%) discontinued adalimumab due to clinical 
failure and 6 (7%) to adverse events. We obtained endoscopy data in 31/32 
patients in clinical remission continuing adalimumab: 11 (36%) did not improve, 
6 (19%) worsened, 14 (45%) improved. At univariable analysis no variables were 
related to treatment outcome.
CONCLUSIONS: This "real life" prospective study shows that adalimumab is a 
long-term effective and safe maintenance treatment in steroid-dependent Crohn's 
disease patients.

OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: Endoscopic management of bilateral vocal fold paralysis 
(BVFP) includes cordotomy and arytenoidectomy, and has become a well-accepted 
alternative to tracheostomy. However, the costs and quality-of-life benefits of 
endoscopic management have not been examined with formal economic analysis. This 
study undertakes a cost-effectiveness analysis of tracheostomy versus endoscopic 
management of BVFP.
STUDY DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis.
METHODS: A literature review identified a range of costs and outcomes associated 
with surgical options for BVFP. Additional costs were derived from Medicare 
reimbursement data; all were adjusted to 2014 dollars. Cost-effectiveness 
analysis evaluated both therapeutic strategies in short-term and long-term 
scenarios. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was used to assess confidence 
levels regarding the economic evaluation.
RESULTS: The incremental cost effectiveness ratio for endoscopic management 
versus tracheostomy is $31,600.06 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY), 
indicating that endoscopic management is the cost-effective short-term strategy 
at a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of $50,000/QALY. The probability that 
endoscopic management is more cost-effective than tracheostomy at this WTP is 
65.1%. Threshold analysis demonstrated that the model is sensitive to both 
utilities and cost in the short-term scenario. When costs of long-term care are 
included, tracheostomy is dominated by endoscopic management, indicating the 
cost-effectiveness of endoscopic management at any WTP.
CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic management of BVFP appears to be more cost-effective 
than tracheostomy. Though endoscopic cordotomy and arytenoidectomy require 
expertise and specialized equipment, this model demonstrates utility gains and 
long-term cost advantages to an endoscopic strategy. These findings are limited 
by the relative paucity of robust utility data and emphasize the need for 
further economic analysis in otolaryngology.

OBJECTIVES: Life expectancy is an important indicator informing decision making 
in policies relating to HIV-infected people. Studies estimating life expectancy 
after starting combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) have noted differences 
between income regions. The objective of our study was to perform a 
meta-analysis to assess life expectancy of HIV-positive people after starting 
cART, and to quantify differences between low/middle- and high-income countries.
METHODS: Eight cohort studies estimating life expectancy in HIV-positive people 
initiating cART aged ≥ 14 years using the abridged life table method were 
identified. Random effects meta-analysis was used to pool estimated outcomes, 
overall and by income region. Heterogeneity between studies was assessed with 
the I2 statistic. We estimated additional years of life expected after starting 
cART at ages 20 and 35 years.
RESULTS: Overall life expectancy in high-income countries was an additional 43.3 
years [95% confidence interval (CI) 42.5-44.2 years] and 32.2 years (95% CI 
30.9-33.5 years) at ages 20 and 35 years, respectively, and 28.3 (95% CI 
23.3-33.3) and 25.6 (95% CI 22.1-29.2) additional years, respectively, in 
low/middle-income countries. In low/middle-income countries, life expectancy 
after starting cART at age 20 years was an additional 22.9 years (95% CI 
18.4-27.5 years) for men and 33.0 years (95% CI 30.4-35.6 years) for women, but 
was similar in the two sexes in high-income countries. In all income regions, 
life expectancy after starting cART increased over calendar time.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the life expectancy of HIV-positive people 
after starting cART has improved over time. Monitoring life expectancy into the 
future is important to assess how changes to cART guidelines will affect patient 
long-term outcomes.

BACKGROUND: End-stage renal disease is a long-term irreversible decline in 
kidney function requiring renal replacement therapy: kidney transplantation, 
haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. The preferred option is kidney 
transplantation, followed by immunosuppressive therapy (induction and 
maintenance therapy) to reduce the risk of kidney rejection and prolong graft 
survival.
OBJECTIVES: To review and update the evidence for the clinical effectiveness and 
cost-effectiveness of basiliximab (BAS) (Simulect(®), Novartis Pharmaceuticals 
UK Ltd) and rabbit anti-human thymocyte immunoglobulin (rATG) (Thymoglobulin(®), 
Sanofi) as induction therapy, and immediate-release tacrolimus (TAC) 
(Adoport(®), Sandoz; Capexion(®), Mylan; Modigraf(®), Astellas Pharma; 
Perixis(®), Accord Healthcare; Prograf(®), Astellas Pharma; Tacni(®), Teva; 
Vivadex(®), Dexcel Pharma), prolonged-release tacrolimus (Advagraf(®) Astellas 
Pharma), belatacept (BEL) (Nulojix(®), Bristol-Myers Squibb), mycophenolate 
mofetil (MMF) (Arzip(®), Zentiva; CellCept(®), Roche Products; Myfenax(®), 
Teva), mycophenolate sodium (MPS) (Myfortic(®), Novartis Pharmaceuticals UK 
Ltd), sirolimus (SRL) (Rapamune(®), Pfizer) and everolimus (EVL) (Certican(®), 
Novartis) as maintenance therapy in adult renal transplantation.
METHODS: Clinical effectiveness searches were conducted until 18 November 2014 
in MEDLINE (via Ovid), EMBASE (via Ovid), Cochrane Central Register of 
Controlled Trials (via Wiley Online Library) and Web of Science (via ISI), 
Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of 
Effects and Health Technology Assessment (The Cochrane Library via Wiley Online 
Library) and Health Management Information Consortium (via Ovid). 
Cost-effectiveness searches were conducted until 18 November 2014 using a costs 
or economic literature search filter in MEDLINE (via Ovid), EMBASE (via Ovid), 
NHS Economic Evaluation Database (via Wiley Online Library), Web of Science (via 
ISI), Health Economic Evaluations Database (via Wiley Online Library) and the 
American Economic Association's electronic bibliography (via EconLit, 
EBSCOhost). Included studies were selected according to predefined methods and 
criteria. A random-effects model was used to analyse clinical effectiveness data 
(odds ratios for binary data and mean differences for continuous data). Network 
meta-analyses were undertaken within a Bayesian framework. A new discrete 
time-state transition economic model (semi-Markov) was developed, with acute 
rejection, graft function (GRF) and new-onset diabetes mellitus used to 
extrapolate graft survival. Recipients were assumed to be in one of three health 
states: functioning graft, graft loss or death.
RESULTS: Eighty-nine randomised controlled trials (RCTs), of variable quality, 
were included. For induction therapy, no treatment appeared more effective than 
another in reducing graft loss or mortality. Compared with placebo/no induction, 
rATG and BAS appeared more effective in reducing biopsy-proven acute rejection 
(BPAR) and BAS appeared more effective at improving GRF. For maintenance 
therapy, no treatment was better for all outcomes and no treatment appeared most 
effective at reducing graft loss. BEL + MMF appeared more effective than 
TAC + MMF and SRL + MMF at reducing mortality. MMF + CSA (ciclosporin), 
TAC + MMF, SRL + TAC, TAC + AZA (azathioprine) and EVL + CSA appeared more 
effective than CSA + AZA and EVL + MPS at reducing BPAR. SRL + AZA, TAC + AZA, 
TAC + MMF and BEL + MMF appeared to improve GRF compared with CSA + AZA and 
MMF + CSA. In the base-case deterministic and probabilistic analyses, BAS, MMF 
and TAC were predicted to be cost-effective at £20,000 and £30,000 per 
quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). When comparing all regimens, only 
BAS + TAC + MMF was cost-effective at £20,000 and £30,000 per QALY.
LIMITATIONS: For included trials, there was substantial methodological 
heterogeneity, few trials reported follow-up beyond 1 year, and there were 
insufficient data to perform subgroup analysis. Treatment discontinuation and 
switching were not modelled.
FUTURE WORK: High-quality, better-reported, longer-term RCTs are needed. 
Ideally, these would be sufficiently powered for subgroup analysis and include 
health-related quality of life as an outcome.
CONCLUSION: Only a regimen of BAS induction followed by maintenance with TAC and 
MMF is likely to be cost-effective at £20,000-30,000 per QALY.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We aimed to examine the incidence of cognitive 
impairment among patients with stroke, the associated risk factors, progression 
of the cognitive impairment, and the association between the localization of the 
lesion(s) as detected by magnetic resonance imaging and the affected areas of 
cognitive function.
METHODS: A total of 40 patients over 18 years of age enduring a transient 
ischemic stroke or minor stroke within the past 3 months who had a minimum life 
expectancy of 1 year were included in this study. Same number, age-, and 
sex-matched individuals were included as controls. Patients were inquired on the 
presence of risk factors for stroke. A series of neuropsychological test 
batteries were administered in patient and control subjects for assessing 
cognitive functions. These tests were readministered at 6 and 12 months of 
follow-up to assess the progression of cognitive functions.
RESULTS: In this study among the patients with stroke, a significant impairment 
was seen in multiple cognitive functional tests following ischemic stroke as 
compared to control groups. The most common risk factors for stroke included 
hypertension (72.5%), hyperlipidemia, and cigarette smoking. The number of 
cognitive domains with an impairment was highest (in four cognitive tests) among 
those with coronary artery disease and atrial fibrillation, followed by those 
who had a >50% stenosis in Doppler (three cognitive tests). These findings 
suggest that the frequency of risk factors associated with stroke does not 
correlate with the frequency of risk factors associated with cognitive 
dysfunction. The stroke localizations were classified among the patients with 
stroke and reviewed in accordance with cognitive impairment.
CONCLUSION: Neuropsychological tests, clinical findings, and imaging studies 
should be used to document the poststroke cognitive dysfunction.

This study involves the adoption of the Geographic Information System (GIS) 
modeling approach to determine the quickest routes for fresh vegetable delivery. 
During transport, fresh vegetables mainly deteriorate on account of temperature 
and delivery time. Nonetheless, little attention has been directed to 
transportation issues in most areas within Kuala Lumpur. In addition, perishable 
food normally has a short shelf life, thus timely delivery significantly affects 
delivery costs. Therefore, selecting efficient routes would consequently reduce 
the total transportation costs. The regression model is applied in this study to 
determine the parameters that affect route selection with respect to the fastest 
delivery of fresh vegetables. For the purpose of this research, ArcGIS software 
with network analyst extension is adopted to solve the problem of complex 
networks. The final output of this research is a map of quickest routes with the 
best delivery times based on all variables. The variables tested from regression 
analysis are the most effective parameters to make the flow of road networks 
slower. The objective is to improve the delivery services by achieving the least 
drive time. The main findings of this research are that Land use such as 
residential area and population as variables are the effective parameters on 
drive time.

Osteoarthritis (OA) is a prevalent chronic disease impacting on quality of life 
and has societal and economical burden increasing with age. Yet, no confirmed 
pharmacological, biological or surgical therapy could prevent the progressive 
destruction of OA joint. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) with immunosuppressive 
activities emerged a potential therapy. We describe a magnetic resonance images 
(MRI) approved 47 years old nomad female suffering from a severe right knee OA. 
After intra-articular injection of 36×10(6) passage 2 of bone marrow-derived 
stem cells (BMSCs), the patient's functional status of the knee, the number of 
stairs she could climb, the pain on visual analog scale (VAS) and walking 
distance improved after two months post-transplantation. MRI revealed an 
extension of the repaired tissue over subchondral bone. So as MSC 
transplantation is a simple technique, resulted into pain relief, minimized 
donor-site morbidity, provided a better quality of life, significantly improved 
cartilage quality with no need to hospitalization or surgery, cell 
transplantation can be considered as a reliable alternative treatment for 
chronic knee OA. Therefore these findings can be added to the literature on 
using BMSCs for treatment of OA.

OBJECTIVE: To ascertain the actions and partnerships that make up the 
psychosocial care network for children and adolescents assisted at the CAPSi.
METHOD: Qualitative research conducted with twenty-six workers of the 
intersectoral network of São Lourenço do Sul/RS, Brazil through semi-structured 
interviews, from May to June in 2014. The data were analysed using the operative 
proposal of Minayo.
RESULTS: Data analysis led to the identification of three categories: 
Cross-section arrangements: connections for the realisation of care; Joint 
strategies in everyday life; and The territory as an extension of care.
CONCLUSION: Mental care actions coordinated with the healthcare services and 
other sectors of the intersectoral network increase the possibility of meeting 
the needs of children and adolescents.

Erythropoietin is a potent stimulator of erythroid progenitor cells, which is 
able to inhibit NF-kB activation, due to its pleiotropic properties, thus 
promoting an anti-inflammatory effect. As inflammatory bowel disease is a 
chronic disease with reduced quality of life, and the current pharmacotherapy 
only induces or maintains the patient in remission, there is a crucial need of 
new pharmacological approaches. The main objective of this study was to evaluate 
the effect of erythropoietin in the TNBS-induced colitis model in mice with a 
normal intestinal flora. Mice with TNBS-induced colitis were treated with a 
daily dose of erythropoietin at 500 IU/kg bw/day and 1000 IU/Kg bw/day IP during 
4 days. As to clinical symptoms/signs, erythropoietin attenuated the decreased 
body-weight and reduced diarrhoea and oedema of the anus registered in the 
non-treated mice group in a dose-dependent manner. The anti-inflammatory 
properties of erythropoietin in the TNBS-induced colitis were confirmed by 
suppression of pro-inflammatory mediators, such as TNF-α, IL-1β and MPO, as well 
as a significant increase in the anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-10, was 
promoted. These treated mice also presented a reduction in haemoglobin faecal 
and ALP, suggesting a beneficial effect of erythropoietin in the haemorrhagic 
focus and destruction of the enterocyte associated with the colon injury induced 
by TNBS, respectively. The histopathological score was reduced after treatment 
with erythropoietin, decreasing the severity and extension of the colitis. 
Furthermore, renal and hepatic biomarkers, as well as haematocrit concentration, 
remained stabilized after treatment. In conclusion, erythropoietin reduces the 
inflammatory response associated with TNBS-induced colitis in mice.

In the last decade strong empirical evidence from several long-term studies 
supports the conclusion that physical and sexual abuse as well as emotional 
deprivation in childhood make people significantly more vulnerable to mental and 
functional disorders across their lifetime. Additionally, an increased 
vulnerability to several somatic disorders (cardiovascular disorders, 
type-2-diabetes, hepatitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), 
immunological and pain disorders, pharynx and lung cancer) was demonstrated - 
most of them with a reduced life expectancy. A review of the current research 
will be presented that outlines the underlying developmental neurobiological and 
psychological mechanisms mediating these long-term effects. There is now 
sufficient evidence about familial risk constellations that demonstrates the 
well-documented impact of specific prevention strategies by several model 
projects. Only by establishing these strategies, future enormous health-related 
burdens and high economic costs (unfitness to work, early retirement) can 
presumably be limited.

BACKGROUND: Cochrane reviews of physiotherapy (PT) and occupational therapy (OT) 
for Parkinson's disease found insufficient evidence of effectiveness, but 
previous trials were methodologically flawed with small sample size and 
short-term follow-up.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of 
individualised PT and OT in Parkinson's disease.
DESIGN: Large pragmatic randomised controlled trial.
SETTING: Thirty-eight neurology and geriatric medicine outpatient clinics in the 
UK.
PARTICIPANTS: Seven hundred and sixty-two patients with mild to moderate 
Parkinson's disease reporting limitations in activities of daily living (ADL).
INTERVENTION: Patients were randomised online to either both PT and OT NHS 
services (n = 381) or no therapy (n = 381). Therapy incorporated a 
patient-centred approach with individual assessment and goal setting.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was instrumental ADL measured by the 
patient-completed Nottingham Extended Activities of Daily Living (NEADL) scale 
at 3 months after randomisation. Secondary outcomes were health-related quality 
of life [Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire-39 (PDQ-39); European Quality of 
Life-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D)], adverse events, resource use and carer quality of 
life (Short Form questionnaire-12 items). Outcomes were assessed before 
randomisation and at 3, 9 and 15 months after randomisation.
RESULTS: Data from 92% of the participants in each group were available at the 
primary time point of 3 months, but there was no difference in NEADL total score 
[difference 0.5 points, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.7 to 1.7; p = 0.4] or 
PDQ-39 summary index (0.007 points, 95% CI -1.5 to 1.5; p = 1.0) between groups. 
The EQ-5D quotient was of borderline significance in favour of therapy (-0.03, 
95% CI -0.07 to -0.002; p = 0.04). Contact time with therapists was for a median 
of four visits of 58 minutes each over 8 weeks (mean dose 232 minutes). Repeated 
measures analysis including all time points showed no difference in NEADL total 
score, but PDQ-39 summary index (curves diverging at 1.6 points per annum, 95% 
CI 0.47 to 2.62; p = 0.005) and EQ-5D quotient (0.02, 95% CI 0.00007 to 0.03; 
p = 0.04) showed significant but small differences in favour of the therapy arm. 
Cost-effective analysis showed that therapy was associated with a slight but not 
significant gain in quality-adjusted life-years (0.027, 95% CI -0.010 to 0.065) 
at a small incremental cost (£164, 95% CI -£141 to £468), resulting in an 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of under £4000 (£3493, 95% -£169,371 to 
£176,358). There was no difference in adverse events or serious adverse events.
CONCLUSIONS: NHS PT and OT did not produce immediate or long-term clinically 
meaningful improvements in ADL or quality of life in patients with mild to 
moderate Parkinson's disease. This evidence does not support the use of 
low-dose, patient-centred, goal-directed PT and OT in patients in the early 
stages of Parkinson's disease. Future research should include the development 
and testing of more structured and intensive PT and OT programmes in patients 
with all stages of Parkinson's disease.

Since 2000 several papers have examined the efficiency of healthcare delivery 
systems worldwide. These papers have extended the literature using drastically 
different input and output combinations from one another, with little 
theoretical or empirical support backing these specifications. Issues arise that 
many of these inputs and outputs are available for a subset of OECD countries 
each year. Using a common estimator and the different specifications proposed 
leads to the result that efficiency rankings across papers can diverge quite 
significantly, with several countries being highly efficient in one 
specification and highly inefficient in another. Broad input-output measures 
that are collected annually provide consistent efficiency rankings across 
specifications, compared to specifications that utilize specific measures 
collected infrequently. This paper also finds that broad output measures that 
are not quality-adjusted, such as life expectancy, seem to be a suitable 
alternative for infrequently collected quality-adjusted output measures, such as 
disability adjusted life years.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate direct and indirect costs per quality adjusted life year 
(QALY) for different initial treatment strategies in very early RA.
METHODS: The 1-year data of the treatment in the Rotterdam Early Arthritis 
Cohort trial were used. Patients with a high probability (>70%) according to 
their likelihood of progressing to persistent arthritis, based on the prediction 
model of Visser, were randomized into one of following initial treatment 
strategies: (A) initial triple DMARD therapy (iTDT) with glucocorticoids (GCs) 
intramuscular (n = 91); (B) iTDT with an oral GC tapering scheme (n = 93); and 
(C) initial MTX monotherapy (iMM) with GCs similar to B (n = 97). Data on QALYs, 
measured with the Dutch EuroQol, and direct and indirect cost were used. Direct 
costs are costs of treatment and medical consumption, whereas indirect costs are 
costs due to loss of productivity.
RESULTS: Average QALYs (sd) for A, B and C were, respectively, 0.75 (0.12), 0.75 
(0.10) and 0.73 (0.13) for Dutch EuroQol. Highest total costs per QALY (sd) 
were, respectively, €12748 (€18767), €10 380 (€15 608) and €17 408 (€21 828) for 
strategy A, B and C (P = 0.012, B vs C). Direct as well as indirect costs were 
higher with iMM (strategy C) compared with iTDT (strategy B). Higher direct 
costs were due to ∼40% more biologic usage over time. Higher indirect costs, on 
the other hand, were caused by more long-term sickness and reduction in contract 
hours. iTDT was >95% cost-effective across all willingness-to-pay thresholds 
compared with iMM.
CONCLUSION: iTDT was more cost-effective and had better worker productivity 
compared with iMM.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Apixaban and enoxaparin are indicated for preventing 
venous thromboembolism (VTE). The aim of this study was to evaluate the cost 
effectiveness of apixaban versus enoxaparin for the prophylaxis of VTE and 
associated long-term complications in Chinese patients after total knee 
replacement (TKR).
METHODS: A decision model, which included both acute VTE (represented as a 
decision tree) and the long-term complications of VTE (represented as a Markov 
model), was developed to assess the economic outcomes of the two prophylactic 
strategies for Chinese patients after TKR. Transition probabilities, costs, and 
utilities were derived from published literature. One-way and probabilistic 
sensitivity analyses were performed to test the uncertainty concerning the model 
parameters. Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and direct medical costs were 
reported over a 5-year horizon. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) 
were also calculated.
RESULTS: Thromboprophylaxis with apixaban was estimated to have a higher cost 
(US$68) and more health benefits (0.0006 QALYs) than thromboprophylaxis with 
enoxaparin over a 5.5-year time horizon, resulting in an ICER of US$108,497 per 
QALY gained. One-way sensitivity analyses found that the cost of apixaban and 
the probability of pulmonary embolism when taking either apixaban or enoxaparin 
had a considerable impact on the model outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the analysis found that the use of enoxaparin in Chinese 
patients after TKR was likely to be more cost effective than the use of 
apixaban.

BACKGROUND: Transcatheter left atrial appendage occlusion (LAAO) is a promising 
therapy for stroke prophylaxis in non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) but 
its cost-effectiveness remains understudied. This study evaluated the 
cost-effectiveness of LAAO for stroke prophylaxis in NVAF.
METHODS: A Markov decision analytic model was used to compare the 
cost-effectiveness of LAAO with 7 pharmacological strategies: aspirin alone, 
clopidogrel plus aspirin, warfarin, dabigatran 110 mg, dabigatran 150 mg, 
apixaban, and rivaroxaban. Outcome measures included quality-adjusted life years 
(QALYs), lifetime costs and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). 
Base-case data were derived from ACTIVE, RE-LY, ARISTOTLE, ROCKET-AF, PROTECT-AF 
and PREVAIL trials. One-way sensitivity analysis varied by CHADS2 score, 
HAS-BLED score, time horizons, and LAAO costs; and probabilistic sensitivity 
analysis using 10,000 Monte Carlo simulations was conducted to assess parameter 
uncertainty.
RESULTS: LAAO was considered cost-effective compared with aspirin, clopidogrel 
plus aspirin, and warfarin, with ICER of US$5,115, $2,447, and $6,298 per QALY 
gained, respectively. LAAO was dominant (i.e. less costly but more effective) 
compared to other strategies. Sensitivity analysis demonstrated favorable ICERs 
of LAAO against other strategies in varied CHADS2 score, HAS-BLED score, time 
horizons (5 to 15 years) and LAAO costs. LAAO was cost-effective in 86.24 % of 
10,000 simulations using a threshold of US$50,000/QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: Transcatheter LAAO is cost-effective for prevention of stroke in 
NVAF compared with 7 pharmacological strategies. The transcatheter left atrial 
appendage occlusion (LAAO) is considered cost-effective against the standard 7 
oral pharmacological strategies including acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) alone, 
clopidogrel plus ASA, warfarin, dabigatran 110 mg, dabigatran 150 mg, apixaban, 
and rivaroxaban for stroke prophylaxis in non-valvular atrial fibrillation 
management.

Stressful environments are known to perturb developmental patterns in insects. 
In the purview of desiccation as a stressor, relatively little is known about 
the developmental consequences linked with desiccation tolerance. In this study, 
we have particularly focused on the exploration of the temporal profile of 
postembryonic development in response to desiccation exposure in Drosophila 
melanogaster and the associated trade-offs. We document a correlation between 
variations in 20-hydroxyecdysone levels and the altered timing of metamorphic 
events during the life cycle. Following desiccation, we observed an extension in 
the larval longevity whereas the duration of the pupal and adult stages was 
significantly shortened. Alternately, feeding of 20-hydroxyecdysone apparently 
led to the restoration of the normal temporal pattern of development in the 
desiccated group. In spite of the desiccation-responsive heterochronic shifts in 
development, the overall lifespan post recovery remained almost unaltered among 
the desiccated and undesiccated groups suggesting plasticity in developmental 
control. This observation reminisces 'canalization-like' phenomenon that buffers 
alterations in the overall lifespan. We thus identified a desiccationresponsive 
period in the lifespan of D. melanogaster during which variations in ecdysone 
levels are capable to alter the temporal course of development.
