Pre-diabetes is a risk factor for the development of diabetes, not a disease in 
its own right. The prevalence increases with age and reaches nearly 50% of those 
aged over 75 years in the USA. While lifestyle modification and treatment are 
likely to benefit those with many years of life ahead of them, they are unlikely 
to benefit patients with a limited life expectancy. Despite this, some very 
elderly patients in the UK and elsewhere are being labelled as pre-diabetic. 
While ideal practice would be to carefully consider the impact of any 
potentially abnormal blood test before it is taken, this is not always possible 
in routine practice. In this paper, we discuss a pragmatic, ethical approach for 
clinicians managing pre-diabetic blood tests in very elderly patients. We argue 
that a 'see-saw' model of paternalism should be used in deciding which patients 
to inform that they can be labelled as pre-diabetic. Those patients that may 
benefit from the label should be informed, and those that will not, should not. 
Where the benefits/drawbacks are unclear, the result and its potential 
significance should be discussed in depth with the individual patient. We do not 
advocate withholding information from any patient. Instead we suggest clinicians 
use individual patient circumstances to contextualise the relevance of 
pre-diabetes to the patient and consider the benefits and drawbacks before 
informing them. This approach has the potential to be used for other 
pre-conditions and risk factors in addition to pre-diabetes.

Cancer in dialysis patients is a common problem and is one of the most common 
reasons of mordibity and mortality in developed countries. An impaired renal 
function leads to the accumulation in the blood products of nitrogen 
transformation, which negatively affect organ function, especially the immune 
system. The Standardized Cancer Incidence is higher in patients with end-stage 
kidney failure than in the general population and reaches 1,18-1,42. The cancer 
risk is three times higher in dialysis patients over age 65 years and is more 
common among hemodialysis than peritoneal dialysis patients. The most common 
type of cancer occurring in this group of patients is urinary tract cancer which 
often develops on the basis of acquired cysts and in patients previously treated 
with cyclophosphamide. Nonetheless, patients with kidney problems are not 
regularly tested for these diseases and the only group that is screened for 
cancer are patients tested for kidney transplantation. Some problems in this 
topic are briefly presented in this article.

INTRODUCTION: Delayed bleeding (DB) is the most common major complication of 
endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR). Two randomized clinical trials recently 
demonstrated that clip closure after EMR of large nonpedunculated colorectal 
polyps (LNPCPs) reduces the risk of DB. We analyzed the cost-effectiveness of 
this prophylactic measure.
METHODS: EMRs of LNCPCPs were consecutively registered in the ongoing 
prospective multicenter database of the Spanish EMR Group from May 2013 until 
July 2017. Patients were classified according to the Spanish Endoscopy Society 
EMR group (GSEED-RE2) DB risk score. Cost-effectiveness analysis was performed 
for both Spanish and US economic contexts. The average incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) thresholds were set at 54,000 € or $100,000 per 
quality-adjusted life year, respectively.
RESULTS: We registered 2,263 EMRs in 2,130 patients. Applying their respective 
DB relative risk reductions after clip closure (51% and 59%), the DB rate 
decreased from 4.5% to 2.2% in the total cohort and from 13.7% to 5.7% in the 
high risk of the DB GSEED-RE2 subgroup. The ICERs for the universal clipping 
strategy in Spain and the United States, 469,706 € and $1,258,641, respectively, 
were not cost effective. By contrast, selective clipping in the high-risk of DB 
GSEED-RE2 subgroup was cost saving, with a negative ICER of -2,194 € in the 
Spanish context and cost effective with an ICER of $87,796 in the United States.
DISCUSSION: Clip closure after EMR of large colorectal lesions is cost effective 
in patients with a high risk of bleeding. The GSEED-RE2 DB risk score may be a 
useful tool to identify that high-risk population.

PURPOSE: To determine visual field findings in Boston type 1-KPro (BI-KPro) 
patients without glaucoma. Characterize normal threshold values and global 
indices using standard automated perimetry and characterize visual field 
amplitude using Goldmann's manual perimetry.
METHODS: This cross-sectional prospective noninterventional study included 
patients (n=6 patients, 6 eyes) with BI-KPro who had normal optical coherence 
tomography and fundoscopic evaluation of the optic disc and retina. None had a 
previous history of glaucoma. Visual acuity, reliable and reproducible standard 
automated perimetry (24-2 and 30-2), and manual perimetry examinations were 
obtained from all patients. Each patient answered the National Eye Institute 
Visual Function Questionnaire, and the results were correlated with visual field 
indices.
RESULTS: The mean visual acuity was 0.35±0.31 logMAR (0.84 to 0.10). All visual 
fields had good reliability indices. The standard automated perimetry mean 
deviation values were -7.25±3.63 decibels (dB) and -7.75±3.23 (24-2 and 30-2 
values, respectively), whereas pattern SD values were 2.72±0.82 and 3.30±1.13 
(24-2 and 30-2, respectively). The manual visual field mean values of the 4 
quadrants (superior, temporal, inferior, and nasal), were 39.7±4.5, 61.8±6.2, 
54.0±4.3, and 48.2±7.6 degrees, respectively. The authors found a significant 
correlation between the VFQ-25 indexes of general sight and close-range 
activities with the values of total deviation at 10 degrees. VFQ-25 peripheral 
vision indexes also correlated significantly with values of total deviation at 
30 degrees (outermost locations in the 30-degree area).
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with BI-KPro presented reliable and reproductive visual 
field measurements. The authors found a consistent reduction in visual field 
extension and a global sensitivity reduction in these patients. Despite visual 
field changes, our patients had a good quality of life scores. Overall, these 
results could be useful to improve early glaucoma diagnosis and to follow-up 
BI-KPro patients.

BACKGROUND: Secondhand smoke (SHS) exposure at home and fetal SHS exposure 
during pregnancy are a major cause of disease among children. The aim of this 
study is quantifying the burden of disease due to SHS exposure in children and 
in pregnancy in 2006-2017 for the 28 European Union (EU) countries.
METHODS: Exposure to SHS was estimated using a multiple imputation procedure 
based on the Eurobarometer surveys, and SHS exposure burden was estimated with 
the comparative risk assessment method using meta-analytical relative risks. 
Data on deaths and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) were collected from 
National statistics and from the Global Burden of Disease Study.
RESULTS: Exposure to SHS and its attributable burden stalled in 2006-2017; in 
pregnant women, SHS exposure was 19.8% in 2006, 19.1% in 2010, and 21.0% in 
2017; in children it was 10.1% in 2006, 9.6% in 2010, and 12.1% in 2017. In 
2017, 35,633 DALYs among children were attributable to SHS exposure in the EU, 
mainly due to low birth weight.
CONCLUSIONS: Comprehensive smoking bans up to 2010 contributed to reduce SHS 
exposure and its burden in children immediately after their implementation; 
however, SHS exposure still occurs, and in 2017, its burden in children was 
still relevant.
IMPACT: Exposure to secondhand smoke at home and in pregnancy is a major cause 
of disease among children. Smoking legislation produced the adoption of 
voluntary smoking bans in homes; however, secondhand smoke exposure at home 
still occurs and its burden is substantial. In 2017, the number of deaths and 
disability-adjusted life years in children attributable to exposure to 
secondhand smoke in the European Union countries were, respectively, 335 and 
35,633. Low birth weight caused by secondhand smoke exposure in pregnancy showed 
the largest burden. Eastern European Union countries showed the highest burden.

The Impact of Prostate Cancer Treatment on Quality of Life: A Narrative Review 
with a Focus on Randomized Data.

Center at Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA, USA.

Despite excellent oncologic outcomes, the management of localized prostate 
cancer remains complex and is dependent on multiple factors, including patient 
life expectancy, medical comorbidities, tumor characteristics, and genetic risk 
factors. Decades of iterative clinical trials have improved the optimization and 
utilization of surgical and radiation-based modalities, as well as their 
combinatorial use with anti-androgen and systemic therapies. While cure rates 
are high and converging on equivalent disease control should an upfront surgical 
or radiotherapeutic approach be optimized, the long-term side effects of 
surgical and radiation-based treatments can differ significantly in nature. 
Decisions regarding the selection of therapy are therefore best made in an 
informed and shared medical decision-making process between clinician and 
patient with respect to cancer control as well as adverse effects. We outline in 
this narrative review an understanding regarding implications of surgical and 
radiation treatment on quality of life after treatment, and how these data may 
be considered in the context of advising patients regarding the selection of 
therapy. This narrative review largely focuses on the quality of life data 
obtained from prospective randomized trials of men treated for prostate cancer. 
We believe this provides the best assessment of the quality of life and can be 
used to inform patients when making treatment decisions.

Epidemiologic Research on Healthy Life Expectancy and Proposal for Its 
Extension: A Revised English Version of Japanese in the Journal of the Japan 
Medical Association 2019;148(9):1781-4.

Healthy life expectancy is an indicator that represents a composite of data on 
mortality and health status and is defined as the average number of years that a 
person can expect to live at a certain level of health. To extend people's 
healthy life expectancy, my colleague and I conducted a variety of epidemiologic 
research based upon community-based cohort studies and intervention trials. The 
findings from our prospective cohort studies included blood pressure reference 
values measured at home, green tea health benefit, Japanese dietary pattern, and 
feeling ikigai (a sense of life worth living) at daily life. Based upon these 
evidence, I have made some proposals toward extension of healthy life 
expectancy. In 2011, as the Chair of the Planning Committee for the Next 
National Health Promotion of Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare (MHLW), I 
proposed that the Health Japan 21 (second term) should aim to extend healthy 
life expectancy to exceed the number of years extended in the total life 
expectancy, thus compressing the duration to be spent in an unhealthy state 
(compression of morbidity). In the interim evaluation of the Health Japan 21 
(second term) in 2018, we were able to demonstrate that this goal is being 
achieved. Compared with 2010, in 2016, the increase in healthy life expectancy 
(1.72 years in men and 1.17 years in women) was higher than that of total life 
expectancy (1.43 years in men and 0.84 years in women). As a result, the 
duration to be spent in an unhealthy state was reduced by 0.29 years in men and 
by 0.33 years in women. It is important to note that Japan is the only country 
that has made progress in achieving compression of morbidity at the national 
level. We need to maintain this momentum of compressing morbidity.

OBJECTIVE: To report the levels and trends of prevalence, deaths, and 
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) due to musculoskeletal disorders, 
categorized as low back pain, neck pain, osteoarthritis (OA), rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA), gout, and other musculoskeletal disorders, across 195 countries 
and territories from 1990 to 2017 according to age, sex, and Sociodemographic 
Index (SDI; a composite of sociodemographic factors).
METHODS: Data were obtained from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study 2017. 
The fatal and nonfatal burdens of musculoskeletal disorders were estimated using 
the Cause of Death Ensemble model and Bayesian meta-regression tool, 
respectively. Estimates were provided for all musculoskeletal disorders and the 
corresponding 6 categories at global, regional, and national levels from 1990 to 
2017. Counts and age-standardized rates per 100,000 population along with 95% 
uncertainty intervals (95% UIs) were reported for prevalence, deaths, and DALYs.
RESULTS: Globally, there were ~1.3 billion prevalent cases (95% UI 1.2 billion, 
1.4 billion), 121.3 thousand deaths (95% UI 105.6 thousand, 126.2 thousand), and 
138.7 million DALYs (95% UI 101.9 million, 182.6 million) due to musculoskeletal 
disorders in 2017. Age-standardized prevalence, death, and DALY rates per 
100,000 population were 16,276.2 (95% UI 15,495.5, 17,145.8), 1.6 (95% UI 1.4, 
1.6), and 1,720 (95% UI 1,264.4, 2,259.2), respectively. Age-standardized 
prevalence (-1.6% [95% UI -2.4, -0.8]) and DALY rates (-3.5% [95% UI -4.7, 
-2.3]) decreased slightly from 1990. The global point prevalence rate of 
musculoskeletal disorders in 2017 was higher in women than in men and increased 
with age up to the oldest age group. Globally, the proportion of prevalent cases 
according to category of musculoskeletal disorders in 2017 was greatest for low 
back pain (36.8%), followed by other musculoskeletal disorders (21.5%), OA 
(19.3%), neck pain (18.4%), gout (2.6%), and RA (1.3%). These proportions did 
not change appreciably compared with 1990. The burden due to musculoskeletal 
conditions was higher in developed countries. The countries with the highest 
age-standardized prevalence rates of musculoskeletal disorders in 2017 were 
Switzerland (23,346.0 [95% UI 22,392.6, 24,329.8]), Chile (23,007.9 [95% UI 
21,746.5, 24,165.8]), and Denmark (22,166.1 [95% UI 20,817.2, 23,542.1]). The 
greatest increases from 1990 were found in Chile (10.8% [95% UI 6.6, 15.4]), 
Benin (8.8% [95% UI 6.7, 11.1]), and El Salvador (8.5% [95% UI 5.5, 11.9]).
CONCLUSION: There is a large burden of musculoskeletal disorders globally, with 
some notable inter-country variation. Some countries have twice the burden of 
other countries. Increasing population awareness regarding risk factors, 
consequences, and evidence-informed treatment strategies for musculoskeletal 
disorders with a focus on the older female population in developed countries is 
needed, particularly for low back and neck pain and OA, which contribute a large 
burden among this cohort.

Aging is strongly related to energy metabolism, but the underlying processes and 
mechanisms are complex and incompletely understood. Restricting energy intake 
and reducing metabolic rate can slow the rate of aging and extend longevity, 
implying a reciprocal relationship between energy metabolism and life 
expectancy. However, increased energy expenditure has also been associated with 
improved health and longer life. In both experimental animals and humans, 
reduced body temperature has been related to extended longevity. However, recent 
findings on the function of thermogenic (brown or beige) adipose tissue produced 
intense interest in increasing the amount of energy expended for thermogenesis 
to prevent and/or treat obesity, improve metabolic health, and extend life. 
Evidence available to-date indicates that increasing adipose tissue 
thermogenesis by pharmacologic, environmental, or genetic interventions can 
indeed produce significant metabolic benefits, which are associated with 
improved chances for healthy aging and long life.

Impact of cardiovascular risk factors on incidence and severity of Retinal Vein 
Occlusion.

Pacella F, Bongiovanni G, Malvasi M, Trovato Battagliola E, Pistone A, Scalinci 
SZ, Basili S, La Torre G, Pacella E.

PURPOSE: Retinal Vein Occlusion (RVO) is a thrombotic process affecting retinal 
veins. The purpose of this research is to study demographic characteristics and 
prevalence of cardiovascular comorbidities among subjects affected by RVO. In 
addition, authors explore the role of each variable in determining occlusion 
type and severity.
SUBJECTS, MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a prospective observational study 
recruiting subjects affected by RVO and secondary macular edema. Exclusion 
criteria included pre-existing macular edema, recent ocular surgery (<6 months), 
pregnancy, diagnosis other than RVO, diabetes mellitus type I, any systemic 
pathology that significantly reduced life expectancy. Each participant was 
studied through a comprehensive medical history, cardiovascular assessment, 
blood testing, ocular exam, and macular OCT imaging.
RESULTS: A total of 145 eyes, 145 participants, thereof 80 males (55%) and 65 
females. (45%) Mean age: 62.5 ± 14.3 SD. 61 eyes (42%) were affected by CRVO and 
84 eyes (58%) by BRVO. No statistically significant differences were noted 
between genders. Hypertension was very prevalent (63%). Dyslipidemia was more 
associated with BRVO (p = 0.044). Subjects with hypertension had a mean central 
macular thickness (CMT) of 643 µm against a mean of 489 µm of those without 
hypertension. (p < 0.05). No other variable was associated with macular edema 
severity.
CONCLUSIONS: Older age and hypertension are strong risk factors for RVO. 
Dyslipidemia was strongly associated with BRVO. (p=0.044) Hypertension was not 
only associated with RVO incidence, but also with its severity. In fact, 
hypertensive subjects had significantly worse macular edema.

STUDY OBJECTIVES: To examine the cost-effectiveness and potential net monetary 
benefit (NMB) of a fully automated digital cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) 
intervention for insomnia compared with no insomnia treatment in the United 
States (US). Similar relative comparisons were made for pharmacotherapy and 
clinician-delivered CBT (individual and group).
METHODS: We simulated a Markov model of 100,000 individuals using parameters 
calibrated from the literature including direct (treatment) and indirect costs 
(e.g. insomnia-related healthcare expenditure and lost workplace productivity). 
Health utility estimates were converted into quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) 
and one QALY was worth $50,000. Simulated individuals were randomized equally to 
one of five arms (digital CBT, pharmacotherapy, individual CBT, group CBT, or no 
insomnia treatment). Sensitivity was assessed by bootstrapping the calibrated 
parameters. Cost estimates were expressed in 2019 US dollars.
RESULTS: Digital CBT was cost beneficial when compared with no insomnia 
treatment and had a positive NMB of $681.06 (per individual over 6 months). 
Bootstrap sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the NMB was positive in 94.7% 
of simulations. Relative to other insomnia treatments, digital CBT was the most 
cost-effective treatment because it generated the smallest incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (-$3,124.73).
CONCLUSIONS: Digital CBT was the most cost-effective insomnia treatment followed 
by group CBT, pharmacotherapy, and individual CBT. It is financially prudent and 
beneficial from a societal perspective to utilize automated digital CBT to treat 
insomnia at a population scale.

Assessment, Porto Alegre, Brazil.

OBJECTIVE: To estimate the burden of disease of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) in 
Brazil in 2014, 1 year before the Zika virus epidemic, and in 2015 and 2016 
during the epidemic.
METHODS: The burden of disease of GBS was estimated using the summary measure of 
population health: Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALY), that combines both 
mortality (Years of Life Lost YLLs) and morbidity (Years Lived with Disability) 
components. The study population was composed of GBS hospitalised cases and 
deaths from the information systems of the Brazilian Unified Health System.
RESULTS: The GBS incidence rate in 2014, 2015 and 2016 was 0.74, 0.96, 
1.02/100 000 respectively, and the mortality rate in the same period was 0.08, 
0.009 and 0.11/100 000 habitants. The DALYs calculated using the point estimate 
of GBS disability weight and its values of the confidence interval (0.198 and 
0.414) were 5725.90 (5711.79-5742.89) in 2014, 6054.61 (6035.57-6077.54) in 2015 
and 7588.49 (7570.20-7610.51) in 2016. The DALYs were high among the male 
population and in age groups between 20 and 50 years.
CONCLUSIONS: The increase in DALYs in the years 2015 and 2016 compared to 2014 
probably resulted from the introduction of ZIKV in Brazil, reinforcing the 
importance of investments in the prevention of ZIKV infection and in the care of 
GBS patients.

Publisher: OBJECTIF: Estimer la charge de morbidité du syndrome de 
Guillain-Barré (SGB) au Brésil en 2014, un an avant l'épidémie du virus Zika 
(ZIKV) et en 2015 et 2016 pendant l'épidémie. MÉTHODES: La charge de la maladie 
du SGB a été estimée à l'aide de la mesure récapitulative de la santé de la 
population: années de vie ajustées en fonction de l'incapacité (AVCI), qui 
combine à la fois les composantes de la mortalité (années de vie perdues AVP) et 
de la morbidité (années vécues avec une incapacité). La population de l'étude 
était composée de cas hospitalisés du SGB et de décès provenant des systèmes 
d'information du système de santé unifié brésilien. RÉSULTATS: Le taux 
d'incidence du SGB en 2014, 2015 et 2016 était de 0,74 ; 0,96 et 1,02/100.000 
respectivement et le taux de mortalité au cours de la même période était de 
0,08 ; 0,009 et 0,11/100.000 habitants. Les AVCI calculées à l'aide des points 
d'estimation du poids de l'incapacité du SGB et de ses valeurs de l'intervalle 
de confiance (0,198 et 0,414) étaient de 5.725,90 (5.711,79-5.742,89) en 2014 ; 
6.054,61 (6.035,57-6.077,54) en 2015 et 7.588,49 (7.570,20 - 7.610,51) en 2016. 
Les AVCI étaient élevés parmi la population masculine et dans les groupes d'âge 
entre 20 et 50 ans.
CONCLUSIONS: L'augmentation des AVCI en 2015 et 2016 par rapport à 2014 résulte 
probablement de l'introduction du ZIKV au Brésil, renforçant l'importance des 
investissements dans la prévention de l'infection par le ZIKV et dans la prise 
en charge des patients atteints de SGB.

Cost-effectiveness of osimertinib versus standard EGFR-TKI as first-line 
treatment for locally advanced or metastatic EGFR mutation-positive non-small 
cell lung cancer in Australia.

Objectives: To assess the cost-effectiveness of osimertinib versus standard 
epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs), 
gefitinib or erlotinib, as first-line treatment for patients with locally 
advanced or metastatic EGFR mutation-positive non-small cell lung cancer in 
Australia from a healthcare system perspective.Methods: A partitioned survival 
model comprising three mutually exclusive health states with a five-year time 
horizon was developed. Model inputs were sourced from the pivotal trial (FLAURA) 
and published literature. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), in 
terms of cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained and cost per 
life-year (LY) gained, were calculated. Uncertainty of the results was assessed 
using deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses.Results: Compared 
with standard EGFR-TKIs, osimertinib was associated with a higher incremental 
cost of A$118,502, and an incremental benefit of 0.274 QALYs and 0.313 LYs. The 
ICER was estimated to be A$432,197/QALY gained and A$378,157/LY gained. The 
base-case ICER was most sensitive to changes in cost of first-line osimertinib, 
time horizon, and choice of overall survival data (interim versus final 
analysis).Conclusions: At a willingness-to-pay threshold of A$50,000/QALY, 
first-line osimertinib is not cost-effective compared with standard EGFR-TKIs in 
Australia based on the current published price. To achieve acceptable 
cost-effectiveness, the cost of first-line osimertinib needs to be reduced by at 
least 68.4%.

BACKGROUND: To provide an interpretable summary of the impact on mortality of 
the COVID-19 pandemic we estimate weekly and annual life expectancies at birth 
in Spain and its regions.
METHODS: We used daily death count data from the Spanish Daily Mortality 
Monitoring System (MoMo), and death counts from 2018, and population on July 
1st, 2019 by region (CCAA), age groups, and sex from the Spanish National 
Statistics Institute. We estimated weekly and annual (2019 and 2020*, the 
shifted annual calendar period up to 5 July 2020) life expectancies at birth as 
well as their differences with respect to 2019.
RESULTS: Weekly life expectancies at birth in Spain were lower in weeks 11-20, 
2020 compared to the same weeks in 2019. This drop in weekly life expectancy was 
especially strong in weeks 13 and 14 (March 23rd to April 5th), with national 
declines ranging between 6.1 and 7.6 years and maximum regional weekly declines 
of up to 15 years in Madrid. Annual life expectancy differences between 2019 and 
2020 also reflected an overall drop in annual life expectancy of 0.9 years for 
both men and women. These drops ranged between 0 years in several regions (e.g. 
Canary and Balearic Islands) to 2.8 years among men in Madrid.
CONCLUSIONS: Life expectancy is an easy to interpret measure for understanding 
the heterogeneity of mortality patterns across Spanish regions. Weekly and 
annual life expectancy are sensitive and useful indicators for understanding 
disparities and communicating the gravity of the situation because differences 
are expressed in intuitive year units.

Schizophrenia is a severe neuropsychiatric disease associated with substantially 
higher mortality. Reduced life expectancy in schizophrenia relates to an 
increased prevalence of metabolic disturbance, and antipsychotic medication is a 
major contributor. Molecular mechanisms underlying adverse metabolic effects of 
antipsychotics are not fully understood; however, adipose tissue homeostasis 
deregulation appears to be a critical factor. We employed mass 
spectrometry-based untargeted proteomics to assess the effect of chronic 
olanzapine, risperidone, and haloperidol treatment in visceral adipose tissue of 
prenatally methylazoxymethanol (MAM) acetate exposed rats, a well-validated 
neurodevelopmental animal model of schizophrenia. Bioinformatics analysis of 
differentially expressed proteins was performed to highlight the pathways 
affected by MAM and the antipsychotics treatment. MAM model was associated with 
the deregulation of the TOR (target of rapamycin) signalling pathway. Notably, 
alterations in protein expression triggered by antipsychotics were observed only 
in schizophrenia-like MAM animals where we revealed hundreds of affected 
proteins according to our two-fold threshold, but not in control animals. 
Treatments with all antipsychotics in MAM rats resulted in the downregulation of 
mRNA processing and splicing, while drug-specific effects included among others 
upregulation of insulin resistance (olanzapine), upregulation of fatty acid 
metabolism (risperidone), and upregulation of nucleic acid metabolism 
(haloperidol). Our data indicate that deregulation of several energetic and 
metabolic pathways in adipose tissue is associated with APs administration and 
is prominent in MAM schizophrenia-like model but not in control animals.

BACKGROUND: Botulinum toxin injection (BTI) reduces muscle hyperactivity, but 
its effect on active upper-limb function is limited. Intensive rehabilitation 
could optimize the effects; however, outpatient post-stroke rehabilitation is 
usually not intensive. One solution could be self-rehabilitation.
OBJECTIVES: The aim of this randomized controlled trial was to determine the 
effect of a self-rehabilitation program combined with BTI on upper-limb function 
in individuals with chronic hemiparesis.
METHODS: In total, 33 outpatients were randomly allocated to receive 
BTI+self-rehabilitation (R group: n=17) or BTI alone (C group: n=16). Outcomes 
evaluated just before the BTI and 4 weeks later included the Wolf Motor Function 
Test (WMFT time: primary outcome), Action Research Arm Test, fatigue and quality 
of life.
RESULTS: Change in WMFT did not differ between groups at 4 weeks (WMFT time: 
-14% for R group, -4% for C group. WFMT score: +12% for R group, 0% in C group). 
WFMT time and score improved significantly in the R group only (-14%, P=0.01, 
and +12%, P=0.02). In addition, the proportion of patients with improved WMFT 
time and score was higher in the R than C group (R group: 71% improved score, 
77% improved time; C group: 43% improved score, 50% improved time). Also, 
passive range of shoulder flexion (P=0.03) and wrist extension (P=0.01) improved 
only in the R group. No other variables changed significantly. Compliance was 
excellent; average daily training time was greater than that prescribed.
CONCLUSIONS: The addition of a self-rehabilitation program to BTI did not 
significantly improve functional outcomes more than BTI alone; however, movement 
quality and speed improved only in the self-rehabilitation group. Participants 
in the self-rehabilitation group trained more than they were asked to, which 
suggests that they found the program worthwhile. These clinically relevant 
findings justify larger-scale studies of the effects of self-rehabilitation to 
enhance the effects of BTI.

OBJECTIVE: To understand the prevalence of behavioral and characterological 
self-blame and their associations with stated preferences for life-extension and 
the use of pain-relief medication in a multi-country cohort of advanced cancer 
patients.
METHODS: The prevalence of self-blame and reasons participants attributed to 
their diagnosis was assessed in a sample of 968 advanced cancer patients 
enrolled in one of five sites from four Asian countries of the multi-country 
cross-sectional survey titled APRROACH. Ordered probit and Firth logistic 
regressions were used to determine associations between each type of self-blame 
and two treatment-related outcomes: participants' stated preference for 
life-extension and the use of pain-relief medication in the last 24 h.
RESULTS: Behavioral and characterological self-blame were reported by 41% and 
49% of the participants respectively, with only 19% and 2% of participants 
providing a logically consistent reason for the two types of self-blame. We 
observed no statistically significant differences in stated preferences for 
life-extension for either type of self-blame and in the use of pain-relief 
medication for participants reporting behavioral self-blame. However, 
participants reporting characterological self-blame were 9.7% (95% CI, 2.0% to 
17.3%; p = 0.014) more likely to report using pain-relief medication compared to 
participants not reporting characterological self-blame.
CONCLUSIONS: A substantial proportion of patients report self-blame and those 
reporting characterological self-blame appear more likely to use pain 
medication. Therefore, developing interventions aimed at reducing 
characterological self-blame might help patients receive only appropriate 
treatments as opposed to treatments pursued in response to feelings of 
self-blame.

BACKGROUND: The HEALing Communities Study (HCS) is designed to implement and 
evaluate the Communities That HEAL (CTH) intervention, a conceptually driven 
framework to assist communities in selecting and adopting evidence-based 
practices to reduce opioid overdose deaths. The goal of the HCS is to produce 
generalizable information for policy makers and community stakeholders seeking 
to implement CTH or a similar community intervention. To support this objective, 
one aim of the HCS is a health economics study (HES), the results of which will 
inform decisions around fiscal feasibility and sustainability relevant to other 
community settings.
METHODS: The HES is integrated into the HCS design: an unblinded, multisite, 
parallel arm, cluster randomized, wait list-controlled trial of the CTH 
intervention implemented in 67 communities in four U.S. states: Kentucky, 
Massachusetts, New York, and Ohio. The objectives of the HES are to estimate the 
economic costs to communities of implementing and sustaining CTH; estimate 
broader societal costs associated with CTH; estimate the cost-effectiveness of 
CTH for overdose deaths avoided; and use simulation modeling to evaluate the 
short- and long-term health and economic impact of CTH, including future 
overdose deaths avoided and quality-adjusted life years saved, and to develop a 
simulation policy tool for communities that seek to implement CTH or a similar 
community intervention.
DISCUSSION: The HCS offers an unprecedented opportunity to conduct health 
economics research on solutions to the opioid crisis and to increase 
understanding of the impact and value of complex, community-level interventions.

Thyroid cancer incidence is on the rise; however, fortunately, the death rate is 
stable. Most persons with well-differentiated thyroid cancer have a low risk of 
recurrence at the time of diagnosis and can expect a normal life expectancy. 
Over the last two decades, guidelines have recommended less aggressive therapy 
for low-risk cancer and a more personalized approach to treatment of thyroid 
cancer overall. The American Thyroid Association (ATA) and National 
Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) thyroid cancer guidelines recommend 
hemithyroidectomy as an acceptable surgical treatment option for low-risk 
thyroid cancer. Given this change in treatment paradigms, an increasing number 
of people are undergoing hemithyroidectomy rather than total or near-total 
thyroidectomy as their primary surgical treatment of thyroid cancer. The 
postoperative follow-up of hemithyroidectomy patients differs from those who

management recommendations for those who have undergone hemithyroidectomy.
