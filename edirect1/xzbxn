with syringe connected to a hydrophilic coated catheter by low-pressure 
aspiration from each of the four collection sites: inferior vena cava in the 
suprarenal portion, inferior vena cava in the infrarenal portion, left adrenal 
vein, and right adrenal vein; then immediately transferred from syringe to tubes 
with gel separator. All tubes were centrifuged at 1200 x g for 10 minutes.
RESULTS: At the end of centrifugation process, primary blood tubes containing 
blood from inferior vena cava and left adrenal vein exhibited the standard gel 
separator barrier, while tubes from right adrenal vein showed abnormal flotation 
of gel separator. The radiologist confirmed the usage of 2.6 mL instead of 2.0 
mL of Iopamidol 300 mg/mL. This iodinated contrast media, with 1.33 g/cm3 of 
density, was used close to the right adrenal vein due to some difficulty to 
access it.
CONCLUSION: The abnormal flotation of gel separator in samples taken from right 
adrenal vein can be explained by the usage of the iodinated contrast media. We 
suggest using plain-tubes (without gel separator) for AVS in order to avoid 
preanalytical nonconformities. Moreover, a blood volume equivalent to twice the 
catheter extension should be discarded to eliminate residual contrast media 
before collection of samples for laboratory assays.

Foraging specialization allows social insects to more efficiently exploit 
resources in their environment. Recent research on honeybees suggests that 
specialization on pollen or nectar among foragers is linked to reproductive 
physiology and sensory tuning (the Reproductive Ground-Plan Hypothesis; RGPH). 
However, our understanding of the underlying physiological relationships in 
non-Apis bees is still limited. Here we show that the bumblebee Bombus 
terrestris has specialist pollen and nectar foragers, and test whether foraging 
specialization in B. terrestris is linked to reproductive physiology, measured 
as ovarian activation. We show that neither ovary size, sensory sensitivity, 
measured through proboscis extension response (PER), or whole-body lipid stores 
differed between pollen foragers, nectar foragers, or generalist foragers. Body 
size also did not differ between any of these three forager groups. Non-foragers 
had significantly larger ovaries than foragers. This suggests that potentially 
reproductive individuals avoid foraging.

OBJECTIVES: Improvement in life expectancy with the use of combination 
antiretroviral therapy has come with the recognition of the complications 
associated with chronic human immunodeficiency virus infection. Vitamin D has 
been of particular interest because of its effect on bone health and immune 
functions. The purpose of this study was to assess vitamin D status in children 
in relation to the duration and severity of their human immunodeficiency virus 
infection and nutritional status, as well as to determine whether there was any 
effect of seasonality.
METHODS: The study design was cross-sectional and all children 0 to 21 years of 
age were eligible to participate.
RESULTS: A total of 59 participants provided informed consent, with 54 subjects 
completing all study activities. Thirteen (24.1%) had sufficient vitamin D 
levels, 13 (24.1%) had insufficient levels, and 28 (51.9%) had deficient levels 
per the guidelines of the Endocrine Society. In our univariate analysis, younger 
age was associated with higher vitamin D levels (P = 0.030). Higher CD4 counts 
were associated with higher vitamin D levels (P = 0.018). A significant 
association between the vitamin D intake per day and vitamin D level was seen (P 
= 0.013). In the multivariate analysis, the best ordinal logistic regression 
model had the CD4 count as predictor (P < 0.005), higher CD4 counts were 
associated with decreased odds of vitamin D deficiency (odds ratio 0.47, 95% 
confidence interval 0.28-0.80).
CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin D deficiency was common among the patients included in this 
study.

The scope of palliative care includes goal setting, symptom management, and care 
of the care giver. Palliative care is essential for patient-centered care of the 
older cancer patients. The diversity of this population in terms of life 
expectancy, treatment tolerance, function, disability, and social support 
mandates personalized treatment plans. The assessment of physiologic age is 
currently based on a comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA). A number of 
biologic markers of aging including the inflammatory index, the genomic clock, 
the expression of p16INKa4, and the circulating levels of vitamin D may 
complement the CGA and fine-tune the determination of physiologic age. Goal 
setting in older patients may be complicated by communication difficulties 
related to hearing, cognition, expectation, and culture. Cancer-related pain is 
a major hindrance to the maintenance of functional independence and fatigue is 
harbinger of disability and death. The article explores the assessment and the 
management of the most common and debilitating symptoms in older cancer 
patients.

Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most malignant and aggressive among primary brain 
tumors, characterized by very low life expectancy. In vivo, glioma and 
glioblastoma in particular contain large numbers of immune cells (myeloid cells) 
such as microglia and tumour-infiltrating macrophages (or glioma associated 
macrophages). These glioma-infiltrating myeloid cells comprise up to 30% of 
total tumor mass and have been suggested to play several roles in glioma 
progression including proliferation, survival, motility and immunosuppression. 
Although tumor microglia and macrophages can acquire proinflammatory (M1) 
phenotype being capable of releasing proinflammatory cytokines, phagocytosing 
and presenting antigens, their effector immune function in gliomas appears to be 
suppressed by the acquisition of an anti-inflammatory (M2) phenotype. In the 
present work we review the microglia-glioma interactions to highlight the close 
relationship between the two cell types and the factors that can influence their 
properties (chemokines, cytokines, S100B protein). A future therapeutic 
possibility might be to simultaneously targeting, for example with nanomedicine, 
glioma cells and microglia to push the microglia towards an antitumor phenotype 
(M1) and/or prevent glioma cells from "conditioning" by microglia.

BACKGROUND: Up to a fifth of patients diagnosed with prostate cancer (PC) will 
develop castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), which has been associated 
with a poor prognosis. The aim of this study was to consider the patient 
perspective as part of the overall treatment decision-making process for CRPC, 
given that an alignment between patient preference and prescribing has been 
shown to benefit patient outcomes. This study examines preferences of patients 
with CRPC in Japan for treatment features associated with treatments like 
RA-223, abiraterone, and docetaxel and to examine the extent to which treatment 
preferences may vary between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients.
METHODS: A two-phase research approach was implemented. In Phase 1, N = 8 
patients with CRPC were recruited from a single hospital to complete a 
qualitative interview to provide feedback on the draft survey. In Phase 2, 
N = 134 patients with CRPC were recruited from five hospitals to complete a 
paper survey. The survey included 6 treatment choice questions, each asking 
patients to choose between two hypothetical treatments for their CRPC. Each 
treatment alternative was defined by the following attributes: length of overall 
survival (OS), time to a symptomatic skeletal event (SSE), method of 
administration, reduction in the risk of bone pain, treatment-associated risk of 
fatigue and lost work days. A hierarchical Bayesian logistic regression was used 
to estimate relative preference weights for each attribute level and mean 
relative importance.
RESULTS: A total of N = 133 patients with CRPC completed the survey and were 
included in the final analysis. Patients had a mean age of 75.4 years (SD = 7.4) 
and had been diagnosed with PC a mean of 6.5 years prior (SD = 4.4). Over the 
attribute levels shown, fatigue (relative importance [RI] = 24.9 %, 95 % CI: 
24.7 %, 25.1 %) was the most important attribute, followed by reduction in the 
risk of bone pain (RI = 23.2 %, 95 % CI: 23.0 %, 23.5 %), and OS (RI = 19.2 %, 
95 % CI: 19.0 %, 19.4 %). Although symptomatic patients placed significantly 
more importance on delaying an SSE (p < .05), no other preference differences 
were observed.
CONCLUSIONS: CRPC patients were more concerned about reduced quality of life 
from side effects of treatment rather than extension of survival, which may have 
implications for shared decision-making between patients and physicians.

BACKGROUND: Ethnic health inequalities for males and females among the elderly 
have not yet been verified in multicultural societies in developing countries. 
The aim of this study was to assess the extent of disparities in health 
expectancy among the elderly from different ethnic groups using quality-adjusted 
life expectancy.
DESIGN: A cross-sectional community-based survey was conducted. A total of 6,511 
rural elderly individuals aged ≥60 years were selected from eight different 
ethnic groups in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region of China and assessed for 
health-related quality of life (HRQoL). The HRQoL utility value was combined 
with life expectancy at age 60 years (LE60) data by using Sullivan's method to 
estimate quality-adjusted life expectancy at age 60 years (QALE60) and loss in 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) for each group.
RESULTS: Overall, LE60 and QALE60 for all ethnic groups were 20.9 and 18.0 years 
in men, respectively, and 24.2 and 20.3 years in women. The maximum gap in 
QALE60 between ethnic groups was 3.3 years in males and 4.6 years in females. 
The average loss in QALY was 2.9 years for men and 3.8 years for women. The 
correlation coefficient between LE60 and QALY lost was -0.53 in males and 0.12 
in females.
CONCLUSION: Women live longer than men, but they suffer more; men have a shorter 
life expectancy, but those who live longer are healthier. Attempts should be 
made to reduce suffering in the female elderly and improve longevity for men. 
Certain ethnic groups had low levels of QALE, needing special attention to 
improve their lifestyle and access to health care.

As the population ages and indications for MRI increase, it is estimated that 50 
to 75% of patients with a cardiac implantable electronic device 
(CIED) - pacemaker (PM) or implanted cardiac defibrillator (ICD) - will need an 
MRI during their CIED's lifetime. Three categories of materials are defined: MRI 
compatible, MRI non-compatible, and MRI conditional. MRI compatible CIEDs 
without electrodes have been developed, but do not allow battery changes, so 
that they are exclusively indicated for patients whose life expectancy is less 
than that of the battery (6-7years). For MRI conditional CIEDs, all 
manufacturers publish restrictions. These restrictions can relate to the patient 
(size, position in the MRI, body temperature), the MRI parameters (magnetic 
field), or the examination in itself (gradients, specific absorption rate, 
duration, isocenter). The neuroradiologist can expect to be confronted with the 
issue of MRI in patients with a CIED. The purpose of this review is to provide 
them with updated information on MRI and CIEDs.

OBJECTIVES: To cross-culturally adapt and validate the Spanish-language version 
of the SARC-F in Mexican community-dwelling older adults.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis of a prospective cohort.
SETTING: The FraDySMex study, a 2-round evaluation of community-dwelling adults 
from 2 municipalities in Mexico City.
PARTICIPANTS: Participants were 487 men and women older than 60 years, living in 
the designated area in Mexico City.
MEASUREMENTS: Information from questionnaires regarding demographic 
characteristics, comorbidities, mental status, nutritional status, dependence in 
activities of daily living, frailty, and quality of life. Objective measurements 
of muscle mass, strength and function were as follows: skeletal muscle mass 
index (SMI) was taken using dual-energy x-ray, grip strength using a hand 
dynamometer, 6-meter gait speed using a GAIT Rite instrumented walkway, peak 
torque and power for knee extension using a isokinetic dynamometer, lower 
extremity functioning measured by the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB), 
and balance using evaluation on a foam surface, with closed eyes, in the 
Modified Clinical Test of Sensory Integration. The SARC-F scale translated to 
Spanish and the consensus panels' criteria from European, international, and 
Asian sarcopenia working groups were applied to evaluate sarcopenia.
RESULTS: The Spanish language version of the SARC-F scale showed reliability 
(Cronbach alfa = 0.641. All items in the scale correlated to the scale's total 
score, rho = 0.43 to 0.76), temporal consistency evaluated by test-retest (CCI = 
0.80), criterion validity when compared to the consensus panels' criteria (high 
specificity and negative predictive values). The scale was also correlated to 
other measures related to sarcopenia (such as age, quality of life, self-rated 
health status, cognition, dependence in activities of daily living, nutritional 
status, depression, gait speed, grip strength, peak torque and power for knee 
extension, SPPB, balance, SMI, and frailty).
CONCLUSION: The SARC-F scale was successfully adapted to Spanish language and 
validated in community-dwelling Mexican older adults.

BACKGROUND:  In the United States, >40% of people infected with human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) smoke cigarettes.
METHODS:  We used a computer simulation of HIV disease and treatment to project 
the life expectancy of HIV-infected persons, based on smoking status. We used 
age- and sex-specific data on mortality, stratified by smoking status. The ratio 
of the non-AIDS-related mortality risk for current smokers versus that for never 
smokers was 2.8, and the ratio for former smokers versus never smokers was 
1.0-1.8, depending on cessation age. Projected survival was based on smoking 
status, sex, and initial age. We also estimated the total potential life-years 
gained if a proportion of the approximately 248 000 HIV-infected US smokers quit 
smoking.
RESULTS:  Men and women entering HIV care at age 40 years (mean CD4+ T-cell 
count, 360 cells/µL) who continued to smoke lost 6.7 years and 6.3 years of life 
expectancy, respectively, compared with never smokers; those who quit smoking 
upon entering care regained 5.7 years and 4.6 years, respectively. Factors 
associated with greater benefits from smoking cessation included younger age, 
higher initial CD4+ T-cell count, and complete adherence to antiretroviral 
therapy. Smoking cessation by 10%-25% of HIV-infected smokers could save 
approximately 106 000-265 000 years of life.
CONCLUSIONS:  HIV-infected US smokers aged 40 years lose >6 years of life 
expectancy from smoking, possibly outweighing the loss from HIV infection 
itself. Smoking cessation should become a priority in HIV treatment programs.

BACKGROUND/AIM: Most patients with multiple brain metastases from melanoma 
receive whole-brain irradiation. In a previous study, doses >30 Gy resulted in 
better outcomes than 10×3 Gy. However, the optimal dose-fractionation regimen 
has not yet been defined. This study compared 20×2 Gy over four weeks, which was 
used in the previous study, to 12×3 Gy over two-and-a-half weeks.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eleven patients treated with 20×2 Gy for multiple brain 
metastases were compared to 12 patients treated with 12×3 Gy.
RESULTS: Intracerebral control rates at 6 and 12 months were 17% and 0% after 
20×2 Gy vs. 42% and 11% after 12×3 Gy (p=0.28). Survival rates at 6 and 12 
months were 36% and 9% after 20×2 Gy vs. 50% and 25% after 12×3 Gy (p=0.75).
CONCLUSION: The less time-consuming regimen 12x3 Gy appeared not inferior to 
20×2 Gy and a reasonable treatment option, particularly for patients with a 
limited life expectancy.

Hepatic function and pulmonary function are interrelated with failure of one 
organ system affecting the other. With improved therapies, patients with 
concomitant hepatic and pulmonary failure increasingly enjoy a good quality of 
life and life expectancy. Therefore, the prevalence of such patients is 
increasing with more presenting for both emergent and elective surgical 
procedures. Hypoxemia requires a thorough evaluation in patients with end-stage 
liver disease. The most common etiologies respond to appropriate therapy. 
Portopulmonary hypertension and hepatopulmonary syndrome are associated with 
increased perioperative morbidity and mortality. It is incumbent on the 
anesthesiologist to understand the physiology of liver failure and its early 
effect on pulmonary function to ensure a successful outcome.

With the threat of significant morbidity and mortality following an influenza 
pandemic, stockpiling of antiviral agents such as oseltamivir is recommended. 
Shelf-life extension was explored to maximize use of an existing stockpile. This 
analysis demonstrated that oseltamivir retains potency defined by United States 
Pharmacopeia acceptance criteria beyond the labeled expiration date.

BACKGROUND: Active surveillance (AS) is commonly used for men with low-risk 
prostate cancer (PCa). When life expectancy becomes too short for curative 
treatment to be beneficial, a change from AS to watchful waiting (WW) follows. 
Little is known about this change since it is rarely documented in medical 
records.
OBJECTIVE: To model transition from AS to WW and how this is affected by age and 
comorbidity among men with very low-risk PCa.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: National population-based healthcare 
registers were used for analysis.
OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Using data on PCa 
characteristics, age, and comorbidity, a state transition model was created to 
estimate the probability of changes between predefined treatments to estimate 
transition from AS to WW.
RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Our estimates indicate that 48% of men with very 
low-risk PCa starting AS eventually changed to WW over a life course. This 
proportion increased with age at time of AS initiation. Within 10 yr from start 
of AS, 10% of men aged 55 yr and 50% of men aged 70 yr with no comorbidity at 
initiation changed to WW. Our prevalence simulation suggests that the number of 
men on WW who were previously on AS will eventually stabilise after 30 yr. A 
limitation is the limited information from clinical follow-up visits (eg, repeat 
biopsies).
CONCLUSIONS: We estimated that changes from AS to WW become common among men 
with very low-risk PCa who are elderly. This potential change to WW should be 
discussed with men starting on AS. Moreover, our estimates may help in planning 
health care resources allocated to men on AS, as the transition to WW is 
associated with lower demands on outpatient resources.
PATIENT SUMMARY: Changes from active surveillance to watchful waiting will 
become more common among men with very low-risk prostate cancer. These 
observations suggest that patients need to be informed about this potential 
change before they start on active surveillance.

In this study, the potential price for a therapeutic vaccine against Human 
Papilloma Virus (HPV)-16 & 18 (pre)-malignant cervical lesions is examined. A 
decision tree model was built in the context of the new Dutch cervical 
cancer-screening program and includes a primary test for the presence of HPV. 
Based on data of cervical cancer screening and HPV prevalence in the 
Netherlands, cohorts were created with HPV-16 or 18 positive women with cervical 
intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 2 or 3 or cervical cancer stage 1A (FIGO 1A). In 
the base case, the vaccine price was based on equal numbers of effective 
treatments in the vaccine branch and the current treatments branch of the model, 
and parity in cost, i.e. total cost in both branches are the same. The vaccine 
price is calculated by subtracting the cost of the vaccine branch from cost in 
the standard treatment branch and divided by the total number of women in the 
cohort, thereby equalizing costs in both strategies. Scenario analyses were 
performed taking quality adjusted life years (QALYs) into account with 
€20,000/QALY, €50,000/QALY and €80,000/QALY as corresponding thresholds. 
Sensitivity analyses were specifically targeted at the characteristics of the 
type-specific HPV test in the screening practice and vaccine efficacy. A 
probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) was performed to quantify the level of 
uncertainty of the results found in the base case. In the base case, break-even 
vaccine prices of €381, €568 and €1697 were found for CIN 2, CIN 3 and FIGO 1A, 
respectively. The PSA showed vaccine pricing below €310, €490 and €1660 will be 
cost saving with a likelihood of 95% for CIN 2, CIN 3 and FIGO 1A, respectively. 
The vaccine price proved to be very sensitive for inclusion of QALY gains, 
including the HPV-type specific test into the Dutch screening practice and 
vaccine efficacy.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is an aggressive disease associated with 
a poor prognosis and high morbidity. Early diagnosis and complete tumor removal 
are still the principal factors extending life expectancy in PDAC patients. 
Here, the relationship of neurexophillin 1 (NXPH1) and NXPH2 expressions with 
clinicopathological parameters of PDAC was evaluated. Immunohistochemical 
analysis of NXPH1 and NXPH2 was performed in one tissue microarray of 96 
surgical specimens, including normal pancreatic duct tissue (n = 5), PDACs at 
various stages of differentiation (n = 77), and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors 
(n = 14). The intensity of both NXPH1 and NXPH2 staining was weak in only a 
small proportion of benign pancreatic ductal epithelial cells and was 
significantly higher in most PDAC specimens than in non-neoplastic pancreatic 
tissue specimens. However, no correlation of the expression of these PDAC 
biomarkers with tumor grades, T, N, and American Joint Committee on Cancer 
(AJCC) pathologic stages was established. Contrary to our expectation, the 
immunohistochemical results of NXPH1 and NXPH2 were inversely correlated with N 
stage in PDAC. NXPH1 and NXPH2 as PDAC biomarkers may be used to identify 
patients with this tumor, help delineate appropriate surgical margins, and 
identify lymph node metastasis in imaging studies.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the long-term cost-effectiveness of dapagliflozin (a 
novel sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitor) versus glimepiride (a widely 
used sulfonylurea), when applied as monotherapy in patients with type 2 diabetes 
mellitus (T2DM) in China.
METHODS: Literature screening, meta-analysis and indirect comparison were used 
to compare efficacy and safety between dapagliflozin and glimepiride. Direct 
medication costs and medical expenditure on treating diabetes related 
comorbidities were calculated based on published and local sources and reported 
in 2015 Chinese Renminbi (RMB). A discount rate of 3% was applied to both costs 
and health effects. The Cardiff model, an economic model designed to evaluate 
the cost-effectiveness of comparator therapies in diabetes, was used to generate 
outputs including macrovascular and microvascular complications, 
diabetes-specific mortality, costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) over 
a time horizon of 40 years from the health provider perspective. Univariate and 
probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to assess uncertainty in the 
model results.
RESULTS: Compared with glimepiride, patients on dapagliflozin gained 1.01 QALYs, 
at a cost saving of RMB 49,065 in our simulated cohort. This resulted in a cost 
saving of RMB 48,585 per QALY gained with dapagliflozin. The cost-effectiveness 
results were robust to various sensitivity analyses including probabilistic 
sensitivity analysis (PSA).
CONCLUSIONS: Compared with glimepiride, dapagliflozin as monotherapy for T2DM is 
a more cost-effective treatment for T2DM patients on monotherapy in China. The 
weight control has been identified as the major contributor for the higher 
cost-effectiveness of dapagliflozin.

Update on the endoscopic treatments for achalasia.

Achalasia is the most common primary motility disorder of the esophagus and 
presents as dysphagia to solids and liquids. It is characterized by impaired 
deglutitive relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter. High-resolution 
manometry allows for definitive diagnosis and classification of achalasia, with 
type II being the most responsive to therapy. Since no cure for achalasia 
exists, early diagnosis and treatment of the disease is critical to prevent 
end-stage disease. The central tenant of diagnosis is to first rule out 
mechanical obstruction due to stricture or malignancy, which is often 
accomplished by endoscopic and fluoroscopic examination. Therapeutic options 
include pneumatic dilation (PD), surgical myotomy, and endoscopic injection of 
botulinum toxin injection. Heller myotomy and PD are more efficacious than 
pharmacologic therapies and should be considered first-line treatment options. 
Per oral endoscopic myotomy (POEM) is a minimally-invasive endoscopic therapy 
that might be as effective as surgical myotomy when performed by a trained and 
experienced endoscopist, although long-term data are lacking. Overall, therapy 
should be individualized to each patient's clinical situation and based upon his 
or her risk tolerance, operative candidacy, and life expectancy. In instances of 
therapeutic failure or symptom recurrence re-treatment is possible and can 
include PD or POEM of the wall opposite the site of prior myotomy. Patients 
undergoing therapy for achalasia require counseling, as the goal of therapy is 
to improve swallowing and prevent late manifestations of the disease rather than 
to restore normal swallowing, which is unfortunately impossible.

REVIEW QUESTION/OBJECTIVE: The objective of this review is to describe and 
synthesize the experiences and perspectives of illness for patients living with 
both hemophilia and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).
BACKGROUND: Hemophilia is an inherited bleeding disorder caused by low 
concentrations of specific coagulation factors. There are two major types of 
this condition characterized by deficiencies of factor VIII (hemophilia A) and 
factor IX (hemophilia B). Bleeding occurs in hemophilia owing to failure of 
secondary hemostasis. The bleeding tendency is related to the measured 
concentration of the factor and is classified as mild, moderate, or severe. 
Severe hemophilia A and B is classified as repeated (as often as weekly) bleeds 
into joints and muscles. The main treatment is to arrest spontaneous and 
traumatic bleeds by prophylactic injection of factor concentrates or to prevent 
injury by restriction of exercise. Most people with severe hemophilia are on 
therapy at home with intravenous infusion of the relevant missing factor. Joint 
bleeds are painful, and the build up of blood is irritating to the synovial 
lining and damages joint tissue, so that adherence to hemophilia therapy is 
important.Global research in 18 countries reported that compliance with therapy 
by patients with hemophilia was low with self-injection adherence under 75% with 
as few as 53-65% of adults complying with therapy. Some of the most frequently 
cited factors affecting patients' compliance to therapy are as follows; 
inability to understand potential benefits (75%); denial (67%); interference 
with life style (62%); and lack of time (42%).The self-injection method of 
administering coagulation products became popular in the 1970s. In the early 
1980s, 1,432 patients with hemophilia in Japan were infected with HIV (human 
immunodeficiency virus) because of the use of untreated blood products 
contaminated with the HIV virus. In addition commercial factor concentrates, 
which are prepared from pools of 2 to 6000 liters of plasma obtained by 
plasmapheresis from paid donors, carries a much higher risk of transmission of 
hepatitis B or C or HIV. Acquired autoimmune disease or AIDS, which is caused by 
HIV was once an incurable and fatal disease. However the anti-retro virus 
therapy, from the commencement of protease inhibitor based therapy in 1996, has 
increased the life expectancy of HIV patients. Nevertheless, adherence to highly 
active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) medication by patients with hemophilia 
(66%-84%) is lower than that of patients with only HIV (98%) in Japan.Although 
the causes of low adherence of hemophilia therapy or HAART medication are 
considered to be associated with patient values, qualitative evidence of 
previous studies have not been synthesized We searched previous reviews and 
review protocols in the Cochrane Library, Joanna Briggs Institute Library (JBI), 
MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, JBI COnNECT+ protocols. Regarding hemophilia or HIV, 
there were 11 systematic reviews, 7 protocols, and 128 other reviews. We 
excluded the reviews that were randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of treatment 
effects or therapies, and quantitative research of quality of life (QOL). We 
also excluded children as they are supervised by their parents to maintain high 
adherence. After the title and abstract review, 15 reviews remained and upon 
reading the full articles, one protocol and nine narrative reviews were 
identified.The systematic review protocol of Shaibu et al. investigated HIV 
positive adult patients on HAART focusing on the experience of HIV positive 
patients with patients' lifestyles and beliefs about HIV/AIDS and HAART 
effectiveness, and the role these play in adherence. However, the review differs 
from this one in terms of classification of HIV positive adults by the route of 
infection such as iatrogenic and sexually transmitted infection. Taking the 
deferent rate of adherence of HAART in Japan into consideration, we will focus 
on the experience of hemophilic patients with HIV.There were also narrative 
reviews that were concerned with management and treatment of hemophilia; 
recommendations for assessment and follow-up for patients and caregivers and for 
health providers, co-morbidity and QOL in the aging patient, and psychosocial 
issues of hemophilic patients. However, these reviews did not describe the 
methods in detail such as search engines, inclusion and exclusion criteria, and 
number of studies included. Furthermore, there was a lack of patients' voice as 
evidence that composed each category. Strictly speaking, these were not 
systematic reviews but a narrative review or study related to sociology of 
knowledge.The systematic review of Cassis et al. is the most similar to our 
proposed systematic review. They identified studies evaluating psychological 
stressors in hemophilic patients to address psychological needs and to improve 
QOL. They mainly evaluated methodologies. The psychosocial stressors synthesized 
findings from 22 quantitative studies as well as 2 qualitative ones. However, 
the review differs from this one as they excluded studies related to the HIV 
epidemic. Additionally, the review was limited as only one search engine, 
PubMed, was used.The illness which patients with hemophilia and HIV experience 
has changed from incurable disease to a manageable one by the progress of 
medicine. A similar scenario might exist for young patients with other incurable 
diseases at this time. Therefore, synthesizing the patients' experiences of 
living with both hemophilia and HIV will help not only this patient group but 
also young patients with other incurable diseases. Furthermore, there are few 
studies of hemophilia patients as hemophilia is a rare disease. Thus, synthesis 
of qualitative evidence is critical to understand patient values.

BACKGROUND: Resuscitation and treatment of critically ill newborn infants is 
associated with relatively high mortality, morbidity and cost. Guidelines 
relating to resuscitation have traditionally focused on the best interests of 
infants. There are, however, limited resources available in the neonatal 
intensive care unit (NICU), meaning that difficult decisions sometimes need to 
be made. This study explores the intuitions of lay people (non-health 
professionals) regarding resource allocation decisions in the NICU.
METHODS: The study design was a cross-sectional quantitative survey, consisting 
of 20 hypothetical rationing scenarios. There were 119 respondents who entered 
the questionnaire, and 109 who completed it. The respondents were adult US and 
Indian participants of the online crowdsourcing platform Mechanical Turk. 
Respondents were asked to decide which of two infants to treat in a situation of 
scarce resources. Demographic characteristics, personality traits and political 
views were recorded. Respondents were also asked to respond to a widely cited 
thought experiment involving rationing.
RESULTS: The majority of respondents, in all except one scenario, chose the 
utilitarian option of directing treatment to the infant with the higher chance 
of survival, higher life expectancy, less severe disability, and less expensive 
treatment. As discrepancy between outcomes decreased, however, there was a 
statistically significant increase in egalitarian responses and decrease in 
utilitarian responses in scenarios involving chance of survival (P = 0.001), 
life expectancy (P = 0.0001), and cost of treatment (P = 0.01). In the classic 
'lifeboat' scenario, all but two respondents were utilitarian.
CONCLUSIONS: This survey suggests that in situations of scarcity and equal 
clinical need, non-health professionals support rationing of life-saving 
treatment based on probability of survival, duration of survival, cost of 
treatment or quality of life. However, where the difference in prognosis or cost 
is very small, non-health professionals preferred to give infants an equal 
chance of receiving treatment.
