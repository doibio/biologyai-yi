BACKGROUND: Past research in population health trends has shown that injuries 
form a substantial burden of population health loss. Regular updates to injury 
burden assessments are critical. We report Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2017 
Study estimates on morbidity and mortality for all injuries.
METHODS: We reviewed results for injuries from the GBD 2017 study. GBD 2017 
measured injury-specific mortality and years of life lost (YLLs) using the Cause 
of Death Ensemble model. To measure non-fatal injuries, GBD 2017 modelled 
injury-specific incidence and converted this to prevalence and years lived with 
disability (YLDs). YLLs and YLDs were summed to calculate disability-adjusted 
life years (DALYs).
FINDINGS: In 1990, there were 4 260 493 (4 085 700 to 4 396 138) injury deaths, 
which increased to 4 484 722 (4 332 010 to 4 585 554) deaths in 2017, while 
age-standardised mortality decreased from 1079 (1073 to 1086) to 738 (730 to 
745) per 100â000. In 1990, there were 354â064â302 (95% uncertainty interval: 
338â174â876 to 371 610 802) new cases of injury globally, which increased to 520 
710 288 (493 430 247 to 547 988 635) new cases in 2017. During this time, 
age-standardised incidence decreased non-significantly from 6824 (6534 to 7147) 
to 6763 (6412 to 7118) per 100â000. Between 1990 and 2017, age-standardised 
DALYs decreased from 4947 (4655 to 5233) per 100â000 to 3267 (3058 to 3505).
INTERPRETATION: Injuries are an important cause of health loss globally, though 
mortality has declined between 1990 and 2017. Future research in injury burden 
should focus on prevention in high-burden populations, improving data collection 
and ensuring access to medical care.

Medical assistance in dying (MAID) legislation in Canada followed much 
deliberation after the Supreme Court of Canada's ruling in Carter v. Canada 
Included in this deliberation was the Special Joint Committee on Physician 
Assisted Dying's recommendation to extend MAID legislation beyond the inclusion 
of adults to mature minors. Children's agency is a construct advanced within 
childhood studies literature which entails eliciting children's voices in order 
to recognise children as active participants in constructing their own 
childhoods. Using this framework, we consider the possible extension of MAID 
legislation to most minors. We highlight important questions regarding how 
insights from children's voices could be mobilised in the life or death context 
of MAID. We conclude that children's voices have the potential to help determine 
their eligibility for MAID; however, incorporating children's voices in the 
context of MAID requires careful consideration due to the complexity of voice.

INTRODUCTION: Inequalities in life expectancy and mortality by social 
deprivation in the general population of the United Kingdom are widening. For 
people with dementia, data on potential gradients in life expectancy and 
mortality by social deprivation are sparse. This study aimed to explore 
potential differentials in life expectancy and mortality in people with dementia 
according to social deprivation.
METHODS: Using The Health Improvement Network (THIN) primary care database, we 
included people with a diagnosis of dementia in the United Kingdom in 2000 to 
2016 and obtained data on age at death and mortality. Comparisons were made 
according to social deprivation quintiles adjusting for age at diagnosis.
RESULTS: Among 166,268 people with dementia there were no differences in life 
expectancy and mortality in the most deprived compared with the least deprived. 
This pattern has been stable during the study period, as no increasing 
inequalities in life expectancy and mortality according to social deprivation 
were found.
DISCUSSION: Contrary to the general population, there were limited inequalities 
in life expectancy and mortality according to social deprivation for people with 
dementia.

The Influence of Hand Dominance on the Degree of Deformities in Patients With 
Systemic Lupus Erythematosus and Jaccoud Arthropathy.

BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: Joint deformities in Jaccoud arthropathy (JA), associated 
with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), can lead to a reduction in articular 
function and an impaired quality of life. There is controversy in the literature 
as to whether hand dominance contributes to deformities observed in rheumatoid 
arthritis and other forms of rheumatism. The purpose of this study was to assess 
whether hand dominance has any influence on the degree of deformity or joint 
range of motion in patients with JA associated with SLE.
METHODS: This was a pilot cross-sectional study of 22 female patients (mean age, 
46.18 Â± 12.61 years) with both SLE and JA. Each patient's hand grip and hand and 
wrist joint range of motion were assessed by the same examiner. The Wilcoxon 
test was used to compare the median values of the angles and muscular strength 
found between the sides.
RESULTS: All the study participants were right-side dominant. The median muscle 
strength of the right and left hands was 13.25 kilogram-force (KgF) (range, 
7.00-18.00 KgF) and 10.50 KgF (range, 7.50-17.25 KgF), respectively. Both the 
fingers of the right and left hands had a median ulnar drift of 10.00Â°; however, 
their ranges differed (right, 4.50Â° to 20.00Â°; left: 0.00Â° to 15.50Â°). No 
statistically significant differences were found in the extension angulation of 
the proximal interphalangeal joints or the flexion of the distal interphalangeal 
joints of the second to fifth fingers, between the dominant and nondominant 
hands.
CONCLUSIONS: Hand dominance does not seem to influence the degree of JA 
deformities in patients with SLE.

The purpose of this study is to categorize various elements for the expectations 
for the future using factor analysis and identify association between categories 
of the subjective expectations for the future and mortality among middle-aged 
and older adults.Data from the Korean Longitudinal Study of Aging from 2006 to 
2016 was assessed using longitudinal data analysis and 9,844 research subjects 
were included at baseline in 2006. Our modeling approach was based on Cox 
proportional hazards models for mortality.We indicated 3 categories (individual 
factor, national factor, and combined factor) of 12 subjective expectations for 
the future using factor analysis. The negative expectations for the future of 
all factors [individual factor: hazard ratio (HR), 1.65, 95% confidence interval 
(CI), 1.41-1.93; national factor: HR, 1.20, 95% CI, 1.06-1.37; combined factor: 
HR, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.02-1.32] were more likely to have an increased risk of 
all-cause mortality than those in the positive expectations for the future. 
Older adults were more likely to be affected by negative expectations for the 
future in national factor compared to middle-aged adults (HR, 1.22; 95% CI, 
1.05-1.41).Increasing positive expectations for the future is an important 
consideration for improvement in health. Policy makers need to consider that 
changes of national policy would affect health in older adults.

We examined whether the co-occurrence of four behavioural risk factors (alcohol 
consumption, smoking, physical inactivity and obesity) is associated with 
disability-free and chronic disease-free life expectancy similarly in two 
longitudinal studies of ageing in England and the United States. Data were from 
17,351 individuals aged 50+ from the US Health and Retirement Study (HRS) and, 
10,388 from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA), from 2002 to 2013. 
Disability-free life expectancy was estimated using repeat measures of 
limitations with instrumental activities and activities of daily living and, 
chronic disease-free life expectancy was based on chronic health conditions. 
Multistate life table models were used to estimate sex-specific health 
expectancy at the ages of 50, 60 and 70. In both countries and at all ages, 
there was a clear gradient towards shorter health expectancy with increasing 
number of behavioural risk factors. Compared to people with 2+ behavioural risk 
factors, in both countries, those with no behavioural risk factors could expect 
to live up to 11 years longer without disability and, up to 12 years longer 
without chronic conditions. Individual and co-occurring behavioural risk factors 
were strongly associated with shorter healthy life expectancy in both countries, 
attesting to the robustness of the contribution of lifestyle factors on health 
expectancy.

BACKROUND/OBJECTIVE: Due to increasing prevalence of hearing loss and relaxation 
of candidacy criteria of cochlear implant (CI) supply, the number of 
implantations is likely to further increase. Statutory health insurances are 
facing ever more urgent financing challenges since CI treatment causes high 
life-long costs. Additionally, increasing life expectancy and earlier 
implantation may extend therapy time and cost. With every case being individual, 
this study aims to calculate the possible lifetime cost of unilateral CI 
treatment in adults including stochastic uncertainties.
METHODS: Taking a statutory health insurance perspective, relevant cost 
components of CI therapy and their values were identified. The Monte Carlo 
method was used to simulate lifetime cost considering age at first implantation 
and distributions of costrelevant variables. A sensitivity analysis was 
conducted to determine the most crucial variables impacting on lifetime cost.
RESULTS: Lifetime cost of CI treatment varies according to age at first 
implantation, respectively remaining lifetime; the earlier the implantation, the 
higher the overall cost. According to our simulation, the average lifetime cost 
for an adult patient first implanted between the age of 20-80 is at 53,030 â¬ 
(present value). Cost of implantation and periodic speech processor exchanges 
show the highest impact on the total cost.
DISCUSSION: Health care systems could face rising expenses for CI supply by 
technical development. Innovative life-long CIs could achieve significant 
savings per case that could finance additional implant cost. Until then, further 
targeted research will be required.
CONCLUSION: CI-related cost for statutory health insurance crucially depends on 
the patient-side demand for cochlear implants. Therefore, cost forecasts must 
also consider the development of demand.

PURPOSE: Although the post-bariatric clinical and physical changes are 
well-known, the psychosocial changes in patients' everyday life are less clear. 
Therefore, we tried to summarize comprehensively the currently available 
literature on the psychosocial changes of bariatric surgery (BS) by means of a 
scoping review.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The scoping review was conducted following the Arksey and 
O'Malley framework, the Joanna Briggs Institute Reviewer's Manual 2015, and the 
Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for 
Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) checklist. PubMed, EMBASE, and PsycINFO were 
searched for data dating from January 2008 through October 2019. Only gastric 
bypass and sleeve gastrectomy procedures were considered for this review. To 
explore and describe the essence of the experienced changes deeply, only 
qualitative studies were included. The synthesis was performed using the 
qualitative content analysis technique.
RESULTS: The literature search yielded 1420 unique records, and 1371 articles 
were eliminated on the basis of irrelevant title and/or abstract. Forty-nine 
full-text articles were reviewed. Ultimately, eight articles were included in 
this scoping review. The qualitative content analysis emerged in 12 categories, 
which were further condensed into three major thematic areas, namely, 
"subjective self-image," "interpersonal relationships," and "it's not all gold 
that glitters," which reflect the post-operative psychosocial changes.
CONCLUSION: A wide range of psychosocial changes occurs following bariatric 
surgery. To maintain the improvements and to prevent negative changes, long-term 
support by specially trained health professionals is crucial.
