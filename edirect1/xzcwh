Colorectal cancer is a widely-recognized aging-associated disease. Recent 
advances in the care of senior colorectal cancer patients has led to similar 
cancer-related life expectancy for older patients when compared to their younger 
counterparts. Recent data suggests that onco-geriatric patients place as much 
value on maintenance of functional independence and quality of life after 
treatment as they do on the potential improvements in survival that a treatment 
might offer. As a result, there has been significant interest in the geriatric 
literature surrounding the concept of "functional recovery," a multidimensional 
outcome metric that takes into account several domains, including physical, 
physiologic, psychological, social, and economic wellbeing. This review 
introduces the concept of functional recovery and highlights a number of 
predictors of post-treatment functional trajectory, including several 
office-based tools that clinicians can use to help guide informed decision 
making surrounding potential treatment options. This review also highlights a 
number of validated metrics that can be used to assess a patient's progress in 
functional recovery after surgery. While the timeline of each individual's 
functional recovery may vary, most data suggests that if patients are to return 
to their pre-operative functional status, this could occur up to 6 months 
post-surgery. For those patients identified to be at risk for post-operative 
functional decline this review also delineates strategies for prehabilitation 
and rehabilitation that may improve functional outcomes.

INTRODUCTION: Type 1 GM1 gangliosidosis is an ultra-rare, rapidly fatal 
lysosomal storage disorder, with life expectancy of <3 years of age. To date, 
only one prospective natural history study of limited size has been reported. 
Thus, there is a need for additional research to provide a better understanding 
of the progression of this disease. We have leveraged the past two decades of 
medical literature to conduct the first comprehensive retrospective study 
characterizing the natural history of Type 1 GM1 gangliosidosis.
OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were to establish a large sample of 
patients from the literature in order to identify: 1) clinically distinguishing 
factors between Type 1 and Type 2 GM1 gangliosidosis, 2) age at first symptom 
onset, first hospital admission, diagnosis, and death, 3) time to onset of 
common clinical findings, and 4) timing of developmental milestone loss.
METHODS: PubMed was searched with the keyword "GM1 Gangliosidosis" and for 
articles from the year 2000 onwards. A preliminary review of these results was 
conducted to establish subtype classification criteria for inclusion of only 
Type 1 patients, resulting in 44 articles being selected to generate the 
literature dataset of 154 Type 1 GM1 gangliosidosis patients. Key clinical 
events of these patient cases were recorded from the articles.
RESULTS: Comprehensive subtyping criteria for Type 1 GM1 gangliosidosis were 
created, and clinical events, including onset, diagnosis, death, and 
symptomology, were mapped over time. In this dataset, average age of diagnosis 
was 8.7 months, and average age of death was 18.9 months.
DISCUSSION: This analysis demonstrates the predictable clinical course of this 
disease, as almost all patients experienced significant multi-organ system 
dysfunction and neurodevelopmental regression, particularly in the 6- to 
18-month age range. Patients were diagnosed at a late age relative to disease 
progression, indicating the need for improved public awareness and screening.
CONCLUSION: This study highlights the significant burden of illness in this 
disease and provides critical natural history data to drive earlier diagnosis, 
inform clinical trial design, and facilitate family counseling.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to describe and clarify the factors 
affecting the prognosis of Japanese patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 
(ALS) undergoing tracheostomy invasive ventilation (TIV) therapy.
METHODS: We conducted a prospective longitudinal observational case-control 
study using a multicentre registry. ALS patients who started TIV therapy after 
registration (TIV group) and those who did not receive TIV (non-TIV group) were 
included. We compared the survival time between the TIV group and the non-TIV 
group using a propensity score matching analysis and evaluated the prognostic 
factors in the TIV group.
RESULTS: From February 2006 to January 2018, 190 patients in the TIV group and 
1093 patients in the non-TIV group were included in this study. The mean age of 
disease onset and usage rate of gastrostomy and non-invasive ventilation therapy 
differed between the groups. In the propensity score matching analysis using 
known prognostic factors, the median overall survival time of the TIV group was 
significantly greater than that of the non-TIV group (11.33 years vs 4.61 years; 
p<0.001). Analysis using the Cox proportional hazard model suggested that older 
age of onset and respiratory onset was an independent factor for poor prognosis 
after starting TIV therapy.
CONCLUSION: We showed that there was a significant difference of approximately 7 
years in life expectancy between Japanese ALS patients who did and did not 
receive TIV therapy.

INTRODUCTION: Depression is among the most widespread psychiatric disorders in 
France. Psychiatric disorders are associated with considerable social costs, 
amounting to €22.6 billion for treatment and psychotropic medication in 2011. 
Treatment as usual (TAU), mainly consisting of pharmacotherapy and 
psychotherapy, is effective for only a third of patients and in most cases fails 
to prevent treatment resistance and chronicity. Transcranial direct current 
stimulation (tDCS) consists in a non-invasive and painless application of 
low-intensity electric current to the cerebral cortex through the scalp. Having 
proved effective in depressed patients, it could be used in combination with TAU 
to great advantage. The objective is to compare, for the first time ever, the 
cost-utility of tDCS-TAU and of TAU alone for the treatment of a depressive 
episode that has been refractory to one or two drug treatments.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This paper, based on the DISCO study protocol, focuses on 
the design of a prospective, randomised, controlled, open-label multicentre 
economic study to be conducted in France. It will include 214 patients with 
unipolar or bipolar depression, assigning them to two parallel arms: group A 
(tDCS-TAU) and group B (TAU alone). The primary outcome is the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio, that is, the ratio of the difference in cost between 
each strategy to the difference in their effects. Their effects will be 
expressed as numbers of quality-adjusted life-years, determined through 
administration of the EuroQol Five-Dimension questionnaire over a 12-month 
period to patients (EQ-5D-5L). Expected benefits are the reduction of treatment 
resistance and suicidal ideation as well as social and professional costs of 
depression. Should depression-related costs fall significantly, tDCS might be 
considered an efficient treatment for depression.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This protocol has been approved by a French ethics 
committee, the CPP--Est IV (Comité de Protection des Personnes-Strasbourg). Data 
are to be published in peer-reviewed medical journals.

BACKGROUND: Recent evidence has shown that many patients suffer from persistent 
pain and impaired function after primary or revision total knee arthroplasty 
(TKA). Post-surgical complications may in addition decrease physical 
performances and lead to more pain and impacted quality of life.The purpose of 
the study was to assess the changes in pain intensity and functional capacity 
among patients with post-surgical complications after TKA three weeks of 
intensive, personalized multimodal rehabilitation.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort study consisting of 217 patient of which 166 had 
primary TKA and 51 had revision TKA was conducted. On average, primary TKA 
patients and revision TKA patients were 3.7 and 2.7 months post-surgical, 
respectively. All patients have had post-surgical complications and were 
referred to an inpatient rehabilitation department, where they received a 
personalized three-week intensive, multimodal rehabilitation protocol. The 
rehabilitation consisted of sessions targeting neuromuscular function, postural 
control, and flexibility, sessions focusing on improving muscle strength and 
cardiovascular function and sessions with focus on gait retraining. The 
frequency of training was 2-4 sessions/day. The primary outcome was the Knee 
injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) and secondary outcomes were pain 
intensities measured using numerical rating scale, 6 min. walking test, 
stair-climbing test and range of motion for knee flexion and extension. Outcome 
measures were assessed at baseline upon referral and at follow-up before 
discharge.
RESULTS: All outcomes, except pain at rest in the revision group, improved 
significantly. KOOS subscales, improved 8.5 to 14.2 in the primary TKA group 
(p < 0.001) and 6.9 to 10.8 in the revision group (p < 0.001). For the TKA 
group, effect sizes were medium-to-large for all KOOS subscales, 6 min. walking 
test, stair-climbing test, and pain intensity during activity. For the revision 
group, effect sizes were medium-to-large for KOOS subscales symptoms and 
activity of daily living, 6 min. walking test, stair-climbing test, and knee 
flexion.
CONCLUSION: Patients with post-surgical complications after primary or revision 
TKA experienced clinical relevant improvement in self-reported outcomes, pain 
relief, and improved physical performances after three weeks of personalized 
multimodal rehabilitation. The results suggest that an intensive, multimodal 
approach might be useful to obtain clinically relevant improvements.

Acromegaly is an insidious disease, usually resulting from growth hormone 
hypersecretion by a pituitary adenoma. It is most often diagnosed during the 3rd 
to 4th decade of life. However, recent studies have shown an increase in the 
incidence and prevalence of acromegaly in the elderly, probably due to 
increasing life expectancy. As in the younger population with acromegaly, there 
is a delay in diagnosis, aggravated by the similarities of the aging process 
with some of the characteristics of the disease. As can be expected elderly 
patients with acromegaly have a higher prevalence of comorbidities than younger 
ones. The diagnostic criteria are the same as for younger patients. Surgical 
treatment of the pituitary adenoma is the primary therapy of choice unless 
contraindicated. Somatostatin receptor ligands are generally effective as both 
primary and postoperative treatment. The prognosis correlates inversely with the 
patient's age, disease duration and last GH level. Arch Endocrinol Metab.

BACKGROUND: We examined socioeconomic inequalities in disability-free life 
expectancy in older men and women from England and the United States and 
explored whether people in England can expect to live longer and healthier lives 
than those in the United States.
METHODS: We used harmonized data from the Gateway to Global Aging Data on 14,803 
individuals aged 50+ from the U.S. Health and Retirement Study (HRS) and 10,754 
from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA). Disability was measured in 
terms of impaired activities and instrumental activities of daily living. We 
used discrete-time multistate life table models to estimate total life 
expectancy and life expectancy free of disability.
RESULTS: Socioeconomic inequalities in disability-free life expectancy were of a 
similar magnitude (in absolute terms) in England and the United States. The 
socioeconomic disadvantage in disability-free life expectancy was largest for 
wealth, in both countries: people in the poorest group could expect to live 
seven to nine fewer years without disability than those in the richest group at 
the age of 50.
CONCLUSIONS: Inequalities in healthy life expectancy exist in both countries and 
are of similar magnitude. In both countries, efforts in reducing health 
inequalities should target people from disadvantaged socioeconomic groups.

Non-dermatological Challenges of Chronic Itch.

Kremer AE, Mettang T, Weisshaar E.

Chronic itch occurs in many skin diseases, but also in a variety of systemic, 
neurological, and psychogenic/psychosomatic disorders, or is caused by drug 
intake. When several diseases or causes co-exist, chronic itch is categorized as 
"mixed origin". These patients present with unaltered skin or with chronic 
scratch lesions including chronic prurigo. Precise diagnostics are necessary to 
evaluate the underlying aetiology, to enable identification of the best 
treatment available, and to improve patients' quality of life. This is of 
particular relevance in elderly people in whom chronic itch is often of systemic 
or mixed origin. Xerosis cutis is a frequent cofactor contributing to chronic 
itch of non-dermatological origin. Treatment is frequently multimodal, 
considering age, comorbidities, current drug intake, quality and intensity of 
itch. With regard to the demographic situation of the population, characterized 
by increasing life expectancy and polypharmacy, itch of non-dermatological 
origin will represent an increasing medical challenge in the future.

Socioeconomic disparities in life and health expectancy among the household 
population in Canada.

BACKGROUND: Life expectancy (LE) and health expectancy have increased throughout 
much of the world. However, these gains have not been shared equally across all 
population groups. Socioeconomic disparities exist, though varied methodologies 
and data sources have made it difficult to ascertain changes over time in 
Canada.
DATA AND METHODS: The 1996 and 2011 Canadian Census Health and Environment 
Cohorts, with a five-year mortality follow-up, were used to estimate the LE of 
the household population at ages 25 and 65, according to individual-level 
education and income. Health status was measured by the Health Utilities Index 
Mark 3 instrument in two national population health surveys and was used to 
adjust LE to estimate health-adjusted life expectancy (HALE). Disparities in LE 
and HALE, and differences between cohorts, were examined.
RESULTS: LE, HALE and the ratio of HALE to LE were greater at higher levels of 
education or income. A stepwise gradient was also observed by level of education 
within and across income quintiles, with people in the lowest combined education 
and income categories at the greatest disadvantage. Disparities were wider in 
the 2011 cohort compared with the 1996 cohort, but not necessarily to the same 
extent for both sexes or at different ages.
DISCUSSION: In Canada, education-related and income-related disparities in life 
and health expectancy persist and may be wider than they were in the past. This 
underscores the importance of ongoing data development for routine monitoring of 
trends in mortality and morbidity, which can, in turn, inform policy development 
and planning to advance health equity.

Estimating the impact of drug use on US mortality, 1999-2016.

America.

The impact of rising drug use on US mortality may extend beyond deaths coded as 
drug-related to include excess mortality from other causes affected by drug use. 
Here, we estimate the full extent of drug-associated mortality. We use annual 
death rates for 1999-2016 by state, sex, five-year age group, and cause of death 
to model the relationship between drug-coded mortality-which serves as an 
indicator of the population-level prevalence of drug use-and mortality from 
other causes. Among residents aged 15-64 living in the 50 US states, the 
estimated number of drug-associated deaths in 2016 (141,695) was 2.2 times the 
number of drug-coded deaths (63,000). Adverse trends since 2010 in midlife 
mortality are largely attributable to drug-associated mortality. In the absence 
of drug use, we estimate that the probability of dying between ages 15 and 65 
would have continued to decline after 2010 among men (to 15% in 2016) and would 
have remained at a low level (10%) among women. Our results suggest that an 
additional 3.9% of men and 1.8% of women died between ages 15 and 65 in 2016 
because of drug use. In terms of life expectancy beyond age 15, we estimate that 
drug use cost men 1.4 years and women 0.7 years, on average. In the hardest-hit 
state (West Virginia), drug use cost men 3.6 and women 1.9 life years. Recent 
declines in US life expectancy have been blamed largely on the drug epidemic. 
Consistent with that inference, our results imply that, in the absence of drug 
use, life expectancy at age 15 would have increased slightly between 2014 and 
2016. Drug-associated mortality in the US is roughly double that implied by 
drug-coded deaths alone. The drug epidemic is exacting a heavy cost to American 
lives, not only from overdoses but from a variety of causes.

The enzymatic synthesis of polyesters in solventless systems is an 
environmentally friendly and sustainable method for synthetizing bio-derived 
materials. Despite the greenness of the technique, in most cases only short 
oligoesters are obtained, with limited practical applications or requiring 
further chemical processing for their elongation. In this work, we present a 
catalyst-free thermal upgrade of enzymatically synthesized oligoesters. 
Different aliphatic and aromatic oligoesters were synthesized using immobilized 
Candida antarctica lipase B (iCaLB) as the catalyst (70 °C, 24 h) yielding 
poly(1,4-butylene adipate) (PBA, Mw = 2200), poly(1,4-butylene isophthalate) 
(PBI, Mw = 1000), poly(1,4-butylene 2,5-furandicarboxylate) (PBF, Mw = 600), and 
poly(1,4-butylene 2,4-pyridinedicarboxylate) (PBP, Mw = 1000). These polyesters 
were successfully thermally treated to obtain an increase in Mw of 8.5, 2.6, 
3.3, and 2.7 folds, respectively. This investigation focused on the most 
successful upgrade, poly(1,4-butylene adipate), then discussed the possible 
effect of di-ester monomers as compared to di-acids in the thermally driven 
polycondensation. The herein-described two-step synthesis method represents a 
practical and cost-effective way to synthesize higher-molecular-weight polymers 
without the use of toxic metal catalysts such as titanium(IV) tert-butoxide, 
tin(II) 2-ethylhexanoate, and in particular, antimony(IV) oxide. At the same 
time, the method allows for the extension of the number of reuses of the 
biocatalyst by preventing its exposure to extreme denaturating conditions.

Aging is one of the hottest topics in biomedical research. Advances in research 
and medicine have helped to preserve human health, leading to an extension of 
life expectancy. However, the extension of life is an irreversible process that 
is accompanied by the development of aging-related conditions such as weakness, 
slower metabolism, and stiffness of vessels. It also debated that aging can be 
considered an actual disease with aging-derived comorbidities, including cancer 
or cardiovascular disease. Currently, cardiovascular disorders, including 
atherosclerosis, are considered as premature aging and represent the first 
causes of death in developed countries, accounting for 31% of annual deaths 
globally. Emerging evidence has identified hypoxia-inducible factor-1α as a 
critical transcription factor with an essential role in aging-related pathology, 
in particular, regulating cellular senescence associated with cardiovascular 
aging. In this review, we will focus on the regulation of senescence mediated by 
hypoxia-inducible factor-1α in age-related pathologies, with particular emphasis 
on the crosstalk between endothelial and vascular cells in age-associated 
atherosclerotic lesions. More specifically, we will focus on the characteristics 
and mechanisms by which cells within the vascular wall, including endothelial 
and vascular cells, achieve a senescent phenotype.

BACKGROUND: Falls can lead to severe health loss including death. Past research 
has shown that falls are an important cause of death and disability worldwide. 
The Global Burden of Disease Study 2017 (GBD 2017) provides a comprehensive 
assessment of morbidity and mortality from falls.
METHODS: Estimates for mortality, years of life lost (YLLs), incidence, 
prevalence, years lived with disability (YLDs) and disability-adjusted life 
years (DALYs) were produced for 195 countries and territories from 1990 to 2017 
for all ages using the GBD 2017 framework. Distributions of the bodily injury 
(eg, hip fracture) were estimated using hospital records.
RESULTS: Globally, the age-standardised incidence of falls was 2238 (1990-2532) 
per 100 000 in 2017, representing a decline of 3.7% (7.4 to 0.3) from 1990 to 
2017. Age-standardised prevalence was 5186 (4622-5849) per 100 000 in 2017, 
representing a decline of 6.5% (7.6 to 5.4) from 1990 to 2017. Age-standardised 
mortality rate was 9.2 (8.5-9.8) per 100 000 which equated to 695 771 (644 
927-741 720) deaths in 2017. Globally, falls resulted in 16 688 088 (15 101 
897-17 636 830) YLLs, 19 252 699 (13 725 429-26 140 433) YLDs and 35 940 787 (30 
185 695-42 903 289) DALYs across all ages. The most common injury sustained by 
fall victims is fracture of patella, tibia or fibula, or ankle. Globally, 
age-specific YLD rates increased with age.
CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that the burden of falls is substantial. Investing 
in further research, fall prevention strategies and access to care is critical.

BACKGROUND: Our main goal was to evaluate the pattern and time course of changes 
in relative muscle power and its constituting components throughout the life 
span.
METHODS: A total of 1,305 subjects (729 women and 576 men; aged 20-93 years) 
participating in the Copenhagen Sarcopenia Study took part. Body mass index 
(BMI), leg lean mass assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), and leg 
extension muscle power (LEP) assessed by the Nottingham power rig were recorded. 
Relative muscle power (normalized to body mass) and specific muscle power 
(normalized to leg lean mass) were calculated. Segmented regression analyses 
were used to identify the onset and pattern of age-related changes in the 
recorded variables.
RESULTS: Relative muscle power began to decline above the age of 40 in both 
women and men, with women showing an attenuation of the decline above 75 years. 
Relative muscle power decreased with age due to (i) the loss of absolute LEP 
after the fourth decade of life and (ii) the increase in BMI up to the age of 75 
years in women and 65 years in men. The decline in absolute LEP was caused by a 
decline in specific LEP up to the age of 75 in women and 65 in men, above which 
the loss in relative leg lean mass also contributed.
CONCLUSIONS: Relative power decreased (i) above 40 years by the loss in absolute 
power (specific power only) and the increase in body mass, and (ii) above ~70 
years by the loss in absolute power (both specific power and leg lean mass).

INTRODUCTION: Smoking contributes substantially to mortality levels and trends. 
Its role in country differences in mortality has, however, hardly been 
quantified. The current study formally assesses the-so far unknown-changing 
contribution of smoking to country differences in life expectancy at birth (e0) 
across Europe.
METHODS: Using all-cause mortality data and indirectly estimated 
smoking-attributable mortality rates by age and sex for 30 European countries 
from 1985 to 2014, the differences in e0 between each individual European 
country and the weighted average were decomposed into a smoking- and a 
nonsmoking-related part.
RESULTS: In 2014, e0 ranged from 70.8 years in Russia to 83.1 years in 
Switzerland. Men exhibited larger country differences than women (variance of 
21.9 and 7.0 years, respectively). Country differences in e0 increased up to 
2005 and declined thereafter. Among men, the average contribution of smoking to 
the country differences in e0 was highest around 1990 (47%) and declined to 35% 
in 2014. Among women, the average relative contribution of smoking declined from 
1991 to 2011, and smoking resulted in smaller differences with the average e0 
level in the majority of European countries. For both sexes combined, the 
contribution of smoking to country differences in e0 was higher than 20% 
throughout the period.
CONCLUSIONS: Smoking contributed substantially to the country differences in e0 
in Europe, their increases up to 1991, and their decreases since 2005, 
especially among men. Policies that discourage smoking can help to reduce 
inequalities in mortality levels across Europe in the long run.
IMPLICATIONS: Smoking contributes substantially to country differences in life 
expectancy at birth (e0) in Europe, particularly among men, for whom the 
contribution was highest around 1990 (47%) and declined to 35% in 2014. In line 
with the anticipated progression of the smoking epidemic, the differences 
between European countries in e0 due to smoking are expected to further decline 
among men, but to increase among women. The role of smoking in mortality 
convergence since 2005 illustrates that smoking policies can help to reduce 
inequalities in life expectancy levels across Europe, particularly when they 
target smoking in countries with low e0.

Objectives. To characterize health and health-related resources in the new 
qualified opportunity zones (QOZs) relative to tracts not selected or not 
eligible for this federal investment incentive.Methods. We used tract-level data 
from the 498 largest cities in the contiguous United States (n = 24 409), 
categorized using designations from the Department of Treasury. We compiled data 
on population characteristics, health-related resources, and health from the 
American Community Survey, the National Establishment Time Series, the National 
Land Cover Dataset, and the US Small-Area Life Expectancy Estimates Project and 
the 500 Cities projects. We calculated means and SDs for ineligible, eligible 
(but not designated), and designated QOZ tracts.Results. In general, designated 
QOZ tracts had lower access to health care facilities, physical activity 
resources, and healthy food. They had a higher prevalence of unhealthy behaviors 
and worse health outcomes across most measures.Conclusions. By benchmarking 
conditions, we facilitate tracking and assessment of QOZ impacts.Public Health 
Implications. QOZ could spur unprecedented neighborhood change with substantial 
influence on health resources and outcomes. Public health collaboration and 
strategic local governance of QOZ will be crucial for yielding health benefits 
for existing residents.

Cost-effectiveness of alectinib compared to crizotinib for the treatment of 
first-line ALK+ advanced non-small-cell lung cancer in France.

The aim of the study is to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of alectinib for 
first-line treatment of ALK+ advanced non-small-cell lung cancer compared to 
crizotinib in the French setting. This study used a partitioned survival model, 
with three discrete health states (progression-free survival, post-progression 
survival and death). Survival probabilities were derived from a randomised Phase 
III clinical trial comparing alectinib to crizotinib (ALEX). Beyond the length 
of the trial (18 months), the efficacy of both treatments was considered 
equivalent. Occurrence of adverse events or brain metastases were considered as 
inter-current events. Utilities (and disutilities for intercurrent adverse 
events) derived from the EQ-5D were applied. Costs were attributed using 
standard French national public health tariffs. Projected mean overall survival 
was 4.62 years for alectinib and 4.18 years for crizotinib. Projected mean 
progression-free survival was 30.30 months for alectinib and 16.13 months for 
crizotinib. The total number of quality-adjusted life years projected was 3.40 
for alectinib and 2.84 for crizotinib. The projected total cost of treatment 
over the lifetime of the model was € 246,022 for alectinib and € 195,486 for 
crizotinib. This extra cost was principally attributable to treatment 
acquisition costs and management before progression. Alectinib was associated 
with lower costs related to brain metastases and to management post-progression. 
The incremental cost per life year gained was 115,334 €/year and the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio was 90,232 €/QALY. First-line treatment of ALK+ NSCLC 
with alectinib provides superior clinical outcomes to crizotinib and is 
cost-effective in the French context.

AIM: Although evidence supports brief, frequent CPR training, optimal training 
intervals have not been established. The purpose of this study was to compare 
nursing students' CPR skills (compressions and ventilations) with 4 different 
spaced training intervals: daily, weekly, monthly, and quarterly, each for 4 
times in a row.
METHODS: Participants were nursing students (n = 475) in the first year of their 
prelicensure program in 10 schools of nursing across the United States. They 
were randomly assigned into the 4 training intervals in each of the schools. 
Students were trained in CPR on a Laerdal Resusci Anne adult manikin on the 
Resuscitation Quality Improvement (RQI) mobile simulation station. The outcome 
measures were quality of compressions and ventilations as measured by the RQI 
program.
RESULTS: Although students were all certified in Basic Life Support prior to the 
study, they were not able to adequately perform compressions and ventilations at 
pretest. Overall compression scores improved from sessions 1 to 4 in all 
training intervals (all p < .001), but shorter intervals (daily training) 
resulted in larger increases in compression scores by session 4. There were 
similar findings for ventilation skills, but at session 4, both daily and weekly 
intervals led to better skill performance.
CONCLUSION: For students and other novices learning to perform CPR, the 
opportunity to train on consecutive days or weeks may be beneficial: if learners 
are aware of specific errors in performance, it may be easier for them to 
correct performance and refine skills when there is less time in between 
practice sessions.
