AIMS: To conduct a cost-utility analysis comparing stereotactic body 
radiotherapy (SBRT) with low dose rate brachytherapy (LDR-BT) for localised 
prostate cancer (PCa).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A decision-analytic Markov model was developed from the 
healthcare payer perspective to simulate the history of a 66-year-old man with 
low-risk PCa. The model followed patients yearly over their remaining lifetimes. 
Health states included 'recurrence-free', 'biochemical recurrence' (BR), 
'metastatic' and 'death'. Transition probabilities were based on a retrospective 
cohort analysis undertaken at our institution. Utilities were derived from the 
literature. Costs were assigned in 2015 Canadian dollars ($) and reflected 
Ontario's health system and departmental costs. Outcomes included 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), costs and incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratios. A willingness-to-pay threshold of $50 000/QALY was used.
RESULTS: SBRT was the dominant strategy with 0.008LYs and 0.029QALYs gained and 
a reduction in cost of $2615. Under base case conditions, our results were 
sensitive to the BR probability associated with both strategies. LDR-BT becomes 
the preferred strategy if the BR with SBRT is 1.3*[baseline BR_SBRT] or if the 
BR with LDR-BT is 0.76*[baseline BR_LDR-BT]. When assuming the same BR for both 
strategies, LDR-BT becomes marginally more effective with 0.009QALYs gained at a 
cost of $272 848/QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: SBRT represents an economically attractive radiation strategy. 
Further research should be carried out to provide longer-term follow-up and 
high-quality evidence.

BACKGROUND: The UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are grounded in the 
global ambition of "leaving no one behind". Understanding today's gains and gaps 
for the health-related SDGs is essential for decision makers as they aim to 
improve the health of populations. As part of the Global Burden of Diseases, 
Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2016 (GBD 2016), we measured 37 of the 50 
health-related SDG indicators over the period 1990-2016 for 188 countries, and 
then on the basis of these past trends, we projected indicators to 2030.
METHODS: We used standardised GBD 2016 methods to measure 37 health-related 
indicators from 1990 to 2016, an increase of four indicators since GBD 2015. We 
substantially revised the universal health coverage (UHC) measure, which focuses 
on coverage of essential health services, to also represent personal health-care 
access and quality for several non-communicable diseases. We transformed each 
indicator on a scale of 0-100, with 0 as the 2·5th percentile estimated between 
1990 and 2030, and 100 as the 97·5th percentile during that time. An index 
representing all 37 health-related SDG indicators was constructed by taking the 
geometric mean of scaled indicators by target. On the basis of past trends, we 
produced projections of indicator values, using a weighted average of the 
indicator and country-specific annualised rates of change from 1990 to 2016 with 
weights for each annual rate of change based on out-of-sample validity. 24 of 
the currently measured health-related SDG indicators have defined SDG targets, 
against which we assessed attainment.
FINDINGS: Globally, the median health-related SDG index was 56·7 (IQR 31·9-66·8) 
in 2016 and country-level performance markedly varied, with Singapore (86·8, 95% 
uncertainty interval 84·6-88·9), Iceland (86·0, 84·1-87·6), and Sweden (85·6, 
81·8-87·8) having the highest levels in 2016 and Afghanistan (10·9, 9·6-11·9), 
the Central African Republic (11·0, 8·8-13·8), and Somalia (11·3, 9·5-13·1) 
recording the lowest. Between 2000 and 2016, notable improvements in the UHC 
index were achieved by several countries, including Cambodia, Rwanda, Equatorial 
Guinea, Laos, Turkey, and China; however, a number of countries, such as Lesotho 
and the Central African Republic, but also high-income countries, such as the 
USA, showed minimal gains. Based on projections of past trends, the median 
number of SDG targets attained in 2030 was five (IQR 2-8) of the 24 defined 
targets currently measured. Globally, projected target attainment considerably 
varied by SDG indicator, ranging from more than 60% of countries projected to 
reach targets for under-5 mortality, neonatal mortality, maternal mortality 
ratio, and malaria, to less than 5% of countries projected to achieve targets 
linked to 11 indicator targets, including those for childhood overweight, 
tuberculosis, and road injury mortality. For several of the health-related SDGs, 
meeting defined targets hinges upon substantially faster progress than what most 
countries have achieved in the past.
INTERPRETATION: GBD 2016 provides an updated and expanded evidence base on where 
the world currently stands in terms of the health-related SDGs. Our improved 
measure of UHC offers a basis to monitor the expansion of health services 
necessary to meet the SDGs. Based on past rates of progress, many places are 
facing challenges in meeting defined health-related SDG targets, particularly 
among countries that are the worst off. In view of the early stages of SDG 
implementation, however, opportunity remains to take actions to accelerate 
progress, as shown by the catalytic effects of adopting the Millennium 
Development Goals after 2000. With the SDGs' broader, bolder development agenda, 
multisectoral commitments and investments are vital to make the health-related 
SDGs within reach of all populations.

BACKGROUND: Gap balancing (GB) has been noted to sacrifice joint-line 
maintenance to improve gap symmetry. This study aims to determine whether this 
change affects function or quality of life in the midterm.
METHODS: A prospective blinded randomized controlled trial was completed with 
103 patients randomized to measured resection (n = 52) or GB (n = 51). Primary 
outcome measured was femoral component rotation. Secondary outcomes measured 
were joint-line change, gap symmetry, and function and quality-of-life outcomes.
RESULTS: At 5 years, 83 of 103 patients (85%) were assessed. There was no 
significant difference between groups in terms of functional or quality of life 
outcomes. A subgroup analysis revealed that there was no significant association 
between those with asymmetrical flexion and/or extension or medial and/or 
lateral gaps during knee replacement and subsequent functional outcomes. No 
significant difference was detected with those with an elevated joint line and 
postoperative function.
CONCLUSION: In the midterm, the resultant change in joint-line and maintained 
gap symmetry noted with GB does not result in significant change to function or 
quality of life.

potential cost-effectiveness of adherence interventions in Canada: a simulation 
study.

Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.

OBJECTIVE: Pharmaceutical treatment of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) 
reduces the risk of progression to active tuberculosis (TB); however, poor 
adherence tempers the protective effect. We aimed to estimate the health burden 
of non-adherence, the maximum allowable cost of hypothetical new adherence 
interventions to be cost-effective and the potential value of existing adherence 
interventions for patients with low-risk LTBI in Canada.
DESIGN: A microsimulation model of LTBI progression over 25 years.
SETTING: General practice in Canada.
PARTICIPANTS: Individuals with LTBI who are initiating drug therapy.
INTERVENTIONS: A hypothetical intervention with a range of effectiveness was 
evaluated. Existing drug adherence interventions including peer support, two-way 
text messaging support, enhanced adherence counselling and adherence incentives 
were also evaluated.
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Simulation outcomes included healthcare 
costs, TB incidence, TB deaths and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Base 
case results were interpreted against a willingness-to-pay threshold of 
$C50 000/QALY.
RESULTS: Compared with current adherence levels, full adherence to LTBI drug 
therapy could reduce new TB cases from 90.3 cases per 100 000 person-years to 
35.9 cases per 100 000 person-years and reduce TB-related deaths from 7.9 deaths 
per 100 000 person-years to 3.1 deaths per 100 000 person-years. An intervention 
that increases relative adherence by 40% would bring the population near full 
adherence to drug therapy and could have a maximum allowable annual cost of 
approximately $C450 per person to be cost-effective. Based on estimates of 
effect sizes and costs of existing adherence interventions, we found that they 
yielded between 900 and 2400 additional QALYs per million people, reduced TB 
deaths by 5%-25% and were likely to be cost-effective over 25 years.
CONCLUSION: Full adherence could reduce the number of future TB cases by nearly 
60%, offsetting TB-related costs and health burden. Several existing 
interventions are could be cost-effective to help achieve this goal.

Modification of cardiovascular pharmacotherapy in palliative care patients with 
cancer: a narrative review.

Pasierski T.

Palliative care patients with cancer are treated with many drugs, especially at 
the end of life. Limiting polypharmacy decreases the risk of associated adverse 
effects, medical errors, and harmful drug interactions. The time lag to benefit 
from the use of many medications used for cardiovascular diseases or their risk 
factors, such as hypertension and hypercholesterolemia, is frequently longer 
than the life expectancy of palliative care patients with cancer. It is 
ethically appropriate to modify, and even to discontinue, cardiovascular 
pharmacotherapy when there is no prospect of benefit. The decision to 
discontinue lipid‑lowering drugs and antihypertensive drugs is rather 
straightforward. Antithrombotic therapy may be stopped in low‑risk primary 
prevention but not in high‑risk group. Discontinuation of drugs for heart 
failure may provoke exacerbation of symptoms and should be considered only in 
the last weeks of life.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Diabetic Kidney Disease is associated with excessive 
mortality and morbidity. Simultaneous pancreas kidney transplantation (SPK) 
significantly improves quality of life and increases life expectancy of uremic 
diabetic patients. It is not known whether pancreas and kidney rejections in 
these transplant patients is concordant or discordant.
DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, AND MEASUREMENTS: We analyzed clinical data on 
all SPK transplants performed between 2003 and 2014 at Indiana University to 
assess the impact of isolated or combined pancreas and kidney rejections on 
patient and allograft outcomes. The primary outcome of interest was kidney graft 
rejection within 1 year of pancreatic rejection and kidney survival in SPK 
patients with and without pancreatic rejection.
RESULTS: Mean age of patients was 44 ± 9 years; 61.9% were males; 88% were 
Caucasians. A total of 23.8% of cases had rejection [8.7% pancreatic rejection 
alone (PA), 4.4% had concordant pancreas and kidney (PK) rejection, and 10.7% 
had kidney rejection alone(KA)]. PK had a worse effect on kidney graft survival 
than PA (p = 0.019). Neither pancreas rejection nor kidney rejection had an 
adverse effect on patient survival. However, both pancreas graft failure and 
kidney graft failure adversely affected patient survival. Tacrolimus levels were 
not significantly different in all groups over a 10 year period (p = 0.4584).
CONCLUSIONS: Concordant pancreas kidney rejection is synergistically deleterious 
to kidney graft survival. Graft failure, not graft rejection, is adversely 
associated with patient survival.

BACKGROUND: Detailed assessments of mortality patterns, particularly 
age-specific mortality, represent a crucial input that enables health systems to 
target interventions to specific populations. Understanding how all-cause 
mortality has changed with respect to development status can identify exemplars 
for best practice. To accomplish this, the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, 
and Risk Factors Study 2016 (GBD 2016) estimated age-specific and sex-specific 
all-cause mortality between 1970 and 2016 for 195 countries and territories and 
at the subnational level for the five countries with a population greater than 
200 million in 2016.
METHODS: We have evaluated how well civil registration systems captured deaths 
using a set of demographic methods called death distribution methods for adults 
and from consideration of survey and census data for children younger than 5 
years. We generated an overall assessment of completeness of registration of 
deaths by dividing registered deaths in each location-year by our estimate of 
all-age deaths generated from our overall estimation process. For 163 locations, 
including subnational units in countries with a population greater than 200 
million with complete vital registration (VR) systems, our estimates were 
largely driven by the observed data, with corrections for small fluctuations in 
numbers and estimation for recent years where there were lags in data reporting 
(lags were variable by location, generally between 1 year and 6 years). For 
other locations, we took advantage of different data sources available to 
measure under-5 mortality rates (U5MR) using complete birth histories, summary 
birth histories, and incomplete VR with adjustments; we measured adult mortality 
rate (the probability of death in individuals aged 15-60 years) using adjusted 
incomplete VR, sibling histories, and household death recall. We used the U5MR 
and adult mortality rate, together with crude death rate due to HIV in the GBD 
model life table system, to estimate age-specific and sex-specific death rates 
for each location-year. Using various international databases, we identified 
fatal discontinuities, which we defined as increases in the death rate of more 
than one death per million, resulting from conflict and terrorism, natural 
disasters, major transport or technological accidents, and a subset of epidemic 
infectious diseases; these were added to estimates in the relevant years. In 47 
countries with an identified peak adult prevalence for HIV/AIDS of more than 
0·5% and where VR systems were less than 65% complete, we informed our estimates 
of age-sex-specific mortality using the Estimation and Projection Package 
(EPP)-Spectrum model fitted to national HIV/AIDS prevalence surveys and 
antenatal clinic serosurveillance systems. We estimated stillbirths, early 
neonatal, late neonatal, and childhood mortality using both survey and VR data 
in spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression models. We estimated abridged life 
tables for all location-years using age-specific death rates. We grouped 
locations into development quintiles based on the Socio-demographic Index (SDI) 
and analysed mortality trends by quintile. Using spline regression, we estimated 
the expected mortality rate for each age-sex group as a function of SDI. We 
identified countries with higher life expectancy than expected by comparing 
observed life expectancy to anticipated life expectancy on the basis of 
development status alone.
FINDINGS: Completeness in the registration of deaths increased from 28% in 1970 
to a peak of 45% in 2013; completeness was lower after 2013 because of lags in 
reporting. Total deaths in children younger than 5 years decreased from 1970 to 
2016, and slower decreases occurred at ages 5-24 years. By contrast, numbers of 
adult deaths increased in each 5-year age bracket above the age of 25 years. The 
distribution of annualised rates of change in age-specific mortality rate 
differed over the period 2000 to 2016 compared with earlier decades: increasing 
annualised rates of change were less frequent, although rising annualised rates 
of change still occurred in some locations, particularly for adolescent and 
younger adult age groups. Rates of stillbirths and under-5 mortality both 
decreased globally from 1970. Evidence for global convergence of death rates was 
mixed; although the absolute difference between age-standardised death rates 
narrowed between countries at the lowest and highest levels of SDI, the ratio of 
these death rates-a measure of relative inequality-increased slightly. There was 
a strong shift between 1970 and 2016 toward higher life expectancy, most 
noticeably at higher levels of SDI. Among countries with populations greater 
than 1 million in 2016, life expectancy at birth was highest for women in Japan, 
at 86·9 years (95% UI 86·7-87·2), and for men in Singapore, at 81·3 years 
(78·8-83·7) in 2016. Male life expectancy was generally lower than female life 
expectancy between 1970 and 2016, and the gap between male and female life 
expectancy increased with progression to higher levels of SDI. Some countries 
with exceptional health performance in 1990 in terms of the difference in 
observed to expected life expectancy at birth had slower progress on the same 
measure in 2016.
INTERPRETATION: Globally, mortality rates have decreased across all age groups 
over the past five decades, with the largest improvements occurring among 
children younger than 5 years. However, at the national level, considerable 
heterogeneity remains in terms of both level and rate of changes in age-specific 
mortality; increases in mortality for certain age groups occurred in some 
locations. We found evidence that the absolute gap between countries in 
age-specific death rates has declined, although the relative gap for some 
age-sex groups increased. Countries that now lead in terms of having higher 
observed life expectancy than that expected on the basis of development alone, 
or locations that have either increased this advantage or rapidly decreased the 
deficit from expected levels, could provide insight into the means to accelerate 
progress in nations where progress has stalled.

BACKGROUND: Monitoring levels and trends in premature mortality is crucial to 
understanding how societies can address prominent sources of early death. The 
Global Burden of Disease 2016 Study (GBD 2016) provides a comprehensive 
assessment of cause-specific mortality for 264 causes in 195 locations from 1980 
to 2016. This assessment includes evaluation of the expected epidemiological 
transition with changes in development and where local patterns deviate from 
these trends.
METHODS: We estimated cause-specific deaths and years of life lost (YLLs) by 
age, sex, geography, and year. YLLs were calculated from the sum of each death 
multiplied by the standard life expectancy at each age. We used the GBD cause of 
death database composed of: vital registration (VR) data corrected for 
under-registration and garbage coding; national and subnational verbal autopsy 
(VA) studies corrected for garbage coding; and other sources including surveys 
and surveillance systems for specific causes such as maternal mortality. To 
facilitate assessment of quality, we reported on the fraction of deaths assigned 
to GBD Level 1 or Level 2 causes that cannot be underlying causes of death 
(major garbage codes) by location and year. Based on completeness, garbage 
coding, cause list detail, and time periods covered, we provided an overall data 
quality rating for each location with scores ranging from 0 stars (worst) to 5 
stars (best). We used robust statistical methods including the Cause of Death 
Ensemble model (CODEm) to generate estimates for each location, year, age, and 
sex. We assessed observed and expected levels and trends of cause-specific 
deaths in relation to the Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a summary indicator 
derived from measures of average income per capita, educational attainment, and 
total fertility, with locations grouped into quintiles by SDI. Relative to GBD 
2015, we expanded the GBD cause hierarchy by 18 causes of death for GBD 2016.
FINDINGS: The quality of available data varied by location. Data quality in 25 
countries rated in the highest category (5 stars), while 48, 30, 21, and 44 
countries were rated at each of the succeeding data quality levels. Vital 
registration or verbal autopsy data were not available in 27 countries, 
resulting in the assignment of a zero value for data quality. Deaths from 
non-communicable diseases (NCDs) represented 72·3% (95% uncertainty interval 
[UI] 71·2-73·2) of deaths in 2016 with 19·3% (18·5-20·4) of deaths in that year 
occurring from communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional (CMNN) diseases 
and a further 8·43% (8·00-8·67) from injuries. Although age-standardised rates 
of death from NCDs decreased globally between 2006 and 2016, total numbers of 
these deaths increased; both numbers and age-standardised rates of death from 
CMNN causes decreased in the decade 2006-16-age-standardised rates of deaths 
from injuries decreased but total numbers varied little. In 2016, the three 
leading global causes of death in children under-5 were lower respiratory 
infections, neonatal preterm birth complications, and neonatal encephalopathy 
due to birth asphyxia and trauma, combined resulting in 1·80 million deaths (95% 
UI 1·59 million to 1·89 million). Between 1990 and 2016, a profound shift toward 
deaths at older ages occurred with a 178% (95% UI 176-181) increase in deaths in 
ages 90-94 years and a 210% (208-212) increase in deaths older than age 95 
years. The ten leading causes by rates of age-standardised YLL significantly 
decreased from 2006 to 2016 (median annualised rate of change was a decrease of 
2·89%); the median annualised rate of change for all other causes was lower (a 
decrease of 1·59%) during the same interval. Globally, the five leading causes 
of total YLLs in 2016 were cardiovascular diseases; diarrhoea, lower respiratory 
infections, and other common infectious diseases; neoplasms; neonatal disorders; 
and HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis. At a finer level of disaggregation within cause 
groupings, the ten leading causes of total YLLs in 2016 were ischaemic heart 
disease, cerebrovascular disease, lower respiratory infections, diarrhoeal 
diseases, road injuries, malaria, neonatal preterm birth complications, 
HIV/AIDS, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and neonatal encephalopathy due 
to birth asphyxia and trauma. Ischaemic heart disease was the leading cause of 
total YLLs in 113 countries for men and 97 countries for women. Comparisons of 
observed levels of YLLs by countries, relative to the level of YLLs expected on 
the basis of SDI alone, highlighted distinct regional patterns including the 
greater than expected level of YLLs from malaria and from HIV/AIDS across 
sub-Saharan Africa; diabetes mellitus, especially in Oceania; interpersonal 
violence, notably within Latin America and the Caribbean; and cardiomyopathy and 
myocarditis, particularly in eastern and central Europe. The level of YLLs from 
ischaemic heart disease was less than expected in 117 of 195 locations. Other 
leading causes of YLLs for which YLLs were notably lower than expected included 
neonatal preterm birth complications in many locations in both south Asia and 
southeast Asia, and cerebrovascular disease in western Europe.
INTERPRETATION: The past 37 years have featured declining rates of communicable, 
maternal, neonatal, and nutritional diseases across all quintiles of SDI, with 
faster than expected gains for many locations relative to their SDI. A global 
shift towards deaths at older ages suggests success in reducing many causes of 
early death. YLLs have increased globally for causes such as diabetes mellitus 
or some neoplasms, and in some locations for causes such as drug use disorders, 
and conflict and terrorism. Increasing levels of YLLs might reflect outcomes 
from conditions that required high levels of care but for which effective 
treatments remain elusive, potentially increasing costs to health systems.

BACKGROUND: As mortality rates decline, life expectancy increases, and 
populations age, non-fatal outcomes of diseases and injuries are becoming a 
larger component of the global burden of disease. The Global Burden of Diseases, 
Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2016 (GBD 2016) provides a comprehensive 
assessment of prevalence, incidence, and years lived with disability (YLDs) for 
328 causes in 195 countries and territories from 1990 to 2016.
METHODS: We estimated prevalence and incidence for 328 diseases and injuries and 
2982 sequelae, their non-fatal consequences. We used DisMod-MR 2.1, a Bayesian 
meta-regression tool, as the main method of estimation, ensuring consistency 
between incidence, prevalence, remission, and cause of death rates for each 
condition. For some causes, we used alternative modelling strategies if 
incidence or prevalence needed to be derived from other data. YLDs were 
estimated as the product of prevalence and a disability weight for all mutually 
exclusive sequelae, corrected for comorbidity and aggregated to cause level. We 
updated the Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a summary indicator of income per 
capita, years of schooling, and total fertility rate. GBD 2016 complies with the 
Guidelines for Accurate and Transparent Health Estimates Reporting (GATHER).
FINDINGS: Globally, low back pain, migraine, age-related and other hearing loss, 
iron-deficiency anaemia, and major depressive disorder were the five leading 
causes of YLDs in 2016, contributing 57·6 million (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 
40·8-75·9 million [7·2%, 6·0-8·3]), 45·1 million (29·0-62·8 million [5·6%, 
4·0-7·2]), 36·3 million (25·3-50·9 million [4·5%, 3·8-5·3]), 34·7 million 
(23·0-49·6 million [4·3%, 3·5-5·2]), and 34·1 million (23·5-46·0 million [4·2%, 
3·2-5·3]) of total YLDs, respectively. Age-standardised rates of YLDs for all 
causes combined decreased between 1990 and 2016 by 2·7% (95% UI 2·3-3·1). 
Despite mostly stagnant age-standardised rates, the absolute number of YLDs from 
non-communicable diseases has been growing rapidly across all SDI quintiles, 
partly because of population growth, but also the ageing of populations. The 
largest absolute increases in total numbers of YLDs globally were between the 
ages of 40 and 69 years. Age-standardised YLD rates for all conditions combined 
were 10·4% (95% UI 9·0-11·8) higher in women than in men. Iron-deficiency 
anaemia, migraine, Alzheimer's disease and other dementias, major depressive 
disorder, anxiety, and all musculoskeletal disorders apart from gout were the 
main conditions contributing to higher YLD rates in women. Men had higher 
age-standardised rates of substance use disorders, diabetes, cardiovascular 
diseases, cancers, and all injuries apart from sexual violence. Globally, we 
noted much less geographical variation in disability than has been documented 
for premature mortality. In 2016, there was a less than two times difference in 
age-standardised YLD rates for all causes between the location with the lowest 
rate (China, 9201 YLDs per 100 000, 95% UI 6862-11943) and highest rate (Yemen, 
14 774 YLDs per 100 000, 11 018-19 228).
INTERPRETATION: The decrease in death rates since 1990 for most causes has not 
been matched by a similar decline in age-standardised YLD rates. For many large 
causes, YLD rates have either been stagnant or have increased for some causes, 
such as diabetes. As populations are ageing, and the prevalence of disabling 
disease generally increases steeply with age, health systems will face 
increasing demand for services that are generally costlier than the 
interventions that have led to declines in mortality in childhood or for the 
major causes of mortality in adults. Up-to-date information about the trends of 
disease and how this varies between countries is essential to plan for an 
adequate health-system response.
