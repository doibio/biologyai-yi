extension decreased from age 50 to 70 years, while more effort is associated 
with worse performance in older individuals.
CONCLUSION: In healthy late-middle-aged individuals, more effort is perceived to 
perform cognitive tasks, but it is not sufficient to overcome the performance 
decline brought by lack of sleep. Entry in the seventh decade may stand as a 
turning point in the daily variations of perceived effort and its link with 
cognition. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved).

Mortality forecasts are essential part for policymaking in any aging society. In 
recent years, methods to model and forecast mortality have improved 
considerably. Among them, Lee-Carter method is one of the most influential 
method. In this paper, Lee-Carter method is applied to forecast mortality and 
life expectancy of Bangladesh. A functional data analysis approach is used to 
decompose the smoothed log-mortality rates in Lee-Carter framework for higher 
goodness-of-fit of the models and for longer forecast horizons. Bangladesh has 
been experiencing a mortality transition and has gained life expectancy in last 
few decades. The fitted model here showed higher pace of mortality decline for 
women in Bangladesh than that of men. The forecasts showed continuation of 
mortality improvement in long run and by 2060 life expectancy at birth is 
expected to reach over 80 years for both sexes in Bangladesh. The study also 
predicts the effect of reduction in infant mortality on the life expectancy in 
Bangladesh.

INTRODUCTION: Ciltacabtagene autoleucel (cilta-cel), a novel chimeric antigen 
receptor T (CAR-T) cell therapy, has demonstrated early, deep, and durable 
clinical responses in heavily pretreated patients with relapsed/refractory 
multiple myeloma (RRMM), and improvements in health-related quality of life 
(HRQoL) in CARTITUDE-1 (NCT03548207). Patient perspectives on treatment provide 
context to efficacy outcomes and are an important aspect of therapeutic 
evaluation.
METHODS: Qualitative interviews were conducted in a subset of CARTITUDE-1 
patients (n = 36) at screening, Day 100, and Day 184 post cilta-cel on living 
with MM, therapy expectations, and treatment experiences during the study.
RESULTS: Patients most wanted to see change in symptoms with the greatest impact 
on HRQoL: pain (85.2%) and fatigue (74.1%). The primary treatment expectation 
was achieving remission (40.7%), followed by extended life expectancy (14.8%). 
Patients most often defined meaningful change as improvement in symptoms (70.4%) 
and return to normalcy (40.7%). The percentage of patients reporting symptoms 
(pain, fatigue, bone fracture, gastrointestinal, neuropathy, and weakness) 
decreased from 85.2% to 22.2% across symptom types at baseline to 29.2% to 0% on 
Day 184 after cilta-cel. Improved symptoms and positive sentiments corresponded 
with improved perception of overall health status and reduced pain level, 
respectively. Most patients reported that their expectations of cilta-cel 
treatment had been met (70.8%) or exceeded (20.8%) at Day 184, and 70.8% of 
patients considered cilta-cel therapy better than their previous treatments.
CONCLUSION: Overall HRQoL improvements and qualitative interviews showed 
cilta-cel met patient expectations of treatment and suggest the long 
treatment-free period also contributed to positive sentiments.

The art of diabetes care: guidelines for a holistic approach to human and social 
factors.

University, Al Ain, United Arab Emirates.

A holistic approach to diabetes considers patient preferences, emotional health, 
living conditions, and other contextual factors, in addition to medication 
selection. Human and social factors influence treatment adherence and clinical 
outcomes. Social issues, cost of care, out-of-pocket expenses, pill burden 
(number and frequency), and injectable drugs such as insulin, can affect 
adherence. Clinicians can ask about these contextual factors when discussing 
treatment options with patients. Patients' emotional health can also affect 
diabetes self-care. Social stressors such as family issues may impair self-care 
behaviors. Diabetes can also lead to emotional stress. Diabetes distress 
correlates with worse glycemic control and lower overall well-being. 
Patient-centered communication can build the foundation of a trusting 
relationship with the clinician. Respect for patient preferences and fears can 
build trust. Relevant communication skills include asking open-ended questions, 
expressing empathy, active listening, and exploring the patient's perspective. 
Glycemic goals must be personalized based on frailty, the risk of hypoglycemia, 
and healthy life expectancy. Lifestyle counseling requires a nonjudgmental 
approach and tactfulness. The art of diabetes care rests on clinicians 
perceiving a patient's emotional state. Tailoring the level of advice and 
diabetes targets based on a patient's personal and contextual factors requires 
mindfulness by clinicians.

Surgical area nurses provide comprehensive care to patients throughout the 
surgical process. Increases in life expectancy lead to the appearance and 
development of diseases, translating into an increase in the number of necessary 
interventions. Increases in the workload can be another risk factor for the 
development of burnout in professionals in this area. Knowledge of psychological 
and personality-related variables provides relevant information of level changes 
in the dimensions of burnout syndrome. Three logistic regression models, based 
on a cross-sectional study with 214 nurses working in the surgical area in the 
Andalusian Health Service, Spain, were built for each dimension. These models 
included different variables related to depression and personality, with some 
being significant at the population level and consequently true risk or 
protection factors. Friendliness, responsibility and extraversion are protection 
factors for the personal accomplishment dimension, whilst neuroticism is a risk 
factor for this dimension. Friendliness is also a protection factor for 
depersonalization, whilst depression is a risk factor. Finally, neuroticism, 
responsibility and depression are risk factors for the emotional exhaustion 
dimension of burnout. These findings provide relevant information that makes 
anticipation of this syndrome in this group easier.

Currently, the exploration of natural colorants from vegetal waste has gained 
particular attention. Furthermore, incorporation of these natural sources into 
biopolymers is an encouraging environmentally friendly approach to establishing 
active films with biological activities for food packaging. The present study 
developed bioactive antioxidant films based on gelatin-sodium alginate (NaAlg) 
incorporated with aqueous beetroot peel extract (BPE). Firstly, the effects of 
combining gelatin-NaAlg and BPE at 0.25, 0.5, and 1% on the mechanical, 
physical, antioxidant, and antibacterial properties of the films were analyzed. 
With increasing BPE, mechanico-physical properties and antioxidant and 
anti-foodborne pathogen capacities were enhanced. Likewise, when added to 
gelatin-NaAlg films, BPE remarkably increased the instrumental color properties. 
Moreover, during 14 days of storage at 4 °C, the impact of gelatin-NaAlg coating 
impregnated with BPE on microbial and chemical oxidation and on the sensory 
characteristics of beef meat samples was periodically assessed. Interestingly, 
by the end of the storage, BPE at 1% limited the microbial deterioration, 
enhanced the instrumental color, delayed chemical oxidation, and improved 
sensory traits. By practicing chemometrics tools (principal component analysis 
and heat maps), all data provided valuable information for categorizing all 
samples regarding microbiological and oxidative properties, sensory features, 
and instrumental color. Our findings revealed the ability of gelatin-NaAlg with 
BPE as an antioxidant to be employed as food packaging for meat preservation.

Review.

Osteoporosis, or bone loss, is a disease that affects many women globally. As 
life expectancy increases, the risk of osteoporosis in women also increases, 
too, and this will create a burden on the healthcare and economic sectors of a 
country. Osteoporosis was once thought to be a disease that would occur only 
after menopause. However, many studies have shown that osteoporosis may develop 
even in the perimenopausal stage. Due to the erratic levels of estrogen and 
progesterone during the perimenopausal stage, studies suggest that women are 
exposed to the risk of developing osteoporosis even at this stage. The erratic 
hormonal changes result in the production of proinflammatory mediators and cause 
oxidative stress, which leads to the progressive loss of bone-building 
activities. Tocotrienols, members of vitamin E, have many health-promoting 
properties. Due to their powerful anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory 
properties, tocotrienols have shown positive anti-osteoporotic properties in 
post-menopausal studies. Hence, we propose here that tocotrienols could also 
possibly alleviate perimenopausal osteoporosis by discussing in this review the 
connection between inflammatory mediators produced during perimenopause and the 
risk of osteoporosis. Tocotrienols could potentially be an anti-osteoporotic 
agent, but due to their low bioavailability, they have not been as effective as 
they could be. Several approaches have been evaluated to overcome this issue, as 
presented in this review. As the anti-osteoporotic effects of tocotrienols were 
mostly studied in post-menopausal models, we hope that this review could pave 
the way for more research to be done to evaluate their effect on peri-menopausal 
models so as to reduce the risk of osteoporosis from an earlier stage.

Psoriasis is a chronic, inflammatory skin disease that may occur at any age, 
with a bimodal peak of incidence around the age of 16-20 years of age (early 
onset) and 57-60 years (late-onset). It is estimated that roughly 70% of 
patients develop the disease before the age of 40, which coincides with the 
reproductive years. Moreover, psoriasis is a chronic disease, meaning that, with 
increased life-duration expectancy, the number of patients affected with 
psoriasis aged over 65 years is going to increase and represent a big 
therapeutic challenge. Actually, no specific drug recommendation is available, 
based only on the age of the patients, while therapeutic prescription should 
take into account that elderly patients have more comorbidities than younger 
patients, with polypharmacy and an increased risk of drug interactions. Women 
with psoriasis are more likely to report a worse influence of the disease on 
their quality of life, and they are more susceptible to the development of 
depression. Furthermore, pregnancy and lactation represent a major 
contraindication to several systemic agents, and only a few studies exist 
providing the safety of certain drugs during these periods of life of a woman, 
such as certolizumab pegol. In this paper, we discuss systemic therapeutic 
strategies, including conventional and biological therapies, in a special subset 
of patients affected with moderate-to-severe psoriasis focusing on elderly 
patients and on female patients in fertile age, pregnancy, and lactation.

This study aimed for the application of active chitosan coating incorporating 
yarrow essential oil (YEO) together with the development of an on-package sensor 
label based on bromocresol purple (BCP) and methyl red (MR) for shelf-life 
extension and freshness monitoring of chicken breast fillet. Physiochemical and 
microbiological attributes of chicken meat coated with sole chitosan, YEO, and 
chitosan + YEO were compared with those of uncoated (control) samples. Chitosan 
+ YEO coated chicken meat stayed fresh with no significant changes (p > 0.05) in 
pH (5.42−5.56), TVB-N (12.55−15.36 mg N/100 g), TBARs (0.35−0.40 mg MDA/kg) and 
total aerobic psycrotrophic bacteria (3.97−4.65 log CFU/g) in days 1−15. There 
was no response of the dual-sensors label toward the variation in chemical and 
microbiological indicators of chicken meat coated with chitosan + YEO. However, 
either uncoated, sole chitosan, or sole YEO treatments indicated a three-stage 
freshness status with the fresh stage belonged to a period earlier than day 7 
(with no distinct color change in both sensor labels); the semi-fresh stage 
corresponded to storage days between 7−9, wherein a gradual color change 
appeared (MR from pink to orange, BCP from yellow to light purple); and the 
spoiled stage occurred in day 9 onward with a drastic color change (MR from 
orange to light yellow, BCP from light purple to deep purple). In general, the 
dual-sensors successfully responded to the variation of chemical and 
microbiological indicators and visual color of uncoated samples during storage 
time. Based on the obtained results, the application of chitosan + YEO coating 
efficiently prolonged the freshness of chicken breast meat, where on-package 
dual-sensors systems were able to detect the freshness stages of meat samples 
during storage time.

Species of the genus Oreolalax displayed crucial morphological characteristics 
of vertebrates transitioning from aquatic to terrestrial habitats; thus, they 
can be regarded as a representative vertebrate genus for this landing 
phenomenon. But the present phylogenetic status of Oreolalax omeimontis has been 
controversial with morphological and molecular approaches, and specific gene 
rearrangements were discovered in all six published Oreolalax mitogenomes, which 
are rarely observed in Archaeobatrachia. Therefore, this study determined the 
complete mitogenome of O. omeimontis with the aim of identifying its precise 
phylogenetic position and novel gene arrangement in Archaeobatrachia. 
Phylogenetic analysis with Bayesian inference and maximum likelihood indicates 
O. omeimontis is a sister group to O. lichuanensis, which is consistent with 
previous phylogenetic analysis based on morphological characteristics, but 
contrasts with other studies using multiple gene fragments. Moreover, although 
the duplication of trnM occurred in all seven Oreolalax species, the 
translocation of trnQ and trnM occurred differently in O. omeimontis to the 
other six, and this unique rearrangement would happen after the speciation of O. 
omeimontis. In general, this study sheds new light on the phylogenetic 
relationships and gene rearrangements of Archaeobatrachia.

This study aimed to investigate the acute and prolonged effects of dermal 
suction on joint range of motion (ROM) and passive muscle stiffness. 
Eight-minute dermal suction was prescribed for the quadriceps femoris in 15 
participants. Hip extension ROM, knee flexion ROM, and passive muscle stiffness 
of the rectus femoris (RF) and vastus lateralis (VL) were measured before and 
immediately, 30 min, 60 min, 120 min, 24 h, and 48 h after dermal suction. 
Passive muscle stiffness was measured using shear wave elastography. Hip 
extension ROM significantly increased immediately (p = 0.032), 60 min (p = 
0.029), and 120 min (p = 0.031) after dermal suction compared with before dermal 
suction; however, it was not significantly different at 30 min, 24 h, and 48 h 
after dermal suction (p > 0.05). Passive muscle stiffness of the RF and VL and 
knee flexion ROM did not significantly change at any measurement time compared 
with before dermal suction (p > 0.05). Our preliminary results suggest that 
dermal suction improves hip extension ROM immediately after dermal suction of 
the quadriceps femoris, followed by a return to the pre-prescription level 30 
min after. However, the effect was prolonged for 120 min and disappeared before 
24 h.

Columbus, Ohio is one of the more prosperous, well-educated, and progressive 
cities in the United States. However, it ranks as the second worst life 
expectancy at birth, has a census tract wealth gap (27-year disparity), and one 
of the higher infant mortality rates in the country. These data suggest that 
there are likely several high-risk, vulnerable neighborhoods in Columbus with 
residents experiencing disparate and adverse outcomes. Illustrative of this fact 
are studies that have examined the social processes and mechanisms through which 
neighborhood contexts are at the forefront, including exposures to chemical 
stressors such as particulate matter (PM2.5) as well as non-chemical stressors 
including violence, social determinants of health, zoning, and land use 
policies. It is documented that disparate and adverse outcomes are magnified in 
the vulnerable neighborhoods on the Near East Side as compared to Columbus city 
proper, Franklin County and/or the state of Ohio. As such, we developed a 
nuanced community engagement framework to identify potential environmental 
hazards associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes in those census tracts. The 
refined framework uses a blended version of traditional community-based 
participatory research (CBPR) models and is referred to as E6, Enhancing 
Environmental Endeavors via e-Equity, Education, and Empowerment.

BACKGROUND: According to the World Health Organization's statistics, 7 of the 10 
main causes of death in 2019 were noncommunicable diseases. Health indicators 
are measures used to evaluate public health system effectiveness and 
functioning. Monitoring mortality rates from leading causes, life expectancy and 
other health indicators is essential to address their causes and adapt health 
systems to react adequately. The aim of this study is to present the 
dependencies of selected health care indicators and health outcomes.
METHODS: Based on the literature review conducted, selected health indicators, 
along with healthcare system data, were analyzed using Pearson's r correlation. 
The analyses included data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and 
Development (OECD) presented in statistics and the Health at a Glance 2021 
report and data collected as part of the preparation of the Financing Global 
Health 2020 report by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation.
RESULTS: Health system resources are linked to health outcomes. The number of 
medical consultations, the number of nurses per patient or the level of 
financing of services under general health insurance are related to life 
expectancy and deaths due to causes that could have been avoided or treated.
CONCLUSIONS: Life expectancy is positively correlated with access to general 
health insurance and public expenditure on healthcare. There is a need for all 
countries to provide their citizens with broad access to healthcare services.

Cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide, with increasing numbers of new 
cases each year. For the vast majority of cancer patients, surgery is the most 
effective procedure for the complete removal of the malignant tissue. However, 
relapse due to the incomplete resection of the tumor occurs very often, as the 
surgeon must rely primarily on visual and tactile feedback. Intraoperative 
near-infrared imaging with pafolacianine is a newly developed technology 
designed for cancer detection during surgery, which has been proven to show 
excellent results in terms of safety and efficacy. Therefore, pafolacianine was 
approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on 29 November 2021, as 
an additional approach that can be used to identify malignant lesions and to 
ensure the total resection of the tumors in ovarian cancer patients. Currently, 
various studies have demonstrated the positive effects of pafolacianine's use in 
a wide variety of other malignancies, with promising results expected in further 
research. This review focuses on the applications of the FDA-approved 
pafolacianine for the accurate intraoperative detection of malignant tissues. 
The cancer-targeting fluorescent ligands can shift the paradigm of surgical 
oncology by enabling the visualization of cancer lesions that are difficult to 
detect by inspection or palpation. The enhanced detection and removal of 
hard-to-detect cancer tissues during surgery will lead to remarkable outcomes 
for cancer patients and society, specifically by decreasing the cancer relapse 
rate, increasing the life expectancy and quality of life, and decreasing future 
rates of hospitalization, interventions, and costs.

Over the past two decades, transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) swiftly 
evolved from a disrupting technology towards mainstream therapy in the field of 
severe symptomatic aortic stenosis. A series of randomized evaluations 
established its role in treating severe aortic stenosis patients across all 
surgical risk categories, paving the way for an extension of its indications to 
younger low-risk patients with a longer life expectancy. Therefore, managing 
comorbidities and limiting procedural complications, which may affect long-term 
outcomes, is of paramount importance. Among those, new-onset conduction 
disturbances and concomitant coronary artery disease remain two of the most 
debated issues. In the present review, we will discuss the incidence, prognostic 
impact, and unmet needs of patients with post-TAVR new-onset conduction 
disturbances and the ongoing challenges posed by the management of concomitant 
coronary artery disease.

(1) Background: We describe our experience with cystic fibrosis (CF) patients 
treated with bronchial artery embolization (BAE) for sub-massive hemoptysis to 
understand if early treatment of sub-massive hemoptysis can reduce the volume of 
any subsequent bleedings. (2) Materials: We performed a retrospective study 
including CF patients who underwent angiographic procedures for BAE following 
sub-massive hemoptysis, from March 2016 to December 2021. All patients underwent 
an initial chest angio-CT study. BAE was realized with microspheres or coils. 
(3) Results: Thirteen patients were included, subjected to at least one BAE 
after sub-massive hemoptysis, for a total of 19 procedures. Technical success 
was 94.7%; in a single case, the catheterization of the bronchial arterial 
feeder was not achievable and the procedure was repeated. Primary clinical 
success was 92.3%; secondary clinical success was 69.2%. Relative clinical 
success was 85%. A higher incidence of recurrent hemoptysis following treatment 
with coils was observed (100% of cases) compared to treatment with microspheres 
(54.5% of cases) χ2 = 5.43 (p < 0.05). (4) Conclusions: BAE is a safe and 
effective method for the treatment of hemoptysis in CF patients; it should be 
practiced not only after massive or recurrent hemoptysis but also in patients 
with sub-massive bleeding to improve their life expectancy and quality of life.

The process of aging population will inevitably increase age-related 
comorbidities including chronic kidney disease (CKD). In light of this 
demographic transition, the lack of an age-adjusted CKD classification may 
enormously increase the number of new diagnoses of CKD in old subjects with an 
indolent decline in kidney function. Overdiagnosis of CKD will inevitably lead 
to important clinical consequences and pronounced negative effects on the 
health-related quality of life of these patients. Based on these data, an 
appropriate workup for the diagnosis of CKD is critical in reducing the burden 
of CKD worldwide. Optimal management of CKD should be based on prevention and 
reduction of risk factors associated with kidney injury. Once the diagnosis of 
CKD has been made, an appropriate staging of kidney disease and timely 
prescriptions of promising nephroprotective drugs (e.g., RAAS, SGLT-2 
inhibitors, finerenone) appear crucial to slow down the progression toward 
end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). The management of elderly, comorbid and frail 
patients also opens new questions on the appropriate renal replacement therapy 
for this subset of the population. The non-dialytic management of CKD in old 
subjects with short life expectancy features as a valid option in 
patient-centered care programs. Considering the multiple implications of CKD for 
global public health, this review examines the prevalence, diagnosis and 
principles of treatment of kidney disease in the aging population.

Background: The thoracolumbar fascia (TLF) is thought to play a role in the 
development of LBP, but it is not yet clear which factor of TLF changes is a 
cause and which is an effect. Therefore, some studies used the cross-correlation 
function (CCR) to reveal time-dependent relationships between biomechanical and 
neuromotor factors. Methods: Ten patients with acute low back pain (aLBP) were 
matched to healthy controls. Simultaneous recording of surface electromyography 
(sEMG) of the erector spinae and multifidus muscle (ESM) and dynamic ultrasound 
(US) images of TLF deformation were performed during trunk extension. CCR 
functions and Granger causality (GC) were used to describe the relationship 
between the two measures. Results: CCR time lags were significant higher in the 
aLBP group (p = 0.04). GC showed a direct effect of TLF deformation on ESM 
activation only in the aLBP group (p < 0.03). Conclusions: The results suggest 
that in aLBP, ESM activity is significantly affected by TLF, whereas this 
relationship is completely random in healthy subjects studied with CCR and GC 
comparisons of dynamic US imaging and sEMG data signals. Fascia-related 
disturbances in neuromotor control, particularly due to altered muscle spindle 
functions, are suspected as a possible mechanism behind this.

Over the last decades, significant advances have been achieved in the treatment 
of coronary artery disease (CAD). Proper non-invasive diagnosis and appropriate 
management based on functional information and the extension of ischemia or 
viability remain the cornerstone in the fight against adverse CAD events. Stress 
echocardiography and single photon emission computed tomography are often used 
for the evaluation of ischemia. Advancements in non-invasive imaging modalities 
such as computed tomography (CT) coronary angiography and cardiac magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI) have not only allowed non-invasive imaging of coronary 
artery lumen but also provide additional functional information. Other 
characteristics regarding the plaque morphology can be further evaluated with 
the latest modalities achieving a morpho-functional evaluation of CAD. Advances 
in the utilization of positron emission tomography (PET), as well as software 
advancements especially regarding cardiac CT, may provide additional prognostic 
information to a more evidence-based treatment decision. Since the armamentarium 
on non-invasive imaging modalities has evolved, the knowledge of the 
capabilities and limitations of each imaging modality should be evaluated in a 
case-by-case basis to achieve the best diagnosis and treatment decision. In this 
review article, we present the most recent advances in the noninvasive 
anatomical and functional evaluation of CAD.

Cervical joint position sense (JPS) and postural stability are vital to 
maintaining balance and preventing falls in fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS). 
Impaired cervical JPS may influence postural stability, and understanding the 
relationship between them can aid in formulating treatment strategies in 
individuals with FMS. This study aims to (1) assess cervical JPS and postural 
stability between FMS and control group and (2) determine the correlation 
between cervical JPS and postural stability in the FMS group. This 
cross-sectional study recruited 92 FMS patients (mean age: 51.52 ± 7.7 yrs.) and 
92 healthy controls (mean age: 49.36 ± 6.9 yrs.). A cervical range of motion 
(CROM) unit was utilized to assess cervical JPS. The postural stability was 
assessed using an IsoFree force platform, and anterior-posterior (A/P) and 
medial-lateral (M/L) directions of sway and ellipse area were measured. Cervical 
JPS and postural stability tests were assessed and compared between FMS and 
control groups. Cervical JPS was significantly impaired in FMS compared to the 
control group (p < 0.001). The JPS errors in FMS group were larger in flexion 
(FMS = 5.5°, control = 2.4°), extension (FMS = 6.4°, control = 3.0°), and 
rotation in left (FMS = 5.4°, control = 2.2°) and right directions (FMS = 5.1°, 
control = 2.8°). FMS individuals demonstrated statistically significant impaired 
postural stability compared to control in both the dominant and non-dominant 
legs tested (p < 0.001). The cervical JPS test showed moderate to strong 
positive correlations with postural stability variables. Statistically 
significant correlations were observed in all the JPS directions tested with all 
the postural stability variables (A/P and M/L sway and ellipse area). The 
correlation coefficients ranged between r = 0.37 (moderate) to 0.75 (strong). 
Cervical JPS and postural stability are impaired in FMS individuals. A moderate 
to strong relationship existed between JPS and postural stability. Individuals 
with FMS who had a greater magnitude of cervical JPS errors exhibited more 
severe postural control deficits. Therefore, cervical JPS and postural stability 
tests should be incorporated into routine clinical practice when assessing or 
formulating treatment strategies for patients with FMS.

Adaptive Finite Element Modeling of Linear Elastic Fatigue Crack Growth.

Alshoaibi AM(1), Bashiri AH(1).

Author information:
(1)Mechanical Engineering Department, Jazan University, P.O. Box 114, Jazan 
45142, Saudi Arabia.

This paper proposed an efficient two-dimensional fatigue crack growth simulation 
program for linear elastic materials using an incremental crack growth 
procedure. The Visual Fortran programming language was used to develop the 
finite element code. The adaptive finite element mesh was generated using the 
advancing front method. Stress analysis for each increment was carried out using 
the adaptive mesh finite element technique. The equivalent stress intensity 
factor is the most essential parameter that should be accurately estimated for 
the mixed-mode loading condition which was used as the onset criterion for the 
crack growth. The node splitting and relaxation method advances the crack once 
the failure mechanism and crack direction have been determined. The displacement 
extrapolation technique (DET) was used to calculate stress intensity factors 
(SIFs) at each crack extension increment. Then, these SIFs were analyzed using 
the maximum circumferential stress theory (MCST) to predict the crack 
propagation trajectory and the fatigue life cycles using the Paris' law model. 
Finally, the performance and capability of the developed program are shown in 
the application examples.
