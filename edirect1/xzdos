structure to more compressed, which results in higher yield stress, lower 
spreadability, harder and more adhesive structure. For example, increasing the 
inulin gelling induction pressure (concentration 20 g/100 g) from 150 to 300 MPa 
with a time treatment of 10 min resulted in an increase in yield stress from 
38.1 to 711.7 Pa, spreadability force from 0.59 to 4.59 N, firmness from 0.11 to 
1.46 N, and adhesiveness from -0.06 to -0.65 N. Extending the time treatment of 
HHP increases this effect, but mainly when higher pressure and a higher 
concentration of inulin are being used. For example, extension of time treatment 
at 300 MPa pressure from 5 to 20 min resulted in an increase in yield stress 
from 774.8 to 1273.8 Pa, spreadability force from 6.28 to 8.43 N, firmness from 
1.87 to 2.98 N, and adhesiveness from -0.94 to -1.27 N. The obtained results 
indicate the possibility of using HHP to create inulin hydrogels tailored to the 
characteristics in a specific food product.

Rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis L.) is a plant worldwide cultivated mainly for 
essential oils, extracts, and as a spice. Up-to-date results showed diversity in 
composition of the essential oils, which may influence their quality, biological 
activity, and thermal properties. Therefore, the aim of this study was to 
investigate the chemical composition, antimicrobial activity, and thermal 
properties of the rosemary essential oils originating from Serbia and Russia. 
Additionally, oils were added to the sunflower oils in order to investigate 
possible antioxidant activity during the frying. Investigation of the chemical 
profile marked α-pinene, eucalyptol, and camphor as the most abundant compounds 
in both oils. However, overall composition influenced in such manner that 
Russian oil showed significantly higher antimicrobial activity, while Serbian 
oil proved to be better antioxidant agent in case of frying of sunflower oil. 
This would significantly influence possible application of the oils, which could 
be used as an antioxidant agent for extension of the food shelf life, or 
antimicrobial agent for protection against different microbial strains.

Fish products are highly perishable, requiring proper processing to maintain 
their quality and safety during the entire storage. Different from traditional 
methods used to extend the shelf-life of these products (smoking, salting, 
marinating, icing, chilling, freezing, drying, boiling, steaming, etc.), in 
recent years, some alternative methods have been proposed as innovative 
processing technologies able to guarantee the extension of their shelf-life 
while minimally affecting their organoleptic properties. The present review aims 
to describe the primary mechanisms of some of these innovative methods applied 
to preserve quality and safety of fish products; namely, non-thermal atmospheric 
plasma (NTAP), pulsed electric fields (PEF), pulsed light (PL), ultrasounds (US) 
and electrolyzed water (EW) are analysed, focusing on the main results of the 
studies published over the last 10 years. The limits and the benefits of each 
method are addressed in order to provide a global overview about these promising 
emerging technologies and to facilitate their greater use at industrial level. 
In general, all the innovative methods analysed in this review have shown a good 
effectiveness to control microbial growth in fish products maintaining their 
organoleptic, nutritional and sensory characteristics. Most of the technologies 
have also shown the great advantage to have a lower energy consumption and 
shorter production times. In contrast, not all the methods are in the same 
development stage; thus, we suggest further investigations to develop one (or 
more) hurdle-like non-thermal method able to meet both food production 
requirements and the modern consumers' demand.

Oleuropein (OLE) is a secoiridoid glycoside that mainly exists in olives with 
multifaceted health benefits. The present study aimed to investigate the stress 
resistance and lifespan extension effects of OLE in Caenorhabditis elegans. The 
results showed that OLE could significantly prolong the lifespan of C. elegans 
by 22.29%. Treatment with OLE also significantly increased the survival rates of 
worms against lethal heat shock and oxidative stress. Meanwhile, OLE 
supplementation increased the expression and activity of antioxidant enzymes and 
suppressed the generation of malondialdehyde in nematodes. In addition, the 
results from mutants implied that OLE might mediate longevity and stress 
resistance via DAF-16/FoxO, which played a vital role in the insulin/IGF-1 
signaling (IIS) pathway. To further identify the molecular targets of OLE, mRNA 
level and loss-of-function mutants of IIS-associated genes were investigated. 
The data revealed that OLE activated IIS by down-regulating the upstream 
components, daf-2 and age-1. Furthermore, another stress response and longevity 
pathway in parallel to DAF-16, SKN-1/Nrf2, was also shown to involve in 
OLE-induced beneficial effects. Collectively, these results provide the 
theoretical basis that OLE could enhance the stress resistance and increase the 
lifespan of C. elegans through the IIS and SKN-1/Nrf2 signaling pathways.

Garlic (Allium sativa L.) is a bulbous flowering plant belongs to the family of 
Amaryllidaceae and is a predominant horticultural crop originating from central 
Asia. Garlic and its products are chiefly used for culinary and therapeutic 
purposes in many countries. Bulbs of raw garlic have been investigated for their 
role in oral health, which are ascribed to a myriad of biologically active 
compounds such as alliin, allicin, methiin, S-allylcysteine (SAC), diallyl 
sulfide (DAS), S-ally-mercapto cysteine (SAMC), diallyl disulphide (DADS), 
diallyl trisulfide (DATS) and methyl allyl disulphide. A systematic review was 
conducted following the PRISMA statement. Scopus, PubMed, Clinicaltrials.gov, 
and Science direct databases were searched between 12 April 2021 to 4 September 
2021. A total of 148 studies were included and the qualitative synthesis 
phytochemical profile of GE, biological activities, therapeutic applications of 
garlic extract (GE) in oral health care system, and its mechanism of action in 
curing various oral pathologies have been discussed. Furthermore, the safety of 
incorporation of GE as food supplements is also critically discussed. To 
conclude, GE could conceivably make a treatment recourse for patients suffering 
from diverse oral diseases.

With an increased life expectancy among humans, aging has recently emerged as a 
major focus in biomedical research. The lack of in vitro aging models-especially 
for neurological disorders, where access to human brain tissues is limited-has 
hampered the progress in studies on human brain aging and various age-associated 
neurodegenerative diseases at the cellular and molecular level. In this review, 
we provide an overview of age-related changes in the transcriptome, in signaling 
pathways, and in relation to epigenetic factors that occur in senescent neurons. 
Moreover, we explore the current cell models used to study neuronal aging in 
vitro, including immortalized cell lines, primary neuronal culture, neurons 
directly converted from fibroblasts (Fib-iNs), and iPSC-derived neurons 
(iPSC-iNs); we also discuss the advantages and limitations of these models. In 
addition, the key phenotypes associated with cellular senescence that have been 
observed by these models are compared. Finally, we focus on the potential of 
combining human iPSC-iNs with genome editing technology in order to further our 
understanding of brain aging and neurodegenerative diseases, and discuss the 
future directions and challenges in the field.

Management of Ascites in Patients with Cirrhosis: An Update.

Ascites represents a critical event in the natural history of liver cirrhosis. 
From a prognostic perspective, its occurrence marks the transition from the 
compensated to the decompensated stage of the disease, leading to an abrupt 
worsening of patients' life expectancy. Moreover, ascites heralds a turbulent 
clinical course, characterized by acute events and further complications, 
frequent hospitalizations, and eventually death. The pathophysiology of ascites 
classically relies on hemodynamic mechanisms, with effective hypovolemia as the 
pivotal event. Recent discoveries, however, integrated this hypothesis, 
proposing systemic inflammation and immune system dysregulation as key 
mechanisms. The mainstays of ascites treatment are represented by 
anti-mineralocorticoids and loop diuretics, and large volume paracentesis. When 
ascites reaches the stage of refractoriness, however, diuretics administration 
should be cautious due to the high risk of adverse events, and patients should 
be treated with periodic execution of paracentesis or with the placement of a 
trans-jugular intra-hepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS). TIPS reduces portal 
hypertension, eases ascites control, and potentially modify the clinical course 
of the disease. Further studies are required to expand its indications and 
improve the management of complications. Long-term human albumin administration 
has been studied in two RCTs, with contradictory results, and remains a debated 
issue worldwide, despite a potential effectiveness both in ascites control and 
long-term survival. Other treatments (vaptans, vasoconstrictors, or implantable 
drainage systems) present some promising aspects but cannot be currently 
recommended outside clinical protocols or a case-by-case evaluation.

With scarce organ supply, a selection of suitable elderly candidates for 
transplant is needed, as well as auditing the long-term outcomes after 
transplant. We conducted an observational cohort study among our patient cohort 
>60 years old with a long follow up. (1).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We used our database to study the results after transplant 
for 593 patients >60 years old who underwent a transplant between 2000-2017. The 
outcome was compared between live donor (LD; n = 257) recipients, an old-to-old 
(OTO, n = 215) group using an extended criteria donor (ECD) kidney, and a 
young-to-old (YTO, n = 123) group using a standard-criteria donor. The 
Kaplan-Meir method was used to calculate the patient and graft survival and Cox 
regression analysis in order to find risk factors associated with death. (2).
RESULTS: The 5- and 10-year patient survival was significantly better in the LD 
group (92.7% and 66.9%) compared with the OTO group (73.3% and 42.8%) and YTO 
group (70.9% and 40.6%) (p < 0.0001). The 5- and 10-year graft survival rates 
were 90.3% and 68.5% (LD), 61.7% and 30.9% (OTO), and 64.1% and 39.9%, 
respectively (YTO group; p < 0.0001 between the LD and the two DD groups). There 
was no difference in outcome between patients in their 60's and their 70's. 
Factors associated with mortality included: age (HR-1.060), DM (HR-1.773), IHD 
(HR-1.510), and LD/DD (HR-2.865). (3).
CONCLUSIONS: Our 17-years of experience seems to justify the rational of an 
old-to-old allocation policy in the elderly population. Live-donor transplant 
should be encouraged whenever possible. Each individual decision of elderly 
candidates for transplant should be based on the patient's comorbidity and 
predicted life expectancy.

Patients with complex rare genetic syndromes (CRGS) have combined medical 
problems affecting multiple organ systems. Pediatric multidisciplinary (MD) care 
has improved life expectancy, however, transfer to internal medicine is hindered 
by the lack of adequate MD care for adults. We have launched an MD outpatient 
clinic providing syndrome-specific care for adults with CRGS, which, to our 
knowledge, is the first one worldwide in the field of internal medicine. Between 
2015 and 2020, we have treated 720 adults with over 60 syndromes. Eighty-nine 
percent of the syndromes were associated with endocrine problems. We describe 
case series of missed diagnoses and patients who had undergone extensive 
diagnostic testing for symptoms that could actually be explained by their 
syndrome. Based on our experiences and review of the literature, we provide an 
algorithm for the clinical approach of health problems in CRGS adults. We 
conclude that missed diagnoses and needless invasive tests seem common in CRGS 
adults. Due to the increased life expectancy, an increasing number of patients 
with CRGS will transfer to adult endocrinology. Internist-endocrinologists (in 
training) should be aware of their special needs and medical pitfalls of CRGS 
will help prevent the burden of unnecessary diagnostics and under- and 
overtreatment.

Several studies have reported that cellular and soluble components of the tumor 
microenvironment (TME) play a key role in cancer-initiation and progression. 
Considering the relevance and the complexity of TME in cancer biology, recent 
research has focused on the investigation of the TME content, in terms of 
players and informational exchange. Understanding the crosstalk between tumor 
and non-tumor cells is crucial to design more beneficial anti-cancer therapeutic 
strategies. Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is a complex and heterogenous 
tumor mainly caused by asbestos exposure with few treatment options and low life 
expectancy after standard therapy. MPM leukocyte infiltration is rich in 
macrophages. Given the failure of macrophages to eliminate asbestos fibers, 
these immune cells accumulate in pleural cavity leading to the establishment of 
a unique inflammatory environment and to the malignant transformation of 
mesothelial cells. In this inflammatory landscape, stromal and immune cells play 
a driven role to support tumor development and progression via a bidirectional 
communication with tumor cells. Characterization of the MPM microenvironment 
(MPM-ME) may be useful to understand the complexity of mesothelioma biology, 
such as to identify new molecular druggable targets, with the aim to improve the 
outcome of the disease. In this review, we summarize the known evidence about 
the MPM-ME network, including its prognostic and therapeutic relevance.

BACKGROUND: Hong Kong has an ageing Chinese population with high life expectancy 
and a rising number of cancer cases. While population ageing could lead to 
higher incidence, we aim to quantify the demographic and epidemiological 
contributions to this trend by disentangling the effect of these factors.
METHODS: We analysed secular trends of cancer incidences of all cancer sites 
combined, including the five top cancers in men and women in Hong Kong in 
1983-2017, by disentangling effects of demographics (ageing population and 
population growth) and cancer risk/rate change using the RiskDiff methodology.
RESULTS: Overall, age-standardised incidences of all cancers combined in women 
and in men declined over the study period (-5.3% for women, -30.2% for men), but 
total incident cancer case counts increased dramatically (156.5% for women, 96% 
for men). This increase was primarily due to ageing and increasing population 
(95% age, 66.1% growth for women, and 119.4% age, 25.4% growth for men), while 
disease risk for all cancers combined has a decreasing trend (-4.5% for women 
and -48.8% for men). For the site-specific risk changes among the most five 
common cancer types, there were increases in risks of prostate and colorectal 
cancers in men, and breast, endometrial, and thyroid cancers in women.
CONCLUSION: Demographic changes and ageing in our Chinese population resulted in 
a marked increase in the number of cancer diagnoses in Hong Kong in past 
decades. The surge in incident case counts overall is expected to stress the 
healthcare system in terms of the increased demand of healthcare professionals. 
Cancer surveillance should be enhanced in view of the growing demand from older 
patients and the cancer types with fast-increasing incidence rates in our 
population.

Glioblastomas (GBMs) are high-grade malignancies with a poor prognosis. The 
current standard of care for GBM is maximal surgical resection followed by 
radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Despite all these treatments, the overall 
survival is still limited, with a median of 15 months. For patients harboring 
inoperable GBM, due to the anatomical location of the tumor or poor general 
condition of the patient, the life expectancy is even worse. The challenge of 
managing GBM is therefore to improve the local control especially for 
non-surgical patients. Interstitial photodynamic therapy (iPDT) is a minimally 
invasive treatment relying on the interaction of light, a photosensitizer and 
oxygen. In the case of brain tumors, iPDT consists of introducing one or several 
optical fibers in the tumor area, without large craniotomy, to illuminate the 
photosensitized tumor cells. It induces necrosis and/or apoptosis of the tumor 
cells, and it can destruct the tumor vasculature and produces an acute 
inflammatory response that attracts leukocytes. Interstitial PDT has already 
been applied in the treatment of brain tumors with very promising results. 
However, no standardized procedure has emerged from previous studies. Herein, we 
propose a standardized and reproducible workflow for the clinical application of 
iPDT to GBM. This workflow, which involves intraoperative imaging, a dedicated 
treatment planning system (TPS) and robotic assistance for the implantation of 
stereotactic optical fibers, represents a key step in the deployment of iPDT for 
the treatment of GBM. This end-to-end procedure has been validated on a phantom 
in real operating room conditions. The thorough description of a fully 
integrated iPDT workflow is an essential step forward to a clinical trial to 
evaluate iPDT in the treatment of GBM.

Artisanal small-scale gold mining (ASGM) in the Amazon results in the dumping of 
tons of mercury into the environment annually. Despite consensus on the impacts 
of mercury on human health, there are still unknowns regarding: (i) the extent 
to which mercury from ASGM can be dispersed in the environment until it becomes 
toxic to humans; and (ii) the economic value of losses caused by contamination 
becomes evident. The main objective of this study is to propose a methodology to 
evaluate the impacts of ASGM on human health in different contexts in the 
Brazilian Amazon. We connect several points in the literature based on 
hypotheses regarding mercury dispersion in water, its transformation into 
methylmercury, and absorption by fish and humans. This methodology can be used 
as a tool to estimate the extent of environmental damage caused by artisanal 
gold mining, the severity of damage to the health of individuals contaminated by 
mercury and, consequently, can contribute to the application of fines to 
environmental violators. The consequences of contamination are evaluated by 
dose-response functions relating to mercury concentrations in hair and the 
development of the following health outcomes: (i) mild mental retardation, (ii) 
acute myocardial infarction, and (iii) hypertension. From disability-adjusted 
life years and statistical life value, we found that the economic losses range 
from 100,000 to 400,000 USD per kilogram of gold extracted. A case study of the 
Yanomami indigenous land shows that the impacts of mercury from illegal gold 
mining in 2020 totaled 69 million USD, which could be used by local authorities 
to compensate the Yanomami people.

The increasing average life expectancy worldwide results in an elderly 
population with significant health care needs. However, dental care is often not 
a focus of care. It is well known that oral and overall health are directly 
related. Therefore, the Mini Dental Assessment (MDA) was developed to provide a 
simple analysis of oral health status, although it is currently only available 
in paper form, with all associated drawbacks, from illegible writing to the 
inability to quickly search the collected forms. This study aimed to develop a 
digital application (app) for mobile devices that can overcome the problems 
associated with paper forms. After the digital MDA was developed, its usability 
was evaluated by nurses, a questionnaire was answered, and it was compared to 
the analog MDA with patients in a pilot study. The usability of the app (System 
Usability Scale) was 95.18 ± 4.26, representing a very high usability. 
Furthermore, this app showed good clinical applicability. The results also 
showed that the digital MDA was accepted by nurses in their daily routine and 
was preferred to the analog MDA. A follow-up study with a higher number of 
subjects is highly recommended.

The obesity epidemic, mainly due to lifestyle changes in recent decades, leads 
to serious comorbidities that reduce life expectancy. This situation is 
affecting the health policies of many nations around the world. Traditional 
measures such as diet, physical activity, and drugs are often not enough to 
achieve weight loss goals and to maintain the results over time. Bariatric 
surgery (BS) includes various techniques, which favor rapid and sustained weight 
loss. BS is a useful and, in most cases, the best treatment in severe and 
complicated obesity. In addition, it has a greater benefit/risk ratio than 
non-surgical traditional therapies. BS can allow the obese patient to lose 
weight quickly compared with traditional lifestyle changes, and with a greater 
probability of maintaining the results. Moreover, BS promotes improvements in 
metabolic parameters, even diabetes remission, and in the quality of life. These 
changes can lead to an increase of life expectancy by over 6 years on average. 
The nutrition of people before and after BS must be the subject of indications 
from a trained staff, and patients must be followed in the subsequent years to 
reduce the risk of malnutrition and the associated problems. In particular, it 
is still debated whether it is necessary to lose weight prior to surgery, a 
procedure that can facilitate the surgeon's work reducing the surgical risk, but 
at the same time, lengthens preparation times increasing the risks associated 
with concomitant pathologies. Furthermore, preventing nutritional deficiencies 
prior to the intervention can improve the results and reduce short- and 
long-term mortality.

Injury of the extensor hallucis longus (EHL) tendon is relatively rare, but 
surgical repair is necessary to prevent deformity and gait disturbance. Primary 
suturing is possible if the condition is acute, but not when it is chronic. The 
scar tissue between the ruptured ends is a proliferative tissue composed of 
fibroblasts and collagen fibers. Given the histological similarity to normal 
tendons, several studies have reported tendon reconstruction using scar tissue. 
Here, we report a reconstruction of a neglected EHL rupture using interposed 
scar tissue. A 54-year-old female visited our clinic with a weak extension of a 
big toe. She had dropped a knife on her foot a month prior, but did not go to 
hospital. The wound had healed, but she noted dysfunctional extension of the toe 
and increasing pain. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed that EHL 
continuity was lost and that the proximal tendon stump was displaced toward the 
midfoot. Scar tissue running in the direction of the original ligament was 
observed between the ruptured ends. In the surgical field, the scar tissue 
formed a shape similar to the extensor tendon. Therefore, we performed tendon 
reconstruction using the interposed scar tissue. For the first 2 postoperative 
weeks, the ankle and foot were immobilized to protect the repair. Six weeks 
after surgery, the patient commenced full weight-bearing. At the 3-month 
follow-up, active extension of the hallux was possible, with a full range of 
motion. The patient did not feel any discomfort during daily life. Postoperative 
MRI performed at 1 year revealed that the reconstructed EHL exhibited 
homogeneously low signal intensity, and was continuous. The AOFAS Hallux 
Metatarsophalangeal-Interphalangeal scale improved from 57 to 90 points and the 
FAAM scores improved from 74% to 95% (the Activities of Daily Living subscale) 
and from 64% to 94% (the Sports subscale). Scar tissue reconstruction is as 
effective as tendon autografting or allografting, eliminates the risk of donor 
site morbidity and infection, and requires only a small incision and a short 
operative time.

The Republic of Kazakhstan began undergoing a political, economic, and social 
transition after 1991. Population health was declared an important element and 
was backed with a substantial commitment by the central government to health 
policy. We examine key trends in the population health status of the Republic of 
Kazakhstan and seek to understand them in relation to the ongoing political, 
economic, and social changes in society and its aspirations in health policy. We 
used the Global Burden of Disease database and toolkit to extract and analyze 
country-specific descriptive data for the Republic of Kazakhstan to assess life 
expectancy, child mortality, leading causes of mortality, disability-adjusted 
life years, and causes and number of years lived with disability. Life 
expectancy declined from 1990 to 1996 but has subsequently recovered. Ischemic 
heart disease, stroke, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease remain among 
the leading causes of death; child mortality for children under 5 years has 
declined; and cardiovascular risk factors account for the greatest cause of 
disability. Considering its socioeconomic development over the last two decades, 
Kazakhstan continues to lag behind OECD countries on leading health indictors 
despite substantial investments in public health policy. We identify seven 
strategic priorities to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the health 
care system.

Down syndrome (DS) is a complex genetic disorder associated with substantial 
physical, cognitive, and behavioral challenges. Due to better treatment options 
for the physical co-morbidities of DS, the life expectancy of individuals with 
DS is beginning to approach that of the general population. However, the 
cognitive deficits seen in individuals with DS still cannot be addressed 
pharmacologically. In young individuals with DS, the level of intellectual 
disability varies from mild to severe, but cognitive ability generally decreases 
with increasing age, and all individuals with DS have early onset Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) pathology by the age of 40. The present study introduces a novel 
inhibitor for the protein kinase DYRK1A, a key controlling kinase whose encoding 
gene is located on chromosome 21. The novel inhibitor is well characterized for 
use in mouse models and thus represents a valuable tool compound for further 
DYRK1A research.

(1) Background: Gene editing technology, as represented by CRISPR is a powerful 
tool used in biomedical science. However, the editing efficiency of such 
technologies, especially in induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and other 
types of stem cells, is low which hinders its application in regenerative 
medicine; (2) Methods: A gene-editing system, COE, was designed and constructed 
based on CRISPR/Cas12a and Orip/EBNA1, and its editing efficiency was evaluated 
in human embryonic kidney 293T (HEK-293T) cells with flow cytometry and 
restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis. The COE was 
nucleofected into iPSCs, then, the editing efficiency was verified by a 
polymerase chain reaction and Sanger sequencing; (3) Results: With the extension 
of time, COE enables the generation of up to 90% insertion or deletion rates in 
HEK-293T cells. Furthermore, the deletion of a 2.5 kb fragment containing Exon 
51 of the dystrophin gene (DMD) in iPSCs was achieved with high efficiency; out 
of 14 clones analyzed, 3 were positive. Additionally, the Exon 51-deleted iPSCs 
derived from cardiomyocytes had similar expression profiles to those of Duchenne 
muscular dystrophy (DMD) patient-specific iPSCs. Moreover, there was no residue 
of each component of the plasmid in the editing cells; (4) Conclusions: In this 
study, a novel, efficient, and safe gene-editing system, COE, was developed, 
providing a powerful tool for gene editing.

Crown gall is a globally distributed and economically important disease of 
grapevine and other important crop plants. The causal agent of grapevine crown 
gall is tumorigenic Allorhizobium vitis (Ti) strains that harbor a 
tumor-inducing plasmid (pTi). The epidemic of grapevine crown gall has not been 
widely elucidated. In this study, we investigated the genetic diversity of 89 
strains of Ti and nonpathogenic A. vitis to clarify their molecular 
epidemiology. Multi-locus sequence analysis (MLSA) of the partial nucleotide 
sequences of pyrG, recA, and rpoD was performed for molecular typing of A. vitis 
strains isolated from grapevines with crown gall symptoms grown in 30 different 
vineyards, five different countries, mainly in Japan, and seven genomic groups A 
to F were obtained. The results of MLSA and logistic regression indicated that 
the population of genetic group A was significantly related to a range of 
prefectures and that the epidemic of group A strains originated mainly in 
Hokkaido in Japan through soil infection. Moreover, group E strains could have 
been transported by infected nursery stocks. In conclusion, this study indicates 
that both soil infection and transporting of infected nursery stocks are working 
as infection source in Hokkaido.

Early osteoarthritis (EOA) still represents a challenge for clinicians. Although 
there is no consensus on its definition and diagnosis, a prompt therapeutic 
intervention in the early stages can have a significant impact on function and 
quality of life. Exercise remains a core treatment for EOA; however, several 
physical modalities are commonly used in this population. The purpose of this 
paper is to investigate the role of physical agents in the treatment of EOA. A 
technical expert panel (TEP) of 8 medical specialists with expertise in physical 
agent modalities and musculoskeletal conditions performed the review following 
the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and 
Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews) model. The TEP searched for 
evidence of the following physical modalities in the management of EOA: 
"Electric Stimulation Therapy", "Pulsed Electromagnetic field", "Low-Level Light 
Therapy", "Laser Therapy", "Magnetic Field Therapy", "Extracorporeal Shockwave
