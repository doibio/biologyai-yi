Personalization of such targets has also long been advocated, but often with 
little and inappropriate guidance. More recently some have suggested higher 
targets might be indicated, and more specifically lower targets avoided, even in 
those in whom they are easily attained without seeming burden or risk. 
Prospective data from randomized and observational studies, in people with type 
2 diabetes and indeed those without diabetes, find cardiovascular and mortality 
risk are uniformly lowest at lower levels including into the normal range. In 
some studies with large populations, a high proportion of people are found to 
attain such levels, and the UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) and more 
recent studies appear to confirm the importance of starting low and continuing 
long. Studies of cardiovascular events and mortality in people with diabetes 
will already factor in any effect of hypoglycemia, which therefore should not be 
double-counted in setting targets. Nevertheless, some factors should lead to 
modification of target levels, and these will include experience of hypoglycemia 
where therapy change and glucose monitoring cannot ameliorate it and sometimes 
prospectively in those at social or occupational risk. The fact that clinical 
experience will modify targets emphasizes that targets will not be stable over 
time but will change, for example, with occurrence of adverse events or 
perceptions of increase/decreased burden of therapy. The evidence suggests that 
glucose control takes 5 years or more to have any impact on vascular outcomes or 
mortality, so targets may also be higher in those with shorter life expectancy 
or higher health burden or simply reflect individual preferences. This article 
discusses the evidence behind these conclusions.

BACKGROUND: Recovery of motor function following stroke is essential to restore 
adequate functionality. The use of functional electrical stimulation (FES) 
technology as a neuroprosthesis to enhance the motor function of the UL, and 
thus facilitate the performance of ADL, could lead to a stroke patient's greater 
activity and participation in daily life.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to establish whether the application 
of FES in patients who have suffered a stroke with UL motor impairment is able 
to modify and facilitate their reaching patterns, measured by a 
three-dimensional motion capture system.
METHODS: 20 patients with chronic stroke participated in this study. For muscle 
stimulation, the electrical stimulator Compex® was used. Motion analysis was 
performed using the VICON Motion System®. Joint movements of the thorax, 
shoulder and elbow were analyzed in the sagittal plane, during the reaching 
movement under two different conditions of stimulation: FES condition and 
placebo condition.
RESULTS: Differences between FES condition and placebo condition were observed. 
In the FES condition it was recorded: an increased shoulder flexion and elbow 
extension in the reaching movement.
CONCLUSIONS: Functional electrical stimulation improved reaching movement in 
stroke patients with upper limb impairment.

BACKGROUND: In the Caribbean, life expectancy in politically independent 
territories has increasingly diverged from that of territories that remained 
affiliated to their former colonizers. Because these affiliated territories 
differ in degree of political independence, they are not all governed in the 
same way. We assessed whether differences in life expectancy trends between 
Caribbean dependencies and their Western administrators were related to their 
degree of political independence, and which causes of death contributed to 
divergence or convergence in life expectancy.
METHODS: Analysis of age-standardized death rates and decomposition of life 
expectancy differences between France, the Netherlands, UK, USA and their 
Caribbean dependencies by age and cause-of-death during the period 1980-2014.
RESULTS: Life expectancy differences between Western countries and their 
dependencies have generally increased for men and narrowed for women, but trends 
have been much more favorable in the French- than in the Dutch-administered 
territories. The strongest contributions to widening gaps in life expectancy 
between Western countries and their dependencies were from mortality from 
cardiovascular diseases (ischemic heart disease) and external causes (homicide 
and traffic accidents).
CONCLUSION: Dependencies with a stronger political affiliation to a Western 
country experienced more favorable life expectancy developments than 
dependencies that had more autonomy during the 1980-2014 period. The underlying 
mortality differences with Western countries are largely comparable among 
Caribbean territories but differ in magnitude, most notably for cardiovascular 
disease and external causes. This suggests that increases in a territory's 
political autonomy impairs the diffusion of new knowledge and techniques, and/or 
reduces government's effectiveness in implementing policies.

Objective: To investigate the relationship between gut microbiota structure and 
biochemical changes in patients with different types of nonalcoholic fatty liver 
disease (NAFLD), in order to provide evidence for clinical diagnosis and 
prevention of NAFLD. Methods: Forty-eight NAFLD cases (NAFLD group), 40 NAFLD 
cases with type 2 diabetes mellitus (NAFLD combined with type 2 diabetes 
mellitus group) and 30 healthy cases (healthy group) were randomly enrolled, and 
their body mass index, serum alanine aminotransferase, aspartate 
aminotransferase, total bilirubin, total cholesterol, triglyceride, high density 
lipoprotein, low density lipoprotein and uric acid were measured. Serum levels 
of TNF-alpha and fasting insulin were measured using ELISA, and then insulin 
resistance index was calculated. The gut microbiota of three groups of subjects 
was detected using 16S rDNA-based high-throughput sequencing. Lastly, the 
correlations between the various factors were analyzed. The comparison among 
groups was conducted by 2 test, and one-way ANOVA was used for comparison among 
groups with normal distribution and homogeneity of variance. Furthermore, the 
LSD method was used to compare the two groups. K-W rank sum test was used for 
comparison among groups without normal distribution or homogeneity of variance. 
Results: Body mass index, aspartate aminotransferase, triglyceride, total 
cholesterol, low density lipoprotein, uric acid, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, 
fasting insulin and insulin resistance index of NAFLD group were higher than 
healthy group, while the high-density lipoprotein was lower in the healthy 
group, and the difference was statistically significant (P< 0.05). Compared with 
NAFLD group, the life expectancy, fasting blood glucose and insulin resistance 
index of NAFLD combined with type 2 diabetes mellitus group were higher, while 
the body mass index, aspartic acid aminotransferase, total cholesterol and HDL 
levels were decreased, and the difference was statistically significant (P< 
0.05). NAFLD group (P= 0.016) had decreased abundance of firmicutes than healthy 
group, and the abundancy of the firmicutes in the NAFLD combined with type 2 
diabetes group was significantly lower (P< 0.001). The abundance of 
bacteroidetes in NAFLD combined with type 2 diabetes group was higher than 
healthy group, and the difference was statistically significant (P= 0.006). At 
the "genus level," the abundance of Roseburia and Subdoligranulum in the NAFLD 
group was decreased, while the Roseburia in the NAFLD group with type 2 diabetes 
group was significantly lower (P< 0.05). In addition, the abundance of 
Faecalibacterium, Blautia, Anaerostipes and Fusicatenibacter in NAFLD combined 
with type 2 diabetes group was lower than healthy group, and the difference was 
statistically significant (P< 0.001). Fusicatenibacter, Blautia, Anaerostipes, 
Faecalibacterium, and Roseburia were negatively correlated with fasting blood 
glucose and insulin resistance index levels (r< 0,P< 0.05), and positively 
correlated with high-density lipoprotein levels (r> 0,P< 0.05). Fusicatenibacter 
was negatively correlated with tumor necrosis factor-alpha (r= -0.211,P= 0.044), 
and Lachnoclostridium was positively correlated with body mass index, alanine 
aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase levels (r> 0,P< 0.05). 
Fusobacterium was positively correlated with aspartate aminotransferase level 
(r= 0.245,P= 0.019). Escherichia-shigella was positively correlated with fasting 
blood glucose, low-density lipoprotein, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate 
aminotransferase levels (r > 0,P< 0.05). Megamonas was negatively correlated 
with high-density lipoprotein levels (r= -0.231,P= 0.027). Conclusion: A 
structural change of gut microbiota had occurred in patients with NAFLD, 
suggesting changes in some of these bacterial genuses had relation to insulin 
resistance and inflammatory response, which may become a new target for the 
treatment of NAFLD.

Publisher: 目的： 探讨不同类型非酒精性脂肪性肝病(NAFLD)患者肠道菌群结构与生物化学指标改变的相关性，以期为NAFLD临床诊断和防治提供依据。 
方法： 
随机纳入NAFLD患者（NAFLD组）48例、NAFLD合并2型糖尿病患者（NAFLD合并2型糖尿病组）40例和体检健康者（健康组）30例，检测其体质量指数及血清中丙氨酸氨基转移酶、天冬氨酸氨基转移酶、总胆红素、总胆固醇、甘油三酯、高密度脂蛋白、低密度脂蛋白、尿酸和空腹血糖，用酶联免疫吸附法检测血清中肿瘤坏死因子-α和空腹胰岛素并计算胰岛素抵抗指数。用16S 
rDNA高通量测序检测3组对象肠道菌群，最后综合分析各研究因素间的相关性。各组之间的比较采用χ(2)检验，符合正态分布且方差齐的多组间比较采用单因素方差分析，进一步两两比较用LSD法，不符合正态分布或方差齐性的多组间比较采用K-W秩和检验。 
结果： 
NAFLD组体质量指数、天冬氨酸氨基转移酶、甘油三酯、总胆固醇、低密度脂蛋白、尿酸、肿瘤坏死因子-α、空腹胰岛素、胰岛素抵抗指数均高于健康组，高密度脂蛋白低于健康组，差异均有统计学意义(P值均< 
0.05)。与NAFLD组比较，NAFLD合并2型糖尿病组年龄、空腹血糖和胰岛素抵抗指数升高，体质量指数、天冬氨酸氨基转移酶、总胆固醇和高密度脂蛋白降低，差异均有统计学意义(P值均< 
0.05)。与健康组比较，NAFLD组厚壁菌门丰度降低（P = 0.016），NAFLD合并2型糖尿病组厚壁菌门丰度降低（P < 
0.001)。NAFLD合并2型糖尿病组拟杆菌门丰度高于健康组，差异有统计学意义（P = 
0.006)。在"属"水平，NAFLD组Roseburia、Subdoligranulum的丰度降低，且NAFLD合并2型糖尿病组Roseburia明显降低，差异均有统计学意义（P值均< 
0.05)；此外，NAFLD合并2型糖尿病组Faecalibacterium、Blautia、Anaerostipes、Fusicatenibacter丰度均低于健康组，差异均有统计学意义（P值均< 
0.001）。Fusicatenibacter、Blautia、Anaerostipes、Faecalibacterium、Roseburia均与空腹血糖、胰岛素抵抗指数水平负相关（r 
< 0,P < 0.05)，与高密度脂蛋白水平正相关（r > 0，P < 0.05)；Fusicatenibacter与肿瘤坏死因子-α水平负相关（r = 
-0.211，P = 0.044）；Lachnoclostridium与体质量指数、丙氨酸氨基转移酶、天冬氨酸氨基转移酶水平正相关（r > 0，P < 
0.05）；Fusobacterium与天冬氨酸氨基转移酶水平正相关（r = 0.245,P = 
0.019)；Escherichia-shigella与空腹血糖、低密度脂蛋白、丙氨酸氨基转移酶、天冬氨酸氨基转移酶水平正相关（r > 0，P < 
0.05）；Megamonas与高密度脂蛋白水平负相关（r = -0.231，P = 0.027）。 结论： 
NAFLD患者肠道菌群结构发生了改变，部分菌属的改变与胰岛素抵抗和炎症反应有关，这可能成为治疗NAFLD的新"靶点"。.

PURPOSE: Compared with conventional fluorouracil plus cisplatin (FP) regimen, 
gemcitabine plus cisplatin (GP) can prolong survival in patients with recurrent 
or metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma, but the economic impact of this practice 
remains unknown. It's significant to evaluate its values by taking both efficacy 
and cost into consideration.
METHODS: We developed a Markov model with 10 years horizon to compare the 
cost-effectiveness of GP and FP regimen. Clinical data came from a multicentre, 
randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial. Direct costs related to the treatment 
were estimated from the perspective of the Chinese healthcare system. Utility 
values were gathered from published study. Sensitivity analysis was conducted to 
confirm the robustness of the model.
RESULTS: The total cost of FP regimen was $12,587 and yielded 0.964 QALYs, while 
the total cost of GP regimen was $17,920 and yielded 1.685 QALYs. The ICER of GP 
regimen versus FP regimen was $7,386 which was far less than the 
willingness-to-pay threshold ($26,508) in China.
CONCLUSION: From the perspective of Chinese healthcare system, GP regimen with 
superior efficacy was proved to be more cost-effective than the traditional FP 
regimen. It is likely that GP regimen may be recommended as the primarily 
first-line treatment option for recurrent or metastatic nasopharyngeal 
carcinoma.

BACKGROUND: There is an interest in quantifying dynamic hip kinematics before 
and after total hip arthroplasty (THA) during chair-rising: one of daily life 
activities.
METHODS: The study consisted of 21 patients who underwent unilateral total hip 
arthroplasty for symptomatic osteoarthritis. We obtained continuous radiographs 
using a flat-panel X-ray detector while the participants rose from chair. We 
assessed the pre and postoperative hip joint's movements using 
three-dimensional-to-two-dimensional model-to-image registration techniques. We 
also measured minimum liner-to-neck distances at maximum hip flexion and 
extension as anterior and posterior liner-to-neck distances, respectively. 
Multivariate analyses were applied to determine which factors were associated 
with liner-to-neck distances.
RESULTS: The cup inclination, cup anteversion, and stem anteversion averaged 
37.4°, 23.1°, and 30.1°, respectively. Significantly larger maximum hip flexion 
angle (72°) was found during chair-rising after THA compared to that before THA 
(63°, P < 0.01). The anterior pelvic tilt at the maximum hip flexion after THA 
(3° of anterior tilt) was significantly (P < 0.05) anterior compared to that 
before THA (1° of posterior tilt). The anterior and posterior liner-to-neck 
distances averaged 12.3 mm and 8.1 mm, respectively, with a significant 
difference (P < 0.01). No liner-to-neck contact was found in any hips. In 
multivariate analysis, the hip flexion angle, cup inclination, stem anteversion 
and head diameter were significantly associated with the anterior liner-to-neck 
distance (P < 0.05), the hip extension angle, cup anteversion, neck length and 
with or without elevated rim were significantly associated with the posterior 
liner-to-neck distance (P < 0.05, 0.01, 0.05, 0.01, respectively).
CONCLUSION: This study indicates that well-positioned THA provide increased 
range of hip flexion with sufficient anterior liner-to-neck clearance during 
chair-rising. Dynamic hip kinematics, component position, and hardware variables 
significantly influenced on the liner-to-neck clearance under weight-bearing 
conditions.

We investigated the impact of diabetes on US life expectancy by sex and 
race/ethnicity using a prospective cohort study design. Cohorts were drawn from 
1997-2009 waves of the National Health Interview Survey and linked to death 
records through December 31, 2011. We combined data on the prevalence of 
diabetes among decedents with estimates of the hazard ratios of individuals 
diagnosed with diabetes to calculate population attributable fractions (PAFs) by 
age, sex, and race/ethnicity at ages 30 and above. These estimates were then 
applied to deaths in the official US life table for 2010 to estimate effects of 
diabetes on life expectancy. Diabetes was responsible for a reduction of 0.83 
years of life expectancy for men at age 30 and 0.89 years for 30-year-old women. 
The impact was greatest among Black women at 1.05 years. Estimates based on 
traditional demographic and actuarial methods using the frequency with which a 
disease appears as an underlying cause of death on death certificates produced a 
reduction in life expectancy at age 30 of only 0.33 years. We conclude that 
diabetes is substantially reducing US longevity and that its effect is seriously 
underestimated when using data on underlying causes of death.

INTRODUCTION: Nintedanib slows disease progression in patients with idiopathic 
pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) by reducing the rate of decline in forced vital 
capacity, with an adverse event profile that is manageable for most patients. We 
used data from six clinical trials to characterise the safety and tolerability 
profile of nintedanib and to investigate its effects on survival.
METHODS: Data from patients treated with ≥1 dose of nintedanib 150 mg two times 
per day or placebo in the 52-week TOMORROW trial and/or its open-label 
extension; the two 52-week INPULSIS trials and/or their open-label extension, 
INPULSIS-ON; and a Phase IIIb trial with a placebo-controlled period of ≥6 
months followed by open-label nintedanib were pooled. All adverse events, 
irrespective of causality, were included in descriptive analyses. Parametric 
survival distributions were fit to pooled Kaplan-Meier survival data from the 
trials and extrapolated to estimate long-term survival.
RESULTS: There were 1126 patients in the pooled nintedanib group and 565 
patients in the pooled placebo group. The mean duration of nintedanib treatment 
was 28 months. No new safety signals were observed. Incidence rates of bleeding, 
liver enzyme elevations and cardiovascular events were consistent with those 
observed in the INPULSIS trials. Diarrhoea was reported at a lower event rate in 
the pooled nintedanib group than in nintedanib-treated patients in the INPULSIS 
trials (76.5 vs 112.6 events per 100 patient exposure-years) and infrequently 
led to permanent treatment discontinuation (3.6 events per 100 patient 
exposure-years). Based on the Weibull distribution, mean (95% CI) survival was 
estimated as 11.6 (9.6, 14.1) years in nintedanib-treated patients and 3.7 (2.5, 
5.4) years in placebo-treated patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on pooled data from six clinical trials, the adverse event 
profile of nintedanib was manageable for most patients. Exploratory analyses 
based on extrapolation of survival data suggest that nintedanib extends life 
expectancy in patients with IPF.

INTRODUCTION: The advent of antiretroviral therapy (ART) has dramatically slowed 
down the progression of HIV. This study assesses the disparities in survival, 
life expectancy and determinants of survival among HIV-infected people receiving 
ART.
METHODS: Using data from one of Nepal's largest population-based retrospective 
cohort studies (in Kathmandu, Nepal), we followed a total of 3191 HIV-infected 
people aged 15 years and older who received ART over the period of 2004-2015. We 
created abridged life tables with age-specific survival rates and life 
expectancy, stratified by sex, ethnicity, CD4 cell counts and the WHO-classified 
clinical stage at initiation of ART.
RESULTS: HIV-infected people who initiated ART with a CD4 cell count of 
>200 cells/cm3 at 15 years had 27.4 (22.3 to 32.6) years of additional life. 
People at WHO-classified clinical stage I and 15 years of age who initiated ART 
had 23.1 (16.6 to 29.7) years of additional life. Life expectancy increased 
alongside the CD4 cell count and decreased as clinical stages progressed upward. 
The study cohort contributed 8484.8 person years, with an overall survival rate 
of 3.3 per 100 person years (95% CI 3.0 to 3.7).
CONCLUSIONS: There are disparities in survival among HIV-infected people in 
Nepal. The survival payback of ART is proven; however, late diagnosis or the 
health system as a whole will affect the control and treatment of the illness. 
This study offers evidence of the benefits of enrolling early in care in general 
and ART in particular.

INTRODUCTION: Concern for health inequalities is an important driver of health 
policy in India; however, much of the empirical evidence regarding health 
inequalities in the country is piecemeal focusing only on specific diseases or 
on access to particular treatments. This study estimates inequalities in health 
across the whole life course for the entire Indian population. These estimates 
are used to calculate the socioeconomic disparities in life expectancy at birth 
in the population.
METHODS: Population mortality data from the Indian Sample Registration System 
were combined with data on mortality rates by wealth quintile from the National 
Family Health Survey to calculate wealth quintile specific mortality rates. 
Results were calculated separately for males and females as well as for urban 
and rural populations. Life tables were constructed for each subpopulation and 
used to calculate distributions of life expectancy at birth by wealth quintile. 
Absolute gap and relative gap indices of inequality were used to quantify the 
health disparity in terms of life expectancy at birth between the richest and 
poorest fifths of households.
RESULTS: Life expectancy at birth was 65.1 years for the poorest fifth of 
households in India as compared with 72.7 years for the richest fifth of 
households. This constituted an absolute gap of 7.6 years and a relative gap of 
11.7 %. Women had both higher life expectancy at birth and narrower 
wealth-related disparities in life expectancy than men. Life expectancy at birth 
was higher across the wealth distribution in urban households as compared with 
rural households with inequalities in life expectancy widest for men living in 
urban areas and narrowest for women living in urban areas.
CONCLUSION: As India progresses towards Universal Health Coverage, the baseline 
social distributions of health estimated in this study will allow policy makers 
to target and monitor the health equity impacts of health policies introduced.

BACKGROUND: Pharmacists working in community and primary care are increasingly 
developing advanced skills to provide enhanced services, particularly in dealing 
with minor acute illness. These services can potentially free-up primary care 
physicians' time; however, it is not clear whether they are sufficiently cost 
effective to be recommended for wider provision in the UK.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to review published economic evaluations of 
enhanced pharmacy services in the community and primary care settings.
METHODS: We undertook a systematic review of economic evaluations of enhanced 
pharmacy services to inform NICE guidelines for emergency and acute care. The 
review protocol was developed and agreed with the guideline committee. The 
National Health Service Economic Evaluation Database, Health Technology 
Assessment Database, Health Economic Evaluations Database, MEDLINE and EMBASE 
were searched in December 2016 and the search was updated in March 2018. Studies 
were assessed for applicability and methodological quality using the NICE 
Economic Evaluation Checklist.
RESULTS: Of 3124 records, 13 studies published in 14 papers were included. The 
studies were conducted in the UK, Spain, The Netherlands, Australia, Italy and 
Canada. Settings included community pharmacies, primary care/general practice 
surgeries and patients' homes. Most of the studies were assessed as partially 
applicable with potentially serious limitations. Services provided in community 
and primary care settings were found to be either dominant or cost effective, at 
a £20,000 per quality-adjusted life-year threshold, compared with usual care. 
Those delivered in the patient's home were not found to be cost effective.
CONCLUSIONS: Advanced pharmacy services appear to be cost effective when 
delivered in community and primary care settings, but not in domiciliary 
settings. Expansion in the provision of these services in community and primary 
care can be recommended for wider implementation.

Coronary artery disease (CAD) has significant social and economic implications. 
It is necessary to create tools to identify the most cost-effectiveness 
treatments, which can assist clinicians in their therapeutic decisions so that 
the maximum possible benefit is reached with the lowest possible cost. 
Effectiveness must be measured by final treatment goals in which the most 
effective interventions are those with the lowest costs. This study is aimed to 
systematically review and compare the studies conducted on the 
cost-effectiveness of the three coronary artery disease treatment strategies 
(medical treatment, percutaneous coronary intervention, and coronary artery 
bypass graft). In this systematic review, the databases NHS Economic Evaluation 
Database, Embase, MEDLINE, Science Direct, and Scopus were searched for studies 
on the cost-effectiveness of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) and 
percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) compared to medical therapy (MT) in 
patients with coronary artery disease between 1 January 2004 to 30 September 
2018. The quality appraisal of the included studies was examined using the 
Consolidated Health Economics Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) statement. 
Out of 186 unique retrievals, 8 studies were included. The results showed that 
the all studies clearly stated the time horizon of the study and included direct 
medical costs in their analysis. In addition, in most of the studies, 
quality-adjusted life years (QALY) were the main outcome used for measuring the 
effectiveness. The studies reported various ranges of the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER); accordingly, the highest ratio was observed in 
the USA ($212,800) for PCI v MT and the lowest ratio was observed in Brazil 
($4403) for CABG v MT. Although the results of the studies were different in 
terms of a number of aspects, such as the viewpoint of the study, the study 
horizons, and the costs of expenditure items, they reached similar results. 
Based on the result of the present study, it seems that each three treatment 
strategies for CAD yielded improvements in QALY.

The recent extension of genetic tools to the domestic cat, together with the 
serendipitous consequences of selective breeding, have been essential to the 
study of the genetic diseases that affect them. Cats are increasingly presented 
for veterinary surveillance and share many of human's heritable diseases, 
allowing them to serve as natural models of these conditions. Feline diabetes 
mellitus is a common condition in domestic cats that bears close pathological 
and clinical resemblance to type 2 diabetes in humans, including pancreatic 
β-cell dysfunction and peripheral insulin resistance. In Australia, New Zealand 
and Europe, diabetes mellitus is almost four times more common in cats of the 
Burmese breed than in other breeds. This geographically based breed 
predisposition parallels familial and population clustering of type 2 diabetes 
in humans. As a genetically isolated population, the Australian Burmese breed 
provides a spontaneous, naturally occurring genetic model of type 2 diabetes. 
Genetically isolated populations typically exhibit extended linkage 
disequilibrium and increased opportunity for deleterious variants to reach high 
frequencies over many generations due to genetic drift. Studying complex 
diseases in such populations allows for tighter control of confounding factors 
including environmental heterogeneity, allelic frequencies and population 
stratification. The homogeneous genetic background of Australian Burmese cats 
may provide a unique opportunity to either refine genetic signals previously 
associated with type 2 diabetes or identify new risk factors for this disease.

It is uncertain whether Latin America and Caribbean (LAC) countries are 
approaching a single mortality regime. Over the last three decades, LAC has 
experienced major public health interventions and the highest number of 
homicides in the world. However, these interventions and homicide rates are not 
evenly shared across countries. This study documents trends in life expectancy 
and lifespan variability for 20 LAC countries, 2000-14. By extending a previous 
method, we decompose differences in lifespan variability between LAC and a 
developed world benchmark into cause-specific effects. For both sexes, 
dispersion of amenable diseases through the age span makes the largest 
contribution to the gap between LAC and the benchmark. Additionally, for males, 
the concentration of homicides, accidents, and suicides in mid-life further 
impedes mortality convergence. Great disparity exists in the region: while some 
countries are rapidly approaching the developed regime, others remain far behind 
and suffer a clear disadvantage in population health.

BACKGROUND: More people remain in the workforce into their late life as people's 
life expectancy increases. This study examined the relationship between work 
stress and depressive symptoms of older workers in mainland China, focusing on 
the interplay between work stress with family and community factors in three 
(i.e., urban, rural, and migrant) settings.
METHODS: National representative survey data on the Chinese labor force 
collected by the Social Science Research Center of Sun-Yetsen University in 2014 
were used. The sample consisted of 5,751 workers aged 50 and above recruited 
from 29 out of 31 provinces in mainland China.
RESULTS: Work stress had a consistent and robust effect on depressive symptoms 
across older worker groups. Moreover, it interacted with family and community 
factors differentially in three settings. For migrant older workers, work stress 
was a dominant factor affecting their depressive symptoms. Among rural older 
workers, the influence of work stress on depressive symptoms depended on their 
family debt and neighborhood cohesion levels.
CONCLUSION: Stressors from work, family, and community comprised a general model 
that explains depressive symptoms in Chinese older workers. Interventions or 
service programs aimed at reducing work stress and improving mental health among 
older adults should consider the complexity of intertwining family and community 
dynamics as well as respective strengths in urban, rural, and migrant 
communities.

Fusion toxins consisting of an affinity protein fused to toxic polypeptides 
derived from Pseudomonas exotoxin A (ETA) are promising agents for targeted 
cancer therapy. In this study, we examined whether fusion toxins consisting of 
an albumin binding domain‑derived affinity protein (ADAPT) interacting with 
human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), coupled to the ETA‑derived 
polypeptides PE38X8 or PE25, with or without an albumin binding domain (ABD) for 
half‑life extension, can be used for specific killing of HER2‑expressing cells. 
The fusion toxins could easily be expressed in a soluble form in 
Escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity. All constructs had strong affinity 
for HER2 (KD 10 to 26 nM) and no tendency for aggregation could be detected. The 
fusion toxins including the ABD showed strong interaction with human and mouse 
serum albumin [equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) 1 to 3 nM and 2 to 10 nM, 
respectively]. The in vitro investigation of the cytotoxic potential revealed 
IC50‑values in the picomolar range for cells expressing high levels of HER2. The 
specificity was also demonstrated, by showing that free HER2 receptors on the 
target cells are required for fusion toxin activity. In mice, the fusion toxins 
containing the ABD exhibited an appreciably longer time in circulation. The 
uptake was highest in liver and kidney. Fusion with PE25 was associated with the 
highest hepatic uptake. Collectively, the results suggest that fusion toxins 
consisting of ADAPTs and ETA‑derivatives are promising agents for targeted 
cancer therapy.

Alterations in the normal gastrointestinal microbial community caused by 
unhealthy diet, environmental factors, and antibiotic overuse may severely 
affect human health and well-being. Novel antimicrobial drug formulations 
targeting pathogenic microflora while not affecting or even supporting symbiotic 
microflora are urgently needed. Here we report fabrication of a novel 
antimicrobial nanocontainer based on halloysite nanotubes loaded with curcumin 
and protected with a dextrin outer layer (HNTs+Curc/DX) and its effective use to 
suppress the overgrowth of pathogenic bacteria in Caenorhabditis elegans 
nematodes. Nanocontainers have been obtained using vacuum-facilitated loading of 
hydrophobic curcumin into halloysite lumens. We have applied UV-vis and infrared 
spectroscopy, thermogravimetry and microscopy to characterize the HNTs+Curc/DX 
nanocontainers. In experiments in vitro we found that HNTs+Curc/DX effectively 
suppressed the growth of Serratia marcescens cells, whereas Escherichia coli 
bacteria were not affected. We applied HNTs+Curc/DX nanocontainers to alleviate 
the S. marcescens infection in C. elegans nematodes in vivo. The nematodes 
ingest HNTs+Curc/DX at 4-6 ng per worm, which results in improvement of the 
nematodes' fertility and life expectancy. Remarkably, treatment of S. 
marcescens-infected nematodes with HNTs+Curc/DX nanocontainers completely 
restored the longevity, demonstrating the enhanced bioavailability of 
hydrophobic curcumin. We believe that our results reported here open new avenues 
for fabrication of effective antimicrobial nanoformulations based on hydrophobic 
drugs and clay nanotubes.

Efficiently copying mixed-sequence oligonucleotide templates nonenzymatically is 
a long-standing problem both with respect to the origin of life, and with regard 
to bottom up efforts to synthesize artificial living systems. Here we report an 
efficient and sequence-general nonenzymatic process in which RNA templates 
direct the synthesis of a complementary strand composed of N3'→P5' 
phosphoramidate DNA (3'-NP-DNA) using 3'-amino-2',3'-dideoxyribonucleotides 
activated with 2-aminoimidazole. Using only the four canonical nucleobases (A, 
G, C, and T) of modern DNA, we demonstrate the chemical copying of a variety of 
mixed-sequence RNA templates, both in solution and within model protocells, into 
complementary 3'-NP-DNA strands. Templates up to 25 nucleotides long were 
chemically transcribed with an average stepwise yield of 96-97%. The 
nonenzymatic template-directed generation of primer extension products long 
enough to encode active ribozymes and/or aptamers inside model protocells 
suggests possible routes to the synthesis of evolving cellular systems.

Recent improvements in post-transplant care have led to an increased life 
expectancy for recipients of organ transplants. These patients require lifelong 
immunosuppression, which is associated with an increased incidence of malignant 
disease. Skin cancers are the most common malignancies seen in recipients of 
organ transplants and are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. 
This review describes factors pertaining to the development and prognosis of 
skin cancers in recipients of organ transplants, as well as outlining prevention 
and management strategies in this cohort.

BACKGROUND: Chondroitin sulfate (CS) chains are prominent extra/pericellular 
matrix components in the central nervous system (CNS) and can exert positive or 
negative regulatory effects on neurite outgrowth, depending on the CS structure 
and the amount. Despite the remarkable abilities of highly sulfated forms of CS 
chains to enhance neurite outgrowth, the neuronal recognition systems for such 
promotional CS chains, including CS-D polysaccharide, remain to be fully 
elucidated.
METHODS: We explored the molecular basis of the CS-D-mediated neurite extension 
using primary hippocampal neurons cultured on substrate precoated with CS-D 
polysaccharides, and evaluated functional involvement of a distinct integrin 
heterodimer as a novel neuronal CS receptor for CS-D.
RESULTS: We identified an extracellular matrix receptor, integrin αVβ3, as a 
functional receptor for CS-D. CS-D, but not CS-C (a precursor form of CS-D) 
showed significant binding affinity toward recombinant integrin αVβ3 heterodimer 
and activated intracellular signaling(s) involving focal adhesion kinase (FAK) 
and Src/Fyn kinase. Functional blockade of the respective players for integrin 
signaling abrogated the promotional effects of CS-D. We also found the existence 
of CS-D-induced integrin activation system in neuronal stem/progenitor cell 
population.
CONCLUSIONS: The neuronal cell surface integrin αVβ3 can function as a CS 
receptor for a highly sulfated CS subtype, CS-D.
GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: Our findings are the first to demonstrate that 
CS-dependent neurite outgrowth promotion is exerted via direct activation of 
specific integrin heterodimers on neuronal cell surfaces, providing new insights 
into understanding the CS-sensing machineries that regulate CNS development and 
regeneration.
