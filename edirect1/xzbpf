Measuring Health Utilities in Children and Adolescents: A Systematic Review of 
the Literature.

of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, United Kingdom.

BACKGROUND: The objective of this review was to evaluate the use of all direct 
and indirect methods used to estimate health utilities in both children and 
adolescents. Utilities measured pre- and post-intervention are combined with the 
time over which health states are experienced to calculate quality-adjusted life 
years (QALYs). Cost-utility analyses (CUAs) estimate the cost-effectiveness of 
health technologies based on their costs and benefits using QALYs as a measure 
of benefit. The accurate measurement of QALYs is dependent on using appropriate 
methods to elicit health utilities.
OBJECTIVE: We sought studies that measured health utilities directly from 
patients or their proxies. We did not exclude those studies that also included 
adults in the analysis, but excluded those studies focused only on adults.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: We evaluated 90 studies from a total of 1,780 selected 
from the databases. 47 (52%) studies were CUAs incorporated into randomised 
clinical trials; 23 (26%) were health-state utility assessments; 8 (9%) 
validated methods and 12 (13%) compared existing or new methods. 22 unique 
direct or indirect calculation methods were used a total of 137 times. Direct 
calculation through standard gamble, time trade-off and visual analogue scale 
was used 32 times. The EuroQol EQ-5D was the most frequently-used single method, 
selected for 41 studies. 15 of the methods used were generic methods and the 
remaining 7 were disease-specific. 48 of the 90 studies (53%) used some form of 
proxy, with 26 (29%) using proxies exclusively to estimate health utilities.
CONCLUSIONS: Several child- and adolescent-specific methods are still being 
developed and validated, leaving many studies using methods that have not been 
designed or validated for use in children or adolescents. Several studies failed 
to justify using proxy respondents rather than administering the methods 
directly to the patients. Only two studies examined missing responses to the 
methods administered with respect to the patients' ages.

BACKGROUND: Neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2) is an autosomal-dominant tumour 
predisposition syndrome characterised by bilateral vestibular schwannomas, 
considerable morbidity and reduced life expectancy. Although genotype-phenotype 
correlations are well established in NF2, little is known about effects of 
mutation type or location within the gene on mortality. Improvements in NF2 
diagnosis and management have occurred, but their effect on patient survival is 
unknown.
METHODS: We evaluated clinical and molecular predictors of mortality in 1192 
patients (771 with known causal mutations) identified through the UK National 
NF2 Registry. Kaplan-Meier survival and Cox regression analyses were used to 
evaluate predictors of mortality, with jackknife adjustment of parameter SEs to 
account for the strong intrafamilial phenotypic correlations that occur in NF2.
RESULTS: The study included 241 deaths during 10 995 patient-years of follow-up 
since diagnosis. Early age at diagnosis and the presence of intracranial 
meningiomas were associated with increased mortality, and having a mosaic, 
rather than non-mosaic, NF2 mutation was associated with reduced mortality. 
Patients with splice-site or missense mutations had lower mortality than 
patients with truncating mutations (OR 0.459, 95% CI 0.213 to 0.990, and OR 
0.196, 95% CI 0.213 to 0.990, respectively). Patients with splice-site mutations 
in exons 6-15 had lower mortality than patients with splice-site mutations in 
exons 1-5 (OR 0.333, 95% CI 0.129 to 0.858). The mortality of patients with NF2 
diagnosed in more recent decades was lower than that of patients diagnosed 
earlier.
CONCLUSIONS: Continuing advances in molecular diagnosis, imaging and treatment 
of NF2-associated tumours offer hope for even better survival in the future.

The cost-effectiveness of a less intensive fracture liaison service is unknown. 
We evaluated a fracture liaison service that had been educating and referring 
patients for secondary prevention of osteoporotic fractures for 6 years. Our 
results suggest that a less intensive fracture liaison service, with moderate 
effectiveness, can still be worthwhile.
INTRODUCTION: Fragility fractures are common among older patients; the risk of 
re-fracture is high but could be reduced with treatments; different versions of 
fracture liaison service have emerged to reduce recurrent osteoporotic 
fractures. But the cost-effectiveness of a less intensive model is unknown. The 
objective of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of the Ontario 
Fracture Clinic Screening program, a fracture liaison service that had been 
educating and referring fragility fracture patients across Ontario, Canada to 
receive bone mineral density testing and osteoporosis treatments since 2007.
METHODS: We developed a Markov model to assess the cost-effectiveness of the 
program over the patients' remaining lifetime, using rates of bone mineral 
density testing and osteoporosis treatment and cost of intervention from the 
program, and supplemented it with the published literature. The analysis took 
the perspective of a third-party health-care payer. Costs and benefits were 
discounted at 5 % per year. Sensitivity analyses assessed the effects of 
different assumptions on the results.
RESULTS: The program improved quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) by 4.3 years 
and led to increased costs of CAD $83,000 for every 1000 patients screened, at a 
cost of $19,132 per QALY gained. The enhanced model, the Bone Mineral Density 
(BMD) Fast Track program that includes ordering bone mineral density testing, 
was even more cost-effective ($5720 per QALY gained).
CONCLUSIONS: The Ontario Fracture Clinic Screening program appears to be a 
cost-effective way to reduce recurrent osteoporotic fractures.

A number of classes of proteins have been engineered for high stability using 
consensus sequence design methods. Here we describe the engineering of a novel 
albumin binding domain (ABD) three-helix bundle protein. The resulting 
engineered ABD molecule, called ABDCon, is expressed at high levels in the 
soluble fraction of Escherichia coli and is highly stable, with a melting 
temperature of 81.5°C. ABDCon binds human, monkey and mouse serum albumins with 
affinity as high as 61 pM. The solution structure of ABDCon is consistent with 
the three-helix bundle design and epitope mapping studies enabled a precise 
definition of the albumin binding interface. Fusion of a 10 kDa scaffold protein 
to ABDCon results in a long terminal half-life of 60 h in mice and 182 h in 
cynomolgus monkeys. To explore the link between albumin affinity and in vivo 
exposure, mutations were designed at the albumin binding interface of ABDCon 
yielding variants that span an 11 000-fold range in affinity. The PK properties 
of five such variants were determined in mice in order to demonstrate the 
tunable nature of serum half-life, exposure and clearance with variations in 
albumin binding affinity.

OBJECTIVES: This paper estimates informal care need using the health of the 
patient. The results can be used to predict changes in informal care associated 
with changes in the health of the patient measured using EQ-5D.
METHODS: Data was used from a prospective survey of inpatients containing 59,512 
complete responses across 44,494 individuals. The number of days a friend or 
relative has needed to provide care or help with normal activities in the last 
6 weeks was estimated using the health of the patient measured by EQ-5D, ICD 
chapter and other health and sociodemographic data. A variety of different 
regression models were estimated that are appropriate for the distribution of 
the informal care dependent variable, which has large spikes at 0 (zero informal 
care) and 42 days (informal care every day).
RESULTS: The preferred model that most accurately predicts the distribution of 
the data is the zero-inflated negative binomial with variable inflation. The 
results indicate that improving the health of the patient reduces informal care 
need. The relationship between ICD chapter and informal care need is not as 
clear.
CONCLUSIONS: The preferred zero-inflated negative binomial with variable 
inflation model can be used to predict changes in informal care associated with 
changes in the health of the patient measured using EQ-5D and these results can 
be applied to existing datasets to inform economic evaluation. Limitations 
include recall bias and response bias of the informal care data, and 
restrictions of the dataset to exclude some patient groups.

Fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab (FCR) has represented a significant 
treatment advancement in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). In the new scenario 
of targeted agents, there is an increasing interest in identifying patients who 
gain the maximum benefit from FCR. In this observational multicenter 
retrospective analysis of 404 CLL patients receiving frontline FCR, the 
combination of three biomarkers that are widely tested before treatment (IGHV 
mutation status, 11q deletion and 17p deletion; available in 80% of the study 
cohort) allowed to identify a very low-risk category of patients carrying 
mutated IGHV genes but neither 11q or 17p deletion that accounted for 28% of all 
cases. The majority of very low-risk patients (71%) remained free of progression 
after treatment and their hazard of relapse decreased after 4 years from FCR. 
The life expectancy of very low-risk patients (91% at 5 years) was 
superimposable to that observed in the matched normal general population, 
indicating that neither the disease nor complications of its treatment affected 
survival in this favorable CLL group. These findings need a prospective 
validation and may be helpful for the design of clinical trials aimed at 
comparing FCR to new targeted treatments of CLL, and, possibly, for optimized 
disease management.

In the present systematic review with meta-analysis, we sought to determine the 
current strength of evidence for or against off-pump and on-pump coronary artery 
bypass grafting (CABG) with regard to hard clinical end-points, graft patency 
and cost-effectiveness. We performed a meta-analysis of only randomized 
controlled trials (RCT) which reported at least one of the desired end-points 
including: (i) major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE), (ii) 
all-cause mortality, (iii) myocardial infarction, (iv) cerebrovascular accident, 
(v) repeat revascularization, (vi) graft patency and (vii) cost-effectiveness. 
The pooled treatment effects [odds ratio (OR) or weighted mean difference, 95% 
confidence intervals (95% CIs)] were assessed using a fixed or random effects 
model. A total of 16 904 patients from 51 studies were identified after 
literature search of the major databases using a predefined keyword list. The 
incidence of MACCE did not differ between the groups, neither during the first 
30 days (OR: 0.93; 95% CI: 0.82-1.04) nor for the longest available follow-up 
(OR: 1.01; 95% CI: 0.92-1.12). While the incidence of mid-term graft failure 
(OR: 1.37; 95% CI: 1.09-1.72) and the need for repeat revascularization (OR: 
1.55; 95% CI: 1.33-1.80) was increased after off-pump surgery, on-pump surgery 
was associated with an increased occurrence of stroke (OR: 0.74; 95% CI: 
0.58-0.95), renal impairment (OR: 0.79; 95% CI: 0.71-0.89) and mediastinitis 
(OR: 0.44; 95% CI: 0.31-0.62). There was no difference with regard to hard 
clinical end-points between on- or off-pump surgery, including myocardial 
infarction or mortality. The present systematic review emphasizes that both off- 
and on-pump surgery provide excellent and comparable results in patients 
requiring surgical revascularization. The choice for either strategy should take 
into account the individual patient profile (comorbidities, life expectancy, 
etc.) and importantly, the surgeon's experience in performing on- or off-pump 
CABG in their routine practice.

[How to care for elderly patients with cognitive impairment?].

Mild cognitive impairment occurs frequently with ageing, concerning memory 
complaint, attention and executive dysfunction without any consequence on the 
activities of daily living. They are strongly linked to the presence of vascular 
risk factors in adulthood. Nevertheless with the continuous progression of life 
expectancy, the incidence of dementia drastically increases after sixty-five 
years of age and the number of old people with dementia is expected to increase 
by 75% in 2030 in France. Caring for elderly patients with cancer needs to face 
the possibility of cognitive impairment and its consequences on a good 
comprehension of diagnosis and treatment and ability to properly take 
medication. Comprehensive geriatric assessment can help to diagnose cognitive 
impairment and evaluate the consequences on instrumental activities of daily 
living (IADL) and activities of daily living (ADL). Home care may be organised 
with the help of the family or social workers. Physiotherapy and speech 
rehabilitation are often useful. Assistance for housekeeping, shopping and 
cooking may be financed by social organisations such as APA in France. Complex 
cases must be referred to case managers in homes for patients suffering for 
Alzheimer's disease (MAIA) who liaise between doctors and home carers with good 
results.

BACKGROUND: Smokeless tobacco is consumed in most countries in the world. In 
view of its widespread use and increasing awareness of the associated risks, 
there is a need for a detailed assessment of its impact on health. We present 
the first global estimates of the burden of disease due to consumption of 
smokeless tobacco by adults.
METHODS: The burden attributable to smokeless tobacco use in adults was 
estimated as a proportion of the disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) lost and 
deaths reported in the 2010 Global Burden of Disease study. We used the 
comparative risk assessment method, which evaluates changes in population health 
that result from modifying a population's exposure to a risk factor. Population 
exposure was extrapolated from country-specific prevalence of smokeless tobacco 
consumption, and changes in population health were estimated using 
disease-specific risk estimates (relative risks/odds ratios) associated with it. 
Country-specific prevalence estimates were obtained through systematically 
searching for all relevant studies. Disease-specific risks were estimated by 
conducting systematic reviews and meta-analyses based on epidemiological 
studies.
RESULTS: We found adult smokeless tobacco consumption figures for 115 countries 
and estimated burden of disease figures for 113 of these countries. Our 
estimates indicate that in 2010, smokeless tobacco use led to 1.7 million DALYs 
lost and 62,283 deaths due to cancers of mouth, pharynx and oesophagus and, 
based on data from the benchmark 52 country INTERHEART study, 4.7 million DALYs 
lost and 204,309 deaths from ischaemic heart disease. Over 85 % of this burden 
was in South-East Asia.
CONCLUSIONS: Smokeless tobacco results in considerable, potentially preventable, 
global morbidity and mortality from cancer; estimates in relation to ischaemic 
heart disease need to be interpreted with more caution, but nonetheless suggest 
that the likely burden of disease is also substantial. The World Health 
Organization needs to consider incorporating regulation of smokeless tobacco 
into its Framework Convention for Tobacco Control.

The life expectancy of women has risen in the past century from 48years to more 
than 80. The decline of endogenous estrogen production (in particular, the 
principal circulating physiological hormone, 17β-estradiol) at menopause (which 
occurs at an average of 51years) is often accompanied by a series of functional 
disorders that affect quality of life (QoL). This estrogen deficiency affects 
different tissues and results in an increase in the prevalence of various 
disorders, including but not limited to osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease. 
Hormone therapy for menopause is a relatively recent biomedical challenge, which 
underwent a downturn after the Women Health Initiative study of older 
postmenopausal women. We will summarize the WHI findings in the first part of 
this article. At Inserm unit 1048, we are working on understanding the 
protective effects of estrogen against the development of atherosclerosis and 
type 2 diabetes in murine models. We have also focused in recent years on 
modeling the impact of estrogen in thrombosis models, to attempt to clarify the 
complex relation between estrogen and thrombotic risk. In part II of this 
article, we will describe a new strategy of hormone therapy for menopause, 
combining estrogens and selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERM). We review 
the scientific underpinnings of this strategy, which may enable the renewal of 
hormone therapy for menopause.

INTRODUCTION: Although immune tolerance induction (ITI) is considered the first 
choice treatment to eradicate inhibitors in haemophilia A patients, little is 
known about outcomes determinants and cost magnitude.
AIM AND METHODS: A retrospective, multicentre study was conducted to assess the 
relationship between ITI outcome, clinical and treatment characteristics and 
cost of ITI treatment in haemophilia A patients. Data from 12 months before 
inhibitor diagnosis to 12 months after ITI completion were collected. Treatment 
cost was calculated in the third-party perspective and expressed as mean € per 
patient-month. Cox regression models were used to identify predictors of better 
outcome and the time taken to achieve tolerance.
RESULTS: Seventy-one patients, aged 0.4-41 years (median: 3.8 years) at ITI 
start, were enrolled. Undetectable inhibitor was achieved in 84.5% of patients 
and inhibitor eradication with normal factor VIII (FVIII) pharmacokinetics in 
74.2%. Median time to successful tolerance was 10.7 months (range 2.0-90.0 
months). Peak inhibitor level on ITI was a significant predictor of ITI success. 
Breakthrough bleeding event incidence during ITI was associated with time to 
success. The mean cost of treatment for the time period between inhibitor 
diagnosis and ITI start was €3188 per patient-month (92.1% for bypassing 
agents), and €60 078 during ITI (76.8% for FVIII use in ITI).
CONCLUSION: Immune tolerance induction in this patient cohort was successful in 
84.5% of patients with a mean cost of €60 000 per patient-month. This high cost 
is dwarfed by comparison with the prospect of lifelong care of an inhibitor 
patient, in addition to gains in life expectancy and health-related quality of 
life.

Similarly to an increase in life expectancy, the incidence of Parkinson's 
disease increases as well. In parallel with this, more patients with Parkinson's 
disease undergo elective or urgent surgical interventions. According to recent 
statistical data, more than half of the patients with Parkinson's disease are 
not properly managed when they are hospitalized for surgical interventions. It 
is also clear that properly managed Parkinson's disease patients have an 
approximately 50% lower rate for perioperative complications. The authors aimed 
to summarize the most important complications, the updated peri- and 
intraoperative treatment and management strategies of patients with Parkinson's 
disease. They intended to underline that interdisciplinary cooperation and 
knowledge of the proper strategy may result in more successful treatment of 
Parkinson's disease patients during the perioperative period.

Reproductive ageing in women is characterized by a decline in both the quantity 
and quality of oocytes. Menopause is reached upon exhaustion of the resting 
primordial follicle pool, occurring on average at 51 years of age (range 40-60 
years). The mean global age at natural menopause (ANM) appears robust, 
suggesting a distinct genetic control. Accordingly, a strong correlation in ANM 
is observed between mothers and daughters. Few specific genetic determinants of 
ANM have been identified. Substantial efforts have been made to predict ANM by 
using anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) levels. AMH serum concentrations at 
reproductive age predict ANM, but precision is currently limited. Early ANM is 
associated with early preceding fertility loss, whereas late menopause is 
associated with reduced morbidity and mortality later in life. Menopause affects 
various women's health aspects, including bone density, breast, the 
cardiovascular system, mood/cognitive function and sexual well-being. If the 
current trend of increasing human life expectancy persists, women will soon 
spend half their life postmenopause. Unfortunately, increased longevity does not 
coincide with an equal increase in years spend in good health. Future research 
should focus on determinants of long term health effects of ANM, and efforts to 
improve women's postmenopausal health and quality of life.

On the Estimation of Disability-Free Life Expectancy: Sullivan' Method and Its 
Extension.

NJ 08544.

A rapidly aging population, such as the United States today, is characterized by 
the increased prevalence of chronic impairment. Robust estimation of 
disability-free life expectancy (DFLE), or healthy life expectancy, is essential 
for examining whether additional years of life are spent in good health and 
whether life expectancy is increasing faster than the decline of disability 
rates. Over 30 years since its publication, Sullivan's method remains the most 
widely used method to estimate DFLE. Therefore, it is surprising to note that 
Sullivan did not provide any formal justification of his method. Debates in the 
literature have centered around the properties of Sullivan's method and have 
yielded conflicting results regarding the assumptions required for Sullivan's 
method. In this article we establish a statistical foundation of Sullivan's 
method. We prove that, under stationarity assumptions, Sullivan's estimator is 
unbiased and consistent. This resolves the debate in the literature, which has 
generally concluded that additional assumptions are necessary. We also show that 
the standard variance estimator is consistent and approximately unbiased. 
Finally, we demonstrate that Sullivan's method can be extended to estimate DFLE 
without stationarity assumptions. Such an extension is possible whenever a 
cohort life table and either consecutive cross-sectional disability surveys or a 
longitudinal survey are available. Our empirical analysis of the 1907 and 1912 
U.S. birth cohorts suggests that while mortality rates remain approximately 
stationary, disability rates decline during this time period.

Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has substantially changed human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection from an inexorably fatal condition into a 
chronic disease with a longer life expectancy. This means that HIV patients 
should receive antiretroviral drugs lifelong, and the problems concerning with a 
chronic treatment (tolerability, side effects, adherence to treatment) have now 
become dominant. In this context, strategies for the treatment personalization 
have taken a central role in optimizing the therapeutic response and prevention 
of adverse drug reactions. In this setting, the study of pharmacogenetics 
features could be a very useful tool in clinical practice; moreover, nowadays 
the study of genetic profiles allows optimizations in the therapeutic management 
of People Living With HIV (PLWH) through the use of test introduced into 
clinical practice and approved by international guidelines for the adverse 
effects prevention such as the genetic test HLA-B*5701 to detect 
hypersensitivity to Abacavir. For other tests further studies are needed: CYP2B6 
516 G > T testing may be able to identify patients at higher risk of Central 
Nervous System side effects following standard dosing of Efavirenz, UGT1A1*28 
testing before initiation of antiretroviral therapy containing Atazanavir may 
aid in identifying individuals at risk of hyperbilirubinaemia. Pharmacogenetics 
represents a ​​research area with great growth potential which may be useful to 
guide the rational use of antiretrovirals.

[CYSTIC FIBROSIS SURVIVAL TRENDS IN CARMEL MEDICAL CENTER].

[Article in Hebrew]

Nathan K, Shteinberg M, Rivlin J.

INTRODUCTION: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive disorder. The 
disorder is caused by a mutation in the gene that encodes a protein which 
functions as a chloride channel. The chloride channel, cystic fibrosis 
transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) exists in the apical membrane of 
exocrine epithelial cells in the body. In the last 75 years the survival of CF 
patients has risen dramatically from a few months to the average age of 37 
years. The rise in life expectancy is due to several reasons: improved medical 
treatment, treating patients in specialized CF centers, early diagnosis, 
respiratory physiotherapy and liver or lung transplantation. The purpose of this 
study was to review characteristics of our oldest living patients, 
transplantations and mortality of CF patients in our center.
METHODS: Retrospective data have been collected regarding survival and other 
features in CF patients who were admitted to Carmel Medical Center in the years 
2000 to 2013.
RESULTS: One hundred and four CF patients were registered at the CF center 
between the years 2000 and 2013. Over this period 6 patients have passed away, 
all of whom were females. The average age of death was 21.4 years (not including 
one 10 months old baby who died from metabolic syndrome, not CF) with SD of 7 
years, median of 20 and range of 17 years. The average age at the clinic is 22.5 
years. The death incidence was less than 1% per year; the leading cause of death 
was respiratory failure. Of the living patients, ten patients are above the 
average survival age of 37 years. Four percent of the patients have undergone 
lung transplantation.
CONCLUSIONS: CF is a multisystem disorder. In our center the mean age of death 
is in the third decade with an incidence of less than 1% per year, which is 
comparable to CF registries worldwide. Four percent of the patients have 
undergone lung transplantation. A gender gap with more female than male deaths 
was observed, a finding which was previously described in the literature. Life 
expectancy continues to rise as a result of early diagnosis, improved medical 
treatment and lung transplantation. As the age of survival rises, physicians 
with knowledge of adult internal medicine are needed to treat CF patients.

PURPOSE: To assess the effectiveness of a preventive health program and vitamin 
D status in improving the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of older 
residents of Canada.
DESIGN: We analyzed baseline and follow-up data of 2119 volunteers of a 
community program that promotes healthy lifestyles and encourages vitamin D 
supplementation. We examined the program effect on each of the five dimensions 
of the EQ-5D-5L, HRQOL score, and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) using 
multivariable regression methods. We further examined the specific contribution 
of vitamin D status as quantified by serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D).
RESULTS: Problems with mobility, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and 
depression/anxiety were reported less during follow-up compared to baseline. On 
average, participants' HRQOL had improved by 0.018 units at 6 months and 0.025 
units at 1 year of follow-up. Improvements in vitamin D status were 
independently associated with improvements in HRQOL and in QALYs. As per 25 
nmol/L increase in 25(OH)D, there was a 0.002 increase in HRQOL and a 0.001 
increase in QALYs.
CONCLUSIONS: This study documents the benefits of a real-world preventive health 
program to HRQOL. It is the first to reveal that improvements in vitamin D 
status parallel improvements in HRQOL among healthy community dwellers. The 
study further suggests that the preventive health program and supplementation 
with vitamin D are cost-effective interventions.

INTRODUCTION AND HYPOTHESIS: For the surgical correction of apical prolapse the 
abdominal approach is associated with better outcomes; however, it is more 
expensive than the transvaginal approach. This cost-effectiveness analysis 
compares abdominal sacral colpopexy (ASC) with sacrospinous ligament fixation 
(SSLF) to determine if the improved outcomes of ASC justify the increased 
expense.
METHODS: A decision-analytic model was created comparing ASC with SSLF using 
data-modeling software, TreeAge Pro (2013), which included the following 
outcomes: post-operative stress urinary incontinence (SUI) with possible 
mid-urethral sling (MUS) placement, prolapse recurrence with possible 
re-operation, and post-operative dyspareunia. Cost-effectiveness was defined as 
an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of less than $50,000 per 
quality-associated life year (QALY). Base-case, threshold, and one-way 
sensitivity analyses were performed.
RESULTS: At the baseline, ASC is more expensive than SSLF ($13,988 vs $11,950), 
but is more effective (QALY 1.53 vs 1.45) and is cost-effective (ICER 
$24,574/QALY) at 2 years. ASC was not cost-effective if the following four 
thresholds were met: the rate of post-operative SUI was above 36 % after ASC or 
below 28 % after SSLF; the rate of MUS placement for post-operative SUI was 
above 60 % after ASC or below 13 % after SSLF; the rate of recurrent prolapse 
was above 15 % after ASC or below 4 % after SSLF; the rate of post-operative 
dyspareunia was above 59 % after ASC or below 19 % after SSLF.
CONCLUSIONS: Abdominal sacral colpopexy can be cost-effective compared with 
sacrospinous ligament fixation; however, as the post-operative outcomes of SSLF 
improve, SSLF can be considered a cost-effective alternative.

Modifications of radiotherapy indications or schedules because of age could be 
discussed in view of a different evolution of the disease or because of specific 
toxicities. One important aim is to decrease the number of hospital transports. 
For breast cancer, the rate of local relapse after lumpectomy is lower in old 
patients; moreover, characteristics of the disease are often more favourable 
(hormonosensitivity, low grade). However, adjuvant irradiation decreases 
significantly the incidence of breast relapse and must be systematically 
proposed. Hypofractionnated schedules must be recommended; limited data are 
available for accelerated partial breast irradiation in old women and these 
techniques must not be used in routine. For low or intermediate risk prostate 
cancer, assessment of comorbidities is crucial before considering any invasive 
treatment. A life expectancy of at least 10 years is required if a curative 
approach, potentially toxic is proposed. In this case, radiotherapy is often the 
good choice, giving less sequelae than surgery. The indication of androgen 
deprivation must take into account cardiovascular and bone history. Management 
of gynaecological cancers must follow the same recommendations as in young 
women. Exclusive postoperative brachytherapy must be recommended in early stage 
endometrial carcinomas. Brachytherapy must be also systematically integrated in 
the radiotherapy program for cervix cancers, even in old women.

Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) improves life expectancy in prostate cancer 
(PCa) patients, but is associated with adverse effects on muscle mass. Here, we 
investigated the effects of strength training during ADT on muscle fiber 
cross-sectional area (CSA) and regulators of muscle mass. PCa patients on ADT 
were randomized to 16 weeks of strength training (STG) (n = 12) or a control 
group (CG; n = 11). Muscle biopsies were obtained from m. vastus lateralis and 
analyzed by immunohistochemistry and western blot. Muscle fiber CSA increased 
with strength training (898 μm(2) , P = 0.04), with the only significant 
increase observed in type II fibers (1076 μm(2) , P = 0.03). There was a trend 
toward a difference in mean change between groups myonuclei number (0.33
