managed by the national TB programme according to current national treatment 
guidelines. The primary outcome measure of effectiveness will be the proportion 
of patients with treatment success (defined as treatment completion and/or 
bacteriological cure) after 24 months. A marginal Poisson regression model 
estimated via a generalised estimating equation will be used to test the effect 
of the intervention on treatment success. A prospective microcosting of the 
intervention and within-trial cost-effectiveness analysis will also be 
undertaken from a societal perspective. Cost-effectiveness will be presented as 
an incremental cost per patient successfully treated and an incremental cost per 
quality-adjusted life-year gained.
ETHICS: Ethical approval for the study was granted by The University of Sydney 
Human Research Ethics Committee (2019/676).
DISSEMINATION: Study findings will be disseminated to participants and published 
in peer-reviewed journals and conference proceedings.

INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) can modify 
the natural history of severe aortic stenosis (SAS). However, compared with the 
general population, these patients have a loss of life expectancy. The life 
expectancy of patients who undergo SAVR due to low-gradient SAS with preserved 
left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is unknown.
METHODS: We included all patients between 50 and 65 years who underwent isolated 
SAVR in 27 Spanish centers during an 18-year period. We analyzed observed and 
expected survival at 18 years in patients with low-gradient SAS with preserved 
LVEF and all other types of SAS. We used propensity score matching to compare 
the life expectancy of patients with low-gradient SAS with preserved LVEF vs 
those with high-gradient SAS with preserved LVEF.
RESULTS: We analyzed 5084 patients, of whom 413 had low-gradient SAS with 
preserved LVEF. For these patients, observed survival at 10, 15 and 18 years was 
86.6% (95%CI, 85.3-87.8), 75% (95%CI, 72.7-77.2), and 63.5% (95%CI, 58.8-67.8). 
Expected survival at 10, 15 and 18 years was 90.2%, 82.1%, and 75.7%. In the 
matched sample, survival of patients with low-gradient SAS with preserved LVEF 
was similar to that of patients with high-gradient with preserved LVEF, log-rank 
test, P=.95; HR=1 (95%CI, 0.7-1.4; P=.95).
CONCLUSIONS: There is a loss of life expectancy in patients with all types of 
SAS undergoing SAVR. This loss is higher in patients with left ventricular 
dysfunction and lower in patients with low-gradient or high-gradient aortic 
stenosis with preserved LVEF. The benefit of surgery is similar between these 
last 2 groups.

The Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau offers one of the most extreme environments for yaks 
(Bos grunniens). Although the genetic adaptability of yak and rumen metagenomes 
is increasingly understood, the relative contribution of host genetics and 
maternal symbiotic microbes throughout early intestinal microbial successions in 
yaks remains elusive. In this study, we assessed the intestinal microbiota 
succession of co-inhabiting yak and cattle (Bos taurus) calves at different 
weeks after birth as well as the modes of transmission of maternal symbiotic 
microbes (i.e., rumen fluid, feces, oral cavity, and breast skin) to their 
calves' intestinal microbiota colonization. We found that the fecal microbiota 
of yak and cattle calves after birth was dominated by members of the families 
Ruminococcaceae, Bacteroidaceae, and Lachnospiraceae. The Source Tracker model 
revealed that maternal fecal microbes played an important role (the average 
contribution was about 80%) in the intestinal microbial colonization of yak and 
cattle calves at different weeks after birth. Unlike cattle calves, there was no 
significant difference in the fecal microbiota composition of yak calves between 
5 and 9 weeks after birth (Wilcoxon test, P > 0.05), indicating that yak may 
adapt to its natural extreme environment to stabilize its intestinal microbiota 
composition. Additionally, our results also find that the intestinal microbial 
composition of yak and cattle calves, with age, gradually tend to become 
similar, and the differences between species gradually decrease. The findings of 
this study are vital for developing strategies to manipulate the intestinal 
microbiota in grazing yaks and cattle for better growth and performance on the 
Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau.

OBJECTIVES: Quantifying the combined impact of morbidity and mortality is a key 
enabler to assessing the impact of COVID-19 across countries and within 
countries relative to other diseases, regions, or demographics. Differences in 
methods, data sources, and definitions of mortality due to COVID-19 may hamper 
comparisons. We describe efforts to support countries in estimating the 
national-level burden of COVID-19 using disability-adjusted life years.
METHODS: The European Burden of Disease Network developed a consensus 
methodology, as well as a range of capacity-building activities to support 
burden of COVID-19 studies. These activities have supported 11 national studies 
so far, with study periods between January 2020 and December 2021.
RESULTS: National studies dealt with various data gaps and different assumptions 
were made to face knowledge gaps. Still, they delivered broadly comparable 
results that allow for interpretation of consistencies, as well as differences 
in the quantified direct health impact of the pandemic.
DISCUSSION: Harmonized efforts and methodologies have allowed for comparable 
estimates and communication of results. Future studies should evaluate the 
impact of interventions, and unravel the indirect health impact of the COVID-19 
crisis.

Pancreatic cancer (PC) is the 11th most common malignancy worldwide, however, 
entailing a mortality in excess of 90% within 5 years from diagnosis, it is the 
4th most fatal malignant disease. PC is commonly diagnosed at an advanced stage, 
in which curative resection is no longer possible. Even patients who present 
with potentially curable disease will have upward of 30% recurrence of their 
disease within the first year. Thus, palliative therapy has paramount importance 
in patient management. The purpose of palliative care in these patients is to 
relieve symptoms and improve quality of life. This article reviews the current 
state of invasive palliation techniques for advanced PC, which are commonly 
directed towards three main symptoms: gastric/duodenal obstruction, obstructive 
jaundice, and epigastric pain. We describe the pros and cons of the different 
techniques, along with current front-line technology advancements. Endoscopic 
stenting is highly efficient in patients with gastric/duodenal obstruction or 
obstructive jaundice, with a generally low complication rate, short 
hospitalization and sustained quality of life. Bypass surgery should be 
considered in patients with a long-anticipated life expectancy, following higher 
rates of long-term stent failure, or when endoscopic stent procedure is not 
possible or has failed. When treating abdominal pain, celiac plexus neurolysis 
is considered as the first-line treatment. Pancreatic cancer is a complex and 
commonly lethal disease strongly affecting patient quality of life. It is 
important to consider the specific patient's personal characteristics and 
disease status when planning their palliative care.

BACKGROUND: There has been a rapid increase in vulnerable subpopulations of very 
old with co-morbidity, dementia, frailty, and limited life expectancy. Being 
treated by many specialists has led to an epidemic of inappropriate medication 
use and polypharmacy (IMUP) with negative medical and economic consequences. For 
most medications there are no evidence-based studies in older people and 
treatments are based on guidelines proven in much younger/healthier populations.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate whether the benefits of reducing IMUP by 
poly-de-prescribing (PDP) outweighs the negative outcomes in older people with 
polypharmacy.
METHODS: The Garfinkel method and algorithm were used in older people with 
polypharmacy (≥ 6 prescription drugs).
RESULTS: We found that in nursing departments, of 331 drugs de-prescribed only 
32 (10%) had to be re-administered. Annual mortality and severe complications 
requiring referral to acute care facility were significantly reduced in PDP (P < 
0.002). In community dwelling older people, successful de-prescribing was 
achieved in 81% with no increase in adverse events or deaths. Those who 
de-prescribed ≥ 3 prescription drugs showed significantly more improvement in 
functional and cognitive status, sleep quality, appetite, serious complications, 
quality of life, and general satisfaction compared to controls who stopped ≤ 2 
medications (P < 0.002). Rates of hospitalization and mortality were comparable. 
Clinical improvement by polydeprescribing was usually evident within 3 months 
and persisted for several years. The main barrier to polydeprescribing was 
physician's unwillingness to deprescribe (P < 0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: Applying the Garfinkel method of PDP may improve the lives of older 
people and save money.

OBJECTIVES: Hope is a contextual concept that has significant effects on human 
well-being. This study aimed to evaluate the psychometric properties of the 
Persian version of the Herth Hope Index (P-HHI) among Iranian patients with 
cancer.
METHOD: This cross-sectional study was conducted on 320 patients with cancer 
from September to December 2020. After translating the HHI into Persian, 
content, convergent and discriminant, construct validity (exploratory and 
confirmatory factor analysis), and reliability of the P-HHI were assessed.
RESULTS: The results of exploratory factor analysis showed that the P-HHI was 
composed of two factors: Life Expectancy and Thinking Positive, which explained 
55.20% of the total variance.
SIGNIFICANCE OF RESULTS: The research revealed that the P-HHI has acceptable 
validity and reliability, which can be used to measure the hope concept among 
Iranian patients with cancer.

An association between obesity and carpal tunnel syndrome is found in many 
epidemiological studies. Therefore, there is a need to evaluate the 
physiopathological links that could explain the association between these two 
entities. Ectopic adipose tissue is responsible for metabolic syndrome and 
inflammation, and is a major risk factor for diabetes and cardiovascular 
diseases. Taking these elements into consideration, we conducted an extensive 
literature revision of the subject, considering as ectopic fat-related 
mechanisms the following: (a) the direct compression and the association with 
the metabolic syndrome of the fat deposition around the wrist, (b) the insulin 
resistance, dyslipidemia, inflammatory, and oxidative mechanisms related to the 
central deposition of the fat, (c) the impaired muscle contraction and 
metabolism related to myosteatosis. Each section presents the cellular pathways 
which are modified by the ectopic deposition of the adipose tissue and the 
impact in the pathogeny of the carpal tunnel syndrome. In conclusion, the 
experimental and clinical data support the epidemiological findings. Efforts to 
reduce the obesity epidemics will improve not only cardio-metabolic health but 
will reduce the burden of the disability-free life expectancy due to the carpal 
tunnel syndrome.

Assessment of Non-Consumptive Predation Risk of Coccinella septempunctata 
(Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) on the Population Growth of Sitobion miscanthi

How the non-consumptive effects (NCEs) of predators influence the development, 
survival, fecundity, and population growth of prey has not been well documented, 
which is the primary consideration for the compatibility of prey with its 
natural enemies in agricultural ecosystems. We herein employed the age-stage, 
two-sex life table to examine the NCEs of the predator Coccinella septempunctata 
on the life-history traits and population growth of prey Sitobion miscanthi via 
caged predator (prey co-existing with caged predator) and caged prey (predator 
co-existing with caged prey) treatments with daily different exposure times 
(i.e., 0 h (control), 12 h, and 24 h). The results indicated that the predation 
risk of a caged predator could reduce the first nymphal duration and net 
reproductive rate (R0) of S. miscanthi at 12 h, and the first nymphal duration, 
preadult duration, and mean generation time (T) at 24 h. However, the predation 
risk of the caged prey resulted in the prolongation of the pre-adult development 
time and total pre-reproductive period (TPRP) as well as lowered the intrinsic 
rate of increase (r), finite rate of increase (𝜆), R0, life expectancy, and 
reproductive value of S. miscanthi after both 12 h and 24 h. Furthermore, the 
predation risk of both the caged predator and caged prey could increase the 
percent of winged morph at 24 h. These findings indicate that S. miscanthi could 
respond to the predation risk of the caged predator by either accelerating the 
developmental rate or reducing the net reproductive rate, while S. miscanthi 
might reduce their fitness in response to the predation risk of caged prey. 
Furthermore, S. miscanthi might also alter to winged morphs for dispersal under 
both of the above treatments. The findings obtained have practical ramifications 
for managing this economically important pest in wheat production with reduced 
insecticide applications.

Advances and availability of antiretroviral treatment has enabled a longer life 
expectancy for HIV population. However, with its chronicity, premature aging 
challenges the management of people living with HIV. This study, conducted 
between 2018-2020, aimed to identify an association between risk factors and 
premature aging, using the biological age estimated by artificial intelligence 
(AI) based on deep learning (Aging 3.0). This was a cross-sectional, analytical 
study, involving older people living with HIV (OPLHIV), 66.1% of whom were men. 
Premature aging was identified in 67.8%. The presence of cannabis and diabetes 
were significant (p = 0.045 and p = 0.042, respectively). For current and nadir 
CD4 + cell counts, participants were divided into groups comparing biological 
age (BA) and chronological age (CA). Just one group presented no premature 
aging, whereas the group with premature aging was subdivided into BA > CA up to 
4 years and BA > CA in 5 or more years. In conclusion, premature aging was 
present in most of the OPLHIV. The use of cannabis was self-reported in those 
with higher BAs and those with a lower BA presented a higher prevalence of 
diabetes. Factors directly linked to HIV infection, lower current and nadir 
CD4 + counts were associated with premature aging.

Medical and technology development have drastically the improved quality of life 
and, consequently, life expectancy. Nevertheless, the more people who enter the 
third-age, the more geriatric syndromes expand in the elderly. Sarcopenia and 
Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are common diseases among the elderly and the 
literature has extensively studied these two diseases separately. Recent 
evidence, however, revealed that there is a bidirectional relationship between 
sarcopenia and T2DM. The aims of the present review were: (1) to present diet 
and exercise interventions for the management of sarcopenia and T2DM and (2) 
identify which diet and exercise interventions can be used simultaneously in 
order to effectively deal with these two disorders. Exercise and a balanced diet 
are used as effective countermeasures for combating sarcopenia and T2DM in older 
adults based on their bidirectional relationship. Lifestyle changes such as 
exercise and a balanced diet seem to play an important role in the remission of 
the diseases. Results showed that chronic exercise can help towards glycemic 
regulation as well as decrease the incidence rate of muscle degradation, while 
diet interventions which focus on protein or amino acids seem to successfully 
treat both disorders. Despite the fact that there are limited studies that deal 
with both disorders, it seems that a combined exercise regime (aerobic and 
resistance) along with protein intake > 1gr/kg/d is the safest strategy to 
follow in order to manage sarcopenia and T2DM concurrently.

True morels (Morchella spp.) are edible mushrooms that are commercially 
important worldwide due to their rich nutrition and unique appearance. In recent 
years, outdoor cultivation has been achieved and expanded on a large scale in 
China. However, the mechanisms of fruiting body development in morels are poorly 
understood. In this study, the role of mating-type genes in fruiting body 
development was researched. Fruiting bodies cultivated with different 
mating-type strains showed no difference in appearance, but the ascus and 
ascospores were slightly malformed in fruiting bodies obtained from the MAT1-1 
strains. The transcript levels of mating-type genes and their target genes 
revealed that the regulatory mechanisms were conserved in ascomycetes fungi. The 
silencing of mat1-2-1 by RNA interference verified the direct regulatory effect 
of mat1-2-1 on its target genes at the asexual stage. When cultivated with the 
spawn of single mating-type strains of MAT1-1 or MAT1-2, only one corresponding 
mating-type gene was detected in the mycelial and conidial samples, but both 
mat1-1-1 and mat1-2-1 were detected in the samples of primordium, pileus, and 
stipe. An understanding of the mating-type genes' role in fruiting body 
development in M. sextelata may help to understand the life cycle and facilitate 
artificial cultivation.

The application of chemical pesticides to protect agricultural crops from pests 
and diseases is discouraged due to their harmful effects on humans and the 
environment. Therefore, alternative approaches for crop protection through 
microbial or microbe-originated pesticides have been gaining momentum. Wheat 
blast is a destructive fungal disease caused by the Magnaporthe oryzae Triticum 
(MoT) pathotype, which poses a serious threat to global food security. Screening 
of secondary metabolites against MoT revealed that antimycin A isolated from a 
marine Streptomyces sp. had a significant inhibitory effect on mycelial growth 
in vitro. This study aimed to investigate the inhibitory effects of antimycin A 
on some critical life stages of MoT and evaluate the efficacy of wheat blast 
disease control using this natural product. A bioassay indicated that antimycin 
A suppressed mycelial growth (62.90%), conidiogenesis (100%), germination of 
conidia (42%), and the formation of appressoria in the germinated conidia (100%) 
of MoT at a 10 µg/mL concentration. Antimycin A suppressed MoT in a 
dose-dependent manner with a minimum inhibitory concentration of 0.005 μg/disk. 
If germinated, antimycin A induced abnormal germ tubes (4.8%) and suppressed the 
formation of appressoria. Interestingly, the application of antimycin A 
significantly suppressed wheat blast disease in both the seedling (100%) and 
heading stages (76.33%) of wheat at a 10 µg/mL concentration, supporting the 
results from in vitro study. This is the first report on the inhibition of 
mycelial growth, conidiogenesis, conidia germination, and detrimental 
morphological alterations in germinated conidia, and the suppression of wheat 
blast disease caused by a Triticum pathotype of M. Oryzae by antimycin A. 
Further study is required to unravel the precise mode of action of this 
promising natural compound for considering it as a biopesticide to combat wheat 
blast.

Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the most common cancer type in the Netherlands and 
frequently diagnosed in older adults. Unlike other common forms of skin cancer 
(squamous cell carcinoma and melanoma), BCC generally grows slowly and the risk 
of metastasis and/or death is extremely small. In the first years after 
presentation, BCC often causes no or only minor complaints. Nevertheless, the 
vast majority of patients with BCC are treated immediately after diagnosis, 
usually with surgical excision. We think that overtreatment of patients with BCC 
is common and active surveillance may be an excellent alternative for patients 
with a limited life expectancy and should therefore be considered more often.

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, with 
five-year survival rates varying from 3-62%. Screening aims at early detection, 
but half of the patients are diagnosed in advanced stages, limiting therapeutic 
possibilities. Positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) is an 
essential technique in lung cancer detection and staging, with a sensitivity 
reaching 96%. However, since elevated 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) uptake is 
not cancer-specific, PET-CT often fails to discriminate between malignant and 
non-malignant PET-positive hypermetabolic lesions, with a specificity of only 
23%. Furthermore, discrimination between lung cancer types is still impossible 
without invasive procedures. High mortality and morbidity, low survival rates, 
and difficulties in early detection, staging, and typing of lung cancer motivate 
the search for biomarkers to improve the diagnostic process and life expectancy. 
Metabolomics has emerged as a valuable technique for these pitfalls. Over 150 
metabolites have been associated with lung cancer, and several are consistent in 
their findings of alterations in specific metabolite concentrations. However, 
there is still more variability than consistency due to the lack of standardized 
patient cohorts and measurement protocols. This review summarizes the identified 
metabolic biomarkers for early diagnosis, staging, and typing and reinforces the 
need for biomarkers to predict disease progression and survival and to support 
treatment follow-up.

Among the forms of idiopathic hyperhidrosis, those involving the forehead have 
the greatest impact on patients' quality of life, as symptoms are not very 
controllable and are difficult to mask for patients. Although the local 
injection therapy with Incobotulinum toxin type A (IncoBTX-A therapy) can be 
considered a rational treatment, data from the literature describing both 
efficacy and safety of the treatment over the long term are poor. The aim of 
this report is to describe the single-center experience of five patients seeking 
treatment, for forehead hyperhidrosis with IncoBTX-A. To evaluate the benefits, 
safety profile and duration of anhidrosis, patients were treated following a 
standardized procedure and then followed until clinical relapse. The amount of 
sweating was measured by gravimetric testing, the extension of hyperhidrosis 
area was measured through Minor's iodine starch test, and response to the 
treatment was evaluated using the Hyperhidrosis Disease Severity Scale (HDSS) 
and the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI). In all treated patients, a 
significant anhidrotic effect was observed 4 weeks after the treatment and 
lasted for approximately 36 weeks. The reduction in sweat production was 
associated with significant amelioration of symptoms and quality of life for all 
treated patients. No serious side effects occurred; one patient complained of a 
mild transient bilateral ptosis. Although further wider studies are required, 
our preliminary results seem to encourage the use of IncoBTX-A in forehead 
hyperhidrosis.

Men are more likely than women to die due to coronavirus disease 2019 
(COVID-19). An open question is whether these sex differences reflect men's 
generally poorer health and lower life expectancy compared to women of similar 
ages or if men face a unique COVID-19 disadvantage. Using age-specific data on 
COVID-19 mortality as well as cause-specific and all-cause mortality for 63 
countries, we compared the sex difference in COVID-19 mortality to 
sex differences in all-cause mortality and mortality from other common causes of 
death to determine the magnitude of the excess male mortality disadvantage for 
COVID-19. We found that sex differences in the age-standardized COVID-19 
mortality rate were substantially larger than for the age-standardized all-cause 
mortality rate and mortality rate for most other common causes of death. 
The excess male mortality disadvantage for COVID-19 was especially large in the 
oldest age groups. Our findings suggest that the causal pathways that link male 
sex to a higher mortality from a SARS-CoV-2 infection may be specific to 
SARS-CoV-2, rather than shared with the pathways responsible for the shorter 
life expectancy among men or sex differences for other common causes of death. 
Understanding these causal chains could assist in the development of 
therapeutics and preventive measures for COVID-19 and, possibly, other 
coronavirus diseases.

The Healthy 4U-2 randomised controlled trial demonstrated that a physical 
activity (PA) telephone coaching intervention was effective for improving 
objectively-measured PA and health-related outcomes. The current study reports 
on an economic evaluation performed alongside the trial to determine whether 
this effective intervention is also cost-effective from a healthcare funder 
perspective. Participants (N = 120) were insufficiently physically active adults 
recruited from an ambulatory care clinic in a public hospital in regional 
Australia. The primary outcome was change in moderate-to-vigorous physical 
activity (MVPA) measured using accelerometers. Changes in quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs) were derived from the 12-Item Short Form Health Survey 
Questionnaire (SF-12). Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were 
calculated for each outcome. Uncertainty of cost-effectiveness results were 
estimated using non-parametric bootstrapping techniques and sensitivity 
analyses. The mean intervention cost was $132 per person. The control group 
incurred higher overall costs compared to intervention ($2,465 vs. $1,743, 
respectively). Relative to control, the intervention resulted in incremental 
improvements in MVPA and QALYs and was deemed cost-effective. Probabilistic 
sensitivity analysis indicated that compared to control, the intervention would 
be cost-effective for improving MVPA and QALYs at very low willingness to pay 
thresholds. Sensitivity analyses indicated that results were robust to varied 
assumptions. This study shows that PA telephone coaching was a low-cost strategy 
for increasing MVPA and QALYs in insufficiently active ambulatory hospital 
patients. Findings of health benefits and overall cost-savings are uncommon and 
PA telephone coaching offers a potentially cost-effective investment to produce 
important public health outcomes.

INTRODUCTION: The population of the aged is increasing globally and in Ghana. In 
2020, the population aged over 60 years in Ghana was 2,051,903 and this is 
expected to reach 2.5 million by 2025 and 6.3 million by 2050. Despite the 
envisaged increase in the number and life expectancy of the older population in 
Ghana that will require nursing care, there is a paucity of data on nursing 
staff knowledge and attitudes toward elderly patients in Ghana.
OBJECTIVES: This study, therefore, assessed factors affecting the care of 
elderly patients among nursing staff in a tertiary referral health facility in 
the Volta region of Ghana.
METHODS: The study employed a descriptive cross-sectional design using 
quantitative data collection approaches. A total of 150 nurses were sampled with 
a response rate of 95%. Data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for 
Social Sciences (SPSS) version 23. The analysis included logistic regression to 
predict factors associated with nurses' knowledge and attitude in caring for 
elderly patients, after multicollinearity diagnosis and controlling the effect 
of confounding variables.
RESULTS: Majority (83.8%) of the nurses demonstrated good knowledge of the aging 
process, knowledge in the care of the elderly (88.7%), and (84.5%) had a 
positive caring attitude towards the elderly. Professional education, 
professional qualification, and knowledge on aged care were significantly 
associated with nurses' attitude towards the elderly (p<0.001), (p<0.005), and 
(p<0.010), respectively. Lack of special wards/facilities emerged as the 
predominantly perceived barrier to caring for the elderly as per the nurses' 
responses.
CONCLUSION: The majority of nurses demonstrated good knowledge and attitude in 
the aging process and care of the aged. Lack of special wards/facilities and 
lack of staff motivation were the leading perceived barriers to rendering care 
to the elderly. Scaling up gerontological nursing programs and establishing 
special aged care facilities in Ghana with appropriate policy guidelines and 
regulations for implementation of care will help improve nurses' knowledge and 
caring attitudes toward the care of elderly patients. Likewise, a national 
geriatric care policy would help consolidate standard geriatric care in Ghana.

Is senescence inevitable and universal for all living organisms, as evolutionary 
theories predict? Although evidence generally supports this hypothesis, it has 
been proposed that certain species, such as turtles and tortoises, may exhibit 
slow or even negligible senescence-i.e., avoiding the increasing risk of death 
from gradual deterioration with age. In an extensive comparative study of 
turtles and tortoises living in zoos and aquariums, we show that ~75% of 52 
species exhibit slow or negligible senescence. For ~80% of species, aging rates 
are lower than those in modern humans. We find that body weight positively 
relates to adult life expectancy in both sexes, and sexual size dimorphism 
explains sex differences in longevity. Unlike humans and other species, we show 
that turtles and tortoises may reduce senescence in response to improvements in
