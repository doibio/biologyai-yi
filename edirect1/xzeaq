OBJECTIVES: This study aims to evaluate whether Somalia will reach Sustainable 
Development Goals 2 and 3 by 2030 and what the country requires to advance 
closer to these objectives.
SETTING: Somalia.
PARTICIPANTS: We carried out analyses of secondary data obtained from the 
following open-access databases: Global Burden of Disease 2019 study; United 
Nations (UN) Department of Economic and Social Affairs Population Division; 
World Bank World Development Indicators; United Nations Children's Fund 
(UNICEF); UNICEF/World Health Organisation (WHO)/World Bank Joint Child 
Malnutrition Estimates; and UN Interagency Group for Child Mortality Estimation 
(UN IGME), disaggregated by sex.
PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: stillbirth, neonatal, infant, under-five, maternal and 
child mortality; under-five malnutrition; life expectancy; health-adjusted life 
expectancy; age-standardised all-cause mortality; age-standardised 
cause-specific mortality for the leading causes of death; disability-adjusted 
life years.
SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: vitamin A coverage; stunting, overweight in children 
under 5; top risk factors contributing to cause-specific mortality.
RESULTS: life expectancy in Somalia will increase to 65.42 years (95% UI 
62.30-68.54) for females and 58.54 years (95% UI 54.89-62.19) for males in 2030. 
Stunting will continue to decline to 25.2% (90% UI 13.9-39.5%), and the 
under-five mortality rate will drop to 85.9 per 1000 live births (90% UI 
22.0-228.1 per 1000 live births) for females and 96.4 per 1000 live births (90% 
UI 24.8-255.3 per 1000 live births) for males in 2030. This study's analyses 
predict that the maternal mortality ratio in Somalia will decline to 696.42 
deaths per 100,000 live births in 2030.
CONCLUSIONS: there has been progress towards SDG targets in Somalia since 1990. 
To achieve these, Somalia requires greater health improvements than observed 
between 1990 and 2019.

Cystic fibrosis-associated liver disease is the third leading cause of morbidity 
and mortality in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). Liver damage in the course 
of CF ranges from biochemical abnormalities to full-blown cirrhosis and may 
involve complicated processes like inflammation, fibrogenesis, remodeling, 
apoptosis, and cholestasis. Despite robust research in the field of CF, its 
complex pathogenesis is not fully understood. Because of the unknown 
pathogenesis, it is difficult to develop a highly sensitive and specific test or 
technology that is standardized, acceptable, and available at most pediatric 
institutions. The Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (CFF) recommends annual blood tests 
to screen for liver pathology, which often fails to identify early-onset liver 
disease. In this review article, we present the use of different liver indices 
and imaging modalities that can help identify liver disease at the onset and may 
help in its prevention. Although the disease is commonly diagnosed in the 
pediatric population, due to increased life expectancy, there is increasing 
evidence of liver disease in adults too. We believe that the tools we present in 
this review will help in the prevention of liver disease and thereby reduce the 
associated morbidity and mortality.

[Purpose] We investigated the relationship of quality of life (QOL) with 
cognitive function, physical function, and activity ability, and aimed to 
identify functions related to QOL improvement, among elderly people who use 
day-care rehabilitation. [Participants and Methods] The participants were 37 
elderly rehabilitation users, whose QOL was assessed using the Health 
Organization QOL26 (WHOQOL26), which consists of a 26-item self-report 
questionnaire. Cognitive function was assessed using the Mini-Mental State 
Examination, while physical function was assessed with seated forward bending, 
knee extension, grip, 30-second chair stand test, timed up and go test, and gait 
speed. Activity ability was assessed using the Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of 
Gerontology Index of Competence (TMIG index). [Results] A positive correlation 
was found between five WHOQOL26 categories (psychological QOL, social QOL, 
environmental QOL, total QOL, and QOL average) and social role in the TMIG 
index. There was also a positive correlation between four WHOQOL26 categories 
(psychological QOL, social QOL, environmental QOL, and QOL average) and 
instrumental activity of daily living in the TMIG index. To identify factors 
influencing the QOL score, association with TMIG index was investigated. Social 
role in the TMIG index was a positive factor in psychological and social QOL. 
[Conclusion] Enhancing social role is important to improve QOL of elderly 
rehabilitation users.

[Purpose] This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of frailty among 
community-dwelling elderly females, and to examine its relation to motor 
function and the main risk factors of frailty. [Participants and Methods] The 
participants were 67 community-dwelling elderly females, aged 76.2 ± 7.7 years. 
We performed measurements of physical parameters, motor functions (such as grip 
strength), timed up and go test (TUG), walking speed, and frailty (measured 
using the Kihon Checklist [KCL]). [Results] KCL scores were 31.3%, 31.3%, and 
37.3% in the frailty, pre-frailty, and robust groups, respectively. The frailty 
group was older than the pre-frailty and robust groups. Additionally, the 
different groups showed significant differences in grip strength, TUG, and 
walking speed. The highest median KCL score was for depression, followed by 
physical function. As a results, frailty was evident even among health-conscious 
elderly people. [Conclusion] It is essential to identify frailty at an early 
stage and identify its preventive factors, in order to extend the healthy life 
expectancy of the local population.

[Purpose] The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of the lumbar 
stability exercise on the range of motion (ROM) and height difference of the 
shoulder and to provide basic data to prevent musculoskeletal disorders for 
improvement of the quality of life of older adults. [Participants and Methods] 
Twenty older adults without musculoskeletal problems were divided into the 
lumbar stability exercise group and the passive upper arm exercise group and 
performed exercise for 30 minutes, 3 times a week for 5 weeks. The shoulder 
flexion, abduction, extension, and height difference between shoulders were 
measured. A paired t-test was applied for comparative analysis of data before 
and after exercise in both groups. [Results] In the lumbar stability exercise 
group, the shoulder flexion, abduction and height difference were significantly 
different. In the passive upper arm exercise group, the abduction was 
significantly different. [Conclusion] Since it was proved that the height 
difference and range of motion of shoulder are improved when the lumbar 
stability exercise is indirectly carried out without directly doing shoulder 
exercise, it is suggested that the lumbar stability exercise is strongly 
recommended for clinical uses to improve functions in older adults.

BACKGROUND: Regional deprivation indices enable researchers to analyse 
associations between socioeconomic disadvantages and health outcomes even if the 
health data of interest does not include information on the individuals' 
socioeconomic position. This article introduces the recent revision of the 
German Index of Socioeconomic Deprivation (GISD) and presents associations with 
life expectancy as well as age-standardised cardiovascular mortality rates and 
cancer incidences as applications.
METHODS: The GISD measures the level of socioeconomic deprivation using 
administrative data of education, employment, and income situations at the 
district and municipality level from the INKAR database. The indicators are 
weighted via principal component analyses. The regional distribution is depicted 
cartographically, regional level associations with health outcomes are 
presented.
RESULTS: The principal component analysis indicates medium to high correlations 
of the indicators with the index subdimensions. Correlation analyses show that 
in districts with the lowest deprivation, the average life expectancy of men is 
approximately six years longer (up to three years longer for women) than for 
those from districts with the highest deprivation. A similar social gradient is 
observed for cardiovascular mortality and lung cancer incidence.
CONCLUSIONS: The GISD provides a valuable tool to analyse socioeconomic 
inequalities in health conditions, diseases, and their determinants at the 
regional level.

Haemophilia B (HB) is a rare disease which may lead to chronic disabling 
arthropathy, resulting in a significant clinical, social and economic impact. In 
recent years, new extended half-life (EHL) factor IX concentrates produced by 
recombinant technology (rFIX) have been developed. They have shown significantly 
prolonged half-life as compared to other rFIX products and improved bleeding 
control when used as prophylaxis. To date, EHL rFIX products reimbursed in Italy 
are a recombinant coagulation factor IX produced with Fc technology (rFIXFc) and 
a recombinant fusion protein containing rFIX fused with recombinant albumin 
(rIX-FP). The results of extension studies with injection intervals with a 
median of almost every 14 days for the complete individualized interval 
prophylaxis (IP) group on rFIXFc and 21 days for a selected subgroup of patients 
on rIX-FP have recently been published. The aim of this analysis was to estimate 
the cost of prophylactic treatment with rFIXFc and rIX-FP in adult patients, in 
the light of new clinical evidence and current average prices in Italy. The cost 
of therapy was estimated on the basis of the results of extension studies, the 
average prices reported in regional drug tenders and assuming an average patient 
weight of 70 kg. The analysis estimated a cost per patient/year between €224,407 
and €230,355 for rFIXFc and between €242,259 and €368,587 for rIX-FP. The 
sensitivity analysis confirmed the robustness of the results. The use of rFIXFc 
over rIX-FP proves to be the least expensive choice for the treatment of HB in 
Italy.

OBJECTIVE: As lifetime horizons are considered for economic evaluations, the 
Kaplan-Meier (KM) estimate is used to extrapolate survival in cases of immature 
overall survival (OS) data. This study estimated the error induced by the choice 
of distribution when extrapolating different levels of OS maturity.
METHODS: Fifteen phase 3 trials reporting KM estimates of OS where at least 70% 
maturity (i.e. 70% of the population had died during follow-up) were included 
and compared to artificially created truncated data (30 and 50% maturity). 
Individual patient-data were reproduced using the Guyot algorithm based on 
digitized KM curves. Parametric survival distributions were fit for each arm in 
each study, for each maturity level, using the same time horizon (equal to the 
maximum follow-up). For each KM curve, the best distribution was chosen based on 
visual inspection, Akaike/Bayesian information criteria, and external validity. 
Outcomes were measured as life expectancy in months (LM) and life months gained 
(LMG).
RESULTS: The Weibull (33%), log-logistic (32%) and log-normal (27%) were most 
often selected as the best fitting distribution. Compared to LM at full 
maturity, LM was overestimated in 23 and 40% of cases, at 30 and 50% maturity, 
respectively. Mean absolute error was 2.12months at 30% maturity, and decreased 
to 0.88months at 50% maturity. When comparing to mature data, the mean 
percentage of error in LMG was 126.4 and 62.4% at 30 and 50% maturity, 
respectively.
CONCLUSION: The extent of OS maturity increases the risk of error when 
projecting long-term life expectancy for economic models. Even marginal gains in 
OS maturity result in more accurate estimations and should be considered when 
developing models.

The application of food-grade microbial cultures to fresh meat products is a 
promising natural approach for meat shelf-life extension. However, before its 
adoption into commercial practice, it is essential to understand consumers' 
attitudes to this approach and the resulting marketed products. This study 
investigated Australian consumers' willingness to purchase and consume packaged 
fresh meat products with added microbial cultures for shelf-life extension. A 
national online survey of over 800 respondents was conducted. Results indicated 
that most Australian consumers would be willing to buy and eat such products, 
with 17.8% of respondents less likely to buy and 11.1% unwilling to eat these 
products. Respondents' purchasing and consumption decisions were influenced by 
demographic factors, their food and meat shopping and consumption behaviors, and 
the value, taste, and type of the meat product. Consumer acceptance may be 
improved by increasing their awareness of the potential use of microbial 
cultures as natural antimicrobials for food shelf-life extension.

As the population ages, the global cardiovascular disease burden will continue 
to increase, particularly among older adults. Increases in life expectancy and 
better cardiovascular care have significantly reshaped the epidemiology of 
cardiovascular disease and have created new patient profiles. The combination of 
older age, multiple comorbidities, polypharmacy, frailty, and adverse 
noncardiovascular outcomes is challenging our routine clinical practice in this 
field. In this review, we examine noncardiovascular factors that statistically 
interact in a relevant way with health status and quality of life in older 
people with cardiovascular disease. We focused on specific geriatric conditions 
(multimorbidity, polypharmacy, geriatric syndromes, and frailty) that are 
responsible for a major risk of functional decline and have an important impact 
on the overall prognosis in this patient population.

BACKGROUND: Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) of stage T1a has been proven to be of 
low-grade malignancy and mostly affects elderly individuals with relatively 
limited life expectancy. However, research on the survival benefit of surgery 
relative to non-surgical treatment (NST) is limited. The aim of the study was to 
investigate the survival difference between partial nephrectomy (PN) and NST and 
to establish a benefit stratification model for elderly patients (≥70 years) 
diagnosed with T1a RCC.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients diagnosed with non-metastatic T1a RCC who 
received PN or NST were identified from the SEER database during 2004-2015. 
Before survival analysis, propensity score matching (PSM) was performed. Overall 
survival (OS) was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method, and subgroup analyses 
were used to identify favorable factors of PN. Independent factors of survival 
were recognized by multivariate Cox regression analysis.
RESULTS: Patients diagnosed with non-metastatic T1a RCC who received PN or NST 
were identified from the SEER database during 2004-2015. Before survival 
analysis, propensity score matching (PSM) was performed. Overall survival (OS) 
was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method, and subgroup analyses were used to 
identify favorable factors of PN. Independent factors of survival were 
recognized by multivariate Cox regression analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the survival benefit of PN could be 
stratified based on the clinical characteristics in patients with stage T1a RCC 
aged 70 years or older, which may help physicians and patients optimize clinical 
decisions.

OBJECTIVE: To analyze the socioeconomic, demographic and health management 
factors associated with bariatric surgery rates performed by the Brazilian 
Unified Health System (SUS) in the federative units in Brazil.
METHODS: Description and analysis of bariatric surgeries rates (per 100,000 
inhabitants) performed by SUS in adults from 18 to 65 years old, in the 27 
federative units of Brazil, between 2008 and 2018; thus, the econometric 
methodology of count panel with negative binomial distribution 
(population-averaged, fixed effects and random effects) was used. Socioeconomic 
and demographic factors were also investigated, considering the real gross 
domestic product per capita, the average years of study of adults and life 
expectancy at birth, and those of health management, given the primary health 
care coverage, the rate of digestive system surgeons and the rate of hospitals 
accredited in high complexity care to patients with obesity in the SUS.
RESULTS: In regional terms, the performance of public bariatric surgeries in 
Brazil over the period analyzed suffered a great disparity; the procedures 
happen mostly in the South and Southeast regions, and scarcely in the North 
region. Moreover, we found a positive relationship between the rate of bariatric 
surgeries and life expectancy, the rate of digestive system surgeons and the 
rate of hospitals accredited in high complexity care; however, the average 
number of years of adult study and coverage of primary health care is a negative 
association regarding real gross domestic product per capita.
CONCLUSION: In the period analyzed, the investigated factors explained the rate 
of bariatric surgeries. Therefore, to train specialized health professionals, 
the accreditation of hospitals according to the legal framework, preventive 
actions of primary care, and socioeconomic and demographic factors, conditioning 
for the offer of surgical treatment by the SUS were crucial. Thus, these are all 
relevant factors for the formulation of public policies in this area.

OBJETIVO: Analisar os fatores socioeconômicos, demográficos e de gestão em saúde 
associados às taxas de cirurgias bariátricas realizadas pelo Sistema Único de 
Saúde (SUS) nas unidades federativas (UF) do Brasil.
MÉTODOS: Descrição e análise da taxa de cirurgias bariátricas (por 100 mil 
habitantes) realizadas pelo SUS em adultos de 18 a 65 anos, nas 27 unidades 
federativas do Brasil, entre 2008 e 2018; para isso, utilizou-se a metodologia 
econométrica de painel de contagem com distribuição binomial negativa 
(population-averaged, efeitos fixos e efeitos aleatórios). Investigou-se, 
também, os fatores socioeconômicos e demográficos, considerando o produto 
interno bruto (PIB) real per capita, a média de anos de estudo de adultos e a 
expectativa de vida ao nascer, e os da gestão em saúde, tendo em vista a 
cobertura da atenção básica, a taxa de cirurgiões de aparelho digestivo e a taxa 
de hospitais credenciados na assistência de alta complexidade (AAC) ao indivíduo 
obeso no SUS.
RESULTADOS: Em termos regionais, verificou-se grande disparidade na realização 
de cirurgias bariátricas públicas no Brasil ao longo do período analisado: os 
procedimentos estão concentrados nas regiões Sul e Sudeste, sendo escassos na 
região Norte. Além disso, encontrou-se uma relação positiva entre a taxa de 
cirurgias bariátricas e a expectativa de vida, a taxa de cirurgiões de aparelho 
digestivo e a taxa de hospitais credenciados na assistência de alta 
complexidade; havendo, porém, uma associação negativa em relação ao PIB real per 
capita, a média de anos de estudo de adultos e a cobertura da atenção básica.
CONCLUSÕES: No período analisado, o índice de cirurgias bariátricas foi 
explicado pelos fatores investigados. Portanto, mostrou-se de fundamental 
importância a formação de profissionais de saúde especializados, o 
credenciamento de hospitais conforme o marco legal, as ações preventivas da 
atenção básica, e os fatores socioeconômicos e demográficos, condicionantes da 
oferta do tratamento cirúrgico pelo Sistema Único de Saúde. Sendo assim, todos 
fatores relevantes para a formulação de políticas públicas nessa área.

While studies have demonstrated that air pollution can be catastrophic to the 
population's health, few empirical studies are found in the economic literature 
because a considerable proportion of the evidence comes from epidemiological 
studies. Because of the crucial role of governance in the health community, good 
governance has been a contentious issue in public sector management in recent 
years. Therefore, the aim of this study is to examine the effects of air 
pollution and the role of governance on health outcomes. This study employed the 
generalized method of moment (GMM) estimation techniques to analyse panel data 
for 72 developing countries from 2010 to 2017. The empirical results confirm 
that higher PM2.5 and CO2 levels have a detrimental influence on life expectancy 
and healthy life expectancy, whereas the role of governance has a positive 
impact on life expectancy and healthy life expectancy. Furthermore, the findings 
show governance quality plays a role in moderating the negative effect of PM2.5 
on health outcomes. The ongoing rise in air pollution has had a significant 
impact on the health of developing countries. It appears that governance quality 
has improved health outcomes. The findings have important policy implications, 
such that strengthening governance can reduce air pollution emissions in 
developing countries. However, to reduce the health effects of air pollution, 
developing countries must implement effective environmental development policies 
and track the implementation and enforcement of such policies.

OBJECTIVES: The objective of the current preliminary study was to present the 
cost-effectiveness analyses submitted to the National Institute for Health and 
Care Excellence (NICE) (TA10765) that deemed semaglutide 2.4 mg subcutaneous 
(s.c.) injection a cost-effective option for weight management in the United 
Kingdom (UK) alongside diet and exercise (D&E).
METHODS: The study was conducted from the National Health Service (NHS) and 
Personal Social Services perspective and based on the NICE reference case. The 
clinical safety and efficacy of semaglutide 2.4 mg s.c. injection were obtained 
from the Semaglutide Treatment Effect in People with Obesity (STEP) 1 trial. The 
previously published and validated Core Obesity Model was used to project 
lifetime occurrence of obesity complications, their costs and quality of life 
consequences over 40 years. The base case cohort had a mean starting age of 
48 years and BMI of 38.7 kg/m2. The confidential NHS price for semaglutide 2.4 
mg s.c. injection was provided by Novo Nordisk. The incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were expressed as cost/quality-adjusted 
life-year (QALY). Uncertainty was assessed through sensitivity analyses, 
including a scenario analysis using clinical data from the STEP 2 trial and a 
previously published and validated Core Diabetes Model to investigate a cohort 
with type 2 diabetes at baseline.
RESULTS: Semaglutide 2.4 mg s.c. injection showed higher total costs and health 
benefits compared with D&E, with an ICER of £14,827/QALY gained. The 
probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that semaglutide 2.4 mg s.c. injection 
was cost-effective in 90% of cases at a willingness-to-pay threshold of 
£20,000/QALY. The ICER from the scenario analysis for the diabetic population 
was £16,613/QALY gained, using the Core Diabetes Model.
CONCLUSION: Semaglutide 2.4 mg s.c. injection is a cost-effective therapy 
compared to D&E alone for patients with obesity and weight-related comorbidities 
in the UK. Sensitivity and scenario analyses confirm the robustness of the 
analyses.

Advance care planning (ACP) to promote receipt of value-concordant care: Results 
vary according to patient priorities.

BACKGROUND: Benefits of advance care planning (ACP) have recently been 
questioned by experts, but ACP is comprised of discrete activities. Little is 
known about which, if any, ACP activities are associated with patients' greater 
likelihood of receiving value-concordant end-of-life (EoL) care.
OBJECTIVES: To determine which ACP activities [Do-Not-Resuscitate (DNR) order 
completion, designation of a healthcare proxy (HCP), and/or EoL discussions with 
physicians], individually and in combination, are associated with the greatest 
likelihood of receiving value-concordant care, and how results may vary based on 
patient-reported EoL care priorities.
METHODS: Data from 2 federally-funded, multisite, prospective cohort studies of 
EoL cancer care from 2002-2019 were analyzed. Cancer patients (N = 278) with 
metastatic disease refractory to chemotherapy were interviewed for a baseline 
assessment and followed prospectively until death. Interviews regarding patient 
priorities occurred a median of 111 days prior to death; data regarding EoL 
medical care were collected post-mortem from caregiver interviews and medical 
record abstraction. Patients who 1) prioritized life-extending care, and then 
received life-extending care (or avoided hospice care), or 2) prioritized 
comfort-focused care, and then avoided life-extending care (or received hospice 
care) in the last week of life, were coded as receiving value-concordant care.
RESULTS: After inverse propensity score weighting, the ACP combination 
associated with the largest proportion of patients receiving value-concordant 
care was DNR, HCP, and EoL discussions (87% vs. 64% for no ACP activities; OR = 
3.91, p = 0.006). In weighted analyses examining each ACP activity individually, 
DNR orders were associated with decreased likelihood of life-extending care (89% 
vs. 75%; p = 0.005) and EoL discussions were associated with increased 
likelihood of hospice care (77% vs. 55%; p = 0.002) among patients prioritizing 
comfort. ACP activities were not significantly associated with increased 
likelihood of receiving value-concordant care among patients prioritizing 
life-extension.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: For patients who prioritize comfort, EoL discussions 
with physicians and completion of DNR orders may improve odds of receiving 
value-concordant EoL care. For patients who prioritize life-extension, ACP does 
not appear to improve odds of receiving value-concordant EoL care.

Fish parasitological research associated with fisheries and aquaculture has 
expanded remarkably over the past century. The application of parasites as 
biological tags has been one of the fields in which fish parasitology has 
generated new insight into fish migration and stock assessments worldwide. It is 
a well-established discipline whose methodological issues are regularly reviewed 
and updated. Therefore, no concepts or case-studies will be repeated here; 
instead, we summarize some of the main recent findings and achievements of this 
methodology. These include the extension of its use in hosts other than bony 
fishes; the improvements in the selection of parasite tags; the recognition of 
the host traits affecting the use of parasite tags; and the increasingly 
recognized need for integrative, multidisciplinary studies combining parasites 
with classical methods and modern techniques, such as otolith microchemistry and 
genetics. Archaeological evidence points to the existence of parasitic problems 
associated with aquaculture activities more than a thousand years ago. However, 
the main surge of research within aquaculture parasitology occurred with the 
impressive development of aquaculture over the past century. Protozoan and 
metazoan parasites, causing disease in domesticated fish in confined 
environments, have attracted the interest of parasitologists and, due to their 
economic importance, funding was made available for basic and applied research. 
This has resulted in a profusion of basic knowledge about parasite biology, 
physiology, parasite-host interactions, life cycles and biochemistry. Due to the 
need for effective control methods, various solutions targeting host-parasite 
interactions (immune responses and host finding), genetics and pharmacological 
aspects have been in focus.

The past two to three decades have seen a steady increase in the prevalence of 
hypertension in China, largely owing to increased life expectancy and lifestyle 
changes (particularly among individuals aged 35-44 years). Data from the China 
hypertension survey conducted in 2012-2015 revealed a high prevalence of grade 3 
hypertension (systolic blood pressure ≥180 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure 
≥110 mmHg) in the general population, which increased with age to up to 5% among 
individuals aged ≥65 years. The risk profile of patients with hypertension in 
China has also been a subject of intense study in the past 30 years. Dietary 
sodium and potassium intake have remained largely the same in China in the past 
three decades, and salt substitution strategies seem to be effective in reducing 
blood pressure levels and the risk of cardiovascular events and death. However, 
the number of individuals with risk factors for hypertension and cardiovascular 
disease in general, such as physical inactivity and obesity, has increased 
dramatically in the same period. Moreover, even in patients diagnosed with 
hypertension, their disease is often poorly managed owing to a lack of patient 
education and poor treatment compliance. In this Review, we summarize the latest 
epidemiological data on hypertension in China, discuss the risk factors for 
hypertension that are specific to this population, and describe several ongoing 
nationwide hypertension control initiatives that target these risk factors, 
especially in the low-resource rural setting.

Ageing is the process generated by senescent cells, free radicals, inflammation 
and other relevant factors. Ageing contributes to age-related diseases that 
affect the quality of life. People are interested in anti-ageing intervention 
and many scientists attempt to search for anti-ageing medicines. This review 
focused on describing in vivo anti-ageing activity of US-FDA-approved drugs and 
found that alogliptin, canagliflozin and metformin might produce anti-ageing 
activity via AMPK activation. Rapamycin and canagliflozin are capable to inhibit 
mTOR to promote lifespan. Atracurium, carnitine and statins act as DAF-16 
activators, which potentially contribute to anti-ageing activity. Hydralazine, 
lisinopril, rosiglitazone and zidovudine may help stabilize genomic integrity to 
prolong life expectancy. Other indirect mechanisms, including insulin-lowering 
effect by acarbose and calcium channel blocking activity by verapamil may also 
promote longevity. Interestingly, some drugs (i.e., canagliflozin, metformin, 
rapamycin and acarbose) are likely to demonstrate a lifespan-promoting effect 
predominantly in male animals. These pre-clinical data might provide mechanistic 
and phenotypic perspectives to better understand the targets of anti-ageing 
interventions.

Asthenoteratozoospermia is one of the major factors for male infertility, 
whereas the causes of large numbers of cases are still unknown. We identified 
compound heterozygous variants of FSIP2 in three unrelated individuals from a 
cohort of 105 patients with asthenoteratozoospermia by exome sequencing. 
Deleterious FSIP2 variations caused severe disassembly of the fibrous sheath and 
axonemal defects. Intriguingly, spermatozoa in our study manifested 
"super-length" mitochondrial sheaths, increased levels of the mitochondrial 
sheath outer membrane protein TOMM20 and decreased mitochondrial ATP 
consumption. Dislocation or deletion of the annulus and reduction or dislocation 
of the annulus protein SEPT4 were also observed. While the lengthened 
mitochondrial sheaths were not presented in men harboring SEPT4 variants. 
Furthermore, female partners of two of three men achieved successful pregnancies 
following intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). Overall, we presume that 
FSIP2 may not only serve as a structural protein of the fibrous sheath but also 
as an intra-flagellar transporter involving in the axonemal assembly, 
mitochondrial selection and the termination of mitochondrial sheath extension 
during spermatogenesis, and ICSI is an effective treatment for individuals with 
FSIP2-associated asthenoteratozoospermia.

BACKGROUND/AIM: In advanced stage lung cancer, bulky tumors can cause serious 
symptoms such as malignant airway obstruction (MAO). Prompt response to airway 
obstruction might be essential to improve quality of life and prolong life 
expectancy. Palliative external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) is a less invasive and 
highly safe treatment method that can alleviate symptoms and at the same time 
treat lung cancer. However, there are few reports on the results of palliative 
radiotherapy performed for improving airway obstruction and obstructive 
pneumonia. Therefore, this study retrospectively examined the effectiveness of 
palliative radiotherapy.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We reviewed 38 lung cancer patients with MAO who underwent 
EBRT. Patients were treated with a median dose of 37.5 Gy (range=30-40 Gy) in 
10-20 fractions. Whether a patient was a responder or non-responder was assessed 
by whether the bronchus that was obstructed before EBRT reopened or improvement 
of obstructive pneumonia was observed on follow-up chest X-ray or computed 
tomography after EBRT.
RESULTS: The median survival time was 135 days (range=31-469 days) for the 
responders to EBRT and 45 days (range=23-355 days) for non-responders; this 
difference was statistically significant (p=0.03). One-year overall survival 
rate was 18.5% and 0% for the responders to EBRT and non-responders, 
respectively.
CONCLUSION: Palliative EBRT might be an important option for non-curative lung 
cancer patients with MAO.
