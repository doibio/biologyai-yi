level version of the EuroQoL index (EQ-5D-5L) or proxy version (EQ-5D-5L-P) and 
the Dementia Quality of Life utility measure (DEMQOL-U), which were 
self-completed by competent residents and by a care home staff member proxy 
(DEMQOL-P-U) for all residents (in case the ability to complete changed during 
the study) until 12 months after randomisation. Secondary outcome measures were 
falls at 1-90, 181-270, and 271-360 days after randomisation, Barthel index 
score, and the Physical Activity Measure-Residential Care Homes (PAM-RC) score 
at 91, 180, 270, and 360 days after randomisation.
RESULTS: Mean age of residents was 85 years. 32% were men. GtACH training was 
delivered to 1051/1480 staff (71%). Primary outcome data were available for 630 
participants in the GtACH group and 712 in the usual care group. The unadjusted 
incidence rate ratio for falls between 91 and 180 days was 0.57 (95% confidence 
interval 0.45 to 0.71, P<0.001) in favour of the GtACH programme (GtACH: six 
falls/1000 residents v usual care: 10 falls/1000). Barthel activities of daily 
living indices and PAM-RC scores were similar between groups at all time points. 
The incremental cost was £108 (95% confidence interval -£271.06 to 487.58), 
incremental QALYs gained for EQ-5D-5L-P was 0.024 (95% confidence interval 0.004 
to 0.044) and for DEMQOL-P-U was 0.005 (-0.019 to 0.03). The incremental costs 
per EQ-5D-5L-P and DEMQOL-P-U based QALY were £4544 and £20 889, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The GtACH programme was associated with a reduction in fall rate 
and cost effectiveness, without a decrease in activity or increase in 
dependency.

distress syndrome on Veno-venous extra corporeal membrane oxygenation: A case 
report.

INTRODUCTION AND IMPORTANCE: COVID-19 can lead to severe acute respiratory 
distress syndrome (ARDS) where Veno-Venous Extra Corporeal Membrane Oxygenation 
(V-V ECMO) may be utilized for patients with severe respiratory failure. Our 
case report highlights a life threatening complication of V-V ECMO - 
intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), in a patient being treated for severe COVID-19 
ARDS.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 41-year-old male of Indian ethnicity with no known 
comorbidities presented with an 8 day history of fever and dyspnoea. The patient 
was diagnosed with COVID-19 through a positive RT PCR test and his clinical 
condition progressively deteriorated requiring mechanical ventilation. Inspite 
of lung protective ventilation strategies and prone ventilation, there was no 
improvement in oxygenation. Therefore, the patient was placed on extra corporeal 
life support. On day three of V-V ECMO, the patient developed anisocoria and his 
GCS dropped to E1VTM1. A non-contrast CT brain scan revealed a large 
intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the right frontoparietal lobe with an extension 
into the right lateral and third ventricles leading to an emergency 
decompressive craniectomy with lax duroplasty.Post intracranial hemorrhage,ECMO 
support was continued without systemic anticoagulation. Despite a transient 
improvement in his GCS post surgery, the patient eventually succumbed to 
refractory septic shock with multi organ dysfunction syndrome.
CLINICAL DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Balancing anticoagulation therapy is one of 
the biggest challenges in managing ECMO support for COVID-19 ARDS. ICH is a rare 
and potentially fatal complication of V-V ECMO with an apparently higher 
incidence among COVID-19 patients. Neurosurgical procedures may be considered in 
such patients when no other possible management strategies are available (and 
the risk of death is imminent).

INTRODUCTION: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic progressive inflammatory 
disease that causes joint destruction. The condition imposes a significant 
economic burden on patients and societies. The present study is aimed at 
evaluating the cost-effectiveness of Infliximab, Adalimumab, and Etanercept in 
treating rheumatoid arthritis in Iran.
METHODS: This is a cost-effectiveness study of economic evaluation in which the 
Markov model was used. The study was carried out on 154 patients with rheumatoid 
arthritis in Fars province taking Infliximab, Adalimumab, and Etanercept. The 
patients were selected through sampling. In this study, the cost data were 
collected from a community perspective, and the outcomes were the mean 
reductions in DAS-28 and QALY. The cost data collection form and the EQ-5D 
questionnaire were also used to collect the required data. The results were 
presented in the form of an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, and the 
sensitivity analysis was used to measure the robustness of the study results. 
The TreeAge Pro and Excel softwares were used to analyze the collected data.
RESULTS: The results showed that the mean costs and the QALY rates in the 
Infliximab, Adalimumab, and Etanercept arms were $ 79,518.33 and 12.34, $ 
91,695.59 and 13.25, and $ 87,440.92 and 11.79, respectively. The one-way 
sensitivity analysis confirmed the robustness of the results. In addition, the 
results of the probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) indicated that on the 
cost-effectiveness acceptability curve, Infliximab was in the acceptance area 
and below the threshold in 77% of simulations. The scatter plot was in the 
mentioned area in 81% and 91% of simulations compared with Adalimumab and 
Etanercept, respectively, implying lower costs and higher effectiveness than the 
other two alternatives. Therefore, the strategy was more cost-effective.
CONCLUSION: According to the results of this study, Infliximab was more 
cost-effective than the other two medications. Therefore, it is recommended that 
physicians use this medication as the priority in treating rheumatoid arthritis. 
It is also suggested that health policymakers consider the present study results 
in preparing treatment guidelines for RA.

Background The prevalence of skin diseases has increased over the last few 
decades, and they contribute to a significant burden on health-care systems 
across the world. Aims/Objective This report looks at the burden of skin and 
subcutaneous diseases in terms of years lived with disability and 
agestandardised years lived with disability in India using the Global Burden of 
Disease Study results from 2017. Methods Data were obtained from the Global 
Burden of Disease online interactive tool. Updated estimates of the world's 
health for 359 diseases and injuries and 84 risk factors from 1990 to 2017 are 
available in this interactive tool. Results Years lived with disability due to 
skin and subcutaneous diseases accounted for 4.02% of the total years lived with 
disability in India in 2017. There was an increase of 53.7% in all age 
standardised years lived with disability for all the skin and subcutaneous 
diseases from 1990 to 2017. Among skin and subcutaneous diseases, dermatitis 
contributed maximum years lived with disability (1.40 million; 95% uncertainty 
interval, 0.82-2.21) in 2017, followed by urticaria (1.02 million; 95% 
uncertainty interval, 0.06-1.44) with percentage increases of 48.9% and 45.7% 
respectively. Conclusion The burden due to infectious skin diseases (e.g., 
scabies, fungal skin disease and bacterial skin disease) and non-infectious 
diseases (e.g., dermatitis, urticaria and psoriasis) has increased over the past 
three decades, however the age-standardised years lived with disability for 
leprosy, scabies, fungal infections, sexually transmitted infections and 
non-melanoma skin cancer (basal cell carcinoma) has decreased. The high burden 
of skin and subcutaneous diseases demand that they be given due importance in 
the national programmes and health policy of India.

BACKGROUND: Conventional cost-effectiveness analysis [CEA] using cost per QALY 
thresholds may counteract other incentives introduced to foster development of 
treatments for rare and ultra-rare diseases. Therefore, alternative economic 
evaluation methods were explored, namely Discrete Choice Experiment Willingness 
to Pay (DCE-WTP) and Relative Social Willingness to Pay (RS-WTP), to value 
interventions for an ultra-rare childhood disease, Neuronal Ceroid 
Lipofuscinosis type 2 (CLN2).
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Treatment for CLN2 was valued from a citizen's 
('social') perspective using DCE-WTP and RS-WTP in a survey of 4,009 United 
Kingdom [UK] adults. Three attributes (initial quality of life, treatment 
effect, and life expectancy) were used in both analyses. For DCE-WTP, a cost 
attribute (marginal income tax increase) was also included. Optimal econometric 
models were identified.
RESULTS: DCE-WTP indicated that UK adults are willing to pay incremental 
increases through taxation for improvements in CLN2 attributes. RS-WTP 
identified a willingness to allocate >40% of a pre-assigned healthcare budget to 
prevent child mortality and approximately 15% for improved health status.
CONCLUSIONS: Both techniques illustrate substantive social WTP for CLN2 
interventions, despite the small number of children benefitting. This highlights 
a gap between UK citizens' willingness to spend on rare disease interventions 
and current funding policies.

Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) or kala azar is one of the main neglected tropical 
diseases, of major importance due to the lethal nature of this zoonosis caused 
by protozoa of genus Leishmania. The study aimed to analyze the time trend in VL 
cases in the state of Piauí, Brazil, from 2008 to 2018, within the total period 
from 1971 to 2018. Data were obtained from the Brazilian Information System for 
Notificable Diseases (SINAN) and the Brazilian Mortality Information System 
(SIM). For burden of disease analysis, data were collected from the Institute 
for Health Metrics and Evaluation through the Global Burden of Diseases, 
Injuries, and Risk Factors (GBD Compare). Prais-Winsten regression analysis was 
used. A total of 2,374 cases were recorded with probable infection in the state 
of Piauí and 2,492 cases in residents of the state. The historical series 
analyzed, from 1971 to 2018, reaffirms the cyclical nature of the disease, based 
on the identification of epidemic peaks in 1983-1984, 1993-1994, 2003-2004, and 
2013-2014. No significant alterations were identified in the trends in 
incidence, mortality, and case-fatality coefficients in the state. However, 
there was a significant increase in the incidence coefficient in the Chapada das 
Mangabeiras Development Territory, with an annual percent change of 17.5%, and a 
decrease in the Vale do Sambito Development Territory (-18.3%) and Vale do Rio 
Guaribas Development Territory (-8,1%). VL has a high burden of disease, 
measured by disability-adjusted life years, and is among the leading neglected 
tropical diseases in the state of Piauí. The study concludes by recommending the 
improvement of surveillance and control measures for this disease.

coletados dados do Instituto de Métricas e Avaliação em Saúde através do estudo 
Carga Global de Doenças, Lesões e Fatores de Risco. Foi empregada a análise de 
regressão Prais-Winsten. Foram registrados 2.374 casos com provável local de 
infecção no Piauí e 2.492 casos em residentes do estado. A série histórica 
analisada, de 1971 a 2018, reafirma o caráter cíclico da doença, pela presença 
dos picos epidêmicos identificados em 1983 e 1984, 1993 e 1994, 2003 e 2004 e 
2013 e 2014. Não foram identificadas alterações significativas na tendência dos 
coeficientes de incidência, mortalidade e letalidade no estado. No entanto, 
houve aumento significativo do coeficiente de incidência no Território de 
Desenvolvimento (TD) Chapada das Mangabeiras (variação percentual anual de 
17,5%) e redução no TD Vale do Sambito (-18,3%) e TD Vale do Rio Guaribas 
(-8,1%). A LV tem a maior carga de doença medida em anos de vida ajustados por 
deficiência entre as doenças tropicais negligenciadas do estado. Recomenda-se o 
aprimoramento das medidas de vigilância e controle do agravo.

Objectives. We aim to report the clinical repercussions of a nutritional 
approach in a patient diagnosed with Niemann Pick disease type C (NPC) using 
miglustat as pharmacological therapy. Case report. A 33-year-old woman diagnosed 
with NPC using miglustat was instructed to look for a dietary management at our 
nutrition service. Patient's symptoms were weight loss and important 
gastrointestinal alterations. Our nutritional prescription was a high-calorie 
and high-protein, lactose- and sucrose-free diet, as well as a daily 
supplementation of L-glutamine, probiotics, omega 3, and coenzyme Q10. After two 
months, the patient had weight gain and improvement in the intestinal health. 
Conclusions. We found that nutritional prescription aided in the treatment of 
NPC and revealed that nutritional care represents an important strategy in the 
management of rare genetic diseases.

Hemophilia is a congenital bleeding disorder caused by low levels of clotting 
factor VIII or IX. The life expectancy of people with hemophilia (PWH) has 
increased with the availability of clotting factor concentrates. At the same 
time, the incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) has increased; in 
retrospective studies, there are conflicting data regarding if, despite this 
increase, the incidence is still lower than in the general population. We 
prospectively compared the incidence of CVD in PWH vs the predicted incidence. 
This prospective, multicenter, observational study included adult PWH (aged >30 
years) from The Netherlands and United Kingdom. They were followed up for a 
5-year period, and CVD incidence was compared with a predicted event rate based 
on the QRISK2-2011 CVD risk model. The primary end point was the observed fatal 
and nonfatal CVD incidence after 5 years compared with the estimated events and 
in relation to severity of hemophilia. The study included 709 patients, of whom 
687 (96.9%) completed 5 years' follow-up or reached an end point. For 108 
patients, the QRISK score could not be calculated at inclusion. For the 
remaining 579, fewer CVD events were observed than predicted: 9 vs 24 (relative 
risk, 0.38; 95% confidence interval, 0.18-0.80; P = .01), corresponding with an 
absolute risk reduction of 2.4%. Severe hemophilia treated on demand had the 
highest risk reduction. There was no statistically significant relation between 
severity of hemophilia and incidence of CVD. In hemophilia, a 
lower-than-predicted CVD incidence was found, supporting the theory that 
hemophilia protects against CVD. The study is registered at 
www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT01303900.

[The taller the longer? - Body height and life expectancy].

[Article in German]

Middeke M.

The importance of height for mortality and life expectancy is a matter of 
controversy. The data on this in different countries vary depending on 
ethnicity, socio-economic and other factors such as age at the time of the 
study. Current German data show a positive correlation in younger cohorts in men 
with hypertension. Vascular factors such as the length of the aorta and its 
elasticity or stiffness seem to play an important role. A recent Dutch study 
shows a negative correlation between height and life expectancy in older women. 
Gender-specific differences in hemodynamics depending on body size or aortic 
length play a decisive role alongside age at the time of the examination.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common progressive neurodegenerative 
disease. Today, AD affects millions of people worldwide and the number of AD 
cases will further increase with longer life expectancy. The AD brain is marked 
by severe neurodegeneration, such as the loss of synapses and neurons, atrophy 
and depletion of neurotransmitter systems, especially in the hippocampus and 
cerebral cortex. Recent findings highlight the important role of mitochondrial 
dysfunction and increased oxidative stress in the pathophysiology of late-onset 
alzheimer's disease (LOAD). These alterations are not only observed in the brain 
of AD patients but also in the periphery. In this review, we discuss the 
potential role of elevated apoptosis, increased oxidative stress and 
mitochondrial dysfunction as peripheral markers for the detection of AD in blood 
cells e.g. lymphocytes. We evaluate recent findings regarding impaired 
mitochondrial function comprising mitochondrial respiration, reduced complex 
activities of the respiratory chain and altered Mitochondrial Membrane Potential 
(MMP) in lymphocytes as well as in neurons. Finally, we will question whether 
these mitochondrial parameters might be suitable as an early peripheral marker 
for the detection of LOAD but also for the transitional stage between normal 
aging and Dementia, "Mild Cognitive Impairment" (MCI).

BACKGROUND: Urinary tract infections (UTI), urolithiasis, and benign prostatic 
hyperplasia (BPH) are three of the most common nonmalignant conditions in 
urology. However, there is still a lack of comprehensive and updated 
epidemiological data. This study aimed to investigate the disease burden of UTI, 
urolithiasis, and BPH in 203 countries and territories from 1990 to 2019.
METHODS: Data were extracted from the Global Burden of Disease 2019, including 
incident cases, deaths, disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) and corresponding 
age-standardized rate (ASR) from 1990 to 2019. Estimated annual percentage 
changes (EAPC) were calculated to evaluate the trends of ASR. The associations 
between disease burden and social development degrees were analyzed using a 
sociodemographic index (SDI).
RESULTS: Compared with 1990, the incident cases of UTI, urolithiasis, and BPH 
increased by 60.40%, 48.57%, and 105.70% in 2019, respectively. The 
age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR) of UTI increased (EAPC = 0.08), while 
urolithiasis (EAPC = - 0.83) and BPH (EAPC = - 0.03) decreased from 1990 to 
2019. In 2019, the age-standardized mortality rate (ASMR) of UTI and 
urolithiasis were 3.13/100,000 and 0.17/100,000, respectively. BPH had the 
largest increase (110.56%) in DALYs in the past three decades, followed by UTI 
(68.89%) and urolithiasis (16.95%). The burden of UTI was mainly concentrated in 
South Asia and Tropical Latin America, while the burden of urolithiasis and BPH 
was recorded in Asia and Eastern Europe. Moreover, the ASIR and SDI of 
urolithiasis in high-SDI regions from 1990 to 2019 were negatively correlated, 
while the opposite trend was seen in low-SDI regions. In 2019, the ASIR of UTI 
in females was 3.59 times that of males, while the ASIR of urolithiasis in males 
was 1.96 times higher than that in females. The incidence was highest in the 
30-34, 55-59, and 65-69 age groups among the UTI, urolithiasis, and BPH groups, 
respectively.
CONCLUSION: Over the past three decades, the disease burden has increased for 
UTI but decreased for urolithiasis and BPH. The allocation of medical resources 
should be based more on the epidemiological characteristics and geographical 
distribution of diseases.

PURPOSE: Hereditary angioedema (HAE), most often caused by a genetically 
mediated deficiency in the activity of C1 inhibitor (C1INH) protein, is 
characterized clinically by recurrent episodes of localized swelling without 
wheals. HAE attacks can be painful, debilitating, and even fatal, resulting in 
physical discomfort, emotional stress, and interruptions of work, school, and/or 
social activities, all of which can affect health-related quality of life 
(HRQoL). Subcutaneous C1INH (C1INH[SC]) is recommended as a first-line option 
for long-term prophylaxis (LTP) in HAE. This narrative review provides a concise 
but comprehensive overview of all published data generated from the pivotal 
Phase III Clinical Study for Optimal Management of Preventing Angioedema With 
Low-Volume Subcutaneous C1-Inhibitor Replacement Therapy (COMPACT) study 
program, which evaluated the use of C1INH(SC) as LTP.
METHODS: A PubMed search was performed using the search terms subcutaneous C1 
inhibitor plus COMPACT with no filters, and another search was performed using 
the term subcutaneous C1 inhibitor, with output limited to clinical trial data 
only. All publications that reported data generated during the Phase III COMPACT 
study were included. Data presentation focused on the US Food and Drug 
Administration-approved dose of 60 IU/kg.
FINDINGS: The search strategy identified a total of 11 publications that 
reported data and analyses from the Phase III COMPACT study. Publications 
reported overall findings from the double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover 
COMPACT study and a subsequent long-term open-label extension (OLE) study. Other 
published analyses included pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic data, HRQoL 
assessments, and findings in patient subgroups including women, pediatric 
patients, and patients ≥65 years of age. Subgroup analyses reported good safety 
and efficacy profiles among age-based subgroups from the COMPACT OLE, including 
pediatric patients, patients ≥65 years of age with comorbidities, and among 
female patients, despite a tendency for HAE to be more severe in women. A number 
of significant HRQoL improvements were noted with C1INH(SC) use, including 
better overall health status, less anxiety, and less work- and activity-related 
impairment versus placebo (double-blind study), and compared with baseline 
(OLE).
IMPLICATIONS: This review provides a concise overview of all published COMPACT 
study data with C1INH(SC). The data reviewed here portray a high level of 
efficacy and tolerability with C1INH(SC), even during periods of treatment that 
exceed 2 years, which does not appear to vary based on patient age or sex. 
Clinically relevant improvements in multiple facets of HRQoL were also reported, 
including better overall HRQoL, less anxiety and depression, and less 
disruptions in work attendance and productivity. These data should be useful for 
assessing the appropriateness of C1INH(SC) therapy for individual patients.

INTRODUCTION: Endometriosis can cause chronic pain and subfertility thereby 
negatively affecting quality of life (QoL). Surgical removal of endometriosis 
lesions leads to improved health-related QoL, although not to the level of QoL 
of healthy controls. Pain intensity and cognitions regarding pain can play a 
crucial role in this health-related QoL following surgical treatment. Cognitive 
behavioural therapy (CBT) is a psychological treatment. In patients with chronic 
pain caused by a variety of medical conditions, CBT is effective in improving 
QoL. We designed a research protocol to investigate the effect of CBT on QoL in 
patients with endometriosis-associated chronic pain who are undergoing surgery.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a study protocol for a randomised controlled trial 
in which 100 patients, undergoing endometriosis removal surgery due to 
endometriosis-associated chronic pain, will be randomised between post-surgery 
usual care with CBT and post-surgery usual care only. Participants in the CBT 
group will additionally receive seven sessions of CBT, focused on expectancy 
management, cognitions regarding pain and emotional and behavioural impact of 
pain. To determine the primary outcome Quality of life, both groups will 
complete questionnaires assessing QoL. The secondary outcomes pain intensity, 
pain cognitions, fatigue and perceived stress are also measured using 
questionnaires. Additionally, a marker for stress (cortisol extracted from a 
hair sample) will be assessed at T0 (baseline assessment), T1 
(post-intervention; 2 weeks after completion of all CBT sessions) and T2 
(follow-up; 14 weeks after T1). Statistical analysis will be performed using 
SPSS software.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study protocol has been approved by the Medical 
Ethical Committee of the region Arnhem-Nijmegen from the Radboud University 
Medical Centre on 2 September 2020. The findings of this study will be published 
in scientific journals and will be presented at scientific conferences.

INTRODUCTION: Recent studies have pointed to the substantial role of private 
health sector delivery of maternal and newborn health (MNH) care in 
low-/middle-income countries (LMICs). While this role has been partly 
documented, an evidence synthesis is missing. To analyse opportunities and 
challenges of private sector delivery of MNH care as they pertain to the new 
World Health Organization (WHO) strategy on engaging the private health service 
delivery sector through governance in mixed health systems, a more granular 
understanding of the private health sector's role and extent in MNH delivery is 
imperative. We developed a scoping review protocol to map and conceptualise 
interventions that were explicitly designed and implemented by formal private 
health sector providers to deliver MNH care in mixed health systems.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This protocol details our intended methodological and 
analytical approach following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic 
Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for scoping reviews. Seven databases 
(Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health, Excerpta Medica Database, 
International Bibliography of the Social Sciences, PubMed, ScienceDirect, Web of 
Science, WHO Institutional Repository for Information Sharing) and two websites 
will be searched for studies published between 1 January 2002 and 1 June 2021. 
For inclusion, quantitative and/or qualitative studies in LMICs must report at 
least one of the following outcomes: maternal morbidity or mortality; newborn 
morbidity or mortality; experience of care; use of formal private sector care 
during pregnancy, childbirth, and postpartum; and stillbirth. Analyses will 
synthesise the evidence base and gaps on private sector MNH service delivery 
interventions for each of the six governance behaviours.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval is not required. Findings will be 
used to develop a menu of private sector interventions for MNH care by 
governance behaviour. This study will be disseminated through a peer-reviewed 
publication, working groups, webinars and partners.

The ubiquity of social media and their deep integration in the contemporary 
society has granted new ways to interact, exchange information, form groups, or 
earn money-all on a scale never seen before. Those possibilities paired with the 
widespread popularity contribute to the level of impact that social media 
display. Unfortunately, the benefits brought by them come at a cost. Social 
Media can be employed by various entities to spread disinformation-so called 
'Fake News', either to make a profit or influence the behaviour of the society. 
To reduce the impact and spread of Fake News, a diverse array of countermeasures 
were devised. These include linguistic-based approaches, which often utilise 
Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Deep Learning (DL). However, as the latest 
advancements in the Artificial Intelligence (AI) domain show, the model's high 
performance is no longer enough. The explainability of the system's decision is 
equally crucial in real-life scenarios. Therefore, the objective of this paper 
is to present a novel explainability approach in BERT-based fake news detectors. 
This approach does not require extensive changes to the system and can be 
attached as an extension for operating detectors. For this purposes, two 
Explainable Artificial Intelligence (xAI) techniques, Local Interpretable 
Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) and Anchors, will be used and evaluated on 
fake news data, i.e., short pieces of text forming tweets or headlines. This 
focus of this paper is on the explainability approach for fake news detectors, 
as the detectors themselves were part of previous works of the authors.

Approximately 30% of patients treated with radical prostatectomy (RP) for 
prostate cancers experience biochemical recurrence (BCR). Post-operative 
radiation therapy (RT) can be either offered immediately after the surgery in 
case of aggressive pathological features or proposed early if BCR occurs. Until 
recently, little data were available regarding the optimal RT timing, protocol, 
volumes to treat, and the benefit of adding androgen deprivation therapies to 
post-operative RT. In this review, we aim to pragmatically discuss current 
literature data on these points. Early salvage RT appears to be the optimal 
post-operative approach, improving oncological outcomes especially with low 
prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels, as well as sparing several unnecessary 
adjuvant treatments. The standard RT dose is still 64-66 Gy to the prostate bed 
in conventional fractionation, but hypofractionation protocols are emerging 
pending on late toxicity data. Several scientific societies have published 
contouring atlases, even though they are heterogeneous and deserve future 
consensus. During salvage RT, the inclusion of pelvic lymph nodes is also 
controversial, but preliminary data show a possible benefit for PSA > 0.34 ng/ml 
at the cost of increased hematological side effects. Concomitant ADT and its 
duration are also discussed, possibly advantageous (at least in terms of 
metastasis-free survival) for PSA rates over 0.6 ng/ml, taking into account life 
expectancy and cardiovascular comorbidities. Intensified regimens, for instance, 
with new-generation hormone therapies, could further improve outcomes in 
carefully selected patients. Finally, recent advances in molecular imaging, as 
well as upcoming breakthroughs in genomics and artificial intelligence tools, 
could soon reshuffle the cards of the current therapeutic strategy.

[How to recognize a patient with palliative needs : a «surprise» question to 
prevent bad surprises].

Early discussion on palliative care with patients with advanced, progressive or 
terminal disease is difficult regardless patient's life expectancy. In Belgium, 
a Royal Decree sets the criteria to identify patients with palliative needs. For 
that purpose, the Palliative Care Indicators Tool (PICT) is proposed. This 
3-step identification tool designed for physicians begins with the so-called 
surprise question, «Would you be surprised if your patient died in the next 6 to 
12 months?». The second and third steps examine the fragility and incurability 
criteria, respectively. The surprise question intends to encourage the clinician 
to trust his/her intuition and to promote a reflection on patient's needs. The 
PICT facilitates communication between caregivers. Also, it makes possible early 
thinking about advanced care planning. Hence, it allows patients to receive 
palliative care in due time. In this paper, after reviewing the background of 
the surprise question, we shall examine the benefits and limitations of the 
surprise question.

Publisher: Parler de soins palliatifs précocement chez les patients lorsqu’ils 
se trouvent à un stade avancé ou terminal d’une maladie grave, évolutive, 
mettant en péril le pronostic vital, quelle que soit son espérance de vie, reste 
difficile. La loi belge s’est dotée en octobre 2018 d’un arrêté royal proposant 
le PICT (Palliative Care Indicators Tool). Cette échelle d’identification, 
conçue en 3 étapes, débute par la question surprise : «Seriez-vous surpris si 
votre patient venait à décéder dans les 6 à 12 prochains mois??». La deuxième 
étape et la troisième étape déterminent respectivement les critères de fragilité 
et d’incurabilité. La question surprise encourage le clinicien à faire confiance 
à son intuition et valorise une réflexion centrée sur les besoins du patient. 
L’utilisation de l’outil PICT peut faciliter la communication entre soignants, 
permettre d’aborder plus tôt la réflexion autour de la planification anticipée 
des soins et offrira ainsi aux patients des soins palliatifs en temps opportun. 
Cet article présente l’historique de la question surprise ainsi que ses 
avantages et ses limites.

The QALY is ableist: on the unethical implications of health states worse than 
dead.

INTRODUCTION: A long-standing criticism of the QALY has been that it would 
discriminate against people in poor health: extending the lives of individuals 
with underlying health conditions gains fewer QALYs than extending the lives of 
'more healthy' individuals. Proponents of the QALY counter that this only 
reflects the general public's preferences and constitutes an efficient 
allocation of resources. A pivotal issue that has thus far been overlooked is 
that there can also be negative QALYs.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Negative QALYs are assigned to the times spent in any 
health state that is considered to be worse than dead. In a health economic 
evaluation, extending the lives of people who live in such states reduces the 
overall population health; it counts as a loss. The problem with this assessment 
is that the QALY is not based on the perspectives of individual patients-who 
usually consider their lives to be well worth living-but it reflects the 
preferences of the general public. While it may be generally legitimate to use 
those preferences to inform decisions about the allocation of health care 
resources, when it comes to states worse than dead, the implications are deeply 
problematic. In this paper, I discuss the (un)ethical aspects of states worse 
than dead and demonstrate how their use in economic evaluation leads to a 
systematic underestimation of the value of life-extending treatments.
CONCLUSION: States worse than dead should thus no longer be used, and a 
non-negative value should be placed on all human lives.

The analysis of level and structure of general and primary morbidity according 
to medical care appealability of Moscow population during implementation of the 
State program "The Development of the City of Moscow Health Care (Metropolitan 
Health Care) in 2012-2020" was carried out according to the data from 
collections of main indices of functioning of medical organizations subordinated 
to the Moscow Health Care Department and health indices of Moscow population. 
The decreasing of both primary and general morbidity indices is established. At 
that, increasing of the life expectancy indices was marked. At the same time, 
population morbidity indices according to medical care appealability are not 
sufficiently reliable in assessing degree of achievement of results of any 
measures of improving population health due to their dependence on multitude of 
factors.
