This study compared the quality-adjusted effectiveness and costs of three 
treatment options for transplant-eligible patients with early progression 
(POD24) of follicular lymphoma. A Markov decision-analytic model using a 20-year 
time horizon was used to compare allogeneic stem cell transplant (alloSCT), 
autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT), and chemo-immunotherapy (O-CHOP). For 
second relapse/refractory disease, novel therapy use was modeled, including 
lenalidomide and rituximab/obinutuzumab, and PI3K inhibitors (PI3Ki). Costs were 
considered from a Canadian public health payer's perspective. Probabilistic 
analyses (10,000 simulations) demonstrated that at a willingness-to-pay 
threshold of $50,000, ASCT was most cost effective 60% of the time. ASCT 
resulted in more life years (10.2 vs. alloSCT 9.9 vs. O-CHOP 10.0) and 
quality-adjusted life years (7.5 vs. alloSCT 6.6 vs. O-CHOP 7.4), with the 
lowest direct costs ($190,128 CAD). In sensitivity analyses, the model was 
robust to key variables, including differing probabilities of progression, 
non-relapse mortality, graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD), costs of treating GVHD, 
costs of PI3Ki, and probability of secondary malignancy from ASCT. However, if 
patients were older than 65 years or their life expectancy was less than 10 
years, chemo-immunotherapy was the preferred strategy. When considering cost, 
effectiveness, and toxicities, the preferred treatment strategy for most 
patients with POD24 follicular lymphoma is ASCT.

Background: Fabry disease (FD, OMIM #301500) is a rare, progressive, X-linked 
inherited, genetic disease due to the functional deficiency of lysosomal 
α-galactosidase (α-GAL) that leads to the accumulation of glycosphingolipids 
(mainly globotriaosylceramide or Gb3) and its derivative 
globotriaosylsphingosine or lyso-Gb3. Classic FD is a multisystem disorder which 
initially presents in childhood with neuropathic pain and dermatological, 
gastrointestinal, ocular, and cochleo-vestibular manifestations. Over time, 
end-organ damage such as renal failure, cardiac arrhythmia and early stroke may 
develop leading to reduced life expectancy in the absence of specific treatment. 
Case presentation: We describe two Kazakh patients who presented in adulthood 
with a delayed diagnosis. We conducted also a family screening through cascade 
genotyping. Conclusion: This is the first description of cases of Fabry disease 
in Central Asia. An extensive family pedigree enabled the identification of ten 
additional family members. Patients with rare genetic diseases often experience 
substantial delays in diagnosis due to their rarity and non-specific symptoms, 
which can negatively impact their management and delay treatment. FD may be 
difficult to diagnose because of the non-specificity of its early and 
later-onset symptoms and its X-linked inheritance. Raising awareness of 
clinicians is important for earlier diagnosis and optimal outcome of specific 
therapies.

Wilson disease is a copper overload disease treatable with the chelators 
D-penicillamine and trientine to enhance urinary excretion or with zinc which 
predominantly inhibits absorption. By lifelong treatment a normal life 
expectancy and significant improvement of hepatic injury as well as neurologic 
manifestation is achievable. Here we evaluate the mode of action for effective 
therapy of Wilson disease. We postulate that there is no quantitative removal of 
copper from the liver possible. The therapeutic goal is the removal of toxic 
free copper (non-ceruloplasmin, but albumin bound copper). This is achievable by 
the induction of metallothionein which is accomplished by chelators and in 
particular by zinc. For control of therapy the option of a direct measurement of 
free copper would be preferable over the less reliable calculation of this 
fraction. A therapeutic challenge is still the full restoration of neurological 
deficits which can hardly be reached by the available chelators. Whether 
bis-choline-tetrathiomolybdate as intracellular copper chelator is an option has 
to be awaited. It is concluded that the goal of actual drug therapy in Wilson 
disease is the normalization of free copper in serum.

The oriental armyworm Mythimna separata (Walker) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) is a 
major migratory pest of cereal crops in East Asia, South Asia and Australia. To 
comprehensively understand the ecological tolerance of M. separata, we collected 
life table data of individuals from four consecutive generations reared under 
outdoor natural fluctuating temperatures from 15 April to 17 October 2018 in 
Yangling, Shaanxi, China. The results showed that the immature stage in early 
summer and summer were shorter than in spring and autumn. High mortality in late 
larval instar and pupal stages was observed in the summer generation. The adult 
pre-oviposition period in autumn was longer than the other seasons. The 
population in the earlier two seasons had heavier pupae and higher fecundity 
than the population in the latter two seasons. The intrinsic rate of increase 
and the finite rate of increase was the highest in early summer (r = 0.1292 
day-1, λ = 1.1391 day-1), followed by spring (r = 0.1102 day-1, λ = 1.1165 
day-1), and was the lowest in summer (r = 0.0281 day-1, λ = 1.0293 day-1). The 
results of this study would be useful to predict the population dynamics of M. 
separata and deepen our standing of the adaptiveness of this migratory pest in 
natural fluctuating ambient environments.

BACKGROUND: Decision-makers need quantifiable data on costs and outcomes to 
determine the optimal mix of antenatal models of care to offer. This study aimed 
to examine the cost utility of a publicly funded Midwifery Group Practice (MGP) 
caseload model of care compared to other models of care and demonstrate the 
feasibility of conducting such an analysis to inform service decision-making.
OBJECTIVE: To provide a methodological framework to determine the value of 
public midwifery in different settings.
METHODS: Incremental costs and incremental utility (health gains measured in 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs)) of public MGP caseload were compared to 
other models of care currently offered at a large tertiary hospital in 
Australia. Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Global Short 
Form scores were converted into utility values by mapping to the EuroQol 5 
dimensions and then converting to QALYs. Costs were assessed from a health 
system funder's point of view.
RESULTS: There were 85 women in the public MGP caseload care group and 72 
received other models of care. Unadjusted total mean cost for mothers' and 
babies' health service use from study entry to 12 months post-partum was $27 618 
for MGP caseload care and $33 608 for other models of care. After adjusting for 
clinical and demographic differences between groups, total costs were 22% higher 
(cost ratio: 1.218, P = 0.04) for other models of maternity care. When 
considering costs to all funders, public MGP caseload care cost $5208 less than 
other models of care. There was no significant difference in QALY between the 
two groups (difference: 0.010, 95% CI: -0.038, 0.018).
CONCLUSION: Public MGP caseload care costs 22% less than other models of care, 
after accounting for differences in baseline characteristics between groups. 
There were no significant differences in QALYs. Public MGP caseload care 
produced comparable health outcomes, with some indication that outcomes may be 
better for lower cost per woman.

Purpose The primary aim of this review was to identify environmental irritants 
known to trigger chronic cough through the life span and develop a comprehensive 
clinically useful irritant checklist. Method A scoping review was conducted 
using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis 
Extension for Scoping Reviews, checklist, and explanation. English-language, 
full-text resources were identified through Medline, PsycINFO, SPORTDiscus, Web 
of Science, and ProQuest Dissertations and Theses Global. Results A total of 
1,072 sources were retrieved; of these, 109 were duplicates. Titles of abstracts 
of 963 articles were screened, with 295 selected for full-text review. Using the 
exclusion and inclusion criteria listed, 236 articles were considered eligible 
and 214 different triggers were identified. Triggers were identified from North 
America, Europe, Africa, Asia, and Australia. Occupational exposures were also 
delineated. Conclusions A clinically useful checklist of both frequently 
encountered triggers and idiosyncratic or rare triggers was developed. The 
clinical checklist provides a unique contribution to streamline and standardize 
clinical assessment of irritant-induced chronic cough. The international scope 
of this review extends the usefulness of the clinical checklist to clinicians on 
most continents.

OBJECTIVE: Home medication review (HMR) programs could minimise patients' 
health-related costs and burdens, thereby enhancing the quality of life and 
well-being. The aim of this economic evaluation is to determine if home 
medication review by community pharmacists (HMR-CP) for patients with type 2 
diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a cost-effective intervention from the Malaysian 
healthcare provider perspective.
METHODS: The economic evaluation was conducted alongside the randomised 
controlled trial (RCT) to estimate the intermediate cost-effectiveness of HMR-CP 
for patients with T2DM. A Markov model was then constructed to project the 
lifetime cost-effectiveness data beyond the RCT. The primary outcomes for the 
economic evaluation were HbA1c and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs).
RESULTS: The intervention and health services costs throughout the 6-month 
HMR-CP trial were RM121.45 (USD28.64) [95%CI: RM115.89 to 127.08 
(USD27.33-29.97)] per participant. At a 6-month follow-up, a significant 
reduction in HbA1c of 0.902% (95% CI: 0.388% to 1.412%) was noted in the HMR-CP 
group compared to the control group. The ICER of HMR-CP intervention versus 
standard care was RM178.82 (USD 42.17) [95%CI: RM86.77-364.03 (USD20.46-85.86)] 
per reduction of HbA1c. HMR-CP intervention [RM12,764.82 (USD3010.57)] was 
associated with an incremental cost of RM83.34 (USD19.66) over control group 
[RM12,682.95 (USD2,991.26)] with an additional of 0.07 QALY gained. The ICER 
associated with HMR-CP intervention was RM1,190.57 (USD280.79) per QALY gained, 
which was below the ICER threshold in Malaysia, indicating that HMR-CP was a 
cost-effective option.
CONCLUSION: HMR-CP was a cost-effective intervention that had significantly 
reduced the HbA1c among the T2DM patients, although associated with higher mean 
total costs per participant.

Individual life expectancies provide information for individuals making 
retirement decisions and for policy makers. For couples, analogous measures are 
the expected years both spouses will be alive (joint life expectancy) and the 
expected years the surviving spouse will be a widow or widower (survivor life 
expectancy). Using individual life expectancies to calculate summary measures 
for couples is intuitively appealing but yield misleading results, overstating 
joint life expectancy and dramatically understating survivor life expectancies. 
This implies that standard "individual life cycle models" are misleading for 
couples and that "couple life cycle models" must be substantially more complex. 
Using the CDC life tables for 2010, we construct joint and survivor life 
expectancy measures for randomly formed couples. The couples we form are defined 
by age, race and ethnicity, and education. Due to assortative marriage, 
inequalities in individual life expectancies are compounded into inequalities in 
joint and survivor life expectancies. We also calculate life expectancy measures 
for randomly formed couples for the 1930-2010 decennial years. Trends over time 
show how the relative rate of decrease in the mortality rates of men and women 
affect joint and survivor life expectancies. Because our couple life expectancy 
measures are based on randomly formed couples, they do not capture the effects 
of differences in spouses' premarital characteristics (apart from sex, age, race 
and ethnicity, and, in some cases, education) or of correlations in spouses' 
experiences or behaviors during marriage. However, they provide benchmarks which 
have been sorely lacking in the public discourse.

BACKGROUND: In South Africa, replacing smear microscopy with Xpert-MTB/RIF 
(Xpert) for tuberculosis diagnosis did not reduce mortality and was 
cost-neutral. The unchanged mortality has been attributed to suboptimal Xpert 
implementation. We developed a mathematical model to explore how complementary 
investments may improve cost-effectiveness of the tuberculosis diagnostic 
algorithm.
METHODS: Complementary investments in the tuberculosis diagnostic pathway were 
compared to the status quo. Investment scenarios following an initial Xpert test 
included actions to reduce pre-treatment loss-to-follow-up; supporting same-day 
clinical diagnosis of tuberculosis after a negative result; and improving access 
to further tuberculosis diagnostic tests following a negative result. We 
estimated costs, deaths and disability-adjusted-life-years (DALYs) averted from 
provider and societal perspectives. Sensitivity analyses explored the mediating 
influence of behavioural, disease- and organisational characteristics on 
investment effectiveness.
FINDINGS: Among a cohort of symptomatic patients tested for tuberculosis, with 
an estimated active tuberculosis prevalence of 13%, reducing pre-treatment 
loss-to-follow-up from ~20% to ~0% led to a 4% (uncertainty interval [UI] 3; 4%) 
reduction in mortality compared to the Xpert scenario. Improving access to 
further tuberculosis diagnostic tests from ~4% to 90% among those with an 
initial negative Xpert result reduced overall mortality by 28% (UI 27; 28) at 
$39.70/ DALY averted. Effectiveness of investment scenarios to improve access to 
further diagnostic tests was dependent on a high return rate for follow-up 
visits.
INTERPRETATION: Investing in direct and indirect costs to support the TB 
diagnostic pathway is potentially highly cost-effective.

BACKGROUND: Spondyloarthritis (SpA) has a significant impact on patients' 
quality of life due to functional impairments. Generic health instruments like 
the EuroQoL 5-dimension (EQ-5D) is important for cost-utility analysis of health 
care interventions and calculation of quality-adjusted life-years. It has been 
validated in patients with SpA. However, its responsiveness property is unclear. 
Hence, the aim of study is to test the responsiveness properties of the EQ-5D 
health measure for Chinese patients with SpA.
METHODS: Prospective and consecutive recruitment of 151 Chinese patients with 
SpA was conducted with follow-up assessments 6 months later. Demographic data 
including smoking and drinking habits, education level, income and occupation 
was collected. Disease-associated data including disease duration, presence of 
back pain, peripheral arthritis, dactylitis, enthesitis, uveitis, psoriasis, and 
inflammatory bowel disease was also recorded. Questionnaires regarding disease 
activity and functional disability (BASDAI, BASFI, BASGI, BASMI, ASDAS), mental 
health (HADS) and the EQ-5D scores were recorded. Responsiveness was tested 
against the global rating of change scale (GRC) and changes in disease activity 
using BASDAI and ASDAS-CRP.
RESULTS: A total of 113 (74.8%) patients completed the follow-up assessments. 
Most patients (61.6%) had low disease activity level with BASDAI <4 and 39.7% of 
patients had inactive disease by ASDAS-CRP. EQ-5D scores was well discriminated 
along with BASDAI and BASFI scores. EQ-5D scores also correlated well with HADS. 
The GRC was not able to discriminate adequately. No significant ceiling or floor 
effect was observed.
CONCLUSIONS: EQ-5D demonstrates satisfactory responsiveness property for 
assessment of changes in SpA disease activity.

4-Nitrophenol, a priority pollutant, is degraded by Gram-positive and 
Gram-negative bacteria via 1,2,4-benzenetriol (BT) and hydroquinone (HQ), 
respectively. All enzymes involved in the two pathways have been functionally 
identified. So far, all Gram-negative 4-nitrophenol utilizers are from the 
genera Pseudomonas and Burkholderia. But it remains a mystery why pnpG, an 
apparently superfluous BT 1,2-dioxygenase-encoding gene, always coexists in the 
catabolic cluster (pnpABCDEF) encoding 4-nitrophenol degradation via HQ. Here, 
the physiological role of pnpG in Burkholderia sp. strain SJ98 was investigated. 
Deletion and complementation experiments established that pnpG is essential for 
strain SJ98 growing on 4-nitrocatechol rather than 4-nitrophenol. During 
4-nitrophenol degradation by strain SJ98 and its two variants (pnpG deletion and 
complementation strains), 1,4-benzoquinone and HQ were detected, but neither 
4-nitrocatechol nor BT was observed. When the above-mentioned three strains (the 
wild type and complementation strains with 2,2'-dipyridyl) were incubated with 
4-nitrocatechol, BT was the only intermediate detected. The results established 
the physiological role of pnpG that encodes BT degradation in vivo. 
Biotransformation analyses showed that the pnpA-deleted strain was unable to 
degrade both 4-nitrophenol and 4-nitrocatechol. Thus, the previously 
characterized 4-nitrophenol monooxygenase PnpASJ98 is also essential for the 
conversion of 4-nitrocatechol to BT. Among 775 available complete genomes for 
Pseudomonas and Burkholderia, as many as 89 genomes were found to contain the 
putative pnpBCDEFG genes. The paucity of pnpA (3 in 775 genomes) implies that 
the extension of BT and HQ pathways enabling the degradation of 4-nitrophenol 
and 4-nitrocatechol is rarer, more recent, and likely due to the release of 
xenobiotic nitroaromatic compounds. IMPORTANCE An apparently superfluous gene 
(pnpG) encoding BT 1,2-dioxygenase is always found in the catabolic clusters 
involved in 4-nitrophenol degradation via HQ by Gram-negative bacteria. Our 
experiments reveal that pnpG is not essential for 4-nitrophenol degradation in 
Burkholderia sp. strain SJ98 but instead enables its degradation of 
4-nitrocatechol via BT. The presence of pnpG genes broadens the range of growth 
substrates to include 4-nitrocatechol or BT, intermediates from the microbial 
degradation of many aromatic compounds in natural ecosystems. In addition, the 
existence of pnpCDEFG in 11.6% of the above-mentioned two genera suggests that 
the ability to degrade BT and HQ simultaneously is ancient. The extension of BT 
and HQ pathways including 4-nitrophenol degradation seems to be an adaptive 
evolution for responding to synthetic nitroaromatic compounds entering the 
environment since the industrial revolution.

The four-pass transmembrane proteins Vangl1 and Vangl2 are dedicated core 
components of Wnt/planar cell polarity (Wnt/PCP) signaling that critically 
regulate polarized cell behaviors in many morphological and physiological 
processes. Here, we found that the abundance of Vangl proteins is tightly 
controlled by the ubiquitin-proteasome system through endoplasmic 
reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD). The key ERAD component p97/VCP directly 
binds to Vangl at a highly conserved VCP-interacting motif and recruits the E3 
ligase KBTBD7 via its UBA-UBX adaptors to promote Vangl ubiquitination and ERAD. 
We found that Wnt5a/CK1 prevents Vangl ubiquitination and ERAD by inducing Vangl 
phosphorylation, which facilitates Vangl export from the ER to the plasma 
membrane. We also provide in vivo evidence that KBTBD7 regulates convergent 
extension during zebrafish gastrulation and functions as a tumor suppressor in 
breast cancer by promoting Vangl degradation. Our findings reveal a previously 
unknown regulatory mechanism of Wnt/PCP signaling through the 
p97/VCP-KBTBD7-mediated ERAD pathway.

Cost-effectiveness of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging and MRI-guided 
biopsy in a population-based prostate cancer screening setting using a 
micro-simulation model.

BACKGROUND: The introduction of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging 
(mpMRI) and MRI-guided biopsy has improved the diagnosis of prostate cancer. 
However, it remains uncertain whether it is cost-effective, especially in a 
population-based screening strategy.
METHODS: We used a micro-simulation model to assess the cost-effectiveness of an 
MRI-based prostate cancer screening in comparison to the classical 
prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening, at a population level. The test 
sensitivity parameters for the mpMRI and MRI-guided biopsy, grade 
misclassification rates, utility estimates, and the unit costs of different 
interventions were obtained from literature. We assumed the same screening 
attendance rate and biopsy compliance rate for both strategies. A probabilistic 
sensitivity analysis, consisting of 1000 model runs, was performed to estimate a 
mean incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) and assess uncertainty. A 
€20,000 willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) 
gained, and a discounting rate of 3.5% was considered in the analysis.
RESULTS: The MRI-based screening improved the life-years (LY) and QALYs gained 
by 3.5 and 3, respectively, in comparison to the classical screening pathway. 
Based on the probabilistic sensitivity analyses, the MRI screening pathway leads 
to total discounted mean incremental costs of €15,413 (95% confidence interval 
(CI) of €14,556-€16,272) compared to the classical screening pathway. The 
corresponding discounted mean incremental QALYs gained was 1.36 (95% CI of 
1.31-1.40), resulting in a mean ICER of €11,355 per QALY gained. At a WTP 
threshold of €20,000, the MRI screening pathway has about 84% chance to be more 
cost-effective than the classical screening pathway.
CONCLUSIONS: For triennial screening from age 55-64, incorporation of mpMRI as a 
reflex test after a positive PSA test result with a subsequent MRI-guided biopsy 
has a high probability to be more cost-effective as compared with the classical 
prostate cancer screening pathway.

AIMS: Sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) have been shown to 
have a relevant role in the prevention of hospitalizations for heart failure and 
improvement in the life expectancy of patients with diabetes and outpatients 
with chronic heart failure (CHF) with reduced left ventricular ejection 
fraction, independently from the presence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). 
The aim of our study was to evaluate in a real-world population the number of 
outpatients with CHF who meet the enrolment criteria of the main randomized 
controlled trials (RCT) published in the last 5 years and consequently identify 
the percentage of patients who could potential benefit from SGLT2i therapy.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We retrospectively evaluated all consecutive outpatients 
referred for CHF. The diagnosis of T2DM was according to the latest European 
Society of Cardiology Guidelines. Clinical characteristics considered for the 
enrolment in the RCTs were recorded. We enrolled 515 patients, 384 (75%) of whom 
had a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤ 40%, 82 (16%) had 
pre-diabetes, and 187 (36%) had diabetes. Most of the patients with LVEF ≤ 40% 
met the criteria for the DAPA-HF trial (65%), and this percentage was even 
higher if the serum level of N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide was not 
considered. A high percentage of patients with diabetes and LVEF > 40% met the 
criteria for the DECLARE (39%), CANVAS (47%), and EMPA-REG (30%) trials. 
Patients meeting the enrolment criteria of RCTs evaluating SGLT2i were also 
characterized by a high risk of heart failure events during follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: In spite of a low number of patients actually treated with SGLT2i, 
we observed that a high prevalence of patients with CHF met the clinical 
characteristics of RCTs that have demonstrated a beneficial effect of SGLT2i.

Dietary supplementation with antioxidants provides health benefits by preventing 
diseases caused by oxidative stress and damage. Consequently, there has been 
growing interest in the study of antioxidative foods and their active 
ingredients. Oxidative stress and antioxidative responses are mechanistically 
conserved from Drosophila to mammals. Therefore, as a well-established model 
organism with a short life cycle and advantages of genetic manipulation, the 
fruit fly has been increasingly employed to assess functions of antioxidants in 
vivo. In this review, the antioxidative defense mechanisms, methods used and 
assays developed in Drosophila to evaluate antioxidant supplementation, are 
highlighted. The main manifestations of antioxidation include reduction of 
reactive species, up-regulation of endogenous antioxidants, inhibition on 
oxidative damage to biomacromolecules, enhanced resistance against oxidative 
stress and extension of lifespan, which are related to the activations of 
nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2-antioxidant response element pathway 
and other adaptive responses. Moreover, the key considerations and future 
perspectives for the application of Drosophila models in the studies of 
food-derived antioxidants are discussed.

BACKGROUND: The Short Course Oncology Treatment (SCOT) trial demonstrated 
non-inferiority, less toxicity, and cost-effectiveness from a UK perspective of 
3 versus 6 months of oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy for patients with colorectal 
cancer. This study assessed the cost-effectiveness of shorter treatment and the 
budget impact of implementing trial findings from the perspectives of all 
countries recruited to SCOT: Australia, Denmark, New Zealand, Spain, Sweden, and 
the United Kingdom.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Individual cost-utility analyses were performed from the 
perspective of each country. Resource, quality of life, and survival estimates 
from the SCOT trial (N = 6065) were used. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis and 
subgroup analyses were undertaken. Using undiscounted costs from these 
cost-utility analyses, the impact on country-specific healthcare budgets of 
implementing the SCOT trial findings was calculated over a 5-year period. The 
currency used was US dollars (US$), and 2019 was the base year. One-way and 
scenario sensitivity analysis addressed uncertainty within the budget impact 
analysis.
RESULTS: Three months of treatment were cost saving and cost-effective compared 
to 6 months from the perspective of all countries. The incremental net monetary 
benefit per patient ranged from US$8972 (Spain) to US$13,884 (Denmark). The 
healthcare budget impact over 5 years for the base-case scenario ranged from 
US$3.6 million (New Zealand) to US$61.4 million (UK) and totaled over US$150 
million across all countries.
CONCLUSION: This study has widened the transferability of results from the SCOT 
trial, showing that shorter treatment is cost-effective from a multi-country 
perspective. The vast savings from implementation could fully justify the 
investment in conducting the SCOT trial.

AIM: Coronary angiography is indicated in many patients with known or suspected 
angina for the investigation of coronary artery disease (CAD). However, up to 
half of patients with symptoms of ischaemia have no obstructive coronary 
arteries (INOCA). This large subgroup includes patients with suspected 
microvascular angina (MVA) and/or vasospastic angina (VSA). Clinical guidelines 
relating to the management of patients with INOCA are limited. Uncertainty 
regarding the diagnosis of patients with INOCA presents a health economic 
challenge, both in terms of healthcare resource utilisation and of 
quality-of-life impact on patients.
METHODS: A cost-effectiveness analysis of the introduction of stratified 
medicine into the invasive management of INOCA, based on clinical and 
resource-use data obtained in the CorMicA trial, from a UK NHS perspective. The 
intervention included an invasive diagnostic procedure (IDP) of coronary 
vascular function during coronary angiography to define clinical endotypes to 
target with linked medical therapy. Outcomes of interest were mean total cost 
and QALY gain between treatment groups, and the incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio. We undertook probabilistic sensitivity and scenario analyses.
RESULTS: The incremental cost per QALY gained at 12 months was £4500 (£2937, 
£33264). Compared with a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of £20,000 per QALY, 
the use of the IDP test is cost-effective. At this WTP threshold there is a 96% 
probability of the IDP being cost-effective, based on the uncertainty described 
by bootstrap analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: The burden of INOCA, particularly in women, is known to be 
significant. These findings provided new evidence to inform this unmet clinical 
need.

BACKGROUND: A warming climate throughout the 21st century makes ambient high 
temperature exposure a major threat to population health worldwide. Mitigating 
the health impact of high temperature requires a timely, comprehensive and 
reliable assessment of disease burden globally, regionally and temporally.
AIM: Based on Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study 2019, this study aimed to 
evaluate the disease burden attributable to high temperature from various 
epidemiology perspectives.
METHODS: A three-stage analysis was undertaken to investigate the number and 
age-standardized rates of death and disability-adjusted life years (DALY) 
attributable to high temperature from GBD Study 2019. First, we reported the 
high temperature-related disease burden for the whole world and for different 
groups by gender, age, region, country and disease. Second, we examined the 
temporal trend of the disease burden attributable to high temperature from 1990 
to 2019. Finally, we explored if and how the high temperature-related disease 
burden was modified by a number of country-level indicators.
RESULTS: Globally, high temperature accounted for 0.54% of death and 0.46% of 
DALY in 2019, equating to the age-standardized rates of death and DALY (per 
100,000 population) of 3.99 (95% uncertainty interval (UI): 2.88, 5.93) and 
156.81 (95% UI: 107.98, 261.98), respectively. In 2019, the high 
temperature-related DALY and death rates were the highest for lower respiratory 
infections, although they showed a downward trend. In contrast, during 
1990-2019, high temperature-related non-communicable diseases burden exhibited 
an upward trend. Meanwhile, the disease burden attributable to high temperature 
varied spatially, with the heaviest burden in regions with low sociodemographic 
index (SDI) and the lightest burden in regions with high SDI. In addition, high 
temperature-related disease burden appeared to be higher in a country with a 
higher population density and PM2.5 concentration background but lower in a 
country with a higher density of greenness.
CONCLUSION: This study for the first time provided a comprehensive understanding 
of the global disease burden attributable to high temperature, underscoring the 
policy priority to protect human health worldwide in the context of global 
warming with particular attention to vulnerable countries or regions as well as 
susceptible population and diseases.
