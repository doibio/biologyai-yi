Melorheostosis is an uncommon, sporadic, sclerosing bone lesion that may affect 
the adjacent soft tissues. It has been associated with many entities such as 
osteopoikilosis, soft tissue vascular malformations, bone and soft tissue 
tumors, nephrotic syndrome, segmental limb contractures, osteosarcoma, desmoid 
tumor, and mesenteric fibromatosis. Synovial osteochondromatosis is a benign 
neoplasia of the hyaline cartilage presenting as nodules in the subsynovial 
tissue of a joint or tendon sheath. The intra-articular extension of 
melorheostosis mimicking synovial osteochondromatosis has not been reported 
before. In this article, the authors describe an unusual case mimicking synovial 
chondromatosis arising as a result of melorheostosis and their characteristic 
imaging findings.

The steroid hormone dafachronic acid (DA) regulates dauer formation and lifespan 
in Caenorhabditis elegans by binding to the nuclear receptor DAF-12. However, 
little is known about how DA concentrations change under various physiologic 
conditions and about how DA/DAF-12 signaling interacts with other signaling 
pathways that also regulate dauer formation and lifespan. Using a sensitive 
bioanalytical method, we quantified the endogenous DA concentrations in a 
long-lived germline-less glp-1 mutant and in the Dauer formation-defective 
(Daf-d) mutants daf-12, daf-16, daf-5, and daf-3. We found that the DA 
concentration in the glp-1 mutant was similar to that in the wild type (WT). 
This result is contrary to the long-held belief that germline loss-induced 
longevity involves increased DA production and suggests instead that this type 
of longevity involves an enhanced response to DA. We also found evidence 
suggesting that increased DA sensitivity underlies lifespan extension triggered 
by exogenous DA. At the L2/L3 stage, the DA concentration in a daf-12 null 
mutant decreased to 22% of the WT level. This finding is consistent with the 
previously proposed positive feedback regulation between DAF-12 and DA 
production. Surprisingly, the DA concentrations in the daf-16, daf-5, and daf-3 
mutants were only 19-34% of the WT level at the L2/L3 stage, slightly greater 
than those in the Dauer formation-constitutive (Daf-c) mutants at the pre-dauer 
stage (4-15% of the WT L2 control). Our experimental evidence suggested that the 
positive feedback between DA and DAF-12 was partially induced in the three Daf-d 
mutants.

A Systematic Review of the Burden of Pancreatic Cancer in Europe: Real-World 
Impact on Survival, Quality of Life and Costs.

PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to assess the overall burden of 
pancreatic cancer in Europe, with a focus on survival time in a real-world 
setting, and the overall healthy life lost to the disease.
METHODS: Real-world data were retrieved from peer-reviewed, observational 
studies identified by an electronic search. We performed two de novo analyses: a 
proportional shortfall analysis to quantify the proportion of healthy life lost 
to pancreatic cancer and an estimation of the aggregate life-years lost annually 
in Europe.
RESULTS: Ninety-one studies were included. The median, age-standardised 
incidence of pancreatic cancer per 100,000 was 7.6 in men and 4.9 in women. 
Overall median survival from diagnosis was 4.6 months; median survival was 
2.8-5.7 months in patients with metastatic disease. The proportional shortfall 
analysis showed that pancreatic cancer results in a 98 % loss of healthy life, 
with a life expectancy at diagnosis of 4.6 months compared to 15.1 years for an 
age-matched healthy population. Annually, 610,000-915,000 quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs) are lost to pancreatic cancer in Europe. Patients had 
significantly lower scores on validated health-related quality of life 
instruments versus population norms.
CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to 
systematically review real-world overall survival and patient outcomes of 
pancreatic cancer patients in Europe outside the context of clinical trials. Our 
findings confirm the poor prognosis and short survival reported by national 
studies. Pancreatic cancer is a substantial burden in Europe, with nearly a 
million aggregate life-years lost annually and almost complete loss of healthy 
life in affected individuals.

BACKGROUND: Cannabis is the most frequently used illicit drug globally. Despite 
increasing evidence that cannabis use is associated with adverse health effects, 
the knowledge on preventative strategies is still limited. This study stemmed 
from a systematic review of effective prevention in which school-based 
programmes were identified as promising. The primary objective was to evaluate 
the cost effectiveness of Project ALERT (Adolescent, Learning, Experiences, 
Resistance, and Training), compared with ordinary ATOD (Alcohol, Tobacco, and 
Other Drug) education, among Swedish students in the eighth grade of compulsory 
school.
METHODS: The cost-effectiveness analysis was performed from the societal 
perspective with quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) as an outcome 
(willingness-to-pay threshold €50,000) and follow-up periods from 1 year to a 
lifetime, considering a discounting rate of 3%, and with costs inflated to 2013 
levels. A Markov model was constructed on the basis of the 'states' of single 
use, regular use, daily use and use of other illicit drugs, which were 
associated with 'complications' of psychosis, schizophrenia, traffic accidents, 
depression and amotivational syndrome. Health and cost consequences were linked 
to both states and complications.
RESULTS: The programme was cost saving on the basis of evidence from the USA 
(ratio 1:1.1), and was cost effective (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
€22,384 per QALY) after reasonable adjustment for the Swedish context and with 
20 years of follow-up. When the target group was restricted to boys who were 
neither studying nor working/doing work experience, the programme was cost 
effective after 9 years and cost saving (ratio 1:3.2) after 20 years.
CONCLUSION: School-based prevention such as Project ALERT has the potential to 
be cost effective and to be cost saving if implemented in deprived areas. In the 
light of the shifting landscape regarding legalization of cannabis, it seems 
rational to continue the health economic analysis of prevention initiated here.

People age at different rates. We have proposed that rates of aging can be 
quantified by the rate at which individuals accumulate health deficits. Earlier 
estimates, using cross-sectional analyses suggested that deficits accumulated 
exponentially, at an annual rate of 3.5%. Here, we estimate the rate of deficit 
accumulation using longitudinal data from the Canadian National Population 
Health Survey. By analyzing age-specific trajectories of deficit accumulation in 
people aged 20 years and over (n = 13,668) followed biannually for 16 years, we 
found that the longitudinal average annual rate of deficit accumulation was 4.5% 
(±0.75%). This estimate was notably stable during the adult life span. The 
corresponding average doubling time in the number of deficits was 15.4 (95% CI 
14.82-16.03) years, roughly 30% less than we had reported from the 
cross-sectional analysis. Earlier work also established that the average number 
of deficits accumulated by individuals (N), equals the product of the intensity 
of environmental stresses (λ) causing damage to the organism, by the average 
recovery time (W). At the individual level, changes in deficit accumulation can 
be attributed to both changes in environmental stresses and changes in recovery 
time. By contrast, at the population level, changes in the number of deficits 
are proportional to the changes in recovery time. In consequence, we propose 
here that the average recovery time, W doubles approximately every 15.4 years, 
independently of age. Such changes quantify the increase of vulnerability to 
stressors as people age that gives rise to increasing risk of frailty, 
disability and death. That deficit accumulation will, on average, double twice 
between ages 50 and 80 highlights the importance of health in middle age on late 
life outcomes.

Primary chondroid tumors of the larynx represent less than 1% of all laryngeal 
tumors. Most of them are chondromas and they often involve to the cricoid 
cartilage. They are characterized by a low tendency to metastatic diffusion (low 
grade). The treatment of choice is surgery, which may be endoscopic or "open 
partial surgery", if extension of the cancer is limited. Prognosis is generally 
good. In this report, two cases of low grade chondrosarcoma of the larynx are 
presented, one was treated surgically with cricoidectomy and partial 
laryngectomy, and another was treated surgically with hemicricoidectomy. 
Laryngoscopy reveals tumefaction of the larynx, covered by intact mucosa. 
Computerized tomography imaging with contrast and magnetic resonance imaging 
defines not only coarse calcifications, pathognomonic of chondromatous 
neoformations but also the relationship of the neoformation with the surrounding 
tissues. Treatment is essentially surgical, given the importance of preserving 
the larynx to patients' quality of life, the only risk is recurrence, which is 
treated by a second surgery.

Diagnostic studies of accuracy targeting sensitivity and specificity are 
commonly done in a paired design in which all modalities are applied in each 
patient, whereas cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses are usually 
assessed either directly alongside to or indirectly by means of stochastic 
modeling based on larger randomized controlled trials (RCTs). However the 
conduct of RCTs is hampered in an environment such as ours, in which technology 
is rapidly evolving. As such, there is a relatively limited number of RCTs. 
Therefore, we investigated as to which extent paired diagnostic studies of 
accuracy can be also used to shed light on economic implications when 
considering a new diagnostic test. We propose a simple decision tree model-based 
cost-utility analysis of a diagnostic test when compared to the current standard 
procedure and exemplify this approach with published data from lymph node 
staging of prostate cancer. Average procedure costs were taken from the Danish 
Diagnosis Related Groups Tariff in 2013 and life expectancy was estimated for an 
ideal 60 year old patient based on prostate cancer stage and prostatectomy or 
radiation and chemotherapy. Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were deduced 
from the literature, and an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was used 
to compare lymph node dissection with respective histopathological examination 
(reference standard) and (18)F-fluoromethylcholine positron emission 
tomography/computed tomography (FCH-PET/CT). Lower bounds of sensitivity and 
specificity of FCH-PET/CT were established at which the replacement of the 
reference standard by FCH-PET/CT comes with a trade-off between worse 
effectiveness and lower costs. Compared to the reference standard in a 
diagnostic accuracy study, any imperfections in accuracy of a diagnostic test 
imply that replacing the reference standard generates a loss in effectiveness 
and utility. We conclude that diagnostic studies of accuracy can be put to a 
more extensive use, over and above a mere indication of sensitivity and 
specificity of an imaging test, and that health economic considerations should 
be undertaken when planning a prospective diagnostic accuracy study. These 
endeavors will prove especially fruitful when comparing several imaging 
techniques with one another, or the same imaging technique using different 
tracers, with an independent reference standard for the evaluation of results.

Metastatic epidural spinal cord compression (MESCC) is an oncologic emergency 
and if left untreated, permanent paralysis will ensue. The treatment of MESCC is 
governed by disease, patient, and treatment factors. Patient's preferences and 
goals of care are to be weighed into the treatment plan. Ideally, a patient with 
MESCC is evaluated by an interdisciplinary team promptly to determine the 
urgency of the clinical scenario. Treatment recommendations must take into 
consideration the risk-benefit profiles of surgical intervention and 
radiotherapy for the particular individual's circumstance, including neurologic 
status, performance status, extent of epidural disease, stability of the spine, 
extra-spinal disease status, and life expectancy. In patients with high spinal 
instability neoplastic score (SINS) or retropulsion of bone fragments in the 
spinal canal, surgical intervention should be strongly considered. The rate of 
development of motor deficits from spinal cord compression may be a prognostic 
factor for ultimate functional outcome, and should be taken into account when a 
treatment recommendation is made. The American College of Radiology 
Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical 
conditions that are reviewed every three years by a multidisciplinary expert 
panel. The guideline development and review include an extensive analysis of 
current medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and the application of a 
well-established consensus methodology (modified Delphi) to rate the 
appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures by the panel. In those 
instances where evidence is lacking or not definitive, expert opinion may be 
used to recommend imaging or treatment.

In clinical trials, sofosbuvir showed high antiviral activity in patients 
infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) across all genotypes. We aimed to 
determine the cost-effectiveness of sofosbuvir-based treatment compared to 
current standard treatment in mono-infected patients with chronic hepatitis C 
(CHC) genotypes 1-4 in Switzerland. Cost-effectiveness was modelled from the 
perspective of the Swiss health care system using a lifetime Markov model. 
Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) used an endpoint of cost per 
quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. Treatment characteristics, quality of 
life, and transition probabilities were obtained from published literature. 
Country-specific model inputs such as patient characteristics, mortality and 
costs were obtained from Swiss sources. We performed extensive sensitivity 
analyses. Costs and effects were discounted at 3% (range: 0-5%) per year. 
Sofosbuvir-containing treatment in mixed cohorts of cirrhotic and non-cirrhotic 
patients with CHC genotypes 1-4 showed ICERs between CHF 10,337 and CHF 91,570 
per QALY gained. In subgroup analyses, sofosbuvir dominated telaprevir- and 
boceprevir-containing treatment in treatment-naïve genotype 1 cirrhotic 
patients. ICERs of sofosbuvir were above CHF 100,000 per QALY in 
treatment-naïve, interferon eligible, non-cirrhotic patients infected with 
genotypes 2 or 3. In deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses, 
results were generally robust. From a Swiss health care system perspective, 
treatment of mixed cohorts of cirrhotic and non-cirrhotic patients with CHC 
genotypes 1-4 with sofosbuvir-containing treatment versus standard treatment 
would be cost-effective if a threshold of CHF 100,000 per QALY was assumed.

The establishment of neuronal polarity and axonal outgrowth are key processes 
affecting neuronal migration and synapse formation, their impairment likely 
leading to cognitive deficits. Here we have found that the apoptotic protease 
activating factor 1 (Apaf1), apart from its canonical role in apoptosis, plays 
an additional function in cortical neurons, where its deficiency specifically 
impairs axonal growth. Given the central role played by centrosomes and 
microtubules in the polarized extension of the axon, our data suggest that 
Apaf1-deletion affects axonal outgrowth through an impairment of centrosome 
organization. In line with this, centrosomal protein expression, as well as 
their centrosomal localization proved to be altered upon Apaf1-deletion. 
Strikingly, we also found that Apaf1-loss affects trans-Golgi components and 
leads to a robust activation of AMP-dependent protein kinase (AMPK), this 
confirming the stressful conditions induced by Apaf1-deficiency. Since AMPK 
hyper-phosphorylation is known to impair a proper axon elongation, our finding 
contributes to explain the effect of Apaf1-deficiency on axogenesis. We also 
discovered that the signaling pathways mediating axonal growth and involving 
glycogen synthase kinase-3β, liver kinase B1, and collapsing-response mediator 
protein-2 are altered in Apaf1-KO neurons. Overall, our results reveal a novel 
non-apoptotic role for Apaf1 in axonal outgrowth, suggesting that the neuronal 
phenotype due to Apaf1-deletion could not only be fully ascribed to apoptosis 
inhibition, but might also be the result of defects in axogenesis. The discovery 
of new molecules involved in axonal elongation has a clinical relevance since it 
might help to explain neurological abnormalities occurring during early brain 
development.

The emergence of early life must have been marked by the appearance in the 
prebiotic era of complex molecular structures and systems, motivating the 
investigation of conditions that could not only facilitate appropriate chemical 
synthesis, but also provide the mechanisms of molecular selection and structural 
templating necessary to pilot the complexification toward specific molecular 
patterns. We recently proposed and demonstrated that these functions could be 
afforded by the spontaneous ordering of ultrashort nucleic acids oligomers into 
Liquid Crystal (LC) phases. In such supramolecular assemblies, duplex-forming 
oligomers are held in average end-to-end contact to form chemically 
discontinuous but physically continuous double helices. Using blunt ended 
duplexes, we found that LC formation could both provide molecular selection 
mechanisms and boost inter-oligomer ligation. This paper provides an essential 
extension to this notion by investigating the catalytic effects of LC ordering 
in duplexes with mutually interacting overhangs. Specifically, we studied the 
influence of LC ordering of 5'-hydroxy-3'-phosphate partially self-complementary 
DNA 14mers with 3'-CG sticky-ends, on the efficiency of non-enzymatic ligation 
reaction induced by water-soluble carbodiimide EDC as condensing agent. We 
investigated the ligation products in mixtures of DNA with poly-ethylene glycol 
(PEG) at three PEG concentrations at which the system phase separates creating 
DNA-rich droplets that organize into isotropic, nematic LC and columnar LC 
phases. We observe remarkable LC-enhanced chain lengthening, and we demonstrate 
that such lengthening effectively promotes and stabilizes LC domains, providing 
the kernel of a positive feedback cycle by which LC ordering promotes 
elongation, in turn stabilizing the LC ordering.

PURPOSE: Disease-specific instruments have shown significant gains in measuring 
health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in subjects having cataract surgery. 
However, the usage of generic instruments has resulted in conflicting evidence.
METHODS: In this prospective study, we have evaluated the impact of cataract 
surgery on subjects' HRQoL measured with a 15-dimension generic instrument, the 
15D. The HRQoL of cataract subjects was compared with that of an age- and 
gender-standardized sample of the general population in Finland. A total of 152 
subjects (mean age 74 years, 66% females) with a first-eye cataract surgery 
completed the 15D questionnaire both before and 12 months after cataract 
surgery.
RESULTS: When compared with the general population, cataract subjects had much 
lower HRQoL at baseline (mean difference 0.037 (95% CI: 0.020, 0.054), p < 
0.001). At 12 months after cataract surgery, the overall utility index improved 
from the mean of 0.837 to 0.855 (mean difference 0.018 (95% CI: 0.007, 0.029), p 
= 0.002). Significant improvement was observed on the following five dimensions: 
seeing, moving, hearing, usual activities and discomfort/symptoms in the 15D 
questionnaire.
CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that at 12 months after first-eye cataract 
surgery, patients' HRQoL is slightly better than that before surgery. However, 
patients' postoperative HRQoL may remain lower than that of an age-and 
gender-standardized control population.

Dehydroabietic acid (DAA) is a naturally occurring diterpene resin acid of 
confers, such as pinus species (P. densiflora, P. sylvestris) and grand fir 
(Abies grandis), and it induces various biological actions including 
antimicrobial, antiulcer, and cardiovascular activities. The cellular targets 
that mediate these actions are largely unknown yet. In this report, we suggest 
that DAA is an anti-aging reagent. DAA has lifespan extension effects in 
Caenorhabditis elegans, prevents lipofuscin accumulation, and prevents collagen 
secretion in human dermal fibroblasts. We found that these anti-aging effects 
are primarily mediated by SIRT1 activation. Lifespan extension effects by DAA 
were ameliorated in sir-2.1 mutants and SIRT1 protein expression was increased, 
resulting in the deacetylation of SIRT1 target protein PGC-1α. Moreover, DAA 
binds directly to the SIRT1 protein independent of the SIRT1 substrate NAD(+) 
levels. Through a molecular docking study, we also propose a binding model for 
DAA-SIRT1. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the anti-aging effects 
are the first identified biological property of DAA and that the direct 
activation of SIRT1 enzymatic activity suggests the potential use of this 
natural diterpene, or related compounds, in age-related diseases or as a 
preventive reagent against the aging process.

INTRODUCTION: The BENEFIT study has demonstrated the benefits of early treatment 
with interferon beta 1b (IFNβ-1b). The objective of this study was to estimate 
the efficiency of early vs delayed IFNβ-1b treatment in patients with clinically 
isolated syndrome (CIS) suggestive of multiple sclerosis (MS) in Spain.
METHODS: A Markov model reflecting the social perspective was developed with 
time horizons ranging from 2 years to lifetime. A cohort of 1000 patients with 
CIS, whose health status had been measured on the Expanded Disability Symptom 
Scale (EDSS), included patients who received early IFNβ-1b treatment and those 
who did not. Data from the BENEFIT study were used to model EDSS progression and 
transitions to MS. Costs were estimated from published literature. Patient 
utilities were derived from EQ-5D data and published data. Mortality was 
estimated using life tables and EDSS data. Costs (€ at 2013 rates) and outcomes 
were discounted at 3% per annum. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis was 
performed.
RESULTS: In the base case, both the incremental cost utility ratio (ICUR) and 
the incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) of IFNβ-1b versus no treatment 
were dominant (more effective and less costly) from a social perspective. From 
the perspective of the Spanish Health System, the ICUR was € 40,702/QALY and the 
ICER was € 13/relapse avoided.
CONCLUSION: Early treatment with IFNβ-1b after a CIS versus delayed treatment is 
efficient from a social perspective, but it may not be efficient from the 
perspective of the NHS which does not take non health-related costs into 
account.

BACKGROUND: Coronary CT angiography (CCTA) has been proven accurate and is 
incorporated in clinical recommendations for coronary artery disease (CAD) 
diagnosis workup, but cost-effectiveness data, especially in comparison to other 
methods such as myocardial single photon emission CT (SPECT) are insufficient.
OBJECTIVE: To compare the cost-effectiveness of CCTA and myocardial SPECT in a 
real-world setting.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study on consecutive patients with 
suspected CAD and a pretest probability between 10% and 90%. Test accuracy was 
compared by correcting referral bias to coronary angiography depending on 
noninvasive test results based on the Bayes' theorem and also by incorporating 
1-year follow-up results. Cost-effectiveness was analyzed using test accuracy 
and quality-adjusted life year (QALY). The model using diagnostic accuracy used 
the number of patients accurately diagnosed among 1000 persons as the effect and 
contained only expenses for diagnostic testing as the cost. In the model using 
QALY, a decision tree was developed, and the time horizon was 1 year.
RESULTS: CCTA was performed in 635 patients and SPECT in 997 patients. An 
accurate diagnosis per 1000 patients was achieved in 725 patients by CCTA vs 661 
patients by SPECT. In the model using diagnostic accuracy, CCTA was more 
effective and less expensive than SPECT ($725.38 for CCTA vs $661.46 for SPECT). 
In the model using QALY, CCTA was generally more effective in terms of life 
quality (0.00221 QALY) and cost ($513) than SPECT. However, cost utility varied 
among subgroups, with SPECT outperforming CCTA in patients with a pretest 
probability of 30% to 60% (0.01890 QALY; $113).
CONCLUSION: These results suggest that CCTA may be more cost-effective than 
myocardial SPECT.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of universal screening for thyroid 
disease in pregnant women in Spain as compared to high risk screening and no 
screening.
METHODOLOGY: A decision-analytic model comparing the incremental cost per 
quality-adjusted life year (QALY) of universal screening versus high risk 
screening and versus no screening. was used for the pregnancy and postpartum 
period. Probabilities from randomized controlled trials were considered for 
adverse obstetrical outcomes. A Markov model was used to assess the lifetime 
period after the first postpartum year and account for development of overt 
hypothyroidism. The main assumptions in the model and use of resources were 
assessed by local clinical experts. The analysis considered direct healthcare 
costs only.
RESULTS: Universal screening gained .011 QALYs over high risk screening and .014 
QALYS over no screening. Total direct costs per patient were €5,786 for 
universal screening, €5,791 for high risk screening, and €5,781 for no 
screening. Universal screening was dominant compared to risk-based screening and 
a very cost-effective alternative as compared to no screening. Use of universal 
screening instead of high risk screening would result in €2,653,854 annual 
savings for the Spanish National Health System.
CONCLUSIONS: Universal screening for thyroid disease in pregnant women in the 
first trimester is dominant in Spain as compared to risk-based screening, and is 
cost-effective as compared to no screening (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
of €374 per QALY). Moreover, it allows diagnosing and treating cases of clinical 
and subclinical hypothyroidism that may not be detected when only high-risk 
women are screened.

State, India.

Groundwater samples collected from 96 bore wells in the study area (city of 
Bangalore) were analysed for concentration of natural uranium using 
laser-induced fluorimetry. The risk to the population of the region associated 
with radiological and chemical toxicity of uranium due to its ingestion through 
drinking water over a lifetime was estimated. The concentration of uranium was 
found to be in the range 0.136 to 2027.5 μg L(-1) with an average value of 
92.42 μg L(-1). In the present study, about 61% of the samples show 
concentrations of uranium within the safe limit of 30 μg L(-1) as set by the 
world health organisation. The radiological risk estimated as lifetime cancer 
risk is in the range 4.3  ×  10(-7) to 6.4  ×  10(-3) with an average of 
2.9  ×  10(-4). The chemical toxicity risk measured as lifetime average daily 
dose is found to range from 0.005 to 75.42 μg kg(-1) d(-1). The reference dose 
estimated as 1.12 μg kg(-1) d(-1) was used to assess the chemical toxicity. The 
results indicate that the chemical toxicity due to ingestion of uranium through 
drinking water is of more concern than the radiological toxicity. The present 
study, being the first of its kind in this region, will augment the database of 
uranium in groundwater.

Emergency medical responders were activated to the home of a 59-year-old 
African-American male in distress and with known Down syndrome complicated by 
Alzheimer’s disease. He was found to be unresponsive and subsequently became 
pulseless. Advanced cardiac life support protocols were initiated and continued 
for two hours in the emergency department. Due to family request, efforts were 
eventually ceased and the patient was declared dead. Full, unrestricted autopsy 
examination was conducted under the coroner’s authorization. The cause of death 
was determined to be a pulmonary thromboembolus in the main pulmonary artery 
with extension into the bilateral pulmonary arteries. Additional external 
findings included alopecia universalis, penoscrotal hypospadias, ostium secundum 
type of atrial septal defect, right ventricular cardiac dilatation, diffuse 
cerebral atrophy, facial features compatible with Down syndrome, and generalized 
patches of skin depigmentation over the hands as seen in Figure 1 but also over 
the feet, lips, areola, and trunk. Microscopic findings included features of 
pulmonary hypertension. A microscopic image from a section of the thyroid is 
seen in Figure 2.

Reports have attributed a public health tragedy in Greece to the Great Recession 
and the subsequent application of austerity programs. It is also claimed that 
the comparison of Greece with Iceland and Finland-where austerity policies were 
not applied-reveals the harmful effect of austerity on health and that by 
protecting spending in health and social budgets, governments can offset the 
harmful effects of economic crises on health. We use data on life expectancy, 
mortality rates, incidence of infectious diseases, rates of vaccination, 
self-reported health and other measures to examine the evolution of population 
health and health services performance in Greece, Finland and Iceland since 
1990-2011 or 2012-the most recent years for which data are available. We find 
that in the three countries most indicators of population health continued 
improving after the Great Recession started. In terms of population health and 
performance of the health care system, in the period after 2007 for which data 
are available, Greece did as good as Iceland and Finland. The evidence does not 
support the claim that there is a health crisis in Greece. On the basis of the 
extant evidence, claims of a public health tragedy in Greece seem overly 
exaggerated.

Multi-biomarker panels can capture the nonlinear synergy among biomarkers and 
they are important to aid in the early diagnosis and ultimately battle complex 
diseases. However, identification of these multi-biomarker panels from case and 
control data is challenging. For example, the exhaustive search method is 
computationally infeasible when the data dimension is high. Here, we propose a 
novel method, MILP_k, to identify serum-based multi-biomarker panel to 
distinguish colorectal cancers (CRC) from benign colorectal tumors. 
Specifically, the multi-biomarker panel detection problem is modeled by a mixed 
integer programming to maximize the classification accuracy. Then we measured 
the serum profiling data for 101 CRC patients and 95 benign patients. The 61 
biomarkers were analyzed individually and further their combinations by our 
method. We discovered 4 biomarkers as the optimal small multi-biomarker panel, 
including known CRC biomarkers CEA and IL-10 as well as novel biomarkers IMA and 
NSE. This multi-biomarker panel obtains leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) 
accuracy to 0.7857 by nearest centroid classifier. An independent test of this 
panel by support vector machine (SVM) with threefold cross validation gets an 
AUC 0.8438. This greatly improves the predictive accuracy by 20% over the single 
best biomarker. Further extension of this 4-biomarker panel to a larger 
13-biomarker panel improves the LOOCV to 0.8673 with independent AUC 0.8437. 
Comparison with the exhaustive search method shows that our method dramatically 
reduces the searching time by 1000-fold. Experiments on the early cancer stage 
samples reveal two panel of biomarkers and show promising accuracy. The proposed 
method allows us to select the subset of biomarkers with best accuracy to 
distinguish case and control samples given the number of selected biomarkers. 
Both receiver operating characteristic curve and precision-recall curve show our 
method's consistent performance gain in accuracy. Our method also shows its 
advantage in capturing synergy among selected biomarkers. The multi-biomarker 
panel far outperforms the simple combination of best single features. Close 
investigation of the multi-biomarker panel illustrates that our method possesses 
the ability to remove redundancy and reveals complementary biomarker 
combinations. In addition, our method is efficient and can select 
multi-biomarker panel with more than 5 biomarkers, for which the exhaustive 
methods fail. In conclusion, we propose a promising model to improve the 
clinical data interpretability and to serve as a useful tool for other complex 
disease studies. Our small multi-biomarker panel, CEA, IL-10, IMA, and NSE, may 
provide insights on the disease status of colorectal diseases. The 
implementation of our method in MATLAB is available via the website:

INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Our goal was to evaluate the perioperative, 
functional and intermediate term oncological outcomes of robot assisted radical 
prostatectomy (RARP) in patients ≥ 70 years.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study population (N = 3241) consisted of consecutive 
patients who underwent RARP for localized prostate cancer by a single surgeon 
(VP) from January 2008 through February 2012. A query of our Institutional 
Review Board approved registry identified 400 men ≥ 70 years of age, with good 
functional status (Charlson co-morbidity index < 3). These patients were
