Studies carried out in different countries correlate social, economic, 
environmental, and health factors with the number of cases and deaths from 
COVID-19. However, such studies do not reveal which factors make one country 
more exposed to COVID-19 than other. Based on the composite indicators approach, 
this research identifies the factors that most impact the number of cases and 
deaths of COVID-19 worldwide and measures countries' exposure to COVID-19. Three 
composite indicators of exposure to COVID-19 were constructed through Principal 
Component Analysis, Simple Additive Weighting, and k-means clustering. The 
number of cases and deaths from COVID-19 is strongly correlated ( R  > 0.60) 
with composite indicator scores and moderately concordant ( K  > 0.4) with 
country clusters. Factors directly or indirectly associated with the age of the 
population are the ones that most expose countries to COVID-19. The population 
of countries most exposed to COVID-19 is 12 years older on average. The 
proportion of the elderly population in these countries is at least twice that 
of countries less exposed to COVID-19. Factors that can increase the 
population's life expectancy, such as Gross Domestic Product per capita and the 
Human Development Index, are four times and 1.3 times higher in more exposed 
countries to COVID-19. Providing better living conditions increases both the 
population's life expectancy and the country's exposure to COVID-19.

Major depression, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia are severe mental 
illnesses. Despite receiving psychopharmacological and psychosocial treatments, 
about half of patients develop a chronic course with residual cognitive and 
negative symptoms and have a high risk for cardiovascular disease and reduced 
life expectancy. Therefore, add-on innovative treatment approaches are needed to 
improve outcome. Aerobic exercise interventions have been shown to improve 
global functioning, cognition, and negative and depressive symptoms in these 
patients. The basic mechanism of these exercise-related changes has been 
reported to be improved brain plasticity, e.g., increased volume of 
disease-related brain regions such as the hippocampus. The optimal type, 
duration, and frequency of exercise have not yet been determined and need to be 
addressed in supervised physical exercise studies. Because of the low physical 
activity levels, lack of drive related to negative and depressive symptoms, and 
high prevalence of cardiovascular comorbidities in patients with severe mental 
illness, besides aiming to improve symptoms of mental illness, exercise 
interventions should also aim to increase cardiorespiratory fitness, which they 
should comprehensively assess by direct measurements of maximal oxygen uptake. 
Based on the recommendations for developing cardiorespiratory fitness by the 
American College of Sports Medicine, 150 min moderate-intensity training per 
week or vigorous-intensity exercise training for 75 min per week are 
appropriate. Most studies have had relatively short intervention periods, so 
future studies should focus on long-term adherence to exercise by implementing 
motivational strategies supported by telemedicine and by identifying and 
targeting typical barriers to exercise in this patient population.

Training and retaining mental health professionals: The Romanian experience in 
the European Union.

Davila" University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Bucharest, Romania.

University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Timisoara, Romania.

BACKGROUND: Romania has been a member of the European Union since 2007. 
According to the World Health Organization, the national burden of mental 
disorders is high, with 2743.69 disability-adjusted life years per 100.000 
population. Moreover, in a country of 19 million people, Romania's mental health 
system is currently functioning at capacity, with 5.66 adult 
psychiatrists/100.000 population and only 0.56 child and adolescent psychiatry 
(CAP) doctors per 100.000 population.
METHOD: we conducted a simple narrative review of the current literature on the 
topic of training of psychiatry trainees in Romania.
RESULTS: Undergraduate training consists of only 4 weeks of clinical and 
theoretical work for adult and CAP. Psychiatry postgraduate training lasts 5 
years and is still duration-oriented. Psychiatric trainees mostly spend their 
clinical work in inpatient units due to the scarcity of other services or the 
lack of integration of training programs in the existing psychiatric services. 
Theoretical training is not nationally formalized, and, during training, yearly 
assessments tend to be neglected. An ongoing challenge in Romania has been 
retaining young career psychiatrists.
CONCLUSION: Although in a trend toward improvement of health services, "brain 
drain" has been and continues to be a massive phenomenon among Romanian 
psychiatrists, mainly driven to Western-European countries due to financial 
reasons, various shortcomings in overall infrastructure, and because of the lack 
of continuous professional and personal development opportunities. As the world 
is currently facing an unprecedented mental health crisis, steps must be taken 
to improve psychiatric training, retain psychiatrists in Romania, and provide 
better national mental health services.

Developing safe and effective strategies to deliver biomolecules such as 
oligonucleotides and proteins into cells has grown in importance over recent 
years, with an increasing demand for non-viral methods that enable clinical 
translation. Here, we investigate uniquely configured oligo-urethane 
nanoparticles based on synthetic chemistries that minimize the release of 
pro-inflammatory biomarkers from immune cells, show low cytotoxicity in a broad 
range of cells, and efficiently deliver oligonucleotides and proteins into 
mammalian cells. The mechanism of cell uptake for the self-assembled 
oligo-urethane nanoparticles was shown to be directed by caveolae-dependent 
endocytosis in murine myoblasts (C2C12) cells. Inhibiting caveolae functions 
with genistein and methyl-β-cyclodextrin limited nanoparticle internalization. 
The nanoparticles showed a very high delivery efficiency for the genetic 
material (a 47-base oligonucleotide) (∼80% incorporation into cells) as well as 
the purified protein (full length firefly luciferase, 67 kDa) into human 
embryonic kidney (HEK293T) cells. Luciferase enzyme activity in HEK293T cells 
demonstrated that intact and functional proteins could be delivered and showed a 
significant extension of activity retention up to 24 h, well beyond the 2 h 
half-life of the free enzyme. This study introduces a novel self-assembled 
oligo-urethane nanoparticle delivery platform with very low associated 
production costs, enabled by their scalable chemistry (the benchwork cost is $ 
0.152/mg vs $ 974.6/mg for typical lipid carriers) that has potential to deliver 
both oligonucleotides and proteins for biomedical purposes.

OBJECTIVE: Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) prevalence has substantially 
increased over the years, leading to increased direct medical costs. The aim of 
the present study was to assess the long-term cost of HIV care in Greece 
incurred over the last decade.
METHODS: In order to assess the long-term cost of HIV care, a cost analysis was 
undertaken for three discrete time points (which reflect major changes in the 
HIV treatment paradigm), incorporating the evolution of the cost of 
pharmaceuticals, hospitalization, primary care visits and diagnostic tests. The 
cost per life year gained (LYG) was also estimated.
RESULTS: Total cost of HIV care increased by 57% over the last decade (€53.7 
million in 2010 vs €84.5 million in 2019), which can be mainly attributed to a 
107% (5084 in 2010 vs. 10,523 in 2019) increase observed in the number of people 
living with HIV (PLWH) under care. As a result, the cost per person on treatment 
has decreased by 24.0% (€10,567 in 2010 vs €8032 in 2019). Lifetime cost was 
lower and life expectancy higher in 2019 compared to 2010, leading to a - €711 
cost per LYG, suggesting that the current treatment paradigm produces better 
health outcomes at a lower cost compared to a decade ago, implying that 
resources are used in a more efficient way.
CONCLUSION: The paper presents some evidence towards the direction that HIV 
management in Greece can be considered efficient in both clinical and financial 
terms, as it offers measurable clinical outcomes at well-controlled, almost 
inelastic spending.

Explicit treatment of electronic polarizability in empirical force fields (FFs) 
represents an extension over a traditional additive or pairwise FF and provides 
a more realistic model of the variations in electronic structure in condensed 
phase, macromolecular simulations. To facilitate utilization of the polarizable 
FF based on the classical Drude oscillator model, Drude Prepper has been 
developed in CHARMM-GUI. Drude Prepper ingests additive CHARMM protein 
structures file (PSF) and pre-equilibrated coordinates in CHARMM, PDB, or NAMD 
format, from which the molecular components of the system are identified. These 
include all residues and patches connecting those residues along with water, 
ions, and other solute molecules. This information is then used to construct the 
Drude FF-based PSF using molecular generation capabilities in CHARMM, followed 
by minimization and equilibration. In addition, inputs are generated for 
molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using CHARMM, GROMACS, NAMD, and OpenMM. 
Validation of the Drude Prepper protocol and inputs is performed through 
conversion and MD simulations of various heterogeneous systems that include 
proteins, nucleic acids, lipids, polysaccharides, and atomic ions using the 
aforementioned simulation packages. Stable simulations are obtained in all 
studied systems, including 5 μs simulation of ubiquitin, verifying the integrity 
of the generated Drude PSFs. In addition, the ability of the Drude FF to model 
variations in electronic structure is shown through dipole moment analysis in 
selected systems. The capabilities and availability of Drude Prepper in 
CHARMM-GUI is anticipated to greatly facilitate the application of the Drude FF 
to a range of condensed phase, macromolecular systems.

    Psychooncology. 2021 Dec;30(12):2032-2038.

OBJECTIVES: People with severe mental illness (SMI) are at extreme risk of being 
stigmatized and to receive poor quality physical care. It has been demonstrated 
that they have higher morbidity and poorer prognosis of several medical diseases 
than the general population, with an at least 10-20-year reduction in life 
expectancy.
METHODS: A special issue of Psycho-Oncology focusing on cancer care among 
patients affected by SMI was called by the Editorial Board of the journal, with 
the aim to explore cancer health disparities and inequalities among people with 
SMI, mortality from cancer, problems of communication between multidisciplinary 
oncology and psychiatric teams and need for more structured intervention (i.e., 
screening, prevention, treatment).
RESULTS: Authors from eight countries contributed. The problem of stigma and 
barriers to cancer care provision for patients with SMI were studied (e.g., the 
complex nature of SMI and healthcare providers' misunderstanding of SMI). Key 
barriers were related to both patients, clinicians and institutional problems, 
such as fragmentation of care. A higher mortality from cancer and poor knowledge 
about cancer risk-factors was shown in patients with SMI. Models of intervention 
were also proposed.
CONCLUSIONS: Several conclusions have been recommended by the authors, such as 
the need for guidelines and clinical procedures specific for cancer care in 
mental health settings; large-scale studies to address the disparities of care 
in people with SMI; a larger vision of psychosocial oncology as the facilitator 
of the liaison between oncology and psychiatry.

Healthcare staff across varied clinical settings are faced with varied stressors 
that can lead to compassion fatigue. However, there is currently no review 
examining the phenomenon in-depth in the burn unit. Thus, in the current study, 
the authors sought to scope existing studies to ascertain the prevalence, 
contributing factors, and effects of compassion fatigue in the burn unit. 
Compassion fatigue was conceptualized as comprising of burnout (BO) and 
secondary traumatic stress. Arksey and O'Malley's scoping review approach was 
used and reported according to the preferred reporting items for systematic 
reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) extension guidelines. Searches were 
undertaken across peer-reviewed databases and gray literature sources for 
quantitative studies. Following the search and screening process, nine studies 
were retained. Codes were formulated across studies following which narrative 
synthesis was undertaken. The majority of the studies (n = 5) focused on burn 
care nurses. High levels of emotional exhaustion and depersonalization and 
comparatively low levels of personal achievement were reported among burn care 
staff which is indicative of BO. Compassion fatigue was also observed to be high 
among burn care staff. Contributing factors are varied, albeit some variables 
such as age, staffing levels, remuneration, nature of the work environment, and 
number of years worked were consistent across some studies. In conclusion, 
working in the burn unit is challenging with significant stressors that can lead 
to BO, traumatic stress, and subsequently, compassion fatigue. Interventions to 
promote resilience, hardiness, optimal working environment, peer, and 
psychosocial support are greatly needed.

Candida albicans is the leading cause of life-threatening bloodstream 
candidiasis, especially among immunocompromised patients. The reversible 
morphological transition from yeast to hyphal filaments in response to host 
environmental cues facilitates C. albicans tissue invasion, immune evasion, and 
dissemination. Hence, it is widely considered that filamentation represents one 
of the major virulence properties in C. albicans. We have previously 
characterized Ppg1, a PP2A-type protein phosphatase that controls filament 
extension and virulence in C. albicans. This study conducted RNA sequencing 
analysis of samples obtained from C. albicans wild type and ppg1Δ/Δ strains 
grown under filament-inducing conditions. Overall, ppg1Δ/Δ strain showed 1448 
upregulated and 710 downregulated genes, representing approximately one-third of 
the entire annotated C. albicans genome. Transcriptomic analysis identified 
significant downregulation of well-characterized genes linked to filamentation 
and virulence, such as ALS3, HWP1, ECE1, and RBT1. Expression analysis showed 
that essential genes involved in C. albicans central carbon metabolisms, 
including GDH3, GPD1, GPD2, RHR2, INO1, AAH1, and MET14 were among the top 
upregulated genes. Subsequent metabolomics analysis of C. albicans ppg1Δ/Δ 
strain revealed a negative enrichment of metabolites with carboxylic acid 
substituents and a positive enrichment of metabolites with pyranose 
substituents. Altogether, Ppg1 in vitro analysis revealed a link between 
metabolites substituents and filament formation controlled by a phosphatase to 
regulate morphogenesis and virulence.

AIM: The aim of this study was to analyze changes in the incidence, management 
and mortality of DFU in Sicilian Type 2 diabetic patients hospitalized between 
two eras, i.e. 2008-2013 and 2014-2019.
METHODS: We compared the two eras, era1: 2008-13, era2: 2014-19. In era 1, n = 
149, and in era 2, n = 181 patients were retrospectively enrolled.
RESULTS: In the population hospitalized for DFU in 2008-2013, 59.1% of males and 
40.9% of females died, whilst in 2014-2019 65.9% of males and 34.1% of females 
died. Moderate chronic kidney disease (CKD) was significantly higher in patients 
that had died than in ones that were alive (33% vs. 43%, p < 0.001), just as CKD 
was severe (14.5% vs. 4%, p < 0.001). Considering all together the risk factors 
associated with mortality, at Cox regression multivariate analysis only 
moderate-severe CKD (OR 1.61, 95% CI 1.07-2.42, p 0.021), age of onset greater 
than 69 years (OR 2.01, 95% CI 1.37-2.95, p <0.001) and eGFR less than 92 ml/min 
(OR 2.84, 95% CI 1.51-5.34, p 0.001) were independently associated with risk of 
death.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with DFU have high mortality and reduced life expectancy. 
Age at onset of diabetic foot ulcer, eGFR values and CKD are the principal risk 
factors for mortality.

Forkhead box O3 (FOXO3) is a candidate longevity gene. Urban residents are also 
positively associated with longer life expectancy. We conducted a 
gene-environment interaction to assess the synergistic effect of FOXO3 and 
urban/rural environments on mortality. We included 3 085 older adults from the 
Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey. We used single-nucleotide 
polymorphisms (SNPs) rs2253310, rs2802292, and rs4946936 to identify the FOXO3 
gene and classified residential locations as "urban" and "rural." Given the open 
cohort design, we used the Cox-proportional hazard regression models to assess 
the mortality risk. We found the minor allele homozygotes of FOXO3 to have a 
protective effect on mortality (HR [95% CI] for rs4946936 TT vs CC: 0.807 
[0.653-0.996]; rs2802292 GG vs TT: 0.812 [0.67-0.985]; rs2253310 CC vs GG: 0.808 
[0.667-0.978]). Participants living in urban areas had a lower risk of mortality 
(HR of the urban vs the rural: 0.854 [0.759-0.962]). The interaction between 
FOXO3 and urban and rural regions was statistically significant (pinteraction < 
.01). Higher air pollution (fine particulate matter: PM2.5) and lower 
residential greenness (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index [NDVI]) both 
contributed to higher mortality. After adjusting for NDVI and PM2.5, the 
protective effect size of FOXO3 SNPs was slightly attenuated while the 
protective effect size of living in an urban environment increased. The effect 
size of the beneficial effect of FOXO3 on mortality is roughly equivalent to 
that of living in urban areas. Our research findings indicate that the effect of 
places of residence and genetic predisposition of longevity are intertwined.

An HLA-matched relative is the first-choice donor for patients with Philadelphia 
chromosome (Ph)-negative acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in first complete 
remission (CR1). The most promising alternative donor is thought to be an 
HLA-matched unrelated donor (MUD) in patients who do not have an HLA-matched 
related donor. Cord blood transplantation (CBT) is an alternative option. Higher 
rates of engraftment failure and nonrelapse mortality (NRM) are significant 
problems, but the ready availability of cord blood can be an advantage, because 
patients can immediately undergo transplantation before progression. This study 
was conducted to identify an appropriate alternative donor in patients with 
Ph-negative ALL in CR1 who do not have an HLA-matched related donor (MRD). 
Decision analyses using a Markov model were performed to compare immediate CBT, 
in which CBT was performed at 1 month after the achievement of CR1, with 
elective unrelated bone marrow transplantation (uBMT) from an 8/8 MUD (8/8 uBMT) 
or uBMT from a 7/8 MUD (7/8 uBMT), in which uBMT was performed at 4 months, in 
patients age 16 to 55 years with Ph-negative ALL in CR1 who did not have an MRD. 
We constructed a decision tree. The cycle length was set at 3 months, and 
analyses were performed for 19 cycles for uBMT and 20 cycles for CBT, resulting 
in evaluation of the 5-year life expectancy after both decisions. Transition 
probabilities (TPs) and utilities were estimated from prospective and 
retrospective Japanese studies and the registry database of Japan. Subgroup 
analyses were performed according to risk stratification based on WBC count and 
cytogenetics at diagnosis and according to age stratification, with a cutoff of 
25 years. One-way sensitivity analyses for TPs and utilities were performed as 
well. The baseline analyses showed that 8/8 uBMT or 7/8 uBMT had superior 
results to CBT, with quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) of 2.86 in 8/8 uBMT, 
2.84 in 7/8 uBMT, and 2.75 in CBT. One-way sensitivity analyses showed that the 
results of the baseline analyses were reversed if the probability of NRM in CBT 
improved. Subgroup analyses showed similar results in younger, older, and 
high-risk patients. However, QALY was worse in 8/8 uBMT compared with CBT in 
standard-risk patients. In one-way sensitivity analyses, the probabilities of 
NRM in uBMT and CBT affected the baseline results in all analyses except for 
comparisons between 8/8 uBMT and CBT in younger and high-risk patients. In these 
2 populations, the superiority of 8/8 uBMT was consistently demonstrated 
throughout the one-way sensitivity analyses. For patients with Ph-negative ALL 
in CR1 who decide to undergo transplantation from an alternative donor, elective 
uBMT from either an 8/8 MUD or a 7/8 MUD is expected to yield a better outcome 
than immediate CBT. Nonetheless, CBT is a viable option, and improvements to 
reduce the risk of NRM in CBT may change these results.

OBJECTIVES: The technological advancement in the field of orthopedics has 
initiated better healthcare service that equates to the need of 
cost-effectiveness approach. We propose a model for estimating the simultaneous 
effect of health and cost involved in an orthopedic surgery implants by using 
seemingly unrelated regression equations models.
METHODS: The simultaneous equations represent a relationship between the health 
status of a group of individuals and their expenditures related to the cost of 
surgical procedure/treatment undertaken in an orthopedic department of a 
hospital. We define model specification, estimation, and statistical tests in 
simultaneous equation models. This is further used to estimate the utility 
function that indeed helps in the computation of quality-adjusted life-year 
(QALY) values.
RESULTS: Using the seemingly unrelated regression equation models for the 
seasonal data in 2018 and 2019, we have obtained the seasonal QALY values. 
Furthermore, the measurement of seasonal changes in QALY values is done by using 
a method of simple averages.
CONCLUSIONS: We analyze the health conditions in orthopedics by the formation of 
health and expenditure relationship for the inpatients and outpatients 
undertaking a treatment. A framework has been setup for computing quality of 
life-year values by including the direct and the indirect costs. The 
patient-reported outcome measures are also useful in detecting the change in 
disease states and important difference in minimal clinical changes that further 
adds value to the computation of quality of life.

Like most of the world, low- and middle-income countries have faced a growing 
demand for new health technologies and higher budget constraints. It is 
necessary to have technical instruments to make decisions based on real-world 
evidence that allows maximization of the population's health with a limited 
budget. We estimated the supply-based cost-effectiveness elasticity, which was 
then used to determine the cost-effectiveness threshold for the healthcare 
system of Colombia, a middle-income country where multiple insurers, paid under 
capitation rules, manage the compulsory contributions of the citizens and 
government subsidies. Using administrative data, we explored the variation of 
health expenditures and outcomes at the insurer, geographical region, diagnosis 
group and year levels. To deal with endogeneity in a two-way fixed-effects 
model, we instrumented health expenditures using characteristics of the health 
system such as drug-price regulation. We estimated the threshold to be US$4487.5 
per years of life lost avoided [14.7 million Colombian pesos (COP) at 2019 
prices] and US$5180.8 per quality-adjusted life-years gained (17 million COP at 
2019 prices), around one times the gross domestic product GDP per capita. To the 
best of our knowledge, this is the first estimation of the cost-effectiveness 
threshold elasticity supply-based in a middle-income country with a managed 
healthcare system.

Aims: With increasing life expectancy and ageing population, more octogenarians 
would benefit from total knee arthroplasty (TKA). The aim of this study is to 
evaluate the survivorship of TKA in octogenarian and their long-term outcomes. 
Methods: This was a retrospective review of 67 patients aged above 80 years who 
had primary TKA performed between 2005 and 2013 at a single centre. A 
sex-matched younger cohort of 67 primary TKAs during the same time-period was 
recruited for control. Five and 10-year survival was calculated. Pre- and 
peri-operative factors were collected and compared. Post-operative range of 
motion, Knee Society Score (KSS) and Function Score (KFS) were collected and 
compared. Rate of revision, infection, aseptic loosening and mortality was 
collected. Results: The mean follow-up period was 10.39 ± 2.29 years. The 5- and 
10-year survival of octogenarian group was 85.1% and 54.6%, respectively. Pre- 
and peri-operative factors between the octogenarian and control groups were 
comparable (p > 0.05). Both groups showed improvement in range of motion, KSS 
and KFS post-operatively. Rate of revision, aseptic loosening and deep infection 
was 0% in octogenarian and 1.5% in control group. Conclusion: TKA can be 
performed in patients with age above 80 years old with comparable post-op knee 
range, complication rate and long-term functional score. Advanced age should not 
be a limiting factor for TKA.

BACKGROUND: Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) has long been used for treating 
individuals with treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Esketamine has recently 
emerged as a new treatment for TRD due to its rapid antidepressant effects. To 
further inform the decision regarding choice of treatment, this paper aims to 
evaluate whether ECT or esketamine is the more cost-effective option.
METHODS: The cost-effectiveness was derived as cost per quality-adjusted 
life-year (QALY) using a Markov model from a societal and life-time perspective. 
The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated. Health states 
included different depression and remission states and death. Data to populate 
the model was derived from randomised controlled trials and other research. 
Various sensitivity analyses were carried out to test the robustness of the 
model.
RESULTS: The base case scenario shows that ECT is cost-effective compared to 
esketamine and yields more QALYs at a lower cost. The sensitivity analysis shows 
that ECT is cost-effective in all scenarios and ECT dominates esketamine in 12 
scenarios.
CONCLUSIONS: This study found that, from a cost-effectiveness point of view, ECT 
should be the first-hand option for individuals with TRD, when other first line 
treatments have failed. Considering the lack of economic evaluation of ECT and 
esketamine, this study is of great value to decision makers.

PURPOSE: The Norwegian Survey of Health and Ageing (NORSE) was set up to provide 
internationally comparable data on ageing in Norway, which includes measured 
intrinsic capacity and cognitive function.
PARTICIPANTS: NORSE is a population-based health examination study of seniors 
aged 60+ from the 1921-1958 birth cohorts in the former Norwegian county of 
Oppland, interviewed and examined during 2017-19 (N = 957, 16% response rate). 
NORSE is to some extent based on the SHARE-questionnaire ( share-project.org ), 
which includes work-related information, self-assessed and retrospective health, 
and expectations on longevity, quality of life, volunteering activities, 
consumption, and financial arrangements. In addition, several objective measures 
of intrinsic and cognitive capacity are included in NORSE.
FINDINGS TO DATE: A shorter preferred life expectancy (PLE) was found to be 
associated with the prospects of a life with dementia and chronic pain. 
Motivation for retirement was found to be related to work-life experience and 
health. Social media was mostly used in the younger age groups and there was a 
tendency towards more use in the higher educational groups. NORSE incorporates 
questions on religion, and older women tend to have a higher degree of 
religiosity (proxied as self-assessed religiosity) than men in their 80s, but 
more similar (and lower levels) among those in their 60s.
FUTURE PLANS: NORSE participants have allowed their data to be linked to 
National registry data and midlife health examination studies and thereby 
provide a longitudinal design as well as information on disability status, 
socioeconomic status, household and marital status, support to/from children and 
parents, and pension status.

INTRODUCTION: Adherence to medications for cardiovascular disease and its risk 
factors is less than optimal, although greater adherence to medication has been 
shown to reduce the risk factors for cardiovascular disease. This paper examines 
the economics of tailored pharmacy interventions to improve medication adherence 
for cardiovascular disease prevention and management.
METHODS: Literature from inception of databases to May 2019 was searched, 
yielding 29 studies for cardiovascular disease prevention and 9 studies for 
cardiovascular disease management. Analyses were done from June 2019 through May 
2020. All monetary values are in 2019 U.S. dollars.
RESULTS: The median intervention cost per patient per year was $246 for 
cardiovascular disease prevention and $292 for cardiovascular disease 
management. The median change in healthcare cost per person per year due to the 
intervention was -$355 for cardiovascular disease prevention and -$2,430 for 
cardiovascular disease management. The median total cost per person per year was 
-$89 for cardiovascular disease prevention, with a median return on investment 
of 0.01. The median total cost per person per year for cardiovascular disease 
management was -$1,080, with a median return on investment of 7.52, and 6 of 7 
estimates indicating reduced healthcare cost averted exceeded intervention cost. 
For cardiovascular disease prevention, the median cost per quality-adjusted life 
year gained was $11,298. There were no cost effectiveness studies for 
cardiovascular disease management.
DISCUSSION: The evidence shows that tailored pharmacy-based interventions to 
improve medication adherence are cost effective for cardiovascular disease 
prevention. For cardiovascular disease management, healthcare cost averted 
exceeds the cost of implementation for a favorable return on investment from a 
healthcare systems perspective.
