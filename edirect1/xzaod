BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In a previous randomized trial we showed that the 
short-course radiotherapy (RT) regimen of 8 Gy x 2 was feasible in patients with 
metastatic spinal cord compression (MSCC) and short life expectancy. This phase 
III trial was planned to determine whether in the same category of patients 8 Gy 
single-dose is as effective as 8 Gy x 2.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three hundred and twenty-seven patients with MSCC and 
short life expectancy were randomly assigned to a short-course of 8 Gy x 2 or to 
8 Gy single-dose RT. Median follow-up was 31 months (range, 4-58).
RESULTS: A total of 303 (93%) patients are assessable, 150 treated with the 
short-course and 153 with the single-dose RT. No difference in response was 
found between the two RT schedules adopted. Median duration of response was 5 
and 4.5 months for short-course and single-dose RT (p=0.4), respectively. The 
median overall survival was 4 months for all cases. Light acute toxicity was 
registered in a minority of cases. Late toxicity was never recorded.
CONCLUSIONS: Both RT schedules adopted were effective. As already shown in 
several trials evaluating RT regimens in uncomplicated painful bone metastases, 
also MSCC patients may achieve palliation with minimal toxicity and 
inconvenience with a single-dose of 8 Gy.

The Brazilian Amazon is globally important for biodiversity, climate, and 
geochemical cycles, but is also among the least developed regions in Brazil. 
Economic development is often pursued through forest conversion for cattle 
ranching and agriculture, mediated by logging. However, on the basis of an 
assessment of 286 municipalities in different stages of deforestation, we found 
a boom-and-bust pattern in levels of human development across the deforestation 
frontier. Relative standards of living, literacy, and life expectancy increase 
as deforestation begins but then decline as the frontier evolves, so that pre- 
and postfrontier levels of human development are similarly low. New financial 
incentives and policies are creating opportunities for a more sustained 
development trajectory that is not based on the depletion of nature and 
ecosystem services.

OBJECTIVES: Intradialytic hypotension may adversely affect the outcome of 
chronic hemodialysis and thus reduce the patients' life expectancy. The aim of 
this study was to assess the link between left-ventricular diastolic dysfunction 
and dialytic hypotension.
METHODS: We performed a prospective cross-sectional study of 72 hemodialysis 
patients with a low dialysis vintage, 36 of whom had dialysis hypotension, based 
on echocardiography and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) assay.
RESULTS: There was no difference between normotensive patients and those with 
dialysis-associated chronic hypotension as regards BNP level, cardiac index, 
left-ventricular ejection fraction, or myocardial fractional shortening. Both 
hypotension-prone patients requiring dialysate sodium profiling and chronic 
refractory hypotensive patients requiring macromolecule infusion had cardiac 
diastolic dysfunction as shown by a similarly abnormal E/A ratio <1 in 89-91% of 
cases, associated with a significant decrease in color M-mode diastolic flow 
propagation velocity (V(p), p < 0.05 nonparametric ANOVA). The area under the 
ROC curve for V(p) was 0.69. A V(p) cutoff of 39.5 cm/s was optimal for 
predicting dialysis-associated hypotension.
CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that diastolic dysfunction is associated with dialytic 
hypotension and that a low V(p)--a preload-independent index--is predictive of 
dialysis-associated hypotension.

BACKGROUND: Malignant melanoma is a disease with an increasing rate of 
incidence, currently at 10 cases per 100,000. In most cases, malignant melanoma 
metastasizes over the lymph vessels to parenchymal organs. Symptomatic 
metastases are found in the gastrointestinal tract in only about 2% of the 
patients.
CASE REPORT: A 43-year-old patient with a known metastasized malignant melanoma 
(brain, liver, bones) was admitted to the department of dermatology due to 
fatigue, headache and unspecified abdominal symptoms. Because of persistent 
abdominal symptoms, a computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen was 
performed, showing a perforation of the ileum with an abscess on the basis of 
multiple small-bowel metastases. A segmental small-bowel resection with primary 
anastomosis was performed. The postoperative course of the patient was 
complicated by a subcutaneous wound infection and a prolonged period of 
convalescence (due to multiple brain metastases).
CONCLUSIONS: Novel therapy concepts and medication in the treatment of patients 
with malignant melanoma have improved life expectancy. These patients are 
therefore expected to suffer more frequently from complications of the primary 
disease. Interdisciplinary management and cooperation is required to adequately 
diagnose and handle such cases.

Neither regional nor systemic chemotherapy significantly improve survival in the 
majority of patients presenting with liver metastases and their median survival 
is short. While the incidence of hepatocellular (HCC) is increasingly worldwide, 
the various treatment approaches that hve been developed to treat non-resectable 
HCC have had minimal or moderate impact on overall survival. SIR-Spheres (SIRS) 
are commercially available (90)Y-labelled resin microspheres that when 
selectively injected via the hepatic artery will become trapped in the tumor 
caplliary bed and will selectively deliver radiation to the tumor whilst sparing 
normal tissue. In this manuscript, the available literature on the use of SIRS 
in the clinic is summarized. First, available, predominantly phase I and II 
studies, on SIRS treatment performed in patients suffering from liver metastases 
as well as in patients suffering from multinodular asymptomatic unresectable HCC 
with a well preserved liver function have consistently reported a favourable 
safety profile for SIRS therapy; only a limited number of patients develop 
gastrointestinal ulceration or bleeding. Second, most of the studies also 
reported a high reponse rate to SIRS treatment resulting in increased life 
expectancy; median survival rates proved consistently higher when compared to 
historical controls. Finally, in two randomized controlled phase III trials, 
benefits were demonstrated for SIRS combined with chemotherapy when compared to 
the chemo-arm alone in patients suffering from colorectal liver metastasis. 
However, since these reports, novel, potentially more effective 
chemotherapeutics have been introduced for treating colorectal liver metastasis 
and the clinical value of (90)Y-Sirspheres when compared to these novel 
chemotherapeutics warrants confirmation and validation.

AIMS: To determine the frequency and the predictive factors of colectomy and 
restorative colo-proctectomy in patients with ulcerative colitis.
METHODS: We conducted an 11-year retrospective study based on hospitalized 
ulcerative colitis patients followed up for more than 6 months.
RESULTS: From 1995 to 2005, 115 patients were included (50 men, 65 women, mean 
age: 38.4 years). Mean duration of follow-up was 39.2 months (6 - 145). 
Colectomy was performed in 20 patients (17%), with an actuarial risk of 16% at 5 
years and 35% at 10 years. Proctocolectomy with ileoanal anastomosis was 
performed in 16 cases and total colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis in 4 
cases. In univariate analysis, factors associated with an increased risk of 
colectomy were pancolitic location (p = 02), acute severe colitis (p < 0.0001), 
treatment by intravenous corticosteroids (p < 0.0001) and intravenous 
cyclosporine (p = 0.001). In multivariate analysis, acute severe colitis was the 
only independent factor associated with colectomy (p = 0.04 OR [CI 95%] :6.66 
[1.04 - 50]). In patients with distal location, the independent factor 
associated with colectomy was colonic extension during follow up (p = 0.04 OR 
[CI 95%] :7.69 [1.07 - 50]). In patients with pancolitic location, risk of 
colectomy was associated with acute severe colitis (p = 0.01 OR [CI 95%] :9.09 
[1.58 - 50]) and years of hospitalization from 1995 to 1999 (p = 0.02 OR [CI 
95%] :7.14 [1.35 - 44]).
CONCLUSION: Although the diffusion of treatment by intravenous cyclosporin, 
surgery is frequently performed in our ulcerative colitis patients, specially in 
case of acute severe colitis. Evaluation of colonic extension during the 
follow-up is associated with an important prognostic impact.

BACKGROUND: Antipsychotic medication is the cornerstone of schizophrenia 
treatment. The impact of long-term exposure to antipsychotics on life-expectancy 
has recently received some attention, partly because awareness is increasing of 
the differential mortality of people with schizophrenia and the general 
population.
METHODS: A systematic review of studies assessing the association between 
antipsychotic exposure and mortality in persons with schizophrenia was 
undertaken.
RESULTS: In total, 12 studies met the inclusion criteria. Three out of five 
studies examining antipsychotic dosage and higher mortality showed a significant 
association for one or more antipsychotics. Two out of four found negative 
effects of antipsychotic polypharmacy on life-expectancy. Some studies found a 
lower cardiovascular mortality risk with higher treatment intensity or when 
comparing current versus past or non-use of antipsychotics. Others established a 
stable correlation between antipsychotic exposure and an increase in 
cardiovascular mortality. Evidence for differential effects on mortality in 
favor of second generation (SGA) compared to first generation antipsychotics was 
inconsistent. No study of SGA drugs had a sufficient follow-up time. A major 
confounding factor may be a higher risk factor load for somatic disorders in the 
most severely mentally ill.
CONCLUSION: There is some evidence that long-term exposure to antipsychotics 
increases mortality in schizophrenia. More rigorously designed, prospective 
studies are urgently needed.

Misdemeanor policing, physical disorder, and gun-related homicide: a spatial 
analytic test of "broken-windows" theory.

York City, NY 10029, USA. mcerda@nyam.org

BACKGROUND: Homicide contributes substantially to the burden of death in the US 
and remains a key contributor to the gap in white-black life expectancy. It has 
been hypothesized that "broken-windows" policing is associated with lower 
homicide rates and that physical disorder may mediate this association. However, 
the empiric evidence is limited and conflicting.
METHODS: We used pooled, cross-sectional time-series data for 74 New York City 
(NYC) Police Precincts between 1990 and 1999 to test the relation between 
neighborhood misdemeanor policing (an indicator of physical order) and homicide 
in NYC in the 1990s. We applied Bayesian hierarchical models, including a random 
effect of place, to account for serial correlations in homicide across adjacent 
neighborhoods.
RESULTS: An increase of 5000 misdemeanor arrests in a precinct with 100,000 
people was associated with a reduction of 3.5 homicides (95% credible interval = 
-5.00 to -1.00). However, increased misdemeanor arrests were associated with 
lower physical order (posterior median = -0.015 [-0.025 to -0.01]), and physical 
order was unrelated to homicide.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study replicated prior findings suggesting that misdemeanor 
policing reduces homicide rates, but offered no support for the hypothesis that 
physical disorder is a mediator of the impact of such policing. Factors 
responsible for the dramatic decline in US homicides in the last decade remain 
unclear.

Author information:
(1)Departments of Ophthalmology, The New York Eye and Ear Infirmary, 310 East 
14th Street, New York, NY 10003, USA.

PURPOSE: To evaluate the effectiveness and associated complications of Baerveldt 
glaucoma implant (BGI) surgery with pars plana tube insertion in aphakic and 
pseudophakic children.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: The medical records of 30 patients (30 eyes) younger than 
18 years old with uncontrolled glaucoma associated with aphakia or pseudophakia 
who underwent pars plana BGI surgery were retrospectively reviewed. Clinical 
outcome assessment included the measurement of intraocular pressure (IOP) and 
visual acuity and the identification of complications. Success was defined as 5 
mm Hg<final postoperative IOP < or =21 mm Hg with or without glaucoma 
medications and without visually devastating complications or further glaucoma 
surgery. Outcomes were evaluated using Kaplan-Meier life-table analysis.
RESULTS: Mean follow-up after BGI surgery was 29.8+/-26.4 months. Twelve, 24, 
and 36-month life-table rates for successful IOP control were 85%, 81%, and 72%, 
respectively. Six of 30 patients were considered failures. Complications 
included hypotony (5 patients, with 1 developing hemorrhagic choroidals which 
required surgical intervention and a second progressing to phthisis), retinal 
detachment (4 patients), tube obstruction (2 patients), pupillary membrane (1 
patient), worsening esotropia (1 patient), focal scleral ectasia (1 patient), 
and loss of light perception (1 patient). Visually devastating complications 
were observed in 3 patients (hemorrhagic choroidals 1 patient, phthisis 1 
patient, loss of light perception 1 patient).
CONCLUSIONS: BGI surgery with pars plana tube insertion is a reasonable option 
for managing aphakic and pseudophakic children with uncontrolled glaucoma. 
Complications of BGI surgery related to anterior chamber tube placement, such as 
tube-cornea touch, are minimized with this approach. The incidence of posterior 
segment complications, although possibly higher compared with limbal tube 
insertion, was not excessive.

University of the Negev, Beer-Sheva.

Life expectancy for persons with Down syndrome has increased over the past 100 
years and today ranges around 60 years of age. Improvement in health care and 
especially a change toward a more positive attitude toward this population has 
resulted in this trend. This study was conducted to learn the trend of the 
population of persons with Down syndrome in residential care in Israel.
METHODS: An annual questionnaire sent to the medical clinics in all residential 
care centers for the 1998-2006 period was analyzed to study the trend of the 
number of persons with Down syndrome.
RESULTS: This survey revealed that the population has been relatively stable 
over the years with around 500 to 600 persons or about 9% of the total 
population in residential care. In 2006, a decrease was observed with a total of 
529 persons or 7.73% of the total residential care population.
CONCLUSIONS: The annual questionnaire did not provide details about the Down 
syndrome population besides its numbers, and we therefore recommend further 
study of this population in more detail to learn how to keep this population 
healthy with a good quality of life.

AIM: To perform a systematic review on the costs and cost-effectiveness of 
concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide with radiotherapy for the treatment of 
newly diagnosed glioblastoma compared with initial radiotherapy alone.
METHODS: Electronic databases were searched for relevant publications on costs 
and cost-effectiveness until October 2008.
RESULTS: We found four relevant clinical trials, one cost study and two economic 
models. The mean survival benefit in the radiotherapy plus temozolomide group 
varied between 0.21 and 0.25 life-years. Treatment costs were between 27,365 
euros and 39,092 euros. The costs of temozolomide amounted to approximately 40% 
of the total treatment costs. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios found in 
the literature were 37,361 euros per life-year gained and 42,912 euros per 
quality-adjusted life-year gained. However, the models are not comparable 
because different outcomes are used (i.e., life-years and quality-adjusted 
life-years).
CONCLUSION: Although the models are not comparable according to outcome, the 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratios found are within acceptable ranges. We 
concluded that despite the high temozolomide acquisition costs, the costs per 
life-year gained and the costs per quality-adjusted life-year gained are 
comparable with other accepted first-line treatments with chemotherapy in 
patients with cancer.

Healthy-years equivalent: wounded but not yet dead.

NC 27709-2194, USA. abhauber@rti.org

The quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) has become the dominant measure of health 
value in health technology assessment in recent decades despite some well-known 
and fundamental flaws in the preference-elicitation methods used to construct 
health-state utility weights and the strong assumptions required to construct 
QALYs as a measure of health value using these utility weights. The 
healthy-years equivalent (HYE) was proposed as an alternative measure of health 
value that was purported to overcome many of the limitations of the QALY. The 
primary argument against the HYE is that it is difficult to estimate and, 
therefore, impractical. After much debate in the literature, the QALY appears to 
have won the battle; however, the HYE is not yet dead. Empirical research and 
recent advances in methods continue to offer evidence of the feasibility using 
the HYE as a measure of health value and also addresses some of criticisms 
surrounding the preference-elicitation methods used to estimate the HYE. This 
article provides a brief review of empirical applications of the HYE and 
identifies recent advances in empirical estimation that may breathe new life 
into a valiant, but wounded, measure.

Combined effect of an oxygen absorber and oregano essential oil on shelf life 
extension of rainbow trout fillets stored at 4 degrees C.

In the present study the combined effect of an O2 absorber and oregano essential 
oil (0.4% v/w) on shelf life extension of rainbow trout fillets (Onchorynchus 
mykiss) stored under refrigeration (4 degrees C) was investigated. The study was 
based on microbiological [TVC, Pseudomonas spp., Lactic Acid Bacteria, 
H2S-producing bacteria including Shewanella putrefaciens, Enterobacteriaceae and 
Clostridium spp.), physicochemical (pH, PV, TBA, TVBN and Drip loss) and sensory 
(odor, taste) changes occurring in the product as a function of treatment and 
storage time. Aerobically-packaged rainbow trout fillets stored at 4 degrees C 
were taken as control samples. Results showed that TVC exceeded 7 log cfu/g on 
day 4 of storage for control samples, day 7-8 for samples containing oregano 
oil, day 9 for samples containing the O2 absorber and day 12-13 for samples 
containing the O2 absorber and oregano oil. Pseudomonas spp., Enterobacteriaceae 
and LAB were only partially inhibited by the O2 absorber and/or the oregano oil. 
In all cases the inhibition effect was more pronounced when the combination of 
O2 absorber with oregano essential oil was used. pH decreased from an initial 
value of 6.65-6.09 and subsequently increased to 6.86 due to formation of 
protein decomposition products. % Drip loss ranged between 7% and 11-12% at the 
end of the product shelf life. PV values ranged between 11.4 and 27.0 meq O2/kg 
oil while malondialdehyde (MDA) ranged between 9.6 and 24.5 mg/kg. TVBN ranged 
between 10.6 and 54.6 mg/kg at the time of sensory rejection. Sensory shelf life 
was 4 days for the control samples, 7-8 days for samples containing oregano oil, 
13-14 days for samples containing the O2 absorber and 17 days for samples 
containing the O2 absorber plus oregano oil.

The utilization of sub-lethal decontamination treatments gains more and more 
interest due to the increased consumers' demand for fresh, minimally processed 
and convenient food products. These products rely on cold chain and hurdle 
(combination) technology to provide microbiological safety and quality during 
their shelf life. To investigate the ability of surviving cells to resuscitate 
and grow in a food simulating environment, sub-lethal decontamination treatments 
were coupled with subsequent storage under sub-optimal growth conditions. For 
this purpose chlorine dioxide (ClO2) and neutralized electrolyzed oxidizing 
water (NEW)-treated cultures of Escherichia coli O157:H7 were inoculated in 
TSB-YE of pH 5.8 and aw 0.99, and stored at 10 degrees C, 12.5 degrees C and 15 
degrees C, under four different atmospheres (0%, 30% and 60% CO2 balanced with 
N2, and air). Due to the severity of injury, lactic acid-treated cells were 
inoculated in TSB-YE pH 7.0. Data obtained reveal that the fraction of 
sub-lethally injured E. coli O157:H7 undergoes an additional inhibitory effect 
during the storage period under of sub-optimal conditions. Observed extension in 
the lag growth phase was a direct consequence prior sub-lethal injury. The 
effects of liquid ClO2 and NEW were less pronounced in comparison to lactic 
acid. The current study signifies the potential utilization of appropriate 
combination of different extrinsic and intrinsic factors in the elimination or 
growth inhibition of food-borne pathogens.

The aftershock of deindustrialization--trends in mortality in Scotland and other 
parts of post-industrial Europe.

BACKGROUND: Post-industrial decline is frequently cited as one of the major 
underlying reasons behind the poor health profile of Scotland and, especially, 
West Central Scotland (WCS). This begs the question: to what extent is poor 
health a common outcome in other post-industrial regions and how does Scotland's 
experience compare to these other comparable regions?
METHODS: Regions were identified by means of an expert-based consultation, 
backed up by analysis of regional industrial employment loss over the past 30 
years. Mortality rates and related statistics were calculated from data obtained 
from national and regional statistical agencies.
RESULTS: Twenty candidate regions (in: Belgium; France; Germany; Netherlands; 
UK; Poland; Czech Republic) were identified, of which ten were selected for 
in-depth analyses. WCS mortality rates are generally higher and-crucially-appear 
to be improving at a slower rate than in the other post-industrial regions. This 
relatively poor rate of improvement is largely driven by mortality among the 
younger working age (especially male) and middle-aged female populations.
CONCLUSION: WCS mortality trends compare badly with other, similar, 
post-industrial regions of Europe, including regions in Eastern Europe which 
tend to be characterized by higher levels of poverty. This finding challenges 
any simplistic explanation of WCS's poor health being caused by post-industrial 
decline alone, and begs the question as to what other factors may be at work.

[Social capital and health in Latin America and the Caribbean: a systematic 
review].

[Article in Spanish]

Santiago, Chile.

OBJECTIVE: To identify validated information available on the relationship 
between social capital (SC) and health in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC).
METHODS: A systematic search for papers published from January 1990-June 2007 
was conducted on the Medline, SciELO, LILACS, and the Cochrane Library 
databases. All of the research and review articles published by scientific 
journals that evaluated CS and its relationship to health in LAC were included 
in the analysis.
RESULTS: Fifteen articles were found (11 original research and 4 reviews). The 
health topics examined by the research articles were: (a) mortality and life 
expectancy, (b) mental health, (c) injuries, (d) nutritional status, and (e) 
immunization. The validity of these works, the results, and the principal 
conclusions were analyzed in depth.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite limitations inherent to the CS concept and the studies 
identified, it was confirmed that scientific evidence exists to support the 
possible association between CS and health in LAC. CS could play a protective 
role in certain health areas, such as injury prevention and mental health; not 
withstanding, the relationship between CS and health could vary according to CS 
subtype and socioeconomic context and culture. It is therefore imperative to 
continue social epidemiology research that thoroughly investigates the 
relationship between social determinants and specific aspects of health in LAC 
context.

Life expectancy has increased during recent decades leading to a growing number 
of older population. The objective of this study was to evaluate the outcomes of 
coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in octogenarians and to compare the 
outcomes of the emergent CABG with elective surgery. Prospectively collected 
data from 31 consecutive octogenarian patients who underwent CABG between 1 
January 2006 and 31 December 2008 were analyzed. Main outcomes of interest 
included mortality, length of ICU stay, length of hospital stay, priority of 
surgery, postoperative complications and functional status on follow-up. Fifteen 
patients were operated on an urgent basis. Patients operated on an urgent basis 
were in NYHA class III or IV preoperatively (P=0.0016). There were no 
significant differences in operative and postoperative variables. There were 
three in-hospital deaths and 23 patients (82%) were alive on follow-up and 19 
were in functional class I or II. Quality of life assessment was performed using 
Seattle Angina Questionnaire and patients reported remarkable improvement in 
quality of life. Overall, 90% patients were not or slightly disabled in their 
daily activity. Satisfaction with their current quality of life was reported by 
95% of patients. CABG may be performed in octogenarians with remarkable outcomes 
and improvement in quality of life.

The addition of sachets or pads containing volatile antimicrobial agents into 
packages has been the most successful commercial application of antimicrobials 
to packaging. In this study, the effect of oregano (Origanum onites) essential 
oil on the extension of shelf life of overwrap packed fresh chicken drumsticks 
was investigated. Meat exudate absorbent pads were sprayed with 5 mL of oregano 
essential oil at a concentration of 1.5% in distillate water. Sampling was 
carried out at 0, 3, 5, and 7 d of the refrigerated storage. Total viable count, 
psychrotrophs, pseudomonads, members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, yeasts, 
and lactic acid bacteria were enumerated. Physicochemical analysis and sensorial 
evaluation were also conducted. The shelf life of fresh chicken drumsticks was 
approximately 3 d. Oregano essential oil extended product shelf life by 
approximately 2 d. Thus, incorporation of essential oils to absorbent pads may 
have supplementary applications in food packaging.

Cost-effectiveness of intensive lipid lowering therapy with 80 mg of 
atorvastatin, versus 10 mg of atorvastatin, for secondary prevention of 
cardiovascular disease in Canada.

BACKGROUND: The TNT study compared high dose atorvastatin (80 mg) versus 
moderate atorvastatin (10 mg) treatment in 10,001 patients with stable coronary 
heart disease (CHD), over 4.9 years. Intensive lipid-lowering with atorvastatin 
(80 mg) reduced major cardiovascular events by 22%.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the cost-effectiveness of intensive lipid-lowering versus 
moderate lipid lowering treatment from the perspective of the Canadian 
Ministries of Health.
METHODS: A lifetime Markov model was developed to predict cardiovascular (CV) 
events, costs, survival, and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) for CHD 
patients receiving 80 mg versus 10 mg of atorvastatin. Predictions were also 
made for 10- and 5-year horizons. Treatment-specific event risks were used until 
five years. Beyond year five, equivalent CV risks were assumed for all patients. 
Medical-care costs and post-event survival were estimated using Canadian data. 
Health utility scores were obtained from published studies. Benefits and costs 
were discounted 5% annually. Probabilistic and deterministic sensitivity 
analyses were performed.
RESULTS: Treatment with atorvastatin (80 mg) over a lifetime horizon resulted in 
increased costs (Can$16,542 vs. Can$15,365), survival (10.12 vs. 10.03 life 
years), and QALYs (7.71 vs. 7.61) per patient compared with atorvastatin (10 
mg), yielding an incremental cost-effectiveness of Can$12,946 per life year 
gained and Can$11,969 per QALY. The incremental cost per QALY remained below 
Can$50,000 in 98.1% of 1000 simulations. Results were robust to variations in 
event hazard ratios, costs, health utility values, and discount rate.
CONCLUSION: Intensive atorvastatin (80 mg) treatment is predicted to be 
cost-effective versus atorvastatin (10 mg) for CHD patients in Canada.

Improving the outcome in malignant pleural mesothelioma: nonaggressive or 
aggressive approach?

Stahel RA(1), Weder W.

Zürich CH 8091, Switzerland. rolf.stahel@usz.ch

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The treatment of malignant pleural mesothelioma continues to 
be a clinical challenge. The question, however, is no longer whether to provide 
active treatment or not, but how aggressive the treatment should be in view of 
the limited life expectancy of patients with this disease.
RECENT FINDINGS: With platin and pemetrexed-based combination chemotherapy 
having become the preferred systemic therapy, the major questions now evolve 
around the identification of a suitable second line therapy and the quest for 
innovative new approaches. Surgical interventions from pleurectomy and 
decortication to extrapleural pneumonectomy have increasingly come of use in 
specialized centres. With neoadjuvant chemotherapy and extrapleural 
pneumonectomy median survival times of almost 2 years have been reported. 
Studies on high-dose hemithoracic radiotherapy after extrapleural pneumonectomy 
suggested a beneficial effect on local recurrence. However, both extrapleural 
pneumonectomy and high-dose hemithoracic radiotherapy are associated with 
potential treatment-related mortality and morbidity and cannot yet be 
recommended outside specialized centres.
SUMMARY: More than ever, the diagnosis and treatment of patients with malignant 
pleural mesothelioma mandate a multidisciplinary approach.

Author information:
(1)Institute of Public Health, Georgia State University, Urban Life Building, 
Room 857, 140 Decatur Street, Atlanta, GA 30302-3995, USA. rrothenberg@gsu.edu

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Over the past several years, one segment of the complex field 
of HIV transmission dynamics - heterosexual networks - has dominated theoretical 
and empirical investigation. This review provides an overview of recent work on 
HIV risks and networks, with a focus on recent findings in heterosexual network 
dynamics.
RECENT FINDINGS: Qualitative (ethnographic) assessments have demonstrated the 
heterogeneity and complexity of heterosexual connections, particularly in 
Africa, where tradition, official polygamy, and unofficial multiperson 
arrangements have lead to concurrency of sexual partnerships. A large, 
quantitative study on Likoma Island, Malawi, demonstrated the considerable, 
interlocking sexual connections that arise from a high-concurrency sexual 
setting, even with a low average number of partnerships (low degree) of long 
duration. Such settings, as suggested by ethnographic studies, may be common in 
Africa and, coupled with newer information about transmissibility during acute 
and early infection, may provide a plausible explanation for endemic 
transmission and possibly for rapid HIV propagation.
SUMMARY: Recognition of high-concurrency, low-degree networks is an important 
development for understanding HIV transmission dynamics. Their relevance to 
heterosexual transmission, and possible extension to other epidemiologic 
settings, reinforces the heterogeneity and complexity of HIV transmission 
dynamics.

Avulsion of the hamstring muscle group: a follow-up of 6 adult non-athletes with 
early operative treatment: a brief report.

BACKGROUND: Complete proximal avulsions of the hamstring muscle group may cause 
significant morbidity and loss of function. These pelvis-near musculoskeletal 
injuries are mostly acquired during sports activities in a hip flexion and knee 
extension. Here we present a study group of 6 middle-aged to elderly patients 
suffering a complete proximal hamstring avulsion and following early surgical 
refixation. Early surgical refixation leads to complete resumption of the 
activities of daily life without loss of function.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The 6 patients (3 men and 3 women) included in this study 
had an average age of 59.07 +/- 4.47 years at the time of injury. All of them 
suffered a complete avulsion of the hamstring muscle group. Surgical refixation 
was accomplished with the corkscrew anchor refixation system (Arthrex 
Manufacturing, Inc., Naples, FL). The cases were retrospectively analyzed using 
a hip joint evaluation system, the Harris Hip Score, and radiological follow-up 
by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Data are given as mean +/- SEM. Student's 
t-test was used for normal distribution of the data.
RESULTS: The mean follow-up time was 31.83 +/- 18.9 months (range: 10-118 
months). All patients were rated not to have a significant difference in 
function compared with the uninjured side. None of the patients suffered any 
handicaps resulting from surgery or the injury. A complete consolidation in all 
patients was observed in the follow-up MRI.
CONCLUSIONS: Early surgical intervention and subsequent therapy in a complete 
hamstring avulsion injury may prevent loss of hip-joint stability and prevent 
the sequelae of degradative hip or vertebral events.

The minimum averaged mean squared error nonparametric adaptive weights use data 
from m possibly different populations to infer about one population of interest. 
The definition of these weights is based on the properties of the empirical 
distribution function. We use the Kaplan-Meier estimate to let the weights 
accommodate right-censored data and use them to define the weighted Kaplan-Meier 
estimate. The proposed estimate is smoother than the usual Kaplan-Meier estimate 
and converges uniformly in probability to the target distribution. Simulations 
show that the performances of the weighted Kaplan-Meier estimate on finite 
samples exceed that of the usual Kaplan-Meier estimate. A case study is also 
presented.

Declining longevity advantage and low birthweight in Okinawa.

Hokama T(1), Binns C.

Author information:

Nishihara, Okinawa, Japan 903-0215. b987390@med.u-ryukyu.ac.jp

The prefecture of Okinawa is known for the longevity of its population, for 30 
years it had the longest life expectancy of all prefectures in Japan. However 
this advantage was lost in 2000 and male longevity is now ranked 26th among the 
47 prefectures of Japan. The aim of this study was to explore whether the recent 
decline in Okinawan life expectancy advantage is due to the cohort effect of low 
birthweight infants becoming middle- and older- aged Okinawans. This is an 
observational study using existing demographic and health statistics. Data on 
life expectancy, mortality and low birthweight rates were obtained from the 
Okinawan Prefectural Department of Health and Welfare and the Japanese Ministry 
of Health, Labour and Welfare. In the year 2000 the longevity advantage of 
Okinawan males over the Japanese mainland was lost and the relative life 
expectancy of females declines. The mortality ratio for heart disease has 
reversed showing a cohort effect, with younger Okinawans having higher death 
rates than those living in the rest of Japan. The low birthweight rate for 
Okinawa is 20% greater than mainland Japan. As the post World War cohort of low 
birthweight infants reaches middle age, the longevity advantage of Okinawans has 
been lost. The loss of the longevity advantage of Okinawa over the rest of Japan 
may be due to the increase in non-communicable disease in the post war cohort 
that has experienced a higher low birthweight rate.

Mortality in East Asian countries in the pre-war period: a quasi-experimental 
study on healthy immigrant effects.

2-3-6, Minami, Wako-shi, Saitama 351-0197 Japan. atoz@niph.go.jp

Life tables of East Asian countries in the prewar period (1926-30) provide a 
rare quasi-experimental study on immigration. Age and sex-specific mortality of 
four East Asian countries/regions namely Japan, Korea, Taiwan and Kwanton 
province of China in the prewar period (1926-30) were drawn from life tables and 
vital statistics of that time. Mortality curves of these countries/regions were 
compared to illustrate healthy immigrant effects and racial disposition. 
Expatriate Japanese men of working age (20-35) had a slightly lower age-specific 
mortality than indigenous Japanese, suggesting a healthy migrant effect. Also, 
"humps" in the mortality curves around twenty years of age due to tuberculosis 
were observed in expatriate Japanese in all three foreign countries/ regions but 
not in local residents. Mild healthy immigrant effects were observed in 
expatriate Japanese men of working age. Susceptibility to tuberculosis was 
attributable to racial disposition rather than to environmental factors.

Author information:
(1)Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care, and Sleep Medicine, University of 
Mississippi School of Medicine, USA. mbowling@medicine.umsmed.edu

BACKGROUND: Pleural fluid pH anaerobically handled and measured by a blood gas 
analyzer (BGA) is used to define a pleural space infection as complicated and 
predict the life expectancy of patients with malignant pleural effusions. 
Pleural fluid pH can also be measured by other less accurate methods. It is 
unknown whether physicians who use pleural fluid pH measurements are aware of 
the method used by their laboratories.
METHODS: We surveyed 90 pulmonary physicians in North Carolina about their use 
of pleural fluid pH and their hospital laboratory's approach (pH indicator 
stick, pH meter, or BGA). We then contacted their hospital laboratories to 
determine the actual method of pH measurement.
RESULTS: Twenty-eight (31%) pulmonologists in 11 North Carolina hospitals 
responded on their use of pleural fluid pH. Of the 20 pulmonologists who order 
pleural fluid pH, 90% reported that their hospital measures pleural fluid pH via 
BGA, but the majority (72%) were inaccurate. Only two of 11 hospitals reported 
that they measure pleural fluid pH with a BGA.
CONCLUSION: Almost two-thirds of the chest physicians that order pleural fluid 
pH to help manage pleural effusions were using information that is not 
substantiated by the literature and, despite previous reports, hospitals still 
use suboptimal methods to measure pleural fluid pH. Further information is 
needed concerning the barriers to physicians and laboratory practices concerning 
the use of BGA for the measurement of pleural fluid pH.
