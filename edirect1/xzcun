PURPOSE: Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) represent a critical metric in 
economic evaluations impacting key healthcare decisions in many countries. 
However, there is widespread disagreement as to which is the best of the health 
state utility (HSU) instruments that are designed to measure the Q in the QALY. 
Instruments differ in their descriptive systems as well as their valuation 
methodologies; that is, they simply measure different things. We propose a 
visual framework that can be utilized to make meaningful comparisons across HSU 
instruments.
METHODS: The framework expands on existing HRQoL models, by incorporating four 
distinctive continua, and by putting HRQoL within the broader notion of 
subjective well-being (SWB). Using this conceptual map, we locate the five most 
widely used HSU-instruments (EQ-5D, SF-6D, HUI, 15D, AQoL).
RESULTS: By individually mapping dimensions onto this visual framework, we 
provide a clear picture of the significant conceptual and operational 
differences between instruments. Moreover, the conceptual map demonstrates the 
varying extent to which each instrument moves outside the traditional biomedical 
focus of physical health, to also incorporate indicators of mental health and 
social well-being.
CONCLUSION: Our visual comparison provides useful insights to assess the 
suitability of different instruments for particular purposes. Following on from 
this comparative analyses, we extract some important lessons for a new 
instrument that cover the domains of physical, mental and social aspects of 
health, i.e. it is in alignment with the seminal 1948 WHO definition of health.

The past several decades have witnessed growing geographic disparities in life 
expectancy within the United States, yet the mortality experience of U.S. cities 
has received little attention. We examine changes in men's life expectancy at 
birth for the 25 largest U.S. cities from 1990 to 2015, using mortality data 
with city of residence identifiers. We reveal remarkable increases in life 
expectancy for several U.S. cities. Men's life expectancy increased by 13.7 
years in San Francisco and Washington, DC, and by 11.8 years in New York between 
1990 and 2015, during which overall U.S. life expectancy increased by just 4.8 
years. A significant fraction of gains in the top-performing cities relative to 
the U.S. average is explained by reductions in HIV/AIDS and homicide during the 
1990s and 2000s. Although black men tended to see larger life expectancy gains 
than white men in most cities, changes in socioeconomic and racial population 
composition also contributed to these trends.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of population-based abdominal aortic 
aneurysm (AAA) screening in Estonia.
METHODS: A Markov cohort model was used to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of 
population-based AAA screening compared with no screening. A hypothetical cohort 
of 6000 men aged 65 was followed for 35 years. Data for disease transition 
probabilities and quality of life outcomes were obtained from published 
literature; costs were calculated based on Estonian data. Analysis followed the 
healthcare payer's perspective using an annual discount rate of 5% for costs and 
effects. The model evaluated the number of avoidable AAA ruptures and 
AAA-related deaths and the differences in costs and quality-adjusted life-years 
(QALYs).
RESULTS: The AAA screening would have prevented 10 AAA ruptures and 6 
AAA-related deaths among the cohort of 6000 men, resulting in 23 QALYs gained 
(0.000378 QALYs per individual). The additional cost of the screening and 
treatment was €39 429 (€65.4 per individual) with the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio for screening compared with no screening being €17 303 
per QALY gained. Although results were sensitive to assumptions regarding 
health-related quality of life and the models' time horizon, screening was found 
to be cost-effective with a 99% probability at a willingness-to-pay threshold of 
€30 000 per QALY.
CONCLUSION: Population-based AAA screening of elderly men is likely to be a 
cost-effective measure in reducing the AAA-related disease burden. Given the 
increase in the overall costs, the actual policy decisions regarding 
implementing an AAA screening program in Estonia are likely to be influenced by 
availability of resources as well.

BACKGROUND: Since 2010, the rate of improvement in life expectancy in the UK has 
slowed. We aimed to put this trend in the context of changes over the long term 
and in relation to a group of other high-income countries.
METHODS: We compared sex-specific trends in life expectancy since 1970 and 
age-specific mortality in England and Wales with median values for 22 
high-income countries (in western Europe, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Japan, 
and the USA). We used annual mortality data (1970-2016) from the Human Mortality 
Database.
FINDINGS: Until 2011-16, male life expectancy in England and Wales followed the 
median life expectancy of the comparator group. By contrast, female life 
expectancy was below the median and is among the lowest of the countries 
considered. In 2011-16, the rate of improvement in life expectancy slowed 
sharply for both sexes in England and Wales, and slowed more moderately in the 
comparator group because of negative trends in all adult age groups. This 
deceleration resulted in a widening gap between England and Wales and the 
comparators from 2011 onwards. Since the mid-2000s, for the first time, 
mortality rates in England and Wales among people aged 25-50 years were 
appreciably higher than in the comparator group.
INTERPRETATION: Although many countries have seen slower increases in life 
expectancy since 2011, trends in England and Wales are among the worst. The poor 
performance of female life expectancy over the long-term is in part driven by 
the relative timing of the smoking epidemic across countries. The previously 
overlooked higher mortality among young working-age adults in England and Wales 
relative to other countries deserves urgent attention.

BACKGROUND: Many countries have shown marked declines in diarrhoeal disease 
mortality among children younger than 5 years. With this analysis, we provide 
updated results on diarrhoeal disease mortality among children younger than 5 
years from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2017 
(GBD 2017) and use the study's comparative risk assessment to quantify trends 
and effects of risk factors, interventions, and broader sociodemographic 
development on mortality changes in 195 countries and territories from 1990 to 
2017.
METHODS: This analysis for GBD 2017 had three main components. Diarrhoea 
mortality was modelled using vital registration data, demographic surveillance 
data, and verbal autopsy data in a predictive, Bayesian, ensemble modelling 
tool; and the attribution of risk factors and interventions for diarrhoea were 
modelled in a counterfactual framework that combines modelled population-level 
prevalence of the exposure to each risk or intervention with the relative risk 
of diarrhoea given exposure to that factor. We assessed the relative and 
absolute change in diarrhoea mortality rate between 1990 and 2017, and used the 
change in risk factor exposure and sociodemographic status to explain 
differences in the trends of diarrhoea mortality among children younger than 5 
years.
FINDINGS: Diarrhoea was responsible for an estimated 533 768 deaths (95% 
uncertainty interval 477 162-593 145) among children younger than 5 years 
globally in 2017, a rate of 78·4 deaths (70·1-87·1) per 100 000 children. The 
diarrhoea mortality rate ranged between countries by over 685 deaths per 100 000 
children. Diarrhoea mortality per 100 000 globally decreased by 69·6% 
(63·1-74·6) between 1990 and 2017. Among the risk factors considered in this 
study, those responsible for the largest declines in the diarrhoea mortality 
rate were reduction in exposure to unsafe sanitation (13·3% decrease, 
11·2-15·5), childhood wasting (9·9% decrease, 9·6-10·2), and low use of oral 
rehydration solution (6·9% decrease, 4·8-8·4).
INTERPRETATION: Diarrhoea mortality has declined substantially since 1990, 
although there are variations by country. Improvements in sociodemographic 
indicators might explain some of these trends, but changes in exposure to risk 
factors-particularly unsafe sanitation, childhood growth failure, and low use of 
oral rehydration solution-appear to be related to the relative and absolute 
rates of decline in diarrhoea mortality. Although the most effective 
interventions might vary by country or region, identifying and scaling up the 
interventions aimed at preventing and protecting against diarrhoea that have 
already reduced diarrhoea mortality could further avert many thousands of deaths 
due to this illness.

Despite the numerous social and economic benefits of vaccination, adult 
immunization rates fall far short of recommended levels costing the United 
States $9 billion annually in health care expenditures and reduced productivity. 
While it is well recognized that childhood immunization is highly 
cost-effective, the economic impact of adult immunization programs varies by 
disease and is influenced by population demographics. This study aimed to assess 
the cost-effectiveness of a comprehensive adult immunization program serving 
high-need populations delivered by a local health department (LHD) in 
partnership with community organizations. We modeled incremental 
cost-effectiveness taking the payer perspective of each vaccine separately in 
simulated cohorts of 100,000 over a 20-year horizon using data provided by the 
LHD and data from the published literature. We adjusted the results to align 
with actual program delivery and used them to estimate an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for the entire program. We assessed the effects 
of varying our base model parameters in univariate sensitivity analyses. We 
discounted benefits and life years saved (LYS) at 3% and adjusted results to 
2016 US$. Four of seven disease models were cost-effective (using a $100,000 CE 
threshold) with ICERS ranging from $14,260 to $79,022/LYS. Sensitivity analyses 
did not substantially impact the results. The ICER for program as a whole was 
$67,940/LYS. A community-delivered comprehensive immunization program serving 
uninsured, low income, high-risk adults is a cost-effective investment even when 
most do not receive the full regimen of some vaccines.

Distributional cost effectiveness analysis is a new method that can help to 
redesign prevention programmes by explicitly modelling the distribution of 
health opportunity costs as well as the distribution of health benefits. 
Previously we modelled cardiovascular disease (CVD) screening audit data from 
Liverpool, UK to see if the city could redesign its cardiovascular screening 
programme to enhance its cost effectiveness and equity. Building on this 
previous analysis, we explicitly examined the distribution of health opportunity 
costs and we looked at new redesign options co-designed with stakeholders. We 
simulated four plausible scenarios: a) no CVD screening, b) 'current' basic 
universal CVD screening as currently implemented, c) enhanced universal CVD 
screening with 'increased' population-wide delivery, and d) 'universal plus 
targeted' with top-up delivery to the most deprived fifth. We also compared 
assumptions around whether displaced health spend would come from programmes 
that might benefit the poor more and how much health these programmes would 
generate. The main outcomes were net health benefit and change in the slope 
index of inequality (SII) in QALYs per 100,000 person years. 'Universal plus 
targeted' dominated 'increased' and 'current' and also reduced health inequality 
by -0.65 QALYs per 100,000 person years. Results are highly sensitive to 
assumptions about opportunity costs and, in particular, whether funding comes 
from health care or local government budgets. By analysing who loses as well as 
who gains from expenditure decisions, distributional cost effectiveness analysis 
can help decision makers to redesign prevention programmes in ways that improve 
health and reduce health inequality.

Mucopolysaccharidosis type I-Hurler (MPS1-H) is the most severe form of 
inherited metabolic diseases caused by mutations in the IDUA gene. The resulting 
deficiency of alpha L-iduronidase enzyme leads to a progressive accumulation of 
glycosaminoglycans in lysosomes which damages multiple organs and highly reduces 
life expectancy of affected children. Skin fibroblasts of a 2-year-old MPS1-H 
male, carrying two mutations in each IDUA alleles (H358_T364del; W402X), were 
reprogrammed into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) using the CytoTune-iPS 
Sendai Reprogramming method applying Yamanaka-factors (OCT4, SOX2, KLF4, c-MYC). 
iPSCs expressed pluripotency transcription factors while iPSC-derived embryoid 
bodies reveal markers of the three germ layers.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The economic assessment of immuno-oncology agents in 
Chinese patients is limited despite a need for new therapies. Nivolumab is the 
first immune checkpoint inhibitor approved for the second-line treatment of 
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in China, and it significantly prolongs 
overall survival. However, considering the high cost of nivolumab, it is urgent 
to assess its value in China in terms of both efficacy and cost. The objective 
of this study was to investigate the cost-effectiveness of nivolumab vs 
docetaxel in the second-line setting for NSCLC patients from the Chinese 
healthcare system perspective.
METHODS: A Markov model consisting of three health states, was designed to 
evaluate the lifetime cost and effectiveness of nivolumab vs docetaxel in the 
second-line treatment of NSCLC patients. Clinical data was derived from the 
CheckMate 078 phase III clinical trial, which included 504 patients 
predominantly from China. Parametric survival models to fit and extrapolate 
survival data were chosen based on clinical rationality, visual fit and 
statistical goodness-of-fit. Lifetime costs and health outcomes were calculated, 
and US$28,899 and $63,564 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) were selected as 
the willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold values for general regions and affluent 
regions, respectively. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were 
undertaken to explore the robustness of the model. Additional subgroup analyses 
were performed.
RESULTS: In base case analysis, Nivolumab yielded an additional 0.24 QALYs, at a 
cost of $93,307 per QALY. Sensitivity analyses suggested that the results to be 
most sensitive to the price of nivolumab per kg (mean $60.00; range 
$26.00-$60.00) and the mean patient weight (65 kg, range 52-78 kg). Utility 
values in progression-free survival state (mean 0.804; range 0.643-0.965) and 
overall survival hazard ratio (0.68; 97.7% CI 0.52-0.90) had moderate impact on 
the model results. Subgroup analyses indicated that nivolumab was most 
cost-effective for patients who were 65 years of age or older ($85,171/QALY), 
followed by female patients ($85,273/QALY) and patients with tumor PD-L1 
expression at least 1% ($90,309/QALY).
CONCLUSIONS: Nivolumab is unlikely to be cost-effective compared with docetaxel 
for patients with previously treated advanced NSCLC in China. Ensuring that 
nivolumab is included in the National Reimbursement Drug List (NRDL) may be a 
valid mean of meeting extensive treatment demands in China.

BACKGROUND: Existing studies conclude SLE predicts decision-making in the 
future. This paper studied how contacts with children influence subjective life 
expectancy (SLE) of the mid-age and elderly in China. We also investigated the 
moderation effect of living arrangement preference (LAP). A better understanding 
of impact factors that contribute to the mid-age and elderly's thoughts about 
their lifetime is essential for the late-career financial planning and health 
interventions.
METHODS: Our study examines the relationship between co- and non-residential 
children and SLE by using two waves of data from China Health and Retirement 
Longitudinal Study (CHARLS).
RESULTS: Our findings suggest that contacts with children help older people 
construct positive SLE. However, with an increased number of non-residential 
children, older people will become pessimistic about their SLE. When older 
people prefer living alone, it decreases the impact of the number of 
non-residential children on SLE.
CONCLUSION: Our results encourage children to live with their parents and 
contact their parents from time to time. Interventions that change their ideas 
about living arrangement preference may actually be useful for mid-age and 
elderly. The best living arrangement should take the living arrangement 
preference of older people into consideration and give them the best arrangement 
according to their preference.

The Islamic revolution of 1979 in Iran emphasized social justice as a pillar for 
development. The fundamental steps towards universal equitable access to 
high-quality healthcare services began with the creation of the Ministry of 
Health and Medical Education (MoHME) and the nationwide establishment of primary 
healthcare (PHC) network in 1985. Now, in the 40th anniversary of the Islamic 
revolution, the history of health system development in Iran is characterized by 
constant policy changes; i.e. structural and procedural transformations. Ever 
since and despite the imposed 8-year war with Iraq and continuous unfair 
sanctions against the country, noticeable progress has been achieved in the 
health system that has led to better population health including among others: 
self-sufficiency in training health workforce; advances in public health and 
medical sciences; establishment and expansion of health facilities within the 
hard-to-reach areas aiming to enhance equity in access to needed healthcare 
services; domestic production of most medicines and medical equipment; and 
meaningful expansion of health insurance coverage. These have led to admirable 
improvement in public health indicators; i.e. maternal mortality, child 
mortality, life expectancy, and vaccination coverage. Despite achievements, 
there still remain challenges in health financing, protecting the public against 
high expenditure of medical care, establishment of referral system and 
rationalization of service utilization, provision of high quality healthcare 
services to all in need, and conflict of interest in health policy making, all 
of which may hinder the goal to reach "universal health coverage", identified as 
the main goal of the health system in Iran by 2025. Recently, the MoHME began 
structural and functional reforms to boost societal efforts and enhance 
intersectoral collaboration to address social determinants of health, improve 
actions for prevention and control of non-communicable diseases and other social 
health problems. Drawing upon the World Health Organization (WHO)'s "six 
building blocks" model, this article presents an analytical description of the 
main health policy reforms during the last four decades after the Islamic 
revolution in Iran, divided by each decade. Learning from the historical reforms 
will create, we envisage, a better understanding of health system developments, 
its advances and challenges, which might in turn contribute to better 
evidence-informed policy making and sustainable health development in the 
country, and perhaps beyond.

Mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I) is a lysosomal storage disease caused by a 
deficiency of the lysosomal hydrolase, α-L-iduronidase (IDUA). IDUA degrades 
heparan and dermatan sulfates, two types of glycosaminoglycan (GAG), important 
signalling and structural molecules of the extracellular matrix. Because many 
cell types store GAGs, MPS I has been investigated in human and animal models. 
Enzyme replacement therapy is available for MPS I patients and has improved 
their life expectancy, allowing them to achieve reproductive age. The aim of 
this study was to evaluate epididymal and sperm morphology and function in a 
murine model of MPS I. We used C57BL Idua+/+ and Idua-/- adult male mice (6 
months old) to investigate epididymal morphology, sperm ultrastructure, GAG 
characterisation and mating competence. Epithelial GAG storage, especially in 
the cauda epididymidis, was seen in Idua-/- mice. Regardless of the morphologic 
change and GAG storage found in the cauda epididymis, sperm morphology and 
motility were normal, similar to wild types. In the interstitium, vacuolated 
cells were found in addition to deposits of GAGs. Mating was not impaired in 
Idua-/- males and litter sizes were similar between groups. At the time point of 
the disease evaluated, the deficiency in IDUA affected the morphology of the 
epididymis in male Idua-/- mice, whereas sperm appearance and motility and the 
male's capacity to mate and impregnate females were preserved.

BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study is to evaluate which factors will affect 
range of motion (ROM) and function in partial radial head fractures. The 
hypothesis is that conservative treatment yields better outcomes.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective comparative cohort study included 43 
adult volunteers with partial radial head fracture, a minimum 1-year follow up, 
separated into a surgical and non-surgical group. Risk factors were: associated 
injury, heterotopic ossification, worker's compensation, and proximal radio 
ulnar joint (PRUJ) implication. Outcomes included radiographic ROM measurement, 
demographic data, and quality of life questionnaires (PREE, Q-DASH, MEPS).
RESULTS: Mean follow up was 3.5 years (1-7 years). Thirty patients (70%) had 
associated injuries with decreased elbow extension (-11°, p=0.004) and total ROM 
(-14°, p=0.002) compared to the other group. Heterotopic ossification was 
associated with decreased elbow flexion (-9.00°, p=0.001) and fractures involved 
the PRUJ in 88% of patients. Only worker's compensation was associated with 
worse scores. There was no difference in terms of function and outcome between 
patients treated non-surgically or surgically.
DISCUSSION: We found that associated injuries, worker's compensation and the 
presence of heterotopic ossification were the only factors correlated with a 
worse prognosis in this cohort of patients. Given these results, the authors 
reiterate the importance of being vigilant to associated injuries.
LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: IV, Retrospective study.

The Eukaryotic Promoter Database (EPD), available online at https://epd.epfl.ch, 
provides accurate transcription start site (TSS) information for promoters of 15 
model organisms plus corresponding functional genomics data that can be viewed 
in a genome browser, queried or analyzed via web interfaces, or exported in 
standard formats (FASTA, BED, CSV) for subsequent analysis with other tools. 
Recent work has focused on the improvement of the EPD promoter viewers, which 
use the UCSC Genome Browser as visualization platform. Thousands of 
high-resolution tracks for CAGE, ChIP-seq and similar data have been generated 
and organized into public track hubs. Customized, reproducible promoter views, 
combining EPD-supplied tracks with native UCSC Genome Browser tracks, can be 
accessed from the organism summary pages or from individual promoter entries. 
Moreover, thanks to recent improvements and stabilization of ncRNA gene 
catalogs, we were able to release promoter collections for certain classes of 
ncRNAs from human and mouse. Furthermore, we developed automatic computational 
protocols to assign orphan TSS peaks to downstream genes based on paired-end 
(RAMPAGE) TSS mapping data, which enabled us to add nearly 9000 new entries to 
the human promoter collection. Since our last article in this journal, EPD was 
extended to five more model organisms: rhesus monkey, rat, dog, chicken and 
Plasmodium falciparum.

Patellar tendinopathy (PT) is a leading cause of morbidity in jump-landing 
athletes. Landing mechanics are identified as a factor associated with PT and/or 
patellar tendon abnormality. This study aimed to identify key jump-landing 
variables associated with PT. Thirty-six junior elite basketball players (men 
n = 18, women n = 18) were recruited from a Basketball Australia development 
camp. Three-dimensional (3D) kinematic and ground reaction force (GRF) data 
during a stop-jump task were collected as well as ultrasound scans of the 
patellar tendons and recall history of training load data. Mixed-model factorial 
analyses of variance were used to determine any significant between-group 
differences. Of the 23 participants included for statistical analyses, 11 had 
normal bilateral patellar tendons (controls) and eight reported PT (currently 
symptomatic); however, the four participants categorized as asymptomatic with 
patellar tendon abnormality on diagnostic imaging were excluded from statistical 
analyses due to their small sample size. Athletes with PT displayed a similar 
knee flexion angle at initial foot-ground contact (IC) and hip extension 
strategy during a stop-jump horizontal landing. Despite a similar kinematic 
technique, athletes with PT utilized a strategy of a longer stance duration 
phase from IC to peak force. This strategy did not lead to those athletes with 
PT decreasing their peak vertical GRF nor patellar tendon force during landing 
but enabled these athletes to land with a lower rate of loading (control 59.2 ± 
39.3 vs. PT 29.4 ± 33.7 BW.s-1). Athletes with PT still reported significantly 
reduced training volume (control 4.9 ± 1.8 vs PT 1.8 ± 1.1 sessions/wk; total 
training time/wk control 2.4 ± 1.0 vs PT 1.4 ± 1.1 h/wk).

BACKGROUND: Life expectancy has in the last few years increased and, as a 
consequence, also the number of elderly patients admitted to an Emergency 
Department with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. We wanted to detect any 
difference in term of outcomes and adverse events between two groups of patients 
of different age, in relation to types of treatment and clinical status at 
presentation.
METHODS: We selected and analyzed two groups of patients (group A and group B) 
among 458 retrospectively collected cases admitted to two neurosurgical centers 
with a diagnosis of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage over a 7.5-year period. 
Group A included 46 patients equal or older than 80 years and group B all the 
rest. Data were collected on age, sex, aneurysm location, size, comorbidities, 
clinical condition at presentation and at follow-up.
RESULTS: In group A, 19 patients underwent surgery, 16 were embolized, 7 were 
treated conservatively and 4 died very soon after admission. After a median 
follow-up of 12 months 45.7% of patients had a good outcome, 24% were in poor 
conditions and 21.7% had died. When we compared these results with the youngest 
group, we found some important statistically significant differences. Older 
patients were more prone to have surgical and medical related complications, 
whereas endovascular treatment seemed to be a more sustainable treatment in the 
elderly age group.
CONCLUSIONS: Elderly patients suffering from aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage 
should be considered for treatment despite age, with endovascular embolization 
as the most preferable option. Without the treatment, the natural history can be 
very poor.

We examine how both the welfare regime and health affect retirement trajectories 
in countries with flexible retirement policies using longitudinal methods and 
harmonized panel data from two social-democratic (Sweden and Denmark) and two 
liberal welfare regimes (Chile and the United States). An early retirement 
trajectory, which represents retirement in the early 60s, is the most frequent 
in all countries, although it is less prevalent in liberal than in 
social-democratic regimes. Adverse health conditions are more frequent among 
early retirees in liberal but not in social-democratic regimes. Overall, we do 
not find evidence for an inciting effect of flexible retirement policies on 
working life extension. However, welfare regimes substantially affect late-life 
labor force participation.

The fruitless (fru) gene of Drosophila melanogaster generates two groups of 
protein products, the male-specific FruM proteins and non-sex-specific FruCOM 
proteins. The FruM proteins have a 101 amino acids (a.a.)-long extension at the 
N-terminus which is absent from FruCOM. We suggest that this N-terminal 
extension might confer male-specific roles on FruM interaction partner proteins 
such as Lola, which otherwise operates as a transcription factor common to both 
sexes. FruM-expressing neurons are known to connect with other neurons to form a 
sexually dimorphic circuit for male mating behavior. We propose that FruM 
proteins expressed in two synaptic partners specify, at the transcriptional 
level, signaling pathways through which select pre- and post-synaptic partners 
communicate, and thereby pleiotropic ligand-receptor pairs for cell-cell 
interactions acquire the high specificity for mutual connections between two 
FruM-positive cells. We further discuss the possibility that synaptic 
connections made by FruM-positive neurons are regulated by neural activities, 
which in turn upregulate Fru expression in active cells, resulting in 
feedforward enhancement of courtship activities of the male fly.

Study design: A two center, observational study. Introduction: Patient reported 
outcome (PRO) plays an increasingly important role in the evaluation of novel 
therapies for tumor patients. It has been shown that tumor treating fields 
(TTFields) in combination with standard therapy prolong survival in high-grade 
glioma (hgG) patients. But critics claim that TTFields significantly impacts 
patients' everyday life due to side effects and average daily time on therapy 
(18 h) in a patient population with very limited life expectancy and high 
symptom burden. However, very limited data exist on PRO for TTFields treatment. 
Methods: This two center, observational study describes PRO of 30 hgG patients 
receiving TTFields in combination with chemotherapy. We introduced a 
device-specific questionnaire (DSQ) addressing device-specific restrictions and 
impact on daily live after 2 months of therapy. Additionally following 
questionnaires were used: EORTC (European Organization for Research and 
Treatment of Cancer), QLQ-30 (Quality of life of cancer patients), QLQ BN20 
(Quality of life brain cancer module), QLQ FA13 (Cancer-related fatigue), and 
SSUK-8 (social support). Results: Surveys have been completed by 91% of enrolled 
patients. EORTC QLQ-30 revealed better physical, emotional, and cognitive 
function than social and role function of study cohort. TTFields users reported 
frequently on positive social support and a low level of detrimental 
interactions. Seventy one percent of patients felt affected in daily life due to 
TTFields at least 2-3 times per week up to several times per day while 
maintaining high therapy compliance. Most frequent device-specific restrictions 
were duration of therapy (74%), size (66%), and weight (70%) of the device and 
changing time and bonding of the transducer arrays (66%, mean duration: 43.6 
min). Restrictions on exercise of hobbies/work (63%/61%), body care (71%), and 
sexuality/relationship (64%) were most relevant. Seventy percent would recommend 
TTFields to others and 67% would reuse TTFields treatment again based on their 
current experience. Conclusion: The study shows that although TTFields treatment 
frequently affects everyday life in all aspects, therapy compliance was high and 
67% of patients would reconsider TTFields for themselves. We propose that 
findings of PRO be taken into account for medical consultation about TTFields 
and in future device development to deliver high-value patient-centered care.
