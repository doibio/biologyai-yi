IMPORTANCE: Digital health applications have been shown to be effective in the 
management of chronic diseases with simple treatment targets. The potential 
clinical value of digital health applications in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has 
not been well studied.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether assessing patient-reported outcomes using 
digital health applications could result in disease control for patients with 
RA.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This is a multicenter, open-label randomized 
clinical trial in 22 tertiary hospitals across China. Eligible participants were 
adult patients with RA. Participants were enrolled from November 1, 2018, to May 
28, 2019, with a 12-month follow-up. The statisticians and rheumatologists who 
assessed disease activity were blinded. Investigators and participants were not 
blind to group assignment. Analysis was conducted from October 2020 to May 2022.
INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomly assigned at a 1:1 ratio (block size of 
4) to a smart system of disease management group (SSDM) or a conventional care 
control group. Upon the completion of the 6-month parallel comparison, patients 
in the conventional care control group were instructed to use the SSDM 
application for an extension of 6 months.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was the rate of patients with 
disease activity score in 28 joints using the C-reactive protein (DAS28-CRP) of 
3.2 or less at month 6.
RESULTS: Of 3374 participants screened, 2204 were randomized, and 2197 patients 
with RA (mean [SD] age, 50.5 [12.4] years; 1812 [82.5%] female) were enrolled. 
The study included 1099 participants in the SSDM group and 1098 participants in 
the control group. At month 6, the rate of patients with DAS28-CRP of 3.2 or 
less was 71.0% (780 of 1099 patients) in the SSDM group vs 64.5% (708 of 1098 
patients) in the control group (difference between groups, 6.6%; 95% CI, 2.7% to 
10.4%; P = .001). At month 12, the rate of patients with DAS28-CRP of 3.2 or 
less in the control group increased to a level (77.7%) that was comparable with 
that (78,2%) in the SSDM group (difference between groups, -0.2%; 95% CI, -3.9% 
to 3.4%; P = .90).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this randomized clinical trial of RA, the use of a 
digital health application with patient-reported outcomes was associated with an 
increase in disease control rate.

IMPORTANCE: Studies have suggested that greater primary care physician (PCP) 
availability is associated with better population health and that a diverse 
health workforce can improve care experience measures. However, it is unclear 
whether greater Black representation within the PCP workforce is associated with 
improved health outcomes among Black individuals.
OBJECTIVE: To assess county-level Black PCP workforce representation and its 
association with mortality-related outcomes in the US.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study evaluated the association 
of Black PCP workforce representation with survival outcomes at 3 time points 
(from January 1 to December 31 each in 2009, 2014, and 2019) for US counties. 
County-level representation was defined as the ratio of the proportion of PCPs 
who identifed as Black divided by the proportion of the population who 
identified as Black. Analyses focused on between- and within-county influences 
of Black PCP representation and treated Black PCP representation as a 
time-varying covariate. Analysis of between-county influences examined whether, 
on average, counties with increased Black representation exhibited improved 
survival outcomes. Analysis of within-county influences assessed whether 
counties with higher-than-usual Black PCP representation exhibited enhanced 
survival outcomes during a given year of heightened workforce diversity. Data 
analyses were performed on June 23, 2022.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Using mixed-effects growth models, the impact of 
Black PCP representation on life expectancy and all-cause mortality for Black 
individuals and on mortality rate disparities between Black and White 
individuals was assessed.
RESULTS: A combined sample of 1618 US counties was identified based on whether 
at least 1 Black PCP operated within a county during 1 or more time points 
(2009, 2014, and 2019). Black PCPs operated in 1198 counties in 2009, 1260 
counties in 2014, and 1308 counties in 2019-less than half of all 3142 
Census-defined US counties as of 2014. Between-county influence results 
indicated that greater Black workforce representation was associated with higher 
life expectancy and was inversely associated with all-cause Black mortality and 
mortality rate disparities between Black and White individuals. In adjusted 
mixed-effects growth models, a 10% increase in Black PCP representation was 
associated with a higher life expectancy of 30.61 days (95% CI, 19.13-42.44 
days).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The findings of this cohort study suggest that 
greater Black PCP workforce representation is associated with better population 
health measures for Black individuals, although there was a dearth of US 
counties with at least 1 Black PCP during each study time point. Investments to 
build a more representative PCP workforce nationally may be important for 
improving population health.

BACKGROUND: The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has affected a large 
number of countries. Informing the public and decision makers of the COVID-19's 
economic burdens is essential for understanding the real pandemic impact.
METHODS: COVID-19 premature mortality and disability impact in Taiwan was 
analyzed using the Taiwan National Infectious Disease Statistics System (TNIDSS) 
by estimating the sex/age-specific years of life lost through death (YLLs), the 
number of years lived with disability (YLDs), and the disability-adjusted life 
years (DALYs) from January 2020 to November 2021.
RESULTS: Taiwan recorded 1004.13 DALYs (95% CI: 1002.75-1005.61) per 100,000 
population for COVID-19, with YLLs accounting for 99.5% (95% CI: 99.3%99.6%) of 
all DALYs, with males suffering more from the disease than females. For 
population aged ≥ 70 years, the disease burdens of YLDs and YLLs were 0.1% and 
99.9%, respectively. Furthermore, we found that duration of disease in critical 
state contributed 63.9% of the variance in DALY estimations.
CONCLUSIONS: The nationwide estimation of DALYs in Taiwan provides insights into 
the demographic distributions and key epidemiological parameter for DALYs. The 
essentiality of enforcing protective precautions when needed is also implicated. 
The higher YLLs percentage in DALYs also revealed the fact of high confirmed 
death rates in Taiwan. To reduce infection risks and disease, it is crucial to 
maintain moderate social distancing, border control, hygiene measures, and 
increase vaccine coverage levels.

OBJECTIVES: Stopping smoking has proven benefits in nearly all illnesses but the 
impact and health economic benefits of stopping smoking after a diagnosis of 
lung cancer are less well defined. We assessed the cost-effectiveness of smoking 
cessation (SC) services for patients with newly diagnosed lung cancer against 
current usual care, where patients are unlikely to receive SC service referral.
METHODS: A health economic model was constructed in Excel. The modelled 
population comprised of patients with a new diagnosis of non-small cell lung 
cancer (NSCLC). Data from the LungCast data set (Clinical Trials Identifier 
NCT01192256) were used to estimate model inputs. A structured search of 
published literature identified inputs not represented in LungCast, including 
healthcare resource use and costs. Costs were estimated from a 2020/2021 UK 
National Health Service and Personal Social Services perspective. The model 
estimated the incremental quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained in patients 
with newly diagnosed NSCLC receiving targeted SC intervention than those 
receiving no intervention. Extensive one-way sensitivity analyses explored input 
and data set uncertainty.
RESULTS: In the 5-year base case, the model estimated an incremental cost of £14 
904 per QALY gained through SC intervention. Sensitivity analysis estimated an 
outcome range of between £9935 and £32 246 per QALY gained. The model was most 
sensitive to the estimates of relative quit rates and expected healthcare 
resource use.
CONCLUSION: This exploratory analysis indicates that SC intervention for smokers 
with patients with newly diagnosed NSCLC should be a cost-effective use of UK 
National Health Service resources. Additional research with focused costing is 
needed to confirm this positioning.

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to develop a scoring function to calculate health 
utilities for health states described by the Health Utility for Glaucoma (HUG-5) 
based on the preferences of the general population in the United States.
METHODS: Preferences for HUG-5 health states were elicited using the standard 
gamble and visual analog scale through an online survey. Quota-based sampling 
was used to recruit a representative sample of the US general population in 
terms of age, sex, and race. A multiple attribute disutility function (MADUF) 
approach was adopted to derive scoring for the HUG-5. Model fit was assessed 
using mean absolute error associated with 5 HUG-5 marker health states that 
describe mild/moderate and severe glaucoma.
RESULTS: Of 634 respondents completing the tasks, 416 were included in the 
estimation of the MADUF; 260 respondents (63%) considered worst possible HUG-5 
health state better than death. The preferred scoring function generates the 
utilities ranging from 0.05 (worst HUG-5 health state) to 1 (best HUG-5 health 
state). The correlation between mean elicited and estimated values for marker 
states was strong (R2 = 0.97) with mean absolute error = 0.11.
CONCLUSIONS: The MADUF for HUG-5 is used to measure health utilities on the 
scale of perfect health and death, which can be used to estimate 
quality-adjusted life-years for economic evaluations of glaucoma interventions.

    Lancet Neurol. 2023 May;22(5):368-369.

BACKGROUND: Generalised myasthenia gravis is a chronic, unpredictable, and 
debilitating rare disease, often accompanied by high treatment burden and with 
an unmet need for more efficacious and well tolerated treatments. Zilucoplan is 
a subcutaneous, self-administered macrocyclic peptide complement C5 inhibitor. 
We aimed to assess safety, efficacy, and tolerability of zilucoplan in patients 
with acetylcholine receptor autoantibody (AChR)-positive generalised myasthenia 
gravis.
METHODS: RAISE was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial 
that was done at 75 sites in Europe, Japan, and North America. We enrolled 
patients (aged 18-74 years) with AChR-positive generalised myasthenia gravis 
(Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America disease class II-IV), a myasthenia 
gravis activities of daily living (MG-ADL) score of least 6, and a quantitative 
myasthenia gravis score of at least 12. Participants were randomly assigned 
(1:1) to receive subcutaneous zilucoplan 0·3 mg/kg once daily by self-injection, 
or matched placebo, for 12 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint was change from 
baseline to week 12 in MG-ADL score in the modified intention-to-treat 
population (all randomly assigned patients who received at least one dose of 
study drug and had at least one post-dosing MG-ADL score). Safety was mainly 
assessed by the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) in all 
patients who had received at least one dose of zilucoplan or placebo. This trial 
is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04115293. An open-label extension study 
is ongoing (NCT04225871).
FINDINGS: Between Sept 17, 2019, and Sept 10, 2021, 239 patients were screened 
for the study, of whom 174 (73%) were eligible. 86 (49%) patients were randomly 
assigned to zilucoplan 0·3 mg/kg and 88 (51%) were assigned to placebo. Patients 
assigned to zilucoplan showed a greater reduction in MG-ADL score from baseline 
to week 12, compared with those assigned to placebo (least squares mean change 
-4·39 [95% CI -5·28 to -3·50] vs -2·30 [-3·17 to -1·43]; least squares mean 
difference -2·09 [-3·24 to -0·95]; p=0·0004). TEAEs occurred in 66 (77%) 
patients in the zilucoplan group and in 62 (70%) patients in the placebo group. 
The most common TEAE was injection-site bruising (n=14 [16%] in the zilucoplan 
group and n=8 [9%] in the placebo group). Incidences of serious TEAEs and 
serious infections were similar in both groups. One patient died in each group; 
neither death (COVID-19 [zilucoplan] and cerebral haemorrhage [placebo]) was 
considered related to the study drug.
INTERPRETATION: Zilucoplan treatment showed rapid and clinically meaningful 
improvements in myasthenia gravis-specific efficacy outcomes, had a favourable 
safety profile, and was well tolerated, with no major safety findings. 
Zilucoplan is a new potential treatment option for a broad population of 
patients with AChR-positive generalised myasthenia gravis. The long-term safety 
and efficacy of zilucoplan is being assessed in an ongoing open-label extension 
study.

Panax ginseng C. A. Meyer (ginseng), a traditional Chinese herb, is usually used 
to improve health and increase anti-aging activity for human. Polysaccharides 
are bioactive components of ginseng. Herein, using Caenorhabditis elegans as a 
model, we discovered a ginseng-derived rhamnogalacturonan I (RG-I) pectin 
WGPA-1-RG promoted longevity via TOR signalling pathway with transcription 
factors FOXO/DAF-16 and Nrf2/SKN-1 accumulated in the nucleus, where they 
activated target genes. And the WGPA-1-RG-mediated lifespan extension was 
dependent on endocytosis, rather than a bacterial metabolic process. Glycosidic 
linkage analyses combined with arabinose- and galactose-releasing enzyme 
hydrolyses identified the RG-I backbone of WGPA-1-RG was primarily substituted 
with α-1,5-linked arabinan, β-1,4-linked galactan and arabinogalactan II (AG-II) 
side chains. Feeding worms with the WGPA-1-RG-derived fractions which lost 
distinct structural elements by enzymatic digestions, we found the arabinan side 
chains prominently contributed to the longevity-promoting activity of WGPA-1-RG. 
These findings provide a novel ginseng-derived nutrient that potentially 
increases human longevity.

Deaths of Despair (DoD), or mortality resulting from suicide, drug overdose, and 
alcohol-related liver disease, have been rising steadily in the United States 
over the last several decades. In 2020, a record 186,763 annual despair-related 
deaths were documented, contributing to the longest sustained decline in US life 
expectancy since 1915-1918. This forum feature considers how health humanities 
disciplines might fruitfully engage with this era-defining public health 
catastrophe and help society better understand and respond to the crisis.

BACKGROUND: Smoking is a major risk factor for chronic diseases causing early 
death and disability. Smoking prevalence over the past 25years has remained high 
in Switzerland. Evidence about the burden of disease and cost of illness 
attributable to smoking can support tobacco control. The aim of the present 
paper is to quantify from a societal perspective the mortality, 
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), medical costs and productivity losses 
attributable to smoking in Switzerland in 2017.
METHODS: Smoking attributable fractions (SAFs) were calculated based on the 
prevalence of current and former active smoking in the latest Swiss Health 
Survey from 2017 and relative risks from the literature. The SAFs were then 
multiplied with the number of deaths, DALYs, medical costs and productivity 
losses in the total population.
RESULTS: In the Swiss population in 2017 smoking accounted for 14.4% of all 
deaths, for 29.2% of the deaths due to smoking-related diseases, 36.0% of the 
DALYs, 27.8% of the medical costs and 27.9% of productivity losses. Total costs 
amounted to CHF 5.0 billion which equals CHF 604 per capita per year. The 
highest disease burden in terms of mortality and DALYs attributable to smoking 
was observed for lung cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), 
whereas the highest cost of illness in terms of medical costs was observed for 
coronary heart diseases and lung cancer and in terms of productivity losses for 
COPD and coronary heart diseases. Sex and age group differences were found.
CONCLUSIONS: We provide an estimate of the burden of smoking on disease-specific 
mortality, DALYs, medical costs and productivity losses in Switzerland that 
could be prevented through evidence-based tobacco prevention and control 
policies as well as regular monitoring of tobacco consumption.

BACKGROUND: The prevalence of age-related neurodegenerative diseases has risen 
in conjunction with an increase in life expectancy. Although there is emerging 
evidence that air pollution might accelerate or worsen dementia progression, 
studies on Asian regions remains limited. This study aimed to investigate the 
relationship between long-term exposure to PM10 and the risk of developing 
Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia in the elderly population in South 
Korea.
METHODS: The baseline population was 1.4 million people aged 65 years and above 
who participated in at least one national health checkup program from the 
National Health Insurance Service between 2008 and 2009. A nationwide 
retrospective cohort study was designed, and patients were followed from the 
date of cohort entry (January 1, 2008) to the date of dementia occurrence, 
death, moving residence, or the end of the study period (December 31, 2019), 
whichever came first. Long-term average PM10 exposure variable was constructed 
from national monitoring data considering time-dependent exposure. Extended Cox 
proportional hazard models with time-varying exposure were used to estimate 
hazard ratios (HR) for Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia.
RESULTS: A total of 1,436,361 participants were selected, of whom 167,988 were 
newly diagnosed with dementia (134,811 with Alzheimer's disease and 12,215 with 
vascular dementia). The results show that for every 10 µg/m3 increase in PM10, 
the HR was 0.99 (95% CI 0.98-1.00) for Alzheimer's disease and 1.05 (95% CI 
1.02-1.08) for vascular dementia. Stratified analysis according to sex and age 
group showed that the risk of vascular dementia was higher in men and in those 
under 75 years of age.
CONCLUSION: The results found that long-term PM10 exposure was significantly 
associated with the risk of developing vascular dementia but not with 
Alzheimer's disease. These findings suggest that the mechanism behind the 
PM10-dementia relationship could be linked to vascular damage.

Obesity significantly decreases life expectancy and increases the incidence of 
age-related dysfunctions, including β-cell dysregulation leading to inadequate 
insulin secretion. Here, we show that diluted plasma from obese human donors 
acutely impairs β-cell integrity and insulin secretion relative to plasma from 
lean subjects. Similar results were observed with diluted sera from obese rats 
fed ad libitum, when compared to sera from lean, calorically restricted, 
animals. The damaging effects of obese circulating factors on β-cells occurs in 
the absence of nutrient overload, and mechanistically involves mitochondrial 
dysfunction, limiting glucose-supported oxidative phosphorylation and ATP 
production. We demonstrate that increased levels of adiponectin, as found in 
lean plasma, are the protective characteristic preserving β-cell function; 
indeed, sera from adiponectin knockout mice limits β-cell metabolic fluxes 
relative to controls. Furthermore, oxidative phosphorylation and 
glucose-sensitive insulin secretion, which are completely abrogated in the 
absence of this hormone, are restored by the presence of adiponectin alone, 
surprisingly even in the absence of other serological components, for both the 
insulin-secreting INS1 cell line and primary islets. The addition of adiponectin 
to cells treated with plasma from obese donors completely restored β-cell 
functional integrity, indicating the lack of this hormone was causative of the 
dysfunction. Overall, our results demonstrate that low circulating adiponectin 
is a key damaging element for β-cells, and suggest strong therapeutic potential 
for the modulation of the adiponectin signaling pathway in the prevention of 
age-related β-cell dysfunction.

INTRODUCTION AND HYPOTHESIS: Postpartum urinary incontinence (UI) is prevalent, 
yet health-seeking behaviours for prevention and treatment are markedly low. 
Health-related stigma refers to conditions that may be socially devalued and 
considered deviating from "expected norms" and is a barrier to equitable health 
care. It may be plausible that stigma is associated with postpartum UI and leads 
to avoiding health-seeking behaviours, which this scoping review sought to 
examine and summarize.
METHODS: The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses 
extension for scoping reviews was followed. The following keywords were used to 
develop a search strategy: Postpartum, Urinary Incontinence and Stigma. The 
search was carried out on PubMed, PsycInfo, Scopus, CINAHL, Web of Science and 
ProQuest Dissertation and Theses Global. All study designs (clinical trials, 
observational studies, qualitative studies) were eligible for inclusion. Data 
were extracted and mapped to identify causal factors of postpartum UI stigma and 
implications for outcomes and behaviours.
RESULTS: Twelve studies were included. Most studies utilized questionnaires 
assessing constructs related to quality of life that also captured potential 
stigma, or interviews. Sources of postpartum UI stigma included community values 
surrounding UI and self-stigma, whereby participants directed stereotypes 
associated with urinary leakage towards themselves. Implications of postpartum 
UI stigma included negative mental emotions such as shame and embarrassment, 
which led to avoiding situations where they needed to disclose symptoms, 
including in health care environments.
CONCLUSIONS: Future research requires a purposeful assessment of postpartum UI 
stigma to learn from lived experience how to mitigate stigma and improve quality 
of care.

PURPOSE: The European Union Horizon 2020 research and innovation funding program 
awarded the NIGHTINGALE grant to develop a toolkit to support first responders 
engaged in prehospital (PH) mass casualty incident (MCI) response. To reach the 
projects' objectives, the NIGHTINGALE consortium used a Translational Science 
(TS) process. The present work is the first TS stage (T1) aimed to extract data 
relevant for the subsequent modified Delphi study (T2) statements.
METHODS: The authors were divided into three work groups (WGs) MCI Triage, PH 
Life Support and Damage Control (PHLSDC), and PH Processes (PHP). Each WG 
conducted simultaneous literature searches following the PRISMA extension for 
scoping reviews. Relevant data were extracted from the included articles and 
indexed using pre-identified PH MCI response themes and subthemes.
RESULTS: The initial search yielded 925 total references to be considered for 
title and abstract review (MCI Triage 311, PHLSDC 329, PHP 285), then 483 
articles for full reference review (MCI Triage 111, PHLSDC 216, PHP 156), and 
finally 152 articles for the database extraction process (MCI Triage 27, PHLSDC 
37, PHP 88). Most frequent subthemes and novel concepts have been identified as 
a basis for the elaboration of draft statements for the T2 modified Delphi 
study.
CONCLUSION: The three simultaneous scoping reviews allowed the extraction of 
relevant PH MCI subthemes and novel concepts that will enable the NIGHTINGALE 
consortium to create scientifically anchored statements in the T2 modified 
Delphi study.

Cinnamon essential oil (CEO)-based Pickering emulsions were prepared using 
chitosan (CS) and soy protein isolate (SPI) colloid particles as stabilizers and 
genipin as cross-linker. Pickering emulsions have smaller particle sizes, higher 
stability, and encapsulation efficiency at a CS:SPI ratio of 1:4. The Pickering 
emulsion-modified collagen films showed enhanced thermal stability, UV-blocking 
properties, and water resistance. In addition, the antioxidant (DPPH scavenging 
activity, 18.35%-50.59%) and antimicrobial activities (inhibition zone, 
Escherichia coli, 0-1.85 cm; Staphylococcus aureus, 0-1.57 cm; Pseudomonas 
fluorescens, 0-1.34 cm) of the films were improved due to the sustained release 
of CEO, with the release kinetics following the Fickian diffusion of the 
Ritger-Peppas model. When the functionalized film was used for pork 
preservation, a four-day extension of shelf life was observed. Collectively, our 
findings suggest that Pickering emulsions provide great potential for the 
application of collagen film in pork preservation.

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to quantify the association between the loss of 
health state utilities (LHSU) and obesity, considering different obesity 
categories. This is relevant to interventions economic evaluations and for 
public policy decision planning.
METHODS: Using data from the Chilean National Health Survey, this study uses 
linear regression models and counterfactual scenarios to calculate the prevalent 
burden, population averages, and total sum of LHSU attributable to obesity for 
the Chilean national level on people older than 15 years, year 2017. Adjustments 
for socioeconomic status and associated noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) are 
considered. Calculating the LHSU using these methods enables the approximation 
of loss of prevalent quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs).
RESULTS: The raw obesity LHSU burden was 9.1% (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 
5.1-13). When adjustment is considered, the LHSU attributable to obesity reaches 
4.6% (95% UI 0.6-8.5) being responsible for 121 045 prevalent QALYs. 
Socioeconomic status adjusted analysis of higher body mass index (BMI, in kg/m2) 
categories of obesity shows a dose-response effect for LHSU, being the BMI ≥ 40 
category with the highest population average of attributable LHSU (10.1; 95% UI 
5.5-14.5, scale 0 [full health] to 100 [dead]). Burden for BMI ≥ 35 categories 
showed the biggest change after NCD adjustment.
CONCLUSIONS: Obesity carries a significant burden of QALY loss. Policy 
decision-making addressing obesity should focus specially on the BMI ≥ 40 group. 
NCD comorbidity should be considered for policies addressing the BMI ≥ 35 group.
