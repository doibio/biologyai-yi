standard of care, or substituting frequently used diagnostic procedures for the 
diagnosis and management of HF, regardless of the healthcare setting of 
interest, was proved to be a valid tool for clinical decision-making. Moreover 
it was associated with improved patient outcomes and important cost-savings 
mainly attributed to lower admission and readmission rates, shorter 
hospitalization length and improved health-related quality of life.

The present study evaluated the total phenolic and flavonoid contents as well as 
total antioxidant capacity (TAC) of three cultivars of Actinidia arguta Planch. 
kiwi berries; cv. Mansoo (Mansoo), cv. Chiak (Chiak), and cv. Haeyeon (Haeyeon). 
In addition, the anti-inflammatory effects of the three cultivars of kiwi 
berries were investigated using a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW 264.7 
murine macrophage cell line. Mansoo had the highest total phenolic content and 
TAC among the three cultivars, whereas Chiak had the highest total flavonoid 
content. The total antioxidant capacities of the kiwi berry extracts were more 
strongly correlated with total phenolic content than with total flavonoid 
content. The kiwi berry extracts suppressed the secretion of pro-inflammatory 
cytokines, including interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α, from 
LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells. The release of nitrite, an indirect indicator of 
nitric oxide, was also ameliorated by pre-treatment with the kiwi berry extracts 
in a dose-dependent manner. Cellular-based measurements of antioxidant capacity 
exhibited that the kiwi berry extracts had cellular antioxidant capacities. Such 
cellular antioxidant effects are possibly attributed to their direct antioxidant 
capacity or to the inhibition of reactive oxygen species generation via 
anti-inflammatory effects. Our findings suggest that kiwi berries are potential 
antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agents.

OBJECTIVES: To estimate the clinical and economic impact of drug-eluting 
endovascular treatment strategies for femoropopliteal artery disease compared 
with current standard of care.
DESIGN: Systematic literature search to pool target lesion revascularisations 
(TLR). Model-based per-patient cost impact and quasi-cost-effectiveness 
projection over 24 months based on pooled TLRs and current reimbursement.
SETTING: The UK's National Health Service (NHS).
PARTICIPANTS: Patients presenting with symptomatic femoropopliteal disease 
eligible for endovascular treatment.
INTERVENTIONS: Current National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) 
guideline-recommended treatment with percutaneous transluminal balloon 
angioplasty (PTA) and bailout bare metal stenting (BMS) versus primary BMS 
placement, or drug-coated balloon (DCB), or drug-eluting stent (DES) treatment.
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: 24-month per-patient cost impact to NHS 
(primary outcome).
SECONDARY OUTCOMES: pooled 24-month TLR rates; numbers needed to treat (NNTs); 
cost per TLR avoided and estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) 
in £ per quality-adjusted life year (QALY).
RESULTS: N=28 studies were identified, reporting on 5167 femoropopliteal 
lesions. Over 24 months, DCB, DES and BMS reduced TLRs of de novo lesions from 
36.2% to 17.6%, 19.4% and 26.9%, respectively, at an increased cost of £43, £44 
and £112. NNTs to avoid 1 TLR in 24 months were 5.4, 6.0 and 10.8, resulting in 
cost per TLR avoided of £231, £264 and £1204. DCB was estimated to add 0.011 
QALYs, DES 0.010 QALYs and BMS 0.005 QALYs, resulting in estimated ICERs of 
£3983, £4534 and £20 719 per QALY gained. A subset analysis revealed more 
favourable clinical and economic outcomes for a 3.5 µg/mm(2) DCB with urea 
excipient, compared with the rest of DCBs. A modest reduction of 10% in DCB and 
DES prices made drug-eluting treatments dominant.
CONCLUSIONS: Widespread adoption of drug-eluting endovascular therapies for 
femoropopliteal disease would add meaningful clinical benefit at reasonable 
additional costs to the NHS. Based on currently available data, DCBs offer the 
highest clinical and economic value.

PO-10 - Lung cancer with tumour thrombosis: a poor prognosticator.

Tan ZK(1), Casipit P(1), Pandit NS(1).

Author information:
(1)Tan Tock Seng Hospital, China.

INTRODUCTION: Literature has reported tumour thrombus along the inferior vena 
cava as a result of underlying renal cell carcinoma (RCC) or along the portal 
vein from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, tumor thrombus is a rather 
uncommon complication of a metastatic tumour deposit in the superior vena cava 
in lung adenocarcinoma. Detection of tumour thrombus at the time of cancer 
diagnosis is a significant predictor of morbidity and mortality. Unlike RCC with 
vena caval extension where surgical resection provides meaningful long term 
survival, lung adenocarcinoma with vena cava involvement has a very dismal 
outcome.
AIM: We discuss a rare case of a tumor thrombus secondary to a lung malignancy, 
the differentiation between a tumor and a bland thrombus and the rationale 
behind treatment of the tumor thrombus.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We report a case of a 77 year-old male who presented with 
right sided chest pain and was subsequently found to have a right upper lobe 
lung mass. The lung biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of a adenocarcinoma. Computed 
tomography scans for staging detected focal destruction of the right second rib 
and tumour thombus in the superior vena cava with partial extension to the left 
brachiocephalic vein. No other metastases were noted. The patient received 
chemotherapy with paclitaxel and carboplatin for the stage IV lung 
adenocarcinoma. He was also started on subcutaneous heparin for tumour thrombus. 
However, the patient died of pneumonia eight weeks later.
RESULTS: A review of literature did not show effective treatment for tumour 
thrombus. Pathogenesis of tumour thrombus is unclear, however several theories 
have been postulated for the formation of tumour thrombus; it could result from 
the direct invasion by tumour resulting in epithelial damage or because of 
formation of tumour thrombus on top of bland thrombosis, related to cancer 
hypercoagulability. Irrespective of etiology, tumour thrombus itself being a 
thrombophilic condition should be treated with anticoagulation, however the 
mainstay of treatment is treating the underlying cancer.
CONCLUSIONS: Adenocarcinoma of the lung with tumour thrombus significantly alter 
prognosis although the individual's Karnofsky performance scale and response to 
treatment play a major role in determining life expectancy. Further studies need 
to be done to address the preferred modality and duration of anticoagulation for 
tumor thrombus.

The present study was performed to identify the genotype of a hypertrophic 
cardiomyopathy family and investigate the clinicopathogenic characteristics and 
prognostic features of relevant genetic abnormalities. Target sequence capture 
sequencing was performed to screen for pathogenic alleles in a 32-year-old 
female patient (proband). Sanger sequencing was carried out to verify the 
results. Sanger sequencing was also performed on other family members to 
identify allele carriers. A survival analysis was carried out using published 
literature and our findings. We found that the proband and her son harboured a 
Gly716Arg sequence variant of the β-myosin heavy chain. Neither the proband's 
father nor the mother were carriers of this sequence variant; thus, the mutation 
was classified as "de novo". Further survival analysis revealed that female 
patients appear to have a longer life expectancy compared with males. Our study 
may provide an effective approach for the genetic diagnosis of hypertrophic 
cardiomyopathy.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of seasonal inactivated influenza 
vaccination among pregnant women using data from three recent influenza seasons 
in the United States.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We developed a decision-analytic model 
following a cohort of 5.2 million pregnant women and their infants aged <6 
months to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of vaccinating women against seasonal 
influenza during pregnancy from a societal perspective. The main outcome 
measures were quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained and cost-effectiveness 
ratios. Data sources included surveillance data, epidemiological studies, and 
published vaccine cost data. Sensitivity analyses were also performed. All costs 
and outcomes were discounted at 3% annually.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Total costs (direct and indirect), effects (QALY gains, 
averted case numbers), and incremental cost-effectiveness of seasonal 
inactivated influenza vaccination among pregnant women (cost per QALY gained).
RESULTS: Using a recent benchmark of 52.2% vaccination coverage among pregnant 
women, we studied a hypothetical cohort of 2,753,015 vaccinated pregnant women. 
With an estimated vaccine effectiveness of 73% among pregnant women and 63% 
among infants <6 months, QALY gains for each season were 305 (2010-2011), 123 
(2011-2012), and 610 (2012-2013). Compared with no vaccination, seasonal 
influenza vaccination during pregnancy was cost-saving when using data from the 
2010-2011 and 2012-2013 influenza seasons. The cost-effectiveness ratio was 
greater than $100,000/QALY with the 2011-2012 influenza season data, when CDC 
reported a low attack rate compared to other recent seasons.
CONCLUSIONS: Influenza vaccination for pregnant women can reduce morbidity from 
influenza in both pregnant women and their infants aged <6 months. Seasonal 
influenza vaccination during pregnancy is cost-saving during moderate to severe 
influenza seasons.

Lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs) are metabolic disorders that result from a 
situation when enzymes taking part in different processes exist in too small an 
amount or don't exist whatsoever. They exhibit great clinical diversification. 
The intensity of the symptoms depends on residual enzyme activity, type of 
stored material and storage speed. The common feature of all LSDs is their 
progressive course and reduced life expectancy. The symptoms can appear in the 
first few weeks of life and the patients are then referred for medical treatment 
to pediatricians. Older patients are referred for medical treatment to 
dermatologists, cardiologists, neurologists or orthopedists. There are few 
described cases in Poland which is due to the fact that these diseases are 
considered rare.

Kidney diseases, with some exceptions, are diseases of the elderly. During last 
century mortality due to infections and injuries has gradually decreased and a 
longer life expectancy increased a rate of chronic diseases. Diabetes, 
hypertension and atherosclerosis have become most common causes of kidney 
diseases. A gradual nephrons loss in aging kidneys causes them more susceptible 
to acute injury as well as fastens the progression of their chronic disease. 
This leads to the rapid increase in the incidence of kidney diseases with aging. 
This paper discusses the process of kidney senescence and its influence on the 
course of kidney disease as well as the differences in the treatment of patients 
over 65 years.

In this study, the effect of commercial additives viz. cafodos and altesa 
employed to treat Indian octopus (Cistopus indicus) was examined during chilled 
and frozen storage. Shelf lives of treated and untreated octopus in ice were 6 
and 8 days, respectively in ice. Treated and untreated frozen octopus had a 
shelf life of 40 days. Autolytic and microbiological changes were not controlled 
by the additives, as evidenced through rapid reduction in non-protein nitrogen 
(NPN) and α-amino nitrogen (α-AN) compounds; as well as accumulation of water 
soluble ammoniacal nitrogen and total volatile base- nitrogen (TVB-N) compounds. 
Loss of texture and colour were the major quality defects noticed in treated 
octopus as a result of enhanced protein solubility. Therefore, the additives 
approved for use in octopus neither enhanced the shelf life nor improved the 
sensory quality.

Sciences, Mashhad, IR Iran; BC Disease Control Center, Vancouver, Canada.

BACKGROUND: In measuring health utilities, the primary reason for selecting 
patients as a source for valuations is that they directly experience the impact 
of the disease.
OBJECTIVES: Accordingly, the aim of this study was to examine the variation in 
generic utility measures with respect to acute poisonings by including a 
comparison between those subjects who had high intention and low intention to 
commit suicide.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We evaluated the responses of patients who had attempted 
suicide and were admitted to a toxicology ward. We used multiple methods, 
including TTO, VAS, and EQ-5D.
RESULTS: We reviewed the collected questionnaires of one hundred patients 
admitted to the medical toxicology ward of Emam Reza teaching hospital in 
Mashhad, Iran. Our results show that the mental state after an incomplete 
suicide attempt can present either a real desire for suicide or a desire for 
attention from relatives and rejection of life problems.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that the mental states associated with 
specific diseases should not be ignored in evaluating health states. Although 
there are benefits to relying on expert panels and the general population in 
evaluating various health states, attention to the particular health states of 
the patients (taking into account their associated mental well-being) should 
also be utilized.

BACKGROUND: The prevalence of overweight and obesity is increasing globally and 
is an established risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Our objective 
was to evaluate the impact of overweight and obesity on life expectancy and 
years lived with and without CVD in older adults.
METHODS: The study included 6636 individuals (3750 women) aged 55 years and 
older from the population-based Rotterdam Study. We developed multistate life 
tables by using prevalence, incidence rate and hazard ratios (HR) for three 
transitions (free-of-CVD-to-CVD, free-of-CVD-to-death and CVD-to-death), 
stratifying by the categories of body mass index (BMI) at baseline and adjusting 
for confounders.
RESULTS: During 12 years of follow-up, we observed 1035 incident CVD events and 
1902 overall deaths. Obesity was associated with an increased risk of CVD among 
men (HR 1.57 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.17, 2.11)) and women (HR 1.49 (95% 
CI 1.19, 1.86)), compared with normal weight individuals. Overweight and obesity 
were not associated with mortality in men and women without CVD. Among men with 
CVD, obesity compared with normal weight, was associated with a lower risk of 
mortality (HR 0.67 (95% CI 0.49, 0.90)). Overweight and obesity did not 
influence total life expectancy. However, obesity was associated with 2.6 fewer 
years (95% CI -4.8, -0.4) lived free from CVD in men and 1.9 (95% CI -3.3, -0.9) 
in women. Moreover, men and women with obesity lived 2.9 (95% CI 1.1, 4.8) and 
1.7 (95% CI 0.6, 2.8) more years suffering from CVD compared with normal weight 
counterparts.
CONCLUSIONS: Obesity had no effect on total life expectancy in older 
individuals, but increased the risk of having CVD earlier in life and 
consequently extended the number of years lived with CVD. Owing to increasing 
prevalence of obesity and improved treatment of CVD, we might expect more 
individuals living with CVD and for a longer period of time.

Long-Term Survival Following Traumatic Brain Injury: A Population-Based 
Parametric Survival Analysis.

Author information:

School of Health and Related Research (ScHARR), University of Sheffield, 
Sheffield, UK.

BACKGROUND: Long-term mortality may be increased following traumatic brain 
injury (TBI); however, the degree to which survival could be reduced is unknown. 
We aimed at modelling life expectancy following post-acute TBI to provide 
predictions of longevity and quantify differences in survivorship with the 
general population.
METHODS: A population-based retrospective cohort study using data from the 
Rochester Epidemiology Project (REP) was performed. A random sample of patients 
from Olmsted County, Minnesota with a confirmed TBI between 1987 and 2000 was 
identified and vital status determined in 2013. Parametric survival modelling 
was then used to develop a model to predict life expectancy following TBI 
conditional on age at injury. Survivorship following TBI was also compared with 
the general population and age- and gender-matched non-head injured REP 
controls.
RESULTS: Seven hundred and sixty nine patients were included in complete case 
analyses. The median follow-up time was 16.1 years (interquartile range 
9.0-20.4) with 120 deaths occurring in the cohort during the study period. 
Survival after acute TBI was well represented by a Gompertz distribution. 
Victims of TBI surviving for at least 6 months post-injury demonstrated a much 
higher ongoing mortality rate compared to the US general population and non-TBI 
controls (hazard ratio 1.47, 95% CI 1.15-1.87). US general population cohort 
life table data was used to update the Gompertz model's shape and scale 
parameters to account for cohort effects and allow prediction of life expectancy 
in contemporary TBI.
CONCLUSIONS: Survivors of TBI have decreased life expectancy compared to the 
general population. This may be secondary to the head injury itself or result 
from patient characteristics associated with both the propensity for TBI and 
increased early mortality. Post-TBI life expectancy estimates may be useful to 
guide prognosis, in public health planning, for actuarial applications and in 
the extrapolation of outcomes for TBI economic models.

The number of deaths is often measured to monitor the population health status 
and priority of health problems. However, number of years of life lost (YLL) is 
a more appropriate indicator in some cases. We have calculated the YLL of adult 
cancers and its trend over the past few years in Yazd to provide planners with 
baseline data. Data obtained from death registration system were used to 
calculate the YLL, based on each individual's age at death, and the standardized 
expected YLL method was applied with a discount rate of 0.03, an age weight of 
0.04, and a correction factor of 0.165. All data were analyzed and prepared in 
Epi6 and Excel 2007. A total of 3,850 death records were analyzed. Some 550 
patients in Yazd province aged ≥20 die annually due to cancer (male: female 
ratio 1.3). The average ages at death in lung, CNS, breast cancer and leukemia 
cases were 68.5, 59, 58.7 and 61, respectively. The age group of 40-59 with 21 % 
had the highest cancer mortality percentage. Premature cancer deaths have caused 
40,753 YLL (5,823 YLL annually). Females lose on average more life years to 
cancer than do men (11.6 vs 9.8 years). Lung cancer (12.1%), CNS tumors (11.7%) 
and leukemia (11.4 %) were the leading causes terms of YLL due to all cancers in 
both sexes. From 2004 to 2010, cancer-caused YLL as a fraction of all YLL 
increased from 12.8 to 15.2 %. This study can help in the assessment of health 
care needs and prioritization. Cancer is the major cause of deaths and the trend 
is increasing. The use of YLLs is a better index for measurement of premature 
mortality for ranking of diseases than is death counts. Longer periods of 
observation will make these trends more robust and will help to evaluate and 
develop, better public health interventions.

This study aimed to quantify associations of the human development inequality 
(HDI) index with incidence, mortality, and mortality to incidence ratios for 
eight common cancers among different countries. In this ecological study, data 
about incidence and mortality rates of cancers was obtained from the Global 
Cancer Project for 169 countries. HDI indices for the same countries was 
obtained from the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) database. The 
concentration index was defined as the covariance between cumulative percentage 
of cancer indicators (incidence, mortality and mortality to incidence ratio) and 
the cumulative percentage of economic indicators (country economic rank). 
Results indicated that incidences of cancers of liver, cervix and esophagus were 
mainly concentrated in countries with a low HDI index while cancers of lung, 
breast, colorectum, prostate and stomach were concentrated mainly in countries 
with a high HDI index. The same pattern was observed for mortality from cancer 
except for prostate cancer that was more concentrated in countries with a low 
HDI index. Higher MIRs for all cancers were more concentrated in countries with 
a low HDI index. It was concluded that patterns of cancer occurrence correlate 
with care disparities at the country level.

Geographic disparity for colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence and mortality 
according to the human development index (HDI) might be expected. This study 
aimed at quantifying the effect measure of association HDI and its components on 
the CRC incidence and mortality. In this ecological study, CRC incidence and 
mortality was obtained from GLOBOCAN, the global cancer project for 172 
countries. Data were extracted about HDI 2013 for 169 countries from the World 
Bank report. Linear regression was constructed to measure effects of HDI and its 
components on CRC incidence and mortality. A positive trend between increasing 
HDI of countries and age-standardized rates per 100,000 of CRC incidence and 
mortality was observed. Among HDI components education was the strongest effect 
measure of association on CRC incidence and mortality, regression coefficients 
(95% confidence intervals) being 2.8 (2.4, 3.2) and 0.9 (0.8, 1), respectively. 
HDI and its components were positively related with CRC incidence and mortality 
and can be considered as targets for prevention and treatment intervention or 
tracking geographic disparities.

Presently, the world population of the elderly is growing. By improving health 
hygiene and welfare indicators, mortality and birth rates decrease and life 
expectancy increases, making the present century the century of elderly. Aging 
is one of the main risk factors for development of cancer, which itself is the 
second cause of death in old people. This study was conducted to assess the 
prevalence of cancer in the elderly covered by the Islamic Republic of Iran 
Broadcasting (IRIB) insurance program and to obtain suitable programs for cancer 
screening and early detection, increase patient survival, improve elderly care 
and to reclaim the cost of treatment in comparison to the national and 
international statistics. This is a cross-sectional study conducted on all 
elderly patients diagnosed with malignancy based on their pathology reports. In 
this study, of the total 75,500 patients covered by IRIB insurance, 17.2% 
belonged to the elderly group, males accounting for 53.3%. The most common 
cancers in old men were prostatic cancer (61.3%), colon cancer (10.3%) cancer of 
the hematologic system, bladder cancer (9.6%), lung cancer (9.1%), thyroid 
cancer (3.9%) and brain tumors (1.3%). In the elderly women, the most common 
cancers were breast cancer (80.1%), colon cancer (5.1%), thyroid cancers (4.4%), 
bladder and hematologic system malignancies (3.6), lung cancer (2.9%) and brain 
tumors (0.7%). In addition, the prevalence of cancer was almost the same as 
national and international statistics. With the exception of non-melanoma skin 
cancer no difference was shown in prevalence of cancer between IRIB elderly 
patients and the other groups of cancer patients in Iran.

Very old people (referred to as those aged 85 years and over) are the fastest 
growing age segment of many Western societies owing to the steady rise of life 
expectancy and decrease in later life mortality. In the UK, there are now more 
than 1·5 million very old people (2·5 % of total population) and the number is 
projected to rise to 3·3 million or 5 % over the next 20 years. Reduced mobility 
and independence, financial constraints, higher rates of hospitalisation, 
chronic diseases and disabilities, changes in body composition, taste 
perception, digestion and absorption of food all potentially influence either 
nutrient intake or needs at this stage of life. The nutritional needs of the 
very old have been identified as a research priority by the British Nutrition 
Foundation's Task Force report, Healthy Ageing: The Role of Nutrition and 
Lifestyle. However, very little is known about the dietary habits and 
nutritional status of the very old. The Newcastle 85+ study, a cohort of more 
than 1000 85-year olds from the North East of England and the Life and Living in 
Advanced Age study (New Zealand), a bicultural cohort study of advanced ageing 
of more than 900 participants from the Bay of Plenty and Rotorua regions of New 
Zealand are two unique cohort studies of ageing, which aim to assess the 
spectrum of health in the very old as well as examine the associations of health 
trajectories and outcomes with biological, clinical and social factors as each 
cohort ages. The nutrition domain included in both studies will help to fill the 
evidence gap by identifying eating patterns, and measures of nutritional status 
associated with better, or worse, health and wellbeing. This review will explore 
some of this ongoing work.

measures of population health-health expectancies in particular-have become a 
standard for quantifying and monitoring population health. To date, 
cross-national comparability of health expectancies is limited, except within 
the European Union (EU). To advance international comparability, the European 
Joint Action on Healthy Life Years (JA: EHLEIS) set up an international working 
group. The working group discussed the conceptual basis of summary measures of 
population health and made suggestions for the development of comparable health 
expectancies to be used across the EU and Organisation for Economic Co-operation 
and Development (OECD) members. In this paper, which summarises the main 
results, we argue that harmonised health data needed for health expectancy 
calculation can best be obtained from 'global' survey measures, which provide a 
snapshot of the health situation using 1 or a few survey questions. We claim 
that 2 global measures of health should be pursued for their high policy 
relevance: a global measure of participation restriction and a global measure of 
functional limitation. We finally provide a blueprint for the future development 
and implementation of the 2 global measures. The blueprint sets the basis for 
subsequent international collaboration, having as a core group Member States of 
the EU, the USA and Japan. Other countries, in particular OECD members, are 
invited to join the initiative.

[(Bio)artificial liver support: ready for the patient?].

[Article in Dutch; Abstract available in Dutch from the publisher]

Chamuleau RA.

In 2016, an intensive-care physician has at his disposal a number of artificial 
organs for the support of patients with organ failure. Examples are the 
artificial kidney and the heart-lung machine. Artificial livers are being 
developed for patients with severe liver failure whose lives can only be saved 
at the present time by a transplant with a donor liver. These artificial livers 
are based either on a device that removes toxic materials from the patient's 
blood with, for example, albumin dialysis, or make use of bio-reactors filled 
with functioning liver cells, the so-called bio-artificial liver. In theory, the 
bio-artificial liver has the greatest potential to increase life expectancy. The 
results of clinical studies are also very promising. They are not yet 
sufficient, however, to permit general clinical use.

Publisher: Anno 2016 beschikt een intensive care-arts over een aantal 
kunstmatige organen om patiënten met falende organen te ondersteunen. 
Voorbeelden zijn de kunstnier en de hart-longmachine. Voor patiënten met ernstig 
leverfalen, bij wie de enige levensreddende behandeling tot op heden een 
transplantatie met een donorlever is, zijn kunstlevers in ontwikkeling. Deze 
kunstlevers zijn ofwel gebaseerd op apparatuur die eiwitgebonden toxische 
stoffen verwijderen uit het bloed van de patiënt met bijvoorbeeld albumine 
dialyse, ofwel maken gebruik van bioreactoren gevuld met functionerende 
levercellen, de zogenoemde bioartificiële lever. Theoretisch gezien heeft de 
bioartificiële lever de grootste potentie om levensduur verlengend te werken. 
Ook uit klinisch onderzoek blijken de resultaten veelbelovend, maar deze zijn 
nog onvoldoende om al tot algemeen klinisch gebruik over te gaan.

Cost-Effectiveness of Peg-Interferon, Interferon and Oral Nucleoside Analogues 
in the Treatment of Chronic Hepatitis B and D Infections in China.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The cost-effectiveness of highly effective, but 
costly, peg-interferon (peg-IFN) treatment for chronic hepatitis B (CHB) 
infections in China is unknown. Endemic hepatitis D virus (HDV) may also modify 
the effectiveness of any HBV treatment option. The objective of this study is to 
determine the best antiviral treatment from a societal perspective in the 
Chinese population, which contains a mix of HBV and HDV infections.
METHODS: A Markov model is developed to simulate the clinical course of CHB and 
chronic hepatitis D (CHD) individuals. For a hypothetical Chinese cohort of 
10,000 individuals aged 30-60 years, cost-utility analysis is performed for 
therapies with: lamivudine, adefovir, telbivudine, entecavir, IFN and Peg-IFN. 
Costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) are discounted at 3 % annually. A 
one-way sensitivity analysis is also conducted.
RESULTS: Lamivudine, adefovir, telbivudine, and entecavir are all cost-effective 
treatments compared to palliative care at an incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio (ICER) of -$418, -$197, -$443 and -$317 per QALY, respectively (2015 US 
dollars). Peg-IFN yields a maximum 156,000 QALYs with an ICER of $1149 per QALY 
while IFN results in the highest cumulative mortality of 48 % along with the 
lowest QALY gained. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses confirm that only Peg-IFN 
and ETV are the only two cost-effective options at the current 
willingness-to-pay (WTP) of $12,000 in China. However, entecavir has a higher 
probability of being cost-effective than Peg-IFN at current WTP for all age 
groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Peg-IFN generates maximum QALYs compared to lamivudine, adefovir, 
telbivudine and interferon, and presents itself as a cost-effective option at 
current WTP. Alternatively entecavir can be used in China, generating 10 % lower 
QALYs than Peg-IFN but costing less than palliative care.

Chronic diseases are increasing worldwide. Association of two or more chronic 
conditions is related with poor health status and reduced life expectancy, 
particularly among elderly patients. Comorbidities represent a risk factor for 
adverse events in several critical illnesses. We aimed to evaluate if elderly 
patients are affected by multiple chronic pathologies, assessed by Charlson 
comorbidity index (CCI), showed a reduced in-hospital survival after ischemic 
stroke. In a 3-year period, we evaluated all the subjects admitted to our 
internal medicine department for ischemic stroke. Age, sex, NIHSS score and all 
the comorbidities were recorded. Days of hospitalization, hospital-related 
infections and in-hospital mortality were also assessed. For each patient, we 
evaluated CCI, obtaining four classes: group 1 (CCI: 2-3), group 2 (CCI: 4-5), 
group 3 (CCI: 6-7) and group 4 (CCI: ≥8). Survival was evaluated with 
Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses. The complete model considered 
in-hospital death as the main outcome, days of hospitalization as the time 
variable and CCI as the main predictor, adjusting for NIHSS, sex and nosocomial 
infections. Patients in CCI group 3 and 4 had an increased risk of in-hospital 
mortality, independently of NIHSS, sex and nosocomial infections. Elderly 
patients with multiple comorbidities have higher risk of in-hospital death when 
affected by ischemic stroke.

This study aims to estimate mortality differentials by level of schooling in the 
adult population in Brazil as a whole and its major geographic regions, 
according to sex and age. The article uses data from the item on household 
mortality in the 2010 Population Census conducted by Brazilian Institute of 
Geography and Statistics, combined with information on schooling of the 
household's reference person. The results show an important mortality 
differential by level of schooling, especially in males. Life expectancy in 
Brazilian men with a complete university education is 4.37 years more than the 
mean for the national male population and 6.27 years more than for males with 
less than a complete primary education. Among women, the educational gradient in 
life expectancy is less pronounced, with an additional 2.25 years for women with 
a complete university education, compared to women with less schooling. 
Mortality differentials according to schooling are more pronounced in the 
Northeast and Southeast regions.

Shatin, N.T, Hong Kong, China SAR.

AIM: This study aimed to compare the clinical and economic outcomes of 
pharmacogenetic-guided (PG-guided) and platelet reactivity testing-guided 
antiplatelet therapy for patients with acute coronary syndrome undergoing 
percutaneous coronary intervention.
METHODS: A decision-analytic model was simulated including four antiplatelet 
strategies: universal clopidogrel 75 mg daily, universal alternative P2Y12 
inhibitor (prasugrel or ticagrelor), PG-guided therapy, and platelet reactivity 
testing-guided therapy.
RESULTS: PG-guided therapy was the preferred option with lowest cost (US$75,208) 
and highest quality-adjusted life years gained (7.6249 quality-adjusted life 
years). The base-case results were robust in sensitivity analysis.
CONCLUSION: PG-guided antiplatelet therapy showed the highest probability to be 
preferred antiplatelet strategy for acute coronary syndrome patients with 
percutaneous coronary intervention.

BACKGROUND: The Antwerp ring road has a traffic density of 300,000 vehicles per 
day and borders the city center. The 'Ringland project' aims to change the 
current 'open air ring road' into a 'filtered tunneled ring road', putting the 
entire urban ring road into a tunnel and thus filtering air pollution. We 
conducted a health impact assessment (HIA) to quantify the possible benefit of a 
'filtered tunneled ring road', as compared to the 'open air ring road' scenario, 
on air quality and its long-term health effects.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We modeled the change in annual ambient PM2.5 and NO2 
concentrations by covering 15 kilometers of the Antwerp ring road in high 
resolution grids using the RIO-IFDM street canyon model. The exposure-response 
coefficients used were derived from a literature review: all-cause mortality, 
life expectancy, cardiopulmonary diseases and childhood Forced Vital Capacity 
development (FVC).
RESULTS: Our model predicts changes between -1.5 and +2 μg/m³ in PM2.5 within a 
1,500 meter radius around the ring road, for the 'filtered tunneled ring road' 
scenario as compared to an 'open air ring road'. These estimated annual changes 
were plotted against the population exposed to these differences. The calculated 
change of PM2.5 is associated with an expected annual decrease of 21 deaths (95% 
CI 7 to 41). This corresponds with 11.5 deaths avoided per 100,000 inhabitants 
(95% CI 3.9-23) in the first 500 meters around the ring road every year. Of 356 
schools in a 1,500 meter perimeter around the ring road changes between -10 NO2 
and + 0.17 μg/m³ were found, corresponding to FVC improvement of between 3 and 
64ml among school-age children. The predicted decline in lung cancer mortality 
and incidence of acute myocardial infarction were both only 0.1 per 100,000 
inhabitants or less.
CONCLUSION: The expected change in PM2,5 and NO2 by covering the entire urban 
ring road in Antwerp is associated with considerable health gains for the 
approximate 352,000 inhabitants living in a 1,500 meter perimeter around the 
current open air ring road.
