Comment in
    Lancet. 2015 Dec 5;386(10010):2232-4.

BACKGROUND: In the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013 (GBD 2013), knowledge 
about health and its determinants has been integrated into a comparable 
framework to inform health policy. Outputs of this analysis are relevant to 
current policy questions in England and elsewhere, particularly on health 
inequalities. We use GBD 2013 data on mortality and causes of death, and disease 
and injury incidence and prevalence to analyse the burden of disease and injury 
in England as a whole, in English regions, and within each English region by 
deprivation quintile. We also assess disease and injury burden in England 
attributable to potentially preventable risk factors. England and the English 
regions are compared with the remaining constituent countries of the UK and with 
comparable countries in the European Union (EU) and beyond.
METHODS: We extracted data from the GBD 2013 to compare mortality, causes of 
death, years of life lost (YLLs), years lived with a disability (YLDs), and 
disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) in England, the UK, and 18 other 
countries (the first 15 EU members [apart from the UK] and Australia, Canada, 
Norway, and the USA [EU15+]). We extended elements of the analysis to English 
regions, and subregional areas defined by deprivation quintile (deprivation 
areas). We used data split by the nine English regions (corresponding to the 
European boundaries of the Nomenclature for Territorial Statistics level 1 [NUTS 
1] regions), and by quintile groups within each English region according to 
deprivation, thereby making 45 regional deprivation areas. Deprivation quintiles 
were defined by area of residence ranked at national level by Index of Multiple 
Deprivation score, 2010. Burden due to various risk factors is described for 
England using new GBD methodology to estimate independent and overlapping 
attributable risk for five tiers of behavioural, metabolic, and environmental 
risk factors. We present results for 306 causes and 2337 sequelae, and 79 risks 
or risk clusters.
FINDINGS: Between 1990 and 2013, life expectancy from birth in England increased 
by 5·4 years (95% uncertainty interval 5·0-5·8) from 75·9 years (75·9-76·0) to 
81·3 years (80·9-81·7); gains were greater for men than for women. Rates of 
age-standardised YLLs reduced by 41·1% (38·3-43·6), whereas DALYs were reduced 
by 23·8% (20·9-27·1), and YLDs by 1·4% (0·1-2·8). For these measures, England 
ranked better than the UK and the EU15+ means. Between 1990 and 2013, the range 
in life expectancy among 45 regional deprivation areas remained 8·2 years for 
men and decreased from 7·2 years in 1990 to 6·9 years in 2013 for women. In 
2013, the leading cause of YLLs was ischaemic heart disease, and the leading 
cause of DALYs was low back and neck pain. Known risk factors accounted for 
39·6% (37·7-41·7) of DALYs; leading behavioural risk factors were suboptimal 
diet (10·8% [9·1-12·7]) and tobacco (10·7% [9·4-12·0]).
INTERPRETATION: Health in England is improving although substantial 
opportunities exist for further reductions in the burden of preventable disease. 
The gap in mortality rates between men and women has reduced, but marked health 
inequalities between the least deprived and most deprived areas remain. Declines 
in mortality have not been matched by similar declines in morbidity, resulting 
in people living longer with diseases. Health policies must therefore address 
the causes of ill health as well as those of premature mortality. Systematic 
action locally and nationally is needed to reduce risk exposures, support 
healthy behaviours, alleviate the severity of chronic disabling disorders, and 
mitigate the effects of socioeconomic deprivation.

Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible vision loss and costs the American 
economy $2.9 billion. Teleglaucoma remotely detects glaucoma improving access to 
ophthalmic care in rural areas. It helps manage glaucoma more efficiently to 
preserve vision and reduce healthcare costs. A cost-effectiveness analysis was 
conducted using healthcare provider or third-party payer perspective within 
rural Canada. The study population were patients at-risk of glaucoma which 
includes those with diabetes and/or hypertension, family history of glaucoma, 
adults older than 50 years, and concurrent ocular conditions in rural Alberta. 
Markov modelling was used to model glaucoma health states. Effectiveness was 
measured in Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) and costs were used in Canadian 
dollars. Using TreeAge Pro 2009, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) 
were developed in dollars per QALYs. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity 
analyses were performed to assess the factors affecting cost-effectiveness. 
Teleglaucoma had a 20% increase in ophthalmologist-referral rate; it reduced 
patient travel times by 61 hours and physician wait times by 30% in comparison 
to in-person examination (standard of care). Teleglaucoma costs $872 per patient 
screened which was 80% less than in-person examination. Teleglaucoma had a 
greater incremental effectiveness providing an additional 0.12 QALY per patient 
examination. It was more sensitive (86.5%) and less specific (78.6%) than 
in-person examination. Teleglaucoma was more cost-effective than in-person 
examination with an ICER of-$27,460/QALY. This indicated that teleglaucoma will 
save $27, 460 for each additional QALY gained. Long term benefits showed 
teleglaucoma prevents 24% cases of glaucoma blindness after 30 years. 
Teleglaucoma demonstrated improved health outcomes, as well as, cost benefits. 
It increases access to ophthalmic care and improves healthcare service 
efficiency, specifically in rural areas. Teleglaucoma is more cost-effective 
than current in-person examination and can improve the quality of life in 
glaucoma patients.

Degeneration of photoreceptors (rods and cones) results in blindness. As we rely 
almost entirely on our daytime vision mediated by the cones, it is the loss of 
these photoreceptors that results in legal blindness and poor quality of life. 
Cone dysfunction is usually observed due to two mechanisms: noncell-autonomous 
due to the secondary effect of rod death if the causative gene is specifically 
expressed in rods and cell autonomous, if the mutation is in a cone-specific 
gene. However, it is difficult to dissect cone autonomous effect of mutations in 
the genes that are expressed in both rods and cones. Here we report a property 
of murine cone photoreceptors, which is a cone-autonomous effect of the genetic 
perturbation of the retinitis pigmentosa 2 (Rp2) gene mutated in human X-linked 
RP. Constitutive loss of Rp2 results in abnormal extension of the cone outer 
segment (COS). This effect is phenocopied when the Rp2 gene is ablated 
specifically in cones but not when ablated in rods. Furthermore, the elongated 
COS exhibits abnormal ultrastructure with disorganized lamellae. Additionally, 
elongation of both the outer segment membrane and the microtubule cytoskeleton 
was observed in the absence of RP2. Taken together, our studies identify a cone 
morphological defect in retinal degeneration due to ablation of RP2 and will 
assist in understanding cone-autonomous responses during disease and develop 
targeted therapies.

HSV-1 as a novel therapy for breast cancer meningeal metastases.

Kuruppu D(1), Tanabe KK(1).

Author information:
(1)Department of Surgery, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.

Meningeal metastasis is a fatal complication of breast cancer that affects 5-8% 
of patients. When cancer cells seed in the meninges, their subsequent growth 
results in severe neurological complications involving the cranial nerves, 
cerebrum and spinal cord, limiting life expectancy to less than 4 months. The 
incidences of meningeal metastases increase with prolonged lifespan resulting 
from treatment advances for primary breast cancer and their metastases. 
Currently, there is no cure. Aggressive multimodal therapies such as radiation 
and chemotherapy (intra-cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and systemic) are ineffective. 
Therapeutic agents are often quickly cleared from the CSF, while higher doses 
that can achieve a therapeutic response are highly toxic. The secure guarding of 
the subarachnoid space by the blood-brain barrier on one side and the blood-CSF 
barrier on the other prevents chemotherapy from reaching cancer cells in the 
meninges. These challenges with treating meningeal metastases highlight the 
urgent need for a new therapeutic modality. An ideal treatment would be an agent 
that avoids rapid clearance, remains within the CSF, reaches the meninges and 
selectively destroys tumor cells. Replication conditional oncolytic herpes 
simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) may be effective in this regard. Viral oncolysis, 
the destruction of cancer cells by replicating virus, is under clinical 
investigation for cancers that are unresponsive to current therapies. It is 
based on the model of multiple cycles of lytic virus replication in cancer cells 
that amplify the injected dose. The therapeutic potential of oncolytic HSV-1 for 
breast cancer meningeal metastases is discussed here. HSV-1 could be a potential 
novel treatment for meningeal metastases that can be translated to the clinic.

Durability of devices: long-term results and clinical outcomes.

Arsalan M(1), Mack MJ.

Author information:
(1)Kerckhoff Heart Center, Bad Nauheim, Germany.

Over the last decade, transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has emerged 
to become the treatment of choice for inoperable patients and the preferred 
alternative for high-risk patients with severe, symptomatic aortic stenosis 
(AS). Questions about the long-term durability of TAVI valves were raised early 
in the history of the procedure. Although there has not yet been a significant 
signal of early structural valve deterioration (SVD), these concerns remain 
important today, especially if TAVI is to be considered for use in lower-risk 
and younger patients with longer life expectancy. Durability expectations for 
TAVI to some degree parallel those of surgical bioprostheses, but the different 
tissue, mounting design and crimping of TAVI devices might adversely influence 
long-term results. The experience with surgical bioprostheses has shown that 
deterioration of these valves is a slow and gradual process. Thus, despite 
promising midterm results of many surgical bioprostheses at five to seven years, 
design faults with higher failure rates have become manifest eight to 10 years 
after implantation. Similarly, although the initial five-year outcomes of TAVI 
are promising, these results cannot yet be extrapolated to predict long-term 
durability with any firm degree of assuredness, especially in younger patient 
populations. Thus, a high degree of caution is necessary when considering TAVI 
in intermediate-risk and younger patients until more evidence of durability 
equivalent to that of surgical bioprostheses is forthcoming.

A low birth rate in addition to an increasing life expectancy within the context 
of an aging population characterize the current demographic situation in 
Germany. Cancer is primarily a disease of old age and the frequency increases 
with an expanding older population. In 2013, cancer was the second most common 
cause of death in Germany. With the aid of screening examinations cancer should 
be detected in the early stages so that suitable therapeutic measures can be 
initiated. In Germany, screening is currently offered for breast, cervical, 
colorectal, skin and prostate cancer and is covered by the statutory health 
insurance. Mammography screening is the only organized screening program in 
Germany. Eligible women are regularly invited to attend this program, which is 
not the case for the other types of cancer screening. In accordance with the 
Cancer Screening and Registry Act (KFRG) of 2013, colorectal and cervical cancer 
screening will also be implemented as organized screening programs in the 
future. As is the case in the mammography screening program, those eligible to 
participate will receive an invitation letter and the new programs are to be 
continually monitored, documented and evaluated.

A regression method for modelling geometric rates.

Bottai M(1).

Author information:
(1)Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.

The occurrence of an event of interest over time is often summarized by the 
incidence rate, defined as the average number of events per person-time. This 
type of rate applies to events that may occur repeatedly over time on any given 
subject, such as infections, and Poisson regression represents a natural 
regression method for modelling the effect of covariates on it. However, for 
events that can occur only once, such as death, the geometric rate may be a 
better summary measure. The geometric rate has long been utilized in demography 
for studying the growth of populations and in finance to compute compound 
interest on capital. This type of rate, however, is virtually unknown to medical 
research. This may be partly a consequence of the lack of a regression method 
for it. This paper describes a regression method for modelling the effect of 
covariates on the geometric rate. The described method is based on applying 
quantile regression to a transform of the time-to-event variable. The proposed 
method is used to analyze mortality in a randomized clinical trial and in an 
observational epidemiological study.

BACKGROUND: More than 1·5 billion people are affected by schistosomiasis or 
soil-transmitted helminthiasis. WHO's recommendations for mass drug 
administration (MDA) against these parasitic infections emphasise treatment of 
school-aged children, using separate treatment guidelines for these two 
helminthiases groups. We aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of expanding 
integrated MDA to the entire community in four settings in Côte d'Ivoire.
METHODS: We extended previously published, dynamic, age-structured models of 
helminthiases transmission to simulate costs and disability averted with 
integrated MDA (of praziquantel and albendazole) for schistosomiasis and 
soil-transmitted helminthiasis. We calibrated the model to data for prevalence 
and intensity of species-specific helminth infection from surveys undertaken in 
four communities in Côte d'Ivoire between March, 1997, and September, 2010. We 
simulated a 15-year treatment programme with 75% coverage in only school-aged 
children; school-aged children and preschool-aged children; adults; and the 
entire community. Treatment costs were estimated at US$0·74 for school-aged 
children and $1·74 for preschool-aged children and adults. The incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated in 2014 US dollars per 
disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) averted.
FINDINGS: Expanded community-wide treatment was highly cost effective compared 
with treatment of only school-aged children (ICER $167 per DALY averted) and WHO 
guidelines (ICER $127 per DALY averted), and remained highly cost effective even 
if treatment costs for preschool-aged children and adults were ten times greater 
than those for school-aged children. Community-wide treatment remained highly 
cost effective even when elimination of helminth infections was not achieved. 
These findings were robust across the four diverse communities in Côte d'Ivoire, 
only one of which would have received annual MDA for both schistosomiasis and 
soil-transmitted helminthiasis under the latest WHO guidelines. Treatment every 
6 months was also highly cost effective in three out of four communities.
INTERPRETATION: Integrated, community-wide MDA programmes for schistosomiasis 
and soil-transmitted helminthiasis can be highly cost effective, even in 
communities with low disease burden in any helminth group. These results support 
an urgent need to re-evaluate current global guidelines for helminthiases 
control programmes to include community-wide treatment, increased treatment 
frequency, and consideration for lowered prevalence thresholds for integrated 
treatment.

Japan.

OBJECTIVE: Frailty is one of many serious problems in countries with aging 
populations, such as Japan. The aim of this study was to examine whether higher 
scores on the newly developed self-report questionnaire for frailty are 
associated with adults being certified as needing care under the new long-term 
care insurance (LTCI) service requirement, over 2 years in community-dwelling 
older Japanese adults.
DESIGN: A prospective cohort study.
SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: We analyzed the cohort data for older adults (65 years 
and older) from a prospective study. We followed 5852 older individuals for 2 
years and analyzed the association between higher frailty scores at baseline and 
new LTCI service requirement certifications.
OUTCOME: The outcome was new certifications for LTCI services in a 2-year 
period.
MEASUREMENTS: We developed the 5-item frailty screening index, which included 
nutrition/shrinking, physical function, physical activity, forgetfulness, and 
emotions/exhaustion.
RESULTS: The prevalence values for frailty and prefrailty using our frailty 
screening index were 12.5% and 54.1%, respectively. During the 2-year follow-up 
period, 2.3% died and 8.5% individuals became newly certified as needing LTCI 
services. Prefrail older adults (adjusted hazard ratio: 8.4 [95% CI 5.0-14.2]) 
and frail older adults (adjusted hazard ratio: 22.7 [95% CI 13.3-38.8]) had a 
significantly higher risk of needing LTCI services than robust older adults as 
determined by multivariate analyses.
CONCLUSION: The newly developed 5-item self-report questionnaire for frailty can 
predict disability in older Japanese adults.

BACKGROUND: Unemployment may be associated with health through factors including 
stress, depression, unhealthy behaviors, reduced health care, and loss of social 
networks. Little is known about associations of total lifetime unemployment with 
disability and life expectancy.
HYPOTHESIS: People with high unemployment (≥the median) will live shorter lives 
with more disability than those with less unemployment.
METHODS: Data were nationally representative of African Americans and 
non-Hispanic whites, from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (37 waves 
1968-2011, n = 7,970, mean work years = 24.7). Seven waves (1999-2011, 58,268 
person-years) measured disability in activities of daily living. We estimated 
monthly probabilities of disability and death associated with unemployment using 
multinomial logistic Markov models adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity, 
education, health status at baseline and throughout work life, and social 
support. We used the probabilities to create large populations with 
microsimulation, each individual having known monthly disability status, age 40 
to death. We analyzed the populations to measure outcomes.
RESULTS: Respectively for African American and white women and African American 
and white men, life expectancies (with 95% confidence intervals) from age 40 
with low unemployment were ages: 77.1 (75.0-78.3), 80.6 (78.4-81.4), 71.4 
(69.6-72.5), and 76.9 (74.9-77.9). Corresponding high unemployment results were: 
73.7 (71.7-75.0), 77.5 (75.1-78.0), 68.4 (66.8-69.0), and 73.7 (71.5-74.3). The 
percentage of life disabled from age 40 was greater with high unemployment for 
the same groups, by 23.9%, 21.0%, 21.3%, and 21.1% (all p < 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: High lifetime unemployment may be associated with a larger 
proportion of later life with disability and lower life expectancy.

BACKGROUND: Nowadays, nearly half of the world population lives in societies 
with low fertility or the below-replacement fertility. This potentially grounds 
the critical situation of reduction in the workforce and causes the aging of 
population due to an overall increase in life expectancy and standard of living. 
Hence, population and its transitions including the issue of fertility decline 
has become a topic of intense debate in the agenda-setting and policy-making 
processes in both the developed and developing countries. In this view, what can 
practically be done to respond to the fertility decline that entails effectively 
addressing the determinants of fertility change? In line with the literature, 
how people form their marriages or patterns of marriage is amongst influencing 
factors which potentially affect their reproductive practices as diverse 
societies recognize different conventions for marriage. This study is to examine 
women's reproductive practices by the various patterns of marriage using the 
explanatory sequential mixed methods design.
METHODS/DESIGN: This study has an explanatory sequential mixed methods design, 
the follow-up explanations variant model, with two strands. This design will be 
implemented in two distinct phases. In the first phase, a cross-sectional 
quantitative study will be done using a cluster sampling strategy on 850 married 
women 15-49 years old living in Babol city, Iran. In order to obtain a deeper 
understanding of the results of the quantitative phase, researchers will 
implement a qualitative research in the second phase of this study. This design 
will provide an explanation of the quantitative research results using the 
qualitative evidence.
DISCUSSION: As patterns of marriage have implications for the status of women, 
their health and fertility, the result of this study can provide a rich source 
of information for the required health-related interventions and policies are 
required to put the demographic changes on the right track at micro and macro 
level and improve the reproductive practices of women at micro level.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Three new oral anticoagulants (NOACs) are currently 
approved for stroke prevention and systemic embolism in patients with 
non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF). The objective of this analysis was to 
assess the cost effectiveness of apixaban against other NOACs for the prevention 
of stroke in patients with NVAF in Greece.
METHODS: A Markov model that evaluated clinical events, quality-adjusted life 
expectancy, and costs for patients treated with apixaban or other NOACs formed 
the basis of the analysis. Clinical events were modeled for a lifetime horizon, 
based on clinical efficacy data from an indirect comparison, using the 
ARISTOTLE, ROCKET-AF, and RE-LY clinical trials. Resource use associated with 
patient monitoring was elicited via a panel of experts (cardiologists and 
internists). Cost calculations reflect the local clinical setting and followed a 
third-party payer perspective (Euros, discounted at 3 %).
RESULTS: Apixaban was projected to reduce the occurrence of clinical events and 
increase quality-adjusted life expectancy and incremental costs of treatment 
compared with other NOACs. Taking into account costs of medications, patient 
monitoring, and management of events, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios 
for apixaban 5 mg twice daily vs. dabigatran 110 mg twice daily, dabigatran 150 
mg twice daily, and rivaroxaban 20 mg once daily were estimated at 
€9907/quality-adjusted life-year (QALY), €13,727/QALY, and €6936/QALY gained, 
respectively. Extensive sensitivity analyses indicated that results were robust 
over a wide range of inputs.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on the results of this analysis, apixaban can be a 
cost-effective alternative to other NOACs for the prevention of stroke in 
patients with NVAF in Greece.

INTRODUCTION: The optimal management for patients with diabetes and peripheral 
vascular disease-intermittent claudication or critical limb ischemia 
(CLI)-remains undetermined.
METHODS: In a single-center retrospective analysis, we compared 1- and 5-year 
amputation-free survival rates in patients undergoing angiography subsequently 
treated with medical therapy or revascularization.
RESULTS: 78 patients were included, 56 with CLI (mean age 77 years); 22 with 
claudication (mean age 75 years). Of the CLI cohort, 30 patients were medically 
treated. Their 1-year amputation-free survival rate was similar to those treated 
with revascularization (46.7% versus 50.0%, respectively). 8 patients in the 
claudicant cohort were treated conservatively. The 1-year amputation-free 
survival rate was 75.0% for conservative treatment versus 78.6% in those 
revascularized. Within the CLI cohort, in those conservatively treated 20% 
underwent major, and 16.7% minor amputations, compared to 15.4% and 23.1% in 
those revascularized. At 5 years in the claudicant cohort, the amputation-free 
survival rate was 37.5% with medical treatment, versus 71.4% for those treated 
with revascularization. For CLI, the 5-year amputation-free survival rate was 
10% for conservative treatment, versus 26.9% for revascularization.
CONCLUSION: We found similar rates of amputation at 1 year for patients treated 
medically or revascularized. However, at 5 years, the amputation-free survival 
rate was markedly higher in revascularized patients compared to those medically 
managed. Our study highlights the potential role of predicting life expectancy 
when considering treatment, with the option of surgical treatment offered to 
those in whom survival is predicted to be longer than 5 years. However, larger 
studies with matched cohorts are now needed to confirm these findings.

Docetaxel and cyclophosphamide (TC) is a widely used breast cancer adjuvant 
regimen. We sought to compare the rates of febrile neutropenia (FN) between 
patients receiving no primary prophylaxis (PP) and those receiving PP with 
either granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) or antibiotics. We also 
analyzed cost-effectiveness of TC with and without either G-CSF or antibiotics. 
Charts were reviewed of all 340 patients who received adjuvant TC between 
January 2008 and December 2012 at two major cancer centers. Rates of FN in the 
three groups - no PP, PP with G-CSF and PP with antibiotics were compared. A 
Markov model was constructed comparing cost-effectiveness of PP with G-CSF, PP 
with antibiotics, and secondary prophylaxis (SP) with G-CSF after an episode of 
FN in a previous cycle. Costs were based on actual resource utilization and 
supplemented by the published literature, adjusted to 2012 Canadian dollars. Of 
the 73 (21%) patients who did not receive any PP, 23 (32%) of patients developed 
FN. Of the 192 (57%) patients receiving PP with G-CSF alone, only two (1%; p < 
0.0001) developed FN; and of the 53 (16%) receiving PP with antibiotics alone, 
six (11%; p < 0.01) developed FN. From a cost-standpoint, PP with G-CSF was less 
cost-effective than PP with antibiotics. The rate of FN with TC chemotherapy 
exceeds 30%, and American Society of Clinical Oncology guidelines recommend PP 
with G-CSF in this situation. PP with antibiotics is more cost-effective, and is 
a reasonable option in resource-limited settings or for patients who decline or 
do not tolerate G-CSF.

Protein evolution is governed by processes that alter primary sequence but also 
the length of proteins. Protein length may change in different ways, but 
insertions, deletions and duplications are the most common. An optimal protein 
size is a trade-off between sequence extension, which may change protein 
stability or lead to acquisition of a new function, and shrinkage that decreases 
metabolic cost of protein synthesis. Despite the general tendency for length 
conservation across orthologous proteins, the propensity to accept insertions 
and deletions is heterogeneous along the sequence. For example, protein regions 
rich in repetitive peptide motifs are well known to extensively vary their 
length across species. Here, we analyze length conservation of coiled-coils, 
domains formed by an ubiquitous, repetitive peptide motif present in all domains 
of life, that frequently plays a structural role in the cell. We observed that, 
despite the repetitive nature, the length of coiled-coil domains is generally 
highly conserved throughout the tree of life, even when the remaining parts of 
the protein change, including globular domains. Length conservation is 
independent of primary amino acid sequence variation, and represents a 
conservation of domain physical size. This suggests that the conservation of 
domain size is due to functional constraints.

CONTEXT: Families are referred to pediatric palliative care (PPC) programs when 
a child is diagnosed with a medical condition associated with less than a full 
life expectancy. When a child dies, PPC programs typically offer a range of 
bereavement interventions to these families, often focusing on parents. 
Currently, it is unclear which factors increase the likelihood that bereaved 
siblings will experience negative outcomes, limiting the development of 
empirically supported interventions that can be delivered in PPC programs.
OBJECTIVES: The present study explored the relationship between parents' and 
surviving sibling's mental health symptoms (i.e., post-traumatic stress disorder 
[PTSD], prolonged grief disorder (PGD), and depression symptoms) after a child's 
death. Additionally, the extent to which parent functioning indirectly impacted 
sibling functioning through parenting behaviors (i.e., positive parenting and 
parent involvement) was also examined, with a specific focus on differences 
based on parent gender.
METHODS: Sixty bereaved parents and siblings (aged 8-18) who enrolled in a PPC 
program from 2008 to 2013 completed measures of PTSD, PGD, and depression 
related to the loss of a child/sibling. Siblings also completed a measure of 
general parenting behaviors.
RESULTS: Maternal, but not paternal, symptoms of PTSD and PGD were directly 
associated with sibling outcomes. Paternal symptoms were associated with sibling 
symptoms indirectly, through parenting behaviors (i.e., via decreasing positive 
parenting).
CONCLUSION: These results underscore the importance of examining both maternal 
and paternal influences after the death of a child, demonstrate differential 
impact of maternal vs. paternal symptoms on siblings, and stress the importance 
of addressing postloss symptoms from a family systems perspective.

OBJECTIVES: Physicians are expected to involve patients adequately in the 
decision-making process prior to surgery. To this end, it is essential to have 
knowledge about the potential reasons for such a decision. In this study we 
investigated which information sources and decision criteria are important to 
patients prior to aortic valve surgery.
METHODS: A consecutive sample of 468 patients (70.1%m, aged 66.9±14.2 years) was 
examined 2 years after aortic valve replacement or reconstruction with a 
self-developed questionnaire.
RESULTS: Preoperative discussion with a cardiologist or a cardiac surgeon was 
the information source patients used most frequently and felt to be the most 
helpful. The most important decision criterion was quality of life, followed by 
life expectancy and likelihood of reoperation. Two years postoperatively, 97.3% 
of the patients were satisfied with their decision.
CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative counseling by a physician plays an essential role in 
the decision-making process prior to cardiac surgery. Patients want to be 
involved in decision-making, though they do not want to bear the full 
responsibility.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease affecting 
approximately 26 million people world-wide, and the number is increasing as life 
expectancy increases. Since the only reliable diagnosis for the pathology is 
histochemical post-mortem examination, there is a rather urgent need for 
reliable, sensitive and quick detection techniques. Amyloid beta, being one of 
the established and widely accepted biomarkers of AD is a target biomolecule. 
Herein, we present fabrication of a labelless impedimetric amyloid beta 
immunosensor on carbon DEP (disposable electrochemical printed) chip. Three 
types of amyloid β impedimetric immunosensors were fabricated in a systematic 
step-wise manner in order to understand the effects that each surface 
modification chemistry had on detection sensitivity. We found that compared to a 
bare electrode, surface modification through formation of SAM of AuNPs increased 
sensitivity by approximately three orders of magnitude (LoD from 2.04 μM to 
2.65 nM). A further modification using protein G, which helps orientate 
antibodies to an optimum position for interaction with antigen, lowered the LoD 
further to 0.57 nM. We have demonstrated that the presence of one of the most 
abundance proteins in biological fluids, bovine serum albumin (BSA), did not 
interfere with the sensitivity of the sensor. Since the DEP chips are disposable 
and the detection platform label-free, the developed sensor is relatively fast 
and cheap. These methods could easily be applied for detection of other 
antigens, with selection of the detection platform based on the desired for 
sensitivity.

Patients affected by psychotic disorders are more likely to develop high rates 
of co-morbidities, such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemias, 
hypertension, metabolic syndrome, myocardial infarction, stroke etc., in the 
long-term. These morbidities have a significant impact on the life-expectancy of 
these patients. Patients with chronic psychoses show a 2-3-fold increased risk 
of death mostly from cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. Although there may 
be an independent link, between schizophrenia and metabolic conditions the 
cardio-metabolic risk is mostly related to an unhealthy lifestyle and the usage 
of antipsychotic agents (especially Second Generation Antipsychotics or 
atypical) even when these remain effective treatments in the management of major 
psychoses. Recently, many international organizations have developed screening 
and monitoring guidelines for the control of modifiable risk factors in order to 
reduce the rate of co-morbidity and mortality among patients affected by 
schizophrenia. This paper is a review of current knowledge about the metabolic 
issues of patients affected by schizophrenia and describes clinical 
characteristics and medical management strategies for such conditions.
