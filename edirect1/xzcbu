Total joint arthroplasty is one of the most common surgical procedures performed 
for end-stage osteoarthritis. The increasing demand for knee and hip 
arthroplasties along with the improvement in life expectancy has created a 
substantial medical and economic impact on the society. Effective planning of 
health care for these individuals is vital. The best method for providing 
anesthesia and analgesia for total joint arthroplasty has not been defined. Yet, 
emerging evidence suggests that the type of anesthesia can affect morbidity and 
mortality of patients undergoing these procedures.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Oral direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) for hepatitis C virus 
(HCV) treatment offer new hope to both pre- and post-liver transplant (LT) 
patients. However, whether to treat HCV patients before vs after LT is not clear 
because treatment can improve liver function but could reduce the chance of 
receiving an LT while on the waiting list. Our objective was to evaluate the 
cost effectiveness of pre-LT vs post-LT HCV treatment with oral DAAs in 
decompensated cirrhotic patients on the LT waiting list.
METHODS: We used a validated mathematical model that simulated a virtual trial 
comparing long-term clinical and cost outcomes of pre-LT vs post-LT HCV 
treatment with oral DAAs. Model parameters were estimated from United Network 
for Organ Sharing data, SOLAR-1 and 2 trials, and published studies. For each 
strategy, we estimated the quality-adjusted life-year, life expectancy, cost, 
and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio.
RESULTS: For lower MELD scores, quality-adjusted life-years were higher with 
pre-LT HCV treatment compared with post-LT treatment. Pre-LT HCV treatment was 
cost saving in patients with MELD scores of 15 or less, and cost effective in 
patients with MELD scores of 16 to 21. In contrast, post-LT HCV treatment was 
cost effective in patients with MELD scores of 22 to 29 and cost saving if MELD 
scores were 30 or higher. Results varied by drug prices and by United Network 
for Organ Sharing regions.
CONCLUSIONS: For cirrhotic patients awaiting LT, pre-LT HCV treatment with DAAs 
is cost effective/saving in patients with MELD scores of 21 or lower, whereas 
post-LT HCV treatment is cost effective/saving in patients with MELD scores of 
22 or higher.

Plant cryptochromes (cry) act as UV-A/blue light receptors. The prototype, 
Arabidopsis thaliana cry1, regulates several light responses during the life 
cycle, including de-etiolation, and is also involved in regulating flowering 
time. The cry1 photocycle is initiated by light absorption by its FAD 
chromophore, which is most likely fully oxidized (FADox) in the dark state and 
photoreduced to the neutral flavin semiquinone (FADH°) in its lit state. 
Cryptochromes lack the DNA-repair activity of the closely related DNA 
photolyases, but they retain the ability to bind nucleotides such as ATP. The 
previously characterized L407F mutant allele of Arabidopsis cry1 is biologically 
hyperactive and seems to mimic the ATP-bound state of cry1, but the reason for 
this phenotypic change is unclear. Here, we show that cry1L407F can still bind 
ATP, has less pronounced photoreduction and formation of FADH° than wild-type 
cry1, and has a dark reversion rate 1.7 times lower than that of the wild type. 
The hyperactivity of cry1L407F is not related to a higher FADH° occupancy of the 
photoreceptor but is caused by a structural alteration close to the ATP-binding 
site. Moreover, we show that ATP binds to cry1 in both the dark and the lit 
states. This binding was not affected by cry1's C-terminal extension, which is 
important for signal transduction. Finally, we show that a recently discovered 
chemical inhibitor of cry1, 3-bromo-7-nitroindazole, competes for ATP binding 
and thereby diminishes FADH° formation, which demonstrates that both processes 
are important for cry1 function.

Type 1 diabetes is an auto-immune disease resulting in the loss of pancreatic 
β-cells and, consequently, in chronic hyperglycemia. Insulin supplementation 
allows diabetic patients to control their glycaemia quite efficiently, but 
treated patients still display an overall shortened life expectancy and an 
altered quality of life as compared to their healthy counterparts. In this 
context and due to the ever increasing number of diabetics, establishing 
alternative therapies has become a crucial research goal. Most current efforts 
therefore aim at generating fully functional insulin-secreting β-like cells 
using multiple approaches. In this review, we screened the literature published 
since 2011 and inventoried the selected markers used to characterize 
insulin-secreting cells generated by in vitro differentiation of stem/precursor 
cells or by means of in vivo transdifferentiation. By listing these features, we 
noted important discrepancies when comparing the different approaches for the 
initial characterization of insulin-producing cells as true β-cells. Considering 
the recent advances achieved in this field of research, the necessity to 
establish strict guidelines has become a subject of crucial importance, 
especially should one contemplate the next step, which is the transplantation of 
in vitro or ex vivo generated insulin-secreting cells in type 1 diabetic 
patients.

To Use or Not to Use Metformin in Cerebral Ischemia: A Review of the Application 
of Metformin in Stroke Rodents.

Cali, Colombia.

Ischemic strokes are major causes of death and disability. Searching for 
potential therapeutic strategies to prevent and treat stroke is necessary, given 
the increase in overall life expectancy. Epidemiological reports indicate that 
metformin is an oral antidiabetic medication that can reduce the incidence of 
ischemic events in patients with diabetes mellitus. Its mechanism of action has 
not been elucidated, but metformin pleiotropic effects involve actions in 
addition to glycemic control. AMPK activation has been described as one of the 
pharmacological mechanisms that explain the action of metformin and that lead to 
neuroprotective effects. Most experiments done in the cerebral ischemia model, 
via middle cerebral artery occlusion in rodents (MCAO), had positive results 
favoring metformin's neuroprotective role and involve several cellular pathways 
like oxidative stress, endothelial nitric oxide synthase activation, activation 
of angiogenesis and neurogenesis, autophagia, and apoptosis. We will review the 
pharmacological properties of metformin and its possible mechanisms that lead to 
neuroprotection in cerebral ischemia.

In 2014, the USA spent $3 trillion dollars in health care the most per capita in 
the world. However, the USA lacks universal health coverage, and lags behind 
other highly developed and wealthy countries in life expectancy (even some "non 
wealthy" countries have better outcomes). The USA also has deficits in other 
health outcome measures. Health care costs in the USA continue to rise annually 
and many patients receive only mediocre care. In addition, clear disparities 
exist across different communities, socioeconomic groups, and race and ethnicity 
groups. As a result, individuals with mental illness are at an increased risk of 
being homeless, committing suicide, and having problems maintaining a job. This 
paper will address mental health disparities and review the efforts some states 
are taking to improve the lifesaving services offered to citizens with mental 
illness, in order for them to recover and reach their full potentials.

PURPOSE: Despite the well-established health effects of socioeconomic status 
(SES), SES resources such as employment may differently influence health 
outcomes across sub-populations. This study used a national sample of US adults 
to test if the effect of baseline employment (in 1986) on all-cause mortality 
over a 25-year period depends on race, gender, education level, and their 
intersections.
METHODS: Data came from the Americans' Changing Lives (ACL) study, which 
followed 2025 Whites and 1156 Blacks for 25 years from 1986 to 2011. The focal 
predictor of interest was baseline employment (1986), operationalized as a 
dichotomous variable. The main outcome of interest was time to all-cause 
mortality from 1986 to 2011. Covariates included baseline age, health behaviors 
(smoking, drinking, and exercise), physical health (obesity, chronic disease, 
function, and self-rated health), and mental health (depressive symptoms). A 
series of Cox proportional hazard models were used to test the association 
between employment and mortality risk in the pooled sample and based on race, 
gender, education, and their intersections.
RESULTS: Baseline employment in 1986 was associated with a lower risk of 
mortality over a 25-year period, net of covariates. In the pooled sample, 
baseline employment interacted with race (HR = .69, 95% CI = .49-.96), gender 
(HR = .73, 95% CI = .53-1.01), and education (HR = .64, 95% CI = .46-.88) on 
mortality, suggesting diminished protective effects for Blacks, women, and 
individuals with lower education, compared to Whites, men, and those with higher 
education. In stratified models, the association was significant for Whites 
(HR = .71, 95%CI = .59-.90), men (HR = .60, 95%CI = .43-.83), and individuals 
with high education (HR = .66, 95%CI = .50-.86) but not for Blacks (HR = .77, 
95%CI = .56-1.01), women (HR = .88, 95%CI = .69-1.12), and those with low 
education (HR = .92, 95%CI = .67-1.26). The largest effects of employment on 
life expectancy were seen for highly educated men (HR = .50, 95%CI = .32-.78), 
White men (HR = .55, 95%CI = .38-.79), and highly educated Whites (HR = .63, 
95%CI = .46-.84). The effects were non-significant for Black men (HR = 1.10, 
95%CI = .68-1.78), Whites with low education (HR = 1.01, 95%CI = .67-1.51), and 
women with low education (HR = 1.06, 95%CI = .71-1.57).
CONCLUSION: In the USA, the health gain associated with employment is 
conditional on one's race, gender, and education level, along with their 
intersections. Blacks, women, and individuals with lower education gain less 
from employment than do Whites, men, and highly educated people. More research 
is needed to understand how the intersections of race, gender, and education 
alter health gains associated with socioeconomic resources.

PURPOSE: Dairy products are rich in nutrients that positively influence bone 
health and hence fracture risk, and have therefore been recommended and used for 
fracture prevention. To help decision makers to efficiently allocate scare 
resources, it is further important to assess the public health and economic 
impact of any health intervention. In recent years, several studies have been 
conducted to estimate the public health and/or economic impact of dairy products 
but no overview is currently available. This article aims therefore to summarize 
evidence and review articles that estimated the public health and/or economic 
impact of vitamin D-fortified dairy products for fracture prevention.
METHODS: A literature review was conducted using PubMed to identify original 
studies that assessed the public health and/or economic impact of dairy products 
(or of calcium/vitamin D supplementation) for fracture prevention up to January 
15, 2017.
RESULTS: Seven articles were identified. Different strategies were used by the 
authors to model the economic/public health impact of dairy products. The four 
studies assessing the public health impact of dairy products revealed a 
substantial benefit in terms of fracture prevented, life years, 
disability-adjusted life years and/or quality-adjusted life years gained. 
Studies assessing the cost-effectiveness revealed that the use of dairy products 
is generally cost-effective in the general population aged above 70 years, and 
from the age of 60 years in populations at high risk of fractures.
CONCLUSION: This systematic review suggests that the use of dairy products could 
substantially reduce the burden of osteoporotic fractures and seem to be an 
economically beneficial strategy.

Metal-mediated base pairs have been extensively utilized in many research 
fields, including genetic-code extension, novel therapeutics development, and 
nanodevice design. Compared to other cations, AgI is more flexible in pairing 
with natural base pairs. Herein, we present a DNA structure containing two C-AgI 
-C pairs and the first reported G-AgI -G pair in a short 8mer DNA strand. This 
structure not only provides detailed insight into these AgI -mediated 
base-pairing patterns in DNA, but also represents the first nonhelical DNA 
structure driven by heavy-metal ions, thus further contributing to the 
structural diversity of DNA. This unique complex structure is highly 
sequence-dependent, thus implying functional potentials as a new DNA aptamer 
that can bind and recognize silver ions. These results not only advance our 
understanding of the interactions between AgI and nucleobases, but also provide 
a unique structural component for the rational design of new DNA nanodevices.

highly active relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis in the UK: re-treatment, 
discount, and disutility.

OBJECTIVE: Patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) treated 
with disease modifying therapies (DMTs) who continue to experience disease 
activity may be considered for escalation therapies such as fingolimod, or may 
be considered for alemtuzumab. Previous economic modeling used Markov models; 
applying one alternative technique, discrete event simulation (DES) modeling, 
allows re-treatment and long-term adverse events (AEs) to be included in the 
analysis.
METHODS: A DES was adapted to model relapse-triggered re-treatment with 
alemtuzumab and the effect of including ongoing quality-adjusted life year 
(QALY) decrements for AEs that extend beyond previous 1-year Markov cycles. As 
the price to the NHS of fingolimod in the UK is unknown, due to a confidential 
patient access scheme (PAS), a variety of possible discounts were tested. The 
interaction of re-treatment assumptions for alemtuzumab with the possible 
discounts for fingolimod was tested to determine which DMT resulted in lower 
lifetime costs. The lifetime QALY results were derived from modeled treatment 
effect and short- and long-term AEs.
RESULTS: Most permutations of fingolimod PAS discount and alemtuzumab 
re-treatment rate resulted in fingolimod being less costly than alemtuzumab. As 
the percentage of patients who are re-treated with alemtuzumab due to 
experiencing a relapse approaches 100% of those who relapse whilst on treatment, 
the discount required for fingolimod to be less costly drops below 5%. 
Consideration of treatment effect alone found alemtuzumab generated 0.2 more 
QALYs/patient; the inclusion of AEs up to a duration of 1 year reduced this 
advantage to only 0.14 QALYs/patient. Modeling AEs with a lifetime QALY 
decrement found that both DMTs generated very similar QALYs with the difference 
only 0.04 QALYs/patient.
CONCLUSIONS: When the model captured alemtuzumab re-treatment and long-term AE 
decrements, it was found that fingolimod is cost-effective compared to 
alemtuzumab, assuming application of only a modest level of confidential PAS 
discount.

This study quantified lower-limb strength decrements and assessed the 
relationships between strength decrements and performance fatigue during 
simulated basketball. Ten adolescent, male basketball players completed a 
circuit-based, basketball simulation. Sprint and jump performance were assessed 
during each circuit, with knee flexion and extension peak concentric torques 
measured at baseline, half-time, and full-time. Decrement scores were calculated 
for all measures. Mean knee flexor strength decrement was significantly 
(P < 0.05) related to sprint fatigue in the first half (R = 0.65), with dominant 
knee flexor strength (R = 0.67) and dominant flexor:extensor strength ratio 
(R = 0.77) decrement significantly (P < 0.05) associated with sprint decrement 
across the entire game. Mean knee extensor strength (R = 0.71), dominant knee 
flexor strength (R = 0.80), non-dominant knee flexor strength (R = 0.75), mean 
knee flexor strength (R = 0.81), non-dominant flexor:extensor strength ratio 
(R = 0.71), and mean flexor:extensor strength ratio (R = 0.70) decrement 
measures significantly (P < 0.05) influenced jump fatigue during the entire 
game. Lower-limb strength decrements may exert an important influence on 
performance fatigue during basketball activity in adolescent, male players. 
Consequently, training plans should aim to mitigate lower-limb fatigue to 
optimise sprint and jump performance during game-play.

BACKGROUND: The excess mortality in schizophrenia is still a phenomenon 
insufficiently studied on the cross-national level. It is important to analyse 
current studies on morality in schizophrenia since significant changes have 
recently taken place in psychiatric health care systems and guidelines of 
pharmacological treatment have been developed in European countries.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: This article reviews studies addressing mortality in 
schizophrenia in Europe that were published in English in the Pubmed database in 
2009-2014. It aimed at determining countries where studies were conducted, 
methodologies and tools used, and current main mortality rates, as well as 
direction of causality in this group of patients.
RESULTS: The recently published studies were conducted only in few European 
countries. The majority of data was obtained from general medical records and 
death records. The studies indicate that schizophrenia patients are 
characterized by higher mortality rate than the general population, with natural 
causes (cardiovascular diseases and cancers) and suicides predominating. The 
increasing mortality gap with significantly shorter life expectancy of patients 
with schizophrenia in comparison with the general population is considerable.
CONCLUSIONS: Death records are a crucial tool in studies on mortality in 
schizophrenia patients; however they are insufficiently employed. Recent 
European reports do not show positive tendencies, indicating that standardized 
mortality rates in schizophrenia remain on the same level or even increase, 
particularly for deaths resulting from natural causes. Due to various 
methodologies used in studies, their direct comparison is difficult. This 
limitation warrants further discussion on methods used in future studies on 
schizophrenia mortality in Europe.

BACKGROUND: Sunitinib and pazopanib are the only two targeted therapies for the 
first-line treatment of locally advanced or metastatic renal cell carcinoma 
(mRCC) recommended by the United Kingdom's National Institute for Health and 
Care Excellence. Pazopanib demonstrated non-inferior efficacy and a 
differentiated safety profile versus sunitinib in the phase III COMPARZ trial. 
The current analysis provides a direct comparison of the cost-effectiveness of 
pazopanib versus sunitinib from the perspective of the United Kingdom's National 
Health Service based on data from COMPARZ and other sources.
METHODS: A partitioned-survival analysis model with three health states (alive 
with no progression, alive with progression, or dead) was used to estimate the 
incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained for pazopanib 
versus sunitinib over five years (duration of follow-up for final survival 
analysis in COMPARZ). The proportion of patients in each health state over time 
was based on Kaplan-Meier distributions for progression-free and overall 
survival from COMPARZ. Utility values were based on EQ-5D data from the pivotal 
study of pazopanib versus placebo. Costs were based on medical resource 
utilisation data from COMPARZ and unit costs from secondary sources. 
Probabilistic and deterministic sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess 
uncertainty of model results.
RESULTS: In the base case, pazopanib was estimated to provide more QALYs 
(0.0565, 95% credible interval [CrI]: -0.0920 to 0.2126) at a lower cost 
(-£1,061, 95% CrI: -£4,328 to £2,067) versus sunitinib. The probability that 
pazopanib yields more QALYs than sunitinib was estimated to be 76%. For a 
threshold value of £30,000 per QALY gained, the probability that pazopanib is 
cost-effective versus sunitinib was estimated to be 95%. Pazopanib was dominant 
in most scenarios examined in deterministic sensitivity analyses.
CONCLUSIONS: Pazopanib is likely to be a cost-effective treatment option 
compared with sunitinib as first-line treatment of mRCC in the United Kingdom.

We merge two methodologies, prospective measures of population aging and 
probabilistic population forecasts. We compare the speed of change and 
variability in forecasts of the old age dependency ratio and the prospective old 
age dependency ratio as well as the same comparison for the median age and the 
prospective median age. While conventional measures of population aging are 
computed on the basis of the number of years people have already lived, 
prospective measures are computed also taking account of the expected number of 
years they have left to live. Those remaining life expectancies change over time 
and differ from place to place. We compare the probabilistic distributions of 
the conventional and prospective measures using examples from China, Germany, 
Iran, and the United States. The changes over time and the variability of the 
prospective indicators are smaller than those that are observed in the 
conventional ones. A wide variety of new results emerge from the combination of 
methodologies. For example, for Germany, Iran, and the United States the 
likelihood that the prospective median age of the population in 2098 will be 
lower than it is today is close to 100 percent.

AIM: This study examined the outputs of research papers in diabetes from 31 
European countries between 2002 and 2013, and their funding.
METHODS: Diabetes research papers in the Web of Science were identified by means 
of a filter based on journals and title words. For 2009-2013 papers, the funders 
were coded to show their sector and nationality.
RESULTS: Europe published 40 547 diabetes papers in the 12 years between 2002 
and 2013. Denmark, Sweden and Finland published the most relative to their 
wealth, but the UK published the most absolutely despite an apparently low 
burden (as measured by disability-adjusted life years). The largest source of 
funding was government (30%), followed by the non-profit sector (18%) and 
industry (13%). The European Commission supported 2.7% of papers, but more in 
Latvia (33%) and Estonia (16%). Based on an estimated cost per paper of €260 
000, the annual research expenditure in Europe was approximately €986 million in 
2013.
CONCLUSIONS: The European diabetes burden in disability-adjusted life years 
increased by one third between 2002 and 2012, but its output of research papers 
has decreased from 44% to 36% of the world total. This decrease needs to be 
reviewed in the context of European non-communicable disease research policy.

PURPOSE: To investigate the feasibility of a novel client-centered cognitive 
strategy training intervention for people with Parkinson's disease (PD).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a case series of seven people with PD without 
dementia but with subjective cognitive decline. The intervention involved ≥5 
treatment sessions at the participant's home. Participant acceptance and 
engagement were assessed by the Credibility/Expectancy Questionnaire (CEQ), 
Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ), enjoyment and effort ratings, and 
homework completion. Logistical information was tracked, and the Canadian 
Occupational Performance Measure (COPM) was an exploratory outcome measure. Data 
analysis was descriptive.
RESULTS: CEQ scores were positive and increased over time. CSQ scores were high 
(M = 30.8, SD = 0.75), with all participants rating all items positively. Almost 
all (95%) effort and enjoyment ratings were ≥3 (Much), and homework completion 
rates averaged 84% (SD = 18). Intervention duration was 6-15 weeks (M = 9.2, 
SD = 2.8), with treatment sessions averaging 1.7 h (SD = 0.5). Group and most 
individual COPM ratings improved ≥2 points.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings support the feasibility of the intervention for 
people with PD. It was acceptable, engaging, and promising in terms of its 
effect on self-identified functional cognitive problems. Implications for 
Rehabilitation People with Parkinson's disease (PD) without dementia can 
experience cognitive decline that negatively impacts function and quality of 
life. Strategy-based interventions that explicitly train for transfer may 
mitigate the negative functional consequences of cognitive decline in this 
population. We developed a client-centered cognitive strategy training 
intervention for people with PD. This small case series supports its 
feasibility, indicating that it is acceptable and engaging for people with PD 
and promising in terms of its effect on self-identified functional cognitive 
problems.

BACKGROUND: The cells of the mesencephalic trigeminal nucleus (MTN) are the 
proprioceptive sensory neurons that innervate the jaw closing muscles. These 
cells differentiate close to the two key signalling centres that influence the 
dorsal midbrain, the isthmus, which mediates its effects via FGF and WNT 
signalling and the roof plate, which is a major source of BMP signalling as well 
as WNT signalling.
METHODS: In this study, we have set out to analyse the importance of FGF, WNT 
and BMP signalling for the development of the MTN. We have employed 
pharmacological inhibitors of these pathways in explant cultures as well as 
utilising the electroporation of inhibitory constructs in vivo in the chick 
embryo.
RESULTS: We find that interfering with either FGF or WNT signalling has 
pronounced effects on MTN development whilst abrogation of BMP signalling has no 
effect. We show that treatment of explants with either FGF or WNT antagonists 
results in the generation of fewer MTN neurons and affects MTN axon extension 
and that inhibition of both these pathways has an additive effect. To complement 
these studies, we have used in vivo electroporation to inhibit BMP, FGF and WNT 
signalling within dorsal midbrain cells prior to, and during, their 
differentiation as MTN neurons. Again, we find that inhibition of BMP signalling 
has no effect on the development of MTN neurons. We additionally find that cells 
electroporated with inhibitory constructs for either FGF or WNT signalling can 
differentiate as MTN neurons suggesting that these pathways are not required 
cell intrinsically for the emergence of these neurons. Indeed, we also show that 
explants of dorsal mesencephalon lacking both the isthmus and roof plate can 
generate MTN neurons. However, we did find that inhibiting FGF or WNT signalling 
had consequences for MTN differentiation.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the emergence of MTN neurons is an 
intrinsic property of the dorsal mesencephalon of gnathostomes, and that this 
population undergoes expansion, and maturation, along with the rest of the 
dorsal midbrain under the influence of FGF and WNT signalling.

Objective To quantify the impact of cancer (all cancers combined and major 
sites) compared with cardiovascular disease (CVD) on longevity worldwide during 
1981-2010.Design Retrospective demographic analysis using aggregated 
data.Setting National civil registration systems in member states of the World 
Health Organization.Participants 52 populations with moderate to high quality 
data on cause specific mortality.Main outcome measures Disease specific 
contributions to changes in life expectancy in ages 40-84 (LE40-84) over time in 
populations grouped by two levels of Human Development Index (HDI) 
values.Results Declining CVD mortality rates during 1981-2010 contributed to, on 
average, over half of the gains in LE40-84; the corresponding gains were 2.3 
(men) and 1.7 (women) years, and 0.5 (men) and 0.8 (women) years in very high 
and medium and high HDI populations, respectively. Declines in cancer mortality 
rates contributed to, on average, 20% of the gains in LE40-84, or 0.8 (men) and 
0.5 (women) years in very high HDI populations, and to over 10% or 0.2 years 
(both sexes) in medium and high HDI populations. Declining lung cancer mortality 
rates brought about the largest LE40-84 gain in men in very high HDI populations 
(up to 0.7 years in the Netherlands), whereas in medium and high HDI populations 
its contribution was smaller yet still positive. Among women, declines in breast 
cancer mortality rates were largely responsible for the improvement in 
longevity, particularly among very high HDI populations (up to 0.3 years in the 
United Kingdom). In contrast, losses in LE40-84 were observed in many medium and 
high HDI populations as a result of increasing breast cancer mortality 
rates.Conclusions The control of CVD has led to substantial gains in LE40-84 
worldwide. The inequality in improvement in longevity attributed to declining 
cancer mortality rates reflects inequities in implementation of cancer control, 
particularly in less resourced populations and in women. Global actions are 
needed to revitalize efforts for cancer control, with a specific focus on less 
resourced countries.

Age-related deterioration in physical and oral health reduces healthy life 
expectancy and is thus an important problem for very elderly people. We 
investigated the effects of satisfaction with dietary life (SDL) in everyday 
life on oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) and subjective well-being 
and examined associations between these factors. We evaluated 426 elders aged 85 
years or older. All participants completed a questionnaire that inquired about 
age, gender, drinking status, body mass index, cognitive function, disability, 
and comorbidities, among other covariates. Oral, physical, and mental health 
conditions were also examined. Associations of questionnaire results for SDL 
with items on subjective well-being (Philadelphia Geriatric Center Morale Scale 
[PGC] and World Health Organization-5 [WHO-5]) and OHRQoL (Geriatric Oral Health 
Assessment Index [GOHAI]) were confirmed with multiple logistic regression 
analysis. In a multivariate model adjusted for various confounders, participants 
with self-reported "enjoyable" SDL had significantly lower risks for having the 
lowest scores on the GOHAI, PGC, and WHO-5 (odds ratio [OR] = 0.460, 95% 
confidence interval [CI] = 0.277-0.762; OR = 0.589, 95% CI = 0.348-0.996; and OR 
= 0.452, 95% CI = 0.263-0.775, respectively). These associations remained after 
further adjustment for number of teeth.

India.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a systemic disease of unknown aetiology 
with variable course and prognosis. Lupus nephritis (LN) is one of the important 
disease manifestations of SLE with considerable influence on patient outcomes. 
Immunosuppression therapy has made it possible to control the disease with 
improved life expectancy and quality of life. In the last few decades, various 
studies across the globe have clarified the role, dose and duration of 
immunosuppression currently in use and also provided evidence for new agents 
such as mycophenolate mofetil, calcineurin inhibitors and rituximab. However, 
there is still a need to develop new and specific therapy with less adverse 
effects. In this review, the current evidence of the treatment of LN and its 
evolution, and new classification criteria for SLE have been discussed. Also, 
rationale for low-dose intravenous cyclophosphamide as induction agent followed 
by azathioprine as maintenance agent has been provided with emphasis on 
individualized and holistic approach.
