Breast cancer was the most diagnosed malignant neoplasm and the second leading 
cause of cancer mortality among Chinese females in 2020. Increased risk factors 
and widespread adoption of westernized lifestyles have resulted in an upward 
trend in the occurrence of breast cancer. Up to date knowledge on the incidence, 
mortality, survival, and burden of breast cancer is essential for optimized 
cancer prevention and control. To better understand the status of breast cancer 
in China, this narrative literature review collected data from multiple sources, 
including studies obtained from the PubMed database and text references, 
national annual cancer report, government cancer database, Global Cancer 
Statistics 2020, and Global Burden of Disease study (2019). This review provides 
an overview of the incidence, mortality, and survival rates of breast cancer, as 
well as a summary of disability-adjusted life years associated with breast 
cancer in China from 1990 to 2019, with comparisons to Japan, South Korea, 
Australia and the United States.

In the last years, with the increase in the average life expectancy, the world's 
population is progressively aging, which entails social, health and economic 
problems. In this sense, the need to better understand the physiology of the 
aging process becomes an urgent need. Since the study of aging in humans is 
challenging, cellular and animal models are widely used as alternatives. Omics, 
namely metabolomics, have emerged in the study of aging, with the aim of 
biomarker discovering, which may help to uncomplicate this complex process. This 
paper aims to summarize different models used for aging studies with their 
advantages and limitations. Also, this review gathers the published articles 
referring to biomarkers of aging already discovered using metabolomics 
approaches, comparing the results obtained in the different studies. Finally, 
the most frequently used senescence biomarkers are described, along with their 
importance in understanding aging.

cost-effectiveness: a hypothetical disease-agnostic model.

AIMS: Assessing the value of single or short-term therapies (SSTs) within 
traditional cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs) has been a topic of discussion as 
the number of SSTs increases, particularly regarding the effect of discounting 
on valuation. To quantify the impact of discounting in economic evaluations, a 
CEA of a hypothetical SST and equivalent chronic therapy was conducted using 
standard methods.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A lifetime Markov model was developed for a hypothetical 
chronic, progressive disease that could be treated with an SST, chronic therapy, 
or no novel treatment, termed standard of care (SoC). Incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) with quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) 
comparing SST vs. SoC and an equivalent chronic therapy vs. SoC were assessed 
from a payer perspective. Both treatments had equal benefits and undiscounted 
lifetime costs; 3% discounting was applied to costs/benefits in the base case, 
and the impact of discounting was assessed.
RESULTS: In the base case example, both the SST and equivalent chronic therapy 
vs. SoC had ICERs of $86,000/QALY without discounting. With 3% discounting, the 
ICER for the SST increased by 116% ($186,000/QALY) while the ICER for the 
chronic therapy increased by 10% ($95,000/QALY) despite equal clinical benefit. 
In scenario analyses, the ICER of the SST was consistently higher than the 
equivalent chronic therapy across a range of assumptions/inputs. Varying the 
cost/benefit discount rates had a greater impact on the SST. Differences in the 
ICERs between the therapies increased with increasing life expectancy/time 
horizon.
LIMITATIONS: The simple model structure may not be reflective of acute or more 
complex diseases. Also, the scenario of perfect equivalency in efficacy and 
lifetime costs is hypothetical.
CONCLUSIONS: This quantitative assessment showed the extent to which SST CEAs 
are highly sensitive to discounting, resulting in worse value assessments for 
SSTs than equivalent chronic therapies.

Rehabilitation is important in the care of patients with cancer for improving 
function, pain, and quality of life. However, only a small number of clinicians 
are formally trained in cancer rehabilitation. Virtual learning environments may 
play a promising role in cancer rehabilitation education, especially in the 
coronavirus pandemic era where in-person learning is not readily available. A 
national, interprofessional cancer rehabilitation education program involving a 
monthly longitudinal webinar series and a 2-day virtual bootcamp was developed 
through the US Department of Veterans Affairs Extension for Community Healthcare 
Outcomes to improve Department of Veterans Affairs clinician understanding of 
cancer rehabilitation and ultimately increase the availability of cancer 
rehabilitation services in the Veterans Health Administration. From March 2020 
to July 2022, 923 individuals participated with an average of 72 participants 
per session and 204 participants per session in the bootcamp. Participants' most 
common disciplines were physical therapy, occupational therapy, nursing, 
medicine (physicians), advanced practice providers, speech therapy, and 
pharmacy. Participants reported improved knowledge of cancer rehabilitation and 
anticipated that the knowledge would change their practice. Virtual education 
can be a useful means to educate Department of Veterans Affairs-based healthcare 
professionals about cancer rehabilitation and improve access to rehabilitation 
services for veterans with cancer.

Current measures of population health lack indicators capturing the variability 
in age-at-morbidity onset, an important marker to assess the timing patterns of 
individuals' health deterioration and evaluate the compression of morbidity. We 
provide global, regional, and national estimates of the variability in morbidity 
onset from 1990 to 2019 using indicators of healthy lifespan inequality (HLI). 
Using data from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019, we reconstruct 
age-at-death distributions to calculate lifespan inequality (LI), and 
age-at-morbidity onset distributions to calculate HLI. We measure LI and HLI 
with the standard deviation. Between 1990 and 2019, global HLI decreased from 
24.74 years to 21.92, and has been decreasing in all regions except in 
high-income countries, where it has remained stable. Countries with high HLI are 
more present in sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia, whereas low HLI values are 
predominant in high-income countries and central and eastern Europe. HLI tends 
to be higher for females than for males, and HLI tends to be higher than LI. 
Globally, between 1990 and 2019 HLI at age 65 increased from 6.83 years to 7.44 
for females, and from 6.23 to 6.96 for males. Improvements in longevity are not 
necessarily accompanied by further reductions in HLI among longevity vanguard 
countries. Morbidity is compressing, except in high-income countries, where it 
stagnates. The variability in the ages at morbidity onset tends to be larger 
than the variability in lifespans, and such divergence broadens over time. As 
longevity increases worldwide, the locus of health inequality is moving from 
death-related inequalities to disease- and disability-centered ones.

Kosovo has the lowest life expectancy in the Western Balkans, where 
cardiovascular disease (CVD) accounts for over half of all deaths. Depression 
also contributes to disability in the country, with a prevalence of moderate to 
severe symptoms reported as high as 42% in the general population. Although the 
mechanisms are not yet well understood, evidence suggests that depression is an 
independent risk factor for CVD. Our study assessed the prospective association 
between depressive symptoms and blood pressure (BP)-related outcomes among 
primary healthcare users in Kosovo to understand the role of BP in the 
relationship between depression and CVD. We included 648 primary healthcare 
users from the KOSCO study. The presence of depressive symptoms was defined as 
moderate to very severe depressive symptoms (DASS-21 depressive symptoms score 
≥14). Multivariable censored regression models assessed prospective associations 
between baseline depressive symptoms and changes in systolic and diastolic BP 
while taking hypertension treatment into consideration. Multivariable logistic 
regression models assessed prospective associations between baseline depressive 
symptoms and hypertension diagnosis among normotensive patients (n = 226) as 
well as uncontrolled hypertension in hypertensive patients (n = 422) at 
follow-up. Depressive symptoms were associated with attenuated diastolic BP (β = 
-2.84, 95%-CI -4.64 to -1.05, p = 0.002) over a year of follow-up in our fully 
adjusted model, although the association with systolic BP (β = -1.98, 95%-CI 
-5.48 to 1.28, p = 0.23) did not meet statistical significance. We found no 
statistically significant association of depressive symptoms with hypertension 
diagnosis among initially normotensive people (OR = 1.68, 95%-CI 0.41 to 6.98, p 
= 0.48), nor with hypertension control among initially hypertensive people (OR = 
0.69, 95%-CI 0.34 to 1.41, p = 0.31). Our findings are not consistent with 
increased BP as an underlying mechanism between depression and elevated CVD risk 
and contribute valuable evidence to cardiovascular epidemiology, where the 
mechanisms between depression, hypertension and CVD are yet to be elucidated.

New approaches to reducing synthetic preservatives in the preservation of foods 
draw the attention of plant-derived bioactive compounds, especially for 
application in foods highly susceptible to spoilage, such as fish products. The 
review presents relevant data from procurement, application, and methodological 
research trends to investigate the potential effects of plant-derived bioactive 
compounds on shelf life extension in fish products. The systematization of data 
allowed observation that the different methods of extraction and application of 
bioactive plant compounds result in different effects, such as the reduction of 
lipid oxidation, antimicrobial effects, and maintenance of sensory 
characteristics, benefiting the extension of shelf life. In general, 
plant-derived bioactive compounds are an alternative for the preservation of 
fish products; however, approaches to the composition of the compounds can 
contribute to the optimization and efficiency of the process from a technical 
point of view and industrial viability.

BACKGROUND: Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is associated with a substantial disease 
burden. Lanadelumab reduced the HAE attack rate during 132 weeks of follow-up in 
the HELP open-label extension (OLE) Study (NCT02741596).
OBJECTIVE: To measure the impact of long-term lanadelumab treatment on 
patient-reported outcomes (PROs).
METHODS: Rollover patients (completed the 26-week HELP study [NCT02586805]) and 
nonrollovers (newly enrolled) received lanadelumab 300 mg every 2 weeks. PROs 
(Angioedema Quality of Life Questionnaire [AE-QoL], Short Form Health Survey 
12-item version 2, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Work Productivity and 
Activity Impairment-General Health Questionnaire, and EQ-5D-5L questionnaire) 
were assessed at baseline (day 0 of HELP OLE) and various time points until the 
end-of-study visit. The Angioedema Control Test, Treatment Satisfaction 
Questionnaire for Medication, and Global Impression of Treatment Response were 
administered starting at week 52.
RESULTS: The mean (SD) change in AE-QoL total score from baseline to 
end-of-study for rollovers (n = 90) was -10.2 (17.9), exhibiting further 
improvement from HELP in health-related quality of life (HRQoL); 48.9% of 
rollovers achieved the previously defined 6-point minimal clinically important 
difference. Nonrollovers (n = 81) reported a change of -19.5 (21.3). Controlled 
disease (Angioedema Control Test total score ≥10) was reported by 90.2% of 
rollovers and 95.9% of nonrollovers at the end of the study. Excellent treatment 
response was reported by 78.7% of patients and 82.4% of investigators. Results 
from other PROs indicated a slight improvement in anxiety, a high level of 
satisfaction with treatment, and increased work productivityor activity.
CONCLUSION: Clinically meaningful improvement in HRQoL was exhibited with 
long-term lanadelumab treatment, supporting the benefit of lanadelumab therapy 
associated with attack prevention.

INTRODUCTION: We analyzed data from a prospective cohort of older primary care 
patients to determine whether the presence of peripheral neuropathy (PN) was 
associated with premature mortality and to investigate potential mechanisms.
METHODS: PN was defined as the presence of 1 or more bilateral lower extremity 
sensory deficits detectable by physical examination. Mortality was determined 
from key contacts and Internet sources. Statistical models were used to evaluate 
the association between PN and mortality.
RESULTS: Bilateral lower extremity neurological deficits were common, reaching 
54% in those 85 and older. PN was strongly associated with earlier mortality. 
Mean survival time for those with PN was 10.8 years, compared with 13.9 years 
for subjects without PN. PN was also indirectly associated through impaired 
balance.
CONCLUSIONS: In this relatively healthy cohort of older primary care patients, 
PN detectable by physical examination was extremely common and strongly 
associated with earlier mortality. One possible mechanism involves loss of 
balance, though our data were insufficient to determine whether poor balance led 
to injurious falls or to less-specific declines in health. These findings may 
warrant further studies to determine the causes of age-associated PN and 
potential impact of early detection and balance improvement and other fall 
prevention strategies.

BACKGROUND: Eligibility to access the Victorian voluntary assisted dying (VAD) 
legislation requires that people have a prognosis of 6 months or less (or 12 
months or less in the setting of a neurodegenerative diagnosis). Yet prognostic 
determination is frequently inaccurate and prompts clinician discomfort. Based 
on functional capacity and clinical and biochemical markers, prognostic tools 
have been developed to increase the accuracy of life expectancy predictions.
AIMS: This review of prognostic tools explores their accuracy to determine 
6-month mortality in adults when treated under palliative care with a primary 
diagnosis of cancer (the diagnosis of a large proportion of people who are 
requesting VAD).
METHODS: A systematic search of the literature was performed on electronic 
databases Medline, Embase and Cinahl.
RESULTS: Limitations of prognostication identified include the following: (i) 
prognostic tools still provide uncertain prognoses; (ii) prognostic tools have 
greater accuracy predicting shorter prognoses, such as weeks to months, rather 
than 6 months; and (iii) functionality was often weighted significantly when 
calculating prognoses. Challenges of prognostication identified include the 
following: (i) the area under the curve (a value that represents how well a 
model can distinguish between two outcomes) cannot be directly interpreted 
clinically and (ii) difficulties exist related to determining appropriate 
thresholds of accuracy in this context.
CONCLUSIONS: Prognostication is a significant aspect of VAD, and the utility of 
the currently available prognostic tools appears limited but may prompt 
discussions about prognosis and alternative means (other than prognostic 
estimates) to identify those eligible for VAD.

Klebsiella pneumoniae is an opportunistic bacterium, which is globally 
recognized for its high prevalence and antimicrobial resistance (AMR). 
Biofilm-forming capability, susceptibility testing, and phenotypic confirmatory 
test for extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing isolate recognition 
of 104 K. pneumoniae isolates were performed according to the Clinical 
Laboratory Standard Institute (CLSI) guidelines. The prevalence of 
ESBL-associated genes bla-VIM, bla-NDM, and bla-OXA-48, as well as 
biofilm-associated genes luxS, fimH1, wza, and mrkD, was determined by multiplex 
PCR. The highest resistance rate was against ampicillin (100.0%). Among the 
104 K. pneumoniae isolates, 52 (50.0%) and 31 (29.8%) isolates were determined 
as multi- and extensively drug resistant (MDR, XDR), respectively. Moreover, 21 
(40.4%) isolates were determined as ESBL producing. Among 50 biofilm-producing 
K. pneumoniae isolates, 7 (14.0%), 15 (30.0%), and 28 (56.0%) isolates exhibited 
high, moderate, and weak levels of biofilm formation, respectively. A number of 
41 (78.8%) isolates were susceptible to colistin, and 10 (19.2%) were resistant. 
AMR was significantly higher (P < 0.05) in the biofilm-forming isolates compared 
with non-biofilm formers.

The increase in life expectancy of patients with cystic fibrosis has come with 
new comorbidities, particularly diabetes. The gradual development of glucose 
tolerance abnormalities means that 30 to 40% of adults will be diabetic. Cystic 
fibrosis-related diabetes is a major challenge in the care of these patients 
because it is a morbidity and mortality factor at all stages of the disease. 
Early glucose tolerance abnormalities observed from childhood, before the stage 
of diabetes, are also associated with a poor pulmonary and nutritional outcome. 
The long asymptomatic period justifies systematic screening with an annual oral 
glucose tolerance test from the age of 10 years. However, this strategy does not 
take into account the new clinical profiles of patients with cystic fibrosis, 
recent pathophysiological knowledge of glucose tolerance abnormalities, and the 
emergence of new diagnostic tools in diabetology. In this paper, we summarise 
the challenges of screening in the current context of new patient profiles - 
patients who are pregnant, have transplants, or are being treated with fibrosis 
conductance transmembrane regulator modulators - and put forward an inventory of 
the various screening methods for cystic fibrosis-related diabetes, including 
their applications, limitations and practical implications.

Although men are at higher risk of stroke throughout most of their lifespan, the 
incidence of stroke in women climbs with age, increasing after menopause and 
rising sharply after 85 years. This, combined with women's longer life 
expectancy, results in most of the stroke deaths occurring in women. In addition 
to accounting for a larger proportion of strokes, women may also suffer a 
survival disadvantage, which may be due to several factors. In many families, 
women are the primary caretakers. When they become disabled, there may be 
limited options to care for them. Others suggest that some of the disparities in 
stroke outcomes in women may be related to age, pre-stroke functional status, 
and comorbidities. Regardless of the cause, the increased disability and 
post-stroke care requirements of women, particularly in our aging population, 
highlight the importance of determining successful strategies for stroke 
prevention, acute stroke treatments, optimization of stroke rehabilitation, and 
effective secondary prevention measures in women.

Despite virological suppression, the CD4+ T lymphocytes are not restored in some 
HIV-infected patients after antiretroviral therapy. These individuals are known 
as immune non-responders (INRs). INRs are at high risk of developing AIDS and 
non-AIDS-related events and have a shorter life expectancy. Hence, it is vital 
to identify INRs early and prevent their complications, but there are still no 
specific diagnostic indicators or models. Ferroptosis has lately been reported 
as a type of programmed cell death, which plays an indispensable part in diverse 
diseases. However, its particular regulatory mechanisms remain unclear and its 
function in the pathogenic process of defective immunological recovery is still 
unknown. Blood is mainly used for rapid diagnosis because it enables quick 
testing. To investigate the role of ferroptosis-related genes (FRGs) in early 
detection of INRs, we scrutinized Gene Expression Omnibus datasets of peripheral 
blood samples to estimate their effectiveness. To our knowledge, for the first 
time, gene expression data were utilized in this study to discover six FRGs that 
were explicitly expressed in peripheral blood from INRs. Later on, multiple 
machine-supervised learning algorithms were employed, and a superlative 
diagnostic model for INRs was built with the random forest algorithm, which 
displayed satisfactory diagnostic efficiency in the training cohort (area under 
the curve [AUC] = 0.99) and one external validation cohort (AUC = 0.727). Our 
findings suggest that FRGs are implicated in the development of defective immune 
recovery, presenting a potential route for early detection and potential 
biological targets for the most effective treatment of defective immune 
recovery.

Amyloid precursor protein profusion in Trisomy 21, also called Down Syndrome 
(DS), is rooted in the genetic determination of Alzheimer's disease (AD). With 
the recent development in patient care, the life expectancy of DS patients has 
gradually increased, leading to the high prospect of AD development, 
consequently leading to the development of plaques of amyloid proteins and 
neurofibrillary tangles made of tau by the fourth decade of the patient leading 
to dementia. The altered gene expression resulted in cellular dysfunction due to 
impairment of autophagy, mitochondrial and lysosomal dysfunction, and copy 
number variation controlled by the additional genes in Trisomy 21. The cognitive 
impairment and mechanistic insights underlying DS-AD conditions have been 
reviewed in this article. Some recent findings regarding biomarkers and 
therapeutics of DS-AD conditions were highlighted in this review.

INTRODUCTION: Thanks to improvements in the medical treatment of Parkinson's 
disease (PD), the life expectancy of these patients has increased, but the 
overall outcome after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is controversial. We aim to 
analyse a series of patients with PD, evaluating their clinical status, 
functional results, complications and survival rates after TKA.
METHODS: We retrospectively studied 31 patients with PD operated between 
2014-2020. The mean age was 71 years (SD±5.8). There were 16 female patients. 
The mean follow-up was 68.2 months (SD±36). We used the Knee Scoring System 
(KSS) and the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for the functional evaluation. The 
Modified Hoehn and Yahr Scale was used to assess the severity of PD. All 
complications were recorded, and survival curves were performed.
RESULTS: The mean postoperative KSS evaluation had an increase of 40 points [35 
(SD±15) vs 75 (SD±15) (P<.001)]. The mean postoperative VAS decreased 5 points 
[8 (SD±2) vs 3 (SD±2) (P<.001)]. Thirteen patients reported being very 
satisfied, 13 were satisfied, and only 5 were poorly satisfied. Seven patients 
suffered surgical complications, and 4 patients had recurrent patellar 
instability. At a mean 68.2 months follow-up, the overall survival rate was 
93.5%. When considering the secondary patellar resurfacing as the endpoint, the 
survival rate was 80.6%.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study, TKA was associated with excellent functional 
outcomes in patients with PD. At a mean 68.2 months follow-up, TKA had excellent 
survivorship in the short term, with recurrent patellar instability as the most 
common complication. Even though these findings confirm the effectiveness of TKA 
in this population, a thorough clinical evaluation and multidisciplinary 
approach are needed to decrease the likelihood of complications.

In recent years, the incidence of renal cancer has been increasing continuously. 
Surgical resection is the "gold standard" for the treatment of small renal 
cancer. However, local ablation therapy of renal cancer is undoubtedly the best 
choice for patients with short life expectancy, other complications, and 
impaired renal function who are not suitable for surgery. In recent years, with 
the development of ablation techniques and long-term follow-up, local ablation 
has shown good therapeutic effects. As many domestic hospitals are performing or 
planning to perform renal tumor cryoablation to improve the clinical cure rate 
and surgical safety of renal tumor cryoablation, it is necessary to standardize 
the surgical indications, contraindications, perioperative management, efficacy 
evaluation, and other common problems. Currently, there is no expert consensus 
regarding perioperative renal tumor cryoablation in China. To standardize the 
perioperative management of renal tumor cryoablation and related technical 
operations in clinical practice, and improve the effectiveness and safety of 
cryoablation, the expert committee of Tumor Interventional and Minimally 
Invasive Diagnosis and Treatment Continuing Education Base of the Chinese 
Anti-Cancer Association convened experts in related fields to discuss and 
formulate this consensus, which is hereby published, for clinical reference and 
application.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Excessive sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) intake is 
associated with a higher risk of ischemic heart disease (IHD). However, global 
patterns and trends in the burden of IHD attributable to high SSBs intake have 
not been systematically assessed.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We retrieved data from the Global Burden of Disease Study 
(GBD) 2019. We obtained the numbers and age-standardized mortality rate (ASMR) 
and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) rate (ASDR) of IHD attributable to 
high SSBs intake by sex, year, socio-demographic index (SDI), and country 
between 1990 and 2019. Furthermore, we used a validated decomposition algorithm 
to attribute changes to population growth, population aging, and epidemiologic 
changes in the 21 GBD regions. From 1990 to 2019, the global IHD mortality 
attributable to high SSBs intake, as quantified by ASMR and ASDR declined 
significantly, while the burden increased saliently in absolute numbers. 
Population decomposition suggested that changes in epidemiology in most GBD 
regions have reduced IHD mortality due to high SSBs intake, but this trend has 
been counteracted by population growth and aging.
CONCLUSIONS: Although the age-standardized rate of IHD deaths and DALYs 
attributable to high SSBs intake decreased overall from 1990 to 2019, the 
absolute IHD burden remains high in some countries, especially in some 
developing countries in Asia and Oceania. Action is needed to enhance the 
prevention of diseases associated with high SSBs intake.

INTRODUCTION: People experiencing homelessness face lower life expectancy, 
higher prevalence of somatic and mental diseases and a more difficult access to 
healthcare compared to people in secure living. During the COVID-19 pandemic 
transmission rates were higher among people experiencing homelessness and 
preventive public health measures were not properly adapted to the specific 
needs of people experiencing homelessness. Thus, goal of our study was 
understanding the determinants of acceptability and access of the COVID-19 
vaccine.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a qualitative interview study with twenty 
guideline interviews with adult people currently experiencing homelessness in 
Berlin, Germany (August 2021 - April 2022). Participants were approached in a 
purposive sampling strategy. The interviews were analyzed with qualitative 
content analysis according to Mayring.
RESULTS: Acceptance and attitude toward the COVID-19 vaccine is influenced by 
confidence in the vaccine as well as in the political and healthcare system, the 
individual COVID-19 risk perception and sense of collective responsibility. 
Overall, the acceptance of the vaccine was high among our participants. 
Facilities offering low threshold COVID-19 vaccines for people experiencing 
homelessness were perceived as helpful. Language barriers and the need for 
identity documents were major barriers to access the COVID 19 vaccine.
DISCUSSION: People experiencing homelessness are a marginalized and vulnerable 
group often underrepresented in the public and scientific discourse. During the 
COVID-19 pandemic, preventive public health measures, including the COVID-19 
vaccine, failed to consider specific needs of people experiencing homelessness. 
Multidimensional strategy to enhance inclusive healthcare are needed to improve 
access and to reduce discrimination and stigmatization.
