OBJECTIVE: Tuberculosis (TB), along with the human immunodeficiency virus, is 
one of the leading causes of death from infectious diseases. Its prevalence has 
rendered the treatment of drug-resistant TB a major public health problem that 
threatens the progress made in TB care and control worldwide. Our objectives 
were to conduct a systematic review of the cost-effectiveness of treatment for 
multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant TB (MDR-TB/XDR-TB) and to 
synthesise available data from scientific research.
METHODS: Using English keywords, we searched for papers over reputable 
databases, such as Scopus, PubMed, Cochrane and Google Scholar, from Jan. 23 to 
Mar. 23, 2019.
RESULTS: The search and screening yielded 13 articles, whose results were 
extracted and reviewed to draw conclusions on the cost-effectiveness of 
MDR-TB/XDR-TB treatment. The data extraction table used to cull and categorise 
the results comprised the characteristics of a given study, as well as its 
objectives, the perspectives used to guide the investigation, methods and 
results (outcome, sensitivity analysis). The measured outcome was the 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio.
CONCLUSIONS: The review indicated that MDR -TB/XDR-TB treatment can be very 
cost-effective in countries with low to high incomes, regardless of whether 
minimal or considerable disease burdens exist.

The acquisition of genetic alterations, clonal evolution, and the tumor 
microenvironment promote cancer progression, metastasis and therapy resistance. 
These events correspond to the establishment of the great phenotypic 
heterogeneity and plasticity of cancer cells that contribute to tumor 
progression and resistant disease. Targeting resistant cancers is a major 
challenge in oncology; however, the underlying processes are not yet fully 
understood. Even though current treatments can reduce tumor size and increase 
life expectancy, relapse and multidrug resistance (MDR) ultimately remain the 
second cause of death in developed countries. Recent evidence points toward 
stem-like phenotypes in cancer cells, promoted by cancer stem cells (CSCs), as 
the main culprit of cancer relapse, resistance (radiotherapy, hormone therapy, 
and/or chemotherapy) and metastasis. Many mechanisms have been proposed for CSC 
resistance, such as drug efflux through ABC transporters, overactivation of the 
DNA damage response (DDR), apoptosis evasion, prosurvival pathways activation, 
cell cycle promotion and/or cell metabolic alterations. Nonetheless, targeted 
therapy toward these specific CSC mechanisms is only partially effective to 
prevent or abolish resistance, suggesting underlying additional causes for CSC 
resilience. This article aims to provide an integrated picture of the MDR 
mechanisms that operate in CSCs' behavior and to propose a novel model of tumor 
evolution during chemotherapy. Targeting the pathways mentioned here might hold 
promise and reveal new strategies for future clinical therapeutic approaches.

BACKGROUND: Severe kyphotic deformity can affect the quality of life of the 
elderly and is commonly treated by an osteotomy. Considering that the elderly 
often suffer from osteoporosis, the safety and efficacy of internal fixation are 
particularly important. The aim of this study was to analyse the effect of 
osteoporosis on internal fixation after spinal osteotomy.
METHODS: One patient with a thoracolumbar kyphotic deformity who underwent 
spinal osteotomy was included. The CT images of the entire spine were used to 
construct a finite element model of the spine internal fixation after osteotomy. 
Material parameters were assigned to osteoporosis and normal bone groups, and 
the loads were used to simulate different working conditions, including axial 
compression, flexion, extension and lateral bending.
FINDINGS: Compared with normal bone mass, the pressure on osteotomized vertebrae 
was reduced by 8.32%, 1.92%, 36.79% and 79.80% in mild osteoporosis model during 
axial compression, flexion, extension and lateral bending, respectively. The 
pressure on screws and rods was increased in an osteoporosis model under axial 
compression. During flexion and lateral bending, the pressure on screws was 
increased but was decreased on rods. The opposite result was found during 
extension. With the degree of osteoporosis increases, the change of stress is 
more obvious.
INTERPRETATION: Under different bone mass conditions, the distribution patterns 
of stress in vertebrae, screws and rods were relatively similar. Collectively, 
the stress levels of vertebral bone were decreased and the stress levels of the 
screw/rod system were increased in an osteoporosis model compared to a normal 
bone model. Hence, osteoporosis may increase the risk of fracture and internal 
fixation failure.

PROBLEM: Advances in treatment and therapy for children with chronic cardiac 
conditions have extended their life expectancy. Risk-taking behavior among 
adolescents requires further exploration. Researchers conducted a scoping review 
to address a literature gap specific to risk-taking behavior among adolescents 
with chronic cardiac conditions.
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Sources were limited to (1) human subjects, (2) English 
language or translatable to English, (3) adolescents without age restrictions, 
(4) all research designs and (5) presence of a chronic cardiac condition.
SAMPLE: Searches of six electronic databases (CINAHL Plus Full Text, PubMed, Web 
of Knowledge, Scopus, ProQuest and Grey Literature Report) were conducted to 
verify the empirical literature between 1975 and 2018. Seventeen sources were 
included in this review.
RESULTS: Among the 17 sources, 12 sources examined risk-taking behavior by 
self-report among adolescents with chronic cardiac conditions. Tobacco, alcohol 
and/or other drug use and physical inactivity were the most prevalent 
risk-taking behaviors identified through this review.
CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this scoping review describe the types of risk-taking 
behaviors that adolescents with chronic cardiac conditions are engaging in, 
highlight similarities when compared to other types of chronic conditions, and 
serve as a foundation for future research among this population.
IMPLICATIONS: Discussion of risk-taking behaviors should be integrated into each 
healthcare encounter beginning in early adolescence and continuing through 
transition to adulthood and adult health care. Qualitative research studies may 
serve as an effective method by which to explore risk-taking behavior among 
adolescents with chronic cardiac conditions in greater detail.

A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Rooming-in and Breastfeeding in Neonatal Opioid 
Withdrawal.

University, Portland, Oregon.

of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California.

OBJECTIVE: Our cost-effectiveness analysis investigated rooming-in versus not 
rooming-in to determine optimal management of neonates with neonatal opioid 
withdrawal (NOW).
STUDY DESIGN: A decision-analytic model was constructed using TreeAge to compare 
rooming-in versus not rooming-in in a theoretical cohort of 23,200 newborns, the 
estimated annual number affected by NOW in the United States. Additional 
considerations included the effect of breast milk versus formula milk in 
evaluating the need for pharmacotherapy. Primary outcomes were needed for 
pharmacotherapy and neurodevelopment. We assumed a societal perspective in 
evaluating costs and maternal-neonatal quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) using 
a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000/QALY. Model inputs were derived from 
literature and varied in sensitivity analyses.
RESULTS: Rooming-in resulted in fewer neonates requiring pharmacotherapy when 
compared with not rooming-in. The rooming-in group had more neonates with 
intact/mild neurodevelopmental impairment and fewer cases of moderate to severe 
impairment. Rooming-in resulted in cost savings of $509,652,728 and 12,333 
additional QALYs per annual cohort. When the risk ratio of need for 
pharmacotherapy in rooming-in was varied across a clinically plausible range, 
rooming-in remained the cost-effective strategy.
CONCLUSION: Maternal rooming-in with newborns affected by NOW leads to reduced 
costs and increased effectiveness. Management strategies should optimize 
nonpharmacological interventions as first-line treatment.

When it comes to nutrition, nearly everyone has an opinion. In the past, 
nutrition was considered to be an individual's responsibility, however, more 
recently governments have been expected (by some) to share that responsibility 
by helping to ensure that marketing is responsible, and that food chains offer 
healthy meal choices in addition to their standard fare, for example. In some 
countries, governments have gone as far as to remove tax from unprocessed foods 
or to introduce taxes, such as that imposed on sugary soft drinks in the UK, 
Mexico, France and Norway. Following on from the sugar tax, chocolate might be 
next! Is this the answer to our burgeoning calorie intake and increasing poor 
nutritional status, or is there another approach? In this narrative we will 
focus on some of the approaches taken by communities and governments to address 
excess calorie intake and improve nutritional status, as well as some of the 
conflicts of interest and challenges faced with implementation. It is clear that 
in order to achieve meaningful change in the quality of nutritional intake and 
to reduce the long-term prevalence of obesity, a comprehensive approach is 
required wherein governments and communities work in genuine partnership. To 
take no or little action will doom much of today's youth to a poor quality of 
life in later years, and a shorter life expectancy than their grandparents.

Radiation therapy is commonly used in the metastatic setting to palliate pain, 
neurological deficits, bleeding and other complications of metastatic disease, 
allowing patients to live longer and have better quality of life. Despite the 
effective use of radiation and other palliative treatment modalities, many 
patients continue to experience poorly controlled pain and other serious 
sequelae of their disease, underscoring the need for additional research in this 
area. In this review we highlight recent developments impacting the fields of 
palliative care and radiation oncology and describe opportunities for research 
and innovation including studies of tumor microenvironment, identification of 
effective biomarkers of tumor response and combinatorial treatments with new 
systemic agents. It is our hope that progress in these fields will improve the 
lives of patients living with advanced malignancies.

PURPOSE: Surgeons treating critically ill patients must work with family members 
making medical decisions for the patient. These surrogate decision makers depend 
on providers' high-quality communication and empathy to facilitate medical 
decisions. There is growing evidence of poor quality of communication and 
delayed family engagement in the intensive care unit, and of a decline in 
empathy over the course of a surgeon's clinical training. The aims of this study 
were to: (1) describe family understanding of patient prognosis among those 
admitted to our Trauma Intensive Care Unit (TICU), compared to the surgeon's 
assessment, and identify factors influencing the congruity of family-surgeon 
understanding ("congruence"); (2) characterize resident mentoring regarding 
difficult healthcare discussions and suggest adaptations to our communication 
program to address identified performance gaps.
SETTING: Level I TICU in an independent academic medical center.
METHODS: A qualitative research approach was valuable to discern the 
complexities of family understanding during highly stressful conditions. We 
enrolled adult family members of TICU patients, life expectancy <1 year, per 
attending. Using in-depth interviews we explored the family's experience with 
providers and the hospital system, and factors influencing understanding of the 
patient condition and decision making. We interviewed the surgical attending 
and/or resident separately to ascertain their perspective of the patient's 
condition and their experience with the family, as well as communication style, 
training, and influences on their approach. Interviews were audiotaped and 
transcribed. Using the systematic, multistep, rigorous coding process of 
grounded theory, we identified a range of experiences and common themes, and 
developed theories and hypotheses regarding factors influencing our outcomes of 
interest.
RESULTS: We enrolled, coded, and analyzed 31 interviews from 16 cases; the data 
painted a broad description of a complex situation. We developed a conceptual 
model of our hypothesized factors influencing congruence (Figure). Our data 
suggest that congruence varies widely, and is influenced by family-surgeon 
engagement quality, information accessed from other hospital and personal 
sources, and, significantly, hospital system factors. Family-surgeon engagement 
quality is influenced by family and physician factors, case complexity, and 
myriad hospital factors. Both "physician factors" and "family factors" include 
previous experience, personal history, and beliefs, as well as dynamic factors 
such as current experiences and stress level. We identify several opportunities 
to improve congruence by adapting our resident communication training program: 
providing practice assessing family knowledge, expectations, and current 
understanding of information shared, and focusing on building trust.
CONCLUSIONS: Surgical residents receive formal communication training and 
focused mentoring to gain important skills; however, family members' 
understanding of their loved one's critical condition is influenced by myriad 
hospital system factors beyond case complexity and surgeon communication skills.

BACKGROUND: Accurate childhood cancer burden data are crucial for resource 
planning and health policy prioritisation. Model-based estimates are necessary 
because cancer surveillance data are scarce or non-existent in many countries. 
Although global incidence and mortality estimates are available, there are no 
previous analyses of the global burden of childhood cancer represented in 
disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs).
METHODS: Using the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 
(GBD) 2017 methodology, childhood (ages 0-19 years) cancer mortality was 
estimated by use of vital registration system data, verbal autopsy data, and 
population-based cancer registry incidence data, which were transformed to 
mortality estimates through modelled mortality-to-incidence ratios (MIRs). 
Childhood cancer incidence was estimated using the mortality estimates and 
corresponding MIRs. Prevalence estimates were calculated by using MIR to model 
survival and multiplied by disability weights to obtain years lived with 
disability (YLDs). Years of life lost (YLLs) were calculated by multiplying 
age-specific cancer deaths by the difference between the age of death and a 
reference life expectancy. DALYs were calculated as the sum of YLLs and YLDs. 
Final point estimates are reported with 95% uncertainty intervals.
FINDINGS: Globally, in 2017, there were 11·5 million (95% uncertainty interval 
10·6-12·3) DALYs due to childhood cancer, 97·3% (97·3-97·3) of which were 
attributable to YLLs and 2·7% (2·7-2·7) of which were attributable to YLDs. 
Childhood cancer was the sixth leading cause of total cancer burden globally and 
the ninth leading cause of childhood disease burden globally. 82·2% (82·1-82·2) 
of global childhood cancer DALYs occurred in low, low-middle, or middle 
Socio-demographic Index locations, whereas 50·3% (50·3-50·3) of adult cancer 
DALYs occurred in these same locations. Cancers that are uncategorised in the 
current GBD framework comprised 26·5% (26·5-26·5) of global childhood cancer 
DALYs.
INTERPRETATION: The GBD 2017 results call attention to the substantial burden of 
childhood cancer globally, which disproportionately affects populations in 
resource-limited settings. The use of DALY-based estimates is crucial in 
demonstrating that childhood cancer burden represents an important global cancer 
and child health concern.

OBJECTIVE: This study assesses the impact of obesity on life expectancy for 26 
European national populations and the USA over the 1975-2012 period.
DESIGN: Secondary analysis of population-level obesity and mortality data.
SETTING: European countries, namely Austria, Belarus, Belgium, the Czech 
Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, 
Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, the 
Russian Federation, Slovakia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Ukraine and the UK; 
and the USA.
PARTICIPANTS: National populations aged 18-100 years, by sex.
MEASUREMENTS: Using data by age and sex, we calculated obesity-attributable 
mortality by multiplying all-cause mortality (Human Mortality Database) with 
obesity-attributable mortality fractions (OAMFs). OAMFs were obtained by 
applying the weighted sum method to obesity prevalence data (non-communicable 
diseases (NCD) Risk Factor Collaboration) and European relative risks (Dynamic 
Modeling for Health Impact Assessment (DYNAMO- HIA)). We estimated potential 
gains in life expectancy (PGLE) at birth by eliminating obesity-attributable 
mortality from all-cause mortality using associated single-decrement life 
tables.
RESULTS: In the 26 European countries in 2012, PGLE due to obesity ranged from 
0.86 to 1.67 years among men, and from 0.66 to 1.54 years among women. In all 
countries, PGLE increased over time, with an average annual increase of 2.68% 
among men and 1.33% among women. Among women in Denmark, Switzerland, and 
Central and Eastern European countries, the increase in PGLE levelled off after 
1995. Without obesity, the average increase in life expectancy between 1975 and 
2012 would have been 0.78 years higher among men and 0.30 years higher among 
women.
CONCLUSIONS: Obesity was proven to have an impact on both life expectancy levels 
and trends in Europe. The differences found in this impact between countries and 
the sexes can be linked to contextual factors, as well as to differences in 
people's ability and capacity to adopt healthier lifestyles.

Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is a rare solid tumor in childhood and adolescence. The 
higher incidence is predominant during the first two decades of life. According 
to the Intergroup RMS Study Group, the embryonal RMS (ERMS), botryoidal variant, 
constitutes a histological subtype characterized as a "grape-like" lesion of 2.0 
cm to 9.5 cm. The treatment involves chemotherapy, surgery, and/or radiotherapy. 
We present the case of a 14-year-old female patient diagnosed with ERMS, 
botryoidal variant, which originated in the uterine cervix with vaginal 
externalization. The initial therapeutic approach comprised an initial prolapsed 
mass excision followed by Wertheim-Meigs surgery due to the tumor extension. No 
consensual protocol to ERMS treatment is found in the medical literature; 
however, a combined approach seems to offer a better result. The postoperative 
time period was uneventful and the patient followed an adjuvant therapy with 
vincristine, d-actinomycin, and cyclophosphamide. A comprehensive evaluation of 
the therapeutic options preserving the reproductive function-unfortunately not 
always possible-is part of a multi-disciplined care team concerning the 
pediatric patients.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Regulatory approval of biosimilars often depends on 
extrapolating evidence from one clinical indication to all of those of the 
originator biologic. We aimed to develop a quantitative benefit-risk analysis to 
assess whether the resulting increase in the uncertainty in the clinical 
performance of biosimilars (i.e. risk) may be countered by their lower pricing 
(benefit).
METHODS: A 1-year decision-analytic model was developed for the biosimilar 
infliximab (Inflectra®) for Crohn's disease. The perspective was that of the 
National Health Service in the UK and costs were valued to 2015/16. A 
hypothetical cohort of biologic-naïve patients with moderate-to-severe Crohn's 
disease was simulated through the model. Immunogenicity to infliximab was a key 
modifier, influencing rates of non-response and infusion reactions. Net health 
benefit was estimated based on quality-adjusted life-years. A range of 
sensitivity analyses tested the robustness of the results and explored how the 
biosimilar price must respond to varying immunogenicity to remain the preferred 
option.
RESULTS: The base-case analysis predicted a positive incremental net health 
benefit of 0.04 (95% central range 0.00-0.09) favouring the biosimilar, based on 
0.803 quality-adjusted life-years, and costs of £18,087 and £19,176 for the 
biosimilar and originator, respectively. Two-way sensitivity analyses suggested 
that if 50% of patients developed antibodies, the value-based price of £410 per 
vial must be lower than that of the originator (£420), but remain higher than 
the actual market price (£378).
CONCLUSIONS: The model supports the use of Inflecta® for Crohn's disease in the 
UK, and provides a framework for the quantitative evaluation of biosimilars in 
the context of a health technology assessment. Value-based pricing using this 
methodology could protect health systems from the potential risks of biosimilars 
where they are untested in the approved populations.

ISSUE ADDRESSED: Biannual application of fluoride varnish is effective for 
dental caries prevention, but its cost-effectiveness using quality-adjusted life 
years (QALY) is unknown. This study performed a cost-effectiveness analysis, 
from the Australian health care system perspective of biannual application of 
fluoride varnish versus current practice (non-routine application) for an 
individual aged 15 years and older over a 70-year time horizon.
METHODS: Health outcomes measured were the number of prevented decayed, missing, 
and filled teeth (prevented-DMFT) and QALY gained. The calculated incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was compared against the reference 
cost-effectiveness ICER threshold of AUD$28 033 per QALY gained. A published 
Markov model capturing dental caries progression of eight permanent molars was 
used. This 6-monthly cycle model represented ten possible health states for an 
individual tooth. A 5% discount rate was applied with relevant sensitivity 
analysis.
RESULTS: In the base-case scenario, the net cost for the intervention was $3600 
compared to $2303 in the current practice arm. The intervention arm yielded 
13.99 DMFT and 15.44 QALY gained, whereas the current practice arm yielded 15.52 
DMFT and 14.74 QALY gained. The estimated ICER was $849 per prevented-DMFT and 
$1851 per QALY gained. Sensitivity analysis shows the ICER ranged from 
$424-$1807 per prevented-DMFT and $1851-$3941 per QALY gained.
CONCLUSION: Biannual professional application of fluoride varnish appears to be 
a highly cost-effective strategy and should be considered for universal funding 
in Australia's health care system.

In the era of effective antiretroviral therapy, the number of older people with 
HIV (PWH) is increasing, and those aging with HIV are experiencing an increasing 
burden of age-associated comorbidities. Life expectancy among older PWH is 
approaching that of demographically comparable HIV-uninfected (HIV-) adults. 
With this changing demographic of PWH come new challenges for researchers and 
clinicians in how to identify, address, and manage the complex interplay of 
treated HIV infection and aging-associated factors. In response to these 
challenges, the annual International Workshop on HIV and Aging was initiated in 
2009 as a multidisciplinary platform for scientific discourse on the research 
and clinical complications arising from the aging population of PWH. The 
multidisciplinary nature of the workshop has resulted in a wide range of topics 
addressed over the past 9 years, from basic mechanisms in aging and HIV 
pathogenesis, to epidemiology of aging within large cohorts, interventions, and 
implementation of clinical programs. Herein, we summarize the key topics 
discussed at the 9th Annual International Workshop on HIV and Aging 2018, 
including "inflammaging," mitochondrial dysfunction, exercise interventions, 
HIV-associated neurocognitive impairment, metabolic dysfunction, menopause, and 
polypharmacy. In addition to recent developments in research and clinical care, 
we discuss open questions and future research directions required to better 
understand the interaction of HIV and aging.

BACKGROUND: Management of bone and joint infection commonly includes 4-6 weeks 
of intravenous (IV) antibiotics, but there is little evidence to suggest that 
oral (PO) therapy results in worse outcomes.
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether or not PO antibiotics are non-inferior to IV 
antibiotics in treating bone and joint infection.
DESIGN: Parallel-group, randomised (1 : 1), open-label, non-inferiority trial. 
The non-inferiority margin was 7.5%.
SETTING: Twenty-six NHS hospitals.
PARTICIPANTS: Adults with a clinical diagnosis of bone, joint or orthopaedic 
metalware-associated infection who would ordinarily receive at least 6 weeks of 
antibiotics, and who had received ≤ 7 days of IV therapy from definitive surgery 
(or start of planned curative treatment in patients managed non-operatively).
INTERVENTIONS: Participants were centrally computer-randomised to PO or IV 
antibiotics to complete the first 6 weeks of therapy. Follow-on PO therapy was 
permitted in either arm.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The primary outcome was the proportion of participants 
experiencing treatment failure within 1 year. An associated cost-effectiveness 
evaluation assessed health resource use and quality-of-life data.
RESULTS: Out of 1054 participants (527 in each arm), end-point data were 
available for 1015 (96.30%) participants. Treatment failure was identified in 
141 out of 1015 (13.89%) participants: 74 out of 506 (14.62%) and 67 out of 509 
(13.16%) of those participants randomised to IV and PO therapy, respectively. In 
the intention-to-treat analysis, using multiple imputation to include all 
participants, the imputed risk difference between PO and IV therapy for 
definitive treatment failure was -1.38% (90% confidence interval -4.94% to 
2.19%), thus meeting the non-inferiority criterion. A complete-case analysis, a 
per-protocol analysis and sensitivity analyses for missing data each confirmed 
this result. With the exception of IV catheter complications [49/523 (9.37%) in 
the IV arm vs. 5/523 (0.96%) in the PO arm)], there was no significant 
difference between the two arms in the incidence of serious adverse events. PO 
therapy was highly cost-effective, yielding a saving of £2740 per patient 
without any significant difference in quality-adjusted life-years between the 
two arms of the trial.
LIMITATIONS: The OVIVA (Oral Versus IntraVenous Antibiotics) trial was an 
open-label trial, but bias was limited by assessing all potential end points by 
a blinded adjudication committee. The population was heterogenous, which 
facilitated generalisability but limited the statistical power of subgroup 
analyses. Participants were only followed up for 1 year so differences in late 
recurrence cannot be excluded.
CONCLUSIONS: PO antibiotic therapy is non-inferior to IV therapy when used 
during the first 6 weeks in the treatment for bone and joint infection, as 
assessed by definitive treatment failure within 1 year of randomisation. These 
findings challenge the current standard of care and provide an opportunity to 
realise significant benefits for patients, antimicrobial stewardship and the 
health economy.
FUTURE WORK: Further work is required to define the optimal total duration of 
therapy for bone and joint infection in the context of specific surgical 
interventions. Currently, wide variation in clinical practice suggests 
significant redundancy that likely contributes to the excess and unnecessary use 
of antibiotics.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN91566927.
FUNDING: This project was funded by the National Institute for Health Research 
(NIHR) Health Technology Assessment programme and will be published in full in 
Health Technology Assessment; Vol. 23, No. 38. See the NIHR Journals Library 
website for further project information.

Plain Language Summary: Treatment of bone and joint infection usually requires a 
long course of antibiotics. Doctors usually give these by injection through a 
vein (intravenously) for the first 4–6 weeks, rather than by mouth (orally). 
Although intravenous (IV) administration is more expensive and less convenient 
for patients, most doctors believe that it is more effective. However, there is 
little evidence to support this. The OVIVA (Oral Versus IntraVenous Antibiotics) 
trial set out to challenge this assumption. A total of 1054 patients from 26 UK 
hospitals were randomly allocated to receive the first 6 weeks of antibiotic 
therapy either intravenously or orally. Irrespective of the route of 
administration, the choice of antibiotic was left to an infection specialist so 
as to ensure that the most appropriate antibiotics were given. Patients were 
followed up for 1 year. Thirty-nine participants were lost to follow-up. Among 
the remaining 1015 participants, treatment failure occurred in 14.6% of those 
treated intravenously and 13.2% of those treated with PO antibiotics. This 
difference could easily have occurred by chance. Even if it was not by chance, 
the difference does not suggest that PO therapy is associated with worse 
outcomes than IV therapy and is too small to conclude that PO therapy is better 
than IV therapy. Participants in the IV group stayed in hospital longer and 10% 
of them had complications related to the IV line used for administering the 
antibiotics. In addition, their treatment was, overall, more expensive. We 
conclude that PO antibiotic therapy has no disadvantages for the early 
management of bone and joint infection. It is also cheaper and associated with 
fewer complications.

History of the Growing Burden of Cancer in India: From Antiquity to the 21st 
Century.

This review traces the growing burden of cancer in India from antiquity. We 
searched PubMed, Internet Archive, the British Library, and several other 
sources for information on cancer in Indian history. Paleopathology studies from 
Indus Valley Civilization sites do not reveal any malignancy. Cancer-like 
diseases and remedies are mentioned in the ancient Ayurveda and Siddha 
manuscripts from India. Cancer was rarely mentioned in the medieval literature 
from India. Cancer case reports from India began in the 17th century. Between 
1860 and 1910, several audits and cancer case series were published by Indian 
Medical Service doctors across India. The landmark study by Nath and Grewal used 
autopsy, pathology, and clinical data between 1917 and 1932 from various medical 
college hospitals across India to confirm that cancer was a common cause of 
death in middle-aged and elderly Indians. India's cancer burden was apparently 
low as a result of the short life expectancy of the natives in those times. In 
1946, a national committee on health reforms recommended the creation of 
sufficient facilities to diagnose and manage the increasing cancer burden in all 
Indian states. Trends from the Mumbai population-based cancer registry revealed 
a four-fold increase in patients with cancer from 1964 to 2012. Depending on the 
epidemiologic transition level, wide interstate variation in cancer burden is 
found in India. We conclude that cancer has been recognized in India since 
antiquity. India's current burden of a million incident cancers is the result of 
an epidemiologic transition, improved cancer diagnostics, and improved cancer 
data capture. The increase in cancer in India with wide interstate variations 
offers useful insights and important lessons for developing countries in 
managing their increasing cancer burdens.
