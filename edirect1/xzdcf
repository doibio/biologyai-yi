in even earlier, pre-clinical stages of the disease. Research has identified 
potentially measurable functional, structural, metabolic and vascular changes in 
the retina during early stages of AD. Retina offers a distinctively accessible 
insight into brain pathology and current and developing ophthalmic technologies 
have provided us with the possibility of detecting and characterising subtle, 
disease-related changes. Recent human and animal model studies have further 
provided mechanistic insights into the biochemical pathways that are altered in 
the retina in disease, including amyloid and tau deposition. This information 
coupled with advances in molecular imaging has allowed attempts to monitor 
biochemical changes and protein aggregation pathology in the retina in AD. This 
review summarises the existing knowledge that informs our understanding of the 
impact of AD on the retina and highlights some of the gaps that need to be 
addressed. Future research will integrate molecular imaging innovation with 
functional and structural changes to enhance our knowledge of the AD 
pathophysiological mechanisms and establish the utility of monitoring retinal 
changes as a potential biomarker for AD.

A global strategic plan for the elimination of dog-mediated human rabies deaths 
by 2030 was announced in 2018. The cost-effectiveness of annual mass dog 
vaccination programmes, as a control and elimination method, has been advocated 
on many occasions. Complementary methods, such as animal birth control (ABC) 
activities, have received less attention. This paper provides a case-study of a 
programme operated by Help in Suffering (HIS) in Jaipur, India from 1994/95 
until 2016/17 comprising both ABC and additional vaccination-only activities. 
The availability of cost data alongside information on dog numbers, dog bites 
and human rabies cases provided an exceptionally detailed and unique 
retrospective dataset recording actual events and expenditures. Updated to 
2016/17 prices, the total cost of the programme was 658,744 USD. Since 
2007/2008, activity costs have been separated and returned costs of 10.78 USD 
per dog, both sterilised and vaccinated, and 1.86 USD per dog, vaccinated only. 
Over the course of the programme, the number of disability-adjusted life years 
(DALYs) due to premature death and the distress associated with dog bites was 
estimated to be 36,246 fewer than would have been expected if HIS had not been 
operating, based on a counterfactual scenario using pre-intervention values. 
Linking the DALY figure to the cost of the activities undertaken by HIS yields a 
cost of 26 USD per DALY averted. Discounted at 3%, the DALYs averted equate to 
16,587 at a cost of 40 USD per DALY averted. Both cases make it a very 
cost-effective intervention, in relation to the threshold of investing one 
year's gross domestic product (GDP) per DALY averted (1981 USD in 2016/17). The 
monetary benefit from fewer dog bites and clinical human rabies cases requiring 
treatment amounted to 5.62 million USD after discounting, which, if attributed 
to Help in Suffering, yields a monetary benefit-cost ratio of 8.5. Thus, the 
potential monetary benefits greatly outweigh the programme costs, even without 
considering the DALYs averted. If a modest notional monetary value of one year's 
GDP is assigned to represent the human capital or production value of DALYs 
averted, the discounted societal economic benefit reaches 38.48 million USD and 
implies a benefit-cost ratio of 58.4. These economic analyses demonstrate that 
ABC activities in combination with additional vaccination efforts can be a 
cost-effective control measure for dog-mediated human rabies.

BACKGROUND: Hydranencephaly is a rare and debilitating congenital condition in 
which most anesthesiologists are unfamiliar. Primary surgical treatment involves 
CSF diversion, though other palliative procedures requiring anesthesia are often 
required. With medical advancements and a resulting prolonged life expectancy, 
caring for these patients is becoming more routine.
CASE PRESENTATION: We follow an infant with hydranencephaly over three different 
procedures requiring anesthesia from 5 months of age to 2 years, highlighting 
the various anesthetic considerations.
CONCLUSIONS: Anticipation of difficult positioning, deliberate airway 
management, and attention to anesthetic recovery were all necessary to safely 
care for this patient. An understanding of the challenges this particular 
condition poses will help anesthesiologists provide the most safe and effective 
care when encountering these patients.

INTRODUCTION: African American women have a life expectancy 2.7 years shorter 
than that of white women and are less likely than white women to meet national 
physical activity guidelines. Physical activity has been found to reduce 
mortality, but evidence concerning African American women is limited.
METHODS: In the Black Women's Health Study, a prospective cohort study of 
African American women begun in 1995, a total of 52,993 participants who were 
free of cardiovascular disease and cancer at enrollment were followed through 
2017. Cox proportional hazards models evaluated the associations of repeated 
measures of physical activity with mortality, adjusting for demographic, 
medical, and lifestyle factors. Statistical analyses were last performed in 
September 2019.
RESULTS: During the 22 years of follow-up, 4,719 deaths occurred. Higher levels 
of physical activity were associated with reduced all-cause, cardiovascular 
disease, and cancer mortality. Hazard ratios for walking ≥5 hours per week 
relative to no walking were 0.69 (95% CI=0.62, 0.77), 0.71 (95% CI=0.57, 0.87), 
and 0.80 (95% CI=0.67, 0.96) for all-cause, cardiovascular disease, and cancer 
mortality, respectively. The comparable hazard ratios for vigorous exercise for 
≥5 hours per week vs none were 0.58 (95% CI=0.50, 0.67), 0.66 (95% CI=0.50, 
0.87), and 0.52 (95% CI=0.39, 0.72).
CONCLUSIONS: Both walking for exercise and vigorous exercise were associated 
with reductions in mortality among African American women, including deaths from 
cardiovascular disease and deaths from cancer, both of which are 
disproportionately high in the African American population. These findings 
underline the importance of institutional and individual changes that will lead 
to increased physical activity.

BACKGROUND: People with peripheral artery disease are at a high risk of major 
adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and major adverse limb events (MALE). 
Randomized controlled trials suggest that intensive lowering of low-density 
lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) with proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 
9 (PCSK9) inhibitors is an effective strategy to prevent these events. This 
study estimated the potential benefit and cost-effectiveness of administrating 
PCSK9 inhibitors to a cohort of participants with peripheral artery disease.
METHODS: A total of 783 participants with intermittent claudication (IC; n = 
582) or chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI; n = 201) were prospectively 
recruited from three hospitals in Australia. Serum LDL-C was measured at 
recruitment, and the occurrence of MACE and MALE was recorded over a median 
(interquartile range) follow-up of 2.2 years (0.3-5.7 years). The potential 
benefit of administering a PCSK9 inhibitor was estimated by calculating the 
absolute risk reduction and numbers needed to treat (NNT) based on relative risk 
reductions reported in published randomized trials. The incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio per quality-adjusted life year gained was estimated.
RESULTS: Intensive LDL-C lowering was estimated to lead to an absolute risk 
reduction in MACE of 6.1% (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.0-9.3; NNT, 16) and 
MALE of 13.7% (95% CI, 4.3-21.5; NNT, 7) in people with CLTI compared with 3.2% 
(95% CI, 1.1-4.8; NNT, 32) and 5.3% (95% CI, 1.7-8.3; NNT, 19) in people with 
IC. The estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios over a 10-year period 
were $55,270 USD and $32,800 USD for participants with IC and CLTI, 
respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: This analysis suggests that treatment with a PCSK9 inhibitor is 
likely to be cost-effective in people with CLTI.

Radon, a gaseous radioactive decay product of naturally-occurring uranium is 
widely distributed in the environment in rocks and soils and, in certain 
circumstances, can accumulate in the built environment. Initial studies 
confirmed a direct link between exposure to both radon gas and its short-lived 
radioactive progeny, and increased lung-cancer incidence, and demonstrated that 
radon levels in domestic housing can be sufficiently high to expose occupants to 
increased risk of lung-cancer. Subsequent studies worldwide have shown that it 
is cost-effective to detect and reduce domestic radon levels in order to reduce 
this risk. Recent advances in the early detection of lung-cancer, coupled with 
the development of improved treatment procedures, have progressively improved 
survival from the disease, with the numbers surviving at 5 years doubling over 
recent years, during which period the real costs of lung cancer treatment have 
risen by around 30%. In the meantime, however, in addition to radon and 
tobacco-smoke, other airborne pollutants have been identified as risk-factors 
for lung-cancer. This paper reviews both these actual developments and 
anticipated future trends, and concludes that since these advances in diagnosis 
and treatment of lung-cancer have had only a modest effect on 
cost-effectiveness, it is still important to conduct radon monitoring and 
remediation programmes. While the general increase in life-expectancy improves 
the cost-effectiveness of radon remediation programmes significantly, reducing 
tobacco-smoking incidence reduces that cost-effectiveness but with the overall 
benefit of reducing radon-related lung-cancers. The challenge remains of 
encouraging affected householders to remediate their homes to reduce radon 
levels.

The distribution and sources of PAHs in jinga shrimp (Metapenaeus affinis), and 
human health risks due to consumption was evaluated in collected samples from 
the Musa Bay, Persian Gulf. The total concentration of PAHs (∑16PAHs) ranged 
from 10 to 144 μg kg-1 dry weight, indicating low to moderate level of 
pollution. The PAHs were dominated by three- (41%) and two-ring (38%) compounds. 
Source identification analyses indicated the PAH pollution mostly originated 
from petroleum inputs. A preliminary evaluation of human health risk using 
chronic daily intake, hazard index, benzo[a]pyrene-equivalent (BaPeq) 
concentration (PEC) as well as the incremental life cancer risk and non-cancer 
risk assessment suggest low potential health risk for consumers of the 
Metapenaeus affinis. However, the results indicate minimal risks associated with 
the intake of PAHs via shrimp consumption, but long-term monitoring is required 
to evaluate the changes in ecological and human health impacts of contaminants 
in the region. MAIN FINDING: PAHs in Metapenaeus affinis from Musa bay, which 
influenced by anthropogenic activities were low to moderate level of pollution. 
Human health risk indicates low potential health risk for consumers.

BACKGROUND: Suicide among the elderly is a public health concern, as life 
expectancy is increasing rapidly and suicide rates increase with age. In Korea, 
self-poisoning is the most common method of attempted suicide. This study aimed 
to evaluate the characteristics of attempted suicide by self-poisoning among the 
elderly and to identify risk factors related to the suicide attempts.
METHODS: A cross-sectional observational study was conducted using the Emergency 
Department-based Injury In-depth Surveillance database in Korea. We included all 
adult patients visiting the emergency department (ED) who attempted suicide by 
poisoning between January 2011 and December 2017 and stratified according to 
age: the elderly (≥ 65 years old) and the younger group. Characteristics and 
risk factors for attempted suicide by poisoning among the elderly were evaluated 
using stepwise regression analysis.
RESULTS: Among 25,904 adult patients, 5,164 (19.9%) were classified as elderly. 
The elderly were more likely to be admitted to hospital and intensive care 
units, the average ED length of stay was longer, and total mortality was higher 
than that of the younger group. Male sex, low socioeconomic status, poor 
physical health, pesticide use, lower alcohol consumption, and fewer prior 
suicide attempts were found to be risk factors for suicide among the elderly.
CONCLUSION: Self-poisoning among the elderly is associated with poorer clinical 
outcomes than in younger adult patients. Suicide among the elderly is a 
potentially preventable public health problem, and with proper identification of 
the associated risk factors, appropriate multidisciplinary intervention 
strategies can be implemented.

INTRODUCTION: Determining cost-utility differences between home-based cardiac 
rehabilitation (HBCR) on the one hand, and usual post-discharge care (UC) on the 
other, can improve resource-allocation in healthcare settings.
AREAS COVERED: In June 2019, PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Cochrane 
library were searched for randomized controlled HBCR trials. Standardized mean 
differences (SMDs) of cost and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) between HBCRs 
and UCs were calculated using random effect models. Heterogeneity was assessed 
by inconsistency index (I2) and publication bias by funnel plot and Egger's 
regression test. Thirteen articles, representing 2,992 participants, were deemed 
representative for final analysis. In the meta-analysis, a significant 
difference with respect to QALYs favored HBCR, while no significant cost 
difference was observed between HBCR and UC. However, subgroup-analysis of 
trials with different follow-up durations revealed somewhat different results, 
and HBCR was found to be significantly better with regard to both cost and QALYs 
for patients with heart failure. Cost-utility analysis categorizing 
interventions as 'dominant', 'effective', 'doubtful', and 'dominated', found 
HBCRs dominant.
EXPERT OPINION: Although HBCR tended to be superior compared to UC in this 
review, larger and more robust trials addressing specific patients groups are 
needed for definitive results.

BACKGROUND: The mortality effects of COVID-19 are a critical aspect of the 
disease's impact. Years of life lost (YLLs) can provide greater insight than the 
number of deaths by conveying the shortfall in life expectancy and thus the age 
profile of the decedents.
METHODS: We employed data regarding COVID-19 deaths in the USA by jurisdiction, 
gender and age group for the period 1 February 2020 through 11 July 2020. We 
used actuarial life expectancy tables by gender and age to estimate YLLs.
RESULTS: We estimated roughly 1.2 million YLLs due to COVID-19 deaths. The YLLs 
for the top six jurisdictions exceeded those for the remaining 43. On a 
per-capita basis, female YLLs were generally higher than male YLLs throughout 
the country.
CONCLUSIONS: Our estimates offer new insight into the effects of COVID-19. Our 
findings of heterogenous rates of YLLs by geography and gender highlight 
variation in the magnitude of the pandemic's effects that may inform effective 
policy responses.

PURPOSE: Fractures are known to shorten life expectancy and worsen the quality 
of life. The risk of fractures after radiation therapy in cervical cancer 
patients is known to be multifactorial. In this study, we examined risk factors 
for fractures in cervical cancer patients, especially by evaluating bone 
densities and DVH parameters for fractured bones.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: For 42 patients, clinical characteristics, pretreatment 
CT bone densities, and radiation dose were compared between patients with and 
without fractures.
RESULTS: Posttreatment fractures occurred in 25 bones among ten patients. 
Pretreatment CT bone densities were significantly lower in patients with 
fractures (P < 0.05-0.01 across sites, except for the ilium and the ischium). 
Although DVH parameters were also significantly associated with fractures in 
univariate analysis, only CT densities were significantly associated with 
fractures in multivariate analysis.
CONCLUSION: Pretreatment CT densities of spinal and pelvic bones, which may 
reflect osteoporosis, have a significant impact on the risk for posttreatment 
fractures.

Worldwide, the prevalence of anemia is high, and iron deficiency anemia is the 
fifth most common disorder according to the study called "Global burden of 
disease". It can be attributed to a number of factors, complex pathomechanisms, 
and etiology is highly variable in terms of age, gender, and geographical 
distribution. The prevalence of anemia increases with age. Demographic change 
and the aging of the population are now faster than in previous decades, posing 
major challenges to societies and health systems. The mean prevalence of anemia 
in the elderly is 17%, but significantly higher among nursing-home (47%) and 
hospitalized elderly (40%). The cause is usually multifactorial and often, due 
to comorbidities, several mechanisms are involved at the same time. The 
prevalence of preoperative anemia was higher (35%) than the prevalence of anemia 
in the general population, and evidence showed an unfavorable effect on 
postoperative morbidity and mortality. Timely identification and correction is a 
multidisciplinary task and a shared responsibility for both Patient Blood 
Management program and improving the patients' life expectancy. Orv Hetil. 2020;

Life under lockdown: Illustrating tradeoffs in South Africa's response to 
COVID-19.

This research note sheds light on the first three months of the COVID-19 
outbreak in South Africa, where the virus has spread faster than anywhere else 
in the region. At the same time, South Africa has been recognized globally for 
its swift and efficient early response. We consider the impact of this response 
on different segments of the population, looking at changes in mobility by 
province to highlight variation in the willingness and ability of different 
subsets of the population to comply with lockdown orders. Using anonymized 
mobile phone data, we show that South Africans in all provinces reduced their 
mobility substantially in response to the government's lockdown orders. 
Statistical regression analysis shows that such mobility reductions are 
significantly and negatively associated with COVID-19 growth rates two weeks 
later. These findings add an important perspective to the emerging literature on 
the efficacy of shelter-in-place orders, which to date is dominated by studies 
of the United States. We show that people were particularly willing and able to 
act in the provinces hit hardest by the pandemic in its initial stages. At the 
same time, compliance with lockdown orders presented a greater challenge among 
rural populations and others with more precarious livelihoods. By reflecting on 
South Africa's inequality profile and results of a recent survey, we demonstrate 
how the country's response may deepen preexisting divides. This cautionary tale 
is relevant beyond South Africa, as much of the continent - and the world - 
grapples with similar tradeoffs. Along with measures to contain the spread of 
disease, governments and other development focused organizations should 
seriously consider how to offset the costs faced by already marginalized 
populations.

Expanding hermeneutics to the world of technology.

In this essay, I first analyze the extension of hermeneutical interpretation in 
the Heideggerian sense to products of contemporary technology which are 
components of our "lifeworld". Products of technology, such as airplanes, 
laptops, cellular phones, washing machines, or vacuum cleaners might be compared 
with what Heidegger calls the "Ready-to-hand" (das Zuhandene) with regard to 
utilitarian objects such as a hammer, planer, needle and door handle in Being 
and Time. Our life with our equipment, which represents the "Ready-to-hand" in 
Heidegger's sense of the word, is determined by temporalization (Zeitigung) 
which cannot be separated and isolated from the wholeness of things in the 
world. In the second part of my paper, I explore the positive achievement of 
material hermeneutics (Don Ihde) with regard to its extension to technoscience 
and the discussion of how such hermeneutics can contribute to the preservation 
of our threatened lifeworld, but also to explore the possibilities of how 
technical inventions, medical innovations could improve our way of life.

BACKGROUND: Person-centred care has been shown to be cost-effective compared to 
usual care for several diseases, including acute coronary syndrome, in a 
short-term time perspective (< 2 years). The cost-effectiveness of 
person-centred care in a longer time perspective is largely unknown.
OBJECTIVES: To estimate the mid-term cost-effectiveness of person-centred care 
compared to usual care for patients (< 65) with acute coronary syndrome, using a 
2-year and a 5-year time perspective.
METHODS: The mid-term cost-effectiveness of person-centred care compared to 
usual care was estimated by projecting the outcomes observed in a 
randomized-controlled trial together with data from health registers and data 
from the scientific literature, 3 years beyond the 2-year follow-up, using the 
developed simulation model. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed 
using Monte Carlo simulation.
RESULTS: Person-centred care entails lower costs and improved effectiveness as 
compared to usual care, for a 2-year time and a 5-year perspective. Monte Carlo 
simulations suggest that the likelihoods of the person-centred care being 
cost-effective compared to usual care were between 80 and 99% and between 75 and 
90% for a 2-year and a 5-year time perspective (using a 500,000 SEK/QALY 
willingness-to-pay threshold).
CONCLUSIONS: Person-centred care was less costly and more effective compared to 
usual care in a 2-year and a 5-year time perspective for patients with acute 
coronary syndrome under the age of 65.

Beef rolls for hot pot are usually stored and transported in a frozen state, and 
the beef color deteriorates quickly. This paper reports on an investigation into 
the effect of packaging method, freezing temperature and storage time on 
instrumental color, pH, myoglobin state, lipid oxidation (TBARS) and total 
volatile basic nitrogen (TVB-N) of beef rolls. It was shown that the color of 
beef rolls at -18 °C was better than that at -12 °C overall, and the OxyMb% and 
pH values were higher, while the MetMb% and TBARS were lower with storage at 
-18 °C. With the extension of storage time, the instrumental color, OxyMb% and 
pH values of beef rolls decreased. Correspondingly, the MetMb% and TBARS showed 
an upward trend. However, the TVB-N of all treatments did not exceed the Chinese 
standard during 180d of storage. The results of this paper provide a number of 
recommendations for the storage of frozen beef rolls to extend color-shelf life.

We present quantum mechanical estimates for non-bonded, van der Waals-like, 
radii of 93 atoms in a pressure range from 0 to 300 gigapascal. Trends in radii 
are largely maintained under pressure, but atoms also change place in their 
relative size ordering. Multiple isobaric contractions of radii are predicted 
and are explained by pressure-induced changes to the electronic ground state 
configurations of the atoms. The presented radii are predictive of drastically 
different chemistry under high pressure and permit an extension of chemical 
thinking to different thermodynamic regimes. For example, they can aid in 
assignment of bonded and non-bonded contacts, for distinguishing molecular 
entities, and for estimating available space inside compressed materials. All 
data has been made available in an interactive web application.

[Insomnia comorbid to Parkinson's disease Part II: Therapeutic approaches].

Insomnia disorder is four times more frequent in Parkinson's disease (PD) than 
in the general population. In PD, insomnia is associated with a very significant 
decrease in quality of life and deleterious consequences on both patients and 
caregivers' health. The main therapeutic option in response to insomnia comorbid 
to PD is the prescription of benzodiazepines or related drugs. As in the general 
population, these sedative-hypnotic molecules have very low efficacy in PD and 
are associated with adverse effects. They are highly addictive and are also 
associated with drowsiness, risk of falling and decreased life expectancy. These 
side effects may in themselves be symptoms associated with PD in the absence of 
insomnia. In this clinical context, we can easily conceive that 
sedative-hypnotics are likely to potentiate these clinical symptoms in PD. We 
have recently documented that insomnia disorder comorbid to PD is associated 
with the classical psychological factors perpetuating insomnia in neurological 
disease-free individuals with insomnia. These results have allowed us to 
emphasize that target-oriented interventions for instance cognitive-behavioral 
therapy for chronic insomnia (CBT-i) should be considered as a treatment 
approach for insomnia disorder comorbid to PD. As a reminder, for decades, CBT-i 
is considered the most effective first-line treatment for the management of 
chronic insomnia associated or not with comorbidity. In this context, we 
demonstrated the acceptability of CBT-i in the treatment of insomnia comorbid to 
PD and its effectiveness for the management of night and daytime symptoms of 
insomnia associated with this neurological condition. The objective of this 
synthesis is to raise awareness among health professionals of the relevance of 
psychological therapies (mostly CBT) for insomnia in PD. Unlike drug treatments, 
these therapies are safety for patients who are already weakened by the PD 
itself.

BACKGROUND/AIMS: Endoscopic resection is the standard treatment for superficial 
esophageal squamous-cell neoplasia (SESCN). However, we encounter patients in 
whom endoscopic resection is difficult to perform. We retrospectively studied 
the usefulness of argon plasma coagulation (APC) in patients with SESCN.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study comprised 45 patients with SESCN (81 lesions) 
who underwent APC in our hospital from March 1999 through August 2016. 
Clinicopathological characteristics, treatment time, the presence or absence of 
metastasis and recurrence, adverse events, and outcomes were studied.
RESULTS: The median follow-up was 40 months. The median age was 70 years. The 
tumor diameter was 10 mm or longer in 48 lesions and less than 10 mm in 33 
lesions. The median treatment time was 22 minutes. The reasons for selecting APC 
were as follows: technical difficulty caused by the presence of metachronous 
multiple lesions in the radiation field after chemoradiotherapy or close 
proximity to the ulcer scar remaining after endoscopic treatment in 49 lesions 
(60.4%), and the presence of underlying diseases in 26 lesions (32.0%). Adverse 
events occurred in 2 patients (4.4%) who had hypoxemia due to over-sedation. Two 
lesions (2.5%) recurred locally but could be locally controlled by additional 
APC. No patient had metastasis or recurrence or died of esophageal neoplasia. 
The 3-year overall survival rate was 87.0%, and the 3-year recurrence-free 
survival rate was 97.2%.
CONCLUSION: APC can be a useful treatment option for SESCN in patients with a 
limited life expectancy, poor performance status, or technical difficulty in 
resection of superficial neoplasms.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) has become a public health burden worldwide for its 
increasing incidence and prevalence, high impact on the health related quality 
of life (HRQoL) and life expectancy, and high personal and social cost. Patients 
with advanced CKD, in dialysis or not, suffer a burden from symptoms very 
similar to other chronic diseases and have a life span not superior to many 
malignancies. Accordingly, in recent years, renal palliative care has been 
recommended to be integrated in the traditional care delivered to this 
population. This research provides an updated overview on renal palliative care 
from the relevant literature.

A doença renal crônica (DRC) tornou-se um peso na saúde pública em todo o mundo 
por sua crescente incidência e prevalência, seu alto impacto na qualidade de 
vida relacionada à saúde (QVRS) e na expectativa de vida, e alto custo pessoal e 
social. Pacientes com DRC avançada, em diálise ou não, sofrem de uma carga de 
sintomas muito semelhantes aos de outras doenças crônicas, e têm uma sobrevida 
não superior àquela de muitas doenças malignas. Assim, nos últimos anos, 
recomenda-se que os cuidados paliativos renais sejam integrados aos cuidados 
tradicionais prestados a essa população. Este trabalho fornece uma visão geral 
atualizada sobre os cuidados paliativos renais discutidos na literatura 
relevante.

In yeast and animal cells, mitochondrial disturbances resulting from imbalances 
in the respiratory chain require malate dehydrogenase (MDH) activities for 
re-directing fluxes of reducing equivalents. In plants, in addition to 
mitochondria, plastids use malate valves to counterbalance and maintain 
redox-homeostasis. Arabidopsis expresses three cytosolic MDH isoforms, namely 
cyMDH1, cyMDH2, and cyMDH3, the latter possessing an N-terminal extension 
carrying a unique cysteine residue C2. In this study, redox-effects on activity 
and structure of all three cyMDH isoforms were analyzed in vitro. cyMDH1 and 
cyMDH2 were reversibly inactivated by diamide treatment, accompanied by 
dimerization via disulfide-bridge formation. In contrast, cyMDH3 forms dimers 
and higher oligomers upon oxidation, but its low specific activity is 
redox-independent. In the presence of glutathione, cyMDH1 and cyMDH2 are 
protected from dimerization and inactivation. In contrast, cyMDH3 still 
dimerizes but does not form oligomers any longer. From analyses of single and 
double cysteine mutants and structural modeling of cyMDH3, we conclude that the 
presence of C2 and C336 allows for multiple cross-links in the higher molecular 
mass complexes comprising disulfides within the dimer as well as between 
monomers of two different dimers. Furthermore, nuclear localization of cyMDH 
isoforms was significantly increased under oxidizing conditions in isolated 
Arabidopsis protoplasts, in particular of isoform cyMDH3. The unique cyMDH3 
C2-C2-linked dimer is, therefore, a good candidate as a redox-sensor taking over 
moonlighting functions upon disturbances of energy metabolism, as shown 
previously for the glycolytic enzyme glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase 
(GAPDH) where oxidative modification of the sensitive catalytic cysteine 
residues induces nuclear translocation.

IMPORTANCE: Socioeconomic differences in life expectancy, health, and disability 
have been found in European countries as well as in the US. Identifying the 
extent and pattern of health disparities, both within and across the US and 
England, may be important for informing public health and public policy aimed at 
reducing these disparities.
OBJECTIVE: To compare the health of US adults aged 55 to 64 years with the 
health of their peers in England across the high and low ranges of income in 
each country.
