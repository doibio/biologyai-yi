(r s = -0.34, p = 0.02). The present study indicates that high levels of MMP-2, 
perlecan, and TIMP-4 are associated with poor survival in PAH. High plasma 
MMP-2, correlated with poor prognosis in PAH. Further validation in larger 
studies is needed to better determine this association.

INTRODUCTION: This article attempts to investigate whether inclusive health 
systems increase societal welfare, with the latter expressed through estimates 
of healthy life expectancy (HLE).
METHODS: The analysis uses publicly available data by the Organisation for 
Economic Co-operation and Development and explores the relationship of HLE at 
the age of 65 years (HLE_65) with four variables that are representative of 
institutional inclusivity or extractiveness of health systems.
RESULTS: Results indicate that HLE_65 is positively associated with healthcare 
system institutional inclusivity as expressed in terms of the share of public 
healthcare expenditure and the spending on preventive care. HLE_65 is inversely 
associated with the strength of extracting characteristics of the system, such 
as the market power of physicians and the share of specialists in the total 
number of physicians.
CONCLUSION: In this light, the development of health policies that aim to 
strengthen inclusive institutions, such as the focus on prevention, financial 
protection and primary care, could have a significant positive impact in 
collective welfare and social cohesion - especially for populations in rural, 
remote and less developed parts of the world.

OBJECTIVES: Health technology assessment (HTA) plays a central role in the 
coverage and reimbursement decision-making process for public health expenditure 
in many countries, including Thailand. However, there have been few attempts to 
quantitatively understand the benefits of using HTA to inform resource 
allocation decisions. The objective of this research was to simulate the 
expected net monetary benefit (NMB) from using HTA-based decision criteria 
compared to a first-come, first-served (FCFS) approach using data from Thailand.
METHODS: A previously published simulation model was adapted to the Thai context 
which aimed to simulate the impact of using different decision-making criteria 
to adopt or reject health technologies for public reimbursement. Specifically, 
the simulation model provides a quantitative comparison between an HTA-based 
funding rule and a counterfactual (FCFS) funding rule to make decisions on which 
health technologies should be funded. The primary output of the model was the 
NMB of using HTA-based decision criteria compared to the counterfactual 
approach. The HTA-based decision rule in the model involved measuring 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratios against a cost-effectiveness threshold. 
The counterfactual decision rule was a FCFS (random) selection of health 
technologies.
RESULTS: The HTA-based decision rule was associated with a greater NMB compared 
to the counterfactual. In the investigated analyses, the NMB ranged from 
THB24,238 million (USD725 million) to THB759,328 million (USD22,719 million). 
HTA-based decisions led to fewer costs, superior health outcomes (more 
quality-adjusted life-years).
CONCLUSIONS: The results support the hypothesis that HTA can provide health and 
economic benefits by improving the efficiency of resource allocation decision 
making.

BACKGROUND: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a global public health issue, with 
Asia accounting for one of the highest CKD prevalence worldwide. This study 
examines the burden of CKD in Asian continent in the last three decades.
DATA AND METHODS: The estimates of age, sex and year wise burden of CKD for 49 
countries in Asia for 1990 to 2019 were procured from the Global Burden of 
Disease 2019 study.
FINDINGS: In 2019, there were 9.8 million [9.0-10.6 million] new cases and 
763 024 [696 050-823 829] deaths due to CKD in Asia. Between 1990 and 2019, CKD 
prevalence doubled from 202.4 million [186.5-219.1 million] to 431.2 
[400.3-462.0 million]. Although age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR) of CKD 
increased from 170.6 [156.7-186.2] in 1990 to 206.3 [190.4-223.4] per 100 000 
person-years in 2019, the age-standardized mortality rate (ASMR) witnessed a 
modest reduction from 18.4/100 000 [17.0-20.1] to 17.3/100 000 [15.7-18.7]. In 
2019, the ASIR spanned from 141.9/100 000 [126.2-159.2] in Tajikistan to 
561.4/100 000 [524.6-598.6] in Saudi Arabia, and ASMR varied from 8.9/100 000 
[7.2-9.8] in Japan to Saudi Arabia (52.9 [42.8-63.1]). Between 1990 and 2019, 
absolute count of CKD incident cases, deaths, prevalent cases and 
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) increased 100% or more in 48/49, 32/49, 
43/49 and 23/49 countries, respectively.
INTERPRETATION: CKD is widespread in the Asian region, with an alarming burden 
in resource-constrained countries. Strategies such as promoting awareness, 
screening among high-risk individuals, provision of cost-effective therapies, 
and increased healthcare coverage could help deal with the CKD epidemic in Asia.

PURPOSE: Contralateral graft harvest in primary ACL reconstruction is relatively 
uncommon and the long-term comparative of this approach relative to ipsilateral 
harvest has not been described. The purpose of this study was to evaluate ACL 
graft and contralateral rupture following ipsilateral or contralateral 
semitendinosus and gracilis (STG) graft harvest at follow-up of a minimum 
10 years post-reconstruction in the treatment of a complete ACL tear.
METHODS: Patients from a previous randomized trial were evaluated. The primary 
outcome measures were ipsilateral and contralateral reinjury as well as the 
International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) knee assessment form, the ACL 
Quality of Life questionnaire (ACL-QoL) and the Tegner activity scale. 
Participants completed four different single-leg hop tests and concentric knee 
flexion and extension strength were assessed on an isokinetic dynamometer.
RESULTS: Of the original 100 patients, 50 patients (41.3 ± 9.5 years of age, 31 
males, 19 females) reported on re-injury at 12.6 ± 1.4 years post-operative. 
Thirty-eight patients returned for full assessment and 12 responded by mail or 
phone survey. There were no differences between groups for graft rupture, 
contralateral injury, ACL-QoL score, IKDC categorization, or anterior tibial 
translation, though both groups experienced a reduction in the Tegner Activity 
Scale from their preinjury scores. There was no difference in knee flexor and 
extensor isokinetic concentric strength, or single leg hop test performance. 
Knee flexor strength limb symmetry index was reduced when measured in the supine 
relative to the seated position in both groups, indicating persistent deficits 
in knee flexor strength when measured in the supine position.
CONCLUSION: Contralateral hamstring harvest does not put patients at an 
increased risk of a contralateral ACL tear and long-term outcomes of ACL 
reconstruction do not differ based on the side of graft harvest. Contralateral 
STG harvest may provide a safe alternative surgical option for select patients.

BACKGROUND: Gastrectomy with lymphadenectomy is recommended for early gastric 
Neuroendocrine carcinoma (G-NEC). We attempted to determine the prevalence and 
risk factors of metastasis of T1 G-NEC and compare the long-term survival of 
patients after receiving endoscopic therapy (ET) and radical surgery.
METHODS: In this study, 205 patients in total with T1 G-NEC were collected from 
the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Result database. Independent predictors of 
metastasis were identified by Logistic regression analysis, followed by the 
calculation of both cancer-specific survival (CSS) and overall survival (OS).
RESULTS: Twenty-five patients (12.2%) were burdened with metastasis at initial 
diagnosis, with a prevalence of 5.2% (3/58) in mucosa lesions and 16.2% (16/99) 
in submucosa lesions (P = 0.045). No metastasis was detected in lesions with 
mucosa involvement and tumors ≦ 20 mm (0%, 0/49). The most significant risk 
factor for metastasis was tumors > 20 mm [odds ratio (OR) 18.64; 95% confidence 
interval (CI) 4.01-86.68; P < 0.001]. For patients with T1N0M0 G-NEC who 
received ET or surgery, the 10-year OS was similar between the mucosa extension 
and submucosa extension groups, which was 91.56% in ET group vs 87.50% in 
surgery group (P = 0.62) and 57.33% vs 77.83% (P = 0.11), respectively. In 
addition, the 10-year CSS was also similar between the mucosa extension and 
submucosa extension groups with 97.30% in ET vs 100% in surgery (P = 0.51) and 
97.62% vs 86.49% (P = 0.65).
CONCLUSIONS: In G-NEC, tumors > 20 mm were considered as the most significant 
risk factor for metastasis. ET seemed adequate for the lesions with mucosa 
involvement and size ≦ 2 cm.

BACKGROUND: As a result of the increasing life expectancy of the western 
population, the number of older patients with chronic limb-threatening ischemia 
(CLTI) seeking medical care is growing. Our objective was to describe the 
characteristics of a consecutive series of nonagenarian patients with CLTI and 
evaluate the outcomes of their management.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective analysis of a consecutive series of 
nonagenarian patients with CLTI attended at our institution between 2005 and 
2019. Primary endpoints were 1-year limb salvage and survival rates.
RESULTS: A total of 171 patients were included (mean age 92.7, 51.5% women), of 
which in 59 (34.5%) primary major amputation (n = 10) or palliative care 
(n = 49) was indicated at presentation because of severe dementia (n = 30, 
50.8%), knee retraction (n = 17, 28.8%), terminal condition (n = 13, 22%) or a 
non-salvageable foot (n = 28, 47.4%). In the remaining 112 (65.5%), the need for 
a revascularization was further assessed finally performing A) conservative 
treatment/minor amputation (n = 57, 50.9%), B) revascularization (n = 50, 44.6%) 
or C) direct major amputation (n = 5, 4.4%), with 1-year limb salvage and 
survival rates of 93.1 and 57.4%, respectively. Predictive factors for lower 
survival included age &gt;92 years (HR = 1,59, p = 0.041), 
hemoglobin &lt;10.5 mg/dL (HR 2,34, p &lt; 0.001), congestive heart failure 
(HR = 1.65, p = 0.036), non-severe dementia (HR 3,11, p &lt; 0.001) and current 
mobility with wheelchair (HR 1,74, p = 0.014).
CONCLUSION: Nearly one-third of nonagenarian patients with CLTI have a direct 
indication for amputation or palliative care at presentation. In the remaining, 
a judicious approach with conservative treatment, minor amputation or 
revascularization procedures yields excellent limb salvage rates. Survival is, 
however, the cornerstone of these patients. It can be predicted with certain 
clinical factors which may help decision-making.

Gastrointestinal Conditions: Colorectal Cancer Screening and Prevention.

Davis J(1), Kellerman R(1).

KS 67214-3199.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third leading cause of cancer death in the United 
States. CRC screening reduces CRC deaths. Although the median age at diagnosis 
is 67 years, the incidence in younger individuals has been increasing, and 
younger patients are more likely to present with more advanced disease. In the 
past, guidelines recommended initiating screening at age 50 years. However, 
guidelines from multiple organizations now recommend initiating screening at age 
45 years. Screening should start even earlier in individuals with genetic risks 
for CRC. Recommendations about when to discontinue screening vary, but all 
guidelines recommend continuing at least to age 75 years. After age 75 years, 
screening should be based on patients' life expectancy, medical status, and 
values and goals. Colonoscopy is considered the gold standard screening test, 
but many patients decline colonoscopy because of its invasive nature and 
associated bowel preparation. Other tests recommended in guidelines include 
guaiac-based fecal occult blood test, fecal immunochemical and DNA tests, 
flexible sigmoidoscopy, and computed tomography colonography. Recommended 
screening intervals vary for each of these tests. Two newer screening tests, not 
yet included in guidelines, are Epi proColon (methylated septin DNA) assay 
(which detects methylation of the SEPT9 gene associated with CRC) and capsule 
colonography. All patients also should be informed about lifestyle and 
diet-related interventions that can decrease CRC risk.

PURPOSE: to compare observed overall survival vs age-adjusted lifetable (LT) 
derived life expectancy (LE) in metastatic urothelial bladder cancer (MBCa) 
patients according to race/ethnicity.
METHODS: We identified Caucasian, African American, Hispanic/Latino and Asian 
metastatic urothelial bladder cancer patients from 2004 to 2011 within the 
Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results database. Social Security 
Administration tables were used to compute 5 year LE. LT-derived LE was compared 
to observed overall survival OS. Additionally, we relied on Poisson regression 
plots to display cancer-specific mortality (CSM) relative to other-cause 
mortality (OCM) for each race/ethnicity.
RESULTS: Overall, 2286 MBCa patients were identified. Of those, 1800 (79%) were 
Caucasian vs 212 (9.3%) African American vs 189 (8.3%) Hispanic/Latino vs 85 
(3.7%) Asians. The median age at diagnosis was 71 years for Asians vs 70 for 
Caucasians vs 67 for Hispanic/Latinos vs 67 for African Americans. African 
Americans showed the biggest difference between observed OS and LT-predicted LE 
at five years (- 83.8%), followed by Hispanic/Latinos (- 81%), Caucasians 
(- 77%) and Asian patients (- 69%). In Poisson regression plots, 
Hispanic/Latinos displayed the highest cancer-specific mortality rate (88%), 
while African/Americans showed the highest other cause mortality rate (12%). 
Conversely, Asian patients displayed the lowest CSM rate (83%) and second lowest 
OCM rate (7%).
CONCLUSIONS: African Americans showed the least favorable survival profile in 
MBCa, despite being youngest at diagnosis. Contrarily, Asians displayed the best 
survival profile in MBCa, despite being oldest at diagnosis.

BACKGROUND: Patients with psychiatric disorders are at an increased risk of 
developing cardiovascular disease, reducing life expectancy. Autonomic 
dysfunction has been linked to this increased risk; many studies have found 
reductions in heart rate variability (HRV). Only a few studies have 
systematically explored the relationship between obsessive-compulsive disorder 
(OCD) and autonomic function, and they have found contradicting results. The 
present study is intended to explore comprehensive autonomic functions in OCD 
patients and compare them with healthy controls.
METHODS: A total of 18 OCD patients meeting Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of 
Mental Disorders - 5 (DSM-5) criteria were enrolled to undergo comprehensive 
autonomic function testing, and the results were compared with 25 age- and 
sex-matched healthy controls.
RESULTS: Time-domain parameters of HRV such as standard deviation of the RR 
intervals, coefficient of variance of RR intervals, standard deviation of 
differences between adjacent RR intervals, root square of the mean of the sum of 
the squares of differences between adjacent RR intervals, and percentage of 
number of RR interval differences ≥ 50 ms were significantly lower in OCD 
patients, indicating lesser parasympathetic tone. Frequency-domain parameters 
such as total power and very low frequency were significantly lower in OCD 
patients, indicating a significant decrease in autonomic tone. Nonlinear 
parameters such as dispersion of points perpendicular to the line of identity 
and dispersion of points along the line of identity were significantly lower in 
OCD patients, indicating altered vagal and sympathetic tone. In autonomic 
reactivity tests, the fall in systolic blood pressure during the lying to 
standing test and change in diastolic blood pressure during the cold pressor 
test were significantly altered in OCD patients, indicating abnormal sympathetic 
reactivity. There was no significant correlation between autonomic parameters 
and the severity of OCD.
CONCLUSION: OCD is characterized by a decreased parasympathetic tone and 
abnormal sympathetic reactivity compared to normal controls.

Quaternary period geological events and climatic oscillations significantly 
affect the geographic structure and genetic diversity of species distribution in 
arid northwestern China. Amygdalus mongolica is a relict and endangered shrub 
that occurs primarily in arid areas of northwestern China. Based on variation 
patterns present at three cpDNA regions (psbK-psbI, trnL-trnF and trnV) and in 
one nDNA sequence (ITS1-ITS4) in 174 individuals representing 15 populations, 
the spatial genetic structure and demographic history of A. mongolica was 
examined across its entire geographic range. The 17 different haplotypes and 10 
ribotypes showed two lineages, distributed across the Western (Mazong Mountains, 
Hexi Corridor, and Alxa Left Banner) and Eastern regions (Urad Houqi, Yinshan 
Mountains, Urad Zhongqi, and Daqing Mountains) according to the median-joining 
network and the BI (Bayesian inference) and ML (Maximum likelihood) trees. AMOVA 
analysis demonstrated that over 65% of the observed genetic variation was 
related to this lineage split. The expansions of the Ulanbuhe and Tengger 
deserts and the eastward extension of the Yinshan Mountains since the Quaternary 
period likely interrupted gene flow and triggered the observed divergence in the 
two allopatric regions; arid landscape fragmentation accompanied by local 
environmental heterogeneity further increased local adaptive differentiation 
between the Western and Eastern groups. Based on the evidence from 
phylogeographical patterns and the distribution of genetic variation, A. 
mongolica distributed in the eastern and western regions are speculated to have 
experienced eastward migration along the southern slopes of the Lang Mountains 
and westward migration along the margins of the Ulanbuhe and Tengger deserts to 
the Hexi Corridor, respectively. For setting a conservation management plan, it 
is recommended that the south slopes of the Lang Mountains and northern Helan 
Mountains be identified as the two primary conservation areas, as they have high 
genetic variation and habitats that are more suitable.

PURPOSE: Oral frailty is characterized by a decrease in the oral and swallowing 
function and is a risk factor for pneumonia. In the current study, we analyzed 
the association between the masseter muscle thickness (MMT) and postoperative 
pneumonia and mortality after endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) for abdominal 
aortic aneurysm.
METHODS: Overall, 247 patients were retrospectively evaluated. The primary end 
point was postoperative pneumonia. The MMT was measured as the maximum thickness 
of the masseter muscle 2 cm caudal to the zygomatic arch using computed 
tomography images obtained within 3 months before EVAR. Pneumonia was defined as 
the presence of progressive infiltrates, consolidation, or cavitation on imaging 
and a fever or leukocytosis.
RESULTS: Twenty (8.1%) cases of postoperative pneumonia occurred within 1 year 
after EVAR. We found that patients with a low MMT (≤ 30th percentile: males, 
10.4 mm; females: 8.8 mm) had a significantly higher risk of developing 
postoperative pneumonia within 1 year after elective EVAR than those with a high 
value. A comparison of the utility of the MMT and psoas muscle index (PMI) for 
predicting the 1-, 3-, and 5-year all-cause mortality revealed that the MMT had 
superior predictive performance.
CONCLUSION: The MMT before elective EVAR predicted postoperative pneumonia and 
life expectancy, and its predictive performance was superior to that of the PMI.

Termites are major decomposers in terrestrial ecosystems and the second most 
diverse lineage of social insects. The Kalotermitidae form the second-largest 
termite family and are distributed across tropical and subtropical ecosystems, 
where they typically live in small colonies confined to single wood items 
inhabited by individuals with no foraging abilities. How the Kalotermitidae have 
acquired their global distribution patterns remains unresolved. Similarly, it is 
unclear whether foraging is ancestral to Kalotermitidae or was secondarily 
acquired in a few species. These questions can be addressed in a phylogenetic 
framework. We inferred time-calibrated phylogenetic trees of Kalotermitidae 
using mitochondrial genomes of ∼120 species, about 27% of kalotermitid 
diversity, including representatives of 21 of the 23 kalotermitid genera. Our 
mitochondrial genome phylogenetic trees were corroborated by phylogenies 
inferred from nuclear ultraconserved elements derived from a subset of 28 
species. We found that extant kalotermitids shared a common ancestor 84 Ma 
(75-93 Ma 95% highest posterior density), indicating that a few disjunctions 
among early-diverging kalotermitid lineages may predate Gondwana breakup. 
However, most of the ∼40 disjunctions among biogeographic realms were dated at 
<50 Ma, indicating that transoceanic dispersals, and more recently 
human-mediated dispersals, have been the major drivers of the global 
distribution of Kalotermitidae. Our phylogeny also revealed that the capacity to 
forage is often found in early-diverging kalotermitid lineages, implying the 
ancestors of Kalotermitidae were able to forage among multiple wood pieces. Our 
phylogenetic estimates provide a platform for critical taxonomic revision and 
future comparative analyses of Kalotermitidae.

BACKGROUND AND AIM: High prevalence of anxiety symptoms has been reported 
globally in the university students. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is the 
recognized treatment for anxiety and is traditionally conducted face-to-face 
(f-CBT). The efficacy of internet-based CBT (i-CBT) for anxiety has been 
extensively studied, yet evidence on its cost-effectiveness is scarce. We aimed 
to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of guided low-intensity i-CBT for university 
students with mild anxiety symptoms from the societal perspective of Hong Kong.
METHODS: A 5-year Markov model was designed to compare outcomes of guided i-CBT 
and f-CBT in a hypothetical cohort of university students with mild anxiety 
symptoms. Model inputs of cost and healthcare resources associated with anxiety 
were retrospectively collected from a cohort of university students with anxiety 
symptoms. Clinical and utility model inputs were retrieved from published 
literature. Model outcome measures were anxiety-related total cost (including 
direct medical and indirect costs) and quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). 
Sensitivity analyses were performed to examine the robustness of base-case 
results.
RESULTS: In base-case analysis, i-CBT gained higher QALYs (2.9956 versus 2.9917) 
at lower total cost (US$6,101 versus US$6,246) than f-CBT. In one-way 
sensitivity analysis, the QALY gained by i-CBT was sensitive to the relative 
patient acceptance and adherence to CBT. In probabilistic sensitivity analysis, 
i-CBT was cost-effective in 90.9% of the time at the willingness-to-pay 
threshold of 138,210 per QALY (3× GDP per capita in Hong Kong). The probability 
of i-CBT to be cost-effective was 99.9% at a willingness-to-pay threshold of 
zero.
CONCLUSIONS: Guided i-CBT appears to be cost-saving and effective for management 
of university students with mild symptoms of anxiety from the societal 
perspective of Hong Kong. The cost-effectiveness of i-CBT is highly subject to 
the individual acceptance and adherence of CBT delivered by the internet 
platform.

Tetranychidae) Based on Developmental Performance and Physiological Enzyme 
Activity.

The spider mite, Tetranychus pueraricola (Ehara & Gotoh; Acari: Tetranychidae), 
is a serious pest in agriculture and horticulture. Application of chemical 
pesticides is the main mode of this pest control. Due to pesticide residues and 
resistance-induced resurgence of pests, there is a need to discover alternatives 
for spider mite management. GC16 comprises a mixture of calcium chloride (CaCl2, 
45%) and lecithin (55%), which was recently found to have acaricidal properties. 
We evaluated the sublethal effects of GC16 on T. pueraricola using life table 
and enzyme [catalase (CAT), peroxidase (POD), superoxide dismutase (SOD), 
carboxylesterase (CarE), glutathione S-transferases (GST), and Ca2+-ATPase 
(Ca2+-ATP)] activity assays. The results showed that fecundity of T. pueraricola 
increased at LC30 but decreased at LC50 of GC16. The intrinsic rate of increase 
(r) of T. pueraricola decreased under the LC30 and LC50 of GC16. GC16 
concentration and exposure time significantly influenced the activities of CAT, 
POD, CarE, GST, and Ca2+-ATP in adult mites. Twelve hours later after the 
treatment, GST and Ca2+-ATP activities were significantly inhibited by LC30 but 
enhanced by LC50. Moreover, the demographic parameter r and enzyme activities 
were negatively correlated. In sum, sublethal amounts of GC16 had an adverse 
effect on mites, and there was a trade-off between developmental performance and 
physiological enzyme activity of mites under GC16 stress, and GC16 showed an 
acaricidal potential for T. pueraricola. This work provides guidance for the 
application of GC16 to control T. pueraricola.

As life expectancy increases, there is a growing consensus on the development of 
integrated care encompassing the health and daily activities of older adults. In 
recent years, although the demand for machine learning applications in 
healthcare has increased, only a few studies have implemented machine 
learning-based systems in integrated care for older adults owing to the complex 
needs of older adults and the coarseness of the available data. Our study aims 
to explore the possibility of implementing machine learning decision-support 
algorithms in the integrated care of older community-dwelling adults. Our 
experiment uses secondary data based on the community-based integrated service 
model. Such data were collected from 511 older adults through 162 assessment 
items in which tailored services were selected from 18 available services. We 
implemented four machine learning models: decision tree, random forest, 
K-nearest neighbors, and multilayer perceptron. The area under the receiver 
operating characteristic curve results of the four models were decision tree = 
0.89, K-nearest neighbors = 0.88, random forest = 0.93, and multilayer 
perceptron = 0.88. The results suggest that machine learning-based 
decision-assisting algorithms can improve the quality of tailored services for 
integrated care with intensive involvement of face-to-face tasks by reducing the 
simple, repetitive tasks of care managers.

OBJECTIVE: To characterize lateral lumbar interbody fusion surgical learning 
curve and investigate changes in perioperative and postoperative clinical 
parameters associated with increased operative experience.
METHODS: In a case series, surgical learning curve was defined using 3-parameter 
asymptotic regression and piecewise linear regression, yielding learning phase 
(patients 1-53) and proficient phase (patients 54-179) cohorts. Using a 5-point 
grading scale, ipsilateral iliopsoas (hip-flexion) and quadriceps 
(knee-extension) muscle strength and thigh and groin sensory disturbances were 
compared for differences preoperatively versus postoperatively using χ2 test. 
Patient-reported outcome measures were collected preoperatively and 
postoperatively and compared between cohorts with unpaired t test.
RESULTS: The proficient phase cohort demonstrated significantly reduced 
operative time, estimated blood loss, postoperative length of stay, and narcotic 
consumption on postoperative days 0 and 1. The proficient phase cohort displayed 
decreased disability at 6 weeks and 6 months and demonstrated significant 
improvement at all time points for disability, pain, and physical function 
except for 6 weeks and 2 years for physical function, whereas the learning phase 
cohort demonstrated improvement in disability beginning at 6 months, leg pain at 
all time points, and back pain through 6 months. Ipsilateral groin and thigh 
sensory disturbances and iliopsoas and quadriceps weakness improved with 
increasing operative experience.
CONCLUSIONS: The proficient phase cohort demonstrated significantly improved 
perioperative profile, reduced complication rate, and reduced rates of iliopsoas 
and quadriceps weakness. While the proficient phase cohort demonstrated earlier 
improvement in disability and physical function scores compared with the 
learning phase cohort, 2-year outcome measures did not differ. Long-term 
clinical outcomes suggest that patient safety and quality of life are not 
compromised during the learning phase, but patients may be particularly 
susceptible to femoral nerve injury early in a surgeon's practice.

There is no universal recommendation for managing the reactivation of HBV in 
patients with resolved HBV infection treated with anti-CD20 monoclonal 
antibodies for B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma. This study compared the 
cost-effectiveness of two commonly used strategies: prophylactic anti-HBV 
nucleos(t)ide analog therapy (Pro NAT), and HBV DNA monitoring followed by 
on-demand antiviral therapy (HBV DNA monitoring). Using a decision tree model, 
the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) expressed as cost per 
quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained was calculated. The threshold for 
cost-effectiveness was set at 5,000,000 JPY, equivalent to 45,662 USD. In a 
base-case analysis, HBV DNA monitoring was found to be more cost-effective based 
on the calculation of ICER as 132,048 USD per QALY, a value that far exceeds 
45,662 USD. The same results were consistently obtained by a one-way 
deterministic sensitivity analysis, even after changing each parameter value 
within the predetermined range. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis with 10,000 
simulations also revealed that HBV DNA monitoring is more cost-effective than 
Pro NAT in 96.8% of cases. Therefore, this study suggests that HBV DNA 
monitoring is an appropriate managing measure in Japan from a cost-effectiveness 
perspective.

BACKGROUND: In clinical practice and science, there is debate for which older 
adults the benefits of cardiovascular preventive medications (CPM) still 
outweigh the risks in older age. Therefore, we aimed to assess how various 
clinical characteristics influence the judgement of appropriateness of CPM in 
older adults.
METHOD: We assessed the appropriateness of CPM for adults ≥75 years with regard 
to clinical characteristics (cardiovascular variables, complexity of health 
problems, age, side effects and life expectancy) using the RAND/ University of 
California at Los Angeles Appropriateness Method. A multidisciplinary panel, 
including 11 medical professionals and 3 older representatives of the target 
population, received an up-to-date overview of the literature. Using 9-point 
Likert scales (1 = extremely inappropriate; 9 = extremely appropriate), they 
assessed the appropriateness of starting and stopping cholesterol lowering 
medication, antihypertensives and platelet aggregation inhibitors, for various 
theoretical clinical scenarios. There were two rating rounds, with one 
face-to-face discussion in between. The overall appropriateness judgments were 
based on the median panel ratings of the second round and level of disagreement.
RESULTS: The panelists emphasized the importance of the individual context of 
the patient for appropriateness of CPM. They judged that in general, a history 
of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease strongly adds to the appropriateness 
of CPM, while increasing complexity of health problems, presence of hindering or 
severe side effects, and life expectancy < 1 year all contribute to the 
inappropriateness of CPM. Age had only minor influence on the appropriateness 
judgments. The appropriateness judgments were different for the three types of 
CPM. The literature, time-to-benefit, remaining life expectancy, number needed 
to treat, and quality of life, were major themes in the panel discussions. The 
considerations to stop CPM were different from the considerations not to start 
CPM.
CONCLUSION: Next to the patients' individual context, which was considered 
decisive in the final decision to start or stop CPM, there were general trends 
of how clinical characteristics influenced the appropriateness, according to the 
multidisciplinary panel. The decision to stop, and not start CPM, appeared to be 
two distinct concepts. Results of this study may be used in efforts to support 
clinical decision making about CPM in older adults.
