influence future health and wealth among people living with HIV (PLWH). What 
remains unknown is how PLWH in care perceive the benefits of ART adherence, 
particularly in terms of improving health and wealth in the short and long-term 
at the individual, household, and structural levels. Understanding 
future-oriented attitudes towards ART may help policymakers tailor care and 
treatment programs with both short and long-term-term health benefits in mind, 
to improve HIV-related outcomes for PLWH.
METHODS: In this qualitative study, we conducted semi-structured interviews 
among a subsample of 40 PLWH in care at a clinic in Uganda participating in a 
randomized clinical trial for treatment adherence in Uganda (clinicaltrials.gov: 
NCT03494777). Interviews were transcribed verbatim and translated from Luganda 
into English. Two co-authors independently reviewed transcripts, developed a 
detailed codebook, achieved 93% agreement on double-coded interviews, and 
analyzed data using inductive and deductive content analysis. Applying the 
social-ecological framework at the individual, household, and structural levels, 
we examined how PLWH perceived health and wealth-related benefits to ART.
RESULTS: Our findings revealed several benefits of ART expressed by PLWH, going 
beyond the short-term health benefits to also include long-term economic 
benefits. Such benefits largely focused on the ability of PLWH to live longer 
and be physically and mentally healthy, while also fulfilling responsibilities 
at the individual level pertaining to themselves (especially in terms of 
positive long-term habits and motivation to work harder), at the household level 
pertaining to others (such as improved relations with family and friends), and 
at the structural level pertaining to society (in terms of reduced stigma, 
increased comfort in disclosure, and higher levels of civic responsibility).
CONCLUSIONS: PLWH consider short and long-term health benefits of ART. 
Programming designed to shape ART uptake and increase adherence should emphasize 
the broader benefits of ART at various levels. Having such benefits directly 
integrated into the design of clinic-based HIV interventions can be useful 
especially for PLWH who face competing interests to increase medication 
adherence. These benefits can ultimately help providers and policymakers better 
understand PLWH's decision-making as it relates to improving ART-related 
outcomes.

BACKGROUND: HIV infection affects millions of people globally. Currently, 
although several drugs have brought an improvement in the quality and life 
expectancy of these individuals, they are accompanied by several adverse 
effects.
OBJECTIVE: To conduct a systematic review of studies examining the relationship 
between antiretroviral therapy (ART) uses and secondary dyslipidemia.
METHODS: The review followed the criteria defined by PRISMA. Only articles that 
completely evaluated the lipid profile were included, which consisted of total 
cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), and LDL cholesterol (LDL-c), HDL 
cholesterol (HDL-c).
RESULTS: It was observed that the use of nucleoside and non-nucleoside reverse 
transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI and NNRTI respectively) drugs and protease 
inhibitors are the most used in ART and are associated with changes in lipid 
profiles. The main changes observed were increases in TC, TG, and LDL-c in 
addition to a decrease in HDL-c. These patients had a higher risk of developing 
cardiovascular disease not only due to the use of therapy, but also due to the 
presence of other comorbidities evaluated in these studies, such as obesity, 
diabetes, and hypertension. The increase in age, the difference between genders, 
CD4 T-cell count, and viral load, were observed as risk factors for worsening 
dyslipidemia.
CONCLUSION: According to the findings of this study, anti-HIV therapy is linked 
to dyslipidemia, which may or may not be the primary cause, and is frequently 
connected with a number of metabolic problems that can exacerbate the illness.

Herein, we demonstrate an effective approach toward functionalization of 
cellulose nanocrystal (CNC) reducing ends by means of a Knoevenagel condensation 
reaction with a reactive β-diketone (acetylacetone). The end-wise modification 
was elucidated by advanced NMR analysis, which was facilitated by dissolving the 
CNCs in ionic liquid electrolyte and by the concomitant assignment of a model 
compound derived from d-cellobiose. The diffusion-edited 1H experiment afforded 
a simple method to identify the assigned model resonances in the reducing 
end-modified CNCs. The condensations can be carried out in aqueous bicarbonate 
solutions, avoiding the use of hazardous solvents. Under these preliminary 
aqueous conditions, end-group conversion of up to 12.5% could be confirmed. 
These results demonstrate the potential of β-diketone chemistry and the 
Knoevenagel condensation for functionalizing cellulose reducing ends. 
Application of this liquid-state NMR method for confirming and quantifying 
reducing end conversion is also shown to be invaluable. Extension of this 
chemistry to other 1,3-dicarbonyl compounds and solvation conditions should 
allow for the topochemical and (axially) chirotopic installation of functional 
moieties to CNCs, paving the way to asymmetric cellulose-based nanomaterials 
with unique properties.

Patau syndrome is the third most frequent chromosomal trisomy, with an estimated 
mortality rate that is about 50 times higher than the general neonatal mortality 
rate. Trisomy 13 mosaicism is a subtype that may result in a milder form of the 
disease, potentially leading to a longer life expectancy in these patients, 
allowing them to reach puberty. In this report, we discuss the case of a young 
boy who was evaluated for delayed puberty and karyotyping revealed mosaicism for 
trisomy 13. A detailed history, physical examination and appropriate laboratory 
studies and imaging were performed that showed a picture of suggestive of 
hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and an abnormal male karyotype with mosaicism for 
trisomy 13. To date, there is no clear explanation to the association between 
trisomy 13 and gonadal axis, specifically with normal imaging of pituitary. We 
postulate that delayed puberty could be a clinical feature of mosaic trisomy 13.

Quantifying intraspecific trait variation (ITV) is crucial for understanding 
species local adaptation and regional distribution. Intraspecific seed mass 
variation (ITVsm) is expected to vary with environmental gradients or co-vary 
with related biotic attributes, but these relationships are not well known in a 
multispecies space. We performed interspecific and phylogenetic analyses to 
evaluate the relative power of three species biotic attributes and four niche 
breadth traits in explaining ITVsm variation for 434 eastern Qinghai-Tibetan 
species. We showed a positive relationship between species' ITVsm and their 
niche breadth in the light, moisture and disturbance dimensions, supporting the 
idea that high ITV allows species to match their traits to different habitat 
conditions and thus to distribute in a wide range of environments. However, we 
did find significant direct effect of species' thermal niche on individual seed 
mass variation. Meanwhile, we showed significant effects of seed dispersal mode, 
but not of life form and pollination type, on ITVsm. This suggests that the 
covariation or co-evolution between seed and disperser was related to the 
pattern and magnitude of ITVsm, but not to plant lifespan, the quality and 
allocation pattern of available resources and the availability of pollination 
vector. Lastly, all multivariate models showed a significant combined 
contribution of species' biotic attributes and niche breadth to their ITVsm, 
implying that intrinsic biotic limitations and extrinsic abiotic pressures may 
operate simultaneously in controlling regional-scale intraspecific seed 
development.

Does the Mortality of Individuals with Severe Disabilities Contribute to the 
Persistent East-West Mortality Gap Among German Men?

After three decades since reunification male life expectancy in East Germany 
still lags behind that of West Germany. Unlike most of the prior studies 
focusing on the role of socioeconomic factors, this study aims at assessing the 
contribution of the population with severe disabilities to the persistent 
East-West male mortality gap. Our analysis is mainly based on the German Pension 
Fund data. It is restricted to men aged 30-59 receiving disability pension (DP). 
We estimate mortality indicators and compare trends among populations with or 
without DP. We use decomposition method to quantify the effects of changes in 
mortality and compositional changed in the prevalence of receiving DP on the 
East-West mortality difference. The analysis covers the period 1995-2013. The 
German Socioeconomic Panel data and Cox proportional hazard models are used to 
evaluate the regional differences in the risk of receiving DP. Our results 
suggest that both the higher prevalence of receiving DP in the East and the 
higher mortality level among men not receiving DP in the East explain the 
East-West gap. The mortality difference among those receiving DP is negligible 
and does not contribute much to it. The observed higher prevalence in receiving 
DP in the East is very likely to reflect the reality as we found no regional 
differences in the risk of transitioning to receiving DP. The disadvantageous 
position of the East can be explained by the post-reunification crisis which 
particularly hit young men in the 1990s, selective migration from East to West 
after reunification, and the higher proportion of the healthier foreign 
population living in the West.

Shiraz University, Shiraz, Iran.

Today, various solutions have been proposed to improve the economic situation of 
villages and deprived areas, among which tourism is known as the best solution 
for those areas with the necessary potentials for tourism development. On other 
hand, the COVID-19 pandemic had significant effects on human life worldwide. The 
prevalence of COVID-19 has caused a lot of damage to different sectors of the 
global economy, but without a doubt, the rural tourism industry should be 
considered among the economic activities that have suffered the most from this 
virus. In this study, with the aim of investigating these effects on the rural 
tourism industry, it has been analyzed and compared in three important economic, 
social and environmental dimensions before and after the outbreak of the 
COVID-19. This quantitative study was used survey method. The statistical 
population of the study consisted of local stakeholders of rural tourism and 
experts of the relevant organizations in Natanz county of Iran. The results of 
confirmatory factor analysis indicate that the constructs used in the model have 
appropriate and acceptable fit. The results of the study also, showed that the 
prevalence of COVID-19 has adverse consequences including reducing the desirable 
economic and social effects of tourism mentioned among both groups of experts 
and rural stakeholders. from rural tourism stakeholders' opinion, environmental 
variables of the tourism areas before and after the COVID-19 was different, and 
in the absence of tourists in this area, the destructive environmental effects 
have strongly decreased.

The types of β-thalassemia mutations, α-thalassemia interactions, and Hb 
F-associated SNPs have been described in association with variable disease 
phenotypes. This study aimed to determine the updated spectrum of β-thalassemia 
mutations and evaluate the contribution of primary and secondary genetic 
modifiers and SNPs to disease severity, age at onset, and predicted life 
expectancy in southern Thai β-thalassemia patients. A total of 181 β-thalassemia 
patients were enrolled and 135 β0-thalassemia/Hb E patients without 
α-thalassemia interactions were divided into three categories according to 
disease severity, age at onset, and predicted life expectancy. A total of 16 
β-thalassemia mutations were identified in this study, and the three most common 
β-thalassemia mutations accounted for 61.4% of all mutations. It was also found 
that the XmnI polymorphism and rs2071348 were associated with age at onset and 
the predicted life expectancy. More than 82% of β0-thalassemia/Hb E patients 
with CC genotype (XmnI) were 3 years old or younger at onset. Additionally, >90% 
of the higher predicted life expectancy in β0-thalassemia/Hb E patients had the 
T allele of XmnI. Therefore, genetic prediction for age at onset and life 
expectancy is beneficial and practical during prenatal diagnosis or newborn 
screening for better genetic counseling and optimal management.

Cancer was predicted as the leading cause of death and the most important 
obstacle to the increased life expectancy in the 21st century worldwide. The 
World Health Organization (WHO) estimated number of new cases of cancers in 2020 
about 19 million, and this number is estimated to be more than 295300000 people 
up to 2040 (more than 55% increase during next 20 years). Standard treatments 
for cancer include surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. However, all of 
these methods have dangerous side effects, so researchers are more interested in 
finding novel and less risky therapies. In recent years, there has been a great 
deal of interest in the development of anticancer agents obtained from foods or 
natural products. The relative safety of natural and food-derived compounds 
makes them attractive alternatives to conventional cancer treatment drugs. As a 
result, the majority of people are advised to use complementary and alternative 
medicine to treat and prevent cancer. In recent years, honey, as a natural 
product, has attracted many researchers' attention as an alternative to 
conventional anticancer drugs. Natural honey has long been used as a medicine 
and nutrient and its beneficial effects on various diseases in animal and human 
models have been studied. It was found that it has a wide range of therapeutic 
properties, including antioxidant, antibacterial, antiviral, anti-fungal, 
anti-diabetic, anti-inflammatory, anti-hypertensive, antiarrhythmic, wound 
healing, and liver protection benefits. This article aimed to review the role of 
natural honey in the prevention and treatment of a number of important cancers 
and their subsequent complications.

BACKGROUND: Cancers are leading causes of mortality and morbidity, with smoking 
being recognized as a significant risk factor for many types of cancer. We aimed 
to report the cancer burden attributable to tobacco smoking by sex, age, 
socio-demographic index (SDI), and cancer type in 204 countries and territories 
from 1990 to 2019.
METHODS: The burden of cancers attributable to smoking was reported between 1990 
and 2019, based upon the Comparative Risk Assessment approach used in the Global 
Burden of Disease (GBD) study 2019.
RESULTS: Globally, in 2019 there were an estimated 2.5 million cancer-related 
deaths (95% UI: 2.3 to 2.7) and 56.4 million DALYs (51.3 to 61.7) attributable 
to smoking. The global age-standardized death and DALY rates of cancers 
attributable to smoking per 100,000 decreased by 23.0% (-29.5 to -15.8) and 
28.6% (-35.1 to -21.5), respectively, over the period 1990-2019. Central Europe 
(50.4 [44.4 to 57.6]) and Western Sub-Saharan Africa (6.7 [5.7 to 8.0]) had the 
highest and lowest age-standardized death rates, respectively, for cancers 
attributable to smoking. In 2019, the age-standardized DALY rate of cancers 
attributable to smoking was highest in Greenland (2224.0 [1804.5 to 2678.8]) and 
lowest in Ethiopia (72.2 [51.2 to 98.0]). Also in 2019, the global number of 
DALYs was highest in the 65-69 age group and there was a positive association 
between SDI and the age-standardized DALY rate.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study clearly illustrate that renewed efforts 
are required to increase utilization of evidence-based smoking cessation support 
in order to reduce the burden of smoking-related diseases.

Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS) is a rare complex genetic disease that is associated 
with pathological disorders that include endocrine disruption, developmental, 
neurological, and physical problems as well as intellectual, and behavioral 
dysfunction. In early stage, PWS is characterized by respiratory distress, 
hypotonia, and poor sucking ability, causing feeding concern and poor weight 
gain. Additional features of the disease evolve over time. These include 
hyperphagia, obesity, developmental, cognitive delay, skin picking, high pain 
threshold, short stature, growth hormone deficiency, hypogonadism, strabismus, 
scoliosis, joint laxity, or hip dysplasia. The disease is associated with a 
shortened life expectancy. There is no cure for PWS, although interventions are 
available for symptoms management. PWS is caused by genetic defects in 
chromosome 15q11.2-q13, and categorized into three groups, namely Paternal 
deletion, Maternal uniparental disomy, and Imprinting defect. PWS is confirmed 
through genetic testing and DNA-methylation analysis. Studies revealed that at 
least two key proteins namely MAGEL-2 and NECDIN along with two proteases PCSK1 
and PCSK2 are linked to PWS. Herein, we summarize our current understanding and 
knowledge about the role of these proteins and enzymes in various biological 
processes associated with PWS. The review also describes how loss and/or 
impairment of functional activity of these macromolecules can lead to hormonal 
disbalance by promoting degradation of secretory granules and via inhibition of 
proteolytic maturation of precursor-proteins. The present review will draw 
attention of researchers, scientists, and academicians engaged in PWS study and 
will help to identify potential targets and molecular pathways for PWS 
intervention and treatment.

BACKGROUND: Although spinopelvic radiographs analysis is the standard for a 
pathological diagnosis, it cannot explain the activities of the spine in daily 
life. This study investigates the correlation between sagittal parameters and 
spinal range of motion (ROM) to find morphological parameters with kinetic 
implications.
METHODS: Six L1-S1 human lumbar specimens were tested with a robotic testing 
device. Eight sagittal parameters were measured in the three-dimensional model. 
Pure moments were applied to simulate the physiological activities in daily 
life.
RESULTS: The correlation between sagittal parameters and the ROM was moderate in 
flexion and extension, but weak in lateral bending and rotation. In 
flexion-extension, the ROM was moderately correlated with SS and LL. SS was the 
only parameter correlated with the ROM under all loading conditions. The 
intervertebral rotation distribution showed that the maximal ROM frequently 
occurred at the L5-S1 segment. The minimal ROM often appeared near the apex 
point of the lumbar.
CONCLUSION: Sagittal alignment mainly affected the ROM of the lumbar in flexion 
and extension. SS and apex may have had kinetic significance. Our findings 
suggest that the effect of sagittal parameters on lumbar ROM is important 
information for assessing spinal activity.

OBJECTIVE: Guidelines advocate against tight glycemic control in older nursing 
home (NH) residents with advanced dementia (AD) or limited life expectancy 
(LLE). We evaluated the effect of deintensifying diabetes medications with 
regard to all-cause emergency department (ED) visits, hospitalizations, and 
death in NH residents with LLE/AD and tight glycemic control.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a national retrospective cohort study 
of 2,082 newly admitted nonhospice veteran NH residents with LLE/AD potentially 
overtreated for diabetes (HbA1c ≤7.5% and one or more diabetes medications) in 
fiscal years 2009-2015. Diabetes treatment deintensification (dose decrease or 
discontinuation of a noninsulin agent or stopping insulin sustained ≥7 days) was 
identified within 30 days after HbA1c measurement. To adjust for confounding, we 
used entropy weights to balance covariates between NH residents who 
deintensified versus continued medications. We used the Aalen-Johansen estimator 
to calculate the 60-day cumulative incidence and risk ratios (RRs) for ED or 
hospital visits and deaths.
RESULTS: Diabetes medications were deintensified for 27% of residents. In the 
subsequent 60 days, 28.5% of all residents were transferred to the ED or acute 
hospital setting for any cause and 3.9% died. After entropy weighting, 
deintensifying was not associated with 60-day all-cause ED visits or 
hospitalizations (RR 0.99 [95% CI 0.84, 1.18]) or 60-day mortality (1.52 [0.89, 
2.81]).
CONCLUSIONS: Among NH residents with LLE/AD who may be inappropriately 
overtreated with tight glycemic control, deintensification of diabetes 
medications was not associated with increased risk of 60-day all-cause ED 
visits, hospitalization, or death.

Stridor is one of the most important signs of partial or complete upper airway 
obstruction. Subglottic hemangioma (SGH) is a well-recognized however infrequent 
cause of infantile stridor. It is a potentially life-threatening condition. 
Thus, early diagnosis and management are crucial. Diagnostic evaluation includes 
ultrasound, cross-sectional imaging such as contrast-enhanced CT/MRI, and 
tracheobronchoscopy. Ultrasound (US), although not a widely used modality for 
the diagnosis, provides good assessment of its presence, extent, and degree of 
subglottic airway narrowing. Moreover, color Doppler helps to establish the 
vascular nature of the lesion. There are many advantages of US over 
tracheobronchoscopy and CT in an emergency setting which include its easy 
availability, non-invasive nature, and can be done quickly as a bedside 
procedure, enabling early initiation of treatment. However, there are some 
disadvantages as well, which include limited field of view and operator 
dependency. Also, extension into the thoracic cavity and more deeply located 
soft tissue locations can be missed. We present a case of subglottic hemangioma 
in which US solved the diagnostic dilemma and provided a definite diagnosis when 
CT and tracheobronchoscopy failed to do so in a 6-month-old infant presenting 
with stridor to the ER.

Healthy mitochondria and their epigenetic control are essential to maintaining 
health, extending life expectancy, and improving cardiovascular performance. 
Strategies to maintain functional mitochondria during aging include training; 
cardiovascular exercise has been suggested as the best method, but strength 
training has also been identified as essential to health and healthy aging. We 
therefore investigated the effects of concurrent exercise training and dietary 
habits on epigenetic mechanisms involved in mitochondrial (mt) functions and 
biogenesis. We analyzed epigenetic biomarkers that directly target the key 
regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis, PGC-1α, and mtDNA content. Thirty-six 
healthy, sedentary participants completed a 12-week concurrent training program. 
Before and after the intervention, dried blood spot samples and data on eating 
habits, lifestyle, and body composition were collected. MiR-23a, miR-30e 
expression, and mtDNA content were analyzed using real-time quantitative 
polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis. PGC-1α methylation was analyzed using 
bisulfite pyrosequencing. MiR-23a, miR-30e expression, and PGC-1α methylation 
decreased after the intervention (p < 0.05). PGC-1α methylation increased with 
the consumption of red and processed meat, and mtDNA content increased with the 
ingestion of cruciferous vegetables (p < 0.05). Our results indicate that 
concurrent training could improve mitochondrial biogenesis and functions by 
altering the epigenetic regulation. These alterations can also be detected 
outside of the skeletal muscle and could potentially affect athletic 
performance.

We have previously found that sera from Crocodylus porosus contain anticancer 
agents and the treatment of MCF7 cells with this serum resulted in the 
differential expression of 51 genes. The purpose of this study was to use in 
silico analysis to identify genes that might be epigenetically modulated in 
cells treated with crocodile serum and to understand the role of potential genes 
as novel candidates with epigenetic therapeutic potential. The findings report 
five proto-oncogenes (TUBA1B, SLC2A1, PGK1, CCND1, and NCAPD2) and two tumor 
suppressor genes (RPLP2, RPL37) as novel therapeutic targets. Furthermore, we 
present a comprehensive overview of relevant studies on epigenetic regulation of 
these genes along with an insight into their clinical implications. Therefore, 
elucidating the molecules present in the serum and gut bacteria of reptiles such 
as crocodiles may offer insights into the role of these genes on longevity, 
health, disease, and life expectancy.

BACKGROUND: Disease status (eg, cancer stage) has been used in routine clinical 
practice to determine more accurate treatment plans. Health-related indicators, 
such as mortality, morbidity, and population group life expectancy, have also 
been used. However, few studies have specifically focused on the comprehensive 
and objective measures of individual health status.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to analyze the perspectives of the public 
toward 29 health indicators obtained from a literature review to provide 
evidence for further prioritization of the indicators. The difference between 
health status and disease status should be considered.
METHODS: This study used a cross-sectional design. Online surveys were 
administered through Ohio University, ResearchMatch, and Clemson University, 
resulting in three samples. Participants aged 18 years or older rated the 
importance of the 29 health indicators. The rating results were aggregated and 
analyzed as follows (in each case, the dependent variables were the individual 
survey responses): (1) to determine the agreement among the three samples 
regarding the importance of each indicator, where the independent variables 
(IVs) were the three samples; (2) to examine the mean differences between the 
retained indicators with agreement across the three samples, where the IVs were 
the identified indicators; and (3) to rank the groups of indicators into various 
levels after grouping the indicators with no mean differences, where the IVs 
were the groups of indicators.
RESULTS: In total, 1153 valid responses were analyzed. Descriptive statistics 
revealed that the top five-rated indicators were drug or substance abuse, 
smoking or tobacco use, alcohol abuse, major depression, and diet and nutrition. 
Among the 29 health indicators, the three samples agreed upon the importance of 
13 indicators. Inferential statistical analysis indicated that some of the 13 
indicators held equal importance. Therefore, the 13 indicators were categorized 
by rank into seven levels: level 1 included blood sugar level and immunization 
and vaccination; level 2 included LDL cholesterol; level 3 included HDL 
cholesterol, blood triglycerides, cancer screening detection, and total 
cholesterol; level 4 included health literacy rate; level 5 included personal 
care needs and air quality index greater than 100; level 6 included self-rated 
health status and HIV testing; and level 7 included the supply of dentists. 
Levels 1 to 3 were rated significantly higher than levels 4 to 7.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a baseline for prioritizing 29 health 
indicators, which can be used by electronic health record or personal health 
record system designers or developers to determine what can be included in the 
systems to capture an individual's health status. Currently, self-rated health 
status is the predominantly used health indicator. Additionally, this study 
provides a foundation for tracking and measuring preventive health care services 
more accurately and for developing an individual health status index.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Glucosamine is known to affect different health outcomes, 
however its effect on male and female lifespan is still unclear. We conducted a 
two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) study to investigate the association of 
genetically proxied glucosamine with longevity.
METHODS: Using genetic data from the Medical Research Council Integrative 
Epidemiology Unit (MRC-IEU) consortium for 461,384 individuals, we identified 
five genetic variants as instrumental variables for genetically predicted 
glucosamine. We obtained genetic associations of these variants with parental 
longevity as combined parental age at death (n = 208,118), mother's age at death 
(n = 246,941) and father's age at death (n = 317,652). We used the 
inverse-variance weighted method to estimate the effect of a 1-standard 
deviation (SD) increase in genetically predicted glucosamine on parental 
longevity.
RESULTS: We found a positive effect of genetically predicted higher glucosamine 
status on life expectancy using combined parental age at death. A 1-SD increase 
in genetically predicted glucosamine was associated with higher odds of combined 
parental age at death (odds ratio, 2.64; 95% CI 1.26, 5.54; P = 0.01), and 
maternal age at death (odds ratio, 1.73; 95 CI 1.04, 2.89; P = 0.03), but not 
paternal age at death (odds ratio, 1.32; 95% CI 0.81, 2.15; P = 0.27). Based on 
follow-up sensitivity analyses, we did not find evidence of pleiotropic effects 
of the genetic variants.
CONCLUSIONS: Lifelong higher levels of glucosamine may increase life expectancy. 
Positive effects of glucosamine were associated with maternal age at death only. 
The clinical implications of this sex-specific finding warrant further 
investigation.

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to investigate how multicriteria decision analysis 
(MCDA) could complement cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) to support investment 
decisions in elderly care at local level.
METHODS: We used an integrated elderly care program in The Netherlands as a case 
study to demonstrate the application of both methods. In a 12-month 
quasi-experimental study (n = 384), data on the following outcome measures were 
collected: quality-adjusted life-years (CEA) and physical functioning, 
psychological well-being, social relationships and participation, enjoyment of 
life, resilience, person centeredness, continuity of care, and costs (MCDA). We 
performed regression analysis on inversed probability weighted data and 
controlled for potential confounders to obtain a double robust estimate of the 
outcomes. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses determined uncertainty for both 
methods.
RESULTS: The integrated elderly care program was not likely (ie, 36%) to be 
cost-effective according to the CEA (incremental cost-effectiveness ratios: 
€88 249 from a societal perspective) using the conventional Dutch 
willingness-to-pay threshold (ie, €50 000). The MCDA demonstrated that informal 
caregivers and professionals slightly preferred the intervention over usual 
care, driven by enjoyment of life and person centeredness. Patients did not 
prefer either the intervention or usual care, whereas payers and policy makers 
slightly preferred usual care, mainly due to higher costs of the intervention.
CONCLUSIONS: MCDA could provide local-level decision makers with a broader 
measurement of effectiveness by including outcomes beyond health and longevity 
and the preferences of multiple stakeholders. This additional information could 
foster the acceptability and implementability of cost-effective innovations in 
elderly care.
