to guide objective decisions in uncertain scenarios. There is no comprehensive 
review summarizing the various decision analysis tools used. The authors aimed 
to appraise and review the decision analytic models used in hand surgery.
METHODS: A search of English articles on the PubMed, Ovid, and Embase databases 
was performed. All articles, regardless of date of publishing, were considered. 
Two reviewers, based on strict inclusion criteria, independently assessed each 
article.
RESULTS: The search resulted in 5525 abstracts, which yielded 30 studies that 
met inclusion criteria. Included studies were grouped according to medical 
indications, with scaphoid fractures (n = 6) and carpal tunnel syndrome (n = 5) 
being the most commonly reported. Included articles used decision analysis (n = 
15) and/or economic analyses (n = 23) to discuss diagnostic strategies or 
compare treatments. The three most common outcomes reported were utility (n = 
12), cost per quality-adjusted life-year (n = 16), and quality-adjusted 
life-years (n = 16). The decision analysis models compared diagnostic 
strategies, management options, and novel treatments.
CONCLUSIONS: Decision analysis is increasingly popular in hand surgery. It is 
useful for comparing surgical strategies through evaluation of quality-of-life 
outcomes and costing data. The most common model was a simple decision tree. The 
quality of decision analysis models can be improved with the addition of 
sensitivity analysis. Surgeons should be familiar with the principles of 
decision analysis, so that complex decisions can be evaluated using rigorous 
probabilistic models that combine risks and benefits of multiple strategies.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Sensorineural hearing loss (HL) is one of the most common 
public health problems, and its prevalence increases with increasing life 
expectancy. An association between HL and metabolic syndrome (MetS) is 
suspected. Although previous epidemiological studies have investigated the 
association between the two variables, there have been conflicting conclusions. 
Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the association between the presence of MetS-and 
individual components of MetS-and HL, using a longitudinal design and a 
large-scale population.
METHODS: A total of 17,513,555 individuals who underwent national health 
screening between January 2009 and December 2010 were identified. Subject data 
from the Korean Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service were reviewed. A 
total of 11,457,931 subjects were ultimately included in the analysis. Baseline 
comorbidities were defined according to the ICD-10 code from the Korean Health 
Insurance Review and Assessment Service data. If the participants had an ICD-10 
code for HL during the follow-up, they were defined as having incident HL. 
Criteria for MetS adhered to the revised National Cholesterol Education Program 
Adult Treatment Panel III.
RESULTS: There were 7,574,432 subjects without MetS and 3,883,499 with MetS. The 
incidence of HL in subjects without MetS and with MetS was 1.3% and 1.8% at 1 
year, 4.1% and 5.2% at 3 years, and 6.8% and 8.6% at 5 years, respectively (P < 
0.001). However, multivariate analyses revealed a negative association. Analyses 
according to the components of MetS demonstrated a positive association for 
those associated with dyslipidemia; however, the others exhibited an inverse 
association with HL. We also performed analyses using 4 groups according to the 
presence of MetS and the components of dyslipidemia. Univariate analysis 
revealed a positive association between the presence of MetS and HL; however, 
multivariate analysis revealed a positive association between the presence of 
dyslipidemia components and HL, regardless of the presence of MetS.
CONCLUSION: Among the components of MetS, the association between low HDL or 
high TG levels and HL was most apparent. It is useful to evaluate each MetS 
component in isolation, such as the presence of low HDL or high TG levels, 
rather than the presence of MetS as a cluster of components.

Individuals within the Arab world rarely access mental health services. One of 
the major reasons for this relates to the stigma associated with mental 
disorders. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), untreated and 
undiagnosed individuals living with moderate to severe mental health disorders 
are more likely to die 10-20 years earlier than the estimated life expectancy of 
the general population. Mental disorders also cause a large amount of costs to 
economies. Access to mental health services is out of reach for many individuals 
within in the Arab world due to insufficient planning, inadequate community 
resources, and military conflicts. Online mental health information and services 
are growing within the region; however, they are embedded and often sidelined 
within a wealth of other general health information. The purpose of this paper 
is to present the conceptual framework of the Mental Health Assistant (MeHA) 
digital platform being developed for the Arab world. The aim of this platform is 
to provide mental health information and educational resources through the use 
of a conversational agent, multi-media information, and to digitally connect 
patients with mental health service providers. The conceptual framework for the 
platform is based on mental health and information technology expert feedback, 
review of both academic and gray literature on mental health, and an examination 
of leading mental health digital platforms. As a result of this process, we 
developed a conceptual framework that will guide the development of the MeHA 
platform.

Iridium (Ir) thin film was deposited on patterned titanium substrate by 
direct-current (DC) magnetron sputtering, and then activated in sulfuric acid 
(H2SO4) through repetitive potential sweeps to form iridium oxide (IrOx) as 
neural electrode interface. The resultant IrOx film showed a porous and open 
morphology with aligned microstructure, exhibited superior electrochemical 
performance and excellent stability. The IrOx film supported neural stem cells 
(NSCs) attachment, proliferation and improved processes without causing 
toxicity. The patterned IrOx films offered a unique system to investigate the 
synergistic effects of topographical cue and electrical stimulation on neurite 
outgrowth. Electrical stimulation, when applied through patterned IrOx films, 
was found to further increase the neurite extension of neuron-like cells and 
significantly reorient the neurite alignment towards to the direction of 
stimulation. These results indicate that IrOx film, as electrode-tissue 
interface is highly stable and biocompatible with excellent electrochemical 
properties.

Fusarium species coexist as toxigenic, systemic pathogens in sweet corn seed 
production in southwestern Idaho, USA. We hypothesized that fungal antagonists 
of seedborne Fusarium would differentially alter production of Fusarium 
mycotoxins directly and/or systemically. We challenged the Fusarium complex by 
in vitro antagonism trials and in situ silk and seed inoculations with fungal 
antagonists. Fungal antagonists reduced growth and sporulation of Fusarium 
species in vitro from 40.5% to as much as 100%. Pichia membranifaciens and 
Penicillium griseolum reduced fumonisin production by F. verticillioides by 73% 
and 49%, respectively, while P. membranifaciens and a novel Penicillium sp. 
(WPT) reduced fumonisins by F. proliferatum 56% and 78%, respectively. In situ, 
pre-planting inoculation of seeds with Penicillium WPT systemically increased 
fumonisins in the resulting crop. Morchella snyderi applied to silks of an F1 
cross systemically reduced deoxynivalenol by 47% in mature seeds of the F2. 
Antagonists failed to suppress Fusarium in mature kernels following silk 
inoculations, although the ratio of F. verticillioides to total Fusarium double 
with some inoculants. Fusarium mycotoxin concentrations in sweet corn seed 
change systemically, as well as locally, in response to the presence of fungal 
antagonists, although in Fusarium presence in situ was not changed.

We provide a brief description of the development of the Trauma and Suicide 
Potential Index-5 (TSPI-5) and report on the psychometric properties of scores 
from the new instrument. The TSPI-5 is designed to assess an individual's desire 
to attempt suicide due to experiencing a trauma. We examined the structure of 
the instrument in two independent undergraduate samples. Study 1 (N = 415) 
examined the structure of the TSPI-5 using exploratory structural equation 
modeling. Study 2 (N = 538) reexamined the instrument structure using the same 
modeling strategy and also examined other validity estimates. Study 1 
demonstrated an adequate fit to the sample data (χ2 [1, N = 415] = 215.99, 
p < .001, comparative fit index (CFI ) = .969, Tucker-Lewis non-normed fit index 
(TLI) = .939, root mean squared error of approximation (RMSEA) = .319 [90% 
confidence interval (CI) = .283, .356], p < .001) and suggested evidence for 
unidimensionality. Study 2 confirmed the unidimensionality of the TSPI-5 as 
shown by acceptable fit estimates to the sample data, χ2 (5, N = 538) = 80.45, 
p < .001, CFI = .996, TLI = .99, RMSEA = .17 (90% CI = .140, .200), p < .001. 
Scale reliability estimates for the TSPI-5 were good in Study 1 (omega = .94) 
and Study 2 (omega = .96). The TSPI-5 is a brief unidimensional instrument and 
its scores demonstrated good reliability and validity for assessing 
suicide-related behaviors due to experiencing a trauma in undergraduate samples.

BACKGROUND: Patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) on hemodialysis have 
limited life expectancy, yet their palliative care needs often go unmet. The aim 
of this study was to identify barriers and facilitators for implementation of 
"Shared Decision Making and Renal Supportive Care" (SDM-RSC), an intervention to 
improve advance care planning (ACP) for patients with ESKD on hemodialysis.
METHODS: The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) was the 
organizing framework for this study. CFIR is a theory-based implementation 
framework consisting of five domains (Intervention Characteristics, Inner 
Setting, Outer Setting, Characteristics of Individuals, and Process), each of 
which has associated constructs. Potential barriers and facilitators to 
implementation of the SDM-RSC intervention were identified through observation 
of study procedures, surveys of social workers nephrologists, study 
participants, and family members, and assessment of intervention fidelity.
RESULTS: Twenty-nine nephrologists and 24 social workers, representing 18 
outpatient dialysis units in Massachusetts (n = 10) and New Mexico (n = 8), were 
trained to conduct SDM-RSC intervention sessions. A total of 102 of 125 patient 
enrolled in the study received the intervention; 40 had family members present. 
Potential barriers and facilitators to implementation of the SDM-RSC 
intervention were identified in each of the five CFIR domains. Barriers included 
complexity of the intervention; challenges to meeting with patients on 
non-dialysis days; difficulties scheduling intervention sessions due to 
nephrologists' and social workers' caseloads; perceived need for local policy 
change regarding ACP; perceived need for additional ACP training for social 
workers and nephrologists; and lack of endorsement of the intervention by some 
staff members. Facilitators included: training for social workers, national 
dialysis chain leadership engagement and the institution of social 
worker/nephrologist clinic champions.
CONCLUSIONS: ACP for patients on hemodialysis can have a positive impact on 
end-of-life outcomes for patients and their families but does not take place 
routinely. The barriers to effective implementation of interventions to improve 
ACP identified in this study might be addressed by: adapting the intervention 
for local contexts with input from clinicians, dialysis staff, patients and 
families; providing nephrologists and social workers additional training prior 
to delivering the intervention; and developing policy that routinizes ACP for 
hemodialysis patients.

Statins in the Prevention and Treatment of Heart Failure: a Review of the 
Evidence.

Glasgow, Scotland.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: We summarize the best evidence for statins in the prevention 
and treatment of heart failure.
RECENT FINDINGS: In patients with cardiovascular risk factors or established 
atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (but without heart failure), statins 
reduce the risk of incident heart failure-mainly by preventing myocardial 
infarction although an additional benefit from reducing myocardial ischemia 
cannot be excluded. However, in patients with established heart failure, statins 
do not reduce the risk of cardiovascular death, which is mainly caused by pump 
failure and ventricular arrhythmias. Retrospective analyses, however, suggest 
that statins may reduce the rate of heart failure hospitalization and 
atherosclerotic events (which are proportionately much less common in these 
patients than heart failure hospitalization or death). Statin therapy should 
probably be continued in patients with coronary artery disease developing heart 
failure, although the weak evidence and small benefit may not justify the use of 
this treatment in very elderly patients with a short life expectancy and in 
which polypharmacy is a problem.

INTRODUCTION: Complex underlying risk functions associated with immuno-oncology 
treatments have led to exploration of different methods (parametric survival, 
spline, landmark, and cure-fraction models) to estimate long-term survival 
outcomes. The objective of this study was to examine differences in estimated 
short- and long-term survival in previously treated metastatic Merkel cell 
carcinoma (mMCC) patients receiving avelumab, when using alternative 
extrapolation approaches.
METHODS: Efficacy data from the phase 2 JAVELIN Merkel 200 trial (part A) with 
at least 12 months of follow-up were analyzed. Standard parametric survival 
analyses and analyses of overall survival (OS) as a function of surrogate 
outcomes comprised of response (landmark analyses) and progression-free survival 
plus post-progression survival (PFS + PPS) were used to project OS. Overall 
survival throughout lifetime was projected and compared with the observed OS 
data with at least 24 months of follow-up.
RESULTS: Estimated OS from all three approaches provided a good fit to the 
observed OS curve from at least 12 months of follow-up. However, performance 
compared with OS data from at least 24 months showed that the landmark approach 
followed by PFS + PPS provided a better fit to the data as compared to standard 
parametric analysis. Mean life expectancy estimated with avelumab was 2.48 years 
with best-fitting parametric function (a log-normal distribution), 3.15 years 
with the landmark approach, and 3.54 years with PFS + PPS.
CONCLUSION: Although standard parametric survival analysis may provide a good 
fit to short-term survival, it appears to underestimate the long-term survival 
benefits associated with avelumab in mMCC. Extrapolations based on surrogate 
outcomes of response or progression predict OS outcomes from longer follow-up 
better and appear to provide more clinically plausible projections.

Positive and negative expectancies drive behavioral and neurobiological placebo 
and nocebo effects, which in turn can have profound effects on patient 
improvement or worsening. However, expectations of events and outcomes are often 
not met in daily life and clinical practice. It is currently unknown how this 
affects placebo and nocebo effects. We have demonstrated that the violation of 
expectancies, such as when there is a discrepancy between what is expected and 
what is actually presented, reduces both placebo and nocebo effects while 
causing an extinction of placebo effects. The reduction of placebo and nocebo 
effects was paralleled by an activation of the left inferior parietal cortex, a 
brain region that redirects attention when discrepancies between sensory and 
cognitive events occur. Our findings highlight the importance of expectancy 
violation in shaping placebo and nocebo effects and open up new avenues for 
managing positive and negative expectations in clinical trials and practices.

OBJECTIVE: One-half of the 14 million persons in the US with knee osteoarthritis 
(OA) are not physically active, despite evidence that physical activity (PA) is 
associated with improved health. We undertook this study to estimate both the 
quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) losses in a US population with knee OA due to 
physical inactivity and the health benefits associated with higher PA levels.
METHODS: We used data from the Osteoarthritis Initiative and the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention to estimate the proportions of a US population 
with knee OA ages ≥45 years that are inactive, insufficiently active, and 
active, and the likelihood of a shift in their PA level. We used the OA Policy 
Model, a computer simulation of knee OA, to determine QALYs lost due to 
inactivity and to measure potential benefits of increased PA (comorbidities 
averted and QALYs saved).
RESULTS: Among 13.7 million persons with knee OA, a total of 7.5 million QALYs, 
or 0.55 QALYs per person, were lost due to inactivity or insufficient PA 
relative to activity over their remaining lifetimes. Black Hispanic women 
experienced the highest losses, at 0.76 QALYs per person. Women of all 
races/ethnicities had ~20% higher loss burdens than men. According to our model, 
if 20% of the inactive population were instead active, 95,920 cases of cancer, 
222,413 of cardiovascular disease, and 214,725 of diabetes mellitus would 
potentially be averted, and 871,541 potential QALYs would be saved.
CONCLUSION: Physical inactivity leads to substantial QALY losses in a US 
population with knee OA. Increases in the activity levels in even a fraction of 
this population may have considerable collateral health benefits, potentially 
averting cases of cancer, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes mellitus.

LDP was calculated by a probability additive formula and based on an abridged 
life table. Data on age-specific mortality was obtained from the National 
Cause-of- Death Surveillance Dataset in 2014 using surveillance sites in China 
and data on age-specific mortality was collected from the third retrospective 
investigation of death cause in China in 2004. Results: LDP caused by malignant 
tumors, lung cancer, gastric cancer, liver cancer, esophageal cancer, 
colorectal, and anal cancer were 19.2%, 5.6%, 2.8%, 2.8%, 1.7%, 1.3%, 
respectively. In addition, we calculated LDP caused by malignant tumors in three 
different regions of China. LDP caused by malignant tumors were 21.2%, 6.1%, 
3.1%, 2.8%, 2.0%, and 1.5% in the eastern region, were 18.3%, 5.5%, 2.7%, 3.0%, 
1.5%, and 1.1% in the central region, and were 16.7%, 4.6%, 2.3%, 2.8%, 1.6%, 
and 1.2% in the western region, respectively. Additionally, LDP caused by 
malignant tumors in 2004 and 2015 were compared. We found that LDPs caused by 
malignant tumors, lung cancer, and colorectal cancer have increased in the past 
decade, while LDPs caused by gastric cancer, liver cancer, and esophageal cancer 
have experienced a decreasing trend. Conclusions: Malignant tumors were still 
the main cause of death in one’s life time, giving rise to LDP. LDP caused by 
malignant tumours has two divisions. First, traditional upper digestive system 
cancers related to long-term chronic infection, such as esophageal cancer, 
gastric cancer, and liver cancer, which has shown a significant downward trend. 
Second, lung and colorectal cancers related to the environmental factors and 
lifestyle, which are on the rise.

Introduction: The determination of tumour extent is a major challenging task in 
brain tumour planning and quantitative evaluation. Magnetic Resonance Imaging 
(MRI) is one of the non-invasive technique has emanated as a front- line 
diagnostic tool for brain tumour without ionizing radiation. Objective: Among 
brain tumours, gliomas are the most common aggressive, leading to a very short 
life expectancy in their highest grade. In the clinical practice manual 
segmentation is a time consuming task and their performance is highly depended 
on the operator’s experience. Methods: This paper proposes fully automatic 
segmentation of brain tumour using convolutional neural network. Further, it 
uses high grade gilomas brain image from BRATS 2015 database. The suggested work 
accomplishes brain tumour segmentation using tensor flow, in which the anaconda 
frameworks are used to implement high level mathematical functions. The survival 
rates of patients are improved by early diagnosis of brain tumour. Results: 
Hence, the research work segments brain tumour into four classes like edema, 
non-enhancing tumour, enhancing tumour and necrotic tumour. Brain tumour 
segmentation needs to separate healthy tissues from tumour regions such as 
advancing tumour, necrotic core and surrounding edema. This is an essential step 
in diagnosis and treatment planning, both of which need to take place quickly in 
case of a malignancy in order to maximize the likelihood of successful 
treatment.

The increase in life expectancy has resulted in a greater number of patients 
presenting for cataract surgery as well as an increasing prevalence of dry eye 
disease (DED) symptoms or signs noted in these patients. Low grade and/or 
non-symptomatic DED is common and can be exacerbated after surgery. DED can 
induce errors in IOL power calculation. DED can impair the visual prognosis and 
patient comfort after cataract surgery, leading to dissatisfaction of both the 
patient and the surgeon. Hence, preoperative evaluation for DED for all cataract 
candidates is crucial to mitigate these risks. To optimize clinical efficiency 
during the screening examination, we propose a strategy of three levels of DED 
screening, according to a patient's risk of DED given his or her history. We 
also propose a summary of the main clinical points before, during and after 
cataract surgery in eyes with DED.

BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Diabetes mellitus has become a major cause of death 
worldwide. Many technologies have become available for managing diabetes and its 
complications. This study investigated the mortality trends in people with 
diabetes in Taiwan between 2005 and 2014.
METHODS: We used data from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database, 
which is linked to the National Death Registry. Patients with at least three 
outpatient visits in 1 year or at least one hospital admission with the 
diagnosis of diabetes (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, 
Clinical Modification [ICD-9-CM] 250.x) were defined as diabetic patients. The 
main causes of death were classified using ICD-9-CM or ICD-10-CM.
RESULTS: In 2005-2014, the number of diabetic patients increased from 1.3 to 2.2 
million in Taiwan, and all-cause mortality in the patients decreased 
continuously across sexes and age groups (all, 3.45%-3.00%; women, 3.07%-2.70%; 
men, 3.82%-3.28%, all p < 0.001 for trends). The diabetic patients exhibited a 
shorter life expectancy than the entire population. The differences decreased 
from 2005 to 2014 (p < 0.001) and were greater when diabetes was diagnosed early 
in life. In 2014, the estimated loss of life was 2.6 and 3.2 years in the women 
and men, respectively, when diabetes was diagnosed at 40 years of age. The top 
five causes of death in diabetic patients were malignancy, diabetes, heart 
diseases, cerebrovascular diseases, and pneumonia.
CONCLUSION: The mortality and estimated loss of life of diabetic patients 
decreased significantly from 2005 to 2014, reflecting advancements in diabetes 
care in Taiwan.

PURPOSE: Limited published data exist on the clinical epidemiology of atrial 
fibrillation (AF) in South Asia including India. Most of the published data are 
from the Western countries and the Far East. The Kerala AF registry was 
initiated to collect systematic, prospective data on clinical characteristics, 
risk factors, treatment pattern and outcomes of consecutive AF patients who 
consulted cardiologists across the state of Kerala, India.
PARTICIPANTS: All newly diagnosed and previously reported patients aged ≥18 
years with documented evidence of AF on ECG were included. Patients with 
transient AF due to infection, acute myocardial infarction, alcohol 
intoxication, metabolic abnormalities and AF seen in postoperative cases and 
critically ill patients with life expectancy less than 30 days were excluded.
FINDINGS TO DATE: A total of 3421 patients were recruited from 53 hospitals 
across Kerala from April 2016 to April 2017. There were 51% (n=1744) women. The 
median age of the cohort was 65 (IQR 56-74) years. Hypertension, diabetes 
mellitus and dyslipidaemia were present in 53.8%, 34.5% and 42.2% patients, 
respectively. Chronic kidney disease was observed in 46.6%, coronary artery 
disease in 34.8% and heart failure (HF) in 26.5% of patients. Mean CHA2DS2-VASc 
score of the cohort was 2.9, and HAS-BLED score was 1.7. Detailed information of 
antithrombotic and antiarrhythmic drugs was collected at baseline and on 
follow-up. During 1-year follow-up, 443 deaths (12.9%) occurred of which 332 
(9.7%) were cardiac death and 63 (1.8%) were due to stroke. There were 578 
(16.8%) hospitalisations mainly due to acute coronary syndrome, arrythmias and 
HF.
FUTURE PLANS: Currently, this is the largest prospective study on AF patients 
from India, and the cohort will be followed for 5 years to observe the treatment 
patterns and clinical outcomes. The investigators encourage collaborations with 
national and international AF researchers.

BACKGROUND/AIMS: Metabolic syndrome (MetS) comprises a cluster of physiological 
and anthropometric abnormalities. MetS has been linked to lactose intolerance 
(LI). The aim of this study was to compare the sensitivity and specificity to 
detect LI using 2 different tests: (1) a genetic test and (2) an oral lactose 
tolerance test (OLTT).
METHODS: Two hundred and fifty-four MetS patients, ≥20 years of age, of both 
genders, were recruited for this comparative study. Nine single nucleotide 
polymorphisms (SNPs) were selected for genetic investigation: rs182549and 
rs4988235(both considered "gold standard"); rs56064699; rs148142676; 
rs562211644; rs59533246; rs3754689; rs2278544,and rs10552864(as potential novel 
SNPs). Sensitivity and specificity, as well as positive and negative predictive 
values, were calculated for each genotype using WINPEPI version 11.65. 
Differences between positive and negative OLTT groups were considered 
statistically significant when p ≤ 0.05.
RESULTS: Among the selected SNPs, only rs182549(p < 0.001) and rs4988235(p < 
0.001) gave similar results compared to an OLTT. The sensitivity of both SNPs to 
detect LI was 87 and 86%, and specificity was 83 and 82.5%, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Genetic tests using rs182549and rs4988235SNPs showed high agreement 
with OLTT. These genetic tests may be a good option to replace OLTT in MetS 
patients.

PURPOSE: Robot-assisted total knee arthroplasty (rTKA) remains in its infancy, 
is expensive but offers the promise of improved kinematic performance through 
precise bone cuts, with minimal soft tissue disruption, based on pre-resection 
soft tissue behaviour. This cadaveric study examined load transfer, soft tissue 
performance and radiographic indices for conventional (sTKA) versus rTKA. The 
null hypothesis was there would be no difference between the two modes of 
implantation.
METHODS: Whole (ten) cadaveric limbs were randomised to receive either robotic 
(rTKA, N = 5) or conventional measured resection (sTKA, N = 5) knee 
arthroplasty. Laxity patterns were established using validated fixed sensors 
(Verasense) with manual maximum displacement for six degrees of freedom. 
Tibiofemoral load and contact points were determined dynamically using remote 
sensor technology for medial and lateral compartments through a functional arc 
of motion (0-110 degrees of motion). Final component position was assessed using 
pre- and post-implantation CT.
RESULTS: No significant intergroup differences for laxity were found (n.s.). The 
rTKA group exhibited consistently balanced mediolateral load throughout the full 
arc with significantly reduced overall total load across the joint (for distinct 
points of measurement, p < 0.05). Despite using flexion-extension and 
mediolateral gap balancing with measured resection, the sTKA group failed to 
achieve balance in at least three points of the flexion arc. Post-operative CT 
confirmed satisfactory component alignment with no significant differences for 
positioning between the two groups.
CONCLUSION: This work found improved load sharing for rTKA when compared to 
conventional surgery for same donor knees. Laxity and CT determined final 
component positioning was not significantly different. The work supports the 
contention that robot-assisted TKA delivers improved tibiofemoral load sharing 
in time zero studies under defined conditions but such offers the promise of 
improved clinical performance and reduced implant wear.

Complete genome sequences of two cycas necrotic stunt virus (CNSV) isolates from 
Paeonia suffruticosa and Daphne odora were determined. Phylogenetic trees and 
pairwise comparisons using complete RNA1- and RNA2-encoded polyproteins showed 
that the two CNSV isolates are divergent (83.19%-89.42% in polyprotein 1 and 
73.61%-85.78% in polyprotein 2). A comparative analysis based on taxonomic 
criteria for the species demarcation of nepoviruses confirmed that they are not 
new species but distinct variants. This is the first report of the complete 
genome sequences of CNSV detected in P. suffruticosa and D. odora, and the first 
report of CNSV infecting P. suffruticosa.

Several pharmacological, dietary, and genetic interventions that increase 
mammalian lifespan are known, but general principles of lifespan 
extension remain unclear. Here, we performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analyses 
of mice subjected to 8 longevity interventions. We discovered a feminizing 
effect associated with growth hormone regulation and diminution of sex-related 
differences. Expanding this analysis to 17 interventions with public data, we 
observed that many interventions induced similar gene expression changes. We 
identified hepatic gene signatures associated with lifespan extension across 
interventions, including upregulation of oxidative phosphorylation and drug 
metabolism, and showed that perturbed pathways may be shared across tissues. We 
further applied the discovered longevity signatures to identify new 
lifespan-extending candidates, such as chronic hypoxia, KU-0063794, and 
ascorbyl-palmitate. Finally, we developed GENtervention, an app that visualizes 
associations between gene expression changes and longevity. Overall, this study 
describes general and specific transcriptomic programs of lifespan extension in 
mice and provides tools to discover new interventions.
