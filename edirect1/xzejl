in 7 patients further evaluated hip and knee function.
RESULTS: Eleven male patients and 15 female patients, including 13 children 
(mean age 10 years, range 5-16) and 13 adults (mean age 36 years, range 23-63) 
were evaluated. Better prosthetic function and PedsQL scores were recorded in 
the pediatric group. There was a trend for better scores after surgery. Gait 
analysis demonstrated reduced hip extension compensated by knee flexion in 3 
patients, 2 patients had hip extension with near normal kinematics, 1 untreated 
patient walked with an unsteady gait, and the remaining walked well using an 
ischial-bearing prosthesis with pelvic compensatory movements.
CONCLUSION: The management strategy in severe proximal femoral focal deficiency 
remains a major challenge. Hip reconstruction seems to improve functional 
scores. Overall, the scores seem to decline into adulthood but not 
significantly. Gait analysis before further surgical intervention is recommended 
because compensatory knee flexion may improve step length in terminal stance. 
Limited numbers, with short follow-up, prevents clear guidance on the benefit of 
surgery.

Individuals with untreated isolated GH deficiency (IGHD) due to a mutation in 
the GHRH receptor gene from Itabaianinha Brazil have increased insulin 
sensitivity, normal life expectancy, and an extended healthspan, i.e., the 
period of life free from disabilities. We hypothesize that their prolonged 
healthspan is accompanied by a delayed cognitive decline in senescence. To test 
this hypothesis, we have administered the Literacy Independent Cognitive 
Assessment (LICA) to 15 IGHD individuals aged over 50 years and 15 controls 
matched by age, sex, years of education, and percentage of illiteracy. All 
individuals were negative for HIV and syphilis serology, and there were no 
differences in serum levels of folate, vitamin B12 and TSH between the 2 groups, 
while free T4 was higher in the IGHD group. IGHD subjects had a higher total 
LICA score than controls, 215 (22.7) vs. 204.2 (18.1), without reaching 
statistical significance. Scores of memory, visuoconstruction, language and 
calculation were similar between the two groups, with better attention [9.5 
(1.4) vs. 8.3 (1.1), p= 0.01], and executive function [38.3 (4.8) vs. 35.1 
(2.5), p= 0.03] scores in IGHD. MANCOVA revealed that group (but no age) had a 
significant effect on the LICA variables (partial eta squared of 0.455, power of 
0.812, p= 0.02). This effect is verified on attention (partial eta squared 
0.216, power of 0.749, p= 0.01) and executive function (partial eta squared 
0.154, power of 0.570, p= 0.03. In conclusion, IGHD in senescence is associated 
with similar total cognitive performance, but better attention and executive 
function than controls.

PURPOSE: This study aimed to estimate the lifetime healthcare costs and loss of 
life expectancy (loss-of-LE) among patients with incident rheumatoid arthritis 
(RA) with and without depression.
METHODS: This 18 years longitudinal cohort study used data from Taiwan's 
National Health Insurance Research Database. In total, 43,311 patients with RA 
were included. Among them, 1,663 patients had depressive disorders in the year 
preceding the RA diagnosis. The survival function for patients with RA with or 
without depression was estimated and extrapolated over a lifetime using the 
rolling extrapolation algorithm. The loss-of-LE was calculated by comparing the 
sex, age, and calendar year-matched referents from vital statistics. The average 
monthly cost was calculated as the sum of the monthly costs for all patients 
divided by the number of surviving patients. Lifetime healthcare costs were 
estimated by multiplying the monthly average cost by the monthly survival 
probability.
RESULTS: The loss-of-LE for RA patients with and without depression was 
5.60 years and 4.76 years, respectively. The lifetime costs of RA patients with 
and without depression were USD$ 90,346 and USD$ 92,239, respectively. However, 
the annual healthcare costs were USD$ 4,123 for RA patients with depression and 
USD$ 3,812 for RA patients without depression. Regardless of sex or age, RA 
patients with depression had higher annual healthcare costs than those without 
depression.
CONCLUSION: Patients with RA and depression have a high loss-of-LE and high 
annual healthcare costs. Whether treating depression prolongs life expectancy 
and reduces healthcare costs warrants further investigation.

INTRODUCTION: The relevance of rehabilitation in progressive neurological 
disorders, such as Friedreich's Ataxia (FRDA), has yet to be convincingly 
proven. FRDA is characterized by ataxia, loss of gait, scoliosis, 
cardiomyopathy, dysarthria and dysphagia, with reduced life expectancy. The 
disease onset is usually in adolescence, leading to progressive disability. 
Omaveloxolone has been recently approved as the first pharmacological treatment 
for FRDA in adults and adolescents aged 16 years and older. Regarding 
non-pharmacological therapies, neurorehabilitation is a valuable aid in 
addressing the symptoms and in maintaining the residual functioning. We 
performed a prospective observational cohort study to evaluate the efficacy of 
inpatient rehabilitation (IR) for people with FRDA.
METHODS: A total of 42 individuals (29 adults and 13 children) with FRDA were 
recruited. There were 27 ambulant and 15 non-ambulant participants. The patients 
underwent IR of 3 and 4 weeks in children and adults, respectively. The IR 
treatment was designed to be applied within a multidisciplinary setting, so FRDA 
patients underwent, in addition to physiotherapy, also occupational therapy, 
practical manual activities and psychological support aiming to enhance 
transferable skills useful in the activities of daily living. The primary 
outcome was the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA). Other 
measures were: Friedreich Ataxia Rating Scale (FARS) and Nine Hole Peg Test 
(NHPT). Furthermore, we used the 6 Minute Walk Test (6MWT), the Timed Up and Go 
(TUG) and the Berg Balance Scale (BBS) only on ambulant subjects. Outcomes were 
evaluated at baseline and at the end of the treatment.
RESULTS: We report that the IR significantly improves motor performance and 
ataxia symptoms in patients with FRDA. Our study shows significant functional 
improvement in all the outcome measures used, except for NHPT bilaterally. FARS 
and SARA scores post-IR are significatively reduced when compared (p < 0.001).
DISCUSSION: We demonstrate that IR programs in FRDA can provide a meaningful 
clinical improvement in terms of outcome measures. These findings could be 
useful when approaching progressive neurological disorders.

The retina, as an external extension of the diencephalon, can be directly, 
noninvasively observed by ocular fundus photography. Therefore, it offers a 
convenient and feasible mode to study nervous system diseases. Caliber, 
tortuosity, and fractal dimension, as three commonly used retinal vascular 
parameters, are not only the reflection of structural changes in the retinal 
microcirculation but also capture the branching pattern or density changes of 
the retinal microvascular network. Therefore, it contributes to better 
reflecting the subclinical pathological changes (e.g., lacunar stroke and small 
cerebral vascular disease) and predicting the risk of incident stroke and 
recurrent stroke.

Craniopharyngiomas are tumors originating from the infundibular stalk, extending 
to the parasellar and suprasellar region, thereby conferring multiple risks of 
this region. In particular, hypothalamic and pituitary damage related to its 
natural history as well as treatment effects of craniopharyngiomas substantially 
affect life expectancy and quality of life. Here, we describe an adult patient 
presenting with polyuria, memory, and visual field impairment secondary to 
concurrent craniopharyngioma and intraventricular glioma. He was treated with 
surgical resection with postoperative course notable for hypothalamic-pituitary 
dysfunction, including central hypothyroidism, central adrenal insufficiency, 
arginine vasopressin deficiency (AVP-D, formerly diabetes insipidus) with loss 
of sense of thirst, and hypothalamic hypothermia. The adipsia, combined with 
memory dysfunction, challenged the management of constant fluctuations in his 
sodium (129-168 mEq/L), with ultimate treatment through vasopressin repletion, 
fixed fluid intake, strict urine output monitoring, and close counseling of the 
patient and his caregiver. This case exemplifies the complexity of the endocrine 
care of patients with craniopharyngiomas and highlights the need for step-wise 
algorithms in the treatment of hypothalamic deficiencies such as adipsia.

University, Nablus, PSE.

Background Cervicogenic headaches can significantly deteriorate the quality of 
life of patients and decrease their productivity. Few studies have been 
conducted to assess the magnitude of physical impairments among patients with 
non-traumatic and post-traumatic cervicogenic headaches. Therefore, this study 
was conducted to examine and compare the magnitude of cervical physical 
impairments among patients with post-traumatic cervicogenic headaches in 
contrast to patients with non-traumatic cervicogenic headaches, migraine, and a 
group of sex- and age-matched controls who did not have headaches. Methodology 
This was a comparative study. A total of 104 patients and 30 sex- and 
age-matched controls were included. The patients were stratified into three 
groups: post-traumatic cervicogenic headaches (n = 42), non-traumatic 
cervicogenic headaches (n = 30), and migraines (n = 32). The cervical active 
range of motion and proprioception were assessed using a goniometer, the 
craniovertebral angle was measured while the heads of the subjects rested in a 
comfortable position, the strength of the cervical flexors and extensors was 
assessed using a hand-held dynamometer, and endurance of the short cervical 
flexors was assessed while the subjects were in a supine position with no 
pillow. Skin roll tests were performed in the trapezius and mandibular areas, 
and pain was measured using the McGill Pain Questionnaire-Short Form. Results 
Patients in the post-traumatic cervicogenic headache group reported a 
significantly higher number of headache days (p < 0.001) compared to the 
controls, patients with migraines, and those with non-traumatic cervicogenic 
headaches. Patients with post-traumatic cervicogenic headaches showed a 
significant reduction in total rotation, flexion and extension, lateral bending, 
and craniovertebral angle compared to the controls, patients with migraines, and 
those with non-traumatic cervicogenic headaches. On the other hand, the controls 
endured significantly longer and had stronger neck flexors and extensors 
compared to the patients in the migraine, non-traumatic, and post-traumatic 
cervicogenic headache groups, respectively. Patients with post-traumatic 
cervicogenic headaches significantly reported higher affective and total pain 
compared to the controls and patients in the migraine group. Conclusions 
Patients with post-traumatic cervicogenic headaches had significant deficits in 
the cervical active range of motion in the different planes, endurance, and 
strength of cervical flexors and extensors compared to the controls and patients 
with migraine and non-traumatic cervicogenic headaches. Similarly, patients with 
post-traumatic cervicogenic headaches reported higher affective pain compared to 
the controls and patients with migraines. The results of this study indicated 
that patients with post-traumatic cervicogenic headaches have significantly 
higher physical impairments compared to patients with non-traumatic cervicogenic 
headaches. These differences warrant caution when combining data from patients 
with non-traumatic and post-traumatic cervicogenic headaches.

Late presentations of liver failure were previously rare in clinical practice 
given the high mortality of sickle cell disease (SCD) and shorter life 
expectancy compared to the general population. With advancements in therapeutics 
for SCD, patients with SCD have increased lifespans, and with them, patients are 
placed at increased risk for differing patterns of chronic and end-organ 
failures. We describe a case of an elderly patient who had multiple chronic 
complications from her years of SCD, including end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on 
hemodialysis, acquired hemochromatosis, cirrhosis, and pulmonary hypertension. 
During this presentation for shortness of breath, she developed acute-on-chronic 
liver failure (ACLF) with a significant lower gastrointestinal bleed and 
hemorrhagic shock. Her family ultimately elected to pursue comfort care 
measures, and she passed later that day.

The impact of aging and oxidative stress in metabolic and nervous system 
disorders: programmed cell death and molecular signal transduction crosstalk.

Maiese K(1).

Author information:
(1)Innovation and Commercialization, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, 
MD, United States.

Life expectancy is increasing throughout the world and coincides with a rise in 
non-communicable diseases (NCDs), especially for metabolic disease that includes 
diabetes mellitus (DM) and neurodegenerative disorders. The debilitating effects 
of metabolic disorders influence the entire body and significantly affect the 
nervous system impacting greater than one billion people with disability in the 
peripheral nervous system as well as with cognitive loss, now the seventh 
leading cause of death worldwide. Metabolic disorders, such as DM, and 
neurologic disease remain a significant challenge for the treatment and care of 
individuals since present therapies may limit symptoms but do not halt overall 
disease progression. These clinical challenges to address the interplay between 
metabolic and neurodegenerative disorders warrant innovative strategies that can 
focus upon the underlying mechanisms of aging-related disorders, oxidative 
stress, cell senescence, and cell death. Programmed cell death pathways that 
involve autophagy, apoptosis, ferroptosis, and pyroptosis can play a critical 
role in metabolic and neurodegenerative disorders and oversee processes that 
include insulin resistance, β-cell function, mitochondrial integrity, reactive 
oxygen species release, and inflammatory cell activation. The silent mating type 
information regulation 2 homolog 1 (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) (SIRT1), AMP 
activated protein kinase (AMPK), and Wnt1 inducible signaling pathway protein 1 
(WISP1) are novel targets that can oversee programmed cell death pathways tied 
to β-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), nicotinamide, apolipoprotein E 
(APOE), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) exposure with coronavirus 
disease 2019 (COVID-19), and trophic factors, such as erythropoietin (EPO). The 
pathways of programmed cell death, SIRT1, AMPK, and WISP1 offer exciting 
prospects for maintaining metabolic homeostasis and nervous system function that 
can be compromised during aging-related disorders and lead to cognitive 
impairment, but these pathways have dual roles in determining the ultimate fate 
of cells and organ systems that warrant thoughtful insight into complex 
autofeedback mechanisms.

PURPOSE: Despite the development of anti-human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines, 
cervical cancer is still a common disease in women, especially in developing 
countries. The presence of a hypoxic microenvironment causes traditional 
treatments to fail. In this study, we presented a combined treatment method 
based on the chemotherapeutic agent cisplatin and Clostridium novyi-NT spores to 
treat normoxic and hypoxic areas of the tumor.
METHODS: TC-1 Cell line capable of expressing HPV-16 E6/7 oncoproteins was 
subcutaneously transplanted into female 6-8 week old C57/BL6 mice. The 
tumor-bearing mice were randomly divided into four groups and treated with 
different methods after selecting a control group. Group 1: Control without 
treatment (0.1 mL sterile PBS intratumorally), Group: C. novyi-NT (107 C. 
novyi-NT). Group 3: Receives cisplatin intraperitoneally (10 mg/kg). Fourth 
group: Intratumoral administration of C. novyi-NT spores + intraperitoneal 
cisplatin. Western blot analysis was used to examine the effects of anti-hypoxia 
treatment and expression of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) and vascular 
endothelial growth factor (VEGF) proteins.
RESULTS: The results clearly showed that combined treatment based on C. novyi-NT 
and cisplatin significantly reduced the expression of HIF-1 alpha and VEGF 
proteins compared to cisplatin alone. At the same time, the amount of necrosis 
of tumor cells in the combined treatment increased significantly compared to the 
single treatment and the control. At the same time, the mitotic count decreased 
significantly.
CONCLUSION: Our research showed that developing a combined treatment method 
based on C. novyi-NT and cisplatin against HPV-positive cervical cancer could 
overcome the treatment limitations caused by the existence of hypoxic areas of 
the tumor.

INTRODUCTION: Divorce rates among individuals aged 50 and above are on the rise. 
Given the greater life expectancy compared to previous generations, this is an 
issue that is affecting an increasing number of people. Therefore, it warrants 
an inquiry into the challenges these individuals encounter in their intimate 
relationships.
METHODS: This study analyzed 225 relationship-related queries posted on Czech 
counselling websites to identify the strains and stressor patterns that older 
adults face in their relationships. The queries were limited to those that 
concerned themes and problems related to partnerships, were posted by one of the 
partners aged 60 or over, and were analyzed using inductive thematic analysis.
RESULTS: Four main relationship issues were identified: infidelity and jealousy; 
relationship estrangement and cooling; undesirable changes in personality; and 
illness and somatic issues. Additionally, three recurring themes were identified 
that made the problems more demanding and that were specific to older age: lack 
of norms for relationships in that age group, absence of resources to tackle the 
issues, and personal calculation for Time Spent and Time Remaining.
DISCUSSION: The research found that the types of problems encountered by older 
adults were similar to those experienced by younger individuals. However, the 
way these problems were perceived and processed was influenced by specific 
aspects of aging, such as societal expectations, available coping resources, and 
the perception of time. The findings also highlighted the challenges faced by 
older adults in terms of relationship norms, sexual functioning, and personality 
changes.

INTRODUCTION: Though hip fractures are associated with significant mortality and 
morbidity, increasing life expectancy in developed countries necessitates an 
analysis of mortality trends and factors predicting long term survival. The aim 
of this study is to identify the predictors of 10-year mortality as well as 
assess the correlation of Age-adjusted Charlson comorbidity index (ACCI) with 
10-year mortality in a surgically treated Asian geriatric hip fracture 
population.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: From January 1, 2007 to December 31, 2009, 766 patients 
who underwent surgery for hip fracture with a minimum follow up of 10-years were 
recruited to the study (92% follow-up rate). A review of the patient's 
electronic hospital records was performed to glean the following data: patient 
demographics, pre-existing comorbidities, operation duration, length of stay, 
fracture configuration, as well as mortality data up to 10 years. CCI scores and 
individual co-morbidities were correlated with inpatient, 30-day, 1-year, 5-year 
and beyond 10-year mortality.
RESULTS: Of the 766 patients, the mortality rate for 30-day, 1-year, 5-year and 
10-years was 2.9%, 12.0%, 38.9% and 61.6% respectively. The average ACCI was 
5.31. The 10-year mortality for patients with ACCI ≤ 3, ACCI 4-5 and ACCI ≥ 6 
are 29.4%, 57.4% and 77.5% respectively. End-Stage-Renal Failure (ESRF), liver 
failure and COPD were dominant predictors of mortality at 10 years, whereas 
cancer was the predominant predictor at 1 year.
DISCUSSION: ACCI significantly correlates with the 10-year mortality after 
surgically treated hip fractures with a shift of the dominant predictors from 
cancer to ESRF and COPD. This could inform future health policy and resource 
planning. This data also represents recently available pre-pandemic survival 
trends after hip fracture surgery and serves as a baseline for post-pandemic 
outcome surveillance of interventions for fragility fractures.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that ACCI correlated with 10-year mortality 
after surgical treatment of hip fractures.

OBJECTIVES: Due to the increase in life expectancy and the aging of the global 
population, the "Belt and Road" ("B&R") countries are faced with varying degrees 
of lung cancer threat. The purpose of this study is to analyze the differences 
in the burden and trend of lung cancer disability in the "B&R" countries from 
1990 to 2019 so as to provide an analytical strategic basis to build a healthy 
"B&R".
METHODS: Data were derived from the Global Burden of Disease 2019 (GBD 2019). 
Incidence, mortality, prevalence, the years lived with disability (YLDs), and 
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) of lung cancer and those attributable to 
different risk factors were measured from 1990 to 2019. Trends of disease burden 
were estimated by using the average annual percent change (AAPC), and the 95% 
uncertainty interval (UI) was reported.
RESULTS: China, India, and the Russian Federation were the three countries with 
the highest burden of lung cancer in 2019. From 1990 to 2019, the AAPC of 
incidence, prevalence, mortality, and DALYs generally showed a downward trend in 
Central Asia (except Georgia) and Eastern Europe, while in China, South Asia 
(except Bangladesh), most countries in North Africa, and the Middle East, the 
trend was mainly upward. The AAPC of age-standardized incidence was 1.33% 
(1.15%-1.50%); the AAPC of prevalence, mortality, and DALYs from lung cancer in 
China increased by 24% (2.10%-2.38%), 0.94% (0.74%-1.14%), and 0.42% 
(0.25%-0.59%), respectively. A downward trend of the AAPC values of 
age-standardized YLD rate in men was shown in the vast majority of "B&R" 
countries, but for women, most countries had an upward trend. For adults aged 75 
years or older, the age-standardized YLD rate showed an increasing trend in most 
of the "B&R" countries. Except for the DALY rate of lung cancer attributable to 
metabolic risks, a downward trend of the DALY rate attributable to all risk 
factors, behavioral risks, and environmental/occupational risks was shown in the 
vast majority of "B&R" countries.
CONCLUSION: The burden of lung cancer in "B&R" countries varied significantly 
between regions, genders, and risk factors. Strengthening health cooperation 
among the "B&R" countries will help to jointly build a community with a shared 
future for mankind.

The concept of healthy life expectancy (HLE) integrates the ideas of life 
expectancy and health status, providing a valuable metric to evaluate both the 
length and quality of life. This paper seeks to aid policymakers in creating an 
inclusive HLE indicator system through a systematic review of methodologies for 
defining and measuring HLE, along with relevant published studies' descriptions. 
Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses 
extension for Scoping Reviews statement, two English language literature 
databases were researched from January 2020 to April 2023. Findings from 
empirical HLE-related studies were analyzed by extracting data on the study 
area, design, population, healthy state measurement tools, and results of 
studies using HLE indicators. The current analysis encompassed 48 empirical 
studies. Researchers discerned 11 unique HLE indicators within this corpus, each 
concentrating on a particular aspect. Furthermore, the analysis revealed 18 
diverse instruments for evaluating health statuses, each varying in its 
definition of a healthy state, dimensions of measurement, and the categories of 
data employed. Therefore, merging global health concepts, HLE indicators, 
methodologies for assessing healthy states, and applied research demonstrations 
are essential for a consolidated HLE indicator system creation.

The nutritional value of soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] for animals is 
influenced by soluble carbohydrates, such as sucrose and stachyose. Although 
sucrose is nutritionally desirable, stachyose is an antinutrient causing 
diarrhea and flatulence in non-ruminant animals. We conducted a genome-wide 
association study of 220 soybean accessions using 21,317 single nucleotide 
polymorphisms (SNPs) from the SoySNP50K iSelect Beadchip data to identify 
significant SNPs associated with sucrose and stachyose content. Seven 
significant SNPs were identified for sucrose content across chromosomes (Chrs.) 
2, 8, 12, 17, and 20, while thirteen significant SNPs were identified for 
stachyose content across Chrs. 2, 5, 8, 9, 10, 13, 14, and 15. Among those 
significant SNPs, three sucrose-related SNPs on Chrs. 8 and 17 were novel, while 
twelve stachyose-related SNPs on Chrs. 2, 5, 8, 9, 10, 13, 14, and 15 were 
novel. Based on Phytozome, STRING, and GO annotation, 17 and 24 candidate genes 
for sucrose and stachyose content, respectively, were highly associated with the 
carbohydrate metabolic pathway. Among these, the publicly available RNA-seq 
Atlas database highlighted four candidate genes associated with sucrose 
(Glyma.08g361200 and Glyma.17g258100) and stachyose (Glyma.05g025300 and 
Glyma.13g077900) content, which had higher gene expression levels in developing 
seed and multiple parts of the soybean plant. The results of this study will 
extend knowledge of the molecular mechanism and genetic basis underlying sucrose 
and stachyose content in soybean seed. Furthermore, the novel candidate genes 
and SNPs can be valuable genetic resources that soybean breeders may utilize to 
modify carbohydrate profiles for animal and human usage.

Amoebic liver abscess is one frequently encountered intra-abdominal infection, 
caused by Entamoeba histolytica and has various abdominal and thoracic 
life-threatening complications. Herein, describe a case of a 30-year-old female, 
who suffered from multiple amoebic liver abscesses and presented with massive 
right-sided pleural effusion. She was managed with recommended antibiotics and 
pigtail catheter for liver abscess and an intercostal drainage tube for massive 
pleural effusion. However, postintercostal drainage, her chest X-ray 
demonstrated a right mediastinal shadow, which was confirmed as an intrathoracic 
extension of the hepatic liver abscess on computed tomography. An 
ultrasound-guided pigtail catheter was manipulated and placed at the site of 
thoracic communication. This led to clinical and radiological improvement, but 
unfortunately, she developed ventilator-acquired pneumonia and died due to her 
illness. The case represents an uncommon complication of amoebic liver abscess, 
which is rarely described and adds more knowledge on the thoracic complexities 
of this infectious disease.

Objectives: The aging of the South African population could have profound 
implications for the independence and overall quality of life of older adults as 
life expectancy increases. While there is evidence that lifetime socio-economic 
status shapes risks for later function and disability, it is unclear whether, 
and how, the wealth of family members shapes these outcomes. We investigated the 
relationship between outcomes activities of daily living (ADL), grip strength, 
and gait speed, and the household wealth of non-coresident family members. 
Methods: Using data from Health and Aging in Africa: A Longitudinal Study of an 
INDEPTH Community in South Africa (HAALSI) and the Agincourt Health and 
Demographic Surveillance System (AHDSS), we examined the relationship between 
physical function and household and family wealth in the 13 preceding years. 
HAALSI is a cohort of 5,059 adults who were 40 years or older at baseline in 
2014. Using auto-g-computation-a recently proposed statistical approach to 
quantify causal effects in the context of a network of interconnected units-we 
estimated the effect of own and family wealth on the outcomes of interest. 
Results: We found no evidence of effects of family wealth on physical function 
and disability. Conclusion: Further research is needed to assess the effect of 
family wealth in early life on physical function and disability outcomes.

Sciences, Raipur, Chhattisgarh, India.

BACKGROUND: Leprosy reactions are the main pathway leading to severe nerve 
damage and disability. These reactions can occur at any time. The coronavirus 
disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic led to a catastrophic loss of human life and 
has had a devastating impact on persons affected by leprosy.
OBJECTIVE: To achieve deep insight into the subject of adverse reactions 
acquired after Covid vaccinations in persons affected by leprosy through a 
literature review.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A scoping review was conducted in the studies published 
between July 2021 and June 2022 using the Preferred Reporting Items for 
Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) 
checklist.
RESULTS: Using the search strategy, a total of 130 articles were found, of which 
five were relevant to the study. The adverse reactions were acquired mostly in 
males [9 (81.8%)]; the majority of them belong to borderline tuberculoid [4 
(36.4%)], and most of them were released from treatment (multi-drug therapy) [7 
(63.6%)].
CONCLUSION: Surveillance and management of adverse events following immunization 
(AEFI) are essential; even minor AEFI should be reported and documented in a 
line list.

INTRODUCTION: Osteochondroma is the most common primary benign tumor and 
developmental osseous anomaly resulting in exophytic overgrowth on the surface 
of bone lined by hyaline cartilage cap. In morphological view, they are sessile 
or pedunculated forms most commonly occurring in hip, scapula, humerus, and 
rarely, clavicle. X-ray, MRI angiogram are useful to know the bony, vascular 
pathology and histopathological investigation is the gold standard investigation 
to confirm the diagnosis.
CASE REPORT: A 30-year-old male patient presented to our department with pain 
and swelling over the right gluteal region followed by difficulty in walking in 
the past 3 months. On clinical and radiological examination, we observed the 
findings suggestive of osteochondroma, the patient was planned for excisional 
biopsy, and the material sent to histopathological examination which confirmed 
as osteochondroma.
CONCLUSION: Early diagnosis and excision of tumor prevent functional disability 
and malignant transformation and improve the life expectancy.
