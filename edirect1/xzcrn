BACKGROUND: Treatment-free remission in chronic myeloid leukaemia-ie, 
achievement of a sustained deep molecular response leading to discontinuation of 
BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy-has become a potential aim of 
therapy. Highly priced second-generation TKIs might offer deep molecular 
response status more quickly and for more patients than imatinib; however, with 
the availability and lower cost of generic imatinib, the value of 
second-generation TKIs as frontline therapy for this particular treatment 
endpoint remains unknown. We aimed to assess the potential value of 
second-generation TKIs used as frontline therapy in patients with chronic 
myeloid leukaemia in chronic phase in relation to the probability of achieving 
sustained deep molecular responses compared with generic imatinib, and the 
associated cost of each modality.
METHODS: We used a decision analytic model to consider the value of different 
TKI approaches from the payer's perspective. The proportion of patients 
achieving sustained deep molecular response after 5 years of treatment in 
chronic phase was estimated at 26% with imatinib and 44% with second-generation 
TKIs. We also modelled more favourable scenarios of the proportion of patients 
achieving such response with second-generation TKIs at 66%, 88%, and a 
near-perfect response of 99%. For each scenario, we examined the impact of the 
combination of health utilities for chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukaemia 
(base case 0·89, range 0-1) and the annual cost of second-generation TKIs (base 
case US$152 814 [ie, the price of nilotinib in the USA], range 0-240 000) on the 
cost-effectiveness of second-generation TKIs compared with generic imatinib. We 
used different price scenarios for generic imatinib in the USA (average price 
$35 000 per year; lowest price $4400 per year), Europe ($4000 per year), and 
developing countries ($2100 per year). We calculated incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) and assessed cost-effectiveness by considering 
two societal willingness-to-pay thresholds: $50 000 per quality-adjusted 
life-year (QALY) in all markets and $200 000 per QALY in the USA.
FINDINGS: In the base case, we obtained an ICER of $22 765 208, meaning that 
second-generation TKIs as frontline therapy to achieve sustained deep molecular 
response was not cost-effective under either of the societal willingness-to-pay 
thresholds. In our sensitivity analyses, none of the explored scenarios showed 
potential treatment value for use of second-generation TKIs at the current 
prices in the USA or at the price of $30 000-40 000 per year elsewhere. For 
example, considering a scenario in the USA using second-generation TKIs versus 
imatinib (annual price $4400 per year) with the potential benefit in favour of 
second-generation TKI (willingness to pay $200 000 per QALY, 66% of patients 
achieving sustained deep molecular response, and health utility of the chronic 
phase of 0·1), the cost of second-generation TKIs would need to be less than 
$25 000 per year to be a cost-effective option. Under the same conditions in 
developing nations, with a price of generic imatinib of $2100 per year and a 
willingness to pay of $50 000 per QALY, the annual price of second-generation 
TKIs should not exceed $10 000 per year of therapy.
INTERPRETATION: Considering the current prices of second-generation TKIs and of 
generic imatinib under different pricing scenarios in the USA, Europe, and 
developing countries, second-generation TKIs at current prices do not offer good 
value as frontline therapy in chronic myeloid leukaemia in order to achieve 
sustained deep molecular response and treatment-free remission.

The receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB (RANK) and the osteoprotegerin (OPG) 
cascade system have been reported to be essential in osteoclastogenesis. In 
recent years, several studies have investigated the association between 
polymorphisms of RANK, its ligand RANKL and OPG genes and the risk of rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA) in different populations. However, the results arising from these 
studies were conflicting. To determine the association between RANK, RANKL and 
OPG gene polymorphisms and the risk of RA. We conducted a hospital-based 
case-controlled study in Changzhou with 574 RA cases and 804 controls. The 
genotyping of RANK gene rs1805034 polymorphism was conducted by single base 
extension combined with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of 
flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS). We also undertook a meta-analysis of 
the literature referring to polymorphisms of RANK, RANKL and OPG genes and RA 
risk. This case-controlled study found that the polymorphism in the RANK gene 
rs1805034 was not related to RA risk. Stratification analyses by sex and age 
suggested that RANK gene rs1805034 polymorphism was not associated with the risk 
of RA among groups of male, female, age ≤ 55 and age > 55. Our meta-analysis 
found that the rs2277438 polymorphism in RANKL gene increased the risk of RA, 
whereas RANK gene rs1805034, OPG gene rs3102735, OPG gene rs2073618, OPG gene 
rs3134069 polymorphisms were not related to RA susceptibility. In conclusion, 
this case-controlled study and meta-analysis indicated that the RANKL gene 
rs2277438 polymorphism increased the RA risk, and that RANK gene rs1805034, OPG 
gene rs3102735, OPG gene rs2073618, OPG gene rs3134069 polymorphisms were not 
related to RA risk.

Urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse (POP) are increasing due to 
demographic factors. Increasing life expectancy and sociocultural demands of 
women require successful treatments that also have low complication rates. 
Classic open procedures such as colposuspension or colposacropexy (native tissue 
repair as well as mesh procedures) are experiencing a renaissance due to the 
current critical view of mesh-repair pelvic floor surgery and continue to be of 
great importance. With suitable patient selection, long-term results of 
abdominal procedures are on a par with minimally invasive techniques. 
Cosmetically acceptable results can be achieved with optimized incisions. The 
therapeutically relevant target for apical fixation is the elevation angle of 
the vagina (EAV). Minimally invasive mesh-based primary reconstructions and 
interventions for POP recurrence proved to be superior to conventional 
procedures due to good long-term results, lower recurrence rates and reduced 
early and late complication rates when anatomically correct and gentle surgery 
is performed with a critical selection of textile implants. Abdominal procedures 
are not inferior to minimally invasive techniques when instrumental suturing 
techniques and modern instruments are used. Adequate and critical information 
about surgical options and possible risks of complications should be provided in 
a timely manner. Education and training in modern diagnostics as well as in 
abdominal and current minimally invasive techniques and complication management 
should be implemented according to the guidelines and recommendations of 
professional societies, the Food and Drug Administration and the European 
Network of Information Centres.

Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is the only biomarker for the diagnosis of 
prostate cancer. So the PSA screening test is very important due to the high 
occurrence of prostate cancer in men. In this work, a label-free fluorescent 
method was developed based on terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) and 
G-quadruplex-thioflavin T complex for detecting PSA. In the absence of PSA, the 
PSA aptamer can be used as the primer for TdT extension reactions, resulting in 
the formation of G-quadruplexes and generation of strong fluorescent signals. 
After the addition of PSA, the PSA-aptamer complex prevented the TdT extension 
reaction due to steric hindrance, thus resulting in a poor fluorescent signal. 
The assay showed a wide linear range (0.1 to 80 pg/mL) and a detection limit of 
0.086 pg/mL (S/N = 3). It also has good specificity for PSA determination and 
gives satisfactory results when applied to biological samples. Conceivably, its 
merits such as good selectivity and high sensitivity indicate that the proposed 
method has a promising application potential in the clinical diagnosis and 
treatment of prostate cancer. Graphical abstract.

PURPOSE: The increased life expectancy in the general population is causing 
rapid growth of the number of elderly patients. Pituitary adenomas (PAs) are one 
of those tumors whose incidence increases with age. Pituitary surgery in elderly 
has usually been considered riskier than in the younger population. The aim of 
this study was to evaluate the surgical outcome of a large series of patients 
who underwent transsphenoidal surgery for PAs.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed a series of patients who underwent 
transsphenoidal surgery for PAs in our institution. Inclusion criteria were: 65 
years of age or more, and no previous pituitary surgery. Surgical outcomes of 
patients aged <70 years (group 1) was compared to those aged 70 years or more 
(group 2) at the time of surgery.
RESULTS: A total of 336 patients met the inclusion criteria. Clinically, 230 
(68.5%) patients had a non-functioning PAs. Among the remaining 106 patients 
with a hormone-secreting PA, 57 (53.8%) had acromegaly, 39 (36.8%) Cushing's 
disease, 5 patients (4.7%) had a prolactinoma, and 5 a thyrotropin-secreting PA 
(4.7%). Mortality rate was 1.5%. Groups 1 and 2 showed no significantly 
different surgery-related complication, visual recovery, radical surgery, and 
remission rates.
CONCLUSIONS: Surgical management of PAs in the elderly has been considered 
riskier than in the younger population. Our results demonstrated that 
transsphenoidal surgery is a safe and effective treatment for PAs. No 
statistically significant differences in terms of outcome were found in two 
group ages, showing that, when clinically indicated, transsphenoidal surgery can 
be performed even in very old subjects.

Filamentous fungi are excellent sources for the production of a group of 
bioactive small molecules which are often called secondary metabolites (SMs). 
The advanced genome sequencing technology combined with bioinformatics analysis 
reveals a large number of unexplored biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) in the 
fungal genomes. To unlock this fungal SM treasure, many approaches including 
heterologous expression are being developed and efficient cloning of the BGCs is 
a crucial step to do this. Here, we present an efficient strategy for the direct 
cloning of fungal BGCs. This strategy consisted of Splicing by Overlapping 
Extension (SOE)-PCR and yeast assembly in vivo. By testing 14 BGCs DNA fragments 
ranging from 7 kb to 52 kb, the average positive rate was over 80%. The maximal 
insertion size for fungal BGC assembly was 52 kb. Those constructs could be used 
conveniently for the heterologous expression leading to the discovery of novel 
natural products. Thus, our results provide an efficient and quick method for 
the low cost direct cloning of fungal BGCs.

Although telomere length (TL) shortens with age in most tissues, an age-related 
increase in length has been described in sperm through a mechanism that is not 
yet fully understood. Changes in TL with age in the same individual have not 
been explored. This longitudinal study examines TL dynamics in somatic tissue 
and gametes during an entire lifespan in an outbred mouse population (from 8 to 
up to 114 weeks of age). Our findings indicate a reduced life expectancy in 
males compared to females (84.75 ± 9.23 vs. 113.16 ± 0.20 weeks) and significant 
variability in TL dynamics between individuals. While with aging, a clear 
reduction in TL was produced in somatic cells and oocytes, telomeres in sperm 
cells significantly lengthened. Finally, we found evidence indicating that 
telomere elongation in sperm during aging may be dependent on different 
mechanisms, such as the survival of spermatogonia with longer telomeres and the 
alternative lengthening of telomeres mechanism in meiotic and postmeiotic 
spermatogenic cells.

[Reviewing the psychological and physical health effects of forests].

[Article in French]

Meyer-Schulz K, Bürger-Arndt R.

Civilization illnesses today impact, and will impact in the future, everyday 
life of people, particularly in high-income countries. Consequences are loss in 
life expectancy, reduction of quality of life as well as rising economic loads. 
The positive effects of stays and visits in natural environments on human 
well-being are known for a long time. Particularly, there are many indications 
that forest stays have health-promoting effects. This narrative review of the 
literature presents the current state of the research on health-promoting 
effects of forest exposure. Forest exposure has positive health effects on the 
cardiovascular system, the immune system and on mood. Especially in the context 
of stress reduction, forest exposure seems to have positive influences. However, 
little can be concluded about the extent of these positive effects, as most 
studies work without control environment or control groups. Moreover forest 
exposure is often associated with physical activity which is also known to have 
health benefits. Against the background of the positive health promoting trend 
further research should be carried out.

OBJECTIVE: To compare the medicines included in national essential medicines 
lists with the World Health Organization's (WHO's) Model list of essential 
medicines, and assess the extent to which countries' characteristics, such as 
WHO region, size and health care expenditure, account for the differences.
METHODS: We searched the WHO's Essential Medicines and Health Products 
Information Portal for national essential medicines lists. We compared each 
national list of essential medicines with both the 2017 WHO model list and other 
national lists. We used linear regression to determine whether differences were 
dependent on WHO Region, population size, life expectancy, infant mortality, 
gross domestic product and health-care expenditure.
FINDINGS: We identified 137 national lists of essential medicines that 
collectively included 2068 unique medicines. Each national list contained 
between 44 and 983 medicines (median 310: interquartile range, IQR: 269 to 422). 
The number of differences between each country's essential medicines list and 
WHO's model list ranged from 93 to 815 (median: 296; IQR: 265 to 381). Linear 
regression showed that only WHO region and health-care expenditure were 
significantly associated with the number of differences (adjusted R2 : 0.33; 
P < 0.05). Most medicines (1248; 60%) were listed by no more than 10% (14) of 
countries.
CONCLUSION: The substantial differences between national lists of essential 
medicines are only partly explained by differences in country characteristics 
and thus may not be related to different priority needs. This information helps 
to identify opportunities to improve essential medicines lists.

Publisher: OBJECTIF: Comparer les médicaments inclus dans les listes nationales 
des médicaments essentiels avec la Liste modèle de l'Organisation mondiale de la 
Santé (OMS) des médicaments essentiels, et déterminer dans quelle mesure les 
caractéristiques des pays, comme la région OMS, la taille et les dépenses de 
soins de santé, expliquent les différences.
MÉTHODES: Nous avons recherché des listes nationales des médicaments essentiels 
sur le Portail d'information – Médicaments essentiels et produits de santé de 
l'OMS. Nous avons comparé chaque liste nationale des médicaments essentiels avec 
la Liste modèle de l'OMS de 2017 et d'autres listes nationales. Nous avons 
utilisé une régression linéaire pour déterminer si les différences dépendaient 
de la région OMS, de la taille de la population, de l'espérance de vie, de la 
mortalité infantile, du produit intérieur brut et des dépenses de soins de 
santé.
RÉSULTATS: Nous avons sélectionné 137 listes nationales des médicaments 
essentiels qui contenaient au total 2068 médicaments différents. Chaque liste 
national recensait entre 44 et 983 médicaments (médiane: 310; intervalle 
interquartile, IQR: de 269 à 422). Le nombre des différences entre la liste des 
médicaments essentiels de chaque pays et la Liste modèle de l'OMS variait 
entre 93 et 815 (médiane: 296; IQR: de 265 à 381). La régression linéaire a 
montré que seules la région OMS et les dépenses de soins de santé étaient 
clairement associées au nombre des différences (R2 ajusté: 0,33; P < 0,05). La 
plupart des médicaments (1248; 60%) étaient listés par 10% (14) des pays, pas 
plus.
CONCLUSION: Les différences importantes entre les listes nationales des 
médicaments essentiels s'expliquent seulement en partie par des différences au 
niveau des caractéristiques des pays et ne sont donc pas forcément liées à 
différents besoins prioritaires. Ces informations aident à identifier des 
possibilités d'améliorations des listes des médicaments essentiels.

RESULTADOS: Identificamos 137 listas nacionales de medicamentos esenciales que 
incluían colectivamente 2068 medicamentos únicos. Cada lista nacional contenía 
entre 44 y 983 medicamentos (mediana 310: rango intercuartil, IQR: 269 a 422). 
El número de diferencias entre la lista de medicamentos esenciales de cada país 
y la Lista Modelo de la OMS osciló entre 93 y 815 (mediana: 296; IQR: 265 a

atención sanitaria se asociaron significativamente con el número de diferencias 
(R2 ajustado: 0,33; P < 0,05). La mayoría de los medicamentos (1248; 60 %) 
fueron listados por no más del 10 % (14) de los países.
CONCLUSIÓN: Las diferencias sustanciales entre las listas nacionales de 
medicamentos esenciales sólo se explican en parte por las diferencias en las 
características de los países y, por lo tanto, pueden no estar relacionadas con 
las diferentes necesidades prioritarias. Esta información ayuda a identificar 
oportunidades para mejorar las listas de medicamentos esenciales.

المدى الربيعي، IQR: 269 إلى 422). تراوح عدد الاختلافات بين قائمة الأدوية 
الأساسية لكل بلد والقائمة النموذجية لمنظمة الصحة العالمية، بين 93 و815 (المتوسط: 
296؛ المدى الربيعي: 265 إلى 381). أظهر التحوف الخطي أن كل من منطقة منظمة الصحة 
العالمية والإنفاق على الرعاية الصحية، وحدهما فقط مرتبطين بشكل كبير بعدد 
الاختلافات (نسبة R 2 المعدلة: 0.33؛ نسبة الاحتمال > 0.05). تم إدراج معظم الأدوية 
(1248؛ نسبة 60%) بواسطة ما لا يزيد عن 10% (14) من البلدان.
الاستنتاج: لا يمكن تفسير الاختلافات الجوهرية بين القوائم الوطنية للأدوية 
الأساسية على أساس الاختلافات في خصائص البلدان إلا بشكل جزئي، وبالتالي فقد لا 
تكون مرتبطة الاحتياجات ذات الأولوية المختلفة. وتساعد هذه المعلومات على تحديد فرص 
تحسين قوائم الأدوية الأساسية.

Publisher: 目的: 
将国家基本药物清单包含药物与《世界卫生组织基本药物标准清单》进行比较，并评估各国特征（例如世卫组织区域、规模和医疗保健支出）间的差异程度。.
方法: 
我们在世界卫生组织的基本药物和卫生产品信息门户网站对国家基本药物清单进行了搜索。我们将各国基本药物清单与 2017 年世卫组织标准清单以及其他国家清单均进行了比较。我们采用线性回归的分析方法来确定差异是否取决于世卫组织区域、人口规模、预期寿命、婴儿死亡率、国内生产总值和医疗保健支出等因素。.
结果: 
我们确定了 137 国的基本药物清单，这些清单共计包括 2068 种独特药物。各国清单包含 44 至 983 种药物（中值 310：四分位距，IQR：269 至 422）。各国基本药物清单与世卫组织标准清单间的差异数值范围为 93 至 815（中值：296；IQR：265 至 381）。线性回归显示，仅世卫组织区域和医疗保健支出与差异数值显著相关（调整后的 R2 
：0.33；P < 0.05）。仅有不超过 10% 的国家（14 个）将大多数药物（1248 种；占 60％）列入清单。.
结论: 国家特征差异只是国家基本药物清单之间实质性差异的部分原因，因此，这可能与不同的优先需求无关。此类信息有助于发现改进基本药物清单的机会。.

Publisher: ЦЕЛЬ: Сравнить лекарственные препараты, включенные в национальные 
перечни основных лекарственных средств с Примерным перечнем Всемирной 
организации здравоохранения (ВОЗ) основных лекарственных средств, и оценить, в 
какой мере характеристики страны, такие как регион ВОЗ, размеры и уровень затрат 
на здравоохранение, влияют на различия между ними.
МЕТОДЫ: Авторы провели поиск на информационном портале ВОЗ, посвященном основным 
лекарственным средствам и медицинской продукции, с целью найти там национальные 
перечни основных лекарственных средств. Каждый такой национальный перечень 
основных лекарственных средств сравнивался с Примерным перечнем ВОЗ 2017 года и 
с перечнями других стран. Авторы использовали линейную регрессию для определения 
того, зависели ли различия от региона ВОЗ, размера популяции, ожидаемой 
продолжительности жизни, детской смертности, валового национального продукта и 
затрат на здравоохранение.
РЕЗУЛЬТАТЫ: Было найдено 137 национальных перечней основных лекарственных 
средств, которые в совокупности включали 2068 уникальных лекарственных средств. 
В каждом национальном перечне было от 44 до 983 лекарственных средств (медианное 
значение 310, межквартильный размах (МКР): от 269 до 422). Количественно 
различие между перечнем основных лекарственных средств для каждой отдельной 
страны и Примерным перечнем ВОЗ основных лекарственных средств составляло от 93 
до 815 наименований (медианное значение 296, МКР: от 265 до 381). Линейная 
регрессия показала, что только регион ВОЗ и затраты на здравоохранение были в 
значительной мере связаны с количеством наблюдаемых различий (скорректированное 
значение R2: 0,33; P < 0,05). Большая часть лекарственных средств (1248, 60%) 
входила в перечни не более чем 10% стран (14 стран).
ВЫВОД: Существенные различия между национальными перечнями основных 
лекарственных средств лишь частично объясняются различными характеристиками 
государств и, следовательно, могут быть не связаны с разными приоритетными 
потребностями. Данная информация помогает выявить возможности для улучшения 
перечней основных лекарственных средств.

Gastrointestinal angiodysplasias (GIADs), also called angioectasias, are the 
most frequent vascular lesions. Its precise prevalence is unknown since most of 
them are asymptomatic. However, the incidence may be increasing since GIADs 
affect individuals aged more than 60 years and population life expectancy is 
globally increasing worldwide. They are responsible of about 5% to 10% of all 
gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) cases. Most GIADs are placed in small bowel, 
where are the cause of 50 to 60% of obscure GIB diagnosed with video capsule 
endoscopy. They may be the cause of fatal severe bleeding episodes; 
nevertheless, recurrent overt or occult bleeding episodes requiring repeated 
expensive treatments and disturbing patient's quality-of-life are more 
frequently observed. Diagnosis and treatment of GIADs (particularly those placed 
in small bowel) are a great challenge due to insidious disease behavior, 
inaccessibility to affected sites and limitations of available diagnostic 
procedures. Hemorrhagic causality out of the actively bleeding lesions detected 
by diagnostic procedures may be difficult to establish. No treatment guidelines 
are currently available, so there is a high variability in the management of 
these patients. In this review, the epidemiology and pathophysiology of GIADs 
and the status in the diagnosis and treatment, with special emphasis on small 
bowel angiodysplasias based on multiple publications, are critically discussed. 
In addition, a classification of GIADs based on their endoscopic characteristics 
is proposed. Finally, some aspects that need to be clarified in future research 
studies are highlighted.

BACKGROUND: Telomere maintenance is an important factor in tumorigenesis. PinX1 
is a potent telomerase regulator which also involves in telomerase loading to 
telomeres. Nucleophosmin (NPM) can partially attenuate PinX1 inhibition of 
telomerase activity and NPM loading to hTERT requires PinX1. However, the role 
of the PinX1/NPM interaction in telomerase activity is not fully understood.
METHOD: The long-term effects of PinX1 and NPM down-regulation on telomere 
length were investigated by TRF assay. The localization of the PinX1/NPM 
association and the NPM/PinX1/hTERT complex formation were examined by 
immunofluorescence studies.
RESULTS: Concurrent long-term down-regulation of PinX1 and NPM led to a 
substantial decrease in telomere length. The interaction with PinX1 was crucial 
in NPM localization in the nucleolus during the S phase. PinX1 and NPM 
associated throughout S phase and the NPM/PinX1/hTERT complex formation peaked 
during the early-S phase. The PinX1/NPM interaction was shown to localize away 
from Cajal Bodies at the start of S phase.
CONCLUSION: PinX1/NPM interaction is important in telomerase regulation during 
catalysis. NPM is recruited to hTERT by PinX1 and is required in the proposed 
telomerase modulating unit to activate telomerase when telomere extension occurs 
during S phase.

BACKGROUND: Limb salvaging surgeries are current surgical treatment of extremity 
bone sarcomas. Resected bone replacement consists of two main methods; tumor 
prosthesis versus structural allograft. Biological reconstruction with an 
allograft is an economic cheap method in young sarcoma patients, however, the 
surgeons are more convinced with tumor prosthesis replacement.
METHODS: We evaluated the short-term complications and functional results of 40 
patients with aggressive extremity tumors in a retrospective cohort study. The 
mean age of cases was 25 and we followed them for 24 months. 17 patients 
underwent tumor prosthesis replacement after wide resection of limb sarcomas. 16 
cases had structural allograft reconstruction and 7 patients treated with 
amputation. We matched confounders including age, sex, blood cell count and 
chemotherapy treatment in the study groups.
RESULTS: We found 15 major complications (45.5%) in limb salvage surgeries 
composing infection, allograft nonunion, allograft fracture, prosthesis 
fracture, prosthesis loosening and device failure that needed another surgery to 
be resolved. We had 10 major complications in allograft group (62%) and 5 in 
tumor prosthesis group (29.4%). Although the rate of complications was higher in 
allograft group, it didn't statistically indicate strong correlation (Fisher's 
exact: 0.084). Mean Musculo-Skeletal tumor rating Scale (MSTS) score was 
25.8(73.7%) and 22.3(63.7%) in allograft group and prosthesis cases 
respectively. MSTS score had a normal distribution in the different groups with 
no significant difference between them.
CONCLUSION: Although complications were higher in the allograft group, allograft 
could be offered to bone sarcoma patients, whom are predicted to have short life 
expectancy.

BACKGROUND: The number of seriously injured unprotected road users has increased 
during implementation of a road safety policy Vision Zero. The aim of the study 
is to identify factors associated with the increase in serious injuries among 
cyclists and pedestrians (even single pedestrian accidents) that occurred in an 
urban road space in a Swedish region 2003-17. The urban road space includes 
roads, pavements and tracks for walking and cycling.
METHODS: Data were retrieved from STRADA (Swedish Traffic Accident Data 
Acquisition) and NVDB (National Road Database). Descriptive statistics and 
logistic regression with odds ratios for sex, age and part of road space were 
assessed.
RESULTS: The number of seriously injured cyclists and pedestrians more than 
doubled from 2003 to 2017, with the greatest increase for pedestrians. Older age 
increased the probability of serious injury since 2012 for the group ≥ 80 years 
and since 2015 for the group 65-79 years. No significant effect of sex. Most 
injuries occur in areas not transformed by Vision Zero.
CONCLUSIONS: An increasing number of elderly persons in the generation born in 
the 1940s and increased life expectancy are important factors. There is a need 
to increase road safety measures that also promote active mobility.

431. Pharmacoeconomic Review Report (Resubmission): NUSINERSEN (SPINRAZA):
(Biogen  Canada Inc.): Indication: Treatment of patients with 5q spinal muscular
atrophy  [Internet].

Ottawa (ON): Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health; 2019 Apr.
CADTH Common Drug Reviews.

Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a severe neuromuscular disease and is the 
leading genetic cause of infant death. It is characterized by the degeneration 
of alpha motor neurons in the anterior horn of the spinal cord, leading to 
progressive muscle weakness. The most common form of SMA, 5q SMA, makes up more 
than 95% of all cases and is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by 
homozygous deletion or deletion and mutation of the alleles of the survival 
motor neuron 1 gene. SMA is a rare disease and estimates of its incidence and 
prevalence vary between studies. The incidence of SMA is often cited as being 
approximately 10 in 100,000 live births. Four clinical subtypes of SMA are 
described: SMA type I makes up about 60% of SMA diagnoses where patients show 
symptoms before six months of age, never achieve the motor milestone of sitting 
unsupported, and generally do not survive past two years of age due to 
respiratory failure. Those with SMA type II achieve the milestone of sitting 
unsupported, but never walk independently; symptoms generally appear between six 
and 18 months after birth and most patients will survive past the age of 25, 
with life expectancy improved by aggressive supportive care. SMA type III makes 
up approximately 10% to 20% of SMA cases3 and presents between 18 months of age 
and adulthood. These patients are able to walk independently at some point in 
their lives and typically have a normal life expectancy. SMA type IV constitutes 
a very small proportion of SMA cases, has an adult onset, and is the mildest 
form of the disease. Although muscle weakness is present, these patients retain 
the ability to walk, have a normal life expectancy, and do not suffer from 
respiratory or nutritional issues. Nusinersen (Spinraza) is a solution for 
intrathecal injection, indicated for the treatment of 5q SMA. It is available as 
a single-use solution in a 5 mL vial size (12 mg) administered intrathecal by 
lumbar puncture. The recommended dose is initial treatment with four loading 
doses, with the first three loading doses administered at 14-day intervals (day 
0, day 14, and day 28), and a final loading dose approximately 30 days after the 
third loading dose (day 63); maintenance treatment is 12 mg every four months. 
At the marketed price of $118,000 per 5 mL vial, the annual cost of treatment 
with nusinersen ranges from $354,000 for maintenance treatment (three doses) to 
$708,000 in the first year (six doses). The manufacturer’s listing request is 
per the Health Canada indication. As part of a resubmission the manufacturer 
provided new clinical information relating to different subpopulations with SMA 
(see CADTH Common Drug Review [CDR] Clinical Report). The manufacturer, however, 
did not provide a revised economic submission nor did it provide any discussion 
relating to the new clinical information and how this may impact the findings of 
the economic review based on the original submission. Thus, the CDR economic 
review remains unchanged with no further data provided to refute the original 
issues or limitations identified.

Nonsyndromic thoracic aortic aneurysm and dissection (TAAD) account for 95% of 
all TAAD cases and comprise a subset in which the lack of obvious clinical signs 
makes diagnosis a challenge. Despite the potentially fatal natural history, 
timely diagnosis and prophylactic surgical intervention allow restoration of 
near-normal life expectancy in TAAD patients, underlining the critical 
importance of screening tests. To date, more than 30 TAAD disease-causing genes 
have been identified, and over 30% of nonsyndromic TAAD patients have a genetic 
mutation in 1 or more of these genes. Whole exome sequencing allows routine 
genetic testing in a clinical setting by screening for all TAAD-related genes, 
thus facilitating personalized aortic care. Additionally, increased vigilance 
upon diagnosis of certain TAAD-related diseases ("guilty associates") and the 
emergence of modern radiologic and novel serologic screening tests will further 
bolster efforts to detect undiagnosed asymptomatic nonsyndromic TAAD.

PURPOSE: Hormone therapy without radiation therapy is considered appropriate for 
women age 70 or above with low-risk, hormone-positive breast cancer after 
partial mastectomy. However, some patients may prefer radiation without hormone 
therapy, for which there is minimal modern data. We modeled the comparative 
efficacy of aromatase inhibition alone without radiation versus radiation alone 
without hormone therapy.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: We constructed a patient-level Markov model and compared 
5 years of anastrozole to a 15-fraction course of radiation without boost or 
anastrozole. The relative effectiveness between treatments was based on the 
National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project B-21 trial, which was 
further adjusted such that the endocrine-alone arm matched the Cancer and 
Leukemia Group B 9343 and PRIME II trials. Common or severe side effects were 
considered. Eight survival metrics were assessed and validated against clinical 
trial data. The cost-efficacy of each strategy was considered using the 
quality-adjusted life year and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER).
RESULTS: The model's predicted outcomes matched those demonstrated by modern 
trials. Aromatase inhibitors were superior in preventing contralateral cancers, 
with a small impact on the risk of distant metastatic disease. Radiation was 
superior in preventing ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence with a small impact 
on regional failure. No clinically significant differences were seen in the 
other 4 oncologic endpoints. Differences in quality-adjusted life years were 
small, but radiation therapy was $3809 more expensive over the average lifetime. 
The ICER suggested anastrozole was cost-effective in 62% of probabilistic 
simulations. However, the ICER was unstable owing to a denominator that 
approached zero.
CONCLUSIONS: Women age 70 or above with low-risk early breast cancer who are 
reluctant or unable to pursue adjuvant aromatase inhibition can safely pursue 
adjuvant radiation alone with limited differences in outcome and a modest 
increase in costs.

BACKGROUND: People living with psychosis, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, major 
depressive disorders and other delusional disorders, collectively termed ‘severe 
mental illness’ (SMI), are at increased risk of dying prematurely from 
cardiovascular disease (CVD). The risk factors associated with this reduced life 
expectancy are largely modifiable.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper is to provide summative evidence of some of the 
known effective interventions that may reduce cardiovascular risk in people 
living with SMI.
DISCUSSION: Pharmacological and nonpharmacological interventions are available 
and can be used in primary care for CVD risk reduction in people with SMI. 
Trials of pharmacological interventions for weight gain and smoking have shown 
good effects. Combined pharmacological and lifestyle interventions could support 
management of other risk factors, but tailored support and engagement strategies 
are needed. Specific guidance for CVD risk reduction in people with SMI is 
absent, but evidence indicates that following guidelines for the general 
population is warranted.

INTRODUCTION: The number of young adults with complex healthcare needs due to 
life-limiting conditions/complex physical disability has risen significantly as 
children with complex conditions survive into adulthood. Respite care and short 
breaks are an essential service, however, needs often go unmet after the 
transition to adult services, leading to a significant impact on the life 
expectancy and quality of life for this population. We aim to identify, appraise 
and synthesise relevant evidence to explore respite care and short breaks 
provision for this population, and to develop a conceptual framework for 
understanding service models.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A mixed-methods systematic review conducted in two stages: 
(1) knowledge map and (2) evidence review. We will comprehensively search 
multiple electronic databases; use the Citations, Lead authors, Unpublished 
materials, Google Scholar, Theories, Early examples, and Related projects 
(CLUSTER) approach, search relevant websites and circulate a 'call for 
evidence'. Using the setting, perspective, intervention/phenomenon of interest, 
comparison and evaluation framework, two reviewers will independently select 
evidence for inclusion into a knowledge map and subsequent evidence review, 
extract data relating to study and population characteristics, methods and 
outcomes; and assess the quality of evidence. A third reviewer will arbitrate 
where necessary.Evidence will be synthesised using the following approaches: 
quantitative (narratively/conducting meta-analyses where appropriate); 
qualitative (framework approach); policy and guidelines (documentary analysis 
informed approach). An overall, integrated synthesis will be created using a 
modified framework approach. We will use Grading of Recommendations Assessment, 
Development and Evaluation (GRADE)/GRADE-Confidence in the Evidence from Reviews 
of Qualitative Research to assess the strength and confidence of the synthesised 
evidence. Throughout, we will develop a conceptual framework to articulate how 
service models work in relation to context and setting.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval is not required as this is a 
systematic review. We will present our work in academic journals, at appropriate 
conferences; we will disseminate findings across networks using a range of 
media. Steering and advisory groups were established to ensure findings are 
shared widely and in accessible formats.

There is growing interest in interventions that enhance placebo responses in 
clinical practice, given the possibility that this would lead to better patient 
health and more effective therapy outcomes. Previous studies suggest that 
placebo effects can be maximized by optimizing patients' outcome expectations. 
However, expectancy interventions are difficult to validate because of 
methodological challenges, such as reliable blinding of the clinician providing 
the intervention. Here we propose a novel approach using mobile apps that can 
provide highly standardized expectancy interventions in a blinded manner, while 
at the same time assessing data in everyday life using experience sampling 
methodology (e.g., symptom severity, expectations) and data from smartphone 
sensors. Methodological advantages include: 1) full standardization; 2) reliable 
blinding and randomization; 3) disentangling expectation effects from other
