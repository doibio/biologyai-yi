dissemination period (2014-2015), and 3) alternative comparator classification.
RESULTS: Articles averaged 60% adherence to methodological specifications and 
74% adherence to reporting standards. While methodological adherence scores did 
not significantly improve (59% pre-2014 vs. 60% post-2014, p = 0.53), reporting 
adherence scores increased slightly over time (72% pre-2014 vs. 75% post-2014, 
p<0.01). Overall, reporting adherence scores exceeded methodological adherence 
scores (74% vs. 60%, p<0.001). Articles seldom addressed budget impact (9% 
reporting, 10% methodological) or equity (7% reporting, 7% methodological).
CONCLUSIONS: The iDSI reference case has substantial potential to serve as a 
useful resource for researchers and policy-makers in global health settings, but 
greater effort to promote adherence and awareness is needed to achieve its 
potential.

BACKGROUND: A model for triaging patients in primary care to provide immediate 
contact with the most appropriate profession to treat the condition in question 
has been developed and implemented in parts of Sweden. Direct triaging of 
patients with musculoskeletal disorders (MSD) to physiotherapists at primary 
healthcare centres has been proposed as an alternative to initial assessment by 
general practitioners (GPs) and has been shown to have many positive effects. 
The aim of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness from the societal 
perspective of this new care-pathway through primary care regarding triaging 
patients with MSD to initial assessment by physiotherapists compared to standard 
practice with initial GP assessment.
METHODS: Nurse-assessed patients with MSD (N = 55) were randomised to initial 
assessment and treatment with either physiotherapists or GPs and were followed 
for 1 year regarding health-related quality of life, utilization of healthcare 
resources and absence from work for MSD. Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) 
were calculated based on EQ5D measured at 5 time-points. Costs for healthcare 
resources and production loss were compiled. Incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratios (ICERS) were calculated. Multiple imputation was used to compensate for 
missing values and bootstrapping to handle uncertainty. A cost-effectiveness 
plane and a cost-effectiveness acceptability curve were construed to describe 
the results.
RESULTS: The group who were allocated to initial assessment by physiotherapists 
had slightly larger gains in QALYs at lower total costs. At a willingness-to-pay 
threshold of 20,000 €, the likelihood that the intervention was cost-effective 
from a societal perspective including production loss due to MSD was 85% 
increasing to 93% at higher thresholds. When only healthcare costs were 
considered, triaging to physiotherapists was still less costly in relation to 
health improvements than standard praxis.
CONCLUSION: From the societal perspective, this small study indicated that 
triaging directly to physiotherapists in primary care has a high likelihood of 
being cost-effective. However, further larger randomised trials will be 
necessary to corroborate these findings.

Erratum in
    Lancet. 2019 May 25;393(10186):2124.

Being the second-largest country in the Middle East, Iran has a long history of 
civilisation during which several dynasties have been overthrown and established 
and health-related structures have been reorganised. Iran has had the 
replacement of traditional practices with modern medical treatments, emergence 
of multiple pioneer scientists and physicians with great contributions to the 
advancement of science, environmental and ecological changes in addition to 
large-scale natural disasters, epidemics of multiple communicable diseases, and 
the shift towards non-communicable diseases in recent decades. Given the lessons 
learnt from political instabilities in the past centuries and the approaches 
undertaken to overcome health challenges at the time, Iran has emerged as it is 
today. Iran is now a country with a population exceeding 80 million, mainly 
inhabiting urban regions, and has an increasing burden of non-communicable 
diseases, including cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, diabetes, 
malignancies, mental disorders, substance abuse, and road injuries.

OBJECTIVES: An increase in life expectancy is predicted for the general 
population and, by 2050, about one billion people will be older than 65 years. 
The Global Cancer Incidence, Mortality and Prevalence database estimates that 
1.2 million people of this age will have cancer; this number represents 58% of 
new cases in the American population. This represents a challenge for diagnosis 
and treatment, given that some older people have multiple comorbidities and 
disabilities.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective descriptive study of 204 
patients aged 65 years and over. All had a solid tumor that was diagnosed in a 
private hospital from January 2015 to December 2017.
RESULTS: The median age was 72.2 years; the most frequent age group (48.5% of 
patients) was 65-75 years, and only a small percentage (4.4%) were aged > 85 
years. The most common type of cancer was lung cancer (22.5%), followed by 
colorectal and urinary cancer. Most patients received cancer treatment after the 
disease diagnosis.
CONCLUSION: There are no epidemiological studies of the older oncology 
population in Mexico. We believe it is necessary to perform larger studies to 
understand this population and to undertake actions to facilitate greater 
attention to patient diagnosis, treatment, and alleviation.

INTRODUCTION: Long lesions contribute to a significant number of percutaneous 
coronary interventions.
AIM: To assess the efficacy and safety of a novel long-tapered drug-eluting 
stent (DES) at a 12-month follow-up (FU) in patients with long coronary 
atherosclerotic lesions.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A prospective clinical cohort study was conducted in 32 
patients who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention using a BioMime Morph 
tapered stent (Meril Life Sciences, India). The patients were followed for 3, 6, 
and 12 months. The safety endpoints were death, myocardial infarction (MI), 
target lesion revascularization (TLR), target vessel revascularization (TVR), 
and MACE and/or major bleeding.
RESULTS: Mean lesion length was 48 mm (range: 35-70 mm) measured via 
quantitative coronary analysis (QCA). In most cases, the target lesion was 
located in the LAD (68.75%). A GuideLiner catheter (Vascular Solutions Inc., MN, 
USA) was used in 12.5% of procedures; buddy-wire technique in 9.4% of cases. 
Bifurcation lesions were treated in 40.6% of cases. Additional stent 
implantation was needed in 56% of the procedures (25% of cases due to proximal 
or distal dissection, or due to insufficient stent length in 31% of cases). On 
12-month FU we observed 1 TLR (3.1%), 1 TVR (3.1%), and 1 non-cardiovascular 
death.
CONCLUSIONS: The long sirolimus-eluting stent with tapered structure was 
characterized by good deliverability in long coronary lesions, although in some 
cases "buddy wire" or extension microcatheter use was necessary. Follow-up at 3, 
6, and 12 months showed no significant major adverse cardiovascular events 
related to the device.

INTRODUCTION: The use of bariatric surgery has increased for morbidly obese 
patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD) for whom listing on the waitlist is 
often restricted until a certain BMI threshold is achieved. Effective weight 
loss for this population improves access to life-saving renal transplantation. 
However, it is unclear whether sleeve gastrectomy (SG) vs Roux-en-Y gastric 
bypass (RYGB) is a more effective therapy for these patients.
METHODS: A decision analytic Markov state transition model was created to 
simulate the life of morbidly obese patients with ESRD who were deemed 
ineligible to be waitlisted for renal transplantation unless they achieved a BMI 
less than 35 kg/m2. Life expectancy following weight management (MWM), RYGB, and 
SG were estimated. Base case patients were defined as having a pre-intervention 
BMI of 45 kg/m2. Sensitivity analysis of initial BMI was performed. Markov 
parameters were extracted from literature review.
RESULTS: RYGB improved survival compared with SG and MWM. RYGB patients had 
higher rates of transplantation, leading to improved mean long-term survival. 
Base case patients who underwent RYGB gained 1.3 additional years of life 
compared with patient's who underwent SG and 2.6 additional years of life 
compared with MWM.
CONCLUSIONS: RYGB improves access to renal transplantation and thereby increases 
long-term survival compared with SG and MWM. The use of SG may be incongruent 
with the goal of improving access to renal transplantation for morbidly obese 
patients.

Goals-of-care discussions at end-of-life are associated with increased patient 
satisfaction and reduced treatment burdens, reduced family and healthcare worker 
distress and healthcare costs, while achieving equal life-expectancy. It is 
unclear how goals-of-care discussions should occur. The objective of the study 
was to determine which patients could benefit, requirements, content, 
documentation, and harms and benefits of emergency medicine goals-of-care 
discussions. We sought primary evidence on goals-of-care discussions in EDs with 
adult patients nearing end-of-life, published in English after 1989. Data 
sources included Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Web of Science and reference 
lists of included articles. One thousand nine hundred and twenty abstracts were 
screened, five articles selected. There was no consensus on the meaning of 
goals-of-care, which is often confused with advanced care planning and treatment 
limitation. Emergency clinicians can identify most patients needing discussions 
following training. There was no evidence for how to involve stakeholders, nor 
how to adapt conversations to meet cultural and linguistically diverse needs. 
Expert panels have suggested requirements and content for conversations with 
little supporting evidence. There was no evidence for how emergency 
conversations differ to those in other settings, nor for harms or benefits for 
holding goals-of-care conversations in EDs. Increased ED goals-of-care 
conversations increased hospice referral and reduced in-patient admissions. Most 
studies were of moderate quality only, outcomes were not standardised and sample 
sizes were small. 'Goals-of-care' is used inconsistently across the literature. 
This is the first systematic review regarding goals-of-care discussions in EDs. 
Further research is needed on all aspects of these conversations.

INTRODUCTION: With the increasing life expectancy of patients with haemophilia 
(PWH), the number of PWH with age-related comorbidities, such as ischaemic 
events, is increasing.
AIM: We conducted this multicentre observational study to identify the risk 
factors for major ischaemic events in PWH.
METHODS: This study was the first multicentre observational study, conducted 
with the participation of five haemophilia treatment centres in Japan, conducted 
in ≥30-year-old adult PWH. The latest data recorded in the medical charts 
between 1 January and 31 December 2016 were reviewed. Healthcare data collected 
from the National Health and Nutrition Survey were used as the control data.
RESULTS: Data of a total of 711 patients were collected. Only two PWH (0.3%) had 
a history of ischaemic events. Age-adjusted analysis indicated that the 
prevalence of hypertension defined as a blood pressure of 140/90 mm Hg or over 
was similar in the PWH to that in the males of the general population. However, 
when hypertension was defined more strictly (≥130/85 mm Hg), the prevalence was 
significantly lower in PWH than in the general male population. The hypertension 
in PWH was associated with the age, BMI, CKD, HIV infection and inhibitors. In 
particular, the odds ratio for the presence of inhibitors was high (odds 
ratio = 7.529).
CONCLUSION: Whether the present results can be attributed to Japanese ethnicity 
or to the presence of haemophilia per se remains uncertain. We propose to 
initiate a prospective study for further investigation.

: Despite the decreasing total incidence of liver-related deaths, liver disease 
remains one of the major non-AIDS causes of morbidity and mortality amongst 
people living with HIV, and a significant proportion of liver disease in these 
individuals can be attributed to nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). NAFLD 
in HIV infection is a growing problem in view of increasing life expectancy 
associated with the use of effective antiretroviral therapy (ART), wider uptake 
of ART and increasing rates of obesity in many Asian as well as western 
countries. The problem may be more pronounced in developing countries where 
there are limited resources available for mass screening and diagnosis of NAFLD. 
There is a small but growing body of literature examining NAFLD in the setting 
of HIV, with data from low and middle-income countries (LMICs) particularly 
lacking. Here, we review the cohort data on NAFLD in HIV, and discuss the risk 
factors, pathogenesis of hepatic steatosis, NAFLD and nonalcoholic 
steatohepatitis (NASH), diagnostic approaches and therapeutic options available 
for NAFLD in the setting of HIV, and the specific challenges of NAFLD in HIV for 
LMICs.

BACKGROUND: The critical implications of the expected years of life lost (EYLL) 
index of cancer for health policy assessments have been largely overlooked. We 
advocate to standardize life lost indices.
METHODS: Using the Taiwan Cancer Registry database as an example, we calculated 
the EYLL and the age-standardized EYLL to facilitate comparisons among cancer 
types (a total of 903,935 patients from the database). The International Cancer 
Survival Standard was used for calculating age-standardized EYLL.
RESULTS: Pancreatic cancer is the most severe cancer in Taiwan, with the 
greatest age-standardized EYLL for the men (15.6 years) and women (18.0 years) 
as well as for the men and women combined (16.6 years). Negative correlations 
were observed between unstandardized EYLL of cancer and mean age at diagnosis.
CONCLUSIONS: The unstandardized EYLL represents an overall assessment of disease 
burden, whereas the age-standardized EYLL is a suitable measure of disease 
severity. We suggest that both measures be incorporated into routine annual 
reports of cancer statistics alongside the usual incidence and mortality rates 
and their age-standardized counterparts.

Endogenous ochronosis (EO) or alkaptonuria is an inherited autosomal recessive 
disease caused by the insufficiency of the enzyme homogentisic acid dioxygenase. 
This disturbance causes an accumulation and increased renal excretion of 
homogentisic acid (AHG), which manifests as dark urine when it oxidizes on 
contact with air. Other clinical manifestations of OE are the result of the 
deposit of AHG in the form of ochronotic pigment at the level of collagen in the 
skin and cartilage, where it causes blue-gray cutaneous hyperpigmentation, 
degenerative arthropathy, valvular disease, and other multisystem effects. 
Despite the progressive and irreversible nature of OE and the lack of a curative 
treatment, the life expectancy is preserved. We report a new case of EO with 
cutaneous and joint involvement, in which a high clinical suspicion, confirmed 
by elevated AHG in urine was the key in the diagnosis.

In patients with advanced esophageal or gastric cancer, it is highly likely that 
palliation of symptoms will become a focus of treatment. Dysphagia and 
obstruction are the most common complaints, and many of these patients can be 
treated with endoscopic interventions to alleviate symptoms. Bleeding, 
perforation, and nutritional issues are common problems. Attempts at palliation 
should be guided by thoughtful discussions regarding patients' goals of care. 
Owing to the high morbidity and mortality in patients with limited life 
expectancy, a strategy of working from the least invasive to the most invasive 
interventions should be guided by the patient's goals.

Global trends in lifespan inequality: 1950-2015.

de Catalunya), Cerdanyola del Vallès, Barcelona, Spain.

Using data from the UN World Population Prospects, we document global trends in 
lifespan inequality from 1950 until 2015. Our findings indicate that (i) there 
has been a sustained decline in overall lifespan inequality, (ii) adult lifespan 
variability has also declined, but some plateaus and trend reversals have been 
identified, (iii) lifespan inequality among the elderly has increased virtually 
everywhere, and (iv) most of the world variability in age-at-death can be 
attributed to within-country variability. Such changes have occurred against a 
backdrop of generalized longevity increases. Our analyses suggest that the world 
is facing a new challenge: the emergence of diverging trends in longevity and 
age-at-death inequality among the elderly around the globe-particularly in 
high-income areas. As larger fractions of the world population survive to more 
advanced ages, it will be necessary for national and international health 
planners to recognize the growing heterogeneity that characterizes older 
populations.

Unemployment and cause-specific mortality among the Belgian working-age 
population: The role of social context and gender.

Social Sciences & Solvay Business School, Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Brussels, 
Belgium.

BACKGROUND: Life expectancy increased in industrialized countries, but 
inequalities in health and mortality by socioeconomic position (SEP) still 
persist. Several studies have documented educational inequalities, yet the 
association between health and employment status remains unclear. However, this 
is an important issue considering the instability of the labour market and the 
fact that unemployment now also touches 'non-traditional groups' (e.g. the 
high-educated). This study will 1) probe into the association between 
unemployment and cause-specific mortality; 2) look into the possible protective 
effect of sociodemographic variables; 3) assess the association between 
unemployment, SEP, gender and cause-specific mortality.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Individually linked data of the Belgian census (2001) and 
Register data on emigration and cause-specific mortality during 2001-2011 are 
used. The study population contains the Belgian population eligible for 
employment at census, based on age (25-59 years) and being in good health. Both 
absolute and relative measures of all-cause and cause-specific mortality by 
employment status have been calculated, stratified by gender and adjusted for 
sociodemographic and socioeconomic indicators.
RESULTS: Unemployed men and women were at a higher risk for all-cause and 
cause-specific mortality compared with their employed counterparts. The excess 
mortality among unemployed Belgians was particularly high for endocrine and 
digestive diseases, mental disorders, and falls, and more pronounced among men 
than among women. Other indicators of SEP did only slightly decrease the 
mortality disadvantage of being unemployed.
DISCUSSION: The findings stress the need for actions to ameliorate the health 
status of unemployed people, especially for the most vulnerable groups in 
society.

Thehead gap gene buttonhead (btd) is required for the patterning of head 
segments in the early Drosophila embryo. Mutant phenotypes of btd display a 
gap-like phenotype in which antennal, intercalary, mandibular and the anterior 
portion of the maxillary segmentsare eliminated. In agreement with the 
phenotypes, btd is expressed in a stripe covering the head segments at the 
blastoderm stage. During the early phase of the germband extension, btd is 
expressed in stripes with single segmental periodicity, which is required for 
the formation of the peripheral nervous system. In contrast to the key role of 
btd in Drosophila embryonic development, it has been suggested that Tribolium 
ortholog of btd (Tc-btd) is dispensable for embryonic head development. In order 
for better understanding of the requirement of Tc-btd in the early Tribolium 
embryo, we re-analyzed the expression patterns and functions of Tc-btd during 
embryonic segmentation. Tc-btd is expressed in segmental stripes at the stages 
of blastoderm and germband elongation. Up to 28.3% of embryos in which Tc-btd is 
knocked down displays the loss of antennal, mandibular and the pregnathal 
regions in the head, with abdominal segments being disrupted in the trunk. Our 
findings suggest that Tc-btd is required for the head and trunk development in 
the early Tribolium embryo.

BACKGROUND: Pompe disease is a rare, severe neuromuscular disease with high 
mortality and substantial clinical and humanistic burden. However, the economic 
burden of Pompe disease and the health economic value of its treatments are not 
well understood. The objectives of this systematic review were to characterize 
the health economic evidence on Pompe disease, including healthcare resource use 
and costs (direct and indirect), health utilities, and the cost-effectiveness of 
current treatments used to manage patients with Pompe disease.
METHODS: A systematic search of MEDLINE® and Embase® was performed to retrieve 
publications on the health economics of Pompe disease. Publications were 
screened according to predefined criteria, extracted, and quality assessed using 
the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Data were narratively synthesized.
RESULTS: Eight publications evaluated patients with infantile-onset Pompe 
disease (IOPD) (two studies), late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD) (four studies), or 
both (two studies). In IOPD, total cost of supportive therapy (excluding 
treatment) was €32,871 (equivalent to US$41,667 when adjusted for currency and 
inflation to 2017 US dollars) over a life expectancy of 0.4 years. In adult 
LOPD, the average annual cost per patient of supportive therapy was €22,475 
(adjusted $28,489). Resource use in LOPD was high, with nursing home admissions 
accounting for 19% of annual direct medical costs. Health economic evaluations 
estimating incremental costs per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained with 
enzyme-replacement therapy (ERT) versus supportive therapy ranged from £109,991 
(adjusted, $186,851) per QALY gained in Columbia to €1,043,868 (adjusted, 
$1,323,207) in the Netherlands.
DISCUSSION: Despite a full systematic literature search, only eight relevant 
publications were identified, most of which were of relatively poor quality. 
However, a significant economic burden of Pompe disease on patients, families, 
healthcare systems, and society was found, with the majority of costs driven by 
the only currently approved treatment, ERT. Health economic evaluations of ERT 
versus supportive therapy vary significantly, with the majority well above 
willingness-to-pay thresholds. New therapies and approaches to care are needed 
to address the persistent and lifelong economic burden of Pompe disease and the 
large incremental cost-effectiveness ratios observed.

New genetic diagnostic approaches have greatly aided efforts to document global 
biodiversity and improve biosecurity. This is especially true for organismal 
groups in which species diversity has been underestimated historically due to 
difficulties associated with sampling, the lack of clear morphological 
characteristics, and/or limited availability of taxonomic expertise. Among these 
methods, DNA sequence barcoding (also known as "DNA barcoding") and by 
extension, meta-barcoding for biological communities, has emerged as one of the 
most frequently utilized methods for DNA-based species identifications. 
Unfortunately, the use of DNA barcoding is limited by the availability of 
complete reference libraries (i.e., a collection of DNA sequences from 
morphologically identified species), and by the fact that the vast majority of 
species do not have sequences present in reference databases. Such conditions 
are critical especially in tropical locations that are simultaneously 
biodiversity rich and suffer from a lack of exploration and DNA characterization 
by trained taxonomic specialists. To facilitate efforts to document biodiversity 
in regions lacking complete reference libraries, we developed a novel 
statistical approach that categorizes unidentified species as being either 
likely native or likely nonnative based solely on measures of nucleotide 
diversity. We demonstrate the utility of this approach by categorizing a large 
sample of specimens of terrestrial insects and spiders (collected as part of the 
Moorea BioCode project) using a generalized linear mixed model (GLMM). Using a 
training data set of known endemic (n = 45) and known introduced species 
(n = 102), we then estimated the likely native/nonnative status for 4,663 
specimens representing an estimated 1,288 species (412 identified species), 
including both those specimens that were either unidentified or whose 
endemic/introduced status was uncertain. Using this approach, we were able to 
increase the number of categorized specimens by a factor of 4.4 (from 794 to 
3,497), and the number of categorized species by a factor of 4.8 from (147 to 
707) at a rate much greater than chance (77.6% accuracy). The study identifies 
phylogenetic signatures of both native and nonnative species and suggests 
several practical applications for this approach including monitoring 
biodiversity and facilitating biosecurity.

Africa Rising, a Narrative for Life Expectancy Gains? Evidence from a Health 
Production Function.

Salami D(1), Shaaban AN(1), Oliveira Martins MDR(1).

Author information:
(1)Global Public Health, Institute of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, Nova 
University of Lisbon, PT.

BACKGROUND: The narrative of Africa Rising has increasingly been called into 
scrutiny, not just as a debate for economic growth and development, but also as 
a possible link to the surge in life expectancy on the continent. Theoretically, 
an increase in economic development tends to result in an increase in public 
health spending and subsequent better health outcomes.
OBJECTIVE: This paper examines the contribution of economic development and 
other social determinants to the health status of the African continent and to 
provide evidence on whether the increase in life expectancy of the past two 
decades can be largely attributed to the Africa Rising narrative.
METHODS: We estimated an empirical health production function, with life 
expectancy gains as the output of the health care system, and various 
socio-economic, environmental and lifestyle factors as contributory factors. We 
fitted a generalized least squares model, using panel data from 52 African 
countries for the period 1995-2014.
FINDINGS: The estimation shows that while increases in health care spending 
contributed to life expectancy gains, urbanization rates and improved water 
access were the major drivers of life expectancy gains with substantially larger 
impacts in the past two decades.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the results provide an evidence base for iterating the 
need to prioritize increasing funding and examine more critically how to improve 
the efficiency of health spending. It also illustrates potential gains that can 
be achieved from an inclusive health policy agenda with a broader range of 
social and economic development issues.

Emerging drugs for essential thrombocythemia.

Masarova L(1), Verstovsek S(1).

Author information:
(1)a MD Anderson Cancer Center , The University of Texas , Houston , TX , USA.

Introduction: Despite our recent progress in the understanding of essential 
thrombocythemia (ET) pathogenesis, the therapeutic management of this disease 
has remained largely unchanged in the past decades. Treatment has mostly focused 
on decreasing the risk of complications, especially prevention of thrombotic or 
hemorrhagic events. Areas covered: Over recent years, the treatment options of 
ET have been expanding with some novel agents on the horizon. The classes of 
agents described in this review include targeted and immunomodulatory agents, 
such as JAK1/2 inhibitors, interferon-α, histone deacetylase inhibitors, 
telomerase inhibitors and human double minute 2 inhibitors. These compounds 
entered various stages of development, albeit the only portion of them is 
currently actively undergoing evaluation in clinical trials. In this review, we 
look at the current therapies and discuss novel agents available in the 
management of ET. Expert opinion: The drug development in ET possesses several 
challenges stemming from its relatively benign and prolonged disease course. 
Therapy focused on reducing the risk of thrombotic and hemorrhagic complications 
and symptom management needs to be chosen wisely as a vast majority of these 
patients have a near-normal life expectancy. To date, no therapy has shown 
effective and definitive alteration of the disease behavior. Although novel 
agents are in development and hopefully some of them will extend treatment 
armamentarium of ET, their exact role remains to be determined.

Integrated estimation of the demographic situation in ukraine - forecast for the 
future.

Chornenka ZA(1), Domanchuk TI(1).

Author information:
(1)Higher State Educational Establishment of Ukraine «Bukovinian State Medical 
University», Chernivtsi, Ukraine.

OBJECTIVE: Introduction: The demographic situation in the country is largely due 
to the state of the economy and reflects the medical and social conditions of 
the population, which in turn testify to the state of the economy, the health 
care system, education, culture, and other factors. The aim: Analysis and 
comparison of the demographic situation in Ukraine with the EU countries, 
forecast for the future.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Materials and methods: The statistical materials of the 
Center for Medical Statistics of the Ministry of Health of Ukraine 2012-2016 
were processed. A medical-statistical analysis of the system's performance 
indicators for the five components carried out; an assessment of the performance 
of the health system according to the WHO approach with certain modifications 
used.
RESULTS: Review: Having analyzed the statistics of the last years in Ukraine, 
the birth rate in 2017 decreased as compared to 2016, in January-April 2017 
there was a natural decrease in the population, while migration processes in 
Ukraine exceeded immigration beyond its borders. In connection with the 
antiterrorist operation in the east of the country and the beginning of active 
hostilities in the region, the population was significantly reduced to 43 
million people. Life expectancy has also changed, and today the average life 
expectancy in Ukraine is 71 years (66 years are men, 75 are women).
CONCLUSION: Conclusions: It is necessary to concentrate efforts on solving 
current problems - economic birth control, adequate social protection of 
families with children and the elderly, promoting a healthy lifestyle, ensuring 
the availability of quality medical care and education, which in turn will 
ensure an increase in the duration of a full active life.
