INTRODUCTION: The development of wound dressing materials that combine healing 
properties, ability to self-repair the material damages, skin-friendly adhesive 
nature, and competent mechanical properties have surpassing functional 
importance in healthcare. Due to their specificity, hydrogels have been 
recognized as a new gateway in biological materials to treat dysfunctional 
tissues. The design and creation of injectable hydrogel-based scaffolds have 
extensively progressed in recent years to improve their therapeutic efficacy and 
to pave the way for their easy minimally invasive administration. Hence, 
injectable hydrogel biomaterials have been prepared to eventually translate into 
minimally invasive therapy and pose a lasting effect on regenerative medicine.
AREAS COVERED: This review highlights the recent development of adhesive and 
injectable hydrogels that have applications in wound healing and wound dressing. 
Such hydrogel materials are not only expected to improve therapeutic outcomes 
but also to facilitate the easy surgical process in both wound healing and 
dressing.
EXPERT OPINION: Wound healing seems to be an appealing approach for treating 
countless life-threatening disorders. With the average increase of life 
expectancy in human societies, an increase in demand for injectable skin 
replacements and drug delivery carriers for chronic wound healing is expected.

BACKGROUND: Chronic pain is a leading cause of disability. Radiofrequency 
denervation (RFD) is effective when performed according to guidelines for 
patients with correctly diagnosed zygapophyseal joint pain (ZJP). However, the 
cost-effectiveness of this method has not been fully explored.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to analyze whether RFD is cost-effective 
for ZJP from a societal perspective.
STUDY DESIGN: Cost effectiveness study based on an observational study.
SETTING: An interventional pain management clinic in central Sweden.
METHODS: Patients - This cost-effectiveness study was performed for all patients 
(n = 873) assessed between 2010 and 2016 at a specialized interventional pain 
clinic in Sweden. Those diagnosed with ZJP (n = 331, 37.9%) were treated with 
RFD and followed up for 1 year after the RFD. Using data collected from national 
registers, we determined the health care costs, medication costs, the patients' 
time and travel costs, and the patients' ability to work. The effects of RFD on 
quality-adjusted life years (QALY) and cost/QALY gained were calculated.
RESULTS: On average, patients reported very low health-related quality of life 
(HRQoL; EQ-5D index: 0.212). After RFD, HRQoL increased significantly to 0.530 
(P < 0.0001). Drug consumption and specialized health care consumption were 
reduced by 54% and 81%, respectively, and the cost/QALY gained from a societal 
perspective was 221,324 Swedish krona (USD ~26,008). The sensitivity analysis 
showed that the treatment was cost-effective in all scenarios evaluated, using 
the patients as their own controls. The cost/QALY gained from a health care 
perspective was 72,749 Swedish krona (USD ~8,548).
LIMITATIONS: The results are based on data collected at one center. The results 
need to be compared with those from pain rehabilitation programs and should be 
confirmed using data from other centers.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients referred for RFD in Sweden report extremely low HRQoL. 
HRQoL significantly increased following RFD in patients with ZJP. Medications 
and health care consumption decreased after RFD. RFD was cost-effective, and the 
sensitivity analysis yielded stable results in different scenarios. Therefore, 
RFD is a cost-effective treatment that meets the Swedish National Board of 
Health and Welfare criteria for a high priority treatment.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01835704) 
with Protocol ID SE-Dnr-2012-446-31M-1.

The aim of any oncological treatment is not just to eliminate the tumour, but to 
maximise patient survival and quality of life. Since the liver has a vital 
function, any radical treatment that severely compromises liver function will 
result in a shortening of life expectancy, rather than a prolongation. 
Furthermore, even non-severe liver damage may prevent the delivery of further 
effective therapies. This is particularly important in the case of 
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), as it is associated with underlying cirrhosis in 
most patients - cirrhosis itself is not only a potentially lethal disease and 
independent prognostic factor in HCC, but it also makes liver function fragile. 
Accordingly, some information about liver dysfunction is included in most 
staging systems for HCC and can be used to guide the selection of treatments 
that the functional liver reserve can tolerate. Unfortunately, the prediction of 
functional damage to the liver in the case of antitumor treatments is very 
challenging and still suboptimal in any given patient. Moreover, while the 
assessment of functional reserve can now be used to avoid postoperative liver 
failure in the surgical setting, its use has been less well clarified for 
non-surgical therapies, which is of particular relevance today, as several lines 
of effective non-surgical treatments, including systemic therapies, have become 
available. The present article will a) critically review the implications of the 
assessment of liver functional reserve in patients with HCC, b) illustrate the 
available tools to assess liver functional reserve and c) discuss the role of 
functional assessment for each type of non-surgical therapy for HCC.

BACKGROUND: Drug overdose is a leading cause of unintentional death in the 
United States and has contributed significantly to a decline in life expectancy 
during recent years. To combat this health issue, this study aims to identify 
the leading neighborhood-level predictors of drug overdose and develop a model 
to predict areas at the highest risk of drug overdose using geographic 
information systems and machine learning (ML) techniques.
METHOD: Neighborhood-level (block group) predictors were grouped into three 
domains: socio-demographic factors, drug use variables, and protective 
resources. We explored different ML algorithms, accounting for spatial 
dependency, to identify leading predictors in each domain. Using geographically 
weighted regression and the best-performing ML algorithm, we combined the output 
prediction of three domains to produce a final ensemble model. The model 
performance was validated using classification evaluation metrics, spatial 
cross-validation, and spatial autocorrelation testing.
RESULTS: The variables contributing most to the predictive model included the 
proportion of households with food stamps, households with an annual income 
below $35,000, opioid prescription rate, smoking accessories expenditures, and 
accessibility to opioid treatment programs and hospitals. Compared to the error 
estimated from normal cross-validation, the generalized error of the model did 
not increase considerably in spatial cross-validation. The ensemble model using 
ML outperformed the GWR method.
CONCLUSION: This study identified strong neighborhood-level predictors that 
place a community at risk of experiencing drug overdoses, as well as protective 
factors. Our findings may shed light on several specific avenues for targeted 
intervention in neighborhoods at risk for high drug overdose burdens.

BACKGROUND: The types of outcomes measured collected in clinical studies and 
those required for cost-effectiveness analysis often differ. Decision makers 
routinely use quality adjusted life years (QALYs) to compare the benefits and 
costs of treatments across different diseases and treatments using a common 
metric. QALYs can be calculated using preference-based measures (PBMs) such as 
EQ-5D-3L, but clinical studies often focus on objective clinician or laboratory 
measured outcomes and non-preference-based patient outcomes, such as QLQ-C30. We 
model the relationship between the generic, preference-based EQ-5D-3L and the 
cancer specific quality of life questionnaire, QLQ-C30 in patients with breast 
cancer. This will result in a mapping that allows users to convert QLQ-C30 
scores into EQ-5D-3L scores for the purposes of cost-effectiveness analysis or 
economic evaluation.
METHODS: We use data from a randomized trial of 602 patients with HER2-positive 
advanced breast cancer provided 3766 EQ-5D-3L observations. Direct mapping using 
adjusted, limited dependent variable mixture models (ALDVMM) is compared to a 
random effects linear regression and indirect mapping using seemingly unrelated 
ordered probit models. EQ-5D-3L was estimated as a function of the summary 
scales of the QLQ-C30 and other patient characteristics.
RESULTS: A four component mixture model outperformed other models in terms of 
summary fit statistics. A close fit to the observed data was observed across the 
range of disease severity. Simulated data from the model closely aligned to the 
original data and showed that mapping did not significantly underestimate 
uncertainty. In the simulated data, 22.15% were equal to 1 compared to 21.93% in 
the original data. Variance was 0.0628 in the simulated data versus 0.0693 in 
the original data. The preferred mapping is provided in Excel and Stata files 
for the ease of users.
CONCLUSION: A four component adjusted mixture model provides reliable, 
non-biased estimates of EQ-5D-3L from the QLQ-C30, to link clinical studies to 
economic evaluation of health technologies for breast cancer. This work adds to 
a growing body of literature demonstrating the appropriateness of mixture model 
based approaches in mapping.

The application of the QALY measure in the assessment of the effects of health 
interventions on an older population: a systematic scoping review.

BACKGROUND: One of the most commonly used types of evaluation methods is 
cost-utility analysis (CUA), using the Quality Adjusted Life Year (QALY) 
indicator as a preference-based measure for assessing effects of a given 
programme. Such assessments are often translated into health-care provision 
priorities; therefore, effectively choosing the method of outcome evaluation is 
crucial for ensuring the best possible allocation of scarce resources. The main 
objective of this scoping review is to identify what kinds of problems and 
limitations may occur when the QALY indicator is used to assess the effects of 
health interventions in the older population.
METHODS: To identify literature in a scoping review, the databases MEDLINE via 
PubMed and Scopus were searched. A manual search on relevant organizations' and 
associations' websites was also conducted (EUnetHTA, ISPOR and national 
governmental agencies responsible for allocation decisions). No limits 
concerning publication dates were set. All relevant data were extracted and 
analyzed, then a narrative summary was prepared.
RESULTS: The database search identified 10,832 relevant items, finally 32 
studies were included in the analysis. The main types of issues indicated in the 
studies were as follows: (1) lower life expectancy in the older population 
causes lower QALY gains; (2) an equal value of one QALY is used regardless of 
age; (3) poorer average health state causes lower QALY gains; (4) inadequate 
instruments to measure quality of life (QoL); (5) attributes of QoL used 
regardless of age; and (6) no beyond-health QoL aspects taken into account.
CONCLUSIONS: This review shows clearly that many problems of different types are 
connected with using QALY for the older population, but there is no consensus as 
to whether QALY discriminates against the older population or not - an opinion 
regarding this issue depends strongly on accepted principles, particularly the 
approach to equity and how one understands fairness. Health care resources 
should not be allocated solely on the basis of the health maximization rule 
because this can lead to discrimination against certain groups (e.g., older, 
disabled, and/or chronically ill people). To maintain the balance between 
efficiency and equity, the issues connected with age-based rationing should be 
widely discussed.

In the United States, acute low back pain, with or without radiculopathy, is the 
leading cause of years lived with disability and the third ranking cause of 
disability-adjusted life-years. Uncomplicated acute low back pain and/or 
radiculopathy is a benign, self-limited condition that does not warrant any 
imaging studies. Imaging is considered in those patients who have had up to 6 
weeks of medical management and physical therapy that resulted in little or no 
improvement in their back pain. It is also considered for those patients 
presenting with red flags, raising suspicion for a serious underlying condition, 
such as cauda equina syndrome, malignancy, fracture, or infection. The American 
College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for 
specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary 
expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive 
analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the 
application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method 
and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) 
to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific 
clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, 
expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or 
treatment.

The world population is aging due to increasing life expectancy. The rate of 
drug use increases, and inappropriate prescribing is frequently encountered with 
advancing age. In addition, misuse and abuse of prescription drugs is a serious 
problem in older adults. It is challenging to detect substance and drug abuse in 
older patients because it may have fewer consequences in social, legal, and 
occupational fields. However, there is not enough information about the 
screening, evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment of abuse. Therefore, the 
awareness of health care professionals and others involved in older patients' 
care should be raised about the misuse and abuse of drugs.

This document is a focused update to the 2017 colorectal cancer (CRC) screening 
recommendations from the U.S. Multi-Society Task Force on Colorectal Cancer, 
which represents the American College of Gastroenterology, the American 
Gastroenterological Association, and the American Society for Gastrointestinal 
Endoscopy. This update is restricted to addressing the age to start and stop CRC 
screening in average-risk individuals and the recommended screening modalities. 
Although there is no literature demonstrating that CRC screening in individuals 
under age 50 improves health outcomes such as CRC incidence or CRC-related 
mortality, sufficient data support the U.S. Multi-Society Task Force to suggest 
average-risk CRC screening begin at age 45. This recommendation is based on the 
increasing disease burden among individuals under age 50, emerging data that the 
prevalence of advanced colorectal neoplasia in individuals ages 45 to 49 
approaches rates in individuals 50 to 59, and modeling studies that demonstrate 
the benefits of screening outweigh the potential harms and costs. For 
individuals ages 76 to 85, the decision to start or continue screening should be 
individualized and based on prior screening history, life expectancy, CRC risk, 
and personal preference. Screening is not recommended after age 85.

This document is a focused update to the 2017 colorectal cancer (CRC) screening 
recommendations from the U.S. Multi-Society Task Force on Colorectal Cancer, 
which represents the American College of Gastroenterology, the American 
Gastroenterological Association, and the American Society for Gastrointestinal 
Endoscopy. This update is restricted to addressing the age to start and stop CRC 
screening in average-risk individuals and the recommended screening modalities. 
Although there is no literature demonstrating that CRC screening in individuals 
under age 50 improves health outcomes such as CRC incidence or CRC-related 
mortality, sufficient data support the U.S. Multi-Society Task Force to suggest 
average-risk CRC screening begin at age 45. This recommendation is based on the 
increasing disease burden among individuals under age 50, emerging data that the 
prevalence of advanced colorectal neoplasia in individuals ages 45 to 49 
approaches rates in individuals 50 to 59, and modeling studies that demonstrate 
the benefits of screening outweigh the potential harms and costs. For 
individuals ages 76 to 85, the decision to start or continue screening should be 
individualized and based on prior screening history, life expectancy, CRC risk, 
and personal preference. Screening is not recommended after age 85.

One serious pandemic can nullify years of efforts to extend life expectancy and 
reduce disability. The coronavirus pandemic has been a perturbing factor that 
has provided an opportunity to assess not only the effectiveness of health 
systems for cardio-vascular diseases (CVD), but also their sustainability. The 
goal of our research is to analyze the influence of public health factors on the 
mortality from circulatory diseases using machine learning methods. We analysed 
a very large dataset that consisted of the information collected from the 
national registers in Russia. We included data from 2015 to 2021. It included 
340 factors that characterize organization of healthcare in Russia. The 
resulting area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC of ROC) of the 
Random Forest based regression model was 92% with a testing dataset. The models 
allow for automated retraining as time passes and epidemiological and other 
situations change. They also allow additional characteristics of regions and 
health care organizations to be added to existing training datasets depending on 
the target. The developed models allow the calculation of the probability of the 
target for 6-12 months with an error of 8%. Moreover, the models allow to 
calculate scenarios and the value of the target indicator when other indicators 
of the region change.

Reports of multiple cancer cases are increasing with the improvement of 
diagnostic techniques and the extension of life expectancy. In addition, the 
increase in the prevalence of multiple cancers is expected because the increase 
in the prevalence of juvenile breast cancer has been a concern in recent years. 
Particularly, in the case of simultaneity, the problem is how much treatment 
priority and curability should be sought depending on the stage and prognosis of 
each tumor. We report a case of malignant lymphoma and colon cancer that 
occurred during breast cancer treatment.

countries.

Air pollution is the fourth greatest overall risk factor for human health. 
Despite declining levels in Europe, air pollution still represents a major 
health and economic burden. We collected data from the Global Burden of Disease 
Study 2019 regarding overall, as well as ischemic heart disease (IHD), stroke, 
and tracheal, bronchus and lung cancer-specific disability adjusted life years 
(DALYs), years of life lost (YLL) and mortality attributable to air pollution 
for 43 European countries between 1990 and 2019. Concentrations of ambient 
particulate matter (aPM2.5), ozone, and household air pollution from solid fuels 
were obtained from State of Global Air 2020. We analysed changes in air 
pollution parameters, as well as DALYs, YLL, and mortality related to air 
pollution, also taking into account gross national income (GNI) and 
socio-demographic index (SDI). Using a novel calculation, aPM2.5 ratio (PMR) 
change and DALY rate ratio (DARR) change were used to assess each country's 
ability to decrease its aPM2.5 pollution and DALYs to at least the extent of the 
European median decrease within the analysed period. Finally, we created a 
multiple regression model for reliably predicting YLL using aPM2.5 and household 
air pollution. The average annual population-weighted aPM2.5 exposure in Europe 
in 1990 was 20.8 μg/m3 (95% confidence interval (CI) 18.3-23.2), while in 2019 
it was 33.7% lower at 13.8 μg/m3 (95% CI 12.0-15.6). There were in total 368 006 
estimated deaths in Europe in 2019 attributable to air pollution, a 42.4% 
decrease compared to 639 052 in 1990. The majority (90.4%) of all deaths were 
associated with aPM2.5. IHD was the primary cause of death making up 44.6% of 
all deaths attributable to air pollution. The age-standardised DALY rate and YLL 
rate attributable to air pollution were more than 60% lower in 2019 compared to 
1990. There was a strong positive correlation (r = 0.911) between YLL rate and 
aPM2.5 pollution in 2019 in Europe. Our multiple regression model predicts that 
for 10% increase in aPM2.5, YLL increases by 16.7%. Furthermore, 26 of 43 
European countries had a positive DARR change. 31 of 43 European countries had a 
negative PMR change, thus not keeping up with the European median aPM2.5 
concentration decrease. When categorising countries by SDI and GNI, countries in 
the higher brackets had significantly lower aPM2.5 concentration and DALY rate 
for IHD and stroke. Overall, air pollution levels, air pollution-related 
morbidity and mortality have decreased considerably in Europe in the last three 
decades. However, with the growing European population, air pollution remains an 
important public health and economic issue. Policies targeting air pollution 
reduction should continue to be strongly enforced to further reduce one of the 
greatest risk factors for human health.

The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, has taken a 
catastrophic toll on society, health-care systems and the economy. Notably, 
COVID-19 has been shown to be associated with a higher mortality rate in men 
than in women. This disparity is likely to be a consequence of a failure to 
invest in men's health, as it has also been established that men have a lower 
life expectancy and poorer outcomes from non-communicable diseases than women. A 
variety of biological, social and economic factors have contributed to the sex 
disparities in mortality from COVID-19. A streamlined men's health programme - 
with the urologist as the gatekeeper of men's health - is needed to help prevent 
future tragedies of this nature.

Background: We analyzed the predictive value of the tap test (TT) on the outcome 
of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunting in patients with idiopathic normal 
pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) and cognitive impairment up to 12 months 
postoperatively. Methods: We analyzed the data of two prospective multicenter 
studies on ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS) and lumboperitoneal shunt (LPS) use 
in iNPH patients. We selected patients with Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) 
scores ≤ 26 points as study subjects. We used a multivariate logistic regression 
model to obtain the optimal threshold of MMSE scores after TT to predict the 
score improvement at 12 months following shunting and that helped to control for 
confounding factors such as age and MMSE scores before TT. We used logistic 
regression models to identify variables with age-adjusted odds ratio (A-OR) and 
multivariate-adjusted OR (M-OR). Results: For an improvement of ≥3 points in the 
MMSE score cutoff 7 days following TT in VPS and LPS cohort studies, the MMSE 
scores improved by 6 points after 12 months. The VPS cohort had sensitivity, 
specificity, and area under the curve (AUC) of 69.2, 73.7, and 0.771%, 
respectively; however, for the LPS cohort, they were 86.2, 90.9, and 0.906%, 
respectively. For MMSE scores that improved by ≥3 points in patients after the 
TT, the possibility of an improvement by 6 points at 12 months following CSF 
shunt had A-OR 7.77 and M-OR 6.3 times for the VPS, and A-OR 62.3 and M-OR 59.6 
times for the LPS cohort. Conclusion: CSF shunting contributes to improved 
cognitive function in iNPH patients. Furthermore, MMSE score evaluation at the 
TT can sensitively predict improvement in postoperative MMSE scores following 
LPS intervention. Clinical Trial Registration: SINPHONI-1 (ClinicalTrials.gov,

Multivariate risk preferences in the quality-adjusted life year model.

The interest in multivariate and higher-order risk preferences has increased. A 
growing body of literature has demonstrated the relevance and impact of these 
preferences, but for health the evidence is lacking. We measure multivariate and 
higher-order risk preferences for quality of life (QoL) and longevity, the two 
attributes of the Quality-Adjusted Life Year (QALY) model. We observe 
preferences for a positive correlation between these attributes and for pooling 
together a fixed loss in one of the attributes and a mean-zero risk in the 
other, and for pooling together mean-zero risks in QoL and longevity. The 
findings indicate that higher-order risk preferences are stronger for health 
than for money. Furthermore, we test if preferences for a risky treatment for a 
disease affecting only QoL, depend on life expectancy. We find no such a 
relation, but there is a positive relation between riskiness of a comorbidity 
affecting life expectancy and risk aversion for a QoL treatment. We therefore 
observe no definitive deviation from the QALY model, although the model is more 
robust when expected longevity is high. Our findings suggest that the current 
practice of cost-effectiveness analysis should be generalized to account for 
risk aversion in QoL and longevity, and higher-order preferences.

[Excess mortality in the Lolland-Falster region in Denmark is associated with 
migration].

[Article in Danish]

Lynge E(1), Holmager TL.

Author information:
(1)elsebeth@sund.ku.dk.

At present, Lolland-Falster, a provincial-rural area in south-eastern Denmark, 
has the lowest life expectancy nationwide; about 78.6 years. This review 
summarises the development in mortality in this region. Mortality data from 1968 
to 2017 showed this to be a new phenomenon. Until 1990, mortality in 
Lolland-Falster resembled the of Denmark as a whole. In the period 2013-2017, 
however, men in Lolland-Falster had a 15-25% excess mortality. In-migration 
contributed substantially to this development, since in-migrating people of 
working age in 2008-2017 had a 134% excess mortality. Prevention of excess 
mortality in Lolland-Falster requires a national effort.

Coronary artery cannulation after transcatheter aortic valve implantation.

Valvo R(1), Costa G, Tamburino C, Barbanti M.

(1)Division of Cardiology, A.O.U. Policlinico "G. Rodolico-San Marco", Catania, 
Italy.

Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has revolutionised the treatment 
of severe, symptomatic aortic stenosis and it is now a proven and effective 
alternative to surgery for patients regardless of preoperative risk 
stratification. Nevertheless, the consequent expansion towards younger patients 
with longer life expectancy focuses attention on long-term considerations. In 
particular, although the prevalence of coronary artery disease has been shown to 
decrease with the lowering of estimated risk stratification, the chance of 
requirement of future coronary interventions after TAVI increases dramatically 
as a function of patients' life expectancy. To date, however, only a few studies 
have investigated the feasibility and reproducibility of coronary artery 
cannulation after TAVI. Different conditions related mainly to aortic root 
anatomy and specific transcatheter aortic valve (TAV) designs and deployment 
have been associated with impaired coronary access after TAVI. In the present 
review, we will examine the conditions that may make coronary access after TAVI 
more challenging or even impossible.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Follicular lymphoma is an indolent lymphoma which does not 
limit life expectancy in most patients; however, approximately 20% of patients 
will experience progression of disease within 24 months (POD24) of diagnosis and 
have inferior survival outcomes. To date, no clinical, genetic, or tumor 
microenvironment prediction models have been able to definitively predict which 
patients will experience POD24 which limits the ability to alter frontline 
management of patients suspected to be at high risk of early progression. Here, 
we review recent literature regarding novel prediction models and management 
recommendations for POD24 patients.
RECENT FINDINGS: Recent studies have revealed novel clinicopathologic prediction 
models which may be closer to identifying patients at risk of POD24. In 
addition, several clinical trials utilizing novel therapies such as 
tazemetostat, obinutuzumab, PI3K inhibitors, and lenalidomide have been 
performed which help further guide treatment. Ongoing trials seek to identify 
the optimal management of these patients, and data from bispecific antibodies 
and CAR T cell therapies is forthcoming. With ongoing research efforts, hope 
remains that we are closer to being able to predict which patients will 
experience early progressing follicular lymphoma and have an improved management 
plan for those who do in order to improve survival outcomes.

Membrane biofouling in water purification plants is a serious issue of worldwide 
concern. Various chemical, physical, and biochemical processes are practised for 
membrane clean-up. A high-dosage treatment adversely affects the life expectancy 
of the membrane, and minimum dosage seems unable to deteriorate the biofilms on 
the membrane. It is reported that quorum quenchers like nitric oxide (NO) 
disrupt biofilm signals through metabolic rewiring, and also NO is known to be 
secreted by probiotics (good bacteria). In the present review, it is 
hypothesized that if probiotic biofilms secreting NO are used, other microbes 
that aggregate on the filtration membrane could be mitigated. The concept of 
probiotic administration on filtration membrane seeks to be encouraged because 
probiotic bacteria will not be hazardous, even if released during filtration. 
The fundamental motive to present probiotics as a resource for sequestering NO 
may serve as multifunctional bioweapons for membrane remediation, which will 
virtually guarantee their long-term sustainability and green approach.
