population of sand lizards (Lacerta agilis) showing signs of inbreeding 
depression to assess the effects of genetic relatedness on pair formation in the 
wild. Parental pairs were less similar at the MHC than expected under random 
mating but mated at random with respect to microsatellite relatedness. MHC 
clustered in groups of RFLP bands but no partner preference was observed with 
respect to partner MHC cluster genotype. Male MHC band patterns were unrelated 
to their fertilization success in clutches selected for analysis on the basis of 
showing mixed paternity. Thus, our data suggest that MHC plays a role in 
pre-copulatory, but not post-copulatory partner association, suggesting that MHC 
is not the driver of fertilization bias and gamete recognition in sand lizards.

Epidemiological transition in India shows a shift in disease burden from youth 
to the elderly. As Life Expectancy increases, a greater burden is placed on the 
state, society, and families in India. Mental health disorders are insidious, 
debilitating Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) that afflict people, their 
families, and generations down the line. Globally, depression is the leading 
cause of mental health-related disability. It is estimated that mental illness 
contributes to 4.7% of Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) in India. It is 
predicted that by 2026, the elderly's sex ratio will increase to 1,060 
feminizing ageing. Research has shown that elderly women in developed countries 
like the United States are more prone to depression. Chronic morbidities are 
more common in women than in men, and they may suffer from poor vision, 
depression, impaired physical performance, and elder abuse. Mostly widowed, 
economically dependent, lacking proper food and clothing, fearing the future, 
and lacking proper care, they have difficulty coping with these health problems. 
There are surprisingly few studies on elderly female depression. Therefore, we 
want to hypothesize the prevalence of depression among women in different 
regions and demographic groups in India, and what factors may contribute to 
these differences. Using intersectional analysis with the data from Wave 1 
(2017-2018) of the (Longitudinal Ageing Study in India) LASI (N = 16,737) we 
were able to explore the intersecting patterns between different variables and 
how people are positioned simultaneously and position themselves in different 
multiple categories based on the type of place of residence, age and level of 
education. Through the study we further aim to determine the prevalence of 
depression among elderly female in the age group of 60 in different states using 
the Chloropleth map. The findings of the study highlight the significance of the 
place of residence in the development of depression among elderly women, with 
the rural area being associated with a higher prevalence of depression compared 
to urban area. When compared to people with higher literacy, those with low 
literacy were significantly associated with depression. State-wise, there is a 
huge difference between the prevalence of elderly women depression in rural and 
urban areas. The study highlights the vulnerability of elderly women to 
depression. It is possible for the government to develop programs that address 
the needs of elderly women, both in urban and rural areas, to reduce depression. 
Multi-factor approaches to mental health, which consider age, literacy, and 
location, are essential. Programs targeting specific populations can be 
developed to address depression's root causes..

Overestimation of anticoagulant benefit in patients with atrial fibrillation and 
low life expectancy: evidence from 12 randomized trials.

Shah SJ, van Walraven C, Jeon SY, Boscardin WJ, Hobbs FR, Connolly S, Ezekowitz 
M, Covinsky KE, Fang MC, Singer DE.

BACKGROUND: Patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) have a high rate of all-cause 
mortality that is only partially attributable to vascular outcomes. While the 
competing risk of death may affect expected anticoagulant benefit, guidelines do 
not account for it. We sought to determine if using a competing risks framework 
materially affects the guideline-endorsed estimate of absolute risk reduction 
attributable to anticoagulants.
METHODS: We conducted a secondary analysis of 12 RCTs that randomized patients 
with AF to oral anticoagulants or either placebo or antiplatelets. For each 
participant, we estimated the absolute risk reduction (ARR) of anticoagulants to 
prevent stroke or systemic embolism using two methods. First, we estimated the 
ARR using a guideline-endorsed model (CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc) and then again using a 
Competing Risk Model that uses the same inputs as CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc but accounts 
for the competing risk of death and allows for non-linear growth in benefit over 
time. We compared the absolute and relative differences in estimated benefit and 
whether the differences in estimated benefit varied by life expectancy.
RESULTS: 7933 participants had a median life expectancy of 8 years (IQR 6, 12), 
determined by comorbidity-adjusted life tables. 43% were randomized to oral 
anticoagulation (median age 73 years, 36% women). The guideline-endorsed CHA 2 
DS 2 -VASc model estimated a larger ARR than the Competing Risk Model (median 
ARR at 3 years, 6.9% vs. 5.2%). ARR differences varied by life expectancies: for 
those with life expectancies in the highest decile, 3-year ARR difference (CHA 2 
DS 2 -VASc model - Competing Risk Model 3-year risk) was -1.2% (42% relative 
underestimation); for those with life expectancies in the lowest decile, 3-year 
ARR difference was 5.9% (91% relative overestimation).
CONCLUSION: Anticoagulants were exceptionally effective at reduced stroke risk. 
However, anticoagulant benefits were misestimated with CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc, which 
does not account for the competing risk of death nor decelerating treatment 
benefit over time. Overestimation was most pronounced in patients with the 
lowest life expectancy and when benefit was estimated over a multi-year horizon.

We describe a case of limb myorhythmia successfully palliated with botulinum 
toxin injections. The patient is a 30-year-old male evaluated for abnormal 
movements of the left lower foot that began after an ankle injury for which the 
patient underwent Achilles tendon scar tissue debridement without improvement. 
On examination, he had near-constant involuntary, slow, rhythmic 
flexion/extension tremor of toes 2-4 that was diminished during active movement. 
Needle electromyography (EMG) revealed a rhythmic, 2-3 Hz tremor isolated to the 
flexor digitorum brevis. After failure of medical management with muscle 
relaxants, gabapentin, and levodopa trials, the patient underwent two EMG-guided 
chemodenervation procedures with incobotulinum toxin A injections of the left 
flexor digitorum brevis. At 3-month follow-up, he had achieved a sustained 50% 
reduction in the intensity of the movements and improved quality of life. 
Myorhythmia is a rare condition characterized by a repetitive, rhythmic, slow 
frequency (1-4 Hz) movement affecting the cranial and limb muscles. The most 
common causes include stroke, demyelinating disorders, drug or toxin intake, 
trauma, and infections. The management of this condition is very limited with 
pharmacologic agents such as anticholinergics, antispasmodics, anticonvulsants, 
or dopaminergic agents showing limited efficacy. The use of botulinum toxin 
chemodenervation aided by EMG muscle targeting can be a useful therapeutic 
intervention in cases of medication-refractory regionally distributed 
myorhythmia involving accessible muscles.

With increasing knowledge and improvements in options for glycemic control, the 
life-expectancy of patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) has increased 
considerably over the past decades. Whereas this is undeniably positive for 
patients, aging is related to natural decline in cognitive functions. As 
patients with T1DM across the life-span are susceptible to cognitive 
deterioration, an interaction with aging may be expected and the risk of 
development of dementia might be increased. As achieving glycemic control 
depends on a set of diabetes self-management behaviors, it is imperative to 
understand how cognitive functions are involved in the upkeep of these behaviors 
and how cognitive impairment may affect them. In this narrative review, we set 
out to understand the relationship between cognition and T1DM self-care by first 
reviewing the glycemic targets in older adults, what treatment options are 
available, and what cognitive functions they draw upon. We will then review the 
cognitive literature in older adults that is available and then link both 
together. Lastly, we finish with clinical recommendations and suggestions for 
future research.

Given change in the universal developmental agenda and the quality of governance 
in the last two decades, this paper re-examines the relationship between 
governance, health expenditure and maternal mortality using panel data for 184 
countries from 1996 to 2019. By employing the 'dynamic panel data regression 
model', the study reveals that a one-point improvement in the governance index 
decreases maternal mortality by 10-21%. We also find that good governance can 
better translate health expenditure into improved maternal health outcomes 
through effective allocation and equitable distribution of available resources. 
These results are robust to alternative instruments, alternative dependent 
variables (such as infant mortality rate and life expectancy), estimation by 
different governance dimensions and at the sub-national level. Additional 
findings using 'Quantile regression' estimates show that the quality of 
governance matters more than the health expenditure in countries with a higher 
level of maternal mortality. While the 'Path regression' analysis exhibits the 
specific direct and indirect mechanisms through which the causal inference 
operates between governance and maternal mortality.

Familial adult myoclonus epilepsy (FAME) is an autosomal dominant condition 
characterized by the association of myoclonic tremor and epilepsy mainly with 
onset in adulthood. The clinical course is non-progressive or slowly 
progressive, as epilepsy is commonly controlled with appropriate antiseizure 
medication and individuals have a normal life expectancy. However, the myoclonus 
severity increases with age and leads to some degree of disability in the 
elderly. Because the non-coding repeat expansions responsible for FAME are not 
detected by routine genetic tests being used at this time, a clinical diagnosis 
accompanied by neurophysiological testing remains essential to guide the 
geneticist on the selection of the specific genetic technique.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia and 
this progressive neurological disorder is associated with substantial mortality 
and morbidity. We aimed to report the burden of AD and other types of dementia 
in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, by age, sex and 
sociodemographic index (SDI), for the period 1990-2019.
METHODS: publicly accessible data on the prevalence, death and 
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) because of AD, and other types of 
dementia, were retrieved from the global burden of disease 2019 project for all 
MENA countries from 1990 to 2019.
RESULTS: in 2019, the age-standardised point prevalence of dementia was 777.6 
per 100,000 populations in MENA, which was 3.0% higher than in 1990. The 
age-standardised death and DALY rates of dementia were 25.5 and 387.0 per 
100,000, respectively. In 2019, the highest DALY rate was observed in 
Afghanistan and the lowest rate was in Egypt. That same year, the 
age-standardised point prevalence, death and DALY rates increased with advancing 
age and were higher for females of all age groups. From 1990 to 2019, the DALY 
rate of dementia decreased with increasing SDI up to 0.4, then slightly 
increased up to an SDI of 0.75, followed by a decrease for the remaining SDI 
levels.
CONCLUSIONS: the point prevalence of AD and other types of dementia has 
increased over the past three decades, and in 2019, the corresponding regional 
burden was higher than the global average.

Gendered life courses and cognitive functioning in later life: the role of 
context-specific gender norms and lifetime employment.

With increasing life expectancy, dementia poses an epidemiological challenge. As 
a cure has not been developed, the investigation into preventive factors becomes 
pivotal. Previous research emphasizes the cognitively stimulating and 
socio-emotional benefits of lifetime employment, but research on heterogeneous 
patterns across social groups and societal contexts remains sparse. Sociological 
approaches have a promising potential to provide insights into health 
inequalities and can contribute to the study of this major societal challenge. 
We investigate the influence of previous employment biographies on cognitive 
functioning for men and women aged 50 to 75 in 19 European countries, using 
longitudinal and retrospective information from the Survey of Health, Ageing and 
Retirement in Europe. We link individual information on employment biographies 
and cognitive functioning to contextual measures of gender norms, using 
aggregated agreement rates to both men's and women's role in employment and 
family. We find that previous employment affects cognitive functioning men and 
women differently. Part-time employment is beneficial for women's cognitive 
functioning, but not for men's. Traditional gender norms are associated with 
lower levels of cognitive functioning for both genders and moderate the linkage 
between previous employment and cognitive functioning. In contexts with more 
traditional gender norms, men's part-time employment is associated with lower 
and women's part-time employment with higher cognitive functioning. We conclude 
that employment and non-employment participation can, depending on 
characteristics of individuals and contexts, benefit or hinder the life-course 
accumulation of cognitive reserve, and those with norm-deviating behaviour are 
disadvantaged.

Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are beneficial bacteria for humans and animals. 
However, the characteristics and functions of LAB in insects remain unclear. 
Here, we isolated LAB from the gut of Riptortus pedestris, a pest that is a 
significant problem in soybean cultivation in Korea, and identified two 
Lactococcus lactis and one Enterococcus faecalis using matrix-associated laser 
desorption/ionization-time of flight and 16S rRNA analyses. All three LAB 
strains survived at pH 8, and L. lactis B103 and E. faecalis B105 survived at pH 
9 for 24 h. In addition, these strains survived well in simulated gastric juice 
of humans containing pepsin and exhibited high resistance to bile salts. Two 
strains of L. lactis and one of E. faecalis maintained constant density (> 104 
colony-forming units [CFU]/mL) at pH 2.5, but viability at pH 2.2 was 
strain-dependent. The three LAB were reinoculated into second-instar nymphs of 
R. pedestris and colonized well, reaching a constant density (> 105 CFU/gut) in 
the adult insect gut. Interestingly, feeding of these LAB increased the survival 
rate of insects compared to the negative control, with the largest increase seen 
for L. lactis B103. However, the LAB did not increase the weight or length of 
adult insects. These results indicate that insect-derived LAB possess the traits 
required for survival under gastrointestinal conditions and have beneficial 
effects on insect hosts. The LAB infection frequency of the wild bean bug 
populations was 89% (n = 18) in Gyeongsangnam-do, South Korea. These LAB can be 
utilized as a novel probiotic in the cultivation of beneficial insects. This 
study provides fundamental information about the symbiosis between insects and 
LAB, and a novel concept for pest control.

BACKGROUND: There is few of optimal management guideline in elderly patients 
with renal cell carcinoma (RCC). To compare the survival outcomes of 
octogenarian RCC group and younger RCC group after surgery using nationwide 
multi-institutional database.
METHODS: A total of 10,068 patients who underwent surgery for RCC were included 
in the current retrospective, multi-institutional study. A propensity score 
matching (PSM) analysis was conducted to control other confounding factors in 
analyzing survival outcomes of octogenarian and younger group RCCs. Kaplan-Meier 
curve analysis to calculate the survival estimates for cancer-specific survival 
(CSS) and overall survival (OS), and multivariate Cox-proportional hazard 
regression analyses to evaluate the significant variables associated with the 
survival outcomes were also performed.
RESULTS: Both groups were well-balanced in all baseline characteristics. In a 
total cohort, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed a significantly decreased 
5-year and 8-year CSS and OS in the octogenarian group compared with the younger 
group. However, in a PSM cohort, no significant differences were evident between 
the two groups in terms of CSS (5-year, 87.3% vs. 87.0%; 8-year, 82.2% vs. 
78.9%, respectively, log-rank test, p = 0.964). In addition, age ≥ 80 years (HR, 
1.199; 95% CI, 0.497-2.896, p = 0.686) was not a significant prognostic factor 
of CSS in a PSM cohort.
CONCLUSIONS: The octogenarian RCC group after surgery had comparable survival 
outcomes compared with younger group after PSM analysis. For the life expectancy 
of octogenarian is getting longer, active treatment is considerable in patients 
with good performance status.

BACKGROUND: The majority of women diagnosed with breast cancer are at low risk 
of developing contralateral breast cancer; however, increasing numbers of women 
are choosing to have the cancer-free breast removed (contralateral prophylactic 
mastectomy [CPM]) in addition to the affected breast. The objective of the study 
was to examine the survival and psychosocial outcomes of women with unilateral 
breast cancer having CPM vs those not having CPM. The specific aims were to (1) 
prospectively examine the psychosocial outcomes of women with sporadic breast 
cancer having CPM vs those not having CPM, and (2) conduct a decision model to 
provide estimates of the effect of CPM on survival outcomes.
METHODS: For study aim 1, we enrolled 308 women with newly diagnosed breast 
cancer before breast surgery at the MD Anderson Cancer Center and the 
Kelsey-Seybold community clinic between 2012 and 2015. Women completed validated 
questionnaires assessing psychosocial factors including quality of life (QOL), 
body image concerns, cancer worry, cancer distress, and decisional satisfaction 
at time points presurgery and at 1, 6, and 12 months postsurgery. We fitted 
repeated measures models to assess the association between psychosocial scores 
and CPM status, adjusting for time effect. For study aim 2, we developed a 
decision model to simulate the survival outcomes of women who undergo CPM and 
women who do not, considering age, stage, estrogen receptor (ER) status, and 
degree of family history of breast cancer. The results were used to develop an 
online risk-prediction tool.
RESULTS OF STUDY AIM 1: Among 252 women who completed presurgery and postsurgery 
questionnaires, mean age was 56 years (range, 25-82 years), 60% were 
non-Hispanic White, 16% were non-Hispanic Black, 16% were Hispanic, and 8% were 
of mixed race. Seventeen percent had CPM. Women who had CPM tended to be younger 
(P < .01) and Hispanic (P < .01). After adjusting for time effect (presurgery vs 
postsurgery), women who had CPM had higher scores for cancer distress (P = .03), 
body image concerns (P < .01), and QOL (P < .01) than did women who did not 
undergo CPM. There was no statistically significant difference by CPM status for 
decisional satisfaction.
RESULTS OF STUDY AIM 2: The decision model demonstrated that the greatest 
increase in quality-adjusted life expectancy with CPM was women aged 40 with an 
ER-negative, stage I breast cancer and a first-degree relative with breast 
cancer. CPM had no or a reduced effect on quality-adjusted life expectancy among 
women aged 50 or older regardless of stage or family history of breast cancer. 
The maximum 20-year absolute overall survival increase with CPM was 1.21%.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of study aim 1 suggest that psychosocial factors such 
as cancer distress, QOL, and body image concerns do not improve after having 
CPM. The results highlight the importance of evaluating women for these 
psychosocial factors presurgery and postsurgery in order to identify those for 
whom psychosocial assessment and counseling should be recommended. We will 
evaluate in a future study whether the risk prediction tool enhances a woman's 
understanding of the small survival benefit of CPM and whether that influences 
her decision about having CPM.

INTRODUCTION: Chronic kidney disease is estimated to become the fifth leading 
cause of death globally by 2040. Due to the high incidence of fatigue in 
patients with end-stage renal disease without reliable pharmacological 
treatments, more and more studies on non-pharmacological interventions to 
improve physical function appear; which might be the best approach remains 
unknown. This study aimed to compare and rank the efficacy of all known 
non-pharmacological interventions on improving physical function from multiple 
outcomes for adults with end-stage renal disease.
METHODS: This systematic review and network meta-analysis included searches of 
PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, and Cochrane Library from inception to September 1, 
2022, for randomized controlled trials of non-pharmacological interventions to 
improve physical function in adults with end-stage renal disease. Literature 
screening, data extraction, and quality appraisal were performed systematically 
by two independent reviewers. The frequentist random-effect network 
meta-analysis was adopted to pool the evidence from five outcomes, namely, 6-min 
walk test, handgrip strength, knee extension strength, physical component 
summary, and mental component summary, respectively.
RESULTS: A total of 1,921 citations were identified by this search, of which 44 
eligible trials enrolled 2,250 participants, and 16 interventions were 
identified. All subsequent figures refer to comparisons with usual care. For 
increasing walking distance, the combined resistance and aerobic exercise with 
virtual reality or music were the most effective interventions, with a mean 
difference plus 95% confidence interval of 90.69 (8.92-172.46) and 92.59 
(23.13-162.06), respectively. Resistance exercise with blood flow restriction 
(8.13, 0.09-16.17) was the best treatment to improve handgrip strength. Combined 
resistance and aerobic exercise (11.93, 3.63-20.29) and whole-body vibration 
(6.46, 1.71-11.20) were associated with improving knee extension strength. For 
life quality, all treatment effects did not show statistically significant 
differences.
CONCLUSIONS: It was found via network meta-analysis that combined resistance and 
aerobic exercise is the most effective intervention. Besides, if virtual reality 
or music is added to the training, there will be better results. Resistance 
exercise with blood flow restriction and whole-body vibration might be good 
alternative treatments for improving muscle strength. None of the interventions 
improved quality of life, suggesting a need for alternative interventions in 
this regard. The results of this study contribute evidence-based data to 
decision-making.

BACKGROUND: In order to improve the clinical medical technology, enhance the 
clinical effect and improve the disease detection rate, the clinical incidence 
rate of atlantoaxial dislocation and vertebral body malformation that are 
difficult to summarize is increasing year by year.
METHODS: A total of 80 patients with atlantoaxial dislocation deformity treated 
in our hospital from January 2017 to May 2021 are selected for this study. 
According to the number table method, 80 patients are randomly divided into the 
auxiliary group and the traditional group, with 40 cases in each group. The 
traditional group is treated with posterior atlantoaxial pedicle screw system 
internal fixation and intervertebral fusion, and the auxiliary implementation 
and application of a new head and neck fixation and traction device through 
nasal cannula and oral release decompression fixation for posterior fusion. The 
patients in the two groups are compared changes and differences in efficacy, 
spinal cord function index, pain score, surgery, and quality of life.
RESULTS: Compared with the traditional group, the total clinical effective rate, 
cervical spine extension and flexion range of motion, physical function, 
physical function, psychological function, and social function in the auxiliary 
group are significantly improved. The operation time, intraoperative blood loss, 
and VAS score are significantly reduced (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: The new head and neck fixation traction device can improve the 
surgical efficacy and quality of life of patients with irreversible atlantoaxial 
dislocation, enhance spinal cord function, reduce pain symptoms and surgical 
risks, and is worthy of clinical application.

Heart failure is a progressive condition with a high burden of symptoms and 
clinical decompensations that causes psychological and social suffering, poor 
quality of life, and limited life expectancy. Therefore, it requires palliative 
care to control symptoms and signs, but integrating it with clinical care is 
complicated. We aimed to discuss the limits and possibilities of integrating 
palliative care in heart failure. This was a qualitative descriptive study. 
Semi-structured qualitative interviews were carried out between July 2020 and 
July 2021. We applied the thematic content analysis and the SWOT matrix. Ethical 
principles were respected. Ten professionals from an Institute specializing in 
cardiovascular diseases in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, participated in the study, 
including physicians, nurses, psychologist, and occupational therapist. We 
identified 4 categories related to intervening factors: the patient's profile, 
the emotional aspects of professionals facing these patients, the challenges to 
integrating and sustaining palliative care in practice, and the ways for 
assistance planning in this context. The existence of a specialized team, the 
palliative care commission, and the institutional palliative care protocol, 
aligned with the realistic perception of the assistance, organizational, 
political, and social problems, may promote the advancement of palliative care 
in heart failure.

BACKGROUND AND AIM: The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 1.5 
billion and 2.2 billion people have hearing and vision impairment, respectively. 
The burden of these non-communicable diseases is highest in low- and 
middle-income countries due to a lack of services and health professionals. The 
WHO has recommended universal health coverage and integrated service delivery to 
improve ear and eye care services. This scoping review describes the evidence 
for combined hearing and vision screening programs.
METHOD: A keyword search of three electronic databases, namely Scopus, MEDLINE 
(PubMed), and Web of Science, was conducted, resulting in 219 results. After 
removing duplicates and screening based on eligibility criteria, data were 
extracted from 19 included studies. The Joanna Briggs Institute Reviewer Manual 
and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyzes 
(PRISMA) Extension for Scoping Reviews were followed. A narrative synthesis was 
conducted.
RESULTS: Most studies (63.2%) were from high-income countries, with 31.6% from 
middle-income and 5.2% from low-income countries. The majority of studies 
(78.9%) involved children and the four studies reporting on adults all included 
adults above 50 years of age. Vision screening was most commonly performed with 
the "Tumbling E" and "Snellen Chart," while hearing was typically screened using 
pure tone audiometry. Studies reported referral rates as the most common outcome 
with sensitivity and specificity rates not reported in any included articles. 
Reported benefits of combined vision and hearing screenings included earlier 
detection of vision and hearing difficulties to support functioning and quality 
of life as well as resource sharing for reduced costs. Challenges to combined 
screening included ineffective follow-up systems, management of test equipment, 
and monitoring of screening personnel.
CONCLUSIONS: There is limited research evidence for combined hearing and vision 
screening programs. Although potential benefits are demonstrated, especially for 
mHealth-supported programs in communities, more feasibility and implementation 
research are required, particularly in low- and middle-income countries and 
across all age groups. Developing universal, standardized reporting guidelines 
for combined sensory screening programs is recommended to enhance the 
standardization and effectiveness of combined sensory screening programs.

In today's booming society and in the age of science and technology, the 
diversification of food processing methods, the continuous extension of the food 
trade chain, and the potential hazard factors in the food production process all 
make people pay more and more attention to the establishment, development, and 
improvement of the hazard analysis and critical control points (HACCP) system. 
Only terminal control and post-processing supervision of food can guarantee the 
absolute safety of food. In the process of processing, it is particularly 
important to strictly identify and evaluate the food safety hazards. To better 
assist food production enterprises in establishing and implementing HACCP 
systems, to implement the primary responsibility of food safety, and to improve 
the theoretical level and practical application of HACCP system in China, an 
investigation of the current situation and development frontier of HACCP system 
in China was conducted. Based on the core journal database of China Knowledge 
Network, the Chinese Social Science Citation Index database, and the Chinese 
Science Citation Database as the literature search database platform, the study 
used the CiteSpace visual metrics software system to analyze 1,084 pieces of 
literature in the field of HACCP research, in order to track the dynamics and 
impact of research in this field by Chinese research institutions and major 
authors, and analyze the research hotspots in the field. It is important for 
further research on HACCP. The results of the study showed that (1) the number 
of publications in the field of HACCP in China increased steadily from 1992 to 
2004 and then began to decrease; (2) the indexes of journals with more 
publications were more concentrated, and the journal Food Science published the 
most; (3) the indexes of major research institutions showed that the cultivation 
bases of the State Key Laboratory of Chinese Medicinal Materials in the Center 
of Chinese Medicine Resources of the Chinese Academy of Traditional Medicine, 
the Guangdong Institute of Occupational Diseases, the Nanchang University of 
Life Sciences, and the Guangdong Institute of Occupational Diseases were more 
concentrated. Prevention and Treatment Institute, School of Life Sciences of 
Nanchang University, China Aquatic Products Quality Certification Center, School 
of Food Science and Nutrition Engineering of China Agricultural University, and 
other research structures have the most publications and strong scientific 
research strength; (4) from the main author indicators, the research in the 
field of HACCP has formed a total of four more active research teams, involving 
Chinese herbal medicine, ecological planting, ecological agriculture, 
occupational disease prevention and treatment, light industry handicrafts, 
computer software and computer application, agricultural economy, and other 
research directions. The cooperation between the authors of each team is closer. 
It is suggested that in terms of food safety requirements, China should not only 
integrate the traditional supervision measures for food terminals and after the 
event but also reflect the role of food hazard analysis and assessment in the 
production process and comprehensively integrate the pre-production, production, 
and post-production management of food so that food can really be safe.

Provider Perspectives on Fertility and Fertility Preservation Discussions Among 
Women With Cystic Fibrosis.

Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disorder that primarily impacts the 
respiratory and gastrointestinal systems. With advances in treatment and 
medications, the life expectancy of people with CF is continuing to increase 
with current life expectancy at 47 years of age. Given the increased life 
expectancy, people with CF are interested in childbearing but may have CF 
specific fertility issues that should be addressed by their CF healthcare 
provider. Currently, these conversations are not occurring or are suboptimal. 
This study aimed to investigate the practices of cystic fibrosis (CF) healthcare 
providers regarding fertility and fertility preservation (FP) discussions among 
women with CF. This was a qualitative, descriptive study. Twenty CF healthcare 
providers were interviewed including nurses, nurse practitioners, social 
workers, and dieticians among other disciplines. The semi-structured interviews 
were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed using thematic analysis. 
Four themes emerged from the provider interviews about their fertility and FP 
discussion practices: (1) Change over Time; (2) CF Team Provides Primary Care 
including Reproductive Health Care; (3) Patient Support and Advocacy; and (4) 
Barriers and Facilitators to FP Discussions. The results of this study 
demonstrate an opportunity for CF healthcare providers to deliver 
patient-centered care. However, CF providers need to be educated on fertility 
and FP options. Additionally, there is a need for a more standardized structure 
of care to address the reproductive health of women with CF. The findings from 
this study may also be useful to non-CF providers who deliver care to women 
whose chronic illnesses impact their reproductive health.

Hypertension management forms a cornerstone of cardiovascular prevention. Strong 
evidence is available supporting the benefits of blood pressure (BP) lowering in 
older adults, and recent studies indicate that intensive BP control may provide 
additional advantages concerning cardiovascular and mortality risk, also at 
older ages. Yet, in older adults, the cardiovascular benefit of intensive 
treatment may come at the expense of an increase in adverse events. Indeed, 
advanced age and frailty may modify the risk/benefit ratio of BP lowering due to 
a greater predisposition to hypotension and more severe consequences deriving 
from treatment-related adverse effects. This mostly applies to individuals with 
poor health status and limited life expectancy, in whom aggressive BP lowering 
may not lead to cardiovascular benefits but rather increase the risk of 
short-term treatment-related complications. Furthermore, potential harms of 
intensive BP control might be underestimated in clinical trials due to exclusion 
criteria that preclude patients with frailty and multimorbidity from being 
eligible. Syncope and falls are the most frequently mentioned safety concerns 
related to antihypertensive treatment, but aggressive BP lowering may affect 
negatively also renal function, cognitive performance, quality of life, and 
survival. With the growing emphasis on intensive treatment strategies, raising 
the awareness of potential harms associated with aggressive BP lowering might 
help improve hypertension management in older adults and encourage 
implementation of clinical research on safety. Given these premises, we present 
a narrative review illustrating the most relevant risks associated with 
intensive BP control in older patients.

Intravenous efgartigimod alfa (also known as efgartigimod alfa-fcab in the USA; 
Vyvgart®) is the first neonatal Fc receptor antagonist approved in several 
countries worldwide, including the USA and EU for the treatment of generalised 
myasthenia gravis (gMG) in adults who are anti-acetylcholine receptor (AChR) 
antibody positive, and in Japan for the treatment of gMG regardless of antibody 
status. In the double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 ADAPT trial in patients 
with gMG, efgartigimod alfa significantly and rapidly reduced disease burden and 
improved muscle strength and quality of life compared with placebo. The clinical 
benefits of efgartigimod alfa were durable and reproducible. Furthermore, in an 
interim analysis of the ongoing open-label phase 3 ADAPT+ extension trial,
