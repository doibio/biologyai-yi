BACKGROUND: Falls are a serious cause of morbidity and cost to individuals and 
society. Evidence suggests that foot problems and inappropriate footwear may 
increase the risk of falling. Podiatric interventions could help reduce falls; 
however, there is limited evidence regarding their clinical effectiveness and 
cost-effectiveness.
OBJECTIVES: To determine the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a 
multifaceted podiatry intervention for preventing falls in community-dwelling 
older people at risk of falling, relative to usual care.
DESIGN: A pragmatic, multicentred, cohort randomised controlled trial with an 
economic evaluation and qualitative study.
SETTING: Nine NHS trusts in the UK and one site in Ireland.
PARTICIPANTS: In total, 1010 participants aged ≥ 65 years were randomised 
(intervention, n = 493; usual care, n = 517) via a secure, remote service. 
Blinding was not possible.
INTERVENTIONS: All participants received a falls prevention leaflet and routine 
care from their podiatrist and general practitioner. The intervention also 
consisted of footwear advice, footwear provision if required, foot orthoses and 
foot- and ankle-strengthening exercises.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was the incidence rate of falls per 
participant in the 12 months following randomisation. The secondary outcomes 
included the proportion of fallers and multiple fallers, time to first fall, 
fear of falling, fracture rate, health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and 
cost-effectiveness.
RESULTS: The primary analysis consisted of 484 (98.2%) intervention and 507 
(98.1%) usual-care participants. There was a non-statistically significant 
reduction in the incidence rate of falls in the intervention group [adjusted 
incidence rate ratio 0.88, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.73 to 1.05; p = 0.16]. 
The proportion of participants experiencing a fall was lower (50% vs. 55%, 
adjusted odds ratio 0.78, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.00; p = 0.05). No differences were 
observed in key secondary outcomes. No serious, unexpected and related adverse 
events were reported. The intervention costs £252.17 more per participant (95% 
CI -£69.48 to £589.38) than usual care, was marginally more beneficial in terms 
of HRQoL measured via the EuroQoL-5 Dimensions [mean quality-adjusted life-year 
(QALY) difference 0.0129, 95% CI -0.0050 to 0.0314 QALYs] and had a 65% 
probability of being cost-effective at the National Institute for Health and 
Care Excellence threshold of £30,000 per QALY gained. The intervention was 
generally acceptable to podiatrists and trial participants.
LIMITATIONS: Owing to the difficulty in calculating a sample size for a count 
outcome, the sample size was based on detecting a difference in the proportion 
of participants experiencing at least one fall, and not the primary outcome. We 
are therefore unable to confirm if the trial was sufficiently powered for the 
primary outcome. The findings are not generalisable to patients who are not 
receiving podiatry care.
CONCLUSIONS: The intervention was safe and potentially effective. Although the 
primary outcome measure did not reach significance, a lower fall rate was 
observed in the intervention group. The reduction in the proportion of older 
adults who experienced a fall was of borderline statistical significance. The 
economic evaluation suggests that the intervention could be cost-effective.
FUTURE WORK: Further research could examine whether or not the intervention 
could be delivered in group sessions, by physiotherapists, or in high-risk 
patients.

OBJECTIVE: The prevalence of stroke is expected to increase partly because of 
prolonged life expectancy in the general population. The objective of this study 
was to investigate trends in the prevalence of patients hospitalized with 
ischemic stroke (IS) in Sweden from 1995-2010.
METHODS: The Swedish inpatient and cause-specific death registries were used to 
estimate the absolute numbers and prevalence of patients who were hospitalized 
with and survived an IS from 1995-2010.
RESULTS: The overall number of IS increased from 129,418 in 1995 to 148,778 in 
2010. In 1995, the prevalence of IS was 189 patients per 10,000 population. An 
increase in overall prevalence was observed until 2000, and then it remained 
stable, followed by a decline with an annual percentage change of (APC) -0.8% 
(95% CI -1.0 to 0.6) and with a final prevalence of 199 patients per 10,000 
population in 2010. The prevalence of IS in people aged <45 years increased from 
6.4 in 1995 to 7.6 patients per 10,000 population in 2010, with an APC of 2.1% 
(95% CI 0.9 to 3.4) from 1995-1998 and 0.7% (95% CI 0.6-0.9) from 1998-2010. 
Among those aged 45-54 years, the prevalence rose through the mid to late 1990s, 
followed by a slight decrease (APC: -0.7%, 95% CI-1.1 to -0.4) until 2006 and 
then remained stable with a prevalence of 43.8 patients per 10,000 population in 
2010. Among ≥85 years, there was a minor decrease (APC: -0.3%, 95% CI -0.5 to 
-0.1) in overall prevalence after 2002 from 1481 to 1453 patients per 10,000 
population in 2010.
CONCLUSION: The overall prevalence of IS increased until 2000, but then remained 
stable followed by a slight decline. However, the prevalence of IS in the young 
increased through the study period. The absolute number of IS survivors has 
markedly increased, mainly because of demographic changes.

Background Policy makers in England advocate referral of patients with suspected 
dementia to Memory Assessment Services (MAS), but it is unclear how any 
improvement in patients' health-related quality of life (HRQL) compares with the 
associated costs. Aims To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of MAS for the 
diagnosis and follow-up care of patients with suspected dementia. Method We 
analysed observational data from 1318 patients referred to 69 MAS, and their lay 
carers (n = 944), who completed resource use and HRQL questionnaires at 
baseline, three and six months. We reported mean differences in HRQL 
(disease-specific DEMQOL and generic EQ-5D-3L), quality-adjusted life years 
(QALYs) and costs between baseline and six months after referral to MAS. We also 
assessed the cost-effectiveness of MAS across different patient subgroups and 
clinic characteristics. Results Referral to MAS was associated with gains in 
DEMQOL (mean gain: 3.48, 95% confidence interval: 2.84 to 4.12), EQ-5D-3L 
(0.023, 0.008 to 0.038) and QALYs (0.006, 0.002 to 0.01). Mean total cost over 
six months, assuming a societal perspective, was £1899 (£1277 to £2539). This 
yielded a negative incremental net monetary benefit of -£1724 (-£2388 to 
-£1085), assuming NICE's recommended willingness-to-pay threshold (£30,000 per 
QALY). These base case results were relatively robust to alternative assumptions 
about costs and HRQL. There was some evidence that patients aged 80 or older 
benefitted more from referral to MAS (p < 0.01 from adjusted mean differences in 
net benefits) compared to younger patients. MAS with over 75 new patients a 
month or cost per patient less than £2500 over six months were relatively more 
cost-effective (p < 0.01) than MAS with fewer new monthly patients or higher 
cost per patient. Conclusions Diagnosis, treatment and follow-up care provided 
by MAS to patients with suspected dementia appears to be effective, but not 
cost-effective, in the six months after diagnosis. Longer term evidence is 
required before drawing conclusions about the cost-effectiveness of MAS.

Over the past 175 years, data related to human disease and death have progressed 
to a summary measure of population health, the Disability-Adjusted Life Year 
(DALY). As dairies have intensified there has been no equivalent measure of the 
impact of disease on the productive life and well-being of animals. The 
development of a disease-adjusted metric requires a consistent set of disability 
weights that reflect the relative severity of important diseases. The objective 
of this study was to use an international survey of dairy authorities to derive 
disability weights for primary disease categories recorded on dairies. National 
and international dairy health and management authorities were contacted through 
professional organizations, dairy industry publications and conferences, and 
industry contacts. Estimates of minimum, most likely, and maximum disability 
weights were derived for 12 common dairy cow diseases. Survey participants were 
asked to estimate the impact of each disease on overall health and milk 
production. Diseases were classified from 1 (minimal adverse effects) to 10 
(death). The data was modelled using BetaPERT distributions to demonstrate the 
variation in these dynamic disease processes, and to identify the most likely 
aggregated disability weights for each disease classification. A single 
disability weight was assigned to each disease using the average of the combined 
medians for the minimum, most likely, and maximum severity scores. A total of 96 
respondents provided estimates of disability weights. The final disability 
weight values resulted in the following order from least to most severe: 
retained placenta, diarrhea, ketosis, metritis, mastitis, milk fever, lame (hoof 
only), calving trauma, left displaced abomasum, pneumonia, musculoskeletal 
injury (leg, hip, back), and right displaced abomasum. The peaks of the 
probability density functions indicated that for certain disease states such as 
retained placenta there was a relatively narrow range of expected impact whereas 
other diseases elicited a wider breadth of impact. This was particularly 
apparent with respect to calving trauma, lameness and musculoskeletal injury, 
all of which could be redefined using gradients of severity or accounting for 
sequelae. These disability weight distributions serve as an initial step in the 
development of the disease-adjusted lactation (DALact) metric. They will be used 
to assess the time lost due to dynamic phases of dairy cow diseases and 
injuries. Prioritizing health interventions based on time expands the discussion 
of animal health to view profits and losses in light of the quality and length 
of life.

The study examined the preferences of a sample of the Australian public and 
health professionals regarding the relative importance of four different 
criteria for prioritizing between patients: the severity of the condition, the 
size of the benefit from the intervention, past health losses and expected 
lifetime health. A discussion-group methodology was adopted to elicit social 
preferences. This allowed participants time to consider all of the alternatives 
fully, to seek clarification of the task, and to engage in open debate about the 
issues raised. Participants traded-off cost-effectiveness for priority to the 
more severely ill. They placed less importance on past health and the lifetime 
allocation of health in deciding priority for treatment, and more importance on 
improving the condition of those who will be left more severely ill or disabled 
in the absence of treatment. The results pose a challenge to studies reporting 
support for the "fair innings argument". They also support the Norwegian 
government's decision not to pursue a life-time health loss criterion as 
recommended by the Norheim Commission. The study question is important given 
current debate both in the health economics literature and at the policy level 
in several jurisdictions.

Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) cardiomyopathy is a progressive lethal disease 
caused by the lack of the dystrophin protein in the heart. The most widely used 
animal model of DMD is the dystrophin-deficient mdx mouse; however, these mice 
exhibit a mild dystrophic phenotype with heart failure only late in life. In 
contrast, mice deficient for both dystrophin and utrophin (mdx/utrn-/-, or dKO) 
can be used to model severe DMD cardiomyopathy where pathophysiological 
indicators of heart failure are detectable by 8-10weeks of age. Nitric oxide 
(NO) is an important signaling molecule involved in vital functions of 
regulating rhythm, contractility, and microcirculation of the heart, and 
constitutive NO production affects the function of proteins involved in 
excitation-contraction coupling. In this study, we explored the efficacy of 
enhancing NO production as a therapeutic strategy for treating DMD 
cardiomyopathy using the dKO mouse model of DMD. Specifically, NO production was 
induced via whole body periodic acceleration (pGz), a novel non-pharmacologic 
intervention which enhances NO synthase (NOS) activity through sinusoidal motion 
of the body in a headward-footward direction, introducing pulsatile shear stress 
to the vascular endothelium and cardiomyocyte plasma membrane. Male dKO mice 
were randomized at 8weeks of age to receive daily pGz (480cpm, Gz±3.0m/s2, 1h/d) 
for 4weeks or no treatment, and a separate age-matched group of WT animals 
(pGz-treated and untreated) served as non-diseased controls. At the conclusion 
of the protocol, cardiomyocytes from untreated dKO animals had, respectively, 
4.3-fold and 3.5-fold higher diastolic resting concentration of Ca2+ ([Ca2+]d) 
and Na+ ([Na+]d) compared to WT, while pGz treatment significantly reduced these 
levels. For dKO cardiomyocytes, pGz treatment also improved the depressed 
contractile function, decreased oxidative stress, blunted the elevation in 
calpain activity, and mitigated the abnormal increase in [Ca2+]d upon mechanical 
stress. These improvements culminated in a significant reduction in circulating 
cardiac troponin T (cTnT) and an extension of the median lifespan of dKO mice 
from 16 to 31weeks. Treatment with L-NAME (NOS inhibitor) significantly 
decreased overall lifespan and abolished the cardioprotective properties 
elicited by pGz. Our results provide evidence that enhancement of NO synthesis 
by pGz can ameliorate cellular dysfunction in dKO cardiomyocytes and may 
represent a novel therapeutic intervention in DMD cardiomyopathy patients.

People's Quality of Life Brief Questionnaire (OPQoL-Brief) Scores.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Economic evaluation of healthcare treatment and 
services targeted at older people requires measurement of utility-based 
quality-of-life outcomes but it is not always possible to collect such outcome 
data. It may, however, be possible to estimate these outcomes using non-utility 
measures of quality of life where the latter have been collected. The objective 
of this study was to develop a regression-based algorithm to map a 
non-utility-based outcome, the Older People's Quality of Life brief 
questionnaire (OPQoL-brief), onto a utility-based outcome, the EuroQoL 
5 Dimensions 5 Levels (EQ-5D-5L).
METHODS: The estimation sample comprised 330 community-based Australian older 
people (>65 years), while the validation sample consisted of 293 older people 
from a separate study. Six regression techniques were employed to estimate 
utilities from OPQoL-brief. The predictive accuracy of 54 regression models (six 
regression techniques × nine model specifications) was assessed using six 
criteria: mean absolute error (MAE), root mean squared error (RMSE), 
correlation, distribution of predicted utilities, distribution of residuals, and 
proportion of predictions with absolute errors <0.05.
RESULTS: The 54 regression models predicted EQ-5D-5L utilities that performed 
differently when assessed by the six criteria. However, best results were 
obtained from an ordinary least squares (OLS) model where all 13 OPQoL-brief 
items were included as continuous variables (OLS 4). RMSE and MAE estimates for 
this model (0.2201 and 0.1638, respectively) were within the range of published 
estimates.
CONCLUSIONS: It is possible to predict valid utilities from OPQoL-brief using 
regression methods. We recommend OLS model (4) for this exercise.

BACKGROUND: Shared decision-making (SDM) is a key priority to improve 
patient-centred care, and can play an important role in helping patients decide 
whether to undergo total joint arthroplasty (TJA). Patient decision aids can 
support SDM; however, they may incur an upfront cost. We aimed to estimate the 
health and economic effects of patient decision aids for TJA.
METHODS: A cost-effectiveness analysis of a randomised controlled trial (RCT) 
with 2-year follow-up. 343 patients were recruited from two orthopedic screening 
clinics in Ottawa, Canada. Patients were randomized to either a patient decision 
aid plus surgeon preference report (decision aid) or usual care. Primary 
outcomes were costs (in 2014 CAD$), quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and the 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Costs were calculated by 
multiplying self-reported resource use by unit costs. QALYs were calculated by 
mapping the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index 
(WOMAC) to EuroQol 5-Dimension (EQ-5D) health utilities. Costs and QALYs were 
discounted at 5%. Multiple imputation was used to handle missing data, and 
bootstrapping was used to estimate uncertainty.
RESULTS: The sample comprised 167 intervention and 167 control group patients. 
The decision aid arm had fewer surgeries over the 2-year period thereby 
incurring a negative incremental cost of -$560 (95% CI: -$1358 to $426) per 
patient while providing 0.05 (95% CI: -0.04 to 0.13) additional QALYs per 
patient. Consequently, the decision aid arm was dominant.
CONCLUSION: The use of a patient decision aid was associated with fewer health 
care costs, while producing similar health outcomes.

BACKGROUND: It is widely acknowledged that concerns for the worse off need to be 
integrated with the concern for cost effectiveness in priority setting, and 
several countries are seeking to do so. In Norway, a comprehensive framework for 
priority setting was recently proposed to specify the worse off in terms of 
lifetime loss of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). However, few studies have 
shown how to calculate such health losses, how to integrate health loss into 
cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs) and how such integration impacts the 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). The aim of this study was to do 
so.
METHODS: The proposed framework was applied to data from 15 recent economic 
evaluations of drugs. Available data were used to calculate the lifetime health 
loss of the target groups, and the proposed marginal weighting function was 
employed to adjust standard ICERs according to the size of this loss. Standard 
and weighted ICERs were compared to a threshold of US$35,000 per QALY gained.
RESULTS: Lifetime health loss can be calculated with the use of available data 
and integrated by a marginal weighting function with CEAs. Such integration 
affected standard ICERs to a varying degree and changed the number of 
interventions considered cost effective from three to eight.
CONCLUSION: Calculation of lifetime health loss and its integration with CEA is 
feasible and can influence the reimbursement and ranking of interventions. To 
facilitate regular integration, guidelines for economic evaluations could 
require (i) adjustment according to distributional concerns and (ii) that data 
on health loss are extracted directly from the models and reported. Generic 
databases on health loss could be developed alongside such efforts.

PURPOSE: Maintaining glycemic control is the key treatment target for patients 
with type 2 diabetes mellitus. In addition, the glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) 
receptor agonists may be associated with other favorable treatment 
characteristics, such as reduction in body weight and reduced risk of 
hypoglycemia compared with traditional diabetes interventions. The aim of the 
present analysis was to compare the long-term cost-effectiveness of 2 GLP-1 
receptor agonists, liraglutide 1.8 mg and lixisenatide 20 μg (both administered 
once daily), in the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes failing to 
achieve glycemic control with metformin monotherapy in the Italian setting.
METHODS: The IMS CORE Diabetes Model was used to project long-term clinical 
outcomes and subsequent costs (in 2015 Euros [€]) associated with liraglutide 
1.8 mg versus lixisenatide 20 μg treatment in a cohort with baseline 
characteristics derived from the open-label LIRA-LIXI trial (Efficacy and Safety 
of Liraglutide Versus Lixisenatide as Add-on to Metformin in Subjects With Type 
2 Diabetes; NCT01973231) over patient lifetimes from the perspective of a health 
care payer. Efficacy data were taken from the 26-week end points of the same 
trial, including changes in glycated hemoglobin, body mass index, serum lipid 
levels, and hypoglycemic event rates. Outcomes projected included life 
expectancy, quality-adjusted life expectancy, cumulative incidence and time to 
onset of diabetes-related complications, and direct medical costs. Outcomes were 
discounted at 3% annually, and sensitivity analyses were performed.
FINDINGS: Liraglutide 1.8 mg was associated with improved discounted life 
expectancy (14.07 vs 13.96 years) and quality-adjusted life expectancy (9.18 vs 
9.06 quality-adjusted life years [QALYs]) compared with lixisenatide 20 μg. 
These improvements were mostly attributable to a greater reduction in glycated 
hemoglobin level with liraglutide 1.8 mg versus lixisenatide 20 μg, leading to 
reduced incidence and increased time to onset of diabetes-related complications. 
Compared with lixisenatide 20 μg, liraglutide 1.8 mg was associated with 
increased total costs over patient lifetimes (€41,623 vs €41,380), but this was 
offset by lower costs of treating diabetes-related complications (€26,682 vs 
€27,476). Liraglutide 1.8 mg was associated with an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio of €2001 per QALY gained versus lixisenatide 20 μg. At 
a willingness-to-pay threshold of €30,000 per QALY gained, liraglutide 1.8 mg 
had a probability of 77.2% of being cost-effective.
IMPLICATIONS: Based on long-term projections, liraglutide 1.8 mg is likely to be 
considered cost-effective compared with lixisenatide 20 μg for the treatment of 
patients with type 2 diabetes in Italy.

BACKGROUND: A screening program for lung cancer requires more empirical 
evidence. Based on the experience of the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST), 
we developed a method to adjust lead-time bias and quality-of-life changes for 
estimating the cost-effectiveness of implementing computed tomography (CT) 
screening in Taiwan.
METHODS: The target population was high-risk (≥30 pack-years) smokers between 55 
and 75 years of age. From a nation-wide, 13-year follow-up cohort, we estimated 
quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE), loss-of-QALE, and lifetime healthcare 
expenditures per case of lung cancer stratified by pathology and stage. 
Cumulative stage distributions for CT-screening and no-screening were assumed 
equal to those for CT-screening and radiography-screening in the NLST to 
estimate the savings of loss-of-QALE and additional costs of lifetime healthcare 
expenditures after CT screening. Costs attributable to screen-negative subjects, 
false-positive cases and radiation-induced lung cancer were included to obtain 
the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio from the public payer's perspective.
RESULTS: The incremental costs were US$22,755 per person. After dividing this by 
savings of loss-of-QALE (1.16 quality-adjusted life year (QALY)), the 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was US$19,683 per QALY. This ratio would 
fall to US$10,947 per QALY if the stage distribution for CT-screening was the 
same as that of screen-detected cancers in the NELSON trial.
CONCLUSIONS: Low-dose CT screening for lung cancer among high-risk smokers would 
be cost-effective in Taiwan. As only about 5% of our women are smokers, future 
research is necessary to identify the high-risk groups among non-smokers and 
increase the coverage.

BACKGROUND: The indications of esophageal replacement (ER) in pediatric patients 
include long gap esophageal atresia (LGEA), intractable post-corrosive 
esophageal strictures (PCES), and some rare esophageal diseases. Various 
conduits and procedures are currently used worldwide with a lack of consensus 
regarding the ideal substitute to replace the esophagus replacement. The 
short-term outcomes of these advanced procedures are well known; there are few 
data available describing long-term functional outcomes of these patients with 
long life expectancy.
OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study is to investigate the long-term 
functional outcomes of the most widely used techniques for ER in pediatric 
patients based on a comprehensive literature search covering the last 10years.
METHODS: Eligible were all clinical studies reporting outcomes after 
esophagectomy in pediatric patients, which contained information on at least 
3years of follow-up after the operation. The review was conducted in accordance 
with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses 
(PRISMA) guidelines. A systematic web-based search using MEDLINE, the Cochrane 
Library and EMBASE databases was performed, reviewing all medical literature 
published between January 2006 and December 2015.
RESULTS: The scientific quality of the data was generally poor, converging 
toward only 14 full-text articles for the final analysis. The stomach was the 
preferred organ for esophageal replacement, where the tubulization of the 
stomach resulted in significant gastroesophageal reflux. Dysphagia symptoms were 
more seldom reported, but several authors presented growing figures with the 
length of follow-up. Dumping syndrome and delayed gastric emptying were only 
scarcely reported upon. Following colonic graft, chronic gastrocolic reflux 
affects these patients, in the range of 35-70.8%, while 4 studies reported any 
dysphagia from 2.7% to 50% of the children. Only one study reported the outcome 
of the use of a long jejunal segment, where presence of symptoms of functional 
obstruction was mentioned in 46% of cases. Very few if any data were available 
on a structured assessment of postprandial dumping and disturbed bowel 
functions.
CONCLUSIONS: Available data in pediatric patients, on the long-term functional 
outcomes after esophageal replacement with a gastric tube, colonic graft or a 
long jejunal segment, are of poor scientific quality. Although symptoms are 
frequently reported currently no conclusions can be drawn regarding potential 
advantages of one graft over another.
TYPE OF STUDY: Treatment study, systematic review.
LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: IV.

Life expectancy is constantly increasing in the developed countries due to 
medical, hygiene and socio-economic advances. Unfortunately, a longer life not 
always corresponds to a healthier life. Indeed, aging is associated with growing 
risk factors for illness associated with societal conditions (isolation, 
maltreatment), and neurodegenerative diseases. Even normal aging is associated 
with a cognitive decline that can hinder independence and quality of life of 
elderly. Thus, one major societal challenge is to build policies that support 
people of all ages to maintain a maximum health and functional capacity 
throughout their lives. Meditation could be a promising intervention in 
contrasting the negative effects of aging. Indeed, it has been shown to enhance 
cognitive efficiency in several domains, such as attention and executive 
functions in young adults. Nevertheless, whether these effects extend to old 
participants is still a matter of debate. Few studies have directly investigated 
this issue, reporting encouraging results in a large panel of cognitive 
functions, such as: attention, executive functions and memory. However, a final 
conclusion about the causal role of meditation and the generalization of these 
results is made difficult due to several methodological limitations. We propose 
a roadmap for future studies to pass these limitations with the hope that the 
present work would contribute to the development of the young research field of 
meditation in gerontology.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Stroke mortality is 30% higher in the rural United 
States. This could be because of either higher incidence or higher case fatality 
from stroke in rural areas.
METHODS: The urban-rural status of 23 280 stroke-free participants recruited 
between 2003 and 2007 in the REGARDS study (Reasons for Geographic and Racial 
Differences in Stroke) was classified using the Rural-Urban Commuting Area 
scheme as residing in urban, large rural town/city, or small rural town or 
isolated areas. The risk of incident stroke was assessed using proportional 
hazards analysis, and case fatality (death within 30 days of stroke) was 
assessed using logistic regression. Models were adjusted for demographics, 
traditional stroke risk factors, and measures of socioeconomic status.
RESULTS: After adjustment for demographic factors and relative to urban areas, 
stroke incidence was 1.23-times higher (95% confidence intervals, 1.01-1.51) in 
large rural town/cities and 1.30-times higher (95% confidence intervals, 
1.03-1.62) in small rural towns or isolated areas. Adjustment for risk factors 
and socioeconomic status only modestly attenuated this association, and the 
association became marginally nonsignificant (P=0.071). There was no association 
of rural-urban status with case fatality (P>0.47).
CONCLUSIONS: The higher stroke mortality in rural regions seemed to be 
attributable to higher stroke incidence rather than case fatality. A higher 
prevalence of risk factors and lower socioeconomic status only modestly 
contributed to the increased risk of incident stroke risk in rural areas. There 
was no evidence of higher case fatality in rural areas.

Background: Screening programs consistently underserve indigenous populations 
despite a higher overall burden of cancer. In this study, we explore the likely 
health gains and cost-effectiveness of a national colorectal cancer screening 
program for the indigenous Māori population of New Zealand (NZ).Methods: A 
Markov model estimated: health benefits (quality-adjusted life-year; QALY), 
costs, and cost-effectiveness of biennial immunochemical fecal occult blood 
testing (FOBTi) of 50- to 74-year-olds from 2011. Input parameters came from 
literature reviews, the NZ Bowel Screening Programme Pilot, and NZ linked health 
datasets. Equity analyses substituted non-Māori values for Māori values of 
background (noncolorectal cancer) morbidity and mortality, colorectal cancer 
survival and incidence, screening coverage, and stage-specific survival. We 
measured the change in "quality-adjusted life expectancy" (QALE) as a result of 
the intervention.Results: Based upon a threshold of GDP per capita (NZ$45,000), 
colorectal cancer screening in NZ using FOBTi is cost-effective: NZ$2,930 
(US$1,970) per QALY gained [95% uncertainty interval: cost saving to $6,850 
(US$4,610)]. Modeled health gains per capita for Māori were less than for 
non-Māori: half for 50- to 54-year-olds (0.031 QALYs per person for Māori vs. 
0.058 for non-Māori), and a fifth (0.003 c.f. 0.016) for 70- to 74-year-olds and 
ethnic inequalities in QALE increased with colorectal cancer 
screening.Conclusions: Colorectal cancer screening in NZ using FOBTi is likely 
to be cost-effective but risks increasing inequalities in health for 
Māori.Impact: To avoid or mitigate the generation of further health 
inequalities, attention should be given to underserved population groups when 
planning and implementing screening programs. Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev;

BACKGROUND: The incidence of lung cancer is increasing with longer life 
expectancy. Refusal of active treatment for cancer is prone to cause patients to 
experience more severe symptoms and shorten survival. The purpose of this study 
was to define the factors related to refusal or abandonment of active therapy in 
lung cancer.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the data of 617 patients from medical 
records from 2010 to 2014. Two groups were formed: 149 patients who refused 
anti-cancer treatment and allowed only palliative care were classified into the 
non-treatment group, while the remaining 468 who received anti-cancer treatment 
were classified into the treatment group.
RESULTS: The groups differed significantly in age, employment, relationship 
status, number of offspring, educational status, body mass index, presence of 
chest and systemic symptoms, Charlson Comorbidity Index, Eastern Cooperative 
Oncology Group score, and tumor node metastasis stage ( P < 0.05). In logistic 
regression analysis, age (odds ratio [OR] 1.10, 95% confidence interval [CI] 
1.07-1.13), educational status lower than high school (OR 1.95, 95% CI 1.2-3.2), 
no history of surgery (OR 2.29, 95% CI 1.4-3.7), body mass index < 18.5 (OR 
2.49, 95% CI 1.3-4.7), and a high Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group score of 3 
or 4 (OR 5.02, 95% CI 2.3-10.8) were significant factors for refusal of cancer 
treatment.
CONCLUSION: Individual factors, such as old age, low educational status, low 
weight, and poor performance status can influence refusal of cancer treatment in 
patients with lung cancer, and should be considered prior to consultation with 
patients.

BACKGROUND: The conventional frontline therapy for fit patients with chronic 
lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is fludarabine, cyclophosphamide and rituximab 
(FCR). Rituximab (Mabthera®, Roche Products Ltd) targets the CD20 antigen, which 
is expressed at low levels in CLL. The standard dose of rituximab in CLL 
(375 mg/m2 in cycle 1 and 500 mg/m2 in cycles 2-6) was selected based on 
toxicity data only. Small doses of rituximab (as low as 20 mg) have biological 
activity in CLL, with an immediate reduction in circulating CLL cells and 
down-regulation of CD20. Phase II trials had suggested improved efficacy with 
the addition of mitoxantrone to FCR. The key assumption for the Attenuated dose 
Rituximab with ChemoTherapy In CLL (ARCTIC) trial was that the addition of 
mitoxantrone to fludarabine, cyclophosphamide and low-dose rituximab would be 
more effective than conventional FCR.
OBJECTIVES: To assess whether fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, mitoxantrone and 
low-dose rituximab (FCM-miniR) (100 mg of rituximab per cycle) was non-inferior 
to FCR in frontline CLL. Complete response (CR) rate was the primary end point, 
with the secondary end points being progression-free survival (PFS), overall 
survival (OS), overall response rate, eradication of minimal residual disease 
(MRD), safety and cost-effectiveness.
DESIGN: ARCTIC was a UK multicentre, randomised, controlled, open, Phase IIB 
non-inferiority trial in previously untreated CLL. A total of 206 patients with 
previously untreated CLL who required treatment, according to the International 
Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia criteria, were to be randomised to FCR 
or FCM-miniR. There was an independent Data Monitoring and Ethics Committee 
(DMEC) with a pre-planned interim efficacy assessment on 103 participants.
RESULTS: The DMEC's interim analysis led to early trial closure. Although the 
response rates in both arms were higher than anticipated, FCM-miniR had a lower 
CR rate than FCR. This was partly attributable to the higher toxicity associated 
with mitoxantrone. A total of 100 participants completed FCR, 79 completed 
FCM-miniR and 21 commenced FCM-miniR but switched to FCR following DMEC 
recommendations. The CR rate for participants receiving FCR was 76%, compared 
with 55% for FCM-miniR (adjusted odds ratio 0.37; 95% confidence interval 0.19 
to 0.73). Key secondary end points also showed that FCR was superior, with more 
participants achieving MRD negativity (57% for FCR vs. 46% for FCM-miniR). More 
participants experienced a serious adverse reaction with FCM-miniR compared with 
FCR (50% vs. 41%). At a median of 37.3 months' follow-up, the PFS and OS rates 
are good compared with previous studies, with no significant difference between 
the treatment arms. The economic analysis indicates that because FCM-miniR is 
less effective than FCR, FCM-miniR is not expected to be cost-effective over a 
lifetime horizon, producing a mean cost-saving of -£7723, a quality-adjusted 
life-year loss of -0.73 and a resulting incremental net monetary loss of -£6780.
CONCLUSIONS: FCM-miniR is less well tolerated, with poorer response rates, than 
FCR, partly owing to the additional toxicity associated with mitoxantrone. In 
view of this, FCM-miniR will not be taken forward into a larger definitive Phase 
III trial. The trial demonstrated that oral FCR yields extremely high response 
rates compared with historical series with intravenous chemotherapy.
FUTURE WORK: We shall compare the results of ARCTIC with those of the ADMIRE 
(Does the ADdition of Mitoxantrone Improve Response to FCR chemotherapy in 
patients with CLL?) trial, which compared FCR with FCM-R to assess the efficacy 
of low- versus standard-dose rituximab, allowing for the toxicity associated 
with mitoxantrone.
