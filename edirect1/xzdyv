class and modified Rankin scale at discharge (p = 0.238).
CONCLUSION: With the aging global population and increasing life expectancy, the 
number of ultra-geriatric patients with complex pathologies seeking advanced 
microsurgical treatment is growing. Therefore, neurosurgeons are confronting a 
growing number and variety of complex pathologies in ultra-geriatric patients in 
their daily practice. Regardless of advanced age, microsurgery provides safe and 
effective treatment, with age alone not being a barrier to proper neurosurgical 
treatment when other risk factors are adequately modified.

The effects of poly-lactic acid films containing different concentrations of 
Cinnamomum verum essential oil (CVEO) on microbial, chemical and sensory 
criteria of minced squab were assessed during the storage at 4 °C for 12 days. 
The counts of total aerobic bacteria, psychrotrophic bacteria, lactic acid 
bacteria, pseudomonads and Enterobacteriacea of wrapped samples with PLA films 
containing 0.6 and 0.9 % CVEO never reached 7 log CFU/g during the storage. 
Counts of E. coli and L. monocytogenes spiked to the PLA-wrapped with 0.6 or 0.9 
CVEO squab samples were an order and 2 orders of magnitude lower, respectively, 
after the storage comparing to control. Also, samples wrapped with PLA films 
containing different concentrations of CVEO had lower total volatile base 
nitrogen, and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances values vs. control. 
Finally, applying of PLA films containing different concentration of CVEO, led 
to minor changes in sensory characteristics (P > 0.05).

Raptors are ideal indicators for biomonitoring studies using wildlife in order 
to assess the environmental pollution in the terrestrial ecosystem, since they 
are placed in the highest trophic position in the food webs and their life 
expectancy is relatively long. In this study, 26 eggs of 4 bird species 
(Peregrine falcon, Eurasian curlew, Little owl and Eagle owl) collected in 
Germany, were investigated for the presence of persistent organic pollutants 
(POPs) and thousands of contaminants of emerging concern (CECs). Generic sample 
preparation protocols were followed for the extraction of the analytes and the 
purification of the extracts, and the samples were analyzed both by liquid (LC) 
and gas chromatography (GC) coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS), 
for capturing a wide range of organic micropollutants with different 
physicochemical properties. State-of-the-art screening methodologies were 
applied in the acquired HRMS data, including wide-scope target analysis of 2448 
known pollutants and suspect screening of over 65,000 environmentally relevant 
compounds. Overall, 58 pollutants from different chemical classes, such as plant 
protection products, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances and medicinal products, 
as well as their transformation products, were determined through target 
analysis. Most of the detected compounds were lipophilic (logP>2), although the 
presence of (semi)polar contaminants should not be overlooked, underlying the 
need for holistic analytical approaches in environmental monitoring studies. 
p,p'-DDE, PCB 153 and PCB138, PFOS and methylparaben were the most frequently 
detected compounds. 50 additional substances were identified and semi-quantified 
through suspect screening workflows, including mainly compounds of industrial 
use with high production volume.

Use of a microsimulation method for assessing dynamics of smoking status and 
gains in life expectancy after quitting in a longitudinal cohort of US older 
adults.

OBJECTIVES: Previous studies were unable to estimate the dynamics of smoking 
status in the US elderly general population, and no study has assessed the 
benefit of quitting in terms of resultant gains in life expectancy. We proposed 
a novel method to estimate the per cent of quitting in remaining lifetime, 
successful quitting and relapse, as well as life expectancy by participants' 
baseline smoking status.
DESIGN: Longitudinal cohort.
SETTING: US community-dwelling population.
PARTICIPANTS: Respondents from the Medicare Health Outcome Survey Cohort 15 
(baseline 2012, follow-up 2014). We included respondents who were aged ≥65 years 
and alive at the baseline and participated in the baseline survey 
(n=164 597).Primary and secondary outcome measuresAttempt quitting, successful 
quitting, relapse rates and life expectancy by smoking status at age 65-95 
years.
RESULTS: Among daily smokers aged 65 years, 61% would attempt to quit during 
their remaining lifetime, and 31% would quit successfully. Among some days 
smokers aged 65 years, 69% would attempt to quit during their remaining 
lifetime, and 37% would quit successfully. Among recent ex-smokers aged 65 
years, 53% would relapse. Life expectancy at age 65 years was 20.0 (SE=0.27), 
17.2 (SE=0.30), 16.2 (SE=0.29) and 15.9 (SE=0.29) years for long time 
non-smokers, recent ex-smokers, some days smokers and daily smokers, 
respectively. Although recent ex-smokers had a higher 2-year mortality than 
current smokers, those who quit up to 77 years (77 years for men and 87 years 
for women) had a significantly longer (p<0.05) life expectancy. Sensitivity 
analysis demonstrated that the model assumptions had a relatively small impact 
on estimates with a maximum relative bias within ±7%.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides detailed information regarding the dynamics of 
smoking status in an understudied and growing population and demonstrates the 
benefit of smoking cessation on life expectancy. Future research should focus on 
understanding specific predictors of smoking cessation.

Over the last decade, we have witnessed a massive increase in available clinical 
agents, both in the clinical trial setting and following commercial use 
approval, directed to reduced life expectancy as well as the considerable 
symptom, splenic and anaemia burden associated with myelofibrosis. Given the 
median age of onset of the disease, coupled with an ageing population globally, 
we will be caring for an increasingly aged myelofibrosis cohort in future years. 
We will need to adapt our approach, emphasizing the holistic management of the 
older individual with myelofibrosis accordingly. Out with the pharmacological 
management of the disease, consideration needs to be given to interventions 
based on concurrent illness, comprehensive geriatric assessments, frailty, 
polypharmacy and drug-drug interactions, nutritional issues, psychological 
concerns (depression, anxiety or distress), cognitive decline and 
social/economic aspects. Within this review, we summarise available data 
addressing these issues, outline knowledge gaps and suggest a summative and 
holistic approach to the older individual with myelofibrosis.

BACKGROUND: Incontinence and impotence occur following radical prostatectomy due 
to injury to nerves and sphincter muscle. Preserving nerves and muscle adjacent 
to prostate cancer risks positive surgical margins. Advanced imaging with MRI 
has improved cancer localization but limitations exist.
OBJECTIVE: To measure the accuracy for assessing extra-prostatic extension at 
nerve bundles for 2 PSMA-PET tracers and to compare the PET accuracy to 
standard-of-care predictors including MRI and biopsy results.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We studied men with PSMA-targeted PET imaging, performed 
prior to prostatectomy in men largely with intermediate to high-risk prostate 
cancer, and retrospectively evaluated for assessment of extra-prostatic 
extension with whole-mount analysis as reference standard. Two different 
PSMA-PET tracers were included: 68Ga-PSMA-11 and 68Ga-P16-093. Blinded reviews 
of the PET and MRI scans were performed to assess extra-prostatic extension 
(EPE). Sensitivity and specificity for extra-prostatic extension were compared 
using McNemar's Chi2.
RESULTS: Pre-operative PSMA-PET imaging was available for 71 patients with 
either 68Ga-P16-093 (n = 25) or 68Ga-PSMA-11 (n = 46). There were 24 (34%) with 
pT3a (EPE) and 16 (23%) with pT3b (SVI). EPE Sensitivity (87% vs. 92%), 
Specificity (77% vs. 76%), and ROC area (0.82 vs. 0.84) were similar between 
P16-093 and PSMA-11, respectively (P = 0.87). MRI (available in only 45) found 
high specificity (83%) but low sensitivity (60%) for EPE when using a published 
grading system. MRI sensitivity was significantly lower than the PSMA-PET (60% 
vs. 90%, P = 0.02), but similar to PET when using a >5 mm capsular contact (76% 
vs. 90%, P = 0.38). A treatment change to "nerve sparing" was recommended in 21 
of 71 (30%) patients based on PSMA-PET imaging.
CONCLUSIONS: Presurgical PSMA-PET appeared useful as a tool for surgical 
planning, changing treatment plans in men with ≥4+3 or multi-core 3+4 prostate 
cancer resulting in preservation of nerve-bundles.

Socioeconomically-deprived patients suffer hip fractures at a younger age and 
require more hospital admissions, but early mortality risk is unchanged: The 
IMPACT Deprivation Study.

INTRODUCTION: Socioeconomic deprivation is associated with multi-morbidity and 
frailty, but influence on hip fracture outcomes is poorly understood. The 
primary aim was to investigate the association between deprivation and 
mortality, and secondary aims were to assess the effects on: (i) age at 
presentation; (ii) inpatient outcomes, and (iii) post-discharge outcomes.
METHOD: This cohort study included all patients aged >50 years admitted with a 
hip fracture to a high-volume centre between 01 March 2020 and 20 November 2021. 
Data were collected contemporaneously by specialist auditors and underwent 
validation using live health records after 180 days follow-up. Variables were 
demographics including Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation, injury and 
management factors, and outcome measures including length of stay, discharge 
destination, readmission, and mortality status at 180 days.
RESULTS: There were 1822 patients of which 1306/1822 (72%) were female. 
Deprivation was independently associated with younger age at hip fracture, 
demonstrating a linear correlation with each deprivation level. The overall mean 
age was 80.7 years (range 50-102), with the mean age in the most deprived group 
being 77.2 years (95% CI; 75.7-78.7) versus 82.8 years (95% CI; 82.0-83.5) in 
the least deprived. Multivariate logistic regression showed no association 
between deprivation and 30- or 180-day mortality risk. Kaplan-Meier survival 
analysis demonstrated no difference between the most deprived versus least 
deprived (log-rank, p = 0.854). Deprivation had no influence on length of stay, 
discharge destination, or COVID-19 status, but deprived patients had an 
increased risk of readmission (OR 1.63, 95% CI [1.18-2.24]; p = 0.003).
CONCLUSION: Deprivation showed no linear correlation with early mortality risk 
(within 180 days of injury), but it was associated with an earlier age at 
presentation (the most deprived sustained a hip fracture 5.6 years earlier than 
the least deprived) which may impact overall life expectancy. More deprived 
patients were more likely to require further acute hospital admissions.

PURPOSE: Resilience research in family caregiving in chronic neurological 
conditions is growing, but multiple sclerosis (MS) caregivers are noticeably 
absent from this body of work. MS caregivers represent a unique population due 
to the disease's early onset, prolonged life expectancy, and heterogeneity. As 
such, this study aimed to explore MS caregivers' conceptualizations of 
resilience, examine MS caregivers' experiences of resilience development, and 
determine which assets and resources influence resilience in this role.
METHODS: Twenty-four Canadian MS caregivers were recruited. Semi-structured 
in-depth interviews were conducted with questions derived from an ecological 
resilience framework. Data were analysed using reflexive thematic analysis.
RESULTS: Themes constructed a cyclical resilience model, beginning with 
encounters with hardship and extending to thriving adjustment. Subthemes 
included reports of additive challenges, impactful individual and community 
resources, and multi-level adaptive pathways. Within this cycle, the achievement 
of healthy adjustment exerted a positive feedback function and informed future 
responses to lifelong challenges.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite the salience of resilience processes within caregiver 
testimonies, inadequate resources at societal levels were evident. These 
findings afford researchers and decision-makers relevant information for 
designing and implementing resilience-building interventions for MS caregivers 
that attend to contextual factors and current systemic support deficiencies.

University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China.

BACKGROUND: The study aims to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of anlotinib 
versus pembrolizumab and nivolumab as the third-line treatment in recurrent 
small cell lung cancer (SCLC) patients from the Chinese healthcare system 
perspective.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A Markov model was built to simulate the costs and 
health outcomes in the 4-year horizon. Efficacy and safety data of anlotinib, 
pembrolizumab, and nivolumab in patients with recurrent SCLC were derived from 
three studies. Cost and utility values were derived from local charges, the 
published literature, and related databases. Three scenario analyses and 
sensitivity analyses were performed to explore the robustness of the results.
RESULTS: Compared with anlotinib, pembrolizumab and nivolumab were estimated to 
gain an additional 0.18 and 0.10 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) at an 
incremental cost of $10,446 and $5,182, resulting in an increment cost-utility 
ratio (ICUR) of $58,221/QALY and $56,733/QALY. The sensitivity analyses showed 
that the likelihood of anlotinib being cost-effective was 87.5% to 99.9% at a 
willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of $11,144 to $33,431/QALY. The scenario 
analyses indicated that the results varied in different scenarios.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that anlotinib could be the most 
cost-effective option versus pembrolizumab and nivolumab in the third-line 
treatment of recurrent SCLC from the Chinese healthcare system perspective.

OBJECTIVES: Postoperative recurrence in patients with non-small-cell lung 
carcinoma (NSCLC) is a major issue for life expectancy. Programmed cell death 
ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression on tumor cells is important in the prognosis of 
NSCLC. However, the predictive ability of PD-L1 evaluated with archived surgical 
specimens for nivolumab treatment have remained unknown. This study was aimed to 
analyze the predictive ability of the PD-L1 tumor proportion score (TPS) for 
nivolumab response in patients with NSCLC experiencing a postoperative 
recurrence using archived surgical specimens.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective cohort study involved patients with 
advanced NSCLC (N = 78) treated with nivolumab between April 2016 and September 
2018. They were categorized into postoperative recurrence (N = 24) and 
non-postoperative recurrence (N = 54) groups. The predictive ability of PD-L1 
TPS for response to nivolumab treatment in these two groups was determined using 
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Additionally, we evaluated the 
predictive ability of PD-L1 TPS using rebiopsy specimens collected from the 
recurrent lesions in six patients of the postoperative recurrence group.
RESULTS: PD-L1 TPS exhibited lower predictive performance in the postoperative 
recurrent group (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.58) compared with that in the 
non-post operative recurrent group (AUC = 0.81). Furthermore, PD-L1 TPS was 
significantly increased in rebiopsy specimens. The predictive performance of 
PD-L1 TPS in these specimens was higher (AUC = 0.90) than that in the archived 
surgical specimens.
CONCLUSION: The study revealed that archived surgical specimens are inadequate 
for assessing the predictive ability of PD-L1 for nivolumab response, while 
rebiopsy specimens are adequate.

Little is known about the impact of early palliative care (EPC) combined with 
motivational interviewing (MI) for persons living with AIDS (PWA). We compared 
the cost and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) of EPC + MI (n = 61) versus 
usual care (UC) (n = 60) for patients with AIDS, not on antiretroviral 
medications, enrolled into the Living Well Project trial. Data on clinic, 
emergency department, and hospital visits were collected through self-report and 
billing records. Risk-adjusted average annual health care costs were estimated 
using a generalized linear model with a gamma log-link function. QALYs were 
calculated using the SF-12v2. Cost-effectiveness was defined as cost per QALY 
gained. Estimated intervention costs were $165 per participant. EPC + MI reduced 
costs by 33% (AOR = 0.67; CI 95%: 0.15, 0.93). QALYs did not differ between 
groups. Results suggest EPC + MI for PWA is cost-saving and maintains quality of 
life compared to UC due to reduced hospital and ED costs.

INTRODUCTION: There is controversy on whether to use incremental monetary net 
benefit (INMB) or incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) in health economic 
evaluations alongside randomized controlled trials. We studied the impact of 
restricted mean survival time (RMST) on the long-term projection of INMB and 
ICER.
METHODS: We analyzed the unbiasedness and efficiency of ICER and INMB by (1) 
deriving the metrics' expected values and variances based on theoretical 
probability distributions, (2) simulating their 15-year post-trial projections 
based on between-arm-RMST-gained through a 2 × 4 × 2 factorial experiment of 
Markov 2-state microsimulations. Simulations and comparison were run on the data 
from the Cardiovascular Outcomes for People Using Anticoagulation Strategies 
Study (COMPASS).
RESULTS: Our simulation findings using RMST showed that ICER was more efficient 
than INMB, regardless of disease populations, time horizon, modeling choices, 
and underlying probability distributions of incremental mean cost and effect. 
ICER had a small variance and thus showed its robustness to the choices of 
models.
CONCLUSION: INMB's variance varies with a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold 
quadratically while ICER's variance with a WTP threshold value quadratically 
while ICER's variance with incremental-mean-cost quadratically. A simple and 
naïve model can sufficiently estimate ICER. Future metrics are expected to be 
health-economic-meaningful, unambiguous, unbiased, efficient, and 
statistical-inference-friendly.

BACKGROUND: Radiofrequency ablation is an emerging technology in the United 
States to treat benign thyroid nodules. The cost-effectiveness of radiofrequency 
ablation in comparison with traditional thyroidectomy is unknown.
METHODS: A patient-level state transition microsimulation decision model was 
constructed comparing radiofrequency ablation with lobectomy in the management 
of benign thyroid nodules. Our base case was a 45-year-old woman with a solitary 
30-cm3 nodule. Estimates of health utilities, complications, and mortality were 
obtained from the literature, and costs were estimated using Medicare 
reimbursement data. The primary outcomes of interest included total cost, 
quality-adjusted life years, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. All 
model estimates were subjected to 1-way sensitivity analyses to identify factors 
that strongly influence cost-effectiveness. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis 
was run across 1 million simulations to gauge outcome confidence with a 
willingness-to-pay threshold set at $100,000/quality-adjusted life year.
RESULTS: Radiofrequency ablation was assumed to cost $5,000, with an initial 
success rate of 78%. Patients with volume reduction ratio <50% underwent a 
second treatment of radiofrequency ablation. Radiofrequency ablation represented 
the dominant strategy, yielding 21.31 quality-adjusted life years for a total 
cost of $16,563 in comparison to lobectomy, which yielded 21.13 quality-adjusted 
life years for a total cost of $19,262. In a 1-way sensitivity analysis varying 
the cost of radiofrequency ablation across of range of values, the 
radiofrequency ablation strategy remained cost-effective until the cost of 
radiofrequency ablation exceeded $12,330 at willingness-to-pay $50,000 or 
$17,950 at willingness-to-pay $100,000.
CONCLUSION: Radiofrequency ablation is a cost-effective strategy in the 
treatment of benign thyroid nodules but is most sensitive to the cost of 
radiofrequency ablation.

PURPOSE: Life expectancy continues to increase for patients with brain 
metastases treated with stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). The present study 
sought to retrospectively analyze brain metastasis patients who have survived 
2 years or more, and assess for what factors may predict for a final brain 
metastasis velocity (BMV) of zero.
METHODS: This was a single-institution retrospective study of 300 patients 
treated with SRS from 2001 to 2019 for brain metastases who survived greater 
than 2 years after first SRS. Final BMV is calculated by summing all metastases 
through the observed time divided by the total time in years. A BMV of zero is 
defined as at least 2 years of imaging follow-up without distant brain failure 
(DBF).
RESULTS: Median age at first SRS is 61 (IQR: 53, 70). Kaplan-Meier estimated 
median overall survival is 4.9 years and time to DBF is 1.5 years (95% CI 1.2, 
2.0). Twenty-eight (9.3%) patients underwent subsequent WBRT. One hundred and 
one (33.7%) patients never had any further brain metastases (BMV = 0) at a 
median follow-up time of 3.3 years. Median BMV is 0.4 (IQR: 0, 1.4). Distant 
brain failures reach a plateau at 4 years where the cumulative incidence of DBF 
is 82%. 70% of first time DBFs have occurred by 2 years. Factors significantly 
associated with a BMV of zero include fewer brain metastases at first SRS (HR 
1.1; p = 0.0004) and Caucasian race (HR 1.5; p = 0.03).
CONCLUSION: Approximately one third of brain metastasis patients who live beyond 
2 years after initial SRS have a BMV of zero. DBFs appear to reach a plateau at 
4 years. Factors significantly associated with a BMV of zero include Caucasian 
race and having had a single brain metastasis at first SRS.

BACKGROUND: The GLORIA placebo-controlled trial found a favorable balance of 
benefit and harm for two years of prednisolone (5 mg/day) as add-on treatment 
for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients aged 65+. This study evaluated the 
cost-effectiveness of low-dose prednisolone in the treatment of RA.
METHODS: The economic evaluation had a societal perspective with a time horizon 
of two years. Cost data were collected with questionnaires and from recorded 
events, and valued with standard Dutch unit prices of 2017. The primary 
effectiveness outcome was the disease activity score in 28 joints (DAS28). For 
cost-utility, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were estimated from the 
EuroQol-5 Dimension (EQ-5D) questionnaire. Bootstrapping assessed the 
uncertainty around the average differences in costs and health outcomes.
RESULTS: In total, 444 of 451 randomized patients were included in the modified 
intention-to-treat analysis. Patients had median four active comorbidities at 
baseline. Mean total costs over two years were k€10.8 in the prednisolone group, 
k€0.5 (95% CI -4.0; 1.8) lower than in the placebo group. Total direct medical 
costs were k€0.5 (95% CI -4.0; 1.5) lower in the prednisolone group. The mean 
number of QALYs was similar in both groups (difference 0.02 [-0.03; 0.06] in 
favor of prednisolone). The DAS28 was 0.38 lower in the prednisolone group than 
in the placebo group (0.19; 0.56).
CONCLUSION: With greater effectiveness (DAS28) at non-significantly lower costs, 
low-dose, add-on prednisolone is cost-effective for RA compared to placebo over 
two years. QALYs were equal in both groups, most likely due to the impact of 
multiple comorbidities.

Osteoporotic fractures are a common and serious health problem for older adults 
living in nursing homes (NHs). Risk of fracture increases with age and dementia 
status, yet gaps in evidence result in controversies around when to start and 
stop treatment for osteoporosis in NH residents, particularly those who have 
high fracture risk but have limited life expectancy. In this article, we discuss 
these areas of controversy. We provide an overview of current guidelines that 
explicitly address osteoporosis treatment strategies for NH residents, review 
the evidence for osteoporosis medications in NH residents, and use these sources 
to suggest practical recommendations for clinical practice and for research. 
Three published guidelines (from the United States, Canada, and Australia) and 
several studies provide the current basis for clinical decisions about 
osteoporosis treatment for NH residents. Practical approaches may include broad 
use of vitamin D and selective use of osteoporosis medication based on risks, 
benefits, and goals of care. Clinicians still lack strong evidence to guide 
treatment of NH residents with advanced dementia, multimorbidity, or severe 
mobility impairment. Future priorities for research include identifying optimal 
approaches to risk stratification and prevention strategies for NH residents and 
evaluating the risk-benefit profile of pharmacologic treatments for osteoporosis 
NH residents across key clinical strata. In the absence of such evidence, 
decisions for initiating and continuing treatment should reflect a 
patient-centered approach that incorporates life expectancy, goals of care, and 
the potential burden of treatment.

Australia's First Nations Peoples, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, have 
reduced life expectancy compared to the wider community. Cardiovascular 
diseases, mainly driven by ischaemic heart disease, are the leading contributors 
to this disparity. Despite over a third of First Nations Peoples living in New 
South Wales, the bulk of the peer-reviewed literature is from Central Australia 
and Far North Queensland. Regardless of the site of publication, First Nations 
Peoples are significantly younger at disease onset and have higher rates of 
comorbidities, in turn driving adverse health events. On top of this, very few 
First Nations Peoples specific cardiovascular interventions or programs have 
been shown to improve outcomes. The traditional biomedical model of care is less 
efficacious and non-traditional models of communication such as clinical yarning 
may benefit both clinicians and patients. The key purpose of this review is to 
highlight the deficiencies of our knowledge of cardiovascular burden of disease 
for First Nations Peoples; and to serve as a catalyst for more dedicated 
research. We need to have relationships with communities and concentrate on 
community improvement and partnerships. By involving First Nations Peoples 
researchers in collaboration with local communities in all levels of health care 
design and intervention will improve outcomes.

PURPOSE: The purpose of this first-in-human study was to evaluate the effect of 
a polycarbonate anatomical meniscus prosthesis system, including the surgical 
procedure, on knee pain and describe potential adverse events in patients with 
post-meniscectomy pain syndrome.
METHODS: Eleven patients with post-meniscectomy pain syndrome and limited 
underlying cartilage damage were enrolled in the study. Five received a medial 
polycarbonate urethane meniscus prosthesis which was clicked onto 2 titanium 
screws fixated at the native horn attachments on the tibia. The KOOS score was 
planned to be collected at baseline and at 3, 6, 12 and 24 months following the 
intervention including radiographs at 6, 12 and 24 months. MRI scans were 
repeated after 12 and 24 months.
RESULTS: The surgical technique to select an appropriately sized implant and 
correct positioning of the fixation screws and meniscus prosthesis onto the 
tibia was demonstrated to be feasible and reproducible. Inclusion stopped after 
5 patients because of serious adverse device-related events. All patients 
reported knee joint stiffness and slight effusion in their knee at 6 months 
follow-up. In 3 patients the implant was removed because of implant failure and 
in 1 patient the implant was removed because of persistent pain and extension 
limitation. In none of the patients did the KOOS score improve in the first 
6 months after surgery. However, in the patient who still has the implant in 
situ, PROMs started to improve 1 year after surgery and this improvement 
continued through 2 years of follow-up. The KOOS Pain, symptoms and ADL were 
close to the maximal 100 points. KOOS QoL and sport did improve but remained 
suboptimal.
CONCLUSION: This first version of the meniscus prosthesis led to impaired knee 
function and failed in four out of five patients. The patients where the 
prosthesis was removed were salvable and the PROMs returned to pre-study levels. 
The results in the patient where the device is still in place are promising.
LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level II.

BACKGROUND: Tofacitinib is an oral small molecule Janus kinase inhibitor for the 
treatment of ulcerative colitis (UC). The tofacitinib OCTAVE clinical program 
included phase III induction (OCTAVE Induction 1 and 2) and maintenance (OCTAVE 
Sustain) studies, and an open-label, long-term extension study (OCTAVE Open).
OBJECTIVE: This post hoc analysis assessed selected long-term, disease-specific 
patient-reported outcome (PRO) and health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL) 
measurements in patients with UC receiving tofacitinib in the OCTAVE clinical 
program.
METHODS: Analyses included patients from OCTAVE Open assigned to tofacitinib 
5 mg twice daily (subpopulation in remission at Week 52 of OCTAVE Sustain). 
OCTAVE Open data from the final analyses are shown to Month 48. Endpoints 
included rectal bleeding subscore (RBS) = 0, stool frequency subscore (SFS) ≤ 1, 
and HRQoL measure, Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ) remission 
(IBDQ total score ≥ 170); with non-responder imputation for missing data at all 
visits, and last observation carried forward for visits after a patient advanced 
to the next study (NRI-LOCF). Observed cases were also assessed.
RESULTS: At Month 48, of 175 patients, 95 (54.3%) and 96 (54.9%) 
achieved/maintained RBS = 0 and SFS ≤ 1, respectively (NRI-LOCF). Additionally, 
93 (53.1%) patients achieved/maintained IBDQ remission at Month 48 (NRI-LOCF).
CONCLUSIONS: Among patients who entered OCTAVE Open in remission, most 
maintained normalization of rectal bleeding and improvement in stool frequency 
for ≤ 4 years of follow-up in OCTAVE Open. IBDQ remission was also generally 
maintained in OCTAVE Open. These data show robust maintenance of key UC PROs and 
durability of response with tofacitinib 5 mg twice daily.
