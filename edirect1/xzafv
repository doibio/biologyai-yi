A Pre-hospital Emergency Medical Service (PHEMS) is a vital component of a 
country's health service because it provides early medical care to critically 
ill and injured persons in the field There is evidence to show that early care 
reduces mortality and morbidity and offers the patient the best chance of 
survival and improved quality of life. Caribbean territories have been 
developing their PHEMS as part of a programme of health sector reform. In a 
study of PHEMS in 12 Caribbean countries, the Pan American Health Organization 
reported that there were no clear guidelines with respect to the roles and 
responsibilities of the physician in PHEMS in the majority of countries. In 
fact, a few countries had services where there was no direct physician 
involvement. We present a brief review of the internationally recognized roles 
and responsibilities of physicians in PHEMS, and make recommendations with 
particular reference to the Caribbean. We suggest that there is a need for 
direct and active involvement of physicians in the development of PHEMS because 
the Emergency Medical Technician is recognized as an extension of the physician 
in the field and is supposed to be protected by the physician's licence to 
deliver medical care.

Biochemistry and biology of ARHI (DIRAS3), an imprinted tumor suppressor gene 
whose expression is lost in ovarian and breast cancers.

Jr.

ARHI is a maternally imprinted tumor suppressor gene that is downregulated in 
60% of ovarian and breast cancers. Loss of ARHI expression is associated with 
tumor progression in breast cancer and decreased disease-free survival in 
ovarian cancer. ARHI encodes a 26-kDa protein with 55-62% homology to Ras and 
Rap. In contrast to Ras, ARHI inhibits growth, motility, and invasion. ARHI 
contains a unique 34 amino-acid extension at its N-terminus and differs from Ras 
in residues critical for GTPase activity and for its putative effector function. 
Deletion of ARHI's unique N-terminal extension markedly reduces its inhibitory 
effect on cell growth. The gene maps to chromosome 1p31 at a site of LOH in 40% 
of ovarian and breast cancers. Mutations have not been detected, but the 
remaining allele is silenced by methylation in approximately 10-15 % of cases. 
In the remaining cancers, ARHI is downregulated by transcriptional mechanisms 
that involve E2F1 and E2F4, as well as by the loss of RNA binding proteins that 
decrease the half-life of ARHI mRNA. Transgenic expression of human ARHI in mice 
produces small stature, induces ovarian atrophy, and prevents postpartum milk 
production. Reexpression of ARHI in cancer cells inhibits signaling through 
Ras/Map and PI3 kinase, upregulates P21(WAF1/CIP1), downregulates cyclin D1, 
induces JNK, and inhibits signaling through STAT3. Marked overexpression of ARHI 
with a dual adenoviral vector induces caspase-independent, calpain-dependent 
apoptosis. When ARHI is expressed from a doxycycline-inducible promoter at more 
physiological levels, autophagy is induced, rather than apoptosis. Growth of 
ovarian and breast cancer xenografts is reversibly suppressed by ARHI, but 
expression of the NTD mutant produced only a limited inhibitory effect on growth 
of xenografts.

Research and educational approaches to reducing health disparities among 
American Indians and Alaska Natives.

Warne D(1).

Author information:
(1)Indian Legal Program, Arizona State University, USA.

Research and educational programs have the potential to improve health care. 
American Indians (AIs) suffer from considerable health disparities as compared 
with the general U.S. population, including significantly higher incidence and 
prevalence of preventable diseases like diabetes, alcoholism, and their 
complications. Underfunding of health programs, including the Indian Health 
Service, and lower socioeconomic status among AIs contribute to these 
disparities. Improvements in disease prevention and treatment potentially 
offered by research and health education programs could help to reduce health 
disparities. However, a history of nonparticipation in the research process and 
a history of dishonest research practices have raised barriers to conducting 
research in AI communities. Additional barriers are generated from a shortage of 
AI researchers and health care professionals. A research paradigm that includes 
the community as a full partner is necessary to promote research and education 
in AI communities and to translate health research into reductions in health 
disparities.

USA. nstout@hsph.harvard.edu

BACKGROUND: Many guidelines recommend screening mammography every 1-2 years for 
women older than 40 years; more than 70% of women now participate in routine 
screening. No studies have examined the societal impact of screening practices 
over the past decade in the United States on costs and quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs). We performed a retrospective cost-effectiveness analysis 
comparing actual and alternative screening mammography scenarios.
METHODS: We used a discrete-event simulation model of breast cancer epidemiology 
to estimate the costs and the number of QALYs that were associated with observed 
screening mammography patterns in the United States from 1990 to 2000 for women 
aged 40 years or older. We also estimated costs and QALYS for no screening and 
for 64 alternative screening scenarios. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios 
were computed. Sensitivity analyses were performed on key parameters.
RESULTS: Actual U.S. screening patterns from 1990 to 2000 accrued 947.5 million 
QALYs and cost $166 billion over the lifetimes of the screened women, resulting 
in a gain of 1.7 million QALYs for an additional cost of $62.5 billion compared 
with no screening. Among those polices that were not dominated--i.e., for which 
no alternative existed that produced more QALYs for lower costs--screening all 
women aged 40-80 years annually per some U.S. guidelines was the most expensive 
option, costing $58,000 per additional QALY gained compared with the next most 
costly alternative, screening all women aged 45-80 years annually. Many 
alternative screening scenarios generated more QALYs for less cost (with savings 
up to $6 billion) than actual screening patterns over the study period. 
Sensitivity analysis showed that conclusions about the cost-effectiveness of 
screening mammography policies were highly sensitive to small, short-term 
detrimental effects on quality of life from the screening test itself.
CONCLUSIONS: Choosing among the efficient policies to guide current screening 
recommendations requires consideration of costs to promote participation in 
screening and measurement of acute quality-of-life effects of mammography.

Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction in females: a comparison of hamstring 
tendon and patellar tendon autografts.

Siebold R(1), Webster KE, Feller JA, Sutherland AG, Elliott J.

Author information:
(1)Musculoskeletal Research Centre, La Trobe University, Melbourne, VIC 3086, 
Australia.

This study compared hamstring (HS) and patellar tendon (PT) anterior cruciate 
ligament (ACL) reconstruction in females. Sixty-five patients (43 HS, 22 PT) 
were evaluated at a mean 3.8-year postoperatively. Evaluation included IKDC 
2000, SF-36, Cincinnati sports activity scores, anterior knee pain (AKP), 
kneeling pain, range of motion and anterior knee laxity. One PT patient 
sustained a traumatic graft rupture. There were no differences between the two 
grafts in terms of anterior knee laxity or IKDC scores. The HS group had higher 
sports activity scores and higher scores on the Physical Functioning and General 
Health subscales of the SF-36. Despite no difference in AKP, there was greater 
kneeling pain in the PT patients, who also had greater extension deficits. Both 
HS and PT are satisfactory ACL grafts in females, but HS grafts were associated 
with less morbidity, greater return to preinjury level of activity and higher 
quality of life scores.

Pharmacoeconomic analysis of adjuvant therapy with exemestane, anastrozole, 
letrozole or tamoxifen in postmenopausal women with operable and estrogen 
receptor-positive breast cancer.

OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficiency of adjuvant therapy with aromatase 
inhibitors or with tamoxifen in postmenopausal women with operable breast cancer 
and positive estrogen receptors.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A cost-utility analysis was performed based on a Markov 
model, from the Spanish National Health Care System perspective, comparing the 
treatment with exemestane (EXE: 25 mg/day) or tamoxifen (TAM: 20 mg/day) after 
2-3 years of monotherapy with TAM; anastrozole (ANA, 1 mg/day) or TAM (20 
mg/day) without previous TAM therapy; and letrozole (LET: 2.5 mg/day) or placebo 
after 5 years of monotherapy with TAM. The follow-up of a hypothetical cohort of 
women starting treatment at 63 years of age was simulated during 10 and 20 
years. The probabilities of transition between health states and quality 
adjusted life years (QALYs) were obtained from the literature, and the unit 
costs (euro corresponding to 2004) from a Spanish database.
RESULTS: After 10 and 20 years of follow-up, more QALYs per patient would be 
gained with the EXE scheme (0.230-0.286 and 0.566-0.708, respectively) than with 
ANA (0.114 and 0.285) and LET (0.176 and 0.474). The cost of gaining one QALY 
was lower with the EXE scheme (50,801-62,522 euro and 28,849- 35,371 euro, 
respectively) than with ANA (104,272 euro and 62,477 euro) and LET (91,210 euro 
and 49,460 euro). The result was stable for the cost per life-year gained (LYG) 
and in the sensitivity analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: The EXE scheme after TAM is more cost-effective than the ANA and 
LET schemes.

Co-morbidity in prostate cancer.

Wirth MP(1), Froehner M.

Author information:
(1)Department of Urology, University Clinics 'Carl Gustav Carus', Technical 
University of Dresden, Dresden, Germany.

With the widespread use of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening, prostate 
cancer has become the mostly common diagnosed malignancy in the United States. 
Because prostate cancer preferably affects elderly males and usually progresses 
slowly, there is an increasing interest in the significance of co-morbid 
conditions complicating the course of the disease. Several scores have been 
applied to assess the co-morbidity in newly diagnosed prostate cancer patients 
and to estimate the impact of concomitant diseases on survival. Patients in 
their eighth decade of life, diagnosed with well or moderately differentiated 
localized prostate cancer and suffering from severe co-morbidity, are likely to 
die of causes other than the malignancy. Clinical trials evaluating different 
treatment modalities for localized prostate cancer need controlling and 
stratification for age and co-morbidity. The life expectancy of patients with 
only one controlled concomitant disorder, however, is not significantly 
compromised and the management of these patients remains controversial.

BACKGROUND: PROCARE, a Belgian multidisciplinary project on rectal cancer (RC), 
will be launched in 2006. Guidelines have been developed, but remain to be 
implemented.
AIM: A population-based study on RC treatment and outcome in Belgium and 
comparison with recent international benchmarks in order to better define 
targets that should be reached.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Anonymous data of 3079 patients with rectal cancer 
registered in the National Cancer Registry in 1997 and 1998 were analysed. 
Observed (OS) and relative survival (RS) were compared with figures from 
nationwide projects and multi-centre studies.
RESULTS: The 5-yr OS and RS were 46.6% and 58.5%, respectively. For patients 
with stage I-III tumours 5-yr OS was 57.1% and 5-yr RS 70.1%. Adjuvant or 
neo-adjuvant treatment was given in 54.8% stage II-III patients who were < 70 
years old. There were marked differences between the provinces in the use of 
radiotherapy for stage II-III patients and in 5-yr RS for all stages. In stage 
IV, the median OS was 13 months and the 2-yr OS was 28%. Comparison with recent 
multi-centre trials indicates significant potential benefits from the PROCARE 
project: an absolute increase of the 5-yr OS by 10 to 20% after 
chemoradiotherapy and TME in stage II-III patients 75 years old or less, a 
7-month increase of the median OS and an absolute 15% increase of the 2-yr OS in 
unresectable stage IV patients with combined chemotherapy.
CONCLUSION: Significant improvement seems to be achievable. Implementation of 
the PROCARE guidelines with quality assurance through prospective registration 
in a specific database, however, is a crucial prerequisite for credible audit of 
performance and feedback to individual teams.

The Egypt Human Development Report 2003 does not take account of the impact of 
the environment on human development indicators. A case study was made in one 
village in El-Montaza district, Alexandria governorate, Egypt. The environmental 
indicators used for calculating the human development index were access to safe 
water, access to sanitation and environment surrounding the house. The human 
development index for this village decreased from 0.622 to 0.595 after 
adjustment for environmental factors.

OBJECTIVES: To assess mortality, quality of life (QOL), and quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs) for critically ill elderly patients.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey.
SETTING: A ten-bed medical-surgical intensive care unit (ICU) in a tertiary care 
university hospital.
PATIENTS: The study group included 882 elderly patients (> or =65 yrs of age) 
and 1,827 controls (<65 yrs of age) treated during the period of 1995 to 2000.
INTERVENTION: None.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Mortality was assessed during the ICU and 
hospital stays, and 12, 24, and 36 months after ICU discharge. The cumulative 
3-yr mortality rate among the elderly (57%) was higher (p < .05) than that among 
the controls (40%). The majority (66%) of the elderly nonsurvivors died within 1 
month after intensive care discharge. All elderly patients with day-1 Sequential 
Organ Failure (SOFA) scores >15 died during the ICU stay. QOL was assessed with 
EQ-5D and RAND-36 measures from 10 months to 7 yrs after discharge. The majority 
(88%) of the elderly survivors assessed their present health state as good or 
satisfactory; 66% found it to be similar or better than 12 months earlier, and 
48% similar or better than their preadmission state. QOL measures by RAND-36 
revealed that aging decreased their competencies most in physical functioning, 
physical role limitations, and vitality, but the elderly had better values in 
mental health than the controls. However, QALYs of the elderly respondents were 
21% to 35% lower than the mean QALY minus 2 sd units of the age- and 
gender-adjusted general population.
CONCLUSIONS: High age alone is not a valid reason to refuse intensive care, but 
the benefits perceived by intensive care seem to decrease with aging, if 
reflected as QALYs. However, 97% of the elderly survivors lived at home and 88% 
of them considered their QOL satisfactory or good after hospital discharge. 
Therefore, more reliable information on the outcome for the elderly is clearly 
needed.

Neonatal screening for glutaric aciduria type I: strategies to proceed.

Acute encephalopathic crisis in glutaric aciduria type I results in an 
unfavourable disease course and poor outcome, dominated by dystonia, feeding 
problems, seizures and reduced life expectancy. A conditio sine qua non for the 
prevention of irreversible brain damage is timely diagnosis and start of 
therapy, i.e. before the onset of neurological disease. As there are no specific 
clinical signs or symptoms that allow a reliable detection of these patients 
before the manifestation of encephalopathic crises, neonatal screening 
programmes for glutaric aciduria type I have been established in some countries 
using analysis of glutarylcarnitine in dried blood spots by tandem mass 
spectrometry. This article summarizes recent strategies, pitfalls and 
shortcomings of mass screening for glutaric aciduria type I, focusing on the 
relevant risk of missing patients with a mild biochemical phenotype (i.e. low 
excretors). Furthermore, it evaluates a binary strategy--using glutarylcarnitine 
as primary variable and glutarylcarnitine/acylcarnitine ratios as secondary 
variable--to improve the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of neonatal 
screening for glutaric aciduria type I. An optimization of diagnostic as well as 
therapeutic procedures must be achieved before screening for glutaric aciduria 
type I can be regarded as reliable and beneficial for all patients.

Curie Hospice, Hampstead.

BACKGROUND: Provision of palliative care for patients with non-cancer conditions 
is hindered by the difficulty of predicting when people will die and fear of 
causing distress by raising end-of-life issues.
OBJECTIVES: To compare patients' and professionals' (1) estimations of 
prognosis; (2) perceptions of the seriousness of the illness and needs for 
supportive care; and (3) acceptability of this sensitive research, in end-stage 
cancer and non-cancer diseases.
DESIGN: Prospective cohort study.
SETTING: A teaching hospital and a Marie Curie hospice in London.
SUBJECTS: Twenty patients with advanced non-malignant disease (heart failure, 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and renal failure) and 20 patients with 
advanced cancer, and their physicians in charge.
METHOD: A feasibility study using vignettes to aid patients and doctors estimate 
of prognoses. Main outcome measures were (1) patients' and physicians' estimates 
of health status, care needs and prognosis; and (2) patient survival.
RESULTS: Patients were willing and able to estimate their own life expectancy 
and cancer patients correctly estimated that they had a poorer prognosis than 
non-cancer patients. Non-cancer patients perceived that they had similar needs 
for supportive care as cancer patients. Physicians made little distinction in 
palliative care needs between patients with and without cancer, but tended to 
make more pessimistic estimates of prognosis in non-cancer patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients are able to judge their health status and life expectancy 
and do not object to questions about end-of-life care. Cancer and non-cancer 
patients have similar needs for supportive care. We need further evidence on the 
value of self-rated prognosis and how to provide palliative and supportive care 
for all patients who are near death.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to provide data on the use of 
immunomodulatory therapies in a population comprising all treated patients with 
relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) in Denmark.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: From the introduction of immunomodulatory therapy in 
Denmark in 1996 through 2003, all patients that started immunomodulatory therapy 
were followed prospectively with neurological examination and standard 
laboratory tests every six months, and clinical data were reported to the MS 
Treatment Register, including relapses, Expanded Disability Status Scale scores 
and side effects.
RESULTS: From 1996 through 2003 in all 2393 patients had started 
immunomodulatory therapy for RRMS, of whom 1252 (52.3%) were still on therapy 
with the same product at follow-up on 1 January 2005, whereas 1141 patients had 
discontinued or changed immunomodulatory therapy. Multiple Cox regression 
analysis of the risk of suffering a relapse showed a hazard ratio of 1.48 in 
patients with three or more relapses in the 24 months prior to onset compared 
with patients with two relapses or less; the hazard ratio was 0.84 in patients 
with age 238 years at treatment start compared with patients of age <38, and 
1.17 for females compared with males. For disease progression the hazard ratio 
was 1.24 for age =38 years compared with age 2 37 years. Significant differences 
were observed in the hazard ratios between the different preparations, probably 
due to selection bias.
CONCLUSION: The response to immunomodulatory therapy can be predicted to some 
extent from demographic variables. Differences between preparations can mainly 
be ascribed to selection bias, and open studies are not suited for comparison of 
efficacy between different preparations.

Endoscopic screening for gastric cancer.

Singapore.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Population endoscopic screening for gastric cancer is 
generally deemed not to be cost-effective except in Japan, where its prevalence 
is very high. However, in the absence of screening, patients present with 
advanced disease, and prognosis is poor. We conducted a cost utility analysis to 
determine whether endoscopic screening for stomach cancer in intermediate-risk 
population would be cost-effective and to better define the high-risk groups in 
the population who would benefit from such strategy.
METHODS: Cost-effectiveness analysis was performed by using a Markov Model. 
Simulation was performed on Singapore (intermediate-risk) population and various 
high-risk subgroups. Comparison was made between 2-yearly endoscopic mass 
screening program versus no screening. Data sources were extracted from relevant 
studies published from 1980-2004 identified via systematic PUBMED search. Main 
outcome measures were deaths caused by stomach cancer averted, cost per life 
saved, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio expressed as cost per 
quality-adjusted life year (QALY) saved.
RESULTS: Screening of high-risk group of Chinese men (age-standardized rate, 
25.9/100,000) from 50-70 years old is highly cost-effective, with cost benefit 
of United States $26,836 per QALY. Screening this cohort of 199,000 subjects 
prevents 743 stomach cancer deaths and saves 8234 absolute life years. Cost of 
averting 1 cancer death is United States $247,600. Cost-effectiveness was most 
sensitive to incidence of stomach cancer and cost of screening endoscopy.
CONCLUSIONS: Screening of stomach cancer in moderate to high-risk population 
subgroups is cost-effective. Targeted screening strategies for stomach cancer 
should be explored.

BACKGROUND: A multinational trial (APRICOT) showed that peginterferon alfa-2a 
(40kDa) plus ribavirin is efficacious for treatment of HIV-HCV co-infection. The 
cost-effectiveness of treating these patients with peginterferon 
alfa-2a/ribavirin has yet to be explored from a US societal perspective.
OBJECTIVE: To predict the cost-effectiveness of peginterferon alfa-2a/ribavirin 
with interferon/ribavirin (IFN/RBV) or no treatment in HIV-HCV co-infected 
patients.
STUDY DESIGN: A Markov model was constructed with liver progression estimates 
based on published literature. Sustained virological response and baseline 
characteristics of the reference case were based on APRICOT. Quality of life and 
costs in 2004 US dollars (US$) were based on literature estimates and discounted 
at 3%.
RESULTS: Peginterferon alfa-2a/ribavirin compared with IFN/RBV or no treatment 
is predicted to increase quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) by 0.73 and 0.94 
years, respectively, in HCV-genotype-1 patients. The incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio of peginterferon alfa-2a/ribavirin compared with 
IFN/RBV and no treatment for all patients is respectively US$ 2,082 and 
5,187/QALY gained.
CONCLUSIONS: Anti-HCV treatment is predicted to decrease the risk of cirrhosis 
and increase quality-adjusted survival of HIV-HCV co-infected patients compared 
with IFN/RBV and no treatment. Peginterferon alfa-2a/ribavirin's cost per QALY 
gained relative to these options falls within the cost-effectiveness level of 
many health technologies commonly adopted in the US.

Comment in
    Am J Ophthalmol. 2007 Jan;143(1):191-2; author reply 192-3.

PURPOSE: The Ocular Hypertension Treatment Study (OHTS) demonstrated that 
medical treatment of people with intraocular pressure (IOP) of > or =24 mm Hg 
reduces the risk of the development of primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) by 
60%. There is no consensus on which people with ocular hypertension would 
benefit from treatment.
DESIGN: Cost-utility analysis with the use of a Markov model.
METHODS: We modeled a hypothetic cohort of people with IOP of > or =24 mm Hg. 
Four treatment thresholds were considered: (1) Treat no one; (2) treat people 
with a > or =5% annual risk of the development of POAG; (3) treat people with a 
> or =2% annual risk of the development of POAG, and (4) treat everyone. The 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was evaluated.
RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for treatment of people with 
ocular hypertension were 3670 US dollars per quality adjusted life-year (QALY) 
for the Treat > or =5% threshold and 42,430 US dollars/QALY for the Treat > or 
=2% threshold. "Treat everyone" cost more and was less effective than other 
options. Assuming a cost-effectiveness threshold of 50,000 to 100,000 US 
dollars/QALY, the Treat > or =2% threshold would result in the most net health 
benefit. The decision was sensitive to the incidence of POAG without treatment, 
treatment effectiveness, and the utility loss because of POAG.
CONCLUSION: Although the treatment of individual patients is largely dependent 
on their attitude toward the risk of disease progression and blindness, the 
treatment of those patients with IOP of > or =24 mm Hg and a > or =2% annual 
risk of the development of glaucoma is likely to be cost-effective. Delay of 
treatment for all people with ocular hypertension until glaucoma-related 
symptoms are present appears to be unnecessarily conservative.

The life expectancy of people who have perinatally acquired cerebral palsy can 
be similar to that of the general population, or it can be reduced 
substantially. The most important factors that are associated with reduced 
survival are disabilities of motor, cognitive, or visual functions. Prematurity 
and low birth weight are associated with lower rates of disability, and better 
survival. A 2-year-old who has severe cerebral palsy has about a 40% chance of 
living to age 20, in contrast to a child who has mild cerebral palsy, for whom 
the chance is 99%. Cerebral palsy, respiratory diseases, epilepsy, and 
congenital malformation are the most commonly recorded causes of early death.

Evolutionary analysis of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate metabolism.

Fructose 2,6-bisphosphate is a potent metabolic regulator in eukaryotic 
organisms; it affects the activity of key enzymes of the glycolytic and 
gluconeogenic pathways. The enzymes responsible for its synthesis and 
hydrolysis, 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase (PFK-2) and fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase 
(FBPase-2) are present in representatives of all major eukaryotic taxa. Results 
from a bioinformatics analysis of genome databases suggest that very early in 
evolution, in a common ancestor of all extant eukaryotes, distinct genes 
encoding PFK-2 and FBPase-2, or related enzymes with broader substrate 
specificity, fused resulting in a bifunctional enzyme both domains of which had, 
or later acquired, specificity for fructose 2,6-bisphosphate. Subsequently, in 
different phylogenetic lineages duplications of the gene of the bifunctional 
enzyme occurred, allowing the development of distinct isoenzymes for expression 
in different tissues, at specific developmental stages or under different 
nutritional conditions. Independently in different lineages of many unicellular 
eukaryotes one of the domains of the different PFK-2/FBPase-2 isoforms has 
undergone substitutions of critical catalytic residues, or deletions rendering 
some enzymes monofunctional. In a considerable number of other unicellular 
eukaryotes, mainly parasitic organisms, the enzyme seems to have been lost 
altogether. Besides the catalytic core, the PFK-2/FBPase-2 has often N- and 
C-terminal extensions which show little sequence conservation. The N-terminal 
extension in particular can vary considerably in length, and seems to have 
acquired motifs which, in a lineage-specific manner, may be responsible for 
regulation of catalytic activities, by phosphorylation or ligand binding, or for 
mediating protein-protein interactions.

OBJECTIVES: To identify whether differences exist in the outcomes between 
patients undergoing hemodialysis and elderly nonhemodialysis patients with a 
femoral neck fracture.
DESIGN: Retrospective review.
SETTING: Level 1 trauma center.
PATIENTS/INTERVENTIONS: A total of 71 femoral neck fractures in 62 patients 
undergoing hemodialysis treated nonoperatively or operatively.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Clinical outcomes were analyzed to identify factors 
that may be correlated with life expectancy and functional prognosis.
RESULTS: The overall survival rates in this study at 1-year and 5-years 
postfracture were found to be 89.8% and 51.5%, respectively. There were 
significant correlations among the survival rate, patients' age, type of 
treatment, prefracture ambulation status, and prefracture activities of daily 
living status. However, using multivariate analysis, the only significant 
predictor of life expectancy was prefracture ambulation status. As for 
functional prognosis, the rates of total ambulation recovery and total 
activities of daily living recovery at 1-year postfracture were 50.0% and 71.2%, 
respectively. Both patients' age and age at the onset of hemodialysis may 
contribute considerably to functional prognosis in patients undergoing 
hemodialysis after femoral neck fracture.
CONCLUSIONS: The present study suggests that the clinical outcomes of patients 
with femoral neck fractures who undergo hemodialysis are considerably superior 
to those of previous studies. In addition, when those fractures are treated 
surgically with specific management in patients undergoing hemodialysis, it may 
be possible to expect a life expectancy and functional prognosis similar to 
elderly nonhemodialysis patients with hip fractures.

Co-infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 
is increasingly common and affects the clinical course of chronic hepatitis C. 
Highly active antiretroviral therapy has improved the life expectancy of HIV 
infected patients, but, by extending survival, it permits the development of HCV 
cirrhosis. This study tried to evaluate clinical and epidemiological features of 
patients with chronic hepatitis C co-infected with HIV. We evaluated 134 
HCV-infected patients: i) group A-- 65 co-infected HCV/HIV patients, ii) group 
B-- 69 mono-infected HCV patients. The impact of HIV infection on HCV liver 
disease was analyzed using Child's score, ultrasound findings and liver 
histology. Patients were subjected to HCV genotyping and anti-HBs dosage. 
Patients mean age was 42.4 years (+/-9.1) and 97 (72.4%) were males. Injected 
drug use and homo/bisexual practice were more frequently encountered in the 
co-infected group: 68.3% and 78.0%, respectively. Antibodies against hepatitis B 
virus (anti-HBs) were found in only 38.1% of the patients (66.7% group A x 33.3% 
group B). Ten out of 14 individuals (71.4%) who had liver disease (Child B or C) 
and 25 out of 34 (73.5%) who showed ultrasound evidence of chronic liver disease 
were in the co-infection group. HCV genotype-2/3 was more frequently encountered 
in co-infected patients (36.9% group A vs. 21.8% group B).
CONCLUSIONS: a) HIV infection seems to adversely affect the clinical course of 
chronic hepatitis C, b) injected drug use, bi/homosexual practice and 
genotype-2/3 were more frequently encountered in co-infected patients, c) 
immunization against HBV should be encouraged in these patients.

Life expectancy has increased over the last century as it had never been before. 
This is the result of a combination of many favorable variables such as level of 
education, improved socio-economic environment and development of medicine. 
However, new improvements demand heavy investment. Thus, the incorporation of 
medical technology became a health and economic issue. The pharmacoeconomic 
knowledge field is being developed to help in the analysis of medical costs and 
patient needs. The applies to hepatitic C, a common and chronic worldwide 
disease. In this article, the authors describe the rational behind this type of 
health economic analysis and review a hepatitis C model. Overall, in a 
non-Brazilian scenario, it was demonstrated that peginterferon alfa-2a (40KD) is 
cost effective in the treatment of HCV disease.

Muscle wasting during cancer and ageing share many common metabolic pathways and 
mediators. Due to the size of the population involved, both cancer cachexia and 
ageing sarcopenia may represent targets for future promising clinical 
investigations. Cancer cachexia is a syndrome characterized by a marked weight 
loss, anorexia, asthenia and anemia. In fact, many patients who die with 
advanced cancer suffer from cachexia. The degree of cachexia is inversely 
correlated with the survival time of the patient and it always implies a poor 
prognosis. In recent years, age-related diseases and disabilities have become of 
major health interest and importance. This holds particularly for muscle 
wasting, also known as sarcopenia, that decreases the quality of life of the 
geriatric population, increasing morbidity and decreasing life expectancy. More 
research should be devoted to the understanding of muscle wasting mediators 
(associated with both depletion of fat stores and muscular tissue), both in 
cancer and ageing, in particular the identification of common mediators may 
prove as a good therapeutic strategies for both prevention and treatment of 
wasting both in disease and during healthy ageing.

Outcome of quadriceps tendon repair.

Puranik GS(1), Faraj A.

Author information:
(1)Airedale General Hospital, Airedale, United Kingdom.

Complete rupture of the quadriceps tendon is a well-described injury. There is a 
scarcity of literature relating to the outcome of patients with this injury 
after surgery. We undertook a retrospective analysis of patients who had 
surgical repair of their quadriceps tendon at our institution over a 13-year
