used in a large randomized controlled trial (RCT).
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this secondary analysis study was to examine 
properties of a new measure of dignity impact.
DESIGN: Using the DIS, we conducted reanalysis of posttest data from a large 
3-arm, multi-site RCT study.
SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Participants were receiving hospice/palliative care (n = 
326, 50.6% female, mean age = 65.1 years, 89.3% white, all with a terminal 
illness with 6 months or less life expectancy). They had been randomized to 
standard palliative care (n = 111), client-centered care (n = 107), or DT (n = 
108).
MEASUREMENT: The 7-item DIS was derived from selected items in a posttest DT 
Patient Feedback Questionnaire. The DIS had strong internal consistency (α = 
0.85).
RESULTS: The DT group mean DIS score (21.4 ± 5.0) was significantly higher than 
the usual care group mean score (17.7 ± 5.5; t = 5.2, df = 216, P < .001) and a 
client-centered intervention group mean score (17.9 ± 4.9; t = 5.2, df = 213, P 
< .001).
CONCLUSION: We found that, compared to both other groups, patients who received 
DT reported significantly higher DIS ratings, which is consistent with the DT 
focus on meaning-making, preparation for death, and life completion tasks. We 
propose that the DIS be used as the primary outcome measure in evaluating the 
effects of DT.

BACKGROUND: Due to increasing life expectancy, more and more older people are 
suffering from dementia and comorbidities. To date, little information is 
available on place of death for dementia patients in Germany. In addition, the 
association of place of death and comorbidities is unknown.
METHODS: A population-based cross-sectional survey was conducted in 
Westphalia-Lippe (Germany), based on the analysis of death certificates from 
2011. Individuals with dementia ≥ 65 years were identified using the documented 
cause of death. In this context, all mentioned causes of death were included. In 
addition, ten selected comorbidities were also analyzed. The results were 
presented descriptively. Using multivariate logistic regression, place of death 
was analyzed for any association with comorbidities.
RESULTS: A total of 10,364 death certificates were analyzed. Dementia was 
recorded in 1646 cases (15.9%; mean age 86.3 ± 6.9 years; 67.3% women). On 
average, 1.5 ± 1.0 selected comorbidities were present. Places of death were 
distributed as follows: home (19.9%), hospital (28.7%), palliative care unit 
(0.4%), nursing home (49.5%), hospice (0.9%), no details (0.7%). The death 
certificates documented cardiac failure in 43.6% of cases, pneumonia in 25.2%, 
and malignant tumour in 13.4%. An increased likelihood of dying in hospital 
compared to home or nursing home, respectively, was found for the following 
comorbidities (OR [95%-CI]): pneumonia (2.96 [2.01-4.35], p = 0.001); (2.38 
[1.75-3.25], p = 0.001); renal failure (1.93 [1.26-2.97], p = 0.003); (1.65 
[1.18-2.32], p = 0.003); and sepsis (13.73 [4.88-38.63], p = 0.001); (7.34 
[4.21-12.78], p = 0.001).
CONCLUSION: The most common place of death in patients with dementia is the 
retirement or nursing home, followed by hospital and home. Specific 
comorbidities, such as pneumonia or sepsis, correlated with an increased 
probability of dying in hospital.

BACKGROUND: This study aims at quantifying the level and changes over time of 
inequality in age-specific mortality and life expectancy between the 19 
Norwegian counties from 1980 to 2014.
METHODS: Data on population and mortality by county was obtained from Statistics 
Norway for 1980-2014. Life expectancy and age-specific mortality rates (0-4, 
5-49 and 50-69 age groups) were estimated by year and county. Geographic 
inequality was described by the absolute Gini index annually.
RESULTS: Life expectancy in Norway has increased from 75.6 to 82.0 years, and 
the risk of death before the age of 70 has decreased from 26 to 14% from 1980 to 
2014. The absolute Gini index decreased over the period 1980 to 2014 from 0.43 
to 0.32 for life expectancy, from 0.012 to 0.0057 for the age group 50-69 years, 
from 0.0038 to 0.0022 for the age group 5-49 years, and from 0.0009 to 0.0006 
for the age group 0-4 years. It will take between 2 and 32 years (national 
average 7 years) until the counties catch up with the life expectancy in the 
best performing county if their annual rates of increase remain unchanged.
CONCLUSION: Using the absolute Gini index as a metric for monitoring changes in 
geographic inequality over time may be a valuable tool for informing public 
health policies. The absolute inequality in mortality and life expectancy 
between Norwegian counties has decreased from 1980 to 2014.

The aim of this study was to determine the opinion of internists on the 
management of anticoagulation and thromboembolism prophylaxis in complex 
clinical scenarios in which the risk-benefit ratio of surgery is narrow and to 
develop a consensus document on the use of drugs anticoagulant therapy in this 
patient group. To this end, we identified by consensus the clinical areas of 
greatest uncertainty, a survey was created with 20 scenarios laid out in 40 
clinical questions, and we reviewed the specific literature. The survey was 
distributed among the internists of the Spanish Society of Internal Medicine 
(SEMI) and was completed by 290 of its members. The consensus process was 
implemented by changing the Delphi-RAND appropriateness method in an anonymous, 
double-round process that enabled an expert panel to identify the areas of 
agreement and uncertainty. In our case, we also added the survey results to the 
panel, a methodological innovation that helps provide additional information on 
the standard clinical practice. The result of the process is a set of 19 
recommendations formulated by SEMI experts, which helps establish guidelines for 
action on anticoagulant therapy in complex scenarios (high risk or active 
haemorrhage, short life expectancy, coexistence of antiplatelet therapy or 
comorbidities such as kidney disease and liver disease), which are not uncommon 
in standard clinical practice.

suspectum.

The timing of reproductive events (e.g. oviposition and hatching) to coincide 
with favourable seasonal conditions is critical for successful reproduction. 
However, developmental time may not match the duration between the optimal time 
for oviposition and the optimal time for hatchling survival. Thus, strategies 
that alter the time between oviposition and hatchling emergence can be highly 
advantageous. Arrested development and the resulting extension of the duration 
between oviposition and hatching has been widely documented across oviparous 
amniotes, but nest overwintering by hatchlings has only been documented in 
aquatic chelonians that live where winters are quite cold. Herein, we present a 
compilation of evidence regarding reproductive phenology by hatchlings of the 
Gila monster (Heloderma suspectum), a lizard inhabiting the Sonoran Desert of 
North America. Our data demonstrate that (i) Gila monster hatchlings from eggs 
oviposited in July do not emerge from their nests until late spring or summer of 
the following year, yet (ii) Gila monster eggs artificially incubated at 
field-relevant temperatures hatch in 4-5 months. Furthermore, we describe a 
fortuitous excavation of a hatching Gila monster nest in late October, which 
coincides with the artificial incubation results. Together, these results 
provide strong support for the existence of overwintering in the nest by a 
lizard, and suggest that this reproductive strategy should be explored in a 
broader array of taxa.

OBJECTIVES: To determine the potential costs and health benefits of a 
serum-based spectroscopic triage tool for brain tumours, which could be 
developed to reduce diagnostic delays in the current clinical pathway.
DESIGN: A model-based health pre-trial economic assessment. Decision tree models 
were constructed based on simplified diagnostic pathways. Models were populated 
with parameters identified from rapid reviews of the literature and clinical 
expert opinion.
SETTING: Explored as a test in both primary and secondary care (neuroimaging) in 
the UK health service, as well as application to the USA.
PARTICIPANTS: Calculations based on an initial cohort of 10 000 patients. In 
primary care, it is estimated that the volume of tests would approach 75 000 per 
annum. The volume of tests in secondary care is estimated at 53 000 per annum.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome measure was quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALY), which were employed to derive incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratios (ICER) in a cost-effectiveness analysis.
RESULTS: Results indicate that using a blood-based spectroscopic test in both 
scenarios has the potential to be highly cost-effective in a health technology 
assessment agency decision-making process, as ICERs were well below standard 
threshold values of £20 000-£30 000 per QALY. This test may be cost-effective in 
both scenarios with test sensitivities and specificities as low as 80%; however, 
the price of the test would need to be lower (less than approximately £40).
CONCLUSION: Use of this test as triage tool in primary care has the potential to 
be both more effective and cost saving for the health service. In secondary 
care, this test would also be deemed more effective than the current diagnostic 
pathway.

OBJECTIVES: As life expectancy of people living with HIV (PLWH) improves in 
low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs), the spectrum of HIV-related 
pulmonary complications may reflect a greater burden of chronic lung diseases as 
in high-income countries. We determined whether the risk of abnormal spirometry 
was greater among adolescent compared with adult PLWH at the Coptic Hope Center 
for Infectious Diseases in Nairobi, Kenya, and evaluated the role of other 
cofactors for abnormal spirometry.
DESIGN: We prospectively enrolled adolescent and adult PLWH for this 
cross-sectional study.
METHODS: Data collection included standardized questionnaires, clinical 
assessment, and prebronchodilator and postbronchodilator spirometry. Adolescents 
additionally underwent noncontrast chest computed tomography. Multivariable 
logistic regression determined associations of adolescent age with abnormal 
spirometry, adjusting for cofactors.
RESULTS: Of 427 PLWH, 21 (40%) adolescents and 64 (17%) adults had abnormal 
spirometry. Among adolescents, 80% had abnormal chest CTs, and 79% had at least 
one respiratory symptom. Adolescent age (adjusted odds ratio 3.22; 95% 
confidence interval 1.48-6.98) was independently associated with abnormal 
spirometry, adjusting for recent CD4, HIV clinical stage, low BMI, indoor 
kerosene use, smoking pack-years, and prior pulmonary tuberculosis. Additional 
important cofactors for abnormal spirometry included prior pulmonary 
tuberculosis (3.15; 1.70-5.58), kerosene use (1.77; 1.04-3.04) and smoking 
pack-years (1.05; 1.00-1.10). Adolescent age, prior pulmonary tuberculosis, and 
smoking pack-years were significantly associated with airflow limitation.
CONCLUSION: Adolescent age was independently associated with increased risk of 
abnormal spirometry, particularly airflow limitation. Studies to improve 
prevention, detection, and management of chronic lung disease across the 
lifespan among PLWH are needed in LMICs.

Plant resistance genes typically encode proteins with nucleotide binding 
site-leucine rich repeat (NLR) domains. Here we show that Ptr is an atypical 
resistance gene encoding a protein with four Armadillo repeats. Ptr is required 
for broad-spectrum blast resistance mediated by the NLR R gene Pi-ta and by the 
associated R gene Pi-ta2. Ptr is expressed constitutively and encodes two 
isoforms that are mainly localized in the cytoplasm. A two base pair deletion 
within the Ptr coding region in the fast neutron-generated mutant line M2354 
creates a truncated protein, resulting in susceptibility to M. oryzae. Targeted 
mutation of Ptr in a resistant cultivar using CRISPR/Cas9 leads to blast 
susceptibility, further confirming its resistance function. The cloning of Ptr 
may aid in the development of broad spectrum blast resistant rice.

We report an improved assembly (v3.6.1) of the melon (Cucumis melo L.) genome 
and a new genome annotation (v4.0). The optical mapping approach allowed 
correcting the order and the orientation of 21 previous scaffolds and permitted 
to correctly define the gap-size extension along the 12 pseudomolecules. A new 
comprehensive annotation was also built in order to update the previous 
annotation v3.5.1, released more than six years ago. Using an integrative 
annotation pipeline, based on exhaustive RNA-Seq collections and ad-hoc 
transposable element annotation, we identified 29,980 protein-coding loci. 
Compared to the previous version, the v4.0 annotation improved gene models in 
terms of completeness of gene structure, UTR regions definition, intron-exon 
junctions and reduction of fragmented genes. More than 8,000 new genes were 
identified, one third of them being well supported by RNA-Seq data. To make all 
the new resources easily exploitable and completely available for the scientific 
community, a redesigned Melonomics genomic platform was released at 
http://melonomics.net . The resources produced in this work considerably 
increase the reliability of the melon genome assembly and resolution of the gene 
models paving the way for further studies in melon and related species.

BACKGROUND: To understand why some people live to advanced age in good health 
and others do not, it is important to study not only disease, but also long-term 
good health. The Super-Seniors Study aims to identify factors associated with 
healthy aging.
METHODS: 480 healthy oldest-old 'Super-Seniors' aged 85 to 105 years and never 
diagnosed with cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, dementia, or major 
pulmonary disease, were compared to 545 mid-life controls aged 41-54, who 
represent a group that is unselected for survival from late-life diseases. 
Health and lifestyle information, personal and family medical history, and blood 
samples were collected from all participants. Super-Seniors also underwent four 
geriatric tests.
RESULTS: Super-Seniors showed high cognitive (Mini-Mental State Exam mean = 
28.3) and functional capacity (Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Scale 
mean = 21.4), as well as high physical function (Timed Up and Go mean = 12.3 
seconds) and low levels of depression (Geriatric Depression Scale mean = 1.5). 
Super-Seniors were less likely to be current smokers than controls, but the 
frequency of drinking alcohol was the same in both groups. Super-Seniors were 
more likely to have 4 or more offspring; controls were more likely to have no 
children. Female Super-Seniors had a mean age of last fertility 1.9 years older 
than controls, and were 2.3 times more likely to have had a child at ≥ 40 years. 
The parents of Super-Seniors had mean ages of deaths of 79.3 years for mothers, 
and 74.5 years for fathers, each exceeding the life expectancy for their era by 
a decade.
CONCLUSIONS: Super-Seniors are cognitively and physically high functioning 
individuals who have evaded major age-related chronic diseases into old age, 
representing the approximately top 1% for healthspan. The familiality of long 
lifespan of the parents of Super-Seniors supports the hypothesis that heritable 
factors contribute to this desirable phenotype.

INTRODUCTION: In Germany, a 23-valent polysaccharide pneumococcal vaccine 
(PPSV23) is recommended for elderly (60+) and patients 16+ with chronic diseases 
not associated with immune suppression. For all other patients at risk, 
sequential immunization with a 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) 
first, followed by PPSV23 is recommended. Repeated vaccination with PPSV23 is 
recommended every 6 years after individual assessment by the physician. This was 
adopted into the vaccination directive with binding reimbursement and funding. 
However, additional voluntary services allow statutory health insurances to 
differentiate from each other. Aim of this study is to estimate the 
cost-effectiveness of voluntary service scenarios compared to the strategy in 
place to support informed decision making.
METHODS: A microsimulation framework with Markov-type process of a population 
susceptible to pneumococcal disease over a lifetime horizon was developed to 
compare effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of different vaccination 
strategies. We simulated 1,000 iterations for seven scenarios. Assumptions were 
derived from published literature and probabilistic sensitivity analysis was run 
to show the robustness of the model.
RESULTS: Our study indicates that all voluntary service strategies could prevent 
further clinical cases compared to the existing policy. Depending on the 
scenario, 48-142 invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD), 24,000-45,000 hospitalized 
all-cause nonbacteremic pneumonia (NBP), 15,000-45,000 outpatient NBP cases, and 
4,000-8,000 deaths could be avoided on average. This refers to potential savings 
of €115 Mio. - €187 Mio. for medical and non-medical costs. Additional costs per 
patient for the payer are €2.48 to €7.13 and for the society €2.20 to €6.85. The 
ICER per LYG ranged from €3,662 to €23,061 (payer) and €3,258 to €29,617 
(societal). All but one scenario was cost-effective in ≥60% of the generated 
1,000 simulations.
CONCLUSION: Compared to the vaccination strategy in place, the different 
hypothetical scenarios can be considered cost-effective and suitable as 
additional voluntary services.

BACKGROUND: Transplantation of human hematopoietic stem cells into 
immunodeficient mice provides a powerful in vivo model system to gain functional 
insights into hematopoietic differentiation. So far, it remains unclear if 
epigenetic changes of normal human hematopoiesis are recapitulated upon 
engraftment into such "humanized mice." Mice have a much shorter life expectancy 
than men, and therefore, we hypothesized that the xenogeneic environment might 
greatly accelerate the epigenetic clock.
RESULTS: We demonstrate that genome-wide DNA methylation patterns of normal 
human hematopoietic development are indeed recapitulated upon engraftment in 
mice-particularly those of normal early B cell progenitor cells. Furthermore, we 
tested three epigenetic aging signatures, and none of them indicated that the 
murine environment accelerated age-associated DNA methylation changes.
CONCLUSIONS: Epigenetic changes of human hematopoietic development are 
recapitulated in the murine transplantation model, whereas epigenetic aging is 
not accelerated by the faster aging environment and seems to occur in the cell 
intrinsically.

INTRODUCTION: According to the World Health Organization data repository, the 
average life expectancy at birth for Singapore in 2015 has risen to 83.4 years, 
and many octogenarians (OG) remain active socioeconomically. The aim of this 
study is to compare the improvement and the impact of comorbidities on 
functional recovery after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) between OG and their 
younger counterparts.
METHODS: This is a retrospective study of prospectively collected data from a 
single institution arthroplasty register. Between January 2006 and December 
2011, 209 OG with primary knee osteoarthritis underwent TKA. Each OG (mean age 
82 ± 2.1) was then carefully matched to a younger control group (YG, mean age 66 
± 4.5). Their postoperative outcomes measured include Oxford Knee Score (OKS), 
SF36-Physical Function (SF-PF), and knee society rating score comprising of Knee 
Score (KS) and Function Score (FS). Their respective degrees of improvement were 
compared and adjusted for their baseline comorbidities, measured using the 
Deyo-Charlson Comorbidity Index (D-CCI).
RESULTS: There were more comorbidities among the OG (P < .05). Both groups saw 
the largest improvement (P < .05) during the first 6 months. There was no 
statistical significance between their improvement for OKS, KS, and FS between 
baseline and 6 months and OKS, FS, and SF-PF between 6 and 24 months. Adjusted 
for D-CCI using linear regression, the above results remained largely unchanged.
DISCUSSION: In our study, both groups showed significant improvement across all 
functional outcomes, especially during the first 6 months. The improvement 
observed in OG at 6 and 24 months was comparable to that of YG, despite an 
overall higher baseline D-CCI.
CONCLUSIONS: Total knee arthroplasty is a viable treatment option for the OG, 
offering good functional outcomes and results at 6 and 24 months when compared 
to their younger counterparts.

The incidence of renal cell carcinoma has been rising for years. At the same 
time there is an increasing prevalence of chronic renal failure with subsequent 
higher morbidity and shorter life expectancy in those affected. In the last 
decades the gold standard has thus shifted from radical to partial nephrectomy 
or tumor enucleation. A treatment alternative can be advantageous for selected 
patients with high morbidity and an increased risk of complications in 
anesthesia or surgery. Active surveillance represents a controlled delay in the 
initiation of treatment with a curative intention. Percutaneous radiofrequency 
ablation and laparoscopic cryoablation are currently the most commonly used 
treatment alternatives. Newer ablation procedures, such as high-intensity 
focused ultrasound, irreversible electroporation, microwave ablation, 
stereotactic ablative radiotherapy and high-dose brachytherapy have a high 
potential in some cases but are still considered experimental for the treatment.

PURPOSE: Although radiotherapy can be administered with a relatively low 
therapeutic burden, many elderly patients do not complete radiotherapy. In order 
to predict intolerance during radiotherapy, this study retrospectively analyzed 
the frequency of and risk factors for radiotherapy interruption among geriatric 
patients.
METHODS: From September 2009 to December 2016, 353 patients aged ≥70 years 
received definitive radiotherapy with a conventionally fractionated schedule. 
"Total interruption" included completion of ≤90% of a planned radiotherapy, 
temporary discontinuation, and treatment-related mortality within 2 months. 
"Early-phase incompletion" and "mid-phase incompletion" represented completion 
of ≤50 and ≤80% of a planned radiotherapy, respectively.
RESULTS: The median age of patients was 74 years. Early- and mid-phase 
incompletions and total interruption occurred in 4.2, 9.3, and 19.3% of 
patients, respectively. Total interruption occurred frequently in cancers 
involving the thorax (27.4%), head and neck (23.1%), abdomen (20.0%), pelvis 
(17.4%), and breast/extremity (8.1%). The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 
(ECOG) performance score (P = 0.004 and 0.002), serum albumin level (P = 0.016 
and 0.002), and the expected 5‑year survival (P = 0.033 and 0.034) were 
significant factors for mid-phase incompletion and total interruption. 
Age ≥ 75 years (P = 0.008), concurrent chemotherapy (P = 0.017), and the extent 
of radiation field (P = 0.027) were factors associated with total interruption.
CONCLUSION: Overall, 19.3% of the elderly patients showed treatment intolerance 
during conventional radiotherapy. Serum albumin level and ECOG performance score 
should be considered as surrogate markers for radiotherapy interruption prior to 
the decision regarding definite conventional radiotherapy.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the cost effectiveness of secukinumab, a fully human 
interleukin-17A inhibitor, for adults in the UK with active ankylosing 
spondylitis (AS) who have not responded adequately to previous treatment with 
conventional care (CC; biologic-naïve population) or previous biologic therapy 
(biologic-experienced population).
PERSPECTIVE AND SETTING: UK National Health Service (NHS).
METHODS: The model was structured as a 3-month decision tree leading into a 
Markov model. Comparators were licensed tumour necrosis factor inhibitors 
(including available biosimilars) and CC in the biologic-naïve and 
biologic-experienced populations, respectively. Clinical parameters captured 
treatment response, short-term disease activity and patient functioning, as well 
as long-term structural disease progression. Utilities were derived from 
secukinumab trial data. List prices were used for all drugs. The cost year was 
2017 and costs and outcomes were discounted at 3.5%.
RESULTS: In the biologic-naïve population, secukinumab dominated adalimumab and 
certolizumab pegol. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) versus other 
comparators were either below £10,000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) 
gained or south-west ICERs that implied cost effectiveness of secukinumab. In 
biologic-experienced patients, the ICER for secukinumab versus CC was £4927 per 
QALY gained. Treatment response rates, short-term treatment effects, long-term 
radiographic progression and biologic acquisition costs were key model drivers. 
Scenario analysis found results to be robust to changes in model structural 
assumptions. Probabilistic analysis identified greater uncertainty in results in 
the biologic-naïve population.
CONCLUSIONS: Even at list price, secukinumab appears to represent a 
cost-effective use of NHS resources for biologic-naïve and biologic-experienced 
patients with active AS. Further research on long-term radiographic progression 
outcomes would be valuable for future cost-effectiveness analyses in AS.

OBJECTIVE: The aim was to determine the cost effectiveness of secukinumab, a 
fully human interleukin-17A inhibitor, for adults in the UK with active 
psoriatic arthritis (PsA) who are tumour necrosis factor inhibitor (TNFi) naïve 
and without concomitant moderate-to-severe psoriasis, and who have responded 
inadequately to conventional systemic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs 
(csDMARDs).
PERSPECTIVE AND SETTING: The study took the perspective and setting of the UK 
National Health Service (NHS).
METHODS: The model structure was a 3-month decision tree leading into a Markov 
model. Separate analyses based on the number of prior csDMARDs (one and  two or 
more) were conducted, with secukinumab 150 mg compared to standard of care (SoC) 
and TNFis, respectively, for each subpopulation. Clinical parameters, including 
response at 3 months, were from the FUTURE 2 trial and a network meta-analysis. 
Outcomes included total costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) over the 
40-year time horizon (3.5% annual discount for both outcomes; cost year 2017), 
and incremental cost effectiveness ratios (ICERs).
RESULTS: The ICER for secukinumab 150 mg versus SoC was £28,748 per QALY gained 
(one prior csDMARD). Secukinumab 150 mg dominated golimumab, certolizumab pegol 
and etanercept, and had an ICER of £5680 per QALY gained versus adalimumab 
and > £1 million saved per QALY foregone versus infliximab (two or more prior 
csDMARDs). Valuing one QALY at between £20,000 and £30,000, the probability of 
secukinumab having the highest net monetary benefit was 48.9% (one prior 
csDMARD) and 88.9% (two or more prior csDMARDs). Parameters related to Health 
Assessment Questionnaire scores were most influential.
CONCLUSIONS: Secukinumab 150 mg at list price appears to represent a 
cost-effective use of NHS resources for adults with PsA who have responded 
inadequately to one or two or more prior csDMARDs.

PURPOSE: We performed an economic evaluation using a decision-tree model to 
analyze the relative cost effectiveness from the United States Centers for 
Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) perspective of two different methods of 
tonsillectomy (traditional total tonsillectomy and partial intracapsular) for 
pediatric obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Procedural costs were drawn from published literature and 
Medicare values. Effectiveness and probabilities were drawn from medical 
literature. Primary intervention was monopolar-technique total tonsillectomy or 
microdebrider-assisted partial intracapsular tonsillectomy. Secondary 
interventions included operative control of hemorrhage, treatment of severe 
dehydration, or revision tonsillectomy. The decision model starts with pediatric 
patients with OSA, choosing between total and partial tonsillectomy. Outcomes 
were measured by costs (US dollars), effectiveness [quality-adjusted life year 
(QALY)], and a willingness-to-pay threshold of US$100,000/QALY. Base case 
analysis, probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) and deterministic sensitivity 
analyses were performed. Primary outcome was incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio (ICER) for each of the two tonsillectomy techniques.
RESULTS: Base case analysis demonstrated that total tonsillectomy was more cost 
effective at US$12,453.40 per QALY gained. In PSA, 82.84% of the simulations 
show total tonsillectomy to be the more cost-effective strategy. Deterministic 
sensitivity analyses showed that when the rate of OSA recurrence is lower than 
3.12%, partial tonsillectomy would be more cost effective. When the failure rate 
of partial tonsillectomy is below 1.0%, it is more cost effective even when 
total tonsillectomy is 100% successful.
CONCLUSION: Study results suggest that overall monopolar-technique total 
tonsillectomy is more cost effective. However, with varying adjustments for 
disutility caused by procedural complications, intracapsular tonsillectomy could 
become a more cost-effective technique for treating pediatric OSA.

Kidneys from deceased donors who are hepatitis C virus (HCV) nucleic acid test 
positive are infrequently used for transplantation in HCV-negative patients due 
to concerns about disease transmission. With the development of direct-acting 
antivirals (DAAs) for HCV, there is now potential to use these kidneys in 
HCV-negative candidates. However, the high cost of DAAs poses a challenge to 
adoption of this strategy. We created a Markov model to examine the 
cost-effectiveness of using deceased donors infected with HCV for kidney 
transplantation in uninfected waitlist candidates. In the primary analysis, this 
strategy was cost saving and improved health outcomes compared to remaining on 
the waitlist for an additional 2 or more years to receive a HCV-negative
