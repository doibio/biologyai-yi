IMPORTANCE: Leukocyte telomere length (LTL) is a trait associated with risk of 
cardiovascular disease and cancer, the 2 major disease categories that largely 
define longevity in the United States. However, it remains unclear whether LTL 
is associated with the human life span.
OBJECTIVE: To examine whether LTL is associated with the life span of 
contemporary humans.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study included 3259 adults of 
European ancestry from the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS), Framingham Heart 
Study (FHS), and Women's Health Initiative (WHI). Leukocyte telomere length was 
measured in 1992 and 1997 in the CHS, from 1995 to 1998 in the FHS, and from 
1993 to 1998 in the WHI. Data analysis was conducted from February 2017 to 
December 2019.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Death and LTL, measured by Southern blots of the 
terminal restriction fragments, were the main outcomes. Cause of death was 
adjudicated by end point committees.
RESULTS: The analyzed sample included 3259 participants (2342 [71.9%] women), 
with a median (range) age of 69.0 (50.0-98.0) years at blood collection. The 
median (range) follow-up until death was 10.9 (0.2-23.0) years in CHS, 19.7 
(3.4-23.0) years in FHS, and 16.6 (0.5-20.0) years in WHI. During follow-up, 
there were 1525 deaths (482 [31.6%] of cardiovascular disease; 373 [24.5%] of 
cancer, and 670 [43.9%] of other or unknown causes). Short LTL, expressed in 
residual LTL, was associated with increased mortality risk. Overall, the hazard 
ratio for all-cause mortality for a 1-kilobase decrease in LTL was 1.34 (95% CI, 
1.21-1.47). This association was stronger for noncancer causes of death 
(cardiovascular death: hazard ratio, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.08-1.52; cancer: hazard 
ratio, 1.13; 95% CI, 0.93-1.36; and other causes: hazard ratio, 1.53; 95% CI, 
1.32-1.77).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The results of this study indicate that LTL is 
associated with a natural life span limit in contemporary humans.

IMPORTANCE: Dementia is often underdiagnosed in nursing homes (NHs). This 
potentially results in inappropriate care, and high rates of emergency 
department (ED) transfers in particular.
OBJECTIVE: To assess whether systematic dementia screening of NH residents 
combined with multidisciplinary team meetings resulted in a lower rate of ED 
transfer at 12 months compared with usual care.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Multicenter, cluster randomized trial with 
NHs as the unit of randomization. The IDEM (Impact of Systematic Tracking of 
Dementia Cases on the Rate of Hospitalization in Emergency Care Units) trial 
took place at 64 public and private NHs in France. Recruitment started on May 1, 
2010, and was completed on March 31, 2012. Residents who were aged 60 years or 
older, had no diagnosed or documented dementia, were not bedridden, had lived in 
the NH for at least 1 month at inclusion, and had a life expectancy greater than 
12 months were included. The residents were followed up for 18 months. The main 
study analyses were completed on October 14, 2016.
INTERVENTION: Two parallel groups were compared: an intervention group 
consisting of NHs that set up 2 multidisciplinary team meetings to identify 
residents with dementia and to discuss an appropriate care plan, and a control 
group consisting of NHs that continued their usual practice. During the 
inclusion period of 23 months, all residents of participating NHs who met 
eligibility criteria were included in the study.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary end point (ED transfer) was analyzed at 
12 months, but the residents included were followed up for 18 months.
RESULTS: A total of 64 NHs participated in the study and enrolled 1428 residents 
(mean [SD] age, 84.7 [8.1] years; 1019 [71.3%] female): 599 in the intervention 
group (32 NHs) and 829 in the control group (32 NHs). The final study visit was 
completed by 1042 residents (73.0%). The main reason for early discontinuation 
was death (318 residents [22.7%]). The intervention did not reduce the risk of 
ED transfers during the 12-month follow-up: the proportion of residents 
transferred at least once to an ED during the 12-month follow-up was 16.2% in 
the intervention group vs 12.8% in the control group (odds ratio, 1.32; 95% CI, 
0.83-2.09; P = .24).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study failed to demonstrate that systematic 
screening for dementia in NHs resulted in fewer ED transfers. The findings do 
not support implementation of multidisciplinary team meetings for systematic 
dementia screening of all NH residents, beyond the national recommendations for 
dementia diagnosis, to reduce ED transfers.

Manipulating the type VI secretion system spike to shuttle passenger proteins.

Wettstadt S(1), Filloux A(1).

Author information:

Sciences, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom.

The type VI secretion system (T6SS) is a contractile injection apparatus that 
translocates a spike loaded with various effectors directly into eukaryotic or 
prokaryotic target cells. Pseudomonas aeruginosa can load either one of its 
three T6SSs with a variety of toxic bullets using different but specific modes. 
The T6SS spike, which punctures the bacterial cell envelope allowing effector 
transport, consists of a torch-like VgrG trimer on which sits a PAAR protein 
sharpening the VgrG tip. VgrG itself sits on the Hcp tube and all elements, 
packed into a T6SS sheath, are propelled out of the cell and into target cells. 
On occasion, effectors are covalent extensions of VgrG, PAAR or Hcp proteins, 
which are then coined "evolved" components as opposed to canonical. Here, we 
show how various passenger domains could be fused to the C terminus of a 
canonical VgrG, VgrG1a from P. aeruginosa, and be sent into the bacterial 
culture supernatant. There is no restriction on the passenger type, although the 
efficacy may vary greatly, since we used either an unrelated T6SS protein, 
β-lactamase, a covalent extension of an "evolved" VgrG, VgrG2b, or a 
Hcp-dependent T6SS toxin, Tse2. Our data further highlights an exceptional 
modularity/flexibility for loading the T6SS nano-weapon. Refining the parameters 
to optimize delivery of passenger proteins of interest would have attractive 
medical and industrial applications. This may for example involve engineering 
the T6SS as a delivery system to shuttle toxins into either bacterial pathogens 
or tumour cells which would be an original approach in the fight against 
antimicrobial resistant bacteria or cancer.

Over the past century, the life expectancy in industrialized countries has 
rapidly risen by over 30 years due to improvements in standards of medical care, 
sanitation, and lifestyle. Estimation of life expectancy has traditionally been 
viewed through a lens of epidemiology and public health. However, this data, 
while considered the "gold standard" of measuring healthy life expectancy, may 
soon find itself redundant in the face of advancing medical technology. Even as 
average life expectancy has increased, there has not been an equivalent increase 
in healthy life expectancy, or "healthspan"; furthermore, there is a current 
trend of stagnation in life expectancy, as the supposed increases are estimated 
to be drastically slowing down, in part due to exhaustion of our current ability 
to extend the human lifespan. In this viewpoint, we will examine the developing 
fields of medicine and life sciences which will reshape our current approach to 
life expectancy prediction.

BACKGROUND: The Hand Extension Robot Orthosis (HERO) Grip Glove was iteratively 
designed to meet requests from therapists and persons after a stroke who have 
severe hand impairment to create a device that extends all five fingers, 
enhances grip strength and is portable, lightweight, easy to put on, comfortable 
and affordable.
METHODS: Eleven persons who have minimal or no active finger extension (Chedoke 
McMaster Stage of Hand 1-4) post-stroke were recruited to evaluate how well they 
could perform activities of daily living and finger function assessments with 
and without wearing the HERO Grip Glove.
RESULTS: The 11 participants showed statistically significant improvements 
(p < 0.01), while wearing the HERO Grip Glove, in the water bottle grasp and 
manipulation task (increase of 2.3 points, SD 1.2, scored using the Chedoke Hand 
and Arm Inventory scale from 1 to 7) and in index finger extension (increase of 
147o, SD 44) and range of motion (increase of 145o, SD 36). The HERO Grip Glove 
provided 12.7 N (SD 8.9 N) of grip force and 11.0 N (SD 4.8) of pinch force to 
their affected hands, which enabled those without grip strength to grasp and 
manipulate blocks, a fork and a water bottle, as well as write with a pen. The 
participants were 'more or less satisfied' with the HERO Grip Glove as an 
assistive device (average of 3.3 out of 5 on the Quebec User Evaluation of 
Satisfaction with Assistive Technology 2.0 Scale). The highest satisfaction 
scores were given for safety and security (4.6) and ease of use (3.8) and the 
lowest satisfaction scores were given for ease of donning (2.3), which required 
under 5 min with assistance. The most common requests were for greater grip 
strength and a smaller glove size for small hands.
CONCLUSIONS: The HERO Grip Glove is a safe and effective tool for enabling 
persons with a stroke that have severe hand impairment to incorporate their 
affected hand into activities of daily living, which may motivate greater use of 
the affected upper extremity in daily life to stimulate neuromuscular recovery.

BACKGROUND: The generalisability of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) can be 
uncertain because the impact of exclusion criteria is rarely quantified. The aim 
of this study was to systematically review studies examining the percentage of 
clinical populations with a physical health condition who would be excluded by 
RCTs of treatments for that condition.
METHODS: Medline and Embase were searched from inception to Feb 11th 2018. Two 
reviewers independently completed screening, full-text review, data extraction 
and risk-of-bias assessment. The primary outcome was the percentage of patients 
in the clinical population who would have been excluded from each examined 
trial. Subgroup analyses examined exclusion by population setting, publication 
date and funding source.
RESULTS: Titles/abstracts (20,754) were screened, and 50 studies were included 
which reported exclusion rates from 305 trials of treatments in 31 physical 
conditions. Estimated rates of exclusion from trials varied from 0% to 100%, and 
the median exclusion rate was 77.1% of patients (interquartile range 55.5% to 
89.0% exclusion). Median exclusion rates for trials in common chronic conditions 
were high, including hypertension 83.0%, type 2 diabetes 81.7%, chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease 84.3%, and asthma 96.0%. The most commonly applied 
exclusion criteria related to age, co-morbidity and co-prescribing, whereas more 
implicit criteria relating to life expectancy or functional status were not 
typically examined. There was no evidence that exclusion varied by the nature of 
the clinical population in which exclusion was evaluated or trial funding 
source. There was no statistically significant change in exclusion rates in more 
recent compared with older trials.
CONCLUSIONS: The majority of trials of treatments for physical conditions 
examined excluded the majority of patients with the condition being treated. 
Almost a quarter of the trials studied excluded over 90% of patients, more than 
half of trials excluded at least three quarters of patients, and four out of 
five trials excluded at least half of patients. A limitation is that most 
studies applied only a subset of eligibility criteria, so exclusion rates are 
likely under-estimated. Exclusion from trials of older people and people with 
co-morbidity and co-prescribing is increasingly untenable given population aging 
and increasing multimorbidity.

INTRODUCTION: While major depression causes substantial distress and impairment 
for affected individuals and society, the effectiveness of cognitive behavioural 
therapy (CBT) in treating the condition has been established. However, the 
therapeutic mechanism underlying the efficacy of CBT remains unknown. This study 
aimed to describe a protocol for a randomised controlled trial that will measure 
the CBT-induced clinical and neural changes in patients with non-psychotic major 
depression.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The current study is a 16-week assessor-blinded, 
randomised, parallel-group trial with a 12-month follow-up as part of usual 
depression care at an outpatient clinic. Patients aged 20-69 years with major 
depressive disorder will be randomly assigned to receive either CBT in addition 
to their usual treatment or talking control in addition to their usual treatment 
for 16 weeks. The primary outcome is the functional changes in the brain areas 
that have been associated with future-oriented thinking at 16 weeks; secondary 
outcomes include changes in functional brain connectivity, severity and changes 
in the scores of objective and subjective clinical depression symptoms, 
proportion of responders and remitters and quality of life. The 
intention-to-treat analysis will be used.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: All protocols and the informed consent form are 
compliant with the Ethics Guideline for Clinical Research (Japanese Ministry of 
Health, Labour and Welfare). Ethical Review Committees at the Keio University 
School of Medicine have approved the study protocol (version 3, 11 September 
2017). We will disseminate research findings to scientific and general audiences 
through national and international conference presentations as well as lay 
summaries to the general public, including mental health consumer and 
publications in international peer-reviewed psychiatry and brain imaging 
journals.

It has long been assumed that lifespan and healthspan correlate strongly, yet 
the two can be clearly dissociated1-6. Although there has been a global increase 
in human life expectancy, increasing longevity is rarely accompanied by an 
extended healthspan4,7. Thus, understanding the origin of healthy behaviours in 
old people remains an important and challenging task. Here we report a conserved 
epigenetic mechanism underlying healthy ageing. Through genome-wide 
RNA-interference-based screening of genes that regulate behavioural 
deterioration in ageing Caenorhabditis elegans, we identify 59 genes as 
potential modulators of the rate of age-related behavioural deterioration. Among 
these modulators, we found that a neuronal epigenetic reader, BAZ-2, and a 
neuronal histone 3 lysine 9 methyltransferase, SET-6, accelerate behavioural 
deterioration in C. elegans by reducing mitochondrial function, repressing the 
expression of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins. This mechanism is 
conserved in cultured mouse neurons and human cells. Examination of human 
databases8,9 shows that expression of the human orthologues of these C. elegans 
regulators, BAZ2B and EHMT1, in the frontal cortex increases with age and 
correlates positively with the progression of Alzheimer's disease. Furthermore, 
ablation of Baz2b, the mouse orthologue of BAZ-2, attenuates age-dependent 
body-weight gain and prevents cognitive decline in ageing mice. Thus our 
genome-wide RNA-interference screen in C. elegans has unravelled conserved 
epigenetic negative regulators of ageing, suggesting possible ways to achieve 
healthy ageing.

In this work, a new kind of dendritically amplified fluorescent signal probe on 
SiO2 microspheres was controllably fabricated by the terminal deoxynucleotidyl 
transferase (TdT)-catalyzed incorporation of nucleotides combined with 
bio-barcode (BBC) amplification for the ultrasensitive detection of Hg2+. A 
thymine T-Hg2+-T hairpin structure was first formed and further initiated the 
strand displacement amplification (SDA) reaction, generating a mimic target 
(MT). MT hybridized with a capture probe 1 (C1) on SiO2 microspheres, and the 
3'-hydroxyl (OH) termini of MT initiated TdT-based DNA extension, producing 
abundant poly-guanine sequences (G1). Then, G1 hybridized with a capture probe 2 
(C2) with abundant cytosine (C) species to assemble multiple C2/reporter 
probe-AuNPs onto the SiO2 microspheres. The reporter DNA further initiated 
TdT-based extension with a poly-T sequence (T1) to link large numbers of signal 
probes, which generated a very high fluorescence signal for the ultrasensitive 
detection of target Hg2+. This TdT-based signal amplification method coupled 
with SDA exhibits extraordinary sensitivity for Hg2+ assay with a limit down to 
1.0 aM. The proposed highly sensitive fluorescence strategy holds great 
potential for detecting targets in environmental and biological fields.

BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to measure differences in quality-adjusted 
life expectancy (QALE) by income in Korea at the national and district levels.
METHODS: Mortality rates and EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D) scores were obtained from the 
National Health Information Database of the National Health Insurance Service 
and the Korea Community Health Survey, respectively. QALE and differences in 
QALE among income quintiles were calculated using combined 2008-2014 data for 
245 districts in Korea. Correlation analyses were conducted to investigate the 
associations of neighborhood characteristics with QALE and income gaps therein.
RESULTS: QALE showed a graded pattern of inequality according to income, and 
increased over time for all levels of income and in both sexes, except for 
low-income quintiles among women, resulting in a widened inequality in QALE 
among women. In all 245 districts, pro-rich inequalities in QALE were found in 
both men and women. Districts with higher QALE and smaller income gaps in QALE 
were concentrated in metropolitan areas, while districts with lower QALE and 
larger income gaps in QALE were found in rural areas. QALE and differences in 
QALE by income showed relatively close correlations with socioeconomic 
characteristics, but relatively weak correlations with health behaviors, except 
for smoking and indicators related to medical resources.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence of income-based inequalities in health 
measured by QALE in all subnational areas in Korea. Furthermore, QALE and 
differences in QALE by income were closely associated with neighborhood-level 
socioeconomic characteristics.

OBJECTIVES: Older adults are often prescribed potentially inappropriate 
medications associated with adverse health outcomes and increased health 
services utilization. Developing Pharmacist-led Research to Educate and 
Sensitize Community Residents to the Inappropriate Prescriptions Burden in the 
Elderly (D-PRESCRIBE), a pragmatic randomized clinical trial, demonstrated how a 
community pharmacist-led evidence-based educational intervention successfully 
empowered community-dwelling older adults and their physicians to reduce chronic 
use of inappropriate medications. The objective of this study was to evaluate 
the cost-effectiveness of the D-PRESCRIBE intervention for discontinuing 
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).
DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis.
SETTING: Canada.
PARTICIPANTS: Community-dwelling adults aged 65 years and older.
MEASUREMENTS: Decision analysis combining decision tree and Markov state 
transition modeling was developed to estimate the cost-effectiveness of 
D-PRESCRIBE (NSAIDs) compared with usual care from a Canadian healthcare system 
perspective with a time horizon of 1 year. Data from the D-PRESCRIBE trial and 
published literature were used to calculate effectiveness, utilities, and costs. 
Reference case and scenario analyses were conducted using probabilistic 
modeling. Sensitivity analyses assessed the robustness of the reference case 
model.
RESULTS: D-PRESCRIBE (NSAIDs) was less costly (-$1008.61) and more effective 
(.11 quality-adjusted life-years [QALYs]) than usual care and was the dominant 
strategy. At willingness-to-pay thresholds of $50 000 per QALY and $100 000 per 
QALY, D-PRESCRIBE (NSAIDs) incurred a positive incremental net benefit compared 
with usual care, suggesting it is cost-effective. Compared with the reference 
case, scenario analyses gave comparable QALYs with modest variation in cost 
estimates.
CONCLUSION: For community-dwelling older adults, D-PRESCRIBE (NSAIDs) provides 
greater benefits at lower system costs, making it a compelling strategy to 
reduce the use and harms associated with chronic NSAID consumption. Our findings 
support reimbursing community pharmacists' clinical professional services for 
deprescribing inappropriate NSAIDs in community-dwelling older adults. J Am

CONTEXT: Few studies have examined how clinicians assess decision-making 
capacity for research in the last weeks of life.
OBJECTIVES: We examined the decision-making capacity for participation in a 
research study and its association with clinician impression and delirium among 
patients with cancer with days to weeks of life expectancy.
METHODS: Patients admitted to our palliative and supportive care unit were 
approached for a prospective observational study. We assessed for their 
decision-making capacity based on clinical impression of physician and nurse, 
Memorial Delirium Assessment Scale (MDAS), and the MacArthur Competency 
Assessment Tool for Clinical Research (MacCAT-CR).
RESULTS: Among the 206 patients, 131 patients (64%) did not require MacCAT-CR 
assessment because they were overtly delirious or unresponsive; 37 (18%) 
patients were alert but did not complete the MacCAT-CR assessment for other 
reasons, and 38 patients (18%) completed the MacCAT-CR assessment. Among these 
38 patients, five (13%) patients were incapable and had normal albeit 
significantly higher MDAS scores compared with those who were capable (1.8 vs. 
4.2; P = 0.002). Compared against MacCAT-CR and MDAS, the overall agreement with 
capacity assessment with a clinician was 88% (95% CI 82-93) for physicians and 
90% (95% CI 82-94) for nurses. The area under the receiver operating 
characteristics curve was 0.93 (95% CI 0.88-0.96) for physicians and 0.94 (95% 
CI 0.89-0.97) for nurses, suggesting high discrimination.
CONCLUSION: Most patients in the palliative and supportive care unit lacked 
decision-making capacity for participation in clinical research. Clinician 
impression had high accuracy. Few patients with normal MDAS were found to be 
incapable with MacCAT-CR assessment.

PURPOSE: To determine the airplane travel-related carbon footprint of the 
Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) annual meeting, the associated 
health burden, and the costs to offset these greenhouse gas emissions (i.e. 
compensation of emissions by funding an equivalent CO2 saving elsewhere).
METHODS: The RSNA's website was used to determine the reported country of origin 
of attendees to the 2017 meeting that took place in Chicago from November 26 to 
December 1. It was assumed that attendees had traveled from the airport nearest 
to the largest city in their country or state to Chicago's O'Hare international 
airport. The total amount of air travel-related CO2-equivalent emission (based 
on round-trip economy class travel), the imposed health burden in terms of 
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) in the global population, the total CO2 
offsets costs, and the CO2 offsets costs per DALY were calculated.
RESULTS: The calculated airplane travel-related CO2-equivalent emissions of 
11,223 attendees from the United States and 10,684 attendees from other 
countries were 7,067,618 kg and 32,438,420 kg, totaling 39,506,038 kg. This 
caused an estimated 51.4-79.0 DALYs. The calculated amount of Total CO2 offset 
costs were calculated to be $474,072, which corresponds to $6,001-9,223 per DALY 
averted.
CONCLUSIONS: The airplane travel-related carbon footprint of the RSNA annual 
meeting and the associated disease burden are relevant, and potential attendees 
and organizers should take measures to overcome this undesired side effect. 
Offsetting this carbon footprint is cost-effective and this initiative should be 
taken by the radiological community.

A comparative study was conducted to replace the traditional screening method 
(MFDS#83) with the Quick, Easy, Cheap, Effective, Rugged and Safe (QuEChERS) EN 
method for the determination of 267 pesticides/metabolites/plant 
activators/growth regulators in five representative crop matrices (mandarin, 
pepper, potato, rice, and soybean). In the traditional method, samples were 
extracted with acetonitrile and salt, and purified with a solid-phase extraction 
cartridge. In the QuEChERS method, the sample extraction was carried out using 
acetonitrile and a mixture of salts, and purification was performed using 
dispersive solid phase extraction. The limit of quantification (LOQ) for the 
MFDS#83 method was 0.0004 mg/kg, whereas for the QuEChERS EN method, the LOQ 
varied from 0.002 to 0.006 mg/kg for all analytes in various matrices. A 
six-point matrix-matched calibration curve was prepared for all analytes in five 
matrices for both methods. Both the MFDS#83 and QuEChERS EN methods provided 
excellent linearity, with the coefficients of determination (R2) ≥ 0.99 for most 
of the compounds. In both cases, the method was validated in terms of recovery 
and repeatability after the fortification of two different concentrations with 
three replicates for each of the concentrations. The QuEChERS EN method provided 
better recovery than the MFDS#83 method for all matrices except mandarin.

Introduction: The life expectancy of patients who undergo ascending aortic 
replacement is unknown. The life expectancy of a population depends on a 
collection of environmental and socio-economic factors of the territory where 
they reside. Our aim was to compare the life expectancy of patients undergoing 
surgery for ascending aortic aneurysm with that of the general population 
matching by age, sex, and territory. In addition, we aimed to know the late 
complications, causes of death and risk factors. Methods: All patients who 
underwent elective replacement of an ascending aortic aneurysm at our 
institution between 2000 and 2019 were included. The long-term survival of the 
sample was compared with that of the general population using data of the 
National Institute of Statistics. Results: For patients who survived the 
postoperative period, observed cumulative survival at three, five and eight 
years was 94.07% (95% CI 91.87%-95.70%), 89.96% (95% CI 86.92%-92.33%) and 
82.72% (95% CI 77.68%-86.71%). Cumulative survival of the general population at 
three, five and eight years was 93.22%, 88.30%, and 80.27%. Cancer and cardiac 
failure were the main causes of death. Conclusions: Long-term survival of 
patients undergoing elective surgery for ascending aortic aneurysm who survive 
the postoperative period completely recover their life expectancy.

BACKGROUND: Consolidation immunotherapy with the programmed death ligand 1 
(PD-L1) inhibitor durvalumab improves survival in patients with stage III 
non-small-cell lung cancer responding to radiochemotherapy. The aim of this 
study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of durvalumab in Switzerland based on 
the most recent PACIFIC survival follow-up.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We constructed a Markov model based on the 3-year 
follow-up data of the PACIFIC trial and compared consolidation durvalumab with 
observation. We used published utility values and assessed costs for treatment 
strategies from the perspective of the Swiss health care payers. 
Cost-effectiveness was tested both in the intention-to-treat population of the 
PACIFIC trial unselected for PD-L1 tumor expression and in patients with 
PD-L1-expressing tumors (≥1%).
RESULTS: In the unselected/PD-L1-positive patients, durvalumab showed an 
incremental effectiveness of 0.76/1.18 quality-adjusted life year (QALY) and 
incremental costs of Swiss Francs (CHF) 67 239/78 177, resulting in incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios of CHF 88 703/66 131 per QALY gained, respectively. 
The most influential factors for the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio were 
the utility before first progression, costs for durvalumab, and the hazard ratio 
for overall survival under durvalumab versus observation. The cost-effectiveness 
of durvalumab was better than CHF 100 000 per QALY gained in 75% of the 
simulations in probabilistic sensitivity analysis.
CONCLUSION: Assuming a willingness-to-pay threshold of CHF 100 000 per QALY 
gained, consolidation durvalumab is likely to be cost-effective both in patients 
with inoperable stage III non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) unselected for 
PD-L1 status and in patients with PD-L1-expressing tumors in Switzerland.

The potential of palm-oil biofuels to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions 
compared with fossil fuels is increasingly questioned. So far, no 
measurement-based GHG budgets were available, and plantation age was ignored in 
Life Cycle Analyses (LCA). Here, we conduct LCA based on measured CO2, CH4 and 
N2O fluxes in young and mature Indonesian oil palm plantations. CO2 dominates 
the on-site GHG budgets. The young plantation is a carbon source 
(1012 ± 51 gC m-2 yr-1), the mature plantation a sink (-754 ± 38 gC m-2 yr-1). 
LCA considering the measured fluxes shows higher GHG emissions for palm-oil 
biodiesel than traditional LCA assuming carbon neutrality. Plantation 
rotation-cycle extension and earlier-yielding varieties potentially decrease GHG 
emissions. Due to the high emissions associated with forest conversion to oil 
palm, our results indicate that only biodiesel from second rotation-cycle 
plantations or plantations established on degraded land has the potential for 
pronounced GHG emission savings.

Huntington's disease (HD) is caused by Huntingtin (Htt) gene mutation resulting 
in the loss of striatal GABAergic neurons and motor functional deficits. We 
report here an in vivo cell conversion technology to reprogram striatal 
astrocytes into GABAergic neurons in both R6/2 and YAC128 HD mouse models 
through AAV-mediated ectopic expression of NeuroD1 and Dlx2 transcription 
factors. We found that the astrocyte-to-neuron (AtN) conversion rate reached 80% 
in the striatum and >50% of the converted neurons were DARPP32+ medium spiny 
neurons. The striatal astrocyte-converted neurons showed action potentials and 
synaptic events, and projected their axons to the targeted globus pallidus and 
substantia nigra in a time-dependent manner. Behavioral analyses found that 
NeuroD1 and Dlx2-treated R6/2 mice showed a significant extension of life span 
and improvement of motor functions. This study demonstrates that in vivo AtN 
conversion may be a disease-modifying gene therapy to treat HD and other 
neurodegenerative disorders.
