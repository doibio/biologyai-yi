CONTEXT: There is no evidence-based treatment for fatigue in amyotrophic lateral 
sclerosis (ALS), and identification of treatable causes determines management 
strategies. Although dyspnea is a key symptom of ALS and effectively treatable, 
it has not been sufficiently investigated whether dyspnea may be a 
fatigue-promoting factor.
OBJECTIVES: To determine the level of fatigue in dyspneic ALS patients and 
whether fatigue is promoted by dyspnea. We further evaluated the correlation of 
fatigue with respiratory function tests.
METHODS: About 101 dyspneic patients and 20 matched controls completed the ALS 
Functional Rating Scale-Extension and the Fatigue Severity Scale. Dyspneic 
patients additionally completed the Dyspnea-ALS Scale and the ALS Assessment 
Questionnaire and underwent respiratory function tests (forced vital capacity, 
sniff nasal inspiratory pressure, mean inspiratory and expiratory pressure with 
respective relaxation rates, and blood gases). Multiple regression and 
correlation analyses were conducted.
RESULTS: Dyspneic patients had significantly higher fatigue scores than 
nondyspneic patients, and their fatigue significantly affected quality of life. 
Dyspnea alone explained up to 24% of the variance in fatigue. No associations 
were observed between fatigue and respiratory function tests. Patients with 
noninvasive ventilation reported significantly more dyspnea and fatigue.
CONCLUSION: Fatigue is a frequent and bothersome symptom in dyspneic ALS 
patients. Dyspnea-related distress is, in contrast to objective indicators of 
respiratory impairment, a determining factor of experienced fatigue. There is an 
urgent need for further symptom relief beyond noninvasive ventilation. Adequate 
treatment of dyspnea has the potential for synergies in symptom management 
arising from the association between fatigue and dyspnea.

As a result of improvements in life expectancy and therapies, increasing numbers 
of patients with cystic fibrosis become pregnant. The first studies were 
pessimistic and report adverse outcomes on the fetus and the mother. In the 
recent publications, long-term outcome for women with cystic fibrosis does not 
appear to be negatively impacted by pregnancy. Furthermore, the number of women 
successfully completing pregnancy continues to rise. The aim of this review is 
to assess the outcome of pregnancy in women with cystic fibrosis and the impact 
of pregnancy on the disease. It is hoped it will improve the counseling for 
pregnant women with cystic fibrosis and their obstetrical management.

BACKGROUND: The HIV epidemic in the USA is a collection of diverse local 
microepidemics. We aimed to identify optimal combination implementation 
strategies of evidence-based interventions to reach 90% reduction of incidence 
in 10 years, in six US cities that comprise 24·1% of people living with HIV in 
the USA.
METHODS: In this economic modelling study, we used a dynamic HIV transmission 
model calibrated with the best available evidence on epidemiological and 
structural conditions for six US cities: Atlanta (GA), Baltimore (MD), Los 
Angeles (CA), Miami (FL), New York City (NY), and Seattle (WA). We assessed 
23 040 combinations of 16 evidence-based interventions (ie, HIV prevention, 
testing, treatment, engagement, and re-engagement) to identify combination 
strategies providing the greatest health benefit while remaining cost-effective. 
Main outcomes included averted HIV infections, quality-adjusted life-years 
(QALYs), total cost (in 2018 US$), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
(ICER; from the health-care sector perspective, 3% annual discount rate). 
Interventions were implemented at previously documented and ideal (90% coverage 
or adoption) scale-up, and sustained from 2020 to 2030, with outcomes evaluated 
until 2040.
FINDINGS: Optimal combination strategies providing health benefit and 
cost-effectiveness contained between nine (Seattle) and 13 (Miami) individual 
interventions. If implemented at previously documented scale-up, these 
strategies could reduce incidence by between 30·7% (95% credible interval 
19·1-43·7; Seattle) and 50·1% (41·5-58·0; New York City) by 2030, at ICERs 
ranging from cost-saving in Atlanta, Baltimore, and Miami, to $95 416 per QALY 
in Seattle. Incidence reductions reached between 39·5% (26·3-53·8) in Seattle 
and 83·6% (70·8-87·0) in Baltimore at ideal implementation. Total costs of 
implementing strategies across the cities at previously documented scale-up 
reached $559 million per year in 2024; however, costs were offset by long-term 
reductions in new infections and delayed disease progression, with Atlanta, 
Baltimore, and Miami projecting cost savings over the 20 year study period.
INTERPRETATION: Evidence-based interventions can deliver substantial public 
health and economic value; however, complementary strategies to overcome social 
and structural barriers to HIV care will be required to reach national targets 
of the ending the HIV epidemic initiative by 2030.

OBJECTIVE: To measure sexually active life expectancy (SALE) estimating the 
average age at which sexually active life finishes, paying special attention to 
the older population. Variations in SALE according to self-rated health are 
examined.
METHOD: Descriptive analysis with cross-sectional data. SALE was calculated for 
the population by age group (30 to 80 years old) and sex using the Sullivan 
Method, with data from the Human Mortality Database and the National Survey of 
Sexual Health (Spain). The analysis distinguishes between individuals that have 
had coital sex in the last year and those who have not.
RESULTS: Coital activity continues in those aged from 55-59 years old, the SALE 
is 13.3 years in males and 8 in females. Coital activity is related to health 
and sexual health, diverging depending on sex and age group. The males showed a 
more extended sexually active trajectory than the females, but were also more 
influenced by good general health (adding 2.6 and 1 years respectively) and good 
sexual health (5.2 and 4.3 years). SALE also varies when poor health 
(subtracting 2.7 years and adding 2 years) and poor sexual health (subtracting 
2.9 and 1.3 years) are considered.
CONCLUSIONS: the results reveal that sexual health programmes must be extended 
to the older ages, given that it is confirmed that sexual activity continues in 
old age.

Sarcoidosis is a systemic granulomatous disease that can reduce life expectancy 
mainly due to pulmonary fibrosis resulting from granulomatous inflammation The 
lack of vascularization within pulmonary granulomas suggests that macrophages 
localized in the center of these structures are hypoxic. Hypoxia signaling 
pathways are known to be pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic in various 
pathological conditions. Recent data suggest an involvement of the transcription 
factor hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) in the pathogenesis of sarcoidosis. This 
could represent a new research approach for the understanding and therapeutic 
management of sarcoidosis.

The challenge of avoiding over- and under-treatment in older women with ductal 
cancer in situ: A scoping review of existing knowledge gaps and a meta-analysis 
of real-world practice patterns.

Ductal cancer in situ (DCIS) is mainly a screen-detected disease and although 
the risk for breast cancer is age-dependent, most screening programs do not 
include women over the age of 75 years. Older women are usually excluded from 
clinical trials and treatment practices are largely based on observational 
studies or extrapolation of trial results from younger patients, leading to 
either over- or under-treatment of this population. We systematically reviewed 
available electronic databases for DCIS treatment patterns and outcomes in older 
patients 15 years. Inclusion criteria allowed for randomised controlled trials, 
cohort studies, case-control and cross-sectional studies, as well as 
meta-analyses, systematic reviews and position papers. Results showed that, 
although elderly are not necessarily frail, they are generally treated as such 
by physicians, aiming to de-escalate therapeutic interventions. After adjusting 
for frailty, age seems to be a significant factor for less surgery; however, 
older women with DCIS are more probable to receive surgery than their 
counterparts with early invasive cancer. DCIS biology and subtypes are 
independent risk factors for local recurrence or progression to invasive 
carcinoma, if DCIS is under-treated. The end-benefit of surgery, radio- and 
endocrine-therapy depend on additional parameters, such as life expectancy, 
co-morbidities and competing risks of death. Screen-detected DCIS in older women 
is a challenging clinical problem, mainly due to the lack of high-level data. 
Therapeutic strategies should be tailored to life expectancy and performance 
status, DCIS features and patient preference, aiming at combining optimal 
oncological outcomes with maintenance of quality of life.

Osteoporosis (OP) is responsible for an important economic burden, but OP care 
is far from meeting therapeutic guidelines. Some interventions were effective to 
improve OP management. Our objective was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of 
these interventions. Structural interventions and interventions consisting in 
sending educational material were dominant strategies.
PURPOSE: Osteoporosis (OP) causes many osteoporotic fractures worldwide and an 
important economic burden as a result. OP care is far from meeting treatment 
guidelines, but in a recent meta-analysis, we showed that some interventions 
were effective to improve appropriate bone mineral density (BMD) and treatment 
prescriptions. In the context of limited resources, it is of major importance to 
measure these interventions' efficiency. Our objective was to evaluate the 
cost-effectiveness of existing effective intervention types.
METHODS: We used a decision tree incorporating Markov models to compare costs 
and benefits (quality-adjusted life-years or QALYs) between usual care and three 
intervention types: structural (I), direct educational through conversation 
(II), and indirect educational by sending material (III). We adopted the 
collectivity perspective and chose a 30-year time horizon. The model included 
efficacy of interventions and risk of further fracture or death, depending on 
BMD T-score results and OP management, obtained from published literature. The 
model was populated to reflect a French setting. Deterministic and probabilistic 
sensitivity analyses were conducted. Costs were presented in 2018 euros (€).
RESULTS: Interventions type I and III were dominant strategies compared with 
usual care (cost-saving with a QALY gain). Our results were consistent through 
sensitivity analyses.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that structural interventions and indirect 
interventions to improve OP care (BMD and OP treatment prescription), in women 
50 years old with a first fragility fracture, were dominant strategies.

PURPOSE: This study aimed to assess the evaluation of clinical outcomes and 
consequences of complications after cytoreductive surgery (CRS) and hyperthermic 
intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) for the peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC) from 
colorectal cancer.
METHODS: A total 26 patients underwent CRS and HIPEC for PC from colorectal 
cancer between March 2009 and April 2018. All the patients underwent CRS with 
the purpose of complete or near-complete cytoreduction. Intraoperative HIPEC was 
performed simultaneously after the CRS. Mitomycin C was used as chemotherapeutic 
agent for HIPEC.
RESULTS: Median disease-free survival was 27.8 months (range, 13.4-42.2 months). 
Median overall survival was 56.0 months (range, 28.6-83.5 months). The mean 
peritoneal cancer index (PCI) was 8.73 ± 5.54. The distributions thereof were as 
follows: PCI <10, 69.23%; PCI 10-19, 23.08%; and PCI ≥20, 7.69%. The 
completeness of cytoreduction was 96.2% of patients showed CC-0, with 3.8% 
achieved CC-1. The mean operation time was 8.5 hours, and the mean postoperative 
hospital stay was 21.6 days. The overall rate of early postoperative 
complications was 88.5%; the rate of late complications was 34.6%. In the early 
period, most complications were grades I-II complications (65.4%), compared to 
grades III-V (23.1%). All late complications, occurring in 7.7% of patients, 
were grades III-V. There was no treatment-related mortality.
CONCLUSION: Although the complication rate was approximately 88%, but the rate 
of severe complication rate was low. In selective patients with peritoneal 
recurrence, more aggressive strategies for management, such as CRS with HIPEC, 
were able to be considered under the acceptable general condition and 
life-expectancy.

The incidence of metastatic spinal disease is increasing as systemic treatment 
options are improving and concurrently increasing the life expectancy of 
patients, and the interventions are becoming increasingly complex. Treatment 
decisions are also complicated by the increasing armamentarium of surgical 
treatment options. Decision-making frameworks such as NOMS (neurologic, 
oncologic, mechanical, and systemic) help guide practitioners in their decision 
making and provide a structure that would be readily adaptable to the evolving 
landscape of systemic, surgical, and radiation treatments. This article 
describes these decision-making frameworks, discusses their relative benefits 
and shortcomings, and details our approach to treating these complex patients.

INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Severe symptomatic aortic stenosis carries a very 
poor prognosis. Transcatheter aortic valve replacement has been demonstrated to 
change the natural history of the disease. However, it is not known whether the 
probability of survival in older patients receiving this treatment returns to a 
similar value to that in the general population. Our objective was to determine 
survival in these patients vs that in the general population.
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the survival curves of patients older than 
75 years who underwent transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) at our 
hospital and compared them with those in the general population of the same age, 
sex, and geographic region by using data from the Spanish National Institute of 
Statistics.
RESULTS: We analyzed 526 patients. Among postoperative survivors, survival 
curves were similar between the 2 groups during most of the follow-up. In TAVI 
patients, the probability of survival at 1, 3, 5, and 8 years of follow-up was 
90.58% (confidence interval [CI] 95%, 87.54-92.91), 72.51% (95%CI, 67.38-76.97), 
53.23% (95%CI, 46.52-59.48), and 35.73% (95%CI, 27.72-43.80). In the reference 
population, these percentages were 91.93%, 75.63%, 59.6%, and 37.47%.
CONCLUSIONS: Long-term survival in elderly patients undergoing TAVI is 
influenced by postoperative mortality. In patients surviving the postoperative 
period, the probability of survival returns to a similar value to that in the 
general population of the same age, sex, and geographical area.

BACKGROUND: Deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN-DBS) is an 
effective therapy for Parkinson disease (PD). However, cost-effectiveness 
analysis is required because most patients are older adults and decision makers 
must therefore consider whether the long-term effectiveness outweighs the 
initial cost.
METHODS: A Markov decision model was constructed on the basis of a societal 
perspective. The Hoehn and Yahr scale and Unified PD Rating Scale motor score 
were used in the polytomous logistic regression model. Markov Chain Monte Carlo 
simulation was used to initiate the probabilistic cost-effectiveness analysis.
RESULTS: The life-year gained (LYG) in the STN-DBS group and medication group 
was, respectively, 2.937 and 2.632 years at the 3-year follow-up and 7.417 and 
5.971 years at the 10-year follow-up. The quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) 
gained in the STN-DBS and medication groups was, respectively, 1.739 and 1.220 
at the 3-year follow-up and 4.189 and 2.88 at the 10-year follow-up. The 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of STN-DBS compared with medication was 
$147,065 per LYG and $123,436 per QALY gained at the 3-year follow-up and 
$36,833 and $69,033 at the 10-year follow-up, respectively. STN-DBS is an 
optimal strategy when the willingness to pay is $150,000 per LYG and over 
$90,000 per QALY gained in 3 years and when the willingness to pay is over 
$38,000 per LYG and over $41,000 per QALY gained in 10 years.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provided data comparing STN-DBS and medical treatment 
for PD with respect to LYG and QALY gained. STN-DBS was more cost-effective in 
terms of LYG and QALY gained according to the current gross domestic product of 
Taiwan.

Foundation Trust Whitehouse, Fountain Street, Ashton-Under-Lyne, OL6 9RW, UK.

The world population is ageing because of falling fertility and improved life 
expectancy. Knowing this has not helped governments develop sustainable health 
and care policies because the underlying causes and impacts of population ageing 
remain poorly understood. Planning using only population age structure does not 
account for uneven geographical distribution of older people, their health 
characteristics, functional needs or lived experiences. English National Health 
Service (NHS) policy has previously focused on arbitrary age segmentation, 
failing to capture the origins of cumulative disease and functional burden and 
missing the opportunity to incorporate wider determinants of health into 
prevention of poor-quality ageing. This is despite growing international 
evidence that adults living in places with low per capita income and educational 
attainment experience a higher burden of age-related disease. Lack of a credible 
ageing narrative and good quality population health data have contributed to a 
focus on single disease prevention, rather than life course disease aggregation 
and its personal impacts. However, a fully explicated health and care narrative 
incorporating frailty does now give some cause for optimism. In 2017, England 
became the first country to characterise and systematically identify frailty as 
a long-term treatable health condition. This was coincident with a UK 
Government's Industrial Strategy targeting societal ageing. In 2019, the English 
NHS published a funded long-term plan including a major programme focused on 
ageing well. Policy makers, health leaders and clinicians must not squander 
these opportunities but instead pursue frailty prevention and intervention to 
improve the quality of population ageing.

BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Glycopyrronium tosylate (GT) cloth, 2.4% is a topical 
anticholinergic approved in the United States for primary axillary hyperhidrosis 
in patients ≥9 years. This post hoc analysis evaluated long-term response 
(efficacy and safety) in pediatric patients (≥9 to ≤16 years) to GT in the 
44-week, open-label extension (NCT02553798) of two, phase 3, double-blind, 
vehicle-controlled, 4-week trials (NCT02530281, NCT02530294).
METHODS: In the double-blind trials, patients ≥9 years with primary axillary 
hyperhidrosis were randomized 2:1 to once-daily GT:vehicle. Those who completed 
the study could receive open-label GT for up to an additional 44 weeks. Safety 
assessments included treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and local skin 
reactions (LSRs). Descriptive efficacy assessments included gravimetrically 
measured sweat production, Hyperhidrosis Disease Severity Scale response 
(≥2-grade improvement), and Children's Dermatology Life Quality Index.
RESULTS: Of 43 pediatric patients completing either double-blind trial, 38 
(88.4%) entered the open-label extension (age, years: 9 [n = 1], 12 [n = 2], 13 
[n = 7], 14 and 15 [n = 9 each], 16 [n = 10]). The safety profile observed was 
similar to the double-blind trials. Most TEAEs (>95%) were mild/moderate, 
related to anticholinergic activity, and infrequently led to discontinuation 
(n = 1/38 [2.6%]). No pediatric patients experienced a serious TEAE. Most 
anticholinergic TEAEs did not require a dose modification and resolved within 
7 days. Approximately, one-third of patients (n = 13/38 [34.2%]) had LSRs; most 
were mild/moderate in severity. Improvements in efficacy measures were 
maintained from the double-blind trials.
CONCLUSIONS: Long-term, once-daily GT for up to 48 weeks (4-week double-blind 
plus 44 week open label) provides a noninvasive, well-tolerated treatment option 
for pediatric patients with primary axillary hyperhidrosis.

BACKGROUND: Due to increase in the life expectancy and changes related to aging, 
it is important to assess ADL (activities of daily living) in older adults. 
However, there is no standardized protocol available to assess ADLs. Considering 
the limitations of the available tools, a new protocol named Londrina ADL 
protocol was developed for which normative values are unavailable in different 
ethnic groups.
OBJECTIVE: To develop the normative value and reference equation for the 
Londrina ADL protocol on the basis of anthropometric and demographic variables 
in healthy individuals in the age group of 40-60 years among the Indian 
population.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted with 282 healthy individuals 
of both the genders between the age group of 40 and 60 and they were divided 
into 2 groups: 40-49 and 50-60. Each subject was made to perform the Londrina 
ADL protocol twice with a 30 min interval between the two protocols. The 
protocol is composed of 5 activities and the best out of the 2 performances were 
recorded.
RESULTS: The mean time taken among 40-49 years by females is 3.50 ± 0.50 min and 
by males is 3.73 ± 0.43 min. The mean time taken among 50-60 years by females is 
4.25 ± 0.20 min and by males is 4.36 ± 0.18 min. The reference equation to 
predict reference values for the Londrina ADL protocol was as follows: equation 
(1): Londrina ADL predicted = 1.205 + (0.054 × age (years)) + (0.001 × height 
(cm)); equation (2): Londrina ADL predicted = 1.374 + (0.054 × age 
(years)) + (-0.003 × BMI).
CONCLUSION: The reference equation for the time to complete the Londrina ADL 
protocol was based on age and BMI as independent variables and can be useful for 
predicting the performance of healthy individuals.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of encapsulation method on 
antioxidant properties of Hyssop (Hyssopus Officinalis L.) extract. The extracts 
of the Hyssop were obtained by ultrasound assisted techniques, and the amount of 
phenolic compounds was 117.43 ± 9.22 (mg of gallic acid per 100 g of extract). 
The antioxidant activity of extracts in concentrations of 100, 200, 300, and 
400 ppm was measured using DPPH free radical scavenging method and compared with 
100 ppm of TBHQ synthetic antioxidants. The results showed that by increasing in 
concentration of the extract, the antioxidant activity of the extract increased. 
The Lepidium perfoliatum seed gum and Orchis mascula were chosen as coating 
material. Encapsulation was performed by emulsion production method. The 
antioxidant effects of nanocapsules in oil during 40 days of storage at 60°C 
were measured, which increased the oxidation of oil over time. The lowest amount 
of oil oxidation during storage compared to control samples was observed in 
samples containing nano encapsulated Hyssop extract due to reducing in release 
rate of the extract during storage and more protection of the extract. The 
results of this study suggest that encapsulation is an effective way to increase 
the antioxidant activity of the extract and could be increased the shelf life of 
edible oils with natural antioxidants.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Respiratory infections are expressed very soon in the life 
in humoral immunodeficiencies and often lead to chronic irreversible 
complications such as bronchiectasis and chronic airflow limitation. This study 
was conducted to evaluate the pulmonary complications of predominantly antibody 
immunodeficiencies to show the benefits of timely diagnosis and appropriate 
therapy.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: The information of 48 patients involved with a type of 
predominantly antibody immunodeficiencies, including sex, type of primary 
immunodeficiency, age at the onset of symptoms, age at diagnosis, recurrent 
infections, respiratory symptoms, and pulmonary radiological and functional 
abnormalities were recorded and analyzed.
RESULTS: In 48 patients evaluated, the mean age at diagnosis was 25.63 years. 
The mean diagnostic delay was estimated to be 13.62 years. The most recurring 
clinical manifestations, sinusitis (69.6%), otitis (43.5%), and recurrent 
pneumonia were the cause of frequent admissions in 68.8% of these patients. 
Bronchiectasis was frequently found (58.3%) in these patients mostly involving 
the middle and lower lobes (48.8% and 41.5%, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: Respiratory complications, infectious or non-infectious, determine 
the prognosis of the disease in patients with predominantly antibody 
immunodeficiencies. Timely diagnosis and appropriate management may improve life 
expectancy and the quality of life in these patients.

Multiple primary cancers, although uncommon, have been increasing in incidence 
in recent years. This trend is likely due to advances in factors such as 
diagnostic imaging, life expectancy, and interventional modalities with 
associated adverse effects. The patient presented in this case report is a 
59-year-old Caucasian female with an extensive medical history who developed 
multiple primary cancers of the breast, mouth, gastrointestinal system, and lung 
in the span of four years. We attempted to elucidate the possible etiologies and 
risk factors that may have contributed. Given the patient's complex medical and 
social history, interventions, environmental, and genetic predispositions, it is 
impossible to pinpoint a single etiology. Rather, it is more likely that the 
interplay of multiple factors contributed to the findings of this case.

BACKGROUND: Tenofovir alafenamide-emtricitabine (F/TAF) was recently approved as 
a noninferior and potentially safer option than tenofovir disoproxil 
fumarate-emtricitabine (F/TDF) for HIV preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) in the 
United States.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate the greatest possible clinical benefits and economic 
savings attributable to the improved safety profile of F/TAF and the maximum 
price payers should be willing to pay for F/TAF over generic F/TDF.
DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis.
DATA SOURCES: Published literature on F/TDF safety (in persons with and those 
without HIV) and the cost and quality-of-life effects of fractures and end-stage 
renal disease (ESRD).
TARGET POPULATION: Age-stratified U.S. men who have sex with men (MSM) using 
PrEP.
TIME HORIZON: Five years.
PERSPECTIVE: Health care sector.
INTERVENTION: Preexposure prophylaxis with F/TAF versus F/TDF.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Fractures averted, cases of ESRD averted, quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs) saved, costs, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), 
and maximum justifiable price for F/TAF compared with generic F/TDF.
RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: Over a 5-year horizon, compared with F/TDF, F/TAF 
averted 2101 fractures and 25 cases of ESRD for the 123 610 MSM receiving PrEP, 
with an ICER of more than $7 million per QALY. At a 50% discount for generic 
F/TDF ($8300 per year) and a societal willingness to pay up to $100 000 per 
QALY, the maximum fair price for F/TAF was $8670 per year.
RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: Among persons older than 55 years, the ICER for 
F/TAF remained more than $3 million per QALY and the maximum permissible fair 
price for F/TAF was $8970 per year. Results were robust to alternative time 
horizons and PrEP-using population sizes.
LIMITATION: Intermittent use and on-demand PrEP were not considered.
CONCLUSION: In the presence of a generic F/TDF alternative, the improved safety 
of F/TAF is worth no more than an additional $370 per person per year.
