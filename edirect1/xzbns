propensity score matched to younger patients. Perioperative and postoperative 
functional and oncologic outcomes for the two groups were compared.
RESULTS: Full nerve sparing as well as the ease of nerve sparing were similar in 
2 groups. Intra-operative complications were comparable. Postoperative 
complication occurrence rates were similar. At mean follow up of 34.1 months and 
37.2 months respectively in younger and older patients, the continence rate was 
comparable in 2 groups (91.3% and 87.3%).Average time to continence and potency 
were similar in 2 groups. A greater proportion of younger patients became potent 
than elderly (52.3% vs 33.5%,p < 0.001).The biochemical recurrence (BCR) rate 
was comparable in 2 groups (7.8% vs 8.3%; p = 0.79). The mean time to BCR was 
also comparable in 2 groups (16 months vs 22.6 months; p = 0.07).
CONCLUSIONS: In appropriately selected patients (minimal comorbidities with CCI 
≤ 2, life expectancy >10 years, localized prostate cancer) RARP is a reasonable 
option in patients ≥ 7 0 years and provides comparable perioperative, functional 
and intermediate term oncologic outcomes as compared to younger patients.

BACKGROUND: Self-management (SM) support for patients with chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease (COPD) is variable in its coverage, content, method and timing 
of delivery. There is insufficient evidence for which SM interventions are the 
most effective and cost-effective.
OBJECTIVES: To undertake (1) a systematic review of the evidence for the 
effectiveness of SM interventions commencing within 6 weeks of hospital 
discharge for an exacerbation for COPD (review 1); (2) a systematic review of 
the qualitative evidence about patient satisfaction, acceptance and barriers to 
SM interventions (review 2); (3) a systematic review of the cost-effectiveness 
of SM support interventions within 6 weeks of hospital discharge for an 
exacerbation of COPD (review 3); (4) a cost-effectiveness analysis and economic 
model of post-exacerbation SM support compared with usual care (UC) (economic 
model); and (5) a wider systematic review of the evidence of the effectiveness 
of SM support, including interventions (such as pulmonary rehabilitation) in 
which there are significant components of SM, to identify which components are 
the most important in reducing exacerbations, hospital admissions/readmissions 
and improving quality of life (review 4).
METHODS: The following electronic databases were searched from inception to May 
2012: MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, EMBASE, 
Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and Science Citation 
Index [Institute of Scientific Information (ISI)]. Subject-specific databases 
were also searched: PEDro physiotherapy evidence database, PsycINFO and the 
Cochrane Airways Group Register of Trials. Ongoing studies were sourced through 
the metaRegister of Current Controlled Trials, International Standard Randomised 
Controlled Trial Number database, World Health Organization International 
Clinical Trials Registry Platform Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov. Specialist 
abstract and conference proceedings were sourced through ISI's Conference 
Proceedings Citation Index and British Library's Electronic Table of Contents 
(Zetoc). Hand-searching through European Respiratory Society, the American 
Thoracic Society and British Thoracic Society conference proceedings from 2010 
to 2012 was also undertaken, and selected websites were also examined. Title, 
abstracts and full texts of potentially relevant studies were scanned by two 
independent reviewers. Primary studies were included if ≈90% of the population 
had COPD, the majority were of at least moderate severity and reported on any 
intervention that included a SM component or package. Accepted study designs and 
outcomes differed between the reviews. Risk of bias for randomised controlled 
trials (RCTs) was assessed using the Cochrane tool. Random-effects meta-analysis 
was used to combine studies where appropriate. A Markov model, taking a 30-year 
time horizon, compared a SM intervention immediately following a hospital 
admission for an acute exacerbation with UC. Incremental costs and 
quality-adjusted life-years were calculated, with sensitivity analyses.
RESULTS: From 13,355 abstracts, 10 RCTs were included for review 1, one study 
each for reviews 2 and 3, and 174 RCTs for review 4. Available studies were 
heterogeneous and many were of poor quality. Meta-analysis identified no 
evidence of benefit of post-discharge SM support on admissions [hazard ratio 
(HR) 0.78, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.52 to 1.17], mortality (HR 1.07, 95% 
CI 0.74 to 1.54) and most other health outcomes. A modest improvement in 
health-related quality of life (HRQoL) was identified but this was possibly 
biased due to high loss to follow-up. The economic model was speculative due to 
uncertainty in impact on readmissions. Compared with UC, post-discharge SM 
support (delivered within 6 weeks of discharge) was more costly and resulted in 
better outcomes (£683 cost difference and 0.0831 QALY gain). Studies assessing 
the effect of individual components were few but only exercise significantly 
improved HRQoL (3-month St George's Respiratory Questionnaire 4.87, 95% CI 3.96 
to 5.79). Multicomponent interventions produced an improved HRQoL compared with 
UC (mean difference 6.50, 95% CI 3.62 to 9.39, at 3 months). Results were 
consistent with a potential reduction in admissions. Interventions with more 
enhanced care from health-care professionals improved HRQoL and reduced 
admissions at 1-year follow-up. Interventions that included supervised or 
unsupervised structured exercise resulted in significant and clinically 
important improvements in HRQoL up to 6 months.
LIMITATIONS: This review was based on a comprehensive search strategy that 
should have identified most of the relevant studies. The main limitations result 
from the heterogeneity of studies available and widespread problems with their 
design and reporting.
CONCLUSIONS: There was little evidence of benefit of providing SM support to 
patients shortly after discharge from hospital, although effects observed were 
consistent with possible improvement in HRQoL and reduction in hospital 
admissions. It was not easy to tease out the most effective components of SM 
support packages, although interventions containing exercise seemed the most 
effective. Future work should include qualitative studies to explore barriers 
and facilitators to SM post exacerbation and novel approaches to affect 
behaviour change, tailored to the individual and their circumstances. Any new 
trials should be properly designed and conducted, with special attention to 
reducing loss to follow-up. Individual participant data meta-analysis may help 
to identify the most effective components of SM interventions.

Assessment of mitral valve disease: a review of imaging modalities.

Mitral valve disease (MVD) related to mitral valve prolapse (MVP), coronary 
artery disease (CAD), and calcific mitral stenosis, is increasing in prevalence 
across the USA and Europe in the context of a longer life expectancy and aging 
population. In developing countries, rheumatic heart disease remains a major 
cause of MVD. Echocardiography represents the primary diagnostic modality for 
assessment of the mitral valve (MV). With the implementation of 
three-dimensional imaging, echocardiography has become an indispensable tool to 
evaluate the morphology, geometry, and function of the MV apparatus in the 
pre-operative setting. However, recognition of its limitations and advances in 
newer technologies have led to a growing interest in other imaging modalities 
such as cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR). Although still not widely available, 
CMR is an essential complement to echocardiography, especially when poor image 
quality, significant variability in flow diameter measurements, and geometric 
assumptions of flow orifice preclude accurate quantification of mitral 
regurgitation on echocardiographic images. In addition, CMR can reliably provide 
quantitative determination of ventricular volumes and function, hence 
facilitating surgical decision-making when serial linear echocardiographic 
measurements are discrepant. Finally, CMR assessment of fibrosis using late 
gadolinium enhancement allows better understanding of the interactions between 
MVD and the myocardium in both MVP and MVD related to CAD or other myopathy. In 
this review, we summarize the role of the available imaging modalities in 
understanding valvular pathology and determining severity of regurgitation or 
stenosis. Recently published valvular guidelines highlight the importance of 
monitoring MVD progression and the shift to intervention earlier in the course 
of disease. In this context, we also discuss the potential role of 
echocardiography and CMR in identifying early stages of MVD and/or pre-clinical 
markers of myocardial dysfunction.

Cellular senescence plays an important role in the process of aging and is often 
associated with age-related diseases. Senescence was originally considered as a 
barrier to cell reprogramming, however we developed a strategy to overcome this 
hurdle and derive induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from senescent cells 
and cells from centenarians. Furthermore we showed that the newly generated 
iPSCs could be re-differentiated into fully rejuvenated cells. That has 
increased the known beneficial properties of iPSCs to include them as a tool to 
model age-related diseases or even to cure them through cell therapy. In this 
review, we describe the hallmarks of cellular senescence before presenting how 
we reprogrammed aged and senescent cells into iPSCs and obtained rejuvenated 
re-differentiated cells. Finally, we take an interest in the way iPSCs can be 
used to understand and cure age-related diseases and we present their advantages 
for patient-specific therapy.

BACKGROUND: In the international randomised phase 3 CORRECT trial (NCT01103323), 
regorafenib significantly improved overall survival versus placebo in patients 
with treatment-refractory metastatic colorectal cancer. Of the 760 patients in 
CORRECT, 111 were Asian (mostly Japanese). This phase 3 trial was done to assess 
regorafenib in a broader population of Asian patients with refractory metastatic 
colorectal cancer than was studied in CORRECT.
METHODS: In this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, 
phase 3 trial done in 25 hospitals in mainland China, Hong Kong, South Korea, 
Taiwan, and Vietnam, we recruited Asian patients aged 18 years or older with 
progressive metastatic colorectal cancer who had received at least two previous 
treatment lines or were unable to tolerate standard treatments. Patients had to 
have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1, life 
expectancy of at least 3 months, and adequate bone marrow, liver, and renal 
function, without other uncontrolled medical disorders. We randomly allocated 
patients (2:1; with a computer-generated unicentric randomisation list [prepared 
by the study funder] and interactive voice response system; block size of six; 
stratified by metastatic site [single vs multiple organs] and time from 
diagnosis of metastatic disease [<18 months vs ≥18 months]) to receive oral 
regorafenib 160 mg once daily or placebo on days 1-21 of each 28 day cycle; 
patients in both groups were also to receive best supportive care. Participants, 
investigators, and the study funder were masked to treatment assignment. The 
primary endpoint was overall survival, and we analysed data on an 
intention-to-treat basis. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, 
number NCT01584830.
FINDINGS: Between April 29, 2012, and Feb 6, 2013, we screened 243 patients and 
randomly assigned 204 patients to receive either regorafenib (136 [67%]) or 
placebo (68 [33%]). After a median follow-up of 7·4 months (IQR 4·3-12·2), 
overall survival was significantly better with regorafenib than it was with 
placebo (hazard ratio 0·55, 95% CI 0·40-0·77, one-sided p=0·00016; median 
overall survival 8·8 months [95% CI 7·3-9·8] in the regorafenib group vs 6·3 
months [4·8-7·6] in the placebo group). Drug-related adverse events occurred in 
132 (97%) of 136 regorafenib recipients and 31 (46%) of 68 placebo recipients. 
The most frequent grade 3 or higher regorafenib-related adverse events were 
hand-foot skin reaction (22 [16%] of 136 patients in the regorafenib group vs 
none in the placebo group), hypertension (15 [11%] vs two [3%] of 68 patients in 
the placebo group), hyperbilirubinaemia (nine [7%] vs one [1%]), 
hypophosphataemia (nine [7%] vs none), alanine aminotransferase concentration 
increases (nine [7%] vs none), aspartate aminotransferase concentration 
increases (eight [6%] vs none), lipase concentration increases (six [4%] vs one 
[1%]), and maculopapular rash (six [4%] vs none). Drug-related serious adverse 
events occurred in 12 (9%) patients in the regorafenib group and three (4%) in 
the placebo group.
INTERPRETATION: This phase 3 trial is the second to show an overall survival 
benefit with regorafenib compared with placebo in patients with 
treatment-refractory metastatic colorectal cancer, substantiating the role of 
regorafenib as an important treatment option for patients whose disease has 
progressed after standard treatments. In this trial, preceding standard 
treatments did not necessarily include targeted treatments. Adverse events were 
generally consistent with the known safety profile of regorafenib in this 
setting.

OBJECTIVE: Blood loss following total knee arthroplasty is a serious side-effect 
of surgery and impacts on patient recovery and quality of life. The aim of this 
study was to assess the effect of postoperative knee position during recovery on 
blood loss and range of motion.
METHODS: One hundred consecutive patients, with stage III or IV degenerative 
osteoarthritis, were enrolled in the study and randomized equally between two 
treatment groups: flexion and extension. In the flexion group, the affected leg 
was elevated postoperatively by 45° at the hip, with 45° flexion at the knee, 
while patients in the extension group had the knee extended fully. Blood loss, 
pre- and postoperative hemoglobin levels, and range of motion were recorded 
together with duration of hospital stay and complications.
RESULTS: Calculated blood loss, hidden blood loss, and postoperative hemoglobin 
levels between the two groups were significantly different, with patients in the 
flexion group experiencing lower blood loss than those in the extension group 
(P < 0.05). After 6-week rehabilitation, patients from both groups attained a 
similar range of motion in the joint. Duration of hospital stay was shorter in 
the flexion group by 1.6 days. Wound infection rates were similar in both 
groups, and we observed no proven deep vein thrombosis.
CONCLUSIONS: Postoperative elevation of the hip by 45°, with 45° knee flexion, 
is an effective and simple method of reducing blood loss and hospital stay 
following unilateral primary total knee arthroplasty.

Despite the potential for patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) and 
experience measures (PREMs) to enhance understanding of patient experiences and 
outcomes they have not, to date, been widely incorporated into renal registry 
datasets. This report summarizes the main points learned from an ERA-EDTA 
QUEST-funded consensus meeting on how to routinely collect PROMs and PREMs in 
renal registries in Europe. In preparation for the meeting, we surveyed all 
European renal registries to establish current or planned efforts to collect 
PROMs/PREMs. A systematic review of the literature was performed. Publications 
reporting barriers and/or facilitators to PROMs/PREMs collection by registries 
were identified and a narrative synthesis undertaken. A group of renal registry 
representatives, PROMs/PREMs experts and patient representatives then met to (i) 
share any experience renal registries in Europe have in this area; (ii) 
establish how patient-reported data might be collected by understanding how 
registries currently collect routine data and how patient-reported data is 
collected in other settings; (iii) harmonize the future collection of 
patient-reported data by renal registries in Europe by agreeing upon preferred 
instruments and (iv) to identify the barriers to routine collection of 
patient-reported data in renal registries in Europe. In total, 23 of the 45 
European renal registries responded to the survey. Two reported experience in 
collecting PROMs and three stated that they were actively exploring ways to do 
so. The systematic review identified 157 potentially relevant articles of which 
9 met the inclusion criteria and were analysed for barriers and facilitators to 
routine PROM/PREM collection. Thirteen themes were identified and mapped to a 
three-stage framework around establishing the need, setting up and maintaining 
the routine collection of PROMs/PREMs. At the consensus meeting some PROMs 
instruments were agreed for routine renal registry collection (the generic 
SF-12, the disease-specific KDQOL™-36 and EQ-5D-5L to be able to derive 
quality-adjusted life years), but further work was felt to be needed before 
recommending PREMs. Routinely collecting PROMs and PREMs in renal registries is 
important if we are to better understand what matters to patients but it is 
likely to be challenging; close international collaboration will be beneficial.

BACKGROUND: To demonstrate how assessment of life expectancy and loss in 
expectation of life can be used to address a wide range of research questions of 
public health interest pertaining to the prognosis of cancer patients.
METHODS: We identified 135,092 cases of colon adenocarcinoma diagnosed during 
1961-2011 from the population-based Swedish Cancer Register. Flexible parametric 
survival models for relative survival were used to estimate the life expectancy 
and the loss in expectation of life.
RESULTS: The loss in expectation of life for males aged 55 at diagnosis was 13.5 
years (95 % CI 13.2-13.8) in 1965 and 12.8 (12.4-13.3) in 2005. For males aged 
85 the corresponding figures were 3.21 (3.15-3.28) and 2.10 (2.04-2.17). The 
pattern was similar for females, but slightly greater loss in expectation of 
life. The loss in expectation of life is reduced given survival up to a certain 
time point post diagnosis. Among patients diagnosed in 2011, 945 life years 
could potentially be saved if the colon cancer survival among males could be 
brought to the same level as for females.
CONCLUSION: Assessment of loss in expectation of life facilitates the 
understanding of the impact of cancer, both on individual and population level. 
Clear improvements in survival among colon cancer patients have led to a gain in 
life expectancy, partly due to a general increase in survival from all causes.

A career as an elite-class male athlete seems to improve metabolic heath in 
later life and is also associated with longer life expectancy. Telomere length 
is a biomarker of biological cellular ageing and could thus predict morbidity 
and mortality. The main aim of this study was to assess the association between 
vigorous elite-class physical activity during young adulthood on later life 
leukocyte telomere length (LTL). The study participants consist of former male 
Finnish elite athletes (n = 392) and their age-matched controls (n = 207). 
Relative telomere length was determined from peripheral blood leukocytes by 
quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Volume of leisure-time 
physical activity (LTPA) was self-reported and expressed in metabolic equivalent 
hours. No significant difference in mean age-adjusted LTL in late life (p = 
0.845) was observed when comparing former male elite athletes and their 
age-matched controls. Current volume of LTPA had no marked influence on mean 
age-adjusted LTL (p for trend 0.788). LTL was inversely associated with age (p = 
0.004).Our study findings suggest that a former elite athlete career is not 
associated with LTL later in life. Key pointsA career as an elite-class athlete 
is associated with improved metabolic health in late life and is associated with 
longer life expectancy.A career as an elite-class athlete during young adulthood 
was not associated with leukocyte telomere length in later life.Current volume 
of leisure-time physical activity did not influence telomere length in later 
life.

Progeria is a rare genetic disease that manifests with progressive symptoms 
eventually leading to death. The only current treatment protocol of such 
patients is symptom based. However, recent trials are testing potential and 
promising drugs to treat the underlying genetic mutation and increase life 
expectancy of such patients.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the reduction in the vaccine preventable burden of cancer 
in men if boys are vaccinated along with girls against oncogenic human 
papillomavirus (HPV).
DESIGN: Bayesian evidence synthesis approach used to evaluate the impact of 
vaccination against HPV types 16 and 18 on the burden of anal, penile, and 
oropharyngeal carcinomas among heterosexual men and men who have sex with men. 
The reduced transmission of vaccine-type HPV from vaccination of girls was 
assumed to lower the risk of HPV associated cancer in all men but not to affect 
the excess risk of HPV associated cancers among men who have sex with men.
SETTING: General population in the Netherlands.
INTERVENTION: Inclusion of boys aged 12 into HPV vaccination programmes.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Quality adjusted life years (QALYs) and numbers needed to 
vaccinate.
RESULTS: Before HPV vaccination, 14.9 (95% credible interval 12.2 to 18.1) QALYs 
per thousand men were lost to vaccine preventable cancers associated with HPV in 
the Netherlands. This burden would be reduced by 37% (28% to 48%) if the vaccine 
uptake among girls remains at the current level of 60%. To prevent one 
additional case of cancer among men, 795 boys (660 to 987) would need to be 
vaccinated; with tumour specific numbers for anal, penile, and oropharyngeal 
cancer of 2162, 3486, and 1975, respectively. The burden of HPV related cancer 
in men would be reduced by 66% (53% to 805) if vaccine uptake among girls 
increases to 90%. In that case, 1735 boys (1240 to 2900) would need to be 
vaccinated to prevent an additional case; with tumour specific numbers for anal, 
penile, and oropharyngeal cancer of 2593, 29107, and 6484, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Men will benefit indirectly from vaccination of girls but remain at 
risk of cancers associated with HPV. The incremental benefit of vaccinating boys 
when vaccine uptake among girls is high is driven by the prevention of anal 
carcinomas, which underscores the relevance of HPV prevention efforts for men 
who have sex with men.

Fourscore in South Dakota: lowering risk for longer life.

Kightlinger L.

Life expectancy at birth in South Dakota is 79.5 years, ranking 18th longest in 
the U.S. South Dakota county-level life expectancies range from 73.2-82.1 years. 
County-level life expectancies correlate significantly with tobacco smoking, 
physical inactivity, obesity, diabetes, poverty and infant mortality rates, 
where counties with higher rates of smoking, inactivity, obesity, diabetes, 
poverty and infant mortality have shorter life expectancies. The critical 
disparity in life expectancy is the 12-year gap between American Indian and 
white South Dakotans.

Medical College, Yuxi, China, at1029@163.com.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Clopidogrel or aspirin are indicated for patients 
with recent ischemic stroke (IS) or established peripheral artery disease (PAD). 
We compared the cost effectiveness of clopidogrel with that of aspirin in 
Chinese patients with recent IS or established PAD.
METHODS: A discrete-event simulation was developed to evaluate the economic 
implications of secondary prevention with clopidogrel versus aspirin. All 
available evidence was derived from clinical studies. Costs from a Chinese 
healthcare perspective in 2013 US dollars and quality-adjusted life-years 
(QALYs) were projected over patients' lifetimes. Uncertainties were addressed 
using sensitivity analyses.
RESULTS: Compared with aspirin, clopidogrel yielded a marginally increased life 
expectancy by 0.46 and 0.21 QALYs at an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 
$US5246 and $US9890 per QALY in patients with recent IS and established PAD, 
respectively. One-way sensitivity analyses showed that the evaluation of 
patients with PAD and recent IS was robust except for the parameter of patient 
age. Given a willingness-to-pay of $US19,877 per QALY gained, clopidogrel had a 
probability of 90 and 68% of being cost effective in the recent IS or 
established PAD subgroups compared with aspirin, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The analysis suggests that clopidogrel for secondary prevention is 
cost effective for patients with either PAD or recent IS in a Chinese setting in 
comparison with aspirin.

Multi-attribute utility instruments (MAUIs) are increasingly being used as a 
means of quantifying utility for the calculation of quality-adjusted life-years 
within the context of cost utility analysis. Traditionally, MAUIs have been 
developed and applied in adult populations. However, increasingly, researchers 
in health economics and other disciplines are recognising the importance of the 
measurement and valuation of health in both children and adolescents. Presently, 
there are nine generic MAUIs available internationally that have been used in 
paediatric populations: the Quality of Well-Being Scale (QWB), the Health 
Utility Index Mark 2 (HUI2), the HUI3, the Sixteen-dimensional measure of 
health-related quality of life (HRQoL) (16D), the Seventeen-dimensional measure 
of HRQoL (17D), the Assessment of Quality of Life 6-Dimension (AQoL-6D) 
Adolescent, the Child Health Utility 9D (CHU9D), the EQ-5D Youth version 
(EQ-5D-Y) and the Adolescent Health Utility Measure (AHUM). This paper 
critically reviews the development and application of the above nine MAUIs and 
discusses the specific challenges of health utility measurement in children and 
adolescents. Areas for further research relating to the development and 
application of generic MAUIs in paediatric populations are highlighted.

The study rationale was to provide a detailed overview of the costs, quality of 
life and mortality of hip fractures in Portugal. Mean individual 
fracture-related costs were estimated at €13,434 [12,290; 14,576] for the first 
year and €5985 [4982; 7045] for the second year following the fracture.
INTRODUCTION: Osteoporotic fractures represent a remarkable burden to health 
care systems and societies worldwide, which will tend to increase as life 
expectancy expands and lifestyle changes favour osteoporosis. The 
cost-effectiveness evaluation of intervention strategies demands accurate data 
on the epidemiological and economical reality to be addressed.
METHODS: Information was collected retrospectively on consumption of resources 
and changes in quality of life attributable to fracture as well as mortality, 
regarding 186 patients randomly selected to represent the distribution of hip 
fractures in the Portuguese population, in terms of gender, age and geographical 
provenience. Data were cross-tabulated with socio-demographic variables and 
individual resource consumption to estimate the burden of disease. A societal 
perspective was adopted, including direct and indirect costs. Multivariate 
analyses were carried out to assess the main determinants of health-related 
quality of life (HrQoL).
RESULTS: Mean individual fracture-related costs were estimated at €13,434 
[12,290; 14,576] for the first year and €5985 [4982; 7045] for the second year 
following the fracture. In 2011 the economic burden attributable to osteoporotic 
hip fractures in Portugal could be estimated at €216 million. Mean reduction in 
HrQoL 12 months after fracture was estimated at 0.34. Regression analysis showed 
that age was associated with a higher loss of HrQoL, whereas education had the 
opposing effect. We observed 12 % excess mortality in the first year after hip 
fracture, when compared to the gender and age-matched general population.
CONCLUSIONS: Results of this study indicate that osteoporotic hip fractures are, 
also in Portugal, despite its low incidence of fractures and cost per event, 
associated with a high societal burden, in terms of costs, loss in HrQoL and 
mortality. These data provide valuable input to the design and selection of 
fracture prevention strategies.

BACKGROUND: The considerably lower average life expectancy of Aboriginal and 
Torres Strait Islander Australians, compared with non-Aboriginal and non-Torres 
Strait Islander Australians, has been widely reported. Prevalence data for 
chronic disease and health risk factors are needed to provide evidence based 
estimates for Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders population 
health planning. Representative surveys for these populations are difficult due 
to complex methodology. The focus of this paper is to describe in detail the 
methodological challenges and resolutions of a representative South Australian 
Aboriginal population-based health survey.
METHODS: Using a stratified multi-stage sampling methodology based on the 
Australian Bureau of Statistics 2006 Census with culturally appropriate and 
epidemiological rigorous methods, 11,428 randomly selected dwellings were 
approached from a total of 209 census collection districts. All persons eligible 
for the survey identified as Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander and were 
selected from dwellings identified as having one or more Aboriginal person(s) 
living there at the time of the survey.
RESULTS: Overall, the 399 interviews from an eligible sample of 691 SA 
Aboriginal adults yielded a response rate of 57.7%. These face-to-face 
interviews were conducted by ten interviewers retained from a total of 27 
trained Aboriginal interviewers. Challenges were found in three main areas: 
identification and recruitment of participants; interviewer recruitment and 
retainment; and using appropriate engagement with communities. These challenges 
were resolved, or at least mainly overcome, by following local protocols with 
communities and their representatives, and reaching agreement on the process of 
research for Aboriginal people.
CONCLUSIONS: Obtaining a representative sample of Aboriginal participants in a 
culturally appropriate way was methodologically challenging and required high 
levels of commitment and resources. Adhering to these principles has resulted in 
a rich and unique data set that provides an overview of the self-reported health 
status for Aboriginal people living in South Australia. This process provides 
some important principles to be followed when engaging with Aboriginal people 
and their communities for the purpose of health research.

Although the achievement of deep and long lasting remissions is a realistic goal 
of therapy in the fit patient with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), this 
disease typically affects elderly patients who also show one or more concomitant 
pathological conditions or functional limitations that have an additive effects 
on the reduction of patient's life expectancy and represent major limitations in 
the adoption of standard therapies. In these unfit but typical patients with 
CLL, the goals of treatment may vary from achieving good remissions without 
severe toxicity to simple palliation. Differently from the past when the 
definition of patient medical status was mainly based on age and was left to the 
subjective assessment of the physician, today there are several tools to define 
in a standardized, reproducible, and multidimensional way the initial patient 
assessment and to plan treatment goals in an objective way. In this review, an 
overview of the current approaches to the definition of the medical fitness of 
the patient is provided along with some practical suggestions to integrate these 
tools in the clinical approach to elderly patients with CLL.

BACKGROUND: Lung cancer is a fatal malignancy with high mortality and short 
survival time. The aim of this study was to estimate survival rates of Iranian 
patients with lung cancer and its associate predictive factors.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was conducted on 355 patients admitted to 
hospitals of West Azerbaijan in the year 2007. The patients were followed up by 
phone calls until the end of June 2014. The survival rate was estimated using 
the Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test for comparison. The Cox's proportional 
hazard model was used to investigate the effect of various variables on patient 
survival time, including age, sex, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) 
performance, smoking status, tumor type, tumor stage, treatment, metastasis, and 
blood hemoglobin concentration.
RESULTS: Of the 355 patients under study, 240 died and 115 were censored. The 
mean and median survival time of patients was 13 and 4.8 months, respectively. 
According to the results of Kaplan-Meier method, 1, 2, and 3 years survival 
rates were 39%, 18%, and 0.07%, respectively. Based on Cox regression analysis, 
the risk of death was associated with ECOG group V (1.83, 95% CI: 1 CONCLUSIONS: 
The survival time of the patients with lung cancer is very short. While early 
diagnosis may improve the life expectancy effective treatment is not available.

AIM: To study the cost-effectiveness of high-resolution microendoscopy (HRME) in 
an esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) screening program in China.
METHODS: A decision analytic Markov model of ESCC was developed. Separate model 
analyses were conducted for cohorts consisting of an average-risk population or 
a high-risk population in China. Hypothetical 50-year-old individuals were 
followed until age 80 or death. We compared three different strategies for both 
cohorts: (1) no screening; (2) standard endoscopic screening with Lugol's iodine 
staining; and (3) endoscopic screening with Lugol's iodine staining and an HRME. 
Model parameters were estimated from the literature as well as from GLOBOCAN, 
the Cancer Incidence and Mortality Worldwide cancer database. Health states in 
the model included non-neoplasia, mild dysplasia, moderate dysplasia, high-grade 
dysplasia, intramucosal carcinoma, operable cancer, inoperable cancer, and 
death. Separate ESCC incidence transition rates were generated for the 
average-risk and high-risk populations. Costs in Chinese currency were converted 
to international dollars (I$) and were adjusted to 2012 dollars using the 
Consumer Price Index.
RESULTS: The main outcome measurements for this study were quality-adjusted life 
years (QALYs) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). For the 
average-risk population, the HRME screening strategy produced 0.043 more QALYs 
than the no screening strategy at an additional cost of I$646, resulting in an 
ICER of I$11808 per QALY gained. Standard endoscopic screening was weakly 
dominated. Among the high-risk population, when the HRME screening strategy was 
compared with the standard screening strategy, the ICER was I$8173 per QALY. For 
both the high-risk and average-risk screening populations, the HRME screening 
strategy appeared to be the most cost-effective strategy, producing ICERs below 
the willingness-to-pay threshold, I$23500 per QALY. One-way sensitivity analysis
