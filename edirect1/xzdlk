Menopause is one of the most important events in the female reproductive life 
cycle, being a transition from the reproductive to the nonreproductive stage. It 
is a milestone that may have a negative influence on quality of life and one 
that brings in several physiological changes that affect the life of a woman 
permanently. According to a Polish epidemiological forecast, in 2050 the average 
female life expectancy will be 87.5, which is 6.4 years longer than today. Thus, 
the life expectancy of women who will be 60 or older in 2050 will also extend. 
Therefore, strategies need to be optimized to maintain postreproductive health, 
in part because of increased longevity. The general gynecologist can expect to 
see more elderly female patients as the population continues to age. Office 
management of the gynecologic problems of geriatric women requires sensitivity 
to the special needs of this group. Nowadays, most women spend more than 
one-third of their lives after menopause; therefore there is plenty of 
opportunity for gynecologists to cater to the needs of postmenopausal women. It 
is in their scope of practice to help postmenopausal women through "healthy 
aging". In this review we look into screenings, early identification, lifestyle 
modifications and appropriate intervention that may prevent many chronic 
conditions that cause morbidity and mortality during the postmenopausal years.

OBJECTIVE: Ovarian cancer is known as the seventh most common cancer among 
women, accounting for about 4% of all cancers associated with the females.
METHOD: This is a descriptive cross-sectional study based on cancer incidence 
data and cancer mortality rates from the Global Cancer Data in 2018. The 
incidence and mortality rates were estimated and ovarian cancer distribution 
maps for world countries were drawn. To analyze data, correlation and regression 
tests were used to evaluate association between its incidence and mortality with 
human development index (HDI).
RESULTS: Results revealed a direct and significant correlation between ovarian 
cancer incidence (R = 0.409, P < 0.0001) and mortality (R = 0.193, P < 0.05) 
with HDI. It also projected a direct and significant correlation between 
incidence with Gross National Income per 1,000 capita (GNI), mean years of 
schooling (MYS), life expectancy at birth (LEB) and expected years of schooling 
(EYS) (P < 0.0001). The findings also demonstrated a direct and significant 
correlation between mortality and GNI, MYS, LEB as well as EYS (P < 0.05). The 
linear regression model showed that a higher MYS [B = 0.2, CI 95%: (-0.03, 0.5)] 
can significantly augment the incidence of ovarian cancer while an increased MYS 
[B = 0.2, CI 95% (0.03, 0.4)] can induce mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: Given the direct and significant correlation between ovarian cancer 
incidence and mortality with HDI, attention to risk factors in these countries 
can be effective in curbing its incidence and mortality.

Haemophilia is an inherited bleeding disorder in which the haemostatic defect 
results from deficiency of coagulation factor VIII (FVIII) in haemophilia A or 
factor IX (FIX) in haemophilia B. Traditional treatments for haemophilia have 
largely worked by directly replacing the missing coagulation factor, but face 
challenges due to the short half-life of FVIII and FIX, the need for frequent 
intravenous access and development of neutralising antibodies to coagulation 
factors (inhibitors). Recent advances in haemophilia therapy have worked to 
eliminate these challenges. Half-life extension of factor concentrates has 
lengthened the time needed between infusions, enhancing quality of life. 
Subcutaneous administration of therapeutics utilising alternative mechanisms to 
overcome inhibitors have expanded the options to prevent bleeding. Finally, 
initial successes with gene therapy offer a cautious hope for durable cure. In 
the present review, we will discuss currently available treatments, as well as 
highlight therapeutics in various stages of clinical development for the 
treatment of haemophilia A and B. In this review, we present therapies that are 
currently clinically available and highlight therapeutics that are in various 
stages of clinical development for the treatment of haemophilia A and B.

Aim: To evaluate the efficacy of trastuzumab and potential risk factors on 
survival in patients with HER2-positive metastatic gastric cancer. Methods: We 
retrospectively included 138 patients who were given trastuzumab-based 
chemotherapy as first-line treatment and analyzed the relationship between 
clinical response rates and maintenance treatment status and survival outcomes. 
Results: In the whole group, the median progression-free survival and overall 
survival were 10.2 and 16 months, respectively. Clinical response was obtained 
in 79% of patients. The median overall survival was 16.9 months in follow-up 
group and 19.0 months in the maintenance group in patients with clinical 
response. Continuation of maintenance trastuzumab created a significant survival 
advantage (p = 0.021). Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 2 
(hazard ratio [HR]: 2.02), grade 3 (HR: 1.78) and more than four metastatic 
lesions (HR: 1.67) were determined as risk factors for death. Conclusion: We 
recommend the continuation of maintenance trastuzumab in patients with clinical 
response, but those with identified risk factors may not benefit from treatment 
because life expectancy may be low.

Plain Language Summary: Gastric cancer has a poor prognosis despite available 
treatments. Inclusive studies are still needed with real-life data. Our research 
retrospectively evaluated the efficacy of trastuzumab and potential risk factors 
on survival in patients with HER2-positive metastatic gastric cancer who 
received trastuzumab-based chemotherapy as first-line therapy. In total, 
138 patients were included in this study. Clinical response to trastuzumab-based 
chemotherapy was obtained in 79% of the patients. We also divided the patients 
who had a clinical response into two groups according to whether they received 
maintenance therapy. In the present study, trastuzumab administration had 
compatible survival outcomes with recent studies. Continuation of trastuzumab 
maintenance treatment provided a survival advantage in patients with clinical 
response. We suppose that maintenance trastuzumab may be recommended in patients 
with clinical responses to the first-line treatment. Furthermore, Eastern 
Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status 2, grade 3 and having more than 
four metastatic lesions were determined as risk factors for death. Therefore, 
although we recommend maintenance of trastuzumab in patients with clinical 
response, those with identified risk factors may not benefit from treatment.

Recent data suggest the use of radiotherapy alone (RT) in Early-Stage Follicular 
Lymphoma is declining. Cost-effectiveness analysis of treatments has not been 
performed. We constructed a partitioning model (15-year horizon) to compare RT, 
combined-modality therapy (CMT) and immunochemotherapy with rituximab 
maintenance (ICT + RM) from a PET-staged cohort from the Australian Lymphoma 
Alliance. Lifetime direct health care costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) 
and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated. AUD $75,000 
was defined as the willingness-to-pay threshold (WTP). The direct healthcare 
costs were: RT $12,791, CMT $29,391 and ICT + RM $42,644. Compared with RT, CMT 
demonstrated minimal improvement in QALYs (+0.01) and an ICER well above the WTP 
threshold ($1,535,488). Compared with RT, ICT + RM demonstrated an improvement 
in QALYs (+0.41) with an ICER of $73,319. Modeling a 25% cost reduction with a 
rituximab biosimilar led to further ICER reductions with ICT + RM ($52,476). 
ICT + RM is cost-effective in early-stage FL from the Australian taxpayer 
perspective.

BACKGROUND: Early initiation of breast cancer screening is recommended for 
high-risk women, including survivors of childhood cancer treated with chest 
radiation. Recent studies suggest that female survivors of childhood leukemia or 
sarcoma treated without chest radiation are also at elevated early onset breast 
cancer risk. However, the potential clinical benefits and cost-effectiveness of 
early breast cancer screening among these women are uncertain.
METHODS: Using data from the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study, we adapted 2 
Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network simulation models to 
reflect the elevated risks of breast cancer and competing mortality among 
leukemia and sarcoma survivors. Costs and utility weights were based on 
published studies and databases. Outcomes included breast cancer deaths averted, 
false-positive screening results, benign biopsies, and incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios.
RESULTS: In the absence of screening, the lifetime risk of dying from breast 
cancer among survivors was 6.8% to 7.0% across models. Early initiation of 
annual mammography with breast magnetic resonance imaging screening between ages 
25 and 40 years would avert 52.6% to 64.3% of breast cancer deaths. When costs 
and quality-of-life impacts were considered, screening starting at age 40 years 
was the only strategy with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio below the 
$100 000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained cost-effectiveness 
threshold ($27 680 to $44 380 per QALY gained across models).
CONCLUSIONS: Among survivors of childhood leukemia or sarcoma, early initiation 
of breast cancer screening at age 40 years may reduce breast cancer deaths by 
half and is cost-effective. These findings could help inform screening 
guidelines for survivors treated without chest radiation.

The current work aims to prepare biologically active and pH responsive smart 
films based on Chitosan (CS)/Methylcellulose (MC) matrix integrated with 
Phyllanthus reticulatus (PR) ripen fruit anthocyanin. The prepared smart films 
(CMPR) were fabricated through a cost-effective solvent casting technique. The 
existences of secondary interactions were confirmed by the FT-IR analysis. The 
smooth SEM images revealed the miscibility and compatibility of the CS/MC matrix 
with PR anthocyanin. The incorporation of PR anthocyanin significantly blocked 
the UV light transmission of the CS/MC films while slight decrease in the 
transparency was observed. The water solubility, moisture retention capacity, 
and water vapor transmission rate were significantly enhanced with an increase 
in the PR anthocyanin content. Additionally, the prepared CMPR smart films 
showed pink color in acidic pH while yellowish in basic pH solution and further 
exhibited strong antioxidant activity as well as antibacterial activity against 
the common foodborne pathogens such as S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, and E. coli. 
The CMPR smart film also displayed potential result for monitoring the fish 
fillet freshness at room temperature. The results proclaim that the prepared 
CMPR smart films could be utilized for quality assurance as well as shelf life 
extension of the marine food products.

BACKGROUND: Bacterial viruses (bacteriophages or phages) have a lot of 
uncharacterized genes, which hinders the progress of their applied research. 
Functional characterization of these genes is often hampered by a lack of 
suitable methods for engineering of phage genomes.
METHODS: Phages vB_EcoM_Alf5 (Alf5) and VB_EcoM_VpaE1 (VpaE1) were used as the 
model phages of Felixounovirus genus. The phage-coded properties were predicted 
by bioinformatics analysis. The 'pull-down' assay was used for detection of 
protein-protein interactions. Primer extension analysis was used for the DNA 
polymerase (DNAP) activity testing. Bacteriophage lambda Redγβα-assisted 
homologous recombination was used for construction of phage mutants.
RESULTS: Bioinformatics analysis showed that felixounoviruses encode DNA 
polymerase, which is homologous to the T7 DNAP. We found that the Escherichia 
coli thioredoxin A (TrxA) in vitro interacts with the predicted DNAP of Alf5 
phage (gp096) and enhances its activity. Phages Alf5 and VpaE1 do not grow on E. 
coli strains lacking trxA gene unless it is provided in trans. This feature was 
used for construction of the deletion/insertion mutants of non-essential genes 
of felixounoviruses.
CONCLUSION: DNA replication of phages from Felixonuvirus genus depends on the 
host trxA, which therefore may be used as a molecular marker for their genome 
engineering.
GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: We present a proof-of-principle of a strategy for targeted 
engineering of bacteriophages of Felixounovirus genus. The method developed here 
will facilitate the basic and applied research of this unexplored phage group. 
Furthermore, detected functional interactions between the phage and host 
proteins will be significant for basic research of DNA replication.

OBJECTIVE: Mortality is increased in bipolar disorder due to both suicide and 
death by physical disorders, but it has never been investigated whether these 
mortalities translate into relatives to patients with bipolar disorder. The aim 
was to present the life expectancy and the overall mortality and mortality due 
to suicide and physical disorders among patients with bipolar disorder and their 
unaffected full siblings, respectively, compared with control individuals from 
the general population.
METHODS: We used Danish nation-wide population-based longitudinal register 
linkage to identify 19.955 patients with bipolar disorder, their 13.923 siblings 
and 20 sex, age and calendar matched control individuals from the general 
population. Follow-up was from 1995 to 2017.
RESULTS: Bipolar disorder was associated with a decreased life expectancy of 7.7 
(95% CI: 7.4-8.1) years and increased mortality overall (hazard ratio (HR): 2.11 
(95% CI: 2.04-2.18)) and due to suicide (HR: 18.23 (95% CI: 15.81-21.02) and 
physical disorders (HR: 2.01 (95% CI: 1.94-2.08). In contrast, siblings to 
patients with bipolar disorder who were unaffected by bipolar disorder did not 
have decreased life expectancy (0.45 (95% CI: -6.62-2.46)) or increased 
mortality overall (HR: 1.00 (95% CI: 0.88-1.14) or due to suicide (HR: 1.50 (95% 
CI: 0.95-2.36) or physical disorders (HR: 0.99 (95% CI: 0.87-1.34).
CONCLUSIONS: Increased mortality in bipolar disorder is mainly due to the impact 
of bipolar psychopathology and to a lesser degree to familial transmitted 
factors, highlighting the urgent need for preventive intervention studies in 
relation to suicide and physical disorders following onset of bipolar disorder.

Obesity contributes to reduced life expectancy because of its link with type 2 
diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Yet, targeting this poorly diagnosed, 
ill-defined, and underaddressed modifiable risk factor remains a challenge. In 
this review, we emphasize that the tendency among health care professionals to 
amalgam all forms of obesity altogether as a single entity may contribute to 
such difficulties and discrepancies. Obesity is a heterogeneous condition both 
in terms of causes and health consequences. Attention should be given to 2 
prevalent subgroups of individuals: 1) patients who are overweight or moderately 
obese with excess visceral adipose tissue; and 2) patients with severe obesity, 
the latter group having distinct additional health issues related to their large 
body fat mass. The challenge of tackling high-cardiovascular-risk forms of 
obesity through a combination of personalized clinical approaches and 
population-based solutions is compounded by the current obesogenic environment 
and economy.

With the aging population and increasing life expectancy, Parkinson's disease 
(PD), a neurological disorder rapidly increasing in morbidity and mortality, is 
causing a huge burden on society and the economy. Several studies have suggested 
that one-carbon metabolites, including homocysteine, vitamin B6, vitamin B12 and 
folate acid, are associated with PD risk. However, the results remain 
inconsistent and controversial. Thus, we performed a two-sample Mendelian 
randomization (MR) study to detect the causality between one-carbon metabolites 
and PD susceptibility as well as age at PD onset. We collected several genetic 
variants as instrumental variables from large genome-wide association studies of 
one-carbon metabolites (homocysteine: N = 14, vitamin B6: N = 1, vitamin B12: 
N = 10, folate acid: N = 2). We then conducted MR analyses using the inverse 
variance-weighted (IVW) approach and additional MR-Egger regression, weighted 
median and MR-pleiotropy residual sum and outlier (MR-PRESSO) methods to further 
test causality. The results showed no causal association between circulating 
homocysteine levels and PD risk (p = 0.868) or age at PD onset (p = 0.222) with 
the IVW method. Meanwhile, similar results were obtained by three complementary 
analyses. In addition, we did not observe any evidence that the circulating 
levels of vitamin B6, vitamin B12 and folate acid affected the risk of PD or age 
at onset of PD. Our findings implied that lowering homocysteine levels through 
vitamin B6, vitamin B12 or folate acid supplementation may not be clinically 
helpful in preventing PD or delaying the age at PD onset.

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a life-shortening monogenic disease caused by mutations 
in the gene encoding the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein, 
an anion channel that transports chloride and bicarbonate across epithelia. 
Despite clinical progress in delaying disease progression with symptomatic 
therapies, these individuals still develop various chronic complications in 
lungs and other organs, which significantly restricts their life expectancy and 
quality of life. The development of high-throughput assays to screen drug-like 
compound libraries have enabled the discovery of highly effective CFTR modulator 
therapies. These novel therapies target the primary defect underlying CF and are 
now approved for clinical use for individuals with specific CF genotypes. 
However, the clinically approved modulators only partially reverse CFTR 
dysfunction and there is still a considerable number of individuals with CF 
carrying rare CFTR mutations who remain without any effective CFTR modulator 
therapy. Accordingly, additional efforts have been pursued to identify novel and 
more potent CFTR modulators that may benefit a larger CF population. The use of 
ex vivo individual-derived specimens has also become a powerful tool to evaluate 
novel drugs and predict their effectiveness in a personalized medicine approach. 
In addition to CFTR modulators, pro-drugs aiming at modulating alternative ion 
channels/transporters are under development to compensate for the lack of CFTR 
function. These therapies may restore normal mucociliary clearance through a 
mutation-agnostic approach (ie, independent of CFTR mutation) and include 
inhibitors of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC), modulators of the 
calcium-activated channel transmembrane 16A (TMEM16, or anoctamin 1) or of the 
solute carrier family 26A member 9 (SLC26A9), and anionophores. The present 
review focuses on recent progress and challenges for the development of ion 
channel/transporter-modulating drugs for the treatment of CF.

Blood-injection-injury (BII) phobia can lead to avoidance of crucial medical 
procedures and to detrimental health consequences, even among health workers. 
Yet unlike other specific phobias, BII phobia has been understudied. 
Specifically, while cognitive biases have been extensively investigated in other 
anxiety disorders, little is known about the same biases in BII phobia. The 
current article reviews cognitive biases in BII phobia and suggest future 
directions for further study and treatment. The reviewed biases include 
attention, expectancy, memory, perception, and interpretation biases. The 
investigation of these biases is highly relevant, as cognitive biases have been 
found to interact with anxiety symptoms. Results showed that attention, 
expectancy, and memory biases are involved in BII phobia, while no studies were 
found on interpretation nor perception biases. Mixed results were found for 
attention bias, as different studies found different components of attention 
bias, while others found no attention bias at all. Similarly, some studies found 
a-priori/a-posteriori expectancy biases, while other studies found only one type 
of bias. A better understanding of the cognitive particularities of BII phobia 
may lead to better treatments and ultimately reduce avoidance of needles and 
blood-related situations, thereby enabling individuals with BII phobia to 
undergo potentially life-saving medical procedures.

A quarter of all cancer deaths are due to lung cancer. Studies show that early 
diagnosis and treatment of this disease are the most effective way to increase 
patient life expectancy. In this paper, automatic and optimized computer-aided 
detection is proposed for lung cancer. The method first applies a preprocessing 
step for normalizing and denoising the input images. Afterward, Kapur entropy 
maximization is performed along with mathematical morphology to lung area 
segmentation. Afterward, 19 GLCM features are extracted from the segmented 
images for the final evaluations. The higher priority images are then selected 
for decreasing the system complexity. The feature selection is based on a new 
optimization design, called Improved Thermal Exchange Optimization (ITEO), which 
is designed to improve the accuracy and convergence abilities. The images are 
finally classified into healthy or cancerous cases based on an optimized 
artificial neural network by ITEO. Simulation is compared with some well-known 
approaches and the results showed the superiority of the suggested method. The 
results showed that the proposed method with 92.27% accuracy provides the 
highest value among the compared methods.

BACKGROUND: Given the paucity of studies for low- or middle-income countries, we 
aim to provide the first ever estimations of lifetime risk of diabetes, years of 
life spent and lost among those with diabetes for Brazilians. Estimates of 
Brazil´s diabetes burden consist essentially of reports of diabetes prevalence 
from national surveys and mortality data. However, these additional metrics are 
at times more meaningful ways to characterize this burden.
METHODS: We joined data on incidence of physician-diagnosed diabetes from the 
Brazilian risk factor surveillance system, all-cause mortality from national 
statistics, and diabetes mortality rate ratios from ELSA-Brasil, an ongoing 
cohort study. To calculate lifetime risk of developing diabetes, we applied an 
illness-death state model. To calculate years of life lost for those with 
diabetes and years lived with the disease, we additionally calculated the 
mortality rates for those with diabetes.
RESULTS: A 35-year-old white adult had a 23.4% (95% CI = 22.5%-25.5%) lifetime 
risk of developing diabetes by age 80 while a same-aged black/brown adult had a 
30.8% risk (95% confidence interval (CI) = 29.6%-33.2%). Men diagnosed with 
diabetes at age 35 would live 32.9 (95% CI = 32.4-33.2) years with diabetes and 
lose 5.5 (95% CI = 5.1-6.1) years of life. Similarly-aged women would live 38.8 
(95% CI = 38.3-38.9) years with diabetes and lose 2.1 (95% CI = 1.9-2.6) years 
of life.
CONCLUSIONS: Assuming maintenance of current rates, one-quarter of young 
Brazilians will develop diabetes over their lifetimes, with this number reaching 
almost one-third among young, black/brown women. Those developing diabetes will 
suffer a decrease in life expectancy and will generate a considerable cost in 
terms of medical care.

INTRODUCTION: Aneurysmal bone cysts (ABC's) are expansile, tumour-like vascular 
lesion. They are more commonly seen in the metaphyseal region of long bones. 
They are benign lesion although malignant transformation has been reported. 
Usually presents in the first three decades of life. Common presentation is 
pain, swelling, or fracture. Proximal femur with ABC's is a rare entity and with 
physeal extension is even sparse.
CASE REPORT: A 13- year-. old female presented in the orthopaedic emergency with 
complaints of pain in the right hip region following a trivial fall. Following 
trauma, the patient was unable to stand or walk. On examination, there was 
tenderness in Scarpa's triangle, straight leg raise test was not possible and 
limb was in external rotation. Plain radiography revealed an inter-trochanteric 
fracture with cystic lesion in the proximal femur extending till until 
epiphysis. MRI of the proximal femur showed an air fluid level with septations 
and soft- tissue oedema suggestive of aneurysmal bone cyst ABC's.The patient was 
managed by intra-lesional curettage with fibular strut grafting along with 
cancellous bone graft and fixation by Uni-planar external fixator.
CONCLUSION: Pathological Fractures fractures of proximal femur management is are 
a challenge for an orthopaedic surgeon due to its location and biomechanical 
factors. Treatment of proximal femur ABC's should be case dependent. In our 
opinion, aneursymal bone cyst of the proximal femur with physeal extension can 
be managed by external fixation along with extensive curettage and bone graft.

York Medical College, Macy Pavilion, Room 141, 10595, Valhalla, NY, USA.

Hypertension is the leading modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular events and 
mortality in the world. Hypertension is a major risk factor for cardiovascular 
events and mortality in the elderly. The 2017 American College of 
Cardiology/American Heart Association hypertension guidelines recommend 
treatment of noninstitutionalized ambulatory community-dwelling persons aged 65 
years and older with an average systolic blood pressure of 130 ​mm Hg or higher 
or a diastolic blood pressure of 80 ​mm Hg or higher with lifestyle measures 
plus antihypertensive drug to lower the blood pressure to less than 130/80 ​mm 
Hg For elderly adults with hypertension and a high burden of comorbidities and 
limited life expectancy, clinical judgment, patient preference, and a team-based 
approach to assess risk/benefit is reasonable for decisions about the intensity 
of SBP lowering and the choice of antihypertensive drugs to use for treatment. 
Randomized clinical trials need to be performed in frail elderly patients with 
hypertension living in nursing homes. Elderly frail persons with prevalent and 
frequent falls, marked cognitive impairment, and multiple comorbidities 
requiring multiple antihypertensive drugs also need to be included in randomized 
clinical trials. Data on patients older than 85 years treated for hypertension 
are also sparse. These patients need clinical trial data. Finally, the effect of 
different antihypertensive drugs on clinical outcomes including serious adverse 
events needs to be investigated in elderly frail patients with hypertension and 
different comorbidities.

BACKGROUND: Stated preference research currently lacks a form of evidence that 
is well suited for small samples. A preference path is a sequence of two or more 
choices showing the evolution of an object following an adaptive process.
OBJECTIVES: The aims were to introduce preference paths and their kaizen tasks 
and to demonstrate how to analyze their evidence using a small sample.
METHODS: Twenty respondents were assigned the same 16 profiles generated from an 
orthogonal array based on the five attributes of the EQ-5D-5L descriptive 
system. Each kaizen task began with an opt-out paired comparison (i.e., choosing 
between the initial 10-year profile and the opt-out "dying immediately"), 
followed by choosing three changes, and ended with a second paired comparison 
(final profile versus opt-out) if the respondent chose opt-out initially. By 
maximum likelihood with respondent clusters, we estimated the 20 main effects 
using conditional logit and Zermelo-Bradley-Terry (ZBT) specifications.
RESULTS: Apart from demonstrating heterogeneity and profile effects, all main 
effect estimates were non-negative, and most were significant (15 for logit and 
all 20 for ZBT; p value < 0.05). Under the logit and ZBT specifications, the 
value of the worst EQ-5D-5L profile (55555) is - 0.920 quality-adjusted life 
years (QALYs) or - 1.478 QALYs, respectively. Furthermore, the findings 
illustrate a log-linear relationship between the logit and ZBT main effects.
CONCLUSION: This paper demonstrates the feasibility of a stated-preference study 
that estimates 20 main effects using path evidence from 20 respondents (16 
kaizen tasks, 15-min interviews). This approach shows promise for future 
application in stated-preference research, particularly in small samples.
