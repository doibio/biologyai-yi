The antiretroviral treatment (ART) developed to control HIV infection led to a 
revolution in the prognosis of people living with HIV (PLWH). PLWH underwent 
from suffering severe disease and often fatal complications at young ages to 
having a chronic condition and a life expectancy close to the general 
population. Nevertheless, chronic age-related diseases increase as PLWH age. The 
harmful effect of HIV infection on the individual's immune system adds to its 
deterioration during ageing, exacerbating comorbidities. In addition, PLWH are 
more exposed to risk factors affecting ageing, such as coinfections or harmful 
lifestyles. The ART initiation reverses the biological ageing process but only 
partially, and additionally can have some toxicities that influence ageing. 
Observational studies suggest premature ageing in PLWH. Therefore, there is 
considerable interest in the early prediction of unhealthy ageing through 
validated biomarkers, easy to implement in HIV-clinical settings. The most 
promising biomarkers are second-generation epigenetic clocks and integrative 
algorithms.

Although natural populations can rapidly adapt to selection pressures, the 
fitness consequences of selection are controversial. In this study, a selection 
experiment was conducted with replicate populations of Brachionus dorcas that 
were exposed to two sublethal concentrations (26.8 and 78.3 mg/L) of 
oxytetracycline (OTC), followed by two common garden experiments (population 
growth and life table experiments). During the 102-day (approximately 36 asexual 
generations) selection experiment, a markedly increased growth rate but a 
significantly decreased mictic ratio over time in the populations exposed to OTC 
when compared to the control populations suggested that the former adapted to 
the selection pressures and that a trade-off exists between asexual and sexual 
reproduction. The high and stable population growth rates after 90 days of OTC 
selection illustrate an example of evolutionary rescue. After 102 days of 
selection, OTC-selected populations showed higher population growth rates than 
the control populations when exposed to OTC, indicating significantly increased 
tolerance. OTC-selected populations showed a lower average growth rate, longer 
average generation time and life expectancy at hatching, and higher average net 
reproduction rate and proportion of mictic offspring than the control 
populations in the absence of OTC, which indicate that OTC selection results in 
two fitness costs and three fitness gains and that the effect of OTC selection 
on fitness differs with the measured fitness variables. Both the evolutionary 
potential of populations under the stress of higher concentrations of OTC and 
the fitness costs and gains of selection in the absence of OTC indicate that 
past exposures to pollutants cannot be neglected when evaluating the effects of 
current stressors on natural populations.

INTRODUCTION: The incidence of acute coronary syndrome is rising in step with 
the growth of life expectancy. An increase in the age of patients with coronary 
artery disease has been related to in-hospital mortality, which has seen an 
upsurge over a short period of time. However, there is no consensus about the 
percutaneous coronary angioplasty strategy to follow for older patients with 
multivessel coronary artery disease (MVCAD). Complete revascularisation (CR) or 
incomplete revascularisation (ICR) strategy depends on prognosis but this has 
not yet been accurately described because of geriatric conditions and 
comorbidities. The aim of this study is to evaluate changes of clinical and 
biochemical parameters in older patients with MVCAD undergoing revascularisation 
and to establish a prognostic stratification model for CR and ICR.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This observational, longitudinal, prospective study will 
include 150 patients with MVCAD and subsequent revascularisation who attend the 
Hospital Universitario Virgen de la Victoria (Málaga, Spain). Because of the 
dropout rates, 180 patients will be recruited at the beginning. Sociodemographic 
characteristics, clinical and angiographic parameters, and biochemical 
variables, such as cardiovascular, metabolic, inflammatory, stress oxidative 
biomarkers, will be collected in the admission for coronary revascularisation 
and three follow-ups at 6, 12 and 18 months. Statistical analyses will be 
conducted with these data using CR and ICR as the primary exposure variable. 
Relevant explanatory variables will be selected from a predictive model for 
their inclusion in a prognostic stratification model. The primary outcome 
measures will be major adverse cardiovascular events.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Protocols and patient information have been approved 
by the regional research ethics committee (CEIm Provincial de Málaga-PEIBA 
(PI0131/2020). The results will be disseminated in international peer-reviewed 
journals, presented at conferences in Cardiology and Gerontology, and sent to 
participants, medical and health service managers, clinicians and other 
researchers.

BACKGROUND: The association between a plant-based diet (vegetarianism) and 
extended life span is increasingly criticised since it may be based on the lack 
of representative data and insufficient removal of confounders such as 
lifestyles.
AIM: We examined the association between meat intake and life expectancy at a 
population level based on ecological data published by the United Nations 
agencies.
METHODS: Population-specific data were obtained from 175 countries/territories. 
Scatter plots, bivariate, partial correlation and linear regression models were 
used with SPSS 25 to explore and compare the correlations between newborn life 
expectancy (e(0)), life expectancy at 5 years of life (e(5)) and intakes of 
meat, and carbohydrate crops, respectively. The established risk factors to life 
expectancy - caloric intake, urbanization, obesity and education levels - were 
included as the potential confounders.
RESULTS: Worldwide, bivariate correlation analyses revealed that meat intake is 
positively correlated with life expectancies. This relationship remained 
significant when influences of caloric intake, urbanization, obesity, education 
and carbohydrate crops were statistically controlled. Stepwise linear regression 
selected meat intake, not carbohydrate crops, as one of the significant 
predictors of life expectancy. In contrast, carbohydrate crops showed weak and 
negative correlation with life expectancy.
CONCLUSION: If meat intake is not incorporated into nutrition science for 
predicting human life expectancy, results could prove inaccurate.

The development and pathogenicity of the fungus Magnaporthe oryzae, the causal 
agent of destructive rice blast disease, require it to perceive external 
environmental signals. Opy2, an overproduction-induced pheromone-resistant 
protein 2, is a crucial protein for sensing external signals in Saccharomyces 
cerevisiae. However, the biological functions of the homologue of Opy2 in M. 
oryzae are unclear. In this study, we identified that MoOPY2 is involved in 
fungal development, pathogenicity, and autophagy in M. oryzae. Deletion of 
MoOPY2 resulted in pleiotropic defects in hyphal growth, conidiation, germ tube 
extension, appressorium formation, appressorium turgor generation, and invasive 
growth, therefore leading to attenuated pathogenicity. Furthermore, MoOpy2 
participates in the Osm1 MAPK pathway and the Mps1 MAPK pathway by interacting 
with the adaptor protein Mst50. The interaction sites of Mst50 and MoOpy2 
colocalized with the autophagic marker protein MoAtg8 in the preautophagosomal 
structure sites (PAS). Notably, the ΔMoopy2 mutant caused cumulative MoAtg8 
lipidation and rapid GFP-MoAtg8 degradation in response to nitrogen starvation, 
showing that MoOpy2 is involved in the negative regulation of autophagy 
activity. Taken together, our study revealed that MoOpy2 of M. oryzae plays an 
essential role in the orchestration of fungal development, appressorium 
penetration, autophagy and pathogenesis.

Based on the static life table and survival curve, we explored the population 
structure and dynamics of Korean pine (Pinus koraiensis) seedlings regenerated 
from seeds in three different forest belts of Korean pine plantation in a 
montane region of eastern Liaoning Province. The results showed that the age 
structure of Korean pine seedlings in three different forest belts (i.e., larch 
forest belt, mixed coniferous forest belt, and mixed broadleaved forest belt) 
showed a "∩" type of left skewed distribution. The abundance of seedlings was 
rich but the mortality rate was high in the early phase, and the abundance of 
seedlings decreased in the later phase, which indicated that the population was 
depressing. The survival curve of the population conformed to the Deevey-Ⅱ type. 
The life expectancy of Korean pine seedlings at each age class in larch forest 
belt was higher than that in mixed coniferous forest belt and mixed broadleaved 
forest belt. The survival analysis showed that the survival rate of Korean pine 
seedlings in three different forest belts decreased but the cumulative mortality 
rate increased with increasing age. The death density function tended to be flat 
after the age class of Ⅱ-Ⅲ, while the risk function value showed a decreasing 
trend with the increases of age. The time series predictive analysis showed that 
the population showed a certain growth trend with increasing age class, 
indicating that the population could achieve natural regeneration and have a 
certain growth potential, but with regeneration obstacles.

OBJECTIVES: Increased risks of central nervous system (CNS) tumors and leukemia 
associated with computed tomography (CT) exposure during childhood have been 
reported in recent epidemiological studies. However, no evidence of increased 
risks was suggested in a previous analysis of the French CT cohort. This study 
benefits from an updated cohort with a longer follow-up and a larger sample size 
of patients.
METHODS: The patients were followed from the date of their first CT (between 
2000 and 2011) until their date of cohort exit defined as the earliest among the 
following: 31 December 2016, date of death, date of first cancer diagnosis or 
date of their 18th birthday. Cancer incidence, vital status, cancer predisposing 
factors (PFs), and additional CT scans were collected via external national 
databases. Hazard ratios (HRs) associated to cumulative organ doses and sex were 
estimated from Cox models.
RESULTS: At the end of follow-up, mean cumulative doses were 27.7 and 10.3 mGy 
for the brain and the red bone marrow (RBM), respectively. In patients without 
PFs, an HR per 10 mGy of 1.05 (95% CI: 1.01-1.09) for CNS tumors, 1.17 (95% CI: 
1.09-1.26) for leukemia, and 0.96 (95% CI: 0.63-1.45) for lymphoma was 
estimated. These estimates were not modified by the inclusion of CT scans 
performed outside the participating hospitals or after the inclusion period.
CONCLUSIONS: This study shows statistically significant dose-response 
relationships for CNS tumors and leukemia for patients without PFs.
KEY POINTS: • Computed tomography is the most important contributor to the 
collective dose for diagnostic imaging to the French population. • Concerns have 
been raised about possible cancer risks, particularly after exposure to CT in 
childhood, due to the greater radiation sensitivity of children and to their 
longer life expectancy. • Analysis of the updated French CT cohort shows 
statistically significant dose-response relationships for CNS tumors and 
leukemia.

PURPOSE: Pancreatic cystic neoplasms (PCN) management consists of non-invasive 
imaging studies (CT, MRI), with a high resource burden. We aimed to determine 
the cost-effectiveness of including contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) in the 
management of PCN without risk features.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: By using a decision-tree model in a hypothetical cohort 
of patients, we compared management strategy including CEUS with the latest 
Fukuoka consensus, European and Italian guidelines. Our strategy for 
BD-IPMN/MCN < 1 cm includes 1 CEUS annually. For those between 1 and 2 cm, it 
includes CEUS 4 times/year during the first year, then 3 times/year for 4 years 
and then annually. For those between 2 and 3 cm, it comprises MRI twice/year 
during the first one, then alternating 2 CEUS and 1 MRI yearly.
RESULTS: CEUS surveillance is the dominant strategy in all scenarios. CEUS 
surveillance average cost is 1,984.72 €, mean QALY 11.79 and mean ICER 181.99 €. 
If willingness to pay is 30,000 €, 45% of patients undergone CEUS surveillance 
of BDIPMN/MCN < 1 cm would be within budget.
CONCLUSION: Guidelines strategies are very effective, but costs are relatively 
high from a policy perspective. CEUS surveillance may be a cost-effective 
strategy yielding a nearly high QALYs, an acceptable ICER, and a lower cost.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Intensive psychotherapy assisted with 
3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA-AT) was shown in Phase 3 clinical trials 
to substantially reduce post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms compared 
to psychotherapy with placebo. This study estimates potential costs, health 
benefits, and net savings of expanding access to MDMA-AT to eligible US patients 
with chronic and severe PTSD.
METHODS: Using a decision-analytic model, we compared the costs, deaths averted, 
and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained of three, 10-year MDMA-AT 
coverage targets (25%, 50%, and 75%) compared to providing standard of care to 
the same number of eligible patients with chronic and severe PTSD. We used a 
payer perspective and discounted costs (in US$) and QALYs to 2020. We conducted 
one-way, scenario, and probabilistic sensitivity analyses and calculated the net 
monetary value of MDMA-AT using a cost-effectiveness threshold of $100,000 per 
QALY gained.
RESULTS: Expanding access to MDMA-AT to 25-75% of eligible patients is projected 
to avert 43,618-106,932 deaths and gain 3.3-8.2 million QALYs. All three 
treatment targets are dominant or cost-saving compared to standard of care. Our 
sensitivity analyses found that accounting for parameter uncertainty and changes 
in various assumptions did not alter the main finding-MDMA-AT is dominant 
compared to standard of care.
CONCLUSION: Expanding access to MDMA-AT to patients with chronic and severe PTSD 
will provide substantial health and financial benefits. The precise magnitude is 
uncertain and will depend on the number of eligible patients and other inputs.

RNase E-mediated RNA processing and degradation are involved in bacterial 
adaptation to environmental changes. The RraA regulatory protein, which is 
highly conserved in γ-proteobacteria, differentially modulates RNase E activity. 
Recent studies have revealed the association of Salmonella enterica serovar 
Typhimurium RNase E (STRNase E) with bacterial pathogenicity; however, the 
molecular mechanisms are unknown. Here, we show that the expression levels of 
STRraA, a protein regulator of STRNase E activity, affect S. Typhimurium 
pathogenicity. RNA-sequencing and RT-PCR analyses indicated positive effects of 
STRraA levels on the abundance of mRNA species from class II flagellar operons. 
Primer extension analysis further identified STRraA-regulated STRNase E cleavage 
in the 5' untranslated region of fliDST mRNA. The cleavage affected the 
stability of this polycistronic mRNA, suggesting that STRraA protects fliDST 
mRNA from STRNase E cleavage, leading to enhanced flagellar assembly. 
Accordingly, STRraA positively regulated flagellar assembly and motility. In 
addition, STrraA-deleted cells showed decreased invasion ability and 
cytotoxicity in infection of human cervical epithelial carcinoma cells and 
reduced mortality in a mouse infection model compared to wild-type cells. These 
results support an active role of STRraA in RNase E-mediated modulation of 
pathogenesis in S. Typhimurium.

Aiming at the problems of individual differences in the asynchrony process of 
human lower limbs and random changes in stride during walking, this paper 
proposes a method for gait recognition and prediction using motion posture 
signals. The research adopts an optimized gated recurrent unit (GRU) network 
algorithm based on immune particle swarm optimization (IPSO) to establish a 
network model that takes human body posture change data as the input, and the 
posture change data and accuracy of the next stage as the output, to realize the 
prediction of human body posture changes. This paper first clearly outlines the 
process of IPSO's optimization of the GRU algorithm. It collects human body 
posture change data of multiple subjects performing flat-land walking, 
squatting, and sitting leg flexion and extension movements. Then, through 
comparative analysis of IPSO optimized recurrent neural network (RNN), long 
short-term memory (LSTM) network, GRU network classification and prediction, the 
effectiveness of the built model is verified. The test results show that the 
optimized algorithm can better predict the changes in human posture. Among them, 
the root mean square error (RMSE) of flat-land walking and squatting can reach 
the accuracy of 10 -3, and the RMSE of sitting leg flexion and extension can 
reach the accuracy of 10 -2. The R 2 value of various actions can reach above 
0.966. The above research results show that the optimized algorithm can be 
applied to realize human gait movement evaluation and gait trend prediction in 
rehabilitation treatment, as well as in the design of artificial limbs and lower 
limb rehabilitation equipment, which provide a reference for future research to 
improve patients' limb function, activity level, and life independence ability.

Bioprosthetic aortic heart valves are known to degenerate within 7-15 years of 
implantation. Currently, the options for treating a failing valve are (a) redo 
surgical aortic valve replacement or, increasingly, (b) valve-in-valve 
transcatheter aortic valve implantation (ViV-TAVI). The ViV-TAVI procedure is 
referred to as redo-TAVI when the failing valve is a TAVI device. Repeated 
procedures, such as two or three valve-in-valves, significantly reduce the 
effective valve flow area, putting a limit on recurrent treatments. With 
increasing life expectancy and the use of TAVI in younger, lower-risk patients, 
the demand for multiple replacement procedures will inevitably increase. Against 
this background, we describe a novel valve system named exchangeable-TAVI 
(e-TAVI) in which an electromagnetic catheter is used to remove and retrieve a 
failed exchangeable valve, followed by the immediate deployment of a new valve. 
The e-TAVI system comprises (i) an exchangeable valve, (ii) a permanent holding 
member that anchors the exchangeable valve and (iii) a dedicated catheter with 
electromagnets for removal of the exchangeable valve. Simulations have been 
performed to determine the forces, frame design and electromagnetic parameters 
required to crimp and retrieve a 26 mm diameter valve. An optimum configuration 
was found to comprise a 12 cell self-expanding frame with circular ferromagnetic 
regions of 1 mm radius and 0.5 mm thickness, along with eight electromagnets of 
1 mm radius and 2 mm thickness. A force of 2.87 N and a current of 2.52 A per 
electromagnet were required to partially crimp the frame to an envelope radius 
of 11 mm. While this amount of force allowed the frame to be crimped solely 
through magnetic attraction, re-sheathing of the frame was not possible due to 
the weaker shear holding force of the magnets. Also, the current was close to 
the fusing current of the copper wire needed to fit sufficient windings into the 
available volume. These issues led to the conclusion that, in addition to the 
magnetic coupling, a mechanical mating between the removal catheter and the 
exchangeable valve is needed. This would decrease both the force that the 
electromagnets had to exert during crimping and the current required to generate 
this force.

Although no human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine is indicated for single-dose 
administration, some observational evidence suggests that a 1-dose regimen might 
reduce HPV infection risk to that achieved with 2 doses. This study estimated 
the potential health and economic outcomes associated with switching from a 
2-dose HPV vaccination program for girls and boys aged 13-14 years to an 
off-label 9-valent (9vHPV), 1-dose regimen, accounting for the uncertainty of 
the effectiveness and durability of a single dose. A dynamic HPV transmission 
infection and disease model was adapted to the United Kingdom and included a 
probabilistic sensitivity analysis using estimated distributions for duration of 
protection of 1-dose and degree of protection of 1 relative to 2 doses. One-way 
sensitivity analyses of key inputs were performed. Outcomes included additional 
cancer and disease cases and the difference in net monetary benefit (NMB). The 
1-dose program was predicted to result in 81,738 additional HPV-related cancer 
cases in males and females over 100 years compared to the 2-dose program, 
ranging from 36,673 to 134,347 additional cases (2.5% and 97.5% quantiles, 
respectively), and had a 7.8% probability of being cost-effective at the 
£20,000/quality-adjusted life years willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold. In 
one-way sensitivity analyses, the number of additional cancer cases was 
sensitive to the median of the duration of protection distribution and coverage 
rates. The differences in NMBs were sensitive to the median of the duration of 
protection distribution, dose price and discount rate, but not coverage 
variations. Across sensitivity analyses, the probability of 1 dose being 
cost-effective vs 2 doses was < 50% at the standard WTP threshold. Adoption of a 
1-dose 9vHPV vaccination program resulted in more vaccine-preventable 
HPV-related cancer and disease cases in males and females, introduced 
substantial uncertainty in health and economic outcomes, and had a low 
probability of being cost-effective compared to the 2-dose program.

OBJECTIVES: Evidence comparing utilities for adults and children consistently 
report higher utility values for child health states. This study investigates 
the reasons why child health states are valued differently.
METHODS: A total of 80 respondents (United Kingdom, Belgium, The Netherlands) 
participated in 1.5-hour face-to-face interviews. Respondents valued 4 health 
states from 2 perspectives (8-year-old child, 40-year-old adult) using visual 
analog scale and time trade-off. A total of 32 respondents participated in 
think-aloud interviews. Audio recordings were analyzed by 2 independent coders 
using NVIVO software. Statements, nodes, and themes were reviewed cyclically 
until consensus was reached.
RESULTS: Qualitative results: a total of 5 themes were identified in the data 
regarding child and adult valuation-intergenerational responsibility and 
dependency (childhood is crucial for forming life skills based on new 
experiences; adulthood is an important time to take care of the family), staying 
alive is important (life is worth living even with impaired health-related 
quality of life (HRQoL), for children and adults), awareness of poor HRQoL and 
ability to make decisions (children have difficulties comprehending poor HRQoL 
and their parents make their healthcare decision; adults can assess their own 
HRQoL and decide for themselves), coping ability (children are flexible and 
resilient; adults have experience with dealing with difficulties), and practical 
organization of care (children are cared for by their parents; adults are able 
to organize and pay for care). Mixed methods: comparing qualitative statements 
with respondents' higher utilities for child health states confirmed concordance 
between results.
CONCLUSIONS: Quality-adjusted life-years are interpreted differently for 
children and adults. Child-specific value sets are needed to reflect society's 
preferences and to adequately conduct health technology assessment of pediatric 
treatments.

Honing action competence in sustainable development: what happens in classrooms 
matters.

In effectiveness literature, voices are rising to embrace learning contents 
beyond mathematics, science, and language. Meanwhile, international policy 
documents such as the United Nations 2019 Climate Action Summit Report point at 
the importance of action for sustainable development for establishing acceptable 
life conditions for current and future generations. Therefore, a candidate 
learning outcome for broadening effectiveness research's scope is action 
competence in sustainable development (ACiSD), which consists of the relevant 
knowledge, willingness, capacity expectations, and outcome expectancy regarding 
actions for sustainable development. In order to initiate adding ACiSD as a 
learning outcome to effectiveness research, the current study contributed to 
establishing that formal education plays a part in changes in students' ACiSD. 
Firstly, we studied how much variance in ACiSD can be attributed to what happens 
in classrooms. Secondly, we looked into how class groups' and early adolescent 
students' ACiSD changed after one school year. Following recommendations for 
rigour in effectiveness research, we performed multilevel analyses on survey 
data (question one: n = 1398; question two: n = 633). Our evidence showed that 
11% of variance in ACiSD was attributable to what happens in classrooms with 
explained variance in the subconstructs ranging between 7.2 and 14.2%. 
Furthermore, individual students as well as class groups showed higher ACiSD 
scores when comparing measurements at beginning and end of one school year. We 
conclude that the classroom level matters to changes in ACiSD within early 
adolescents. Further research can now look into how and to which extent 
teachers' educational approaches affect these changes.

Vascular access failure causes significant morbidity among end stage renal 
failure patients. With the increased life expectancy and frailty of those 
patients, maintaining vascular access became a great challenge. In this study, 
we assess the short and midterm outcomes of infraclavicular arterio-arterial 
prosthetic loop (IAAPL) as vascular access for haemodialysis in frail patients 
who have exhausted conventional vascular access methods. A prospective 
observational study of 43 patients undergoing IAAPL was conducted in a single 
centre between May 2017 and March 2020. Primary, assisted primary and secondary 
patency rates were recorded in addition to complications and patient compliance 
with access. The achieved primary, assisted primary and secondary patency rates 
at 6 months are 87.5%, 95%, 97.5% respectively, at one year, corresponding rates 
were 75%, 83.3%, 94.4% and at 18 months they were 68.6%, 77.1%, 85.7% 
respectively. There was no procedure related mortality and life-threatening 
complications during the study period. So we can assume that infraclavicular 
AAPL is a safe and effective method of obtaining alternative vascular access for 
hemodialysis in frail patients for whom the conventional vascular access for 
hemodialysis is not suitable or contraindicated.

Foundation, New Taipei, Taiwan.

Marfan syndrome (MFS), a multisystemic connective disorder, caused by fibrillin 
1 gene mutations with autosomal dominant inheritance. The disease spectrum is 
wide and the major causes of death are related to aortic root aneurysm or 
dissection. The purposes of medical treatment are to reduce structural changes 
in the aortic wall and slow aortic root dilatation. Advance in medical 
researches have provided new insights into the pathogenesis of disease and 
opened up new horizons for treatments. Several medications such as angiotensin 
II type I receptor blockers, β-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme 
inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, tetracyclines, and statins have been 
studied for the purpose. Currently, the life expectancy of Marfan patients 
improves significantly and is closes to the general population with proper 
treatment. In this article, we review and update the medical treatments for 
patients with MFS.

Persistently Rising Alpha-fetoprotein in the Diagnosis of Hepatocellular 
Carcinoma: A Review.

Turshudzhyan A(1), Wu GY(1).

Author information:
(1)Department of Medicine, Division of Gastroenterology-Hepatology, University 
of Connecticut Health Center, Farmington, CT, USA.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), one of the most common malignant tumors 
worldwide, is known for its grim prognosis, with untreated life expectancy being 
only a matter of months after the diagnosis. The difficulty in making a 
diagnosis early is one of the main contributing factors to the poor prognosis. 
Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) had long been used as a surveillance tool, but 
suboptimal specificity and sensitivity has prompted liver societies to abandon 
the recommendation for its universal use, even in combination with 
ultrasonography. Most studies have shown no obvious correlation between serum 
AFP level and HCC tumor size, stage, or survival post-diagnosis. However, some 
studies concluded that a gradual rise or persistent elevation in AFP were 
positive predictors for tumor development. Other studies reported a fall in AFP 
followed by a rise in patients with HCC as well as persistently rising AFP 
levels without development of HCC on follow up. Our calculation of the 
sensitivity and specificity of persistently rising AFP for HCC were both low, at 
60% and 35.8%, respectively, indicating that the presence of persistently rising 
AFP per se did not offer diagnostic benefit. In addition, our calculated mean 
slopes of persistently rising AFP levels in HCC and non-HCC patients were 
numerically very different, but the difference was not statistically 
significant. We conclude that the published data do not support a role for 
rising AFP levels per se in the diagnosis of HCC.

BACKGROUND AND AIM: Marital satisfaction is a multidimensional phenomenon, which 
refers to the quality of marital relationship, or the general view of marriage 
status and reflection of happiness and marital performance. Repetition of 
certain positive behaviors can make a huge difference in the success of 
continued married life, and that awareness of such behaviors seems to be 
critical to recognizing certain warnings. Therefore, this study with qualitative 
approach conducted to promoting long-term marital satisfaction by exploring 
couple's experiences.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was conducted using descriptive phenomenology 
method. The participants were 12 person (six couples) with a history of 20-30 
years of married life expectancy and a marital satisfaction score of above 65. 
The data were collected by purposeful sampling and semi-structured interviews, 
analyzed using Colaizzi method. By categorizing the codes, subcategories, and 
main categories were extracted.
RESULTS: An analysis of the experiences of the participants resulted in 
emergence of eight subcategories, and three main categories: "Strong Foundation 
For Living Together," "Mutual Commitment To Protecting Marital Cohesion," and 
"Striving To Improve Sexual Relations."
CONCLUSIONS: A long-term marriage associated with a variety of variables, 
including a strong foundation for living together, a mutual commitment to 
protect marital cohesion, and an effort to improve sexuality. And the results 
showed that the type of relationship will change during the years after marriage 
in a way that takes on certain meanings and concepts and can be interpreted in 
physiological, cultural and other specific contexts.
