Temperature has a profound effect on performance and behavior of egg 
parasitoids. Egg parasitoids are a well-known alternative for the control of 
lepidopterous pests. Selected life history parameters of Trichogramma 
euproctidis (Girault) (Hymenoptera: Trichogrammatidae), an established egg 
parasitoid species in Khuzestan- Southwest Iran, were appraised at eight 
constant temperatures (22.5, 25, 27.5, 30, 32.5, 35, 37.5, and 40°C) using 
Ephestia kuehniella Zeller (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) eggs as the host. We found 
significant effects of temperature on the number of parasitized eggs, 
development time, sex ratio, progeny's longevity, and fecundity. T. euproctidis 
developed on E. kuehniella eggs at all temperatures tested, but performed best 
at 32.5°C. At this temperature, they parasitized the most eggs, produced the 
most female progeny, and had high rates of survival. Our findings revealed that 
temperature significantly affected the longevity of female progeny and fecundity 
of T. euproctidis. A life table analysis confirmed that temperature resulted in 
optimal effects on T. euproctidis life history. Net reproductive rate (R0) of T. 
euproctidis was different among the temperatures tested. The intrinsic rate of 
increase (r) was positively correlated with temperature from 22.5 to 32.5°C and 
then decreased from 35 to 40°C. Generation time (T) and doubling time (DT) 
decreased as temperature increased from 22.5 to 37.5°C and then increased at 
40°C. These data suggest that this strain of T. euproctidis is adapted to high 
temperatures and harsh environmental conditions and has the potential to be used 
in integrated management programs in Southwest Iran.

BACKGROUND: For low- and middle-income countries, the forecasted incremental 
value to society created by a class of new prescription drugs would be a useful 
criterion to prioritize the licensing, subsidization, and provision of new 
drugs.
OBJECTIVES: We provide a methodology to forecast the value of a new class of 
drugs, defined as the incremental value obtained in the scenario in which the 
new class of drugs is available along with existing drugs compared with the 
scenario of existing drugs only. We forecasted the value created by 
direct-acting antiviral drugs to treat chronic hepatitis C in India.
METHOD: We conducted a physician survey together with an aggregate multinomial 
logit model to forecast for each patient type the fraction of physicians who 
would prescribe the new drug under different scenarios. Value was determined by 
the monetary equivalent of increased life expectancy, reduced disability, and 
decreased future infection of others, minus drug cost, all treatment-related 
costs, and the cost of side effects.
RESULTS: We forecasted that the introduction of direct-acting antiviral drugs is 
likely to create USD11.5 billion of value in India over a 5-year period, based 
on a 'realistic' assumption about the growth rate of India's per capita GDP. 
Under 'pessimistic' and 'optimistic' assumptions about the growth rate, the 
value changes to USD6.5 and 22.5 billion, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: There is major value likely to be created by the new direct-acting 
antiviral drugs in treating hepatitis C in India; this is consistent with the 
Indian Government's decision to provide the drugs free of cost.

Sex and Gender Differences in Environmental Influences on Dementia Incidence in 
Germany, 2014-2019: An Observational Cohort Study Based on Health Claims Data.

BACKGROUND: There is an ongoing debate about whether environmental 
characteristics influence dementia risk like individual traits do, and whether 
these differ by sex and gender.
OBJECTIVE: This study examines the influence of regional characteristics on the 
incidence of dementia and explores sex and gender differences using 
individual-level health information and regional characteristics.
METHODS: Using a random sample of 250,000 people aged 70 + insured through 
Germany's largest German public health agency, we analyzed quarterly data about 
diagnoses and place of residence from 2014 to 2019. Using five-digit postal 
codes, we added data on various dimensions of regional characteristics offered 
by the INKAR database and the 2011 Census database. We used multilevel survival 
regressions to tease out regional incidence differences while accounting for 
spatial clustering.
RESULTS: After adjusting for multi-morbidity and relocation-related selection 
bias, we saw that people living in regions with the highest tertile of income 
(HR = 0.87, p < 0.001), and who had the highest tertile of remaining life 
expectancy at age 60 (HR = 0.93, p = 0.012) had lower dementia risks. There was 
no gender difference in the regional income effect, but the effect of education 
(HR = 0.91, p = 0.015) was significant only for men and remaining 
life-expectancy was significant only for women (HR = 0.93, p = 0.026).
CONCLUSION: Environmental characteristics related to wealth and health resources 
of a region influence the risk of dementia among the elderly in Germany. This 
effect is independent of the health profiles of the individuals and differs 
between the two genders. Health policies need to acknowledge these modifiable 
risk factors and consider how they affect men and women differently.

The short half-life in the GI tract necessitates an excess of drugs causing side 
effects of oral formulations. Here, we report the development and deployment of 
Bacterioboat, which consists of surface-encapsulated mesoporous nanoparticles on 
metabolically active Lactobacillus reuteri as a drug carrier suitable for oral 
administration. Bacterioboat showed up to 16% drug loading of its dry weight, 
intestinal anchorage around alveoli regions, sustained release, and stability in 
physiological conditions up to 24 hours. In vivo studies showed that oral 
delivery of 5-fluorouracil leads to increased potency, resulting in improved 
shrinkage of solid tumors, enhanced life expectancy, and reduced side effects. 
This novel design and development make this system ideal for orally 
administrable drugs with low solubility or permeability or both and even making 
them effective at a lower dose.

ANTECEDENTES: Las enfermedades cardiovasculares son la principal causa mundial 
de mortalidad y México no es la excepción. Los datos epidemiológicos obtenidos 
en 1990 mostraron que los padecimientos cardiovasculares representaron el 19.8% 
de todas las causas de muerte en nuestro país; esta cifra se incrementó de 
manera significativa a un 25.5% para 2015. Diversas encuestas nacionales 
sugieren que más del 60% de la población adulta tiene al menos un factor de 
riesgo para padecer enfermedades cardiovasculares (obesidad o sobrepeso, 
hipertensión, tabaquismo, diabetes, dislipidemias). Por otro lado, datos de la 
Organización Panamericana de la Salud han relacionado el proceso de 
aterosclerosis como la primer causa de muerte prematura, reduciendo la 
expectativa de vida de manera sensible, lo que tiene una enorme repercusión 
social.
OBJETIVO: Este documento constituye la guía de práctica clínica (GPC) elaborada 
por iniciativa de la Sociedad Mexicana de Cardiología en colaboración con la 
Sociedad Mexicana de Nutrición y Endocrinología, A.C., Asociación Nacional de 
Cardiólogos de México, A.C., Asociación Mexicana para la Prevención de la 
Aterosclerosis y sus Complicaciones, A.C., Comité Normativo Nacional de Medicina 
General, A.C., Colegio Nacional de Medicina Geriátrica, A.C., Colegio de 
Medicina Interna de México, A.C., Sociedad Mexicana de Angiología y Cirugía 
Vascular y Endovenosa, A.C., Instituto Mexicano de Investigaciones Nefrológicas, 
A.C. y la Academia Mexicana de Neurología, A.C.; con el apoyo metodológico de la 
Agencia Iberoamericana de Desarrollo y Evaluación de Tecnologías en Salud, con 
la finalidad de establecer recomendaciones basadas en la mejor evidencia 
disponible y consensuadas por un grupo interdisciplinario de expertos. El 
objetivo de este documento es el de brindar recomendaciones basadas en evidencia 
para ayudar a los tomadores de decisión en el diagnóstico y tratamiento de las 
dislipidemias en nuestro país.
MATERIAL Y MÉTODOS: Este documento cumple con estándares internacionales de 
calidad, como los descritos por el Instituto de Medicina de EE.UU., el Instituto 
de Excelencia Clínica de Gran Bretaña, la Red Colegiada para el Desarrollo de 
Guías de Escocia y la Red Internacional de Guías de Práctica Clínica. Se integró 
un grupo multidisciplinario de expertos clínicos y metodólogos con experiencia 
en revisiones sistemáticas de la literatura y el desarrollo de guías de práctica 
clínica. Se consensuó un documento de alcances, se establecieron las preguntas 
clínicas relevantes, se identificó de manera exhaustiva la mejor evidencia 
disponible evaluada críticamente en revisiones sistemáticas de la literatura y 
se desarrollaron las recomendaciones clínicas. Se utilizó la metodología de 
Panel Delphi modificado para lograr un nivel de consenso adecuado en cada una de 
las recomendaciones contenidas en esta GPC.
RESULTADOS: Se consensuaron 23 preguntas clínicas que dieron origen a sus 
respectivas recomendaciones clínicas.
CONCLUSIONES: Esperamos que este documento contribuya a la mejor toma de 
decisiones clínicas y se convierta en un punto de referencia para los clínicos y 
pacientes en el manejo de las dislipidemias y esto contribuya a disminuir la 
morbilidad y mortalidad derivada de los eventos cardiovasculares 
ateroscleróticos en nuestro país.
BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of mortality worldwide 
and Mexico is no exception. The epidemiological data obtained in 1990 showed 
that cardiovascular diseases represented 19.8% of all causes of death in our 
country. This figure increased significantly to 25.5% for 2015. Some national 
surveys suggest that more than 60% of the adult population has at least one risk 
factor for cardiovascular disease (obesity or overweight, hypertension, smoking, 
diabetes, dyslipidemias). On the other hand, data from the Pan American Health 
Organization have linked the process of atherosclerosis as the first cause of 
premature death, significantly reducing life expectancy, which has enormous 
social repercussions.
OBJECTIVE: This document constitutes the Clinical Practice Guide (CPG) prepared 
at the initiative of the Mexican Society of Cardiology in collaboration with the 
Mexican Society of Nutrition and Endocrinology, AC, National Association of 
Cardiologists of Mexico, AC, Mexican Association for the Prevention of 
Atherosclerosis and its Complications, AC, National Normative Committee of 
General Medicine, AC, National College of Geriatric Medicine, AC, College of 
Internal Medicine of Mexico, AC, Mexican Society of Angiology and Vascular and 
Endovenous Surgery, AC, Mexican Institute of Research Nephrological, AC and the 
Mexican Academy of Neurology, A.C.; with the methodological support of the 
Ibero-American Agency for the Development and Evaluation of Health Technologies, 
in order to establish recommendations based on the best available evidence and 
agreed upon by an interdisciplinary group of experts. The objective of this 
document is to provide evidence-based recommendations to help decision makers in 
the diagnosis and treatment of dyslipidemias in our country.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: This document complies with international quality 
standards, such as those described by the Institute of Medicine of the USA, the 
Institute of Clinical Excellence of Great Britain, the Scottish Intercollegiate 
Guideline Network and the Guidelines International Network. A multidisciplinary 
group of clinical experts and methodologists with experience in systematic 
reviews of the literature and the development of clinical practice guidelines 
was formed. A scope document was agreed upon, relevant clinical questions were 
established, the best available evidence critically evaluated in systematic 
literature reviews was exhaustively identified, and clinical recommendations 
were developed. The modified Delphi Panel methodology was used to achieve an 
adequate level of consensus in each of the recommendations contained in this 
CPG.
RESULTS: 23 clinical questions were agreed upon which gave rise to their 
respective clinical recommendations.
CONCLUSIONS: We consider that this document contributes to better clinical 
decision-making and becomes a point of reference for clinicians and patients in 
the management of dyslipidemias and this contributes to reducing the morbidity 
and mortality derived from atherosclerotic cardiovascular events in our country.

We examine changes in the level of physical health using longitudinal data on 
people aged 50+ from nine European countries covering the years from 2004 to 
2017. For this purpose we develop a novel approach to identify age, period and 
cohort effects, which, in contrast to methods relying on mechanical 
restrictions, uses a step-wise estimation combining information on physical 
health with data on cognitive abilities. The approach relies on two important 
assumptions. First, we estimate relative differences between cohorts in 
cognitive abilities assuming that only age and cohort effects are responsible 
for their evolution. We then use the estimated proportional cohort differences 
to restrict the differences between cohorts in health development. The method is 
applied to the dynamics of four measures of poor health: weak grip strength, 
limitations in mobility, in activities of daily living (ADL) and in instrumental 
activities of daily living (IADL). Our results suggest insignificant or adverse 
period effects for the evolution of physical health. For example, the difference 
in likelihood of poor health as measured through weak grip strength between 2004 
and 2017 is 2.1 percentage points, p.p., (95% CI -4.3, 8.4), and the 
corresponding numbers for the other three measures are respectively: 2.0 p.p. 
(CI -1.6, 5.6); 2.2 p.p. (CI -0.2, 4.7) and 3.0 p.p. (CI 0.3, 5.8). These 
estimates, which reflect the implications of time over the period of 14 years, 
are relatively low, but they highlight the surprising fact that any improvements 
in health in the examined period have been driven essentially by cohort effects. 
Our evidence is consistent with some earlier studies and sheds new light on 
recent (pre-pandemic) trends in life expectancy. It also raises questions 
concerning efficacy of healthcare and equal access to high quality care - the 
factors one would consider as important determinants of period effects in 
health.

Objectives Although the health consequences of depression have been extensively 
examined, little attention has been given to its nonfatal conditions. This study 
aims to investigate the association of depressive symptoms with total life 
expectancy (TLE), disability-free life expectancy (DFLE) and self-assessed 
healthy life expectancy (SHLE). Methods Data were sourced from the China Health 
and Retirement Longitudinal Study 2011-2013. The 10-item Center for 
Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D-10) short form was used to measure 
depressive symptoms in 14,982 Chinese middle-aged and older adults. The 
population-based multistate life table method was used to estimate the 
differences in TLE, DFLE and SHLE by the status of depressive symptoms. Results 
At the age of 45 years, depressive symptoms were associated with a reduction of 
1.8 (95% CI: 0.4-3.2) additional years of TLE. The estimated depression-induced 
reduction in TLE was 1.8 (95% CI: 0.1-3.5) in females, and 2.6 (95% CI: 1.0-4.2) 
in males. For DFLE, a reduction of 3.1 (95% CI: 2.0-4.2) additional years was 
found in individuals with depressive symptoms. The proportion of DFLE in TLE in 
participants with depressive symptoms decreased compared with that of the 
non-depressive symptoms group (depressive symptoms: 87.4% vs non-depressive 
symptoms: 91.4%). For SHLE, on average, individuals with depressive symptoms 
suffered a reduction of 7.6 (95% CI: 6.5-8.7) additional years in their SHLE at 
45 years old and a reduction in the proportion of SHLE in TLE by 17.7%. Similar 
patterns were found in groups aged 55, 65, 75 and 85 years. Conclusion This 
study showed that depressive symptoms were associated with reductions in TLE, 
DFLE and SHLE among middle-aged and older adults in China, and the 
depression-induced reduction in proportions of DFLE and SHLE in TLE continued to 
increase as age increased. This study provides new insight into the nonfatal 
health consequences of depressive symptoms and their adverse effects on quantity 
and quality of life. Our findings are useful for policy makers and individuals 
in mental health management, depression prevention and intervention and 
informing health policies.

OBJECTIVES: Population aging - which tends to be more pronounced in rural than 
in urban areas - poses important challenges for facilitating equal opportunities 
for aging well and 'aging in place.' Unmet health care needs among the older 
rural population may result in poorer health and higher mortality, but the 
scientific evidence of a systematic rural mortality disadvantage at older ages 
is scarce. We argue that systematic urban-rural mortality differences by age may 
be found if the confounding effect of life expectancy is considered.
STUDY DESIGN: Nationwide population-based study.
METHODS: We draw on age- and sex-specific data for the population aged 60+ years 
in NUTS-3 regions in Germany (2016-2018) and LAU-1 regions in England & Wales 
(2017-2019). To account for the confounding effect of life expectancy, we 
compare age-specific mortality only across urban and rural regions with similar 
life expectancy levels. We quantify statistical uncertainty with bootstrapping.
RESULTS: The results show a remarkable shift from higher mortality in urban 
regions to higher mortality in rural regions with increasing age, when 
controlling for the confounding effect of life expectancy. That is, the urban 
mortality disadvantage is strongest for the population aged 60-79 years, whereas 
the pattern shifts toward a rural mortality disadvantage for the population aged 
80 years and older. This pattern is present at all levels of life expectancy, 
for both sexes and in both countries.
CONCLUSION: The shift from urban to rural excess mortality over age suggests 
that regions may vary in their capability to respond to arising health issues 
across older ages. This systematic mortality disadvantage is of high public 
health relevance and should be considered in designing policies to reduce 
regional mortality disparities.

Lung cancer screening with low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) in high-risk 
populations has been shown in randomised controlled trials to lead to early 
diagnosis and reduced lung cancer mortality. However, investment into screening 
will largely depend on the outcomes of cost-effectiveness analyses that 
demonstrate acceptable costs for every quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. 
The methods used to apply utility values to measure QALYs can significantly 
impact the outcomes of cost-effectiveness analyses and if applied inaccurately 
can lead to unreliable estimates. We reviewed the use of utility values in 26 
cost-effectiveness analyses of lung screening with LDCT conducted between 2005 
and 2021, and found considerable variation in methods. Specifically, authors 
made different assumptions made relating to (i) baseline quality-of-life among 
screening participants, (ii) potential harms from screening, (iii) utilities and 
disutilities applied to lung cancer health states, and (iv) quality-of-life for 
lung cancer survivors. We discuss how each of these assumptions can influence 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. Key recommendations for future 
evaluations are (i) that modelling studies should justify the choice of baseline 
utilities, especially if patients are assumed to recover fully after curative 
treatment; (ii) the impact of false positive scans on quality-of-life should be 
modelled, at least in sensitivity analyses; (iii) modellers should justify 
assumptions relating to post-operative recovery, preferably based on knowledge 
of local practices; (iv) utilities applied to a lung cancer diagnosis should be 
appropriately sourced and calculated; and (v) adjustment for age-related 
declines in quality-of-life should be considered, especially for models that 
examine lifetime horizons.

OBJECTIVE: Cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM) is a common progressive spine 
disorder affecting predominantly middle-aged and elderly populations. With 
increasing life expectancy, the incidence of CSM is expected to rise further. 
The outcomes of elderly patients undergoing CSM surgery and especially their 
quality of life (QOL) postoperatively remain undetermined. This study 
retrospectively reviewed patients to identify baseline differences and validated 
postoperative patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures in elderly patients 
undergoing CSM surgery.
METHODS: The multi-institutional, neurosurgery-specific NeuroPoint Quality 
Outcomes Database was queried to identify CSM patients treated surgically at the 
14 highest-volume sites from January 2016 to December 2018. Patients were 
divided into three groups: young (< 65 years), early elderly (65-74 years), and 
late elderly (≥ 75 years). Demographic and PRO measures (Neck Disability Index 
[NDI] score, modified Japanese Orthopaedic Association [mJOA] score, EQ-5D 
score, EQ-5D visual analog scale [VAS] score, arm pain VAS, and neck pain VAS) 
were compared among the groups at baseline and 3 and 12 months postoperatively.
RESULTS: A total of 1151 patients were identified: 691 patients (60%) in the 
young, 331 patients (28.7%) in the early elderly, and 129 patients (11.2%) in 
the late elderly groups. At baseline, younger patients presented with worse NDI 
scores (p < 0.001) and lower EQ-5D VAS (p = 0.004) and EQ-5D (p < 0.001) scores 
compared with early and late elderly patients. No differences among age groups 
were found in the mJOA score. An improvement of all QOL scores was noted in all 
age groups. On unadjusted analysis at 3 months, younger patients had greater 
improvement in arm pain VAS, NDI, and EQ-5D VAS compared with early and late 
elderly patients. At 12 months, the same changes were seen, but on adjusted 
analysis, there were no differences in PROs between the age groups.
CONCLUSIONS: The authors' results indicate that elderly patients undergoing CSM 
surgery achieved QOL outcomes that were equivalent to those of younger patients 
at the 12-month follow-up.

With extended life expectancy, the older population is constantly increasing, 
and consequently, so too is the prevalence of age-related disorders. Sarcopenia, 
the pathological age-related loss of muscle mass and function; and malnutrition, 
the imbalance in nutrient intake and resultant energy production, are both 
commonly occurring conditions in old adults. Altered nutrition plays a crucial 
role in the onset of sarcopenia, and both these disorders are associated with 
detrimental consequences for patients (e.g., frailty, morbidity, and mortality) 
and society (e.g., healthcare costs). Importantly, sarcopenia and malnutrition 
also share critical molecular alterations, such as mitochondrial dysfunction, 
increased oxidative stress, and a chronic state of low grade and sterile 
inflammation, defined as inflammageing. Given the connection between 
malnutrition and sarcopenia, nutritional interventions capable of affecting 
mitochondrial health and correcting inflammageing are emerging as possible 
strategies to target sarcopenia. Here, we discuss mitochondrial dysfunction, 
oxidative stress, and inflammageing as key features leading to sarcopenia. 
Moreover, we examine the effects of some branched amino acids, omega-3 PUFA, and 
selected micronutrients on these pathways, and their potential role in 
modulating sarcopenia, warranting further clinical investigation.

Osteoporosis is considered an age-related disorder of the skeletal system, 
characterized primarily by decreased bone mineral density (BMD), microstructural 
quality and an elevated risk of fragility fractures. This silent disease is 
increasingly becoming a global epidemic due to an aging population and longer 
life expectancy. It is known that nutrition and physical activity play an 
important role in skeletal health, both in achieving the highest BMD and in 
maintaining bone health. In this review, the role of macronutrients (proteins, 
lipids, carbohydrates), micronutrients (minerals-calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, 
as well as vitamins-D, C, K) and flavonoid polyphenols (quercetin, rutin, 
luteolin, kaempferol, naringin) which appear to be essential for the prevention 
and treatment of osteoporosis, are characterized. Moreover, the importance of 
various naturally available nutrients, whether in the diet or in food 
supplements, is emphasized. In addition to pharmacotherapy, the basis of 
osteoporosis prevention is a healthy diet rich mainly in fruits, vegetables, 
seafood and fish oil supplements, specific dairy products, containing a 
sufficient amount of all aforementioned nutritional substances along with 
regular physical activity. The effect of diet alone in this context may depend 
on an individual's genotype, gene-diet interactions or the composition and 
function of the gut microbiota.

Despite the increasing life expectancy, an individual's later years tends to be 
accompanied by a decrease in the quality of life. Though biological changes that 
occur through the natural process of aging cannot be controlled, the risk 
factors associated with lifestyle can. Thus, the main goal of this systematic 
review was to evaluate how nutrition can modulate aging. For this purpose, 
thirty-six studies were selected on (i) the efficiency of nutrition's effect on 
aging, (ii) the evaluation of biomarkers that promote healthy aging, and (iii) 
how to increase longevity through nutrition, and their quality was assessed. The 
results showed that choosing low carbohydrate diets or diets rich in vegetables, 
fruits, nuts, cereals, fish, and unsaturated fats, containing antioxidants, 
potassium, and omega-3 decreased cardiovascular diseases and obesity risk, 
protected the brain from aging, reduced the risk of telomere shortening, and 
promoted an overall healthier life. With this study, the conclusion is that 
since the biological processes of aging cannot be controlled, changing one's 
nutritional patterns is crucial to prevent the emergence and development of 
diseases, boost longevity, and, mostly, to enhance one's quality of life and 
promote healthy aging.

PURPOSE: Rheumatoid arthritis, a chronic and progressive inflammation condition 
in the joints, has significantly reduced the patient quality of life and life 
expectancy. Crucially, there is no complete therapy for this disease, and the 
current treatments possess numerous side effects. Thus, novel therapeutic 
approach is necessary. To that end, this study developed novel silk fibroin 
in-situ hydrogel containing Sesbania sesban L. extract, a plant with high 
anti-inflammatory actions that are beneficial for rheumatoid arthritis 
treatments.
METHODS: The hydrogels were manufactured using simple method of spontaneous 
gelation at different temperature. The gel properties of morphology, gelation 
time, viscosity, gel strength, stability, drug loading capacity, drug release 
rate, and in-vitro anti-inflammatory activity were investigated with appropriate 
methods.
RESULTS: The optimal formulation had highly porous structure, with a gelation 
time of 0.5 h at room temperature and bodily temperature of 37 °C, a viscosity 
of 2530 ± 50 cP, a gel strength of 1880.14 ± 35.10 g, and a physical stability 
of >6 months. Moreover, the hydrogel contained the Sesbania sesban L. leaf 
extract with a total phenolic content of 92.8 ± 8.30 mg GAE/g, and sustained the 
release rate for >20 dạys, followed the Higuchi model. Regarding the in-vitro 
activities, all formulations were nontoxic to the RAW 264.7 cell line and 
demonstrated comparable anti-inflammatory activity to the free extract, in terms 
of the NO reduction levels.
CONCLUSION: Conclusively, the systems possessed potential properties to be 
further investigated to become a prospective rheumatoid arthritis treatment.

OBJECTIVES: Existing measures for estimating quality-adjusted life-years are 
mostly limited to health-related quality of life. This article presents an 
overview of the development the EQ-HWB (EQ Health and Wellbeing), which is a 
measure that encompasses health and wellbeing.
METHODS: Stages: (1) Establishing domains through reviews of the qualitative 
literature informed by a conceptual framework. (2) Generation and selection of 
items to cover the domains. (3) Face validation of these items through 
qualitative interviews with 168 patients, social care users, general population, 
and carers across 6 countries (Argentina, Australia, China, Germany, United 
Kingdom, United States). (4) Extensive psychometric testing of candidate items 
(using classical, factor analysis, and item response theory methods) on > 4000 
respondents in the 6 countries. Stakeholders were consulted throughout.
RESULTS: A total of 32 subdomains grouped into 7 high-level domains were 
identified from the qualitative literature and 97 items generated to cover them. 
Face validation eliminated 36 items, modified 14, and added 3. Psychometric 
testing of 64 items found little difference in missing data or problems with 
response distribution, the conceptual model was confirmed except in China, and 
most items performed well in the item response theory in all countries. Evidence 
was presented to stakeholders in 2 rounds of consultation to inform the final 
selection of items for the EQ-HWB (25-item) and the short version of EQ-HWB 
(9-items).
CONCLUSIONS: EQ-HWB measures have been developed internationally for evaluating 
interventions in health, public health, and social care including the impact on 
patients, social care users, and carers.

PURPOSE: With the global increase in life expectancy and the subsequent impaired 
quality of life in older obese adults, modalities such as bariatric surgery 
become crucial to help lose excess weight. This study was conducted to evaluate 
the effectiveness and safety of one anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB) in 
patients 65 years old and above.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective cohort study was conducted on 61 
patients with severe obesity aged ≥ 65 years through Iran National Obesity 
Surgery Database. The patients had undergone OAGB and were followed up for 12 to 
60 months. The required data was extracted through national database.
RESULTS: Mean age and BMI of the patients were 67.62 ± 2.03 years and 
46.42 ± 5.46 kg/m2, respectively. Regarding gender, 90.1% of the participants 
were female. Mean operative time and length of hospital stay were 
41.37 ± 13.91 min and 1.16 ± 0.61 days, respectively. Five patients (8.19%) 
required ICU admission. The changes in %TWL after 3, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, and 
60 month follow-up was 18.62%, 25.51%, 32.84%, 35.86%, 38.49%, 31.41%, and 
29.52%, respectively. The resolution of gastroesophageal reflux disease, 
diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, obstructive sleep apnea, and hypertension after 
24 month was about 100%, 65%, 73.33%, 100%, and 76%, respectively. The 
postoperative early and late complications were 6.53% and 11.46%, respectively. 
We did not find significant difference in above results between two age groups 
of 65-70 and > 70 years.
CONCLUSIONS: OAGB can be a good choice in older obese adults because of its 
shorter operative time, higher potency, and low complication rate.

Increasing evidence suggests an association between fine particulate matter 
(PM2.5) exposure and type 2 diabetes mellitus. However, there is still a lack of 
comparative evaluation regarding diabetes burden due to ambient and indoor PM2.5 
pollution at a global scale. This study attempts to provide a systematic and 
comprehensive profile for PM2.5-attributable burden of diabetes and its 
spatiotemporal trends, globally and regionally. Comparative estimates of 
diabetes attributable to ambient PM2.5 and household air pollution (HAP) from 
solid fuels for 204 countries and territories were derived from the Global 
Burden of Disease Study 2019. Globally, 292.5 (95% uncertainty interval: 207.1, 
373.4) thousand deaths and 13.0 (9.1, 17.2) million disability-adjusted life 
years (DALYs) from diabetes were attributed to PM2.5 pollution in 2019, wherein 
more than two-thirds (67.3% deaths and 69.7% DALYs) were contributed by ambient 
PM2.5. Compared to 1990, age-standardized DALY rate (ASDR) in 2019 attributable
