estimates come from the Institute of Health Metrics. Our analysis uses random 
and fixed effect models with a comprehensive set of controls. Life expectancy 
predicted increases in the HPI controlling for potential confounders. We found 
that, this effect varied spatially. Communities that invest their revenue from 
property taxes in public health infrastructure could benefit from a virtuous 
cycle of better health leading to higher property values. Communities that do 
not invest in health could enter vicious cycles and this could widen geospatial 
health and wealth disparities.

BACKGROUND: Comparative evidence on the burden, trend, and risk factors of 
cancer is limited. Using data from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study, we 
aimed to assess cancer burden - incidence, prevalence, mortality, 
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) - and attributable risk factors for 
Australia between 1990 and 2015, and to compare them with those of 34 members of 
the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).
METHODS: The general GBD cancer estimation methods were used with data input 
from vital registration systems and cancer registries. A comparative risk 
assessment approach was used to estimate the population-attributable fractions 
due to risk factors.
RESULTS: In 2015 there were 198,880 (95% uncertainty interval [UI]: 
183,908-217,365) estimated incident cancer cases and 47,562 (95% UI: 
46,061-49,004) cancer deaths in Australia. Twenty-nine percent (95% UI: 
28.2-29.8) of total deaths and 17.0% (95% UI: 15.0-19.1) of DALYs were caused by 
cancer in Australia in 2015. Cancers of the trachea, bronchus and lung, colon 
and rectum, and prostate were the most common causes of cancer deaths. 
Thirty-six percent (95% UI: 33.1-37.9) of all cancer deaths were attributable to 
behavioral risks. The age-standardized cancer incidence rate (ASIR) increased 
between 1990 and 2015, while the age-standardized cancer death rate (ASDR) 
decreased over the same period. In 2015, compared to 34 other OECD countries 
Australia ranked first (highest) and 24th based on ASIR and ASDR, respectively.
CONCLUSION: The incidence of cancer has increased over 25 years, and behavioral 
risks are responsible for a large proportion of cancer deaths. Scaling up of 
prevention (using strategies targeting cancer risk factors), early detection, 
and treatment of cancer is required to effectively address this growing health 
challenge.

INTRODUCTION: The prevalence of smoking among people living with HIV/AIDS 
(PLWHA) remains higher than the general population. Life expectancy among PLWHA 
has increased over the past decade, however, PLWHA who smoke will die younger 
than their non-smoking peers. The primary aim of this pilot study was to examine 
the effects of warm handoff versus fax referral to the quitline for smoking 
cessation among hospitalized smokers living with HIV/AIDS.
METHODS: 25 smokers with a diagnosis of HIV/AIDS hospitalized at a Midwestern 
academic medical center in 2012-2013 (19 male; mean age=47.7; 48% 
African-American) were identified, approached, and randomized to one of two 
treatment arms. At the bedside for patients in warm handoff, staff telephoned 
the quitline for on-the-spot enrollment and counseling. Participants randomized 
to fax were fax-referred to the quitline on the day of discharge. The quitline 
provided continued outpatient counseling to participants in both conditions. The 
main outcome was verified tobacco abstinence at 6-months post randomization.
RESULTS: Enrollment and participation in quitline counseling was high among both 
warm handoff (100%) and fax-referred (71.4%) PLWHA participants. Nearly all 
completed follow up for outcome data collection at 6months. Verified abstinent 
rates were 45.5% in warm handoff versus 14.3% in fax referral at 6months (not 
significant).
CONCLUSIONS: Hospitalized smokers living with HIV/AIDS were highly engaged in 
quitline services. Warm handoff seems a promising intervention for hospitalized 
PLWHA that requires further exploration. Clinical Trials Registration 
NCT01305928.

Bacteria of the genus Campylobacter spp. are one of the most common causes of 
gastroenteritis and can lead to serious sequelae. Several studies have estimated 
the disease burden of Campylobacter spp. with the quantitative metric of 
disability-adjusted life years (DALY). The aim of this systematic review is to 
give an overview of the information available about different countries and 
periods for which DALYs were calculated and how the different results are 
comparable. One of the most important transmission pathways for Campylobacter 
spp. is food. Therefore, special attention was given to studies that only 
estimated the foodborne disease burden of Campylobacter bacteria. With a 
systematic search for the period 1/1996-6/2016, one worldwide and 21 
country-specific publications of the WHO were identified. Because of the 
different methods and the quality of the different data sets, the estimated 
results of all Campylobacter health outcomes of the country-specific studies 
vary from 0.4 DALYs per 100000 people in France to 109 DALY per population in 
Poland. The calculation of the attributable foodborne disease burden was based 
on the estimations of the incidences of all Campylobacter health outcomes with 
the associated uncertainty for each result. So the estimations of the foodborne 
disease burden show a large range from 0.5 DALYs per 100000 people in Greek to 
21.2 DALYs per 100000 people in New Zealand. This span can only be partially 
explained by the country-specific variability in the food production, the 
consumption behavior and the incidence of Campylobacter bacteria.

Publisher: Campylobacter spp. sind Bakterien, die weltweit als einer der 
häufigsten Auslöser für eine Gastroenteritis gelten und zu schwerwiegenden 
Folgeerkrankungen führen können. Die Krankheitslast durch Campylobacterbakterien 
wurde bereits in mehreren Studien mithilfe der quantitativen Maßzahl 
disability-adjusted life years (DALY) für ausgewählte Länder berechnet. Ziel der 
Übersichtsarbeit ist es zu evaluieren, ob die berechneten DALYs in den 
betrachten Ländern und Zeiträume vergleichbar sind und wenn nicht, welche 
Faktoren die Schätzungen beeinflussen. Da als wichtigster Übertragungsweg für 
Campylobacter spp. Lebensmittel gelten, wurden auch Publikationen in die Suche 
einbezogen, die nur die lebensmittelbedingte Krankheitslast abbildeten. Mithilfe 
einer systematischen Literatursuche, wurden 21 länderspezifische Publikationen 
und eine Studie der Weltgesundheitsorganisation im Suchzeitraum 1/1996–6/2016 
gefunden. Durch unterschiedliche Methoden bei der Berechnung der Krankheitslast 
sowie die Qualitätsunterschiede der Daten schwanken die Ergebnisse der 
Schätzungen der Gesamtkrankheitslast in den länderspezifischen Publikationen von 
0,4 DALYs in Frankreich bis 109 DALY pro 100000 Einwohner in Polen. Da die 
Berechnung des attributablen Risikos auf Grundlage der mit Unsicherheiten 
behafteten Schätzungen der Inzidenzen der campylobacterbedingten Erkrankungen 
erfolgt, zeigen sich auch bei der lebensmittelbedingten Krankheitslast große 
Spannweiten von 0,5 DALYs pro 100000 Einwohner in Griechenland bis 21,2 DALY pro 
100000 Einwohner in Neuseeland, welche nicht ausschließlich auf die 
länderspezifischen Variabilität in der Produktion, dem Verzehrsverhalten und dem 
Vorkommen von Campylobacter spp. zurückzuführen sind.

BACKGROUND: Menopause is a natural phenomenon occurring as women approach 
middle-age. It is characterized by declining of ovarian function and onset of 
the last menstrual period and subsequent 12-month cessation of menstruation. Due 
to a growing aging population and longer life expectancies, sub-Saharan African 
women will spend a significant portion of their lives in postmenopause. 
Menopausal symptom research has been primarily conducted on Caucasian women from 
high-income countries. Understanding menopause symptom prevalence and 
perceptions among diverse women in Ethiopia will better inform reproductive 
health care.
METHODS: We conducted a multi-stage, cross-sectional study on 226 perimenopausal 
and postmenopausal women aged 30-49 years in Gulele sub-city of Addis Ababa, 
Ethiopia. Data on socio-demographic characteristics, menopausal status and an 
11-item Menopause Rating Scale (MRS) were collected using 
interviewer-administered questionnaire. Statistical analyses consisted of 
descriptive data and chi-squared analyses.
RESULTS: Study participants were 40.4 ± 5.9 years, on average, with the majority 
married, educated at secondary school level, and comprised different ethnicities 
and wealth tertiles. The most prevalent types of menopausal symptoms reported 
from the MRS were from somatic subscale (65.9%) while psychological (46.0%) and 
urogenital subscale symptoms (30.5%) were also prevalent. The most commonly 
reported individual symptoms were: hot flushes (65.9% (95% CI: 59.4%-72.1%)), 
difficulty falling asleep (49.6% (95% CI: 42.9%-56.3%)), depressive mood (46.0% 
(95% CI: 39.4%-52.8%)), irritability (45.1% (95% CI: 38.5%-51.9%)), and anxiety 
(39.8% (95% CI: 33.4%-46.5%)). Each of the somatic, psychological, and 
urogenital MRS subscale scores were higher among postmenopausal women compared 
to perimenopausal women. Women self-reported differing severity levels of 
symptoms with high severity reported in 8.4% of total MRS, 1.3% of somatic, 
10.6% of psychological, and 8.4% of urogenital scales.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides the first presentation of menopausal symptoms 
among perimenopausal and postmenopausal women in the Gulele sub-city of Addis 
Ababa, Ethiopia. We capture the prevalence of menopausal symptoms experienced as 
well as self-rated severity through the MRS. Our findings reflect menopausal 
symptoms in our specific study population and have been found to be consistent 
with previous international research.

BACKGROUND: World Health Organisation recommends routine Human Papilloma Virus 
(HPV) vaccination for girls when its cost-effectiveness in the country or region 
has been duly considered. We therefore aimed to evaluate cost-effectiveness of 
HPV vaccination in Nigeria using pragmatic parameter estimates for cost and 
programme coverage, i.e. realistically achievable in the studied context.
METHODS: A microsimulation frame-work was used. The natural history for cervical 
cancer disease was remodelled from a previous Nigerian model-based study. 
Costing was based on health providers' perspective. Disability adjusted life 
years attributable to cervical cancer mortality served as benefit estimate. 
Suitable policy option was obtained by calculating the incremental 
costs-effectiveness ratio. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was used to assess 
parameter uncertainty. One-way sensitivity analysis was used to explore the 
robustness of the policy recommendation to key parameters alteration. Expected 
value of perfect information (EVPI) was calculated to determine the expected 
opportunity cost associated with choosing the optimal scenario or strategy at 
the maximum cost-effectiveness threshold.
RESULTS: Combination of the current scenario of opportunistic screening and 
national HPV vaccination programme (CS + NV) was the only cost-effective and 
robust policy option. However, CS + NV scenario was only cost-effective so far 
the unit cost of HPV vaccine did not exceed $5. EVPI analysis showed that it may 
be worthwhile to conduct additional research to inform the decision to adopt 
CS + NV.
CONCLUSIONS: National HPV vaccination combined with opportunist cervical cancer 
screening is cost-effective in Nigeria. However, adoption of this strategy 
should depend on its relative efficiency when compared to other competing new 
vaccines and health interventions.

BACKGROUND: The approval of anti-programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) and 
anti-programmed death 1 agents has expanded treatment options for patients with 
locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma. Avelumab, a human 
monoclonal anti-PD-L1 antibody, has shown promising antitumour activity and 
safety in this disease. We aimed to assess the safety profile in patients (both 
post-platinum therapy and cisplatin-naive) treated with avelumab and to assess 
antitumour activity of this drug in post-platinum patients.
METHODS: In this pooled analysis of two cohorts from the phase 1 dose-expansion 
JAVELIN Solid Tumor study, patients aged 18 years and older with histologically 
or cytologically confirmed locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma 
that had progressed after at least one previous platinum-based chemotherapy were 
enrolled from 80 cancer treatment centres or hospitals in the USA, Europe, and 
Asia. Eligible patients had adequate end-organ function, an Eastern Cooperative 
Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1, life expectancy of at least 3 
months, and at least one measurable lesion. Cisplatin-ineligible patients who 
might have been previously treated in the perioperative setting, including 
platinum-naive patients, were also eligible. Patients unselected for PD-L1 
expression received avelumab (10 mg/kg, 1 h intravenous infusion) every 2 weeks 
until confirmed disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or other criterion 
for withdrawal. The primary endpoint for this efficacy expansion cohort was 
confirmed best overall response (according to RECIST version 1.1), adjudicated 
by independent review. Safety analysis was done in all patients who received at 
least one dose of avelumab. Antitumour activity was assessed in post-platinum 
patients who received at least one dose of avelumab. This trial is registered 
with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01772004; enrolment in this cohort of 
patients with metastatic urothelial carcinoma is closed and the trial is 
ongoing.
FINDINGS: Between Sept 3, 2014, and March 15, 2016, 329 patients with advanced 
metastatic urothelial carcinoma were screened for enrolment into this study; 249 
patients were eligible and received treatment with avelumab for a median of 12 
weeks (IQR 6·0-19·7) and followed up for a median of 9·9 months (4·3-12·1). 
Safety and antitumour activity were evaluated at data cutoff on June 9, 2016. In 
161 post-platinum patients with at least 6 months of follow-up, a best overall 
response of complete or partial response was recorded in 27 patients (17%; 95% 
CI 11-24), including nine (6%) complete responses and 18 (11%) partial 
responses. The most frequent treatment-related adverse events (any grade in ≥10% 
patients) were infusion-related reaction (73 [29%]; all grade 1-2) and fatigue 
(40 [16%]). Grade 3 or worse treatment-related adverse events occurred in 21 
(8%) of 249 patients, the most common of which were fatigue (four [2%]), and 
asthenia, elevated lipase, hypophosphataemia, and pneumonitis in two (1%) 
patients each. 19 (8%) of 249 patients had a serious adverse event related to 
treatment with avelumab, and one treatment-related death occurred (pneumonitis).
INTERPRETATION: Avelumab showed antitumour activity in the treatment of patients 
with platinum-refractory metastatic urothelial carcinoma; a manageable safety 
profile was reported in all avelumab-treated patients. These data provide the 
rationale for therapeutic use of avelumab in metastatic urothelial carcinoma and 
it has received accelerated US FDA approval in this setting on this basis.

Rodent studies demonstrate that supplementing the maternal diet with choline 
during pregnancy produces life-long cognitive benefits for the offspring. In 
contrast, the two experimental studies examining cognitive effects of maternal 
choline supplementation in humans produced inconsistent results, perhaps because 
of poor participant adherence and/or uncontrolled variation in intake of choline 
or other nutrients. We examined the effects of maternal choline supplementation 
during pregnancy on infant cognition, with intake of choline and other nutrients 
tightly controlled. Women entering their third trimester were randomized to 
consume, until delivery, either 480 mg choline/d ( n = 13) or 930 mg choline/d ( 
n = 13). Infant information processing speed and visuospatial memory were tested 
at 4, 7, 10, and 13 mo of age ( n = 24). Mean reaction time averaged across the 
four ages was significantly faster for infants born to mothers in the 930 ( vs. 
480) mg choline/d group. This result indicates that maternal consumption of 
approximately twice the recommended amount of choline during the last trimester 
improves infant information processing speed. Furthermore, for the 480-mg 
choline/d group, there was a significant linear effect of exposure duration 
(infants exposed longer showed faster reaction times), suggesting that even 
modest increases in maternal choline intake during pregnancy may produce 
cognitive benefits for offspring.-Caudill, M. A., Strupp, B. J., Muscalu, L., 
Nevins, J. E. H., Canfield, R. L. Maternal choline supplementation during the 
third trimester of pregnancy improves infant information processing speed: a

BACKGROUND: Per oral endoscopic myotomy (POEM) has recently emerged as a viable 
option relative to the classic approach of laparoscopic Heller myotomy (LHM) for 
the treatment of esophageal achalasia. In this cost-utility analysis of POEM and 
LHM, we hypothesized that POEM would be cost-effective relative to LHM.
METHODS: A stochastic cost-utility analysis of treatment for achalasia was 
performed to determine the cost-effectiveness of POEM relative to LHM. Costs 
were estimated from the provider perspective and obtained from our institution's 
cost-accounting database. The measure of effectiveness was quality-adjusted life 
years (QALYs) which were estimated from direct elicitation of utility using a 
visual analog scale. The primary outcome was the incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio (ICER). Uncertainty was assessed by bootstrapping the sample and computing 
the cost-effectiveness acceptability curve (CEAC).
RESULTS: Patients treated within an 11-year period (2004-2016) were recruited 
for participation (20 POEM, 21 LHM). During the index admission, the mean costs 
for POEM ($8630 ± $2653) and the mean costs for LHM ($7604 ± $2091) were not 
significantly different (P = 0.179). Additionally, mean QALYs for POEM 
(0.413 ± 0.248) were higher than that associated with LHM (0.357 ± 0.338), but 
this difference was also not statistically significant (P = 0.55). The ICER 
suggested that it would cost an additional $18,536 for each QALY gained using 
POEM. There was substantial uncertainty in the ICER; there was a 48.25% 
probability that POEM was cost-effective at the mean ICER. At a 
willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000, there was a 68.31% probability that 
POEM was cost-effective relative to LHM.
CONCLUSIONS: In the treatment of achalasia, POEM appears to be cost-effective 
relative to LHM depending on one's willingness-to-pay for an additional QALY.

Chickenpox is an extremely contagious infectious disease caused by varicella 
zoster virus (VZV). It is a common childhood illness characterised by an itchy 
vesicular rash and fever, which usually resolves spontaneously without medical 
intervention. Serious, and rarely fatal, complications can occur, including 
pneumonia, central nervous system infection, overwhelming secondary bacterial 
infections, especially with Group A streptococcus, and necrotising fasciitis. 
Therefore it is crucial that emergency department (ED) nurses can recognise the 
signs and symptoms that indicate deterioration. This article reviews best 
practice management of children with chickenpox, gives up-to-date guidance on 
the safe use of antipyretics, the avoidance of ibuprofen and discusses 
immunisation against VZV. It also includes implications for nursing practice and 
a case study that illustrates some of the challenges that ED nurses may 
encounter.

Medicine, Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, the Netherlands.

BACKGROUND: In the Netherlands a substantial proportion of newly diagnosed human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) patients present late for care and an estimated 
12-34% of people living with HIV are undiagnosed. Linkage to care of these 
patients is important to decrease HIV transmission and to improve individual 
patient outcomes. We investigated if non-targeted HIV testing in emergency 
departments is a useful and cost-effective way to identify these patients.
METHODS: In a cross-sectional multicentre study, eligible adult patients who 
underwent phlebotomy were given an active choice to be additionally tested for 
HIV. In a subset of patients, risk factors for HIV infection were asked for. A 
cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted.
RESULTS: Of 7577 eligible patients, 3223 patients were tested, and two new HIV 
infections were diagnosed (0.06%). Both patients had risk factors for HIV 
infection. Non-targeted HIV testing in the emergency department was not 
considered cost-effective, with a cost per quality adjusted life years gained of 
€ 77,050, more than triple the Dutch cost-effectiveness threshold of € 20,000.
CONCLUSION: Non-targeted HIV testing in emergency departments in the Netherlands 
had a low yield of newly diagnosed HIV infections and was not cost-effective. 
Our data suggest that targeted HIV testing may offer an alternative approach to 
decrease the number of undiagnosed people living with HIV.

Paediatric palliative care is no longer restricted to patients with cancer and 
has been extended to patients with other chronic conditions, such as cystic 
fibrosis or neuromuscular disorders. This review focused on the current state of 
palliative care for children and adolescents with chronic kidney disease (CKD). 
We assessed the literature on CKD published up to August 2017. All the papers, 
except one from 1996, were published this century. This review discusses the 
role that palliative care plays in the process of decision-making and explores 
the possibilities of implementing palliative care into the routine therapy of 
affected patients and providing support for their families. Offering early 
palliative care as an integral part of the kidney, supportive care provided by 
the nephrology care team is both necessary and feasible for patients with CKD. 
As a minimum, a specialised palliative care team should be involved in patients 
with multiple comorbidities, in conservative treatment scenarios and in acute 
life-threatening complications. Further studies and guidelines are required to 
improve the care of patients with CKD and their families.
CONCLUSION: Supportive palliative care should be implemented into the routine 
care of patients with life-limiting kidney disease.

How do slums change the relationship between urbanization and the carbon 
intensity of well-being?

This study examines how the relationship between urbanization (measured as the 
percentage of total population living in urban areas) and the carbon intensity 
of well-being (CIWB) (measured as a ratio of carbon dioxide emissions and life 
expectancy) in most nations from 1960-2013 varies based on the economic context 
and whereabouts of a substantial portion of a nation's urban population. To 
accomplish this, we use the United Nations' (UN) definition of slum households 
to identify developing countries that have substantial slum populations, and 
estimate a Prais-Winsten regression model with panel-corrected standard errors 
(PCSE), allowing for disturbances that are heteroskedastic and contemporaneously 
correlated across panels. Our findings indicate that the rate of increase in 
CIWB for countries without substantial slum populations begins to slow down at 
higher levels of urbanization, however, the association between urbanization and 
CIWB is much smaller in countries with substantial slum populations. Overall, 
while urbanization is associated with increases in CIWB, the relationship 
between urban development and CIWB is vastly different in developed nations 
without slums than in under-developed nations with slums.

BACKGROUND: Apremilast, an oral phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor, has demonstrated 
efficacy in patients with moderate to severe psoriasis.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate long-term efficacy and safety of apremilast in 
biologic-naive patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis and safety of 
switching from etanercept to apremilast in the phase 3b LIBERATE trial.
METHODS: Two hundred fifty patients were randomized to placebo, apremilast 30 mg 
BID or etanercept 50 mg QW through Week 16; thereafter, all patients continued 
or switched to apremilast through Week 104 (extension phase). Skin, scalp and 
nail involvement at Weeks 16, 52 and 104 were assessed using the Psoriasis Area 
and Severity Index (PASI; 0-72), Scalp Physician Global Assessment (ScPGA; 0-5) 
and Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (NAPSI; 0-8); patient-reported outcomes (PROs) 
were assessed using the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI; 0-32) and pruritus 
visual analog scale (VAS; 0-100 mm).
RESULTS: The apremilast-extension phase (Weeks 16-104) included 226 patients in 
the placebo/apremilast (n = 73), apremilast/apremilast (n = 74) and 
etanercept/apremilast (n = 79) groups, and at Week 104, 50.7%, 45.9% and 51.9% 
of these patients, respectively, maintained ≥75% reduction from baseline in PASI 
score (based on last-observation-carried-forward analysis). Across treatment 
groups, ScPGA 0 (clear) or 1 (minimal) was achieved by 50.0%-59.2% of patients; 
NAPSI mean change from baseline was -48.1% to -51.1%; DLQI score ≤5 was achieved 
by 66.0%-72.5% of patients; and pruritus VAS mean change from baseline was -24.4 
to -32.3. AEs in ≥5% of patients (diarrhoea, nausea, nasopharyngitis, upper 
respiratory tract infection and headache) did not increase with prolonged 
apremilast exposure.
CONCLUSIONS: Apremilast demonstrated significant and sustained improvements in 
skin, scalp, nails and PROs (pruritus and quality of life) over 104 weeks in 
patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. Safety was consistent with 
the known safety profile of apremilast.

Understanding the effects of widespread disruption of the social fabric on 
public health outcomes can provide insight into the forces that drive major 
political realignment. Our objective was to estimate the association between 
increases in mortality in middle-aged non-Hispanic white adults from 1999 to 
2005 to 2009-2015, health inequalities in life expectancy by income, and the 
surge in support for the Republican Party in pivotal US counties in the 2016 
presidential election. We conducted a longitudinal ecological study in 2764 US 
counties from 1999 to 2016. Increases in mortality were measured using 
age-specific (45-54 years of age) all-cause mortality from 1999 to 2005 to 
2009-2015 at the county level. Support for the Republican Party was measured as 
the party's vote share in the presidential election in 2016 adjusted for results 
in 2008 and 2012. We found a significant up-turn in mortality from 1999 to 2005 
to 2009-2015 in counties where the Democratic Party won twice (2008 and 2012) 
but where the Republican Party won in 2016 (+10.7/100,000), as compared to those 
in which the Democratic Party won in 2016 (-15.7/100,000). An increase in 
mortality of 15.2/100,000 was associated with a significant (p < 0.001) 1% vote 
swing from the 2008-2012 average to 2016. We also found that counties with wider 
health inequalities in life expectancy were more likely to vote Republican in 
2016, regardless of the previous voting patterns. Counties with worsening 
premature mortality in the last 15 years and wider health inequalities shifted 
votes toward the Republican Party presidential candidate. Further understanding 
of causes of unanticipated deterioration in health in the general population can 
inform social policy.

In recent years, the treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) 
was greatly promoted by the discovery of oncogenic drivers and the development 
of targeted therapies specific for these drivers. Somatic mutations in epidermal 
growth factor receptor (EGFR) are the most common type in patients with NSCLC. 
Small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) targeting EGFR produced 
relatively high response rate and long duration with acceptable toxicity 
profile. Also, the life expectancy in patients with active EGFR mutation has 
been significantly prolonged than the past. Additionally, evolution of advanced 
imaging and radiation techniques has expanded the indications for radiotherapy 
in complex clinical situation. All of those factors contributed to the widely 
use of radiotherapy for advanced NSCLC treated with TKI therapy. In this review, 
we will discuss how to integrate radiotherapy into the comprehensive treatment 
of patients with TKI therapy in order to maximize the therapeutics effect.

Five reasons for caution in advocating low-dose computerized tomographic lung 
cancer screening.

University, Portland, OR, USA.

The 53.5K-person, low-dose computerized tomographic (LDCT), National Lung Cancer 
Screening Trial (NLST) achieved a 20% reduction in lung cancer mortality and a 
6.7% reduction in all-cause mortality at 6.5-year median follow-up. Failure of 
European LDCT trials employing null (i.e., unscreened) controls to reproduce 
this benefit compels caution in adopting a policy of population screening. 
Additional concerns merit attention: surgical mortality is not trivial; 
overdiagnosis is substantial; disease-free life expectancy and quality of life 
are markedly diminished by loss of pulmonary reserve; the combination of 
overdiagnosis and diminished disease-free life expectancy is pernicious.

BACKGROUND: Uncontrolled active rheumatoid arthritis can lead to increasing 
disability and reduced quality of life over time. 'Treating to target' has been 
shown to be effective in active established disease and also in early disease. 
However, there is a lack of nationally agreed treatment protocols for patients 
with established rheumatoid arthritis who have intermediate disease activity. 
This trial is designed to investigate whether intensive management of disease 
leads to a greater number of remissions at 12 months. Levels of disability and 
quality of life, and acceptability and cost-effectiveness of the intervention 
will also be examined.
METHODS: The trial is a 12-month, pragmatic, randomised, open-label, two-arm, 
parallel-group, multicentre trial undertaken at specialist rheumatology centres 
across England. Three hundred and ninety-eight patients with established 
rheumatoid arthritis will be recruited. They will currently have intermediate 
disease activity (disease activity score for 28 joints assessed using an 
erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 3.2 to 5.1 with at least three active joints) 
and will be taking at least one disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug. 
Participants will be randomly selected to receive intensive management or 
standard care. Intensive management will involve monthly clinical reviews with a 
specialist health practitioner, where drug treatment will be optimised and an 
individualised treatment support programme delivered based on several principles 
of motivational interviewing to address identified problem areas, such as pain, 
fatigue and adherence. Standard care will follow standard local pathways and 
will be in line with current English guidelines from the National Institute for 
Health and Clinical Excellence. Patients will be assessed initially and at 6 and 
12 months through self-completed questionnaires and clinical evaluation.
DISCUSSION: The trial will establish whether the known benefits of intensive 
treatment strategies in active rheumatoid arthritis are also seen in patients 
with established rheumatoid arthritis who have moderately active disease. It 
will evaluate both the clinical and cost-effectiveness of intensive treatment.
