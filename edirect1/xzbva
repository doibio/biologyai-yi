PURPOSE: The increasing life expectancy of the population prompts an array of 
health conditions that impair an older adults' quality of life (QoL). Although 
demographics and spirituality have been associated with QoL, limited literature 
elucidated the exact mechanisms of their interactions, especially in a 
culturally-diverse country like Philippines. Hence, this study determined the 
relationship among socio-demographics, spirituality, and QoL of Filipino older 
adults in a community and institutional setting.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A predictive-correlational study among 200 
randomly-selected community-dwelling and institutionalized older adults was 
conducted, with a 99% power and a medium effect size. Data were collected using 
a three-part questionnaire from September to November 2015. The questionnaire 
was composed of the robotfoto, Spirituality Assessment Scale, and modified Older 
People's Quality of Life which assessed socio-demographics, spirituality, and 
QoL.
RESULTS: Analysis showed that institutionalization in a nursing home positively 
and negatively affected spirituality and QoL, generating an acceptable model 
(χ(2)/df=2.12, RMSEA=0.08, and CFI=0.95). The negative direct effect of 
institutionalization on social relationship, leisure, & social activities QoL 
(β=-0.42, p<0.01) also initiates a cascade of indirect negative effects on both 
spirituality and QoL dimensions.
CONCLUSIONS: The development of a structural model illustrating the 
interrelationship of socio-demographics, spirituality, and QoL helps healthcare 
professionals in predicting facets of spirituality and QoL that can be 
compromised by living in a nursing home. This understanding provides impetus in 
evaluating and refining geriatric healthcare programs, policies, and protocols 
to render individualized, holistic care in a socially-cohesive environment among 
older adults.

While increasing life expectancy is a major achievement, the global aging of 
societies raises a number of medical issues, such as the development of 
age-related disorders, including neurodegenerative diseases. The three main 
disease groups constituting the majority of neurodegenerative diseases are 
tauopathies, alpha-synucleinopathies and diseases due to repetitions of 
glutamine (including Huntington's disease). In each neurodegenerative disease, 
the accumulation of one or more aggregated proteins has been identified as the 
molecular signature of the disease (as seen, for example, in Alzheimer's 
disease, Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, amyotrophic lateral 
sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia). The etiology of neurodegenerative 
diseases is often multifactorial, and the known risk factors include, in 
addition to genetic polymorphisms and age, some other possible causes, such as 
certain immune and metabolic conditions, endocrine pathologies, gender, 
socioeconomic or professional status, oxidative stress or inflammation, vitamin 
deficiencies and environmental factors (chemical exposure, metals). However, 
innovative strategies to elaborate suitable diagnostic and therapeutic 
approaches (aiming to at least delay or possibly even reverse disease 
progression) require further knowledge of the genetic and adaptive immunological 
characteristics of neurodegenerative diseases.

Oro-pharyngeal dysphagia commonly occurs in patients with infantile onset Pompe 
disease (IOPD), which is a rare recessive neuromuscular disorder caused by 
deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme acid alpha-glucosidase. Without treatment, 
death occurs by 1 year of age from cardiorespiratory failure. Enzyme replacement 
therapy (ERT) has been used to increase life expectancy, however emerging 
developmental and medical morbidities have become apparent. A case file review 
of the feeding outcomes of 12 patients with IOPD, managed at a single tertiary 
centre, was undertaken. Two types of assessment had been completed: clinical 
feeding assessment (CFA) and instrumental videofluoroscopy swallow study (VFSS). 
A rating of functional oral intake at every Speech and Language Therapy feeding 
assessment from initial diagnosis to the most recent assessment was applied 
using the functional oral intake scale (FOIS).Results indicate, initial 
diagnosis VFSS predicts long-term feeding outcomes. Even if a patient had an 
improvement in oral feeding after diagnosis, over a period of time their oral 
intake returned to the initial diagnosis VFSS level or below. All patients (8/8) 
who required non-oral feeding support under 6 months of age went on to require 
non-oral feeding support, even if they had periods of full oral feeding. CRIM 
negative status predicted significant oral feeding difficulties. An 
evidence-based follow-up protocol was developed. The information is used at 
diagnosis to counsel families regarding feeding prognosis and consideration of 
early gastrostomy when cardiac status allows safe anaesthesia. The results 
reinforce that feeding changes over time and patients require on-going dysphagia 
monitoring.

A computationally efficient 3DHZETRN code with enhanced neutron and light ion (Z 
≤ 2) propagation was recently developed for complex, inhomogeneous shield 
geometry described by combinatorial objects. Comparisons were made between 
3DHZETRN results and Monte Carlo (MC) simulations at locations within the 
combinatorial geometry, and it was shown that 3DHZETRN agrees with the MC codes 
to the extent they agree with each other. In the present report, the 3DHZETRN 
code is extended to enable analysis in ray-trace geometry. This latest extension 
enables the code to be used within current engineering design practices 
utilizing fully detailed vehicle and habitat geometries. Through convergence 
testing, it is shown that fidelity in an actual shield geometry can be 
maintained in the discrete ray-trace description by systematically increasing 
the number of discrete rays used. It is also shown that this fidelity is carried 
into transport procedures and resulting exposure quantities without sacrificing 
computational efficiency.

With the increasing life expectancy of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), 
prevalence of late complications such as CF-related bone disease (CFBD) has 
increased. It was initially described in 24% of the adult population with CF and 
has also been reported in the pediatric population. CFBD is multifactorial and 
progresses in different steps. Both decreased bone formation and increased bone 
resorption (in different amounts) are observed. CFBD is likely primitive 
(directly related to the CFTR defect itself), but is also worsened by acquired 
secondary factors such as lung infections, chronic inflammation, denutrition, 
vitamin deficiency, and decreased physical activity. CFBD may be clinically 
apparent (i.e., mainly vertebral and costal fractures), or clinically 
asymptomatic (therefore corresponding to abnormalities in bone density and 
architecture). CFBD management mainly aims to prevent the occurrence of 
fractures. Prevention and regular monitoring of bone disease as early as 8 years 
of age is of the utmost importance, as is the control of possible secondary 
deleterious CFBD factors. New radiological tools, such as high-resolution 
peripheral quantitative computed tomography, allow an accurate evaluation of 
cortical and trabecular bone micro-architecture in addition to compartmental 
density; as such, they will likely improve the assessment of the bone fracture 
threat in CF patients in the near future.

BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Chronic neck pain is a prevalent and disabling condition 
among older adults. Despite the large burden of neck pain, little is known 
regarding the cost-effectiveness of commonly used treatments.
PURPOSE: This study aimed to estimate the cost-effectiveness of home exercise 
and advice (HEA), spinal manipulative therapy (SMT) plus HEA, and supervised 
rehabilitative exercise (SRE) plus HEA.
STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: Cost-effectiveness analysis conducted alongside a 
randomized clinical trial (RCT) was performed.
PATIENT SAMPLE: A total of 241 older adults (≥65 years) with chronic mechanical 
neck pain comprised the patient sample.
OUTCOME MEASURES: The outcome measures were direct and indirect costs, neck 
pain, neck disability, SF-6D-derived quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) over a 1-year time horizon.
METHODS: This work was supported by grants from the National Center for 
Complementary and Integrative Health (#F32AT007507), National Institute of 
Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (#P60AR062799), and Health 
Resources and Services Administration (#R18HP01425). The RCT is registered at 
ClinicalTrials.gov (#NCT00269308). A societal perspective was adopted for the 
primary analysis. A healthcare perspective was adopted as a sensitivity 
analysis. Cost-effectivenesswas a secondary aim of the RCT which was not powered 
for differences in costs or QALYs. Differences in costs and clinical outcomes 
were estimated using generalized estimating equations and linear mixed models, 
respectively. Cost-effectiveness acceptability curves were calculated to assess 
the uncertainty surrounding cost-effectiveness estimates.
RESULTS: Total costs for SMT+HEA were 5% lower than HEA (mean difference: -$111; 
95% confidence interval [CI] -$1,354 to $899) and 47% lower than SRE+HEA (mean 
difference: -$1,932; 95% CI -$2,796 to -$1,097). SMT+HEA also resulted in a 
greater reduction of neck pain over the year relative to HEA (0.57; 95% CI 0.23 
to 0.92) and SRE+HEA (0.41; 95% CI 0.05 to 0.76). Differences in disability and 
QALYs favored SMT+HEA. The probability that adding SMT to HEA is cost-effective 
at willingness to pay thresholds of $50,000 to $200,000 per QALY gained ranges 
from 0.75 to 0.81. If adopting a health-care perspective, costs for SMT+HEA were 
66% higher than HEA (mean difference: $515; 95% CI $225 to $1,094), resulting in 
an ICER of $55,975 per QALY gained.
CONCLUSION: On average, SMT+HEA resulted in better clinical outcomes and lower 
total societal costs relative to SRE+HEA and HEA alone, with a 0.75 to 0.81 
probability of cost-effectiveness for willingness to pay thresholds of $50,000 
to $200,000 per QALY.

BACKGROUND: Mortality among 4,545 toluene diisocyante (TDI)-exposed workers was 
updated through 2011. The primary outcome of interest was lung cancer.
METHODS: Life table analyses, including internal analyses by exposure duration 
and cumulative TDI exposure, were conducted.
RESULTS: Compared with the US population, all cause and all cancer mortality was 
increased. Lung cancer mortality was increased but was not associated with 
exposure duration or cumulative TDI exposure. In post hoc analyses, lung cancer 
mortality was associated with employment duration in finishing jobs, but not in 
finishing jobs involving cutting polyurethane foam.
CONCLUSIONS: Dermal exposure, in contrast to inhalational exposure, to TDI is 
expected to be greater in finishing jobs and may play a role in the observed 
increase in lung cancer mortality. Limitations include the lack of smoking data, 
uncertainty in the exposure estimates, and exposure estimates that reflected 
inhalational exposure only. Am. J. Ind. Med. 59:630-643, 2016. Published 2016.

Maximum likelihood estimate of life expectancy in the prehistoric Jomon: Canine 
pulp volume reduction suggests a longer life expectancy than previously thought.

Recent theoretical progress potentially refutes past claims that 
paleodemographic estimations are flawed by statistical problems, including age 
mimicry and sample bias due to differential preservation. The life expectancy at 
age 15 of the Jomon period prehistoric populace in Japan was initially estimated 
to have been ∼16 years while a more recent analysis suggested 31.5 years. In 
this study, we provide alternative results based on a new methodology. The 
material comprises 234 mandibular canines from Jomon period skeletal remains and 
a reference sample of 363 mandibular canines of recent-modern Japanese. Dental 
pulp reduction is used as the age-indicator, which because of tooth durability 
is presumed to minimize the effect of differential preservation. Maximum 
likelihood estimation, which theoretically avoids age mimicry, was applied. Our 
methods also adjusted for the known pulp volume reduction rate among 
recent-modern Japanese to provide a better fit for observations in the Jomon 
period sample. Without adjustment for the known rate in pulp volume reduction, 
estimates of Jomon life expectancy at age 15 were dubiously long. However, when 
the rate was adjusted, the estimate results in a value that falls within the 
range of modern hunter-gatherers, with significantly better fit to the 
observations. The rate-adjusted result of 32.2 years more likely represents the 
true life expectancy of the Jomon people at age 15, than the result without 
adjustment. Considering ∼7% rate of antemortem loss of the mandibular canine 
observed in our Jomon period sample, actual life expectancy at age 15 may have 
been as high as ∼35.3 years.

OBJECTIVE: To analyze the disease burden of lung cancer in the Chinese 
population, in 1990 and 2013.
METHODS: Indicators including mortality rate, years of life lost due to 
premature mortality (YLL), years lived with disability (YLD), and 
disability-adjusted of life years (DALY) on lung cancer, were from the results 
of Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2013 and were used to describe the burden of 
disease caused by lung cancer in the Chinese population. Data described the 
disease burden of lung cancer in China by calculating the changing rates on 
corresponding parameters in 1990 and 2013.
RESULTS: In China, in 1990 and 2013, the standardized mortality rate of lung 
cancer increased from 36.04/100 000 to 40.41/100 000 (increased by 12.13%), the 
standardized YLL rate decreased from 805.07/100 000 to 781.09/100 000 (decreased 
by 2.98%), the standardized YLD rate increased from 8.57/100 000 to 11.13/100 
000 (increased by 29.87%) and the standardized DALY rate decreased from 
813.64/100 000 to 792.22/100 000 (decreased by 2.63%). Compared with data in 
1990,parameters as the number of deaths, YLL, YLD and DALY of lung cancer all 
increased, especially in males. Mortality and the DALY rate of lung cancer 
increased with age in both genders. Mortality and DALY rate were higher in males 
than those in females in all the age groups. Geographically, standard mortality 
rate and standard DALY rate in northeast region, north region, southwest region 
(Sichuan and Chongqing) and part of the east and central regions appeared 
significantly higher than those in other regions but lower in western region 
than those in other regions, in 2013.
CONCLUSIONS: Burden of disease caused by lung cancer remained serious in China. 
Provincially,the burden of disease caused by lung cancer appeared different. It 
is important to strengthen the prevention and control programs that related to 
lung cancer.

OBJECTIVE: To analyze the disease burden of liver cancer in the Chinese 
population in 1990 and 2013.
METHODS: Data from Global Burden of Diseases 2013 (GBD2013) was used to analyze 
the disease burden of liver cancer in China. The main outcome measurements would 
include mortality and disability-adjusted life years (DALY). Again, GBD global 
standard population in 2013 was used as the reference population to calculate 
the age-standardized rate. Related changes on percentage from 1990 to 2013 were 
calculated to analyze the changing patterns of disease burden for liver cancer 
in China.
RESULTS: In 2013, a total of 358 100 people died of liver cancer, with the crude 
death rate as 25.85/100 000, in China. Number of deaths due to liver cancer 
secondary to hepatitis B was 163 600 (accounting for 45.69%). Number of deaths 
due to liver cancer secondary to hepatitis C was 134 200 (accounting for 37.48%) 
with DALY due to liver cancer appeared as 40.80 million person years. In 2013, 
the leading causes of DALY related to liver cancer was liver cancer secondary to 
hepatitis B, followed by liver cancer secondary to hepatitis C, liver cancer 
secondary to alcohol use, other liver cancers, with related DALYs as 4 652.0, 3 
394.3, 964.3 and 592.1 thousands person years, respectively. The disease burdens 
of liver cancer secondary to various kinds of liver cancer were significantly 
higher in males than in females. Compared with 1990, the standardized mortality 
of liver cancer reduced by 25.00%, the DALY attributable to liver cancer 
increased by 16.95% and the standardized DALY rate attributable to liver cancer 
reduced by 33.47%. The burden of liver cancer secondary to hepatitis C became 
more serious and the standardized death rate increased by 106.18%, together with 
the standardized DALY rate increased by 91.68% in the past 23 years. Disease 
burden of liver cancer among young adults and the elderly were most serious. 
When comparing with the data in 1990, the standardized DALY rate showed 
declining trend in all the age groups, with the most seen in the 5-14 year 
group. The standardized DALY rate, secondary to hepatitis B had a 46.37% 
decrease in the 5-14 year olds. The standardized DALY rate secondary to 
hepatitis C showed an increasing trend in all the age groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Liver cancer had been one of the serious diseases that causing 
heavy disease burden in China. In recent years, the disease burden of liver 
cancer secondary to hepatitis B decreased but the disease burden of liver cancer 
secondary to hepatitis C significantly increased. Disease burden on liver cancer 
in male population was significantly higher than that in females, showing that 
related targeted prevention and control measures should be imminently carried 
out.

OBJECTIVE: To analyze the national and provincial disease burden on stomach 
cancer in the Chinese population, in 1990 and 2013.
METHODS: Data related to province-specific burden of disease in China was used 
to analyze the standardized incidence and mortality of stomach cancer in 2013. 
Parameters as incidence, mortality, disability-adjusted life years (DALY), years 
of life lost due to premature mortality (YLL) and years lived with disability 
(YLD) on stomach cancer in China in 1990 and 2013, were analyzed while the 
standardized incidence and mortality of stomach cancer in 1990 and 2013 and the 
changing patterns in each province were described.
RESULTS: In 2013, there were 371 100 new cases of stomach cancer and 317 800 
cases died from stomach cancer in China. Figures on the standardized incidence 
(26.84/100 000), mortality rate (23.55/100 000) and DALY rate (464.47/100 000) 
all increased with age. Between 1990 and 2013, the standardized incidence rates 
in men were all higher than that in women (2.03-2.67 times) but both showed a 
decreasing trend. Under the reported figures, 317 800 people died from stomach 
cancer in 2013, with an increase of 13.15%. The number of deaths was 182 700, in 
1990. From 1990 to 2013, the standardized mortality rate, DALY and DALY rate 
decreased in both genders,with more seen in women than in men. The top three 
provinces that having the highest stomach cancer standardized incidences and 
mortality in 2013 were Qinghai, Anhui, Gansu. The top three provinces with the 
most reduction of figures appeared in Tianjin, Shanghai and Zhejiang. Compared 
with those in 1990, the standardized mortality decreased in all the provinces, 
in 2013.
CONCLUSIONS: The disease burden of stomach cancer in China remained at high 
level in 2013. Compared with those in 1990, the disease burden of stomach cancer 
decreased in 2013. The standardized mortality of stomach cancer in all the 
provinces had decreased but the provincial differences still existed.

OBJECTIVE: To analyze the disease burden of colorectal cancer in the Chinese 
people in 1990 and 2013.
METHODS: Data from the estimation of 2013 Chinese Sub-national Burden of Disease 
Study was used, to analyze the incidence and mortality of colorectal cancer in 
China, in 1990 and 2013, among all the Chinese people. Data on the years of 
lifte lost due to premature mortality (YLL), years lived with disability (YLD) 
and disability-adjusted life years (DALY) of colorectal cancer in China, in 1990 
and 2013 was also used. Related death rates, DALY and DALY rates were compared.
RESULTS: The standardized incidence rate of colorectal cancer among Chinese 
people increased by 66.83% from 12.15/100 000 in 1990 to 20.27/100 000 in 2013 
(72.82% for men and 55.26% for women). The standardized mortality rate of 
colorectal cancer increased by 4.73% from 10.57/100 000 in 1990 to 11.07/100 000 
in 2013 (with 9.03% increase for men but 3.12% decrease for women). A total 
number of 148 000 people died from colorectal cancer in 2013, with an increase 
of 90.08% (105.36% for men and 72.14% for women) compared with the number of 77 
900, in 1990. Related data on DALY, YLL and YLD due to colorectal cancer 
appeared as 3 331.6 thousand person years, 3 200.7 thousand person years and 
130.9 thousand person years, respectively in 2013, with YLL as the vast majority 
of DALY. Compared with 2 019.1 thousand person years in 1990, DALY showed an 
increase of 65.01% in 2013. However, the standardized DALY rate reduced by 6.00% 
from 238.54/100 000 in 1990 to 224.23/100 000 in 2013. Parameters as the 
mortality rates, DALY and DALY rates appeared all higher in men than in women, 
in every age group.
CONCLUSIONS: The disease burden of colorectal cancer in China remained at high 
levels in 2013. Compared with the data in 1990, the total disease burden on 
colorectal cancer showed an increase while the DALY rate and YLL rate showed a 
decline in 2013.

OBJECTIVE: To analyze the disease burden of thyroid cancer in the Chinese 
population, in 1990 and 2013.
METHODS: Data on China from the Global Burden of Disease 2013 (GBD2013) was used 
to analyze the related parameters as mortality, prevalence,years of life lost 
due to premature mortality (YLL), years lived with disability (YLD) and 
disability-adjusted life years (DALY) of thyroid cancer in China in 1990 and 
2013 among all the Chinese population.
RESULTS: There were 33 939 thyroid cancer patients identified in 2013 (7 146 men 
and 26 793 women), with an increase of 21 898 patients than the number in 1990. 
The incidence rate of thyroid cancer increased by 181.86%. The incidence rates 
of thyroid cancer showed an increase in females but a decrease in males. In 
2013, 4 974 people (2 292 men and 2 682 women) died of thyroid cancer, with an 
increase of 1 810 patients, compared with the figures in 1990. The mortality 
rate of thyroid cancer in 2013 decreased by 14.29%, compared with the figures in 
1990. The mortality rate of thyroid cancer decreased in females while the 
incidence rate in males showed an increase. The incidence rates increased with 
age in females, reaching a peak at the 50-54 years old group. The mortality rate 
of thyroid cancer increased with age. The DALY, YLL and YLD due to thyroid 
cancer appeared as 13.35, 11.42 and 1.93 ten thousand person years, 
respectively, in 2013. Between 1990 to 2013, the age-standardized rates on DALY, 
YLL and YLD decreased from 10.33/100 000 to 8.84/100 000, from 9.60/100 000 to 
7.61/100 000 and increased from 0.72/100 000 to 1.23/100 000, respectively. In 
2013 the top three incidence rates were recorded in Qinghai, Xinjiang and Fujian 
provinces while the lowest was in Tibet. Compared with those in 1990, the 
incidence rates increased in all the provinces except for Tianjin. The top three 
high mortality rates were recorded in Qinghai, Hong Kong and Fujian and the 
lowest was also in Tibet. The mortality rates increased in five provinces.
CONCLUSIONS: Compared with those in 1990, the incidence of thyroid cancer 
increased, but the mortality decreased in 2013. Although significant decrease of 
DALY due to thyroid cancer was seen in 2013, the YLD burden was still 
increasing.

OBJECTIVE: To analyze the disease burden of prostate cancer among men in China 
in 1990 and 2013.
METHODS: Based on the estimation of data in China from the Global Burden of 
Disease 2013 (GBD2013), incidence, mortality, the years of life lost due to 
disability-adjusted life years (DALY), years of life lost due to premature 
mortality (YLL), and years lived with disability (YLD) on prostate cancer for 
men in China in 1990 and 2013, were standardized by the world standard 
population used for GBD2013. Incidence, mortality and the disease burden due to 
prostate cancer in China were analyzed.
RESULTS: The numbers on incidence, deaths, standardized incidence and mortality 
rates on prostate cancer increased rapidly in 2013 were compared with the data 
in 1990. New cases increased by 490.27%, from 13 800 in 1990 to 81 400 in 2013 
while number of deaths increased by 206.86%, from 5 800 to 17 800 and the 
standardized incidence rate increased by 197.54%, from 4.48/100 000 to 13.33/100 
000. The standardized mortality rate increased by 46.9%, from 2.26/100 000 to 
3.32/100 000. The proportion of deaths due to prostate cancer among all the 
cancers of men also increased, from 0.65% to 1.26%. Both incidence and death 
rates increased with age, with the lowest in 0-49 years old and highest in over 
80 years old groups. In 1990 and 2013, the incidence and mortality rates of 
prostate cancer increased in all the age groups, with the highest in 65-69 years 
old (228.65%). The disease burden on prostate cancer in 2013, compared with the 
data in 1990 with DALY, YLL and YLD increased by 30.66, 25.51 and 5.15 ten 
thousand person years, respectively, from 1990 to 2013, with the rates of annual 
increase as 1.05%, 1.04% and 1.07%, respectively. The age-standardized rate of 
DALY, YLL and YLD increased in 2013, compared with the data in 1990 with the 
increasing rate as 1.02%, 1.01% and 1.04%, respectively. The proportion of 
disease burden due to prostate cancer among all the male cancers showed an 
increase. The proportion of DALY and YLL increased by 1.03% and 1.04%, 
respectively. DALY, YLL, YLD and their corresponding rates all increased with 
age, with the lowest seen in the 0-49 year old group and highest in 70-79 year 
old group but with slight decline in the group older than 80 years of age.
CONCLUSIONS: Both the incidence and mortality of prostate cancer showed 
significant increase in China. Prevention and control programs on prostate 
cancer should be strengthened.

OBJECTIVE: To analyze the disease burden of leukemia in the Chinese population, 
in 1990 and 2013.
METHODS: Data related to province-specific disease burden in China was used to 
analyze and compare related parameters as incidence, mortality, the 
disability-adjusted life years (DALY), years of life lost due to premature 
mortality (YLL) and years lived with disability (YLD) on leukemia in China in 
1990 and 2013. Standardized mortality rates of leukemia in each province in 2013 
and the changes since 1990, were described.
RESULTS: In 2013, the standardized incidence and mortality rates of leukemia in 
China were 6.70/100 000 and 4.05/100 000, with reduction of 8.84% and 36.22% 
when compared with those in 1990, respectively. The standardized DALY rate and 
YLL rate appeared as 174.58/100 000 and 170.42/100 000 in 2013, with 44.68% and 
45.32% reduction, respectively, when compared with the figures in 1990. The 
standardized YLD rate of leukemia in 2013 was 4.16/100 000, with an 6.94% 
increase, comparing with that in 1990. Age-specific data showed that the 
proportion of people who died from leukemia among those who died from all the 
cancers was more than 10% in people under 35 years old. DALY rate of leukemia 
was highest among children aged 5 years old and under, which appeared as 
317.61/100 000. Compared with those in 1990, the standardized mortality of 
leukemia appeared decreasing in all the provinces in 2013. The top three 
provinces with the highest standardized mortality of leukemia in 2013 were 
Xinjiang (4.72/100 000), Ningxia (4.56/100 000) and Fujian (4.50/100 000).
CONCLUSIONS: Although the standardized incidence rate, mortality rate, DALY rate 
and YLL rate due to leukemia decreased, YLD rate due to leukemia increased. 
Proportions of children and adolescents who died from leukemia remained high. 
Although the standardized mortalities of leukemia decreased in all the 
provinces, the differences among them still remained.

[Clinical characteristics of male osteoporosis].

[Article in Japanese]

Yamauchi M(1), Sugimoto T(1).

Author information:

As men are less likely than women to develop osteoporosis, male osteoporosis 
remains poorly understood. However, elderly men have a clearly reduced bone 
mineral density and increased risk for fractures. In Japan, one in four patients 
with osteoporosis is male. Male osteoporosis is associated with not only 
reduction in androgen, but also estrogen, and differs from postmenopausal 
osteoporosis in that decreased bone formation is involved and that age-related 
changes in cortical bone structure and perforation of the trabeculae of 
cancellous bone are unlikely to occur. The proportion of secondary osteoporosis 
is higher for men than women;therefore, differential diagnosis is important in 
the diagnosis of male osteoporosis. In addition, it is recommended that bone 
mineral density be measured at the femoral neck or total hip in men. Men have a 
worse prognosis following fractures than women, and management of male 
osteoporosis is highly important for extending healthy life expectancy.

BACKGROUND: By 2050, nearly 70% of the global population is projected to live in 
urban areas. Because the environments we inhabit affect our health, urban and 
transport designs that promote healthy living are needed.
OBJECTIVE: We estimated the number of premature deaths preventable under 
compliance with international exposure recommendations for physical activity 
(PA), air pollution, noise, heat, and access to green spaces.
METHODS: We developed and applied the Urban and TranspOrt Planning Health Impact 
Assessment (UTOPHIA) tool to Barcelona, Spain. Exposure estimates and mortality 
data were available for 1,357,361 residents. We compared recommended with 
current exposure levels. We quantified the associations between exposures and 
mortality and calculated population attributable fractions to estimate the 
number of premature deaths preventable. We also modeled life-expectancy and 
economic impacts.
RESULTS: We estimated that annually, nearly 20% of mortality could be prevented 
if international recommendations for performance of PA; exposure to air 
pollution, noise, and heat; and access to green space were followed. Estimations 
showed that the greatest portion of preventable deaths was attributable to 
increases in PA, followed by reductions of exposure to air pollution, traffic 
noise, and heat. Access to green spaces had smaller effects on mortality. 
Compliance was estimated to increase the average life expectancy by 360 (95% CI: 
219, 493) days and result in economic savings of 9.3 (95% CI: 4.9, 13.2) billion 
EUR/year.
CONCLUSIONS: PA factors and environmental exposures can be modified by changes 
in urban and transport planning. We emphasize the need for a) the reduction of 
motorized traffic through the promotion of active and public transport and b) 
the provision of green infrastructure, both of which are suggested to provide 
opportunities for PA and for mitigation of air pollution, noise, and heat.

BACKGROUND: Trauma centers are seeing an increasing number of geriatric patients 
that are more susceptible to injuries even from relatively minor insults such as 
a ground level fall (GLF). As life expectancy increases, people are living in 
the geriatric age bracket for decades and often use anticoagulation agents for 
various comorbidities. We hypothesize that this patient population is not 
homogenous and we investigated the injury patterns and outcomes after GLF as a 
function of age and anticoagulation use. We also sought to identify injury 
patterns and patient characteristics of GLF patients.
METHODS: A retrospective review of a Level I trauma center's database identified 
all adult (age>18) trauma patients admitted after GLFs between 1/2003 and 
12/2013. Demographics, injury patterns, antiplatelet use, anticoagulation use 
(including warfarin, enoxaparin, and rivaroxaban) and outcomes were abstracted.
RESULTS: The cohort included 5088 patients. 3990 patients were >60years and 
38.2% were male. With each decade, although the mean ISS did not considerably 
change (range 7.0-8.6), mortality increased (0.9% at <60years vs. 5.5% at 
>90years), and the likelihood of home discharge decreased dramatically (73.7% at 
<60years vs. 18.2% at >90years). Abdominal solid organ injuries were rare 
(0.8%). Age was associated with an increased incidence of cervical spine 
(p=0.002), rib (p=0.009) and pelvic fractures (p<0.001). Only aspirin use was 
significantly associated with intracranial bleed (p=0.001). Aspirin (p=0.049) or 
warfarin (p<0.001) use was associated with increased overall mortality.
CONCLUSION: GLF patients are not homogenous as certain injury patterns change 
with increasing age. Aspirin use was associated with an increased incidence of 
intracranial bleeds, whereas other antiplatelet or anticoagulation agents were 
not. GLF is also associated with significant morbidity and mortality that 
increases dramatically with age. Both aspirin and warfarin are independently 
associated with increased mortality. These patient differences have implications 
for their evaluation and management.

Thymus is an immunoendocrine organ, the hormones of which mainly influence its 
own lymphatic elements. It has a central role in the immune system, the neonatal 
removal causes the collapse of immune system and the whole organism. The thymic 
nurse cells select the bone marrow originated lymphocytes and destroy the 
autoreactive ones, while thymus originated Treg cells suppress the autoreactive 
cells in the periphery. The involution of the organ starts after birth, however, 
this truly happens in the end of puberty only, as before this it is 
overcompensated by developmental processes. From the end of adolescence the 
involution allows the life, proliferation and enhanced functioning of some 
autoreactive cells, which gradually wear down the cells and intercellular 
materials, causing the aging. The enhanced and mass function of autoreactive 
cells lead to the autoimmune diseases and natural death. This means that the 
involution of thymus is not a part of the organismic involution, but an 
originator of it, which is manifested in the lifespan-pacemaker function. Thus, 
aging can be conceptualized as a thymus-commanded slow autoimmune process. The 
neonatal removal of pineal gland leads to the complete destruction of the thymus 
and the crashing down of the immune system, as well as to wasting disease. The 
involution of the pineal and thymus runs parallel, because the two organs form a 
functional unit. It is probable that the pineal gland is responsible for the 
involution of thymus and also regulates its lifespan determining role. However, 
the data reviewed here do not prove the exclusive role of the pineal-thymus 
system in the regulation of aging and lifespan, but only call attention to such 
possibility.

Mitral regurgitation (MR) is the most common valvular heart disease in the 
Western world. The MR can be either organic (mainly degenerative in Western 
countries) or functional (secondary to left ventricular remodeling in the 
context of ischemic or idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy). Degenerative and 
functional MR are completely different disease entities that pose specific 
decision-making problems and require different management. The natural history 
of severe degenerative MR is clearly unfavorable. However, timely and effective 
correction of degenerative MR is associated with a normalization of life 
expectancy. By contrast, the prognostic impact of the correction of functional 
MR is still debated and controversial. In this review, we discuss the optimal
