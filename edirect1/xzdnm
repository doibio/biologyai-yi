To the authors' knowledge, no study has been conducted on life expectancy for 
aged care facility residents with hip fracture. We assessed life expectancy of 
240 residents of aged care facilities in Australia who experienced recent hip 
fracture treated with surgery. 149 deaths occurred over a mean follow-up of 
1.2 years. Being female and having better cognition were associated with longer 
life expectancy. Increased age was associated with shorter life expectancy. The 
cumulative mortality rate within three months after hip fracture was 25.0% while 
the cumulative mortality rate for the whole study period was 62.1%. Life 
expectancy was 8.2 years, 4.8 years and 2.8 years for 70, 80 and 90-years old 
female patients. Life expectancy was 3.8 years, 2.2 years and 1.3 years for 70, 
80 and 90 years old male patients, respectively. In conclusion, age, gender and 
cognition level were associated with life expectancy of hip fracture patients 
living in aged care facilities and their life expectancy was much shorter than 
that of the general Australian population.

Obesity associates with reduced life expectancy, type 2 diabetes, hypertension 
and cardiovascular disease, and is characterized by chronic inflammation. 
Phosphorylcholine (PC) is an epitope on oxidized low-density lipoprotein, dead 
cells and some microorganisms. Antibodies against PC (anti-PC) have 
anti-inflammatory properties. Here, we explored the role of anti-PC in 
hospitalized versus non-hospitalized obese. One-hundred-and-twenty-eight obese 
(BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2) individuals (59.8 (± 5.5) years, 53.9% women) from the Malmö 
Diet and Cancer Cardiovascular Cohort were examined and IgM, IgG1 and IgG2 
anti-PC were analyzed by ELISA. Individuals with at least one recorded history 
of hospitalization prior to study baseline were considered hospitalized obese 
(HO). Associations between IgM, IgG1 and IgG2 anti-PC and HO 
(n = 32)/non-hospitalized obese (NHO) (n = 96), but also with metabolic syndrome 
and diabetes were analysed using logistic regressions. Both IgM and IgG1 anti-PC 
were inversely associated with HO, also after controlling for age and sex. When 
further adjusted for waist circumference, systolic blood pressure, glucose 
levels and smoking status, only IgG1 anti-PC remained significantly associated 
with HO. In multivariate models, each 1 standard deviation of increment in 
anti-PC IgG1 levels was inversely associated with prevalence of HO (odds ratio 
0.57; CI 95% 0.33-0.98; p = 0.044). IgG2 anti-PC did not show any associations 
with HO. Low levels of IgM and IgG1 anti-PC are associated with higher risk of 
being a HO individual independent of sex and age, IgG1 anti-PC also 
independently of diabetes and metabolic syndrome. The anti-inflammatory 
properties of these antibodies may be related to inflammation in obesity and its 
complications.

The newly emerging and re-emerging of viral contagion in the present scenario 
are of more extensive health concern. After a long calm of many years, an 
unexpected eruption of the Cat Que Virus in China is a source of our concern. 
Cat Que Virus is an Arbovirus and belongs to the Simbu serogroup of the 
Orthobunyavirus genus of the Bunyaviridae family. The Simbu serogroup is an 
extremely diverse group of Arbovirus. The arboviruses are causing the infection 
in multiple hosts including humans and various livestock. They can cause mild to 
life-threatening infections. Arboviruses expand their spectrum and are more 
observable in recent times. Human actions have the most significant geophysical 
impact on the environment. Changes in rainfall patterns, floods, and the risk of 
extreme weather events are all consequences of climate change. These events may 
be connected to the extension of permissive vectors, geographic ranges, and 
therefore provide more chance of growth and spread of potential vector. 
Arboviruses are responsible for the health hazard to millions of people 
globally. It is critical to concentrate research and surveillance on these 
emerging and re-emerging viruses, particularly arthropod-borne viral infections. 
The appropriate research and surveillance on them will help us for the 
development of effective control and treatment strategies and also reduce health 
problems. The present review summarizes the current broad outline of discovery, 
evolution and dispersal of this unknown virus.

Adults with serious mental illness commonly experience comorbid chronic physical 
conditions and experience a reduced life expectancy of 10-25 years compared to 
the general population (Saha et al. in Arch Gen Psychiatry 
64(10):1123-31.  2007; Hayes et al. in Acta Psychiatr Scand 131(6):417-25. 2015; 
Walker et al. in JAMA Psychiatry 72(4):334-41. 2015). Dimensions of personal 
recovery may have real-world implications that extend beyond functional and 
mental health outcomes to impact the self-directed health and wellness of adults 
with serious mental illness. This study examined the predictive utility of the 
Recovery Assessment Scale with respect to medical self-efficacy, 
self-management, psychiatric symptoms, and community functioning for adults with 
serious mental illness. Data were derived from a secondary analysis of baseline 
and 10-month data collected from a randomized control trial with adults aged 18 
years and older with a diagnosis of bipolar disorder, schizoaffective disorder, 
schizophrenia, or major depressive disorder (N=56). A linear regression was 
conducted to examine the predictive value of total baseline RAS scores on 
self-efficacy at 10 months while controlling for study group. This model 
significantly predicted self-efficacy (F (2, 53) = 13.28, p < .001) and 
accounted for 36.1% of the variance. Total baseline RAS scores significantly 
predicted self-efficacy (β = 059, p < .001); specifically, higher baseline RAS 
scores were associated with greater self-efficacy. A greater degree of recovery 
may facilitate greater medical self-efficacy in managing chronic disease in 
people diagnosed with a serious mental illness. Future intervention approaches 
may consider recovery-focused therapeutic targets such as peer support to 
promote self-efficacy to manage chronic diseases in people with serious mental 
illness.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of durvalumab in 
post-chemoradiotherapy patients with unresectable stage III NSCLC from the 
Chinese healthcare system perspective.
METHODS: The study developed a five-health state Markov model to evaluate the 
cost-effectiveness of durvalumab consolidation therapy in post-chemoradiotherapy 
patients based on the PACIFIC clinical trial. Sensitivity and scenario analyses 
were performed to evaluate the model uncertainty.
RESULTS: Durvalumab consolidation therapy provided an additional 1.22 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), with an incremental cost of $24,397 
compared to no consolidation therapy in unselected patients. Durvalumab 
consolidation therapy was cost-effective as it yielded an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $20,000 per QALY gained at a 
willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of $31,494 per QALY. In the patient subgroup 
with PD-L1-expressing tumors (≥1%), durvalumab was associated with an ICER of 
$33,058/QALY, resulting in a slight skewing away from the given 
cost-effectiveness threshold. The sensitivity analysis showed that ICERs were 
most sensitive to the cost of durvalumab, the cost of pembrolizumab, and the 
body weight of patients, regardless of PD-L1 expression selection.
CONCLUSION: Durvalumab consolidation therapy is likely to be cost-effective in 
China, which indicates that expensive immunotherapies can gain clinical benefits 
at a justifiable cost in developing countries as well.

Light quantity and quality affect many aspects of plant growth and development. 
However, few reports have addressed the molecular connections between seed oil 
accumulation and light conditions, especially dense shade. Shade-avoiding plants 
can redirect plant resources into extension growth at the expense of leaf and 
root expansion in an attempt to reach areas containing richer light. Here, we 
report that tung tree seed oil accumulation is suppressed by dense shade during 
the rapid oil accumulation phase. Transcriptome analysis confirmed that oil 
accumulation suppression due to dense shade was attributed to reduced expression 
of fatty acid and triacylglycerol biosynthesis-related genes. Through weighted 
gene co-expression network analysis, we identified 32 core transcription factors 
(TFs) specifically upregulated in densely shaded seeds during the rapid oil 
accumulation period. Among these, VfHB21, a class I homeodomain leucine zipper 
TF, was shown to suppress expression of FAD2 and FADX, two key genes related to 
α-eleostearic acid, by directly binding to HD-ZIP I/II motifs in their 
respective promoter regions. VfHB21 also binds to similar motifs in the 
promoters of VfWRI1 and VfDGAT2, two additional key seed lipid 
regulatory/biosynthetic genes. Functional conservation of HB21 during plant 
evolution was demonstrated by the fact that AtWRI1, AtSAD1, and AtFAD2 were 
downregulated in VfHB21-overexpressor lines of transgenic Arabidopsis, with 
concomitant seed oil reduction, and the fact that AtHB21 expression also was 
induced by shade. This study reveals some of the regulatory mechanisms that 
specifically control tung tree seed oil biosynthesis and more broadly regulate 
plant storage carbon partitioning in response to dense shade conditions.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Endovascular treatment for acute ischemic stroke has 
been proven clinically effective, but evidence of the cost-effectiveness based 
on real-world data is scarce. The aim of this study was to assess whether 
endovascular therapy plus usual care is cost-effective in comparison to usual 
care alone in acute ischemic stroke patients.
METHODS: An economic evaluation was performed from a societal perspective with a 
2-year time horizon. Empirical data on health outcomes and the use of resources 
following endovascular treatment were gathered parallel to the MR CLEAN trial 
(Multicenter Randomized Clinical Trial of Endovascular Treatment for Acute 
Ischemic Stroke in the Netherlands) and its 2-year follow-up study. Incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated as the extra costs per additional 
patient with functional independence (modified Rankin Scale score 0-2) and the 
extra cost per quality-adjusted life year gained.
RESULTS: The mean costs per patient in the intervention group were $126 494 
versus $143 331 in the control group (mean difference, -$16 839 [95% CI, 
-$38 113 to $5456]). Compared with patients in the control group, more patients 
in the intervention group achieved functional independence, 37.2% versus 23.9% 
(absolute difference, 13.3% [95% CI, 4.0%-22.0%]) and they generated more 
quality-adjusted life years, 0.99 versus 0.83 (mean difference of 0.16 [95% CI, 
0.04-0.29]). Endovascular treatment dominated standard treatment with $18 233 
saved per extra patient with a good outcome and $105 869 saved per additional 
quality-adjusted life year.
CONCLUSIONS: Endovascular treatment added to usual care is clinically effective, 
and cost saving in comparison to usual care alone in patients with acute 
ischemic stroke. Registration: URL: https://www.trialregister.nl/trial/695;

BACKGROUND: Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is a sleep-related breathing disorder 
characterised by the repeated episodic collapse of the upper airway during 
sleep, resulting in sleep deprivation, giving rise to apnoeas and hypopnoeas. 
Based on the severity of OSA, there are two primary treatment modalities, 
continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and mandibular advancement appliances 
(MAA); both are adherence-dependent. MAA is offered to those with mild to 
moderate OSA and is prescribed as an alternative to patients intolerable to 
CPAP. However, adherence to MAA treatment is variable and declines over time. 
Hence, the current study aims to assess the effectiveness of the stage-matched 
intervention, the Health Action Process Approach (HAPA), on adherence to MAA in 
patients with OSA.
METHODS: A single-centre randomised clinical trial will be undertaken at Bart's 
Health NHS Trust. Fifty-six participants with newly diagnosed OSA are planned to 
be enrolled in the study and randomised to intervention care (IC) and 
standardised care (SC) groups. Participants in the SC group will receive routine 
care whilst participants in the IC group will receive the stage-matched 
intervention, developed using the HAPA model. Data indicating MAA adherence will 
be collected both objectively and subjectively, from micro-sensors embedded in 
the MAA design and sleep diaries, respectively at 3, 6, 18 and 36 months. In 
addition, a range of questionnaires designed to assess risk perception, outcome 
expectancy, and self-efficacy (SEMSA) and quality of sleep (PSQI and ESS) and 
life (EQ-5DL), socio-economic and social support scales will be used.
DISCUSSION: The currently available treatments for obstructive sleep apnoea 
depend entirely on the patient's acceptance and use. There are several factors 
that affect cooperation and wear for example patients' awareness of their 
condition, social support and psychological behaviour. In addition, mood, such 
as anxiety, stress, and depression, may affect wear. At the same time, we know 
that interventions involving more education and behaviour approaches can help 
patients adapt more easily to some treatments. As a result, the present trial 
aims to explore the potential role of these factors to maximise treatment 
success and minimise side effects.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a rare 
progressive disease that is often diagnosed in early childhood and leads to 
considerably reduced life expectancy; because of its rarity, research literature 
and patient numbers are limited. To fully characterize the natural history, it 
is crucial to obtain appropriate estimates of the life expectancy and mortality 
rates of patients with DMD.
METHODS: A systematic review of the published literature on mortality in DMD up 
to July 2020 was undertaken, specifically focusing on publications in which 
Kaplan-Meier (KM) survival curves with age as a timescale were presented. These 
were digitized, and individual patient data (IPD) were reconstructed. The pooled 
IPD were analyzed with the KM estimator and parametric survival analysis models. 
Estimates were also stratified by birth cohort.
RESULTS: Of 1,177 articles identified, 14 publications met the inclusion 
criteria and provided data on 2,283 patients, of whom 1,049 had died. Median 
life expectancy was 22.0 years (95% confidence interval [CI] 21.2, 22.4). 
Analyses stratified by 3 time periods in which patients were born showed 
markedly increased life expectancy in more recent patient populations; patients 
born after 1990 have a median life expectancy of 28.1 years (95% CI 25.1, 30.3).
DISCUSSION: This article presents a full overview of mortality across the 
lifetime of a patient with DMD and highlights recent improvements in survival. 
In the absence of large-scale prospective cohort studies or trials reporting 
mortality data for patients with DMD, extraction of IPD from the literature 
provides a viable alternative to estimating life expectancy for this patient 
population.

BACKGROUND: Life expectancy of patients with multiple myeloma (MM) has increased 
over the past decades, underlining the importance of local tumor control and 
avoidance of dose-dependent side effects of palliative radiotherapy (RT). 
Virtual noncalcium (VNCa) imaging from dual-energy computed tomography (DECT) 
has been suggested to estimate cellularity and metabolic activity of lytic bone 
lesions (LBLs) in MM.
OBJECTIVE: To explore the feasibility of RT response monitoring with 
DECT-derived VNCa attenuation measurements in MM.
METHODS: Thirty-three patients with 85 LBLs that had been irradiated and 85 
paired non-irradiated LBLs from the same patients were included in this 
retrospective study. Irradiated and non-irradiated LBLs were measured by 
circular regions of interest (ROIs) on conventional and VNCa images in a total 
of 216 follow-up measurements (48 before and 168 after RT). Follow-ups were 
rated as therapy response, stable disease, or local progression according to the 
MD Anderson criteria. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was 
performed to discriminate irradiated vs. non-irradiated and locally progressive 
vs. stable/responsive LBLs using absolute attenuation post-irradiation and 
percentage attenuation change for patients with pre-irradiation DECT, if 
available.
RESULTS: Attenuation of LBLs decreased after RT depending on the time that had 
passed after irradiation [absolute thresholds for identification of irradiated 
LBLs 30.5-70.0 HU [best area under the curve [AUC] 0.75 (0.59-0.91)] and -77.0 
to -22.5 HU [best AUC 0.85 (0.65-1.00)]/-50% and -117% to -167% proportional 
change of attenuation on conventional and VNCa images, respectively]. VNCa CT 
was significantly superior for identification of RT effects in LBLs with higher 
calcium content [best VNCa AUC 0.96 (0.91-1.00), best conventional CT AUC 0.64 
(0.45-0.83)]. Thresholds for early identification of local irradiation failure 
were >20.5 HU on conventional CT [AUC 0.78 (0.68-0.88)] and >-27 HU on VNCa CT 
[AUC 0.83 (0.70-0.96)].
CONCLUSION: Therapy response of LBLs after RT can be monitored by VNCa imaging 
based on regular myeloma scans, which yields potential for optimizing the 
lesion-specific radiation dose for local tumor control. Decreasing attenuation 
indicates RT response, while above threshold attenuation of LBLs precedes local 
irradiation failure.

BACKGROUND: Advanced age is a major risk factor for the development of many 
diseases including those affecting the central nervous system. Wild-type 
isocitrate dehydrogenase glioblastoma (IDHwt GBM) is the most common primary 
malignant brain cancer and accounts for ≥90% of all adult GBM diagnoses. 
Patients with IDHwt GBM have a median age of diagnosis at 68-70 years of age, 
and increasing age is associated with an increasingly worse prognosis for 
patients with this type of GBM.
METHODS: The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results, The Cancer Genome 
Atlas, and the Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas databases were analyzed for mortality 
indices. Meta-analysis of 80 clinical trials was evaluated for log hazard ratio 
for aging to tumor survivorship.
RESULTS: Despite significant advances in the understanding of intratumoral 
genetic alterations, molecular characteristics of tumor microenvironments, and 
relationships between tumor molecular characteristics and the use of targeted 
therapeutics, life expectancy for older adults with GBM has yet to improve.
CONCLUSIONS: Based upon the results of our analysis, we propose that 
age-dependent factors that are yet to be fully elucidated, contribute to IDHwt 
GBM patient outcomes.

OBJECTIVES: The Kidney Team at Home program is an educational intervention aimed 
at patients with chronic kidney disease to assist them in their choice for 
kidney replacement therapy. Previous studies have shown that the intervention 
results in an increase in knowledge and communication on kidney replacement 
therapy, and eventually in an increase in the number of living donor kidney 
transplantations. The study assesses the cost-effectiveness of the intervention 
compared to standard care.
METHODS: A dynamic probabilistic Markov model was used to estimate the monetary 
and health benefits of the intervention in The Netherlands over 10 years. Data 
on costs and health-related quality of life were derived from the literature. 
Transition probabilities, prevalence, and incidence rates were calculated using 
a large national database. An optimistic and a pessimistic implementation 
scenario were compared to a base case scenario with standard care.
RESULTS: In both the optimistic and pessimistic scenario, the intervention is 
cost-effective and dominant compared to standard care: savings were €108,681,985 
and €51,770,060 and the benefits were 1382 and 695 QALYs, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The superior cost-effectiveness of the intervention is caused by 
the superior health effects and the reduction of costs associated with 
transplantation, and the relatively small incremental costs of the intervention. 
The favorable findings of this implementation project resulted in national 
uptake of the intervention in The Netherlands as of 2021. This is the first time 
a psychosocial intervention has been implemented as part of standard care in a 
kidney replacement therapy program worldwide.

Assessment of Mortality Rate in 10 Years and the Associated Risk Factors in 
Schizophrenia.

[Article in English, Turkish]

Yaşar H, Yildiz M.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to explore the mortality rate and the 
associated risks factors in patients with schizophrenia during a10- year follow 
up period.
METHOD: We searched the records of patients with schizophrenia receiving 
treatment as outpatients and/or inpatients in the psychiatric clinic of a 
university hospital between 2004 and 2008 and determine the survival of these 
patients by the end of 2018. The results were compared with the all cause 
mortality rate in the general population during the same period. Also, the risk 
factors affecting the mortality rate among the patients were investigated.
RESULTS: Out of a total of 626 registered patients 506 were included in the 
study. The mortality rate within 10 years was found to be 10.6%, with a mean age 
of 53.1 years at the time of death. The overall expected life expectancy was 
73.4 years; varying between 66.6 years among the males and 77.6 years among the 
females; and 64.7 and 76.5 years among smokers and non-smokers, respectively. 
The overall standardized mortality rate (SMR) was 3.7, being 3.9 among the males 
and 3.3 among the females. The risk factors that were associated with the death 
were old age, male gender, smoking, not working, and early age of disease onset.
CONCLUSION: Smoking is a significant risk factor for mortality. Giving priority 
to programs for stopping smoking, and supporting rehabilitation services that 
enables patients to get involved in could help reducing the mortality risk.

[Lifestyle interventions for patients with personality disorder].

[Article in Dutch]

Kooiman CG.

It has been known for some time that patients with severe mental disorders often 
suffer from somatic comorbidity and that they have a shorter life expectancy. 
However, also patients with personality pathology often suffer from a poorer 
somatic health associated with a shorter life expectancy. In daily practice a 
poor somatic condition in these patients seems often due to a maladaptive life 
style. Moreover, clinical evidence suggests that a maladaptive life style 
hinders a good outcome of the (psychotherapeutic) treatment. In this article I 
present a brief review of the literature, describe three fictitious cases and 
give suggestions how to diagnose and intervene on a maladaptive life style. One 
had to take in account that a maladaptive life style often is used as a coping 
mechanism to combat one's difficulties.

[The treatment for Fabry disease: focus on agalsidase alpha and beta].

Fabry disease (FD) is an X-linked lysosomal storage disorder resulting from the 
deficiency of the hydrolytic enzyme α-galactosidase A (α-Gal A), with consequent 
accumulation of globotrioasoylceramide in cells and tissues of the body, 
resulting in a multi-system pathology. Classically affected hemizygous males may 
display all the characteristic neurological (pain), cutaneous (angiokeratoma), 
renal (proteinuria, kidney failure), cardiovascular (cardiomyopathy, 
arrhythmia), and cerebrovascular (transient ischemic attacks, strokes) signs of 
the disease, while heterozygous females have symptoms ranging from very mild to 
severe. End-stage renal disease and cardiovascular or cerebrovascular 
complications limit life-expectancy of untreated patients. Demonstration of 
α-Gal A deficiency is the definitive method for the diagnosis of hemizygous 
males, while it's often inconclusive due to random X-chromosomal inactivation so 
that molecular testing (genotyping) of females is mandatory. The treatment 
options for FD are enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), and the oral 
pharmacological chaperone migalastat. Two different products, agalsidase alfa 
and agalsidase beta, have been commercially available in Europe for 20 years and 
they are both indicated for long-term ERT. In fact, clinical trials, 
observational studies and registry data have provided abundant evidence for the 
safety and efficacy of ERT in improving symptoms and disease progression. 
Agalsidase alpha and beta are two almost identical recombinant proteins although 
they are used clinically with a different dosage regimen. In this chapter we aim 
to clarify the differences between the two ERTs and how these can affect the 
pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) characteristics and ultimately the 
risk/benefit profile. The chaperone migalastat, available in Europe since 2016, 
is the only oral treatment for FD, and acts stabilizing specific mutant forms of 
α-Gal, defined "amenable" to migalastat. A multitude of therapies are now under 
investigation in various phases of clinical trials. These include pegylated form 
of α-Gal (pegunigalsidase alpha), gene therapy (both in-vivo and ex-vivo 
methods), mRNA therapy (inducing production of α-Gal) and substrate reduction 
therapy (inhibitors of glucosylceramide synthase leading to reduction of Gb-3).

Aging is the leading cause of human morbidity and death worldwide. 
Pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) is a water-soluble vitamin-like compound that has 
strong anti-oxidant capacity. Beneficial effects of PQQ on lifespan have been 
discovered in the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans), yet the 
underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In the current study, we hypothesized that 
the longevity-extending effect of PQQ may be linked to autophagy and 
insulin/IGF1 signaling (IIS) in C. elegans. Our data demonstrate that PQQ at a 
concentration of 1 mM maximally extended the mean life of C. elegans by 33.1%. 
PQQ increased locomotion and anti-stress ability, and reduced fat accumulation 
and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. There was no significant lifespan 
extension in PQQ-treated daf-16, daf-2, and bec-1 mutants, suggesting that these 
IIS- and autophagy-related genes may mediate the anti-aging effects of the PQQ. 
Furthermore, PQQ raised mRNA expression and the nuclear localization of the 
pivotal transcription factor daf-16, and then activated its downstream targets 
sod-3, clt-1, and hsp16.2. Enhanced activity of the autophagy pathway was also 
observed in PQQ-fed C. elegans, as evidenced by increased expression of the key 
autophagy genes including lgg-1, and bec-1, and also by an increase in the 
GFP::LGG-1 puncta. Inactivation of the IIS pathway-related genes daf-2 or daf-16 
by RNAi partially blocked the increase in autophagy activity caused by PQQ 
treatment, suggesting that autophagy may be regulated by IIS. This study 
demonstrates that anti-aging properties of PQQ, in the C. elegans model, may be 
mediated via the IIS pathway and autophagy.

Importance: Septorhinoplasties are performed for functional, aesthetic, or a 
combination of these indications. As a nonvital intervention, cost-effectiveness 
may be questioned. Objective: To determine the cost-effectiveness of 
septorhinoplasty. Design and Setting: The literature was reviewed for revision 
rates (RRs) and health utility values (HUVs) for both septorhinoplasty and 
revision septorhinoplasty. Age-specific mortality rates and life expectancies 
were used. Costs were gathered from international settings and analyzed in an 
adapted Markov model. Intervention: Septorhinoplasty versus no intervention. 
Main Outcomes and Measures: Cost-efficiency was calculated for different 
willingness-to-pay thresholds in a probabilistic sensitivity analysis. The 
effect of different parameters (costs, RRs, HUVs, age, gender) were reviewed and 
addressed in a sensitivity analysis for an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
(ICER) willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000/quality-adjusted life year 
(QALY). Results: The ICER for septorhinoplasty for a 40-year-old woman ranges 
from $1216 to $3509/QALY (depending on the country) in comparison with no 
intervention. Septorhinoplasty is cost-effective in 98.8% (for a $50,000/QALY 
threshold). The sensitivity analysis showed high robustness of the 
cost-effectiveness for various scenarios. Conclusions and Relevance: 
Septorhinoplasty is a highly cost-effective treatment.

Cancer and Infectious Diseases Center, Komagome Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.

BACKGROUND: Stereotactic body radiotherapy is a new treatment modality for long 
bone metastasis and has not been discussed in literature. We aimed to clarify 
stereotactic body radiotherapy outcomes for long bone metastases.
METHODS: Data of patients receiving stereotactic body radiotherapy for long bone 
metastases (July 2016-November 2020) were retrospectively reviewed. The 
prescribed dose was 30 or 35 Gy in five fractions. The endpoints were local 
failure and adverse effects. Local failure was defined as radiological tumor 
growth within the irradiation field. Adverse effects were evaluated according to 
the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, 
version 5.
RESULTS: Nineteen osseous lesions in 17 patients were assessed. The target 
lesions included 13 femoral, 4 humeral and 2 radial lesions. The median 
follow-up duration was 14 (range, 3-62) months. The 12- and 18-month local 
failure rates were 0 and 11%, respectively. Following 2 and 46 months of 
stereotactic body radiotherapy, two lesions (11%) resulted in painful femoral 
fractures (grade 3). Both patients underwent bipolar hip arthroplasty and could 
walk normally after surgery. In the late phase, one patient developed 
radiculopathy (almost complete paralysis of grasp) and another developed grade 2 
limb edema. Other grade 2 or more severe acute and late toxicities were not 
observed during the follow-up period.
CONCLUSIONS: Stereotactic body radiotherapy for long bone metastases achieved 
excellent local control and caused two femoral fractures. We argue that 
stereotactic body radiotherapy for curative intent should not be contraindicated 
in long bone oligometastasis because fractures do not directly contribute to 
life expectancy.

AIMS: To perform an economic evaluation of guided and unguided internet-based 
interventions to reduce problematic alcohol consumption in employees compared 
with a waiting-list control condition (WLC) with unrestricted access to 
treatment-as-usual.
DESIGN: A cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) and cost-utility analysis (CUA) from 
a societal and a cost-benefit analysis from the employer's perspective with a 
6-month time horizon.
SETTING: Open recruitment in the German working population.
PARTICIPANTS: Employees (178 males, 256 females, mean age 47 years) consuming at 
least 14 (women) or 21 (men) standard units of alcohol (SUAs) per week and 
scoring ≥ 8 (men) or 6 (women) on the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test.
MEASUREMENTS: On-line questionnaires administered to assess SUAs and assess 
quality of life (AQoL-8D) and resource use. Outcome measure was responder 
(≤ 14/≤ 21 SUAs) for the CEA and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) for the 
CUA. Net benefit regression was used to estimate cost-effectiveness for each 
study arm. Bootstrapping and sensitivity analyses were performed to account for 
uncertainty.
INTERVENTIONS: Five weekly modules including personalized normative feedback, 
motivational interviewing, goal setting, problem-solving and emotion regulation, 
provided with adherence-focused guidance [n = 142; responders: n = 73 (51.4%); 
QALYs = 0.364, standard error (SE) = 0.006] or without guidance [n = 146; n = 66 
(45.2%); 0.359, 0.007]. Controls were on a waiting-list [n = 144; n = 38 
(26.4%); 0.342, 0.007].
FINDINGS: From a societal perspective, the guided intervention had a probability 
of 55% (54%) of being the most efficient strategy at a willingness-to-pay (WTP) 
of €0 per responder (QALY) gained, compared with the unguided intervention and 
the control condition. At a WTP of €20 000 per QALY gained, the probability was 
78%. From an employer's perspective, the guided intervention had a higher 
probability of a positive return on investment (81%) compared with the unguided 
intervention (58%).
CONCLUSION: A guided internet-based intervention to reduce problematic alcohol 
consumption in employees appears to be both cost-beneficial and cost-effective.
