Aging is the primary risk factor for cognitive decline, an emerging health 
threat to aging societies worldwide. Whether anti-aging factors such as klotho 
can counteract cognitive decline is unknown. We show that a lifespan-extending 
variant of the human KLOTHO gene, KL-VS, is associated with enhanced cognition 
in heterozygous carriers. Because this allele increased klotho levels in serum, 
we analyzed transgenic mice with systemic overexpression of klotho. They 
performed better than controls in multiple tests of learning and memory. 
Elevating klotho in mice also enhanced long-term potentiation, a form of 
synaptic plasticity, and enriched synaptic GluN2B, an N-methyl-D-aspartate 
receptor (NMDAR) subunit with key functions in learning and memory. Blockade of 
GluN2B abolished klotho-mediated effects. Surprisingly, klotho effects were 
evident also in young mice and did not correlate with age in humans, suggesting 
independence from the aging process. Augmenting klotho or its effects may 
enhance cognition and counteract cognitive deficits at different life stages.

The current research examined infants' ability to generalize information about 
the nonobvious properties of objects depicted in picture books to their 
real-world referents. Infants aged 13, 15, and 18 months (N=135) were shown a 
series of pictures depicting an adult acting on a novel object to elicit a 
nonobvious property of that object. Infants were subsequently tested on their 
extension of the nonobvious property to the real-world object depicted in the 
book and their generalization of this property to a different color exemplar of 
the depicted object. Results indicated that, regardless of age, infants expected 
the real-world objects to have the nonobvious property, as indicated by their 
attempts to elicit this property with these objects. These findings indicate 
that early in their second year of life, infants are beginning to make inductive 
inferences about nonobvious object properties based on information provided in 
pictures.

The causes of cross-national differences in population health are subject for 
intense discussion, often focusing on the role of structural economic factors. 
Although population health is widely believed to reflect the living conditions 
in society, surprisingly few comparative studies systematically assess policy 
impacts of anti-poverty programs. In this paper we estimate the influence of 
minimum income benefits on mortality using international data on benefit levels 
in 18 countries 1990-2009. Included are all major non-contributory benefits that 
low-income households may receive. Our analyses, based on fixed effects pooled 
time-series regression, show that minimum income benefits improve mortality, 
measured in terms of age-standardized death rates and life expectancy. The 
results on country-level links between minimum income benefits and mortality are 
remarkably robust in terms of measured confounding effects.

Fibigerstræde 11, 68, Aalborg 9220, Denmark. celga@business.aau.dk.

INTRODUCTION: Approximately 5,000 Danish patients are being treated for 
end-stage renal disease, for which the two treatment options are dialysis and 
transplantation. The objective of this study was to estimate the 
cost-effectiveness of kidney transplantation versus dialysis from a public 
health-care perspective.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A cost-utility analysis was conducted using a decision 
analytic model. The model was designed as a Markov model in which all relevant 
costs and effects of the two alternative treatments were included. Deterministic 
data were used alongside the best available evidence from the literature. To 
estimate the overall uncertainty concerning the incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio (ICER), a probabilistic sensitivity analysis with second-order Monte Carlo 
simulations was carried out on a hypothetical cohort of 10,000 patients.
RESULTS: The cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) was 1,032,934 DKK for 
dialysis compared with 810,516 DKK for transplantation. When comparing kidney 
transplantation with dialysis, kidney transplantation was cost-saving and 
resulted in additional QALYs. When taking the overall uncertainty associated 
with the ICER into account, an incremental cost-effectiveness scatter plot 
supported that transplantation was dominating and that the results were robust. 
In addition, a cost-effectiveness acceptability curve showed that 
transplantation had a 99.93% likelihood of being cost-effective at a 
willingness-to-pay value of 0 DKK.
CONCLUSION: The cost-effectiveness ratio was favourable for kidney 
transplantation when compared with dialysis. In view of this, it was concluded 
that transplantation is preferable to dialysis when treating patients with 
end-stage renal disease.

BACKGROUND: With anticonvulsant, anxiolytic, and analgesic properties, 
pregabalin has been evaluated for neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia (FM). These 
chronic conditions diminish patients' quality of life and increase healthcare 
utilization and costs.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the current understanding of economic outcomes associated 
with pregabalin in neuropathic pain and FM.
METHODS: Using keywords related to economic outcomes and pregabalin, we 
systematically searched MEDLINE- and EMBASE-indexed literature and nonindexed 
"grey" literature on neuropathic pain and FM published from March 2001 to 
October 2012. Included studies reported economic findings associated with 
pregabalin.
RESULTS: In the past 11 years, 55 publications assessed the direct costs, 
resource use, or cost-effectiveness of pregabalin for neuropathic pain and FM. 
Studies generally lacked comparability due to heterogeneous patient populations, 
assumptions, time periods, and geographies. In the US, following treatment 
initiation, pregabalin resulted in similar or higher levels of healthcare use 
for FM compared with duloxetine. In contrast, medical costs for neuropathic pain 
did not significantly differ after initiation of pregabalin vs. duloxetine or 
other standard therapies in the US, but in Spain and Sweden, retrospective 
database studies suggested that pregabalin was cost-saving vs. gabapentin. Few 
economic analyses estimated indirect costs.
CONCLUSIONS: Neuropathic pain and FM are associated with high healthcare 
resource use and costs. Economic studies of pregabalin in neuropathic pain and 
FM indicate some results favorable to other forms of care, but heterogeneity 
among study designs and populations hinder comparisons. Future economic analyses 
should aim to address data gaps regarding effects of pregabalin on productivity 
and resource use.

BACKGROUND: Two new therapies for fecal incontinence (FI) are now available: 
non-animal stabilized hyaluronic acid and dextranomer copolymer (NASHA/Dx) and 
sacral nerve stimulation (SNS).
PURPOSE: This study aimed to determine the cost-effectiveness of NASHA/Dx 
compared with SNS and conservative therapy (CT) for the treatment of FI after CT 
failure.
METHODS: Decision tree models with Markov subbranches were developed to compare 
all direct costs and outcomes during a 3-year period from the viewpoint of the 
US third-party payer. Costs (in 2013 US dollars) of devices, medical and 
surgical care, and hospitalization were included. Outcomes included 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and incontinence-free days (IFDs). Both 
costs and outcomes were discounted at an annual rate of 3%. The incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio was calculated for each outcome. One-way and 
probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to examine robustness of 
results and model stability. A budget impact analysis was also undertaken to 
estimate the potential cost and savings of NASHA/Dx for a payer with 1,000,000 
covered lives.
RESULTS: For the 3-year cost-effectiveness models, the expected cost was $9053 
for CT, $14,962 for NASHA/Dx, and $33,201 for SNS. The numbers of QALYs were 
1.769, 1.929, and 2.004, respectively. The numbers of IFDs were 128.8, 267.6, 
and 514.8, respectively. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios per 
additional IFD gained were $42.60 for NASHA/Dx vs CT, $73.76 for SNS vs 
NASHA/Dx, and $62.55 for SNS vs CT. The incremental costs per QALY gained were 
$37,036 for NASHA/Dx vs CT, $244,509 for SNS vs NASHA/Dx, and $103,066 for SNS 
vs CT. The budget impact analysis evaluated the financial effect on the health 
care system of the use of NASHA/Dx and SNS. For the scenarios evaluated, when 
all of the patients receive NASHA/Dx, the net annual effect to the health care 
payer budget ranged from $571,455 to $2,857,275. When all of the patients 
receive SNS, the net annual effect to the health care payer budget ranged from 
$1,959,323 to $9,796,613.
CONCLUSION: Both NASHA/Dx and SNS have produced significant improvements in FI 
symptoms for affected patients. NASHA/Dx is a cost-effective and more efficient 
use of resources for the treatment of FI when compared with SNS. The budget 
impact analysis suggests that although reimbursement for NASHA/Dx treatment 
initially adds costs to the health care system, it is significantly less 
expensive than SNS for patients who are candidates for either treatment.

BACKGROUND: A cancer survivor is defined as anyone who has been diagnosed with 
cancer, from the time of diagnosis through the rest of their life. The purpose 
of this study was to examine whether physical functions, health-related 
outcomes, nutritional status and blood markers in community-dwelling cancer 
survivors aged 75 years and older are different from those who do not have 
cancer
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two hundred seventy-five participants were asked by 
physicians, nurses, and physical therapists, questions regarding cancer history 
in a face-to-face interview. Data were collected for demographic information, 
physical functions, such as handgrip strength, knee extension power, abdominal 
muscle strength, static standing balance, walking speed and the timed-up-and-go 
test, health-related outcomes, nutritional status, and blood markers. The 
measured parameters of survivor diagnosed with cancer were compared with those 
without a history of cancer.
RESULTS: Thirty-seven older adults were previously diagnosed with cancer. Female 
cancer survivors had lower knee extension power (p<0.05), abdominal muscle 
strength (p<0.05), walking speed (p<0.05), timed-up-and-go test score (p<0.05), 
and time to spend on walking per day (p<0.05) than older women without a history 
of cancer. In men, none of the measured parameters were significantly different 
between cancer survivors and older men with no history of cancer.
CONCLUSIONS: The present study shows that partial physical function of women 
cancer survivors aged 75 years and older differs from that in women with no 
history of cancer.

Apart from solving the heavy-atom substructure in proteins and ab initio phasing 
of protein diffraction data at atomic resolution, direct methods have also been 
successfully combined with other protein crystallographic methods in dealing 
with diffraction data far below atomic resolution, leading to significantly 
improved results. In this respect, direct methods provide phase constraints in 
reciprocal space within a dual-space iterative framework rather than solve the 
phase problem independently. Applications of this type of direct methods to 
difficult SAD phasing, model completion and low-resolution phase extension will 
be described in detail.

BACKGROUND: Endovascular intervention has become a frequently used treatment of 
critical limb ischemia (CLI) in recent times. The recent Bypass vs Angioplasty 
in Severe Ischaemia of the Leg (BASIL) trial consensus recommended endovascular 
treatment as a first-line treatment in patients who have a life expectancy that 
was limited to <2 years. Despite these recommendations, there still remains 
limited data available to clinicians when seeking to risk stratify patients who 
present with CLI. The neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) has been suggested to be 
a marker for predicting mortality and patency. This study aimed to investigate 
the use of the NLR as a prognostic marker for primary patency and mortality 
after an infrapopliteal endovascular intervention in patients with CLI.
METHODS: All patients who underwent tibial angioplasty for CLI were 
retrospectively analyzed. Demographics, degrees of stenosis, vessel patency 
rates, mortality, and comorbidities were recorded. NLRs were calculated from 
preoperative blood samples. Primary end points were all-cause mortality, primary 
patency, and amputation-free survival (AFS) within the follow-up period of 12 
months. Multivariate Cox proportional hazard models were used to identify 
independent predictors. Overall survival, AFS, and the probability of a vessel 
remaining patent were evaluated by standard Kaplan-Meier survival curves and 
groups compared by the log-rank test.
RESULTS: Eighty-three patients were monitored for 12 months. Ninety limbs were 
identified, with 104 procedural events and 127 vessels undergoing successful 
angioplasty. The technical success rate was 86%, and patency at 1 year was 19%. 
Survival at 1 year was 76% and AFS was 61%. Patients with a NLR ≥5.25 had an 
increased risk of death (hazard ratio, 1.97; 95% confidence interval, 1.08-3.62; 
P = .03) compared with those with a NLR of <5.25. Furthermore, those with 
lymphocytes counts of <1.5 × 10(9)/L had higher mortality (hazard ratio, 1.88; 
95% confidence interval, 1.02-3.70; P = .045) than those with lymphocyte counts 
>1.5 × 10(9)/L.
CONCLUSIONS: The NLR and absolute lymphocyte counts are potentially valuable 
prognostic indicators for risk stratification of patient's presenting with CLI 
undergoing infrapopliteal angioplasty.

Role of HIV in amyloid metabolism.

Louis, Box 8111, 660 South Euclid Ave, Saint Louis, MO, 63110, USA.

HIV infection has changed from an acute devastating disease to a more chronic 
illness due to combination anti-retroviral treatment (cART). In the cART era, 
the life expectancy of HIV-infected (HIV+) individuals has increased. More 
HIV + individuals are aging with current projections suggesting that 50% of 
HIV + individuals will be over 50 years old by 2015. With advancing age, 
HIV + individuals may be at increased risk of developing other potential 
neurodegenerative disorders [especially Alzheimer's disease (AD)]. Pathology 
studies have shown that HIV increases intra and possibly extracellular amyloid 
beta (Aβ42), a hallmark of AD. We review the synthesis and clearance of Aβ42; 
the effects of HIV on the amyloid pathway; and contrast the impact of AD and HIV 
on Aβ42 metabolism. Biomarker studies (cerebrospinal fluid AB and amyloid 
imaging) in HIV + participants have shown mixed results. CSF Aβ42 has been shown 
to be either normal or diminished in with HIV associated neurocognitive 
disorders (HAND). Amyloid imaging using [(11)C] PiB has also not demonstrated 
increased extracellular amyloid fibrillar deposits in HAND. We further 
demonstrate that Aβ42 deposition is not increased in older HIV + participants 
using [(11)C] PiB amyloid imaging. Together, these results suggest that HIV and 
aging each independently affect Aβ42 deposition with no significant interaction 
present. Older HIV + individuals are probably not at increased risk for 
developing AD. However, future longitudinal studies of older HIV + individuals 
using multiple modalities (including the combination of CSF markers and amyloid 
imaging) are necessary for investigating the effects of HIV on Aβ42 metabolism.

Health system costs by sex, age and proximity to death, and implications for 
estimation of future expenditure.

Blakely T, Atkinson J, Kvizhinadze G, Nghiem N, McLeod H, Wilson N.

AIMS: Health expenditure increases with age, but some of this increase is due to 
costs proximal to death. We used linked health datasets (HealthTracker) to 
determine health expenditure by proximity to death. We then determined the 
impact on future health expenditure projections of accounting for proximity to 
death in costs.
METHODS: 2007 to 2009 national health event data were linked for 
hospitalisations, inpatient procedures, outpatient events, pharmaceuticals, 
laboratory tests, and primary care consultations. Each event was assigned a 
cost. Health expenditure by sex, age and whether in last 6 or 12 months of life 
or not were calculated. Future health expenditure trends were then estimated for 
the Statistics New Zealand median projection population counts, with 2010-12 
mortality rates reducing by 2% per annum into the future.
RESULTS: A total of $8.1, $8.8 and $9.2 billion dollars (inflation-adjusted to 
2011 NZ$) was allocated to individual health events in HealthTracker in 2007, 
2008 and 2009, respectively. Citizen costs for people not within 6 months of 
death ranged from $498 per person-year (10-14 year old females) to $6900 per 
person-year (90-94 year old males). Per person-year costs in the last 6 months 
of life were 10-fold higher on average, being maximal at $30,000 or more among 
infants and the older elderly (80+ years). Similar patterns were apparent for 
costs within 12 months of death. For people hypothetically exposed to these 
2007-09 health system costs over their full life, the cumulative costs for a 
person dying at age 70 years was $113,000, and doubled to $223,000 for a person 
dying at age 90. The proportion of cumulative health expenditure in the last 
year of life declined with increasing age of death: e.g. 24%, 13% and 10% for 
someone aged 40, 70 and 90 respectively. Projections of future health system 
expenditure were overestimated by 2.3% to 3.5% in 2041 when not accounting for 
proximity to death in costs.
CONCLUSIONS: New Zealand is fortunate to have access to rich data on health 
system costs. The age-specific health system costs per citizen we have 
calculated can be used in health expenditure projections, for cost-effectiveness 
analyses, and for considering how public health expenditure is distributed 
across the life course.

Advances in surgical and medical treatment for congenital heart disease have 
resulted in greater life expectancy. As a result, there has been an increase in 
the utilization of cross-sectional imaging for diagnosis and management of 
complex congenital heart disease. This manuscript describes a morphological and 
sequential segmental approach to deciphering the code of complex congenital 
heart defects in cross-sectional imaging, mostly computed tomography. This 
manuscript will review approaches to differentiate types of transposition, the 
anatomic relationships of cardiac structures, and the application of these 
relationships in the description of complex congenital heart disease.

BACKGROUND: Endoscopic surgery is suitable for the transsphenoidal approach; it 
is minimally invasive and provides a well-lit operative field. The endoscopic 
skull base approach through the large opening of the sphenoid sinus through both 
nostrils has extended the surgical indication for various skull base lesions. In 
this study, we describe the efficacy and complications associated with the 
endoscopic skull base approach for extra- or intradural parasellar lesions based 
on our experiences.
METHODS: Seventy-four cases were treated by an endoscopic skull base approach. 
The indications for these procedures included 55 anterior extended approaches, 
10 clival approaches, and 9 cavernous approaches. The operations were performed 
through both the nostrils using a rigid endoscope. After tumor removal, the 
skull base was reconstructed by a multilayered method using a polyglactin acid 
(PGA) sheet.
RESULTS: Gross total resection was achieved in 82% of pituitary adenomas, 68.8% 
of meningiomas, and 60% of craniopharyngiomas in anterior extended approach and 
in 83.3% of chordomas in clival approach, but only in 50% of the tumors in 
cavernous approach. Tumor consistency, adhesion, and/or extension were 
significant limitations. Visual function improvements were achieved in 37 of 41 
(90.2%) cases. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage (9.5%), infections (5.4%), 
neural injuries (4.1%), and vascular injuries (2.7%) were the major 
complications.
CONCLUSIONS: Our experiences show that the endoscopic skull base approach is a 
safe and effective procedure for various parasellar lesions. Selection of 
patients who are unlikely to develop complications seems to be an important 
factor for procedure efficacy and good outcome.

BACKGROUND: Fractures are one of the most costly consequences of falls in 
elderly patients in nursing homes.
OBJECTIVES: To compare the cost-effectiveness of a 'multifactorial fracture 
prevention program' provided by a multidisciplinary team with 'no prevention' in 
newly admitted nursing home residents.
METHODS: We performed a cost-utility analysis using a Markov-based simulation 
model to establish the effectiveness of a multifaceted fall prevention program 
from the perspective of statutory health insurance (SHI) and long-term care 
insurance (LCI). The rate of falls was used to estimate the clinical and 
economic consequences resulting from hip and upper limb fractures. Robustness of 
the results was assessed using deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity 
analyses.
RESULTS: Compared to no prevention a multifactorial prevention program for 
nursing home residents resulted in a cost-effectiveness ratio of 21,353 euro per 
quality-adjusted life-year. The total costs for SHI/LCI would result in 1.7 euro 
million per year. Results proved to be robust following deterministic and 
probabilistic sensitivity analyses.
CONCLUSION: Multifactorial fracture prevention appears to be cost-effective in 
preventing fractures in nursing home residents. Since the results were based on 
the number of falls further research is required to confirm the results.

Prostate cancer is considered a disease of older men (aged >65 years), but today 
over 10% of new diagnoses in the USA occur in young men aged ≤55 years. 
Early-onset prostate cancer, that is prostate cancer diagnosed at age ≤55 years, 
differs from prostate cancer diagnosed at an older age in several ways. Firstly, 
among men with high-grade and advanced-stage prostate cancer, those diagnosed at 
a young age have a higher cause-specific mortality than men diagnosed at an 
older age, except those over age 80 years. This finding suggests that important 
biological differences exist between early-onset prostate cancer and late-onset 
disease. Secondly, early-onset prostate cancer has a strong genetic component, 
which indicates that young men with prostate cancer could benefit from 
evaluation of genetic risk. Furthermore, although the majority of men with 
early-onset prostate cancer are diagnosed with low-risk disease, the extended 
life expectancy of these patients exposes them to long-term effects of 
treatment-related morbidities and to long-term risk of disease progression 
leading to death from prostate cancer. For these reasons, patients with 
early-onset prostate cancer pose unique challenges, as well as opportunities, 
for both research and clinical communities. Current data suggest that 
early-onset prostate cancer is a distinct phenotype-from both an aetiological 
and clinical perspective-that deserves further attention.

Dietary restriction (DR) is one of the most universal means of extending 
lifespan. Yet, whether and how DR specifically affects the metabolic changes 
associated with aging is essentially unknown. Here, we present a comprehensive 
and unbiased picture of the metabolic variations that take place with age at the 
whole organism level in Caenorhabditis elegans by using (1)H high-resolution 
magic-angle spinning (HR-MAS) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis of 
intact worms. We investigate metabolic variations potentially important for 
lifespan regulation by comparing the metabolic fingerprint of two previously 
described genetic models of DR, the long-lived eat-2(ad465) and slcf-1(tm2258) 
worms, as single mutants or in combination with a genetic suppressor of their 
lifespan phenotype. Our analysis shows that significant changes in metabolite 
profiles precede the major physiological decline that accompanies aging and that 
DR protects from some of those metabolic changes. More specifically, low 
phosphocholine (PCho) correlates with high life expectancy. A mutation in the 
tumor suppressor gene PTEN/DAF-18, which suppresses the beneficial effects of DR 
in both C. elegans and mammals, increases both PCho level and choline kinase 
expression. Furthermore, we show that choline kinase function in the intestine 
can regulate lifespan. This study highlights the relevance of NMR metabolomic 
approaches for identifying potential biomarkers of aging.

OBJECTIVE: To analyze the relationship between burden of disease during 
2007-2009 and public funding of research in health in Spain during 2008-2010.
METHOD: Descriptive cross-sectional study of burden of disease and funding 
allocated for research in diseases in the Spanish National Health System.
RESULTS: A review was made of a total of 6,573 project titles funded for the 
years 2008, 2009 and 2010. During this period, a total of 472.7 million Euros 
were assigned as grants for research projects. Malignant tumors and 
neuropsychiatric diseases were the illnesses with greatest funding support. 
During the study period, it was estimated that there was a total of 15,253,331.3 
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) in Spain, with neuropsychiatric diseases 
being the category representing most DALYs with 4,396,900 (28.8%). The 
relationship between funding and DALYs was obtained with a Pearson r equal to 
0.759 (p<0.001). The study of congenital diseases had higher funding per DALY 
than any other disease with an investment of 290.4€/DALY. Among these, the study 
of cleft palate and esophageal atresia, with ratios of 3,432.7€/DALY and 
3,387.6€/DALY respectively, obtained the greatest funding.
CONCLUSIONS: The study shows that the relative distribution of economic 
resources in the study period is consistent with the burden suffered by the 
Spanish population. This relationship is altered by the funding of the study of 
congenital anomalies, because of the low number of projects in this area.

Octopamine is an important neurotransmitter in insects with multiple functions. 
Here, we investigated the role of this amine in a simple form of learning 
(habituation) in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. Specifically, we asked 
if octopamine is necessary for normal habituation of a proboscis extension 
response (PER) to different sucrose concentrations. In addition, we analyzed the 
relationship between responsiveness to sucrose solutions applied to the tarsus 
and habituation of the proboscis extension response in the same individual. The 
Tyramine-β-hydroxylase (Tβh) mutant lacks the enzyme catalyzing the final step 
of octopamine synthesis. This mutant was significantly less responsive to 
sucrose than controls. The reduced responsiveness directly led to faster 
habituation. Systemic application of octopamine or induction of octopamine 
synthesis by Tβh expression in a cluster of octopaminergic neurons within the 
suboesophageal ganglion restored sucrose responsiveness and habituation of 
octopamine mutants to control level. Further analyses imply that the reduced 
sucrose responsiveness of Tβh mutants is related to a lower sucrose preference, 
probably due to a changed carbohydrate metabolism, since Tβh mutants survived 
significantly longer under starved conditions. These findings suggest a pivotal 
role for octopamine in regulating sucrose responsiveness in fruit flies. 
Further, octopamine indirectly influences non-associative learning and possibly 
associative appetitive learning by regulating the evaluation of the sweet 
component of a sucrose reward.

OBJECTIVE: Non-surgical treatment can be effective for many musculoskeletal 
conditions. Improving access to these options may improve the efficiency of 
hospitals. The Orthopaedic Physiotherapy Screening Clinic and Multidisciplinary 
Service offers early comprehensive assessment and coordinated, patient-centred 
care within a multidisciplinary framework. Our aim was to assess its 
cost-effectiveness compared with usual orthopaedic care.
METHODS: A Markov model was constructed to estimate the quality-adjusted life 
years and health care costs from the perspective of health care payers for 
outpatients with low back, knee or shoulder conditions compared to usual 
orthopaedic care. Data were obtained from a retrospective chart review, 
administrative sources, literature and expert opinion. The time frame was five 
years and all costs were reported in 2011 $AUD.
RESULTS: Compared with usual orthopaedic care, the physiotherapist-led service 
costs an additional $495 per Quality Adjusted Life Year gained. The model 
remained cost-effective over a range of one-way sensitivity analyses.
CONCLUSION: The physiotherapist-led service is likely to be highly 
cost-effective. Determining the optimal mix of hospital orthopaedic outpatient 
services may require more advanced modeling techniques to be applied.

Infections of the spine have been a constant throughout history. At present 
there are infections in the spine fostered in part by the same advances in 
medicine: there are a lot of immunocompromised patients, the life expectancy of 
patients with chronic diseases is augmented and the increasing number of complex 
spinal surgeries can result in secondary infection. In this review the main 
types of infection of the spine and its treatment highlighting techniques in 
minimally invasive surgery are discussed. Spontaneous pyogenic and nonpyogenic 
spine infections as well as iatrogenic infections can be treated in a different 
manner depending on its extension, location and microorganism involved. We will 
review the use and the indication of percutaneous image-guided techniques, 
endoscopic and microsurgical techniques with or without use of tubular 
retractors. We conclude that techniques in minimally invasive surgery in spine 
infections are safe, effective and have benefits in morbidity of the approach 
and subsequent patient recovery.

From erythema multiforme to toxic epidermal necrolysis. Same spectrum or 
different diseases?

Erythema multiforme (EM), Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal 
necrolysis (TEN) are acute bullous disorders associated to different prognosis, 
mainly due to infections and drugs. More in particular EM in more than 90% is 
caused by infections (especially Herpes virus infection), while, on the other 
hand SJS and TEN are referable in more than 95% of cases to drugs. Distinction 
among these three forms is often controversal and still debated. An attempt to 
distinguish these forms has been possible mainly according to anamnesis, 
clinical presentation (morphology, involved sites, extension of lesions) and 
pathogenetic mechanisms, being on the contrary more difficult from an 
histopathological point of view. Nowadays a clear diagnosis and a distinction 
from other life-threatening diseases is possible with the integration of all the 
mentioned aspects. Moreover, this recognition should be as early as possible in 
order to perform a prognostic evaluation of the case and to start supportive 
cares and therapies as soon as possible.

The possibility of weighting QALYs differently for different groups of patients 
has been a source of debate. Most recently, this debate has been extended to the 
relative value of QALYs at the end of life (EoL). The objective of this study is 
to provide evidence of societal preferences in relation to this topic. Three 
cross-sectional surveys were conducted amongst Spanish general population (n = 
813). Survey 1 compared increases in life expectancy for EoL patients with 
health gains from temporary health problems. Survey 2 compared health gains for 
temporary health problems with quality of life gains at the EoL (palliative 
care). Survey 3 compared increases in life expectancy with quality of life 
gains, both for EoL patients. Preferences were elicited using Person Trade-Off 
(PTO) and Willingness to pay (WTP) techniques presenting two different durations 
of health benefit (6 and 18 months). Health benefits, measured in QALYs, were 
held constant in all comparisons. In survey 1 mean WTP was higher for life 
extending treatments than for temporary health problems and the majority of 
respondents prioritised life extension over temporary health problems in 
response to the PTO questions. In survey 2 mean WTP was higher for palliative 
care than for temporary health problems and 83% prioritized palliative care (for 
both durations) in the PTO questions. In survey 3 WTP values were higher for 
palliative care than for life extending treatments and more than 60% prioritized 
palliative care in the PTO questions. Our results suggest that QALYs gained from 
EoL treatments have a higher social value than QALYs gained from treatments for 
temporary health problems. Further, we found that people attach greater weight 
to improvements in quality of life than to life extension at the end of life.

Novel methods of measuring clinical outcomes from psoriasis and psoriatic 
arthritis clinical trials.

Numerous instruments exist that measure the clinical and health related quality 
of life impact of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis (PsA) in clinical trials. 
However, many of these instruments are not typically used in economic 
evaluations to inform decision problems facing health care decision makers. This 
study reviews the current state of psoriasis and PsA health outcome measures and 
evaluates their limitations in cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs). We highlight 
the health related quality of life and clinical outcome measures that are 
typically used in CEAs, with special focus on studies with quality adjusted life 
years as a primary outcome measure. Despite the high prevalence of psoriasis and 
PsA health outcome measures in clinical trials, only a few are used in CEAs. The 
methods by which utilities are estimated from these measures vary across 
cost-effectiveness studies. These differences should be considered when 
conducting cost-effectiveness research in psoriasis and PsA.

Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.

BACKGROUND: Bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaws (BRONJ) is the most 
serious complication of bisphosphonates therapy. Despite that several treatment 
modalities have been described, aggressive surgical treatment approach with wide 
bone resection and vascularized microsurgical reconstruction are controversial. 
The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical outcome of 8 new cases of 
BRONJ treated with radical resection and mandibular reconstruction with fibula 
free flap, to enforce the evidence about the reliability of this treatment 
option.
METHODS: Retrospective data of 8 patients with BRONJ who underwent segmental 
mandibulectomy and reconstruction with osteocutaneous fibula free flap from 
January 2004 to January 2008 were collected, including 6 patients with stage 3 
BRONJ and 2 patients with recalcitrant stage 2 BRONJ.
RESULTS: All patients were white, with a mean age of 64.7 years (range, 53-77 
y), and 62.5% were women. All bisphosphonates were administered intravenously, 
and all patients had mandibular localization. The mean period of follow-up was 
28.9 months. No flap loss or minor complications and no BRONJ recurrence were 
observed. All patients were able to ambulate pain-free.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite initial concerns regarding reliability of the mandibular 
free-flap reconstruction after BRONJ, this method seems to be a safe and 
feasible option in cancer patients with reasonable life expectancy, with 
complete BRONJ resolution and life quality improvement. Our findings confirm 
data previously published by other authors, without complication and with a much 
longer median follow-up time.

BACKGROUND: Pruritus, especially chronic pruritus, has long been underestimated 
and leads to high psychological strain in the affected patients. Even today, in 
spite of receiving increased attention, the underlying etiology cannot always be 
identified.
METHODS: We review potential underlying pathologic mechanisms of drug-induced 
pruritus, focusing among others on current dermato-oncological medications in 
terms of their pruritogenic risks.
RESULTS: Acute pruritus must be distinguished from chronic pruritus which lasts 
for a minimum of 6 weeks. There are various therapeutic approaches for 
drug-induced pruritus. As a first step, the drug causing the pruritus has to be 
identified; then the intake of that drug has to be ceased or modified. This may 
not always be possible, as in the case of chemotherapy agents.
CONCLUSIONS: With regard to the demographic development of the population with 
increasing life expectancy and the resulting increasing polypharmacy, drugs will 
have to be taken into account as a possible cause for pruritus more often in the 
future. It would be desirable to routinely assess pruritus as a possible adverse 
effect in regulatory drug studies.
