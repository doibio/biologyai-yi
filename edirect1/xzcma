suggest that, we may need to employ certain universal notions and use these in 
order to gain insights into the mechanics of a possible therapy against 
age-related degeneration. Examples may be the principle of hormesis, those of 
degeneracy, exaptation, and others from cybernetic or systems science domains. 
By using this four-pronged approach we liberate our thinking from the shackles 
of existing common mistakes and fallacies, and we open the way for a fresh 
approach that may lead us towards entirely new paradigms for providing 
clinically effective therapies against agerelated degeneration.

BACKGROUND: Outpatient parenteral antimicrobial therapy (OPAT) has been used for 
decades in different countries to reduce hospitalization rates, with favorable 
clinical and economic outcomes. This study assesses the cost-utility of OPAT 
compared to inpatient parenteral antimicrobial therapy (IPAT) from the 
perspective of a public university hospital and the Brazilian National Health 
System (Unified Health System -SUS).
METHODS: Prospective study with adult patients undergoing OPAT at an infusion 
center, compared to IPAT. Clinical outcomes and quality-adjusted life year 
(QALY) were assessed, as well as a micro-costing. Cost-utility analysis from the 
hospital and SUS perspectives were conducted by means of a decision tree, within 
a 30-day horizon time.
RESULTS: Forty cases of OPAT (1112 days) were included and monitored, with a 
favorable outcome in 97.50%. OPAT compared to IPAT generated overall savings of 
31.86% from the hospital perspective and 26.53% from the SUS perspective. The 
intervention reduced costs, with an incremental cost-utility ratio 
of -44,395.68/QALY for the hospital and -48,466.70/QALY for the SUS, with better 
cost-utility for treatment times greater than 14 days. Sensitivity analysis 
confirmed the stability of the model.
CONCLUSION: Our economic assessment demonstrated that, in the Brazilian context, 
OPAT is a cost-saving strategy both for hospitals and for the SUS.

OBJECTIVE: Determining adherence to recommended surveillance intervals after 
polypectomy in elderly patients.
DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study including 531 patients aged above 70 years 
undergoing polypectomy between 2009-2011 in a large Dutch teaching hospital, 
identified using the hospital's pathology registry. Outcomes of the index 
colonoscopy were reviewed. The interval until the next colonoscopy was assessed 
and compared both to the advised interval according to the Dutch guidelines and 
the gastroenterologist's recommendation. Reasons for deviating from the 
guideline were assessed.
RESULTS: The initial recommendation of the gastroenterologist for the 
surveillance interval was in accordance to the guideline in 59.1% of the 
patients. In 21.8% the gastroenterologist's advice was not documented. In 15.8% 
of the patients the gastroenterologist recommended to perform surveillance 
endoscopy earlier than the guideline, mainly based on polyp characteristics. The 
gastroenterologist advised endoscopy when the guideline advised no surveillance 
at all in 1.0%, later than the guideline recommendation in 1.2%, or did not 
recommend surveillance when the guideline advised to continue in 1.0%. Actual 
surveillance intervals were in accordance to the guideline in 54.4% and in 
accordance to the initial advice of the gastroenterologist in 58.4% of the 
patients.
CONCLUSION: Only in 41% of patients was the gastroenterologist's recommendation 
regarding surveillance after polypectomy either absent (21.8%) or not in 
accordance to the guideline (19.2%). Future research should focus on developing 
an evidence-based decision algorithm for elderly patients to support 
gastroenterologists and patients in the choices regarding cessation of 
surveillance at a certain level of frailty, comorbidity or remaining 
life-expectancy.

Nasopharyngeal infections are among the commonest diagnosed infections in 
infants. Largely treated supportively, these infections are considered harmless. 
These can however lead to serious complications from local spread and 
septicemia. With local extension, inflammatory neck masses (abscesses) can 
swiftly lead to life-threatening complications including mediastinitis, airway 
compromise and sinovenous thrombosis. Here, we report a 2-month-old infant with 
initial rhinopharyngitis and subsequent extensive deep neck abscesses with 
consequent dural sinus thrombosis successfully managed with antibiotics, 
anticoagulants and drainage. While such cases have been presented before, it is 
the pathophysiology and extent of sinus thrombosis in our case that is 
eccentric.

BACKGROUND: Given the increased link between retirement age and payments to the 
development in life expectancy, a precise and regular forecast of life 
expectancy is of utmost importance. The choice of the jump-off rates, i.e. the 
rates in the last year of the fitting period, is essential for matching 
mortality forecasts to the most recently observed data. A general approach to 
the choice of the jump-off rates is currently lacking.
OBJECTIVE: We evaluate six different options for the jump-off rates and examine 
their effects on the robustness and accuracy of the mortality forecast.
DATA AND METHODS: Death and exposure numbers by age for eight European countries 
over the years 1960-2014 were obtained from the Human Mortality Database. We 
examined the use of model values as jump-off rates versus observed values in the 
last year or averaged over the last couple of years. The future life expectancy 
at age 65 is calculated for different fitting periods and jump-off rates using 
the Lee-Carter model and examined on accuracy (mean absolute forecast error) and 
robustness (standard deviation of the change in projected e65).
RESULTS: The choice for the jump-off rates clearly influences the accuracy and 
robustness of the mortality forecast, albeit in different ways. For most 
countries using the last observed values as jump-off rates resulted in the most 
accurate method, which relates to the relatively high estimation error of the 
model in recent years. The most robust method is obtained by using an average of 
observed years as jump-off rates. The more years that are averaged, the better 
the robustness, but accuracy decreases with more years averaged.
CONCLUSION: Carefully considering the best choice for the jump-off rates is 
essential when forecasting mortality. The best strategy for matching mortality 
forecasts to the most recently observed data depends on the goal of the 
forecast, the country-specific past mortality trends observed, and the model 
fit.

BACKGROUND: An adequate forecasting model of mortality that allows an analysis 
of different population changes is a topic of interest for countries in 
demographic transition. Phenomena such as the reduction of mortality, ageing, 
and the increase in life expectancy are extremely useful in the planning of 
public policies that seek to promote the economic and social development of 
countries. To our knowledge, this paper is one of the first to evaluate the 
performance of mortality forecasting models applied to abridged life tables.
OBJECTIVE: Select a mortality model that best describes and forecasts the 
characteristics of mortality in Colombia when only abridged life tables are 
available.
DATA AND METHOD: We used Colombian abridged life tables for the period 1973-2005 
with data from the Latin American Human Mortality Database. Different mortality 
models to deal with modeling and forecasting probability of death are presented 
in this study. For the comparison of mortality models, two criteria were 
analyzed: graphical residuals analysis and the hold-out method to evaluate the 
predictive performance of the models, applying different goodness of fit 
measures.
RESULTS: Only three models did not have convergence problems: Lee-Carter (LC), 
Lee-Carter with two terms (LC2), and Age-Period-Cohort (APC) models. All models 
fit better for women, the improvement of LC2 on LC is mostly for central ages 
for men, and the APC model's fit is worse than the other two. The analysis of 
the standardized deviance residuals allows us to deduce that the models that 
reasonably fit the Colombian mortality data are LC and LC2. The major residuals 
correspond to children's ages and later ages for both sexes.
CONCLUSION: The LC and LC2 models present better goodness of fit, identifying 
the principal characteristics of mortality for Colombia.Mortality forecasting 
from abridged life tables by sex has clear added value for studying differences 
between developing countries and convergence/divergence of demographic changes.

Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA), also known as Kennedy's disease, is a 
rare, X-linked, late onset neuromuscular disorder. The disease is caused by a 
CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion in the first exon of the androgen receptor 
gene. It is characterized by slowly progressive lower motor neurons 
degeneration, primary myopathy and widespread multisystem involvement. 
Respiratory involvement is rare, and the condition is associated with a normal 
life expectancy. Despite a plethora of therapeutic studies in mouse models, no 
effective disease-modifying therapy has been licensed for clinical use to date. 
The development of sensitive monitoring markers for the particularly slowly 
progressing pathology of SBMA is urgently required to aid future clinical 
trials. A small number of outcome measures have been proposed recently, 
including promising biochemical markers, which show correlation with clinical 
disability and disease-stage and progression. Nevertheless, a paucity of 
SBMA-specific biomarker studies persists, delaying the development of monitoring 
markers for pharmaceutical trials. Collaborative efforts through international 
consortia and multicenter registries are likely to contribute to the 
characterization of the natural history of the condition, the establishment of 
disease-specific biomarker panels and ultimately contribute to the development 
of disease-modifying drugs.

Although people living with HIV (PLHIV) are approaching normal life expectancy, 
a limitation to achieving this goal is managing the higher prevalence of 
co-morbidities, including cardiovascular disease. Whilst ischaemic heart disease 
likely contributes to a large proportion of cardiac disease in the modern era of 
treatment, cardio-metabolic disease, including cardiac steatosis, akin to 
obesity-related heart disease, is also a possible mechanism of increased cardiac 
morbidity and mortality. HIV and other metabolic and inflammatory diseases 
affecting the heart, including obesity, share many cardio-metabolic 
abnormalities, with increased pericardial and myocardial fat content, in 
association with chronic systemic inflammatory changes and alterations in 
cardiac metabolism. Understanding the mechanisms of HIV-associated cardiac 
steatosis remains an important challenge, as managing the untreated metabolic 
and inflammatory precipitants may substantially improve cardiac outcomes for 
PLHIV.

We describe all cases of nasoethmoid schwannomas with intracranial extension 
reported in the literature, including an original case report describing the 
successful gross total resection of a nasoethmoid schwannoma with intracranial 
extension. Ten cases of nasoethmoid schwannoma with intracranial extension have 
previously been reported. These lesions most often appear in the second through 
fourth decades of life and commonly present with anosmia, headache, and visual 
deficits. Bifrontal craniotomy was the predominantly implemented surgical 
approach and gross total resection was achieved in all cases, except for one. In 
conclusion, nasoethmoid schwannoma with intracranial extension is a rare disease 
entity that is most often benign and is most commonly treated by gross total 
resection using a bifrontal craniotomy approach.

BACKGROUND: Cancer-related pain is a growing health problem given the increasing 
life expectancy of cancer patients. Opioids are commonly used to treat 
cancer-related pain, but carry the risk of severe side effects, limiting their 
use. Cebranopadol is a first-in-class drug candidate, combining 
nociceptin/orphanin FQ peptide and opioid peptide receptor agonism. This trial 
examined the analgesic efficacy of cebranopadol compared with morphine prolonged 
release (PR) in patients with moderate-to-severe cancer-related pain.
METHODS: This double-blind, parallel-group, multiple-dose trial was designed as 
noninferiority trial for efficacy of cebranopadol versus morphine PR. Planned 
with 524 patients, finally 126 patients were treated for up to 7 weeks (low 
accrual). The primary efficacy endpoint was the average amount of daily rescue 
medication intake (morphine immediate release) over the last 2 weeks of 
treatment.
RESULTS: For the primary endpoint, noninferiority of cebranopadol with and 
superiority over morphine PR were demonstrated (Full Analysis Set: 
∆[95%CI] = -7.48 mg [-12.05, -2.92]; Per Protocol Set: ∆[95%CI] = -4.67 mg 
[-9.25, -0.10]). The vast majority of patients (≥75%, either treatment) had 
clinically relevant pain reduction, and noninferiority on this secondary 
endpoint was not shown. Mostly used doses were ≤800 μg cebranopadol or ≤120 mg 
morphine PR daily. A total of 83.1% of patients on cebranopadol and 82.0% on 
morphine PR experienced treatment-emergent adverse events.
CONCLUSIONS: Cebranopadol was effective, safe and well tolerated in the dose 
range tested (200-1,000 μg) in patients suffering from chronic 
moderate-to-severe cancer-related pain and was superior to morphine PR on the 
primary endpoint.
SIGNIFICANCE: Cebranopadol presents a new approach to treat cancer pain. The 
drug candidate was easy to titrate, safe and well tolerated, and as effective as 
morphine PR in patients suffering from chronic moderate-to-severe cancer-related 
pain.

BACKGROUND: The benefits of dialysis in older people with ESKD are not clear. We 
prospectively evaluated whether dialysis has survival advantage compared to 
conservative care (CC) in older people who were medically suitable for dialysis 
therapy.
METHODS: This was a prospective observational study of CKD patients aged ≥75 
years when eGFR first reached ≤15ml/min/1.73m2. Hazard ratios (HR) for death 
were compared between patients who chose dialysis versus conservative care (CC) 
from when first seen in pre-dialysis clinic (eGFR ≤15ml/min/1.73m2), and when 
initiation of dialysis was first considered (eGFR ≤10ml/min/1.73m2). Patients 
with co-morbidities likely to significantly reduce life expectancy such as 
advanced heart failure, advanced dementia, and malignancy, were excluded.
RESULTS: There were 204 patients (123 dialysis, 81 CC). 115 went on to record 
eGFR of ≤10ml/min/1.73m2 (73 dialysis, 42 CC). The median survival from eGFR 
first ≤15ml/min/1.73m2 for the dialysis and CC groups were 42 (33-50) months and 
31 (21-41) months. The adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for death in the dialysis 
group compared to CC was 0.61 (0.41-0.61, p = 0.01). The median survival from 
eGFR first ≤10ml/min/1.73m2 for dialysis and CC group were 36 (25-47) months and 
12 (0-5) months. The adjusted HR for death in the dialysis group compared to CC 
was 0.36 (0.21-0.62, p <0.001).
CONCLUSION: Dialysis confers a survival benefit in older patients medically 
suitable for dialysis. This study is novel in being both prospective and in 
excluding patients with co-morbidities which may limit suitability for dialysis 
and life expectancy. A future focus on quality of life is needed to establish 
the true benefits of dialysis in older people.

Defining the viability of tardigrades with a molecular sensor related to death.

Richaud M(1), Galas S(1).

Author information:

The design of experimental protocols that use animal models to assess the impact 
of a stress on a population or to determine the life span expectancy impact can 
be time-consuming due to the need for direct observations of dead and living 
animals. These experiments are usually based on the detectable activity of 
animals such as food intake or mobility and can sometimes produce either under- 
or overestimated results. The tardigrade Hypsibius exemplaris is an emerging 
model for the evolutionary biology of the tardigrade phylum because of its 
convenient laboratory breeding and the recent introduction of new molecular 
tools. In this report, we describe the use of a new fluorescent dye that can 
specifically stain dead tardigrades. Furthermore, we also monitored the absence 
of a toxic side effect of the death-linked fluorescent dye on tardigrade 
populations. Finally, we conclude that tardigrade experiments that require 
survival counting of the Hypsibius exemplaris species can be greatly improved by 
using this technique in order to limit underestimation of alive animals.

OBJECTIVE: To correlate the number of hypertensive patients with high and very 
high risk for cardiovascular diseases with socioeconomic and health indicators.
METHODS: An ecological study carried out from the National Registry of 
Hypertension and Diabetes (SisHiperDia). The variable "hypertensive patients 
with high and very high risk" was correlated with the Human Development Index, 
health care costs and services, average household income per capita, per capita 
municipal income, number of hospital admissions in SUS, number of medical 
consultations in the SUS and specific mortality due to diseases of the 
circulatory system, considering the 27 federative units of Brazil. The data was 
processed in software IBM Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) 
Statistics, version 22.00. The statistical analysis considered the level of 
significance p<0.05.
RESULTS: Brazilian states with more hypertensive registries in high/very high 
risk spend more on public health, fewer people reach the elderly age group and 
more deaths from diseases of the circulatory system (p<0.05). The very high risk 
stratum correlated with more physicians per population (p<0.05).
CONCLUSION: Systemic arterial hypertension has a direct impact on life 
expectancy and also on the economic context, since when it evolves to high and 
very high risk for cardiovascular diseases, it generates more expenses in health 
and demand more professionals, burdening the public health system. Monitoring is 
necessary in order to consolidate public policies to promote the health of 
hypertensive individuals.

Within the "seed and soil" theory of organ tropic cancer metastasis is a growing 
compilation of evidence that S100A8/A9 functions as a soil signal that attracts 
cancer cells to certain organs, which prove beneficial to their growth. 
S100A8/A9-sensing receptors including Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), advanced 
glycation end products (RAGE), and also important receptors we recently 
succeeded in identifying (EMMPRIN, NPTNβ, MCAM, and ALCAM) have the potential to 
become promising therapeutic targets. In our study, we prepared extracellular 
regions of these novel molecules and fused them to human IgG2-Fc to extend 
half-life expectancy, and we evaluated the anti-metastatic effects of the 
purified decoy proteins on metastatic cancer cells. The purified proteins 
markedly suppressed S100A8/A9-mediated lung tropic cancer metastasis. We hence 
expect that our novel biologics may become a prominent medicine to prevent 
cancer metastasis in clinical settings through cutting the linkage between "seed 
and soil".

OBJECTIVE: Elevated circulating levels of pro-inflammatory biomarkers are 
associated with adverse health effects, but the extent to which enhanced 
low-grade inflammation influences remaining life expectancy (LE) is uncertain. 
GlycA is a novel pro-inflammatory marker. We determined effects of GlycA and 
high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) on LE.
METHODS: GlycA and hsCRP were determined in 5526 subjects. LE was compared in 
the upper quartile of both GlycA and hsCRP vs. the respective lower three 
quartiles combined, adjusted for LE of individuals in the Dutch general 
population of the same birth cohort and sex.
RESULTS: Median follow up was 8.5 years [interquartile range 7.9-9.0], during 
which 348 (6.3%) subjects had deceased. LE at the end of follow up was lower in 
the highest vs. the lower three quartiles of GlycA (P < .001) and hsCRP 
(P < .001). Both men as well as women in the highest GlycA quartile had reduced 
LE vs. the lowest three quartiles combined (P < .001 and P = .02). For hsCRP, 
this was only observed in men (P < .001) but not in women (P = .67).
CONCLUSIONS: This population-based cohort study demonstrates that higher plasma 
levels of GlycA were associated with reduced LE in men and women. With regard to 
hsCRP this only applied to men.

The American Society for Radiation Oncology produced an evidence-based guideline 
on whole-breast radiation therapy for patients with early-stage invasive breast 
cancer and ductal carcinoma in situ. This commentary points out areas where we 
believe the data are too limited to make definitive recommendations and where 
alternative approaches are supported by evidence.

BACKGROUND: Advanced pancreatic cancer is accompanied not only by bile duct 
obstruction, but also occasionally by duodenal obstruction. With new advances in 
chemotherapy and improvement in the management of stent dysfunction, the life 
expectancy of patients with pancreatic cancer has increased. This study aimed to 
evaluate the efficacy and safety of chemotherapy for advanced pancreatic cancer, 
as well as to analyze the prognostic factors, following endoscopic double 
stenting.
METHODS: This retrospective study was conducted from January 1, 2007 to October 
31, 2015 at an academic center. Fifty consecutive patients with pancreatic 
cancer who had undergone endoscopic double stenting, comprising duodenal and 
biliary stenting, were analyzed. We reviewed the patients records and analyzed 
the data of stent dysfunction rates after double stenting, reintervention for 
stent dysfunction, chemotherapy after double stenting, adverse events associated 
with chemotherapy after double stenting, survival times following double 
stenting, and overall survival times. The hospital's institutional review board 
for human research approved this study.
RESULTS: The overall survival time and the survival time following double 
stenting were 10.9 months (IQR 6.0-18.4 months) and 2.4 months (IQR 
1.4-5.2 months), respectively. After double stenting, duodenal stent dysfunction 
occurred in 6 patients (12%), and biliary stent dysfunction occurred in 12 
patients (24%), respectively. All patients who experienced stent dysfunction 
underwent endoscopic reintervention, and all of the procedures were successful. 
Twenty-one (42%) patients were treated with chemotherapy post double stenting; 9 
patients received chemotherapy as a first-line treatment, 9 as a second-line 
treatment, and 3 as a third-line treatment. During chemotherapy, 8 (38%) 
patients had grade 3-4 adverse events, which were manageable. Chemotherapy post 
double stenting (OR, 0.19; 95% CI, 0.059-0.60; P = .0051), reintervention for 
biliary stent dysfunction (OR, 0.21; 95% CI, 0.081-0.50; P = .0002), and 
performance status (< 2) (OR, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.098-0.71; P = .0064) were 
significant prognostic factors after double stenting.
CONCLUSIONS: Systemic chemotherapy was manageable, even in patients with double 
stenting. Chemotherapy after double stenting and appropriate reintervention for 
stent obstructions potentially prolonged the survival of patients with advance 
pancreatic cancer.

The perennial wild rice Zizania latifolia is confined in the swampy habitat and 
wetland of the Indo-Burma biodiversity hotspot of India and infection by the 
biotrophic fungus Ustilago esculenta is hallmarked by swellings that develop to 
form localized smut-gall at the topmost internodal region. The cellular and 
proteomic events involved in the non-systemic colonization of Z. latifolia by U. 
esculenta leading to smut-gall formation is poorly understood. Proteins were 
extracted from the smut-gall region at the topmost internodal region below the 
apical meristematic tissue from the infected and uninfected parts of Z. 
latifolia. By combining transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and fluorescent 
microscopy (FM), we showed that U. esculenta hyphal morphological transitions 
and movement occurred both intercellularly and intracellularly while sporulation 
occurred intracellularly in selective cells. Following proteome profiling using 
two dimensional SDS-PAGE at different phenological phases of smut-gall 
development and U. esculenta infection, differentially expressed proteins bands 
and their relative abundance were detected and subjected to liquid 
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometric (LC-MS/MS) analysis. Importantly, the 
fungus explores at least 7 metabolic pathways and 5 major biological processes 
to subdue the host defense and thrive successfully on Z. latifolia. The fungus 
U. esculenta produces proteases and energy acquisition proteins those enhance 
it's defensive and survival mode in the host. The identified differentially 
regulated proteins shed-light into why inflorescence is being replaced by 
bulbous smut-gall at late stages of the disease, as well as the development of 
resistance in some Z. latifolia plants against U. esculenta infection.

INTRODUCTION: Necrotizing fasciitis is an uncommon infection characterized by a 
necrotic infection that rapidly diffuse along the fascia and progresses to 
systemic sepsis. The combined occurrence of necrotizing fasciitis of the chest 
wall and acute appendicitis is extremely unusual.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 27-year-old man without any significant medical history 
presented to the emergency department, in the postoperative course of a 
laparotomy for perforated acute appendicitis, with septic shock and a large 
erythematous region over the right abdominal wall. Laboratory evaluation 
revealed leucocytosis and lactic acidosis. A new surgical exploration revealed a 
purulent peritonitis with necrotizing fasciitis involving the right lower 
abdomen, right psoas muscle and right retroperitoneum. On intensive care unit, 
the patient was managed with intravenous antibiotics and surgical debridement. 
In the following days, the patient developed extension of the necrosis to the 
right chest wall. A computed tomography scan of the chest showed right-sided 
pleural effusion with erosive aspect of the ribs. Necrotic tissues were debrided 
and antibiotic was changed due to wound superinfection with Acinetobacter 
Baumannii.
DISCUSSION: Necrotizing fasciitis of chest due to acute appendicitis is 
extremely unusual. The optimal treatment associates appropriate antibiotics, 
oxygenation of infected tissue, and surgical debridement.
CONCLUSION: Acute appendicitis resulting in necrotizing fasciitis of chest is 
rare but life-threatening. Early diagnosis and treatment is essential to reduce 
morbidity and mortality.

Patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) have an average life expectancy of 
approximately 15 months. Recently, statins have emerged as a potential adjuvant 
cancer therapy due to their ability to inhibit cell proliferation and induce 
apoptosis in many types of cancer. The exact mechanisms that mediate the 
inhibitory actions of statins in cancer cells are largely unknown. The purpose 
of this proceeding paper is to discuss some of the known anticancer effects of 
statins, while focusing on GBM therapy that includes adjunct therapy of statins 
with chemotherapeutic agents.

HPV Vaccination of Girl Child in India: Intervention for Primary Prevention of 
Cervical Cancer.

Over the past 40 years mortality from carcinoma of the cervix has fallen due to 
improved treatment and the introduction of national screening programs. 
Awareness and health-seeking practices have been shown to be poor in many 
developing countries, necessitating the need for proper awareness and 
vaccination program The HPV vaccination is of public health importance. The 
Indian Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Immunization (IAPCOI) recommends 
offering HPV vaccine to all females who can afford the vaccine. Vaccination can 
be given to females as young as 9 years as well as in those aged 13–26 years who 
have not previously completed vaccination. The primary obstacle to HPV 
vaccination is financial. There are bivalent, Quadrivalent and Nonavalent HPV 
vaccines available based on protection against number of HPV subtypes. HPV 
vaccination and regular cervical screening is the most effective way to prevent 
cervical cancer. Parents/caregivers of child must be educated regarding HPV 
vaccination before offering this chemoprophylaxis against cervical cancer. Gaps 
and barriers to the access and delivery of HPV vaccination need to be 
identified, so that scientific and public health communities and civil society 
can be mobilised to adopt the vaccination policy.

Background In patients with vascular disease, risk models may support decision 
making on novel risk reducing interventions, such as proprotein convertase 
subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors or anti-inflammatory agents. We developed and 
validated an innovative model to estimate life expectancy without recurrent 
cardiovascular events for individuals with coronary, cerebrovascular, and/or 
peripheral artery disease that enables estimation of preventive treatment effect 
in lifetime gained. Methods and Results Study participants originated from 
prospective cohort studies: the SMART (Secondary Manifestations of Arterial 
Disease) cohort and REACH (Reduction of Atherothrombosis for Continued Health) 
cohorts of 14 259 ( REACH Western Europe), 19 170 ( REACH North America) and 
6959 ( SMART , The Netherlands) patients with cardiovascular disease. The 
SMART-REACH model to estimate life expectancy without recurrent events was 
developed in REACH Western Europe as a Fine and Gray competing risk model 
incorporating cardiovascular risk factors. Validation was performed in REACH 
North America and SMART . Outcomes were (1) cardiovascular events (myocardial 
infarction, stroke, cardiovascular death) and (2) noncardiovascular death. 
Predictors were sex, smoking, diabetes mellitus, systolic blood pressure, total 
cholesterol, creatinine, number of cardiovascular disease locations, atrial 
fibrillation, and heart failure. Calibration plots showed high agreement between 
estimated and observed prognosis in SMART and REACH North America. C-statistics 
were 0.68 (95% confidence interval, 0.67-0.70) in SMART and 0.67 (95% confidence 
interval, 0.66-0.68) in REACH North America. Performance of the SMART-REACH 
model was better compared with existing risk scores and adds the possibility of 
estimating lifetime gained by novel therapies. Conclusions The externally 
validated SMART-REACH model could be used for estimation of anticipated 
improvements in life expectancy without recurrent cardiovascular events in 
individual patients with cardiovascular disease in Western Europe and North 
America.
