BACKGROUND: In Parkinson's disease (PD), several disease-modifying treatments 
are being tested in (pre-)clinical trials. To successfully implement such 
treatments, it is important to have insight into factors influencing the 
professionals' decision to start disease-modifying treatments in persons who are 
in the prodromal stage of PD.
OBJECTIVE: We aim to identify factors that professionals deem important in 
deciding to a start disease-modifying treatment in the prodromal stage of PD.
METHODS: We used a discrete choice experiment (DCE) to elicit preferences of 
neurologists and last-year neurology residents regarding treatment in the 
prodromal phase of PD. The DCE contained 16 hypothetical choice sets in which 
participants were asked to choose between two treatment options. The presented 
attributes included treatment effect, risk of severe side-effects, risk of mild 
side-effects, route of administration, and annual costs.
RESULTS: We included 64 neurologists and 18 last year neurology residents. 
Participants attached most importance to treatment effect and to the risk of 
severe side-effects. Participants indicated that they would discuss one of the 
presented treatments in daily practice more often in persons with a high risk of 
being in the prodromal phase compared to those with a moderate risk. Other 
important factors for deciding to start treatment included the amount of 
evidence supporting the putative treatment effect, the preferences of the person 
in the prodromal phase, and the life expectancy.
CONCLUSION: This study provides important insights in factors that influence 
decision making by professionals about starting treatment in the prodromal phase 
of PD.

BACKGROUND: Remote work was evidenced in the pandemic and studies in this area 
increased. Most studies focus on professionals of companies or 
professors/students in the academic environment. At the same time, non-academic 
staff, that provide all the support required for the core activities of the 
institutions (research/teaching/extension activities) have been neglected.
OBJECTIVE: This article aims to exploratory analyse which variables 
(interruptions when working remotely (1), health concerns (2) and fear of 
contracting coronavirus (3), anxiety and concern about professional career (4), 
frustration to have cancelled plans and missed opportunities (5) and gender (6)) 
can impact feelings of sadness and depression experienced by non-academic staff 
of a university working remotely.
METHODS: Using a database on behaviour and feelings of non-academic staff from a 
Brazilian university working remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic, a binary 
logistic regression model was structured. In an exploratory manner, six 
independent variables (presented in the previous item) were analysed in terms of 
their ability to predict the dependent variable (feelings of sadness and 
depression).
RESULTS: The results presented the prediction power of the independent variables 
for the dependent variable. The variables regarding concern with their health, 
increased anxiety and concern about their career presented Odds Ratios of 3.6 
(1.4-8.5 -95% C.I.) and 3.3 (2.2-5.0 -95% C.I.), respectively, standing out from 
the other variables.
CONCLUSIONS: These results focus on staff at one institution, but they can 
contribute to better understand feelings and behaviours experienced by 
professionals working remotely and provide information for debates on the field 
of COVID-19-related changes of work.

A long testing period is usually required for the life testing of 
high-reliability products or materials. It is possible to shorten the testing 
process by using ALTs (accelerated life tests). Due to the fact that ALTs test 
products in harsher settings than are typical use conditions, the life 
expectancy of the objects they evaluate is reduced. Censored data in which the 
specific failure timings of all units assigned to test are not known, or all 
units assigned to test have not failed, may arise in ALTs for a variety of 
reasons, including operational failure, device malfunction, expense, and time 
restrictions. In this paper, we have considered the step stress partially 
accelerated life test (SSPALT) under two different censoring schemes, namely the 
type-I progressive hybrid censoring scheme (type-I PHCS) and the type-II 
progressive censorship scheme (type-II PCS). The failure times of the items are 
assumed to follow NH distribution, while the tampered random variable (TRV) 
model is used to explain the effect of stress change. In order to obtain the 
estimates of the unknown parameters, the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) 
approach is adopted. Furthermore, based on the asymptotic theory of MLEs, the 
approximate confidence intervals (ACIs) are also constructed. The point 
estimates under two censoring schemes are compared in terms of root mean squared 
errors (RMSEs) and relative absolute biases (RABs), while ACIs are compared in 
terms of their lengths and coverage probabilities (CPs). The performance of the 
estimators has been evaluated and compared under two censoring schemes with 
various sample sizes through a simulation study. Simulation results show that 
estimates with type-I PHCS outperform estimates with type-II PCS in terms of 
RMSEs, RABs, lengths, and CPs. Finally, a real-world numerical example of 
insulating fluid failure times is presented to show how the approaches will work 
in reality.

OBJECTIVE: Continuing care, which is an extension of post-discharge care, is 
recognized as a crucial element of high-quality health services and is essential 
to patients. This systematic review aims to identify the effectiveness of 
continuing care for patients with stomas.
METHODS: PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Trial Register and Web of Science databases 
were searched. Study selection and quality appraisal were performed 
independently by two reviewers. We calculated the mean differences (MD) or the 
relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence intervals and assessed heterogeneity.
RESULTS: Nine studies (1134 participants) met the inclusion criteria. This 
meta-analysis revealed that, in the continuous care group, the stoma 
self-efficacy (MD ​= ​6.46; 95% CI ​= ​3.81-9.11; P ​< ​0.001; I 2 ​= ​0%), and 
the quality of life (MD ​= ​7.48; 95% CI ​= ​5.13-9.82; P ​< ​0.001; I 2 ​= ​0%) 
increased significantly 1 month after discharge; stoma adjustment and care 
satisfaction also showed a trend toward improvement while stoma complications 
(RR ​= ​0.71; 95% CI ​= ​0.58-0.87; P ​= ​0.001; I 2 ​= ​25%) decreased 
significantly. Continuing care did not decrease hospital readmission rates or 
medical costs.
CONCLUSIONS: Continuing care showed beneficial effects in improving health 
outcomes and care satisfaction for patients with stomas compared with routine 
care. We proposed an integrated continuing care program with different elements 
and recommendations for its implementation.

Clove and cinnamon based nanoemulsions (NE) were prepared with different levels 
of soy lecithin as a surfactant employing ultrasonication treatment. Increase in 
surfactant levels decreased the particle size (PS), polydispersity index (PDI) 
and zeta potential in both the NE. Cinnamon and clove based nanoemulsions were 
optimized at 1.5 and 2.0% SL, respectively based on their PS and PDI value. 
Nanoemulsions having the highest thermo stability were further selected to coat 
the muffin samples. NE Coated and uncoated muffins were evaluated for changes in 
density, moisture content, water activity, weight loss, texture, antioxidant 
activity, microbial activity and sensory scores during storage. NE coating 
significantly increased antioxidant activity of muffins by 26.89% (Cinnamon oil 
NE) and 37.31% (Clove oil NE). Furthermore during storage, coating of NE 
maintains the texture of the muffins, reduce the weight loss, density and 
moisture content to a greater extent in comparison to uncoated muffins. 
Antioxidant activity and total plate count of clove oil NE coated muffins were 
significantly higher than cinnamon oil NE coated muffins and while both the NE 
coating also effectively facilitated in extending the shelf life up to 6 days 
without any quality deterioration, which facilitated their use as a functional 
ingredient.

The advancement of medical technology has led not only to an increase in life 
expectancy but also to a rise in aging-related diseases. Aging promotes 
metabolic disorders, in turn affecting cardiovascular health. Derailment of 
biological processes in the pancreas, liver, adipose tissue, and skeletal muscle 
impairs glucose and lipid metabolism, and mitochondrial function, triggering the 
development of diabetes and lipid-related disorders that inflict damage on 
cardiac and vascular tissues. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) regulate a wide 
range of biological process and are one of the key factors controlling 
metabolism and mitochondria. Here, we discuss the versatile function of lncRNAs 
involved in the metabolic regulation of glucose and lipid, and mitochondrial 
function, and how the dysregulation of lncRNAs induces the development of 
various metabolic disorders and their cardiovascular consequences.

BACKGROUND: Decisions based on cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs) using equal 
discount rates for health and cost outcomes are consistent with using a constant 
cost-effectiveness threshold over time. We sought to analyze trends in 
author-reported cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) thresholds from CEAs 
published for the US setting over 24 y to retrospectively assess whether the 
recommended equal discount rates for costs and health were consistent with 
trends in the CEA literature.
METHODS: We used the Tufts CEA Registry to assess whether author-reported 
cost-effectiveness thresholds changed in CEAs published for the US setting 
between 1995 and 2018 and back-calculated the implied discount rate for health 
based on these trends for inflation-adjusted cost-effectiveness thresholds and 
an annual discount rate for costs of 3%.
RESULTS: We found 1995 CEAs published for the US setting and found that average 
nominal and inflation-adjusted cost-effectiveness thresholds increased over that 
time period. The discount rate for health would need to equal 2.43% to 2.48% 
(depending on the subset of CEAs analyzed) to be consistent with the observed 
trends in inflation-adjusted author-reported cost-effectiveness thresholds. We 
also found that restricting our analysis to currency years between 1995 and 2014 
would result in a back-calculated discount rate for health of 2.99% to 3.28%.
CONCLUSIONS: We found that CEA researchers have implicitly assumed that 
inflation-adjusted cost-effectiveness thresholds in the United States have been 
increasing over time (1995-2018), which is inconsistent with the recommended and 
prevailing choice of equal discount rates for health and cost outcomes. Our 
results are sensitive to the cutoff year used in the analysis.
HIGHLIGHTS: We show visually and through equations that the recommended and 
prevailing practice of using equal discount rates for cost and health outcomes 
in cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs) logically implies a constant 
inflation-adjusted cost-effectiveness threshold over time.Using data from the 
Tufts CEA Registry, we found that author-reported cost-effectiveness thresholds 
used in CEAs published for the US setting with currency years between 1995 and 
2018 increased over time (both with and without adjustment for 
inflation).Assuming an annual discount rate for costs equal to 3%, the discount 
rate for health would need to equal approximately 2.5% to preserve consistency 
across decisions taken at different dates given the observed trends in 
inflation-adjusted author-reported cost-effectiveness thresholds.This finding 
depends on the cutoff year used in the analysis (data from currency years 
1995-2014 would support use of equal discount rates, whereas data after 2014 
would suggest a sharper trend toward increasing cost-effectiveness thresholds).

Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) as a high-frequency genetic disorder is 
diagnosed based on family and/or patient's history of coronary heart disease 
(CHD) or some other atherosclerotic diseases, LDL-C levels, and/or clinical 
signs such as tendinous xanthoma, arcus cornealis before age 45 years as well as 
a functional mutation in the LDLR, apoB or PCSK9 gene. Its clinical features are 
detectable since early childhood. Early diagnosis and timely treatment increase 
life expectancy in most patients with FH. Current FH therapies decrease the 
level of lowdensity lipoprotein up to ≥50% from baseline with diet, 
pharmacotherapeutic treatment, lipid apheresis, and liver transplantation. The 
cornerstone of medical therapy is the use of more potent statins in higher 
doses, to which often ezetimibe has to be added, but some FH patients do not 
achieve the target LDL-C with this therapy Therefore, besides these and the most 
recent but already established therapeutic approaches including PCSK9 
inhibitors, inclisiran, and bempedoic acid, new therapies are on the horizon 
such as gene therapy, CRISPR/Cas9 strategy, etc. This paper focuses on cellular 
and molecular potential strategies for the treatment of FH.

IMPORTANCE: Recent guidelines recommend a systolic blood pressure (BP) goal of 
less than 150 mm Hg or even 130 mm Hg for adults aged 60 years or older. 
However, harms from intensive BP treatments occur immediately (eg, syncope, 
fall), and benefits for cardiovascular event reduction emerge over time. 
Therefore, harms with low chance of benefit need to be clearer, particularly for 
those with limited life expectancy.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate the time needed to potentially derive clinical benefit 
from intensive BP treatment in patients 60 years and older.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This secondary analysis included individual 
patient data from published randomized clinical trials with 27 414 patients 60 
years or older with hypertension. Patient-level survival data were reconstructed 
when the original data were not available. Published trials were identified by 
searching PubMed until October 15, 2021.
EXPOSURES: Intensive BP lowering vs standard BP lowering with the 
treat-to-target design.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) defined by 
each trial, which was broadly similar with all trials including myocardial 
infarction, stroke, and cardiovascular mortality.
RESULTS: Six trials (original data from 2 trials and reconstructed data from 4 
trials) with 27 414 participants (mean age, 70 years; 56.3% were women) were 
included in the analysis. Intensive BP treatment with a systolic BP target below 
140 mm Hg was significantly associated with a 21% reduction in MACE (hazard 
ratio, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.71-0.88; P < .001). On average, 9.1 (95% CI, 4.0-20.6) 
months were needed to prevent 1 MACE per 500 patients with the intensive BP 
treatment (absolute risk reduction [ARR], 0.002). Likewise, 19.1 (95% CI, 
10.9-34.2) and 34.4 (95% CI, 22.7-59.8) months were estimated to avoid 1 MACE 
per 200 (ARR, 0.005) and 100 (ARR, 0.01) patients, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this analysis, findings suggest that for patients 
60 years and older with hypertension, intensive BP treatment may be appropriate 
for some adults with a life expectancy of greater than 3 years but may not be 
suitable for those with less than 1 year.

BACKGROUND: Adolescents and young adults (AYAs, aged 18-39 years) with advanced 
cancer have an increased life expectancy due to improvements and refinements in 
cancer therapies, resulting in a growing group of AYAs living with an uncertain 
and/or poor cancer prognosis (UPCP). To date, no studies have examined the 
difficulties of health care professionals (HCPs) providing care to AYAs with a 
UPCP. This study aimed to understand the challenges in daily clinical practice 
experienced by HCPs from different disciplines who provide palliative as well as 
general care to AYAs with a UPCP.
METHODS: HCPs from a variety of backgrounds (e.g. clinical nurse specialists, 
medical oncologists, neurologists psychologists) were invited for a 
semi-structured interview. The interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed 
using reflexive thematic analysis. Two AYA patients were actively involved as 
research partners to increase the relevance of the study design and to optimise 
interpretation of results.
RESULTS: Forty-nine HCPs were interviewed. Overall, we found that the threat of 
premature death within this young patient group increased emotional impact on 
HCPs and evoked a feeling of unfairness, which was an extra motivation for HCPs 
to provide the most optimal care possible. We generated four key themes: (i) 
emotional confrontation (e.g. feeling helplessness and experiencing a greater 
sense of empathy), (ii) questioning own professional attitude and skills, (iii) 
navigating uncertainty (e.g. discussing prognosis and end of life) and (iv) 
obstacles in the health care organisation (e.g. lack of knowledge and clarity 
about responsibilities).
CONCLUSIONS: HCPs experienced unique emotional and practical challenges when 
providing care to AYAs with a UPCP. The results from this study highlight the 
need to develop an education module for HCPs treating AYAs with UPCP to increase 
their own well-being and optimise the delivery of person- and age-adjusted care.

INTRODUCTION: Health-related quality of life is expressed in utilities, also 
referred to as utility estimates or parameters. Considerations about the source 
and type of utility values are especially important in a modeling context, where 
the lack of transparency, including the lack of a hierarchy for utility data 
sources, is a major issue to any estimation and can potentially compromise model 
reliability.
OBJECTIVES: This document aims to present the first version of the Brazilian 
guidelines for utility measurement to support economic analysis.
METHODS: A virtual workshop and a modified Delphi panel with 10 health 
technology specialists followed a rapid evaluation of 110 technical documents 
and indexed publications. The recommendations are based on the proposition that 
has received the most votes, although contentious issues are addressed in the 
suggestion or discussion. The rationale for the final decision is included in 
the text.
RESULTS: The consensus includes 50 recommendations with the following topics: 
Transparency and Reliability, Model Design, Conditions Under Which Generic 
Questionnaires Are Not Sensible or Valid, Utility Evidence Hierarchy, Utility 
Data Searching, Modeling Utility Values, Extrapolating Quality Adjusted 
Life-Years for Models With Lifetime Horizons, Caregiver Utility, Utility Data 
Synthesis, Quality/Certainty of the Evidence, and Utility Estimates in 
End-of-Life Conditions.
CONCLUSIONS: The goal of this project is to create unified national standards 
for using utility metrics in economic analysis in Brazil. This set of 
recommendations is not obligatory, but it is meant to serve as a guide and lead 
to the development of better and more transparent economic models in the 
country.

Cryptosporidium is the leading agent of waterborne parasitic protozoan outbreaks 
and is the second leading cause of infant mortality due to diarrhoea worldwide. 
Acanthamoeba spp. causes Acanthamoeba keratitis (AK) and a life-threatening 
condition known as granulomatous amoebic encephalitis (GAE). The present study 
aimed to assess the water quality of an indigenous and a rural community for 
waterborne parasitic protozoan contamination. Aquatic samples (n = 22) were 
processed by filtration of 500 mL portion through a 1.2 μm pore size glass 
microfiber filter and eluted for light microscopy, culture in non-nutrient agar, 
and PCR analysis. Overall, 36% (8/22) of the investigated aquatic samples were 
positive for either Cryptosporidium spp. oocysts (13%; 3/22) or Acanthamoeba 
spp., (36%; 8/22) or both (13%; 3/22). Cryptosporidium spp. oocysts were 
detected in 27% (3/11) of wet season samples only while Acanthamoeba spp. were 
detected in 18% (2/11) and 55% (6/11) of wet and dry season samples, 
respectively. Subsequently, molecular detection for Acanthamoeba species 
identified A. lenticulata and A. hatchetti with 98-99% BLAST similarity. This is 
the first report on the simultaneous contamination of Cryptosporidium and 
Acanthamoeba in well water sources in East-Southeast Asia, the first detection 
of Acanthamoeba spp. in biofilms in the Philippines, and the longest viability 
demonstrated for A. lenticulata in two-year-old water samples stored at room 
temperature.

BACKGROUND: Accelerated functional decline is a concern among older cancer 
survivors that threatens independence and quality of life. Pilot studies suggest 
that vegetable gardening interventions ameliorate functional decline through 
improved diet and physical activity.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this article was to describe the rationale, recruitment 
challenges, and enrollment for the Harvest for Health randomized controlled 
trial (RCT), which will test the impact of a home-based, vegetable gardening 
intervention on vegetable and fruit consumption, physical activity, and physical 
functioning among older cancer survivors. Modifications made to the intervention 
and assessments to assure safety and continuity of the RCT throughout the 
COVID-19 pandemic also are reported.
DESIGN: Harvest for Health is a 2-year, 2-arm, single-blinded, wait-list 
controlled RCT with cross-over.
PARTICIPANTS/SETTING: Medicare-eligible survivors of cancers with ≥60% 5-year 
survival were recruited across Alabama from October 1, 2016 to February 8, 2021.
INTERVENTION: Participants were randomly assigned to a wait-list control or a 
1-year home-based gardening intervention and individually mentored by 
extension-certified master gardeners to cultivate spring, summer, and fall 
vegetable gardens.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Although the RCT's primary end point was a composite 
measure of vegetable and fruit consumption, physical activity, and physical 
functioning, this article focuses on recruitment and modifications made to the 
intervention and assessments during COVID-19.
STATISTICAL ANALYSES PERFORMED: χ2 and t tests (α < .05) were used to compare 
enrolled vs unenrolled populations.
RESULTS: Older cancer survivors (n = 9,708) were contacted via mail and 
telephone; 1,460 indicated interest (15% response rate), 473 were screened 
eligible and consented, and 381 completed baseline assessments and were 
randomized. Enrollees did not differ from nonrespondents/refusals by race and 
ethnicity, or rural-urban status, but comprised significantly higher numbers of 
comparatively younger survivors, those who were female, and survivors of breast 
cancer (P < .001). Although COVID-19 delayed trial completion, protocol 
modifications overcame this barrier and study completion is anticipated by 
June 2022.
CONCLUSIONS: This RCT will provide evidence on the effects of a mentored 
vegetable gardening program among older cancer survivors. If efficacious, 
Harvest for Health represents a novel, multifaceted approach to improve 
lifestyle behaviors and health outcomes among cancer survivors-one with capacity 
for sustainability and widespread dissemination.

Higgins and colleagues' recently-completed randomized controlled trial and 
pooled data with 4 related trials of smoking cessation in pregnant women in 
Vermont (USA) showed that abstinence-contingent financial incentives (FI) 
increased abstinence over control conditions from early pregnancy through 
24-weeks postpartum. Control conditions were best practices (BP) alone in the 
recent trial and payments provided independent of smoking status 
(noncontingently) in the others. This paper reports economic analyses of 
abstinence-contingent FI. Merging trial results with maternal and infant 
healthcare costs from all Vermont Medicaid deliveries in 2019, we computed 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for quality-adjusted life years 
(QALYs) and compared them to established thresholds. The healthcare sector cost 
(±standard error) of adding FI to BP averaged $634.76 ± $531.61 per participant. 
Based on this trial, the increased probability per BP + FI participant of 
smoking abstinence at 24-weeks postpartum was 3.17%, the cost per additional 
abstinent woman was $20,043, the incremental health gain was 0.0270 ± 0.0412 
QALYs, the ICER was $23,511/QALY gained, and the probabilities that BP + FI was 
very cost-effective (ICER≤$65,910) and cost-effective (ICER≤$100,000) were 67.9% 
and 71.0%, respectively. Based on the pooled trials, the corresponding values 
were even more favorable-8.89%, $7138, 0.0758 ± 0.0178 QALYs, $8371/QALY, 98.6% 
and 99.3%, respectively. Each dollar invested in abstinence-contingent FI over 
control smoking-cessation programs yielded $4.20 in economic benefits in the 
recent trial and $11.90 in the pooled trials (very favorable benefit-cost 
ratios). Medicaid and commercial insurers may wish to consider covering 
financial incentives for smoking abstinence as a cost-effective service for 
pregnant beneficiaries who smoke. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov 
identifier: NCT02210832.

Adrenal insufficiency.

Adrenal insufficiency (AI), first described by Thomas Addison in 1855, is 
characterised by inadequate hormonal production by the adrenal gland, which 
could either be primary, due to destruction of the adrenal cortex, or 
secondary/tertiary, due to lack of adrenocorticotropic hormone or its 
stimulation by corticotropin-releasing hormone. This was an invariably fatal 
condition in Addison's days with most patients dying within a few years of 
diagnosis. However, discovery of cortisone in the 1940s not only improved the 
life expectancy of these patients but also had a dramatic effect on their 
overall quality of life. The diagnosis, easily confirmed by demonstrating 
inappropriately low cortisol secretion, is often delayed by months, and many 
patients present with acute adrenal crisis. Sudden withdrawal from chronic 
glucocorticoid therapy is the most common cause of AI. Currently, there remains 
a wide variation in the management of this condition across Europe. As primary 
AI is a relatively rare condition, most medical specialists will only manage a 
handful of these patients in their career. Despite many advances in recent 
years, there is currently no curative option, and modern cortisol replacement 
regimens fail to adequately mimic physiological cortisol rhythm. A number of new 
approaches including allograft of adrenocortical tissue and stem cell therapy 
are being tried but remain largely experimental.

Human longevity has increased dramatically during the past century. More than 
20% of the 9 billion population of the world will exceed the age of 60 in 2050. 
Since the last three decades, some interventions and many preclinical studies 
have been found to show slowing aging and increasing the healthy lifespan of 
organisms from yeast, flies, rodents to nonhuman primates. The interventions are 
classified into two groups: lifestyle modifications and pharmacological/genetic 
manipulations. Some genetic pathways have been characterized to have a specific 
role in controlling aging and lifespan. Thus, all genes in the pathways are 
potential antiaging targets. Currently, many antiaging compounds target the 
calorie-restriction mimetic, autophagy induction, and putative enhancement of 
cell regeneration, epigenetic modulation of gene activity such as inhibition of 
histone deacetylases and DNA methyltransferases, are under development. It 
appears evident that the exploration of new targets for these antiaging agents 
based on biogerontological research provides an incredible opportunity for the 
healthcare and pharmaceutical industries. The present review focus on the 
properties of slow aging and healthy life span extension of natural products 
from various biological resources, endogenous substances, drugs, and synthetic 
compounds, as well as the mechanisms of targets for antiaging evaluation. These 
bioactive compounds that could benefit healthy aging and the potential role of 
life span extension are discussed.

PURPOSE: As life expectancy for HIV patients improve, hepatocellular carcinoma 
(HCC) has become a non-AIDS defining illness with a high impact on morbidity and 
mortality of HIV-infected individuals. We sought to compare outcomes in HIV- 
versus non-HIV-infected patients treated for HCC at a multiethnic academic 
medical health system.
METHODS: A retrospective chart review of patients diagnosed with HCC from 
1/1/2005 to 12/31/2016 was performed. Differences in characteristics among HIV 
and non-HIV subjects were assessed. Associations between HIV status, viral load, 
CD4 count, and overall survival (OS) were also assessed.
RESULTS: We identified 915 subjects (842 non-HIV and 73 with HIV). HIV-infected 
subjects were younger, predominantly male non-Hispanic Blacks, and more likely 
to have HBV and HCV co-infection, and alcohol use at diagnosis compared to 
non-HIV counterparts. Stage, MELD score, Child-Pugh, and ECOG performance status 
were similar. HIV-positive patients received systemic therapy at significantly 
higher rates and liver transplantation for HCC at significantly lower rates than 
those without HIV. The actuarial 3- and 5-year overall survival (OS) for all 
patients was 48.3% and 39.4%. For HIV-infected subjects, 3- and 5-year OS was 
significantly worse at 36.8% and 28.3% compared to 49.3% and 40.4%, 
respectively, for non-HIV subjects (log rank p = 0.033).
CONCLUSIONS: HIV-infected HCC patients have lower survival rates compared to 
those without HIV. Despite younger age and similar stage, MELD, and ECOG at 
diagnosis, HIV portends worse outcomes in patients with HCC.

BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and nontraumatic lower-limb amputation 
(LLA) each results in reduced life expectancy in patients with type 1 diabetes, 
but the differential burden between these conditions is unknown. We compared the 
effects of CVD and LLA on the risk of mortality in people with type 1 diabetes.
