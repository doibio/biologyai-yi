disorders in the early postoperative period (before discharge from the hospital) 
was observed in 6% of patients (complete in 3%, partial in 3%). When evaluating 
the results of treatment 12 months after surgery, regression of neurological 
symptoms was observed in 19% of patients. At the same time, complete regression 
of neurological disorders occurred in 10%, partial in 9% of patients. When 
assessing the quality of life on the SF-36 scale, improvement was observed 
according to the most of the criteria. Also, in the postoperative period, there 
was a persistent decrease in the intensity of pain syndrome according to VAS 
compared with the preoperative level.
CONCLUSION: The use of 3-D video endoscopic technologies in the surgical 
treatment of patients with metastatic lesions of the spine made it possible to 
improve the quality of life of patients and reduce the number of complications.

Publisher: ЦЕЛЬ ИССЛЕДОВАНИЯ: Оценить результаты хирургического лечения 
пациентов с метастатическими поражениями позвоночника с применением 
3D-видеоэндоскопических технологий.
МАТЕРИАЛ И МЕТОДЫ: Проведен анализ результатов хирургического лечения 33 
пациентов с метастатическими поражениями грудного отдела позвоночника с 
применением 3D-видеоассистируемого торакоскопического вмешательства, получавших 
лечение в период с ноября 2017 г. по декабрь 2019 г. При обследовании пациентов 
использованы рентгенография позвоночника, мультиспиральная компьютерная 
томография (МСКТ), магнитно-резонансная томография (МРТ), а также шкалы SINS, 
Bilsky, Karnovsky, Tokuhashi, Frankel, SF-36 и VAS.
РЕЗУЛЬТАТЫ: Фактическая продолжительность жизни пациентов полностью совпала с 
прогнозируемой по шкале Tokuhashi. Регресс неврологических расстройств в раннем 
послеоперационном периоде (перед выпиской из стационара) отмечен у 6% пациентов 
(полный — у 3%, частичный — у 3%). При оценке результатов лечения через 12 мес 
после операции регресс неврологической симптоматики отмечен у 19% пациентов. При 
этом полный регресс неврологических расстройств имел место у 10% пациентов, 
частичный — у 9%. При оценке качества жизни по шкале SF-36 улучшение наблюдалось 
по большинству критериев. В послеоперационном периоде отмечено также стойкое 
снижение интенсивности болевого синдрома по VAS по сравнению с дооперационным 
уровнем.
ВЫВОДЫ: Применение 3D-видеоэндоскопических технологий в хирургическом лечении 
больных с метастатическими поражениями позвоночника позволило улучшить качество 
жизни пациентов и снизить количество послеоперационных осложнений.

Degenerative lumbar spine stenosis is one of the main causes of chronic pain and 
radiculopathy in advanced age people. Along with increase in average life 
expectancy, degenerative lumbar spine stenosis becomes the most common 
indication for spinal surgery. There is still no consensus regarding the most 
optimal surgical approach due to the variety of modern surgical methods. In 
recent years, minimally invasive spinal surgery has become a more advisable 
alternative to open surgery due to its advanced technical features combined with 
less soft tissue damage, lower risk of complications and shorter postoperative 
recovery.

Publisher: Дегенеративный стеноз поясничного отдела позвоночника является одной 
из ведущих причин хронической боли и радикулопатии у пожилых людей. С 
увеличением средней продолжительности жизни данная патология становится наиболее 
распространенным показанием к операции на позвоночнике. В связи с многообразием 
существующих методов хирургического лечения до сих пор нет консенсуса по выбору 
оптимальной тактики. В последние годы минимально инвазивная хирургия 
позвоночника представляется обоснованной альтернативой открытой хирургии 
благодаря своей технологичности в сочетании со снижением объема повреждения 
мягких тканей, меньшим риском развития осложнений и сокращением времени 
восстановления пациента в послеоперационном периоде.

Exploring Mothers' Experience of a Linguistic Feedback Technology for Children 
at Risk of Poor Language Development: Qualitative Pilot Study.

BACKGROUND: The early language environment is important for language development 
and a child's life-course trajectory. Risk factors associated with poor language 
development outcomes in children include maternal anxiety and depression, low 
educational attainment, substance misuse, and low socioeconomic status. Language 
Environment Analysis (LENA) is a wearable technology designed to promote 
caregivers' engagement in supporting their children's language development. LENA 
provides quantitative linguistic feedback, which has been shown to improve 
caregiver language output, thus enhancing a child's language environment. There 
is limited research on the uptake of this technology by families with 
developmentally at-risk children.
OBJECTIVE: This qualitative study aims to explore the conditions under which 
mothers with children at risk of poor developmental outcomes are willing to 
adopt the use of LENA to monitor and improve caregiver language output.
METHODS: Using a qualitative interpretive design, semistructured, in-depth 
interviews were conducted with 8 mothers. Participants were recruited 
purposively to select the maximal variation of socioeconomic and 
ethnodemographic backgrounds. The transcribed interview data were analyzed 
thematically and interpretatively. Themes were mapped abductively to an extended 
Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology, which included contextual 
factors for LENA acceptance.
RESULTS: Factors that influenced the intention to use LENA included both 
technology-specific acceptance factors and contextual factors. Technology 
acceptance themes included reassurance, feeling overwhelmed, and trust. These 
themes were mapped to performance expectancy, effort expectancy, and social 
influence. Contextual themes included emergent success and the intrusion of past 
difficulties. These were mapped to parenting self-efficacy and perceived risk. 
The theme of building on success described behavioral intention. Mothers were 
more likely to adopt LENA when the technology was viewed as acceptable, and this 
was influenced by parenting self-efficacy and perceived risk.
CONCLUSIONS: LENA is a technology that is acceptable to mothers with children 
who are at risk of poor language development outcomes. Further studies are 
needed to establish LENA's effectiveness as an adjunct to strategies to enrich a 
child's early language environment.

Erratum in
    Arch Virol. 2021 Nov 17;:

In March 2021, following the annual International Committee on Taxonomy of 
Viruses (ICTV) ratification vote on newly proposed taxa, the phylum 
Negarnaviricota was amended and emended. The phylum was expanded by four 
families (Aliusviridae, Crepuscuviridae, Myriaviridae, and Natareviridae), three 
subfamilies (Alpharhabdovirinae, Betarhabdovirinae, and Gammarhabdovirinae), 42 
genera, and 200 species. Thirty-nine species were renamed and/or moved and seven 
species were abolished. This article presents the updated taxonomy of 
Negarnaviricota as now accepted by the ICTV.

home residents.

WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE: Anticoagulants are indicated for treatment and 
prevention of several clinical conditions. Prior studies have examined 
anticoagulant utilization for specific indications and in community-dwelling 
populations. Decision-making regarding anticoagulant prescribing in the nursing 
home setting is particularly challenging because advanced age and clinical 
complexity places most residents at increased risk for adverse drug events. To 
estimate the prevalence of oral anticoagulant (OAC) use (overall, warfarin, 
direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs)) and identify factors associated with oral 
anticoagulant use among the general population of residents living in nursing 
homes.
METHODS: This point prevalence study was conducted among 506,482 residents in US 
nursing homes on 31 October 2016 who were enrolled in Medicare fee-for-service. 
Covariates including demographics, clinical conditions, medications, cognitive 
impairment and functional status were obtained from Minimum Data Set 3.0 
assessments and Medicare Part A and D claims. Oral anticoagulant use was 
identified using dispensing dates and days supply information from Medicare Part 
D claims. Robust Poisson models estimated adjusted prevalence ratios (aPR) for 
associations between covariates and 1) any anticoagulant use, and 2) DOAC versus 
warfarin use.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Overall, 11.8% of residents used oral anticoagulants. 
Among users, 44.3% used DOACs. Residents with body mass index (BMI) ≥40 kg/m2 
(aPR: 1.66; 95% CI: 1.61 -1.71), with functional dependency in activities of 
daily living, polypharmacy and higher CHA2 DS2 -VASc risk ischaemic stroke 
scores, had a higher prevalence of oral anticoagulant use. Women (aPR: 0.78; 95% 
CI: 0.76-0.79), residents with limited life expectancy (aPR 0.80; 95% CI: 
0.76-0.83), those with moderate-to-severe cognitive impairment (aPR: 0.67; 95% 
CI: 0.65-0.68), those using NSAIDs or antiplatelets, and non-white racial/ethnic 
groups had a lower prevalence of anticoagulant use. Residents with higher levels 
of polypharmacy, BMI and age had a lower prevalence of DOAC use (versus 
warfarin).
WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: Approximately one in eight general nursing home 
residents use oral anticoagulants and among oral anticoagulant users, only 
slightly more residents used warfarin than DOACs. The lower prevalence of 
anticoagulation among women and non-white racial/ethnic groups raises concerns 
of potential inequities in quality of care. Lower oral anticoagulant use among 
residents with limited life expectancy suggests possible deprescribing at the 
end of life. Further research is needed to inform resident-centred shared 
decision-making that explicitly considers treatment goals and 
individual-specific risks and benefits of anticoagulation at all stages of the 
medication use continuum.

STUDY OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the ultrasound features, types, and degrees of 
adenomyosis among adolescents and to correlate these findings with clinical 
symptoms DESIGN: A retrospective observational study.
SETTING: Gynecological ultrasound units from January 2014 to June 2020.
PATIENTS: A total of 43 adolescents (aged 12-20 years) who were diagnosed as 
having adenomyosis at a pelvic ultrasound examination.
INTERVENTIONS: Ultrasound features and location and type of adenomyosis within 
the uterus were evaluated on stored 2-dimensional images and videos and 
3-dimensional volumes. Adenomyosis was classified as mild, moderate, and severe 
according to the extension of the disease in the uterus as described in our 
previous published classification.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Adenomyotic features recorded among our 
population were myometrial hyperechoic areas, uterine wall asymmetry, 
intramyometrial cystic areas, and some types of junctional zone alterations. The 
posterior uterine wall (58%) and the outer myometrial layer (93%) were mostly 
affected. In 44% of adolescents (19/43) with adenomyosis, at least 1 location of 
pelvic endometriosis was documented. Dysmenorrhea was the most commonly reported 
symptoms (88%), and it was associated with adenomyosis of the outer myometrium, 
myometrial hyperechoic areas, uterine wall asymmetry, and intramyometrial cystic 
areas. Adolescents with dyspareunia showed diffuse adenomyosis (9/9 patients) 
including both the inner and outer myometrium (7/9 patients) and in the 
posterior wall (7/9 patients). Heavy menstrual bleeding was associated with 
diffuse adenomyosis (18/23 patients) mostly of the outer myometrium (22/23 
patients). Scoring system showed predominantly mild disease and no severe 
adenomyosis was found. Adolescents with diffuse adenomyosis were significantly 
older and showed a high percentage of heavy menstrual bleeding compared with 
those with the focal disease of the inner myometrium.
CONCLUSION: This study shows that adenomyosis is not only a pathology of adult 
life, but it involves young patients mostly in a mild-to-moderate form and is 
associated with typical painful symptoms. In adolescents, the diagnosis of 
adenomyosis is feasible through a noninvasive way with ultrasound and a proper 
management can be set.

Challenging anticoagulation cases: Acute extensive portal vein thrombosis in a 
patient without cirrhosis - Evidence-based management of a rare clinical entity.

University Health Centre, Canada.

Acute non-cirrhotic and non-malignant portal vein thrombosis (aPVT) is a rare 
and heterogenous condition. Current guidelines recommend early initiation of 
therapeutic anticoagulation to prevent extension of thrombosis, and favor 
recanalization. Although not formally defined, a poor outcome in the acute 
setting would include thrombosis extension with progression to intestinal 
infarction. Patients are also at risk of negative long-term outcomes related to 
complications of portal hypertension, such as variceal bleeding, ascites, and 
portal cholangiopathy. Identifying patients at risk of these events despite 
early initiation of anticoagulation remains challenging. Trials comparing 
treatment strategies in those failing standard therapy with meaningful 
radiological and clinical endpoints, whether in the short or long term, are 
desperately needed. The objective of this review will be to discuss a real-life 
clinical case and propose a treatment approach for aPVT based on the available 
evidence. We will mainly focus on management strategies including 
anticoagulation, prognostic factors, and options beyond anticoagulation, such as 
thrombolysis, thrombectomy, and transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts. 
This review will not cover tumor portal vein thrombosis or thrombosis associated 
with cirrhosis.

AIMS: Present cost-effectiveness analysis of nivolumab monotherapy vs. commonly 
prescribed third-line (3 L+) treatment in small cell lung cancer (SCLC).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A three health states partitioned survival model 
(progression-free, progressed disease, and death; US payer perspective) was 
developed. The systematic literature review identified no randomized controlled 
or single-arm trials with separate outcomes for 3 L + SCLC patients. Topotecan 
was chosen as a comparator because it is frequently prescribed in real-world 
practice for 3 L SCLC. Clinical inputs for topotecan were derived from the 
Flatiron database with inclusion/exclusion criteria matched to patients treated 
with 3 L + nivolumab in CheckMate 032. Intravenous (IV) and oral topotecan 
clinical efficacy were assumed equivalent. Base-case analysis used a 20-year 
lifetime horizon. An annual discount rate of 3.0% for costs and outcomes was 
applied. Uncertainty was assessed using sensitivity analyses adjusted for key 
parameters.
RESULTS: Incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained with 
nivolumab was US$153,312 vs. IV topotecan and US$123,003 vs. oral topotecan, 
respectively. When results were disaggregated, nivolumab-related costs were 
mainly driven by drug acquisition costs, and topotecan-related costs were 
primarily due to adverse event treatment. Mean overall survival (OS) was 
21.69 months with nivolumab and 5.80 months with IV or oral topotecan. More 
favorable outcomes were found by the landmark response analyses. Deterministic 
sensitivity analyses showed that changes to the discount rate for costs and 
outcomes and body weight had the greatest impacts on results.
LIMITATIONS: Included use of real-world data for OS outcomes associated with 3 L 
topotecan, use of second-line topotecan data for progression-free survival, and 
no indirect costs.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on the literature on willingness-to-pay for a QALY in 
metastatic cancer, nivolumab monotherapy might represent a cost-effective option 
for 3 L + treatment of SCLC compared with IV and oral topotecan. Sensitivity 
analysis using response-based methods yielded further favorable 
cost-effectiveness estimates.

Durability of transcatheter heart valve (THV) is critical as the indication of 
transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) expands to patients with longer 
life-expectancy. We aimed to compare the durability of different THV systems 
(balloon-expandable [BE] and self-expandable [SE]) and surgical aortic valve 
replacement (SAVR) prosthesis. PUBMED and EMBASE were searched through February 
2021 for randomized trials investigating parameters of valve durability after 
TAVI and/or SAVR in severe aortic stenosis. A network meta-analysis using 
random-effect model was performed. Synthesis was performed with 5-year follow-up 
data for echocardiographic outcomes and the longest available follow-up data for 
clinical outcomes. Ten trials with a total of 9,388 patients (BE-THV: 2,562; 
SE-THV: 2,863; SAVR: 3,963) were included. Follow-up ranged from 1 to 6 years. 
SE-THV demonstrated significantly larger effective orifice area, lower mean 
aortic valve gradient (AVG), and less increase in mean AVG at 5-year compared 
with BE-THV and SAVR. Structural valve deterioration (SVD) was less frequent in 
SE-THV compared with BE-THV and SAVR (HR 0.14, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.27; HR 0.34, 95% 
CI 0.24 to 0.47, respectively). Total moderate-severe aortic regurgitation and 
reintervention was more frequent in BE-THV (HR 4.21, 95% CI 2.40 to 7.39; HR 
2.22, 95% CI 1.16 to 4.26, respectively), and SE-THV (HR 7.51, 95% CI 3.89 to 
14.5; HR 2.86, 95% CI 1.59 to 5.13, respectively) compared with SAVR. In 
conclusion, TAVI with SE-THV demonstrated favorable forward-flow hemodynamics 
and lowest risk of SVD compared with BE-THV and SAVR at mid-term. However, both 
THV systems suffer an increased risk of AR and re-intervention, and long-term 
data from newer generation valves is warranted.
