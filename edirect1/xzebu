group in comparison to the GA group (p = 0.037). In the SA and GA groups, the 
survival rate at 3 months postoperatively was 98.4% and 95.5%, respectively. The 
incidence of postoperative pneumonia was significantly higher in the GA 
(p = 0.012), and PMS at 3 months postoperatively was significantly higher in the 
SA group (p = 0.016).
CONCLUSION: The survival rate of elderly patients who underwent cemented HA was 
better in the SA group. General anaesthesia in cemented HA may be associated 
with lower life expectancy, increased incidence of pneumonia, and decreased 
walking ability.

BACKGROUND: Countries using cost effectiveness ratio as a decision tool for 
price and reimbursement decisions still witness accelerating price increases. 
The objective of this paper is to propose a change in the application of the 
incremental cost effectiveness ratio as a criterion for price policy.
RESEARCH DESIGN: We develop a model that sets a price for marginal effectiveness 
equal to the marginal willingness to pay, but it reimburses average 
effectiveness according to the size of increased QALY gain.
RESULTS: This new formula also allows to split the economic value of drug 
between patients and the industry and creates a reward to invest into QALY 
gains. We show some empirical data of the new prices derived from the 
application of the new formula, as well as the implications in terms of the 
consumer and manufacturer´s surplus based on two potential scenarios of the 
incentives generated by this new formulation.
DISCUSSION: We propose that small increases in life expectancy be priced 
differently from substantial as a way of containing the price dynamics.
CONCLUSIONS: A change in the application of the ICER threshold will help to 
reduce the price pressure on public budgets.

Home non-invasive mechanical ventilation (HMV) with home oxygen therapy (HOT) in 
patients with persistent hypercapnia following an acute exacerbation of chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease delays hospital readmission. The economic impact 
of this treatment is unknown. We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of HMV in the 
UK healthcare system using data from a previously published efficacy trial. 
Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were computed from EQ-5D-5L. Accounting for 
all direct patient costs HOT-HMV was £512 (95%CI £36 to £990) more expensive per 
patient per year than HOT-alone. This small increase in cost was accompanied by 
increased quality of life leading to an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 
£10 259 per QALY. HOT-HMV was cost-effective in this clinical population. Trial 
registration number: NCT00990132.

BACKGROUND: In recent years, significant advances have been made in the field of 
rare diseases (RDs). However, there is a large number of RDs without specific 
treatment and half of these treatments have public funding in Spain. The aim of 
the FINEERR project was to carry out a multidisciplinary strategic discussion on 
the challenge of funding and access to RD-targeted drugs in Spain, in order to 
agree on specific proposals for medium-term improvement and hence support 
decision-making in the Spanish National Healthcare System (SNHS).
RESULTS: The FINEERR Project was organized around a CORE Advisory Committee, 
which provided an overview, agreed on the design and scope of the project, and 
selected the members within each of four working groups (WG). Overall, 40 
experts discussed and reached a consensus on different relevant aspects, such as 
conditioning factors for initial funding and access, evaluation and access to 
RD-targeted therapies, funding of these therapies, and implementation of a new 
funding and access model. From these meetings, 50 proposals were defined and 
classified by their level of relevance according to the experts. A descriptive 
analysis of responses was performed for each proposal. Thereafter, experts 
completed another questionnaire where they ranked the 25 most relevant proposals 
according to their level of feasibility of being implemented in the SNHS. The 
most relevant and feasible proposals were to improve: process of referral of 
patients with RDs, control over monitoring mechanisms, and communication between 
healthcare professionals and patients.
CONCLUSIONS: The FINEERR project may provide a starting point for stakeholders 
involved in the process of funding and access to RD-targeted therapies in Spain 
to provide the necessary resources and implement measures to improve both the 
quality of life and life expectancy of patients with RDs.

BACKGROUND: The impact of solid fuel use on life expectancy (LE) in 
less-developed countries remains unclear. We aimed to evaluate the potential 
impact of household solid fuel use on LE in the rural and urban Chinese 
population, with the effect of smoking as a reference.
METHODS: We used data from China Kadoorie Biobank (CKB) of 484,915 participants 
aged 30-79 free of coronary heart disease, stroke, or cancer at baseline. 
Analyses were performed separately for solid fuel use for cooking, solid fuel 
use for heating, and smoking, with participants exposed to the other two sources 
excluded. Solid fuels refer to coal and wood, and clean fuels refer to 
electricity, gas, and central heating. We used a flexible parametric 
Royston-Parmar model to estimate hazard ratios of all-cause mortality and 
predict LE at age 30.
FINDINGS: Totally, 185,077, 95,228, and 230,995 participants were included in 
cooking-, heating-, and smoking-related analyses, respectively. During a median 
follow-up of approximately 12.1 years, 12,725, 7,531, and 18,878 deaths were 
recorded in the respective analysis. Compared with clean fuel users who reported 
cooking with ventilation, participants who used solid fuels with ventilation and 
without ventilation had a difference in LE (95% confidence interval [CI]) at age 
30 of -1.72 (-2.88, -0.57) and -2.62 (-4.16, -1.05) years for men and -1.33 
(-1.85, -0.81) and -1.35 (-2.02, -0.67) years for women, respectively. The 
difference in LE (95% CI) for heating was -2.23 (-3.51, -0.95) years for men 
and -1.28 (-2.08, -0.48) years for women. In rural men, the LE reduction (95% 
CI) related to solid fuel use for cooking (-2.55; -4.51, -0.58) or heating 
(-3.26; -6.09, 0.44) was more than that related to smoking 
(-1.71; -2.54, -0.89). Conversely, in urban men, the LE reduction (95% CI) 
related to smoking (-3.06; -3.56, -2.56) was more than that related to solid 
fuel use for cooking (-1.28; -2.61, 0.05) and heating (-1.90; -3.16, -0.65). 
Similar results were observed in women but with a smaller magnitude.
INTERPRETATION: In this Chinese population, the harm to LE from household use of 
solid fuels was greater than that from smoking in rural residents. Conversely, 
the negative impact of smoking was greater than solid fuel use in urban 
residents. Our findings highlight the complexity and diversity of the factors 
affecting LE in less-developed populations.

Background Elderly migraine is a public health problem with prolonged life 
expectancy, and effective prophylactic treatment is needed. There were no 
reports on fremanezumab for the elderly. We described the real-world data of 
fremanezumab, calcitonin gene-related peptide-related monoclonal antibody 
(CGRP-mAB), for migraine in elderly over 70 years old. Methods We 
retrospectively investigated six elderly migraine patients over 70 years old 
treated with fremanezumab. Headache impact test-6 (HIT-6), monthly headache days 
(MHD), and monthly acute medication intake days (AMD) before one and three 
months after starting fremanezumab treatment were evaluated. Results Three women 
and three men (median age 78; range: 71-99) were included. One was chronic 
migraine (CM), three were CM and medication-overuse headache, and two were 
episodic migraine and tension-type headache. All six patients received monthly 
fremanezumab. The median MHD before, during one, and three months after 
treatment were 30 (4-30), 30 (4-30), and 29 (15-30, n=4). Those of AMD were 17 
(0-30), 9.5 (0-30), and 1 (0-28). Those about HIT-6 were 64 (56-72), 59.5 
(52-70), and 55.5 (48-64). Two (33.3%) of the six patients experienced 
therapeutic effectiveness. There were no side effects. Conclusion We described 
the six elderly migraine patients aged over 70 years old treated with 
fremanezumab. Two (33.3%) of the six patients experienced therapeutic 
effectiveness. This is the first report of fremanezumab for elderly migraine 
patients aged over 70 years old. Further evidence accumulation is needed about 
CGRP-mABs for the elderly.

The discovery of proteinaceous infectious agents by Prusiner in 1982 was 
sensational. All previously known pathogens contained nucleic acids, the code of 
life, that enabled them to reproduce. In contrast, the proteinaceous agents of 
disease, called prion proteins (PrP), lacked nucleic acids and propagated by 
binding to the functional, endogenous form of cellular prion protein (referred 
to as PrPC) and altering its conformation to produce the infectious 
disease-causing misfolded protein (referred to as PrPSc). The accumulation and 
aggregation of these infectious prion proteins within the brain cause 
destruction of neural tissue and lead to fatal spongiform encephalopathies. In 
this review, we present the molecular pathology of prion-based diseases. These 
insights are of particular importance since the principles of prion pathogenesis 
apply to other neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, 
Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. 
Collectively, the global prevalence of these diseases is rapidly increasing 
while effective therapies against them are still lacking. Thus, the need to 
understand their etiology and pathogenesis is urgent, and it holds profound 
implications for societal health.

SCOPE: This study investigates the effect of epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) on 
white and beige preadipocyte growth and explores the involvement of the 
miR-let-7a/HMGA2 pathway.
METHODS AND RESULTS: 3T3-L1 and D12 cells are treated with EGCG. The effect of 
EGCG on cell proliferation and viability is evaluated, as well as microRNA 
(miRNA)-related signaling pathways. EGCG inhibits 3T3-L1 and D12 preadipocyte 
growth, upregulates miR-let-7a expression, and downregulates high-mobility group 
AT-hook 2 (HMGA2) mRNA and protein levels in a time- and dose-dependent manner. 
In addition, overexpression of miR-let-7a significantly inhibits the growth of 
3T3-L1 and D12 cells and decreases HMGA2 mRNA and protein levels. MiR-let-7a 
inhibitor antagonizes the inhibitory effects of EGCG on the number and viability 
of 3T3-L1 and D12 cells. Furthermore, miR-let-7a inhibitor reverses the 
EGCG-induced increase in miR-let-7a expression levels and decrease in HMGA2 mRNA 
and protein levels. HMGA2 overexpression induces an increase in cell number and 
viability and antagonizes EGCG-suppressed cell growth and HMGA2 expression in 
3T3-L1 and D12 preadipocytes.
CONCLUSION: EGCG inhibits the growth of 3T3-L1 and D12 preadipocytes by 
modulating the miR-let-7a and HMGA2 pathways.

Bipolar disorders (BDs) are a heterogeneous group of severe affective disorders 
generally described by the alternation of (hypo)manic, depressive, and mixed 
phases, with euthymic intervals of variable duration. BDs are burdened with high 
psychiatric and physical comorbidity, increased suicide risk and reduced life 
expectancy. In addition, BDs can progress into complicated forms (e.g., mixed 
states, rapid/irregular cycling), which are more difficult to treat and often 
require personalized pharmacological combinations. Mood stabilizers, 
particularly Lithium and Valproic acid (VPA), still represent the cornerstones 
of both acute and chronic pharmacotherapies of BDs. Lithium is the gold standard 
in BD-I and BDII with typical features, while VPA seems more effective for 
atypical forms (e.g., mixed-prevalence and rapid-cycling). However, despite 
appropriate mood stabilization, many patients show residual symptoms, and more 
than a half recur within 1-2 years, highlighting the need of additional 
strategies. Among these, the association of atypical antipsychotics (AAPs) with 
mood stabilizers is recurrent in the treatment of acute phases, but it is also 
being growingly explored in the maintenance pharmacotherapy. These combinations 
are clinically more aggressive and often needed in the acute phases, whereas 
simplifying pharmacotherapies to mood stabilizers only is preferable in the 
long-term, whenever possible. When mood stabilizers are not enough for 
maintenance treatment, Quetiapine and, less consistently, Aripiprazole have been 
proposed as the most advisable adjunctive strategies, for their safety and 
tolerability profiles. However, in view of the increased risk of serious adverse 
effects, a careful patient-centered balance between costs and benefits is 
mandatory.

INTRODUCTION: Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a genetic disorder caused by a 
mutation in the NF1 gene. This disease presents with various system-based 
manifestations, including cardiac, musculoskeletal, and neuronal issues, which 
have been well-studied in previous research and have prompted the development of 
current and emerging treatments. These treatments, mainly medications targeting 
specific manifestations of NF1, aim to mitigate the negative impacts of the 
disease on patients' lives. NF1 is associated with an increased risk of 
malignancy and a significant decrease in life expectancy. In this paper, we 
review the current and emerging treatments for NF1 in relation to its 
system-based manifestations.
METHODS: We conducted an extensive literature search using specific keywords 
through databases such as PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane. The articles we found 
were compiled and subjected to strict inclusion and exclusion criteria.
RESULTS: Pharmacological advances have led to the development of products that 
hold promise as future treatments for NF1. Given the diverse manifestations that 
can affect multiple organ systems in patients with NF1, it is important to 
consider a variety of treatment options to achieve optimal results. However, one 
of the major challenges in diagnosing and treating NF1 is that patients present 
asymptomatically, making it necessary to rely on clinical features for 
diagnosis.
CONCLUSION: In conclusion, NF1 is a complex disease with varying manifestations 
and a growing field of pharmacologic treatments. The information presented in 
this article synthesizes current knowledge and available therapies for NF1.

With the increase in the population's life expectancy, there has also been an 
increase in the rate of osteoporosis, which has expanded the search for 
strategies to regenerate bone tissue. The ultrasonic sonochemical technique was 
chosen for the functionalization of the 45S5 bioglass. The samples after the 
sonochemical process were divided into (a) functionalized bioglass (BG) and (b) 
functionalized bioglass with 10% teriparatide (BGT). Isolated mesenchymal cells 
(hMSC) from femurs of ovariectomized rats were differentiated into osteoblasts 
and submitted to in vitro tests. Bilateral ovariectomy (OVX) and sham 
ovariectomy (Sham) surgeries were performed in fifty-five female Wistar rats. 
After a period of 60 days, critical bone defects of 5.0 mm were created in the 
calvaria of these animals. For biomechanical evaluation, critical bone defects 
of 3.0 mm were performed in the tibias of some of these rats. The groups were 
divided into the clot (control) group, the BG group, and the BGT group. After 
the sonochemical process, the samples showed modified chemical topographic and 
morphological characteristics, indicating that the surface was chemically 
altered by the functionalization of the particles. The cell environment was 
conducive to cell adhesion and differentiation, and the BG and BGT groups did 
not show cytotoxicity. In addition, the experimental groups exhibited 
characteristics of new bone formation with the presence of bone tissue in both 
periods, with the BGT group and the OVX group statistically differing from the 
other groups (p < 0.05) in both periods. Local treatment with the drug 
teriparatide in ovariectomized animals promoted positive effects on bone tissue, 
and longitudinal studies should be carried out to provide additional information 
on the biological performance of the mutual action between the bioglass and the 
release of the drug teriparatide.

last decades, due to pandemic situations such as H1N1, MERS-CoV, and 
SARS-COVID-19.
PATIENT CONCERNS: The impact of viral infection on lung structure, lung 
function, and overall mortality was significant. The quality of life and assumed 
life expectancy was decreased with the supposed development of lung fibrosis in 
involved survived patients.
DIAGNOSES: We described the course and treatment of severe pneumonia H1N1 in a 
30-year-old patient.
INTERVENTIONS: Patient was included in a study regarding the therapeutic 
efficacy of selenium ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT02026856 with 10 years follow-up 
with concurrently documented X-ray lung examinations and final histology of lung 
tissue after sudden death.
OUTCOMES: All sequential examinations and histological findings show a healing 
trend with the final full recovery of lung tissue.

BACKGROUND: Undernutrition is a frequent and serious problem in the world's 
older adults. Even though life expectancy is increasing, they are more 
vulnerable and at risk for nutritional problems. However, not much is known 
about the nutritional status of this group of the population, and they are often 
neglected.
OBJECTIVE: This study was aimed at assessing undernutrition and associated 
factors among older adults in Womberma District, West Gojjam Zone, Amhara 
Region, Ethiopia, 2020.
METHODS: A community-based cross-sectional study design was used among randomly 
selected 594 older adults aged above 60 years with a multistage simple random 
sampling method and proportional sample size allocation was used to address 
study subjects at the village level. The collected data was entered into 
Epi-Data version 4.2 and analyzed by using SPSS version 25. All variables with a 
p-value<0.25 in the bivariable analysis were considered for multivariable 
logistic regression for further analysis and the level of statistical 
significance was declared at p-value<0. 05.
RESULTS: The prevalence of undernutrition among older adults was found to be 
14.6% (95%CI: 11.9-17.7). A number of independent variables have a significant 
association with undernutrition, including gender, females [(AOR (95%CI): 3.14 
(1.50-6.54)], age (Oldest Old [AOR (95%CI): 4.91 (2.44-6.08)] and Middle Old, 
[AOR (95%CI): 2.96 (1.44-6.08)], meal frequency [AOR (95%CI): 2.01 (1.12 
(1.04-3.63)], dietary diversity score [AOR (95%CI): 2.92 (1.54-5.53)], 
depression [AOR (95%CI): 5.22 (3-9.07)], individuals with a sickness in the last 
4 weeks [AOR (95%CI): 2.12 (1.02-4.41)] and individuals with a known hemorrhoid 
[AOR (95%CI): 3.51 (1.12-10.97)].
CONCLUSION: This study found that the prevalence of undernutrition in older 
adults is high and needs attention. Sex, age, meal frequency, dietary diversity, 
being sick in the last 4 weeks, having hemorrhoids, and depression were the 
associated risk factors. Therefore, the government, family members, and other 
stakeholders should give more attention to older individuals.

The lethal and histopathological impacts of crude oil's Water-Soluble Fraction 
(WSF) on the liver and kidney tissues of juvenile Rutilus frisii were 
investigated. The LC50 96 h of WSF was calculated at 33.95 ppm. Fish exposed to 
two concentrations (0.1 LC50 and LC50) of WSF and control for 24 and 96 h were 
used for histopathological studies. Tissues in the control group and 0.1 
LC50-24 h were healthy, and no specific damages were observed. With increasing 
exposure time (96 h) and concentration (LC50), damages' type, frequency, and 
intensity gradually increased. Cloudy swelling, loss of cell boundary, nuclei 
deformation, and congestion of blood vessels were found in the liver, enlarged 
glomeruli, reduced Bowman's space, and occlusion of the tubular lumen, were 
found in the kidney. It is demonstrated that the WSF of crude oil can cause 
severe damage to the tissues of juvenile Kutum, depending on the exposure 
concentration.

BACKGROUND:  The global trend toward increased life expectancy because of 
remarkable improvements in health care quality has drawn increased attention to 
osteoporotic fractures and degenerative spine diseases. Cement-augmented pedicle 
screw fixation has been established as the mainstay treatment for patients with 
poor bone quality. This study aimed to determine the number of patients with 
cement leakage and pulmonary cement embolism (PCE) as detected on thoracic 
computed tomography (CT), and to assess the potential risk factors for PCE.
METHODS:  Patients undergoing cement-augmented pedicle screw placement in our 
institution between May 2008 and December 2020 were included. Data regarding 
baseline characteristics, complications, and cement leakage rates were 
collected. Indications for the performance of a postoperative thoracic CT due to 
the suspicion of PCE were intra- or postoperative complications, or 
postoperative oxygen supplementation. Moreover, PCE was accidently diagnosed 
because the thoracic CT was performed for medical reasons other than the 
suspicion of PCE (tumor staging, severe pneumonia, or exacerbated chronic 
pulmonary obstructive disease).
RESULTS:  A total of 104 patients with a mean age of 72.8 years (standard 
deviation of 6.7) were included. Of 802 screws, 573 were cement augmented. Of 
the 104 patients, 44 (42.3%) underwent thoracic CT scans to diagnose PCE; 
additionally, 67 (64.4%) demonstrated cement leakage, of whom 27 developed PCE 
and 4 were symptomatic. Cement-augmented thoracic screws were a risk factor for 
PCE (odds ratio: 1.5; 95% confidence interval: 1.2-2.1; p = 0.004).
CONCLUSIONS:  This study showed a high prevalence of cement leakage after 
cement-augmented pedicle screw insertion, with a relatively frequent incidence 
of PCE, as tracked by thoracic CT scans. Cement-augmented thoracic screw 
placement was a unique risk factor for PCE.

Non-optimal temperatures are associated with premature deaths globally. However, 
the evidence is limited in low- and middle-income countries, and the 
productivity losses due to non-optimal temperatures have not been quantified. We 
aimed to estimate the work-related impacts and economic losses attributable to 
non-optimal temperatures in Brazil. We collected daily mortality data from 510 
immediate regions in Brazil during 2000 and 2019. A two-stage time-series 
analysis was applied to evaluate the association between non-optimum 
temperatures and the Productivity-Adjusted Life-Years (PALYs) lost. The 
temperature-PALYs association was fitted for each location in the first stage 
and then we applied meta-analyses to obtain the national estimations. The 
attributable fraction (AF) of PALY lost due to ambient temperatures and the 
corresponding economic costs were calculated for different subgroups of the 
working-age population. A total of 3,629,661 of PALYs lost were attributed to 
non-optimal temperatures during 2000-2019 in Brazil, corresponding to 2.90 % 
(95 % CI: 1.82 %, 3.95 %) of the total PALYs lost. Non-optimal temperatures have 
led to US$104.86 billion (95 % CI: 65.95, 142.70) of economic costs related to 
PALYs lost and the economic burden was more substantial in males and the 
population aged 15-44 years. Higher risks of extreme cold temperatures were 
observed in the South region in Brazil while extreme hot temperatures were 
observed in the Central West and Northeast regions. In conclusion, non-optimal 
temperatures are associated with considerable labour losses as well as economic 
costs in Brazil. Tailored policies and adaptation strategies should be proposed 
to mitigate the impacts of non-optimal temperatures on the labour supply in a 
changing climate.

The Blood Profiling Atlas in Cancer (BLOODPAC) Consortium is a collaborative 
effort involving stakeholders from the public, industry, academia, and 
regulatory agencies focused on developing shared best practices on liquid 
biopsy. This report describes the results from the JFDI (Just Freaking Do It) 
study, a BLOODPAC initiative to develop standards on the use of contrived 
materials mimicking cell-free circulating tumor DNA, to comparatively evaluate 
clinical laboratory testing procedures. Nine independent laboratories tested the 
concordance, sensitivity, and specificity of commercially available contrived 
materials with known variant-allele frequencies (VAFs) ranging from 0.1% to 
5.0%. Each participating laboratory utilized its own proprietary evaluation 
procedures. The results demonstrated high levels of concordance and sensitivity 
at VAFs of >0.1%, but reduced concordance and sensitivity at a VAF of 0.1%; 
these findings were similar to those from previous studies, suggesting that 
commercially available contrived materials can support the evaluation of testing 
procedures across multiple technologies. Such materials may enable more 
objective comparisons of results on materials formulated in-house at each center 
in multicenter trials. A unique goal of the collaborative effort was to develop 
a data resource, the BLOODPAC Data Commons, now available to the liquid-biopsy 
community for further study. This resource can be used to support independent 
evaluations of results, data extension through data integration and new studies, 
and retrospective evaluation of data collection.

BACKGROUND: Streptococcus pneumoniae (Pneumococcus) has remained a leading cause 
of fatal infections such as pneumonia, meningitis, and sepsis. Moreover, this 
pathogen plays a major role in bacterial co-infection in patients with 
life-threatening respiratory virus diseases such as influenza and COVID-19. High 
morbidity and mortality in over one million cases, especially in very young 
children and the elderly, are the main motivations for pneumococcal vaccine 
development. Due to the limitations of the currently marketed 
polysaccharide-based vaccines, non-serotype-specific protein-based vaccines have 
received wide research interest in recent years. One step further is to identify 
high antigenic regions within multiple highly-conserved proteins in order to 
develop peptide vaccines that can affect various stages of pneumococcal 
infection, providing broader serotype coverage and more effective protection. In 
this study, immunoinformatics tools were used to design an effective 
multi-epitope vaccine in order to elicit neutralizing antibodies against 
multiple strains of pneumococcus.
RESULTS: The B- and T-cell epitopes from highly protective antigens PspA (clades 
1-5) and PhtD were predicted and immunodominant peptides were linked to each 
other with proper linkers. The domain 4 of Ply, as a potential TLR4 agonist 
adjuvant candidate, was attached to the end of the construct to enhance the 
immunogenicity of the epitope vaccine. The evaluation of the physicochemical and 
immunological properties showed that the final construct was stable, soluble, 
antigenic, and non-allergenic. Furthermore, the protein was found to be acidic 
and hydrophilic in nature. The protein 3D-structure was built and refined, and 
the Ramachandran plot, ProSA-web, ERRAT, and Verify3D validated the quality of 
the final model. Molecular docking analysis showed that the designed construct 
via Ply domain 4 had a strong interaction with TLR4. The structural stability of 
the docked complex was confirmed by molecular dynamics. Finally, codon 
optimization was performed for gene expression in E. coli, followed by in silico 
cloning in the pET28a(+) vector.
CONCLUSION: The computational analysis of the construct showed acceptable 
results, however, the suggested vaccine needs to be experimentally verified in 
laboratory to ensure its safety and immunogenicity.
