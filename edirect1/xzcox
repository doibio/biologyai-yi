casting groups was only identified in 3-point bending. However, the clinical 
relevance of this motion remains unclear as the absolute motion is less than 1 
mm. The results of this study show noninferiority of the 3D-printed casts 
compared with the traditional fiberglass casts in immobilizing a subacute distal 
radius fracture model. These results support the execution of a prospective 
randomized clinical trial comparing both casting techniques.

Obesity: global epidemiology and pathogenesis.

The prevalence of obesity has increased worldwide in the past ~50 years, 
reaching pandemic levels. Obesity represents a major health challenge because it 
substantially increases the risk of diseases such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, 
fatty liver disease, hypertension, myocardial infarction, stroke, dementia, 
osteoarthritis, obstructive sleep apnoea and several cancers, thereby 
contributing to a decline in both quality of life and life expectancy. Obesity 
is also associated with unemployment, social disadvantages and reduced 
socio-economic productivity, thus increasingly creating an economic burden. Thus 
far, obesity prevention and treatment strategies - both at the individual and 
population level - have not been successful in the long term. Lifestyle and 
behavioural interventions aimed at reducing calorie intake and increasing energy 
expenditure have limited effectiveness because complex and persistent hormonal, 
metabolic and neurochemical adaptations defend against weight loss and promote 
weight regain. Reducing the obesity burden requires approaches that combine 
individual interventions with changes in the environment and society. Therefore, 
a better understanding of the remarkable regional differences in obesity 
prevalence and trends might help to identify societal causes of obesity and 
provide guidance on which are the most promising intervention strategies.

Mechanical falls are a common cause of facial trauma in the elderly population. 
It has been shown that the likelihood of sustaining a facial fracture due to a 
fall or activities of daily life significantly increases with age. 
Craniomaxillofacial fractures are most common during the first three decades of 
life; however, elderly patients more frequently require lengthy hospital stays 
and surgical intervention, and have shown increased complication rates compared 
with younger patients. The objective of this study was to examine the prevalence 
of facial fractures secondary to mechanical falls in the elderly population to 
analyze mechanism of injury, comorbidities, and fracture management. A 
retrospective review of all facial fractures as a result of falls in the elderly 
population in a level 1 trauma center in an urban environment was performed for 
the years 2002 to 2012. Patient demographics were collected, as well as location 
of fractures, concomitant injuries, and surgical management strategies. During 
the time period examined, 139 patients were identified as greater than 60 years 
of age and having sustained a fracture of the facial skeleton as the result of a 
fall. The average age was 75.7 (range, 60-103) years, with no gender 
predominance of 50.4% female and 49.6% male. There were a total of 205 fractures 
recorded. The most common fractures were those of the orbit (42.0%), nasal bone 
(23.4%), zygoma (13.2%), and zygomaticomaxillary complex (7.32%). The average 
Glasgow Coma Scale on arrival was 12.8 (range, 3-15). Uncontrolled hemorrhage 
was noted on presentation to the trauma bay in five patients. Twenty-one 
patients were intubated on, or prior to, arrival to the trauma bay, and 44 
required a surgical airway. The most common concomitant injury was a long bone 
fracture (23.5%), followed by cervical spine fracture (18.5%), skull fracture 
(17.3%), intracerebral hemorrhage (17.3%), rib fracture (17.3%), ophthalmologic 
injuries (6.2%), short bone fracture (4.9%), pelvic fracture (2.9%), thoracic 
spine fracture (1.2%), and lumbar spine fracture (1.2%). Of the 114 patients 
admitted to the hospital, 53 were admitted to an intensive care setting. The 
average hospital length of stay was 8.97 days (range, 0-125). Sixteen patients 
expired. Surgical management of fractures in the operating room was required in 
47 of the 139 patients. Of the patients treated, 36.2% required an open 
reduction and internal fixation procedure. Facial fractures as a result of falls 
in the geriatric population represent an increasing number of cases in clinical 
practice as life expectancy steadily rises. These patients require a specific 
standard of treatment since they are more susceptible to nosocomial infections, 
as well as have higher complication rates and longer recovery time. Concomitant 
injuries such as cervical spine and pelvic fractures can greatly increase risk 
of mortality. Surgical and soft tissue management must be approached with 
caution to optimize function and aesthetics while preventing secondary 
infection. The authors hope that this study can provide some insight and further 
investigation as there is a dearth of literature to the management of facial 
fractures in falls in elderly patients.

BACKGROUND: Reducing socio-economic health inequalities is a public health 
priority, necessitating careful monitoring that should take into account changes 
in the population composition. We analyzed the evolution of educational 
inequalities in life expectancy and disability-free life expectancy at age 25 
(LE25 and DFLE25) in Belgium between 2001 and 2011.
METHODS: The 2001 and 2011 census data were linked with the national register 
data for a five-year mortality follow up. Disability prevalence estimates from 
the health interview surveys (2001 to 2013) were used to compute DFLE according 
to Sullivan's method. LE25 and DFLE25 were computed by educational level (EL). 
Absolute differentials of LE25 and DFLE25 were calculated for each EL and for 
each period, as well as composite inequality indices (CII) of population-level 
impact of inequality. Changes over the 10-year period were then calculated for 
each inequality index.
RESULTS: The LE25 increased in all ELs and both genders, except in the lowest EL 
for women. The increase was larger in the highest EL, leading in 2011 to 6.07 
and 4.58 years for the low-versus-high LE25 gaps respectively in men and women, 
compared to 5.19 and 3.76 in 2001, namely 17 and 22% increases. The upwards 
shift of the EL distribution led to a limited 7% increase of the CII among men 
but no change in women.The substantial increase of the DFLE25 in males with high 
EL (+ 4.5 years) and the decrease of the DFLE25 in women with low EL, results in 
a substantial increase of all considered DFLE25 inequality measures in both 
genders. In 2011, DFLE25 gaps were respectively 10.4 and 13.5 years in males and 
females compared to 6.51 and 9.30 in 2001, representing increases of 61 and 44% 
for the gaps, and 72 and 20% for the CII.
CONCLUSION: The LE25 increased in all ELs, but at a higher pace in highly 
educated, leading to an increase in the LE25 gaps in both genders. After 
accounting for the upwards shift of the educational distribution, the 
population-level inequality index increased only for men. The DFLE25 increased 
only in highly educated men, and decreased in low educated women, leading to 
large increases of inequalities in both genders. A general plan to tackle health 
inequality should be set up, with particular efforts to improve the health of 
the low educated women.

BACKGROUND: Early childhood obesity prevention is gaining increasing importance, 
as the prevalence of children with overweight and obesity aged 5 years and under 
increases worldwide. Along with understanding the effectiveness of obesity 
interventions, it is important to understand the cost-effectiveness of 
interventions over time.
OBJECTIVES: To estimate the long-term health benefits and health care 
cost-savings of reductions in BMI for the Australian population of children aged 
between 2 and 5 years.
METHODS: A proportional multistate, multiple cohort lifetable model estimated 
the health benefits and health care cost-savings related to hypothetical 
reductions in BMI, informed by a scoping review of systematic reviews reporting 
the effectiveness of obesity prevention interventions in preschool aged 
children.
RESULTS: Results suggest significant potential for cost-effectiveness of obesity 
prevention interventions in preschool-aged children if intervention effect can 
be maintained. A relatively small population level reduction in BMI z-score 
(-0.13 BMIz) in children aged 2 to 5 years would result in 36 496 
health-adjusted life years saved (95% uncertainty interval [UI], 30 283-42 945) 
and health care cost-savings of approximately $301 million (95% UI 
$234 million-$369 million) if modelled over the lifetime.
CONCLUSIONS: Scenario results highlight the importance of obesity intervention 
in the early years of life.

Maternal age has a negative effect on offspring lifespan in a range of taxa and 
is hypothesized to influence the evolution of aging. However, the mechanisms of 
maternal age effects are unknown, and it remains unclear if maternal age alters 
offspring response to therapeutic interventions to aging. Here, we evaluate 
maternal age effects on offspring lifespan, reproduction, and the response to 
caloric restriction, and investigate maternal investment as a source of maternal 
age effects using the rotifer, Brachionus manjavacas, an aquatic invertebrate. 
We found that offspring lifespan and fecundity decline with increasing maternal 
age. Caloric restriction increases lifespan in all offspring, but the magnitude 
of lifespan extension is greater in the offspring from older mothers. The 
trade-off between reproduction and lifespan extension under low food conditions 
expected by life history theory is observed in young-mother offspring, but not 
in old-mother offspring. Age-related changes in maternal resource allocation to 
reproduction do not drive changes in offspring fitness or plasticity under 
caloric restriction in B. manjavacas. Our results suggest that the declines in 
reproduction in old-mother offspring negate the evolutionary fitness benefits of 
lifespan extension under caloric restriction.

INTRODUCTION: Turoctocog alfa pegol (N8-GP) is a site-specific, 40 kDa 
glycoPEGylated recombinant factor VIII (FVIII) product with an extended 
half-life. The comprehensive main phase of the pivotal pathfinder 2 trial showed 
N8-GP dosed every 4 days (Q4D) provided favourable safety and efficacy for 
preventing bleeds in 175 patients with haemophilia A.
AIM AND METHODS: We investigated the safety and efficacy of N8-GP prophylaxis 
when administered weekly (Q7D) for 24 weeks to patients with low bleeding rates 
in the pathfinder 2 extension trial. Patients (≥12 years) with ≤2 bleeds during 
the preceding 6 months of the pathfinder 2 main phase were eligible for 
randomization to receive N8-GP 50 IU/kg Q4D or 75 IU/kg Q7D. Safety and efficacy 
endpoints were incidence of FVIII inhibitors and annualized bleeding rate (ABR), 
respectively.
RESULTS: Fifty-five of 143 (38.5%) patients on prophylaxis who continued into 
the extension phase were randomized to receive 50 IU/kg Q4D (n = 17) or 75 IU/kg 
Q7D (n = 38). Nine patients in the Q7D cohort reverted to 50 IU/kg Q4D. No 
inhibitors were detected. In both cohorts, >50% of patients experienced no 
bleeds. Median ABR for overall, joint, spontaneous, traumatic and muscle was 
0.00 for both cohorts. Overall estimated success rate for treating bleeding 
episodes was 87.5%; 94.7% of bleeds were controlled with ≤2 injections.
CONCLUSIONS: Weekly N8-GP was well tolerated and efficacious and may benefit 
selected "low bleeder" patients with haemophilia A.

Implications of the Fracture Risk Assessment Algorithm for the assessment and 
improvement of bone health in patients with prostate cancer: A comprehensive 
review.

OBJECTIVE: Maintaining the optimum bone health is one of the important concerns 
in patients with prostate cancer, but it usually remains neglected. Failure to 
screen these patients is detrimental to both the length and the quality of life. 
The estimation of bone mineral density (BMD) and more recently the World Health 
Organization's fracture risk assessment (FRAX) algorithm in appropriate patients 
is recommended by several specialty organizations/associations at the time of 
instituting androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) for metastatic and high-risk 
individuals. It provides a 10-year risk evaluation of hip and major osteoporotic 
fractures (MOF). Using this web-based new investigating tool, candidates at high 
risk of fractures can be predicted more accurately according to clinical risk 
factors (CRF) alone or in combination with the femoral neck BMD. The FRAX 
application for senile osteoporosis has been studied and reviewed extensively, 
but no systematic review has ever been conducted for assessing the implication 
of FRAX in prostate cancer. This review article will give insight about the 
validity, role, and utility of this investigating tool in clinical practice for 
fracture risk assessment in these individuals.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: This systematic review was carried out as per the 
Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guidelines 
and Cochrane review principles. We searched the PubMed, Cochrane database of 
systematic reviews, and the EMBASE electronic database until December 2018 using 
the medical subject heading terms prostate cancer and FRAX.
RESULTS: A total of nine studies meet the inclusion criteria and were included 
in the review. These studies enrolled a total of 3704 patients (sample size 
range, 78-1220) of localized, metastatic, castration resistant prostate cancer 
with or without ADT and/or on photon or radiotherapy. The factors that 
influenced FRAX included age, ethnicity, baseline BMD, duration of ADT, presence 
of CRF, and measurement methods (CRF, with/without BMD, computed tomography 
based). An advanced age and duration of ADT were the most robust risk factors. A 
10-year MOF and hip fracture risk estimation was higher when the femoral neck 
BMD was not incorporated in the FRAX measurement. Despite several well-known 
strengths of using FRAX in the fracture risk assessment of suitable candidates 
with prostate cancer, several risk factors such as the mode/duration of ADT, 
mode of radiotherapy, Vitamin D levels, bone remodeling markers, and 
recent/recurrent fractures need to be incorporated in the FRAX calculator for 
improving the predictive ability. In contrast to senile osteoporosis with a 
longer life expectancy, the fracture risk in patients with prostate cancer need 
to be measured more frequently and for a shorter time. Therefore, models like 
Garvan calculator with both 5- and 10-year risk estimates have to be developed 
for these patients. Additionally, its utilization is of limited value in the 
presence of recurrent fractures or falls.
CONCLUSION: The FRAX algorithm is beneficial in identifying patients who require 
early intervention or bone-directed therapy as an early step to decrease 
skeletal-related events and other morbidity. Several risk factors need to be 
added for improving the FRAX predictive value. This model is still underutilized 
in the clinical practice and increasing the awareness among treating physicians 
will help in optimizing the bone health and the quality of life of this 
important population subgroup.

Resource allocation in ICU: ethical considerations.

McGuire A(1), McConnell PC.

Author information:
(1)Department of Anaesthesia and Intensive Care Medicine, Royal Alexandra 
Hospital, Paisley, UK.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Increasing scarcity of resources on the background of ever 
improving medical care and prolonged life expectancy has placed a burden on all 
aspects of health care. In this article we examine the current problems with 
resource allocation in intensive care and question whether we can find guidance 
on appropriate resource allocation through ethical models.
RECENT FINDINGS: The problem of fair and ethical resource allocation has 
perpetually plagued health care. Recent work has looked at value for money, 
benefits of therapies and how we define futility, but these still fall victim to 
the same problems that classical schools of ethical thought have tried to 
tackle.
SUMMARY: Many ethical principles provide a framework on which to allocate 
resources to certain cohorts of patients, however, most appear too rigid to be 
fully and primarily utilized for intensive care admission. We suggest a 
collaboration of principles be applied to achieve a moral, ethical and common 
sense approach to this issue. Over resourcing and under resourcing is also 
suggested to be problematic for patients and healthcare workers alike.

BACKGROUND: Cost-utility analysis (CUA) is becoming more commonly used in 
healthcare decision-making. CUA uses the quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) 
metric, which combines the length of life with the health-related quality of 
life (HRQoL). Most QALY-measuring instruments were validated for general 
populations. For patients with cancer, the perception of their health state is 
different and may vary by the type of cancer considered. In Quebec, no 
preference weights for QALY have been developed, neither for the general 
population nor particular subpopulations.
METHODS/DESIGN: This survey is a prospective, longitudinal cohort study. The 
study objectives are: to assess the extent of difference in health utilities 
between the general population and patients with breast or colorectal cancer; to 
develop a QALY preference weights dataset for patients with cancer; and to 
perform "mapping" with different HRQoL questionnaires by correlating the SF-6Dv2 
with the EQ-5D-5L, European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer 
Quality of Life Questionnaire C30, and functional assessment of cancer therapy - 
general questionnaires. Data will be collected via a self-administered online 
survey. Patients' health utilities will be measured within 2 days before the 
beginning of a chemotherapy treatment cycle and about 8 days after the start of 
the chemotherapy. Health utilities will be measured by a hybrid method using the 
time-trade-off and discrete choice experiment methods.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The proposed research was reviewed and approved by the 
Institutional Research Ethics Review Boards of the CHUS. We will disseminate our 
study findings through peer-reviewed publications and conference presentations.

BACKGROUND: Neoadjuvant therapy has emerged as an alternative treatment strategy 
for potentially resectable pancreatic cancer. In the absence of large randomized 
controlled trials offering a direct comparison, this study aims to use Markov 
decision analysis to compare efficacy of traditional surgery first (SF) and 
neoadjuvant treatment (NAT) pathways for potentially resectable pancreatic 
cancer.
METHODS: An advanced Markov decision analysis model was constructed to compare 
SF and NAT pathways for potentially resectable pancreatic cancer. Transition 
probabilities were calculated from randomized control and Phase II/III trials 
after comprehensive literature search. Utility outcomes were measured in overall 
and quality-adjusted life months (QALMs) on an intention-to-treat basis as the 
primary outcome. Markov cohort analysis of treatment received was the secondary 
outcome. Model uncertainties were tested with one and two-way deterministic and 
probabilistic Monte Carlo sensitivity analysis.
RESULTS: SF gave 23.72 months (18.51 QALMs) versus 20.22 months (16.26 QALMs). 
Markov Cohort Analysis showed that where all treatment modalities were received 
NAT gave 35.05 months (29.87 QALMs) versus 30.96 months (24.86QALMs) for R0 
resection and 34.08 months (29.87 QALMs) versus 25.85 months (20.72 QALMs) for 
R1 resection. One-way deterministic sensitivity analysis showed that NAT was 
superior if the resection rate was greater than 51.04% or below 75.68% in SF 
pathway. Two-way sensitivity analysis showed that pathway superiority depended 
on obtaining multimodal treatment in either pathway.
CONCLUSION: Whilst NAT is a viable alternative to traditional SF approach, 
superior pathway selection depends on the individual patient's likelihood of 
receiving multimodal treatment in either pathway.

Conducting interviews about children's olfactory behaviours offers a feasible 
way of learning about the earliest perceptions and knowledge of one's odour 
world. However, little is known about the stability and development of such 
self-reports. Here we present the first longitudinal study to repeatedly test 
children's odour awareness using the Children's Olfactory Behavior in Everyday 
Life (COBEL) questionnaire in five waves over a two-year period. We expected 
that higher scores would be attained by girls relative to boys and by older 
children compared to younger ones and that the scores would increase further 
into the study. We found a linear time-related increase in the total COBEL 
scores and in the food and environmental components, whereas awareness of social 
odours decreased over time. Girls were more olfaction-oriented in the context of 
social and environmental, but not food, odours. All the reported effects were 
small. The age at which the children entered the study did not affect their 
scores. We suggest that the unexpected findings regarding social odours warrant 
replication in particular and extension in longitudinal studies carried out over 
a broader time span.

CONTEXT: When discussing end-of-life issues with cancer patients, the addition 
of reassurance statements is considered helpful. However, patients' preferences 
for such statements have not been systematically demonstrated.
OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were to clarify if phrases with 
additional reassurance statements would be more preferable to phrases without 
them and explore variables associated with patients' preferences.
METHODS: In a cross-sectional survey, 412 cancer patients assessed their own 
preferences for phrases with/without additional statements using a six-point 
scale (1 = not at all preferable; 6 = very preferable). These included the 
statements of "hope for the best and prepare for the worst" ("hope/prepare") 
when discussing prognosis; symptom palliation when discussing code status; and 
specific goals, continuity of care, and nonabandonment when discussing hospice 
referral. We evaluated demographic data and the coping style and conducted 
multivariate regression analysis.
RESULTS: Compared with the phrase of life expectancy (i.e., median + typical 
range) alone [mean (SD), 3.5 (1.2); 95% CI, 3.4-3.6], the phrase with the 
additional "hope/prepare" statement was more preferable [3.8 (1.4); 3.7-3.9]. 
Compared with the phrase of do-not-resuscitate alone (3.1(1.3); 3.0-3.3), the 
phrase with the additional statement of symptom palliation was more preferable 
[3.9 (1.3); 3.7-4.0]. Compared with the phrase of hospice referral alone [3.4 
(1.2); 3.3-3.5], phrases with the addition of a specific goal [3.9 (1.0); 
3.8-4.0], specific goal and continuity (4.4(1.0); 4.3-4.5), and specific goal, 
continuity, and nonabandonment [4.8 (1.2); 4.7-4.9] were more preferable. In 
multivariate analyses, task-oriented coping was significantly correlated with 
preferences for phrases including additional reassurance statements.
CONCLUSION: Cancer patients systematically preferred reassurance statements. In 
end-of-life discussions, especially with patients with task-oriented coping, 
clinicians may provide additional reassurance statements.

Relationship of Host Genotype to Bipolaris Leaf Blight Severities and Yield 
Components of Adlay.

Extension Services, Yonchon 486-833, Korea.

Sciences, Korea University, Seoul 136-701, Korea.

Leaf blight, caused by Bipolaris coicis, is one of the most destructive and 
major yield-limiting diseases of adlay (Coix lacryma-jobi var. ma-yuen). Adlay 
is used as an ornamental, and as a medicinal and cereal food in many countries. 
Field studies performed from 1997 to 1999 in Korea evaluated the resistance of 
30 adlay genotypes to Bipolaris coicis and determined the relationship of 
cultivar resistance to leaf blight development and yield. Adlay response to leaf 
blight was quantitative rather than qualitative, varying greatly among cultivars 
or lines tested. Disease severity was lowest in Tsukuba B7, Tsukuba B15, and 
Muzu, and highest in Huksuk 1, Limgae, and Huksuk 2. Leaf position significantly 
affected disease severity, with lower leaves being more severely infected than 
upper leaves. Yield reductions of up to 52.4% for line Huksuk 2 were observed 
and were primarily associated with reductions in kernel numbers per plant, 
thousand kernel weight, and percent kernel ripeness. Loss of yield and yield 
components by leaf blight were less in resistant line Tsukuba B15 than in 
susceptible line Huksuk 2.

Putting patients into the centre: Patient empowerment in everyday health 
practices.

Schneider-Kamp A(1), Askegaard S(1).

Author information:
(1)University of Southern Denmark, Denmark.

Patient empowerment is a key topic in public health, medical sociology and in 
public debates on the modernisation of healthcare. This article joins the 
on-going discussion on public and patient involvement by offering a 
patient-centred perspective on patient empowerment outside the usual 
institutionalised context of chronic disease management. We present results from 
a qualitative study on individuals' practices of dealing with acute 
non-life-threatening medical conditions conducted from 2012 to 2017 in Denmark. 
Based on 34 home visits including in-depth interviews and participant 
observations with a sample of 28 informants, we uncover a spectrum of four 
patient tactics governing these practices: delegating, informing, consuming and 
resisting. The findings suggest disruptive changes to the role of the 
patient-physician relationship as well as the existence of practices indicative 
of patient empowerment outside the context of patient empowerment initiatives. 
Some patients are found to take over responsibility for their health, employing 
tactics where the role of general practitioners is severely demoted. These 
empirical contributions lead to the two theoretical contributions of the 
article: an extension of an existing model of patient empowerment and a 
conceptual reconsideration of patient empowerment, advocating viewing it as 
emerging from a bricolage of tactical interactions with social environments 
rather than as the consequence of an external strategic process.

INTRODUCTION: We describe a simplified distributional cost-effectiveness 
analysis based on aggregate data to estimate the health inequality impact of 
public health interventions.
METHODS: We extracted data on costs, health outcomes expressed as 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and target populations for interventions 
within National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) public health 
guidance published up to October 2016. Evidence on variation by age, gender, and 
index of multiple deprivation informed socioeconomic distributions of 
incremental QALYs, health opportunity costs, and the baseline distribution of 
health. Total population QALYs, summary measures of inequality, and a health 
equity impact plane show results by intervention and by guideline. A value for 
inequality aversion from a general population survey in England let us combine 
impacts on health inequality and total health into a single measure of 
intervention value.
RESULTS: Our estimates suggest that of 134 interventions considered by NICE, 70 
(52%) reduce inequality and increase health, 21 (16%) involve a tradeoff between 
improving health and improving health inequality, and 43 (32%) reduce health and 
increase health inequality. Fully implemented, the potential impact of all 
recommendations was 23,336,181 additional QALYs for the population of England 
and Wales and a reduction of the gap in quality-adjusted life expectancy between 
the healthiest and least healthy from 13.78 to 13.34 QALYs. The combined value 
of the additional health and reduction in inequality was 28,723,776 QALYs.
DISCUSSION: Our analysis takes account of the fact that existing public health 
spending likely benefits the most disadvantaged. This simple method applied 
separately to economic evaluation produces evidence of intervention impacts on 
the distribution of health that is vital in determining value for money when 
health inequality reduction is a policy goal.

Premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) is defined as the cessation of ovarian 
function before the age of 40 years. The trio of amenorrhea, elevated 
gonadotropins and oestrogen deficiency is associated with long-term health 
consequences including increased cardiovascular disease (CVD), decreased bone 
mineral density (BMD), significantly reduced fertility, psychological distress, 
vulvovaginal atrophy, neurological effects and overall reduced life expectancy. 
There are deficits in our understanding of this condition and subsequently the 
long-term health consequences. The underlying aetiology of POI and the optimal 
management strategies are also poorly understood. Our knowledge of long-term 
cardiovascular consequences specifically relating to women with POI is limited 
as most data on the subject are derived from studies involving women who 
experienced menopause at the natural age (after 40 years with an average age of 
51).

BACKGROUND: With some Medicaid state programs still restricting patient access 
to hepatitis C (HCV) treatment, it is important to demonstrate how states could 
expand treatment access to a broader Medicaid population and balance short-term 
budget concerns.
METHODS: We used the HCV Transmission and Progression (TaP) Markov model to 
quantify the impact of removing restrictions to HCV treatment access on the 
infected populations, expenditures, and net social value for the North Carolina 
(NC), Oregon (OR), and Wisconsin (WI) Medicaid programs. Four HCV treatment 
access scenarios were modeled: 1) Baseline: Patients were treated according to 
Medicaid disease severity and sobriety requirements in 2015; 2) Remove Sobriety 
Restrictions: Disease severity restrictions were maintained, but people who 
inject drugs (PWID) were given access to treatment; 3) Treat Early: All 
patients, except for PWIDs, regardless of disease severity, were eligible for 
treatment and the diagnosis rate increased from 50 to 66%; and 4) Remove Access 
Restrictions: all patients, regardless of disease severity and sobriety, were 
eligible for treatment. Our key model outputs were: number of infected Medicaid 
beneficiaries, HCV-related medical and treatment expenditures, total social 
value, and state Medicaid spending over 10 years.
RESULTS: Across all three states, removing access restrictions resulted in the 
greatest benefits over 10 years (net social value relative to baseline = $408 M 
in NC; $408 M in OR; $271 M in WI) and the smallest infected population (5200 in 
NC; 2000 in OR; 614 in WI). Reduced disease transmission resulted in lower 
health care expenditures (-$66 M in NC; -$50 M in OR; -$54 M in WI). All of the 
expanded treatment access policies achieved break-even costs-where total 
treatment and health care expenditures fell below those of Baseline-in 4 to 
8 years. Removing access restrictions yielded the greatest improvement in social 
value (net of medical expenditures and treatment costs, QALYs valued at $150 K 
per QALY).
CONCLUSIONS: While increasing treatment access in Medicaid will raise short-term 
costs, it will also provide clear benefits relatively quickly by saving money 
and improving health within a 10-year window. Patients and taxpayers would 
benefit by considering these gains and taking a more expansive and long-term 
view of HCV treatment policies.

BACKGROUND: Life expectancy is one of the most important factors in end-of-life 
decision making. Good prognostication for example helps to determine the course 
of treatment and helps to anticipate the procurement of health care services and 
facilities, or more broadly: facilitates Advance Care Planning. Advance Care 
Planning improves the quality of the final phase of life by stimulating doctors 
to explore the preferences for end-of-life care with their patients, and people 
close to the patients. Physicians, however, tend to overestimate life 
expectancy, and miss the window of opportunity to initiate Advance Care 
Planning. This research tests the potential of using machine learning and 
natural language processing techniques for predicting life expectancy from 
electronic medical records.
METHODS: We approached the task of predicting life expectancy as a supervised 
machine learning task. We trained and tested a long short-term memory recurrent 
neural network on the medical records of deceased patients. We developed the 
model with a ten-fold cross-validation procedure, and evaluated its performance 
on a held-out set of test data. We compared the performance of a model which 
does not use text features (baseline model) to the performance of a model which 
uses features extracted from the free texts of the medical records (keyword 
model), and to doctors' performance on a similar task as described in scientific 
literature.
RESULTS: Both doctors and the baseline model were correct in 20% of the cases, 
taking a margin of 33% around the actual life expectancy as the target. The 
keyword model, in comparison, attained an accuracy of 29% with its prognoses. 
While doctors overestimated life expectancy in 63% of the incorrect prognoses, 
which harms anticipation to appropriate end-of-life care, the keyword model 
overestimated life expectancy in only 31% of the incorrect prognoses.
CONCLUSIONS: Prognostication of life expectancy is difficult for humans. Our 
research shows that machine learning and natural language processing techniques 
offer a feasible and promising approach to predicting life expectancy. The 
research has potential for real-life applications, such as supporting timely 
recognition of the right moment to start Advance Care Planning.

Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is an important cause of morbidity in Irish 
Wolfhounds (IW), a breed also predisposed to neoplastic and orthopedic diseases 
that shorten life expectancy. The objective of this study was to investigate 
survival and causes of death in IW with DCM and to characterise the clinical 
findings of DCM over time. Data from cardiovascular examinations performed in 
1591 IW, including echocardiography and electrocardiography, were 
retrospectively evaluated. IW with DCM on medical therapy with long term 
longitudinal follow-up were included in this study (n=151; 95 males, 56 
females). Based on their clinical status at initial diagnosis, IW were 
classified into one of three groups: preclinical DCM with sinus rhythm 
(PC-DCM-SR, n=35), preclinical DCM with atrial fibrillation (PC-DCM-AF, n=87), 
and congestive heart failure with DCM and AF (CHF-DCM-AF, n=29). Survival data 
were analyzed using cumulative incidence functions, Kaplan-Meier and Cox 
regression. CHF was predominantly characterized by chylous pleural and mild 
pericardial effusions. Causes of death were cardiac (CD) in 73/151 and 
non-cardiac (non-CD) in 62/151; 16 dogs remained alive at study end. The 
majority of deaths in both preclinical DCM groups were non-CD (PC-DCM-AF=51.9% 
non-CD, 48.1% CD; PC-DCM-SR, 65.5% non-CD, 34.5% CD). In the CHF-DCM-AF group 
most dogs (89.6%) experienced a CD. Median survival of the CHF-DCM-AF group (7.3
