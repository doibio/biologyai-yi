BACKGROUND: In well-resourced countries, comprehensive care programs have 
increased life expectancy of patients with sickle cell disease, with almost all 
infants surviving into adulthood. However, families affected by sickle cell 
disease are more likely to be economically disenfranchised because of their 
racial or ethnic minority status. As every individual child has the right to the 
highest attainable standard of health under the United Nations Convention on the 
Rights of the Child, it is essential to identify both barriers and facilitators 
with regard to the delivery of adequate healthcare. Optimal healthcare 
accessibility will improve healthcare outcomes for children with sickle cell 
disease and their families. Healthcare professionals in the field of sickle cell 
care have first-hand experience of the barriers that patients encounter when it 
comes to effective care. We therefore hypothesised that these medical 
professionals have a clear picture of what is necessary to overcome these 
barriers and which facilitators will be most feasible. Therefore, this study 
aims to map best practises and lessons learnt in order to attain more optimal 
healthcare accessibility for paediatric patients with sickle cell disease and 
their families.
METHODS: Healthcare professionals working with young patients with sickle cell 
disease were recruited for semi-structured interviews. An interview guide was 
used to ensure the four healthcare accessibility dimensions were covered. The 
interviews were transcribed and coded. Based on field notes, initial codes were 
generated, to collate data (both barriers and solutions) to main themes (such as 
"transportation", or "telecommunication"). Through ongoing thematic analysis, 
definitive themes were formulated and best practices were reported as 
recommendations. Quotations were selected to highlight or illustrate the themes 
and link the reported results to the empirical data.
RESULTS: In 2019, 22 healthcare professionals from five different university 
hospitals in the Netherlands were interviewed. Participants included 
(paediatric) haematologists, nurses and allied health professionals. Six themes 
emerged, all associated with best practices on topics related to the improvement 
of healthcare accessibility for children with sickle cell disease and their 
families. Firstly, the full reimbursement of invisible costs made by caregivers. 
Secondly, clustering of healthcare appointments on the same day to help patients 
seeing all required specialists without having to visit the hospital frequently. 
Thirdly, organisation of care according to shared care principles to deliver 
specialised services as close as possible to the patient's home without 
compromising quality. Fourthly, optimising verbal and written communication 
methods with special consideration for families with language barriers, low 
literacy skills, or both. Fifthly, improving the use of eHealth services 
tailored to users' health literacy skills, including accessible mobile telephone 
contact between healthcare professionals and caregivers of children with sickle 
cell disease. Finally, increasing knowledge and interest in sickle cell disease 
among key stakeholders and the public to ensure that preventive and acute 
healthcare measures are understood and safeguarded in all settings.
CONCLUSION: This qualitative study describes the views of healthcare 
professionals on overcoming barriers of healthcare accessibility that arise from 
the intersecting vulnerabilities faced by patients with sickle cell disease and 
their families. The recommendations gathered in this report provide high-income 
countries with a practical resource to meet their obligations towards individual 
children under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.

This paper aims to discuss the concept of canine guidance in light of recent 
research with regard to time to extraction of the restored canine tooth, with 
crowns representing the worst performing restoration at 15 years (66% cumulative 
survival). Given that the upper canine tooth may be considered the 'cornerstone' 
of the arch, reasons for this poor performance are discussed by examination of 
the existing literature on canine guidance and other aspects relating to the 
preparation of an upper canine tooth for a crown. The authors question previous 
recommendations that canine teeth should be placed into canine guidance when 
restored with crowns, given that the previously-published data indicate that 
survival of upper canine teeth which have been crowned is worse than when they 
are restored with any other restoration. It is also suggested that, if 
clinicians wish to prolong the life expectancy of an upper canine tooth, they 
must try to avoid crowning it.

Periods of absence from supervised group exercise while maintaining physical 
activity might be a frequent pattern in adults' exercise habits. The aim of the 
present study was to determine detraining effects on musculoskeletal outcomes 
after a 3-month detraining period in early post-menopausal, osteopenic women. 
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we terminated the 18-month randomized controlled 
ACTLIFE exercise intervention immediately after the 13-month follow-up 
assessment. This put an abrupt stop to the high-intensity aerobic and resistance 
group exercise sessions undertaken three times per week by the exercise group 
(EG: n = 27) and the gentle exercise program performed once per week for the 
attention control group (CG: n = 27); but both groups were permitted to conduct 
individual outdoor activity for the 3-month lock-down period. Study endpoints 
were lean body mass (LBM), bone mineral density (BMD) at the lumbar spine (LS), 
maximum hip-/leg extension strength and power. Detraining-induced reductions of 
LBM, hip/leg strength and power (but not BMD-LS) were significantly greater 
(p < 0.001 to p = 0.044) compared with the CG. Significant exercise effects, 
i.e. differences between EG and CG, present after 13 months of exercise, were 
lost after 3 months of detraining for LBM (p = 0.157) and BMD-LS (p = 0.065), 
but not for strength (p < 0.001) and power (p < 0.001). Of note, self-reported 
individual outdoor activities and exercise increased by about 40% in both groups 
during the lock-down period. Three months' absence from a supervised group 
exercise protocol resulted in considerable detraining effects for 
musculoskeletal parameters. Thus, exercise programs for adults should be 
continuous rather than intermittent.Trial registration number:

Combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) has greatly increased life expectancy 
for human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1)-infected patients. Even given the 
remarkable success of cART, the virus persists in many different cells and 
tissues. The presence of viral reservoirs represents a major obstacle to HIV-1 
eradication. These viral reservoirs contain latently infected long-lived cells. 
The "Shock and Kill" therapeutic strategy aims to reactivate latently infected 
cells by latency reversing agents (LRAs) and kill these reactivated cells by 
strategies involving the host immune system. The brain is a natural anatomical 
reservoir for HIV-1 infection. Brain macrophages, including microglia and 
perivascular macrophages, display productive HIV-1 infection. A mathematical 
model was used to analyze the dynamics of latently and productively infected 
brain macrophages during viral infection and this mathematical model enabled 
prediction of the effects of LRAs applied to the "Shock and Kill" strategy in 
the brain. The model was calibrated using reported data from simian 
immunodeficiency virus (SIV) studies. Our model produces the overarching 
observation that effective cART can suppress productively infected brain 
macrophages but leaves a residual latent viral reservoir in brain macrophages. 
In addition, our model demonstrates that there exists a parameter regime wherein 
the "Shock and Kill" strategy can be safe and effective for SIV infection in the 
brain. The results indicate that the "Shock and Kill" strategy can restrict 
brain viral RNA burden associated with severe neuroinflammation and can lead to 
the eradication of the latent reservoir of brain macrophages.

The high prevalence of obesity in the elderly and the increase in life 
expectancy pushed up the age limit as an indication to bariatric surgery. 
Nevertheless, results on safety and effectiveness of these procedures in over 60 
years old population are still controversial. Objectives of the study were to 
evaluate the safety and effectiveness of bariatric surgery in the elderly. A 
prospectively collected database was queried for patients older than 60 years 
who underwent laparoscopic bariatric procedures between 2010 and 2017 at a 
single institution. These patients were matched with a group of younger patients 
who had the same procedure in the same period of time. Basal characteristic, 
intra- and post-operative data were compared. Patients were followed up at 
36 months reporting the percentage of excess weight loss (%EWL) and 
comorbidities remission rate. A total of 100 patients ≥ 60 years old were 
included (Group 1) and matched with a control group of 96 patients < 60 years 
(Group 2). Post-operative complications rate was similar (15.0% versus 10.4% 
p = 0.395). %EWL at 36 months was significantly higher in Group 2 (44.6% versus 
68.2% p < 0.001), while remission of medical morbidities was similar in both 
groups, with a higher rate for type 2 diabetes (T2D) remission among older 
people (p = 0.017). Patients older than 60 years have post-operative outcomes 
comparable to younger population. Long-term results are inferior in terms of 
%EWL, but similar regarding morbidities remission rates, with particular 
benefits on T2D.

PURPOSE: The most widely used generic questionnaire to estimate the quality of 
life for yielding quality-adjusted life years in economic evaluations is EQ-5D. 
Country-specific population value sets are required to use EQ-5D in economic 
evaluations. The aim of this study was to establish an EQ-5D-3L value set for 
Russia.
METHODS: A representative sample aged 18+ years was recruited from the Russia`s 
general population. Computer-assisted face-to-face interviews were conducted 
based on the standardized valuation protocol using EQ-Portable Valuation 
Technology. Population preferences were elicited utilizing both composite time 
trade-off (cTTO) and discrete choice experiment (DCE) techniques. To estimate 
the value set, a hybrid regression model combining cTTO and DCE data was used.
RESULTS: A total of 300 respondents who successfully completed the interview 
were included in the primary analysis. 120 (40.0%) respondents reported no 
health problems of any dimension, and 56 (18.7%) reported moderate health 
problems in one dimension of the EQ-5D-3L. Median self-rated health using EQ-VAS 
was 80 with IQR 70-90. Comparing cTTO and DCE-predicted values for 243 health 
states resulted in a similar pattern. This supports the use of hybrid models. 
The predicted value based on the preferred model for the worst health state 
"33333" was -0.503. Mobility dimension had the most significant impact on the 
utility decrement, and anxiety/depression had the lowest decrement.
CONCLUSION: Determining a Russian national value set may be considered the first 
step towards promoting cost-utility analysis use to increase comparability among 
studies and improve the transferability of healthcare decision-making in Russia.

It is widely held that schizophrenia involves an active process of peripheral 
inflammation that induces or reflects brain inflammation with activation of 
microglia, the brain's resident immune cells. However, recent in vivo 
radioligand binding studies and large-scale transcriptomics in post-mortem brain 
report reduced markers of microglial inflammation. The findings suggest a 
contrary hypothesis; that microglia are diverted into their non-inflammatory 
synaptic remodelling phenotype that interferes with neurodevelopment and perhaps 
contributes to the relapsing nature of schizophrenia. Recent discoveries on the 
regulatory interactions between micro- and astroglial cells and immune 
regulatory T cells (Tregs) cohere with clinical omics data to suggest that: i) 
disinhibited astrocytes mediate the shift in microglial phenotype via the 
production of transforming growth factor-beta, which also contributes to the 
disturbances of dopamine and GABA function in schizophrenia, and ii) 
systemically impaired functioning of Treg cells contributes to the dysregulation 
of glial function, the low-grade peripheral inflammation, and the hitherto 
unexplained predisposition to auto-immunity and reduced life-expectancy in 
schizophrenia, including greater COVID-19 mortality.

AIMS: To describe associations between incentivised primary care clinical and 
process indicators and mortality, among patients with type 2 diabetes in 
England.
METHODS: A historical 2010-2017 cohort (n = 84,441 adults) was derived from the 
UK CPRD. Exposures included English Quality and Outcomes Framework glycated 
haemoglobin (HbA1c; 7.5%, 59 mmol/mol), blood pressure (140/80 mmHg), and 
cholesterol (5 mmol/L) indicator attainment; and number of National Diabetes 
Audit care processes completed, in 2010-11. The primary outcome was all-cause 
mortality.
RESULTS: Over median 3.9 (SD 2.0) years follow-up, 10,711 deaths occurred. 
Adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) indicated 12% (95% CI 8-16%; p < 0.0001) and 16% 
(11-20%; p < 0.0001) lower mortality rates among those who attained the HbA1c 
and cholesterol indicators, respectively. Rates were also lower among those who 
completed 7-9 vs. 0-3 or 4-6 care processes (aHRs 0.76 (0.71-0.82), p < 0.0001 
and 0.61 (0.53-0.71), p < 0.0001, respectively), but did not obviously vary by 
blood pressure indicator attainment (aHR 1.04, 1.00-1.08; p = 0.0811).
CONCLUSIONS: Cholesterol, HbA1c and comprehensive process indicator attainment, 
was associated with enhanced survival. Review of community-based care provision 
could help reduce the gap between indicator standards and current outcomes, and 
in turn enhance life expectancy.

Colletotrichum orbiculare, an anthracnose disease fungus of cucurbit plants, 
extends penetration hyphae inside the epidermal cells of host plants. Unlike 
vegetative hyphae formed on a nutrient rich medium, this pathogen initially 
develops biotrophic penetration hyphae, which acquire nutrient resources from 
living host cells and secret effector proteins to suppress host defense 
responses. Subsequently, the nature of penetration hyphae changes from biotrophy 
to necrotrophy in response to the interaction with a host plant. Hence, 
controlling the extension of penetration hyphae is crucial for C. orbiculare 
infection. Here, we identified CoGRIM19 encoding Nadh-ubiquinone oxidoreductase 
subunit as a pathogenicity gene. Pathogenicity assays showed that the cogrim19 
mutant caused no visible symptoms on cucumber cotyledons. Microscopic 
observations revealed that the cogrim19 mutant developed an appressorium and 
penetration hyphae under artificial conditions such as on coverslips or 
cellulose membranes, but the penetration hyphae of the mutant were retarded in 
the cucumber cotyledons. Microscopic observations of biotrophy-specific 
expression fluorescent signals revealed that the biotrophic stage was maintained 
in the retarded penetration hyphae of the cogrim19 mutant as the penetration of 
the wild type. In addition to cytological observations, pathogenicity assays 
using wounded leaves showed that the cogrim19 mutant had an attenuated 
pathogenesis. Taking our results together, CoGRIM19 is required for invasive 
hyphal growth inside the epidermal cells of cucumber cotyledons in C. 
orbiculare.

INTRODUCTION: Surgery and chemotherapy have increased the survival of pancreatic 
cancer. The decrease in postoperative morbidity and mortality and increase in 
life expectancy, has expanded the indications por cephalic 
pancreaticoduodenectomy (PDC), although it remains controversial in the 
geriatric population.
METHODS: Retrospective study on a prospective database of patients with ductal 
adenocarcinoma of pancreas who underwent PDC between 2007-2018.The main 
objective was to analyse the morbidity-mortality and survival associated with 
PDC in patients≥75 years (elderly).
RESULTS: 79 patients were included, 21 of them older than 75 years (27%); within 
this group, 23.9% were over 80 years old. The ASA of both groups was similar. 
Patients≥75 years required more transfusions. No differences in operating time 
were observed, although more vascular resection were performed in the elderly 
(26 vs. 8.7%; P=.037). Morbidity was higher in the elderly (61.9 vs. 46.6%), 
although without differences. Patients aged≥75 years had more non-surgical 
complications (33.3%, P=.050), being pneumonia the most frequent. Postoperative 
mortality was higher in the≥75 years (9 vs. 0%; P=.017). The overall survival 
and disease-free survival did not show significant differences in both groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Elderly patients had higher postoperative mortality and more 
non-surgical complications. Survival did not show differences, so with an 
adequate selection of patients, age should not be considered itself as a 
contraindication for PDC.

In this study, a higher metal ions-resistant bacterium, Stenotrophomonas 
rhizophila JC1 was isolated from contaminated soil in Jinchang city, Gansu 
Province, China. The Pb2+ (120 mg/L) and Cu2+ (80 mg/L) removal rate of the 
strain reached at 76.9% and 83.4%, respectively. The genome comprises 4268161 bp 
in a circular chromosome with 67.52% G + C content and encodes 3719 proteins. 
The genome function analysis showed czc operon, mer operon, cop operon, arsenic 
detoxification system in strain JC1 were contributed to the removal of heavy 
metals. Three efflux systems (i.e., RND, CDF, and P-ATPase) on strain JC1 genome 
could trigger the removal of divalent cations from cells. cAMP pathway and ABC 
transporter pathway might be involved in the transport and metabolism of heavy 
metals. The homology analysis exhibited multi-gene families such as ABC 
transporters, heavy metal-associated domain, copper resistance protein, 
carbohydrate-binding domain were distributed across 410 orthologous groups. In 
addition, heavy metal-responsive transcription regulator, thioredoxin, heavy 
metal transport/detoxification protein, divalent-cation resistance protein CutA, 
arsenate reductase also played important roles in the heavy metals adsorption 
and detoxification process. The complete genome data provides insight into the 
exploration of the interaction mechanism between microorganisms and heavy 
metals.

INTRODUCTION: Tibial intercondylar eminence fracture is a rare fracture and is 
commonly treated with suture, screw or bio-absorbable nail. Current literature 
includes little information regarding outcome of surgically treatment with 
bio-absorbable nails. The purpose of this study was to report the clinical and 
functional outcomes in patients with tibial intercondylar eminence fractures 
arthroscopically treated with bio-absorbable nails.
METHODS: The study design was retrospective follow-up. Sixteen patients, age 
11-16 years, were surgically treated with bio-absorbable nail following an 
intercondylar eminence fracture. Thirteen patients participate in the present 
follow-up study. The median follow-up time was 6.5 years. The main outcome 
measurement was the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS). 
Secondary outcome measurements consisted of: Eq5d-5L questionnaire, knee pain, 
knee laxity, range of motion (ROM), muscle strength, gait analyses, radiological 
outcomes, activity and level.
RESULTS: The median KOOS scores for the five subscales were: pain 98.5 (19-100), 
symptoms 90.5 (54-100), ADL 100 (22-100), sport 87.5, (0-100) and QOL 88.0 
(13-100), indication satisfactory outcome. Low level of gait asymmetry was 
observed. Almost balanced muscle strength between the injured and non-injured 
leg for knee extension and knee flexion strength was observed. Measurement of 
anterior knee laxity showed 12 patients with a knee laxity between - 1 and 2 mm. 
The examination of intercondylar eminence displacement at the time of follow-up 
showed that 12 patients had a displacement of 2 mm or less.
CONCLUSION: This case series demonstrates satisfactory patient-reported and 
functional outcomes in the treatment of intercondylar eminence fractures in 
children and adolescents with bio-absorbable nails.

AIM: With improved life expectancy over time, the burden of kidney failure 
resulting in kidney replacement therapy (KRT) in older persons is increasing. 
This study aimed to describe the age distribution at dialysis initiation in 
Australia and New Zealand (ANZ) across centres and over time.
METHODS: Adults initiating dialysis as first KRT in ANZ from 1999 to 2018 
reported to the Australia and New Zealand Dialysis and Transplant (ANZDATA) 
Registry were included. The primary outcomes were the age distribution and the 
proportion of older persons (75 years and older) initiating dialysis across 
centres and over time. Secondary outcomes were characterization of the older 
population compared with younger people and differences in dialysis modality and 
treatment trajectories between groups.
RESULTS: Over the study period, 55 382 people initiated dialysis as first KRT, 
including 10 306 older persons, in 100 centres. Wide variation in age 
distribution across states/countries was noted, although the proportion of older 
persons at dialysis initiation did not significantly change over time (from 13% 
in 1999 to 19% in 2003, then remaining stable thereafter). Older persons were 
less likely to be treated with home therapies compared with younger people. 
Older persons were mostly Caucasians; had higher socioeconomic position, more 
cardiovascular comorbidities and higher eGFR at baseline; and resided in major 
cities. Higher proportions of older persons per centre were noted in privately 
funded facilities.
CONCLUSION: Wide variations were noted in the proportions of older persons 
initiating dialysis across centres and states/country, which were associated 
with different case-mix across regions, particularly in terms of ethnicity, 
remoteness and socioeconomic advantage.

People with severe mental illnesses have dramatically reduced life expectancy 
compared with the general population, which is largely attributed to physical 
comorbidity. Physical activity and sedentary behaviour interventions offer a 
safe and viable therapeutic resource for multi-disciplinary mental health care 
teams. The accumulating evidence supporting the role of these interventions has 
changed the focus of mental health strategy in some countries, with new 
developing roles for certain mental health professionals in this field. However, 
in Ireland the absence of specialised exercise practitioners places a leadership 
role for mental health nurses in this regard. National mental health strategy in 
Ireland should prioritise physical activity and sedentary behaviour 
interventions, make recommendations for the integration of specialised exercise 
practitioners in all mental health multidisciplinary teams, and recommend the 
provision of training and awareness for mental health nurses and other 
multidisciplinary professionals who are already well placed to address this 
issue.

People affected by severe mental health disorders have a greatly reduced life 
expectancy compared to their non-affected peers. Cardiovascular disease is the 
main contributor to this early mortality, caused by higher rates of smoking, 
physical inactivity, unhealthy diet, sleep disturbance, excessive alcohol use or 
substance abuse and medication side effects. Therefore, we need to take a 
preventative approach and translate effective interventions for physical health 
into routine clinical practice. These interventions should be delivered across 
all stages of mental health disorders and could also have the added benefit of 
leading to improvements in mental health. Furthermore, we need to advocate to 
ensure that people affected by severe mental health disorders receive the 
appropriate medical assessments and treatments when indicated. This themed issue 
highlights that physical health is now an urgent priority for funding and 
development in mental health services. The widespread implementation of 
evidence-based interventions into routine clinical practice is an essential need 
for consideration by clinicians and policymakers.

Real-time information about the concentrations of substrates and biomass is the 
key to accurate monitoring and control of bioprocess. However, on-line 
measurement of these variables is a challenging task and new measurement systems 
are still required. An alternative are software sensors, which can be used for 
state and parameter estimation in bioprocesses. The software sensors predict the 
state of the process by using mathematical models as well as data from measured 
variables. The Kalman filter is a type of such sensors. In this paper, we have 
used the Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) which is a nonlinear extension of the 
Kalman filter for on-line estimation of biomass, glucose and ethanol 
concentration as well as for estimating the growth rate parameters in S. 
cerevisiae batch cultivation, based on infrequent ethanol measurements. The UKF 
algorithm was validated on three different cultivations with variability of the 
substrate concentrations and the estimated values were compared to the off-line 
values. The results obtained showed that the UKF algorithm provides satisfactory 
results with respect to estimation of concentrations of substrates and biomass 
as well as the growth rate parameters during the batch cultivation.

This systematic review and meta-analysis set out to determine the efficacy on 
whole-body electromyostimulation (WB-EMS) on body composition and strength 
parameters in non-athletic cohorts. A systematic review of the literature 
according to the PRISMA statement included (a) controlled trials, (b) WB-EMS 
trials with at least one exercise and one control group, (c) WB-EMS as primary 
physical intervention, (d) WB-EMS with at least six electrodes covering most 
muscle groups, (e) non-athletic cohorts. We searched eight electronic databases 
up to June 30, 2020, without language restrictions. Standardized mean 
differences (SMD) for muscle mass parameters, total body fat mass, maximum leg 
extension, and trunk extension strength were defined as outcome measures. In 
summary, 16 studies with 19 individual WB-EMS groups representing 897 
participants were included. Studies vary considerably with respect to age, BMI, 
and physical conditions. Impulse protocols of the studies were roughly 
comparable, but training frequency (1-5 sessions/week) and intervention length 
(6-54 weeks) differed between the studies. SMD average was 1.23 (95%-CI: 
0.71-1.76) for muscle mass, 0.98 (0.74-1.22) for maximum leg, and 1.08 
(0.78-1.39) for maximum trunk extension strength changes (all p < 0.001). SMD 
for body fat changes (-0.40, [-0.98 to 0.17]), however, did not reach 
significance. I 2 and Q-statistics revealed substantial heterogeneity of muscle 
and fat mass changes between the trials. However, rank and regression tests did 
not indicate positive evidence for small-study bias and funnel plot asymmetries. 
This work provided further evidence for significant, large-sized effects of 
WB-EMS on muscle mass and strength parameters, but not on body fat mass.

Current Understanding of the Etiology, Symptomatology, and Treatment Options in 
Premature Ovarian Insufficiency (POI).

Medicine, Kanagawa, Japan.

Premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) occurs in at least 1% of all women and 
causes life-long health problems and psychological stress. Infertility caused by 
POI used to be considered absolute, with infertility treatment having little or 
no value. Generally, it has been thought that medicine can provide little 
service to these patients. The etiology of POI has been found to be genetic, 
chromosomal, and autoimmune. In addition, the increasing numbers of cancer 
survivors are candidates for iatrogenic POI, along with patients who have 
undergone ovarian surgery, especially laparoscopic surgery. Over 50 genes are 
known to be causally related to POI, and the disease course of some cases has 
been clarified, but in most cases, the genetic background remains unexplained, 
suggesting that more genes associated with the etiology of POI need to be 
discovered. Thus, in most cases, the genetic background of POI has not been 
clarified. Monosomy X is well known to manifest as Turner's syndrome and is 
associated with primary amenorrhea, but recent studies have shown that some 
women with numerical abnormalities of the X chromosome can have spontaneous 
menstruation up to their twenties and thirties, and some even conceive. Hormone 
replacement therapy (HRT) is recommended for women with POI from many 
perspectives. It alleviates vasomotor and genitourinary symptoms and prevents 
bone loss and cardiovascular disease. POI has been reported to reduce quality of 
life and life expectancy, and HRT may help improve both. Most of the problems 
that may occur with HRT in postmenopausal women do not apply to women with POI; 
thus, in POI, HRT should be considered physiological replacement of estrogen 
(+progesterone). This review describes some new approaches to infertility 
treatment in POI patients that may lead to new treatments for POI, along with 
the development of more sensitive markers of secondary/preantral follicles and 
genetic diagnosis.

BACKGROUND: The primary aim of this study was to determine the 
cost-effectiveness of the reverse total shoulder arthroplasty in a prospective 
cohort of patients over a two-year post-operative period.
METHODS: Patients who underwent reverse total shoulder arthroplasty were 
prospectively monitored for 24 months post-operatively using the Oxford Shoulder 
Score, Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand questionnaire and EuroQol 
5-dimensional questionnaire. Any complications or use of health care resources 
were recorded. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was used to express the 
cost per quality-adjusted life year gained.
RESULTS: Sixty-seven patients were analysed, 46 primary reverse total shoulder 
arthroplasty for cuff arthropathy and 21 revisions from previous arthroplasty. 
Both indications had comparable peri-operative shoulder scores without 
significant difference. Using the mean change of EuroQol 5-dimensional 
questionnaire at one year, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was 
calculated at £16,827.43 per quality-adjusted life year, decreasing to £8313.48 
per quality-adjusted life year at two years. Primary was associated with a lower 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio at two years (primary £7596.76 vs. revision 
£11,748.51). The estimated post-operative life expectancy of the cohort was 6.9 
years with a projected cost per quality-adjusted life year of £2438.78.
CONCLUSIONS: Reverse total shoulder arthroplasty provides a cost-effective 
intervention with excellent patient outcomes at two years post-operatively.

Despite novel drugs, the prognosis for patients with metastatic gastric cancer 
remains poor. In rare instances, locoregional therapies are used in addition to 
standard chemotherapy in patients with oligometastatic involvement. This type of 
approach has not been supported by solid published evidence. The aim of the 
present retrospective study was to assess the prognostic impact of factors such 
as metastatic site, tumour histology and locoregional treatment in patients with 
metastatic gastric cancer. A total of 184 patients with metastatic gastric or 
gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma who received at least one line of 
palliative therapy with doublet or triplet chemotherapy were enrolled in the 
current analysis. Median overall survival (OS) was 8.32 months (95% CI, 
7.02-9.41) and median progression-free survival (PFS) was 4.16 months (95% CI, 
3.24-5.08). Lung metastases vs. other sites of metastatic involvement [hazard 
ratio (HR), 0.27; P=0.0133] and intestinal histology (HR, 0.48; P=0.08) were 
significantly associated with an improved OS. Improved PFS was also observed 
(HR, 0.49; P=0.10 and HR, 0.72; P=0.08 for lung metastases and intestinal 
histology, respectively). Second line chemotherapy and locoregional treatment of 
metastases (surgery or radiotherapy) were associated with improved OS (HR, 0.52; 
P<0.0001 and HR, 0.35; P<0.0001, respectively). Multivariate analysis confirmed 
an independent prognostic role for OS only for locoregional treatment, second 
line treatment and intestinal histology. The present results suggested that the 
presence of lung metastases alone was not a relevant prognostic factor and was 
influenced by the availability of further lines of treatment or by locoregional 
treatments. Locoregional treatments in patients with oligometastatic disease 
should be offered as they allow prolonged survival in patients with otherwise 
relatively short life expectancy.
