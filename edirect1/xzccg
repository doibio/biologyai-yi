opportunistic pathogen Pneumocystis jirovecii (PJ). Further immunological workup 
revealed agammaglobulinemia in the presence of B cells. After successful 
recovery from the PJ pneumonia, he underwent hematopoietic stem cell 
transplantation (HSCT) from the HLA-matched healthy sister using a 
chemotherapeutic conditioning regimen consisting of treosulfan, fludarabine, and 
thiotepa. Other than acute chemotherapy-associated side effects, no serious 
adverse events occurred. Six months after HSCT immune-reconstitution, he had a 
stable chimerism with 2.9% autologous portion in the peripheral blood and a 
normal differential blood cell count, including all immunoglobulin subtypes. 
This is one of the first cases of successful HSCT in ICF syndrome. Early 
diagnosis and subsequent HSCT can prevent severe opportunistic infections and 
cure the immunodeficiency. Centromeric instability and facial anomaly remain 
unaffected. Although the long-term patient outcome and the neurological 
development remain to be seen, this curative therapy for immunodeficiency 
improves life expectancy and quality of life. This case is meant to raise 
physicians awareness for ICF syndrome and highlight the consideration for HSCT 
in ICF syndrome early on.

Cystic fibrosis-related diabetes (CFRD) is associated with both an increase in 
morbidity and mortality in people with cystic fibrosis (CF). With increased 
screening and improved life expectancy of people with CF, the prevalence of CFRD 
is expected to rise further. The underlying pathophysiological mechanisms 
causing glucose intolerance and diabetes in patients with CF are not well 
understood but both functional and structural abnormalities in islet cells are 
likely to have key roles. Insulin therapy improves health outcomes in patients 
with CF. Future research is needed to better understand the mechanisms 
underlying the development of CFRD and to develop new screening and treatment 
strategies to minimize the detrimental impact of CFRD on health outcomes in 
people with CF.

Prevalence of elderly patients with end-stage kidney disease has increased. 
Implementation of dialysis does not offer a clear advantage in terms of life 
expectancy and quality of life compared to a conservative treatment in these 
patients, especially in emergency and in those with severe comorbidities. The 
choice between dialysis and supportive care should be based on a shared 
decision-making process between the patient, his family and the caregivers.

Publisher: La prévalence des patients âgés de plus de 80 ans en insuffisance 
rénale terminale augmente et l’initiation d’un traitement de dialyse chez ces 
patients ne semble pas s’accompagner d’un avantage net en termes de survie et de 
qualité de vie, en particulier lorsqu’il est instauré dans l’urgence et chez 
ceux présentant des comorbidités sévères. Le choix entre un traitement 
conservateur et l’initiation d’un traitement dialytique chez ces patients ne 
devrait se faire que sur la base d’une information claire et d’une décision 
partagée entre le patient, son entourage et l’équipe soignante.

Misfolded SOD1 Accumulation and Mitochondrial Association Contribute to the 
Selective Vulnerability of Motor Neurons in Familial ALS: Correlation to Human 
Disease.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, 
with a 10% genetic linkage, of which 20% of these cases may be attributed to 
mutations in superoxide dismutase (SOD1). Specific mutations in SOD1 have been 
associated with disease duration, which can be highly variable ranging from a 
life expectancy of 3 to beyond 10 years. SOD1 neurotoxicity has been attributed 
to aberrant accumulation of misfolded SOD1, which in its soluble form binds to 
intracellular organelles disrupting their function or forms insoluble toxic 
aggregates. To understand whether these biophysical properties of the mutant 
protein may influence disease onset and duration, we generated 19 point 
mutations in the SOD1 gene, based on available clinical data of disease onset 
and progression from patients. By overexpressing these mutants in 
motor-neuron-like NSC-34 cells, we demonstrate a variability in misfolding 
capacity between the different mutants with a correlation between the degree of 
protein misfolding and mutation severity. We also show a clear variation of the 
different SOD1 mutants to associate with mitochondrial-enriched fractions with a 
correlation between mutation severity and this association. In summary, these 
findings reveal a correlation between the accumulation of misfolded SOD1 species 
and their mitochondrial association with disease duration but not with disease 
onset, and they have implications for the potential therapeutic role of 
suppressing the accumulation of misfolded SOD1.

Hunters and their families were one of the most exposed subpopulations in Sweden 
after the Chernobyl nuclear power plant accident in 1986. In this pilot study we 
used existing registries and whole-body measurements to develop algorithms to 
calculate lifetime effective doses and collective doses to some hunters in 
Sweden. Ten hunters and their family members were randomly selected from each of 
the three most contaminated counties in Sweden (Västernorrland, Uppsala, 
Gävleborg) using the register for hunting weapons from the Police Authority in 
1985. Hence, this design can be regarded as a closed cohort only including 
hunters and their family members living in these three counties at the time of 
the accident. Statistics Sweden matched these individuals (n = 85) with their 
dwelling coordinates onto the digital map produced by the Swedish Radiation 
Safety Authority after aerial measurements of 137Cs (kBq m-2). Internal 
effective doses were estimated using aggregated transfer factors from ground 
deposition to in-vivo body concentration for 134Cs and 137Cs in hunters (Bq 
kg-1). External effective doses were also calculated on the dwelling coordinate 
for 134Cs, 137Cs and short-lived nuclides in these three counties. Annual 
effective doses for external and internal doses were then cumulated up to a life 
expectancy of 80 years for men and 84 years for women, respectively. The total 
lifetime effective doses to the members of the hunter families in this cohort 
were on average 8.3 mSv in Västernorrland, 4.7 mSv in Uppsala and 4.1 mSv in 
Gävleborg. The effective dose to men were about 40% higher than in women. In all 
counties the internal dose was about 75% of the total lifetime effective dose. 
The collective dose for all hunters with family members, in total about 44,000 
individuals, in these three counties could be approximated at about 256 manSv. 
This study shows it is possible to use register data to develop algorithms for 
calculating lifetime effective dose commitments for hunters with relatively 
accuracy.

Hepatitis C Treatment Regimens Are Cost-Effective: But Compared With What?

Mattingly TJ 2nd(1), Slejko JF(1), Mullins CD(1).

Author information:
(1)1 University of Maryland School of Pharmacy, Baltimore, MD, USA.

BACKGROUND: Numerous economic models have been published evaluating treatment of 
chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, but none provide a comprehensive 
comparison among new antiviral agents.
OBJECTIVE: Evaluate the cost-effectiveness of all recommended therapies for 
treatment of genotypes 1 and 4 chronic HCV.
METHODS: Using data from clinical trials, observational analyses, and drug 
pricing databases, Markov decision models were developed for HCV genotypes 1 and 
4 to compare all recommended drugs from the perspective of the third-party payer 
over a 5-, 10-, and 50-year time horizon. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis 
(PSA) was conducted by assigning distributions for clinical cure, age entering 
the model, costs for each health state, and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) 
for each health state in a Monte Carlo simulation of 10 000 repetitions of the 
model.
RESULTS: In the lifetime model for genotype 1, effects ranged from 18.08 to 
18.40 QALYs and total costs ranged from $88 107 to $184 636. The lifetime model 
of genotype 4 treatments had a range of effects from 18.23 to 18.43 QALYs and 
total costs ranging from $87 063 to $127 637. Grazoprevir/elbasvir was the 
optimal strategy followed by velpatasvir/sofosbuvir as the second-best strategy 
in most simulations for both genotypes 1 and 4, with drug costs and efficacy of 
grazoprevir/elbasvir as the primary model drivers.
CONCLUSIONS: Grazoprevir/elbasvir was cost-effective compared with all 
strategies for genotypes 1 and 4. Effects for all strategies were similar with 
cost of drug in the initial year driving the results.

BACKGROUND: Life expectancy is a statistical measure of the average time an 
organism is expected to live. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the 
impact of injury-related mortality on life expectancy in Zhejiang Province.
METHODS: Our study used standard life tables to calculate life expectancy and 
cause-removed life expectancy based on mortality data from the Zhejiang Chronic 
Disease Surveillance System.
RESULTS: Life expectancy of residents in Zhejiang was 77.83 years in 2013, with 
females having a higher life expectancy than males. The decrease in life 
expectancy caused by injury-related deaths was 1.19 years, the effect of which 
was reduced for females and urban residents compared with males and rural 
residents. The greatest impact on life expectancy was road traffic injuries 
(RTIs), (0.29 years lost overall, 0.36 for men vs. 0.21 for women and 0.26 for 
urban residents vs. 0.31 for rural residents). The main causes were falls 
(0.29 years lost overall, 0.30 for men vs. 0.28 for women and 0.28 for urban 
residents vs. 0.30 for rural residents), followed by drowning (0.15 years lost), 
suicide (0.11 years lost), and poisoning (0.04 years). For children less than 
5 years old and elders aged over 65, drowning had a greater impact than falls.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that injury deaths had a major impact on life 
expectancy in Zhejiang. More attention should be paid to road traffic injury, 
and preventive action should be taken to reduce injury-related deaths to 
increase life expectancy, especially in children under five years of age and the 
elders over 65 years of age.

BACKGROUND: The total cost of bile duct injuries (BDIs) in an unselected 
national cohort of patients undergoing cholecystectomy are unknown. The aim was 
to evaluate costs associated with treatment of cholecystectomy-related BDIs and 
to calculate cost effectiveness of routine vs. on-demand intraoperative 
cholangiography (IOC).
METHODS: Data from Swedish patients suffering a BDI during a 5 year period were 
analysed. Questionnaires to investigate loss-of-production and health status 
(EQ-5D) were distributed to patients who suffered a BDI during cholecystectomy 
and who underwent uneventful cholecystectomy (matched control group). Costs per 
quality-adjusted-life-year (QALY) gained by intraoperative diagnosis were 
estimated for two strategies: routine versus on-demand IOC during 
cholecystectomy.
RESULTS: Intraoperative diagnosis, immediate intraoperative repair, and minor 
BDI were all associated with reduced direct treatment costs compared to 
postoperative diagnosis, delayed repair, and major BDI (all p < 0.001). No 
difference was noted in loss-of-production for minor versus major BDIs or 
between different treatment strategies. The cost per QALY gained with routine 
intraoperative cholangiography (ICER-incremental cost-effectiveness ratio) to 
achieve intraoperative diagnosis was €50,000.
CONCLUSIONS: Intraoperative detection and immediate intraoperative repair is the 
superior strategy with less than half the cost and superior functional patient 
outcomes than postoperative diagnosis and delayed repair. The cost per QALY 
gained (ICER) using routine IOC was considered reasonable.

BACKGROUND: Simvastatin plus ezetimibe reduced the risk of cardiovascular events 
in the IMProved Reduction of Outcomes: Vytorin Efficacy International 
(IMPROVE-IT) study. The aim of this study is to investigate the 
cost-effectiveness of adding ezetimibe to simvastatin treatment for patients 
with ACS based on the recently completed IMPROVE-IT trial.
METHODS: We constructed a Markov state-transition model to evaluate the costs, 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness (ICER) 
associated with co-therapy compared with simvastatin alone from a health care 
perspective. We ran separate base-case analyses assuming a trial-length and 
longer term follow-up. One-way sensitivity analyses were used to explore 
uncertainty in model parameters.
RESULTS: In the trial-length model, the ICERs compared with simvastatin alone 
were $114,400 per QALY for the combination therapy. In 5- and 10-year time 
horizons, the ICERs remained above the cost-effectiveness threshold of $50,000 
per QALY. In the lifetime horizon model, The ICER was $45,046 per QALY for 
combination treatment compared with simvastatin alone. The combination therapy 
is cost-effective at an 80% decrease in the current branded simvastatin and 
ezetimibe cost. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis suggested simvastatin and 
ezetimibe co-therapy would be a cost-effective alternative to simvastatin 
monotherapy 60.7% of the time.
CONCLUSIONS: In our trial-length, 5-year, and 10-year models, the co-therapy was 
not a cost-effective alternative; however, as follow-up was extended to 
lifetime, the co-therapy became a cost-effective treatment compared with the 
simvastatin monotherapy in patients with histories of ACS.

Despite improvements in therapy a large proportion of individuals with cancer 
will have a shortened life expectancy because of advanced or metastatic disease. 
Advances in therapy have however, extended life in those with advanced cancer 
thus heightening the importance of living well and preventing decline. The 
burdens of disease and cancer therapy impair aerobic fitness, strength, physical 
function and quality of life (QOL). Fatigue, the most common side effect of 
cancer and cancer therapy can further deteriorate QOL. Exercise has the 
potential to improve aerobic fitness, physical function, control fatigue and 
enhance QOL. However, exercise interventions are not routinely provided to those 
with advanced cancer. We present a systematic literature review of outcomes from 
interventions that include exercise for patients with advanced cancer. Studies 
were reviewed if they included an advanced cancer population and an intervention 
with a component of exercise. Overall, exercise containing interventions 
resulted in improvements in measures of aerobic capacity (14 of 19 studies) 
strength (11 of 12 studies), and components of physical function (9 of 9 
studies). Fatigue and QOL were identified to improve in slightly over half of 
all evaluated studies (11 of 19 studies and 10 of 19 studies for fatigue and QOL 
respectively). The numbers of total participants reporting improvements in QOL 
(60%) were greater than fatigue (45%). Exercise provided to individuals with 
advanced cancer maintains or improves fitness and physical function and may 
diminish fatigue and enhance QOL and should be considered as an intervention to 
prevent further health complications.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Rapid endovascular therapy (EVT) is an emerging 
treatment option for acute ischemic stroke. Several economic evaluations have 
been published examining the cost-effectiveness of EVT, and many international 
bodies are currently making adoption decisions. The objective of this study was 
to establish the cost-effectiveness of EVT for ischemic stroke patients and to 
synthesize all the publicly available economic literature.
METHODS: A systematic review of the published literature was conducted to 
identify economic evaluations and cost analyses of EVT for acute ischemic stroke 
patients. Systematic review best practices were followed, and study quality was 
assessed.
RESULTS: Four-hundred sixty-three articles were identified from electronic 
databases. After deduplication, abstract review, and full-text review, 17 
studies were included. Seven of the studies were cost analyses, and 10 were 
cost-effectiveness studies. Generally, the cost analyses reported on the cost of 
the approach/procedure or the hospitalization costs associated with EVT. All of 
the cost-effectiveness studies reported a cost per quality-adjusted life year as 
the primary outcomes. Studies varied in regards to the costs considered, the 
perspective adopted, and the time horizon used. All the studies reported a cost 
per quality-adjusted life year of <$50 000 as the primary outcome.
CONCLUSIONS: There is a robust body of evidence for the cost and 
cost-effectiveness of EVT. The cost analyses suggested that although EVT was 
associated with higher costs, it also resulted in improved patient outcomes. 
From the cost-effectiveness studies, EVT seems to be good value for money when a 
threshold of $50 000 per quality-adjusted life year gained is adopted.

We aimed to assess utility weight of health states associated with colorectal 
cancer (CRC) that reflect the societal preference of the Korean population and 
to estimate the quality-adjusted life year (QALY) loss with CRC. We recruited 
607 individuals from the Korean population; they were surveyed via face-to-face 
computer-assisted interviews. The participants evaluated each CRC-associated 
health state using standard gamble. Utility weight for each health state was 
calculated as the possibility of full health restoration. Moreover, we estimated 
total QALY loss due to CRC in Korean individuals aged ≥30 years in 2013. To 
calculate QALY due to morbidity, we yielded utility weights and used 
epidemiologic data of CRC on severity from the National Cancer Control 
Institute. QALY loss due to mortality was calculated using mortality of CRC and 
life expectancy data from the Korean Statistical Information Service. The 
highest and lowest utility weights were assigned to "adenomatous polyps" and 
"metastatic colon cancer", respectively. Total QALY loss due to CRC in Korea was 
173,662; these patients were more likely to be men or be included in the 
70-74-year age group. These utility weights may be useful for conducting 
cost-utility studies of cancer screening for CRC and for measuring disease 
burden with QALY.

Gyrations in African Mortality and their Effect on Economic Growth.

Weil DN(1).

Author information:
(1)Brown University and NBER.

I examine recent changes in African mortality and discuss their potential 
economic and demographic effects. Growth in life expectancy sharply departed 
from its trend after 1990, and then experienced a sharp acceleration after 2005. 
This latter acceleration was due overwhelmingly to improvements in HIV and 
malaria. Economists differ in their estimates of how large the structural effect 
of health on income is, with many estimates being relatively small. Taking 
seriously the delays built into many plausible causal channels would lead one to 
expect that any economic effects of these mortality changes, if they are 
detectable at all, will not appear for several decades. By contrast, the effect 
of declining mortality, especially from malaria, should soon be visible in data 
on population age structure in some countries.

BACKGROUND: Optimal distant recurrence (DR) surveillance strategies for 
extremity soft tissue sarcoma (STS) are unknown. We performed a 
cost-effectiveness analysis of different imaging modalities performed at 
guideline-specified intervals.
METHODS: We developed a Markov model simulating lifetime outcomes for 
54-year-old patients after definitive treatment for American Joint Committee on 
Cancer stage II-III extremity STS using four surveillance strategies: watchful 
waiting (WW), chest X-ray (CXR), chest computed tomography (CCT), and positron 
emission tomography-computed tomography (PET/CT). Probabilities, utilities, and 
costs were extracted from the literature and Medicare claims to determine 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER).
RESULTS: CCT was the most effective and most costly strategy with CXR the most 
cost-effective strategy at a societal willing-to-pay (WTP) of 
$100,000/quality-adjusted life year (QALY). The ICER was $12,113/QALY for CXR 
versus $104,366/QALY for CCT while PET/CT was never cost-effective. Sensitivity 
analyses demonstrated CCT becomes the preferred imaging modality as the lifetime 
risk of DR increases beyond 33% or as the WTP increases beyond $120,000/QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: Optimal DR surveillance imaging for stage II-III extremity STS 
should be individualized based on patients' risks for DR. These results suggest 
CXR, or CCT performed at more protracted intervals, may be preferred for 
lower-risk patients (i.e., DR risk <33%), whereas CCT may be preferred for 
higher-risk patients (i.e., DR risk >33%). Further study of optimal strategies 
is needed. In the interim, these findings may help to refine guidelines to 
reduce resource overutilization during routine surveillance of lower-risk 
sarcoma patients.

There is an increasing need to understand long-term metabolic changes and 
resultant comorbidities because life expectancy is increasing after pediatric 
kidney and liver transplants. We evaluated differences in classic and novel 
cardiometabolic biomarkers among obese and normal weight adolescent transplant 
recipients. We enrolled a total of 80 adolescent (mean±SD, 14.8 years ±3.0) 
transplant recipients (63 kidney, 17 liver) with mean duration from 
transplantation of 6.0 (±4.1) years. Among kidney transplant recipients, 
overweight and obese individuals had higher leptin (16.7 vs 7.5 μg/mL, P<.001), 
lower HDL (1.1 vs 1.3 mmol/L, P=.02), higher free fatty acid (0.6 vs 0.5 mmol/L, 
P=.03), higher apoB-to-apoA1 ratio (0.8 vs 0.6, P=.03), and higher glucose (5.8 
vs 4.3 mmol/L, P=.03) concentrations compared to normal weight individuals. 
Regardless of obesity status, over half of all participants (57.5%) were 
considered at high cardiometabolic risk using consensus guidelines, and this was 
more pronounced for kidney transplant recipients (61.9%). Post-transplantation 
adolescents have increased cardiometabolic risk characterized by traditional 
risk factors of obesity and diabetes. The presence of obesity significantly 
worsens biomarkers of cardiometabolic risk. Future studies should explore 
whether treatment of obesity can improve the health and long-term outcomes for 
children undergoing solid organ transplant.

Proteostasis and ageing: insights from long-lived mutant mice.

The global increase in life expectancy is creating significant medical, social 
and economic challenges to current and future generations. Consequently, there 
is a need to identify the fundamental mechanisms underlying the ageing process. 
This knowledge should help develop realistic interventions capable of combatting 
age-related disease, and thus improving late-life health and vitality. While 
several mechanisms have been proposed as conserved lifespan determinants, the 
loss of proteostasis - where proteostasis is defined here as the maintenance of 
the proteome - appears highly relevant to both ageing and disease. Several 
studies have shown that multiple proteostatic mechanisms, including the 
endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-induced unfolded protein response (UPR), the 
ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) and autophagy, appear indispensable for 
longevity in many long-lived invertebrate mutants. Similarly, interspecific 
comparisons suggest that proteostasis may be an important lifespan determinant 
in vertebrates. Over the last 20 years a number of long-lived mouse mutants have 
been described, many of which carry single-gene mutations within the 
growth-hormone, insulin/IGF-1 or mTOR signalling pathways. However, we still do 
not know how these mutations act mechanistically to increase lifespan and 
healthspan, and accordingly whether mechanistic commonality occurs between 
different mutants. Recent evidence supports the premise that the successful 
maintenance of the proteome during ageing may be linked to the increased 
lifespan and healthspan of long-lived mouse mutants.

Background/Study Context: Mobility limitations affect more than 25% of adults 
aged 70 years or older. This study tested the hypothesis that impairments in 
ankle and shoulder coordination are associated with mobility limitations among 
older adults.
METHODS: his study consisted of conducted a cross-sectional analysis from a 
sample of community-dwelling older adults (N = 130) aged ≥67 years. Motion 
capture equipment was used to collect kinematic data during rhythmic antiphase 
coordination of the right and left: (a) ankles moving in dorsi-plantarflexion; 
and (b) glenohumeral ("shoulder") moving in flexion-extension while paced by an 
auditory metronome. Coordination variability was measured as the standard 
deviation of the relative phase between right and left body segments. Mobility 
limitations were defined as a score of ≤9 on the Short Physical Performance 
Battery (SPPB). Odds ratios for mobility limitations as a function of 
coordination variability quartiles were determined using multivariable logistic 
regression.
RESULTS: Adjusting for age, gender, body mass index, number of chronic 
conditions and Mini-Mental State Examination score, the odds ratios for mobility 
limitation (SPPB score ≤9) were 7.38 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.20-24.78) 
and 15.40 (95% CI: 4.31-55.07) for the 3rd and 4th (the poorest) ankle 
coordination quartiles, respectively, and 6.73 (95% CI: 2.11-21.51) for the 4th 
shoulder coordination quartile, compared with the best (the 1st) coordination 
quartiles.
CONCLUSION: The results supported the hypothesis that impaired interlimb ankle 
and shoulder coordination are associated with the manifestation of mobility 
limitations. These findings indicate the need for further study of the role of 
coordination impairments as potential contributors to poor mobility among older 
adults.

BACKGROUND: Perilla essential oil (EO) possesses high antioxidant, antimicrobial 
and insecticidal activities, and has proven to be more reliable than chemically 
synthesized food preservatives. Nevertheless, EOs have disadvantages of facile 
photo-degradation and oxidation, which limit their use in agriculture and food 
industries. Microencapsulation technology that generates a polymeric coating 
surrounding EOs could overcome these disadvantages.
RESULTS: The EO concentration had a significant effect on encapsulation 
efficiency (EE) and loading capacity (LC). The best encapsulation conditions 
were obtained with 2% v/v EO, for which EE and LC were 57% and 36%, 
respectively. EO-loaded microspheres exhibited a crimped surface with phanic 
lumps by scanning electron microscopy. Thermal stability experiments revealed 
droplets that began to decompose sharply at 108 °C, with a 61% weight, loss, 
which was much lower than EOs of 98%. EO-loaded microcapsules demonstrated good 
antibacterial activity. Strawberry preservation studies showed that EO-loaded 
microcapsules could significantly inhibit strawberry decay, maintain the quality 
of strawberries and prolong shelf life.
CONCLUSION: Perilla EO-loaded microcapsules were successfully prepared by ionic 
gelation and were effective at inhibiting several bacterial strains. EO-alginate 
microcapsules could effectively delay the volatilization of EO. Perilla 
EO-loaded microcapsules therefore have potential for use as an antimicrobial and 
preservative agent in the food industry. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry.

AIMS: The long-term safety and efficacy of gemigliptin was evaluated in the 
present extension study after a 12-week study during a 40-week follow-up period.
METHODS: The main study was a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, 
phase IIIb study in which 50 mg of gemigliptin (N = 66) or placebo (N = 66) was 
administered to patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and moderate or 
severe renal impairment over a 12-week period. Patients with a glycated 
haemoglobin (HbA1c) level of 7% to 11% and an estimated glomerular filtration 
rate (eGFR) of 15 to 59 mL/min/1.73 m2 were enrolled in the main study. After 
12 weeks, patients in the gemigliptin group continued to receive gemigliptin 
(N = 50), whereas patients in the placebo group were transitioned from placebo 
to linagliptin (N = 52). Each group received the indicated treatment over the 
subsequent 40-week period. A total of 102 patients consented to participate in 
the extension study, and 79 patients ultimately completed the study.
RESULTS: The HbA1c levels of both groups were significantly reduced at week 52 
compared with baseline. Specifically, the adjusted mean change ± standard error 
in HbA1c level in the gemigliptin and placebo/linagliptin groups was 
1.00% ± 0.21% and 0.65% ± 0.22% lower at week 52 than at baseline (P < .001 and 
P = .003), respectively. No significant difference in the change in HbA1c level 
was found between the 2 groups (P = .148). Trends in fasting plasma glucose, 
fructosamine and glycated albumin levels in the 2 groups were similar to trends 
in HbA1c levels. The eGFR of both groups was also significantly lower at week 52 
than at baseline, and no significant difference in change in eGFR was found 
between the 2 groups. In contrast, both drugs had little effect on urinary 
albumin excretion, although both drugs significantly reduced the urinary type IV 
collagen level. The overall rates of adverse events were similar between the 2 
groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Gemigliptin and linagliptin did not differ with respect to safety 
and efficacy in patients with T2DM and renal impairment. The 2 drugs had similar 
glucose-lowering effects, and the changes in eGFR and albuminuria were also 
similar. Additionally, the risk of side effects, including hypoglycaemia, was 
similar between the 2 groups.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatment with all oral direct acting 
antiviral agents (DAA's) achieve sustained virologic response (SVR) rates of 
98%. Re-assessment of general US population screening for HCV is imperative. 
This study compared the cost-effectiveness (CE) of three HCV screening 
strategies: screen all (SA), screen Birth Cohort (BCS), and screen high risks 
(HRS).
METHODS: Using a previous designed decision-analytic Markov model, estimations 
of the natural history of HCV and CE evaluation of the three HCV screening 
strategies over a lifetime horizon in the US population was undertaken. Based on 
age and risk status, 16 cohorts were modelled. Health states included: Fibrosis 
stages 0 to 4, decompensated cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, LT, post-LT, 
and death. The probability of liver disease progression was based on the 
presence or absence of virus. Treatment was with approved all-oral DAAs; 86% 
were assumed to be seen annually by a primary care provider; SVR rates, 
transition probabilities, utilities, and costs were from the literature. One-way 
sensitivity analyses tested the impact of key model drivers.
RESULTS: SA cost $272.0 billion [$135 279 per patient] and led to 12.19 QALYs 
per patient. BCS and HRS cost $274.5 billion ($136 568 per patient) and $284.5 
billion ($141 502 per patient) with 11.65 and 11.25 QALYs per patient 
respectively. Compared to BCS, SA led to an additional 0.54 QALYs per patient 
and saved $2.59 billion; compared to HRS, SA led to 0.95 additional QALYs per 
patient and saved $12.5 billion.
CONCLUSIONS: Screening the entire US population and treating active viraemia was 
projected as cost-saving.

AbstractLatin America is among the highly endemic regions for cystic 
echinococcosis (CE). In Peru, an estimated 1,139 disability-adjusted life years 
are lost annually from surgical treatment of CE. This is comparable with the 
combined total for Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay, and Chile. The prevalence of 
human infection has been investigated in the central Peruvian Andes, but there 
are no community-based screening data from other regions of Peru. We carried out 
a population survey in January 2015 using abdominal ultrasound to estimate the 
prevalence of abdominal CE in the Canas and Canchis provinces, in the Cusco 
region of Peru. Among 1,351 subjects screened, 41 (3%) had CE. There was 
significant variation between communities with similar socioeconomic features in 
a small geographical area. A history of CE was reported by 4.1% of the screened 
subjects, among whom 30.3% still had CE on ultrasound. Among patients reporting 
previous CE treatment, 14.9% had CE in active stages. Limited education, 
community of residence, and knowing people with CE in the community were 
associated with CE. These results demonstrate a significant burden of CE in the 
region and suggest the need for further investigations, control activities, and 
optimization of clinical management for CE in this area.
