Pancreatic cancer has a dire prognosis and will represent the second leading 
cause of cancer death in the next 10 years. The multifactorial approach 
represents one of the main issues in controlling the extension of this neoplasm. 
In recent years, the characteristics of the tumor microenvironment, metastasis 
mechanisms and the relationship between immune system and neoplastic cells have 
been described, which has made it possible to understand the pathophysiology of 
pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Currently, there is a failure to provide an effective 
preventive method or early detection, so patients present with an advanced stage 
at the time of diagnosis. Despite numerous efforts, little progress has been 
made in clinical outcome and in improving survival in long term. Therefore, in 
the recent years, diverse diagnostic tests, treatments and possible approaches 
have been developed in the fields of radiotherapy, chemotherapy and surgery to 
find a combination of them that improves life expectancy in patients diagnosed 
with pancreatic cancer. At the moment, numerous clinical trials are being 
conducted to evaluate preventive diagnostic procedures such as serological 
markers or perfecting available imaging tests. On the other hand, implementation 
of immunotherapy is being studied in a neoplasm that has lagged in the 
application of this procedure since present possible treatments do not 
substantially improve quality of life. Therefore, the purpose of our study is to 
summarize the main progresses that have been made in the diagnosis, treatment 
and screening of this disease, explaining the limitations that have been 
observed and analyzing future prospects in the management of this illness.

A perilous increase in the number of bacterial infections has led to developing 
throngs of antibiotics for increasing the quality and expectancy of life. 
Pseudomonas aeruginosa is becoming resistant to all known conventional 
antimicrobial agents thereby posing a deadly threat to the human population. 
Nowadays, targeting virulence traits of infectious agents is an alternative 
approach to antimicrobials that is gaining much popularity to fight 
antimicrobial resistance. Quorum sensing (QS) involves interspecies 
communication via a chemical signaling pathway. Under this mechanism, cells work 
in a concerted manner, communicate with each other with the help of signaling 
molecules called auto-inducers (AI). The virulence of these strains is driven by 
genes, whose expression is regulated by AI, which in turn acts as 
transcriptional activators. Moreover, the problem of antibiotic-resistance in 
case of infections caused by P. aeruginosa becomes more alarming among 
immune-compromised patients, where the infectious agents easily take over the 
cellular machinery of the host while hidden in the QS mediated biofilms. 
Inhibition of the QS circuit of P. aeruginosa by targeting various signaling 
pathways such as LasR, RhlR, Pqs, and QScR transcriptional proteins will help in 
blocking downstream signal transducers which could result in reducing the 
bacterial virulence. The anti-virulence agent does not pose an immediate 
selective pressure on growing bacterium and thus reduces the pathogenicity 
without harming the target species. Here, we review exclusively, the growing 
emergence of multi-drug resistant (MDR) P. aeruginosa and the critical 
literature survey of QS inhibitors with their potential application of blocking 
P. aeruginosa infections.

A Different View for an Old Disease: NEDDylation and Other Ubiquitin-Like 
Post-Translational Modifications in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia.

Despite the enormous amount of molecular data obtained over the years, the 
molecular etiology of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is still largely 
unknown. All that information has enabled the development of new therapeutic 
approaches that have improved life expectancy of the patients but are still not 
curative. We must increase our knowledge of the molecular alterations 
responsible for the characteristics common to all CLL patients. One of such 
characteristics is the poor correlation between mRNA and protein expression, 
that suggests a role of post-translational mechanisms in CLL physiopathology. 
Drugs targeting these processes have indeed demonstrated an effect either alone 
or in combination with other aimed at specific pathways. A recent article 
unveiled an increment in ubiquitin-like modifications in CLL, with many protein 
members of relevant pathways affected. Interestingly, the inhibition of the 
NEDD8-activating protein NAE reverted a substantial number of those 
modifications. The present review gets the scarce data published about the role 
of NEDDylation in CLL together and establishes connections to what is known from 
other neoplasias, thus providing a new perspective to the underlying mechanisms 
in CLL.

Objectives: This study evaluated the long-term cost-effectiveness of ultrasound 
screening for thyroid cancer compared with non-screening in asymptomatic adults. 
Methods: Applying a Markov decision-tree model with effectiveness and cost data 
from literature, we compared the long-term cost-effectiveness of the two 
strategies: ultrasound screening and non-screening for thyroid cancer. A one-way 
sensitivity analysis and a probabilistic sensitivity analysis were performed to 
verify the stability of model results. Results: The cumulative cost of screening 
for thyroid cancer was $18,819.24, with 18.74 quality-adjusted life years 
(QALYs), whereas the cumulative cost of non-screening was $15,864.28, with 18.71 
QALYs. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $106,947.50/QALY greatly 
exceeded the threshold of $50,000. The result of the one-way sensitivity 
analysis showed that the utility values of benign nodules and utility of health 
after thyroid cancer surgery would affect the results. Conclusions: Ultrasound 
screening for thyroid cancer has no obvious advantage in terms of 
cost-effectiveness compared with non-screening. The optimized thyroid screening 
strategy for a specific population is essential.

A worsening trend of critical shortages in senior health care workers across 
low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) in sub-Saharan Africa has been 
documented for decades. This is especially the case in Ethiopia that has severe 
shortage of mental health professionals. Consistent with the WHO recommended 
approach of task sharing for mental health care in LMICs, Acceptance and 
Commitment Therapy (ACT), which is an empirically validated psychological 
intervention aimed at increasing psychological flexibility, may be delivered by 
trained laypersons who have a grassroots presence. In this paper, we discuss the 
need for and potential role of ACT to be delivered by health extension workers 
(HEWs) to address mental health care needs across Ethiopia. To this end, we also 
reviewed previous studies that have examined the effectiveness of ACT-based 
interventions in African countries including in Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Uganda, 
and South Africa. All studies revealed significant improvements of various 
mental health-related outcome measures such as decreased psychological distress 
and depressive symptoms, or increased subjective wellbeing and life satisfaction 
in the groups that received an ACT-based intervention. However, to date, there 
is no study that applied ACT in Ethiopia. Thus, more research is warranted to 
examine the effectiveness and, if proven successful, to scale up a task sharing 
approach of an ACT-based intervention being delivered by trained HEWs at a 
grassroots level, possibly paving the way for an innovative, sustainable mental 
health service in Ethiopia as well as other African LMICs.

INTRODUCTION: Our aim was to describe the development and validation of an 
obesity model representing the cardiovascular risks associated with different 
body mass index (BMI) categories, through simulation, designed to evaluate the 
epidemiological and economic impact of population policies for obesity.
METHODS: A discrete event simulation model was built in R considering the risk 
of cardiovascular events (heart failure, stroke, coronary heart disease, and 
diabetes) associated with BMI categories in the Spanish population. The main 
parameters included in the model were estimated from Spanish hospital discharge 
records and the Spanish Health Survey and allowed both first-order and 
second-order (probabilistic sensitivity analysis) uncertainty to be programmed 
into the model. The simulation yielded the incidence and prevalence of 
cardiovascular events as validation outputs. To illustrate the capacity of the 
model, we estimated the reduction in cardiovascular events and cost-utility 
(incremental cost/incremental quality-adjusted life-years [QALYs]) of a 
hypothetical intervention that fully eliminated the cardiovascular risks 
associated with obesity and overweight.
RESULTS: The Validation Status of Health-Economic decision models (AdViSHE) tool 
was applied. Internal validation plots showed adequate goodness of fit for the 
Spanish population. External validation was achieved by comparing the simulated 
and real incidence by age group for stroke, acute myocardial infarction, and 
heart failure. The intervention reduced the population hazard ratios of stroke, 
acute myocardial infarction, and heart failure to 0.81, 0.74, and 0.78, 
respectively, and added 0.74 QALYs to the whole population.
CONCLUSIONS: This obesity simulation model evidenced good properties for 
estimating the long-term epidemiological and economic impact of policies to 
tackle obesity in Spain. The conceptual model could be implemented for other 
counties using country-specific input data.

BACKGROUND: Osteoarthritis-related insomnia is the most common form of comorbid 
insomnia among older Americans. A randomized clinical trial found that six 
sessions of telephone-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia 
(CBT-I) improved sleep outcomes in this population. Using these data, we 
evaluated the incremental cost-effectiveness of CBT-I from a healthcare sector 
perspective.
METHODS: The study was based on 325 community-dwelling older adults with 
insomnia and osteoarthritis pain enrolled with Kaiser Permanente of Washington 
State. We measured quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) using the EuroQol 
5-dimension scale. Arthritis-specific quality of life was measured using the 
Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC). 
Insomnia-specific quality of life was measured using the Insomnia Severity Index 
(ISI) and nights without clinical insomnia (i.e., "insomnia-free nights"). Total 
healthcare costs included intervention and healthcare utilization costs.
RESULTS: Over the 12 months after randomization, CBT-I improved ISI and WOMAC by 
-2.6 points (95% CI: -2.9 to -2.4) and -2.6 points (95% CI: -3.4 to -1.8), 
respectively. The ISI improvement translated into 89 additional insomnia-free 
nights (95% CI: 79 to 98) over the 12 months. CBT-I did not significantly reduce 
total healthcare costs (-$1072 [95% CI: -$1968 to $92]). Improvements in 
condition-specific measures were not reflected in QALYs gained (-0.01 [95% CI: 
-0.01 to 0.01]); at a willingness-to-pay of $150,000 per QALY, CBT-I resulted in 
a positive net monetary benefit of $369 with substantial uncertainty (95% CI: 
-$1737 to $2270).
CONCLUSION: CBT-I improved sleep and arthritis function without increasing 
costs. These findings support the consideration of telephone CBT-I for treating 
insomnia among older adults with comorbid OA. Our findings also suggest 
potential limitations of the general quality of life measures in assessing 
interventions designed to improve sleep and arthritis outcomes.

BACKGROUND: The survival benefit of primary external beam radiation therapy 
(EBRT) has never been formally tested in elderly men who were newly diagnosed 
with metastatic prostate cancer (mPCa). We hypothesized that elderly patients 
may not benefit of EBRT to the extent as younger newly diagnosed mPCa patients, 
due to shorter life expectancy.
METHODS: We relied on Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (2004-2016) to 
identify elderly newly diagnosed mPCa patients, aged >75 years. Kaplan-Meier, 
univariable and multivariable Cox regression models, as well as Competing Risks 
Regression models tested the effect of EBRT versus no EBRT on overall mortality 
(OM) and cancer-specific mortality (CSM).
RESULTS: Of 6556 patients, 1105 received EBRT (16.9%). M1b stage was predominant 
in both EBRT (n = 823; 74.5%) and no EBRT (n = 3908; 71.7%, p = 0.06) groups, 
followed by M1c (n = 211; 19.1% vs. n = 1042; 19.1%, p = 1) and M1a (n = 29; 
2.6% vs. n = 268; 4.9%, p < 0.01). Median overall survival (OS) was 23 months 
for EBRT and 23 months for no EBRT (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.97, p = 0.6). 
Similarly, median cancer-specific survival (CSS) was 29 months for EBRT versus 
30 months for no EBRT (HR: 1.04, p = 0.4). After additional multivariable 
adjustment, EBRT was not associated with lower OM or lower CSM in the entire 
cohort, as well as after stratification for M1b and M1c substages.
CONCLUSIONS: In elderly men who were newly diagnosed with mPCa, EBRT does not 
affect OS or CSS. In consequence, our findings question the added value of local 
EBRT in elderly newly diagnosed mPCa patients.

INTRODUCTION: Increasing numbers of older patients are undergoing emergency 
laparotomy (EL). They are at increased risk of adverse outcomes, making the 
shared decision on whether to operate challenging. This retrospective cohort 
study aimed to assess the role of age and life-expectancy predictions on short- 
and long-term survival in patients undergoing EL.
METHODS: All patients who underwent EL at one hospital in the West of Scotland 
between March 2014 to December 2016 were included. Clinical parameters were 
collected, and patients were followed up to allow reporting of 30-, 60- and 
90-day and 1-year mortality rates. Period life expectancy was used to stratify 
patients into below life expectancy (bLEP) and at-or-above life expectancy 
(aLEP) groups at presentation. Remaining life expectancy was used to calculate 
the net years of life gained (NYLG).
RESULTS: Some 462 patients underwent EL: 20 per cent in the aLEP group. These 
patients were older (P < 0.001), had more co-morbidities (P < 0.001) and were 
high risk on P-POSSUM scoring (P = 0.008). The 30-, 60- and 90-day and 1-year 
mortality rates were 11, 14, 16 and 23 per cent respectively. Advanced age (P = 
0.011) and high ASA score (P = 0.004) and P-POSSUM score (P < 0.001) were 
independent predictors of death at 1 year on multivariable analysis. The cohort 
NYLG were 19.2 years. Comparing patients aged less than 70 with those aged 70 
years or older, the NYLG were 25.9 versus 5.5 years. Comparing bLEP and aLEP, 
the NYLG were 22.2 versus 4.4 years. In patients aged 70 years and older, NYLG 
decreased by more than half in patients with co-morbidities (ASA score 3,4,5) 
(9.3 versus 4.3 years).
CONCLUSION: Discussions around long-term outcomes after emergency surgery remain 
difficult. Although age is an influencing factor, predicted life expectancy 
alone does not provide additional value to shared decision making.

BACKGROUND: Nasal septum perforations (NSP) have many uncomfortable symptoms for 
the patient and a highly negative impact on quality of life. NSPs are closed 
using patient-specific implants or surgery. Implants are created either under 
anesthesia using silicone impressions or using 3D models from CT data. 
Disadvantages for patient safety are the increased risk of morbidity or 
radiation exposure.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the context of otorhinolaryngologic surgery, we 
present a gentle approach to treating NSP with a new image-based, contactless, 
and radiation-free measurement method using a 3D endoscope. The method relies on 
image information only and makes use of real-time capable computer vision 
algorithms to compute 3D information. This endoscopic method can be repeated as 
often as desired in the clinical course and has already proven its accuracy and 
robustness for robotic-assisted surgery (RAS) and surgical microscopy. We expand 
our method for nasal surgery, as there are additional spatial and 
stereoperspective challenges.
RESULTS: After measuring 3 relevant parameters (NSP extension: axial, coronal, 
and NSP circumference) of 6 patients and comparing the results of 2 
stereoendoscopes with CT data, it was shown that the image-based measurements 
can achieve comparable accuracies to CT data. One patient could be only 
partially evaluated because the NSP was larger than the endoscopic field of 
view.
CONCLUSION: Based on the very good measurements, we outline a therapeutic 
procedure which should enable the production of patient-specific NSP implants 
based on endoscopic data only.

Haloferax volcanii AglD is currently the only archaeal dolichol phosphate 
(DolP)-mannose synthase shown to participate in N-glycosylation. However, the 
relation between AglD and Pyrococcus furiosus PF0058, the only archaeal 
DolP-mannose synthase for which structural information is presently available, 
was unclear. In this report, similarities between the PF0058 and AglD catalytic 
domains were revealed. At the same time, AglD includes a transmembrane domain 
far longer than that of PF0058 or other DolP-mannose synthases. To determine 
whether this extension affords AglD functions in addition to generating 
mannose-charged DolP, a series of Hfx. volcanii strains expressing truncated 
versions of AglD was generated. Mass spectrometry revealed that a version of 
AglD comprising the catalytic domain and only two of the six to nine predicted 
membrane-spanning domains could mediate mannose addition to DolP. However, in 
cells expressing this or other truncated versions of AglD, mannose was not 
transferred from the lipid to the protein-bound tetrasaccharide precursor of the 
N-linked pentasaccharide normally decorating Hfx. volcanii glycoproteins. These 
results thus point to AglD as contributing to additional aspects of Hfx. 
volcanii N-glycosylation beyond charging DolP with mannose. Accordingly, the 
possibility that AglD, possibly in coordination with AglR, translocates 
DolP-mannose across the plasma membrane is discussed.

Recent literature has documented a widening gap in mortality between older 
individuals of high versus low socioeconomic status (SES) in the U.S. This paper 
investigates whether this trend will continue. We analyze the health status of 
successive cohorts of 54-60-year-old U.S. individuals born between 1934 and 1959 
and use a rich set of health indicators to forecast life expectancies. The 
detailed health measures come from the longitudinal Health and Retirement Study. 
We find that many health indicators have worsened recently. For example, rates 
of obesity, diabetes, and self-reported levels of pain sharply increased between 
1992 and 2016. Directly relevant for mortality, recent cohorts report lower 
subjective survival probabilities. Using Social Security wealth as an SES 
indicator, we find strong evidence for increasing health inequalities. We 
predict overall life expectancy to increase further; but the increase will be 
concentrated among higher SES individuals and mortality inequality will continue 
to increase.

in Sub-Saharan Africa.

COVID-19 has had considerable global impact; however, in sub-Saharan Africa, it 
is one of several infectious disease priorities. Prioritization is normally 
guided by disease burden, but the highly age-dependent nature of COVID-19 and 
that of other infectious diseases make comparisons challenging unless considered 
through metrics that incorporate life-years lost and time lived with adverse 
health. Therefore, we compared the 2020 mortality and disability-adjusted 
life-years (DALYs) lost estimates for malaria, tuberculosis, and HIV/AIDS in 
sub-Saharan African populations with more than 12 months of COVID-19 burden 
(until the end of March 2021) by applying known age-related mortality to United 
Nations estimates of the age structure. We further compared exacerbations of 
disease burden predicted from the COVID-19 public health response. Data were 
derived from public sources and predicted exacerbations were derived from those 
published by international agencies. For sub-Saharan African populations north 
of South Africa, the estimated recorded COVID-19 DALYs lost in 2020 were 3.7%, 
2.3%, and 2.4% of those for tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS, and malaria, respectively. 
Predicted exacerbations of these diseases were greater than the estimated 
COVID-19 burden. Including South Africa and Lesotho, COVID-19 DALYs lost were < 
12% of those for other compared diseases; furthermore, the mortality of compared 
diseases were dominant in all age groups younger than 65 years. This analysis 
suggests the relatively low impact of COVID-19. Although all four epidemics 
continue, tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS, and malaria remain far greater health 
priorities based on their disease burdens. Therefore, resource diversion to 
COVID-19 poses a high risk of increasing the overall disease burden and causing 
net harm, thereby further increasing global inequities in health and life 
expectancy.

BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes (T2D) causes substantial disease burden and is 
projected to affect an increasing number of people in coming decades. This study 
provides projected estimates of life years free of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and 
years of life lost ([Formula: see text]) associated with T2D for Germany in the 
years 2015 and 2040.
METHODS: Based on an illness-death model and the associated mathematical 
relation between prevalence, incidence and mortality, we projected the 
prevalence of diagnosed T2D using currently available data on the incidence rate 
of diagnosed T2D and mortality rates of people with and without diagnosed T2D. 
Projection of prevalence was achieved by integration of a partial differential 
equation, which governs the illness-death model. These projected parameters were 
used as input values to calculate life years free of T2D and [Formula: see text] 
associated with T2D for the German population aged 40 to 100 years in the years 
2015 and 2040, while accounting for different assumptions on future trends in 
T2D incidence and mortality.
RESULTS: Assuming a constant incidence rate, women and men at age 40 years in 
2015 will live approximately 38 years and 33 years free of T2D, respectively. Up 
to the year 2040, these numbers are projected to increase by 1.0 years and 
1.3 years. Assuming a decrease in T2D-associated excess mortality of 2% per 
year, women and men aged 40 years with T2D in 2015 will be expected to lose 1.6 
and 2.7 years of life, respectively, compared to a same aged person without T2D. 
In 2040, these numbers would reduce by approximately 0.9 years and 1.6 years. 
This translates to 10.8 million and 6.4 million [Formula: see text] in the 
German population aged 40-100 years with prevalent T2D in 2015 and 2040, 
respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Given expected trends in mortality and no increase in T2D 
incidence, the burden due to premature mortality associated with T2D will 
decrease on the individual as well as on the population level. In addition, the 
expected lifetime without T2D is likely to increase. However, these trends 
strongly depend on future improvements of excess mortality associated with T2D 
and future incidence of T2D, which should motivate increased efforts of primary 
and tertiary prevention.

Dementia has a devastating impact on the quality of life of patients and 
families and comes with a huge cost to society. Dementia prevention is 
considered a public health priority by the World Health Organization. Delaying 
the onset of dementia by treating associated risk factors will bring huge 
individual and societal benefit. Empirical evidence suggests that, in 
higher-income countries, dementia incidence is decreasing as a result of 
healthier lifestyles. This observation supports the notion that preventing 
dementia is possible and that a certain degree of prevention is already in 
action. Further reduction of dementia incidence through deliberate prevention 
plans is needed to counteract its growing prevalence due to increasing life 
expectancy.An increasing number of individuals with normal cognitive performance 
seek help in the current memory clinics asking an evaluation of their dementia 
risk, preventive interventions, or interventions to ameliorate their cognitive 
performance. Consistent evidence suggests that some of these individuals are 
indeed at increased risk of dementia. This new health demand asks for a shift of 
target population, from patients with cognitive impairment to worried but 
cognitively unimpaired individuals. However, current memory clinics do not have 
the programs and protocols in place to deal with this new population.We envision 
the development of new services, henceforth called Brain Health Services, 
devoted to respond to demands from cognitively unimpaired individuals concerned 
about their risk of dementia. The missions of Brain Health Services will be (i) 
dementia risk profiling, (ii) dementia risk communication, (iii) dementia risk 
reduction, and (iv) cognitive enhancement. In this paper, we present the 
organizational and structural challenges associated with the set-up of Brain 
Health Services.

Anti-retroviral therapy (ART) improves life expectancy in people living with HIV 
(PWH), but it remains unclear how chronic HIV infection affects normal aging of 
the immune system. Plasma cell-free protein expression and immune phenotypes 
were assessed in blood from ART treated PWH (19-77yrs, n = 106) and age-matched, 
HIV-negative controls (HC, n = 103). Using univariate spearman correlation, we 
identified 277 and 491 age-associated parameters out of a total 1,357 in HC and 
PWH, respectively. PWH exhibited shared and distinct age-associated immune 
profiles compared to HC highlighting the effect of HIV infection on 
immunological aging. Our analysis resulted in an 8-parameter, plasma-detectable 
inflammatory index that correlated with chronological age of all study 
participants but was higher overall in PWH. Additionally, predictive modeling 
for age in HC participants and age-associated parameters generated a 
25-parameter signature, IMAP-25, with 70% and 53% accuracy in HC and PWH, 
respectively. Applying the IMAP-25 signature to immunological data from PWH 
revealed accelerated aging in PWH by 5.6 yrs. Overall, our results demonstrate 
that immune signatures, easily monitored in human blood samples, can be used as 
an indicator of one's 'immunological age' during ART-treated HIV infection and 
can be applied to other disease states that affect the immune system.

Bovine paratuberculosis (PTB), caused by Mycobacterium avium subsp. 
paratuberculosis (MAP), is a chronic granulomatous enteritis that affects cattle 
worldwide. According to their severity and extension, PTB-associated 
histological lesions have been classified into the following groups; focal, 
multifocal, and diffuse. It is unknown whether these lesions represent 
sequential stages or divergent outcomes. In the current study, the associations 
between host genetic and pathology were explored by genotyping 813 Spanish 
Holstein cows with no visible lesions (N = 373) and with focal (N = 371), 
multifocal (N = 33), and diffuse (N = 33) lesions in gut tissues and regional 
lymph nodes. DNA from peripheral blood samples of these animals was genotyped 
with the bovine EuroG MD Bead Chip, and the corresponding genotypes were imputed 
to whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data using the 1000 Bull genomes reference 
population. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) was performed using the WGS 
data and the presence or absence of each type of histological lesion in a 
case-control approach. A total of 192 and 92 single nucleotide polymorphisms 
(SNPs) defining 13 and 9 distinct quantitative trait loci (QTLs) were 
highly-associated (P ≤ 5 × 10-7) with the multifocal (heritability = 0.075) and 
the diffuse (heritability = 0.189) lesions, respectively. No overlap was seen in 
the SNPs controlling these distinct pathological outcomes. The identified QTLs 
overlapped with some QTLs previously associated with PTB susceptibility, bovine 
tuberculosis susceptibility, clinical mastitis, somatic cell score, bovine 
respiratory disease susceptibility, tick resistance, IgG level, and length of 
productive life. Pathway analysis with candidate genes overlapping the 
identified QTLs revealed a significant enrichment of the keratinization pathway 
and cholesterol metabolism in the animals with multifocal and diffuse lesions, 
respectively. To test whether the enrichment of SNP variants in candidate genes 
involved in the cholesterol metabolism was associated with the diffuse lesions; 
the levels of total cholesterol were measured in plasma samples of cattle with 
focal, multifocal, or diffuse lesions or with no visible lesions. Our results 
showed reduced levels of plasma cholesterol in cattle with diffuse lesions. 
Taken together, our findings suggested that the variation in MAP-associated 
pathological outcomes might be, in part, genetically determined and indicative 
of distinct host responses.

AIM: To evaluate the cost-consequences of the investment for anti-hepatitis C 
virus (HCV) treatment by the Italian National Health System (NHS) for patients 
who will be newly diagnosed through active HCV screening, implemented in Italy 
from 2020.
METHODS: A previously published Markov model was used to estimate the disease 
complications avoided and the associated savings over 20 years to treat a 
standardised population of 10,000 HCV-infected patients diagnosed as a result of 
screening. Disease progression probabilities and fibrosis stage distribution 
were based on previously reported data in the literature. Real-life treatment 
effectiveness and medical expenses for disease management were estimated 
starting from a representative cohort of HCV-treated patients in Italy (Italian 
Platform for the Study of Viral Hepatitis Therapies). The breakeven point in 
time (BPT) was defined as the years required for the initial investment in 
treatment to be recovered in terms of cumulative costs saved.
RESULTS: Over a 20-year time horizon, the treatment of 10,000 standardized 
patients diagnosed through active HCV screening results in 7769 avoided events 
of progression, which are associated with €838.73 million net savings accrued by 
the Italian NHS. The initial investment in treatment is recouped in 4.3 years in 
the form of savings from disease complications avoided.
CONCLUSION: Investment in treatment of newly diagnosed patients will bring a 
significant reduction in disease complications, which is associated with great 
economic benefits. This type of action can reduce the infection rate as well as 
the clinical and economic disease burden of HCV in Italy.
