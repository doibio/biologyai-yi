[Organ replacement therapy - renal replacement therapy in intensive care

Critically ill patients who are treated in an intensive care unit are at 
increased risk of developing acute renal failure. Every episode of renal failure 
decreases life expectancy. However, acute renal failure is no longer an 
immediate cause of death because renal function can be substituted medically and 
mechanically, by the use of renal replacement therapy. Hemodialysis and 
hemofiltration are the 2 fundamental modalities of renal replacement therapy and 
may be performed intermittently or continuously. The decision for one particular 
therapy has to be made for each patient individually. Peritoneal dialysis is an 
alternative treatment for acute renal failure, but is not available for 
immediate use in most centers. Contrast media and rhabdomyolysis are 2 common 
causes of toxic renal failure in the intensive care unit. However, they cannot 
be prevented by hemodialysis.

[Management of rheumatoid arthritis].

Rheumatoid arthritis is the most common inflammatory rheumatic disease. Due to 
the destruction of joints in the course of the disease it leads to significant 
morbidity in affected patients. The quality of life and even life expectancy can 
be severely impaired. Early diagnosis and early initiation of treatment is 
a decisive step towards a more benign course of the disease. New classification 
criteria have been published in order to help in early diagnosis. Methods of 
imaging, such as ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging help in the detection 
of synovitis, which is the major pathomorphological manifestation of arthritis 
and should be identified without any doubt. Treatment follows the rule of treat 
to target with the aim of achieving remission or if this is not realistic, at 
least the lowest possible level of disease activity. The first and perhaps most 
important step in therapy is the initiation of methotrexate or if 
contraindications are present, another disease-modifying antirheumatic drug 
(DMARD) as soon as the diagnosis is made. Initial addition of glucocorticoids is 
recommended, which should be reduced in dose and terminated as soon as possible. 
Furthermore, either the combination of different DMARDs or the start of biologic 
DMARDs, such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) inhibitors or second 
generation biologic DMARDs is possible as a treatment option. The treatment 
follows the rule of shared decision-making and is the standard to treat 
comorbidities, the use an interdisciplinary approach and to treat functional 
deficits by rehabilitation measures, such as physiotherapy.

posttraumatic stress symptoms among trauma survivors.

OBJECTIVE: These studies examined whether exposure to traumatic events at 
different stages of life would predict posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) in 
old age. Furthermore, the regulating role of perceptions that relate to one's 
future time horizons (subjective life expectancy, SLE) and age (subjective age) 
were also examined.
METHOD AND RESULTS: It was hypothesized that exposure to trauma would predict 
more PTSS, and that this association would be moderated by SLE and subjective 
age, so that for those with higher SLE and a younger subjective age, exposure to 
trauma will have a weaker association with PTSS. Study 1 (N = 294) revealed that 
among Israeli war veterans (mean age 57), those who experienced the trauma of 
war captivity in the Yom Kippur War reported higher PTSS than comparable 
veterans, and that the relationship between captivity and PTSS was weaker for 
those with a higher SLE. Study 2 (N = 339), which was based on older adults who 
were currently exposed to ongoing rocket fire in the south of Israel (mean age 
65), revealed the same pattern of findings: Exposure to rocket fire predicted 
more PTSS, but this relationship was weaker among those with a higher SLE. 
Subjective age did not reveal a moderation effect.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that different traumatic experiences, 
whether belonging to one's past or whether currently ongoing, predict PTSS in 
later life. Moreover, it appears that subjective time horizons until death, but 
not subjective age since birth, can buffer against the negative effect of the 
trauma. (PsycINFO Database Record

AIMS: Therapy-related consequences of treatment for type 1 diabetes mellitus 
(T1DM), such as weight gain and hypoglycaemia, act as a barrier to attaining 
optimal glycaemic control, indirectly influencing the incidence of vascular 
complications and associated morbidity and mortality. This study quantifies the 
individual and combined contribution of changes in hypoglycaemia frequency, 
weight and HbA1c to predicted quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) within a T1DM 
population.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We describe the Cardiff Type 1 Diabetes (CT1DM) Model, 
originally informed by the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) and 
updated with the Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications (EDIC) 
study and Swedish National Diabetes Registry for microvascular and 
cardiovascular complications respectively. We report model validation results 
and the QALY impact of HbA1c, weight and hypoglycaemia changes.
RESULTS: Validation results demonstrated coefficients of determination for 
clinical endpoints of R2 = 0.863 (internal R2 = 0.999; external R2 = 0.823), 
costs R2 = 0.980 and QALYs R2 = 0.951. Achieving and maintaining a 1% HbA1c 
reduction was estimated to provide 0.61 additional discounted QALYs. Weight 
changes of ±1kg, ±2kg or ±3kg led to discounted QALY changes of ±0.03, ±0.07 and 
±0.10 respectively, while modifying hypoglycaemia frequency by -10%, -20% or 
-30% resulted in changes of -0.05, -0.11 and -0.17. The differences in 
discounted costs, life-years and QALYs associated with HbA1c 6% versus 10% were 
-£19,037, 2.49 and 2.35 respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Using a model updated with contemporary epidemiological data, this 
study presents an outcome-focused perspective to assessing the health economic 
consequences of differing levels of glycaemic control in T1DM with and without 
weight and hypoglycaemia effects.

[The Role of a Modular Universal Tumour and Revision System (MUTARS®) in Lower 
Limb Endoprosthetic Revision Surgery - Outcome Analysis of 25 Patients].

Introduction/Background: With extended life expectancy, the number of primary 
joint arthroplasties has also increased. Revision surgery is also more often 
necessary, due to aseptic or septic loosening of the prosthesis or 
periprosthetic fracture. Large bone defects often occur in these patients and 
several non-modular, conventional implants are available to handle this 
difficult situation. Custom made implants offer an individually designed and 
defect-adapted shape with perfect covering of the lesion, but may delay the 
operation. The Modular Universal Tumor And Revision System (MUTARS®) offers the 
possibility to vary the length and angle of the femoral neck and the antetorsion 
angle. Thus, it permits intraoperative adaption to the individual patient's 
defect. The aim of our study is to present clinical, functional results and the 
rate of complications in a cohort of patients undergoing revision surgery for 
failed endoprosthetic replacement or failed trauma surgery, using the Modular 
Universal Tumor And Revision System with short-to midterm follow-up. Patients 
and Methods: Between August 2005 and September 2014, 25 patients (17 female, 8 
male) with an average age of 72 years (min. 56, max. 92 years) were included in 
a retrospective study using the MUTARS® system. The patients underwent surgical 
revision of osseous defects that were not susceptible to conventional care. The 
mean follow-up was 16 months (min. 12, max. 72 months). The indications which 
led to revision surgery were as follows: loosened metal-on-metal prosthesis with 
an acetabular defect caused by a metal-induced granuloma (n = 1), 
pseudoarthrosis after implantation of femur nail (n = 2), cut-out of a femur 
nail (n = 1), aseptic loosening of an implanted endoprosthesis (n = 4), septic 
loosening of an implanted endoprosthesis (n = 1), periprosthetic fracture (n = 
6) and periprosthetic infection after two stage revision surgery (infection 
consolidated Girdlestone situation) (n = 10). All patients were followed up at 
regular intervals, both clinically and radiologically. Apart from comorbidities, 
clinical and functional parameters were measured, including the Harris Hip 
Score. An outcome analysis was also performed with respect to peri- and 
postoperative complications. Serial plain X-rays were followed-up. Results: In 
all patients, stable reconstruction without the use of an allograft was 
possible. In total, 23 patients underwent surgery by using a proximal femur 
prosthesis; three patients also received a custom made acetabular component. One 
patient was treated by using a distal femur and one patient was treated by 
implantation of a total femur prosthesis. The average length of hospital stay 
was 25 days (min.11, max. 47 days). The Harris Hip Score improved from 28 points 
preoperatively to 81 points after surgery.In total we recorded 24 % of 
complications after surgery. Two patients suffered recurrent periprosthetic 
infection and the prosthesis had to be revised in a further two stage exchange; 
one patient had a tractus gap and was revised by surgery. Two patients suffered 
periprosthetic fracture due to trauma and the patient with the total femur 
prosthesis suffered recurrent periprosthetic infection of the silver - coated 
mega-prosthesis and committed suicide triggered by an episode of major 
depression. Conclusion: Because of its modular nature, the Modular Tumor And 
Revision System (MUTARS®) can be used for highly variable intraoperative defect 
adaption. Good clinical and functional results were achieved in patients with 
excessive bone defects. However, the high rate of infection, even with silver 
coated mega-implants, is still a problem and should be studied further.

BACKGROUND: Falling participation by young women in cervical screening has been 
observed at a time that has seen an increase in the incidence of cervical cancer 
in the UK in women aged < 35 years. Various barriers to screening have been 
documented, including fear, embarrassment and inconvenience.
OBJECTIVES: To measure the feasibility, clinical effectiveness and 
cost-effectiveness of a range of interventions to increase the uptake of 
cervical screening among young women.
DESIGN: A cluster randomised trial based on general practices performed in two 
phases.
SETTING: Primary care in Greater Manchester and the Grampian region in Scotland.
PARTICIPANTS: Phase 1: 20,879 women receiving their first invitation for 
cervical screening. Phase 2: 10,126 women who had not attended by 6 months.
INTERVENTIONS: Phase 1: pre-invitation leaflet or not, and access to online 
booking (Manchester only). Phase 2: (1) vaginal self-sampling kits (SSKs) sent 
unrequested (n = 1141); or (2) offered on request (n = 1290); (3) provided with 
a timed appointment (n = 1629); (4) offered access to a nurse navigator (NN) 
(n = 1007); or (5) offered a choice between a NN or a SSK (n = 1277); and 3782 
women in control practices.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Uplift in screening compared with control practices, 
cost-effectiveness of interventions, and the women's preferences explored in a 
discrete choice experiment.
RESULTS: The pre-invitation leaflet and offer of online booking were ineffective 
when compared with control practices at 3 months, 18.8% versus 19.2% [odds ratio 
(OR) 0.96, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.88 to 1.06; p = 0.485] and 17.8% 
versus 17.2% (OR 1.02, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.20; p = 0.802), respectively. The uptake 
of screening at 3 months was higher among previously human papillomavirus 
(HPV)-vaccinated women than unvaccinated women, 23.7% versus 11% (OR 2.07, 95% 
CI 1.69 to 2.53; p < 0.001). Among non-attenders, the SSK sent intervention 
showed a statistically significant increase in uptake at 12 months post 
invitation, 21.3% versus 16.2% (OR 1.51, 95% CI 1.20 to 1.91; p = 0.001), as did 
timed appointments, 19.8% versus 16.2% (OR 1.41, 95% CI 1.14 to 1.74; 
p = 0.001). The offer of a NN, a SSK on request, and a choice between timed 
appointments and NN were ineffective. Overall, there was a gradual rather than 
prompt response, as demonstrated by uptake among control practices. A discrete 
choice experiment indicated that women invited who had not yet attended valued 
the attributes inherent in self-sampling. The health economic analysis showed 
that both timed appointments and unsolicited SSK sent were likely to be 
cost-effective at a cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained of £7593 
and £8434, respectively, if extended across the national 25-year-old cohort 
throughout the duration of screening. The certainty of these being 
cost-effective at a ceiling ratio of £20,000 per QALY gained was > 90%.
CONCLUSION: Women receiving their initial screening invitation frequently delay 
taking up the offer and the net impact of interventions was small. Timed 
appointments and SSKs sent to non-attenders at 6 months are likely to be a 
cost-effective means of increasing uptake and should be considered further. HPV 
vaccination in the catch-up programme was associated with an increased uptake of 
cervical screening. Future work should focus on optimising self-sampling in 
terms of age range, timing of offer for non-attenders and use of urine testing 
instead of vaginal samples.

INTRODUCTION: People living with advanced chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
(COPD) suffer from significant morbidity, reduced quality of life and high 
mortality, and are likely to benefit from many aspects of a palliative care 
approach. Prognostic estimates are a meaningful part of decision-making and 
better evidence for such estimates would facilitate advance care planning. We 
aim to provide quality evidence on known prognostic variables and scores which 
predict a prognosis in COPD of <12 months for use in the community.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will conduct a systematic review of randomised or 
quasi-randomised controlled trials, prospective and retrospective longitudinal 
cohort and case-control studies on prognostic variables, multivariate scores or 
models for COPD. The search will cover the period up to April 2016. Study 
selection will follow the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and 
Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, with data extraction using fields from the 
Critical Appraisal and Data Extraction for Systematic Reviews of Prediction 
Modelling Studies (CHARMS) checklist for multivariate models, and study quality 
will be assessed using a modified version of the Quality In Prognosis Studies 
(QUIPS) tool.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The results will be disseminated through peer-reviewed 
publications and national and international conference presentations.

With the life expectancy of individuals in the developed nations reaching 
historic highs, the incidence of dementia within the aging population is also 
increasing. Of the known causes of dementia, the major culprit is Alzheimer's 
disease (AD). The numbers of individuals suffering from AD is expected to nearly 
triple over the next 35 years unless medical science can identify better methods 
for diagnosing and treating AD. Fortunately, proteomics technologies have not 
only rapidly matured in the past few decades but also have been effectively 
applied so that the biomarkers of AD can be more effectively vetted and 
analyzed. The effectiveness of the technologies described in this paper enable 
the efficacy of drugs aimed at treating AD to be tested much faster than the 
previously possible and enable the more accurate selection of patients that are 
suitable for clinical trials.

Neonatal infections are estimated to account for a quarter of the 2·8 million 
annual neonatal deaths, as well as approximately 3% of all disability-adjusted 
life-years. Despite this burden, few data are available on incidence, aetiology, 
and outcomes, particularly regarding impairment. We aimed to develop guidelines 
for improved scientific reporting of observational neonatal infection studies, 
to increase comparability and to strengthen research in this area. This 
checklist, Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology 
for Newborn Infection (STROBE- NI), is an extension of the STROBE (Strengthening 
the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology) statement. STROBE-NI was 
developed following systematic reviews of published literature (1996-2015), 
compilation of more than 130 potential reporting recommendations, and 
circulation of a survey to relevant professionals worldwide, eliciting responses 
from 147 professionals from 37 countries. An international consensus meeting of 
18 participants (with expertise in infectious diseases, neonatology, 
microbiology, epidemiology, and statistics) identified priority recommendations 
for reporting, additional to the STROBE statement. Implementation of these 
STROBE-NI recommendations, and linked checklist, aims to improve scientific 
reporting of neonatal infection studies, increasing data utility and allowing 
meta-analyses and pathogen-specific burden estimates to inform global policy and 
new interventions, including maternal vaccines.

Hemicelluloses are widely used to prepare gel materials because of their 
renewability, biodegradability, and biocompatibility. Here, molecular chain 
extension of hemicelluloses was obtained in a two-step process. Composite 
hydrogels were prepared via free radical graft copolymerization of crosslinked 
quaternized hemicelluloses (CQH) and acrylic acid (AA) in the presence of 
crosslinking agent N,N'-methylenebisacrylamide (MBA). This chain extension 
strategy significantly improved the mechanical performance of the resulting 
hydrogels. The crosslinking density, compression modulus, and swelling 
capacities of hydrogels were tuned by changing the AA/CQH and MBA/CQH contents. 
Moreover, the biocompatibility test suggests that the hemicelluloses-based 
hydrogels exhibited no toxicity to cells and allowed cell growth. Taken 
together, these properties demonstrated that the composite hydrogels have

The general health status of a population changes over time, generally in a 
positive direction. Some generations experience more unfavourable conditions 
than others. The health of Danish women in the interwar generations is an 
example of such a phenomenon. The stagnation in their life expectancy between 
1977 and 1995 is thought to be related to their smoking behaviour. So far, no 
study has measured the absolute effect of smoking on the mortality of the 
interwar generations of Danish women and thus the stagnation in Danish women's 
life expectancy. We applied a method to estimate age-specific 
smoking-attributable number of deaths to examine the effect of smoking on the 
trends in partial life expectancy of Danish women between age 50 and 85 from 
1950 to 2012. We compared these trends to those for women in Sweden, where there 
was no similar stagnation in life expectancy. When smoking-attributable 
mortality was excluded, the gap in partial life expectancy at age 50 between 
Swedish and Danish women diminished substantially. The effect was most 
pronounced in the interwar generations. The major reason for the stagnation in 
Danish women's partial life expectancy at age 50 was found to be smoking-related 
mortality in the interwar generations.

Health state utility values are a major source of uncertainty in economic 
evaluations of interventions for age-related macular degeneration (AMD). This 
review identifies and critiques published utility values and methods for 
eliciting de novo utility values in AMD. We describe how utility values have 
been used in healthcare decision making and provide guidance on the choice of 
utility values for future economic evaluations for AMD. Literature was searched 
using PubMed, and health technology assessments (HTA) were searched using HTA 
agency websites to identify articles reporting utility values or approaches to 
derive utility values in AMD and articles applying utilities for use in 
healthcare decision making relating to treatments for AMD. A total of 70 studies 
qualified for data extraction, 22 of which were classified as containing utility 
values and/or elicitation methods, and 48 were classified as using utility 
values in decision making. A large number of studies have elicited utility 
values for AMD, although those applied to decision making have focused on a few 
of these. There is an appreciation of the challenges in the measurement and 
valuation of health states, with recent studies addressing challenges such as 
the insensitivity of generic health-related quality of life (HRQoL) 
questionnaires and utility in the worse-seeing eye. We would encourage careful 
consideration when choosing utility values in decision making and an explicit 
critique of their applicability to the decision problem.

The Prostate Cancer Intervention Versus Observation Trial (PIVOT) concluded that 
radical prostatectomy (RP) offered no survival benefit compared with observation 
in men with clinically localized prostate cancer (PCa). We identified patients 
within the National Cancer Database (NCDB) for the period 2004-2012 who met the 
inclusion criteria of PIVOT (ie, histologically confirmed PCa, clinical stage 
T1-2NxM0, prostate-specific antigen <50 ng/ml, age <75 yr, estimated life 
expectancy >10 yr, and undergoing RP or observation as initial treatment within 
12 mo of diagnosis) to confirm the generalizability of the PIVOT results to the 
US population. Life expectancy was calculated using the US Social Security 
Administration life tables and was adjusted for comorbidities at diagnosis. 
Compared with PIVOT, men in the NCDB were younger (mean age 60.3 vs 67.0 yr) and 
healthier (Charlson-Deyo comorbidity index of 0: 93% vs 56%; both p < 0.001). 
Furthermore, 42% of men randomized to receive RP in PIVOT harbored D'Amico 
low-risk PCa, whereas 32% of men undergoing RP in the NCDB had low-risk disease. 
Our findings were confirmed in a sensitivity analysis including men regardless 
of life expectancy but satisfying all other inclusion criteria of PIVOT. Given 
that the NCDB represents nearly 70% of all incident cancers diagnosed in the 
United States, our data provide further evidence that PIVOT results may not be 
generalizable to contemporary clinical practice.
PATIENT SUMMARY: We observed that men diagnosed with clinically localized 
prostate cancer within the National Cancer Database (2004-2012) were younger, 
healthier, and more likely to have radical prostatectomy for higher risk disease 
than men in the Prostate Cancer Intervention Versus Observation Trial (PIVOT), 
raising questions about the applicability of PIVOT conclusions to the 
contemporary US population.

NSrp70 (nuclear speckle-related protein 70), a recently discovered protein and 
it belongs to the serine/arginine (SR) rich related protein family. NSrp70 is 
recognized as an important splicing factor comprising RNA recognition motif 
(RRM) and arginine/serine (RS)-like regions at the N- and C-terminus 
respectively, along with two coiled coil domains at each terminus. However, 
other functions of NSrp70 remain unelucidated. In this study, we investigated 
the role of NSrp70 in Xenopus embryogenesis and found that its maternal 
expression plays a critical role in embryonic development. Knockdown of NSrp70 
resulted in dramatic reduction in the length of developing tadpoles and mild to 
severe malformation in Xenopus embryos. In addition, knockdown of NSrp70 
resulted in an extremely short axis by blocking gastrulation and convergent 
extension. Further, animal cap assays along with activin A treatment revealed 
that NSrp70 is an essential factor for dorsal mesoderm induction as knockdown of 
NSrp70 caused a dramatic down-regulation of dorsal mesoderm specific genes and 
its loss significantly shortened the elongation region of animal caps. In 
conclusion, NSrp70 is crucial for early embryonic development, influencing 
gastrulation and mesoderm induction.

Globoid cell leukodystrophy (GLD), or Krabbe disease, is an autosomal recessive 
neurodegenerative disease caused by the deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme 
galactocerebrosidase (GALC). Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) 
provides modest benefit in presymptomatic patients but is well short of a cure. 
Gene transfer experiments using viral vectors have shown some success in 
extending the survival in the mouse model of GLD, twitcher mice. The present 
study compares three single-stranded (ss) AAV serotypes, two natural and one 
engineered (with oligodendrocyte tropism), and a self-complementary (sc) AAV 
vector, all packaged with a codon-optimized murine GALC gene. The vectors were 
delivered via a lumbar intrathecal route for global CNS distribution on PND10-11 
at a dose of 2 × 10(11) vector genomes (vg) per mouse. The results showed a 
similar significant extension of life span of the twitcher mice for all three 
serotypes (AAV9, AAVrh10, and AAV-Olig001) as well as the scAAV9 vector, 
compared to control cohorts. The rAAV gene transfer facilitated GALC 
biodistribution and detectable enzymatic activity throughout the CNS as well as 
in sciatic nerve and liver. When combined with BMT from syngeneic wild-type 
mice, there was significant improvement in survival for ssAAV9. 
Histopathological analysis of brain, spinal cord, and sciatic nerve showed 
significant improvement in preservation of myelin, with ssAAV9 providing the 
greatest benefit. In summary, we demonstrate that lumbar intrathecal delivery of 
rAAV/mGALCopt can significantly enhance the life span of twitcher mice treated 
at PND10-11 and that BMT synergizes with this treatment to improve the survival 
further. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

BACKGROUND: Patients with cancer often have an overly optimistic view of 
prognosis, as well as potential benefits of treatment. Patient-surgeon 
communication in the preoperative period has not received as much attention as 
communicating prognosis or bad news in the postoperative setting.
METHODS: The published literature on patient-physician communication in the 
preoperative setting among patients considering surgery for a malignant 
indication was reviewed. PubMed was queried for MESH terms including "surgery," 
"preoperative," "discussion," "treatment goals," "patient perceptions," and 
"cure." Information on how surgeons and patients may be empowered to improve 
communication about goals of care was also outlined.
RESULTS: Physicians tended not to dwell on prognosis in early discussions, 
instead emphasizing the uniqueness of individuals and the uncertainty of 
statistics. The treatment plan often became the dominant feature of the 
conversation and functioned to deflect attention from discussions of prognosis. 
Surgeons tended to understate possible complications and provided little detail 
regarding potential severity or long-term consequences. While most patients 
wished to be informed of their prognosis, only a subset actually received an 
estimate of life expectancy. Because optimism with respect to prognosis (often 
simplified as "hope") has been largely considered essential for positivity and 
optimism-even a false or inappropriate optimism-many providers have created, 
tolerated, or enabled it. Several studies have emphasized, however, that hope 
can be maintained with truthful discussion, even if the topic is a bad prognosis 
or eventual death.
CONCLUSIONS: Open, honest, and patient-driven discussions before surgery will 
lead to more robust shared decision making and create more engaged and satisfied 
patients (and caregivers). Enhanced preoperative discussion can also facilitate 
clarity about the possibility of cancer recurrence, cure, preferences about 
advance care planning, and formation of advance directives.

The current study reports on the manufacturing by rapid prototyping technique of 
three-dimensional (3D) scaffolds based on silicon substituted hydroxyapatite 
with Elastin-like Recombinamers (ELRs) functionalized surfaces. Silicon doped 
hydroxyapatite (Si-HA), with Ca10(PO4)5.7(SiO4)0.3(OH)1.7h0.3 nominal formula, 
was surface functionalized with two different types of polymers designed by 
genetic engineering: ELR-RGD that contain cell attachment specific sequences and 
ELR-SNA15/RGD with both hydroxyapatite and cells domains that interact with the 
inorganic phase and with the cells, respectively. These hybrid materials were 
subjected to in vitro assays in order to clarify if the ELRs coating improved 
the well-known biocompatible and bone regeneration properties of calcium 
phosphates materials. The in vitro tests showed that there was a total and 
homogeneous colonization of the 3D scaffolds by Bone marrow Mesenchymal Stromal 
Cells (BMSCs). In addition, the BMSCs were viable and able to proliferate and 
differentiate into osteoblasts.
STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Bone tissue engineering is an area of increasing 
interest because its main applications are directly related to the rising life 
expectancy of the population, which promotes higher rates of several bone 
pathologies, so innovative strategies are needed for bone tissue regeneration 
therapies. Here we use the rapid prototyping technology to allow moulding 
ceramic 3D scaffolds and we use different bio-polymers for the functionalization 
of their surfaces in order to enhance the biological response. Combining the 
ceramic material (silicon doped hydroxyapatite, Si-HA) and the Elastin like 
Recombinamers (ELRs) polymers with the presence of the integrin-mediate adhesion 
domain alone or in combination with SNA15 peptide that possess high affinity for 
hydroxyapatite, provided an improved Bone marrow Mesenchymal Stromal Cells 
(BMSCs) differentiation into osteoblastic linkage.

Important decisions related to human health, such as screening strategies for 
cancer, need to be made without a satisfactory understanding of the underlying 
biological and other processes. Rather, they are often informed by mathematical 
models that approximate reality. Often multiple models have been made to study 
the same phenomenon, which may lead to conflicting decisions. It is natural to 
seek a decision making process that identifies decisions that all models find to 
be effective, and we propose such a framework in this work. We apply the 
framework in prostate cancer screening to identify prostate-specific antigen 
(PSA)-based strategies that perform well under all considered models. We use 
heuristic search to identify strategies that trade off between optimizing the 
average across all models' assessments and being "conservative" by optimizing 
the most pessimistic model assessment. We identified three recently published 
mathematical models that can estimate quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE) of 
PSA-based screening strategies and identified 64 strategies that trade off 
between maximizing the average and the most pessimistic model assessments. All 
prescribe PSA thresholds that increase with age, and 57 involve biennial 
screening. Strategies with higher assessments with the pessimistic model start 
screening later, stop screening earlier, and use higher PSA thresholds at 
earlier ages. The 64 strategies outperform 22 previously published 
expert-generated strategies. The 41 most "conservative" ones remained better 
than no screening with all models in extensive sensitivity analyses. We augment 
current comparative modeling approaches by identifying strategies that perform 
well under all models, for various degrees of decision makers' conservativeness.

OBJECTIVE: To assess life expectancy and biopsy outcomes in men undergoing 
prostate biopsy at an academic medical center.
METHODS: We analyzed men who underwent prostate biopsy at our medical center 
between July 2012 and June 2014. Long-term other-cause mortality risk was 
determined using survival tables. Indications for biopsy and biopsy outcomes 
were assessed, and compared among men with varying mortality risks.
RESULTS: A total of 417 men underwent prostate biopsy, in whom 14-year 
other-cause mortality risk ranged from 9% to 74%. One hundred ninety-three men 
(46.3%) were considered low-mortality risk (<40% risk of 14-year mortality), 131 
(31.4%) intermediate risk (41%-55% 14-year mortality), and 93 (22.3%) high risk
