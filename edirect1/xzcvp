women) and Panama City (7·3 years [2·6-12·1] for men and 9·0 years [2·4-15·5] 
for women). We saw an increase in life expectancy at birth from east to west in 
Panama City and from north to south in core Mexico City, and a core-periphery 
divide in Buenos Aires and Santiago. Whereas for San José the central part of 
the city had the lowest life expectancy and in Belo Horizonte the central part 
of the city had the highest life expectancy.
INTERPRETATION: Large spatial differences in life expectancy in Latin American 
cities and their association with social factors highlight the importance of 
area-based approaches and policies that address social inequalities in improving 
health in cities of the region.

OBJECTIVE: Developing a model to analyse the cost-effectiveness of interventions 
preventing late-onset infection (LOI) in preterm infants and applying it to the 
evaluation of anti-microbial impregnated peripherally inserted central catheters 
(AM-PICCs) compared with standard PICCs (S-PICCs).
DESIGN: Model-based cost-effectiveness analysis, using data from the Preventing 
infection using Antimicrobial Impregnated Long Lines (PREVAIL) randomised 
controlled trial linked to routine healthcare data, supplemented with published 
literature. The model assumes that LOI increases the risk of neurodevelopmental 
impairment (NDI).
SETTING: Neonatal intensive care units in the UK National Health Service (NHS).
PATIENTS: Infants born ≤32 weeks gestational age, requiring a 1 French gauge 
PICC.
INTERVENTIONS: AM-PICC and S-PICC.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Life expectancy, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and 
healthcare costs over the infants' expected lifetime.
RESULTS: Severe NDI reduces life expectancy by 14.79 (95% CI 4.43 to 26.68; 
undiscounted) years, 10.63 (95% CI 7.74 to 14.02; discounted) QALYs and costs 
£19 057 (95% CI £14 197; £24697; discounted) to the NHS. If LOI causes NDI, the 
maximum acquisition price of an intervention reducing LOI risk by 5% is £120. 
AM-PICCs increase costs (£54.85 (95% CI £25.95 to £89.12)) but have negligible 
impact on health outcomes (-0.01 (95% CI -0.09 to 0.04) QALYs), compared with 
S-PICCs. The NHS can invest up to £2.4 million in research to confirm that 
AM-PICCs are not cost-effective.
CONCLUSIONS: The model quantifies health losses and additional healthcare costs 
caused by NDI and LOI during neonatal care. Given these consequences, 
interventions preventing LOI, even by a small extent, can be cost-effective. 
AM-PICCs, being less effective and more costly than S-PICC, are not likely to be 
cost-effective.

BACKGROUND: Evidence pointing to a synergistic effect of stereotactic 
radiosurgery (SRS) with concurrent immunotherapy or targeted therapy in patients 
with melanoma brain metastases (BM) is increasing. We aimed to analyze the 
effect on overall survival (OS) of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) or 
BRAF/MEK inhibitors initiated during the 9 weeks before or after SRS. We also 
evaluated the prognostic value of patients' and disease characteristics as 
predictors of OS in patients treated with SRS.
METHODS: We identified patients with BM from cutaneous or unknown primary origin 
melanoma treated with SRS between 2011 and 2018.
RESULTS: We included 84 patients. The median OS was 12 months (95% CI 
9-20 months). The median follow-up was 30 months (95% CI 28-49). Twenty-eight 
patients with newly diagnosed BM initiated anti-PD-1 +/-CTLA-4 therapy (n = 18), 
ipilimumab monotherapy (n = 10) or BRAF+/- MEK inhibitors (n = 11), during the 
9 weeks before or after SRS. Patients who received anti-PD-1 +/-CTLA-4 mAb 
showed an improved survival in comparison to ipilimumab monotherapy (OS 24 vs. 
7.5 months; HR 0.32, 95% 0.12-0.83, p = 0.02) and BRAF +/-MEK inhibitors (OS 24 
vs. 7 months, respectively; HR 0.11, 95% 0.04-0.34, p = 0.0001). This benefit 
remained significant when compared to the subgroup of patients treated with dual 
BRAF/MEK inhibition (BMi) (n = 5). In a multivariate Cox regression analysis an 
age > 65, synchronous BM, > 2 metastatic sites, > 4 BM, and an ECOG > 1 were 
correlated with poorer prognosis. A treatment with anti-PD-1+/-CTLA-4 mAbs 
within 9 weeks of SRS was associated with better outcomes. The presence of serum 
lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels ≥ 2xULN at BM diagnosis was associated with 
lower OS (HR 1.60, 95% CI 1.03-2.50; p = 0.04).
CONCLUSIONS: The concurrent administration of anti-PD-1+/-CTLA-4 mAbs with SRS 
was associated with improved survival in melanoma patients with newly diagnosed 
BM. In addition to CNS tumor burden, the extension of systemic disease retains 
its prognostic value in patients treated with SRS. Elevated serum LDH levels are 
predictors of poor outcome in these patients.

BACKGROUND: Asthma diagnosis in the community is often made without objective 
testing.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of 
implementing a stepwise objective diagnostic verification algorithm among 
patients with community-diagnosed asthma in the United States.
METHODS: We developed a probabilistic time-in-state cohort model that compared a 
stepwise asthma verification algorithm on the basis of spirometry testing and a 
methacholine challenge test against the current standard of care over 20 years. 
Model input parameters were informed from the literature and with original data 
analyses when required. The target population was US adults (≥15 years old) with 
physician-diagnosed asthma. The final outcomes were costs (in 2018 dollars) and 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), discounted at 3% annually. Deterministic 
and probabilistic analyses were undertaken to examine the effect of alternative 
assumptions and uncertainty in model parameters on the results.
RESULTS: In a simulated cohort of 10,000 adults with diagnosed asthma, the 
stepwise algorithm resulted in removal of the diagnosis of 3,366. This was 
projected to be associated with savings of $36.26 million in direct costs and a 
gain of 4,049.28 QALYs over 20 years. Extrapolating these results to the US 
population indicated an undiscounted potential savings of $56.48 billion over 20 
years. The results were robust against alternative assumptions and plausible 
changes in values of input parameters.
CONCLUSION: Implementation of a simple diagnostic testing algorithm to verify 
asthma diagnosis might result in substantial savings and improvement in 
patients' quality of life.

Emerging tropical viruses have caused serious outbreaks during the recent years, 
such as Ebola virus (EBOV) in 2014 and the most recent in 2018 to 2019 in Congo. 
Thus, immediate diagnostic attention is demanded at the point of care in 
resource-limited settings, because the performance and the operational 
parameters of conventional EBOV testing are limited. Especially, their 
sensitivity, specificity, and coverage of other tropical disease viruses make 
them unsuitable for diagnostic at the point of care. Here, a padlock probe 
(PLP)-based rolling circle amplification (RCA) method for the detection of EBOV 
is presented. For this, a set of PLPs, separately targeting the viral RNA and 
complementary RNA of all seven EBOV genes, was used in the RCA assay and 
validated on virus isolates from cell culture. The assay was then translated for 
testing clinical samples, and simultaneous detection of both EBOV RNA types was 
demonstrated. For increased sensitivity, the RCA products were enriched on a 
simple and pump-free microfluidic chip. Because PLPs and RCA are inherently 
multiplexable, we demonstrate the extension of the probe panel for the 
simultaneous detection of the tropical viruses Ebola, Zika, and Dengue. The 
demonstrated high specificity, sensitivity, and multiplexing capability in 
combination with the digital quantification rendered the assay a promising 
diagnostic tool toward tropical virus detection at the point of care.

BACKGROUND: Cardiac ganglia are rechargeable batteries of the heart. The 
essential role of cardiac ganglia on cardiac life expectancy has not been 
examined following brain death. The aim of this study was to determine cardiac 
ganglia numbers and neuron density following subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH).
METHODS: Twenty-five hybrid rabbits were grouped as control (n = 5), sham (n = 
5), and SAH (n = 15). The SAH groups' animals were subjected to injections of 
lethal dose of 2.00 cc autologous blood into their cisterna magna until linear 
EEG was obtained. The hearts of all animals were extracted following 
intracardiac formalin injection and examined. Cardiac ganglia and 
normal/degenerated neuron densities of cardiac neurons were recorded.
RESULTS: The mean volume of normal neuron density of ganglia was 6.980 ± 
830/mm3, and the degenerated neuron density of ganglia was 3 ± 1/mm3 in the 
control group, 6134 ± 712/mm3; 23 ± 9/mm3 in the sham group, 3456 ± 589; 1161 ± 
72/mm3 in the surviving group; and 1734 ± 341/mm3, 4259 ± 865/mm3 in the dead 
animals in the SAH group. The algebraic results of heart work capacity (Wh) were 
estimated as 1375 ± 210 Wh in the control group, 1036 ± 225 in the sham group, 
800 ± 110 Wh in the surviving group, and < 100 ± 20 in the dead animals in the 
SAH group. Degenerated cardiac neuron density/Wh correlation is statistically 
meaningful between the dead in the SAH group versus the SAH-surviving, sham, and 
control groups (P < .0005).
CONCLUSIONS: Normal cardiac ganglia numbers and/or cardiac ganglia neuron 
density may be related to cardiac survival following brain death after 
subarachnoid hemorrhage.

BACKGROUND: Massive irreparable posterosuperior rotator cuff tears may result in 
a loss of external rotation. Most of these patients lose their ability to 
perform activities of daily living (ADLs), especially where external rotation 
and abduction are needed. Latissimus dorsi tendon transfer (LDTT) is a method to 
restore abduction and external rotation in patients with posterosuperior rotator 
cuff tears. There are no objective data concerning whether LDTT can restore 
range of motion (ROM), especially in performing ADLs and if proprioception 
changes after LDTT.
METHODS: We examined 12 patients 4.2 years (1-9 years) after LDTT with 
simultaneous 3D motion analysis; the opposite, nonaffected side was assessed as 
control. The measurement protocol included maximum values in flexion/extension, 
abduction/adduction, internal/external rotation in 0° and in 90° flexion and in 
90° abduction. To evaluate competences, we measured seven activities of daily 
life and examined the proprioceptive ability using an active angle reproduction 
test.
RESULTS: In total, 4.2 years (1-9 years) after LDTT there was no significant 
difference in flexion/extension and abduction/adduction compared to the healthy 
side. Maximum external rotation was significantly reduced compared to the 
opposite side. Eleven patients (85%) were able to perform all ADL. 
Proprioceptive ability did not differ from the healthy side.
CONCLUSION: LDTT cannot fully restore a patient's ability for external rotation 
after a posterosuperior rotator cuff tear. However, 4.2 years after surgery, 85% 
of the patients are able to perform all ADLs. Proprioceptive ability is not 
affected by the transfer.

Ideally, policies aiming to tackle zoonotic diseases in animals and reduce the 
burden of disease in humans should be based on an assessment of the cost and 
benefits of alternative interventions. However, while the cost of actions 
targeting diseases in animals and humans and the benefits in terms of increased 
livestock production can be monetized, it is a challenge to monetize 
improvements in the quality of life or to life expectancy extensions in humans 
in zoonotic policy evaluations. This paper proposes a method to monetize the 
human health benefits derived from zoonotic disease reduction and applies it to 
cysticercosis in Burkina Faso, Egypt, Ethiopia, Kenya, Nigeria and Uganda. We 
propose a three-step approach to estimate the human health component of the 
monetary impact of zoonoses. First, we proxy society's willingness to pay to 
avoid a disability adjusted life year (DALY) using the annualized value of 
statistical life (VSL) estimated by of the United States Department of Health 
and Human Services. Second, we implement a benefit transfer methodology to 
transfer the US value into the context of the sampled countries, accounting for 
differences in income levels. Finally, we use the 2016 Global Burden of Disease 
(GBD, 2018) data on cysticercosis to estimate its monetary impact on human 
health. All results are estimated in current international dollars using 
purchasing power parity (USD PPP) exchange rates. In the sampled countries, 
willingness to pay to avoid a DALY is estimated between USD PPP 2 000 and USD 
PPP 12 700. In most cases, these estimates fall within the range of 1 and 3 
times the GDP per capita. The estimated monetary value of the DALYs due to human 
infections of cysticercosis per 100 000 people ranges between USD PPP 18 000 and 
USD PPP 98 000 per year. The proposed methodology might represent a first step 
towards providing a consistent and unbiased measure of the benefits of 
interventions targeting prevention, detection and control of zoonotic diseases.

Reduced mobility and physical independence of elders has emerged as a major 
clinical and public health priority with extended life expectancy. The impact of 
the neuromuscular function on muscle activity and properties has emerged as a 
critical factor influencing the progress and outcome of muscle changes with 
aging. However, very little is known about the neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) in 
humans, in part due to technical constraints limiting the access to healthy, 
fresh neuromuscular tissue. Here, we describe a method, called Biopsy using 
Electrostimulation for Enhanced NMJ Sampling (BeeNMJs) that improves the outcome 
of muscle biopsies. We used local cutaneous stimulation to identify the area 
enriched with NMJs for each participant at the right Vastus lateralis (VL). The 
needle biopsy was then performed in proximity of that point. The BeeNMJs 
procedure was safe for the participants. We observed NMJs in 53.3% of biopsies 
in comparison with only 16.7% using the traditional method. Furthermore, we 
observed an average of 30.13 NMJs per sample compared to only 2.33 for the 
traditional method. Importantly, high-quality neuromuscular material was 
obtained whereby pre-, postsynaptic, and glial elements were routinely labeled, 
simultaneously with myosin heavy chain type I. The BeeNMJs approach will 
facilitate studies of NMJs, particularly in human disease or aging process.

Oral VRL offers easier administration, better quality of life, and cost saving. 
This study aimed to evaluate the treatment efficacy in terms of tumor response 
of the two formulations of vinorelbine (VRL, oral and IV) in combination with 
epirubicin (EPI); and the effect of EPI co-administration on VRL 
pharmacokinetics (PK) in Chinese patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC) 
using a phase 2, open label, randomized trial. Patients were aged 18-70 years, 
had histologically confirmed MBC, Karnofsky Performance Status ≥ 70%, and life 
expectancy ≥ 12 weeks. The treatment consisted of 6 cycles of 3 weeks each. VRL 
dose was: (Oral-VRL) 60 mg/m2 for cycle 1, 80 mg/m2 for cycles 2-6, and (IV-VRL) 
25 mg/m2 for cycle 1 and 30 mg/m2 for cycles 2-6. EPI dose of 75 mg/m2 was given 
on day 1 in both arms for all cycles. 133 patients were enrolled: 66 in Oral-VRL 
and 67 in IV-VRL arms. The median age for Oral-VRL and IV-VRL arms was 48.4 and 
50.0 years, respectively. Objective response rates were 50.0% (95% CI 
37.4-62.6%) for Oral-VRL and 53.7% (95% CI 41.1-66.0%) for IV-VRL. Both 
treatment arms met the efficacy objective target of at least 31 responses, 
demonstrating efficacy as first-line treatment for MBC. Similar blood PK 
profiles, exposures, and VRL clearance were observed between VRL + EPI vs 
VRL-only modalities for both arms. Oral VRL is comparable to IV VRL and an 
effective first-line treatment for Chinese patients with MBC. The activity of 
VRL + EPI combination is unaltered when VRL is given orally at recommended 
doses.

OBJECTIVES: The cost-effectiveness of available pharmacological treatments for 
narcolepsy is largely unknown. Available pharmacological treatments are 
associated with tolerability, abuse, and adherence issues. Pitolisant is the 
first inverse agonist of the histamine H3 receptor to be prescribed for the 
treatment of narcolepsy with and without cataplexy. Studies suggest that 
pitolisant is both as effective as previously introduced drugs and is associated 
with fewer adverse effects. The objective in this study was to estimate the 
cost-effectiveness of pitolisant as monotherapy, and pitolisant as an adjunctive 
treatment to modafinil, compared with standard treatment.
MATERIALS & METHODS: Calculations were performed using a Markov model with a 
50-year time horizon. Healthcare utilization and quality-adjusted life years 
(QALYs) for each treatment alternative were calculated assuming no treatment 
effect on survival. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed for 
treatment effectiveness and healthcare cost parameters.
RESULTS: The cost per additional quality-adjusted life year was estimated at SEK 
356 337 (10 SEK ≈ 1 Euro) for pitolisant monotherapy, and at SEK 491 128 for 
pitolisant as an adjunctive treatment, as compared to standard treatment. The 
cost-effectiveness measure was demonstrated to be particularly sensitive to the 
assumptions made concerning indirect effects on total healthcare utilization and 
the pitolisant treatment cost.
CONCLUSIONS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were below the unofficial 
willingness-to-pay threshold at SEK 500 000. The estimated costs per additional 
QALY obtained here are likely to overestimate the true cost-effectiveness ratio 
since significant potential indirect effects-pertaining both to labor-market and 
household-related productivity-of treatment are not taken into account.

Objective: To analyze and compare the disease burden of falls in Chinese 
population aged 0-19, in 1990 and 2017. Methods: Indicators including number of 
deaths, mortality rates, years of life lost due to premature mortality (YLL), 
years lived with disability (YLD) and disability-adjusted of life years (DALY), 
on falls, were gathered from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2017 and used to 
describe the disease burden and corresponding parameters on falls, between 1990 
and 2017, in China. Results: In 2017, number of death, YLLs, YLDs, DALYs caused 
by falls were 5 321, 0.43 million person years, 0.14 million person years and 
0.57 million person years respectively, among aged 0-19 group. Rates on 
standardized mortality, YLLs, YLDs and DALYs on falls were 1.76/100 000, 
141.49/100 000, 46.99/100 000, and 188.48/100 000, respectively. The burden of 
falls decreased with the increase of age. Compared with 1990, disease burden of 
falls decreased in all age groups, both in male and female, with more seen in 
the lower age groups. Compared with 1990, the number of deaths, rates on YLLs, 
YLDs and DALYs caused by falls decreased by 65.08%, 46.63%, 47.38% and 36.33% 
respectively, in 2017. However, the YLDs rate increased by 73.31% between 1990 
and 2017. The ratio of YLLs to DALYs decreased from 90.84% in 1990 to 75.07% in 
2017, with a proportion as 17.36%. Conclusion: Compared with 1990, although the 
disease burden of falls among aged 0-19 group showed a decreasing trend, falls 
still caused serious disease burden for the aged 0-19 group. Research that 
targeting prevention on falls, should be continued.

Publisher: 目的： 分析和比较1990年和2017年中国0~19岁人群跌倒疾病负担，为制定该人群的跌倒预防控制策略措施提供依据。 方法： 
利用全球疾病负担2017研究结果，选取因跌倒死亡数、死亡率、过早死亡损失寿命年（YLL）、YLL率、伤残损失寿命年（YLD）、YLD率、伤残调整寿命年（DALY）和DALY率等指标，对中国0~19岁人群跌倒疾病负担进行描述，通过比较1990年和2017年相应指标的变化，描述疾病负担变化情况。

The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between political 
ideology and attitudes toward life extension among college students (N = 484). 
Older age and male gender were associated with more positive attitudes toward 
life extension, while religious commitment was not. Authoritarian 
aggression/submission and social dominance orientation were associated with more 
positive attitudes toward life extension. The results suggest older people, men, 
and individuals higher in authoritarian traits and social dominance orientation 
may be more likely to use life-extending biomedical technology.

Managing elderly breast cancer patients brings challenges both to physicians and 
patients themselves. There are certain controversial issues regarding local 
treatment of early breast cancer in this population. Since elderly patients are 
more likely to have comorbidities and functional limitations, they are more 
prone to undertreatment. Although surgical treatment in elderly patients were 
reported to be safe, severity and number of comorbidities are shown to be 
related with increased complications, hence may lead to higher mortality and 
lower life quality. Therefore, frailty is one of the concerns which prevents 
elderly patients to receive standard-of-care local treatment. Nevertheless, 
breast cancers developing in elderly are more likely to be low grade and luminal 
type. Until now, primary endocrine treatment without surgical resection, 
omitting whole breast irradiation after partial mastectomy and avoiding sentinel 
lymph node biopsy, which are otherwise accepted as standard-of-care, were 
questionned in healthy, low-risk, elderly fit patients. Two main issues were 
suggested to be considered when assessing the impact of local treatment options 
in this patient group; the clinical significance of treatments' effects, and the 
patients' expectations. Due to their vulnerability, baseline geriatric 
assessment should be the initial step for management in elderly breast cancer 
patients. Even in those who are healthy and fit with long life-expectancy, 
de-escalation in management might be an option in low-risk patients after 
considering patients' individual expectations and limited clinical benefits of 
standard local treatment options.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the normal range of motion of the canine 
tibiofemoral joint and the movement of the tibia relative to the femur, 
especially the internal/external rotation under flexion. Right stifle joints 
were harvested from eight skeletally mature Beagle dogs, which were euthanized 
for reasons unrelated to this study. All muscle tissue was removed from the 
limbs prior to testing. Flexion and extension tests were conducted using a 
robotic manipulator with six degrees-of-freedom. Cranial/caudal and 
medial/lateral displacement and varus/valgus and internal/external rotation were 
measured at various degrees of flexion. We observed that the tibia rotated 
internally at an increasing flexion angle with mean peak internal and external 
rotations of 20.0 ± 13.8° and 4.5 ± 3.6°, respectively. The tibia also tended to 
displace cranially at an increasing flexion angle, with a mean peak cranial 
displacement of 8.9 ± 4.4 mm; there was minimal medial displacement when 
increasing the flexion angle. Valgus rotation also tended to occur at an 
increasing flexion angle. During the flexion of the canine stifle joint, 
approximately 20° of internal tibial rotation occurred around the longitudinal 
axis, along with a rollback motion involving the cranial displacement of the 
tibia.

In the vertebrate body, a metameric structure is present along the 
anterior-posterior axis. Zebrafish tbx6-/- larvae, in which somite boundaries do 
not form during embryogenesis, were shown to exhibit abnormal skeletal 
morphology such as rib, neural arch and hemal arch. In this study, we 
investigated the role of somite patterning in the formation of anterior 
vertebrae and ribs in more detail. Using three-dimensional computed tomography 
scans, we found that anterior vertebrae including the Weberian apparatus were 
severely affected in tbx6-/- larvae. In addition, pleural ribs of tbx6 mutants 
exhibited severe defects in the initial ossification, extension of ossification, 
and formation of parapophyses. Two-colour staining revealed that bifurcation of 
ribs was caused by fusion or branching of ribs in tbx6-/- . The parapophyses in 
tbx6-/- juvenile fish showed irregular positioning to centra and abnormal 
attachment to ribs. Furthermore, we found that the ossification of the distal 
portion of ribs proceeded along myotome boundaries even in irregularly 
positioned myotome boundaries. These results provide evidence of the 
contribution of somite patterning to the formation of the Weberian apparatus and 
rib in zebrafish.

The life expectancy gap experienced by people living with severe mental illness 
is primarily a result of cardiometabolic disease that is often exacerbated by 
side effects of antipsychotic medication. Commencement of atypical antipsychotic 
medication is commonly associated with weight gain. The Keeping the Body in Mind 
programme has demonstrated that early intervention with lifestyle activities can 
attenuate this weight gain and potentially improve long-term health outcomes. 
The aim of this study was to explore the experiences of young people who 
participated in the Keeping the Body in Mind programme, a targeted lifestyle 
intervention programme. A qualitative approach was used employing a 
semi-structured interview format. The interview schedule included questions 
related to four topics: aspects of the programmes that were useful, attributes 
of staff members that influenced the programme, changes in attitudes towards 
their own physical health, and suggestions for programme improvements. 
Interviews were recorded with duration ranging from 40 to 65 min. Thematic 
analysis was used to detect and assemble codes. These were then synthesized and 
classified into themes. Eleven participants were interviewed (seven males), aged 
between 18 and 25 years. Thematic analysis revealed four main themes: the role 
of physical health in mental health recovery; the importance of staff 
interactions; the value of peer interaction; and graduation to a sustainable 
healthy lifestyle. Study participants reported that they valued the programme 
for both their physical health and mental health recovery.

BACKGROUND: Metastatic prostate cancer is incurable, but systemic therapies can 
improve quality of life and prolong survival. Accurate perceptions of treatment 
risks and benefits are vital as patients with metastatic disease make treatment 
decisions. We assessed treatment-related expectations for benefit among patients 
with metastatic prostate cancer and explored associated sociodemographic 
characteristics.
METHODS: Men with metastatic prostate cancer (N = 100) completed surveys 
assessing their treatment-related expectations for cancer cure, symptom relief, 
and prolonged life expectancy. Frequencies were used to describe the proportions 
of reported expectations. Fisher's exact tests were used to assess the 
associations of sociodemographic characteristics with treatment expectations.
RESULTS: One third (33%) of participants believed treatment was at least a 
little likely to cure their metastatic cancer. Most participants believed 
treatment could provide symptom relief (76%) and extend life expectancy (95%). 
Among participants reporting that cancer cure was at least a little likely vs 
not at all, more men identified as non-white (24% vs 5%; P = .01), self-reported 
good health (90% vs 58%; P < .01), and had greater optimism (78% vs 47%; 
P < .01). Among participants reporting that symptom relief was at least a little 
likely vs not at all, more men were less than 70 years old (62% vs 0%; P = .01).
CONCLUSION: A large proportion of patients with metastatic prostate cancer 
reported beliefs inconsistent with understanding that treatment was not 
curative. Race, better self-reported health, and greater optimism were related 
to unrealistic expectations. Efforts to ensure alignment of patient and 
clinician expectations may facilitate more effective shared decision-making for 
treating metastatic disease.

Studies on the natural factors contributing to pest regulation are fundamental 
to developing efficient integrated pest management programs. Chemical control is 
the main management method used for pests [e.g., Aphis gossypii (Glover)]. The 
studies of pest management with chemical control provide information that can be 
incorporated into integrated pest management programs to promote more 
sustainable pest control approaches. Here, we report the critical stages of A. 
gossypii and its abiotic and biotic natural mortality factors in cotton crops as 
a function of plant phenology using a life table. The critical stages of A. 
gossypii were the first and fourth instars. Together, the abiotic and biotic 
factors caused 94.31% of the mortality in the A. gossypii populations in cotton 
crops with plants in the vegetative, flowering, and fruiting stages. The key 
mortality factors were rainfall and predation. Syrphidae Allograpta exotica 
(Wiedemann) (Diptera: Syrphidae) and Chrysopidae Chrysoperla externa (Hagen) 
(Neuroptera: Chrysopidae) larvae, many Coccinellidae species Cycloneda sanguinea 
(L.) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae), Eriopsis connexa (Germar) (Coleoptera: 
Coccinellidae), Harmonia axyridis (Pallas) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae), 
Hippodamia convergens (Guérin-Meneville) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae), Scymnus 
rubicundus (Erichson) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) and Stethorus punctillum 
(Weise) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae), one Anthocoridae species Orius insidiosus 
(Say) (Hemiptera: Anthocoridae), and individuals from the Araneidae family were 
responsible for the predation of A. gossypii. The results obtained in this study 
provide support for the idea that efforts to preserve natural enemies (e.g., 
predators) and rainfall monitoring should be adapted due to their importance for 
the regulation of A. gossypii populations in all the phenological stages of 
cotton in tropical regions.

Aging of the population results in an increase of the incidence of cancer and 
bone metastases. The proximal femur is one of the most frequent locations of 
bone metastases. A pathological fracture has a major impact on the quality of 
life and potentially on survival. In case of impending fracture, prophylactic 
fixation is therefore strongly recommended. The management of metastases of the
