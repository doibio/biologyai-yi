therapy, and in the last few years, a number of exciting developments have 
brought this approach closer to the clinic than ever before. In this review, we 
discuss in detail the most advanced of these developments, a recombinant 
adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector carrying a low-density lipoprotein receptor 
(LDLR) transgene which has recently entered phase 1/2a testing. We also review 
ongoing development of approaches to enhance transgene expression, improve the 
efficiency of hepatocyte transduction, and minimize the AAV capsid-specific 
adaptive immune response. We include a summary of key gene therapy approaches 
for HoFH in pre-clinical development, including RNA silencing of t﻿he gene 
encoding HMG-CoA reductase (HMGCR) and induced pluripotent stem cell transplant 
therapy.

OBJECTIVE: There has been significant concern that austerity measures have 
negatively impacted health in the UK. We examined whether budgetary reductions 
in Pension Credit and social care have been associated with recent rises in 
mortality rates among pensioners aged 85 years and over.
DESIGN: Cross-local authority longitudinal study.
SETTING: Three hundred and twenty-four lower tier local authorities in England.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Annual percentage changes in mortality rates among 
pensioners aged 85 years or over.
RESULTS: Between 2007 and 2013, each 1% decline in Pension Credit spending 
(support for low income pensioners) per beneficiary was associated with an 
increase in 0.68% in old-age mortality (95% CI: 0.41 to 0.95). Each reduction in 
the number of beneficiaries per 1000 pensioners was associated with an increase 
in 0.20% (95% CI: 0.15 to 0.24). Each 1% decline in social care spending was 
associated with a significant rise in old-age mortality (0.08%, 95% CI: 
0.0006-0.12) but not after adjusting for Pension Credit spending. Similar 
patterns were seen in both men and women. Weaker associations observed for those 
aged 75 to 84 years, and none among those 65 to 74 years. Categories of service 
expenditure not expected to affect old-age mortality, such as transportation, 
showed no association.
CONCLUSIONS: Rising mortality rates among pensioners aged 85 years and over were 
linked to reductions in spending on income support for poor pensioners and 
social care. Findings suggest austerity measures in England have affected 
vulnerable old-age adults.

Mold spoilage of bread and its biopreservation: A review of current strategies 
for bread shelf life extension.

Microbial spoilage of bread and the consequent waste problem causes large 
economic losses for both the bakery industry and the consumer. Furthermore the 
presence of mycotoxins due to fungal contamination in cereals and cereal 
products remains a significant issue. The use of conventional chemical 
preservatives has several drawbacks, necessitating the development of 
clean-label alternatives. In this review, we describe current research aiming to 
extend the shelf life of bread through the use of more consumer friendly and 
ecologically sustainable preservation techniques as alternatives to chemical 
additives. Studies on the in situ-production/-expression of antifungal compounds 
are presented, with special attention given to recent developments over the past 
decade. Sourdough fermented with antifungal strains of lactic acid bacteria 
(LAB) is an area of increasing focus and serves as a high-potential biological 
ingredient to produce gluten-containing and gluten-free breads with improved 
nutritional value, quality and safety due to shelf-life extension, and is 
in-line with consumer's demands for more products containing less additives. 
Other alternative biopreservation techniques include the utilization of 
antifungal peptides, ethanol and plant extracts. These can be added to bread 
formulations or incorporated in antimicrobial films for active packaging (AP) of 
bread. This review outlines recent progress that has been made in the area of 
bread biopreservation and future perspectives in this important area.

BACKGROUND: The population of the Pacific Melanesian country of Vanuatu was 
234,000 at the 2009 census. Apart from subsistence activities, economic activity 
includes tourism and agriculture. Current completeness of vital registration is 
considered too low to be usable for national statistics; mortality and life 
expectancy (LE) are derived from indirect demographic estimates from 
censuses/surveys. Some cause of death (CoD) data are available to provide 
information on major causes of premature death.
METHODS: Deaths 2001-2007 were coded for cause (ICDv10) for ages 0-59 years 
from: hospital separations (HS) (n = 636), hospital medical certificates (MC) of 
death (n = 1,169), and monthly reports from community health facilities (CHF) 
(n = 1,212). Ill-defined causes were 3 % for hospital deaths and 20 % from CHF. 
Proportional mortality was calculated by cause (excluding ill-defined) and age 
group (0-4, 5-14 years), and also by sex for 15-59 years. From total deaths by 
broad age group and sex from 1999 and 2009 census analyses, community deaths 
were estimated by deduction of hospital deaths MC. National proportional 
mortality by cause was estimated by a weighted average of MC and CHF deaths.
RESULTS: National estimates indicate main causes of deaths <5 years were: 
perinatal disorders (45 %) and malaria, diarrhea, and pneumonia (27 %). For 
15-59 years, main causes of male deaths were: circulatory disease 27 %, 
neoplasms 13 %, injury 13 %, liver disease 10 %, infection 10 %, diabetes 7 %, 
and chronic respiratory disease 7 %; and for females: neoplasms 29 %, 
circulatory disease 15 %, diabetes 10 %, infection 9 %, and maternal deaths 8 %. 
Infection included tuberculosis, malaria, and viral hepatitis. Liver disease 
(including hepatitis and cancer) accounted for 18 % of deaths in adult males and 
9 % in females. Non-communicable disease (NCD), including circulatory disease, 
diabetes, neoplasm, and chronic respiratory disease, accounted for 52 % of 
premature deaths in adult males and 60 % in females. Injuries accounted for 13 % 
in adult males and 6 % in females. Maternal deaths translate into an annual 
maternal mortality ratio of 130/100,000 for the period.
CONCLUSION: Vanuatu manifests a double burden of disease with significant 
proportional mortality from perinatal disorders and infection/pneumonia <5 years 
and maternal mortality, coupled with significant proportional mortality in 
adults (15-59 years) from cardiovascular disease (CVD), neoplasms, and diabetes.

Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in the United States. In 
2010, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that $444 billion 
was spent on cardiovascular diseases alone, about $1 of every $6 spent on health 
care. As life expectancy continues to increase, this annual cost will also 
increase, making cost-effective primary prevention of cardiovascular disease 
highly desirable. Because of its role in development of atherosclerosis and 
clinical events, dyslipidemia management is a high priority in cardiovascular 
prevention. Multiple major dyslipidemia guidelines have been published around 
the world recently, four of them by independent organizations in the United 
States alone. They share the goal of providing clinical guidance on optimal 
dyslipidemia management, but guidelines differ in their emphasis on 
pharmacotherapy, stratification of groups, emphasis on lifestyle modification, 
and use of a fixed target or percentage reduction in low density lipoprotein 
cholesterol. This review summarizes eight major guidelines for dyslipidemia 
management and considers the basis for their recommendations. Our primary aim is 
to enhance understanding of dyslipidemia management guidelines in patient care 
for primary prevention of future cardiovascular risk.

BACKGROUND: Recent increases in life expectancy may greatly expand future 
Alzheimer's Disease (AD) burdens. China's demographic profile, aging workforce 
and predicted increasing burden of AD-related care make its economy vulnerable 
to AD impacts. Previous economic estimates of AD predominantly focus on health 
system burdens and omit wider whole-economy effects, potentially underestimating 
the full economic benefit of effective treatment.
METHODS: AD-related prevalence, morbidity and mortality for 2011-2050 were 
simulated and were, together with associated caregiver time and costs, imposed 
on a dynamic Computable General Equilibrium model of the Chinese economy. Both 
economic and non-economic outcomes were analyzed.
FINDINGS: Simulated Chinese AD prevalence quadrupled during 2011-50 from 6-28 
million. The cumulative discounted value of eliminating AD equates to China's 
2012 GDP (US$8 trillion), and the annual predicted real value approaches US AD 
cost-of-illness (COI) estimates, exceeding US$1 trillion by 2050 (2011-prices). 
Lost labor contributes 62% of macroeconomic impacts. Only 10% derives from 
informal care, challenging previous COI-estimates of 56%.
INTERPRETATION: Health and macroeconomic models predict an unfolding 2011-2050 
Chinese AD epidemic with serious macroeconomic consequences. Significant 
investment in research and development (medical and non-medical) is warranted 
and international researchers and national authorities should therefore target 
development of effective AD treatment and prevention strategies.

Longitudinal associations between perceived age discrimination and subjective 
well-being: variations by age and subjective life expectancy.

OBJECTIVES: Perceived age discrimination can have negative effects on one's 
subjective well-being (SWB). The response to age discrimination might differ 
based on age, and based on perceived longevity, or subjective life expectancy 
(SLE). These differential effects have not yet been prospectively examined 
within adult life span samples.
METHOD: We examined the association between perceived age discrimination at 
baseline (T1) and SWB at follow-up (T2), and the moderation effect of SLE. We 
compared differences in these effects between middle-aged and older adults. 
Analyses were based on participants who took part in the 2008 (T1) and 2011 (T2) 
assessments of the German Ageing Survey (DEAS; listwise N = 1534), a 
population-based representative sample of the German adult population. 
Participants were categorized as middle-aged (ages 40-64; n = 919) or older 
adults (ages 65-93; n = 615).
RESULTS: Regression analyses indicated that T1 perceived age discrimination 
significantly predicts lower T2 SWB among middle-aged, but not among older 
adults, after adjusting for covariates and T1 SWB. There is a significant 
interaction between age discrimination and SLE for predicting SWB, only among 
middle-aged participants, suggesting that age discrimination predicts decreases 
in SWB for those reporting higher, but not lower levels of SLE.
CONCLUSION: People in the transition from midlife to old age, who hold higher 
SLE, appear to be more vulnerable to age discrimination. This may be due to the 
experience of age discrimination as an 'off-time', or unexpected event for those 
in midlife who have a higher expectation to live longer.

Life expectancy is constantly increasing. However, a longer life not always 
corresponds to a healthier life. Indeed, even normal aging is associated with a 
decline in different cognitive functions. It has been proposed that a central 
mechanism that could contribute to this widespread cognitive decline is an 
ineffective inhibitory attentional control. Meditation, to the other hand, has 
been associated, in young adults, to enhancement of several attentional 
processes. Nevertheless, attention is not a unitary construct. An influent model 
proposed the distinction of three subsystems: the alerting (the ability to reach 
and maintain a vigilance state), the orienting (the capacity of focusing 
attention on a subset of stimuli), and the conflict resolution or executive 
component (the ability to resolve conflict or allocate limited resources between 
competing stimuli). Here, we investigated, employing the Attentional Network 
Task (ANT), the specific impact of age on these three subcomponents, and the 
protective role of long-term meditation testing a group of older adults naïve to 
meditation, a group of age-matched adults with long-term practice of meditation, 
and a group of young adults with no previous meditation experience. We reported 
a specific decline of the efficiency of the executive component in elderly that 
was not observed in age-matched meditators. Our results are encouraging for the 
investigation of the potential beneficial impact of meditation on other 
cognitive processes that decline in aging such as memory. Moreover, they could 
inform geriatric healthcare prevention and intervention strategies, proposing a 
new approach for cognitive remediation in elderly populations.

Economic problems related to the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of rare 
diseases are presented paying particular attention to the costs of financing 
treatment, including the issue of its refund, which is a fundamental and 
difficult to solve economic problem of the health care system. Rare diseases, 
despite the low frequency of occurrence, together cover a large group of 
diseases being a serious medical, social and economic problem. The adoption of 
Polish National Plan for Rare Diseases resulting from the recommendations of the 
Council of the European Union, the extension of institutional activities related 
to the area of public health and social initiatives seeking innovative solutions 
to create a model of social support for patients and their families, with very 
high complexity of the issues regarding rare diseases, results in the need for a 
coherent, comprehensive, system operations and adoption of comprehensive 
solutions.

Tuberculosis is a devastating disease, taking one human life every 20 seconds 
globally. We hypothesize that professional pathogens such as M.tb have acquired 
specific features that might assist in causing infection, persistence and 
transmissible pathology in their host. We have identified 121 methyltransferases 
(MTases) in the M.tb proteome, which use a variety of substrates - DNA, RNA, 
protein, intermediates of mycolic acid biosynthesis and other fatty acids - that 
are involved in cellular maintenance within the host. A comparative analysis of 
the proteome of the virulent strain H37Rv and the avirulent strain H37Ra 
identified 3 MTases, which displayed significant variations in terms of 
N-terminal extension/deletion and point mutations, possibly impacting various 
physicochemical properties. The cross-proteomic comparison of MTases of M.tb 
H37Rv with 15 different Mycobacterium species revealed the acquisition of novel 
MTases in a MTB complex as a function of evolution. Phylogenetic analysis 
revealed that these newly acquired MTases showed common roots with certain 
extremophiles such as halophilic and acidophilic organisms. Our results 
establish an evolutionary relationship of M.tb with halotolerant organisms and 
also the role of MTases of M.tb in withstanding the host osmotic stress, thereby 
pointing to their likely role in pathogenesis, virulence and niche adaptation.

The many women with breast cancer who underwent axillary lymph node dissection 
(ALND) suffer from the upper arm dysfunction. In this study, we investigated the 
effectiveness of a perioperative educational program for improving upper arm 
dysfunction in breast cancer patients following ALND. This study was a 
sub-analysis of a previous controlled trial with an educational program. The 
subjects of this analysis included 64 patients following ALND who completed 
measurements at 12 months. The perioperative educational program consisted of 
monitoring of arm dysfunction, exercises, massage, and lifestyle adjustments. 
The intervention group (37 patients) received this perioperative educational 
program over 12 months, while 27 patients in the control group received written 
information about shoulder exercise from on-site staff only before surgery. 
Primary outcomes were shoulder range of motion (ROM), arm girth, and grip 
strength. Secondary outcomes were evaluated with the Subjective Perception of 
Post-Operative Functional Impairment of the Arm (SPOFIA) scores, the 
Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) scores, and the Medical 
Outcome Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey v2 (SF-36v2). The SF-36v2 
measures health-related quality of life (QOL). Primary and secondary outcomes 
were compared between groups at 1 week (after drainage tube removal) and 12 
months after surgery, using the Mann-Whitney U test. The horizontal extension 
was significantly improved only in the intervention group. Moreover, the SPOFIA 
score was significantly improved in the intervention group, and other scores of 
the secondary outcomes were similar between the two groups. The perioperative 
educational program may improve postoperative upper arm dysfunction and 
symptoms.

BACKGROUND: Aortic stenosis is a progressive disease. Symptomatic aortic 
stenosis has a poor prognosis, which is frequently worse than that of a 
malignant disease. Cancer patients with severe aortic stenosis may be denied for 
optimal oncologic treatment because of high operative risk and for aortic valve 
replacement because of the significant comorbidity itself. In patients treated 
with medical therapy alone, 1-year-mortality exceeds 50 %.
CASE REPORT: A 71-year-old woman with well-differentiated, surgically treated, 
ovarian carcinoma and two relapses treated with chemo- and radiotherapy 
presented with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis (aortic valve area 0.6 cm(2), 
mean gradient 60 mmHg). The tumor was in stagnation. She was rejected for 
surgical valve replacement. We implanted a 29 mm CoreValve aortic prosthesis via 
transfemoral approach. After the procedure haemodynamic variables remain stable, 
patient's exertional capacity is excellent.
CONCLUSION: Aortic valve replacement improves survival of cancer patients with 
symptomatic aortic stenosis. Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVI) is a 
treatment option in inoperable patients and patients at high surgical risk. 
Symptoms should not be confused for the progression of the malignant disease. In 
patient selection emphasis should be made on their frailty and futility. 
Eligible patients must have a life expectancy of at least 1 year. Final decision 
has to be made by a multidisciplinary heart team. TAVI can reduce treatment risk 
and facilitate the oncologic treatment.

Mycobacterium tuberculosis codes for a HAD-phosphatase, Rv3042c (MtSerB2), that 
has earlier been characterized as a metabolic enzyme. Here we demonstrate that 
MtSerB2 is secreted into the cytosol of infected macrophages and is found in 
bronchoalveolar lavage samples of tuberculosis patients. MtSerB2 induces 
significant cytoskeleton rearrangements through cofilin activation and affects 
the expression of genes that regulate actin dynamics. It specifically interacts 
with HSP90, HSP70 and HSP27 that block apoptotic pathways and not with other 
HSPs. It actively dephosphorylates MAPK-p38 and NF-kappa B p65 that play crucial 
roles in inflammatory and immune responses. This in turn leads to 
down-regulation of Interleukin 8, a chemotactic and inflammatory cytokine. 
Finally, during evaluation of inhibitors against MtSerB2 we found that 
Clofazimine, a drug being evaluated for XDR and MDR tuberculosis, inhibits 
MtSerB2 phosphatase activity and reverses the above effects and interactions 
with host proteins. Overall, the study identifies that MtSerB2 has new functions 
that might help the pathogen to evade the host's immune response.

BACKGROUND: Engaging in regular physical activity (PA) is critical for health, 
and adopting a consistent PA routine early in life is associated with greater PA 
over the lifespan. College women with weight concerns are at risk for weight 
gain, which may be prevented with regular PA. However, little is known about 
changes in PA engagement in this at-risk group.
PURPOSE: Using an outcome expectancy framework, this study used a prospective 
longitudinal design to examine changes in PA during the first 2 years of 
college. We tested for concurrent and prospective within-person relations 
between body satisfaction/perceived eating behavior and PA to determine when 
weight-concerned college women may increase or decrease PA.
METHODS: Women who reported weight concerns at the start of college (n = 294) 
completed five assessments over 2 years, including measured weight, body/eating 
experiences, and 4 days of pedometer steps (per assessment). Multilevel models 
addressed the resulting nested data structure (days within assessments within 
participants).
RESULTS: Over 2 years, within-person change accounted for 65 % of PA variability 
(ICC = 0.35). PA was greatest at (and subsequent to) times when body 
satisfaction was lower, and when disinhibited eating and hedonic hunger were 
higher, than an individual's average (ps < 0.05). These changes were associated 
with 1-3 % of the recommended daily step totals.
CONCLUSIONS: Weight-conscious college women show greater PA after negative 
eating and weight experiences. As these experiences change over time, health 
promotion efforts should help college women identify alternative, positive 
motivators for PA, which could facilitate consistent PA engagement.

Bispecific immunoglobulins (Igs) typically contain at least two distinct 
variable domains (Fv) that bind to two different target proteins. They are 
conceived to facilitate clinical development of biotherapeutic agents for 
diseases where improved clinical outcome is obtained or expected by combination 
therapy compared to treatment by single agents. Almost all existing formats are 
linear in their concept and differ widely in drug-like and manufacture-related 
properties. To overcome their major limitations, we designed cross-over dual 
variable Ig-like proteins (CODV-Ig). Their design is akin to the design of 
circularly closed repeat architectures. Indeed, initial results showed that the 
traditional approach of utilizing (G4S)x linkers for biotherapeutics design does 
not identify functional CODV-Igs. Therefore, we applied an unprecedented 
molecular modeling strategy for linker design that consistently results in 
CODV-Igs with excellent biochemical and biophysical properties. CODV 
architecture results in a circular self-contained structure functioning as a 
self-supporting truss that maintains the parental antibody affinities for both 
antigens without positional effects. The format is universally suitable for 
therapeutic applications targeting both circulating and membrane-localized 
proteins. Due to the full functionality of the Fc domains, serum half-life 
extension as well as antibody- or complement-dependent cytotoxicity may support 
biological efficiency of CODV-Igs. We show that judicious choice in combination 
of epitopes and paratope orientations of bispecific biotherapeutics is 
anticipated to be critical for clinical outcome. Uniting the major advantages of 
alternative bispecific biotherapeutics, CODV-Igs are applicable in a wide range 
of disease areas for fast-track multi-parametric drug optimization.

Genotoxicity tests have traditionally been used only for hazard identification, 
with qualitative dichotomous groupings being used to identify compounds that 
have the capacity to induce mutations and/or cytogenetic alterations. However, 
there is an increasing interest in employing quantitative analysis of in vivo 
dose-response data to derive point of departure (PoD) metrics that can be used 
to establish human exposure limits or margins of exposure (MOEs), thereby 
supporting human health risk assessments and regulatory decisions. This work is 
an extension of our companion article on in vitro dose-response analyses and 
outlines how the combined benchmark dose (BMD) approach across included 
covariates can be used to improve the analyses and interpretation of in vivo 
genetic toxicity dose-response data. Using the BMD-covariate approach, we show 
that empirical comparisons of micronucleus frequency dose-response data across 
multiple studies justifies dataset merging, with subsequent analyses improving 
the precision of BMD estimates and permitting attendant potency ranking of seven 
clastogens. Similarly, empirical comparisons of Pig-a mutant phenotype frequency 
data collected in males and females justified dataset merging across sex. This 
permitted more effective scrutiny regarding the effect of post-exposure sampling 
time on the mutagenicity of N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea observed in reticulocytes and 
erythrocytes in the Pig-a assay. The BMD-covariate approach revealed 
tissue-specific differences in the induction of lacZ transgene mutations in 
Muta™Mouse specimens exposed to benzo[a]pyrene (BaP), with the results 
permitting the formulation of mechanistic hypotheses regarding the observed 
potency ranking. Lastly, we illustrate how historical dose-response data for 
assessments that examined numerous doses (i.e. induced lacZ mutant frequency 
(MF) across 10 doses of BaP) can be used to improve the precision of BMDs 
derived from datasets with far fewer doses (i.e. lacZ MF for 3 doses of 
dibenz[a,h]anthracene). Collectively, the presented examples illustrate how 
innovative use of the BMD approach can permit refinement of the use of in vivo 
data; improving the efficacy of experimental animal use in genetic toxicology 
without sacrificing PoD precision.

Translesion synthesis (TLS) employs specialized DNA polymerases to bypass 
replication fork stalling lesions. PrimPol was recently identified as a TLS 
primase and polymerase involved in DNA damage tolerance. Here, we identify a 
novel PrimPol binding partner, PolDIP2, and describe how it regulates PrimPol's 
enzymatic activities. PolDIP2 stimulates the polymerase activity of PrimPol, 
enhancing both its capacity to bind DNA and the processivity of the catalytic 
domain. In addition, PolDIP2 stimulates both the efficiency and error-free 
bypass of 8-oxo-7,8-dihydrodeoxyguanosine (8-oxoG) lesions by PrimPol. We show 
that PolDIP2 binds to PrimPol's catalytic domain and identify potential binding 
sites. Finally, we demonstrate that depletion of PolDIP2 in human cells causes a 
decrease in replication fork rates, similar to that observed in 
PrimPol(-/-)cells. However, depletion of PolDIP2 in PrimPol(-/-)cells does not 
produce a further decrease in replication fork rates. Together, these findings 
establish that PolDIP2 can regulate the TLS polymerase and primer extension 
activities of PrimPol, further enhancing our understanding of the roles of 
PolDIP2 and PrimPol in eukaryotic DNA damage tolerance.

PURPOSE: To prospectively evaluate the quality of life (QoL), functionality, and 
body image of subjects who had undergone surgery for adolescent idiopathic 
scoliosis (AIS) 5-12 years previously, and to identify the outcome predictors.
METHODS: The sample consisted of 87 patients for whom follow-up data were 
available out of a series of 91 patients who had surgery for AIS between 2002 
and 2009. We assessed the preoperative, 1-year postoperative, and 5-year or more 
postoperative SF-36 and SRS-23 questionnaire scores. Longitudinal clinical and 
radiographic data also were evaluated. Changes in the patient-oriented outcomes 
were compared with age and sex-adjusted normative values. A multiple regression 
analysis was used to identify possible outcome predictors.
RESULTS: Preoperatively, patients had impaired QoL, functionality, and body 
image compared to age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Surgery led to 
significant improvement of the SF-36 and SRS scores at the one-year and final 
control date, but the final scores on SF-36's physical indexes were lower than 
control subjects' scores. No clinically relevant differences with the normative 
values were detected in the final SRS scores. The height of the residual rib 
hump negatively predicted the total SRS and self-image scores; a more caudal 
level of fusion correlated with more postoperative pain.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients who underwent surgery for AIS a minimum of 5 years earlier 
had impaired self-reported physical QoL compared to control subjects, but they 
nevertheless performed better than before their surgery. Greater size of the 
residual hump and greater distal extension of the fusion area are negatively 
correlated with final self reported outcome.

Body Mass Transitions Through Childhood and Early Adolescence: A Multistate Life 
Table Approach.

Tran MK, Krueger PM, McCormick E, Davidson A, Main DS.

The growing prevalence of overweight and obesity among children is well 
documented, but prevalence estimates offer little insight into rates of 
transition to higher or lower body mass index (BMI; weight (kg)/height (m)(2)) 
categories. We estimated the expected numbers of years children would live as 
normal weight, overweight, and obese by race/ethnicity and sex, given rates of 
transition across BMI status levels. We used multistate life table methods and 
transition rates estimated from prospective cohort data (2007-2013) for Denver, 
Colorado, public schoolchildren aged 3-15 years. At age 3 years, normal-weight 
children could expect to live 11.1 of the following 13 years with normal weight 
status, and obese children could expect to live 9.8 years with obese status. At 
age 3 years, overweight children could expect to live 4.5 of the following 13 
years with normal weight status, 5.1 years with overweight status, and 3.4 years 
with obese status. Whites and Asians lived more years at lower BMI status levels 
than did blacks or Hispanics; sex differences varied by race/ethnicity. Children 
who were normal weight or obese at age 3 years were relatively unlikely to move 
into a different BMI category by age 15 years. Overweight children are 
relatively likely to transition to normal weight or obese status.

BACKGROUND: Berardinelli-Seip congenital lipodystrophy (BSCL) was initially 
described by Berardinelli in Brazil in 1954 and 5 years later by Seip in Norway. 
It is an autosomal recessive disease that leads to a generalized deficit of body 
fat, evolving with diabetes and hypertriglyceridemia. The aim of this study was 
to describe the clinical and laboratory characteristics of a large series of 
patients with BSCL.
METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study of patients with BSCL. A total of 54 
cases of BSCL were diagnosed, treated and followed for the past 17 years. We 
report clinical and laboratorial data of 44 of those patients.
RESULTS: There was a predominance of female patients (27 patients), and the mean 
age was 21.3 ± 13.7 years old. The majority of patients (30/44; 68.2 %) were 
diabetic, and almost half of them (14/30 patients, 46.7 %) were on insulin. The 
mean body mass index was 19.6 ± 3.3 and the mean body fat measured by 
dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) was 5.4 ± 0.8 %. Acanthosis nigricans, 
acromegaloid facies, atrophic cheeks, prognathism, phlebomegaly, and muscle 
hypertrophy were the most common clinical features. Only two patients had 
triglyceridemia lower than 150 mg/dl without the use of lipid-lowering drugs. 
Hyperinsulinemia was present in the majority of patients, and leptin values were 
very low in all patients.
CONCLUSIONS: We report one of the largest series of patients with BSCL treated 
at a single medical center. Earlier identification of the mutations and a better 
understanding of the pathophysiology can aid to better treatment and decrease 
complications, potentially improving life quality and expectancy.

Disability-Free Life Expectancy Over 30 Years: A Growing Female Disadvantage in 
the US Population.

Michigan, Ann Arbor. Douglas A. Wolf is with the Aging Studies Institute, 
Syracuse University, Syracuse, NY. Brenda C. Spillman is with the Health Policy 
Center at the Urban Institute, Washington, DC.

OBJECTIVES: To examine changes in active life expectancy in the United States 
over 30 years for older men and women (aged ≥ 65 years).
METHODS: We used the 1982 and 2004 National Long Term Care Survey and the 2011 
National Health and Aging Trends Study to estimate age-specific mortality and 
disability rates, the overall chances of survival and of surviving without 
disability, and years of active life for men and women.
RESULTS: For older men, longevity has increased, disability has been postponed 
to older ages, disability prevalence has fallen, and the percentage of remaining 
life spent active has increased. However, for older women, small longevity 
increases have been accompanied by even smaller postponements in disability, a 
reversal of a downward trend in moderate disability, and stagnation of active 
life as a percentage of life expectancy. As a consequence, older women no longer 
live more active years than men, despite their longer lives.
CONCLUSIONS: Neither a compression nor expansion of late-life disability is 
inevitable. Public health measures directed at older women to postpone 
disability may be needed to offset impending long-term care pressures related to 
population aging.

AIMS: Up to 30% of insulin-treated type 2 diabetes patients are unable to 
achieve HbA1c targets despite optimization of insulin multiple daily injections 
(MDI). For these patients the use of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion 
(CSII) represents a useful but under-utilized alternative. The aim of the 
present analysis was to examine the cost-effectiveness of initiating CSII in 
type 2 diabetes patients failing to achieve good glycemic control on MDI in the 
Netherlands.
METHODS: Long-term projections were made using the IMS CORE Diabetes Model. 
Clinical input data were sourced from the OpT2mise trial. The analysis was 
performed over a lifetime time horizon. The discount rates applied to future 
costs and clinical outcomes were 4% and 1.5% per annum, respectively.
RESULTS: CSII was associated with improved quality-adjusted life expectancy 
compared with MDI (9.38 quality-adjusted life years [QALYs] vs 8.95 QALYs, 
respectively). The breakdown of costs indicated that ∼50% of costs were 
attributable to diabetes-related complications. Higher acquisition costs of CSII 
vs MDI were partially offset by the reduction in complications. The ICER was 
estimated at EUR 62,895 per QALY gained and EUR 60,474 per QALY gained when 
indirect costs were included.
CONCLUSIONS: In the Netherlands, CSII represents a cost-effective option in 
patients with type 2 diabetes who continue to have poorly-controlled HbA1c 
despite optimization of MDI. Since the ICER falls below the willingness-to-pay 
threshold of EUR 80,000 per QALY gained, CSII is likely to represent good-value 
for money in the treatment of poorly-controlled T2D patients compared with MDI.

Gender differences in patients with carotid stenosis.

This overview analyses gender differences in prevalence, epidemiology, risk 
factors and therapy in patients with carotid stenosis in a systematic review. 
Ischemic stroke is a leading cause of death in Western society, where about 20% 
of cases are triggered by a carotid stenosis or occlusion, which occurs more 
frequently in men than in women. The stroke-protective effect of carotid 
endarterectomy is greater in men. Men have lower peri-procedural stroke and 
death rates. Particularly men with carotid stenosis and a life expectancy of at 
least 5 years benefit from surgical treatment. Also, the recurrence rate of 
ipsilateral stroke 5 years after initial surgery is lower in men than in women. 
It is not yet fully clarified whether there are significant gender differences 
regarding the outcome after endovascular versus surgical treatment. Gender 
differences in the outcome of carotid artery repair may be caused by biological, 
anatomical (smaller vessel diameter in women) or hormonal differences as well as 
a protracted development of atherosclerotic changes in women and different 
plaque morphology. Moreover, women are on average older at the time of surgery 
and their surgical treatment is often delayed. To reduce the risk of stroke and 
to improve treatment outcome especially for women, further research on gender 
differences and their causes is mandatory and promising.
