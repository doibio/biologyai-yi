Peptides and proteins constitute a vast pool of excellent drug candidates. 
Evolution has equipped these molecules with superior drug-like properties such 
as high specificity and potency. However, native peptides and proteins suffer 
from an inadequate pharmacokinetic profile, and their outstanding 
pharmacological potential can only be realized if this issue is addressed during 
drug development. To overcome this challenge, a variety of half-life extension 
techniques relying on covalent chemical modification have been developed. These 
methods include PEGylation, fusion to unstructured polypeptide-based PEG 
mimetics, conjugation of large polysaccharides, native-like glycosylation, 
lipidation, fusion to albumin or the Fc domain of IgG, and derivatization with 
bio-orthogonal moieties that direct self-assembly. This review provides an 
overview of available conjugation chemistries, biophysical properties, and 
safety data associated with these concepts. Moreover, the effects of these 
modifications on peptide and protein pharmacokinetics are demonstrated through 
key examples.

Quantitative assessments of the health status of a population are essential to 
make decisions and set priorities in the field of public health. Changing 
epidemiologic patterns increase the demand for comprehensive estimates of 
population health across the full health spectrum, including non-communicable 
diseases and injuries. Burden of disease (BoD) analysis has helped meet this 
need. With the success of the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study, the BoD 
technique has become predominantly associated with the GBD approach and its 
methodology using disability-adjusted life year (DALY) has been rapidly 
disseminated and generally accepted over the last several years. The first 
Korean BoD study using the DALY metric was presented in 2002. Various BoD 
studies have since been conducted, but the DALY concept has remained primarily 
academic and has not yet been actively utilized in the health policy arena. 
Here, we review the DALY metric and population-based Korean BoD studies using 
national health data, with the intent of increasing the understanding of their 
value and their potential role in strengthening future assessments of the Korean 
population's health status.

When thinking about priority setting in access to healthcare resources, 
decision-making requires that cost-effectiveness is balanced against medical 
ethics. The burden of disease has emerged as an important approach to the 
assessment of health needs for political decision-making. However, the 
disability adjusted life years approach hides conceptual and methodological 
issues regarding the claims and value of disabled people. In this article, we 
discuss ethical issues that are raised as a consequence of the introduction of 
evidence-based health policy, such as economic evidence, in establishing 
resource allocation priorities. In terms of ethical values in health priority 
setting in Korea, there is no reliable rationale for the judgment used in 
decision-making as well as for setting separate and distinct priorities for 
different government bodies. An important question, therefore, is which ethical 
values guiding the practice of decision-making should be reconciled with the 
economic evidence found in Korean healthcare. The health technology assessment 
core model from the European network for Health Technology Assessment (EUnetHTA) 
project is a good example of incorporating ethical values into decision-making. 
We suggest that a fair distribution of scarce healthcare resources in South 
Korea can be achieved by considering the ethical aspects of healthcare.

The global burden of disease study (GBD) provides valuable information for 
evaluating population health in terms of disease burden. This study collected 
and reviewed GBD data in Korea for the year 1990 and 2013. The burdens of 
cancer, cardiovascular disease, communicable disease, and injuries have 
decreased remarkably, thereby greatly diminishing the overall disease burden on 
Korea. Meanwhile, the burdens due to non-fatal chronic diseases such as 
neuropsychiatric and musculoskeletal disease became major burden contributors. 
Responding to this circumstance presents a complex challenge to the Korean 
health system and Korean health policy.

Years of life lost (YLLs) are estimated based on mortality and cause of death 
(CoD); therefore, it is necessary to accurately calculate CoD to estimate the 
burden of disease. The garbage code algorithm was developed by the Global Burden 
of Disease (GBD) Study to redistribute inaccurate CoD and enhance the validity 
of CoD estimation. This study aimed to estimate cause-specific mortality rates 
and YLLs in Korea by applying a modified garbage code algorithm. CoD data for 
2010-2012 were used to calculate the number of deaths. The garbage code 
algorithm was then applied to calculate target cause (i.e., valid CoD) and 
adjusted CoD using the garbage code redistribution. The results showed that 
garbage code deaths accounted for approximately 25% of all CoD during 2010-2012. 
In 2012, lung cancer contributed the most to cause-specific death according to 
the Statistics Korea. However, when CoD was adjusted using the garbage code 
redistribution, ischemic heart disease was the most common CoD. Furthermore, 
before garbage code redistribution, self-harm contributed the most YLLs followed 
by lung cancer and liver cancer; however, after application of the garbage code 
redistribution, though self-harm was the most common leading cause of YLL, it is 
followed by ischemic heart disease and lung cancer. Our results showed that 
garbage code deaths accounted for a substantial amount of mortality and YLLs. 
The results may enhance our knowledge of burden of disease and help prioritize 
intervention settings by changing the relative importance of burden of disease.

Disability weight for each disease plays a key role in combining years lived 
with disability and years of life lost in disability adjusted life year. For the 
Korean Burden of Disease 2012 study, we have conducted a re-estimation of 
disability weights for causes of disease by adapting the methodology of a recent 
Global Burden of Disease study. Our study was conducted through a 
self-administered web-based survey using a paired comparison (PC) as the main 
valuation method. A total of 496 physicians and medical college students who 
were attending in third or fourth grade of a regular course conducted the 
survey. We applied a probit regression on the PC data and computed the predicted 
probabilities of each cause of disease from the coefficient estimates of the 
probit regression. We used 'being dead (1)' and 'full health (0)' as anchor 
points to rescale the predicted probability of each cause of disease on a scale 
of 0 to 1. By this method, disability weights for a total of 228 causes of 
disease were estimated. There was a fairly high correlation between the 
disability weights of overlapping causes of disease from this study and a 
previous South Korean study despite the differences in valuation methods and 
time periods. In conclusion, we have shown that disability weights can be 
estimated based on a PC by including 'full health' and 'being dead' as anchor 
points without resorting to a person trade-off. Through developments in the 
methodology of disability weights estimation from this study, disability weights 
can be easily estimated and continuously revised.

Health-Adjusted Life Expectancy (HALE) is a summary measurement that estimates 
the average number of years that a person at a given age can expect to live an 
equivalent of full health. HALE has not been previously reported at national or 
regional levels in Korea. This study aimed to measure HALE from 2005 to 2011 in 
Korea at both the national and regional levels as part of the Korean National 
Burden Study of 2012. To measure life expectancy (LE) and HALE, we used the life 
table method and an approach proposed by Sullivan. We used three main data sets 
to estimate HALE: probability of death, prevalence of disease, and disability 
weights. Overall, LE and HALE have increased from 2005 to 2011. For example, in 
2011, LE and HALE at birth in males were 77.6 and 65.8 years, respectively, and 
84.4 and 68.9 in females. It might be assumed that the overall health status of 
Korean population has been increasing. However, we confirmed that a gap between 
LE and HALE still exists. Additionally, we found out that there was a 
significant difference between LE and HALE among various sub-regions. This study 
is the first to measure HALE using our own database, including disability weight 
that reflected Korean preferences. Finally, the Korean government and society 
should make an effort to reduce the gap between LE and HALE and to reduce 
regional differences.

This study is part of a 5-year research project on the national burden of 
diseases, injuries, and risk factors in Korea. Using disability-adjusted life 
years (DALYs), a metric introduced by the 1990 Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 
project, we performed a comprehensive and detailed assessment of the magnitude 
and distribution of both fatal and non-fatal health problems in the Korean 
population. The concept and general approach were consistent with the original 
GBD study, with some methodological modifications to make the study more 
suitable for Korea. We computed DALYs for 313 causes in both sexes and nine age 
groups using the entire population's medical records and newly generated Korean 
disability weights. In 2012, the dominant disease burden was non-communicable 
diseases, which accounted for 85.21% of total DALYs, while injuries accounted 
for 7.77% and communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional disorders for 
7.02%. Of the total DALYs, 88.67% were from years lived with disability and 
11.32% were from years of life lost due to premature mortality. Diabetes 
mellitus was the leading cause of DALYs, followed by low back pain, chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease, ischemic heart disease, ischemic stroke, 
cirrhosis of the liver, falls, osteoarthritis, motorized vehicle with three or 
more wheels, and self-harm. The results reported here identify key health 
challenges and opportunities for future health interventions and policy changes, 
and provide information that will help assess the major public health issues in 
Korea, a nation faced with one of the world's most rapidly ageing populations.

In recognition of Korea's rising burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs), we 
investigated the nation's NCD status and extracted detailed information from the 
2012 Korean Burden of Disease study. Consistent with that study, we used 
disability-adjusted life year (DALY) as a metric. Using national data sources 
and disability weights specific to the Korean population, we analyzed 116 
disaggregated NCDs from the study's four-level disease and injury hierarchy for 
both sexes and nine age groups. Per 100,000 population, 21,019 DALYs were lost 
to 116 NCDs. Of those, 13.97% were due to premature death (death prior to the 
standard life expectancy for a subject's age) and 86.03% to non-fatal health 
outcomes. Based on traditional statistics, the main causes of health loss were 
mortality of neoplasms; cardiovascular and circulatory diseases; diabetes, 
urogenital, blood, and endocrine diseases; and chronic respiratory diseases. 
When combined with analyses of premature death and non-fatal outcomes, however, 
a substantially different view emerged: the main causes of health loss were 
diabetes mellitus, low back pain, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 
ischemic heart disease, ischemic stroke, cirrhosis of the liver, osteoarthritis, 
asthma, gastritis and duodenitis, and periodontal disease (in that order), 
collectively causing 49.20% of DALYs. Thus, burden of disease data using DALYs 
rather than traditional statistics brings a new perspective to characterization 
of the population's health that provides practical information useful for 
developing and targeting national NCD control programs to better meet national 
needs.

Cancer causes a significant deterioration in health and premature death and is a 
national socioeconomic burden. This study aimed to measure the burden of cancer 
using the disability-adjusted life year (DALY) metric based on the newly adopted 
methodology from the Global Burden of Disease Study in 2010. This study was 
conducted based on data from the Korean National Cancer Registry. The DALYs were 
calculated using a prevalence-based method instead of the incidence-based method 
used by previous studies. The total burden of cancer in 2012 was 3,470.79 DALYs 
per 100,000 persons. Lung cancer was the most prevalent cancer burden, followed 
by liver, stomach, colorectal, and breast cancer. The DALYs for lung, liver, 
stomach, colon and rectum, and pancreatic cancer were high in men, whereas the 
DALYs for breast, lung, stomach, colorectal, and liver cancer were high in 
women. Health loss from leukemia and cancer of the brain and nervous system was 
prevalent for those younger than age 20; from stomach, breast, and liver for 
those aged 30-50; and from lung, colon and rectum, and pancreas for a large 
proportion of individuals over the age of 60. The most important differences 
were that the DALYs were calculated by prevalence and that other components of 
the DALYs were measured by a population-based perspective. Thus, 
prevalence-based DALYs could provide more suitable data for decision making in 
the healthcare field.

Globally, the incidence of communicable diseases has decreased compared to 
non-communicable diseases. However, chronic communicable diseases such as 
HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis persist worldwide. Furthermore, emerging new 
infections such as H1N1 influenza pose a new threat to public health. However, 
most studies have focused on non-communicable diseases because of their 
increasing incidence, with fewer studies investigating communicable diseases. 
Therefore, we estimated the burden of communicable diseases in Korea using 
national representative 2012 data. To estimate the disability-adjusted life 
years (DALY), we used cause of death data from the Statistics Korea to estimate 
the years of life lost (YLL), applied the Korean garbage code algorithm, and 
used national claims data from the National Health Insurance Service (NHIS) to 
estimate years lived with disability (YLD). In 2012, the total DALYs of 
communicable disease were 445 per 100,000, with 129 YLLs per 100,000 and 316 
YLDs per 100,000. The total DALYs in men were 468 per 100,000, greater than the 
422 per 100,000 DALYs seen in women. The DALYs of lower respiratory infections 
were the highest value among communicable diseases at 143/100,000 DALYs followed 
by tuberculosis and upper respiratory infections. The 40-49 years old age group 
had the largest number of total DALYs. In contrast, the over 80 years old age 
group had the largest number of total DALYs per 100,000 followed by the 70-79 
and 0-9 years old age groups. These results enable the prioritization of 
interventions related to communicable diseases and can be used for 
evidence-based public health policies.

Maternal and child health is an important issue throughout the world. Given 
their impact on maternal and child health, nutritional issues need to be 
carefully addressed. Accordingly, the effect of maternal, child, and nutritional 
disorders on disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) should be calculated. The 
present study used DALYs to estimate the burden of disease of maternal, 
neonatal, and nutritional disorders in the Korean population in 2012. For this 
purpose, we used claim data of the Korean National Health Insurance Service, 
DisMod II, and death data of the Statistics Korea and adhered to incidence-based 
DALY estimation methodology. The total DALYs per 100,000 population were 376 in 
maternal disorders, 64 in neonatal disorders, and 58 in nutritional 
deficiencies. The leading causes of DALYs were abortion in maternal disorders, 
preterm birth complications in neonatal disorders, and iron-deficiency anemia in 
nutritional deficiencies. Our findings shed light on the considerable burden of 
maternal, neonatal, and nutritional conditions, emphasizing the need for health 
care policies that can reduce morbidity and mortality.

The purpose of this study was to estimate the national burden of mental 
substance disorders on medical care utilization in Korea using National Health 
Insurance System (NHIS) data and updated disability weight, in terms of 
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). For each of the 24 disorders, the 
incident years lived with disability (YLDs) was calculated, using NHIS data to 
estimate prevalence and incidence rates. The DisMod-II software program was used 
to model duration and remission. The years of life lost (YLLs) due to premature 
death were calculated from causes of death statistics. DALYs were computed as 
the sum of YLDs and YLLs, and time discounting and age weighting were applied. 
The year examined was 2012, and the subjects were divided into 9 groups 
according to age. In 2012, the Korean burden of mental and substance use 
disorders was 945,391 DALYs. More than 98% of DALYs were from YLDs, and the 
burden in females was greater than that in males, though the burden in males 
aged less than 19 years old was greater than that in females. Unipolar 
depressive disorders, schizophrenia, and anxiety disorders were found to be 
major diseases that accounted for more than 70% of the burden, and most DALYs 
occurred in their 30-59. Mental and substance use disorders accounted for 6.2% 
of the total burden of disease and were found to be the 7th greatest burden of 
disease. Therefore, mental and substance use disorders need to be embraced by 
mainstream health care with resources commensurate with the burden.

A system for assessing the burdens imposed by disease and injury was developed 
to meet healthcare, priority setting, and policy planning needs. The first such 
system, the Global Burden of Disease (GBD), was implemented in 1990. However, 
problems associated with limited data and assumed disability weightings remain 
to be resolved. The purpose of the present study was to estimate national 
burdens of injuries in Korea using more reliable data and disability weightings. 
The incidences of injuries were estimated using the Korean National Hospital 
Discharge Survey and the mortality data from the Korean National Statistical 
Office in 2010. Additionally, durations of injuries and age at injury onset were 
used to calculate disability-adjusted life years (DALY) using disability 
weightings derived from the Korean Burden of Disease (KBD) study. Korea had 
1,581,072 DALYs resulting from injuries (3,170 per 100,000), which was 22.9% 
higher than found by the GBD 2010 study. Males had almost twice as heavy an 
injury burden as females. Road injury, fall, and self-harm ranked 1st, 2nd, and 
3rd in terms of burden of injury in 2010. Total injury burden peaked in the 
forties, while burden per person declined gradually from early adulthood. We 
hope that this study contributes to the reliable evaluation of injury burden and 
a better understanding of injury-related health status using nation-specific, 
dependable data.

We develop statistical and mathematical based methodologies for determining (as 
the experiment progresses) the amount of information required to complete the 
estimation of stable population parameters with pre-specified levels of 
confidence. We do this in the context of life table models and data for 
growth/death for three species of Daphniids as investigated by J. Stark and J. 
Banks [17]. The ideas developed here also have wide application in the health 
and social sciences where experimental data are often expensive as well as 
difficult to obtain.

Urban areas, with large and dense populations, offer conditions that favor the 
emergence and spread of certain infectious diseases. One common feature of urban 
populations is the existence of large socioeconomic inequalities which are often 
mirrored by disparities in access to healthcare. Recent empirical evidence 
suggests that higher levels of socioeconomic inequalities are associated with 
worsened public health outcomes, including higher rates of sexually transmitted 
diseases (STD's) and lower life expectancy. However, the reasons for these 
associations are still speculative. Here we formulate a mathematical model to 
study the effect of healthcare disparities on the spread of an infectious 
disease that does not confer lasting immunity, such as is true of certain STD's. 
Using a simple epidemic model of a population divided into two groups that 
differ in their recovery rates due to different levels of access to healthcare, 
we find that both the basic reproductive number (R0) of the disease and its 
endemic prevalence are increasing functions of the disparity between the two 
groups, in agreement with empirical evidence. Unexpectedly, this can be true 
even when the fraction of the population with better access to healthcare is 
increased if this is offset by reduced access within the disadvantaged group. 
Extending our model to more than two groups with different levels of access to 
healthcare, we find that increasing the variance of recovery rates among groups, 
while keeping the mean recovery rate constant, also increases R0 and disease 
prevalence. In addition, we show that these conclusions are sensitive to how we 
quantify the inequalities in our model, underscoring the importance of basing 
analyses on appropriate measures of inequalities. These insights shed light on 
the possible impact that increasing levels of inequalities in healthcare access 
can have on epidemic outcomes, while offering plausible explanations for the 
observed empirical patterns.

INTRODUCTION: Stroke is one of the leading causes of death in the world; its 
incidence is increasing due to increased life expectancy. However, treatment 
options for these patients are limited since no clinically effective drugs have 
been developed to date.
DEVELOPMENT: According to clinical evidence, a number of neurochemical changes 
take place after stroke, including energy depletion, increased free radical 
synthesis, calcium accumulation, neurotransmitter imbalance, excitotoxicity, 
and, at a later stage, immune system activation leading to inflammation. Immune 
response has been shown to be a major factor in disease progression. The release 
of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF increase brain damage secondary to 
excitotoxicity and calcium accumulation, and promote free radical synthesis and 
cell death through various mechanisms. On the other hand, certain 
anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-10 and IL-4, have been shown to have a 
neuroprotective effect and even promote neurogenesis and synapse remodeling, 
which makes immune modulation a promising treatment approach.
CONCLUSIONS: Understanding the relationship between the immune system and the 
nervous system not only deepens our knowledge of stroke but also provides new 
diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic strategies that may increase the quality 
of life of stroke patients.

AIMS: The first longevity study demonstrating that rats treated with the MAO-B 
inhibitory dose of (-)-deprenyl (0.25mg/kg) lived significantly longer than 
their saline-treated peers was published in 1988, and corroborated in many 
papers. The recent findings that (-)-deprenyl is primarily a PEA-derived 
synthetic catecholaminergic activity enhancer substance; 
(2R)-1-(1-benzofuran-2-yl)-N-propylpentane-2-amine (BPAP) is a 
tryptamine-derived synthetic enhancer substance, initiated our first longevity 
study on rats with low enhancer doses of (-)-deprenyl and BPAP to test the 
enhancer effect's role in life extension.
MAIN METHODS: We used the shuttle box technique for selecting the optimum doses 
of (-)-deprenyl and BPAP. (-)-Deprenyl exerts in rats in 0.001mg/kg its 
'specific' enhancer effect and in 0.1mg/kg its 'non-specific' enhancer effect. 
BPAP exerts its 'specific' enhancer effect in 0.0001mg/kg and its 'non-specific' 
enhancer effect in 0.05mg/kg. Groups of male Wistar rats (N=40) were treated 
subcutaneously from their 10th week until death, three times weekly, with saline 
(0.5ml/kg), and the selected doses of (-)-deprenyl or BPAP, respectively. As an 
indicator of aging we tested the age-related changes in their learning ability.
KEY FINDINGS: Rats treated with 0.0001 or 0.05mg/kg BPAP lived significantly 
longer than their saline treated peers (P<0.02) and BPAP was more potent in 
extending rats' lifespan than (-)-deprenyl. 18-month-old rats treated with 
0.0001mg/kg BPAP were as good learners as 3-month-old saline treated rats.
SIGNIFICANCE: The study revealed that the enhancer effect is responsible for 
life extension.

The later stages of heart failure are characterized by a steady decline in 
quality of life. Clinical priorities should be to maintain functional capacity 
and quality of life. In the absence of sufficient organs for transplantation, 
options include left ventricular assist devices and inotropic support. Areas 
covered: We examined data published in the last two decades on the use of 
inotropes and inodilators in advanced heart failure. Expert commentary: In the 
literature, use of conventional inotropes, including adrenergic agonists and 
phosphodiesterase inhibitors, appears to be suboptimal for achieving the 
clinical priorities of late-stage heart failure. Evidence suggests instead that 
the calcium-sensitizing inodilator levosimendan, administered intermittently, 
delivers improvements in functional capacity and quality of life and does so 
with no adverse impact on life expectancy. At a terminal or near-terminal stage 
of heart failure, the therapeutic philosophy should shift towards meeting 
patients' existential priorities rather than traditional heart failure-centric 
targets.

BACKGROUND: A recent multicenter study presented 52-week safety and efficacy 
results from an open-label extension of a randomized, sham-controlled trial for 
patients with chronic migraine (CM) undergoing peripheral nerve stimulation of 
the occipital nerves. We present the data from a single center of 20 patients 
enrolled at the Cleveland Clinic's Pain Management Department.
METHODS: In this single center, 20 patients were implanted with a 
neurostimulation system, randomized to an active or control group for 12 weeks, 
and received open-label treatment for an additional 40 weeks. Outcomes collected 
included number of headache days, pain intensity, Migraine Disability Assessment 
(MIDAS), Zung Pain and Distress (PAD), direct patient reports of headache pain 
relief, quality of life, satisfaction, and adverse events (AEs).
RESULTS: Headache days per month were reduced by 8.51 (±9.81) days (P < 0.0001). 
The proportion of patients who achieved a 30% and 50% reduction in headache days 
and/or pain intensity was 60% and 35%, respectively. MIDAS and Zung PAD were 
reduced for all patients. Fifteen (75%) of the 20 patients at the site reported 
at least one AE. A total of 20 AEs were reported from the site.
CONCLUSION: Our results support the 12-month efficacy of 20 CM patients 
receiving peripheral nerve stimulation of the occipital nerves in this 
single-center trial.

Short- and Long-term Effects of Pulmonary Rehabilitation in Patients With Mild 
COPD: A COMPARISON WITH PATIENTS WITH MODERATE TO SEVERE COPD.

Research and Rehabilitation Laboratory, School of Health Sciences (Drs Jácome 
and Marques), and Institute for Research in Biomedicine (iBiMED) (Dr Marques), 
University of Aveiro, Aveiro, Portugal.

PURPOSE: Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) is effective in patients with moderate to 
severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, the effects of PR 
in patients with mild COPD have not yet been established. Thus, this study 
investigated the short- and long-term effects of PR in patients with mild COPD 
in comparison with patients with moderate to severe disease.
METHODS: A total of 32 patients with mild (group 1) and 29 with moderate to 
severe (group 2) COPD completed the study. Both groups participated in a 12-week 
PR program with exercise training and psychosocial support and education. 
Outcome measures at baseline, 3 (post-PR), 6, and 9 months later included 
6-minute walk test (6MWT); Modified Medical Research Council Dyspnea Scale; 
1-repetition maximum chest press and knee extension; a brief physical activity 
assessment; the number of exacerbations in the past 3 months and the St. George 
Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ).
RESULTS: Improvements in the 6MWT, chest press, knee extension, and physical 
activity were observed post-PR (P < .001), with no differences between the 2 
groups. Reduction in the number of exacerbations (P < .001) and improvements in 
the SGRQ total (P < .001) were also observed, however, with greater magnitude in 
group 2 (P = .029 and P < .001, respectively). Except for peripheral muscle 
strength (P < .002), all the achieved benefits were sustained at 6 and 9 months 
(P > .05).
CONCLUSIONS: Pulmonary rehabilitation improves exercise tolerance, muscle 
strength, physical activity, and health-related quality of life and reduces 
exacerbations in patients with mild COPD as it does in patients with moderate to 
severe COPD. Moreover, most of these benefits were maintained at 9-month 
follow-up, suggesting that PR could be part of the management of mild COPD.

Non-umbilical cutaneous metastases from pancreatic adenocarcinomas are extremely 
rare. Only a few cases have been reported in the literature. An 83-year-old 
Korean woman, with no previous medical history, presented with a painful nodule 
on her scalp. Histologic examination of the nodule revealed a metastatic 
adenocarcinoma, and immunohistochemical staining was positive for cytokeratin 
(CK) 7 and CK 19. These findings were consistent with a metastatic carcinoma of 
pancreatic origin. An abdominal computed tomography scan identified a mass on 
the pancreatic head and multiple enlarged lymph nodes. Pathological examination 
of an endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle biopsy of the pancreatic mass 
determined that it was a poorly differentiated carcinoma. The patient refused 
any treatment owing to her old age and short life expectancy. Four months later, 
the disease progressed rapidly, and the patient died.

OBJECTIVES: Treatment rollout has dramatically improved life expectancy for 
people with HIV and AIDS. Women represent a substantial proportion of patients 
in the UK (approximately one-third of patients in care are female according to 
the HIV Annual Report 2014). This study examines psychosocial and biomedical 
issues for women diagnosed with HIV in the UK, comparing those above and below
