OBJECTIVE: To examine the cost-effectiveness of the MMHU for older people with 
delirium and dementia in general hospitals, compared with standard care.
METHODS: Six hundred participants aged over 65 admitted for acute medical care, 
identified on admission as cognitively impaired, were randomised to the MMHU or 
to standard care on acute geriatric or general medical wards. Cost per quality 
adjusted life year (QALY) gained, at 3-month follow-up, was assessed in 
trial-based economic evaluation (599/600 participants, intervention: 309). 
Multiple imputation and complete-case sample analyses were employed to deal with 
missing QALY data (55%).
RESULTS: The total adjusted health and social care costs, including direct costs 
of the intervention, at 3 months was £7714 and £7862 for MMHU and standard care 
groups, respectively (difference -£149 (95% confidence interval [CI]: -298, 4)). 
The difference in QALYs gained was 0.001 (95% CI: -0.006, 0.008). The 
probability that the intervention was dominant was 58%, and the probability that 
it was cost-saving with QALY loss was 39%. At £20,000/QALY threshold, the 
probability of cost-effectiveness was 94%, falling to 59% when cost-saving QALY 
loss cases were excluded.
CONCLUSIONS: The MMHU was strongly cost-effective using usual criteria, although 
considerably less so when the less acceptable situation with QALY loss and cost 
savings were excluded. Nevertheless, this model of care is worthy of further 
evaluation.

OBJECTIVES: To describe the essence of the nurses' lived experience and explore 
the meaning of their involvement in end-of-life care after a do-not-resuscitate 
decision has been made.
RESEARCH METHODOLOGY/DESIGN: The research design embraced qualitative, 
exploratory and descriptive approaches utilising aspects of phenomenology. 
Purposive sampling of twenty-six registered nurses was used. Data was collected 
using the reflective journaling technique and were analysed using an integrated 
approach. Field notes were also used as a mean to enrich the description of the 
findings contextually.
SETTING: Medical units in Saudi Arabia.
RESULTS: Three main themes emerged: exhausted medical treatment, continuity of 
nursing care and cultural considerations in nursing care. Related sub-themes 
were also identified as an extension to the description of the main themes.
CONCLUSION: The findings affirm that nurses working on medical units continue to 
maintain a constant level of care for patients and families after the 
do-not-resuscitate decision. Nurses found that caring for dying patients was a 
rewarding and worthwhile experience, albeit a challenging and demanding one. The 
findings suggest that improvement in end-of-life care would be best achieved by 
collaborative and interdisciplinary practices amongst the health care team 
members.

OBJECTIVE: There have been few cost-effectiveness analyses of population-based 
colorectal cancer screening in Japan, and there is no consensus on the optimal 
use of total colonoscopy and the fecal immunochemical test for colorectal cancer 
screening with regard to cost-effectiveness and total colonoscopy workload. The 
present study aimed to examine the cost-effectiveness of colorectal cancer 
screening using Japanese data to identify the optimal use of total colonoscopy 
and fecal immunochemical test.
METHODS: We developed a Markov model to assess the cost-effectiveness of 
colorectal cancer screening offered to an average-risk population aged 40 years 
or over. The cost, quality-adjusted life-years and number of total colonoscopy 
procedures required were evaluated for three screening strategies: (i) a fecal 
immunochemical test-based strategy; (ii) a total colonoscopy-based strategy; 
(iii) a strategy of adding population-wide total colonoscopy at 50 years to a 
fecal immunochemical test-based strategy.
RESULTS: All three strategies dominated no screening. Among the three, Strategy 
1 was dominated by Strategy 3, and the incremental cost per quality-adjusted 
life-years gained for Strategy 2 against Strategies 1 and 3 were JPY 293 616 and 
JPY 781 342, respectively. Within the Japanese threshold (JPY 5-6 million per 
QALY gained), Strategy 2 was the most cost-effective, followed by Strategy 3; 
however, Strategy 2 required more than double the number of total colonoscopy 
procedures than the other strategies.
CONCLUSIONS: The total colonoscopy-based strategy could be the most 
cost-effective for population-based colorectal cancer screening in Japan. 
However, it requires more total colonoscopy procedures than the other 
strategies. Depending on total colonoscopy capacity, the strategy of adding 
total colonoscopy for individuals at a specified age to a fecal immunochemical 
test-based screening may be an optimal solution.

BACKGROUND: Human papillomavirus (HPV) plays a role in the development of benign 
and malign neoplasms in both sexes. The Italian recommendations for HPV vaccines 
consider only females. The BEST II study (Bayesian modelling to assess the 
Effectiveness of a vaccination Strategy to prevent HPV-related diseases) 
evaluates 1) the cost-effectiveness of immunization strategies targeting 
universal vaccination compared with cervical cancer screening and female-only 
vaccination and 2) the economic impact of immunization on various HPV-induced 
diseases.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate whether female-only 
vaccination or universal vaccination is the most cost-effective intervention 
against HPV.
METHODS: We present a dynamic Bayesian Markov model to investigate transmission 
dynamics in cohorts of females and males in a follow-up period of 55 years. We 
assumed that quadrivalent vaccination (against HPV 16, 18, 6, and 11) is 
available for 12-year-old individuals. The model accounts for the progression of 
subjects across HPV-induced health states (cervical, vaginal, vulvar, anal, 
penile, and head/neck cancer as well as anogenital warts). The sexual mixing is 
modeled on the basis of age-, sex-, and sexual behavioral-specific matrices to 
obtain the dynamic force of infection.
RESULTS: In comparison to cervical cancer screening, universal vaccination 
results in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of €1,500. When universal 
immunization is compared with female-only vaccination, it is cost-effective with 
an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of €11,600. Probabilistic sensitivity 
analysis shows a relatively large amount of parameter uncertainty, which 
interestingly has, however, no substantial impact on the decision-making 
process. The intervention being assessed seems to be associated with an 
attractive cost-effectiveness profile.
CONCLUSIONS: Universal HPV vaccination is found to be a cost-effective choice 
when compared with either cervical cancer screening or female-only vaccination 
within the Italian context.

BACKGROUND: Reliable burden of disease (BOD) estimates are needed to support 
decision making in health care.
OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to introduce an analysis approach 
based on individual-level longitudinal survey data that estimates the burden of 
diabetes in patients with coronary heart disease in terms of quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs) lost.
METHODS: Data from two postal surveys (2006, N = 1022; 2010-2011, N = 716) of 
survivors from the KORA Myocardial Infarction Registry in Southern Germany were 
analyzed. Accumulated QALYs were calculated for each participant over a mean 
observation time of 4.1 years, considering the noninformative censoring 
structure of the follow-up study. Linear regression models were used to estimate 
the loss in (quality-unadjusted) life-years and QALYs between patients with and 
without diabetes, and generalized additive models were used to analyze the 
nonlinear association with age. The cross-sectional and longitudinal association 
with quality of life (QOL) and QOL change and the impact on mortality were 
analyzed to enhance the understanding of the observed results.
RESULTS: Diabetes was associated with a reduced QOL at baseline 
(cross-sectional: β = -0.069; P < 0.001), but not with a significant 
longitudinal QOL change. Mortality in patients with diabetes was increased 
(hazard ratio = 1.68; P < 0.005). This resulted in a loss of 0.14 life-years (P 
= 0.003) and 0.37 QALYs (P < 0.001). Results from generalized additive models 
indicated that the burden of diabetes is less pronounced in older subjects.
CONCLUSIONS: The application of the proposed approach provides 
confounder-adjusted BOD estimates for the studied time horizon and can be used 
to compare the BOD across different chronic conditions. Curative efforts are 
needed to diminish the substantial diabetes-related QALY gap.

BACKGROUND: Disease management programs (DMPs) for cardiovascular risk (CVR) and 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are increasingly implemented in The 
Netherlands to improve care and patient's health behavior.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to provide evidence about the (cost-) 
effectiveness of Dutch DMPs as implemented in daily practice.
METHODS: We compared the physical activity, smoking status, quality-adjusted 
life-years, and yearly costs per patient between the most and the least 
comprehensive DMPs in four disease categories: primary CVR prevention, secondary 
CVR prevention, both types of CVR prevention, and COPD (N = 1034). Propensity 
score matching increased comparability between DMPs. A 2-year cost-utility 
analysis was performed from the health care and societal perspectives. 
Sensitivity analysis was performed to estimate the impact of DMP development and 
implementation costs on cost-effectiveness.
RESULTS: Patients in the most comprehensive DMPs increased their physical 
activity more (except for primary CVR prevention) and had higher smoking 
cessation rates. The incremental QALYs ranged from -0.032 to 0.038 across all 
diseases. From a societal perspective, the most comprehensive DMPs decreased 
costs in primary CVR prevention (certainty 57%), secondary CVR prevention 
(certainty 88%), and both types of CVR prevention (certainty 98%). Moreover, the 
implementation of comprehensive DMPs led to QALY gains in secondary CVR 
prevention (certainty 92%) and COPD (certainty 69%).
CONCLUSIONS: The most comprehensive DMPs for CVR and COPD have the potential to 
be cost saving, effective, or cost-effective compared with the least 
comprehensive DMPs. The challenge for Dutch stakeholders is to find the optimal 
mixture of interventions that is most suited for each target group.

A Quality-Adjusted Life-Year Measure for Multiple Sclerosis: Developing a 
Patient-Reported Health State Classification System for a Multiple 
Sclerosis-Specific Preference-Based Measure.

BACKGROUND: Increasingly, generic preference-based measures of health-related 
quality of life (HRQOL) are used to estimate quality-adjusted life-years to 
inform resource allocation decisions. Evidence suggests that generic measures 
may not be appropriate for multiple sclerosis (MS).
OBJECTIVES: To report the first stage in the development of an MS-specific 
preference-based measure to quantify the impact of MS and its treatment: 
deriving a health state classification system, which is amenable to valuation, 
from the 29-item Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale (MSIS-29), a widely used 
patient-reported outcome measure in MS.
METHODS: The dimensional structure of the MSIS-29 was determined using factor 
analysis and a conceptual framework of HRQOL in MS. Item performance was 
assessed, using Rasch analysis and psychometric criteria, to enable the 
selection of one item to represent each dimension of HRQOL covered by the 
MSIS-29. Analysis was undertaken using a sample (N = 529) from a longitudinal 
study of people with MS. Results were validated by repeating the analysis with a 
second sample (N = 528).
RESULTS: Factor analysis confirmed the two-subscale structure of the MSIS-29. 
Both subscales covered several conceptually independent dimensions of HRQOL. 
Following Rasch and psychometric analysis, an eight-dimensional classification 
system named the MSIS-8D was developed. Each dimension was represented by one 
item with four response levels.
CONCLUSIONS: Combining factor analysis with conceptual mapping, and Rasch 
analysis with psychometric criteria, provides a valid method of constructing a 
classification system for an MS-specific preference-based measure. The next 
stage is to obtain preference weights so that the measure can be used in studies 
investigating MS.

OBJECTIVES: To compare benefit-risk assessment (BRA) methods for determining 
whether and when sufficient evidence exists to indicate that one drug is 
favorable over another in prospective monitoring.
METHODS: We simulated prospective monitoring of a new drug (A) versus an 
alternative drug (B) with respect to two beneficial and three harmful outcomes. 
We generated data for 1000 iterations of six scenarios and applied four BRA 
metrics: number needed to treat and number needed to harm (NNT|NNH), incremental 
net benefit (INB) with maximum acceptable risk, INB with relative-value-adjusted 
life-years, and INB with quality-adjusted life-years. We determined the 
proportion of iterations in which the 99% confidence interval for each metric 
included and excluded the null and we calculated mean time to alerting.
RESULTS: With no true difference in any outcome between drugs A and B, the 
proportion of iterations including the null was lowest for INB with 
relative-value-adjusted life-years (64%) and highest for INB with 
quality-adjusted life-years (76%). When drug A was more effective and the drugs 
were equally safe, all metrics indicated net favorability of A in more than 70% 
of the iterations. When drug A was safer than drug B, NNT|NNH had the highest 
proportion of iterations indicating net favorability of drug A (65%). Mean time 
to alerting was similar among methods across the six scenarios.
CONCLUSIONS: BRA metrics can be useful for identifying net favorability when 
applied to prospective monitoring of a new drug versus an alternative drug. 
INB-based approaches similarly outperform unweighted NNT|NNH approaches. Time to 
alerting was similar across approaches.

BACKGROUND: Benefit-risk assessment (BRA) methods can combine measures of 
benefits and risks into a single value.
OBJECTIVES: To examine BRA metrics for prospective monitoring of new drugs in 
electronic health care data.
METHODS: Using two electronic health care databases, we emulated prospective 
monitoring of three drugs (rofecoxib vs. nonselective nonsteroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs, prasugrel vs. clopidogrel, and denosumab vs. 
bisphosphonates) using a sequential propensity score-matched cohort design. We 
applied four BRA metrics: number needed to treat and number needed to harm; 
incremental net benefit (INB) with maximum acceptable risk; INB with 
relative-value-adjusted life-years; and INB with quality-adjusted life-years 
(QALYs). We determined whether and when the bootstrapped 99% confidence interval 
(CI) for each metric excluded zero, indicating net favorability of one drug over 
the other.
RESULTS: For rofecoxib, all four metrics yielded a negative value, suggesting 
net favorability of nonselective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs over 
rofecoxib, and the 99% CI for all but the number needed to treat and number 
needed to harm excluded the null during follow-up. For prasugrel, only the 99% 
CI for INB-QALY excluded the null, but trends in values over time were similar 
across the four metrics, suggesting overall net favorability of prasugrel versus 
clopidogrel. The 99% CI for INB-relative-value-adjusted life-years and INB-QALY 
excluded the null in the denosumab example, suggesting net favorability of 
denosumab over bisphosphonates.
CONCLUSIONS: Prospective benefit-risk monitoring can be used to determine net 
favorability of a new drug in electronic health care data. In three examples, 
existing BRA metrics produced qualitatively similar results but differed with 
respect to alert generation.

BACKGROUND: Previous economic evaluations compared specific chemotherapy agents 
using input parameters from clinical trials and resource utilization costs. 
Cost-effectiveness of treatment groups (drug classes) using community-level 
effectiveness and cost data, however, has not been assessed for elderly patients 
with breast cancer.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of chemotherapy regimens by age and 
disease stage under "real-world" conditions for patients with breast cancer.
METHODS: The Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results-Medicare data were used 
to identify patients with breast cancer with American Joint Committee on Cancer 
stage I/II/IIIa, hormone receptor-negative (estrogen receptor-negative and 
progesterone receptor-negative) patients from 1992 to 2009. Patients were 
categorized into three adjuvant treatment groups: 1) no chemotherapy, 2) 
anthracycline, and 3) non-anthracycline-based chemotherapy. Median life-years 
and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were measured using Kaplan-Meier 
analysis and were evaluated against average total health care costs (2013 US 
dollars).
RESULTS: A total of 4575 patients (propensity score-matched) were included for 
the primary analysis. The anthracycline group experienced 12.05 QALYs and mean 
total health care costs of $119,055, resulting in an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio of $7,688 per QALY gained as compared with the no 
chemotherapy group (QALYs 7.81; average health care cost $86,383). The 
non-anthracycline-based group was dominated by the anthracycline group with 
lower QALYs (9.56) and higher health care costs ($122,791). Base-case results 
were found to be consistent with the best-case and worst-case scenarios for 
utility assignments. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios varied by age group 
(range $3,790-$90,405 per QALY gained).
CONCLUSIONS: Anthracycline-based chemotherapy was found cost-effective for 
elderly patients with early stage (stage I, II, IIIa) breast cancer considering 
the US threshold of $100,000 per QALY. Further research may be needed to 
characterize differential effects across age groups.

BACKGROUND: Previous economic evaluations of cinacalcet in patients with 
secondary hyperparathyroidism (sHPT) relied on the combination of surrogate end 
points in clinical trials and epidemiologic studies.
OBJECTIVES: The objective was to conduct an economic evaluation of cinacalcet on 
the basis of the EValuation Of Cinacalcet HCl Therapy to Lower CardioVascular 
Events (EVOLVE) trial from a US payer perspective.
METHODS: We developed a semi-Markov model to assess the cost-effectiveness of 
cinacalcet in addition to conventional therapy, compared with conventional 
therapy alone, in patients with moderate-to-severe sHPT receiving hemodialysis. 
We used treatment effect estimates from the unadjusted intent-to-treat (ITT) 
analysis and prespecified covariate-adjusted ITT analysis as our main analyses. 
We assessed model sensitivity to variations in individual inputs and overall 
decision uncertainty through probabilistic sensitivity analyses.
RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for cinacalcet was 
$61,705 per life-year and $79,562 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained 
using the covariate-adjusted ITT analysis. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis 
suggested a 73.2% chance of the ICER being below a willingness-to-pay threshold 
of $100,000. Treatment effects from unadjusted ITT analysis yielded an ICER of 
$115,876 per QALY. The model was most sensitive to the treatment effect on 
mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: In the unadjusted ITT analysis, cinacalcet does not represent a 
cost- effective use of health care resources when applying a willingness-to-pay 
threshold of $100,000 per QALY. When using the covariate-adjusted ITT treatment 
effect, which represents the least biased estimate, however, cinacalcet is a 
cost-effective therapy for patients with moderate-to-severe sHPT on 
hemodialysis.

BACKGROUND: Decision makers often need to simultaneously consider multiple 
criteria or outcomes when deciding whether to adopt new health interventions.
OBJECTIVES: Using decision analysis within the context of cervical cancer 
screening in Norway, we aimed to aid decision makers in identifying a subset of 
relevant strategies that are simultaneously efficient, feasible, and optimal.
METHODS: We developed an age-stratified probabilistic decision tree model 
following a cohort of women attending primary screening through one screening 
round. We enumerated detected precancers (i.e., cervical intraepithelial 
neoplasia of grade 2 or more severe (CIN2+)), colposcopies performed, and 
monetary costs associated with 10 alternative triage algorithms for women with 
abnormal cytology results. As efficiency metrics, we calculated incremental 
cost-effectiveness, and harm-benefit, ratios, defined as the additional costs, 
or the additional number of colposcopies, per additional CIN2+ detected. We 
estimated capacity requirements and uncertainty surrounding which strategy is 
optimal according to the decision rule, involving willingness to pay (monetary 
or resources consumed per added benefit).
RESULTS: For ages 25 to 33 years, we eliminated four strategies that did not 
fall on either efficiency frontier, while one strategy was efficient with 
respect to both efficiency metrics. Compared with current practice in Norway, 
two strategies detected more precancers at lower monetary costs, but some 
required more colposcopies. Similar results were found for women aged 34 to 69 
years.
CONCLUSIONS: Improving the effectiveness and efficiency of cervical cancer 
screening may necessitate additional resources. Although efficient and feasible, 
both society and individuals must specify their willingness to accept the 
additional resources and perceived harms required to increase effectiveness 
before a strategy can be considered optimal.

OBJECTIVES: To systematically review the choice of comparator strategies in 
cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs) of human papillomavirus testing in cervical 
screening.
METHODS: The PubMed, Web of Knowledge, and Scopus databases were searched to 
identify eligible model-based CEAs of cervical screening programs using human 
papillomavirus testing. The eligible CEAs were reviewed to investigate what 
screening strategies were chosen for analysis and how this choice might have 
influenced estimates of the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). 
Selected examples from the reviewed studies are presented to illustrate how the 
omission of relevant comparators might influence estimates of screening 
cost-effectiveness.
RESULTS: The search identified 30 eligible CEAs. The omission of relevant 
comparator strategies appears likely in 18 studies. The ICER estimates in these 
cases are probably lower than would be estimated had more comparators been 
included. Five of the 30 studies restricted relevant comparator strategies to 
sensitivity analyses or other subanalyses not part of the principal base-case 
analysis. Such exclusion of relevant strategies from the base-case analysis can 
result in cost-ineffective strategies being identified as cost-effective.
CONCLUSIONS: Many of the CEAs reviewed appear to include insufficient comparator 
strategies. In particular, they omit strategies with relatively long screening 
intervals. Omitting relevant comparators matters particularly if it leads to the 
underestimation of ICERs for strategies around the cost-effectiveness threshold 
because these strategies are the most policy relevant from the CEA perspective. 
Consequently, such CEAs may not be providing the best possible policy guidance 
and lead to the mistaken adoption of cost-ineffective screening strategies.

BACKGROUND: Although chest-compression-only cardiopulmonary resuscitation 
(CCO-CPR) is recommended for lay bystanders, fatigue is easily produced during 
CCO-CPR. If CCO-CPR can be performed at a lower intensity of exercise, higher 
resistance to fatigue is expected. Since chest compression is considered to be a 
submaximal upper body exercise in a steady rhythm and since the unit of load for 
chest compression is expressed as work rate, we investigated the possibility 
that peak work rate of the upper body determines the level of exercise intensity 
during CCO-CPR.
METHODS: Twelve sedentary individuals (group Se), 11 rugby players (group R), 
and 11 swimmers (group Sw) performed 10-min CCO-CPR, and heart rate (HR) and 
rating of perceived exertion (RPE) were measured as indices of exercise 
intensity. Multiple linear regression analysis was carried out to assess 
potential relationships of upper body weight, peak lumbar extension force, peak 
work rate, and peak oxygen uptake recorded during arm-crank exercise with HR and 
RPE during CCO-CPR.
RESULTS: Values of peak work rate during arm-crank exercise (Peak WR-AC) in 
group Se, group R, and group Sw were 108 ± 12, 139 ± 27, and 146 ± 24 watts, 
respectively. Values of the latter two groups were significantly higher than the 
value of group Se (group R, P < 0.01; group Sw, P < 0.001). HR during CCO-CPR 
increased with time, reaching 127.8 ± 17.6, 114.8 ± 16.5, and 118.1 ± 14.2 bpm 
at the 10th minute in group Se, group R, and group Sw, respectively. On the 
other hand, RPE during CCO-CPR increased with time, reaching 16.4 ± 1.4, 
15.4 ± 1.7, and 13.9 ± 2.2 at the 10th minute in group Se, group R, and group 
Sw, respectively. Multiple linear regression analysis showed that only peak 
WR-AC affects both HR and RPE at the 10th minute of CCO-CPR (HR, r = -0.458; 
P < 0.01; RPE, r = -0.384, P < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: The degree of exercise intensity during CCO-CPR is lower in 
individuals who have a higher peak work rate of the upper body.

The government of Trinidad and Tobago considers that the enjoyment of the 
highest attainable level of health is a basic right of every citizen and has a 
goal to achieve health for all by 2020. Thus it lays emphasis on caring and 
assures standards of excellence to promote, protect and improve the health 
status of the people of Trinidad and Tobago. To achieve these goals it is very 
important to increase curative services as well as preventive services in the 
country. In view of this situation there is a need to overcome the challenges 
the public health by involving community and individuals and self-reliance to 
achieve Health for all at 2020. Community participation is one of the domains of 
community capacity building in a small island country. It is one of the 
mechanisms to empower people to take part in community development. In this 
paper, the nature, the dimensions of community participation, and its role and 
scope in implementation of different components of primary health care have been 
described. The health services in public and remedial care have been discussed. 
The article highlights some important milestone achievements in the health 
sector in Trinidad.

Macrobrachium nipponense is an economically and nutritionally important species 
threatened by ambient superfluous nitrite. De novo RNA-Seq was used to explore 
the molecular mechanism in M. nipponense exposed to the acute nitrite stress 
(26.05 mg/L nitrite-N) for 24 h and the chronic nitrite stress (1.38 mg/L 
nitrite-N) for 28 d A total of 175.13 million reads were obtained and assembled 
into 58,871 unigenes with an average length of 1028.7 bp and N50 of 1294 bp. 
Under the acute and chronic nitrite stress trials, 2824 and 2610 unigenes were 
significantly expressed. In GO analysis and KEGG pathway analysis, 30 pathways 
were significantly different between the two treatments while four pathways were 
in common and the markedly altered pathways were divided into four sections as 
immunity, metabolism, cell and others. The immunity section revealing the 
different depth of immunity provoked by nitrite stress contained the most 
pathways including the important pathways as phagosome, folate biosynthesis, 
glycerolipid metabolism, glycine, serine and threonine metabolism, amino sugar 
and nucleotide sugar metabolism under the acute nitrite stress, and lysosome, 
alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism, arginine and proline metabolism 
under the chronic nitrite stress. This is the first report of responses of 
M. nipponense under acute and chronic nitrite stress through de novo 
transcriptome sequencing on the transcriptome level. The results of 
transcriptome analysis improve our understanding on the underlying molecular 
mechanisms coping with nitrite stress in crustacean species.

PURPOSE: Different health state utility (HSU) instruments produce different 
utilities for the same individuals, thereby compromising the intended 
comparability of economic evaluations of health care interventions. When 
developing crosswalks, previous studies have indicated nonlinear relationships. 
This paper inquires into the degree of nonlinearity across the four most widely 
used HSU-instruments and proposes exchange rates that differ depending on the 
severity levels of the health state utility scale.
METHODS: Overall, 7933 respondents from six countries, 1760 in a non-diagnosed 
healthy group and 6173 in seven disease groups, reported their health states 
using four different instruments: EQ-5D-5L, SF-6D, HUI-3 and 15D. Quantile 
regressions investigate the degree of nonlinear relationships between these 
instruments. To compare the instruments across different disease severities, we 
split the health state utility scale into utility intervals with 0.2 successive 
decrements in utility starting from perfect health at 1.00. Exchange rates (ERs) 
are calculated as the mean utility difference between two utility intervals on 
one HSU-instrument divided by the difference in mean utility on another 
HSU-instrument.
RESULTS: Quantile regressions reveal significant nonlinear relationships across 
all four HSU-instruments. The degrees of nonlinearities differ, with a maximum 
degree of difference in the coefficients along the health state utility scale of 
3.34 when SF-6D is regressed on EQ-5D. At the lower end of the health state 
utility scale, the exchange rate from SF-6D to EQ-5D is 2.11, whilst at the 
upper end it is 0.38.
CONCLUSION: Comparisons at different utility levels illustrate the fallacy of 
using linear functions as crosswalks between HSU-instruments. The existence of 
nonlinear relationships between different HSU-instruments suggests that 
level-specific exchange rates should be used when converting a change in utility 
on the instrument used, onto a corresponding utility change had another 
instrument been used. Accounting for nonlinearities will increase the validity 
of the comparison for decision makers when faced with a choice between 
interventions whose calculations of QALY gains have been based on different 
HSU-instruments.

BACKGROUND: Tyrosine-kinase inhibitors improve overall survival in patients with 
chronic myeloid leukaemia in chronic phase (CML-CP). Survival compared with the 
general population by age, response, and type of tyrosine-kinase inhibitor is 
not known. With use of data from trials of tyrosine kinase inhibitors, we 
compared overall survival in patients with newly diagnosed CML-CP to that of 
general population.
METHODS: In this cohort analysis, we included data from patients with CML-CP 
enrolled in six consecutive or parallel prospective clinical trials of 
tyrosine-kinase inhibitors at a single institution from July 30, 2000, to Sept 
17, 2012. We analysed data for response and survival with the Kaplan-Meier 
method. For estimated overall survival in the general population, we obtained 
data from national vital statistics reports and matched to patients with CML-CP 
by age, sex, ethnicity, and year at diagnosis. We assessed numbers and causes of 
death within 1 year of beginning treatment by age group and by response to 
therapy. We then did univariate analysis and multivariate analysis to 
investigate factors associated with survival probability.
FINDINGS: Our analysis included 483 patients, 271 received imatinib, 105 
received nilotinib, and 107 received dasatinib. Most patients were younger than 
65 years, and no patients were older than 85 years. Median follow-up was 99·4 
months (IQR 44·9-121·6), by which time 53 (11%) patients had died. The most 
common causes of death were progression to advanced disease stage, including 
complications of stem-cell transplantation (17 [4%] patients), secondary 
malignancies (nine [2%] patients), and cardiovascular causes (nine [2%] 
patients). 5-year overall survival in patients with CML-CP decreased in older 
age categories. For the whole population of patients with CML-CP, 5-year 
survival was only slightly lower than that of the matched general population 
(relative survival 94·7% [95% 92·1-97·4]). Individuals of all ages with a report 
of complete cytogenetic response to treatment or deeper within 1 year had a 
5-year survival similar to that of the general population.
INTERPRETATION: In the era of treatment with tyrosine-kinase inhibitors, 
patients diagnosed with CML-CP can expect a 5-year survival that is only 
slightly lower than that of the general population. With access to 
tyrosine-kinase inhibitors, most patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia could 
enjoy a near normal life expectancy.
