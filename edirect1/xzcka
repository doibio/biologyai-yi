BACKGROUND: Both re-emergence of pertussis outbreak among adolescents/adults and 
recent approval of the extended use of DTaP vaccine for boosting 
adolescents/adults against pertussis in Japan, have raised the possibility of 
using aP-containing vaccine in pregnant women to protect neonates and 
unvaccinated infants. There is a need, therefore, to evaluate the value for 
money of such possibility.
METHODS: We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of conducting antepartum maternal 
vaccination (AMV) strategy in Japan. Considering the duration of vaccine 
effectiveness for infant (single year) and for mother (multiple years), the 
decision tree model and Markov model was adapted for infant and mother, 
respectively. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) compared with current 
no AMV strategy from societal perspective were calculated. The transition 
probabilities, utility weights to estimate quality-adjusted life year (QALY), 
and disease treatment costs were either calculated or extracted from literature. 
Costs per vaccination was assumed at ¥6000/US$54.5. Markov model for mothers 
with one-year cycle runs up to year four after vaccination, based on the waning 
of vaccine effectiveness. Infant who survived from pertussis was assumed to live 
until to his/her life expectancy.
RESULTS: AMV strategy reduces disease treatment costs, while the reduction 
cannot offset the vaccination cost. Incremental QALYs were at 0.0002802, among 
them 79.5% were from infants, and others from mothers. ICER was 
¥9,149,317/US$83,176 per QALY gained. One-way sensitivity analyses identified 
that the incidence rate and costs per shot were the two main key variables to 
impact the ICER.
CONCLUSION: We found that vaccinating pregnant women with aP-containing vaccine 
to prevent neonatal and unvaccinated infants from pertussis-associated disease 
in Japan can be cost-effective from societal perspective, under the 
WHO-suggested "cost-effective" criteria (1 to 3 times of GDP). Pertussis is 
expected be designated as a notifiable disease in 2018, re-analysis should be 
conducted when straightforward incidence data is available.

Life expectancy of patients treated for brain tumors has lengthened due to the 
therapeutic improvements. Cognitive impairment has been described following 
brain radiotherapy, but the mechanisms leading to this adverse event remain 
mostly unknown. Technical evolutions aim at enhancing the therapeutic ratio. 
Sparing of the healthy tissues has been improved using various approaches; 
however, few dose constraints have been established regarding brain structures 
associated with cognitive functions. The aims of this literature review are to 
report the main brain areas involved in cognitive adverse effects induced by 
radiotherapy as described in literature, to better understand brain 
radiosensitivity and to describe potential future improvements.

BACKGROUND: Acutely occurring, life-threatening side-effects of antipsychotic 
drugs might contribute to the reduced life expectancy observed in patients with 
severe mental disorders. We aimed to assess this hypothesis by doing a 
systematic review and meta-analysis of deaths occurring in placebo-controlled 
trials of antipsychotic drugs.
METHODS: For this systematic review and meta-analysis, we included randomised 
controlled trials comparing second-generation antipsychotics with placebo across 
several diagnostic categories. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane CENTRAL, 
BIOSIS, PsycINFO, PubMed, ClinicalTrials.gov, and WHO ICTRP from inception (the 
last search was done on Jan 21, 2017), and contacted pharmaceutical companies 
and regulatory authorities for further eligible trials. We examined mortality 
from any cause (the primary outcome) and mortality from natural causes, suicide, 
and other non-natural causes. We synthesised the results with odds ratios (ORs) 
in a common-effects meta-analysis. We investigated the effects of age, 
diagnostic category, sex, study duration, antipsychotic drug used, drug dose, 
and polypharmacy in subgroup and meta-regression analyses. This study is 
registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42016033930.
FINDINGS: We identified 596 randomised controlled trials published between 1978 
and 2017, comprising 108 747 participants. 352 studies (comprising 84 988 
participants) with mortality data available constituted the main dataset for our 
meta-analysis. 207 (0·4%) deaths were reported in 53 804 patients on an 
antipsychotic drug and 99 (0·3%) deaths in 31 184 patients on placebo. 300 (85%) 
of 352 trials were 13 weeks (3 months) or shorter in duration (median 6 weeks; 
IQR 4-10). We found no evidence of a difference between antipsychotic drugs and 
placebo in mortality by any cause (OR 1·19; 95% CI 0·93-1·53), from natural 
causes (1·29; 0·85-1·94), from suicide (1·15; 0·47-2·81), and from other 
non-natural causes (1·55; 0·66-3·63). Most subgroup and meta-regression analyses 
did not indicate any important effect moderators. The exceptions were increased 
mortality in patients with dementia (OR 1·56; 95% CI 1·10-2·21), in elderly 
patients (1·38; 1·01-1·89), in aripiprazole-treated patients (2·20; 1·00-4·86), 
and in studies with a higher proportion of women (regression coefficient 0·025; 
95% credible interval 0·010-0·040). However, the effects in elderly patients, 
aripiprazole-treated patients, and women were mainly based on the included 
dementia trials. For patients with schizophrenia there was no evidence of an 
increased mortality risk (OR 0·69; 95% CI 0·35-1·35).
INTERPRETATION: Overall, and for the main indication of schizophrenia, there is 
no evidence from randomised trials that antipsychotic drugs increase mortality. 
However, vulnerable populations (particularly patients with dementia) might be 
at increased risk. This meta-analysis could only address acute treatment effects 
leading to death in the short-term, and not long-term effects of antipsychotic 
drugs on mortality.

The aims of this study were as follows: to estimate the mortality and years of 
life lost, assessed by disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), due to breast 
cancer attributable to physical inactivity in Brazilian women; to compare the 
estimates attributable to physical inactivity and to other modifiable risk 
factors; and to analyse the temporal evolution of these estimates within 
Brazilian states over 25 years (1990-2015), compared with global estimates. 
Databases from the Global Burden of Disease Study for Brazil, Brazilian states, 
and other parts of the world were used. Physical inactivity has contributed to a 
substantial number of deaths (1990: 875; 2015: 2,075) and DALYs (1990: 28,089; 
2015: 60,585) due to breast cancer in Brazil. Physical inactivity was 
responsible for more deaths and DALYs (~12.0%) due to breast cancer than other 
modifiable risk factors (~5.0%). The Brazilian states with better socioeconomic 
indicators had higher age-standardized rates of mortality and morbidity due to 
breast cancer attributable to physical inactivity. From 1990 to 2015, mortality 
due to breast cancer attributable to physical inactivity increased in Brazil 
(0.77%; 95%U.I.: 0.27-1.47) and decreased (-2.84%; 95%U.I.: -4.35 - -0.10) 
around the world. These findings support the promotion of physical activity in 
the Brazilian female population to prevent and manage breast cancer.

INTRODUCTION TO THE PROBLEM: Though declining in the recent decades, high-energy 
musculoskeletal trauma remains a major contributor to the burden of disease in 
high-income countries (HICs). However, due to limitations in the available body 
of the literature, evaluation of this burden is challenging. The purpose of this 
review is to assess: (1) the current epidemiologic data on the surgical burden 
of high-energy musculoskeletal trauma in HICs; (2) the current data on the 
economic impact of high-energy musculoskeletal trauma; and (3) potential 
strategies for addressing gaps in musculoskeletal trauma care for the future.
REVIEW OF LITERATURE: In 2016, mortality from road traffic injuries (RTIs) 
between the ages of 15-49 was reported to be 9.5% (9.0-9.9) in high-income 
countries, accounting for approximately 255 million DALYs. While RTIs do not 
fully capture the extent of high-energy musculoskeletal trauma, as the most 
common mechanism, they serve as a useful indicator of the impact on the surgical 
and economic burden. In 2009, the global losses related to RTIs were estimated 
to be 518 billion USD, costing governments between 1 and 3% of their gross 
domestic product (GDP). In the last decade, both the total direct per-person 
healthcare cost and the incremental direct per-person costs for those with a 
musculoskeletal injury in the USA rose 75 and 58%, respectively.
FUTURE DIRECTIONS: ADDRESSING THE GAPS: While its impact is large, research on 
musculoskeletal conditions, including high-energy trauma, is underfunded 
compared to other fields of medicine. An increased awareness among policy makers 
and healthcare professionals of the importance of care for the high-energy 
musculoskeletal trauma patient is critical. Full implementation of trauma 
systems is imperative, and metrics such as the ICD-DALY have the potential to 
allow for real-time evaluation of prevention and treatment programs aimed to 
reduce injury-related morbidity and mortality. The dearth in knowledge in 
optimal and cost-effective post-acute care for high-energy musculoskeletal 
trauma is a reason for concern, especially since almost half of the costs are 
attributed to this phase of care. Multidisciplinary rehabilitation teams as part 
of a musculoskeletal trauma system may be of interest to decrease further the 
long-term negative effects and the economic burden of high-energy 
musculoskeletal trauma.

Women and men with alcohol dependence and very high risk drinking level (VHRDL; 
defined as drinking >60 or 100 g of ethanol per day, respectively) experience 
severe health consequences; however, data on the number of these individuals and 
their health risks are limited. This study estimated (1) the prevalence of VHRDL 
in 13 European Union (EU) countries among people 15-65 years of age, (2) the 
risk of disease and injury occurrence associated with VHRDL, (3) the proportion 
of deaths in nine EU countries attributable to VHRDL and (4) the life expectancy 
of people in France with VHRDL. Prevalence estimates of VHRDL were based on data 
obtained from clinical trials and the Global Information System on Alcohol and 
Health. The risk of disease and injury occurrence was estimated using 
microsimulations. Population-attributable fractions (PAFs) were estimated using 
a Levin-based methodology. The estimated prevalence of VHRDL in the 13 EU 
countries examined was 0.74-0.85 percent, with a disease and injury occurrence 
risk of 13.5 per 100 people with VHRDL per year. For the nine EU countries 
examined, VHRDL caused 53.6 percent of all liver cirrhosis, 43.8 percent of all 
pancreatitis and 41.1 percent of oral cavity and pharyngeal cancers (all other 
PAFs were below 30 percent). Applying these PAFs to French mortality data 
resulted in a life expectancy of 47-61 years for people with VHRDL-21-35 years 
less than the general population. These results indicate that the health burdens 
of VHRDL are potentially large, and interventions targeting VHRDL should be 
considered when formulating public health policies.

Medication development for alcohol relapse prevention or reduction of 
consumption is highly challenging due to methodological issues of 
pharmacotherapy trials. Existing approved medications are only modestly 
effective with many patients failing to benefit from these therapies. Therefore, 
there is a pressing need for other effective treatments with a different 
mechanism of action, especially for patients with very high (VH) drinking risk 
levels (DRL) because this is the most severely affected population of alcohol 
use disorder patients. Life expectancy of alcohol-dependent patients with a VH 
DRL is reduced by 22 years compared with the general population and 
approximately 90 000 alcohol-dependent subjects with a VH DRL die prematurely 
each year in the EU (Rehm et al. ). A promising new medication for this 
population is sodium oxybate, a compound that acts on GABAB receptors and 
extrasynaptic GABAA receptors resulting in alcohol-mimetic effects. In this 
article, a European expert group of alcohol researchers and clinicians 
summarizes data (a) from published trials, (b) from two new-as yet 
unpublished-large clinical trials (GATE 2 (n = 314) and SMO032 (n = 496), (c) 
from post hoc subgroup analyses of patients with different WHO-defined DRLs and 
(d) from multiple meta-analyses. These data provide convergent evidence that 
sodium oxybate is effective especially in a subgroup of alcohol-dependent 
patients with VH DRLs. Depending on the study, abstinence rates are increased up 
to 34 percent compared with placebo with risk ratios up to 6.8 in favor of 
sodium oxybate treatment. These convergent data are supported by the clinical 
use of sodium oxybate in Austria and Italy for more than 25 years. Sodium 
oxybate is the sodium salt of γ-hydroxybutyric acid that is also used as a 
recreational (street) drug suggestive of abuse potential. However, a 
pharmacovigilance database of more than 260 000 alcohol-dependent patients 
treated with sodium oxybate reported very few adverse side effects and only few 
cases of abuse. We therefore conclude that sodium oxybate is an effective, 
well-tolerated and safe treatment for withdrawal and relapse prevention 
treatment, especially in alcohol-dependent patients with VH DRL.

Older adults who have survived cancer experience significantly more falls 
compared with healthy adults. Adult cancer survivors may also have a lower 
balance function than healthy adults. We examined muscle strength and balance 
function among 19 cancer survivors and 14 healthy subjects. The mean age of the 
cancer survivors was 51.5 ± 11.2 years; 6 men and 13 women. Cancer diagnoses 
included breast cancer, retroperitoneal sarcoma, acute leukemia, lung cancer, 
colorectal cancer, thyroid cancer, Ewing's sarcoma, and tongue cancer. The mean 
age of healthy subjects was 47.4 ± 14 years; 3 men, 11 women. Muscle strength 
was assessed using hand grip and knee extensor strength tests. Balance function 
was evaluated using the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test, and body sway was tested 
using a force platform. No significant differences were found with respect to 
right and left grip strength or right and left knee extension strength between 
the 2 groups. A significantly higher TUG time was observed in cancer survivors 
than in healthy subjects ( P < .05). With eyes open, the area of the center of 
pressure was significantly larger in cancer survivors than in healthy subjects ( 
P < .05). Similarly, the length per area was significantly lower both with eyes 
open and closed for cancer survivors than for healthy subjects ( P < .05). TUG 
was significantly correlated with muscle strength in both groups ( P < .05). 
However, no body sway parameters were related to muscle strength in either 
group. Cancer survivors had lower balance function that might not have been 
related to muscle strength. Cancer survivors should be evaluated for balance 
function as there is a potential for impairment. The findings of this study will 
be relevant for planning the prevention of falls for cancer survivors.

INTRODUCTION: Globally, prosecutions for non-disclosure, exposure or 
transmission of HIV frequently relate to sexual activity, biting, or spitting. 
This includes instances in which no harm was intended, HIV transmission did not 
occur, and HIV transmission was extremely unlikely or not possible. This 
suggests prosecutions are not always guided by the best available scientific and 
medical evidence.
DISCUSSION: Twenty scientists from regions across the world developed this 
Expert Consensus Statement to address the use of HIV science by the criminal 
justice system. A detailed analysis of the best available scientific and medical 
research data on HIV transmission, treatment effectiveness and forensic 
phylogenetic evidence was performed and described so it may be better understood 
in criminal law contexts. Description of the possibility of HIV transmission was 
limited to acts most often at issue in criminal cases. The possibility of HIV 
transmission during a single, specific act was positioned along a continuum of 
risk, noting that the possibility of HIV transmission varies according to a 
range of intersecting factors including viral load, condom use, and other risk 
reduction practices. Current evidence suggests the possibility of HIV 
transmission during a single episode of sex, biting or spitting ranges from no 
possibility to low possibility. Further research considered the positive health 
impact of modern antiretroviral therapies that have improved the life expectancy 
of most people living with HIV to a point similar to their HIV-negative 
counterparts, transforming HIV infection into a chronic, manageable health 
condition. Lastly, consideration of the use of scientific evidence in court 
found that phylogenetic analysis alone cannot prove beyond reasonable doubt that 
one person infected another although it can be used to exonerate a defendant.
CONCLUSIONS: The application of up-to-date scientific evidence in criminal cases 
has the potential to limit unjust prosecutions and convictions. The authors 
recommend that caution be exercised when considering prosecution, and encourage 
governments and those working in legal and judicial systems to pay close 
attention to the significant advances in HIV science that have occurred over the 
last three decades to ensure current scientific knowledge informs application of 
the law in cases related to HIV.

Metformin is the first line therapy of type 2 diabetics, but continued reduction 
of their life expectancy warrants further investigation into alternative 
treatment strategies. This study reports on the combinational use of metformin 
with aspalathin, a C-glucosyl dihydrochalcone with known glucose lowering and 
antioxidant properties, as an effective hypoglycemic therapy in a type 2 
diabetic (db/db) mouse model. When tested as a monotherapy, a low dose of 
aspalathin (13 mg/kg) showed no effect, while a high dose (130 mg/kg) has 
already displayed a better potential than metformin in protecting against 
diabetes associated symptoms in db/db mice. Thus, it remains of interest to 
determine whether this dihydrochalcone can improve the efficacy of metformin. 
The results showed that this combination therapy was more effective than the use 
of metformin as a monotherapy in ameliorating diabetes associated symptoms, 
including abnormal raised fasting plasma glucose levels, impaired glucose 
tolerance, as well as excessively increased body weights and fat content. The 
treated mice also had reduced food and water consumption when compared to 
untreated controls, with a pronounced effect evident in the last week of 
treatment. Therefore, this study supports further investigations into the 
ameliorative effect of combination therapy of metformin and aspalathin against 
diabetes associated symptoms.

SMA is an inherited disease that leads to loss of motor function and ambulation 
and a reduced life expectancy. We have been working to develop orally 
administrated, systemically distributed small molecules to increase levels of 
functional SMN protein. Compound 2 was the first SMN2 splicing modifier tested 
in clinical trials in healthy volunteers and SMA patients. It was safe and well 
tolerated and increased SMN protein levels up to 2-fold in patients. 
Nevertheless, its development was stopped as a precautionary measure because 
retinal toxicity was observed in cynomolgus monkeys after chronic daily oral 
dosing (39 weeks) at exposures in excess of those investigated in patients. 
Herein, we describe the discovery of 1 (risdiplam, RG7916, RO7034067) that 
focused on thorough pharmacology, DMPK and safety characterization and 
optimization. This compound is undergoing pivotal clinical trials and is a 
promising medicine for the treatment of patients in all ages and stages with 
SMA.

PURPOSE: Despite gains in life expectancy between 1992 to 2012, large 
disparities in life expectancy continue to exist in the United States between 
subgroups of the population. This study aimed to develop detailed life tables 
(LT), accounting for mortality differences by race, geography, and 
socio-economic status (SES), to more accurately measure relative cancer survival 
and life expectancy patterns in the United States.
METHODS: We estimated an extensive set of County SES-LT by fitting Poisson 
regression models to deaths and population counts for U.S. counties by age, 
year, gender, race, ethnicity and county-level SES index. We reported life 
expectancy patterns and evaluated the impact of the County SES-LT on relative 
survival using data from the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) 
Program cancer registries.
RESULTS: Between 1992 and 2012, the largest increase in life expectancy was 
among black men (6.8 years), however there were still large geographical 
differences. Life expectancy was highest for Asian or Pacific Islanders (API), 
and lowest for American Indians and Alaskan Natives (AIAN). In 2010, life 
expectancies by state ranged from 73 to 82 years for white males, 78 to 86 years 
for white females, 66 to 75 for black males, and 75 to 81 for black females. 
Comparisons of relative survival using National LT and the new County SES-LT 
showed that relative survival using County SES-LT improved relative survival 
estimates for some demographic groups, particularly in low and high SES areas, 
among Hispanics and AIAN, and among older male cancer patients. Relative 
survival using County SES-LT was 7.3% and 6.7% survival points closer to 
cause-specific survival compared to the National LT relative survival for AIAN 
and Hispanic cancer patients diagnosed between ages 75 and 84 years, 
respectively. Importantly, the County SES-LT relative survival estimates were 
higher in lower SES areas and lower in higher SES areas, reducing differences in 
relative survival comparisons.
CONCLUSION: The use of these new socio-economic life tables (County SES-LT) can 
provide more accurate estimates of relative survival, improve comparisons of 
relative survival among registries, better illustrate disparities and cancer 
control efforts, and should be used as default for cancer relative survival 
using U.S. data.

BACKGROUND: Pulmonary nodule guidelines do not indicate how to individualize 
follow-up according to comorbidity or life expectancy.
OBJECTIVES: To characterize comorbidity and life expectancy in older veterans 
with incidental, symptom-detected, or screen-detected nodules in 2008-09 
compared to 2013-14. To determine the impact of these patient factors on 
four-year nodule follow-up among the 2008-09 subgroup.
DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.
SETTING: Urban Veterans Affairs Medical Center.
PARTICIPANTS: 243 veterans age ≥65 with newly diagnosed pulmonary nodules in 
2008-09 (followed for four years through 2012 or 2013) and 446 older veterans 
diagnosed in 2013-14.
MEASUREMENTS: The primary outcome was receipt of any follow-up nodule imaging 
and/or biopsy within four years after nodule diagnosis. Primary predictor 
variables included age, Charlson-Deyo Comorbidity Index (CCI), and life 
expectancy. Favorable life expectancy was defined as age 65-74 with CCI 0 while 
limited life expectancy was defined as age ≥85 with CCI ≥1 or age ≥65 with CCI 
≥4. Interaction by nodule size was also examined.
RESULTS: From 2008-09 to 2013-14, the number of older veterans diagnosed with 
new pulmonary nodules almost doubled, including among those with severe 
comorbidity and limited life expectancy. Overall among the 2008-09 subgroup, 
receipt of nodule follow-up decreased with increasing comorbidity (CCI ≥4 versus 
0: adjusted RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.39-0.95) with a trend towards decreased follow-up 
among those with limited life expectancy (adjusted RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.48-1.01). 
However, we detected an interaction effect with nodule size such that 
comorbidity and life expectancy were associated with decreased follow-up only 
among those with nodules ≤6 mm.
CONCLUSIONS: We found some individualization of pulmonary nodule follow-up 
according to comorbidity and life expectancy in older veterans with smaller 
nodules only. As increased imaging detects nodules in sicker patients, 
guidelines need to be more explicit about how to best incorporate comorbidity 
and life expectancy to maximize benefits and minimize harms for patients with 
nodules of all sizes.

BACKGROUND: The burden of pneumococcal disease in China is high, and a 13-valent 
pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) recently received regulatory approval and 
is available to Chinese infants. PCV13 protects against the most prevalent 
serotypes causing invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) in China, but will not 
provide full societal benefits until made broadly available through a national 
immunization program (NIP).
OBJECTIVE: To estimate clinical and economic benefits of introducing PCV13 into 
a NIP in China using local cost estimates and accounting for variability in 
vaccine uptake and indirect (herd protection) effects.
METHODS: We developed a population model to estimate the effect of PCV13 
introduction in China. Modeled health states included meningitis, bacteremia, 
pneumonia (PNE), acute otitis media, death and sequelae, and no disease. Direct 
healthcare costs and disease incidence data for IPD and PNE were derived from 
the China Health Insurance and Research Association database; all other 
parameters were derived from published literature. We estimated total disease 
cases and associated costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and deaths for 
three scenarios from a Chinese Payer Perspective: (1) direct effects only, (2) 
direct+indirect effects for IPD only, and (3) direct+indirect effects for IPD 
and inpatient PNE.
RESULTS: Scenario (1) resulted in 370.3 thousand QALYs gained and 12.8 thousand 
deaths avoided versus no vaccination. In scenarios (2) and (3), the PCV13 NIP 
gained 383.2 thousand and 3,580 thousand QALYs, and avoided 13.1 thousand and 
147.5 thousand deaths versus no vaccination, respectively. In all three 
scenarios, the vaccination cost was offset by cost reductions from prevented 
disease yielding net costs of ¥29,362.32 million, ¥29,334.29 million, and 
¥13,524.72 million, respectively. All resulting incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratios fell below a 2x China GDP cost-effectiveness threshold across a range of 
potential vaccine prices.
DISCUSSION: Initiation of a PCV13 NIP in China incurs large upfront costs but is 
good value for money, and is likely to prevent substantial cases of disease 
among children and non-vaccinated individuals.

BACKGROUND: The place of disease-modifying osteoarthritis drugs (DMOADs) and 
intra-articular hyaluronic acid (IAHA) in the therapeutic arsenal for knee 
osteoarthritis (OA) remains uncertain. Indeed, these treatments have 
demonstrated symptomatic efficacy but no efficacy for disease modification.
OBJECTIVE: This report reviews the cost effectiveness of IAHA and DMOADs used in 
the treatment of knee OA.
METHODS: A systematic literature search of the MEDLINE, Scopus, EMBASE and 
Cochrane databases was performed independently by two rheumatologists who used 
the same predefined eligibility criteria to identify relevant articles. Papers 
without abstracts and in languages other than English or French were excluded. 
Extracted costs were annualised and converted to 2015 euros (€) using the 
Consumer Price Index of the relevant countries and the 2013 Purchasing Power 
Parities between these countries and the European Union average.
RESULTS: A total of 95 abstracts were selected, and 13 articles were considered 
for the review: nine articles on IAHA and four on DMOADs. Only one article 
directly compared different IAHA compounds. Articles showed substantial 
heterogeneity in methodological approaches. The incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratios (ICERs) ranged from €4000 to €57,550 and from €240 to €53,225 per 
quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained for DMOADs and IAHA, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: This review highlights substantial heterogeneity between studies, 
ranging from a cost saving (or dominating) position to very high ICERs, far 
above the acceptability threshold of €50,000/QALY. Additional research is needed 
to determine reliable and robust ICER estimates for knee OA therapies.

Mineral-associated microbes drive many critical soil processes, including 
mineral weathering, soil aggregation and cycling of mineral-sorbed organic 
matter. To investigate the interactions between soil minerals and microbes in 
the rhizosphere, we incubated three types of minerals (ferrihydrite, kaolinite 
and quartz) and a native soil mineral fraction near roots of a common 
Californian annual grass, Avena barbata, growing in its resident soil. We 
followed microbial colonization of these minerals for up to 2.5 months - the 
plant's lifespan. Bacteria and fungi that colonized mineral surfaces during this 
experiment differed across mineral types and differed from those in the 
background soil, implying that microbial colonization was the result of 
processes in addition to passive movement with water to mineral surfaces. Null 
model analysis revealed that dispersal limitation was a dominant factor 
structuring mineral-associated microbial communities for all mineral types. Once 
bacteria arrived at a mineral surface, capacity for rapid growth appeared 
important, as ribosomal copy number was significantly correlated with relative 
enrichment on minerals. Glomeromycota (a phylum associated with arbuscular 
mycorrhizal fungi) appeared to preferentially associate with ferrihydrite 
surfaces. The mechanisms enabling the colonization of soil minerals may be 
foundational in shaping the overall soil microbiome composition and development 
of persistent organic matter in soils.

BACKGROUND: Insecticide resistance management (IRM) practices that improve the 
sustainability of agricultural production systems are developed, but few studies 
address the challenges with their implementation and success rates of adoption. 
This study examined the effectiveness of a voluntary, extension-based program to 
increase grower adoption of IRM practices for onion thrips (Thrips tabaci) in 
onion. The program sought to increase the use of two important IRM practices: 
rotating classes of insecticides during the growing season and applying 
insecticides following an action threshold.
RESULTS: Onion growers (n = 17) increased their adoption of both IRM practices 
over the 3-year study. Growers increased use of insecticide class rotation from 
76% to 100% and use of the action threshold for determining whether to apply 
insecticides from 57% to 82%. Growers who always used action thresholds 
successfully controlled onion thrips infestations, applied significantly fewer 
insecticide applications (one to four fewer applications) and spent $148/ha less 
on insecticides compared with growers who rarely used the action threshold. 
Growers who regularly used action thresholds and rotated insecticide classes did 
so because they were primarily concerned about insecticide resistance 
development in thrips populations.
CONCLUSION: Implementation of the IRM education program was successful, as 
adoption rates of both practices increased within 3 years. Growers were 
surprisingly most receptive to adopting these practices to mitigate insecticide 
resistance as opposed to saving money. Developing extension-based programs that 
involve regular and interactive meetings with growers may significantly increase 
the adoption of IRM and related integrated pest management tactics. © 2018
