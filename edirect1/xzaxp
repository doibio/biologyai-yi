STUDY OBJECTIVE: To compare the impact of extended wakefulness (i.e., 
sleepiness) and prolonged driving (i.e., fatigue) at the wheel in simulated 
versus real-life driving conditions.
DESIGN: Participants drove on an INRETS-MSIS SIM2 simulator in a research 
laboratory or an open French highway during 3 nocturnal driving sessions. A 
dose-response design of duration of nocturnal driving was used: a 2 h short 
driving session (3-5 AM), a 4 h intermediate driving session (1-5 AM) and an 8 h 
long driving session (9 PM-5 AM).
PARTICIPANTS: Two groups of healthy male drivers (20 for simulated driving and 
14 drivers for real driving; mean age±SD=22.3±1.6 years), free of sleep 
disorders.
MEASUREMENTS: Number of inappropriate line crossings, self-rated fatigue and 
sleepiness were recorded in the last hour of driving sessions to control the 
effects of prior waking time and time of day.
RESULTS: Compared to the daytime reference session, both simulated and real 
driving performance were affected by a short nocturnal driving session (P<.05 
and P<.001, respectively). Extension of nocturnal driving duration affected 
simulated performance nonlinearly and more severely than that of real driving 
(P<.001). Compared to the daytime reference session, short nocturnal simulated 
and real driving sessions increased self-perceived fatigue and sleepiness. Real 
and simulated driving conditions had an identical impact on fatigue and 
sleepiness during extended periods of nocturnal driving.
CONCLUSIONS: In healthy subjects, the INRETS-MSIS SIM2 simulator appropriately 
measures driving impairment in terms of inappropriate line crossings related to 
extended wakefulness but has limitations to measure the impact of extended 
driving on drivers' performance.

Renal replacement therapy in geriatric end-stage renal disease patients: a 
clinical approach.

The number of geriatric patients on dialysis is increasing. This is due to 
demographic factors, a wider acceptance of elderly patients on dialysis, and an 
earlier start of dialysis in this patient group. Recent studies have questioned 
the effect of dialysis on quality of life in elderly patients with severe 
comorbidity and showed limited survival in this specific patient group. 
Therefore, the decision whether or not to start dialysis may be a difficult one 
for both the clinician and patient. Risk scores can be of help in facilitating 
shared decision making, but not as a tool to withhold dialysis. However, in the 
elderly patient with severe comorbidity, conservative care can sometimes be a 
reasonable alternative to dialysis. In the process of shared decision making, a 
balance should be pursued between life expectancy and quality of life. If the 
decision to initiate dialysis is taken, choices have to be made regarding 
dialysis modality and treatment prescription. If adequate support is provided, 
assisted peritoneal dialysis can be an acceptable alternative to hemodialysis. 
Care for the elderly with end-stage renal disease should be undertaken by a 
multidisciplinary team with special dedication to a multidimensional approach in 
this population.

Author information:
(1)National Spinal Cord Injury Statistical Center, Department of Physical 
Medicine and Rehabilitation, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL 
35233-7330, USA.

STUDY DESIGN: Review supplemented by inception cohort.
OBJECTIVES: To review trends in the incidence, prevalence, demographic 
characteristics, etiology, injury severity and selected treatment outcomes of 
traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI).
SETTING: International review and US model systems cohort.
METHODS: An extensive literature review was conducted to identify all relevant 
studies of descriptive epidemiology of traumatic SCI. This review was 
supplemented by analyses of trends in US SCI epidemiology that are reflected in 
the National Spinal Cord Injury Statistical Center and Shriners Hospital Spinal 
Cord Injury databases.
RESULTS: Incidence and prevalence of traumatic SCI in the United States are 
higher than in the rest of the world. Average age at injury is increasing in 
accordance with an aging general population at risk. The proportion of cervical 
injuries is increasing, whereas the proportion of neurologically complete 
injuries is decreasing. Injuries due to falls are increasing. Recent gains in 
general population life expectancy are not reflected in the SCI population. 
Treatment outcomes are changing as a result of increasing age and changes in US 
health care delivery.
CONCLUSION: Within the prevalent population, the percentage of elderly persons 
will not increase meaningfully until the high mortality rates observed among 
older persons significantly improve. Those who reach older ages will typically 
have incomplete and/or lower level injuries, and will have relatively high 
degrees of independence and overall good health.

Antioxidants can extend lifespan of Brachionus manjavacas (Rotifera), but only 
in a few combinations.

Animal cells are protected from oxidative damage by an antioxidant network 
operating as a coordinated system, with strong synergistic interactions. 
Lifespan studies with whole animals are expensive and laborious, so there has 
been little investigation of which antioxidant interactions might be useful for 
life extension. Animals in the phylum Rotifera are particularly promising models 
for aging studies because they are small (0.1-1 mm), have short, two-week 
lifespan, display typical patterns of animal aging, and have well characterized, 
easy to measure phenotypes of aging and senescence. One class of interventions 
that has consistently produced significant rotifer life extension is 
antioxidants. Although the mechanism of antioxidant effects on animal aging 
remains controversial, the ability of some antioxidant supplements to extend 
rotifer lifespan was unequivocal. We found that exposing rotifers to certain 
combinations of antioxidant supplements can produce up to about 20% longer 
lifespan, but that most antioxidants have no effect. We performed life table 
tests with 20 single antioxidants and none yielded significant rotifer life 
extension. We tested 60 two-way combinations of selected antioxidants and only 
seven (12%) produced significant rotifer life extension. None of the 20 three- 
and four-way antioxidant combinations tested yielded significant rotifer life 
extension. These observations suggest that dietary exposure of antioxidants can 
extend rotifer lifespan, but most antioxidants do not. We observed significant 
rotifer life extension only when antioxidants were paired with trolox, N-acetyl 
cysteine, L: -carnosine, or EUK-8. This illustrates that antioxidant treatments 
capable of rotifer life extension are patchily distributed in the parameter 
space, so large regions must be searched to find them. It furthermore 
underscores the value of the rotifer model to conduct rapid, facile life table 
experiments with many treatments, which makes such a search feasible. Although 
some antioxidants extended rotifer lifespan, they likely did so by another 
mechanism than direct antioxidation.

Sciences, Mashhad, Iran. shariatim@mums.ac.ir

Fungal contamination derived from prosthetic substances is not common, although 
because of the following reasons the number of cases has increased in the recent 
years: increased life expectancy, and therefore a greater number of surgical 
candidates; higher rates of underlying diseases, which are accompanied by 
immunosuppressive disorders that can cause a higher susceptibility for such 
infections. Most reports of infection in breast prosthesis and tissue expanders 
are bacterial infections, and fungi cases are still rare. Hereby, we report a 
case of Aspergillus colonization in a tissue expander of a patient with an old 
burn scar. This fungal growth inside saline-filled tissue expander was 
asymptomatic and not troublesome. It also caused no changes in the patient's 
treatment course.

Kyphoplasty and intra-operative radiotheray, combination of kyphoplasty and 
intra-operative radiation for spinal metastases: technical feasibility of a 
novel approach.

Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany. rene.schmidt@gmx.de

PURPOSE: To evaluate whether this new method is clinically applicable after 
theoretical and cadaver testing.
METHODS: The incidence of spinal metastases requiring therapy is increasing, due 
to enhanced life expectancy. Due to results from studies with epidural 
compression a combined surgical and radiation therapy is often chosen. Minimal 
invasive cement augmentation is an increasingly used technique, due to fast pain 
relief and immediate stabilisation. On the other hand, stereotactic radiosurgery 
is considered to provide a more durable response and better local disease 
control than conventional radiotherapy with the application of higher doses. 
Therefore the combination of cement stabilisation and simultaneous 
intra-operative radiation with immediate stabilisation and high-dose radiation 
could be an interesting therapeutic option. The results of a clinical 
feasibility study are presented.
RESULTS: 17 patients could be treated with the new method. In two patients (10%) 
intra-operative radiation could not be applied. No surgical interventions for 
complications were required.
CONCLUSIONS: Summarizing Kypho-IORT is technically feasible with an 
intra-operative risk profile comparable to sole kyphoplasty and a shorter 
treatment time and hospitalisation for the patients compared to conventional 
multifraction radiation. Radiation could not be applied in 10% of cases due to 
technical difficulties. The results of this feasibility study permit further 
evaluation of this new technique by a dose escalation study which is currently 
in preparation.

BACKGROUND: The interactions between rising life expectancy, morbidity and 
development of disability warrant interdisciplinary research on functional 
disability, health promotion and prevention as well as healthcare provision for 
older people. Therefore, the interdisciplinary LUCAS (Longitudinal Urban Cohort 
Ageing Study) research consortium of university and non-university institutions 
was established and is coordinated by the research department of the 
Albertinen-Haus at the University of Hamburg. The aim is to study particular 
aspects of functional competence, the changes with ageing, to detect 
pre-clinical signs of functional decline and to address questions on how to 
maintain functional competence and to prevent adverse outcomes. The research 
questions have their origin in problems of practical healthcare provision in the 
different settings of communities, hospitals and nursing homes. The articles of 
LUCAS subprojects report selected results from the first project phase 
(2007-2010) which was funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and 
Research (BMBF) (Research program"Health in the elderly").).
METHODS: The LUCAS subprojects 1-7 applied a true cohort study design with 
embedded randomized controlled intervention studies and cross-sectional studies 
for comparative purposes and to prepare intervention studies to be performed in 
the second project phase.
CONCLUSIONS: Results from the first project phase provided new instruments to 
screen and to assess functional competence in older people (population-based 
screening). In the second project phase these will be evaluated according to 
practicability and usefulness. Furthermore, parts of the results will be used by 
the health reporting system in Hamburg and for intervention studies performed by 
LUCAS subprojects during the second project phase (LUCAS II).

Prognostic factors for recurrence of papillary thyroid carcinoma in the lymph 
nodes, lung, and bone: analysis of 5,768 patients with average 10-year 
follow-up.

BACKGROUND: Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) frequently recurs to the lymph 
nodes, which may not be fatal immediately but is a stressor for physicians and 
patients. Recurrence to the distant organs, although less frequent, is often 
life-threatening, and the lung and bone are organs to which PTC is likely to 
recur. In the present study we investigated factors predicting recurrence of PTC 
to the lymph nodes, lung, and bone in a large number of patients undergoing 
long-term follow-up.
METHODS: A total of 5,768 PTC patients (608 males and 5,159 females) without 
distant metastasis at diagnosis who underwent initial surgery between 1987 and 
2004 in Kuma Hospital were enrolled in this study. The postoperative follow-up 
ranged from 12 to 280 months, and was 129 months (10.8 years) on average.
RESULTS: To date, node, lung, and bone recurrences have been detected in 389 
(7%), 118 (2%), and 33 patients (0.6%), respectively, and 57 patients (1%) have 
died of PTC. We examined the prognostic significance of the tumor size (T), 
extrathyroid extension (Ex), age 55 years or older (Age), male gender (Gender), 
clinical node metastasis (N), and extranodal tumor extension (LN-Ex) for each 
outcome on multivariate analysis. Age, Gender, T > 2 cm, N, and Ex were 
independent predictors of lymph node recurrence. Age, Ex, T > 2 cm, and N were 
independent prognostic factors for lung recurrence. Ex, T > 4 cm, and N 
independently predicted bone recurrence. Of these, N ≥ 3 cm had the strongest 
prognostic value for lymph node, lung, and bone recurrences. In contrast, Age 
was the strongest predictor for carcinoma death. LN-Ex also had a prognostic 
value for carcinoma death, although it was not a predictor of carcinoma 
recurrence. Ex, N ≥ 3 cm, and T > 2 cm also had a prognostic impact on carcinoma 
death.
CONCLUSIONS: Large lymph node metastasis showed a strong prognostic impact on 
carcinoma recurrence not only to the lymph nodes but also to the lung and bone, 
and carcinoma death. Extrathyroid extension also independently predicted these 
recurrences and carcinoma death, although hazard ratios were lower than for 
large node metastasis. Age 55 years or older, in contrast, was the strongest 
predictor of carcinoma death. Extranodal tumor extension did not independently 
affect recurrence, but it had prognostic significance for carcinoma death. These 
findings suggest that recurring PTC lesions of older patients and/or extranodal 
tumor extensions are difficult to control and very progressive.

Choosing life or limb. Improving survival in the multi-complex diabetic foot 
patient.

Trust, Derby, UK. fgame@futu.co.uk

Over two decades ago, the St. Vincent Declaration set a 50% reduction of 
lower-limb amputations as a principal target for patients with diabetes. During 
this time, enormous strides have been taken in our understanding of diabetic 
foot disease, the complexities of wound healing and the organization of care to 
prevent what is one of the most feared complications of the disease. Despite 
this, we are aware that worldwide, we have not achieved the target set in 1989, 
with current estimations being that a limb is lost to diabetes somewhere in the 
world every 30 s. However, it has to be remembered that amputation is a 
treatment and not a disease, and it is indeed a treatment usually prescribed at 
the end of a long chronic illness. It is well known that patients whose disease 
is severe enough for amputation to be considered frequently have other 
complications of their diabetes, cardiovascular and peripheral vascular diseases 
and end-stage renal disease, in particular. The life expectancy of the patients 
is therefore frequently reduced, and their functional status poor even prior to 
the intervention of surgeons. Just as the functional status of the patients is 
often a contra-indication to other disease treatments, chemotherapy for some 
cancers, for example, then we should be considering carefully whether we should 
be removing limbs from patients whose functional and medical status will not 
improve significantly as a result. Equally, there may be patients who may 
benefit from an early amputation and ambulation with a prosthesis.

Women aged >75 years are not invited for mammographic screening; if diagnosed 
with breast cancer, due to their anticipated short-life expectancy, they are 
expected to die of other causes. To describe the breast cancer health problem in 
women aged >75 years, we estimated breast cancer incidence in this age group and 
the risk of breast cancer death in patients diagnosed after 75 years of age in 
Nijmegen, the Netherlands. Our findings demonstrate that in this age group, 3.3% 
of the women will be diagnosed with breast cancer, and that one in three of 
these incident cases die of this disease. These patients could have benefited 
from continued screening.

Intervention programs aimed at preventing tobacco use among youth have been 
shown to be effective in curbing tobacco use onset and progression. However, the 
effects of even very successful tobacco prevention programs may not always 
impress policy-makers and lay audiences. Economic analysis potentially 
strengthens the case. In this paper, we evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a 
youth tobacco use prevention program which has been translated and implemented 
in India, a developing country. Although programs like these are inexpensive to 
implement in the USA, they are even less expensive in India due to low labor 
costs. Our results show that the costs per quality-adjusted life-year added, due 
to averted smoking, was $2057, even without including averted medical costs. If 
we ignore student time, cost-effectiveness improves by roughly 10%. To put the 
cost-effectiveness of this smoking prevention program into context, it is over 
24 times more cost-effective than dialysis in the USA, which costs $50,000 for a 
life-year.

Carolina, United States of America. david.p.holland@duke.edu

BACKGROUND: The optimal treatment for latent multiple-drug resistant 
tuberculosis infection remains unclear. In anticipation of future clinical 
trials, we modeled the expected performance of six potential regimens for 
treatment of latent multiple-drug resistant tuberculosis.
METHODS: A computerized Markov model to analyze the total cost of treatment for 
six different regimens: Pyrazinamide/ethambutol, moxifloxacin monotherapy, 
moxifloxacin/pyrazinamide, moxifloxacin/ethambutol, moxifloxacin/ethionamide, 
and moxifloxacin/PA-824. Efficacy estimates were extrapolated from mouse models 
and examined over a wide range of assumptions.
RESULTS: In the base-case, moxifloxacin monotherapy was the lowest cost 
strategy, but moxifloxacin/ethambutol was cost-effective at an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio of $21,252 per quality-adjusted life-year. Both 
pyrazinamide-containing regimens were dominated due to their toxicity. A 
hypothetical regimen of low toxicity and even modest efficacy was cost-effective 
compared to "no treatment."
CONCLUSION: In our model, moxifloxacin/ethambutol was the preferred treatment 
strategy under a wide range of assumptions; pyrazinamide-containing regimens 
fared poorly because of high rates of toxicity. Although more data are needed on 
efficacy of treatments for latent MDR-TB infection, data on toxicity and 
treatment discontinuation, which are easier to obtain, could have a substantial 
impact on public health practice.

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether different utilities for prostate cancer 
screening outcomes for couples, and husbands and wives separately, lead to 
incongruent screening recommendations.
METHODS: We evaluated survey results of 168 married couples from three family 
practice centers in Texas, USA. Utilities for eight adverse outcomes of prostate 
cancer screening and treatment were assessed using the time trade-off method. We 
assessed utilities separately for each partner and jointly for each couple. 
Using a previously published decision-analytic model of prostate cancer 
screening, we input the husband's age (starting point) and utilities for 
outcomes from the husband's, wife's, and couple's perspectives (to adjust for 
quality of life). Both group-level and individualized models were run. We also 
asked husbands (and wives) if they intended to be screened (or have their 
husbands screened) for prostate cancer in the future.
RESULTS: Husbands' lower tolerance for adverse outcomes (lower utilities) was 
associated with lower quality-adjusted life expectancy (than their wives) for 
the choice of screening versus not screening. Depending on the perspective, 48 
husbands (28.6%), 89 wives (53.0%), and 58 couples (34.5%) preferred screening 
in the individual decision-analytic models. Comparing the three perspectives, 
agreement in model recommendations was greatest between the husbands and the 
couples (82.1%), intermediate between the wives and couples (63.7%), and lowest 
between the husbands and wives (55.4%). Using group-aggregated utilities in the 
decision-analytic model tended to mask the variation in recommended strategies 
amongst individuals. There was no relationship between screening preferences 
from the model and the husbands' and wives' reported desire for screening, as 
the majority of subjects wanted screening.
CONCLUSIONS: Discordant health preferences may yield conflicting recommendations 
for prostate cancer screening. The results have broad implications for informed 
healthcare decision making for couples.

Portal hypertension is a hemodynamic abnormality that involves a high risk of 
disability as well as a reduced life expectancy in patients with cirrhosis. 
Progress in the knowledge of pathophysiology of portal hypertension has opened a 
new perspective for different pharmacological approaches. In this context, the 
pleiotropic actions of statins on endothelial cell function have emerged as new 
options to reduce portal pressure levels by targeting multiple molecular 
pathways involved in hepatic vascular homeostasis. We highlight how statins may 
target some molecular pathways involved in the pathophysiology of portal 
hypertension and how these drugs may correct impaired hepatic vascular tone.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Much of the progress in improving potency outcomes after 
radical prostatectomy has been achieved due to a better visualization of the 
neurovascular bundle responsible for erectile function. We review the current 
literature evaluating the existing imaging modalities to image the neurovascular 
bundle around the prostate pre, intra, and postoperatively, thereby enabling 
development of surgical techniques for better preservation of nerve function.
RECENT FINDINGS: Imaging modalities like multiphoton microscopy, optical 
coherence tomography, Coherent anti-Raman spectroscopy, exogenous fluoroscopy 
using prostate-specific membrane antigen, and so on have led to a better 
appreciation of the neurovascular bundle, thus encouraging novel techniques in 
nerve preservation during radical prostatectomy.
SUMMARY: In an age of heightened patient expectations and increasing life 
expectancy, better visualization of the neurovascular bundle around the prostate 
using novel imaging modalities may provide breakthroughs in improving potency

The paucity of valid and reliable instruments designed to measure end-of-life 
experiences limits advanced dementia and palliative care research. Two 
end-of-life in dementia (EOLD) scales that evaluate the experiences of severely 
cognitively impaired persons and their health care proxies (HCP) have been 
developed: (1) symptom management (SM) and (2) satisfaction with care (SWC). The 
aim of this study was to examine the sensitivity of the EOLD scales in detecting 
significant differences in clinically relevant outcomes in nursing home 
residents with advanced dementia. The SM-EOLD scale was sensitive to detecting 
changes in comfort among residents with pneumonia, pain, dyspnea, and receiving 
burdensome interventions. The SWC-EOLD scale was sensitive to detecting changes 
in HCP satisfaction with the care of residents when addressing whether the 
health care provider spent >15 minutes discussing the resident's advanced care 
planning, whether the physician counseled about the resident's live expectancy, 
whether the resident resided in a special care unit, and whether the physician 
counseled possible resident health problems. This study extends the psychometric 
properties of the EOLD scales by showing the sensitivity to clinically 
meaningful change in these scales to specific outcomes related to end-of-life 
care and quality of life among residents with end-stage advanced dementia and 
their HCPs.

AIMS: To determine the 12-month, societal cost-effectiveness of involving 
urinary incontinence (UI) nurse specialists in primary care compared to 
care-as-usual by general practitioners (GPs).
METHODS: From 2005 until 2008 an economic evaluation was performed alongside a 
pragmatic multicenter randomized controlled trial comparing UI patients 
receiving care by nurse specialists with patients receiving care-as-usual by GPs 
in the Netherlands. One hundred eighty-six adult patients with stress, urgency, 
or mixed UI were randomly allocated to the intervention and 198 to 
care-as-usual; they were followed for 1 year. Main outcome measures were Quality 
Adjusted Life Year (QALY(societal) ) based on societal preferences for health 
outcomes (EuroQol-5D), QALY(patient) based on patient preferences for health 
outcomes (EuroQol VAS), and Incontinence Severity weighted Life Year (ISLY) 
based on patient-reported severity and impact of UI (ICIQ-UI SF). Health care 
resource use, patient and family costs, and productivity costs were assessed. 
Data were collected by three monthly questionnaires. Incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated. Uncertainty was assessed using 
bootstrap simulation, and the expected value of perfect information was 
calculated (EVPI).
RESULTS: Compared to care-as-usual, nurse specialist involvement costs € 
16,742/QALY(societal) gained. Both QALY(patient) and ISLY yield slightly more 
favorable cost-effectiveness results. At a threshold of € 40,000/QALY(societal,) 
the probability that the intervention is cost-effective is 58%. The EVPI amounts 
to € 78 million.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on these results, we recommend adopting the nurse specialist 
intervention in primary care, while conducting more research through careful 
monitoring of the effectiveness and costs of the intervention in routine 
practice.

Does inadequate sleep play a role in vulnerability to obesity?

Knutson KL(1).

Chicago, Illinois 60622, USA. kknutson@medicine.bsd.uchicago.edu

The prevalence of obesity is increasing rapidly worldwide, which is cause for 
concern because obesity increases the risk of cardiovascular disease and 
diabetes, reduces life expectancy, and impairs quality of life. A better 
understanding of the risk factors for obesity is therefore a critical global 
health concern, and human biologists can play an important role in identifying 
these risk factors in various populations. The objective of this review is to 
present the evidence that inadequate sleep may be a novel risk factor associated 
with increased vulnerability to obesity and associated cardiometabolic disease. 
Experimental studies have found that short-term sleep restriction is associated 
with impaired glucose metabolism, dysregulation of appetite, and increased blood 
pressure. Observational studies have observed cross-sectional associations 
between short sleep duration (generally <6 h per night) and increased body mass 
index or obesity, prevalent diabetes, and prevalent hypertension. Some studies 
also reported an association between self-reported long sleep duration 
(generally >8 h per night) and cardiometabolic disease. A few prospective 
studies have found a significant increased risk of weight gain, incident 
diabetes, and incident hypertension associated with inadequate sleep. Given the 
potential link between inadequate sleep and obesity, a critical next step is to 
identify the social, cultural, and environmental determinants of sleep, which 
would help to identify vulnerable populations. Future human biology research 
should consider variation in sleep characteristics among different populations 
and determine whether the associations between sleep and obesity observed in 
Western populations persist elsewhere.

The N-terminus of FILIA forms an atypical KH domain with a unique extension 
involved in interaction with RNA.

FILIA is a member of the recently identified oocyte/embryo expressed gene family 
in eutherian mammals, which is characterized by containing an N-terminal 
atypical KH domain. Here we report the structure of the N-terminal fragment of 
FILIA (FILIA-N), which represents the first reported three-dimensional structure 
of a KH domain in the oocyte/embryo expressed gene family of proteins. The 
structure of FILIA-N revealed a unique N-terminal extension beyond the canonical 
KH region, which plays important roles in interaction with RNA. By co-incubation 
with the lysates of mice ovaries, FILIA and FILIA-N could sequester specific RNA 
components, supporting the critical roles of FILIA in regulation of RNA 
transcripts during mouse oogenesis and early embryogenesis.

Lung transplantation is a life-saving treatment option in carefully selected 
patients with end-stage lung disease. Life expectancy after this form of 
treatment has progressively increased with a current survival of 90% after 1 
year, 70% after 5 years, and 50% after 10 years in experienced centers. Apart 
from a survival benefit, this treatment aims to improve the quality of life. 
Bilateral lung transplantation is the type of operation that is performed most 
frequently because of superior survival results, especially when chronic 
rejection develops. Single lung transplantation is now reserved for older 
patients with pulmonary fibrosis. Heart-lung transplantation is rarely done, 
only in patients with Eisenmenger's syndrome or complex congenital heart 
disease. Belgium is one of the world leaders in terms of number of deceased 
organ donors with a lung recovery rate of about 35%. With a total of 8.3 lung 
transplants per million population, Belgium is currently the number 1 in the 
world. The procedure nowadays is performed in 4 University Hospitals 
(UA-KUL-ULB-UCL) in the country. Between 1983 and 2009, nearly 1000 proedures 
were performed. The most common indication was emphysema, followed by cystic 
fibrosis, pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary arterial hypertension, and Eisenmenger's 
syndrome. Further application of this treatment option is hampered by several 
problems such as donor organ shortage, primary graft dysfunction, chronic 
rejection presenting as bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome, and side effect of 
chronic immunosuppression. In the Laboratory for Experimental Thoracic Surgery 
and the Laboratory for Pneumology at the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, 
intensive research is done by our group looking for new methods to increase the 
lung donor pool and to prevent and to treat chronic rejection.

BACKGROUND: Australian mortality rates are higher in regional and remote areas 
than in major cities. The degree to which this is driven by variation in 
modifiable risk factors is unknown.
METHODS: We applied a risk prediction equation incorporating smoking, 
cholesterol and blood pressure to a national, population based survey to project 
all-causes mortality risk by geographic region. We then modelled life 
expectancies at different levels of mortality risk by geographic region using a 
risk percentiles model. Finally we set high values of each risk factor to a 
target level and modelled the subsequent shift in the population to lower levels 
of mortality risk and longer life expectancy.
RESULTS: Survival is poorer in both Inner Regional and Outer Regional/Remote 
areas compared to Major Cities for men and women at both high and low levels of 
predicted mortality risk. For men smoking, high cholesterol and high systolic 
blood pressure were each associated with the mortality difference between Major 
Cities and Outer Regional/Remote areas--accounting for 21.4%, 20.3% and 7.7% of 
the difference respectively. For women smoking and high cholesterol accounted 
for 29.4% and 24.0% of the difference respectively but high blood pressure did 
not contribute to the observed mortality differences. The three risk factors 
taken together accounted for 45.4% (men) and 35.6% (women) of the mortality 
difference. The contribution of risk factors to the corresponding differences 
for inner regional areas was smaller, with only high cholesterol and smoking 
contributing to the difference in men-- accounting for 8.8% and 6.3% 
respectively-- and only smoking contributing to the difference in 
women--accounting for 12.3%.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that health intervention programs aimed at 
smoking, blood pressure and total cholesterol could have a substantial impact on 
mortality inequities for Outer Regional/Remote areas.

Enriching caregiving practices foster the course and outcome of child 
development. This study examined 2 developmentally significant domains of 
positive caregiving-cognitive and socioemotional-in more than 127,000 families 
with under-5 year children from 28 developing countries. Mothers varied widely 
in cognitive and socioemotional caregiving and engaged in more socioemotional 
than cognitive activities. More than half of mothers played with their children 
and took them outside, but only a third or fewer read books and told stories to 
their children. The GDP of countries related to caregiving after controlling for 
life expectancy and education. The majority of mothers report that they do not 
leave their under-5s alone. Policy and intervention recommendations are 
elaborated.

Childrearing discipline and violence in developing countries.

Lansford JE(1), Deater-Deckard K.

Author information:

The present study examined the prevalence and country-level correlates of 11 
responses to children's behavior, including nonviolent discipline, psychological 
aggression, and physical violence, as well as endorsement of the use of physical 
punishment, in 24 countries using data from 30,470 families with 2- to 
4-year-old children that participated in UNICEF's Multiple Indicator Cluster 
Survey. The prevalence of each response varied widely across countries, as did 
the amount of variance accounted for by country in relation to each response. 
Country-level indicators of life expectancy, educational attainment, and 
economic well-being were related to several responses to children's behavior. 
Country-level factors are widely related to parents' methods of teaching 
children good behavior and responding to misbehavior.

Housing quality and access to material and learning resources within the home 
environment in developing countries.

Bradley RH(1), Putnick DL.

Author information:

This study examined home environment conditions (housing quality, material 
resources, formal and informal learning materials) and their relations with the 
Human Development Index (HDI) in 28 developing countries. Home environment 
conditions in these countries varied widely. The quality of housing and 
availability of material resources at home were consistently tied to HDI; the 
availability of formal and informal learning materials a little less so. Gross 
domestic product (GDP) tended to show a stronger independent relation with 
housing quality and material resources than life expectancy and education. 
Formal learning resources were independently related to the GDP and education 
indices, and informal learning resources were not independently related to any 
constituent indices of the overall HDI.

A test of independence of discounting from quality of life.

Attema AE(1), Brouwer WB.

Author information:

Netherlands. attema@bmg.eur.nl

The quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) model assumes quality and quantity of 
life can be multiplied into a single index and requires quality and quantity to 
be mutually independent, which need not hold empirically. This paper proposes a 
new test for measuring independence of utility of life duration from quality of 
life in a riskless setting. We use a large representative sample of Dutch 
citizens and include two health states generally considered better than dead 
(BTD) and one health state considered worse than dead (WTD). Independence cannot 
be rejected when comparing the BTD health states, but is rejected when comparing 
the BTD states with the WTD state. In particular, utility of life duration 
becomes more concave for the WTD state. This may suggest that independence holds 
only for BTD health states. This has implications for the QALY model and would 
require using sign-dependent utility of life duration functions.

HIV and sexual behavior change: why not Africa?

Oster E(1).

Author information:
(1)University of Chicago and NBER, United States. emily.oster@chicagobooth.edu

Despite high rates of HIV in Sub-Saharan Africa, and the corresponding high 
mortality risk associated with risky sexual behavior, behavioral response has 
been limited. This paper explores three explanations for this: bias in OLS 
estimates, limited non-HIV life expectancy and limited knowledge. I find support 
for the first two. First, using a new instrumental variable strategy I find that 
OLS estimates of the relationship between risky sex and HIV are biased upwards, 
and IV estimates indicate reductions in risky behavior in response to the 
epidemic. Second, I find these reductions are larger for individuals who live in 
areas with higher life expectancy, suggesting high rates of non-HIV mortality 
suppress behavioral response; this is consistent with optimizing behavior. Using 
somewhat limited knowledge proxies, I find no evidence that areas with higher 
knowledge of the epidemic have greater behavior change.

Endografts with suprarenal fixation do not perform better than those with 
infrarenal fixation in the treatment of patients with short straight proximal 
aortic necks.

Pittsburgh, Pa., USA.

OBJECTIVE: To determine if there are any differences in outcomes between 
infrarenal fixation (IF) and suprarenal fixation (SF) endograft systems for the 
endovascular treatment (endovascular aneurysm repair [EVAR]) of abdominal aortic 
aneurysms (AAAs) with short, straight proximal aortic necks (<1.5 cm).
METHODS: A retrospective review of 1379 EVAR procedures was performed between 
the years of 2002 and 2009 at a single institution. The charts and radiographic 
images of all patients were reviewed. Patients who underwent EVAR with AAA 
morphology with short proximal necks were stratified into two groups: IF, Gore 
Excluder (W. L. Gore, Flagstaff, Ariz) group and SF, Cook Zenith (Cook, 
Bloomington, Ind) group. The primary end point for the study was the presence of 
proximal type 1 endoleaks. Secondary end points were graft migration at 1- and 
2-year follow-up and aneurysm sac regression. The groups' demographics and 
comorbidities were also compared.
RESULTS: A total of 1379 EVARS were performed during the study period and 84 
were identified as having a short proximal aortic neck. Sixty patients were in 
the IF group and 24 in the SF group. The average follow-up period was 18.6 
months (IF) and 18.5 months (SF). There was no difference in the average 
proximal neck length (1.19 cm IF vs 1.14 cm SF; P = not significant [NS]) or the 
preoperative AAA size (5.8 cm IF vs 5.9 cm SF; P = NS). There were no 
significant differences in age (76.6 years IF vs 74.8 years SF; P = .32), gender 
(IF 66.7% vs SF 21.88% men; P = .053), or length of stay (2.2 days IF vs 1.9 
days SF; P = .39). The comorbidities (diabetes, hypertension, and warfarin use) 
were also similar. There were five type 1a endoleaks in group IF and one in 
group SF (P = .44) identified at the 1-month follow-up; however, only one 
patient in the IF group underwent intervention for enlargement of the AAA sac. 
At 1 year, there was persistence of one type 1a endoleak in both groups, but 
these were deemed dead-end leaks as they did not fill the sac nor lead to
