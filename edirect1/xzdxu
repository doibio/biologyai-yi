RESULTS: At the global level, ~2.67 million (95% UI: 1.04, 5.75) YLD were 
attributable to OA associated with high BMI, with an age-standardized rate of 
31.9 (95% UI: 12.4, 68.75) YLD per 100,000 population in 2019. There was a 0.5 
increase (95% UI: 0.35, 0.79) over the 30 years with an EAPC of 1.45. In 2019, 
Australasia {57.49 (95% UI: 23.62, 125.38)}, high-income North America {56.2 
(95% UI: 23.32, 121.97)}, and Andean Latin America {49.77 (95% UI: 19.73, 
111.73)} had the highest age-standardized YLD rates. The population aged at 
60-74 group had a higher YLD rate for both males and females. Females tended to 
be more sensitive to the OA associated with high BMI than male in any region.
CONCLUSIONS: In summary, the YLD rate of OA associated with high BMI presented a 
continuous upward trend in most countries. Women and older people are more 
sensitive to OA due to physiological and psychological factors. Controlling 
modifiable risk factors such as maintaining an appropriate BMI is needed for 
disease prevention.

Recent declines in life expectancy in the US, especially for middle-aged White 
persons, have called attention to mortality from deaths of despair - deaths due 
to alcohol, drugs, and suicide. Using data from the Centers for Disease Control 
and the U.S. Census Bureau, this paper examined deaths of despair by 
race/ethnicity, age, cause of death, birth cohort, and sex in Missouri. We 
focused on Area Agencies on Aging as geographic units of interest to increase 
usefulness of our findings to public administrators. Deaths of despair began 
trending up for all age groups beginning in 2007-2009, with the sharpest 
increases occurring for Black or African American non-Hispanics beginning in 
2013-2015. The most dramatic increases occurred for the population age 50-59 in 
St. Louis City and Area Agency on Aging regions in southern Missouri. For older 
adults, considerable variation in rates, trends, and cause of deaths of despair 
is evident across the state.

People with developmental disability have higher health care needs and lower 
life expectancy compared with the general population. Poor quality of care 
resulting from interpersonal and systemic discrimination may further entrench 
existing inequalities. We examined the prevalence of five avoidable in-hospital 
patient safety incidents (adverse drug reactions, hospital-acquired infections, 
pressure ulcers, postoperative pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis, and 
postoperative sepsis) for four developmental disability groups (people with 
intellectual disability, chromosomal abnormalities, pervasive developmental 
disorders, and congenital malformation syndrome) in the English National Health 
Service during the period April 2017-March 2019. We found that the likelihood of 
experiencing harm in disability groups was up to 2.7-fold higher than in 
patients without developmental disability. Patient safety incidents led to an 
excess length-of-stay in hospital of 3.6-15.4 days and an increased mortality 
risk of 1.4-15.0 percent. We show persisting quality differences in patients 
with developmental disability, requiring an explicit national policy focus on 
the needs of such patients to reduce inequalities, reach parity of care, and 
lower the burden on health system resources.

STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study.
OBJECTIVE: To assess whether patient outcomes and cost-effectiveness of adult 
spinal deformity (ASD) surgery have improved over the past decade.
BACKGROUND: Surgery for ASD is an effective intervention, but one that is also 
associated with large initial healthcare expenditures. Changes in the cost 
profile for ASD surgery over the last decade has not been evaluated previously.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: ASD patients who received surgery between 2008 and 2019 
were included. Analysis of covariance was used to establish estimated marginal 
means for outcome measures [complication rates, reoperations, health-related 
quality of life, total cost, utility gained, quality adjusted life years 
(QALYs), cost-efficiency (cost per QALY)] by year of initial surgery. Cost was 
calculated using the PearlDiver database and represented national averages of 
Medicare reimbursement for services within a 30-day window including length of 
stay and death differentiated by complication/comorbidity, revision, and 
surgical approach. Internal cost data was based on individual patient 
diagnosis-related group codes, limiting revisions to those within two years (2Y) 
of the initial surgery. Cost per QALY over the course of 2008-2019 were then 
calculated.
RESULTS: There were 1236 patients included. There was an overall decrease in 
rates of any complication (0.78 vs . 0.61), any reoperation (0.25 vs . 0.10), 
and minor complication (0.54 vs . 0.37) between 2009 and 2018 (all P <0.05). 
National average 2Y cost decreased at an annual rate of $3194 ( R2 =0.6602), 2Y 
utility gained increased at an annual rate of 0.0041 ( R2 =0.57), 2Y QALYs 
gained increased annually by 0.008 ( R2 =0.57), and 2Y cost per QALY decreased 
per year by $39,953 ( R2 =0.6778).
CONCLUSION: Between 2008 and 2019, rates of complications have decreased 
concurrently with improvements in patient reported outcomes, resulting in 
improved cost effectiveness according to national Medicare average and 
individual patient cost data. The value of ASD surgery has improved 
substantially over the course of the last decade.

Amide bond formation, the essential condensation reaction underlying peptide 
synthesis, is hindered in aqueous systems by the thermodynamic constraints 
associated with dehydration. This represents a key difficulty for the widely 
held view that prebiotic chemical evolution leading to the formation of the 
first biomolecules occurred in an oceanic environment. Recent evidence for the 
acceleration of chemical reactions at droplet interfaces led us to explore 
aqueous amino acid droplet chemistry. We report the formation of dipeptide 
isomer ions from free glycine or L-alanine at the air-water interface of aqueous 
microdroplets emanating from a single spray source (with or without applied 
potential) during their flight toward the inlet of a mass spectrometer. The 
proposed isomeric dipeptide ion is an oxazolidinone that takes fully covalent 
and ion-neutral complex forms. This structure is consistent with observed 
fragmentation patterns and its conversion to authentic dipeptide ions upon 
gentle collisions and for its formation from authentic dipeptides at ultra-low 
concentrations. It also rationalizes the results of droplet fusion experiments 
that show that the dipeptide isomer facilitates additional amide bond formation 
events, yielding authentic tri- through hexapeptides. We propose that the 
interface of aqueous microdroplets serves as a drying surface that shifts the 
equilibrium between free amino acids in favor of dehydration via stabilization 
of the dipeptide isomers. These findings offer a possible solution to the water 
paradox of biopolymer synthesis in prebiotic chemistry.

BACKGROUND: Guidelines recommend sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) 
inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP1) receptor agonists as second-line 
therapy for patients with type 2 diabetes. Expanding their use as first-line 
therapy has been proposed but the clinical benefits may not outweigh their 
costs.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the lifetime cost-effectiveness of a strategy of 
first-line SGLT2 inhibitors or GLP1 receptor agonists.
DESIGN: Individual-level Monte Carlo-based Markov model.
DATA SOURCES: Randomized trials, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
databases, RED BOOK, and the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.
TARGET POPULATION: Drug-naive U.S. patients with type 2 diabetes.
TIME HORIZON: Lifetime.
PERSPECTIVE: Health care sector.
INTERVENTION: First-line SGLT2 inhibitors or GLP1 receptor agonists.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Life expectancy, lifetime costs, incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs).
RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: First-line SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP1 receptor 
agonists had lower lifetime rates of congestive heart failure, ischemic heart 
disease, myocardial infarction, and stroke compared with metformin. First-line 
SGLT2 inhibitors cost $43 000 more and added 1.8 quality-adjusted months versus 
first-line metformin ($478 000 per quality-adjusted life-year [QALY]). 
First-line injectable GLP1 receptor agonists cost more and reduced QALYs 
compared with metformin.
RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: By removing injection disutility, first-line 
GLP1 receptor agonists were no longer dominated (ICER, $327 000 per QALY). Oral 
GLP1 receptor agonists were not cost-effective (ICER, $823 000 per QALY). To be 
cost-effective at under $150 000 per QALY, costs for SGLT2 inhibitors would need 
to be under $5 per day and under $6 per day for oral GLP1 receptor agonists.
LIMITATION: U.S. population and costs not generalizable internationally.
CONCLUSION: As first-line agents, SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP1 receptor agonists 
would improve type 2 diabetes outcomes, but their costs would need to fall by at 
least 70% to be cost-effective.

Key Content • Levator ani muscle (LAM) avulsion injury occurs occultly during 
childbirth, most commonly during operative vaginal deliveries. • Injuries of 
levator ani have long term sequelae for pelvic floor health. As life expectancy 
increases the burden of disease upon urogynaecology services will need to be 
considered. • Diagnosis of this condition can be difficult as there is no agreed 
'gold standard' imaging modality. • There is no consensus regarding surgical 
management of LAM avulsion. Learning objectives • Review anatomy and function of 
levator ani muscle • Identify the risk factors for levator ani avulsion injury • 
Role of imaging to appropriately identify LAM injury and current management 
options including appropriate follow up • Management of subsequent pregnancy 
following LAM avulsion Ethical issues • Is there value to the patient in 
diagnosing levator ani avulsion when there is no recommended treatment for these 
injuries?

BACKGROUND: Children with Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA) may adopt 
different movement patterns and participate in physical activity during 
different states of disease.
RESEARCH QUESTION: Which specific features of gait and physical function 
performance differ among children with active or inactive JIA compared to 
healthy children?
METHODS: Forty-three children participated (14.5 ± 4.2 yrs; 60 % female). 
3D-motion analysis methods were coupled with force measures from an instrumented 
treadmill captured gait mechanical measures. The 30-second Chair Rise Test 
(repetitions) and stair ascent-descent tests were performed, and the 11-point 
Wong-Baker face scale assessed pain after each test.
RESULTS: Compared to healthy controls children with active and inactive JIA had 
worse outcomes (12-21 % slower self-selected and fast walking speeds, 28-34 % 
slower stair navigation times, 28 % fewer chair rise repetitions in 30 s; all 
p < .05). Children with active JIA had 8-13 % slower gait speeds, 4 % fewer 
chair rise repetitions and 14-16 % slower stair navigation times. At faster 
walking speed, children with active JIA had less hip joint flexion/extension 
excursion in the sagittal plane during the gait cycle, produced higher leg 
stiffness, and demonstrated greater interlimb asymmetry in GRF vertical impulse 
during loading than healthy children (all p < .05). The Pedi-FABS subscore of 
"Duration: performing athletic activity for as long as you would like without 
stopping" was rated lower in children with active JIA compared to controls 
(p < .05).
CONCLUSION: Gait speed, specific load-bearing functional tasks and leg stiffness 
features of gait may be informative 'functional biomarkers' for assessing JIA 
burden and tracking treatment efficacy. Additional prospective studies are 
needed to determine how these features change over time with pain change, and 
understand impact on quality of life and physical activity participation.

BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) still ranks the top in morbidity and 
mortality of cancers worldwide, posing a huge threat and burden to the society. 
We aimed to determine the age-standardized incidence, mortality, and 
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) of CRC and explore potential changes in 
the temporal trends of the CRC burden in Shanghai during 2002 to 2016.
METHODS: The cancer statistics and demographics were obtained from the Cancer 
Registry and the Statistics Bureau of Pudong New Area, respectively. Data from 
2002 to 2016 were included and analyzed retrospectively. DALYs were calculated 
using DisMod and the age-standardized rates (ASRs) were obtained according to 
Segi world standard population. Joinpoint regression was used to measure the 
trends in CRC incidence and to estimate the annual percent change.
RESULTS: The increasing trend of CRC ASR incidence halted after 2014, coinciding 
with the introduction of the Shanghai CRC screening program. The ASRs of 
mortality and DALYs increased, at 0.42% ( P  < 0.05) and 4.07% ( P  < 0.001) per 
year, respectively, which were mainly driven by men and individuals aged above 
the CRC screening program target.
CONCLUSIONS: The disease burden of CRC in Shanghai remains serious, especially 
among men, and individuals aged >74 years. The benefits of the screening program 
have been partially proven by the ASRs of CRC incidence, providing important 
insights into better and wider application of screening programs.

BACKGROUND: Globalisation has led to international trade expand rapidly. 
Seaborne transport moves 80% of traded goods across the globe, producing around 
3% of greenhouse gases and other hazardous pollutants, such as PM, NOx and SOx, 
known to be harmful to health.
METHODS: A scoping literature review was conducted reviewing peer-reviewed 
studies on health impact assessments (HIA) of global shipping and port-sourced 
air pollution. For review inclusion, studies had to (1) use a HIA methodology; 
(2) quantify the air pollution concentration attributable to at least one 
shipping or port activity scenario; (3) assess at least one health outcome (i.e. 
epidemiological measure or monetization); (4) quantify the attributable health 
burden of the respective scenario.
RESULTS: Thirty-two studies were included, studying predominantly European Sea 
shipping/ port-sourced emissions with health impacts for global or respective 
European populations. Also, Global, Asian, North American and Australian Sea 
shipping/ port-sourced emissions were studied, with attributable health impacts 
for global or respective populations. The health outcome predominantly studied 
was mortality (all-cause, cause-specific, loss in life expectancy, years of life 
lost (YLLs)), but also morbidity (disease cases, hospital admissions, years 
lived with disability (YLDs)), disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), 
restricted activity days and work loss days. The highest air pollution 
concentrations were identified along major shipping routes and ports, and the 
strongest health impacts occurred among respective riparian populations. 
Globally, ∼265,000 premature deaths were projected for 2020 (∼0.5% of global 
mortality) attributable to global shipping-sourced emissions. Emission control 
scenarios studied were predominantly sulphur fuel content caps and NOx emission 
reduction scenarios, consisting of technological interventions, cleaner fuels or 
fuel switches, and were assessed as effective in reducing shipping-sourced 
emissions, and hence, health burdens.
CONCLUSIONS: Our review positions maritime transport an important source of air 
pollution and health risk factor, which needs more research and policy attention 
and rigorous emission control efforts, as shipping-sourced emissions are 
projected to increase with increases in global trade and shipping volumes.

OBJECTIVES: We conducted a distributional cost-effectiveness analysis (DCEA) to 
evaluate how Medicare funding of inpatient COVID-19 treatments affected health 
equity in the United States.
METHODS: A DCEA, based on an existing cost-effectiveness analysis model, was 
conducted from the perspective of a single US payer, Medicare. The US population 
was divided based on race and ethnicity (Hispanic, non-Hispanic black, and 
non-Hispanic white) and county-level social vulnerability index (5 quintile 
groups) into 15 equity-relevant subgroups. The baseline distribution of 
quality-adjusted life expectancy was estimated across the equity subgroups. 
Opportunity costs were estimated by converting total spend on COVID-19 inpatient 
treatments into health losses, expressed as quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), 
using base-case assumptions of an opportunity cost threshold of $150 000 per 
QALY gained and an equal distribution of opportunity costs across 
equity-relevant subgroups.
RESULTS: More socially vulnerable populations received larger per capita health 
benefits due to higher COVID-19 incidence and baseline in-hospital mortality. 
The total direct medical cost of inpatient COVID-19 interventions in the United 
States in 2020 was estimated at $25.83 billion with an estimated net benefit of 
735 569 QALYs after adjusting for opportunity costs. Funding inpatient COVID-19 
treatment reduced the population-level burden of health inequality by 0.234%. 
Conclusions remained robust across scenario and sensitivity analyses.
CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first DCEA to quantify 
the equity implications of funding COVID-19 treatments in the United States. 
Medicare funding of COVID-19 treatments in the United States could improve 
overall health while reducing existing health inequalities.

PURPOSE: Blood flow restriction - low load strength training (BFR-LLST) is 
theoretically superior to traditional heavy strength training when 
rehabilitating patients who cannot heavily load tissues following surgery. The 
main purpose of this study was to examine the feasibility of BFR-LLST added to 
usual care exercise early after cartilage or meniscus repair in the knee joint.
METHODS: We included 42 patients with cartilage (n = 21) or meniscus repair 
(n = 21) of the knee joint. They attended 9 weeks of BFR-LLST added to a usual 
care exercise program at an outpatient rehabilitation center. Outcome measures 
were assessed at different time points from four (baseline) to 26 weeks 
postoperatively and included adherence, harms, knee joint and thigh pain, 
perceived exertion, thigh circumference (muscle size proxy), isometric 
knee-extension strength, self-reported disability and quality of life.
RESULTS: On average, patients with cartilage or meniscus repair completed > 84% 
of the total BFR-LLST supervised sessions. Thirty-eight patients reported 146 
adverse events of which none were considered serious. No decrease in thigh 
circumference or exacerbation of knee joint or quadriceps muscle pain of the 
operated leg was found in either group during the intervention period.
CONCLUSIONS: BFR-LLST added to usual care exercise initiated early after 
cartilage or meniscus repair seems feasible and may prevent disuse thigh muscle 
atrophy during a period of weight bearing restrictions. Harms were reported, but 
no serious adverse events were found. Our findings are promising but need 
replication using a RCT-design.

BACKGROUND: Malnutrition among older age people is becoming significantly higher 
in spite of improvements in the health care system. Life expectancy of Ethiopian 
elders is increasing; but reliable and valid tools for screening and diagnosis 
of malnutrition in this subgroup are limited. This study aimed to assess the 
validity of anthropometric measurements: Mid Upper Arm Circumference (MUAC), 
Body Mass Index (BMI), and Calf Circumference (CC) in detecting malnutrition 
status of older age people in Ethiopia.
METHODS: A community based cross-sectional study was conducted in Borena 
District from January to March, 2020. A total of 421 participants aged were 
systematically included in the study. To test reliability and validity of the 
measurements,Cronbach's α coefficient and Pearson's correlations were used, 
respectively. The full Mini-Nutritional Assessment (MNA) tool was used to 
diagnosis malnutrition. Overall accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of BMI, 
MUAC and CC were estimated using Receiver Operating Characteristic curves. The 
Youden Index was used to determine the best cut-off point.
RESULTS: The reliability of BMI, MUAC and CC by Cronbach's alpha was found 
0.847. Significant positive correlations between MNA, BMI(r = 0.56, p < 0.01); 
MNA, MUAC(r = 0.43, p < 0.01; and MNA, CC(r = 0.52, p < 0.01) revealed. The area 
under the curve (AUC) of BMI, MUAC and CC were found: 0.98(95% CI, 0.96-0.99, 
p < 0.001), 0.94(95% CI, 0.89-0.98, p < 0.001) and 0.96(95% CI, 0.94-0.98, 
p < 0.001) indicating the overall accuracy respectively. The sensitivity and 
specificity of BMI, MUAC and CC using established cut off points were found: 
90%, 96%; 78%, 94% and 84%, 95% respectively. However, using the Youden index 
the best cut-off point, the sensitivity and specificity of MUAC and CC were 88%, 
86%; 92% and 89% respectively and adjusted for age and sex.
CONCLUSIONS: The current study demonstrated that BMI was a reliable and valid 
method to identify the malnutrition status of older age people. A MUAC value of 
19 cm and CC of 30 cm were simple and efficient cut-off points for the 
determination of malnutrition in the older age people. A future study is needed 
to validate the validity of BMI, MUAC and CC against biochemical tests as gold 
standard.

BACKGROUND: This scoping review reports on studies that collect survey data 
using quantitative research to measure self-reported oral health status outcome 
measures. The objective of this review is to categorize measures used to 
evaluate self-reported oral health status and oral health quality of life used 
in surveys of general populations.
METHODS: The review is guided by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic 
Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) with the 
search on four online bibliographic databases. The criteria include (1) 
peer-reviewed articles, (2) papers published between 2011 and 2021, (3) only 
studies using quantitative methods, and (4) containing outcome measures of 
self-assessed oral health status, and/or oral health-related quality of life. 
All survey data collection methods are assessed and papers whose methods employ 
newer technological approaches are also identified.
RESULTS: Of the 2981 unduplicated papers, 239 meet the eligibility criteria. 
Half of the papers use impact scores such as the OHIP-14; 10% use functional 
measures, such as the GOHAI, and 26% use two or more measures while 8% use 
rating scales of oral health status. The review identifies four data collection 
methods: in-person, mail-in, Internet-based, and telephone surveys. Most (86%) 
employ in-person surveys, and 39% are conducted in Asia-Pacific and Middle 
East countries with 8% in North America. Sixty-six percent of the studies 
recruit participants directly from clinics and schools, where the surveys were 
carried out. The top three sampling methods are convenience sampling (52%), 
simple random sampling (12%), and stratified sampling (12%). Among the four data 
collection methods, in-person surveys have the highest response rate (91%), 
while the lowest response rate occurs in Internet-based surveys (37%). Telephone 
surveys are used to cover a wider population compared to other data collection 
methods. There are two noteworthy approaches: 1) sample selection where 
researchers employ different platforms to access subjects, and 2) mode of 
interaction with subjects, with the use of computers to collect self-reported 
data.
CONCLUSION: The study provides an assessment of oral health outcome measures, 
including subject-reported oral health status and notes newly emerging computer 
technological approaches recently used in surveys conducted on general 
populations. These newer applications, though rarely used, hold promise for both 
researchers and the various populations that use or need oral health care.

To address the issue of genetic mutations in medical records, clinical studies 
on minimally invasive surgery for breast cancer have been proposed. The CYP1B1 
gene is mainly a single-nucleotide mutation, which affects the enzymatic 
reaction related to carcinogens and causes the susceptibility differences of 
different individuals. First, the survival rate and other factors influencing 
the estimation of 120 leukemia patients were examined with the help of various 
medical records by establishing an organization for auxiliary diagnosis of lung 
cancer based on expertise. Secondly, through the treatment of 120 leukemia 
patients after minor surgery, the average life expectancy of 120 patients was 19 
months, the one-year survival rate was 74.61%, and the two-year survival rate 
was 32.70%. Currently, there are more than 160 cases of CYP1B1 discovered. In 
recent years, people have gradually entered into in-depth research on the 
correlation between genes and lung cancer, which is of great significance to the 
treatment and research of lung cancer. An analysis showed patients' age, stage, 
whether they would work, whether radiation therapy and antibiotics were offered, 
and so on. s has a direct impact on patient survival, and many tests have shown 
that the patient's age, stage, whether it will work, and whether fire radiation 
and drug therapy are provided are important interventions for patients with 
anemia. Finally, in patients with leukemia, especially during the restricted 
period, combined treatment with a physician, radiologist, and surgeon should be 
initiated as soon as possible. For a wide range of disease, depending on the use 
of chemotherapy, local metastasis with antibiotics can improve the disease. 
After success, it is more beneficial to choose second-line treatment.

Strawberries are known for their high perishability and short shelf life. The 
effects of incorporating hydrogen gas into sealed packaging on the quality and 
shelf life of strawberries were evaluated. Fruits were packaged under reducing 
atmosphere [RAP1 (5% CO2 , 4% H2 , 91% N2 ) and RAP2 (10% CO2 , 4% H2 , 86% N2 
)], modified atmosphere [MAP1 (5% CO2 , 95% N2 ) and MAP2 (10% CO2 , 90% N2 )], 
and control, followed by 12 weeks storage at 4 °C. At the end of storage, RAPs 
exhibited higher total soluble solids (TSS), firmness, L* and a*, phenolic and 
anthocyanin contents, and antioxidant activity followed by MAPs when compared 
with control. RAP2 was more potent in protecting the freshness indices than 
RAP1, and MAP2 outperformed MAP1, with the best protection characteristic 
attributed to RAP2. RAP technique extended the shelf life by 3-5 times the 
control, and 1.5-3.0 times the MAP. RAP should be recommended as a green and 
healthy preservation technique for the long storage of fresh fruits.

OBJECTIVE: Although the medical potential of the hope for a cure has been 
fiercely debated within academia, few researchers have approached this topic 
from the perspective of terminally ill cancer patients themselves. As such, this 
article aims to help bridge the gap by exploring how terminally ill cancer 
patients in China construct the hope for a cure.
METHODS: Seventeen terminally ill cancer patients were recruited from the 
department of oncology at a tertiary hospital, where data were collected through 
individual interviews and participatory observation from April to December 2020 
and analysed via thematic analysis.
RESULTS: The respondents experienced a dynamic swing between construction and 
denial of the hope for a cure. Furthermore, the patients negotiated between 
three forms of hope, including the hope for a cure, the hope for prolonged life 
expectancy and the hope of living in the moment. Meanwhile, family-oriented hope 
was centred on intergenerational relationships, which further shaped the 
construction of the hope for a cure.
CONCLUSION: Medical staff needs to be sensitive to terminally ill cancer 
patients' dynamic swing, negotiation and motivation during the process of 
constructing the hope for a cure.

Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.

INTRODUCTION: The main research purpose is to compare the long-term 
cost-effectiveness of semaglutide (SEMA) with that of dulaglutide (DULA) for 
patients with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes throughout their lifetime. 
If necessary, the second aim is to investigate a further price cut for SEMA to 
provide sound advice for government drug price adjustments.
METHODS: Cost-utility analysis was performed by the United Kingdom Prospective 
Diabetes Study Outcomes Model 2 (UKPDS OM2) from the perspective of health care 
providers in China. Baseline characteristics and clinical efficacy of SEMA and 
DULA were sourced from the high-dose comparison in the SUSTAIN-7 trial. A binary 
search was used to identify the scope for further reduction in the price of 
SEMA. The impact of individual parameters was assessed with sensitivity 
analyses.
RESULTS: Main analysis (SEMA vs. DULA) revealed a mean difference in 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) of 0.04 QALYs and costs of $1132.29. The 
incremental cost-utility ratio was $26 957.44/QALY, showing that SEMA was a 
better option compared with DULA. In sensitivity analyses, the discount rate 
made the greatest contribution to the incremental cost-utility ratio. In the 
binary search, there was still scope to reduce the SEMA cost further by 
approximately 6.83% to be cost-effective, taking DULA as a reference.
CONCLUSION: After its addition to the National Medical Insurance System in 
China, SEMA is expected to be a cost-effective choice compared with DULA for 
patients with type 2 diabetes with inadequately controlled from the cost-utility 
analysis. However, there is still scope to reduce the annual cost of SEMA 
further.

PURPOSE/BACKGROUND: There has been resurgence of interest in the therapeutic use 
of serotonergic ("classic") psychedelics in major depressive disorder (MDD) and 
end-of-life distress. This commentary offers a critical appraisal of current 
evidence for antidepressant effects of classic psychedelics from contemporary 
clinical trials and highlights pitfalls that should be addressed before clinical 
translation.
METHODS/PROCEDURES: A narrative review was conducted to identify clinical trials 
of serotonergic psychedelics for the treatment of MDD and end-of-life distress. 
Trials published between January 1990 and May 2022 were identified on PubMed 
using combinations of search terms.
FINDINGS/RESULTS: Psilocybin, lysergic acid diethylamide, and ayahuasca have 
clinical trials to evaluate antidepressant effects. Two studies showed 
preliminary positive effects of single-dose ayahuasca for treatment-resistant 
depression. Similar results were seen in lysergic acid diethylamide for 
end-of-life distress. Small randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of psilocybin 
combined with psychotherapy showed superiority to waitlist controls and 
comparable efficacy and safety to an active comparator in MDD, with additional 
RCTs showing efficacy in end-of-life distress. Adverse events associated with 
psychedelics were reported as mild and transient. Small homogenous samples, 
expectancy bias, functional unblinding, and lack of consensus and 
standardization of psychotherapy are major limitations of all studies.
IMPLICATIONS/CONCLUSIONS: Given the methodological limitations of published 
RCTs, the evidence supporting the efficacy and safety of serotonergic 
psychedelics for depression is currently of low level. Future research should 
assess the role of expectancy and psychedelic effects in moderating and 
mediating treatment response. Innovative trial designs are needed to overcome 
functional unblinding. For now, psychedelics should remain experimental 
interventions used within clinical trials.
