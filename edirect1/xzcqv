anti-oxidation, mitochondrial quality control, and autophagy. Moreover, recent 
studies have shown that p53 gene polymorphisms affect life expectancy and 
lifestyle-related disease such as type 2 diabetes, suggesting that there is a 
certain relationship between p53 function and metabolic disorders. In addition, 
mutant p53 protein does not only lose the tumor suppressor function, but it also 
gains novel oncogenic function and contributes to tumor development, involving 
cellular metabolism modification. Therefore, the importance of 
multifunctionality of p53, particularly with regard to intracellular 
metabolisms, arouses therapeutic interest and calls attention as the key 
molecule among cancer, lifestyle-related diseases and life expectancy.

PURPOSE OF THE REVIEW: To summarize the potential interactions between 
obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), atrial fibrillation (AF), and connexins.
RECENT FINDINGS: OSA is highly prevalent in patients with cardiovascular 
disease, and is associated with increased risk for end-organ substantial 
morbidities linked to autonomic nervous system imbalance, increased oxidative 
stress and inflammation, ultimately leading to reduced life expectancy. 
Epidemiological studies indicate that OSA is associated with increased incidence 
and progression of coronary heart disease, heart failure, stroke, as well as 
arrhythmias, particularly AF. Conversely, AF is very common among subjects 
referred for suspected OSA, and the prevalence of AF increases with OSA 
severity. The interrelationships between AF and OSA along with the well-known 
epidemiological links between these two conditions and obesity may reflect 
shared pathophysiological pathways, which may depend on the intercellular 
diffusion of signaling molecules into either the extracellular space or require 
cell-to-cell contact. Connexin signaling is accomplished via direct exchanges of 
cytosolic molecules between adjacent cells at gap membrane junctions for 
cell-to-cell coupling. The role of connexins in AF is now quite well 
established, but the impact of OSA on cardiac connexins has only recently begun 
to be investigated. Understanding the biology and regulatory mechanisms of 
connexins in OSA at the transcriptional, translational, and post-translational 
levels will undoubtedly require major efforts to decipher the breadth and 
complexity of connexin functions in OSA-induced AF.
SUMMARY: The risk of end-organ morbidities has initiated the search for 
circulating mechanistic biomarker signatures and the implementation of 
biomarker-based algorithms for precision-based diagnosis and risk assessment. 
Here we summarize recent findings in OSA as they relate to AF risk, and also 
review potential mechanisms linking OSA, AF and connexins.

Ethiopia is one of the sub-Saharan African countries contributing to the highest 
number of maternal and neonatal deaths. Coverage of maternal and neonatal health 
(MNH) interventions has remained very low in Ethiopia. We examined the 
cost-effectiveness of selected MNH interventions in an Ethiopian setting. We 
analysed 13 case management and preventive MNH interventions. For all 
interventions, we used an ingredients-based approach for cost estimation. We 
employed a static life table model to estimate the health impact of a 20% 
increase in intervention coverage relative to the baseline. We used 
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) as the health outcome measure while costs 
were expressed in 2018 US$. Analyses were based on local epidemiological, 
demographic and cost data when available. Our finding shows that 12 out of the 
13 interventions included in our analysis were highly cost-effective. 
Interventions targeting newborns such as neonatal resuscitation (institutional), 
kangaroo mother care and management of newborn sepsis with injectable 
antibiotics were the most cost-effective interventions with incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios of US$7, US$8 and US$17 per DALY averted, 
respectively. Obstetric interventions (induction of labour, active management of 
third stage of labour, management of pre-eclampsia/eclampsia and maternal 
sepsis, syphilis treatment and tetanus toxoid during pregnancy) and safe 
abortion cost between US$100 and US$300 per DALY averted. Calcium 
supplementation for pre-eclampsia and eclampsia prevention was the least 
cost-effective, with a cost per DALY of about US$3100. Many of the MNH 
interventions analysed were highly cost-effective, and this evidence can inform 
the ongoing essential health services package revision in Ethiopia. Our analysis 
also shows that calcium supplementation does not appear to be cost-effective in 
our setting.

Malignant pleural effusions' (MPEs) treatment goals focus on optimizing the 
quality of life and decreasing time spent in health care facilities in this 
patient population with limited life expectancy. Numerous pleural palliation 
options and combination of these exist and continue to undergo studies to 
identify safe, superior and ideally patient-centered care. We report a cohort of 
13 patients with symptomatic MPE managed with iodopovidone intrapleural 
instillation via an indwelling pleural catheter (IPC) in the ambulatory setting. 
Successful complete pleurodesis was achieved in 10 of 13 (76.9%) patients at a 
median time of 5 days with IPC removal at a median of 16 days. Two patient 
obtained partial pleurodesis with IPC removal, 1 required IPC reinsertion due to 
symptom recurrence. Complications were limited to intraprocedural pain in 4 
patients (31%). Iodopovidone pleurodesis via IPC may represent a safe, feasible, 
and effective ambulatory-based option for pleural palliation in MPE.

North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC.

BACKGROUND: Few studies have evaluated the years of life lost (YLL) and 
productivity loss due to sudden unexpected death (SUD). The burden of SUD on 
society is undetermined because of lack of population-based studies and 
comprehensive adjudication methods.
OBJECTIVE: We estimated YLL and productivity loss from SUD in working-age adults 
and compared it with the leading causes of death in the United States.
METHODS: We screened all out of hospital deaths among people aged 20-64 in Wake 
County, NC from 2013 to 2015 to adjudicate SUDs. We extrapolated Wake County 
incidence to estimate the age-standardized and sex-standardized rate of SUD in 
the United States. YLL was calculated based on the remaining life expectancy of 
the victims. Incorporating market and housekeeping value estimated the present 
value of lifetime productivity loss because of SUD.
RESULTS: SUD incidence rates in the US adults aged 20-64 were 49.3 (95% 
confidence interval, 41.2-58.3) and 21.7 (95% confidence interval, 16.5-27.8) 
per 100,000 among men and women, respectively. SUD resulted in the loss of 2 
million years of life, accounting for 10.0% of YLL from all causes of death. 
Among natural causes of death, YLL from SUD was only lower than that from all 
cancers combined and heart disease. Lifetime productivity loss because of SUD 
was ~$51 billion, exceeding productivity loss from any individual cancer.
CONCLUSION: SUD is an important source of YLL and productivity loss among adults 
aged 20-64. Such a high burden on society justifies prioritizing health policies 
and interventions toward preventing SUD.

Estimates of medical care costs for cervical and other cancers associated with 
human papillomavirus (HPV) are higher in studies published in recent years than 
in studies published before 2012. The purpose of this report is (1) to review 
and summarize the recent cancer cost estimates and (2) to illustrate how the 
estimated cost-effectiveness of HPV vaccination might change when these recent 
cost estimates are applied. Our literature search yielded 6 studies that 
provided updated medical care cost estimates for 5 HPV-associated cancers. We 
found that applying the current cancer cost estimates had a notable impact on 
the estimated medical costs averted by HPV vaccination over an extended time 
frame (100Â years), and a moderate impact on the estimated cost per 
quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained by HPV vaccination. For example, for 
catch-up vaccination of teenagers and young adults, applying the more recent 
cancer costs reduced the estimated cost per QALY gained by about $12,400. The 
cost studies we identified in our literature review are up-to-date and based on 
reliable data sources from United States settings, and can inform future studies 
of HPV vaccination cost-effectiveness in the United States. However, careful 
consideration is warranted to determine the most appropriate cost values to 
apply.

In connection with the increase in life expectancy, the number of people of 
older age groups is increasing, and with it the age of associated diseases, 
which are of tremendous medical and social importance. Such diseases include 
Alzheimer's disease, osteoporosis, sarcopenia, atherosclerosis and other 
cardiovascular pathology. The role of the gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of 
these nosologies is widely discussed in the literature. In addition, a number of 
studies have shown the effectiveness of the use of probiotics and prebiotics in 
the treatment of these diseases. The review of the literature summarizes the 
current understanding of the role of the intestinal microbiota in the 
development, prevention, and treatment of major age-related diseases.

OBJECTIVES: Recommendations for extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation 
(ECPR) state that appropriate patient selection is important for the sake of 
efficacy and cost-effectiveness of ECPR. It is not known whether first 
documented rhythm plays a prominent role in economic outcomes of patients with 
cardiac arrest who received ECPR.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We reviewed the medical records of 120 consecutive patients 
who received extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) assisted CPR due to 
refractory circulatory collapse between 2008 and 2016 in Urasoe General 
Hospital. The patients presented with ventricular fibrillation or pulseless 
ventricular tachycardia (VF/VT; nâ=â59, 49.2%) or with asystole or pulseless 
electric activity (ASY/PEA; nâ=â61, 50.8%) as the first documented rhythm. 
Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified shorter duration from 
collapse to ECMO initiation (odds ratio, 1.95 per 10âmin; 95% confidence 
interval, 1.32-2.89, pâ=â0.001), bystander CPR (odds ratio, 5.53; 95% confidence 
interval, 1.36-22.5, pâ=â0.017), and first documented rhythm of VF/VT (odds 
ratio, 3.93; 95% confidence interval, 1.30-11.8, pâ=â0.015) as clinical 
predictors for neurologically intact survival. Total hospital cost per life 
saved by ECPR for ASY/PEA was approximately twice that for VF/VT ($213,656 vs. 
$101,669). ECPR yielded Quality adjusted life years (QALYs) of 3.32 at a mean 
total cost of $39,634 for VF/VT and QALYs of 1.17 at a mean cost of $35,609 for 
ASY/PEA. The cost per QALYs was $11,081 for VF/VT and $29,447 for ASY/PEA. The 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of ECPR vs. conventional CPR was estimated 
to be $ 16,246 per QALY gained.
CONCLUSION: ECPR for patients presenting with VF/VT was found to be highly 
cost-effective and ECPR for patients presenting with ASY/PEA was borderline 
cost-effective.

Atmospheric polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) disproportionately affect 
human health across the globe, and differential exposure is believed to drive 
the unequal health burden. Therefore, this study assessed and compared the 
burden of disease, in disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), at the same level 
(or limit) of exposure to atmospheric PAHs in nine countries. We calculated the 
DALYs per person-year per ng/m3 of benzo[a]pyrene from ten cancers and 
thirty-four non-cancer adverse outcomes using published toxicity information and 
country-specific disease severity. Exposure duration was averaged over 30 years 
and we adjusted for early-life vulnerability to cancer. The DALYs per 
person-year per ng/m3 of fifteen other individual PAHs was calculated using 
relative potency factors, and toxicity factors derived from quantitative 
structure-activity relationships. We found that even at the same level of 
exposure to PAHs, the incremental burdens of disease varied substantially across 
countries. For instance, they varied by about 2-3 folds between Nigeria and the 
USA. Countries having the lowest longevity had the highest DALYs per person-year 
per ng/m3 of each PAH. Kruskal-Wallis test (Î±â¯=â¯0.05) showed that the variation 
across countries was significant. The post hoc tests detected a significant 
difference between two countries when the gap in longevity was >10 years. This 
suggests that countries having very low average life expectancy require more 
stringent PAH limit. Linear or exponential function of average longevity gave 
valid approximation of the DALYs per person-year per ng/m3 of benzo[a]pyrene or 
phenanthrene, respectively. Furthermore, we used global gridded surface 
benzo[a]pyrene concentrations and global population dataset for 2007, with 
spatial resolution of 0.1Â°â¯Ãâ¯0.1Â°, to calculate the contribution of differential 
exposures to the estimated DALYs per person-year. We found that in six out of 
nine countries, differential exposures to PAH contribute less to the estimated 
health loss than differential severities of the diseases. This indicates that 
the risk to health from PAHs may be underreported if the severities of the 
diseases in the countries are not considered.

OBJECTIVES: Because of the lack of evidence regarding long-term effectiveness 
and cost-effectiveness of first-generation direct-acting antivirals for chronic 
hepatitis C (CHC) treatment in Brazil, we performed a cost-utility analysis 
comparing standard dual therapy (peginterferon plus ribavirin [pegIFN/RBV]), 
boceprevir, and telaprevir for CHC patients.
METHODS: We developed a state-transition Markov model simulating the progression 
of CHC. Long-term outcomes included remaining life expectancy in life-years 
(LYs), quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio (ICER). Short-term outcomes included sustained virological response rates 
(SVR). Direct medical costs were obtained from Brazilian databases. A lifelong 
time horizon was considered and a 5% annual discount rate was applied for costs 
and clinical outcomes. A willingness-to-pay threshold of approximately $20â000 
per QALY was used. We performed multiple sensitivity analyses.
RESULTS: For short- and long-term scenarios, therapy with boceprevir was 
dominated by telaprevir, which was more effective than standard dual therapy 
(75.0% vs 40.4% SVR rate, 13.47 vs 12.59 LYs, and 9.74 vs 8.49 QALYs, 
respectively) and was also more expensive ($15â742 vs $5413). The corresponding 
ICERs were $29â854/SVR, $11â803/LY, and $8277/QALY. Based on our model, triple 
therapy with telaprevir was the most cost-effective treatment for the Brazilian 
health system. Despite a lack of data regarding the Brazilian population, we 
incorporated as many applicable parameters as possible.
CONCLUSIONS: Telaprevir is more effective and cost-effective than boceprevir. 
Our model may be applied for other settings with a few adjustments in the input 
parameters.

The fatal neurodegenerative disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is 
characterized by a profound loss of motor neurons (MNs). Until now only riluzole 
minimally extends life expectancy in ALS, presumably by inhibiting glutamatergic 
neurotransmission and calcium overload of MNs. Therefore, the aim of this study 
was to investigate the glutamate receptor properties and key aspects of 
intracellular calcium dynamics in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived 
MNs from ALS patients with C9orf72 (n = 4 cell lines), fused in sarcoma (FUS) 
(nâ=â9), superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) (n = 3) or transactive response 
DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP43) (n = 3) mutations as well as healthy (n = 7 cell 
lines) and isogenic controls (n = 3). Using calcium imaging, we most frequently 
observed spontaneous transients in mutant C9orf72 MNs. Basal intracellular 
calcium levels and Î±-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid 
(AMPA)-induced signal amplitudes were elevated in mutant TDP43 MNs. Besides, a 
majority of mutant TDP43 MNs responded to 3.5-dihydroxyphenylglycine as 
metabotropic glutamate receptor agonist. Quantitative real-time PCR demonstrated 
significantly increased expression levels of AMPA and kainate receptors in 
mutant FUS cells compared to healthy and isogenic controls. Furthermore, the 
expression of kainate receptors and voltage gated calcium channels in mutant 
C9orf72 MNs as well as metabotropic glutamate receptors in mutant SOD1 cells was 
markedly elevated compared to controls. Our data of iPSC-derived MNs from 
familial ALS patients revealed several mutation-specific alterations in 
glutamate receptor properties and calcium dynamics that could play a role in ALS 
pathogenesis and may lead to future translational strategies with individual 
stratification of neuroprotective ALS treatments.

BACKGROUND: Nedaplatin-based concurrent chemoradiotherapy became an alternative 
doublet treatment strategy to cisplatin-based concurrent chemoradiotherapy in 
patients with locoregional, advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using a Markov model, we simulated patients with 
nasopharyngeal carcinoma from disease-free to death. Input data for the model 
were collected from published literature and the standard fee database of West 
China Hospital. The outcome was expressed in quality-adjusted-years (QALYs), net 
monetary benefit at the threshold of $25,841, three times the Gross Domestic 
Product of China in 2017. The costs and benefits were discounted at 3% annually 
and a half-cycle correction was considered. The input parameters were varied in 
one-way sensitivity analysis to confirm the robustness of the model. All of the 
primary analyses used second-order probabilistic sensitivity analysis to capture 
the impact of parameter uncertainty based on 10,000 Monte-Carlo simulations.
RESULTS: The mean QALYs of treatment in stage II-IVB nasopharyngeal carcinoma 
were comparable: 2.90 QALYs for nedaplatin and 3.12 QALYs for cisplatin. 
Nedaplatin cost $34,505 compared with $27,167 for cisplatin, generating an 
incremental net monetary benefit of nedaplatin versus cisplatin of $-13,357 at 
the ceiling ratio of $25,841. The results of nedaplatin remained 
cost-ineffective over the majority of the sensitivity analyses. The 
cost-effectiveness curve showed that the probability of strategies being 
cost-effective were 0% for nedaplatin and 100% for cisplatin in stage II-IVB 
nasopharyngeal carcinoma at any willingness-to-pay threshold.
CONCLUSIONS: Nedaplatin is a dominated, cost-ineffective alternative to 
concurrent chemoradiotherapy in stage II-IVB nasopharyngeal carcinoma compared 
with cisplatin from the perspective of Chinese society.

BACKGROUND: When amenable to radical excision, cancer involving the maxilla is 
typically treated with maxillectomy followed by adjuvant therapy. Posterior 
tumor extension beyond the maxillary box leads to the invasion of complex areas, 
where achieving clear margins may be challenging.
METHODS: Patients undergoing endoscopic-assisted maxillectomy for nasoethmoidal, 
maxillary, or hard palate cancer between 2007 and 2017 were included in the 
study. Surgical technique, margin status, and recurrences were analyzed. 
Extension of posterior resection was classified in 3 types (type 1: resection of 
the pterygopalatine fossa; type 2: resection of the pterygoid plates and related 
muscles; type 3: resection of the upper parapharyngeal space). The analysis of 
putative risk factors for involvement of margins and local recurrence was 
performed with special focus on the posterior and medial margin.
RESULTS: The study included 79 patients (75 with available follow-up; mean: 
20.6â¯months, range: 6-101â¯months), 37 (46.8%) of whom underwent type 1 
resection, 34 (43.0%) type 2, and 8 (10.1%) type 3. According to pT category, 57 
(72.2%) tumors were classified as T4a/T4b. Posterior and medial clear margins 
were achieved in 76/79 (96.2%) and 75/79 (94.9%) patients, respectively. T4b 
category, extension to the ethmoid, sphenoid sinus, pterygoid process, orbital 
cavity, and premaxillary tissues were significantly associated with a higher 
rate of margin involvement. None of the factors was significantly associated 
with medial margin involvement.
CONCLUSION: Endoscopic-assisted maxillectomy combines several refinements 
including the facilitated detachment of the maxilla from the skull base and 
precise delineation of the posterior and medial margins of resection.

Surgery represents one of the main therapeutic references in the world, 
affording greater survival and life expectancy for many patients. In general, 
the estimated postoperative mortality is low (around 1-4%). Thirteen percent of 
the surgical procedures have a high risk of complications, accounting for 80% of 
all postoperative deaths. Recently, there have been significant advances related 
to organizational aspects, new anesthetic and surgical techniques, prognostic 
scales, perioperative management and greater participation and involvement of 
the patient. This new series of Medicina Intensiva will address fundamental 
aspects of how Departments of Intensive Care Medicine can add value to the 
surgical process, in a coordinated manner with other services. Institutional 
policies are required to ensure the detection of patients at risk in 
hospitalization wards, with early admission to the ICU of those patients in whom 
admission is indicated, adapting the treatment in the ICU and optimizing the 
criteria for discharge. The detection and prevention of post-ICU syndrome in 
patients and relatives, and the follow-up of ICU discharge and hospitalization 
in a multidisciplinary manner can reduce the sequelae among critical surgical 
patients, improving the outcomes and quality of life, and restoring the patient 
to society. In future publications of this series directed to the surgical 
patient, updates will be provided on the perioperative management of some of the 
most complex surgeries.

OBJECTIVES: To analyze the views of Bulgarian oncologists and hematologists 
regarding the value of innovative pharmaceutical treatments in their clinical 
area.
METHODS: Physicians were invited to review a life-prolonging scenario and to 
indicate what minimum improvement in median survival a new treatment would have 
to generate for them to recommend it over the standard of care. Respondents were 
also asked to state the highest cost at which they would recommend a new therapy 
that would improve patient's health-related quality of life (HRQoL) but would 
have no impact on survival. In addition, physicians were asked whether they 
would consider different responses under certain circumstances. Responses were 
used to calculate incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for each 
scenario.
RESULTS: In the life-prolonging scenario, participants required a median of 
12-month improvement in the survival to reimburse a new therapy at an 
incremental cost of â¬50â000, implying a willingness-to-pay of â¬50â000 per QALY 
gained. In the HRQoL-enhancing scenario, respondents indicated a â¬100â000 median 
cost per QALY gained. We observed a significant variation in responses. Although 
the median ICER for better HRQoL was twice as high as the median ICER for longer 
survival, 5% trimmed mean values were almost equal. Physicians did not believe 
that a higher ICER should be used for the treatment of children or for rare 
diseases.
CONCLUSIONS: We found a high willingness-to-pay for innovative drugs in oncology 
and hematology. The wide range of responses observed, however, indirectly 
implies a lack of consensus on the use of explicit ICER thresholds in Bulgaria.

PURPOSE: To undertake the first end-to-end cost-effectiveness analysis of exome 
sequencing (ES) in rare disease diagnosis.
METHODS: A cohort of 80 infants who underwent ES and usual diagnostic care in 
parallel were used to model incremental cost and health outcomes (quality 
adjusted life-years, QALYs) attributable to ES diagnosis over a 20-year horizon. 
Three models were developed: (1) outcomes in patients only, (2) outcomes in 
patients and first-degree relatives as a result of cascade testing, and (3) 
outcomes in patients and first-degree relatives including parental reproductive 
outcomes.
RESULTS: When the directly observed cost and health outcomes of the cohort 
participants were projected, the use of ES resulted in a gain of 7.39 QALYs and 
an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of AU$31,144.35 (i.e., cost per 
additional QALY gained). When cascade testing in first-degree relatives was 
added, cost-effectiveness increased, to a gain of 11.62 QALYs and an ICER of 
AU$20,839.57. When parental reproductive outcomes were added, cost-effectiveness 
increased again, with 36.00 QALYs gained and an ICER of AU$14,235.28.
CONCLUSION: Use of ES in suspected monogenic disorders becomes increasingly 
cost-effective as the benefits of ES data reanalysis, cascade testing in 
first-degree relatives, and parental reproductive outcomes are incorporated into 
modeling.

INTRODUCTION: The outcome of patients â¥ 60 years of age after alcohol septal 
ablation (ASA) for obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) remains 
unresolved. We sought to determine the long-term survival and the causes of 
death in this population.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: We enrolled 156 consecutive patients (69 Â±6 years, 69% 
women, follow-up: 4.8 Â±3.5 years) who underwent ASA at â¥ 60 years of age.
RESULTS: The 30-day mortality rate was 1.3%. At the last check-up, 81% of 
patients were in New York Heart Association class â¤ 2 and 76% had a left 
ventricular outflow tract gradient (LVOG) â¤ 30 mm Hg. A total of 39 patients 
died (51% of cardiovascular causes, 44% of non-cardiovascular causes, 5% of 
unknown causes) during the 734 patient-years. The annual sudden mortality, the 
sudden mortality and the all-cause mortality rates were 0.5%, 1.1%, and 4.8%, 
respectively. The all-cause mortality was higher compared to the age- and 
sex-matched general population (p = 0.002).
CONCLUSIONS: Alcohol septal ablation was safe and effective in the long-term 
follow-up. We observed a reduced life expectancy compared to the age- and 
sex-matched general population. Mortality was almost equally due to 
cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular causes of death.

BACKGROUND: We aimed to investigate individuals' subjective expectations 
regarding health and happiness alongside their provisions on life circumstances 
for older ages.
METHODS: A cross-sectional online survey was performed involving a 
representative sample (Nâ=â1000; mean age 50.9, SDâ=â15.4; female 54.5%) in 
Hungary. Subjective expectations on health status (EQ-5D-3L/-5L, GALI, WHO-5), 
happiness (0-10 VAS), employment status, care time, and forms of care for ages 
60, 70, 80, and 90 were surveyed.
RESULTS: Current mean EQ-5D-5L was 0.869 (SDâ=â0.164) and happiness was 6.7 
(SDâ=â2.4). Subjective life expectancy was 80.9 (SDâ=â11.1), and median expected 
retirement age was 65. Mean expected EQ-5D-5L for ages 60/70/80/90 was 
0.761/0.684/0.554/0.402, and no activity limitations (GALI) were expected by 
64%/40%/18%/14%, respectively. Expected happiness score was 6.8/6.7/6.2/5.7, and 
a decrease in mental well-being (WHO-5) was provisioned. A substantial increase 
in drug expenses and care time was anticipated, but only 52% thought to have 
extra income besides pension. The great majority expected to be helped by the 
family (77%/72%/53%/40%) if needed. Educational level, GALI, and longevity 
expectations were significant predictors of EQ-5D-5L expectations using a 
standard 5% significance level of decision. Current happiness was major 
determinant of expected future happiness.
CONCLUSIONS: Individuals expect a significant deterioration of health with age 
but only a moderate decrease in happiness. Overestimation of future activity 
limitations suggests a gap between statistical and subjective healthy life 
expectancy. The majority expects to rely on informal care in the elderly. Raise 
in retirement age is underestimated. Our results can be used as inputs for 
economic modelling of labor force participation and ageing.

BACKGROUND: Glycopyrronium tosylate is a topical anticholinergic approved in the 
USA for primary axillary hyperhidrosis in patients agedââ¥â9Â years (Qbrexzaâ¢ 
[glycopyrronium] cloth, 2.4%).
OBJECTIVE: This 44-week open-label extension study assessed glycopyrronium 
tosylate safety and descriptive efficacy in patients completing one of two, 
phase III, double-blind, vehicle-controlled, 4-week trials (NCT02530281; 
NCT02530294).
METHODS: Patients agedââ¥â9Â years with primary axillary hyperhidrosis were 
randomized 2:1 (glycopyrronium tosylate: vehicle, once daily) in the 
double-blind trials. Completers could receive open-label glycopyrronium tosylate 
for up to an additional 44Â weeks. Treatment-emergent adverse events and local 
skin reactions were assessed. Descriptive efficacy assessments were 
gravimetrically measured sweat production, Hyperhidrosis Disease Severity Scale 
responder rate (â¥â2 grade improvement), and Dermatology Life Quality 
Index/children's Dermatology Life Quality Index.
RESULTS: Of 651 patients completing the double-blind trials, 564 (86.6%) entered 
the open-label extension; 550 were analyzed. Most patients experiencing 
treatment-emergent adverse events had mild or moderate events (>â90%). 
Discontinuation because of treatment-emergent adverse events remained low and 
relatively stable, with a cumulative rate of 8.0% (44/550) over 44Â weeks. Common 
treatment-emergent adverse events (>â5%) were dry mouth (16.9%), vision blurred 
(6.7%), application-site pain (6.4%), nasopharyngitis (5.8%), and mydriasis 
(5.3%). Most patients (67.5%) had no local skin reactions; those occurring were 
predominantly mild/moderate. Glycopyrronium tosylate efficacy was maintained 
throughout the trial; at week 44, the Hyperhidrosis Disease Severity Scale 
responder rate was 63.2%, and improvements from baseline (double blind) in sweat 
production were -â71.3% and 8.7âÂ±â6.2/6.2âÂ±â4.9 for Dermatology Life Quality 
Index/children's Dermatology Life Quality Index.
CONCLUSIONS: Daily long-term application of glycopyrronium tosylate for up to 
48Â weeks (double blind plus open label) was generally well tolerated and 
efficacy was maintained. No new safety signals emerged.
