model using data from the Health Research Data Repository at the Manitoba Centre 
for Health Policy, University of Manitoba.
METHODS: A total of 179 patients aged 40 and over with a diagnosis of CHF levels 
II to IV were recruited from Winnipeg and Central Manitoba and randomized into 
three treatment groups: one receiving standard care, a second receiving Health 
Lines (HL) intervention and a third receiving Health Lines intervention plus 
in-house monitoring (HLM). A cost-effectiveness study was conducted in which 
outcomes were measured in terms of QALYs derived from the SF-36 and costs using 
2005 Canadian dollars. Costs included intervention and healthcare utilization. 
Bootstrap-resampled incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were computed to take 
into account the uncertainty related to small sample size.
RESULTS: The total per-patient mean costs (including intervention cost) were not 
significantly different between study groups. Both interventions (HL and HLM) 
cost less and are more effective than standard care, with HL able to produce an 
additional QALY relative to HLM for $2,975. The sensitivity analysis revealed 
that there is an 85.8% probability that HL is cost-effective if decision-makers 
are willing to pay $50,000.
CONCLUSION: Findings demonstrate that the HL intervention from the Manitoba 
Provincial Health Contact program for CHF is an optimal intervention strategy 
for CHF management compared to standard care and HLM.

OBJECTIF: Cette étude, échelonnée sur un an, visait à déterminer si le programme 
pour l'insuffisance cardiaque congestive (ICC) du Centre provincial de 
communication en matière de santé du Manitoba constitue une intervention 
efficace par rapport au coût, comparé au traitement standard.
CONCEPTION: Il s'agit d'un essai clinique aléatoire (au niveau individuel du 
patient) du modèle coût-efficacité effectué à l'aide du Registre de données de 
recherche sur la santé de la population du Centre des politiques de santé du 
Manitoba, à l'Université du Manitoba.
MÉTHODES: Un total de 179 patients de 40 ans et plus ayant reçu un diagnostic 
d'ICC de niveaux II à IV ont été recrutés à Winnipeg et au Centre du Manitoba 
puis assignés aléatoirement à trois groupes de traitement: le premier recevant 
le traitement standard, le deuxième bénéficiant d'une intervention à l'aide des 
lignes d'information (LI) et le troisième recevant l'intervention à l'aide des 
lignes d'information en plus d'un service de suivi à domicile (LID). Les 
résultats de l'étude coût-efficacité ont été mesurés selon les années-personnes 
sans invalidité (QALY) tirées du questionnaire SF-36 et selon les coûts en 
dollars canadiens 2005. Les coûts comprenaient l'intervention et l'utilisation 
des services de santé. Après un rééchantillonnage par amorçage (bootstraping), 
les rapports du coût-efficacité différentiel ont été traités pour tenir compte 
de l'incertitude liée aux petits échantillons.
RÉSULTATS: Il n'y avait pas de différence statistique entre le coût total moyen 
par patient (y compris le coût de l'intervention) de chacun des groupes à 
l'étude. Les deux interventions (LI et LID) sont moins coûteuses et sont plus 
efficaces que le traitement standard; le LI offre la possibilité d'un QALY 
supplémentaire de 2 975 $ par rapport au LID. L'analyse de sensibilité révèle 
qu'il y a une probabilité à 85,8 % que le LI soit efficace par rapport au coût, 
dans la mesure où les décideurs acceptent de payer 50 000 $.
CONCLUSION: Les résultats démontrent que l'intervention à l'aide des LI dans le 
cadre du programme pour l'ICC du Centre provincial de communication en matière 
de santé du Manitoba constitue une intervention stratégique optimale pour la 
gestion de l'ICC, comparativement au traitement standard et au LID.

OBJECTIVE: To report a series of stenting procedures for the treatment of 
malignant superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A review conducted from October 2005 to July 2013 
retrieved 56 consecutive patients treated for symptomatic malignant SVC syndrome 
with stenting.
RESULTS: SVC stenting was attempted in 56 patients (46 males, 10 females), aged 
34-84years (mean 59.3).The success rate was 49/57 (86%). Success was associated 
with the type of obstruction classified as: group1 (a -SVC stenosis, or b 
-unilateral innominate vein occlusion with contralateral innominate vein 
stenosis and normal SVC), group2 (SVC occlusion excluding bilateral innominate 
vein occlusion) and group3 (bilateral innominate vein occlusion irrespective of 
SVC status). Success rates were 100% (39/39), 75% (9/12) and 16.6% (1/6), 
respectively. These differences were significant for group1 versus group2+3 
(p<0.001) and for group2 versus group3 (p=0.032). Acute complications occurred 
in 9 patients. Patients in whom acute complications occurred were older than the 
others (67.8 vs. 57.6 years, p=0.019). The procedure-related death rate was 3.5% 
(n=2). Stent occlusion occurred in 3.5% (n=2). The patient survival was poor 
(median 2.6; range <1-29.6months), independently of the success of stenting.
CONCLUSIONS: Stenting for malignant SVC syndrome provides immediate and 
sustained symptomatic relief that lasts until death in this set of patients with 
a short life expectancy and restores the central venous access for 
administration of chemotherapy. Technical failure was associated with SVC 
occlusions and primarily with bilateral innominate vein occlusion.

We previously described two Finnish families with a new autosomal dominant 
late-onset spinal motor neuronopathy that was mapped to chromosome 
22q11.2-q13.2. In the current screening study of 43 lower motor neuron disease 
patients from Finland and Sweden, we identified 26 new late-onset spinal motor 
neuronopathy patients sharing the founder haplotype. In addition to the main 
symptoms and signs: painful cramps, fasciculations, areflexia and slowly 
evolving muscle weakness, new features such as mild bulbar findings, were 
identified. The disease is relatively benign in terms of life expectancy and 
rate of disability progression, and it is therefore noteworthy that three 
patients were initially misdiagnosed with ALS. Significant recombinants in this 
new patient cohort restricted the disease locus by 90% to 1.8Mb. Late-onset 
spinal motor neuronopathy seems not to be very rare, at least not in Finland, 
with 38 patients identified in a preliminary ascertainment.

Rotavirus is not included in the Spanish mass infant vaccination schedule but 
has also not been economically evaluated for its inclusion. We analysed 
cost-utility of the universal infant rotavirus vaccination using RotaTeq® versus 
no vaccination in Spain. We also carried out a budget impact analysis and 
determined the effect on results of different variables introduced in the model. 
A deterministic Markov model was built considering loss of quality of life for 
children and their parents, and introducing direct and indirect costs updated to 
2011. The introduction of the vaccination using RotaTeq® as a universal infant 
vaccination would increase the annual health care budget in 10.43 million euro 
and would result in a gain of an additional Quality Adjusted Life Year at a cost 
of 280,338€ from the healthcare system perspective and 210,167€ from the 
societal perspective. The model was stable to variable modifications. To sum up, 
according to our model and estimates, the introduction of a universal infant 
rotavirus vaccination with RotaTeq® in Spain would cause a large impact on the 
health care budget and would not be efficient unless significant variations in 
vaccine price, vaccine efficacy and/or utilities took place.

The life expectancy of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) has steadily increased 
over recent decades with a corresponding increase in the frequency of 
complications of the disease. Radiologists are increasingly involved with 
managing and identifying the pulmonary complications of CF. This article reviews 
the common manifestations of CF lung disease as well as updating radiologists 
with a number of less well-known complications of the condition. Early and 
accurate detection of the pulmonary effects of CF are increasingly important to 
prevent irreversible lung damage and give patients the greatest possibility of 
benefiting from the new therapies becoming available, which correct the 
underlying defect causing CF.

A rapid and sensitive liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) 
method has been developed and validated for the estimation of gestodene in human 
plasma. Gestodene was extracted from human plasma by using solid-phase 
extraction technique. Gestodene D6 was used as the internal standard. An Acquity 
HSS-T3 column provided chromatographic separation of analytes followed by 
detection with mass spectrometry. The mass transition ion-pair was followed as 
m/z 326.2→124.1 for gestodene and m/z 332.3→129.1 for gestodene D6. The method 
involves a solid phase extraction from plasma, rapid derivatization with 
hydroxylamine to form oxime, simple gradient chromatographic conditions and mass 
spectrometric detection that enables detection at sub-picogram levels. The 
proposed method has been validated for a linear range of 50-11957pg/ml with a 
correlation coefficient≥0.9994. The intra-run and inter-run precision and 
accuracy were within 10%. The overall recoveries for gestodene and gestodene D6 
were 62.02% and 67.57% respectively. The total run time was 4.0min. The 
developed method was applied for the determination of the pharmacokinetic 
parameters of gestodene following a single oral administration of a 2×0.06mg 
gestodene tablets in 10 healthy female volunteers.

A novel multiplexing method, which relies on universal amplification of 
separated ligation-dependent probes (ASLP), has been developed to genotype 
single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The ASLP technique employs two 
allele-specific oligonucleotides (ASO), modified with universal forward primer 
sequences at the 5'-end and a common locus-specific oligonucleotide (LSO) 
extended with a universal separation (US) sequence at the 3'-end. In the 
process, allele-specific ligation first takes place when target genomic DNA is 
hybridized by perfectly matching the ASO together with the LSO. A separation 
probe, which consists of a universal reverse primer sequence labeled with biotin 
at the 5'-end and complementary sequence of US at the 3'-end, is then applied to 
the resulting ligation product. During the extension reaction of the separation 
probe, the ligated probes dissociate from target genomic DNA in the form of a 
double-stranded DNA and are separated from the reaction mixture, which includes 
genomic DNA and unligated probes, by simply using streptavidin-coated magnetic 
beads. PCR amplification of the separated ligation products is then carried out 
by using universal primers and the PCR products are hybridized on a DNA 
microarray using the RecA protein. The advantageous features of the new method 
were demonstrated by using it to genotype 15 SNP markers for cultivar 
identification of pepper in a convenient and correct manner.

[The QALY approach - potentials and limits].

The concept of quality-adjusted life expectancy ("quality-adjusted life years", 
QALY) is a type of cost-benefit analysis for health economic evaluation of 
treatment options. The two parameters quality of life and life expectancy are 
thereby combined into a single value - the QALY - which can shed light on the 
cost of therapy per additional quality-adjusted year of life. The concept is, 
however, widely used in ethical discussions of the adequacy of the 
generalizations on which this approach is based. Using the simulation of an 
American research team on treatment forms for prostate cancer, the QALY concept 
is explained, followed by the presentation of ethical criticisms.

BACKGROUND: This study quantifies differences in life expectancy between 
residents of Inuit Nunangat and people in the rest of Canada; estimates the 
contribution of specific causes of death to the differences; and examines these 
differences over time, by sex and by age group.
DATA AND METHODS: A geographic approach was used to decompose differences in 
life expectancy for residents of Inuit Nunangat, compared with people living 
outside this geographic area. Differences in life expectancy by cause, sex, and 
age group were calculated using the discrete method of decomposition and were 
applied to abridged life tables. Causes of death were classified according to 
Global Burden of Disease categories. Attributable causes of death were 
calculated for causes amenable to medical intervention and for smoking-related 
diseases.
RESULTS: The largest contributor to life expectancy differences between males in 
Inuit Nunangat and the rest of Canada was injury, particularly self-inflicted 
injury at ages 15 to 24. For females, the largest contributors were malignant 
neoplasm and respiratory disease at ages 65 to 79.
INTERPRETATION: The gap in life expectancy between residents of Inuit Nunangat 
and the rest of Canada can be attributed to specific groups of causes occurring 
within specific age ranges.

Enhanced stability of Mcl1, a prosurvival Bcl2 relative, blunts stress-induced 
apoptosis, causes male sterility, and promotes tumorigenesis.

The B-cell CLL/lymphoma 2 (Bcl2) relative Myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1 
(Mcl1) is essential for cell survival during development and for tissue 
homeostasis throughout life. Unlike Bcl2, Mcl1 turns over rapidly, but the 
physiological significance of its turnover has been unclear. We have gained 
insight into the roles of Mcl1 turnover in vivo by analyzing mice harboring a 
modified allele of Mcl1 that serendipitously proved to encode an abnormally 
stabilized form of Mcl1 due to a 13-aa N-terminal extension. Although the mice 
developed normally and appeared unremarkable, the homozygous males unexpectedly 
proved infertile due to defective spermatogenesis, which was evoked by enhanced 
Mcl1 prosurvival activity. Under unstressed conditions, the modified Mcl1 is 
present at levels comparable to the native protein, but it is markedly 
stabilized in cells subjected to stresses, such as protein synthesis inhibition 
or UV irradiation. Strikingly, the modified Mcl1 allele could genetically 
complement the loss of Bcl2, because introduction of even a single allele 
significantly ameliorated the severe polycystic kidney disease and consequent 
runting caused by Bcl2 loss. Significantly, the development of c-MYC-induced 
acute myeloid leukemia was also accelerated in mice harboring that Mcl1 allele. 
Our collective findings reveal that, under certain circumstances, the N terminus 
of Mcl1 regulates its degradation; that some cell types require degradation of 
Mcl1 to induce apoptosis; and, most importantly, that rapid turnover of Mcl1 can 
serve as a tumor-suppressive mechanism.

The LuxR-type regulator VpsT negatively controls the transcription of rpoS, 
encoding the general stress response regulator, in Vibrio cholerae biofilms.

Cholera is a waterborne diarrheal disease caused by Vibrio cholerae strains of 
serogroups O1 and O139. Expression of the general stress response regulator RpoS 
and formation of biofilm communities enhance the capacity of V. cholerae to 
persist in aquatic environments. The transition of V. cholerae between 
free-swimming (planktonic) and biofilm life-styles is regulated by the second 
messenger cyclic di-GMP (c-di-GMP). We previously reported that increasing the 
c-di-GMP pool by overexpression of a diguanylate cyclase diminished RpoS 
expression. Here we show that c-di-GMP repression of RpoS expression is 
eliminated by deletion of the genes vpsR and vpsT, encoding positive regulators 
of biofilm development. To determine the mechanism of this regulation, we 
constructed a strain expressing a vpsT-FLAG allele from native transcription and 
translation signals. Increasing the c-di-GMP pool induced vpsT-FLAG expression. 
The interaction between VpsT-FLAG and the rpoS promoter was demonstrated by 
chromatin immunoprecipitation. Furthermore, purified VpsT interacted with the 
rpoS promoter in a c-di-GMP-dependent manner. Primer extension analysis 
identified two rpoS transcription initiation sites located 43 bp (P1) and 63 bp 
(P2) upstream of the rpoS start codon. DNase I footprinting showed that the VpsT 
binding site at the rpoS promoter overlaps the primary P1 transcriptional start 
site. Deletion of vpsT significantly enhanced rpoS expression in V. cholerae 
biofilms that do not make HapR. This result suggests that VpsT and c-di-GMP 
contribute to the transcriptional silencing of rpoS in biofilms prior to cells 
entering the quorum-sensing mode.

We examine the role of declining mortality in explaining the rise of retirement 
over the course of the 20th century. We construct a model in which individuals 
make labor/leisure choices over their lifetimes subject to uncertainty about 
their dates of death. In an environment with high mortality, an individual who 
saves for retirement faces a high risk of dying before he can enjoy his planned 
leisure. In this case, the optimal plan is for people to work until they die. As 
mortality falls, however, it becomes optimal to plan, and save for, retirement. 
We analyze our model using two mathematical formulations of the survival 
function as well as data on actual changes in the US life table over the last 
century, and show that this "uncertainty effect" of declining mortality would 
have more than outweighed the "horizon effect" by which rising life expectancy 
would have led to later retirement.

Limited healthcare resources make it necessary to maximize efficiency in disease 
management at the country level by priority-setting according to disease burden. 
To make the best priority settings, it is necessary to measure health status and 
have standards for its judgment, as well as consider disease management trends 
among nations. We used 17 International Classification of Diseases (ICD) 
categories of potential years of life lost (YPLL) from Organization for Economic 
Co-operation and Development (OECD) health data for 2012, 37 disease diagnoses 
YPLL from OECD health data for 2009 across 22 countries and disability-adjusted 
life years (DALY) from the World Health Organization (WHO). We set a range of 
1-1 for each YPLL per disease in a nation (position value for relative 
comparison, PARC). Changes over 5 years were also accounted for in this disease 
management index (disease management index, DMI). In terms of ICD categories, 
the DMI indicated specific areas for priority setting for different countries 
with regard to managing disease treatment and diagnosis. Our study suggests that 
DMI is a realistic index that reflects trend changes over the past 5 years to 
the present state, and PARC is an easy index for identifying relative status. 
Moreover, unlike existing indices, DMI and PARC make it easy to conduct multiple 
comparisons among countries and diseases. DMI and PARC are therefore useful 
tools for policy implications and for future studies incorporating them and 
other existing indexes.

Protein glycosylation via O-linked N-acetylglucosaminylation (O-GlcNAcylation) 
is an important post-translational regulatory mechanism mediated by O-GlcNAc 
transferase (OGT) and responsive to nutrients and stress. OGT attaches an 
O-GlcNAc moiety to proteins, while O-GlcNAcase (OGA) catalyzes O-GlcNAc removal. 
In skeletal muscle of experimental animals, prolonged increase in 
O-GlcNAcylation associates with age and muscle atrophy. Here we examined the 
effects of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and power training (PT) on muscle 
OGT and OGA gene expression in postmenopausal women generally prone to 
age-related muscle weakness. In addition, the associations of OGT and OGA gene 
expressions with muscle phenotype were analyzed. Twenty-seven 50-57-year-old 
women participated in a yearlong randomized placebo-controlled trial: HRT 
(n=10), PT (n=8) and control (n=9). OGT and OGA mRNA levels were measured from 
muscle samples obtained at baseline and after one year. Knee extensor muscle 
cross-sectional area (CSA), knee extension force, running speed and vertical 
jumping height were measured. During the yearlong intervention, HRT suppressed 
the aging-associated upregulation of OGT mRNA that occurred in the controls. The 
effects of PT were similar but weaker. HRT also tended to increase the OGA mRNA 
level compared to the controls. The change in the ratio of OGT to OGA gene 
expressions correlated negatively with the change in muscle CSA. Our results 
suggest that OGT and OGA gene expressions are associated with muscle size during 
the critical postmenopausal period. HRT and PT influence muscle OGT and OGA gene 
expression, which may be one of the mechanisms by which HRT and PT prevent 
aging-related loss of muscle mass.

Osteoporosis represents a major public health problem through its association 
with fragility fractures. The public health burden of osteoporotic fractures 
will rise in future generations, due in part to an increase in life expectancy. 
Strontium-based drugs have been shown to increase bone mass in postmenopausal 
osteoporosis patients and to reduce fracture risk but the molecular mechanisms 
of the action of these Sr-based drugs are not totally elucidated. The local 
environment of Sr(2+) cations in biological apatites present in pathological and 
physiological calcifications in patients without such Sr-based drugs has been 
assessed. In this investigation, X-ray absorption spectra have been collected 
for 17 pathological and physiological calcifications. These experimental data 
have been combined with a set of numerical simulations using the ab initio FEFF9 
X-ray spectroscopy program which takes into account possible distortion and 
Ca/Sr substitution in the environment of the Sr(2+) cations. For selected 
samples, Fourier transforms of the EXAFS modulations have been performed. The 
complete set of experimental data collected on 17 samples indicates that there 
is no relationship between the nature of the calcification (physiological and 
pathological) and the adsorption mode of Sr(2+) cations (simple adsorption or 
insertion). Such structural considerations have medical implications. 
Pathological and physiological calcifications correspond to two very different 
preparation procedures but are associated with the same localization of Sr(2+) 
versus apatite crystals. Based on this study, it seems that for supplementation 
of Sr at low concentration, Sr(2+) cations will be localized into the apatite 
network.

Selected biochemical and hematological abnormalities in Nigerians with human 
immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis C virus coinfection.

Hospital Ituku/Ozalla, Enugu, Nigeria.

BACKGROUND: Liver disease has emerged as a major cause of morbidity and 
mortality in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C 
virus (HCV) coinfection, now that antiretroviral therapy has become more 
effective and has prolonged life expectancy in HIV-infected patients. The main 
objectives of this study were to determine the prevalence of HIV/HCV coinfection 
and the pattern of hematological and biochemical abnormalities associated with 
such dual infection.
METHODS: In this study, patients with HIV infection (cases) were tested for 
anti-HCV antibodies. There was a control group made up of apparently healthy 
individuals who came to hospital for medical examination for various reasons. 
They also had an anti-HCV antibody test. Those who tested positive for anti-HCV 
antibodies among the cases and control subjects were further evaluated for 
hemoglobin concentration, total white cell count, platelet count, and liver 
function.
RESULTS: One hundred and eighty HIV-infected patients and 180 control subjects 
participated in the study. The seroprevalence of anti-HCV antibodies in the 
HIV-infected patients and control subjects were 6.7% and 4.4%, respectively (P = 
0.57). Serum total bilirubin, conjugated bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase 
were significantly higher in the HIV/HCV coinfected patients compared with their 
HCV monoinfected counterparts (P = 0.0396, 0.0001, and 0.0016, respectively). 
The mean hemoglobin, white cell count, platelet count, and CD4+ T lymphocyte 
count were significantly lower in the HIV/HCV coinfected patients than the HCV 
monoinfected control group (P = 0.0082, 0.0133, 0.0031, and 0.0001, 
respectively).
CONCLUSION: The seroprevalence of anti-HCV antibodies in HIV-infected Nigerian 
patients is 6.7%. Patients with HIV/HCV coinfection have lower blood counts, 
higher serum bilirubin, and higher serum alkaline phosphatase compared with 
patients having HCV monoinfection.

Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease 
that mainly targets the cholangiocytes of the interlobular bile ducts in the 
liver. It is a rare disease with prevalence of less than one in 2000. Its 
prevalence in developing countries is increasing presumably because of growth in 
recognition and knowledge of the disease. PBC is thought to result from a 
combination of multiple genetic factors and superimposed environmental triggers. 
The contribution of the genetic predisposition is evidenced by familial 
clustering. Several risk factors, including exposure to infectious agents and 
chemical xenobiotics, have been suggested. Common symptoms of the disease are 
fatigue and pruritus, but most patients are asymptomatic at first presentation. 
The prognosis of PBC has improved because of early diagnosis and use of 
ursodeoxycholic acid, the only established medical treatment for this disorder. 
When administered at adequate doses of 13-15 mg/kg/day, up to two out of three 
patients with PBC may have a normal life expectancy without additional 
therapeutic measures. However, some patients do not respond adequately to 
ursodeoxycholic acid and might need alternative therapeutic approaches.

BACKGROUND: Combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) has significantly increased 
survival among HIV-positive adults in the United States (U.S.) and Canada, but 
gains in life expectancy for this region have not been well characterized. We 
aim to estimate temporal changes in life expectancy among HIV-positive adults on 
ART from 2000-2007 in the U.S. and Canada.
METHODS: Participants were from the North American AIDS Cohort Collaboration on 
Research and Design (NA-ACCORD), aged ≥20 years and on ART. Mortality rates were 
calculated using participants' person-time from January 1, 2000 or ART 
initiation until death, loss to follow-up, or administrative censoring December 
31, 2007. Life expectancy at age 20, defined as the average number of additional 
years that a person of a specific age will live, provided the current 
age-specific mortality rates remain constant, was estimated using abridged life 
tables.
RESULTS: The crude mortality rate was 19.8/1,000 person-years, among 22,937 
individuals contributing 82,022 person-years and 1,622 deaths. Life expectancy 
increased from 36.1 [standard error (SE) 0.5] to 51.4 [SE 0.5] years from 
2000-2002 to 2006-2007. Men and women had comparable life expectancies in all 
periods except the last (2006-2007). Life expectancy was lower for individuals 
with a history of injection drug use, non-whites, and in patients with baseline 
CD4 counts <350 cells/mm(3).
CONCLUSIONS: A 20-year-old HIV-positive adult on ART in the U.S. or Canada is 
expected to live into their early 70 s, a life expectancy approaching that of 
the general population. Differences by sex, race, HIV transmission risk group, 
and CD4 count remain.

Two large, randomized studies have demonstrated a prostate cancer-specific 
survival benefit to prostate cancer screening using the prostate-specific 
antigen (PSA) assay. Yet, the US Preventive Services Task Force recently 
recommended against PSA-based screening for prostate cancer, claiming it results 
in more harm than good, given concerns regarding overtreatment. The purpose of 
this article is to characterize the patients with colorectal cancer who are most 
likely to benefit from PSA-based screening for prostate cancer. Because the 
survival benefit due to PSA-based screening does not manifest until 7 years 
after screening is initiated, we conclude that PSA screening is most appropriate 
for men with a remaining life expectancy of at least 10 years. Accordingly, 
younger men with stage I-II colorectal cancers at diagnosis (or stage III 
colorectal cancer that has not recurred 5 years after treatment) who have no or 
minimal comorbidities and who are at increased risk for either a diagnosis of 
prostate cancer or mortality secondary to prostate cancer (patients who have a 
positive family history or are African-American, respectively) are most likely 
to experience more good outcomes than harmful ones as a result of undergoing 
PSA-based screening.

The contributions of diseases to disability burden among the elderly population 
in China.

Chen H(1), Wang H, Crimmins EM, Chen G, Huang C, Zheng X.

Author information:
(1)Peking University, Beijing, China.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the contributions of diseases to disability burden among 
older persons in China.
METHOD: Based on the 2006 China Disability Survey (n = 354,859), we used the 
attribution method and Sullivan method to obtain disability prevalence and life 
expectancy with disability (LED) by disease, respectively.
RESULTS: At disease group level, ear, eye, circulatory and musculoskeletal 
diseases, injury, and poisoning were the five leading causes of disability 
burden in terms of their contributions to disability prevalence and LED. At 
individual disease level, presbycusis, cataracts, cerebrovascular disease, 
osteoarthritis, and unclassified injuries were the five leading conditions, 
which accounted for 64% of disabilities and caused males and females aged 60 to 
have 3.04 and 3.76 years of LED, respectively.
DISCUSSION: Along with the epidemiologic transition, chronic conditions have 
become the predominant contributor to disability burden among elderly persons in 
China. And, presbycusis, cataracts, cerebrovascular disease, osteoarthritis, and 
unclassified injuries should be the priorities in ameliorating disability.

Men's health promotion interventions: what have we learned from previous 
programmes.

Author information:
(1)Centre for Men's Health, Leeds Metropolitan University.

Concern persists in health-related literature about men's reduced life 
expectancy and higher premature death rates; this is often linked to 
difficulties in engaging with men as a client group. However, some innovative 
projects and programmes, often led by health visitors or other community based 
nurses, have developed successful health promotion work with men. This article 
collates existing tacit knowledge (previous learning) about men's health 
interventions by integrating interview data from nine practitioners who have 
established such initiatives with data from 35 men's health project reports to 
consider 'what works'. Five themes stood out as being significant across the 
data reviewed: using the right setting (often outside statutory services); 
ensuring the right approach (drawing on male-specific interests and language); 
actively listening to what local men say; appropriate training (initial and 
ongoing) for those involved in such work; and partnership working with local 
community groups, businesses and statutory service providers. While not a 
panacea for working with any and all men, these themes form a good basis for 
successful engagement with men and align well with what a recent review of 
health visitor interventions suggest works in helping bridge service 
provision-uptake gaps.

Lifespan effects of simple and complex nutraceutical combinations fed 
isocalorically to mice.

Present data suggest that the consumption of individual dietary supplements does 
not enhance the health or longevity of healthy rodents or humans. It might be 
argued that more complex combinations of such agents might extend lifespan or 
health-span by more closely mimicking the complexity of micronutrients in fruits 
and vegetables, which appear to extend health-span and longevity. To test this 
hypothesis we treated long-lived, male, F1 mice with published and commercial 
combinations of dietary supplements and natural product extracts, and determined 
their effects on lifespan and health-span. Nutraceutical, vitamin or mineral 
combinations reported to extend the lifespan or health-span of healthy or 
enfeebled rodents were tested, as were combinations of botanicals and 
nutraceuticals implicated in enhanced longevity by a longitudinal study of human 
aging. A cross-section of commercial nutraceutical combinations sold as 
potential health enhancers also were tested, including Bone Restore®, Juvenon®, 
Life Extension Mix®, Ortho Core®, Ortho Mind®, Super K w k2®, and Ultra K2®. A 
more complex mixture of vitamins, minerals, botanical extracts and other 
nutraceuticals was compounded and tested. No significant increase in murine 
lifespan was found for any supplement mixture. Our diverse supplement mixture 
significantly decreased lifespan. Thus, our results do not support the 
hypothesis that simple or complex combinations of nutraceuticals, including 
antioxidants, are effective in delaying the onset or progress of the major 
causes of death in mice. The results are consistent with epidemiological studies 
suggesting that dietary supplements are not beneficial and even may be harmful 
for otherwise healthy individuals.
