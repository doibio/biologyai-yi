We propose a general analytical framework to model the redistributive features 
of alternative pension systems when individuals face ex ante differences in 
mortality. Differences in life expectancy between high and low socioeconomic 
groups are often large and have widened recently in many countries. Such 
longevity gaps affect the actuarial fairness and progressivity of public pension 
systems. However, behavioral responses to longevity and policy complicate 
analysis of possible reforms. Here we consider how various pension systems would 
perform in an OLG setting with heterogeneous longevity and ability. We evaluate 
redistributive effects of three Notional Defined Contribution plans and three 
Defined Benefit plans, calibrated on the US case. Compared to a benchmark 
non-redistributive plan that accounts for differences in mortality, US Social 
Security reduces regressivity from longevity differences, but would require 
group-specific life tables to achieve progressivity. Moreover, without separate 
life tables, despite apparent accounting gains, lower income groups would suffer 
welfare losses and higher income groups would enjoy welfare gains through 
indirect effects of pension systems on labor supply.

OBJECTIVE: Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women and one in ten 
patients affected are over age 80. However, this age group is mostly excluded 
from clinical trials and data to inform their care is sparse.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medical records of all patients aged 80 years-old and 
older diagnosed and treated for breast cancer in a single center over a six-year 
period were retrospectively reviewed. A cohort of patients aged 65 to 75 treated 
for breast cancer at the same center during the same period was also reviewed 
for comparison.
RESULTS: Patients in the 80 and over age group were commonly diagnosed with 
stage II or III disease (39.2%) compared to younger patients who were diagnosed 
more commonly (61.6%) with stage I disease. Sub-types of breast cancer had a 
similar representation in the two groups. Hormonal therapy was used equally in 
the two groups, but significantly fewer patients in the 80 and over age group 
had radiation therapy and chemotherapy as part of their treatment. Despite these 
differences, recurrence rates were not significantly different between the two 
groups.
CONCLUSION: Individualized treatments taking into consideration the patient's 
general status, comorbidities and life expectancy are feasible in the older 
breast cancer population and result in outcomes similar to those of younger 
patients in the short and intermediate terms.

BACKGROUND: Current guidelines for transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) 
recommend that TAVR should be performed in patients with a life 
expectancy > 1 year. However, it is challenging to estimate the patients' life 
expectancy because it is related to various factors, including frailty and 
nutritional status.
HYPOTHESIS: A new risk model can estimate the prognosis of patients after TAVR.
METHODS: We randomly divided 388 patients with aortic stenosis (AS) undergoing 
TAVR from October 2009 to August 2016 into two groups (2:1 ratio; training 
cohort, 259; validation cohort, 129). Using 94 baseline factors in the training 
cohort, we developed possible scoring models by the Cox proportional hazard 
regression model with the overall survival as the endpoint. Then, 
cross-validated 5-year C-statistics were calculated to assess the accuracy of 
the model.
RESULTS: Of 94 baseline factors, 12 factors were finally identified (5-year 
C-statistics in the training cohort: 0.709)-age, gender, body mass index, left 
ventricular ejection fraction, % vital capacity, forced expiratory volume 1.0 
(s) %, albumin, hemoglobin, creatine, platelet, creatine kinase, and prothrombin 
time-international normalized ratio. The cross-validated 1-, 3-, and 5-year 
C-statistics in the validation cohort were 0.792, 0.758, and 0.778, 
respectively. Furthermore, calibration plots in the validation cohort revealed 
that 5-year survival is well predicted (r = 0.962).
CONCLUSIONS: The new survival prediction model after TAVR could provide 
appropriate guidance during decision making regarding the TAVR implementation.

PURPOSE: Both laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) and liraglutide cause a 
significant weight loss. We evaluated the effect of liraglutide in comparison 
with placebo on total weight loss (TWL) and excess body weight loss (EWL) and 
when added in initial weight loss period after LSG in obese individuals.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Participants with BMI > 30 kg/m2 undergoing LSG were 
randomised to receive either liraglutide (subcutaneous) in increasing does of 
0.6 mg/day until maximum tolerated dose of 3.0 mg (L-L group) or placebo (L-P 
group) from 6 weeks post-operative until 6 months. Weight, BMI, %TWL, %EWL, 
HbA1c, fasting plasma glucose, HOMA-IR, resolution of type 2 diabetes mellitus, 
hypertension, dyslipidaemia, sleep apnea and quality of life were evaluated. 
Primary end point was %TWL and % EWL at post-operative 6 months.
RESULTS: Thirty participants underwent LSG, and 23 were randomised to receive 
liraglutide (n = 12) or placebo (n = 11).The mean dose of liraglutide in L-L 
group was 1.41 ± 0.49 mg/day. Patients in L-L group had %TWL of 28.2 ± 5.7 and 
%EWL of 58.7 ± 14.3 as compared with 23.2 ± 6.2 (p = 0.116) and 44.5 ± 8.6 
(p = 0.043) in L-P group at 24 weeks, respectively. BMI decreased by 11.7 ± 3.5 
in L-L group compared with 9.5 ± 4.0 in L-P group (p = 0.287). All patients with 
diabetes or pre-diabetes had resolution of dysglycemia in the L-L group as 
compared with 50% in L-P group. However, there was no significant difference in 
resolution of other obesity-related comorbidities between two groups at 24-week 
follow-up.
CONCLUSION: Liraglutide added early after LSG significantly augments weight loss 
from LSG in obese individuals.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study protocol was registered at clinical trials.gov.in 
with NCT: 04325581.

Monitoring survival of cancer patients using data collected by population-based 
cancer registries is an important component of cancer control. In this setting, 
patient survival is often summarized using net survival, that is survival from 
cancer if there were no other possible causes of death. Although net survival is 
the gold standard for comparing survival between groups or over time, it is less 
relevant for understanding the anticipated real-world prognosis of patients. In 
this review, we explain statistical concepts targeted towards patients, 
clinicians and healthcare professionals that summarize cancer patient survival 
under the assumption that other causes of death exist. Specifically, we explain 
the appropriate use, interpretation and assumptions behind statistical methods 
for competing risks, loss in life expectancy due to cancer and conditional 
survival. These concepts are relevant when producing statistics for risk 
communication between physicians and patients, planning for use of healthcare 
resources, or other applications when consideration of both cancer outcomes and 
the competing risks of death is required. To reinforce the concepts, we use 
Swedish population-based data of patients diagnosed with cancer of the breast, 
prostate, colon and chronic myeloid leukaemia. We conclude that when choosing 
between summary measures of survival it is critical to characterize the purpose 
of the study and to determine the nature of the hypothesis under investigation. 
The choice of terminology and style of reporting should be carefully adapted to 
the target audience and may range from summaries for specialist readers of 
scientific publications to interactive online tools aimed towards lay persons.

BACKGROUND: The present study aimed to update the methodology to estimate 
cause-specific disability weight (DW) for the calculation of disability adjusted 
life year (DALY) and health-adjusted life expectancy (HALE) based on the opinion 
of medical professional experts. Furthermore, the study also aimed to compare 
and assess the size of DW according to two analytical methods and estimate the 
most valid DW from the perspective of years lost due to disability and HALE 
estimation.
METHODS: A self-administered web-based survey was conducted ranking five causes 
of disease. A total of 901 participants started the survey and response data of 
806 participants were used in the analyses. In the process of rescaling 
predicted probability to DW on a scale from 0 to 1, two models were used for two 
groups: Group 1 (physicians and medical students) and Group 2 (nurses and 
oriental medical doctors). In Model 1, predicted probabilities were rescaled 
according to the normal distribution of DWs. In Model 2, the natural logarithms 
of predicted probabilities were rescaled according to the asymmetric 
distribution of DWs.
RESULTS: We estimated DWs for a total of 313 causes of disease in each model and 
group. The mean of DWs according to the models in each group was 0.490 (Model 1 
in Group 1), 0.378 (Model 2 in Group 1), 0.506 (Model 1 in Group 2), and 0.459 
(Model 2 in Group 2), respectively. About two-thirds of the causes of disease 
had DWs of 0.2 to 0.4 in Model 2 in Group 1. In Group 2, but not in Group 1, 
there were some cases where the DWs had a reversed order of severity.
CONCLUSION: We attempted to calculate DWs of 313 causes of disease based on the 
opinions of various types of medical professionals using the previous analysis 
methods as well as the revised analysis method. The DWs from this study can be 
used to accurately estimate DALY and health life expectancy, such as HALE, in 
the Korean population.

BACKGROUND: Pharmacoeconomic evaluation is important for breast-cancer 
medications due to their high costs. To our knowledge, no systematic literature 
reviews of pharmacoeconomic studies for breast-cancer medication use are present 
in developing-countries.
OBJECTIVES: To systematically review the existing cost-effectiveness evaluations 
of breast-cancer medication in developing-countries.
METHODOLOGY: A systematic literature search was performed in PubMed, EMBASE, 
SCOPUS, and EconLit. Two researchers determined the final articles, extracted 
data, and evaluated their quality using the Quality of Health-Economic Studies 
(QHES) tool. The interclass-correlation-coefficient (ICC) was calculated to 
assess interrater-reliability. Data were summarized descriptively.
RESULTS: Fourteen pharmacoeconomic studies published from 2009 to 2019 were 
included. Thirteen used patient-life-years as their effectiveness unit, of which 
10 used quality-adjusted life-years. Most of the evaluations focused on 
trastuzumab as a single agent or on regimens containing trastuzumab (n = 10). 
The conclusion of cost-effectiveness analysis varied among the studies. All the 
studies were of high quality (QHES score >75). Interrater reliability between 
the two reviewers was high (ICC = 0.76).
CONCLUSION: In many studies included in the review, the use of breast-cancer 
drugs in developing countries was not cost-effective. Yet, more pharmacoeconomic 
evaluations for the use of recently approved agents in different disease stages 
are needed in developing countries.

BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic continues to challenge governments and 
policymakers worldwide. They have rightfully prioritised reducing the spread of 
the virus through social distancing interventions. However, shuttered business 
and widespread restrictions on travel and mobility have led to an economic 
collapse with increasing uncertainty of how quickly recovery will be achieved.
METHODS: The authors carried out a review of publicly available information on 
the economic intervention's countries have put in place to ameliorate the impact 
of COVID-19.
RESULTS: The strategies and scale of economic interventions have been broad, 
ranging from 2.5% to a reported 50% of Gross Domestic Product.
CONCLUSIONS: Numerous countries are beginning to ease lockdown restrictions and 
restart economies in different ways. There is therefore evolving, real-world 
data that should be used dynamically by governments and policymakers. The 
strategies on restarting the economy must be balanced against the uncertainty of 
a possible second wave of COVID-19. A nuanced approach to easing restrictions 
needs to take into account not only immediate risk to life but longer-term risks 
of widening inequalities and falling life expectancy.

PURPOSE: For years, traditional techniques have been used for diabetes 
treatment. There are two major types of insulin: insulin analogs and regular 
insulin. Insulin analogs are similar to regular insulin and lead to changes in 
pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties. The purpose of the present 
research was to determine the cost-effectiveness of insulin analogs versus 
regular insulin for diabetes control in Yazd Diabetes Center in 2017.
DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: In this descriptive-analytical research, the 
cost-effectiveness index was used to compare insulin analogs and regular insulin 
(pen/vial) for treatment of diabetes. Data were analyzed in the TreeAge Software 
and a decision tree was constructed. A 10% discount rate was used for ICER 
sensitivity analysis. Cost-effectiveness was examined from a provider's 
perspective.
FINDINGS: QALY was calculated to be 0.2 for diabetic patients using insulin 
analogs and 0.05 for those using regular insulin. The average cost was $3.228 
for analog users and $1.826 for regular insulin users. An ICER of $0.093506/QALY 
was obtained. The present findings suggest that insulin analogs are more 
cost-effective than regular insulin.
ORIGINALITY/VALUE: This study was conducted using a cost-effectiveness analysis 
to evaluate insulin analogs versus regular insulin in controlling diabetes. The 
results of study are helpful to the government to allocate more resources to 
apply the cost-effective method of the treatment and to protect patients with 
diabetes from the high cost of treatment.

Tehran, Iran.

BACKGROUND: The aim of this paper is to present a synthesis of solutions for 
post-graduate medical education (PGME) and the health-care system in addressing 
challenges in relation to women's health.
METHODS: A critical review was conducted within three themes: women's health 
status, women's preferences for female physicians, and women in surgery. The 
study was conducted in two phases that consisted of an analysis of the trends of 
Iranian women's health and women's participation in PGME since 1979 followed by 
a thematic analysis to assess the current challenges and their implications on 
medical education.
RESULTS: Our analysis revealed important trends and challenges. Since 1979, life 
expectancy has increased by 29% in Iranian women, while female adult mortality 
rate has decreased by 78%, and maternal mortality rate has decreased by 80%. The 
number of female medical specialists has increased by 933% , while the number of 
female subspecialists has increased by 1700%. According to our review, ten major 
challenges regarding women's health were identified: 1) Increase in chronic 
disease; 2) Increase in cancer cases; 3) Preference for same-gender physicians 
in sensitive procedures; 4) Delayed care-seeking due to lack of female surgeons; 
5) Lack of gender-concordance in clinical settings; 6) Underestimating female 
surgeons' capabilities; 7) Female physicians' work-family conflicts; 8) 
Male-dominancy in surgical departments; 9) Women's under-representation in 
higher rank positions; and 10) Lack of women in academic leadership.
CONCLUSION: We identified different solutions to bridge these gaps. 
Community-based education, Gender- concordant considerations, and empowering 
women in surgical departments could help medical education policy makers to 
address the challenges.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of changes in elective Abdominal Aortic 
Aneurysm (AAA) management on life-expectancy of AAA patients.
BACKGROUND: Over the past decades AAA repair underwent substantial changes, that 
is, the introduction of EVAR and implementation of intensified cardiovascular 
risk management. The question rises to what extent these changes improved 
longevity of AAA patients.
METHODS: National evaluation including all 12.907 (82.7% male) patients who 
underwent elective AAA repair between 2001 and 2015 in Sweden. The impact of 
changes in AAA management was established by a time-resolved analysis based on 3 
timeframes: open repair dominated period (2001-2004, n = 2483), transition 
period (2005-2011, n = 6230), and EVAR-first strategy period (2012-2015, n = 
4194). Relative survival was used to quantify AAA-associated mortality, and to 
adjust for changes in life-expectancy.
RESULTS: Relative survival of electively treated AAA patients was stable and 
persistently compromised [4-year relative survival and 95% confidence interval: 
0.87 (0.85-0.89), 0.87 (0.86-0.88), 0.89 (0.86-0.91) for the 3 periods, 
respectively]. Particularly alarming is the severely compromised survival of 
female patients (4-year relative survival females 0.78, 0.80, 0.70 vs males 
0.89, 0.89, 0.91, respectively). Cardiovascular mortality remained the main 
cause of death (51.0%, 47.2%, 47.9%) and the proportion cardiovascular disease 
over non-cardiovascular disease death was stable over time.
CONCLUSIONS: Changes in elective AAA management reduced short-term mortality, 
but failed to improve the profound long-term survival disadvantage of AAA 
patients. The persistent high (cardiovascular) mortality calls for further 
intensification of cardiovascular risk management, and a critical appraisal of 
the basis for the excess mortality of AAA patients.

Despite improvements in life expectancy, there is uncertainty on whether the 
increase in years of healthy life expectancy has kept pace. In this paper we 
explore whether there is empirical support for the expansion of morbidity 
hypothesis in the population aged 25-64 living in England. Nationally 
representative cohorts born between 1945 and 1980 are constructed from repeated 
annual cross-sections of the Health Survey for England, 1991-2014. Later-born 
cohorts at a given age have the same or higher prevalence of self-reported bad 
general health and long-term illness, self-reported high blood pressure (in 
men), self-reported and objectively-measured diabetes, circulatory illnesses, 
clinical hypertension, and overweight BMI. We also find that healthy life 
expectancies (in the sense of absence of each of these problems) at age 25 have 
increased at a slower pace than life expectancy between 1993 and 2013. Our 
findings lend support to the expansion of morbidity hypothesis and point to 
increased future demand for specific healthcare services at younger ages.

The ubiquitin (Ub)-conjugating enzyme variants (Uev) Uev1A and Mms2 interact 
with Ubc13 to form heterodimeric complexes with different biological functions. 
Uev1A-Ubc13 is involved in NF-κB activation while Mms2-Ubc13 is required for the 
DNA-damage response. The structural comparison of the core domains of these two 
Uevs reveals no obvious difference, suggesting that the amino terminal extension 
of Uev1A plays a critical role in the functional determination. Indeed, 
truncated Uev1A lacking the N-terminal extension behaves like Mms2, while a 
chimeric protein containing the N-terminal Uev1A fused to Mms2 functionally 
resembles Uev1A. Interestingly, the N-terminal extension of Uev1A also dictates 
whether to assemble di- or poly-Ub chains in an in vitro reaction. Both 
thermodynamic measurements and enzymatic assays revealed that the Uev1A 
N-terminal extension weakens the Uev-Ubc13 interaction; however, other means 
capable of causing a reduced Uev1A-Ubc13 affinity and poly-Ub chain assembly do 
not necessarily promote NF-κB activation, indicating that the poly-Ub chain 
formation is not the only component contributed by the N-terminal extension of 
Uev1A. The physiological relevance of the Uev1A N-terminal truncation is 
presented and discussed.

INTRODUCTION: Current evidence on the association between COVID-19 and dementia 
is sparse. This study aims to investigate the associations between COVID-19 
caseload and the burden of dementia.
METHODS: We gathered data regarding burden of dementia (disability-adjusted life 
years [DALYs] per 100,000), life expectancy, and healthy life expectancy (HALE) 
from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2017 study. We obtained COVID-19 data 
from Our World in Data database. We analyzed the association of COVID-19 cases 
and deaths with the burden of dementia using Spearman's rank correlation 
coefficient.
RESULTS: Globally, we found significant positive (p < .001) correlations between 
life expectancy (r = 0.60), HALE (r = 0.58), and dementia DALYs (r = 0.46) with 
COVID-19 caseloads. Likewise, we found similar correlations between life 
expectancy (r = 0.60), HALE (r = 0.58) and dementia DALYs (r = 0.54) with 
COVID-19 mortality.
CONCLUSION: Health policymakers should clarify a targeted model of disease 
surveillance in order to reduce the dual burden of dementia and COVID-19.

Extensive documentation is available on plant essential oils as a potential 
source of antimicrobials, including natural drugs against Candida spp. Yeasts of 
the genus Candida are responsible for various clinical manifestations, from 
mucocutaneous overgrowth to bloodstream infections, whose incidence and 
mortality rates are increasing because of the expanding population of 
immunocompromised patients. In the last decade, although C. albicans is still 
regarded as the most common species, epidemiological data reveal that the global 
distribution of Candida spp. has changed, and non-albicans species of Candida 
are being increasingly isolated worldwide. The present study aimed to review the 
anti-Candida activity of essential oils collected from 100 species of the 
Lamiaceae family growing in the Mediterranean area and the Middle East. An 
overview is given on the most promising essential oils and constituents 
inhibiting Candida spp. growth, with a particular focus for those natural 
products able to reduce the expression of virulence factors, such as 
yeast-hyphal transition and biofilm formation. Based on current knowledge on 
members of the Lamiaceae family, future recommendations to strengthen the value 
of these essential oils as antimicrobial agents include pathogen selection, with 
an extension towards the new emerging Candida spp. and toxicological screening, 
as it cannot be taken for granted that plant-derived products are void of 
potential toxic and/or carcinogenic properties.

Hairy polyps, also known as dermoid polyps (DPs), are rare benign cystic lesions 
of bigerminal origin that may occur in several head and neck regions, including 
the oropharynx. Despite their benign histopathological nature, DPs may be life 
threatening, due to their upper airway location, and DPs represent one of the 
most unusual causes of respiratory distress during the neonatal period. In this 
paper, we describe a case of respiratory failure in a newborn with an 
oropharyngeal mass that was accidentally found during difficult intubation. 
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) detected a well-defined soft tissue 
pedunculated mass, arising from the left oropharynx wall, consistent with an 
oropharyngeal DP. The newborn had a prompt recovery after trans-oral mass 
removal. Our case underlines the importance of imaging in differential diagnosis 
of children's respiratory distress, secondary to a variety of lesions within the 
region of the skull base or oropharynx. It allowed us to assess the origin of 
the lesion, as well as its relationship with the adjacent soft tissues, and to 
exclude intracranial extension, thus providing essential information for the 
surgical planning.

South Korea's suicide rate has remained among the highest in the world for some 
years, and there is also a gap in suicide rates among regions within the 
country. This study investigates the differences in years of life lost (YLLs) 
due to suicide in 250 districts and the factors associated with regional YLLs in 
South Korea in 2016. The relationships between YLLs due to suicide by region and 
factors such as population characteristics, health behaviors, socioeconomic 
factors, and mental health resources in the community were examined through 
multiple linear regression analysis. The gap between districts with the highest 
and lowest YLL due to suicide per 100,000 people was more than a 7-times 
difference. Factors related to YLLs due to suicide by region were physical 
activity rates and community mental healthcare centers, and there were 
differences in these factors according to gender. In conclusion, to prevent 
suicide at the community level, it is necessary to consider gender in 
establishing intervention strategies. The community needs to play an active role 
in promoting mental health and reducing suicide among local residents and to 
continue to invest in the support and management of those at high risk of 
suicide.

INTRODUCTION: Our understanding of the mechanism of action of bioactive small 
molecules contributes to the research and development of new medical drugs, as 
well as elucidating the pathological mechanisms underlying various diseases. 
Researchers in this field are committed to a very ambitious goal: the discovery 
of novel therapeutic compounds along with their molecular targets. To achieve 
this goal, new methodological developments are indispensable.
AREAS COVERED: This review gives an update on the advancements of phage display 
(PD) technology in the past decade (2011-2020) for determining the targets of 
the small molecule therapeutics. In particular, other than providing a brief 
overview of this field of research, we focus on reporting the research trends 
and the results solely obtained using this strategy.
EXPERT OPINION: Despite the development of bioinformatics tools and artificial 
intelligence (AI)-mediated methods, affinity-guided information obtained 
experimentally are still indispensable to identify drug-protein interactions. By 
taking advantage of small-molecule-oriented PD methods and their improvements, 
the extension of the druggable proteome will be further expanded, providing new 
opportunities to generate small-molecule therapeutics.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the most cost-effective reconstruction method after 
salvage total laryngectomy.
STUDY DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis.
SETTING: Tertiary care hospitals with head and neck oncologic and reconstructive 
surgeons.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We constructed a Markov-based decision model to compare 
reconstruction by primary closure to pectoralis flap and free flap after salvage 
total laryngectomy. The model simulated disease with transition probabilities 
and health utilities found in primary literature and estimated the average 
overall cost of each reconstructive method using Medicare billing codes. 
Effectiveness was compared using quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). One-way 
and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to scrutinize the 
conclusions of our model. Reconstruction methods were compared using incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). In the United States, less than $150,000 per 
QALY gained is considered cost-effective (2019 US dollars).
RESULTS: Our base case analysis revealed that primary closure was less expensive 
($44,370) and yielded more QALYs (0.91) than both pectoralis ($45,163, 0.81 
QALYs) and free flap ($46,244, 0.85 QALYs), making it the most cost-effective 
option. Between flaps, free flap was cost-effective over pectoralis flap (ICER = 
$27,025/QALY gained). Sensitivity analyses showed primary closure as 
cost-effective 69% of the time over either flap. These conclusions were 
sensitive to the health utilities (quality of life) of each method of 
reconstruction.
CONCLUSION: Tissue flaps to augment closure after salvage total laryngectomy are 
not always the most cost-effective reconstructive option. The long-term 
morbidity of flap surgery oftentimes outweighs the benefit of lowering fistula 
rates after surgery. Careful consideration must be taken when advising patients 
of their reconstructive options.

Vast improvements in the survival rates following burn injuries has led to a 
greater number of patients living with a wide range of long-term impairments, 
activity limitations, and participation constraints. Therefore, long-term care 
is critical in this clinical population and necessitates appropriate 
rehabilitation strategies to maximize an individual's overall health. The 
purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that the extent to which 
outcomes within the International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and 
Health (ICF) framework are improved following 6 months of unsupervised exercise 
training is influenced by the severity of a burn injury (i.e., percent body 
surface area injured). Outcome variables representing the dimensions of the ICF, 
body functions & structure, activity, and participation, were collected pre- and 
post- 6 months of exercise training in three groups of participants: non-injured 
control subjects (N = 11), subjects with moderate-level well-healed burn 
injuries (N = 13, 26 ± 6% body surface area burned), and subjects with 
high-level well-healed burn injuries (N = 20, 58 ± 15% body surface area 
burned). Exercise training improved lower extremity strength (changes in peak 
torque/kg body mass at 90 degrees/sec flexion: 30 ± 5% and extension: 36 ± 4%, p 
< 0.05) and functional activities (changes in sit to stand: -9 ± 4% and ascend 
stairs: -4 ± 1%; p < 0.05) in all groups. For outcome variables representing ICF 
levels of body functions & structure and activity, there were no differences at 
baseline or improvements made between the groups after training. That said, with 
the exception of the domain of functional activity (reported 17 ± 34% 
improvement in the high-level burn cohort, p < 0.05), no changes were revealed 
in the participation level of ICF indexed by health-related quality of life 
questionnaires. These findings support the utilization of a 6-month unsupervised 
exercise training program in the long-term rehabilitation of individuals with 
burn injuries; that is, improvements in body functions & structure and activity 
can be achieved with an exercise regimen regardless of the severity of burn 
injury.
