BACKGROUND: There have been no licensed treatment options in the UK for treating 
thrombocytopenia in people with chronic liver disease requiring surgery. 
Established management largely involves platelet transfusion prior to the 
procedure or as rescue therapy for bleeding due to the procedure.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of two 
thrombopoietin receptor agonists, avatrombopag (Doptelet®; Dova Pharmaceuticals, 
Durham, NC, USA) and lusutrombopag (Mulpleta®; Shionogi Inc., London, UK), in 
addition to established clinical management compared with established clinical 
management (no thrombopoietin receptor agonist) in the licensed populations.
DESIGN: Systematic review and cost-effectiveness analysis.
SETTING: Secondary care.
PARTICIPANTS: Severe thrombocytopenia (platelet count of < 50,000/µl) in people 
with chronic liver disease requiring surgery.
INTERVENTIONS: Lusutrombopag 3 mg and avatrombopag (60 mg if the baseline 
platelet count is < 40,000/µl and 40 mg if it is 40,000-< 50,000/µl).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Risk of platelet transfusion and rescue therapy or risk 
of rescue therapy only.
REVIEW METHODS: Systematic review including meta-analysis. English-language and 
non-English-language articles were obtained from several databases including 
MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, all searched 
from inception to 29 May 2019.
ECONOMIC EVALUATION: Model-based cost-effectiveness analysis.
RESULTS: From a comprehensive search retrieving 11,305 records, six studies were 
included. Analysis showed that avatrombopag and lusutrombopag were superior to 
no thrombopoietin receptor agonist in avoiding both platelet transfusion and 
rescue therapy or rescue therapy only, and mostly with a statistically 
significant difference (i.e. 95% confidence intervals not overlapping the point 
of no difference). However, only avatrombopag seemed to be superior to no 
thrombopoietin receptor agonist in reducing the risk of rescue therapy, although 
far fewer patients in the lusutrombopag trials than in the avatrombopag trials 
received rescue therapy. When assessing the cost-effectiveness of lusutrombopag 
and avatrombopag, it was found that, despite the success of these in avoiding 
platelet transfusions prior to surgery, the additional long-term gain in 
quality-adjusted life-years was very small. No thrombopoietin receptor agonist 
was clearly cheaper than both lusutrombopag and avatrombopag, as the cost 
savings from avoiding platelet transfusions were more than offset by the drug 
cost. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that, for all thresholds 
below £100,000, no thrombopoietin receptor agonist had 100% probability of being 
cost-effective.
LIMITATIONS: Some of the rescue therapy data for lusutrombopag were not 
available. There were inconsistencies in the avatrombopag data. From the 
cost-effectiveness point of view, there were several additional important gaps 
in the evidence required, including the lack of a price for avatrombopag.
CONCLUSIONS: Avatrombopag and lusutrombopag were superior to no thrombopoietin 
receptor agonist in avoiding both platelet transfusion and rescue therapy, but 
they were not cost-effective given the lack of benefit and increase in cost.
FUTURE WORK: A head-to-head trial is warranted.
STUDY REGISTRATION: This study is registered as PROSPERO CRD42019125311.

Plain Language Summary: Thrombocytopenia, which is a reduction in platelet 
numbers in the blood, is a common complication of chronic liver disease. It 
increases the risk of bleeding during procedures including liver biopsy and 
transplantation. It can delay or prevent procedures, leading to illness and 
death. Established treatment largely involves platelet transfusion before the 
procedure or as rescue therapy for bleeding. This report aims to systematically 
review the clinical effectiveness and estimate the cost-effectiveness of the 
first two recently licensed treatments, thrombopoietin receptor agonists 
avatrombopag (Doptelet®; Dova Pharmaceuticals, Durham, NC, USA) (60 mg if 
platelet count is < 40,000/µl and 40 mg if platelet count is 40,000–< 50,000/µl) 
and lusutrombopag (Mulpleta®; Shionogi Inc., London, UK) (3 mg if platelet count 
is < 50,000/µl), compared with established treatment. From a comprehensive 
search, six studies were included. Clinical effectiveness analysis showed that 
avatrombopag and lusutrombopag were superior to no thrombopoietin receptor 
agonist in avoiding both platelet transfusion and rescue therapy. Only 
avatrombopag seemed superior to no thrombopoietin receptor agonist in reducing 
rescue therapy alone. Cost-effectiveness analysis found that lusutrombopag and 
avatrombopag were more expensive than no thrombopoietin receptor agonist over a 
lifetime, as the savings from avoiding platelet transfusions were exceeded by 
the drug cost, and without long-term health benefits. The probabilistic 
sensitivity analysis, which examined the effect of uncertainty, showed that no 
thrombopoietin receptor agonist had 100% probability of being cost-effective. 
Uncertainty about the price of avatrombopag and the content and costs of 
platelet transfusions and the potential under-reporting of use to estimate 
platelet transfusion-specific mortality had the greatest impact on results. If 
the price of avatrombopag was (confidential information has been removed) below 
the price of lusutrombopag, avatrombopag would become cost saving in the 
40,000–< 50,000/µl subgroup. However, although in some scenarios avatrombopag 
costs could decrease in the 40,000–< 50,000/µl subgroup to around 10% more than 
the cost of no thrombopoietin receptor agonist, there would be negligible health 
benefits and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios would remain very high, 
meaning that lusutrombopag and avatrombopag would still not be considered 
cost-effective.

OBJECTIVES: Burning mouth syndrome (BMS) is a long-lasting pain condition which 
is commonly associated with anxiety symptoms and experience of adverse, 
stressful life events have been reported by those diagnosed with the syndrome. 
Stress-related biomarkers have been related to personality traits in BMS and a 
personality with high stress susceptibility and perceived stress may be of 
importance. Although biopsychosocial approaches are suggested to manage 
long-lasting orofacial pain, to date little is known about physical activity in 
women with BMS. The aim of this study was to investigate if personality, 
perceived stress and physical activity distinguish women with BMS from controls.
METHODS: Fifty-six women with BMS and 56 controls matched on age and gender 
completed Swedish universities Scales of Personality (SSP), Perceived Stress 
Questionnaire (PSQ) and a general questionnaire with an item on weekly physical 
activity frequency. In addition, health-related quality of life was explored by 
additional questionnaires and reported in a companion article (Jedel et al. 
Scand J Pain. 2020. PubMed PMID: 32853174).
RESULTS: SSP subscales Somatic Trait Anxiety, Psychic Trait Anxiety, Stress 
Susceptibility and Verbal Trait Aggression differed between women with BMS and 
controls and the personality factor scores for Neuroticism and Aggressiveness 
were higher. Perceived stress measured by PSQ index was higher for women with 
BMS compared to controls. Women with BMS reported lower physical activity 
frequency compared to controls and those reporting physical activity 
<4 days/week scored higher on PSQ compared to those with weekly physical 
activity ≥4 days/week.
CONCLUSIONS: Personality distinguished women with BMS from controls in this 
study. Perceived stress was higher and weekly physical activity was lower in 
women with BMS compared to controls. Our findings suggest physical activity 
should be more comprehensively measured in future BMS studies and, by extension, 
physical activity may be a treatment option for women with BMS. Pain management 
aiming to restore function and mobility with stress reduction should be 
considered in clinical decision making for women with BMS who have a personality 
with stress susceptibility, especially if reporting high perceived stress and 
insufficient physical activity.

The frontal pole cortex (FPC) plays key roles in various higher-order functions 
and is highly developed in non-human primates. An essential missing piece of 
information is the detailed anatomical connections for finer parcellation of the 
macaque FPC than provided by the previous tracer results. This is important for 
understanding the functional architecture of the cerebral cortex. Here, 
combining cross-validation and principal component analysis, we formed a 
tractography-based parcellation scheme that applied a machine learning algorithm 
to divide the macaque FPC (2 males and 6 females) into eight subareas using 
high-resolution diffusion magnetic resonance imaging with the 9.4T Bruker 
system, and then revealed their subregional connections. Furthermore, we applied 
improved hierarchical clustering to the obtained parcels to probe the modular 
structure of the subregions, and found that the dorsolateral FPC, which contains 
an extension to the medial FPC, was mainly connected to regions of the 
default-mode network. The ventral FPC was mainly involved in the 
social-interaction network and the dorsal FPC in the metacognitive network. 
These results enhance our understanding of the anatomy and circuitry of the 
macaque brain, and contribute to FPC-related clinical research.

BACKGROUND: Decisions to limit treatment (DLTs) are important to protect 
patients from overtreatment but constitute one of the most ethically challenging 
situations in oncology practice. In the Ethics Policy for Advance Care Planning 
and Limiting Treatment study (EPAL), we examined how often DLT preceded a 
patient's death and how early they were determined before (T1) and after (T2) 
the implementation of an intrainstitutional ethics policy on DLT.
METHODS: This prospective quantitative study recruited 1.134 patients with 
haematological/oncological neoplasia in a period of 2×6 months at the University 
Hospital of Munich, Germany. Information on admissions, discharges, diagnosis, 
age, DLT, date and place of death, and time span between the initial 
determination of a DLT and the death of a patient was recorded using a 
standardised form.
RESULTS: Overall, for 21% (n=236) of the 1.134 patients, a DLT was made. After 
implementation of the policy, the proportion decreased (26% T1/16% T2). However, 
the decisions were more comprehensive, including more often the combination of 
'Do not resuscitate' and 'no intense care unit' (44% T1/64% T2). The median time 
between the determination of a DLT and the patient's death was similarly short 
with 6 days at a regular ward (each T1/T2) and 10.5/9 (T1/T2) days at a 
palliative care unit. For patients with solid tumours, the DLTs were made 
earlier at both regular and palliative care units than for the deceased with 
haematological neoplasia.
CONCLUSION: Our results show that an ethics policy on DLT could sensitise for 
treatment limitations in terms of frequency and extension but had no significant 
impact on timing of DLT. Since patients with haematological malignancies tend to 
undergo intensive therapy more often during their last days than patients with 
solid tumours, special attention needs to be paid to this group. To support 
timely discussions, we recommend the concept of advance care planning.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the Community Paramedicine at 
Clinic (CP@clinic) programme compared with usual care in seniors residing in 
subsidised housing.
DESIGN: A cost-utility analysis was conducted within a large pragmatic cluster 
randomised controlled trial (RCT). Subsidised housing buildings were matched by 
sociodemographics and location (rural/urban), and allocated to intervention 
(CP@clinic for 1 year) or control (usual care) via computer-assisted paired 
randomisation.
SETTING: Thirty-two subsidised seniors' housing buildings in Ontario.
PARTICIPANTS: Building residents 55 years and older.
INTERVENTION: CP@clinic is a weekly community paramedic-led, chronic disease 
prevention and health promotion programme in the building common areas. 
CP@clinic is free to residents and includes risk assessments, referrals to 
resources, and reports back to family physicians.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained, measured with 
EQ-5D-3L. QALYs were estimated using area-under-the curve over the 1-year 
intervention, controlling for preintervention utility scores and building 
pairings. Programme cost data were collected before and during implementation. 
Costs associated with emergency medical services (EMS) use were estimated. An 
incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) based on incremental costs and 
health outcomes between groups was calculated. Probabilistic sensitivity 
analysis using bootstrapping was performed.
RESULTS: The RCT included 1461 residents; 146 and 125 seniors completed the 
EQ-5D-3L in intervention and control buildings, respectively. There was a 
significant adjusted mean QALY gain of 0.03 (95% CI 0.01 to 0.05) for the 
intervention group. Total programme cost for implementing in five communities 
was $C128 462 and the reduction in EMS calls avoided an estimated $C256 583. The 
ICER was $C2933/QALY (bootstrapped mean ICER with Fieller's 95% CI was $4850 
($2246 to $12 396)) but could be even more cost effective after accounting for 
the EMS call reduction.
CONCLUSION: The CP@clinic ICER was well below the commonly used Canadian 
cost-utility threshold of $C50 000. CP@clinic scale-up across subsidised housing 
is feasible and could result in better health-related quality-of-life and 
reduced EMS use in low-income seniors.

BACKGROUND: The Health Resources and Services Administration's Ryan White 
HIV/AIDS Program provides services to more than half of all people diagnosed 
with HIV in the United States. We present and validate a mathematical model that 
can be used to estimate the long-term public health and cost impact of the 
federal program.
METHODS: We developed a stochastic, agent-based model that reflects the current 
HIV epidemic in the United States. The model simulates everyone's progression 
along the HIV care continuum, using 2 network-based mechanisms for HIV 
transmission: injection drug use and sexual contact. To test the validity of the 
model, we calculated HIV incidence, mortality, life expectancy, and lifetime 
care costs and compared the results with external benchmarks.
RESULTS: The estimated HIV incidence rate for men who have sex with men (502 per 
100,000 person years), mortality rate of all people diagnosed with HIV (1663 per 
100,000 person years), average life expectancy for individuals with low CD4 
counts not on antiretroviral therapy (1.52-3.78 years), and lifetime costs 
($362,385) all met our validity criterion of within 15% of external benchmarks.
CONCLUSIONS: The model represents a complex HIV care delivery system rather than 
a single intervention, which required developing solutions to several 
challenges, such as calculating need for and receipt of multiple services and 
estimating their impact on care retention and viral suppression. Our strategies 
to address these methodological challenges produced a valid model for assessing 
the cost-effectiveness of the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program.

The maintenance of genomic stability during the cell cycle of progenitor cells 
is essential for the faithful transmission of genetic information. Mutations in 
genes that ensure genome stability lead to human developmental syndromes. 
Mutations in Ataxia Telangiectasia and Rad3-related (ATR) or in ATR-interacting 
protein (ATRIP) lead to Seckel syndrome, which is characterized by developmental 
malformations and short life expectancy. While the roles of ATR in replicative 
stress response and chromosomal segregation are well established, it is unknown 
how ATRIP contributes to maintaining genomic stability in progenitor cells in 
vivo. Here, we generated the first mouse model to investigate ATRIP function. 
Conditional inactivation of Atrip in progenitor cells of the CNS and eye led to 
microcephaly, microphthalmia and postnatal lethality. To understand the 
mechanisms underlying these malformations, we used lens progenitor cells as a 
model and found that ATRIP loss promotes replicative stress and TP53-dependent 
cell death. Trp53 inactivation in Atrip-deficient progenitor cells rescued 
apoptosis, but increased mitotic DNA damage and mitotic defects. Our findings 
demonstrate an essential role of ATRIP in preventing DNA damage accumulation 
during unchallenged replication.

BACKGROUND: Alcohol and drug use (A&D) and dietary risks are two increasingly 
important risk factors. This study examines whether there is a relationship 
between the burden of these risk factors in countries of specific income bands 
as defined by the World Bank, and the number of primary studies included in 
Cochrane Systematic Reviews (CSRs) conducted in those countries.
METHODS: Data was extracted from primary studies included in CSRs assessing two 
risk factors as outcomes. For each risk factor, data was obtained on its overall 
burden in disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) by World Bank Income Levels and 
examined for a link between DALYs, the number of primary studies and 
participants.
RESULTS: A total of 1601 studies from 95 CSRs were included. Only 18.3% of the 
global burden for A&D is in high income-countries (HICs) but they produced 90.5% 
of primary studies and include 99.5% of participants. Only 14.2% of the dietary 
risk burden is in HICs but they produced 80.5% of primary studies and included 
98.1% of participants.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the unequal output of research heavily 
weighted towards HICs. More initiatives with informed contextual understanding 
are required to address this inequality and promote health research in low and 
middle-income countries.

BACKGROUND: Valvular heart disease (VHD) is expected to cause an increase in 
public-health problems in the coming years, especially in elderly populations. 
We aim to estimate the incidence, mortality, and burden of VHD, by age, from 
1990 to 2017 in 195 countries and territories.
METHODS: We estimated the incidence, mortality, and burden of VHD based on the 
Global Burden of Disease Study 2017. All metrics are presented with their 95% 
uncertainty intervals (UIs). The Socio-demographic Index was used to identify 
whether developmental status correlates with health outcomes.
RESULTS: The global incidence of rheumatic heart disease (RHD) decreased by 
8.67% between 1990 and 2017, while that of non-rheumatic VHD (NRVHD) increased 
by 45.10%. There was a 54.00% decrease in age-standardized death rate (ASDR) for 
RHD, but a small and non-significant decrease (-3.00%) in the ASDR for NRVHD. 
The global age-standardized disability-adjusted life years (DALY) rate of RHD 
decreased by 53.52%, while there was a 12.62% reduction in the age-standardized 
DALY rate of NRVHD.
CONCLUSIONS: The burden from different VHDs demonstrated a diverse change at a 
global level between 1990 and 2017. Although RHD burden has an obvious means of 
mitigation, a substantially high incidence of NRVHD was observed over this time 
period, especially in the elderly, which may lead to high health care costs and 
signify the potential for even higher costs in the future.

BACKGROUND: Life expectancy (LE) and healthy life expectancy (HALE) are 
indicators measuring the national health level. GAP is the difference between 
them. This study systematically analyzed and projected LE, HALE, and GAP across 
global regions from 1995 to 2025.
METHODS: We obtained the data of 195 countries/regions on their LE, HALE, and 
influencing factors from 1995 to 2017. We compared the overall changes of LE, 
HALE, and GAP. Multiple linear regression analysis examined relationships among 
LE, HALE, GAP, and the associated factors. Using the Autoregressive Integrated 
Moving Average (ARIMA) model, we projected trends in LE, HALE, and GAP for 
2017-2025.
RESULTS: During 1995-2017, LE, HALE, and their GAP in 195 countries/regions in 
the world showed overall increasing trends. Global average LE increased from 
66.20 to 72.98 years, HALE from 57.59 to 63.25 years, and GAP from 8.62 to 9.72 
years. LE and HALE in North America, Europe, and Australia were generally 
higher, while Africa had the lowest rates. Females' LE, HALE, and GAP were all 
higher than males', but females' growth rates of LE and HALE were lower. 
Different factors were included to project LE, HALE, and GAP, respectively, and 
prediction results showed that approximately 18% of the 195 countries/regions 
might achieve improved LE and HALE and lower GAP.
CONCLUSIONS: LE, HALE will likely continue to increase in most of countries and 
regions worldwide in the future and GAP will further expand. While striving to 
improve LE and HALE, more attention needs be made to reduce GAP and improve 
quality of life.

Sciences and Hospital, Jammu, J and K, India.

India.

BACKGROUND: India has the highest number of blind people globally, unoperated 
cataract being the most common cause of blindness and low vision. Although safe 
and effective cataract surgical techniques are available, the cataract burden 
continues to increase annually, due to the backlog of patients to be operated 
upon, and a growing number of cataract cases due to increased life expectancy.
AIM: To assess cataract surgical coverage (CSC) in a rural area of north India.
METHODS: A population-based cross-sectional study of CSC among adults (40 years 
and above) was carried out in two villages of a block in north India using a 
predesigned questionnaire, visual acuity assessment, and distant direct 
ophthalmoscopy. Based on the data obtained, CSC (VA <6/60) for both "persons" as 
well as "eyes" was calculated.
RESULTS: Overall, CSC (persons) of 43.20% was observed, 29.31% coverage among 
persons with unilateral cataract and 50.45% among persons with bilateral 
cataract while CSC (eyes) was found to be 37.14%, being significantly higher 
(43.56%) among females compared to males (28.21%) (P = 0.012). Around 50% of 
cataract surgeries were performed in private facilities, 41.35% in government 
facilities, and rest 8.65% in eye camps. Nearly 90.38% were implanted 
intraocular lens and 9.62% were non-intraocular lens surgeries.
CONCLUSIONS: Surgical needs for cataract are currently not being met 
effectively. Reasons for inadequate cataract surgical services need to be sought 
and addressed to improve the uptake of existing services. Further, reasons for 
underutilization of government hospitals for cataract surgeries need to be 
examined.

The majority of cancer diagnoses in pediatric solid organ transplant recipients 
(SOTRs) are post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLD) or skin 
cancers. However, pediatric SOTRs are also at significantly elevated risk for 
multiple other solid and hematological cancers. The risks of specific cancers 
vary by transplanted organ, underlying disease, and immunosuppression factors. 
More than one-quarter of pediatric SOTRs develop cancer within 30 years of 
transplantation and their risk of solid cancer is 14 times greater than the 
general population. Pediatric SOTRs are at significantly higher risk of 
cancer-associated death. Improving patient survival among pediatric SOTRs puts 
them at risk of adult epithelial cancers associated with environmental 
carcinogenic exposures. Vaccination against oncogenic viruses and avoidance of 
excessive immunosuppression may reduce the risk of solid cancers following 
transplantation. Patient and family education regarding photoprotection is an 
essential component of skin cancer prevention. There is significant variability 
in cancer screening recommendations for SOTRs and general population approaches 
are typically not validated for transplant populations. An individualized 
approach to cancer screening should be developed based on estimated cancer risk, 
patient life expectancy, and screening test performance.

We describe how the IBGE (Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística) was 
the cradle of the qualitative method in Brazil, through its National Study of 
Family Spending. This study analyzed the living conditions of the people of 
Brazil, sampling 55,311 individuals in the 1970s and merging quantitative and 
qualitative data. The effects of social inequality on malnutrition, infant 
mortality and life expectancy stood out: 62.7% of families had caloric deficit; 
40% suffered from shortage of food; there were 115 deaths per 1,000 live births 
and the life expectancy was 59 years. The IBGE coined the term "unstructured 
information" for the data, and the qualitative study shone light on and 
humanized the data collected. However, the military dictatorship prohibited its 
publication during the time of the so-called "Brazilian miracle."

Publisher: Analisa-se como o Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística 
(IBGE) foi o berço do método qualitativo no Brasil, por meio do Estudo Nacional 
da Despesa Familiar. Essa pesquisa analisou as condições de vida da população 
brasileira, numa amostra de 55.311 pessoas nos anos 1970, em que foram 
triangulados dados quantitativos e qualitativos. Evidenciaram-se os efeitos na 
desigualdade social sobre a desnutrição, a mortalidade infantil e a expectativa 
de vida: 62,7% das famílias possuíam deficiência calórica; 40%, penúria 
alimentar; havia 115 óbitos por mil nascidos vivos; e a expectativa de vida era 
de apenas 59 anos. Cunhado pelo IBGE como “informações não estruturadas”, o 
estudo qualitativo lançou luz sobre e humanizou os números coletados. Mas sua 
divulgação foi proibida pela ditadura militar, na época do chamado “milagre 
brasileiro”.

OBJECTIVE: To assess lipid peroxidation in pubescent adolescents with excess 
weight and the presence or absence of insulin resistance.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a descriptive, correlational and cross-sectional 
study carried out in 80 adolescents aged between 12 and 15 years. Lipid profile, 
oxidized LDL, 8-Isoprostane and LDL oxidation rates were estimated. BMI was 
determined and waist circumference was measured.
RESULTS: Overweight and insulin resistance adolescents showed a oxidized LDL, 
8-iso-prostane and oxidized LDL-C/HDL ratio higher than those who were 
overweight without insulin resistance and that the control group (p<0.05).
CONCLUSION: Adolescents with excess weight and insulin resistance showed higher 
concentrations of lipid peroxidation markers than the rest of the adolescents 
evaluated, which may imply a possible role of oxidative stress in the 
development of insulin resistance. These results highlight the importance of 
promoting good nutrition and healthy lifestyles to prevent these adolescents 
from becoming obese adults with associated comorbidities, affecting their 
quality of life and life expectancy.

Publisher: OBJETIVO: Evaluar la peroxidación lipídica en adolescentes púberes 
con exceso de peso y la presencia o no de resistencia a la insulina.
MÉTODOS: El estudio fue descriptivo, correlacional y transversal en 80 
adolescentes entre 12 y 15 años. Se determinó el perfil lipídico, LDL oxidada, 
8-Isoprostano y se estimaron los índices de oxidación de LDL. Se determinó el 
IMC y se midió la circunferencia de cintura.
RESULTADOS: Los adolescentes con exceso de peso y resistencia a la insulina 
mostraron la LDL oxidada, 8-isoprostano y el índice LDL oxidada/c-HDL superior a 
los de quienes tenían exceso de peso sin resistencia a la insulina y que el 
grupo control (p<0,05).
CONCLUSIÓN: Los adolescentes con exceso de peso y resistencia a la insulina 
mostraron mayores concentraciones de marcadores de peroxidación lipídica que el 
resto de los adolescentes evaluados, lo que implicaría un posible papel del 
estrés oxidativo en el desarrollo de la resistencia a la insulina. Estos 
resultados ponen de manifiesto la importancia de promover una buena alimentación 
y estilos de vida saludables para evitar que estos adolescentes se conviertan en 
adultos obesos con comorbilidades asociadas a la obesidad, lo cual afectarían su 
calidad y tiempo de vida.

BACKGROUND: Rising life expectancy in the western population is increasing the 
prevalence of heart valve diseases (HVD).
HYPOTHESIS: The level of awareness and initial screening for HVD should be 
sufficient. The potential impact of HVD on the daily activities of the elderly 
population in Europe might affect our society.
METHODS AND RESULTS: A survey was conducted, including a total of 12 832 people 
aged ≥ 60 years in 11 European countries. Of all the people surveyed, 5.6% could 
correctly describe aortic valve stenosis. Most participants (75.0%) claimed they 
regularly do activities like sports or social activities, 29.2% provide care for 
a family member, friend or acquaintance. The majority (69.2%) would be prevented 
from doing these activities by symptoms such as chest pain, fatigue or shortness 
of breath. Having chest pain (76.5%) and shortness of breath (57.8%) were 
reasons for most people to arrange an appointment with their GP, whereas only 
26.2% would visit a GP for fatigue. 67.6% of respondents claimed to be checked 
with a stethoscope by their GP occasionally, never, or only when they ask. The 
preferred treatment option for HVD is a keyhole procedure (45.8%), whereas open 
heart surgery would only be preferred by 7.0%.
CONCLUSION: Knowledge about HVD is still low. Neither appointments with a GP 
driven by symptoms nor regular use of a stethoscope are a reliable guarantee for 
early diagnosis. With the over 60s in Europe playing an active role in social 
life, awareness campaigns and regular heart health checks may guarantee early 
diagnosis and treatment of HVD.

BACKGROUND: Early diagnosis of breast cancer increases the chance of recovery 
and life expectancy. Screening is the primary tool for early diagnosis and 
timely treatment of breast cancer in early stages. This qualitative study aimed 
to explain the motivational factors for breast cancer screening in Iranian 
women.
METHODS: This qualitative study was conducted using content analysis. The 45 
women were selected through purposive sampling. Focus group were used for data 
collection and the data were analyzed using the Lundman and Graneheim thematic 
content analysis approach.
RESULTS: Data analysis identified 9 themes: knowledge acquisition, presence of 
happy-hopeful spirit, positive attitude and self-worth, maternal role, 
intellectual and financial independence, religious beliefs, motivational fears, 
and supportive family.
CONCLUSION: According to the results of this study, it seems that health systems 
need to change the attitudes and beliefs of people to enhance health culture by 
identifying women's motivations for breast cancer screening in different groups 
and increase social knowledge about screening methods by supporting and 
training.<br />.

The life expectancy of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) approaches 
that of the age-matched population and quality of life (QOL) issues are becoming 
increasingly important. To describe patients' characteristics and assess QOL, we 
delivered a 30-item core questionnaire, a 24-item CML-specific questionnaire, 
both from the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer 
(EORTC), and additional health-related items to 350 patients. Among 193 patients 
who completed the questionnaires, 139 received either imatinib (n = 70, 33%), 
dasatinib (n = 45, 23%) or nilotinib (n = 24, 12%). Patients' median age was 58 
(range: 23 to 89) years and 86 (63%) were males. Stratifying patients by 
treatment, we recognized two distinct populations. In comparison to patients on 
dasatinib and nilotinib, patients on imatinib were two decades older, had a 
longer duration of disease and current treatment, experienced fewer limitations 
on daily activities (p = 0.02), less fatigue (p = 0.001), lower degree of 
impaired body image (p = 0.022) and less painful episodes (p = 0.014). 
Similarly, they had better emotional functioning, were less worried, stressed, 
depressed or nervous (p = 0.01) and were more satisfied with their treatment (p 
= 0.018). Not only does age associate with current treatments, but it also 
predicts how patients perceive QOL. Young patients express impaired QOL compared 
with elderly patients.
