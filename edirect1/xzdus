socio-professional activities, preventing hemiparesis and aphasia is not 
sufficient: cognitive and emotional functions must be considered. To monitor 
higher-order functions, e.g., executive control, semantics or mentalizing, 
further tasks were implemented into the operating theater. Beyond this more 
accurate investigation of function-specific neural networks, a better 
exploration of the inter-system communication is required. Advances in brain 
connectomics led to a meta-network perspective of neural processing, which 
emphasizes the pivotal role of the dynamic interplay between functional circuits 
to allow complex and flexible, goal-directed behaviors. Constant multi-tasking 
with time constraint in awake patients may be proposed during intraoperative 
mapping, since it provides a mirror of the (dys)synchronization within and 
across neural networks and it improves the sensitivity of behavioral monitoring 
by increasing cognitive demand throughout the resection. Electrical mapping may 
hamper the patient to perform several tasks simultaneously whereas he/she is 
still capable to achieve each task in isolation. Unveiling the meta-network 
organization during awake mapping by using a more ecological multi-demand 
testing, more representative of the real-life conditions, constitutes a reliable 
way to tailor the surgical onco-functional balance based upon the expectations 
of each patient, enabling him/her to resume an active life with long-lasting 
projects.

making.

BACKGROUND: This research aimed to review the theoretical and methodological 
aspects of the quality-adjusted life year (QALY) which give rise to potential 
for bias against certain patient populations, including those with problems with 
walking or an inability to walk (ambulatory disabilities), when health 
technology assessment decisions rely on QALY gain to show cost-effectiveness. 
Societal preferences for treating ambulatory versus non-ambulatory patients were 
also investigated.
METHODS: We reviewed published literature to identify information on theoretical 
underpinnings of the QALY, measurement of utilities for QALY assessment, and 
empirical evidence of societal preferences for the treatment of ambulatory and 
non-ambulatory patients.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Health states which represent mobility impairment and 
the inability to walk receive low valuation from general public preferences. 
Non-ambulatory patients, for example those with advanced neuromuscular disease, 
have lower utilities determined by standardized preference-based measurement 
(PBM) tools. Any treatment that increases survival but could not restore 
ambulation would result in lower lifetime QALY gains for non-ambulatory versus 
ambulatory patients. Treatments could therefore potentially be deemed less 
cost-effective, or not cost-effective at all for this patient 
population.Empirical research indicates a societal preference for equal 
treatment of patients regardless of ambulatory status. The main limitation of 
our review was the non-systematic approach to evidence search and review, 
however, given the broad scope of content required to meet the aims of the 
review, we believe that the targeted approach was appropriate. The evidence 
presented in this article highlights the need for alternatives to strict 
QALY-based approaches to prevent avoidable health inequities when determining 
cost-effectiveness of healthcare interventions for non-ambulatory populations 
against fixed cost-effectiveness thresholds. An alternative metric, the Equal 
Value of Life Years Gained (evLYG), has been proposed as a supplementary measure 
for use alongside the QALY for its potential to alleviate bias against disabled 
patient populations during the assessment of healthcare treatments.

Many cases of insecticide resistance in insect pests give resulting no-cost 
strains that retain the resistance genes even in the absence of the toxic 
stressor. Malathion (rac-diethyl 
2-[(dimethoxyphosphorothioyl)sulfanyl]succinate) has been widely used against 
the red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum Herbst. in stored products although no 
longer used. Malathion specific resistance in this pest is long lasting and 
widely distributed. A malathion resistant strain was challenged with a range of 
stressors including starvation, hyperoxia, malathion and a pathogen to determine 
the antioxidant responses and changes to some lifecycle parameters. Adult life 
span of the malathion-specific resistant strain of T. castaneum was 
significantly shorter than that of the susceptible. Starvation and/or high 
oxygen reduced adult life span of both strains. Starving, with and without 100% 
oxygen, gave longer lifespan for the resistant strain, but for oxygen alone 
there was a small extension. Under oxygen the proportional survival of the 
resistant strain to the adult stage was significantly higher, for both larvae 
and pupae, than the susceptible. The resistant strain when stressed with 
malathion and oxygen significantly increased catalase activity, but the 
susceptible did not. The resistant strain stressed with Paranosema whitei 
infection had significantly higher survival compared to the susceptible, and 
with low mortality. The malathion resistant strain of T. castaneum showed 
greater vigour than the susceptible in oxidative stress situations and 
especially where stressors were combined. The induction of the antioxidant 
enzyme catalase could have helped the resistant strain to withstand oxidative 
stresses, including insecticidal and importantly those from pathogens. These 
adaptations, in the absence of insecticide, seem to support the increased 
immunity of the insecticide resistant host to pathogens seen in other insect 
species, such as mosquitoes. By increasing the responses to a range of stressors 
the resistant strain could be considered as having enhanced fitness, compared to 
the susceptible.

BACKGROUND: Previous cross-sectional studies generally did not fully consider 
the potential confounding factors associated with physician impact on overall 
population health. This ecological study controlled for health, demographic and 
socioeconomic confounders while using total physician density for predicting 
overall population health globally and regionally.
METHODS: Ecological data were extracted from the United Nations agencies for 215 
populations. Considering the competing effects of economic affluence, urban 
advantages and obesity, correlations between physician density and life 
expectancy at birth (LEB) were analysed with scatter plots, bivariate 
correlation, partial correlation and multiple linear regression analyses. 
Countries are also grouped for exploring the regional correlations between 
physician density and LEB.
RESULTS: Physician density correlates to LEB and this relationship remains 
regardless of the competition of the individual confounders, economic affluence, 
urbanization and obesity, or their combination. Physician density has the 
greatest influence on LEB, while economic affluence is second. Physician density 
explains 64.89% of LEB in this study. Together with constant bivariate 
correlations in country groupings, power correlation without a plateau or U 
shape in the trendline of the scatterplots, suggests that a shortage of 
physicians is a worldwide issue.
CONCLUSIONS: Physician density is a major independent contributor for LEB both 
globally and with special regard to the developing world. Telehealth may be an 
alternative to increase physicians' capacity while funding for increasing 
physician employment is desirable.

BACKGROUND: Spatial organization plays an important role in the function of many 
biological systems, from cell fate specification in animal development to 
multistep metabolic conversions in microbial communities. The study of such 
systems benefits from the use of spatially explicit computational models that 
combine a discrete description of cells with a continuum description of one or 
more chemicals diffusing within a surrounding bulk medium. These models allow 
the in silico testing and refinement of mechanistic hypotheses. However, most 
existing models of this type do not account for concurrent bulk and 
intracellular biochemical reactions and their possible coupling.
CONCLUSIONS: Here, we describe ChemChaste, an extension for the open-source C++ 
computational biology library Chaste. ChemChaste enables the spatial simulation 
of both multicellular and bulk biochemistry by expanding on Chaste's existing 
capabilities. In particular, ChemChaste enables (i) simulation of an arbitrary 
number of spatially diffusing chemicals, (ii) spatially heterogeneous chemical 
diffusion coefficients, and (iii) inclusion of both bulk and intracellular 
biochemical reactions and their coupling. ChemChaste also introduces a 
file-based interface that allows users to define the parameters relating to 
these functional features without the need to interact directly with Chaste's 
core C++ code. We describe ChemChaste and demonstrate its functionality using a 
selection of chemical and biochemical exemplars, with a focus on demonstrating 
increased ability in modeling bulk chemical reactions and their coupling with 
intracellular reactions.
AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: ChemChaste version 1.0 is a free, open-source 
C++ library, available via GitHub at https://github.com/OSS-Lab/ChemChaste under 
the BSD license, on the Zenodo archive at zendodo doi, as well as on BioTools 
(biotools:chemchaste) and SciCrunch (RRID:SCR022208) databases.

OBJECTIVE: To assess long-term outcomes of cooled radiofrequency ablation (CRFA) 
of genicular nerves for chronic knee pain due to osteoarthritis (OA).
METHODS: A prospective, observational extension of a randomized, controlled 
trial was conducted on adults randomized to CRFA. Subjects were part of a 
12-month clinical trial comparing CRFA of genicular nerves to a single 
hyaluronic injection for treatment of chronic OA knee pain, who then agreed to 
visits at 18- and 24-months post CRFA and had not undergone another knee 
procedure since. The subjects were evaluated for pain using the Numeric Rating 
Scale (NRS) function using the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities 
Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), subjective benefit using the Global Perceived 
Effect (GPE) scale, quality of life using the EuroQol-5-Dimensions-5 Level 
(EQ-5D-5L) questionnaire, and safety.
RESULTS: Of 57 subjects eligible, 36 enrolled; 32 completed the 18-month visit 
with a mean NRS score of 2.4 and 22 (69%) reporting ≥50% reduction in pain from 
baseline (primary endpoint); 27 completed the 24-month visit, with a mean NRS of 
3.4 and 17 (63%) reporting ≥50% pain relief. Functional and quality of life 
improvements persisted similarly, with mean changes from baseline of 53.5% and 
34.9% in WOMAC total scores, and 24.8% and 10.7% in EQ-5D-5L Index scores, at 
18- and 24-months, respectively. There were no identified safety concerns in 
this patient cohort.
CONCLUSION: In this subset of subjects, CRFA of genicular nerves provided 
durable pain relief, improved function, and improved quality of life extending 
to 24 months post procedure, with no significant safety concerns.

BACKGROUND: Non-cytotoxic therapy has changed the treatment paradigm for 
advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. With unique mechanisms of 
action, these agents have decidedly improved survival and have demonstrated an 
improved toxicity profile. However, the real-life experience of the patient, 
which is commonly assessed by health-related quality of life (HRQoL) 
measurement, is not clearly established with this new generation of lung cancer 
treatments. The heterogeneity created by specific patient subgroups and 
different therapeutics calls for a tailored-approach to analyzing 
patient-reported outcomes. The objective of this systematic review was to assess 
the methodological quality of HRQoL analysis in Randomized Clinical Trials 
(RCTs) involving biologic agents to treat NSCLC.
METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed using Medline, Embase, and 
Web of Science databases to identify NSCLC RCTs published between January 1st, 
2000 and January 1st, 2020 reporting HRQoL measures. Only RCTs that both 
enrolled previously untreated patients with advanced NSCLC and had HRQoL 
analysis were included.
RESULTS: 4203 abstracts were screened, of which only 85 RCTs met inclusion and 
exclusion criteria for analysis. The most applied HRQoL assessment tools were 
the EORTC-QLQ-C30 (47, 55.3 %), and EORTC-QLQ-LC13 (35, 41.2 %). The median 
number of verified CONSORT-PRO Extension criteria in the included trials was 3, 
and only in 10 (11.8 %) trials were all criteria well-documented. Notably, only 
21 (24.7 %) RCTs performed subgroup analyses to specifically evaluate HRQoL in 
different patient populations.
CONCLUSION: QoL reporting in clinical trials is inconsistent and the quality of 
QoL measures adopted in a majority of trials is suboptimal. Considering the fact 
that NSCLC is a biologically diverse disease and that the treatments differ 
based on patient and tumor-specifics, efforts should be pursued to tailor QoL 
measures for different subsets of this patient population in addition to 
mandating QoL reporting in clinical trials. We believe that this is necessary to 
understand the real-life experience of lung cancer patients in the era of 
personalized medicine.

BACKGROUND: The aetiology of ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV) and triggers of 
relapse are poorly understood. Vitamin D (vitD) is an important immunomodulator, 
potentially responsible for the observed latitudinal differences between 
granulomatous and non-granulomatous AAV phenotypes. A narrow ultraviolet B 
spectrum induces vitD synthesis (vitD-UVB) via the skin. We hypothesised that 
prolonged periods of low ambient UVB (and by extension vitD deficiency) are 
associated with the granulomatous form of the disease and an increased risk of 
AAV relapse.
METHODS: Patients with AAV recruited to the Irish Rare Kidney Disease (RKD) (n = 
439) and UKIVAS (n = 1961) registries were studied. Exposure variables comprised 
latitude and measures of ambient vitD-UVB, including cumulative weighted UVB 
dose (CW-D-UVB), a well-validated vitD proxy. An n-of-1 study design was used to 
examine the relapse risk using only the RKD dataset. Multi-level models and 
logistic regression were used to examine the effect of predictors on AAV relapse 
risk, phenotype and serotype.
RESULTS: Residential latitude was positively correlated (OR 1.41, 95% CI 
1.14-1.74, p = 0.002) and average vitD-UVB negatively correlated (0.82, 
0.70-0.99, p = 0.04) with relapse risk, with a stronger effect when restricting 
to winter measurements (0.71, 0.57-0.89, p = 0.002). However, these associations 
were not restricted to granulomatous phenotypes. We observed no clear 
relationship between latitude, vitD-UVB or CW-D-UVB and AAV phenotype or 
serotype.
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that low winter ambient UVB and prolonged vitD 
status contribute to AAV relapse risk across all phenotypes. However, the 
development of a granulomatous phenotype does not appear to be directly 
vitD-mediated. Further research is needed to determine whether sufficient vitD 
status would reduce relapse propensity in AAV.

BACKGROUND: Health workers, the core of health service delivery and a key driver 
of progress towards universal health coverage, must be available in sufficient 
numbers and distributed fairly to serve the entire population. In addition, the 
planning and management of the health workforce must be responsive to the 
changing needs of society, including changes in age structure and epidemiology. 
Considering these issues, this paper examines in historical perspective the 
evolution of postgraduate medical training and practice in Japan, from the late 
nineteenth century to the present.
MAIN TEXT: When the first medical schools were established in the country 
towards the end of the nineteenth century, Japan was a largely agrarian society, 
with a population of about 30 million and an average life expectancy of 
30-40 years. During the twentieth century, life expectancy and the national 
population continued to increase in a context of rapid economic growth. Since 
the 1980s, another demographic transition has occurred: low fertility rates and 
an aging society. As a result, the inputs and skills required from health 
professionals have changed considerably over time, posing new challenges to the 
national health sector and the management of human resources for health.
CONCLUSIONS: The case of Japan offers valuable lessons for other countries 
experiencing a rapid epidemiological and demographic transition. To provide 
medical care that meets health priorities in the communities, we must consider 
not only the training of specialists, but also ensure the availability of a 
large cadre of physicians who possess basic skills and can provide 
patient-centred care. Furthermore, the Japanese experience shows that a highly 
hierarchical system and organisational culture are ill-suited to respond quickly 
to the changing demands of society.

It is estimated that the Roma are the largest ethnic minority population in 
Europe (HSE in Roma Intercultural Guide, 2020). There is a dearth of information 
in the Irish medical literature on the Roma in Ireland. The aim of this paper is 
to provide an overview of the Roma in Ireland, to identify Roma-specific 
culture, family structure, paediatric illness, and health equality within the 
context of the Irish population. To do this, a review was completed of the 
English language literature on Roma available from 2010 to 2021 using web of 
science databases. Relevant clinicians and organisations were contacted to 
compile data on the Irish Roma to inform appropriate action in Roma child 
health. Up until 2021, the national census in Ireland did not include Roma as a 
category in ethnicity (HSE in Roma Intercultural Guide, 2020). As such, it is 
difficult to get an accurate number of the population in Ireland. Pavee Point 
Traveller and Roma Centre in 2009 estimated a population of approximately 5000 
(National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy in Justice.ie, 2017). The 
majority of the Roma in Ireland are Romanian (National Traveller and Roma 
Inclusion Strategy in Justice.ie, 2017). There is limited understanding of their 
culture in Ireland (National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy in 
Justice.ie, 2017). Often overlooked, small indigenous groups or nomadic races 
have unmet medical needs (National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy in 
Justice.ie, 2017). Across Europe, they have a lower life expectancy and higher 
burden of illness due to lower socioeconomic status, discrimination, and poor 
access to health services (National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy in

BACKGROUND: Unhealthy alcohol use is disproportionally experienced by 
individuals with minoritized sexual orientations. Unlike the general US 
population, for whom the burden of alcohol as it relates to mortality is 
consistently monitored across time with national survey data, the impact of 
unhealthy alcohol use among veterans with minoritized sexual orientations, for 
whom addressing substance use is a national priority, is largely unknown.
METHODS: Using Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test Consumption data from 
the Department of Veterans Affairs electronic health record and underlying cause 
of death from National Death Index from 2014 to 2018 we quantified alcohol 
consumption and related mortality among veterans with (n = 102,085) and without 
minoritized sexual orientations (n = 5300,521). Age adjusted rates of alcohol 
attributed deaths (AAD) per 100,000 persons and years of potential life lost 
(YPLL) were estimated by sexual orientation, sex, and sexual orientation 
stratified by sex.
RESULTS: Alcohol attributable deaths (n = 21,861) were higher among veterans 
with minoritized sexual orientations than veterans without after adjustment for 
age (486.5 deaths/100,000 versus 309.7 deaths/100,000, respectively). Veterans 
with minoritized sexual orientations also experienced more YPLL (13,772.8 
years/100,000 versus 7618.9 years/100,000). Years of potential life lost per AAD 
was higher in women (33.2 years) than men (18.7 years).
CONCLUSIONS: Alcohol consumption results in substantial disability and death 
among veterans, particularly veterans with minoritized sexual orientations. 
Findings suggest need for increased alcohol-related services for all VA 
patients, and potential targeted approaches to for veterans with minoritized 
sexual orientations and women to offset risk for, and years of potential life 
lost from, alcohol attributable death.

BACKGROUND: There are large and persistent disparities in life expectancy among 
racial-ethnic groups in the USA, but the extent to which these patterns vary 
geographically on a local scale is not well understood. This analysis estimated 
life expectancy for five racial-ethnic groups, in 3110 US counties over 20 
years, to describe spatial-temporal variations in life expectancy and 
disparities between racial-ethnic groups.
METHODS: We applied novel small-area estimation models to death registration 
data from the US National Vital Statistics System and population data from the 
US National Center for Health Statistics to estimate annual sex-specific and 
age-specific mortality rates stratified by county and racial-ethnic group 
(non-Latino and non-Hispanic White [White], non-Latino and non-Hispanic Black 
[Black], non-Latino and non-Hispanic American Indian or Alaska Native [AIAN], 
non-Latino and non-Hispanic Asian or Pacific Islander [API], and Latino or 
Hispanic [Latino]) from 2000 to 2019. We adjusted these mortality rates to 
correct for misreporting of race and ethnicity on death certificates and then 
constructed abridged life tables to estimate life expectancy at birth.
FINDINGS: Between 2000 and 2019, trends in life expectancy differed among 
racial-ethnic groups and among counties. Nationally, there was an increase in 
life expectancy for people who were Black (change 3·9 years [95% uncertainty 
interval 3·8 to 4·0]; life expectancy in 2019 75·3 years [75·2 to 75·4]), API 
(2·9 years [2·7 to 3·0]; 85·7 years [85·3 to 86·0]), Latino (2·7 years [2·6 to 
2·8]; 82·2 years [82·0 to 82·5]), and White (1·7 years [1·6 to 1·7]; 78·9 years 
[78·9 to 79·0]), but remained the same for the AIAN population (0·0 years [-0·3 
to 0·4]; 73·1 years [71·5 to 74·8]). At the national level, the negative 
difference in life expectancy for the Black population compared with the White 
population decreased during this period, whereas the negative difference for the 
AIAN population compared with the White population increased; in both cases, 
these patterns were widespread among counties. The positive difference in life 
expectancy for the API and Latino populations compared with the White population 
increased at the national level from 2000 to 2019; however, this difference 
declined in a sizeable minority of counties (615 [42·0%] of 1465 counties) for 
the Latino population and in most counties (401 [60·2%] of 666 counties) for the 
API population. For all racial-ethnic groups, improvements in life expectancy 
were more widespread across counties and larger from 2000 to 2010 than from 2010 
to 2019.
INTERPRETATION: Disparities in life expectancy among racial-ethnic groups are 
widespread and enduring. Local-level data are crucial to address the root causes 
of poor health and early death among disadvantaged groups in the USA, eliminate 
health disparities, and increase longevity for all.

Quitting smoking at any age increases life expectancy, but older adults face 
barriers to receiving cessation services. Despite the promise of web-based 
smoking cessation interventions to help address access barriers, whether older 
adults who participate in smoking cessation programs engage with and benefit 
from these tools at the same rate as younger adults remains unknown. In this 
secondary analysis, we compared engagement and satisfaction with two web-based 
smoking cessation interventions and quit rates between older, middle-aged, and 
young adults in the United States enrolled in the WebQuit trial between March 
2014 and August 2015. Participants were divided into age groups: older (60 years 
and older, n = 439/2637), middle-aged (40-59 years, n = 1308/2637), and young 
adults (18-39 years, n = 890/2637). Treatment engagement and satisfaction, and 
12-month quit rates (self-reported complete-case 30-day PPA and 
missing-as-smoking) were compared between groups. Older adults engaged more with 
the websites than young adults through multiple indicators of intervention 
engagement (i.e., number of sessions, unique days of use, and time spent on the 
site), and older adults spent more time on the site per session than their 
counterparts. Satisfaction with websites was high (81%) and non-differential 
between groups. Older and middle-aged adults quit smoking at a similar rate as 
younger adults (24%, 24%, 27%, respectively, p = 0.905). Older and middle-aged 
adults who participated in a web-delivered smoking cessation intervention 
engaged more with the intervention than their younger counterparts and they quit 
smoking at a similar rate, thereby demonstrating high acceptability and 
potential of digital interventions to help older adults quit smoking. Trial 
registration:ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT1166334.

Sex and Gender Differences in Kidney Transplantation.

Sex and gender often are used interchangeably, but are two distinct entities, 
with sex being the biological attribute and gender including the social, 
psychological, and cultural aspects of one's identity. Kidney transplantation 
has been proven to be the best treatment for end-stage kidney disease, improving 
both quality of life and life-expectancy for most patients. However, gender 
disparities in access to and outcomes of kidney transplantation remain despite 
the plethora of evidence showing the advantages of kidney transplantation to our 
patients. Data have shown that women are less likely to be waitlisted for a 
kidney transplant and to receive a deceased donor or a living donor kidney. On 
the other hand, women are more likely than men to become living kidney donors. 
Although some state the latter is the result of the female gender to nurture and 
care for loved ones, others believe this observation is because women often are 
incompatible with their spouse or child because pregnancy is a strong 
sensitizing event, which stems from the biological rather than the social 
differences between the sexes. Influence of sex and gender is not limited to 
access to kidney transplantation, but rather exist in other areas of transplant 
medicine, such as the difference observed in transplant outcomes between the 
sexes, variability in immunosuppression metabolism, and even in more 
contemporary areas such as recent data showing sex-based differences in outcomes 
of kidney transplant recipients with coronavirus disease-2019, with males having 
an increased incidence of acute kidney injury and death.

This study aims to explore the protective effect of Forsythiae Fructus 
extract(FFE) against herpes simplex virus encephalitis(HSE) in mice. To be 
specific, life extension rate of mice, viral load in mouse brain, levels of 
tumor necrosis factor-α(TNF-α), interleukin-1β(IL-1β), and interferon-α(IFN-α), 
and nitric oxide(NO) content in mouse brain were determined. Mice were 
classified into normal group, model group, acyclovir(ACV) group, and high-dose, 
medium-dose, and low-dose(100, 50, 25 mg·kg~(-1), respectively) FFE groups. HSE 
was induced in mice in corresponding groups. Then, the life extension rate was 
compared among groups. Viral load in brain was detected by real-time fluorescent 
quantitative PCR, the changes of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IFN-α in brain by 
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay(ELISA), NO content in brain with nitrate 
reduction method, and pathological changes by hematoxylin-eosin(HE) staining. 
The result showed that the life extension rate in the high-dose, medium-dose, 
and low-dose FFE groups was 27.93%, 19.94%, and 10.66%, respectively, and the 
difference between the high-dose group and the model group was statistically 
significant(P&lt;0.05). FFE decreased the viral load in brains of HSE mice. The 
levels of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IFN-α in ACV group and high-dose and medium-dose FFE 
groups were lower than those in the model group(P&lt;0.01,P&lt;0.05), and NO 
content in the three FFE groups was lower than that in the model 
group(P&lt;0.01). In conclusion, FFE can improve the survival rate of HSE mice, 
reduce the load of herpes simplex virus type Ⅰ(HSV-1) in the brains of HSE mice, 
decrease the levels of inflammatory factors and NO content, and alleviate 
inflammation and pathological damage, thereby protecting the central nervous 
system.

In this study, TreeAge Pro was used to build a decision tree model for Qilong 
Capsules in the treatment of ischemic stroke. We compared the economy between 
Qilong Capsules + conventional therapy vs conventional therapy in the treatment 
of ischemic stroke to guide the rational allocation of health resources in 
clinical practice. The cost parameters in the study were obtained from Menet and 
the relevant literature published recently. Meanwhile, the efficacy parameter 
[mean reduction in National Institute of Health stroke scale(NIHSS) score after 
treatment] was employed to evaluate the short-term economic performance of the 
two therapies based on a prospective real-world cohort study. The time span of 
simulation was 24 weeks, and the robustness of this study was verified by 
sensitivity analysis. Qilong Capsules + conventional therapy and conventional 
therapy had the direct medical costs of CNY 22 546.50, 21 160.50 and the 
effectiveness of 2.08, 1.59 points, respectively. The incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio(ICER) of the two groups was CNY 2 811.36. That is, 
compared with conventional therapy, Qilong Capsules + conventional therapy in 
the treatment of ischemic stroke costed CNY 2 811.36 for each additional point 
reduction in NIHSS score. If the patient is willing to pay more than CNY 2 
811.36, Qilong Capsules + conventional therapy is more economical. The result of 
sensitivity analysis verified that the ICER was robust. Thus, on the basis of 
the assumption that per capita disposable income in 2020 is the threshold of 
patients' willingness to pay, Qilong Capsules + conventional therapy is more 
economical than conventional therapy alone in the treatment of ischemic stroke.

BACKGROUND: In a subset of patients with recurrent oligometastatic prostate 
cancer (PCa) salvage surgery with prostate-specific membrane antigen 
(PSMA)-targeted radioguidance (PSMA-RGS) might be of value.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the oncological outcomes of salvage PSMA-RGS and 
determine the predictive preoperative factors of improved outcomes.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A cohort study of oligorecurrent PCa patients 
with biochemical recurrence (BCR) after radical prostatectomy and imaging with 
PSMA positron emission tomography (PET), treated with PSMA-RGS in two tertiary 
care centers (2014-2020), was conducted.
INTERVENTION: PSMA-RGS.
OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Kaplan-Meier and multivariable 
Cox regression models were used to assess BCR-free (BFS) and therapy-free (TFS) 
survival. Postoperative complications were classified according to 
Clavien-Dindo.
RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Overall, 364 patients without concomitant treatment 
were assessed. At PSMA-RGS, metastatic soft-tissue PCa lesions were removed in 
343 (94%) patients. At 2-16 wk after PSMA-RGS, 165 patients reached a 
prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level of <0.2 ng/ml. Within 3 mo, 24 (6.6%) 
patients suffered from Clavien-Dindo complications grade III-IV. At 2 yr, BFS 
and TFS rates were 32% and 58%, respectively. In multivariable analyses, higher 
preoperative PSA (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.07, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 
1.02-1.12), higher number of PSMA-avid lesions (HR: 1.23, CI: 1.08-1.40), 
multiple (pelvic plus retroperitoneal) localizations (HR: 1.90, CI: 1.23-2.95), 
and retroperitoneal localization (HR: 2.04, CI: 1.31-3.18) of lesions in 
preoperative imaging were independent predictors of BCR after PSMA-RGS. The main 
limitation is the lack of a control group.
CONCLUSIONS: As salvage surgery in oligorecurrent PCa currently constitutes an 
experimental treatment approach, careful patient selection is mandatory based on 
life expectancy, low PSA values, and low number of PSMA PET-avid lesions located 
in the pelvis.
PATIENT SUMMARY: We looked at the outcomes from prostate cancer patients with 
recurrent disease after radical prostatectomy. We found that surgery may be an 
opportunity to prolong treatment-free survival, but patient selection criteria 
need to be very narrow.

INTRODUCTION: Sepsis is a common, life-threatening syndrome of physiologic, 
pathologic, and biochemical abnormalities that are caused by infection and 
propagated by a dysregulated immune response. In 2017, the estimated annual 
incidence of sepsis around the world was 508 cases per 100,000 (95% confidence 
interval [CI], 422-612 cases per 100,000), however, reported incidence rates 
vary significantly by country. A scoping review will identify knowledge gaps by 
systematically investigating the incidence of sepsis.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This scoping review will be guided by the updated JBI 
(formerly Joanna Briggs Institute) methodology. We will search the following 
electronic databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and Cochrane Database of 
Systematic Reviews/Central Register of Controlled Trials. In addition, we will 
search websites of trial and study registries. We will review titles and 
abstracts of potentially eligible studies and then full-texts by two independent 
reviewers. We will include any study that is focused on the incidence of sepsis 
or septic shock in any population. Data will be abstracted independently using 
pre-piloted data extraction forms, and we will present results according to the 
Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis Protocols 
Extension for Scoping Reviews.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The results of this review will be used to create a 
publicly available indexed and searchable electronic registry of existing sepsis 
research relating to incidence in neonates, children, and adults. With input 
from stakeholders, we will identify the implications of study findings for 
policy, practice, and research. Ethics approval was not required given this 
study reports on existing literature.
