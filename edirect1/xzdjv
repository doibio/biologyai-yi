STUDY DESIGN: A qualitative study analyzed using Grounded Theory.
OBJECTIVES: To explore perceived bodily changes in people with acquired spinal 
cord injury of both genders and with different levels of injury.
SETTING: The National Paraplegic Hospital in Toledo, Spain, a national reference 
center for the treatment of spinal cord injury.
METHODS: A qualitative study designed and analyzed from the perspective of 
Grounded Theory. Semi-structured interviews were conducted in a triangulated 
sample of 32 people with acquired spinal cord injury. The analysis was based on 
the constant comparative method and an open, axial, and selective coding 
process.
RESULTS: The perceptions regarding bodily changes in people with spinal cord 
injury were grouped into two broad categories: changes in body schema (a 
fragmented body, a blurred body, body as a burden, non-muscular body, the 
wheelchair as an extension of the body, and body normalization) and increased 
bodily awareness (an uncontrollable body and retraining the body). The amount of 
time since the injury, positive life behaviors and attitudes, youth, male 
gender, and having flexible beliefs, values, and habits were considered 
facilitators for coping with body changes after a spinal cord injury.
CONCLUSIONS: Suffering a spinal cord injury implies a new body schema and a 
change in body awareness. When healthcare professionals are aware of the changes 
affecting the body after a spinal cord injury, they display more favorable 
attitudes and are more involved in promoting the patients' adaptation to their 
new body schema.

Cancer is currently the first or second most common contributor to premature 
mortality in most countries of the world. The global number of patients with 
cancer is expected to rise over the next 50 years owing to the strong influence 
of demographic changes, such as population ageing and growth, on the diverging 
trends in cancer incidence in different regions. Assuming that the latest 
incidence trends continue for the major cancer types, we predict a doubling of 
the incidence of all cancers combined by 2070 relative to 2020. The greatest 
increases are predicted in lower-resource settings, in countries currently 
assigned a low Human Development Index (HDI), whereas the predicted increases in 
national burden diminish with increasing levels of national HDI. Herein, we 
assess studies modelling the future burden of cancer that underscore how 
comprehensive cancer prevention strategies can markedly reduce the prevalence of 
major risk factors and, in so doing, the number of future cancer cases. Focusing 
on an in-depth assessment of prevention strategies that target tobacco smoking, 
overweight and obesity, and human papillomavirus infection, we discuss how 
stepwise, population-level approaches with amenable goals can avert millions of 
future cancer diagnoses worldwide. In the absence of a step-change in cancer 
prevention delivery, tobacco smoking will remain the leading preventable cause 
of cancer, and overweight and obesity might well present a comparable 
opportunity for prevention, given its increasing prevalence globally in the past 
few decades. Countries must therefore instigate national cancer control 
programmes aimed at preventing cancer, and with some urgency, if such programmes 
are to yield the desired public health and economic benefits in this century.

BACKGROUND: Non-adherence to medication (range 30-107%) is a major issue in 
patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Previous research has shown that 
electronic monitoring feedback (EMF) might be an effective strategy to improve 
medication adherence in chronic conditions. Therefore, this study investigated 
the effectiveness of electronic monitoring feedback in patients with early RA to 
improve medication adherence and clinical outcomes compared to usual care.
METHODS: An open-label randomized clinical trial was performed to compare EMF 
with standard care during a 12-month follow-up period on two sites of the Sint 
Maartenskliniek (Nijmegen and Boxmeer) in the Netherlands. Patients were 
eligible if they: (1) had a (working) diagnosis of early RA, (2) were currently 
using methotrexate, (3) were aged ≥18 years, and (4) had a life expectancy of 
≥12 months. Primary outcome was the difference in proportion of non-adherent 
patients measured with the Compliance Questionnaire on Rheumatology after 12 
months. Secondary outcomes were beliefs about medicines, medication adherence 
measured with the MMAS-8®, patients' health status, prescription of biologic 
DMARDs, and disease activity after 12 months.
RESULTS: Of the 367 initially-invited patients, 93 patients with early RA agreed 
to participate in this study. No significant difference was found in the 
proportion of non-adherent patients between the intervention arm and the usual 
care arm after 12 months follow-up (60.0% and 61.3%, p=0.93, respectively). 
Patients in the intervention arm tended to discontinue methotrexate earlier than 
patients in the usual care arm (median time in weeks: 15.7 (9.1-33.6) and 21.9 
(19-28.4), respectively, p=0.31), whereas patients in the usual care arm tended 
to initiate biologic DMARDs earlier than those in the intervention arm (median 
time in weeks: 11.9 (5.7-22) and 17 (9.9-40.9), respectively, p=0.55).
CONCLUSION: This study illustrates the challenge of targeting non-adherence with 
EMF in patients with early RA and shares important lessons learned about 
designing adherence intervention trials with respect to study attrition, 
accounting for drug survival, intervention fidelity, intervention uptake, and 
technical aspects.

BACKGROUND: Vitamin D population status may have possible unappreciated 
consequences to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Α significant 
association between vitamin D sufficiency and reduction in clinical severity and 
inpatient mortality from COVID-19 disease has recently been shown, while a 
recent study has claimed lower COVID-19 cases in European countries with a 
better vitamin D status. Low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin-D [25(OH)D] was identified 
as an independent risk factor for COVID-19 infection and hospitalization, and 
administration of 0.532 mg (21280 IU) of calcifediol or 25(OH)D, followed by 
0.266 mg on days 3 and 7 and then weekly until discharge or intensive care unit 
admission significantly reduced the need for intensive care unit treatment.
AIM: To elucidate the role of vitamin D European population status in the 
COVID-19 pandemic, data from the Worldometer were analyzed.
METHODS: Linear regression explored the correlation between published 
representative-standardized population vitamin D concentrations and the number 
of total cases/million (M), recovered/M, deaths/M and serious-critically ill/M 
from COVID-19 for 26 European countries populated > 4 M (Worldometer). Life 
expectancy was analyzed with semi-parametric regression. Weighted analysis of 
variance/analysis of covariance evaluated serious-critical/M and deaths/M by the 
vitamin D population status: Deficient < 50, insufficient: 50-62.5, mildly 
insufficient > 62.5-75 and sufficient > 75 nmol/L, while controlling for life 
expectancy for deaths/M. Statistical analyses were performed in XLSTAT LIFE 
SCIENCE and R (SemiPar Library).
RESULTS: Linear regression found no correlation between population vitamin D 
concentrations and the total cases-recovered/M, but negative correlations 
predicting a reduction of 47%-64%-80% in serious-critical illnesses/M and of 
61%-82%-102.4% in deaths/M further enhanced when adapting for life expectancy by 
133-177-221% if 25(OH)D concentrations reach 100-125-150 nmol/L, sustained on 
August 15, 2020, indicating a truthful association. Weighted analysis of 
variance was performed to evaluate serious-critical/M (r 2 = 0.22) by the 
vitamin D population status and analysis of covariance the deaths/M (r 2 = 
0.629) controlling for life expectancy (r 2 = 0.47). Serious-critical showed a 
decreasing trend (P < 0.001) from population status deficient (P < 0.001) to 
insufficient by 9.2% (P < 0.001), to mildly insufficient by 47.6% (P < 0.044) 
and to sufficient by 100% (reference, P < 0.001). For deaths/M the respective 
decreasing trend (P < 0.001) was 62.9% from deficient (P < 0.001) to 
insufficient (P < 0.001), 65.15% to mildly insufficient (P < 0.001) and 78.8% to 
sufficient (P = 0.041).
CONCLUSION: Achieving serum 25(OH)D 100-150 nmol/L (40-60 ng/mL) (upper 
tolerable daily doses followed by maintenance proposed doses not requiring 
medical supervision, Endocrine Society) may protect from serious-critical 
illness/death from COVID-19 disease.

Regorafenib was the first drug to demonstrate a survival benefit as a 
second-line agent after sorafenib failure in patients with unresectable 
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Recent studies have shown that its mechanism of 
action is not only limited to its very broad spectrum of inhibition of 
angiogenesis, tumor proliferation, spread, and metastasis, but also to its 
immunomodulatory properties that have favorable effects on the very intricate 
role that the tumor microenvironment plays in carcinogenesis and tumor growth. 
In this review, we discuss rationale and evidence supporting regorafenib 
efficacy in HCC and that led to its approval as a second-line treatment, after 
sorafenib failure. We also discuss the evidence from clinical practice studies 
that confirm the results previously achieved in clinical trials. Finally, we 
analyze the potential role of regorafenib in emerging combined treatment 
approach with immunotherapy strategies using immune checkpoint blockade and its 
potential extension to patient categories not included in the registrative 
study.

A newly recovered population of the genus Laimaphelenchus from a dead maritime 
pine wood sample in Potchefstroom, South Africa, representing a new species, 
named L. africanus n. sp., is herein described and illustrated based on 
morphological and molecular data. The new species is mainly characterized by the 
following: 750-987 µm long females; a cephalic region with no disc and six 
cephalic lobs not divided by ribs; a 10.0-12.5 µm long stylet; four incisures in 
the lateral field; secretory-excretory pore (SE-pore) at slightly posterior to 
the nerve ring; vulva with a well-developed anterior flap, vagina with two 
well-developed sclerotized pieces; post-vulval uterine sac (PUS) 63-125 µm long; 
tail conical, 30-44 µm long, ventrally curved with a subventral stalk in 
terminus, lacking tubercles, with six to nine small projections at the tip in 
scanning electron microscopy (SEM); and rare males with 17 μm long spicules. The 
new species was morphologically compared to those species of the genus with a 
stalk in tail terminus, lacking tubercles, a vulval flap and four incisures in 
the lateral field viz., L. liaoningensis, L. preissii, L. simlaensis, L. 
sinensis, L. spiﬂatus, and L. unituberculus. Phylogenetically, the new species 
was placed into the major Laimaphelenchus clade using partial large subunit 
ribosomal DNA (LSU rDNA D2-D3) sequences. An overall literature review 
corroborated the presence of the stalk (currently with two main groups) at the 
tail end is the main characteristic trait delimiting the genus. A compendium 
based on the characters of the stalk, presence/absence of a vulval flap in 
females and number of the lateral lines was also established.

BACKGROUND: Lorlatinib is a third-generation anaplastic lymphoma kinase 
(ALK)/c-ros oncogene 1 (ROS1) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) with efficacy in 
patients with ALK-rearranged non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) previously 
treated with a second-generation ALK inhibitor or with first- and 
second-generation ALK inhibitors. We examined the cost-effectiveness of second- 
or third-line+ (2L+ or 3L+) lorlatinib in Sweden, versus chemotherapy.
METHODS: A partitioned survival model with three health states (progression 
free, progressed, or death) was used. Lorlatinib relative efficacy versus 
chemotherapy was derived using unanchored matching adjusted indirect treatment 
comparisons from a phase 2 clinical trial. Utility data were derived from the 
same trial and published studies. Costs (year 2019) were obtained from Swedish 
national data. Costs and benefits were discounted at 3% per annum using a 
societal perspective (base case). Model robustness was evaluated with 
deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses.
RESULTS: For 2L+, the average discounted total quality-adjusted life year (QALY) 
gain was 1.29 years. Total incremental costs were Swedish krona (SEK) 731,791, 
resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of SEK 566,278 per 
QALY gained. Non-discounted survival gain amounted to 1.94 years. For 3L+, the 
average discounted total QALY gain was 1.25 years. Total incremental costs were 
SEK 754,801, resulting in an ICER of SEK 603,934 per QALY gained. Non-discounted 
survival gain was 1.88 years. Sensitivity analyses were consistent.
CONCLUSIONS: ICERs ranged from SEK 421,000 to SEK 384,066 less than the boundary 
for a cost-effective treatment for a high-severity disease in Sweden (SEK 
988,000), suggesting 2L+ or 3L+ lorlatinib is a cost-effective treatment for 
ALK-positive NSCLC versus chemotherapy.

Oncological imaging is a subspecialty of medical imaging and focuses on the 
workup and the follow-up of cancer. Oncological imaging takes into account all 
the specificities of cancer diseases, which is a constantly evolving field, 
especially in the era of precision medicine, and plays a key role in the care of 
cancer patients. It permits reliable diagnosis and gives precious information 
concerning disease extension at diagnosis, which is essential for the treatment 
planning. Oncological imaging allows also followup of patients under treatment, 
using response evaluation scores. Interventional imaging, which provides 
minimally invasive procedures, is useful in order to obtain a histological 
diagnosis, to treat some tumour or to improve quality of life of cancer 
patients. Finally, numerous perspectives, among them the advent of artificial 
intelligence (radiomics), will further strengthen the role of oncologic imaging 
in the near future.

Publisher: L’imagerie oncologique, qui est une sous-discipline de l’imagerie 
médicale, s’intéresse spécifiquement à la mise au point et au suivi des cancers. 
Elle prend en compte toutes les spécificités de la maladie oncologique, dont les 
traitements évoluent constamment à l’ère de la médecine de précision. Elle joue 
un rôle primordial à toutes les étapes du trajet de soin du patient. Elle permet 
la réalisation de diagnostics fiables et donne des informations sur l’étendue de 
la maladie au moment du diagnostic, nécessaires à l’établissement d’un plan de 
traitement. L’imagerie oncologique s’intéresse également au suivi des patients 
sous traitement, grâce notamment à l’utilisation de score d’évaluation de la 
réponse thérapeutique. L’imagerie interventionnelle, à travers la réalisation de 
procédures faiblement invasives, joue un rôle dans l’obtention du diagnostic, 
dans le traitement de certaines tumeurs ou dans l’amélioration de la qualité de 
vie du patient. Enfin, de nombreuses perspectives, et notamment l’avènement de 
l’intelligence artificielle (radiomique), ne vont faire que renforcer le rôle 
central de l’imagerie oncologique dans les prochaines années.

IMPORTANCE: Guidelines endorse using tumor risk and life expectancy (LE) to 
select appropriate candidates for radical prostatectomy (RP), recommending 
against treatment of most low-risk tumors and men with limited LE.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate time trends in the use of RP by tumor risk and 
Prostate Cancer Comorbidity Index (PCCI) score in a contemporary, nationally 
representative Veterans Affairs (VA) cohort.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study of 5736 men treated with RP 
at 8 VA hospitals from January 1, 2000, to December 31, 2017, used a nationally 
representative, multicenter sample from the VA SEARCH (Shared Equal Access 
Regional Cancer Hospital) database. Statistical analysis was performed from June 
30, 2018, to August 20, 2020.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Stratified linear and log-linear Poisson regressions 
were used to estimate time trends in the proportion of men treated with RP 
across American Urological Association tumor risk and PCCI (a validated 
predictor of LE based on age and comorbidities) subgroups.
RESULTS: Among 5736 men (mean [SD] age at surgery, 62 [6] years) treated with RP 
from 2000 to 2017, the proportion of low-risk tumors treated with RP decreased 
from 51% to 7% (difference, -44%; 95% CI, -50% to -38%). The proportion of 
intermediate-risk tumors treated with RP increased from 30% to 59% (difference, 
29%; 95% CI, 23%-35%), with unfavorable intermediate-risk tumors increasing from 
30% to 41% (difference, 11%; 95% CI, 4%-18%) and favorable intermediate-risk 
tumors decreasing from 61% to 41% (difference, -20%; 95% CI, -24% to -15%). The 
proportion of high-risk tumors treated with RP increased from 18% to 33% 
(difference, 15%; 95% CI, 9%-21%). Among men treated with RP, the proportion 
with the highest PCCI scores of 10 or more (ie, LE <10 years) increased from 4% 
to 13% (difference, 9%; 95% CI, 4%-14%). Within each tumor risk subgroup, no 
significant difference in the rate of tumors treated with RP over time was found 
across PCCI subgroups.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this study, the use of RP shifted from low-risk 
and favorable intermediate-risk to higher-risk prostate cancer. However, its use 
among men with limited LE appears unchanged across tumor risk subgroups and 
increased overall.

To be alive when dying: moral catharsis and hope in patients with limited life 
prognosis.

The Stoics considered that in order to die well, one must previously have lived 
(well) and not merely existed, an assertion which will not be contested in this 
paper. The question raised here is whether an individual whose life expectancy 
is jeopardized by serious illness or whose life has not been lived to the 'full' 
for whatever reason should have to abandon all hope or, alternately, whether 
that life could still somehow be saved (in an ethical sense). One clear obstacle 
to achieving this stems from (bad) moral character, given that moral character 
is an element which conditions an individual's moral behaviour, as pointed out 
by Beauchamp and Childress and particularly Pellegrino and Thomasma. The 
transformation of moral character requires time and effort but the testimonies 
of patients who have given their lives a radical new direction upon being 
diagnosed with a serious illness seem to show the existence of a peculiar 
phenomenon of moral catharsis. In this paper we attempt to illustrate that this 
alleged phenomenon is not the result of a kind of cataleptic impression but 
rather the result of a dialectic and narrative process, during which a first 
hope of healing is dashed, unveiling a new sense in the illness. Its fulfillment 
provides the patient with a final hope.

Introduction:Several pharmacological drugs have shown proof of concept for 
longevity in animal models. I aimed to identify and review those longevity drug 
candidates that are undergoing clinical trials.Areas covered:Recent (post-2017) 
longevity clinical trials were found in US and EU clinical trial registries. 
Longevity drug candidates are the antidiabetic drugs metformin and acarbose, and 
the immunosuppressant rapamycin. These medicinal drugs are tested on biochemical 
and clinical markers of aging. In addition, vitamin D supplementation is being 
investigated in two mega-trials (sample size> 5000) for its efficacy in reducing 
all-cause mortality.Expert opinion:Anti-aging effects of longevity drug 
candidates suggest, but do not demonstrate that they prolong life. The two 
megatrials with vitamin D supplementation make it possible to detect differences 
in life expectancy between vitamin D and placebo. Therefore, a protocol similar 
to that for vitamin D could be used to demonstrate pro-longevity effects of 
metformin, acarbose, and rapamycin.

Density dependence can obscure nonlethal effects of disturbance on life history 
of medium-sized cetaceans.

Nonlethal disturbance of animals can cause behavioral and physiological changes 
that affect individual health status and vital rates, with potential 
consequences at the population level. Predicting these population effects 
remains a major challenge in ecology and conservation. Monitoring 
fitness-related traits may improve detection of upcoming population changes, but 
the extent to which individual traits are reliable indicators of disturbance 
exposure is not well understood, especially for populations regulated by density 
dependence. Here we study how density dependence affects a population's response 
to disturbance and modifies the disturbance effects on individual health and 
vital rates. We extend an energy budget model for a medium-sized cetacean (the 
long-finned pilot whale Globicephala melas) to an individual-based population 
model in which whales feed on a self-replenishing prey base and disturbance 
leads to cessation of feeding. In this coupled predator-prey system, the whale 
population is regulated through prey depletion and the onset of yearly repeating 
disturbances on the whale population at carrying capacity decreased population 
density and increased prey availability due to reduced top-down control. In 
populations faced with multiple days of continuous disturbance each year, female 
whales that were lactating their first calf experienced increased mortality due 
to depletion of energy stores. However, increased prey availability led to 
compensatory effects and resulted in a subsequent improvement of mean female 
body condition, mean age at first reproduction and higher age-specific 
reproductive output. These results indicate that prey-mediated density 
dependence can mask negative effects of disturbance on fitness-related traits 
and vital rates, a result with implications for the monitoring and management of 
marine mammal populations.

BACKGROUND & AIM: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has become a major 
cause of chronic liver disease (CLD) worldwide. Our aim was to assess the burden 
of liver complications (LC, cirrhosis and liver cancer) related to NAFLD 
(LC-NAFLD) between 2009-2019 in Asia and the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) 
region.
METHODS: We used Global Burden of Disease data to assess incidence, mortality, 
and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) for LC-NAFLD from Asia and the MENA 
region. Annual % change (APC) in rates were computed using a joinpoint 
regression model. Associations of LC-NAFLD with low physical activity, diet and 
metabolic risks were determined by partial Spearman correlation coefficients 
(ρ).
RESULTS: Globally in 2019, there were 170,000 incident cases of LC-NAFLD, 
accounting for 6.6% of LC incident cases from all CLDs. There were 168,969 
deaths related to LC-NAFLD, accounting for 8.6% of LC deaths from all CLDs. Asia 
accounted for 48.3% of the global incidence of LC-NAFLD and for 46.2% of deaths 
attributable to LC-NAFLD, while MENA accounted for 8.9% and 8.6%, respectively. 
There were 2.08 million DALYs in Asia and 340,000 DALYs in MENA. From 2009 to 
2019, regions in Asia and MENA experienced a rise in DALYs attributable to 
LC-NAFLD (compared to LC from other CLDs), ranging from South Asia (APC = +2.12% 
vs. -0.94%) to high-income Asia Pacific (APC = -0.07%, p = 0.646 vs. -0.97%). In 
Asia, NAFLD-related DALYs were significantly correlated with dietary risks (95% 
CI 0.280-0.763, p = 0.004), metabolic risks (0.341-0.790, p <0.001) and tobacco 
use (0.134-0.691, p = 0.007). In MENA, low physical activity (0.557-0.918, p 
<0.001), metabolic risks (0.432-0.888, p = 0.001), and dietary risks 
(0.315-0.855, p = 0.001) correlated with DALYs.
CONCLUSIONS: NAFLD is posing a substantial burden in Asia and MENA. About half 
of the global burden of LC-NAFLD is accounted for by these regions.
LAY SUMMARY: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has emerged as one of the 
most common causes of chronic liver disease worldwide. We used Global Burden of 
Disease data to assess the incidence, mortality, and disability-adjusted life 
years attributable to NAFLD-related liver complications in Asia, the Middle East 
and North Africa. NAFLD is poised to contribute to a substantial liver disease 
burden in these regions. Regional and global policies are needed to address the 
increasing burden of complications of NAFLD.

BACKGROUND: The optimal revascularization strategy for the elderly with complex 
coronary artery disease remains unclear.
OBJECTIVES: The goal of this study was to investigate 10-year all-cause 
mortality, life expectancy, 5-year major adverse cardiac or cerebrovascular 
events (MACCE), and 5-year quality of life (QOL) after percutaneous coronary 
intervention (PCI) or coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) in elderly individuals 
(>70 years old) with 3-vessel disease (3VD) and/or left main disease (LMD).
METHODS: In the present pre-specified analysis on age of the SYNTAX Extended 
Survival study, 10-year all-cause death and 5-year MACCE were compared with 
Kaplan-Meier estimates and Cox proportional hazards models among elderly or 
nonelderly patients. Life expectancy was estimated by restricted mean survival 
time within 10 years, and QOL status according to the Seattle Angina 
Questionnaire up to 5 years was assessed by linear mixed-effects models.
RESULTS: Among 1,800 randomized patients, 575 patients (31.9%) were elderly. 
Ten-year mortality did not differ significantly between PCI and CABG in elderly 
(44.1% vs. 41.1%; hazard ratio [HR]: 1.08; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.84 to 
1.40) and nonelderly patients (21.1% vs. 16.6%; HR: 1.30; 95% CI: 1.00 to 1.69; 
pinteraction = 0.332). Among elderly patients, 5-year MACCE was comparable 
between PCI and CABG (39.4% vs. 35.1%; HR: 1.18; 95% CI: 0.90 to 1.56), whereas 
it was significantly higher in PCI over CABG among nonelderly patients (36.3% 
vs. 23.0%; HR: 1.69; 95% CI: 1.36 to 2.10; pinteraction = 0.043). There were no 
significant difference in life expectancy (mean difference: 0.2 years in favor 
of CABG; 95% CI: -0.4 to 0.7) and 5-year QOL status between PCI and CABG among 
elderly patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Elderly patients with 3VD and/or LMD had comparable 10-year 
all-cause death, life expectancy, 5-year MACCE, and 5-year QOL status 
irrespective of revascularization mode. (Synergy Between PCI With TAXUS and

INTRODUCTION: Biomedical technology holds the promise of extending human life 
spans; however, little research has explored attitudes toward life extension.
METHODS: This survey asked young adults (n = 593), younger-old adults (n = 272), 
and older-old adults (n = 46) whether they would take a hypothetical life 
extension treatment as well as the youngest and oldest age at which they would 
wish to live forever.
RESULTS: Age cohorts did not vary in their willingness to use life extension; 
however, in all three age cohorts, a plurality indicated that they would not use 
it. Men indicated a higher level of willingness to use the life extension 
treatment than women. Younger-old and older-old adults indicated that they would 
prefer to live permanently at an older age than younger adults.
DISCUSSION: If a life extension treatment were to become available that 
effectively stopped aging, young adults may be likely to use such a treatment to 
avoid reaching the ages at which older cohorts say they would prefer to live 
forever.

INTRODUCTION: Measures of health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL) are 
increasingly important for evaluating healthcare interventions and treatments, 
understanding the burden of disease, identifying health inequities, allocating 
health resources and for use in epidemiological studies. Although many HRQoL 
measures developed for use in adult populations are robust, they are not 
necessarily designed, or appropriate, to measure HRQoL for children/youth. 
Furthermore, the appropriateness of HRQoL measures for use with Indigenous 
child/youth populations has not been closely examined. The aims of this scoping 
review are to (1) identify and describe empirical studies using HRQoL measures 
among children/youth (aged 8-17 years) from Indigenous populations within the 
Pacific Rim, (2) summarise the study designs and modes of HRQoL measure 
administration, (3) describe the key dimensions of the identified HRQoL measures 
used among Indigenous populations, including specifically among Māori and (4) 
map the HRQoL measure dimensions to commonly used Māori models of health.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The scoping review framework developed by Arksey and 
O'Malley and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and 
Meta-Analyses extension for scoping reviews guidelines will be followed for best 
practice and reporting. An iterative search of peer-reviewed published empirical 
research reporting the use of child/youth HRQoL measures among Indigenous 
populations will be conducted. This literature will be identified across the 
following five databases: Ovid (Medline), PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and 
CINHAL. The search will be restricted to papers published in English between 
January 1990 and June 2020. Two reviewers will independently review the papers 
in two stages. A third reviewer will resolve any discrepancies that arise. A 
data charting form will be completed using data extracted from each paper.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval was not required for this scoping 
review. Dissemination will include publication of the scoping review in a 
peer-reviewed journal. This scoping review will inform a larger research project 
(HRC 20/166).

[Purpose] The purpose of this study was to develop a simpler method to estimate 
the intervertebral disc compressive force in healthy older adults. We also 
examined the validity of a simpler estimation formula for patients with spinal 
diseases. [Participants and Methods] Fifty-two older adults participated in the 
study. The standing posture was measured using a three-dimensional motion 
capture system. The intervertebral disc compressive force was calculated using a 
previously reported method. Correlation analysis was used to detect the 
relationship between the measured parameters and the intervertebral disc 
compressive force. Multiple regression analysis was performed to obtain an 
equation for the intervertebral disc compressive force. Correlation analysis was 
used to determine the regression equation for the patients with spinal diseases. 
[Results] Multiple regression analysis showed that trunk flexion/extension angle 
and body mass were significantly associated with intervertebral disc compressive 
force. A correlation was found between the measured and predicted values in the 
healthy older adults, whereas both values were inconsistent in patients with 
spinal diseases. [Conclusion] The results of our study demonstrated that the 
trunk flexion/extension angle and body mass are indicators of intervertebral 
disc compressive force and can be used to assess low back mechanical stress in 
healthy older adults.
