metastases were treated with Gamma Knife radiosurgery. The lesions' mean volume 
was 0.6 mL (0.013-3.6 mL). The mean marginal dose was 20 Gy (15-24 Gy). 
Univariate and multivariate studies were done to identify prognostic factors, 
and 3 patient stratification systems were applied for survival estimation: RPA, 
SIR, and BSBM.
RESULTS: The primary tumor location was in the lungs in 12 patients, breast in 
8, and other in 5. Fourteen lesions were located in the pons, 9 in the midbrain, 
and 4 in the medulla. All patients were followed clinically. Radiologic 
follow-up was available in 21 lesions (78%). Tumor control was achieved in all 
but one followed lesion (95%). There were no complications related to treatment. 
Median survival of patients with brain stem metastases was 11.1 months. In 
multivariate analysis, KPS of 80 or more, control of the primary tumor, absence 
of radiotherapy, and a marginal dose higher than 18 Gy were associated with 
better survival. The BSBM in the univariate and multivariate analyses was the 
strongest predictor of survival (P < .0001).
CONCLUSIONS: The BSBM was the most useful tool for estimating survival. Rather 
than the brain stem location of an intracranial metastasis, the patient integral 
clinical status seems to be more important in determining survival.

INTRODUCTION: The Locked-In syndrome (LIS) is defined by: (i) the presence of 
sustained eye opening (bilateral ptosis should be ruled out as a complicating 
factor); (ii) preserved awareness; (iii) aphonia or hypophonia; (iv) 
quadriplegia or quadriparesis; and (v) a primary mode of communication that uses 
vertical or lateral eye movement or blinking. Acute ventral pontine lesions are 
its most common cause. Following such brainstem lesions patients may remain 
comatose for some time and then gradually awaken, remaining paralyzed and 
voiceless, superficially resembling the vegetative state.
BACKGROUND: It has been shown that more than half of the time physicians fail to 
recognize early signs of awareness in LIS. Given appropriate medical care, life 
expectancy may be several decades but the chances of good motor recovery remain 
small. Eye-controlled computer technology now allows LIS patients to communicate 
and control their environment. Recent studies show that most LIS patients 
self-report meaningful quality of life and the demand for euthanasia is 
infrequent.
CONCLUSION: Patients suffering from LIS should not be denied the right to 
die--and to die with dignity--but also they should not be denied the right to 
live--and to live with dignity and the best possible pain and symptom management 
and revalidation.

PURPOSE: To examine age-related effects of smoking on lung cancer mortality in a 
large population-based case-control study that was incorporated into a 
nationwide retrospective survey of mortality in China.
METHODS: Two data sets were pooled for this analysis: national mortality survey 
data and data from a nationwide case-control comparison. These pooled data were 
used to calculate age-specific lung cancer death rates by smoking status and 
expected years of lost life expectancy for each smoking-associated death.
RESULTS: There was a significant excess of deaths (54% of urban deaths, 51% of 
rural deaths) at 35 to 69 years of age among male smokers and the average loss 
of life expectancy per smoking-associated death at these ages was 18.3 years. 
For women ages 35 to 69 years of age, 29% and 11% excess lung cancer mortality 
was observed in urban and rural smokers, respectively, with an average loss of 
life expectancy per smoking-associated death of 21.3 years.
CONCLUSIONS: Tobacco smoking was associated with a large number of deaths from 
lung cancer. Utilizing information from a population-based retrospective 
mortality survey for conducting an analytic epidemiological study of main 
determinants of disease is feasible and can generate important results.

End-of-life medical treatment choices: do survival chances and out-of-pocket 
costs matter?

of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104-6298, USA. chao69@wharton.upenn.edu

BACKGROUND: Out-of-pocket medical expenditures incurred prior to the death of a 
spouse could deplete savings and impoverish the surviving spouse. Little is 
known about the public's opinion as to whether spouses should forego such 
end-of-life (EOL) medical care to prevent asset depletion.
OBJECTIVES: To analyze how elderly and near elderly adults assess hypothetical 
EOL medical treatment choices under different survival probabilities and 
out-of-pocket treatment costs.
METHODS: Survey data on a total of 1143 adults, with 589 from the Asset and 
Health Dynamics Among the Oldest Old (AHEAD) and 554 from the Health and 
Retirement Study (HRS), were used to study EOL cancer treatment recommendations 
for a hypothetical anonymous married woman in her 80s.
RESULTS: Respondents were more likely to recommend treatment when it was 
financed by Medicare than by the patient's own savings and when it had 60% 
rather than 20% survival probability. Black and male respondents were more 
likely to recommend treatment regardless of survival probability or payment 
source. Treatment uptake was related to the order of presentation of treatment 
options, consistent with starting point bias and framing effects.
CONCLUSIONS: Elderly and near elderly adults would recommend that the 
hypothetical married woman should forego costly EOL treatment when the costs of 
the treatment would deplete savings. When treatment costs are covered by 
Medicare, respondents would make the recommendation to opt for care even if the 
probability of survival is low, which is consistent with moral hazard. The 
sequence of presentation of treatment options seems to affect patient treatment 
choice.

Cost-effectiveness of intensified versus conventional multifactorial 
intervention in type 2 diabetes: results and projections from the Steno-2 study.

Gaede P(1), Valentine WJ, Palmer AJ, Tucker DM, Lammert M, Parving HH, Pedersen 
O.

Author information:

OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of intensive versus conventional 
therapy for 8 years as applied in the Steno-2 study in patients with type 2 
diabetes and microalbuminuria.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A Markov model was developed to incorporate event 
and risk data from Steno-2 and account Danish-specific costs to project life 
expectancy, quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE), and lifetime direct medical 
costs expressed in year 2005 Euros. Clinical and cost outcomes were projected 
over patient lifetimes and discounted at 3% annually. Sensitivity analyses were 
performed.
RESULTS: Intensive treatment was associated with increased life expectancy, 
QALE, and lifetime costs compared with conventional treatment. Mean +/- SD 
undiscounted life expectancy was 18.1 +/- 7.9 years with intensive treatment and 
16.2 +/- 7.3 years with conventional treatment (difference 1.9 years). 
Discounted life expectancy was 13.4 +/- 4.8 years with intensive treatment and 
12.4 +/- 4.5 years with conventional treatment. Lifetime costs (discounted) for 
intensive and conventional treatment were euro45,521 +/- 19,697 and euro41,319 
+/- 27,500, respectively (difference euro4,202). Increased costs with intensive 
treatment were due to increased pharmacy and consultation costs. Discounted QALE 
was 1.66 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) higher for intensive (10.2 +/- 3.6 
QALYs) versus conventional (8.6 +/- 2.7 QALYs) treatment, resulting in an 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of euro2,538 per QALY gained. This is 
considered a conservative estimate because accounting prescription of generic 
drugs and capturing indirect costs would further favor intensified therapy.
CONCLUSIONS: From a health care payer perspective in Denmark, intensive therapy 
was more cost-effective than conventional treatment. Assuming that patients in 
both arms were treated in a primary care setting, intensive therapy became 
dominant (cost- and lifesaving).

Oral cyclophosphamide for active scleroderma lung disease: a decision analysis.

Khanna D(1), Furst DE, Clements PJ, Tashkin DP, Eckman MH.

Author information:
(1)Division of Rheumatology, School of Public Health, University of California 
at Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90095, USA. dkhanna@mednet.ucla.edu

BACKGROUND: Results from the recent Scleroderma Lung Study (SLS) show that oral 
cyclophosphamide (CYC) is better than placebo in preventing the progression of 
scleroderma-related interstitial lung disease (SSc-ILD) at 12 mo but is 
associated with adverse events. Also, the long-term balance of risk and benefit 
remains unclear.
METHODS: The authors evaluate the risk-benefit tradeoffs using a Markov decision 
analytic model to project the quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) for strategies 
of CYC versus no CYC in SSc-ILD. The base case examined a 50-y-old woman with 
SSc of 1.5 y, SSc-ILD with moderate ventilatory restriction. The authors analyze 
the decision to treat with 1 y of daily CYC versus no SSc-ILD-specific therapy. 
Based on 2-y data from the SLS, the authors assume CYC resulted in no survival 
benefit and only a transient beneficial impact on pulmonary function. They 
explore the impact of changes in model parameters through sensitivity analyses, 
including the efficacy of CYC in preventing progression of lung disease and 
SSc-ILD- related death. Results. In the base-case analysis, CYC-treated patients 
fared worse, with a small loss of 0.21 QALYs (16.84 v. 17.15). CYC remained 
inferior across sensitivity analyses for most variables. In analyses assuming a 
survival benefit with CYC, CYC resulted in a clinically significant gain (18.17 
v. 17.15 QALYs).
CONCLUSIONS: CYC therapy for 1 y results in a small loss in QALYs compared with 
no CYC for SSc-ILD. The lack of a beneficial impact on survival and the 
transience of CYC's impact on decline in pulmonary function drive this 
conclusion.

The results of a probabilistic study performed in an extremely poor area where 
an ethnographic methodology was applied for the identification of cocaine paste 
consumption are analyzed. The studied community's general population's life 
prevalence was of 13,2 %. Prevalence was 51,1 % within the male population 
between 14 and 30 years old. Within the same poverty situation, greater 
consumption was associated with greater deficiencies. Data shows how cocaine 
paste consumption compulsion accentuates the displacement of the most vulnerable 
groups towards the limits of social survival.

    Breast Cancer Res Treat. 2009 Apr;114(3):597-8.

PURPOSE: BCIRG 001 demonstrated prolonged disease-free (DFS) and overall 
survival (OS) but increased toxicity for adjuvant docetaxel, doxorubicin, and 
cyclophosphamide (TAC) versus 5-fluorouracil, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide 
(FAC) in women with node positive breast cancer (BC). This study evaluates 
quality-adjusted survival and cost-effectiveness of adjuvant TAC versus FAC, 
taking downstream decisions and events into account, including palliative 
chemotherapy with taxanes.
METHODS: We developed a Markov model for a cohort of women with node positive BC 
eligible for adjuvant anthracyclines. Data input included clinical and resource 
utilization data collected prospectively from BCIRG 001. Treatment decisions and 
outcomes with disease recurrence were based on a systematic literature review 
with validity reviewed by a national panel of Canadian BC oncologists. Direct 
costs for resource utilization following Canadian practice patterns were 
included. Unit costs were obtained from provincial cost list and published drug 
list prices. Utility scores were derived from the literature. An incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) in cost per quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) 
gained for TAC versus FAC was calculated.
RESULTS: For 1,000 women with node positive BC, the model showed that TAC would 
lead to a gain of 313 QALY (370 life years) at an additional cost of $5.8 
Million Canadian dollars (Cdn) compared to FAC, over a 10-year time horizon. The 
ICER of TAC versus FAC was $18,505.54 Cdn per QALY gained. Sensitivity analyses 
supported the robustness of the model. By one-way sensitivity analyses of over 
50 model variables, 95% of the cumulative ICER variation was from $6,000 to 
$28,000 Cdn/QALY. By multivariate Monte Carlo simulation, there was a 70% 
probability that the ICER would be under $50,000 CdN/QALY.
CONCLUSION: For women with node positive BC, TAC improves DFS and OS compared to 
FAC and is a cost-effective adjuvant chemotherapy strategy.

Multi-state models are frequently applied to describe transitions over time 
between three states: healthy, not healthy and death. The three-state model can 
be used to estimate life expectancies in health and ill health. In this article, 
continuous-time Markov models are specified for the transitions between the 
three states. Transition intensities are regressed on age as a time-dependent 
covariate. The covariate is handled in a piecewise-constant fashion where the 
time interval between two consecutive observations is divided into subintervals 
of fixed and equal lengths. Study design choices such as sample size, length of 
follow-up, and time intervals between observations are investigated in a 
simulation study. The effects on parameter estimation are discussed as well as 
the effects on the estimation of life expectancies. In addition, data taken from 
the UK Cognitive Functioning and Ageing Study are analysed.

An economic evaluation of a perindopril-based blood pressure lowering regimen 
for patients who have suffered a cerebrovascular event.

OBJECTIVES: Cerebrovascular disease (or stroke) is one of the main causes of 
long-term disability and the second leading cause of death worldwide. The 
economic impact of stroke is clearly seen, as it is the largest single cause of 
bed occupancy in hospitals in England and accounts for 6% of hospital costs. 
This analysis is the first to quantify the economic consequences of a blood 
pressure lowering regimen based on the PROGRESS study (perindopril-based 
regimen), for reducing future cardiovascular events.
DESIGN: A Markov decision analytical model was used to estimate the cost per 
quality adjusted life year (QALY) of blood pressure lowering in the treatment of 
patients presenting with a cerebrovascular event. The health states are based 
upon Barthel indices for which resource utilisation and health benefits have 
previously been estimated.
SETTING: The participants for the economic analysis were obtained from the 
PROGRESS study database. 6,105 clinical study participants were recruited 
through both primary and secondary care centres.
PARTICIPANTS: The mean age was 64 years; 70% were male in the original study.
INTERVENTIONS: In the PROGRESS study, blood pressure lowering by a 
perindopril-based regimen was compared to standard care.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cost per quality adjusted life year for the duration of 
the study (4 years) and for a time span of 20 years.
RESULTS: Using only direct hospital medical costs, the cost per QALY for a 
perindopril based regimen is pound 6,927 for the base study period and pound 
10,133 for a 20-year time period. These results are sensitive to the cost of 
perindopril, the cost of the stroke unit, length of stay, and to a lesser 
extent, the cost of indapamide.
CONCLUSIONS: This analysis demonstrates a cost-effective treatment for patients 
suffering a cerebrovascular event with a blood pressure lowering regimen. The 
findings of this study are in line with current decisions and guidance by the 
national institute for health and clinical excellence (NICE) in England.

Author information:
(1)Department of Public Health, University of Turku, Turku, Finland. 
risto.tuominen@utu.fi

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate three commonly used methods for 
preference measurement in medical and dental programs.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: In a questionnaire filled in by 156 first-year medical 
(n=120) and dental (n=36) students, they were asked to evaluate five programs, 
each costing approximately 2 million euros annually. The programs were 
helicopter ambulance service, MPR vaccination (measles, parotitis and rubella), 
breast cancer screening, 250 hip replacement operations, and a dental check-up 
program for 7-year-olds.
RESULTS: The respondents were willing to make the highest donations for running 
the helicopter ambulance service (39 euros) and least for the dental check-up 
programme (14 euros) (p<0.01). When using the visual analog scale (VAS) method 
to evaluate the importance of the five programs, MPR vaccination was considered 
the most important (score 88), and hip replacement operations and dental 
check-up the least important (scores 68) (p<0.01). With the rank order (RO) 
method, MPR vaccinations were ranked the highest (score 1.8) and hip replacement 
operations (score 4.2) and dental check-up (score 4.0) the lowest (p<0.01). The 
respondents considered VAS and RO methods significantly easier than the 
willingness to pay method (p<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: It is concluded that depending on the nature of the information 
required, each of the three methods can be used for assessing preferences. The 
willingness to pay method seemed to be the most difficult to comprehend, but it 
provides more detailed and ready-to-use information for economic evaluations 
than the other two methods.

Economic aspects of a therapy and support service for people with long-term 
stroke and aphasia.

van der Gaag A(1), Brooks R.

Author information:
(1)Division of Community Based Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, University of 
Glasgow, Glasgow, UK. annavandergaag@btinternet.com

BACKGROUND: This paper considers some economic aspects of a therapy and support 
service for people with stroke and aphasia. This material was part of a broader 
evaluation of the service, which is reported elsewhere (van der Gaag et al. 
2005, van der Gaag and Mowles 2005).
AIMS: The purpose of this part of the study was to investigate the feasibility 
of undertaking economic appraisal in a voluntary sector service providing 
therapy for people with aphasia and their families.
METHODS & PROCEDURES: The costs of delivering therapy and support services were 
calculated. These costs were compared with the costs of equivalent services in 
the National Health Service (NHS). The EQ-5D health-related quality of life 
instrument was used to calculate quality-adjusted life years (QALYs).
OUTCOMES & RESULTS: The cost of delivering therapy was lower than expected for a 
customized service of this nature. The study generated cost data for delivering 
therapy services, allowing some comparisons to be made with equivalent services 
in NHS settings. QALY data were generated for a sample of 25 clients on one of 
the programmes.
CONCLUSIONS: The economics of speech and language therapy service delivery have 
received scant attention in the published literature. The paper argues that 
decision-making about methods of service delivery can be aided by the explicit 
consideration of the costs and consequences of different programmes.

Are chronic dialysis patients at increased risk for cancer?

Mandayam S(1), Shahinian VB.

Author information:
(1)Wichita Nephrology Group, Wichita, KS, USA.

This review summarizes the plausible mechanisms of carcinogenesis, critically 
analyzes the literature on cancer risk and discusses issues of cancer screening 
in chronic dialysis patients. Despite conflicting results among various studies, 
there is sufficient evidence to conclude that there is a heightened incidence of 
at least some cancers in dialysis patients. The data most convincingly support 
an increased risk of genitourinary malignancies. Screening for the common solid 
organ cancers (prostate, colon, breast and cervix) should be individualized, and 
is appropriate only for the minority of patients with a life expectancy on 
dialysis of 10 years or longer. Further research is needed before routine 
screening for bladder or renal cell cancers can be recommended.

The goal of palliative care is to achieve good quality of life for patients with 
chronic life-limiting illnesses, and their families, through assessment and 
management of physical, psychosocial and spiritual problems and needs. Patients 
with kidney diseases present a particular target of such care from the time of 
diagnosis to the time of family bereavement family. End-stage renal disease is 
associated with limited life expectancy, high morbidity and considerable burden 
of symptoms especially in elderly patients. Nephrologists who are not prepared 
for the holistic aspects of care of such patients, frequently encounter high 
mortality rates. Pain and other physical, psychosocial and spiritual symptom 
management appear to be an important issue in nephrology. Withdrawal from 
dialysis is another problem that may require special attention in the form of 
legal and ethical guidance.

Author information:
(1)Department of Medical and Surgical Sciences, Thromboembolism Unit, University 
of Padua, 35128 - Padua, Italy. paoloprandoni@tin.it

BACKGROUND: Idraparinux is a synthetic pentasaccharide that binds to 
antithrombin with high affinity. In view of its long half-life, it is suitable 
for once-a-week administration.
OBJECTIVE: To review the evidence favoring the use of idraparinux for the acute 
and long-term treatment of patients with venous thromboembolism (VTE) and for 
the prevention of thromboembolic events in patients with atrial fibrillation 
(AF).
METHODS: All preclinical and clinical studies carried out with the use of 
idraparinux were sought through electronic searches of MEDLINE from January 1, 
1999 up to December 31, 2007.
RESULTS: The administration of idraparinux in subcutaneous fixed doses of 2.5 mg 
once weekly was found to be as effective and safe as conventional antithrombotic 
therapy in the initial treatment of patients with deep vein thrombosis, but less 
effective than standard therapy in the initial treatment of patients with 
primary pulmonary embolism. During a 6-month extension of thromboprophylaxis, 
idraparinux was effective in preventing recurrent VTE but was associated with an 
increased risk of bleeding versus placebo. Finally, in patients with AF the 
long-term treatment with idraparinux was as effective as vitamin K antagonists, 
but caused more bleeding.
CONCLUSIONS: In its current formulation, idraparinux can be recommended only for 
the initial treatment of patients with deep vein thrombosis. The bioequipotency 
of a biotinylated version of idraparinux (idrabiotaparinux), whose effects can 
be reversed by a neutralizing agent (avidin), is under investigation in the 
treatment of VTE at present, as is the use of lower doses in patients with AF.

OBJECT: Although the clinical outcomes following anterior cervical discectomy 
and fusion (ACDF) surgery are generally good, 2 major complications are graft 
migration and nonunion. These complications have led some to advocate rigid 
internal fixation and/or cervical immobilization postoperatively. This paper 
examines a single-surgeon experience with single-level ACDF without use of 
plates or hard collars in patients with degenerative spondylosis in whom 
allograft was used as the fusion material.
METHODS: The authors conducted a retrospective review of a prospective database 
of (Cloward-type) ACDF operations performed by the senior author (J.A.J.) 
between July 1996 and June 2005. Radiographic follow-up included static and 
flexion/extension radiographs obtained to assess fusion, focal and segmental 
kyphosis, and change in disc space height. At most recent follow-up, the 
patients' condition was evaluated by an independent physician examiner. The Odom 
criteria and Neck Disability Index (NDI) were used to assess outcome.
RESULTS: One hundred seventy patients underwent single-level ACDF for 
degenerative pathology during the study period. Their most common presenting 
symptoms were pain, weakness, and radiculopathy; 88% of patients noted >or= 2 
neurological complaints. The mean hospital stay was 1.76 days (range 0-36 days), 
and 3 patients (2%) had major immediate postoperative complications requiring 
reoperation. The mean duration of follow-up was 22 months (range 12-124 months). 
Radiographic evidence of fusion was present in 160 patients (94%). Seven 
patients (4%) showed radiographic evidence of pseudarthrosis, and graft 
migration was seen in 3 patients (2%). All patients had increases in focal 
kyphosis at the operated level on postoperative radiographs (mean -7.4 degrees 
), although segmental alignment was preserved in 133 patients (78%). Mean change 
in disc space height was 36.5% (range 28-53%). At most recent clinical 
follow-up, 122 patients (72%) had no complaints referable to cervical disease 
and were able to carry out their activities of daily living without impairment. 
The mean postoperative NDI score was 3.2 (median 3, range 0-31).
CONCLUSIONS: Single-level ACDF without intraoperative plate placement or the use 
of a postoperative collar is an effective treatment for cervical spondylosis. 
Although there is evidence of focal kyphosis and loss of disc space height, 
radiographic evidence of fusion is comparable to that attained with plate 
fixation, and the rate of clinical improvement is high.

Methods of data collection and analysis for the economic evaluation alongside a 
national, multi-centre trial in the UK: conventional ventilation or ECMO for 
Severe Adult Respiratory Failure (CESAR).

BACKGROUND: Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) is a technology used in 
treatment of patients with severe but potentially reversible respiratory 
failure. A multi-centre randomised controlled trial (CESAR) was funded in the UK 
to compare care including ECMO with conventional intensive care management. The 
protocol and funding for the CESAR trial included plans for economic data 
collection and analysis. Given the high cost of treatment, ECMO is considered an 
expensive technology for many funding systems. However, conventional treatment 
for severe respiratory failure is also one of the more costly forms of care in 
any health system.
METHODS/DESIGN: The objectives of the economic evaluation are to compare the 
costs of a policy of referral for ECMO with those of conventional treatment; to 
assess cost-effectiveness and the cost-utility at 6 months follow-up; and to 
assess the cost-utility over a predicted lifetime. Resources used by patients in 
the trial are identified. Resource use data are collected from clinical report 
forms and through follow up interviews with patients. Unit costs of hospital 
intensive care resources are based on parallel research on cost functions in UK 
NHS intensive care units. Other unit costs are based on published NHS tariffs. 
Cost effectiveness analysis uses the outcome: survival without severe 
disability. Cost utility analysis is based on quality adjusted life years gained 
based on the Euroqol EQ-5D at 6 months. Sensitivity analysis is planned to vary 
assumptions about transport costs and method of costing intensive care. 
Uncertainty will also be expressed in analysis of individual patient data. 
Probabilities of cost effectiveness given different funding thresholds will be 
estimated.
DISCUSSION: In our view it is important to record our methods in detail and 
present them before publication of the results of the trial so that a record of 
detail not normally found in the final trial reports can be made available in 
the public domain.
TRIAL REGISTRATIONS: The CESAR trial registration number is ISRCTN47279827.

Significant advancements in chemotherapy for metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) 
have been achieved over the past decade, and the median overall survival 
duration is now close to 24 months with appropriate treatment. The most widely 
recommended chemotherapy regimens are based on the use of irinotecan or 
oxaliplatin in combination with 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin; some data suggest 
further benefit with the addition of the targeted agents bevacizumab or 
cetuximab. Colorectal cancer primarily affects the elderly; however, much of the 
defining clinical research in this field has excluded subjects of advanced age 
or with a poor performance status, making it difficult for clinicians to 
interpret current treatment paradigms for their older patients. Most clinical 
trials that have included elderly patients document similar survival rates and 
toxicity profiles to those seen in younger patients. Moreover, survey data 
suggest that >70% of elderly patients with cancer are willing to undergo strong, 
palliative chemotherapy. While these findings suggest that age itself should not 
determine candidacy for chemotherapy, it is important to note the great 
heterogeneity of the elderly population with regard to overall health, 
independence, and performance status. The use of a comprehensive geriatric 
assessment is recommended to evaluate chemotherapy appropriateness. The 
management of frail elderly patients and those with a short life expectancy 
should be focused on palliation, while fit elderly patients can receive 
aggressive therapy in a similar fashion to younger patients.

Educational differentials in life expectancy with cognitive impairment among the 
elderly in the United States.

OBJECTIVE: This article provides estimates of education differentials in life 
expectancy with and without cognitive impairment for the noninstitutionalized 
population aged 70 years and older in the United States.
METHOD: Life expectancy with cognitive impairment was calculated using 
multistate models, allowing transitions between cognitively intact and 
cognitively impaired states and from each of these states to death and allowing 
transition rates to vary across age and education. Four waves of the Assets and 
Health Dynamics of the Oldest Old survey were used.
RESULTS: Those with low levels of education are more likely to become 
cognitively impaired and do so at an earlier age. After age 70, persons with low 
educational levels can expect to live 11.6 years, and persons with high 
education 14.1 years, without cognitive impairment. Length of life with 
cognitive impairment differs by education (1.6 years and 1.0 years at age 70, 
respectively) but differs little by age.
DISCUSSION: Although those with higher education have lower rates of both 
cognitive impairment and mortality, those who do become cognitively impaired 
appear to be in poorer health, leading to a reduced probability of improved 
cognition and increased probability of mortality relative to those with lower 
educational levels.

OBJECTIVES: The authors prospectively examined whether depressive symptoms (DS) 
in older adults negatively affected active live expectancy (ALE), or remaining 
years free of disability, and mortality, independently and in the presence of 
chronic diseases, and after stratification by gender.
DESIGN: Prospective cohort study, first three waves (1993-1998) of the Asset and 
Health Dynamics Among the Oldest Old.
DATA COLLECTION: University of Michigan; analysis: University of South Florida.
PARTICIPANTS: Nationally representative sample of community-dwelling adults age 
70 and older (N = 7,381).
MEASUREMENTS: DS (Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression, 8-item 
version), self-reported cancer, diabetes, heart disease, or stroke, difficulty 
with activities of daily living, death, and estimates of total, active, and 
disabled life expectancy.
RESULTS: DS reduced ALE by 6.5 years for young-old men (age 70), 3.2 years for 
old-old men (age 85), 4.2 years for young-old women, and 2.2 years for old-old 
women, and these effects remained significant at all ages and across gender even 
after controlling for chronic disease, the one exception being DS and cancer in 
old-old women. DS also reduced total life expectancy significantly, although 
controlling for some chronic diseases (particularly cancer and stroke) 
eliminated the effect of DS across age and gender groups.
CONCLUSION: Depressive symptoms represent a serious and distinct threat to 
independent functioning in older adults. Whether experienced alone, or in 
combination with chronic diseases, depressive symptoms shorten ALE 
substantially. Timely diagnosis and treatment of depressive symptoms in older 
adults may delay the onset of disability and improve the quality of life.

modified open posterior approach: operative technique and 12- to 48-month 
outcomes.

OBJECTIVES: To report clinical and functional outcomes following fixation of 
tibial posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) avulsion fractures through a modified 
open posterior approach when combined with a rehabilitation program emphasizing 
early range of motion.
DESIGN: Retrospective case series.
SETTING: Level I trauma center.
PATIENTS: From March 4, 2000 to May 8, 2003, there were 16 cases of PCL tibial 
avulsion injuries presented to our institution, with 10 patients available for 
follow up at 12 to 48 months (mean 28 months).
INTERVENTION: Fixation of tibial PCL avulsion fractures was with a lag screw and 
washer placed through a modified open posterior approach. Range of motion was 
begun on postoperative day 1.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Clinical stability, range of motion, gastrocnemius 
muscle strength, radiographic appearance, and each patient's overall 
health-related quality of life (using the musculoskeletal functional assessment 
tool) were evaluated at final follow up.
RESULTS: The average musculoskeletal functional assessment score was 14. 
(Musculoskeletal functional assessment scores range from 0-100, with higher 
scores indicating poorer function.) All patients achieved union of their 
fracture and had clinically stable knees at the latest follow-up. Flexion 
difference greater than 10 degrees (P = 0.16), extension difference greater than 
2 degrees (P = 0.38), and heel raise difference more than 8 repetitions (P = 
0.23) were not demonstrated in comparison to the normal side.
CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of tibial PCL avulsion fractures, which includes fixation 
through a modified open posterior approach and early postoperative range of 
motion, results in healing of the fracture, good functional outcomes, stability 
to posterior draw testing, and does not lead to gastrocnemius weakness or 
significant range of motion deficits at 12 to 48 months postoperatively.

G.

Author information:

AIM: The increase in life expectancy of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients has 
brought about a rise in new clinical problems in these patients, such as a 
decrease in bone mineral density (BMD). The cause of diminished BMD in CF is 
multi-factorial.
METHODS: The aim of this cross-sectional study, conducted on 39 CF patients 
under the age of 18 years, was to evaluate the degree of bone mineralization and 
the prevalence of low BMD in these patients during a follow-up at the Cystic 
Fibrosis Regional Center of Tuscany, using a dual energy X-ray absorptiometry 
(DXA) scan, and to then study the factors correlated with low BMD.
RESULTS: Areas BMD values (g/cm2) and Z-score values were determined. Eighteen 
patients (46%) out of the our sample had decreased BMD, while 21 patients (54%) 
had normal values. A statistically significant association was found between BMD 
Z-score values and pancreatic insufficiency, BMI<5th percentile and DeltaF508 
homozygosis. Subjects treated with oral steroid therapy had a 3.9 times greater 
risk of developing osteoporosis compared to non-treated subjects (95% C.I.: 
1.07-22.6; R.R. 4.9). An association was found between BMD Z-score values and 
FEV1 values (r=0.29; P=0.06), physical activity total score values (r=0.22; 
P=0.19) and the Chrispin-Norman chest radiographic score (r=-0.31; P=0.06).
CONCLUSION: Early identification of reduced bone mass values would permit early 
intervention to prevent the development of osteoporosis. Maintaining pulmonary 
function, guaranteeing optimal nutritional status, following an adequate program 
of physical activity and controlling steroid intake could maintain BMD over 
time.

Author information:

USA.

This chapter introduces some fundamental results in survival analysis. We first 
describe what is censored failure time data and how to interpret the failure 
time distribution. Two nonparametric methods for estimating the survival curve, 
the life table estimator and the Kaplan-Meier estimator, are demonstrated. We 
then discuss the two-sample problem and the usage of the log-rank test for 
comparing survival distributions between groups. Lastly, we discuss in some 
detail the proportional hazards model, which is a semiparametric regression 
model specifically developed for censored data. All methods are illustrated with 
artificial or real data sets.

Southampton, Southampton, UK. dturner@soton.ac.uk

OBJECTIVE: To determine if a disease management programme for patients with 
coronary heart disease and heart failure represents an efficient use of health 
services resources.
METHODS: We carried out an economic evaluation alongside a cluster randomised 
control trial of 1163 patients with coronary heart disease and chronic heart 
failure in 20 primary care practices in the United Kingdom. Practices were 
randomised to either a control group, where patients received standard general 
practice care, or an intervention group where patients had access to a 
specialist nurse-led disease management programme. We estimated costs in both 
groups for coronary heart disease-related resource use. The main outcome measure 
used in the economic evaluation was quality adjusted life years (QALY) measured 
using the EuroQol.
RESULTS: The disease management programme was associated with an increase in the 
QALY measured of 0.03 per year and an increase in the total NHS costs of 425 
pounds (540 euros), of this only 83 pounds was directly associated with the 
provision of the nurse clinics. The clinics generated additional QALY at an 
incremental cost of 13 pounds 158 per QALY compared to the control group.
CONCLUSIONS: The use of a nurse-led disease management programme is associated 
with increased costs in other coronary heart disease-related services as well as 
for the costs of the clinics. They are also associated with improvements in 
health. Even in the short term these disease management programmes may represent 
a cost-effective service, as additional QALY are generated at an acceptable 
extra cost.

Economic evaluation of the US Environmental Protection Agency's SunWise program: 
sun protection education for young children.

EC, Wagner MC.

OBJECTIVE: The SunWise School Program is a school-based sun safety education 
program that was developed by the US Environmental Protection Agency and aims to 
teach children how to protect themselves from overexposure to the sun. The 
objectives of this study were to assess the health benefits of the SunWise 
School Program and use economic analysis to determine the program's net benefits 
and cost-effectiveness.
METHODS: Standard cost/benefit and cost-effectiveness analysis methods were 
used. Intervention costs were measured as program costs estimated to be incurred 
by the US government, which funds SunWise, using 3 funding scenarios. Health 
outcomes were measured as skin cancer cases and premature mortalities averted 
and quality-adjusted life-years saved. These health outcomes were modeled using 
an effectiveness evaluation of SunWise based on pretest and posttest surveys 
administered to students who participated in the program and the Environmental 
Protection Agency's peer-reviewed Atmospheric and Health Effects Framework 
model. Costs averted were measured as direct medical costs and costs of 
productivity losses averted as a result of SunWise. Net benefits were measured 
as the difference between costs averted and program costs.
RESULTS: Economic analysis indicated that if the SunWise School Program 
continues through 2015 at current funding levels, then it should avert >50 
premature deaths, nearly 11,000 skin cancer cases, and 960 quality-adjusted 
life-years (undiscounted) among its participants. For every dollar invested in 
SunWise, between approximately $2 and $4 in medical care costs and productivity 
losses are saved, depending on the funding scenario.
CONCLUSIONS: From a cost/benefit and cost-effectiveness perspective, it is 
worthwhile to educate children about sun safety; small to modest behavioral 
impacts may result in significant reductions in skin cancer incidence and 
mortality.
