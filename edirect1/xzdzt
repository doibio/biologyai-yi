The visible and Mössbauer spectra of [Fe(II)(Por)L2] and [Fe(II)(Por)L(CO)] 
complexes (where Por = protoporphyrin IX (PPIX) or tetra(p-sulfophenyl)porphyrin 
(TPPS) and L = an aliphatic or aromatic nitrogenous base) are reported and 
discussed. The results are compared to those of previously reported 
[Fe(II)(Por)L(CO)] complexes (where Por = PPIX, TPPS, PMXPP, TPP, OMTBP and OEP; 
L = a nitrogenous aromatic ligand) and HbCO (where Hb = haemoglobin) and MyCO 
(where My = myoglobin). A new approach, to extracting information from the 
Mössbauer parameters has been developed by plotting those of the [Fe(II)(Por)L2] 
complexes against those of [Fe(II)(Por)L(CO)] complexes for the same ligands, 
has yielded a series of trend lines that show a significant dependence on both 
the nature of the porphyrin and also of the nitrogenous ligand. Different trend 
lines were found for aromatic nitrogenous ligands to aliphatic nitrogenous 
ligands showing that the porphyrins could donate different amounts of charge to 
the Fe(II) cations as the L ligand changed, and hence, they display electron 
sink properties. From the plots, it was shown that haemoglobin and myoglobin 
both bind CO very strongly compared to the model complexes studied herein. Using 
the reported structural and Mössbauer data for the [Fe(II)(Por)L2] and 
[Fe(II)(Por)L(CO)] complexes, it proved possible and instructive to plot the 
Mössbauer parameters against a number of the bond lengths around the Fe(II) 
cations. The interpretation of the resulting trend lines both supported and 
facilitated the extension of our findings enabling further understanding of the 
geometry of the bonding in CO haemoglobin and CO myoglobin.

BACKGROUND: One key challenge of the COVID-19 pandemic is health care access. 
Government-imposed restrictions and increased health care burden have induced 
considerable changes to health care services and their delivery. These are 
likely to have substantially impacted those with chronic conditions such as 
endometriosis, as they require sustained management.
AIMS: Our objective was to explore the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the 
experience of people with endometriosis, and to use this information to inform 
health care delivery for the management of chronic conditions in a COVID-normal 
future.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Invitation to participate in an open-ended online survey 
through social media of Australian endometriosis organizations and the Royal 
Women's Hospital, Melbourne. Surveys were analyzed qualitatively through 
template analysis.
RESULTS: Of 576 surveys returned, 329 reported COVID-19 having an impact. 
Fifteen areas of impact were identified and grouped under three domains: impact 
on access to health care services, impact on daily life, and impact of 
isolation. Common impacts included reduced access to health care services, 
improved symptom management due to decreased day-to-day travel and 
work-from-home arrangements, and both positive and negative views of telehealth 
services.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides in-depth insight into the experiences of people 
with endometriosis during the COVID-19 pandemic, confirming previous studies' 
findings and offering insight into discrepancies between the Australian 
Healthcare system categorization of surgeries as "non-essential," and patient 
views of these procedures as "essential" to their well-being. Results may inform 
future adjustments to health care services and delivery to improve the lives of 
people with endometriosis, and by extension, other chronic conditions.

cross-country panel analysis.

Several low- and middle-income countries are considering health financing system 
reforms to accelerate progress toward universal health coverage (UHC). However, 
empirical evidence of the effect of health financing systems on health system 
outcomes is scarce, partly because it is difficult to quantitatively capture the 
'health financing system'. We assign country-year observations to one of three 
health financing systems (i.e., predominantly out-of-pocket, social health 
insurance (SHI) or government-financed), using clustering based on 
out-of-pocket, contributory SHI and non-contributory government expenditure, as 
a percentage of total health expenditures. We then estimate the effect of these 
different systems on health system outcomes, using fixed effects regressions. We 
find that transitions from OOP-dominant to government-financed systems improved 
most outcomes more than did transitions to SHI systems. Transitions to 
government financing increases life expectancy (+1.3 years, p < 0.05) and 
reduces under-5 mortality (-8.7%, p < 0.05) and catastrophic health expenditure 
incidence (-3.3 percentage points, p < 0.05). Results are robust to several 
sensitivity tests. It is more likely that increases in non-contributory 
government financing rather than SHI financing improve health system outcomes. 
Notable reasons include SHI's higher implementation costs and more limited 
coverage. These results may raise a warning for policymakers considering SHI 
reforms to reach UHC.

Venglustat inhibits the enzymatic conversion of ceramide to glucosylceramide, 
reducing available substrate for the synthesis of more complex 
glycosphingolipids. It offers a potential new approach to the treatment of 
patients with Fabry disease (α-Gal A deficiency), in whom progressive 
accumulation of such glycosphingolipids, including globotriaosylceramide (GL-3), 
in the lysosomes of a wide range of cell types often leads to vital organ 
complications in adulthood. An international, open-label, single-arm, Phase 2a 
uncontrolled 26-week clinical study (NCT02228460) and a 130-week extension study 
(NCT02489344) were conducted to assess the safety, pharmacodynamics, 
pharmacokinetics, and exploratory efficacy of 15 mg once daily oral venglustat 
in treatment-naïve adult male patients with classic Fabry disease. Of 11 
patients (18-37 years old) who initially enrolled, nine completed the 26-week 
study and seven completed the extension study. A total of 169 treatment-emergent 
adverse events (TEAEs) were reported by nine patients, the majority being mild 
(73%) and unrelated to the study drug (70%). Nine serious TEAEs (serious adverse 
events) and 11 severe TEAEs, including a self-harm event, were reported. No 
deaths or treatment-related life-threatening adverse events were reported. Skin 
GL-3 scores in superficial skin capillary endothelium (SSCE), estimated by light 
microscopy, were unchanged from baseline at Week 26 in five patients, decreased 
in three patients, and increased in one patient. There was no significant change 
in GL-3 scores or significant shift in grouped GL-3 scores. Five of six patients 
had reductions from baseline in GL-3 score at the end of the extension study. At 
Weeks 26 and 156 the mean (standard deviation) changes from baseline in the 
fraction of the volume of SSCE cytoplasm occupied by GL-3 inclusions, measured 
by electron microscopy unbiased stereology, were - 0.06 (0.03) (p = 0.0010) 
and - 0.12 (0.04) (p = 0.0008), respectively. Venglustat treatment reduced 
markers in the synthetic and degradative pathway of major glycosphingolipids; 
proximal markers reduced rapidly and more distal markers (plasma GL-3 and 
globotriaosylsphingosine) reduced progressively. There were no biochemical or 
histological indications of progression of Fabry disease over 3 years of 
follow-up. These findings confirm target engagement and the pharmacodynamic 
effects of venglustat in adult males with classic Fabry disease. However, 
further clinical evaluation in larger studies is needed to determine efficacy 
and safety.

BACKGROUND: Smoke-free policies have led to a decline in smoking prevalence. 
Nevertheless, as the global population grows, more non-smokers are exposed to 
second-hand smoke (SHS) hazards. Mitigating SHS hazards requires a systematic 
analysis of the global disease burden attributable to SHS.
METHODS: Data on SHS was extracted from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019. 
First, we measured the disease burden of SHS by the number of cases and 
age-standardized rates of deaths, disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), years 
lived with disability (YLDs), and years of life lost (YLLs) from 1990 to 2019. 
Second, trends in the disease burden of SHS in different periods were estimated 
based on the annual percentage change (APC) by joinpoint regression analysis. 
Finally, using histogram plots, world maps, Pearson correlation analysis, and 
population attributable fraction (PAF), we conducted a stratified analysis of 
SHS exposure by sex, age, geographic location, sociodemographic index (SDI) 
level, and disease.
RESULTS: The number of deaths caused by SHS remained stable between 1990 and 
2019, and the number of YLDs more than doubled in three decades. In contrast, 
the number of DALYs and YLLs caused by SHS decreased. The declining trend in 
deaths (APC = -1.42 % [95 % UI -1.79 %, -1.05 %]), DALYs (APC = -1.91 % [95 % UI 
-2.15 %, -1.67 %]), and YLLs (APC = -1.28 % [95 % UI -1.93 %, -0.64 %]) had 
slowed down in recent years, while SHS-related YLDs were still increasing 
(APC = 1.84 % [95 % UI 0.74 %, 2.96 %]). From 2010 to 2019, we found that SHS 
exposure increased the risk of tracheal, bronchus, and lung cancer (PAF 
increased by 11.75 %), breast cancer (PAF increased by 5.36 %), diabetes 
mellitus (PAF increased by 8.24 %), and ischemic heart disease (PAF increased by 
4.46 %). In addition, the disease burden caused by SHS was highest in middle SDI 
and low-middle SDI countries.
CONCLUSION: The global disease burden attributable to SHS is still severe, and 
policymakers need to implement more effective measures to reduce the harm of 
SHS.

BACKGROUND: The increased human life expectancy and prevalence of obesity lead 
to more elderly people with obesity. As the popularity of bariatric surgery 
continues to grow, more elderly persons apply for bariatric surgery. However, 
because of the potentially higher surgical risk in elderly patients, bariatric 
surgery has been performed in small numbers. Moreover, the literature so far has 
shown controversial results.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the safety of bariatric surgery in elderly patients in 
terms of 2-year morbidity and mortality.
SETTING: Dutch nationwide mandatory registry for bariatric surgery.
METHODS: A population-based retrospective cohort study. Elderly patients (aged 
≥65 years) who received primary bariatric surgery between January 2015 and 
January 2020 were compared with the general bariatric surgical population (aged 
18-65 years).
RESULTS: Of 49,553 patients, 838 elderly patients (1.7%) were included. An 
intraoperative complication was registered in 1.2% of the elderly patients and 
1.1% of the nonelderly patients (P = .814). A severe short-term complication 
(≤30 days) was registered in 38 elderly patients (4.5%) and 1071 nonelderly 
patients (2.2%) (P < .001). The short-term mortality rates were .2% and .1%, 
respectively (P = .173). Bleeding was the most reported short-term complication. 
Significantly more nonelderly patients had a follow-up visit; 560 elderly 
patients (66.8%) versus 34,975 nonelderly patients (71.8%) (P = .002). The 
severe midterm complication rate (>30 days to ≤2 years) was significantly higher 
in nonelderly patients (3.7% versus 1.6%; P = .008).
CONCLUSIONS: Bariatric surgery in elderly patients is safe in terms of 
perioperative outcome, mortality, and midterm complication rate. However, 
elderly patients experienced twice as many severe short-term complications. 
Bariatric surgery in elderly patients should be recommended on a case-by-case 
basis.

INTRODUCTION: hip fracture is the most common fracture in the elderly and its 
negative impact in functionality, life quality and expectancy are widely 
described. In Mexico, resources, infrastructure and programs for its attention 
are few and deficient. Associated factors to a better functional and life 
prognosis had been described in heterogeneous ways. The main objective of this 
work is to determine the associated factors to a better functional recovery and 
less mortality three months after hip fracture in the elderly.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: geriatric assessment was performed in all older adult 
patients admitted to the hospital with hip fracture. Telephone monitoring was 
done three months after hospital discharge. Survival, Barthel index, and March 
Capacity Evaluation Scale (FAC) was interrogated. Descriptive analysis of the 
variables was performed. For outcomes measures, univariate analysis was done, 
since data didn't have normal distribution. Age and Barthel index before 
fracture were included in linear regression model to evaluate impact over 
mortality and march capacity.
RESULTS: three-month mortality was of 26.3% of the patients, with in- hospital 
hyponatremia as a risk factor (OR, 3.87, p = 0.03). The median difference in pre 
fracture and post fracture Barthel index was -25 points (-5010). The variables 
associated with worse functional outcome was patient´s expressed fear to walk 
again (p = 0.05) and cognitive impairment (p = 0.032). 47.4% of the patients 
could walk, most of them classified in FAC 4. 28% of the patients, reported 
walking impairment. Living in urbanity, fear to walk (OR, 4.83, p = 0.031) and 
malnutrition (OR, 5.52, p = 0.016) were significantly associated with walking 
impairment.
CONCLUSIONS: multifactorial intervention for better functional and survival 
outcomes three-months after hip fracture are needed, even more in middle-income 
countries.

Publisher: INTRODUCCIÓN: la fractura de cadera es la más común en el adulto 
mayor y tiene gran impacto negativo en funcionalidad, calidad y sobrevida. En 
México la infraestructura, recursos y programas para su atención son escasos. 
Los factores asociados, mejor pronóstico funcional y de vida han sido descritos 
de forma heterogénea. El objetivo principal del estudio fue determinar los 
factores asociados con mayor recuperación funcional y menor mortalidad a tres 
meses de la fractura de cadera en el adulto mayor.
MATERIAL Y MÉTODOS: se realizó valoración geriátrica integral a todos los 
pacientes mayores hospitalizados por fractura de cadera. Se dio seguimiento 
telefónico a tres meses del egreso hospitalario para revaloración de 
funcionalidad. Se interrogó sobrevida, escala de Barthel y FAC. Se realizó un 
análisis descriptivo de las variables. Para la valoración de desenlaces se hizo 
análisis univariado, ya que los datos no presentaron una distribución normal. Se 
incluyó edad y Barthel previo a fractura en un modelo de regresión lineal para 
valorar impacto en mortalidad y deambulación.
RESULTADOS: la mortalidad a tres meses fue de 26.3%, con hiponatremia 
intrahospitalaria como factor de riesgo (OR, 3.87, p = 0.03). La mediana de 
diferencia en puntaje de Barthel preoperatorio y postoperatorio fue -25 puntos 
(-5010). Las variables asociadas a un peor desenlace funcional fue el miedo a 
volver a caminar (p = 0.05) y deterioro cognitivo (p = 0.032). De los pacientes, 
47.4% lograba deambular, la mayoría clasificados con FAC 4; 28% de los pacientes 
no lograron deambulación. Vivir en urbanidad, el miedo a volver a caminar (OR, 
4.83, p = 0.031) y un tamizaje positivo para malnutrición (OR, 5.52, p = 0.016) 
se asociaron a mayor incapacidad.
CONCLUSIONES: es importante la intervención multifactorial para lograr mejores 
resultados funcionales y de sobrevida tres meses posteriores a la fractura de 
cadera.

Survey (MEPS) and the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS).
METHODS: This study uses data from the 2002-2015 NHIS and MEPS surveys. Injuries 
were identified in the MEPS medical events file and through self-reporting of 
medical conditions. We restricted our model to 163,731 adults, for which we 
predict a total of 294,977 EQ-5D scores using responses to the self-administered 
questionnaire. EQ-5D scores were modeled using age, sex, comorbidities, and 
binary indicators of the presence and duration of injury at the time of the 
health status questionnaire. These models consider nonlinearity over time during 
the first 3 y following the injury event.
RESULTS: Injuries are identified in MEPS using medical events that provide a 
reasonable proxy for the date of injury occurrence. Health-related quality of 
life (HRQL) decrements can be estimated using binary indicators of injury during 
different time periods. When grouped into 29 injury categories, most categories 
were statistically significant predictors of HRQL scores in the first year after 
injury. For these groups of injuries, mean first-year QALY loss estimates range 
from 0.005 (sprains and strains of joints and adjacent muscles, n = 7067) to 
0.109 (injury to nerves and spinal cord, n = 71). Fewer estimates are 
significant in the second and third years after injury, which may reflect a 
return to baseline HRQL.
CONCLUSION: This research presents both a framework for estimating QALY loss for 
short-lived medical conditions and nationally representative, community-based 
HRQL scores associated with a wide variety of injury and poisoning conditions.
HIGHLIGHTS: This research provides a catalog of nationally representative, 
preference-based EQ-5D score decrements associated with surviving a large set of 
injuries, based on patient-reported health status.Mean first-year QALY loss 
estimates range from 0.005 (sprains and strains of joints and adjacent muscles, 
n = 7067) to 0.109 (injury to nerves and spinal cord, n = 71).This article 
presents a novel methodology for assessing quality-of-life impacts for acute 
conditions by calculating the time elapsed between injury and health status 
elicitation. Researchers may explore adapting these methods to study other 
short-lived conditions and health states, such as COVID-19 or chemotherapy.

Winston Churchill statement promoting Gin and Tonic as a life saver during 
British Empire extension hides many truths. As a matter of fact, the modern 
cocktail is thought to be born in India where it was widely distributed by Royal 
Navy for its anti-malarial properties. The aim of the present work is to review 
and unveil the history of Gin and Tonic through the centuries. As a matter of 
facts, primitive Gin and Tonic protective effects were well understood by 
physicians far before the advent of the "germ theory" and its fortunate 
invention is one of the most fascinating approaches in the history of preventive 
medicine. Indeed, quinine, a compound with protective effects on the replicative 
cycle of Plasmodium spp was discovered in 18th Century and since 19th it become 
the main compound of tonic beverages such as Schweppe's ones. Interestingly, it 
was administered to British expatriates' seamen and soldiers in order to prevent 
febrile paroxysms. Soon after, British military doctors demonstrated that the 
addition of lime or lemon peels to tonics was effective in preventing scurvy. 
While, addition of alcoholic beverages and gin contributed to make more 
enjoyable the bitter and unpleasant taste of this beverages.
RESULTS: The spectacular voyage of Gin and Tonic teaches us that a popular 
recreational drink of our Century was a powerful prophylaxis which certainly 
helped British colonial expansion.

University of the Free State, Bloemfontein, South Africa.

BACKGROUND: Cancer is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Exercise is 
crucial for ameliorating the burden associated with cancer and its management. A 
broad review of exercise interventions for cancer patients is not available.
OBJECTIVE: Our study aims to review the documented exercise interventions 
prescribed for adult cancer patients aimed at ameliorating cancer-related and 
cancer treatment-induced symptoms in patients along the continuum of care.
METHODS: A three-step search strategy will be used, the research question was 
developed; the first step in the research process was identified and the search 
strategy was developed using the Participants-Concept-Context framework. English 
language publications from 15 electronic databases from 2011 to 2021 will be 
searched. The Joanna Briggs Institute methodology for scoping reviews will be to 
guide the review and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and 
Meta-Analyses extension for scoping reviews will be used for the report. The 
search strategy incorporated terms relevant to the research question. The 
reference lists of articles included in the review will be screened for 
additional papers. Searched articles will be screened to determine their 
eligibility for inclusion and a pretested data extraction form will be used to 
chart the extracted evidence.
RESULTS: This article presents a protocol for a scoping review on exercise 
interventions to affect symptoms in cancer patients from diagnosis to 
end-of-life care.
CONCLUSION: A broad review of exercise interventions for cancer management in 
adult patients will elucidate the characteristics and context of exercises used 
along the cancer care continuum.
CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Exercise interventions used as part of cancer management 
will be mapped out to provide an overview of such exercise interventions. This 
could enhance knowledge among exercise oncology experts regarding exercise 
interventions for different cancer patient populations.

BACKGROUND: Cystic fibrosis (CF) care and the life expectancy of affected 
patients have substantially improved in recent decades, leading to an increased 
number of patients being diagnosed with comorbidities, including cancers. Our 
objective was to characterize the epidemiology of cancers between 2006 and 2017 
in CF patients with and without a lung transplant.
METHODS: Medical records of CF patients from 2006 to 2016 in the French CF 
Registry were linked to their corresponding claims data (SNDS). The annual 
prevalence and incidence rates of cancers were estimated from 2006 to 2017 in CF 
patients without lung transplant and in those with lung transplant after 
transplantation.
RESULTS: Of the 7,671 patients included in the French CF Registry, 6,187 
patients (80.7%) were linked to the SNDS; among them, 1,006 (16.3%) received a 
lung transplant. The prevalence of any cancer increased between 2006 and 2017, 
from 0.3 to 1.0% and from 1.3 to 6.3% in non-transplanted and transplanted 
patients, respectively. When compared to the general population, the incidence 
of cancer was significantly higher in both non-transplanted [Standardized 
Incidence Ratio (SIR) = 2.57, 95%CI 2.05 to 3.17] and transplanted (SIR = 19.76, 
95%CI 16.45 to 23.55) patients. The median time between transplant and the first 
cancer was 3.9 years. Among the 211 incident cancer cases, the most frequent 
malignant neoplasms were skin neoplasm (48 cases), lung cancers (31 cases), 
gastro-intestinal (24 cases), and hematologic cancers (17 cases).
CONCLUSION: The overall burden of cancer in CF patients is high, particularly 
following lung transplantation. Therefore, specific follow-up, screening and 
cancer prevention for CF patients with transplants are necessary.

BACKGROUND: Disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) are used to evaluate the 
relative burden of diseases in populations to help set prevention or treatment 
priorities. The impact of parental cardiovascular health (CVH) on healthy life 
years lost from cardiovascular disease (CVD) in adult offspring is unknown. We 
compared parent-offspring CVD DALYs trends over the life course and examined the 
association of parental CVH with offspring CVD DALYs.
METHODS: Using data from the Framingham Heart Study, 4814 
offspring-mother-father trios were matched for age at selected baseline exams. 
CVH score was computed from the number of CVH metrics attained at recommended 
levels: poor (0-2), intermediate (3-4), and ideal (5-7). CVD DALYs were defined 
as the sum of years of life lost and years lived with CVD. Age-sex-standardized 
life expectancy and disability weights were derived from the actuarial life 
tables and Global Burden of Disease study, respectively. Multivariable-adjusted 
linear regression was used to investigate the association of parental CVH with 
offspring CVD DALYs.
RESULTS: Over an equal 47-year follow-up, parents lost nearly twice the number 
of CVD DALYs compared to their offspring (23 234 versus 12 217). However, 
age-adjusted CVD DALYs were higher at younger ages and similar along the life 
course for parents and offspring. One-unit increase in parental CVH was 
associated with 5 healthy life months saved in offspring. Offspring of mothers 
with ideal versus poor CVH had 3 healthy life years saved (β=-3.0 DALYs [95% CI, 
-5.6 to -0.3]). No statistically significant association was found between 
paternal CVH categories and offspring CVD DALYs.
CONCLUSIONS: Higher maternal and paternal CVH were associated with increased 
healthy life years in offspring; however, the association was strongest between 
mothers and offspring. Investment in CVH promotion along the life course has the 
potential to reduce the burden of CVD in the current and future generation of 
adults.

BACKGROUND: Lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS) and medical therapy are 2 
available treatment options in dealing with severe emphysema, which is a chronic 
lung disease. However, or there are currently limited guidelines on the timing 
of LVRS for patients with different characteristics.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to assess the timing of receiving LVRS 
in terms of patient outcomes, taking into consideration a patient's 
characteristics.
METHODS: A finite-horizon Markov decision process model for patients with severe 
emphysema was developed to determine the short-term (5 y) and long-term timing 
of emphysema treatment. Maximizing the expected life expectancy, expected 
quality-adjusted life-years, and total expected cost of each treatment option 
were applied as the objective functions of the model. To estimate parameters in 
the model, the data provided by the National Emphysema Treatment Trial were 
used.
RESULTS: The results indicate that the treatment timing strategy for patients 
with upper-lobe predominant emphysema is to receive LVRS regardless of their 
specific characteristics. However, for patients with non-upper-lobe-predominant 
emphysema, the optimal strategy depends on the age, maximum workload level, and 
forced expiratory volume in 1 second level.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the utilization of clinical trial data to 
gain insights into the timing of surgical treatment for patients with emphysema, 
considering patient age, observable health condition, and location of emphysema.
HIGHLIGHTS: Both short-term and long-term Markov decision process models were 
developed to assess the timing of receiving lung volume reduction surgery in 
patients with severe emphysema.How clinical trial data can be used to estimate 
the parameters and obtain short-term results from the Markov decision process 
model is demonstrated.The results provide insights into the timing of receiving 
lung volume reduction surgery as a function of a patient's characteristics, 
including age, emphysema location, maximum workload, and forced expiratory 
volume in 1 second level.

Complete androgen insensitivity syndrome is the most frequent cause of disorder 
of sexual development in 46 XY patients. It is caused by mutations of the AR 
gene coding for the androgen receptor. Transmission is X-linked and mutations 
are most of the time inherited. It leads to a complete lack of response to 
androgen resulting in the presence of female external genitalia in 46 XY 
patients, normal but undescended testes and lack of female internal genitalia 
due to the secretion of anti-Müllerian hormone by male gonads. Traditionally, 
gonadectomy was proposed before puberty to decrease the risk of gonadal 
malignancy. However, more recent studies underlined the benefits of postponing 
gonadectomy until after pubertal development. Benefits of deferred gonadectomy 
are spontaneous pubertal development through peripheral aromatization of 
testosterone into oestrogens and the chance for the patient to have an active 
role in the decision-making process. After gonadectomy, hormone replacement 
therapy is required in order to prevent complications due to hypogonadism such 
as osteoporosis, cardiovascular diseases and a reduction of life expectancy.

Publisher: L’insensibilité aux androgènes est l’étiologie principale des 
troubles du développement sexuel chez des patientes 46 XY. Elle est due à des 
mutations du gène AR qui code pour le récepteur des androgènes. Le mode de 
transmission est lié à l’X et les mutations sont le plus souvent héritées. Il en 
résulte une absence d’action des androgènes sur leurs récepteurs entraînant la 
présence d’organes génitaux externes féminins chez des patientes 46 XY, de 
testicules normalement développés en position abdominale ou inguinale et en 
l’absence d’organes génitaux internes féminins due à la sécrétion d’hormone 
anti-müllérienne par les gonades masculines. La gonadectomie était auparavant 
effectuée en période pré-pubertaire en raison du risque suspecté de 
développement de néoplasie maligne. Des données récentes suggèrent la 
possibilité de postposer cette intervention après le développement pubertaire. 
Le risque de transformation maligne pré-pubertaire des gonades est faible, et 
différer la gonadectomie permet un développement pubertaire naturel grâce à 
l’aromatisation périphérique de la testostérone en œstradiol. Ce délai permet 
d’impliquer activement la patiente dans la prise en charge de sa pathologie. 
Après la gonadectomie, un traitement hormonal substitutif par œstrogènes est 
indiqué pour prévenir les complications dues à l’hypogonadisme telles que 
l’ostéoporose, les maladies cardio-vasculaires et la réduction de l’espérance de 
vie.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Daridorexant is a dual orexin receptor antagonist for 
the treatment of insomnia. In two phase III, 12-week studies in patients with 
insomnia disorder, daridorexant improved sleep and daytime functioning while 
maintaining a favorable safety profile. The objective of this 40-week extension 
study was to assess the long-term safety and tolerability of daridorexant.
METHODS: Adults with insomnia disorder who completed the 12-week studies were 
invited to enroll in this double-blind extension study. Patients originally 
randomised to daridorexant (10 mg/25 mg/50 mg) remained on their respective 
treatments; patients randomised to placebo were re-randomised to daridorexant 25 
mg or placebo. The 40-week treatment period was followed by a 7-day placebo 
run-out. The primary objective was to assess safety/tolerability. Exploratory 
objectives were to evaluate the efficacy of daridorexant on sleep (self-reported 
total sleep time) and daytime functioning (Insomnia Daytime Symptoms and Impacts 
Questionnaire).
RESULTS: In total, 804 patients were enrolled in the study, of whom 801 received 
at least one dose of the study treatment and 550 patients (68.4%) completed the 
study. Overall incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events was similar across 
groups (35-40%). Daridorexant did not induce next-morning sleepiness and no 
withdrawal-related symptoms or rebound were observed after treatment 
discontinuation. Improvements in sleep and daytime functioning were maintained 
through to the end of the study and were most pronounced with daridorexant 50 
mg. Daridorexant 50 mg, compared with placebo, increased self-reported total 
sleep time by a least-squares mean of 20.4 (95% confidence interval [CI] 4.2, 
36.5), 15.8 (95% CI - 0.8, 32.5) and 17.8 (95% CI - 0.4, 35.9) minutes and 
decreased (i.e., improved) Insomnia Daytime Symptoms and Impacts Questionnaire 
total scores by a least-squares mean of - 9.3 (95% CI - 15.1, - 3.6), - 9.5 (95% 
CI - 15.4, - 3.5) and - 9.1 (95% CI - 15.6, - 2.7), at weeks 12, 24 and 36 of 
the extension study, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with daridorexant, for up to 12 months, was generally 
safe and well tolerated. Exploratory efficacy analyses suggest that the 
sustained improvements in sleep and daytime functioning with daridorexant 50 mg 
support its use for long-term treatment of insomnia disorder, without concerns 
of new safety signals.
CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03679884) [first posted: 21 
September, 2018], https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03679884 .

Plain Language Summary: Insomnia disorder is the long-term inability to fall 
asleep or stay asleep with a significant impact on daily life. Left inadequately 
treated, this disorder may increase the risk of other health problems. For 
patients with insomnia disorder who require a sleep medication, many drugs are 
not recommended for long-term use and there is an unmet need for one that can be 
used safely and effectively over the long term. Daridorexant is a new insomnia 
treatment that was approved for adults following positive results in two 12-week 
clinical studies. Both studies showed that, in patients with insomnia disorder, 
daridorexant improved night-time sleep and patients’ ability to function during 
the day, while avoiding major safety concerns. Patients who completed these two 
studies could continue into a 40-week extension study enabling the safety and 
tolerability of daridorexant to be investigated for up to 1 year. Treatment 
remained double blind for the entire 1-year period. The extension study showed 
that daridorexant, at all doses studied (10 mg, 25 mg, 50 mg), continued to be 
generally safe and well tolerated. Patients showed no signs of tolerance, 
physical dependence, rebound nor any excessive daytime sleepiness. Exploratory 
efficacy analyses suggest that improved night-time and daytime symptoms of 
insomnia were sustained, in particular with the highest approved dose, 50 mg, 
and there were no signs that the benefits of the drug were wearing off at the 
end of the 1 year. These results support the use of daridorexant 50 mg for the 
long-term treatment of insomnia disorder in adults.

Treatment of CML in pregnancy.

Trust, London, UK.

Since the introduction of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) at the beginning of 
the millennium, the outlook for patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) has 
improved remarkably. As such, the question of life expectancy and survival has 
become less problematic while quality of life and family planning have become 
more so. While TKIs are the cornerstone of CML management, their teratogenicity 
renders them contraindicated during pregnancy. In recent years, patients who 
satisfy standardized criteria can stop TKI therapy altogether, and indeed, in 
eligible patients who wish to become pregnant, these objectives overlap. 
However, not all patients satisfy these criteria. Some pregnancies are 
unplanned, and a number of patients are pregnant when diagnosed with CML. In 
these patients the way forward is less clear, and there remains a paucity of 
good evidence available to guide treatment. In this article, we summarize the
