A large international meta-analysis using primary data from 64 cohorts has 
quantified the increased risk of fracture associated with a previous history of 
fracture for future use in FRAX.
INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to quantify the fracture risk associated 
with a prior fracture on an international basis and to explore the relationship 
of this risk with age, sex, time since baseline and bone mineral density (BMD).
METHODS: We studied 665,971 men and 1,438,535 women from 64 cohorts in 32 
countries followed for a total of 19.5 million person-years. The effect of a 
prior history of fracture on the risk of any clinical fracture, any osteoporotic 
fracture, major osteoporotic fracture, and hip fracture alone was examined using 
an extended Poisson model in each cohort. Covariates examined were age, sex, 
BMD, and duration of follow-up. The results of the different studies were merged 
by using the weighted β-coefficients.
RESULTS: A previous fracture history, compared with individuals without a prior 
fracture, was associated with a significantly increased risk of any clinical 
fracture (hazard ratio, HR = 1.88; 95% CI = 1.72-2.07). The risk ratio was 
similar for the outcome of osteoporotic fracture (HR = 1.87; 95% CI = 
1.69-2.07), major osteoporotic fracture (HR = 1.83; 95% CI = 1.63-2.06), or for 
hip fracture (HR = 1.82; 95% CI = 1.62-2.06). There was no significant 
difference in risk ratio between men and women. Subsequent fracture risk was 
marginally downward adjusted when account was taken of BMD. Low BMD explained a 
minority of the risk for any clinical fracture (14%), osteoporotic fracture 
(17%), and for hip fracture (33%). The risk ratio for all fracture outcomes 
related to prior fracture decreased significantly with adjustment for age and 
time since baseline examination.
CONCLUSION: A previous history of fracture confers an increased risk of fracture 
of substantial importance beyond that explained by BMD. The effect is similar in 
men and women. Its quantitation on an international basis permits the more 
accurate use of this risk factor in case finding strategies.

Understanding how interactions among microevolutionary forces generate genetic 
population structure of exploited species is vital to the implementation of 
management policies that facilitate persistence. Philopatry displayed by many 
coastal shark species can impact gene flow and facilitate selection, and has 
direct implications for the spatial scales of management. Here, genetic 
structure of the blacktip shark (Carcharhinus limbatus) was examined using a 
mixed-marker approach employing mitochondrial control region sequences and 4339 
SNP-containing loci generated using ddRAD-Seq. Genetic variation was assessed 
among young-of-the-year sampled in 11 sites in waters of the United States in 
the western North Atlantic Ocean, including the Gulf of Mexico. Spatial and 
environmental analyses detected 68 nuclear loci putatively under selection, 
enabling separate assessments of neutral and adaptive genetic structure. Both 
mitochondrial and neutral SNP data indicated three genetically distinct 
units-the Atlantic, eastern Gulf, and western Gulf-that align with regional 
stocks and suggest regional philopatry by males and females. Heterogeneity at 
loci putatively under selection, associated with temperature and salinity, was 
observed among sites within Gulf units, suggesting local adaptation. 
Furthermore, five pairs of siblings were identified in the same site across 
timescales corresponding with female reproductive cycles. This indicates that 
females re-used a site for parturition, which has the potential to facilitate 
the sorting of adaptive variation among neighbouring sites. The results 
demonstrate differential impacts of microevolutionary forces at varying spatial 
scales and highlight the importance of conserving essential habitats to maintain 
sources of adaptive variation that may buffer species against environmental 
change.

INTRODUCTION: With the increase in life expectancy and a growing number of 
people suffering from obesity, bariatric and metabolic surgery is becoming a 
major concern in the elderly population. The study aimed to collect, systematize 
and present the available data on the surgical treatment of obesity among Polish 
patients over 65 years of age.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective study analysed patients over 65 years who 
underwent laparoscopic bariatric procedures in Poland from 2008 to 2022. The 
efficacy endpoints were percentage of excess weight loss (EWL%), percentage of 
total weight loss (%TWL), improvement in obesity-related diseases.
RESULTS: The group consisted of 284 patients (173 women, 60.9%). The mean 
follow-up was 47.5 months. The mean BMI before surgery was 43.1 kg/m2. 146 
(51.4%) patients had T2D, and 244 (85.9%) had HT. The most common procedure was 
sleeve gastrectomy (82.0%). The mean EWL% after surgery was 50.9%, and the mean 
TWL% after surgery was 20.6%. There was the statistically significant difference 
between AGB vs OAGB, SG vs OAGB in %EWL (p = 0.0116, p = 0.009, respectively) 
and RYGB vs OAGB in %TWL (p = 0.0291). After surgery, 93 patients (63.7%) had 
complete or partial remission of T2D, and 112 patients (45.9%) had complete or 
partial remission of HT.
CONCLUSION: Bariatric surgery appears to be a safe and effective method of 
treatment of obesity in patients over 65 years of age. OAGB seems to have better 
results in weight loss than SG, RYGB, and AGB in older patients.

PURPOSE: To provide real-life data on azole treatment outcomes and the role of 
surgery in the current management of invasive fungal rhinosinusitis complicated 
by orbitocranial fungal infection (OCFI).
METHODS: Data was collected retrospectively from a chart review from four 
participating centers and a systematic literature review. The study group 
included patients with OCFI treated with azole antifungals. The control cases 
were treated with other antifungal agents. The cranial and orbital involvement 
degree was staged based on the imaging. The extent of the surgical resection was 
also classified to allow for inter-group comparison.
RESULTS: There were 125 patients in the azole-treated group and 153 in the 
control group. Among the patients with OCFI cranial extension, 23% were operated 
on in the azole-treated group and 18% in the control group. However, meninges 
and brain resection were performed only in the controls (11% of patients) and 
never in the azole antifungals group. Orbital involvement required surgery in 
26% of azole-treated cases and 39% of controls. Despite a more aggressive 
cranial involvement, azole-treated patients' mortality was significantly lower 
than in controls, with an OCFI-specific mortality rate of 21% vs. 52%. A 
similar, though not statistically significant, trend was found for the extent of 
the orbital disease and surgery.
CONCLUSION: Despite less aggressive surgical intervention for cranial 
involvement, OCFI patients treated with azoles had a higher survival rate. This 
finding suggests we may improve morbidity with a more conservative surgical 
approach in conjunction with azole treatment. The same trend is emerging for 
orbital involvement.

As life expectancy of liver transplanted patients improves, new questions are 
arising to avoid progressive graft loss. The spectrum of chronic inflammation 
and fibrosis are known to be important triggers in the alteration of graft 
function. Liver biopsy remains the gold standard to better understand 
progressive, normal, and abnormal histological modifications of the graft. In 
parallel, the interest for metabolic steatosis development in 
post-transplantation is also growing. Long-term survival of these patients 
involves the management of comorbidities including metabolic syndrome and 
cardiovascular diseases. Early detection of altered graft parenchyma, and 
monitoring of its evolution are undoubtedly essential. Non-invasive methods 
including transient elastography and fibrosis biomarkers are attractive tools to 
avoid drawbacks and complications of liver biopsy. Accuracy of these methods are 
well-known in a pre-transplantation setting, but evidence is lacking in 
post-transplantation setting. We review current knowledge of progressive liver 
fibrosis and steatosis development after transplantation and non-invasive 
methods of their assessment.

OBJECTIVE: Understanding the global patterns of respiratory syncytial virus 
(RSV) is crucial for developing effective prevention and control strategies.
METHODS: Data on RSV-related burden were extracted from the Global Burden of 
Disease 2019. Joinpoint regression models were used to assess the global 
temporal trends of RSV and further stratified analyses were conducted according 
to the Socio-demographic Index (SDI), which is a composite measure of income, 
education, and total fertility. Age-period-cohort model was used to evaluate 
age, period, and cohort effects.
RESULTS: In 2019, the global age-standardized rate of mortality (ASMR) and 
disability-adjusted life years (ASR-DALYs) of RSV were 4.79/100,000 (95% 
uncertainty interval [95% UI]: 1.82/100,000-9.32/100,000) and 218.34/100,000 
(95% UI: 92.06/100,000-376.80/100,000), respectively. The burden of RSV was 
higher in men than women. The highest ASMR (10.26/100,000, 
3.80/100,000-20.16/100,000) and ASR-DALYs (478.71/100,000, 
202.40/100,000-840.85/100,000) were reported in low-SDI region. Although 
mortality and DALYs rates in all age groups declined globally, the pace of 
decline was not uniform across age groups. Mortality rate in the elderly over 70 
years surpassed that in children under 5 years in 2019.
CONCLUSION: This study highlights the need for targeted interventions to reduce 
the burden of RSV, particularly in low-SDI region, and among the elderly over 70 
years.

There is a powerful global trend toward deeper integration of digital twins into 
modern life driven by Industry 4.0 and 5.0. Defense, agriculture, engineering, 
manufacturing, and urban planning sectors have thoroughly incorporated digital 
twins to great benefit across their respective product lifecycles. Despite clear 
benefits, a digital twin framework for health and medical sectors is yet to 
emerge. This paper proposes a digital twin framework for precision 
neuromusculoskeletal health care. We build upon the International Standards 
Organization framework for digital twins for manufacturing by presenting best 
available computational models within a digital twin framework for clinical 
application. We map a use case for modeling Achilles tendon mechanobiology, 
highlighting how current modeling practices align with our proposed digital twin 
framework. Similarly, we map a use case for advanced neurorehabilitation 
technology, highlighting the role of a digital twin in control of systems where 
human and machine are interfaced. Future work must now focus on creating an 
informatic representation to govern how digital data are passed to, from, and 
within the digital twin, as well as specific standards to declare which 
measurement systems and modeling methods are acceptable to move toward 
widespread use of the digital twin framework for precision neuromusculoskeletal 
health care.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory multisystemic disease of 
unknown etiology and autoimmune nature that predominantly affects peripheral 
joints in a symmetrical fashion. Although much progress has been made in 
understanding the pathophysiology of RA, its etiology remains unknown. Tumor 
necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interleukin (IL)-6 play the important roles in the 
pathogenesis and maintenance of inflammation in RA. The presence of 
anti-citrullinated peptide antibodies aids in the diagnosis in patients with 
undifferentiated polyarthritis and is associated with a more aggressive RA. The 
natural history of RA causes joint deformity and disability, as well as reduced 
life expectancy, both due to increased cardiovascular risk, pulmonary 
involvement, infections, iatrogenesis or tumors. Early diagnosis and the use of 
targeted drugs to induce early remission have improved the RA prognosis.

In this review, we examine the current landscape of health resource utilization 
and cost-effectiveness data in the care of patient populations with immune 
thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. We focus on the therapeutic (therapeutic 
plasma exchange, glucocorticoids, rituximab, caplacizumab) and diagnostic 
(ADAMTS13 assay) health technologies employed in the care of patients with this 
rare disease. Health resource utilization and cost-effectiveness data are 
limited to the high-income country context. Measurement of TTP-specific utility 
weights in the high-income country context and collection of health resource 
utilization data in the low- and middle-income country settings would enable an 
evaluation of country-specific quality-adjusted life expectancy and 
cost-effectiveness of these therapeutic and diagnostic health technologies. This 
quantification of value is one way to mitigate cost concerns where they exist.

INTRODUCTION: Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a chronic medical condition that results 
in significant health implications and reduced life expectancy. The 
International Diabetes Federation (IDF) estimated that in 2021, 51.8% of all 
deaths of people under 60 years old in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) 
region were related to diabetes. Bariatric surgery has been demonstrated to be a 
safe and effective treatment for T2D in different populations worldwide, though 
few specific data exist on outcomes of procedures in the MENA region. The aim of 
this study was to compare the safety and postoperative outcomes between patients 
with and without T2D undergoing primary bariatric surgery at a tertiary referral 
academic medical center in the United Arab Emirates.
METHODS: All patients who underwent primary metabolic surgery between September 
2015 and July 2020 were retrospectively reviewed from a prospective database. 
Group 1 included patients with T2D, and Group 2 included patients without T2D. 
Patients undergoing revisional or correctional operations were excluded. The 
procedure performed was based on surgeon discretion in discussion with a 
multidisciplinary team and the patient. Demographics as well as perioperative 
and postoperative results were examined.
RESULTS: Our study included 542 patients, 160 (29.5%) with T2D and 382 (70.5%) 
with non-T2D. Mean age was 44.5 years (range 16-70) in the T2D group and 33.3 
years (range 15-63) in the non-T2D group; median BMI was 41.8 ± 7.3 and 43.2 ± 
7.2, respectively. The T2D group was 37.5% male and 62.5% female, and the 
non-T2D group was 38.7% male and 61.3% female. There were no significant 
differences in comorbidities. In the T2D group, 45.6% of patients underwent 
Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and 54.4% sleeve gastrectomy. In the non-TD2 group, 
42.7% of patients received Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and 57.3% sleeve 
gastrectomy. There were no statistically significant differences in 
postoperative ED visits (21.8% vs. 24.3%, p = 0.21), minor complications within 
30 days (4.3% vs. 5.2%, p = 0.67), readmission rates (5.6% vs. 4.9%, p = 0.77), 
re-operation rates (3.7% vs. 1.5%, p = 0.11), median hospital stay (2.0 days vs. 
3.0, p = 0.05), or complications after 30 days (6.2% vs. 11.2%, p = 0.07). There 
were no deaths either group.
CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort of patients from the MENA region, bariatric surgery 
in T2D patients is safe and effective, with perioperative outcomes comparable to 
those of non-T2D patients. To the best of our knowledge, our postoperative 
findings, which are the first report in the MENA region, are consistent with 
studies published in North America and Europe.

Patients with pancreatic cancer who develop irreversible cancer cachexia have a 
life expectancy of less than 3 months. Therefore, it is extremely important to 
evaluate the patient's nutritional status as early as possible and to implement 
an appropriate nutritional intervention in order to reduce the risk of further 
weight loss and/or muscle loss, which affect the outcomes of cancer treatment 
and the correct nutritional treatment in patients with pancreatic cancer. A 
literature review was performed by using the PubMed and Cochrane quick search 
methodology. The main purpose of this review was to present the current approach 
to nutritional treatment in pancreatic cancer. The review included publications, 
most of which concerned clinical nutrition as part of the phase of treatment of 
patients with pancreatic cancer, nutritional and metabolic disorders in 
pancreatic cancer, and the period after pancreatic resection. Some of the 
publications concerned various nutritional interventions in patients with 
pancreatic cancer undergoing chemotherapy or surgical treatment (nutritional 
support before surgery, after surgery, or during palliative treatment). There is 
an unmet need for integrated nutritional therapy as a key part of the 
comprehensive care process for PC patients. Nutritional counseling is the first 
line of nutritional treatment for malnourished cancer patients, but pancreatic 
enzyme replacement therapy also constitutes the cornerstone of nutritional 
treatment for relieving symptoms of indigestion and maintaining or improving 
nutritional status.

In recent years, immunotherapy has been postulated as one of the most effective 
strategies in the fight against cancer. The greatest success in this field has 
been achieved with the inhibition of molecules involved in slowing down the 
adaptive immune response by immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). Despite its 
efficacy, ICI treatment has side effects. Regarding kidney damage, it is 
estimated that 4.9% of patients treated with ICIs develop renal injury. 
Furthermore, cancer patients who develop renal dysfunction have a worse 
prognosis. Current diagnostics are insufficient to predict the underlying renal 
injury and to identify the type of damage. Our hypothesis is that the renal 
injury could be subclinical, so the possibility of using new urinary biomarkers 
could be a useful diagnostic tool that would allow these patients to be managed 
in a preventive (risk biomarkers) and early (early biomarkers) way and even to 
clarify whether the renal damage is due to this therapy or to other factors 
(differential diagnostic biomarkers). A prospective study to validate risk and 
early and differential biomarkers in patients treated with ICIs is proposed to 
test this hypothesis. The results derived from this study will improve the 
clinical practice of cancer treatment with ICIs and therefore the life 
expectancy and quality of life of patients. Trial Registration: 
ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04902846.

Hardaliye, as one of the oldest and lesser known traditional beverages, is 
produced using red grape pomace from wine production. This drink production is 
achieved through lactic acid fermentation, with the addition of sour cherry 
leaves and mustard seeds-either heat-treated, grinded, or whole-in various 
concentrations. Hardaliye has a very short shelf life; thus, efforts have 
recently been made to process hardaliye with novel processing technologies in 
order to achieve shelf-life extension. Therefore, the high-hydrostatic-pressure 
(HHP) processing of hardaliye was performed to determine its impact on important 
properties, including in microbial inactivation and shelf-life extension, with 
respect to a Box-Behnken experimental design. Maximum log reductions of 5.38 ± 
0.6, 5.10 ± 0.0, 5.05 ± 0.2, and 4.21 ± 0.0 with HHP were obtained for 
Brettanomyces bruxellensis, total mesophilic aerobic bacteria, Lactobacillus 
brevis, and total mold and yeast, respectively. The processing parameters of 490 
MPa and 29 °C for 15 min were found as the optimal conditions, with the response 
variables of an optical density at 520 nm and the inactivation of L. brevis. The 
samples processed at the optimal conditions were stored at both 4 and 22 °C for 
228 d. While the non-treated control samples at 4 and 22 °C were spoiled at 15 
and 3 d, the HHP-treated samples were spoiled after 228 and 108 d at 4 and 22 
°C, respectively.

Hummus is a traditional and very popular Mediterranean ready-to-eat (RTE) food, 
with growing popularity worldwide. However, it has a high water activity and is 
susceptible to microbial growth and post-process contamination that limit its 
quality and shelf-life. For this purpose, the present study compared the use of 
several antimicrobials, alone or in combination, for hummus preservation during 
storage (4 °C), for up to 45 days. The chemical preservative potassium sorbate 
0.09% (S) was evaluated, along with three natural antimicrobials: garlic 1.25% 
(G); vinegar 5% (V); natamycin 0.002% (N); or their combination: garlic 
1.25%-vinegar 5% (GV); vinegar 5%-natamycin 0.002% (VN); garlic 1.25%-natamycin 
0.002% (GN); and garlic 1.25%-vinegar 5%-natamycin 0.002% (GVN) to increase the 
shelf-life of hummus. A thymol and carvacrol mixture 0.2% (O) was also assessed 
to preserve and develop a new oregano-flavored hummus. All treatments that 
included vinegar used alone or in combination had significantly higher 
antimicrobial effectiveness than the other treatments. They achieved 2.2-3.2, 
1.8-3.1, and 1.4-2.1 log reductions in total aerobic counts (TAC), Pseudomonas 
spp., and lactic acid bacteria (LAB), respectively, as compared to the control 
samples © at day 21. Therefore, the shelf-life of C, S, N, G, GN, and O was 
around (ca.) 19 days, compared to an extended one of ca. 25 days for V and VN, 
and ca. 30 days for GV and GVN. Sensory analysis showed the highest 
acceptability for C, N, S, V, and VN, followed by GV and GVN, and the lowest was 
for G, GN, and finally O. The findings provide potential alternatives to 
chemical preservatives, which could be used for natural hummus preservation and 
shelf-life extension.

Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is one of the most common chronic diseases in childhood, 
with a progressively increasing incidence. T1D management requires lifelong 
insulin treatment and ongoing health care support. The main goal of treatment is 
to maintain blood glucose levels as close to the physiological range as 
possible, particularly to avoid blood glucose fluctuations, which have been 
linked to morbidity and mortality in patients with T1D. Indeed, the guidelines 
of the International Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Diabetes (ISPAD) 
recommend a glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level < 53 mmol/mol (<7.0%) for young 
people with T1D to avoid comorbidities. Moreover, diabetic disease strongly 
influences the quality of life of young patients who must undergo continuous 
monitoring of glycemic values and the administration of subcutaneous insulin. In 
recent decades, the development of automated insulin delivery (AID) systems 
improved the metabolic control and the quality of life of T1D patients. 
Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) combined with continuous glucose 
monitoring (CGM) devices connected to smartphones represent a good therapeutic 
option, especially in young children. In this literature review, we revised the 
mechanisms of the currently available technologies for T1D in pediatric age and 
explored their effect on short- and long-term diabetes-related comorbidities, 
quality of life, and life expectation.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia in older adults, 
having a significant global burden and increasing prevalence. Current treatments 
for AD only provide symptomatic relief and do not cure the disease. Physical 
activity has been extensively studied as a potential preventive measure against 
cognitive decline and AD. Recent research has identified a hormone called 
irisin, which is produced during exercise, that has shown promising effects on 
cognitive function. Irisin acts on the brain by promoting neuroprotection by 
enhancing the growth and survival of neurons. It also plays a role in 
metabolism, energy regulation, and glucose homeostasis. Furthermore, irisin has 
been found to modulate autophagy, which is a cellular process involved in the 
clearance of protein aggregates, which are a hallmark of AD. Additionally, 
irisin has been shown to protect against cell death, apoptosis, oxidative 
stress, and neuroinflammation, all of which are implicated in AD pathogenesis. 
However, further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms and 
therapeutic potential of irisin in AD. Despite the current gaps in knowledge, 
irisin holds promise as a potential therapeutic target for slowing cognitive 
decline and improving quality of life in AD patients.

Sciences, Hokkaido University, K12-N5, Kita-Ku, Sapporo 060-0812, Japan.

(1) Background: Subjective well-being (SWB) is internationally recognized as an 
important health-related factor for most age groups and is particularly 
influential for life quality and expectancy in independent, healthy, 
community-dwelling older adults. However, the physical function and community 
participation correlates of SWB in independent living older adults in 
super-aging societies and other influencing factors remain underexplored. (2) 
Methods: A total of 926 independent, healthy, community-dwelling older adults 
aged 65 years and above registered in Yokohama, Japan, were included. 
Respondents' mean age was 78.1 years (standard deviation = 6.7), and 74.0% were 
women. The dependent variable was SWB. The independent variables were 
respondents' demographic characteristics, physical factors (visual, hearing, and 
cognitive functions, and mobility), and community and social factors 
(participation in community groups, social networks, and community commitment. 
(3) Results: The mean (standard deviation) WHO-5 score was 16.3 (5.1). 
Significant factors associated with WHO-5 score were visual function (odds ratio 
[OR]: 0.708; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.352-0.690), hearing function (OR: 
0.615; CI: 0.431-0.878), community groups (OR: 1.310; CI: 1.003-1.059), 
community commitments (OR: 1.180; CI: 1.132-1.231), and social networks (OR:
