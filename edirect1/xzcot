recollect personally experienced episodes associated with a specific affective, 
spatial, and temporal context. However, most of the neuropsychological and 
experimental tasks currently employed to assess EM consist in learning simple 
material (e.g., list of words) in highly stereotyped contexts. In the same vein, 
classical paper-and-pencil or numeric remediation tools have shown their 
limitations in the transfer of acquired skills to daily life. Virtual reality 
(VR), thanks to its immersive properties, and the possibility of delivering 
realistic and complex scenarios, seems a promising tool to address the 
limitations of the assessment and remediation of EM. Here, we review existing 
studies employing VR in normal and pathological aging to assess and reeducate 
EM. Overall, we show that VR has been mainly used via non-immersive systems. 
Further studies should, therefore, test the impact of different degrees of 
immersion. Moreover, there is a lack of VR remediation tools specifically 
targeting EM. We propose that future studies should fill this gap, addressing in 
particular the adaptivity of VR remediation protocols.

Clinical use of antibiotics is becoming more widespread with each passing day 
for various infectious diseases. This has caused an abrupt increase in 
hypersensitivity reactions linked to these drugs, sometimes preventing the use 
of first-line therapies. In these patients, clinical presentation may vary from 
mild skin infections to life-threatening anaphylactic reactions. Our patient is 
a 30 year old female with past medical history significant for mast cell 
activation syndrome and multiple autoimmune diseases who presented with chief 
complaint of fever. Patient was diagnosed with MSSA bacteremia requiring the 
start of an antibiotic regimen. Mariana castells protocol was used for 
desensitizing the patient before starting her on antibiotic regimen. Patient was 
desensitized in 2 days using the standard 12-step protocol and started on 
cefazolin for her long-term treatment of the infection. No acute episodes of 
drug hypersensitivity were reported. During the course of her hospital 
admission, she improved significantly with no complications. Our patient having 
a history of both multiple autoimmune diseases and mast-cell activation syndrome 
tolerated the protocol well with no complications. Appropriate treatment of the 
reactions including epinephrine use and management with personalized 
desensitization protocols can enhance the quality of life, life expectancy, and 
safety of an increasing at risk population of patients with infectious diseases 
allergic to their best medications. Protocols, such as mariana castells, are 
completely safe in autoimmune disorders and should be utilized as the standard 
of care in appropriate patient population.

BACKGROUND: Lenvatinib demonstrated a treatment effect on overall survival by 
the statistical confirmation of non-inferiority to sorafenib for the first-line 
treatment of uHCC. The objective of this study was to evaluate the 
cost-effectiveness of lenvatinib compared with sorafenib for patients with uHCC 
in Japan.
METHODS: A partitioned-survival model was developed to estimate the 
cost-effectiveness of lenvatinib versus sorafenib when treating uHCC patients 
over a lifetime horizon and considering total public healthcare expenditure. 
Efficacy and safety data were extracted from the REFLECT trial. Utility values 
were derived from the European Quality-of-Life 5-Dimension Questionnaire, 
conducted with patients enrolled in the REFLECT trial. Direct medical costs, 
such as primary drug therapy, outpatient visits, diagnostic tests, 
hospitalization, post-progression therapy, and adverse-event treatments, were 
included. Cost parameters unavailable in the clinical trial or publications were 
obtained based on the consolidated clinical standards from a Delphi panel of 
four Japanese medical experts.
RESULTS: For lenvatinib versus sorafenib, the incremental cost was - 406,307 
Japanese Yen (JPY), and the incremental life years and quality-adjusted life 
years (QALYs) were 0.27 and 0.23, respectively. Thus, lenvatinib dominated 
sorafenib, due to the mean incremental cost-effectiveness ratio falling in the 
fourth quadrant, conferring more benefit at lower costs compared with sorafenib. 
The probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that 81.3% of the simulations were 
favorable to lenvatinib compared with sorafenib, with a payer's 
willingness-to-pay-per-QALY of 5 million JPY.
CONCLUSIONS: Lenvatinib was cost-effective compared with sorafenib for the 
first-line treatment of uHCC in Japan.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia worldwide. Due to 
demographic change in higher income countries and rising life expectancy in 
middle- and low-income countries, the prevalence of AD will increase 
significantly in the coming years. In the search for effective AD prevention, 
the role of stress in the development of AD has come into focus. There is 
increasing evidence that chronic exposure to stress is a risk factor for AD and 
may also adversely affect the course of the disease. In our review, we present 
the current literature on the association of specific personality traits and the 
risk of developing AD. We also report on findings on dementia risk in patients 
with posttraumatic stress disorder. Furthermore, we describe the role of anxiety 
symptoms in AD and give a brief overview over the biological mechanisms behind 
the association of stress and AD.

BACKGROUND: The net impact on population health and health system costs of 
vaporized nicotine products is uncertain. We modeled, with uncertainty, the 
health and cost impacts of liberalizing the vaporized nicotine market for a 
high-income country, New Zealand (NZ).
METHODS: We used a multistate life-table model of 16 tobacco-related diseases to 
simulate lifetime quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and health system costs at 
a 0% discount rate. We incorporated transitions from never, former, and current 
smoker states to, and from, regularly using vaporized nicotine and literature 
estimates for relative risk of disease incidence for vaping compared with 
smoking.
RESULTS: Compared with continuation of baseline trends in smoking uptake and 
cessation rates and negligible vaporized nicotine use, we projected liberalizing 
the market for these products to gain 236,000 QALYs (95% uncertainty interval 
[UI] = 27,000 to 457,000) and save NZ$3.4 billion (2011 NZ$) (95% UI = NZ$370 
million to NZ$7.1 billion) or US$2.5 billion (2017 NZ$). However, estimates of 
net health gains for 0- to 14-year olds and 65+ year olds had 95% UIs including 
the null. Uncertainty around QALYs gained was mainly driven by uncertainty 
around the impact of vaporized nicotine products on population-wide cessation 
rates and the relative health risk of vaping compared with smoking.
CONCLUSIONS: This modeling suggested that a fairly permissive regulatory 
environment around vaporized nicotine products achieves net health gain and cost 
savings, albeit with wide uncertainty. Our results suggest that optimal 
strategies will also be influenced by targeted smoking cessation advice, 
regulations around chemical constituents of these products, and marketing and 
age limits to prevent youth uptake of vaping.

University of Health Sciences, Pomona, California, USA.

Pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of death in the United States and 
has a 5-year life expectancy of ~8%. Currently, only a few drugs have been 
approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for pancreatic cancer 
treatment. Despite available drug therapy and ongoing clinical investigations, 
the high prevalence and mortality associated with pancreatic cancer mean that 
there is an unmet chemopreventive and therapeutic need. From ongoing studies 
with various novel formulations, it is evident that the development of smart 
drug delivery systems will improve delivery of drug cargo to the pancreatic 
target site to ensure and enhance the therapeutic/chemoprevention efficacy of 
existing drugs and newly designed drugs in the future. With this in view, 
nanotechnology is emerging as a promising avenue to enhance drug delivery to the 
pancreas via both passive and active targeting mechanisms. Research in this 
field has grown extensively over the past decade, as is evident from available 
scientific literature. This review summarizes the recent advances that have 
brought nanotechnology-based formulations to the forefront of pancreatic cancer 
treatment.

BACKGROUND: The 'German Consortium for Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer' 
(GC-HBOC) offers women with a family history of breast and ovarian cancer 
genetic counseling. The aim of this modeling study was to evaluate the 
cost-effectiveness of genetic testing for BRCA 1/2 in women with a high familial 
risk followed by different preventive interventions (intensified surveillance, 
risk-reducing bilateral mastectomy, risk-reducing bilateral 
salpingo-oophorectomy, or both mastectomy and salpingo-oophorectomy) compared to 
no genetic test.
METHODS: A Markov model with a lifelong time horizon was developed for a cohort 
of 35-year-old women with a BRCA 1/2 mutation probability of ≥ 10%. The 
perspective of the German statutory health insurance (SHI) was adopted. The 
model included the health states 'well' (women with increased risk), 'breast 
cancer without metastases', 'breast cancer with metastases', 'ovarian cancer', 
'death', and two post (non-metastatic) breast or ovarian cancer states. Outcomes 
were costs, quality of life years gained (QALYs) and life years gained (LYG). 
Important data used for the model were obtained from 4380 women enrolled in the 
GC-HBOC.
RESULTS: Compared with the no test strategy, genetic testing with subsequent 
surgical and non-surgical treatment options provided to women with deleterious 
BRCA 1 or 2 mutations resulted in additional costs of €7256 and additional QALYs 
of 0,43 (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of €17,027 per QALY; cost per LYG: 
€22,318). The results were robust in deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity 
analyses.
CONCLUSION: The provision of genetic testing to high-risk women with a BRCA1 and 
two mutation probability of ≥ 10% based on the individual family cancer history 
appears to be a cost-effective option for the SHI.

BACKGROUND: Beijing municipal government launched a Free Drug Program (FDP) in 
2013 to reduce the financial burden of schizophrenia patients.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the cost-effectiveness of a FDP designed for schizophrenia 
patients in Beijing, China.
METHODS: In all, 2007 schizophrenia patients enrolled in an FDP (FDP group) and 
2001 schizophrenia patients who were not enrolled (non-FDP group) were randomly 
selected for a cross-sectional survey in August 2015. The study sought to 
develop a cost-effectiveness model to assess the FDP from the societal 
perspective in Beijing, China. Scenario analyses explored the potential 
strategies to further improve the cost-effectiveness of the FDP.
RESULTS: The FDP group was associated with lower socioeconomic status and more 
advanced disease than the non-FDP group (unemployment rate: 48.8% vs 37.3%, 
p < .001; disability rate: 91.2% vs 64.1%, p < .001; overall comorbidity rate: 
34.9% vs 28.8%, p < .001). The two groups exhibited similar disease severity and 
quality of life. However, the FDP group was associated with significantly lower 
direct medical costs (coefficient -.342, p = .003) and indirect costs 
(coefficient -.473, p < .001) than the non-FDP group. The base case incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) per gained quality-adjusted life year (QALY) for 
the FDP group relative to the non-FDP group was 1.480 times of 2015 China's 
gross domestic product per capita. Home drug delivery and long-lasting injection 
treatment could reduce the ICER for the FDP group relative to the non-FDP group 
by 57.8% and 29.8%, respectively.
CONCLUSION: The FDP was attractive to schizophrenia patients with lower 
socioeconomic status and more advanced disease. The cost-effectiveness of the 
FDP was acceptable and could be further improved by home drug delivery and 
long-lasting injection treatment.

BACKGROUND: The World Health Organization (WHO) and the International Labour 
Organization (ILO) are developing a joint methodology for estimating the 
national and global work-related burden of disease and injury (WHO/ILO joint 
methodology), with contributions from a large network of experts. In this paper, 
we present the protocol for two systematic reviews of parameters for estimating 
the number of deaths and disability-adjusted life years from melanoma and 
non-melanoma skin cancer (or keratinocyte carcinoma) from occupational exposure 
to solar ultraviolet radiation, to inform the development of the WHO/ILO joint 
methodology.
OBJECTIVES: We aim to systematically review studies on occupational exposure to 
solar ultraviolet radiation (Systematic Review 1) and systematically review and 
meta-analyse estimates of the effect of occupational exposure to solar 
ultraviolet radiation on melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancer (Systematic 
Review 2), applying the Navigation Guide systematic review methodology as an 
organizing framework and conducting both systematic reviews in tandem and in a 
harmonized way.
DATA SOURCES: Separately for Systematic Reviews 1 and 2, we will search 
electronic academic databases for potentially relevant records from published 
and unpublished studies, including Ovid Medline, PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of 
Science. We will also search electronic grey literature databases, Internet 
search engines and organizational websites; hand-search reference list of 
previous systematic reviews and included study records and consult additional 
experts.
STUDY ELIGIBILITY AND CRITERIA: We will include working-age (≥15 years) workers 
in the formal and informal economy in any WHO and/or ILO Member State, but 
exclude children (<15 years) and unpaid domestic workers. For Systematic Review 
1, we will include quantitative studies on the prevalence of relevant levels of 
occupational exposure to solar ultraviolet radiation (i.e. <0.33 SED/d and 
≥0.33 SED/d) and of the total working time spent outdoors, stratified by 
country, sex, age and industrial sector or occupation, in the years 1960 to 
2018. For Systematic Review 2, we will include randomized controlled trials, 
cohort studies, case-control studies and other non-randomized intervention 
studies with an estimate of the effect of any occupational exposure to solar 
ultraviolet radiation (i.e., ≥0.33 SED/d) on the prevalence of, incidence of or 
mortality due to melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancer, compared with the 
theoretical minimum risk exposure level (i.e. <0.33 SED/d).
STUDY APPRAISAL AND SYNTHESIS METHODS: At least two review authors will 
independently screen titles and abstracts against the eligibility criteria at a 
first stage and full texts of potentially eligible records at a second stage, 
followed by extraction of data from qualifying studies. At least two review 
authors will assess the risk of bias and the quality of evidence, using the most 
suited tools currently available. For Systematic Review 2, if feasible, we will 
combine relative risks using meta-analysis. We will report results using the 
guidelines for accurate and transparent health estimates reporting (GATHER) for 
Systematic Review 1 and the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and 
meta-analyses guidelines (PRISMA) for Systematic Review 2.

BACKGROUND: Efforts to quantify the global burden of enteric fever are valuable 
for understanding the health lost and the large-scale spatial distribution of 
the disease. We present the estimates of typhoid and paratyphoid fever burden 
from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2017, 
and the approach taken to produce them.
METHODS: For this systematic analysis we broke down the relative contributions 
of typhoid and paratyphoid fevers by country, year, and age, and analysed trends 
in incidence and mortality. We modelled the combined incidence of typhoid and 
paratyphoid fevers and split these total cases proportionally between typhoid 
and paratyphoid fevers using aetiological proportion models. We estimated deaths 
using vital registration data for countries with sufficiently high data 
completeness and using a natural history approach for other locations. We also 
estimated disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) for typhoid and paratyphoid 
fevers.
FINDINGS: Globally, 14·3 million (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 12·5-16·3) cases 
of typhoid and paratyphoid fevers occurred in 2017, a 44·6% (42·2-47·0) decline 
from 25·9 million (22·0-29·9) in 1990. Age-standardised incidence rates declined 
by 54·9% (53·4-56·5), from 439·2 (376·7-507·7) per 100 000 person-years in 1990, 
to 197·8 (172·0-226·2) per 100 000 person-years in 2017. In 2017, Salmonella 
enterica serotype Typhi caused 76·3% (71·8-80·5) of cases of enteric fever. We 
estimated a global case fatality of 0·95% (0·54-1·53) in 2017, with higher case 
fatality estimates among children and older adults, and among those living in 
lower-income countries. We therefore estimated 135·9 thousand (76·9-218·9) 
deaths from typhoid and paratyphoid fever globally in 2017, a 41·0% (33·6-48·3) 
decline from 230·5 thousand (131·2-372·6) in 1990. Overall, typhoid and 
paratyphoid fevers were responsible for 9·8 million (5·6-15·8) DALYs in 2017, 
down 43·0% (35·5-50·6) from 17·2 million (9·9-27·8) DALYs in 1990.
INTERPRETATION: Despite notable progress, typhoid and paratyphoid fevers remain 
major causes of disability and death, with billions of people likely to be 
exposed to the pathogens. Although improvements in water and sanitation remain 
essential, increased vaccine use (including with typhoid conjugate vaccines that 
are effective in infants and young children and protective for longer periods) 
and improved data and surveillance to inform vaccine rollout are likely to drive 
the greatest improvements in the global burden of the disease.

Considering an increase in the life expectancy leading to a rise in the elderly 
population, it is important to recognize the changes that occur along the 
process of aging. Gastrointestinal (GI) changes in the elderly are common, and 
despite some GI disorders being more prevalent in the elderly, there is no GI 
disease that is limited to this age group. While some changes associated with 
aging GI system are physiologic, others are pathological and particularly more 
prevalent among those above age 65 years. This article reviews the most 
important GI disorders in the elderly that clinicians encounter on a daily 
basis. We highlight age-related changes of the oral cavity, esophagus, stomach, 
small and large bowels, and the clinical implications of these changes. We 
review epidemiology and pathophysiology of common diseases, especially as they 
relate to clinical manifestation in elderly. Details regarding management of 
specific disease are discussed in detail if they significantly differ from the 
management for younger groups or if they are associated with significant 
challenges due to side effects or polypharmacy. Cancers of GI tract are not 
included in the scope of this article.

MOTIVATION: Combining multiple layers of information underlying biological 
complexity into a structured framework represent a challenge in systems biology. 
A key task is the formalization of such information in models describing how 
biological entities interact to mediate the response to external and internal 
signals. Several databases with signalling information, focus on capturing, 
organizing and displaying signalling interactions by representing them as 
binary, causal relationships between biological entities. The curation efforts 
that build these individual databases demand a concerted effort to ensure 
interoperability among resources.
RESULTS: Aware of the enormous benefits of standardization efforts in the 
molecular interaction research field, representatives of the signalling network 
community agreed to extend the PSI-MI controlled vocabulary to include 
additional terms representing aspects of causal interactions. Here, we present a 
common standard for the representation and dissemination of signalling 
information: the PSI Causal Interaction tabular format (CausalTAB) which is an 
extension of the existing PSI-MI tab-delimited format, now designated PSI-MITAB 
2.8. We define the new term 'causal interaction', and related child terms, which 
are children of the PSI-MI 'molecular interaction' term. The new vocabulary 
terms in this extended PSI-MI format will enable systems biologists to model 
large-scale signalling networks more precisely and with higher coverage than 
before.
AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: PSI-MITAB 2.8 format and the new reference 
implementation of PSICQUIC are available online (https://psicquic.github.io/ and 
https://psicquic.github.io/MITAB28Format.html).
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics

The use of immunochemotherapy has improved the outcome of follicular lymphoma 
(FL). Recently, complete response at 30 months (CR30) has been suggested as a 
surrogate for progression-free survival. This study aimed to analyse the life 
expectancy of FL patients according to their status at 30 months from the start 
of treatment in comparison with the sex and age-matched Spanish general 
population (relative survival; RS). The training series comprised 263 patients 
consecutively diagnosed with FL in a 10-year period who needed therapy and were 
treated with rituximab-containing regimens. An independent cohort of 693 FL 
patients from the Grupo Español de Linfomas y Trasplante Autólogo de Médula Ósea 
(GELTAMO) group was used for validation. In the training cohort, 188 patients 
were in CR30, with a 10-year overall survival (OS) of 53% and 87% for non-CR30 
and CR30 patients, respectively. Ten-year RS was 73% and 100%, showing no 
decrease in life expectancy for CR30 patients. Multivariate analysis indicated 
that the FL International Prognostic Index was the most important variable 
predicting OS in the CR30 group. The impact of CR30 status on RS was validated 
in the independent GELTAMO series. In conclusion, FL patients treated with 
immunochemotherapy who were in CR at 30 months showed similar survival to a sex- 
and age-matched Spanish general population.

Essential thrombocythemia (ET) is a chronic myeloproliferative neoplasm 
characterized by thrombocytosis, increased risk of thrombotic/hemorrhagic events 
and clonal evolution into blast phase or myelofibrosis. Areas covered: The 
authors will discuss biology, diagnosis, prognosis, therapy, and outcome of ET. 
An accurate molecular-morphologic assessment is necessary in order to properly 
establish diagnosis and prognosis of ET. Stratification for thrombosis 
prediction is essential, and IPSET-t model is widely applied. The current 
treatment strategy is directed to lower the rate of vascular events using 
cytoreduction in patients at high risk. Prophylactic low dose aspirin indication 
is more uncertain. To date, therapies for patients who are resistant or 
intolerant to first-line treatments are scarce. Overall, life expectancy 
indicates an indolent disease, but IPSET model helps in predicting survival at 
the time of diagnosis. Expert opinion: Challenging for the future will be to 
share criteria for ET diagnosis with the community. New insights into the 
molecular pathogenesis of the disease will improve the prediction of clonal 
evolution and outcome, and lead to the use of disease-modifying treatments.

IMPORTANCE: Axicabtagene ciloleucel, a chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy, 
represents a new and potentially curative treatment option for B-cell lymphoma. 
It is expected to have long-term survival benefits; however, long-term survival 
data are limited.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate the long-term survival and cost-effectiveness of 
axicabtagene ciloleucel for treatment of relapsed or refractory B-cell lymphoma.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Economic evaluation study using a survival 
analysis that digitized and extrapolated survival curves published in the ZUMA-1 
trial (Safety and Efficacy of KTE-C19 in Adults With Refractory Aggressive 
Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma), which enrolled patients between November 2015 and 
September 2016 and had a maximum follow-up of 24 months. Five different survival 
models (standard parametric, flexible parametric, 2 mixture cure models, and a 
flexible parametric mixture model) were used to extrapolate the survival curves 
to a lifetime horizon from January through June 2018. A cost-effectiveness 
analysis, from both a trial-based and lifetime horizon, was also conducted to 
inform the value of this novel therapy. The model was based on data from 111 
patients with B-cell lymphoma who were enrolled in the ZUMA-1 trial.
INTERVENTIONS: One-time administration of axicabtagene ciloleucel compared with 
chemotherapy.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Undiscounted and discounted life-years (LYs) and 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), total costs, and incremental costs per LY 
and QALY gained.
RESULTS: The modeled cohort of 111 patients started at 58 years of age. At the 
end of the trial, treatment with axicabtagene ciloleucel resulted in 0.48 more 
LYs and 0.34 more QALYs than chemotherapy, producing a cost-effectiveness 
estimate of $896 600 per QALY for public payers and $1 615 000 per QALY for 
commercial payers. Extrapolated long-term survival for patients treated with 
axicabtagene ciloleucel ranged from 2.83 to 9.19 discounted LYs and from 2.07 to 
7.62 discounted QALYs. Incrementally, treatment with axicabtagene ciloleucel was 
associated with 1.89 to 5.82 discounted LYs and 1.52 to 4.90 discounted QALYs vs 
chemotherapy. With the use of these incremental estimates of survival, 
cost-effectiveness estimates ranged from $82 400 to $230 900 per QALY gained for 
public payers and from $100 400 to $289 000 per QALY gained for commercial 
payers.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Treatment with axicabtagene ciloleucel appears to be 
associated with incremental gains in survival over chemotherapy. The range in 
projected long-term survival was wide and reflected uncertainty owing to limited 
follow-up data. Cost-effectiveness is associated with long-term survival, with 
further evidence needed to reduce uncertainty.

IMPORTANCE: As the opioid epidemic evolves, it is vital to identify changes in 
the geographical distribution of opioid-related deaths, and the specific opioids 
to which those deaths are attributed, to ensure that federal and state public 
health interventions remain appropriately targeted.
OBJECTIVE: To identify changes in the geographical distribution of 
opioid-related mortality across the United States by opioid type.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Cross-sectional study using joinpoint 
modeling and life table analysis of individual-level data from the National 
Center for Health Statistics on 351 630 US residents who died from 
opioid-related causes from January 1, 1999, to December 31, 2016, for all of the 
United States and the District of Columbia. The analysis was conducted from 
September 6 to November 23, 2018.
EXPOSURES: Deaths involving any opioid, heroin, synthetic opioids, and natural 
and semisynthetic opioids.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Opioid-related mortality rate, annual percent change 
in the opioid-related mortality rate, and life expectancy lost at age 15 years 
by state and opioid type.
RESULTS: From 1999 to 2016, a total of 231 264 men and 120 366 women died from 
opioid-related causes across the whole United States. Sixty-six observations 
were removed owing to missing data on age; therefore, 351 564 US residents were 
included in this study. The mean (SD) age at death was 39.8 (12.5) years for men 
and was 43.5 (12.9) years from women. Opioid-related mortality rates, especially 
from synthetic opioids, rapidly increased in all of the eastern United States. 
In most states, mortality associated with natural and semisynthetic opioids (ie, 
prescription painkillers) remained stable. In contrast, 28 states had mortality 
rates from synthetic opioids that more than doubled every 2 years (ie, annual 
percent change, ≥41%), including 12 with high mortality rates from synthetic 
opioids (>10 per 100 000 people). Among these 28 states, the mortality rate from 
natural and semisynthetic opioids ranged from 2.0 to 18.7 per 100 000 people 
(with a mean mortality rate of 6.0 per 100 000 people). The District of Columbia 
had the fastest rate of increase in mortality from opioids, more than tripling 
every year since 2013 (annual percent change, 228.3%; 95% CI, 169.7%-299.6%; 
P < .001), and a high mortality rate from synthetic opioids in 2016 (18.8 per 
100 000 people); the mortality rate from natural and semisynthetic opioids was 
6.9 per 100 000 people. Nationally, overall opioid-related mortality resulted in 
0.36 years of life expectancy lost in 2016, which was 14% higher than deaths due 
to firearms and 18% higher than deaths due to motor vehicle crashes; 0.17 years 
of the life expectancy lost was due specifically to synthetic opioids. In 2016, 
New Hampshire and West Virginia lost more than 1 year of life expectancy due to 
opioid-related mortality.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Opioid-related mortality, particularly mortality 
associated with synthetic opioids, has increased in the eastern United States. 
These findings indicate that policies focused on reducing opioid-related deaths 
may need to prioritize synthetic opioids and rapidly expanding epidemics in 
northeastern states and consider the potential for synthetic opioid epidemics 
outside of the heroin supply.

IMPORTANCE: Obesity is the most common risk factor for nonalcoholic 
steatohepatitis (NASH), the progressive form of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease 
that can lead to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Weight loss can be an 
effective treatment for obesity and may slow the progression of advanced liver 
disease.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of bariatric surgery in patients 
with NASH and compensated cirrhosis.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This economic evaluation study used a 
Markov-based state-transition model to simulate the benefits and risks of 
laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (SG), laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass 
(GB), and intensive lifestyle intervention (ILI) compared with usual care in 
patients with NASH and compensated cirrhosis and varying baseline weight 
(overweight, mild obesity, moderate obesity, and severe obesity). Patients faced 
varied risks of perioperative mortality and complications depending on the type 
of surgery they underwent. Data were collected on March 22, 2017.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Life-years, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), 
costs (in 2017 $US), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were 
calculated.
RESULTS: Demographic characteristics of the patient population were based on a 
previously published prospective study (n = 161). Patients in the model were 
41.0% female, and the base case age was 54 years. Compared with usual care, SG 
was associated with an increase in QALYs of 0.263 to 1.180 (bounds of ranges 
represent overweight to severe obesity); GB, 0.263 to 1.207; and ILI, 0.004 to 
0.216. Sleeve gastrectomy was also associated with an increase in life-years of 
0.693 to 1.930; GB, 0.694 to 1.947; and ILI, 0.012 to 0.114. With usual care, 
expected life-years in overweight, mild obesity, moderate obesity, and severe 
obesity were 12.939, 11.949, 10.976, and 10.095, respectively. With usual care, 
QALY in overweight was 6.418; mild obesity, 5.790; moderate obesity, 5.186; and 
severe obesity, 4.577. Sleeve gastrectomy was the most cost-effective option for 
patients across all weight classes assessed: ICER for SG in patients with 
overweight was $66 119 per QALY; mild obesity, $18 716 per QALY; moderate 
obesity, $10 274 per QALY; and severe obesity, $6563 per QALY. A threshold 
analysis on the procedure cost of GB found that for GB to be cost-effective, the 
cost of the surgery must be decreased from its baseline value of $28 734 by 
$4889 for mild obesity, by $3189 for moderate obesity, and by $2289 for severe 
obesity. In overweight patients, GB involved fewer QALYs than SG, and thus 
decreasing the cost of surgery would not result in cost-effectiveness.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Bariatric surgery could be highly cost-effective in
