INTRODUCTION: We aimed to assess the magnitude, temporal trends and 
socioeconomic disparity in the global burden of tracheal, bronchus and lung 
(TBL) from 1990 to 2017, using data extracted from the Global Burden of Diseases 
study (GBD 2017).
METHODS: We extracted data from the GBD 2017 study. A series of comparative and 
descriptive analyses of the disease burden between females and males and 
countries with different socioeconomic development statuses (Social Demographic 
Index, SDI). We also analysed the temporal trends of age-standardised 
disability-adjusted life year rates (ASDR) of TBL cancer at the global and 
super-regional level by means of joinpoint regression. Finally, we also 
calculated Concentration Index to explore trends of between-country inequality 
in cancer burden from 1990 to 2017.
RESULTS: During the past 27 years, the global incidence of TBL cancer cases and 
death cases has increased by 100% and 82.3% respectively, but the increase 
number was mainly influenced by population growth and ageing. After adjustment, 
from 1990 to 2017, the ASDR of TBL has increased by 3% and the age-standardised 
death rate has decreased by 7%. The global TBL cancer burden fell by 15.3%. The 
joinpoint analysis revealed that the overall trend of age-standardised TBL 
cancer burden for both females and males significantly changed twice between 
1990 and 2017, and it varied across countries with different SDI values and was 
also different between females and males. Age-standardised TBL cancer burden was 
more concentrated in higher socioeconomic development countries, but the 
development of healthy inequality showed a downward trend in males while showing 
an upward trend in females.
CONCLUSION: The magnitude and temporal trends of TBL cancer burden varied across 
countries and sex. This study highlighted the importance of crafting health 
policy to adapt to local conditions to manage the global burden of TBL cancers.

Neurological diseases are a major threat to global public health and prosperity. 
The number of patients with neurological diseases is increasing due to the 
population aging and increasing life expectancy. Autophagy is one of the crucial 
mechanisms to maintain nerve cellular homeostasis. Numerous studies have 
demonstrated that autophagy plays a dual role in neurological diseases. Long 
noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a vital class of noncoding RNAs with a length of 
more than 200 nucleotides and cannot encode proteins themselves but are 
expressed in most neurological diseases. An early phase, emerging knowledge has 
revealed that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are crucial in autophagy regulation. 
Furthermore, autophagy-associated lncRNAs can promote the development of 
neurological diseases or slow their progression. In this review, we introduce a 
general overview of lncRNA functional mechanisms and summarizes the recent 
progress of lncRNAs on autophagy regulation in neurological diseases to reveal 
possible novel therapeutic targets or useful biomarkers.

BACKGROUND: Under-five mortality rate is a leading indicator of the level of 
child health and the overall development in countries which indicate the quality 
of life of a given population, as measured by life expectancy.
OBJECTIVES: To identify and analyze factors that may have a significant 
influence on under-five mortality in Ethiopia.
METHODS: A national representative cross-sectional study and a quantitative 
study were conducted among 18,008 households selected based on 2016 EDHS data. 
The analysis was done using SPSS version 20 statistical software. Both bivariate 
and multivariable analyses were employed. In multivariable analysis, p value 
less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant and odds ratio with 95% 
CI (confidence interval) was used to assess the determinants of under-five child 
mortality.
RESULTS: A total of 10,641 children were included in the study with a 99.0% 
response rate. The U5CM for being a rural resident (AOR = 1.802, 95% CI: 1.251, 
2.595), not breastfeeding (AOR = 2.956, 95% CI: 2.490, 3.511), having multiple 
birth (AOR = 4.755, 95% CI: 3.440, 6.572), male gender (AOR = 1.363, 95% CI: 
1.153, 1.612), having first birth order (AOR = 1.592, 95% CI: 1.275, 1.992), and 
having family size six and above (AOR = 2.187, 95% CI: 1.769, 2.707). The 
increment of family size increases the risk of U5CM.
CONCLUSION: Multivariate logistic analysis reflected that place of residence, 
mothers' educational level, religion, current breastfeeding status, type of 
birth, sex of child, birth order, and family size were found to be significant 
predictors of under-five child mortality. So, government policy, nongovernmental 
organizations, and all concerned bodies should be focused on the major 
determinants of under-five child mortality and put in a lot more effort to 
reduce under-five child mortality, and health intervention policies should be 
revised.

The United States (US) has a complex healthcare system with a mix of public, 
private, nonprofit, and for-profit insurers, healthcare institutions and 
organizations, and providers. Unlike other developed countries, there is not a 
single payer healthcare system or a national pharmaceutical benefits 
scheme/plan. Despite spending over USD 10,000 per capita in healthcare, the US 
is among the worst performers compared to other developed countries in outcomes 
including life expectancy at birth, infant mortality, safety during childbirth, 
and unmanaged chronic conditions (e.g., asthma, diabetes). Primary care is 
delivered by physicians and advanced practice providers (i.e., nurse 
practitioners and physician assistants) in a variety of settings including large 
health systems, federally qualified health centers or free clinics that provide 
care to the underserved, or specific facilities for veterans or American Indian 
and Alaska native peoples. Since 2010, primary care delivery has shifted toward 
providing patient-centered, coordinated, comprehensive care focused on providing 
proactive, rather than reactive, population health management, and on the 
quality, versus volume, of care. Community pharmacy comprises a mix of 
independently owned, chain, supermarket and mass merchant pharmacies. Community 
pharmacies provide services such as immunizations, medication therapy 
management, medication packaging, medication synchronization, point-of-care 
testing and, in specific states where legislation has been passed, hormonal 
contraception, opioid reversal agents, and smoking cessation services. There has 
been criticism regarding the lack of standard terminology for services such as 
medication synchronization and medication therapy management, their components 
and how they should be provided, which hampers comparability across studies. One 
of the main challenges for pharmacists in the US is the lack of provider status 
at the federal level. This means that pharmacists are not allowed to use 
existing fee-for-service health insurance billing codes to receive reimbursement 
for non-dispensing services. In addition, despite there being regulatory 
infrastructure in multiple states, the extent of service implementation is 
either low or unknown. Research found that pharmacists face numerous barriers 
when providing some of these services. State fragmentation and the lack of a 
single pharmacy organization and vision for the profession are additional 
challenges.

Despite the life-extending success of antiretroviral pharmacotherapy in HIV 
infection (HIV), the prevalence of mild cognitive impairment in HIV remains 
high. Near-normal life expectancy invokes an emerging role for age-infection 
interaction and a potential synergy between immunosenescence and HIV-related 
health factors, increasing risk of cognitive and motor impairment associated 
with degradation in corticostriatal circuits. These neural systems are also 
compromised in Parkinson's disease (PD), which could help model the cognitive 
deficit pattern in HIV. This cross-sectional study examined three groups, age 
45-79 years: 42 HIV, 41 PD, and 37 control (CTRL) participants, tested at 
Stanford University Medical School and SRI International. Neuropsychological 
tests assessed executive function (EF), information processing speed (IPS), 
episodic memory (MEM), visuospatial processing (VSP), and upper motor (MOT) 
speed and dexterity. The HIV and PD deficit profiles were similar for EF, MEM, 
and VSP. Although only the PD group was impaired on MOT compared with CTRL, MOT 
scores were related to cognitive scores in HIV but not PD. Performance was not 
related to depressive symptoms, socioeconomic status, or CD4+ T-cell counts. The 
overlap of HIV-PD cognitive deficits implicates frontostriatal disruption in 
both conditions. The motor-cognitive score relation in HIV provides further 
support for the hypothesis that these processes share similar underlying 
mechanisms in HIV infection possibly expressed with or exacerbated by ageing.

Medical School, Ann Arbor.

IMPORTANCE: Owing to its tendency to recur, Dupuytren contracture often requires 
multiple treatments, which places additional economic burden on health care. The 
likelihood of contracture recurrence varies not only with treatment but also 
with disease characteristics, such as contracture severity and location, but 
prior cost-effectiveness analyses of Dupuytren contracture treatments have not 
considered these patient-specific disease characteristics.
OBJECTIVE: To identify the most cost-effective treatment regimen for patients 
with recurrent Dupuytren contracture.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This economic evaluation was conducted with 
state-transition microsimulation modeling using data from published studies and 
Medicare. A simulated cohort of 10 000 individuals with Dupuytren contracture 
was created. Patients could transition yearly between the following health 
states: symptom-free, symptomatic, and death. Available treatments were 
collagenase clostridium histolyticum injection, percutaneous needle aponeurotomy 
(PNA), and limited fasciectomy (LF); individuals randomly chose any treatment 
when symptomatic. Patients were limited to 3 rounds of treatment for a 
contracture affecting 1 joint, totaling 27 unique combinations. If the 
contracture recurred after 3 treatments, patients lived with the disease for the 
remainder of life.
EXPOSURES: PNA, collagenase clostridium histolyticum injection, or LF.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), total costs (in 
US dollars), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). A 
willingness-to-pay threshold of $100 000 per quality-adjusted life-year was used 
to assess cost-effectiveness.
RESULTS: For the base case scenario of a patient aged 60 years with recurrent, 
low-severity metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint contracture, repeated PNA treatment 
was the only cost-effective treatment (2 PNA treatments followed by LF vs 3 PNA 
treatments, ICER [Monte Carlo SE]: $212 647/QALY [$36 000/QALY]). For recurrent 
high-severity MCP joint contractures, treatment regimens composed of PNA and LF 
were cost-effective (ICER [Monte Carlo SE], $93 932/QALY [$16 500/QALY]). LF was 
cost-effective for high-severity MCP joint contracture (ICER [Monte Carlo SE], 
$98 624/QALY [$26 233/QALY]). For recurrent proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint 
contractures, PNA was the only cost-effective treatment, regardless of severity 
(eg, 2 PNA treatments followed by LF vs 3 PNA treatments for low-severity PIP 
joint contracture, ICER [Monte Carlo SE]: $263 726/QALY [$29 000/QALY]). Any 
combination with collagenase clostridium histolyticum injection compared with 3 
PNA treatments had an ICER greater than $100 000 per QALY. Probabilistic 
sensitivity analysis estimated a 44%, 15%, 41%, and 52% chance of a regimen 
consisting of only PNA being cost-effective in low-severity MCP, high-severity 
MCP, low-severity PIP, and high-severity PIP joint contractures, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The results of this study suggest that LF is a 
cost-effective intervention for recurrent high-severity MCP joint contractures. 
For recurrent low-severity MCP joint contractures and PIP joint contractures of 
all severity levels, PNA was the only cost-effective intervention. Collagenase 
clostridium histolyticum injections were not a cost-effective intervention for 
recurrent Dupuytren contracture and should not be preferred over PNA or LF.

AIM: To investigate the cost-effectiveness of Volar Locking Plate (VLP) compared 
to External Fixation (EF) for unstable dorsally displaced distal radius 
fractures in a 3-year perspective.
METHODS: During 2009-2013, patients aged 50-74 years with an unstable dorsally 
displaced distal radius fracture were randomised to VLP or EF. Primary outcome 
was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for VLP compared with EF. 
Data regarding health effects (Quality-adjusted life years, QALYs) was 
prospectively collected during the trial period until 3 years after surgery. 
Cost data was collected retrospectively for the same time period and included 
direct and indirect costs (production loss).
RESULTS: One hundred and thirteen patients (VLP n = 58, EF n = 55) had complete 
data until 3 years and were used in the analysis. At one year, the VLP group had 
a mean incremental cost of 878 euros and a gain of 0.020 QALYs compared with the 
EF group, rendering an ICER of 43 900 euros per QALY. At three years, the VLP 
group had a mean incremental cost of 1 082 euros and a negative incremental 
effect of -0.005 QALYs compared to the EF group, which means that VLP was 
dominated by EF. The probability that VLP was cost-effective compared to EF at 
three years, was lower than 50% independent of the willingness to pay per QALY.
CONCLUSION: Three years after distal radius fracture surgery, VLP fixation 
resulted in higher costs and a smaller effect in QALYs compared to EF. Our 
results indicate that it is uncertain if VLP is a cost-effective treatment of 
unstable distal radius fractures compared to EF.

OBJECTIVES: Overall survival in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in chronic phase 
is not significantly different by treatment with first-line tyrosine kinase 
inhibitors (TKIs), but emerging evidence reveals differences in costs and safety 
profiles. We evaluated the 1-year cost-effectiveness of TKI initiation with 
imatinib, dasatinib, or nilotinib among a hypothetical cohort of incident 
patients with CML from a US payer's perspective.
METHODS: We constructed a decision analytic model to assess quality-adjusted 
life years (QALYs), healthcare costs, net monetary benefit, and incremental 
cost-effectiveness of treatment strategies. We used published studies and data 
from the IBM Watson Health MarketScan database for model parameters. To 
calculate TKI costs, we used the 2018 Federal Supply Schedule estimates for 
generic imatinib and branded second-generation TKIs. We evaluated 
cost-effectiveness under various willingness-to-pay thresholds. We accounted for 
uncertainty with deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses.
RESULTS: In the base-case analysis, imatinib was favored over dasatinib and 
nilotinib at a lower cost per QALY gained. Imatinib remained the favored 
strategy after 1-way variations in TKI costs, TKI switching, QALYs, adverse 
event risk, and CML progression. When we assessed model uncertainty with 
prespecified parameter distributions, imatinib was cost-saving compared with 
dasatinib in 40% of 100 0000 simulations and was favored over all simulations 
compared with nilotinib. First-line treatment with second-generation TKIs was 
cost-effective in 50% of simulations at a $200 000/QALY willingness-to-pay 
threshold.
CONCLUSIONS: Generic availability of imatinib provides a more cost-effective 
treatment approach in the first year compared with other available TKIs for 
newly diagnosed patients with CML.

Evaluation of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence Diagnostics 
Assessment Program Decisions: Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio Thresholds 
and Decision-Modifying Factors.

OBJECTIVES: The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) 
Diagnostics Assessment Programme (DAP) evaluates the cost-effectiveness of 
diagnostic technologies. A decision-making process benchmarking the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) against a threshold while considering 
decision-modifying factors is common to NICE evaluations. This study 
investigated whether DAP decisions are consistent with the ICER thresholds 
described in the DAP manual, and to assess the impact of decision-modifying 
factors.
METHODS: DAP evaluations published before March 2018 were reviewed, and the 
following items were extracted: diagnostic technologies evaluated, decision 
problems assessed, Diagnostics Advisory Committee (DAC) decisions, incremental 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), incremental costs, ICERs considered to be 
most plausible by the DAC, and decision justifications.
RESULTS: All 30 evaluations were reviewed; 8 were excluded because the DAC 
concluded there was "insufficient evidence" for decision making. In the 
remaining 22 evaluations, 91 decision problems were identified for further 
analysis, of which 52, 15, and 24 received "recommended," "not recommended," and 
"not recommended-only in research" guidance, respectively. The overall 
consistency rate of the DAC decisions with the £20 000/QALY threshold was 73.6%. 
Diagnostic technologies that were not recommended, despite an ICER less than 
£20 000/QALY, were associated with a larger number of decision-modifying factors 
favoring the comparator, versus recommended diagnostic technologies with ICERs 
less than £20 000/QALY. For technologies with ICERs greater than £20 000/QALY, 
the number of decision-modifying factors was comparable for positive and 
negative recommendations.
CONCLUSIONS: Most DAP decisions were consistent with the ICER threshold. 
However, cost-effectiveness was not the only determining factor in decision 
making; recommendations also considered patient- and healthcare-centric factors 
and uncertainty.

OBJECTIVES: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a rare genetic disease with no cure. Until 
recently, treatment has targeted symptoms of the disease and not the 
disease-causing genetic defect. Ivacaftor is included in a new class of 
breakthrough drugs targeting the genetic defects of CF. We sought to estimate 
the long-term cost-effectiveness of ivacaftor from a US payer perspective.
METHODS: We developed an individual-level microsimulation model that followed a 
cohort of heterogeneous US CF patients over a lifetime. The primary outcome of 
interest was quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). We also compared unadjusted 
life years, count of acute pulmonary exacerbations, and count of lung 
transplants over a lifetime between patients treated with ivacaftor plus best 
supportive care and patients treated with best supportive care alone. We 
conducted one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses to test the impact of 
various model inputs and uncertainties.
RESULTS: We found a substantial increase in QALYs, life years, and treatment 
costs over a lifetime for patients treated with ivacaftor plus best supportive 
care versus best supportive care alone. Discounted results for ivacaftor were 
22.92 QALYs and $8 797 840 in total lifetime costs compared to 16.12 QALYs and 
$2 336 366 lifetime costs for best supportive care alone. The incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were $950 217 per QALY. Results from the 
probabilistic sensitivity analysis indicated a 0% chance that ivacaftor was 
cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of $500 000 per QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with ivacaftor plus best supportive care versus best 
supportive care alone is not cost-effective at or near commonly accepted WTP 
thresholds.

OBJECTIVES: We applied principles for conducting economic evaluations of 
factorial trials to a trial-based economic evaluation of a cluster-randomized 
2 × 2 × 2 factorial trial. We assessed the cost-effectiveness of atorvastatin, 
omega-3 fish oil, and an action-planning leaflet, alone and in combination, from 
a UK National Health Service perspective.
METHODS: The Atorvastatin in Factorial With Omega EE90 Risk Reduction in 
Diabetes (AFORRD) Trial randomized 800 patients with type 2 diabetes to 
atorvastatin, omega-3, or their respective placebos and randomized general 
practices to receive a leaflet-based action-planning intervention designed to 
improve compliance or standard care. The trial was conducted at 59 UK general 
practices. Sixteen-week outcomes for each trial participant were extrapolated 
for 70 years using the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study Outcomes Model 
v2.01. We analyzed the trial as a 2 × 2 factorial trial (ignoring interactions 
between action-planning leaflet and medication), as a 2 × 2 × 2 factorial trial 
(considering all interactions), and ignoring all interactions.
RESULTS: We observed several qualitative interactions for costs and 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) that changed treatment rankings. However, 
different approaches to analyzing the factorial design did not change the 
conclusions. There was a ≥99% chance that atorvastatin is cost-effective and 
omega-3 is not, at a £20 000/QALY threshold.
CONCLUSIONS: Atorvastatin monotherapy was the most cost-effective combination of 
the 3 trial interventions at a £20 000/QALY threshold. Omega-3 fish oil was not 
cost-effective, while there was insufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions 
about action planning. Recently-developed methods for analyzing factorial trials 
and combining parameter and sampling uncertainty were extended to estimate 
cost-effectiveness acceptability curves within a 2x2x2 factorial design with 
model-based extrapolation.

BACKGROUND: Approximately 50% of all patients undergoing esophagectomy 
experience complications. This paper estimates the costs due to complications 
after esophagectomy in a Swedish context.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The Swedish National Register for Esophageal and Gastric 
Cancer (NREV) and the Healthcare Consumption Register in Region Skåne (RSVD) 
were crossmatched for patients undergoing esophagectomy between 2010 and 2015 in 
Region Skåne, Sweden (n = 132). Multivariable linear regression analysis was 
performed on the logarithm of total healthcare cost. HRQoL was presented 
descriptively.
RESULTS: The mean total healthcare costs were 335,016 SEK (€33,502) for the 
group with no complications and 438,320 SEK (€43,832) and 808,461 SEK (€80,846) 
for minor and major complications (p < 0.001), respectively. Pneumonia 
(p < 0.001), laryngeal nerve paresis (p = 0.002) and other complications 
(p < 0.001) showed significant associations with increased healthcare cost. No 
significant difference was found in QALY-weights between the complication 
grades. Patients that underwent esophagectomy reported poorer HRQoL than the 
scores valued by the general background population.
CONCLUSION: Complications following esophagectomy incrementally increase the 
healthcare costs, where more severe complications led to higher healthcare 
costs. The severity of complications did not affect the mean QALY-weights.

OBJECTIVE: Annual gains in life expectancy in Scotland were slower in recent 
years than in the previous two decades. This analysis investigates how deaths in 
different age groups and from different causes have contributed to annual 
average change in life expectancy across two time periods: 2000-2002 to 
2012-2014 and 2012-2014 to 2015-2017.
SETTING: Scotland.
METHODS: Life expectancy at birth was calculated from death and population 
counts, disaggregated by 5 year age group and by underlying cause of death. 
Arriaga's method of life expectancy decomposition was applied to produce 
estimates of the contribution of different age groups and underlying causes to 
changes in life expectancy at birth for the two periods.
RESULTS: Annualised gains in life expectancy between 2012-2014 and 2015-2017 
were markedly smaller than in the earlier period. Almost all age groups saw 
worsening mortality trends, which deteriorated for most cause of death groups 
between 2012-2014 and 2015-2017. In particular, the previously observed 
substantial life expectancy gains due to reductions in mortality from 
circulatory causes, which most benefited those aged 55-84 years, more than 
halved. Mortality rates for those aged 30-54 years and 90+ years worsened, due 
in large part to increases in drug-related deaths, and dementia and Alzheimer's 
disease, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Future research should seek to explain the changes in mortality 
trends for all age groups and causes. More investigation is required to 
establish to what extent shortcomings in the social security system and public 
services may be contributing to the adverse trends and preventing mitigation of 
the impact of other contributing factors, such as influenza outbreaks.

Successful treatment of an open tibial fracture in a 102-year-old woman: a case 
report.

Introduction: As the average life expectancy is increasing, the number of 
patients aged >100 years who have fragility fractures will increase in the 
future. In female patients, the incidence of open fractures increases with age. 
Case Presentation: We present the case of a 102-year-old woman with open tibial 
and fibular diaphyseal fractures (Gustilo-Anderson classification type IIIb) 
treated with temporary external fixation, advancement flap, and negative 
pressure wound therapy in the first-stage surgery and treatment, and open 
reduction and internal fixation with skin grafting in the second-stage surgery. 
Open wound and bone healing were attained. Conclusion: Surgery should not be 
denied on the basis of age alone. Medical evaluation should focus on identifying 
risk factors, assessing risk in detail, optimizing status, predicting 
complications, and making the appropriate surgical plan for the patient status. 
Moreover, in the present case, meticulous postoperative management was the main 
reason for the successful surgical treatment.

los Andes, Director of CIEF, Santiago, Chile.

BACKGROUND: The concept of Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQOL) has grown in 
importance in the elderly population (PM), which is due to the increase in life 
expectancy of contemporary societies and the desire of people to live the most 
advanced years in good condition.
OBJECTIVE: To know the effect of the epidemiological dimensions, functional 
capacity, social and psychological well-being on the HRQL of a group of senior 
people from the Borough of Puente Alto intervened by the multidimensional model 
of the Integral Center for Happy Aging, CIEF, Universidad de los Andes.
RESULTS: Correlation was observed between the dimensions mentioned above, as 
well as the improvement in the predictive models of HRQL in the extent to which 
social and psychological variables are incorporated into the morbidity and 
functional capacity dimension, the latter strongly related to HRQL according to 
the scientific literature.
CONCLUSION: The study shows the relevance of incorporating measures of social 
and psychological well-being in the evaluation of HRQL, especially with a view 
to the design of multidimensional interventions that encompass individual 
content and the environment in which seniors develop.

Epidemiological impact and cost-effectiveness of universal meningitis b 
vaccination among college students prior to college entry.

Arbor, Michigan, United States of America.

OBJECTIVES: University students are at significantly higher risk of serogroup B 
meningococcal (MenB) infection, which can result in debilitating sequelae and 
excessive healthcare usage. This study aimed to elucidate the impact of 
universal pre-enrollment vaccination on MenB outbreak probability and the 
cost-effectiveness in outbreak-only scenarios.
METHODS: We developed an infectious disease transmission model to determine the 
number of outbreaks averted under universal vaccination and a Markov model to 
simulate the costs accrued and QALYs lost associated with infection. The 
analysis was done on a hypothetical population of 40,000 college students over a 
four-year time frame. We used the outputs of these two models to calculate the 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of universal MenB vaccination from a 
societal perspective.
RESULTS: We find that the vaccination strategy was estimated to reduce MenB 
incidence by 63% and outbreak frequency rate by 90%. Under base case 
assumptions, the ICER of universal vaccination was $748,129 per QALY and in 
outbreak-only scenarios, it was cost-saving.
CONCLUSIONS: Universal vaccination is not cost-effective at the current low MenB 
incidence levels and vaccine price in the U.S., but it is cost-saving if 
outbreak is imminent.

People with mental illness have substantially lower life expectancy than the 
general population, with mortality from natural causes most commonly attributed 
to cardiovascular diseases. The study aim was to identify characteristics of 
consumers who died of natural causes between 2009 and 2018 at one of Australia's 
largest publicly funded mental health services. Data were collected with a 
retrospective medical record review of 102 consumers. Mean mortality age was 
52.4 years (SD = 10.7) (with females 51.9 years [SD = 12.0], and males 
52.7 years [SD = 9.9]), which was more than 30 years lower than the Australian 
population. Cardiovascular diseases were the most frequent mortality cause 
(39%), followed by respiratory conditions (23%), cancers (20%), and all other 
causes (19%). Sixty (61%) consumers had at least three co-occurring physical 
health conditions. Seventy-five (74%) smoked tobacco. Consumers who died from 
cardiovascular diseases were less likely to attend specialist medical follow-up 
for their condition (P = 0.004), and more likely to die at home (P = 0.001). 
Consumers whose mortality age was above 55 years were more likely to have three 
co-occurring physical health conditions (P = 0.034). Consumers whose mortality 
age was below 55 years were more likely to have sub-optimal nutritional intake 
(P = 0.014) and higher body mass index (P = 0.008). There is a critical need to 
close the life expectancy gap for consumers. This requires dedicated focus on 
reducing mortality risk due to modifiable clinical characteristics which lead to 
consumer mortality. Mental health nurses play a key role in helping reduce 
consumers' mortality and morbidity risk through prevention and early 
intervention strategies.

OBJECTIVE: Endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR) has been 
preferred to open surgical repair (OSR) for the treatment of abdominal aortic 
aneurysms (AAAs) in high-risk patients. We compared the perioperative and 
long-term outcomes of EVAR for patients designated as unfit for OSR using a 
large national dataset.
METHODS: The Vascular Quality Initiative database was queried for patients who 
had undergone elective EVAR for AAAs >5 cm from 2013 to 2019. The patients were 
stratified into two cohorts according to their suitability for OSR (fit vs 
unfit). The primary outcomes included perioperative (in-hospital) major adverse 
events, perioperative mortality, and mortality at 1 and 5 years. Patient 
demographics and postoperative outcomes were analyzed to identify the predictors 
of perioperative and long-term mortality.
RESULTS: Of 16,183 EVARs, 1782 patients had been deemed unfit for OSR. The unfit 
cohort was more likely to be older and female, with a greater proportion of 
hypertension, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease, and larger aneurysm diameters. Postoperatively, 
the unfit cohort was more likely to have experienced cardiopulmonary 
complications (6.5% vs 3%; P < .001), with greater perioperative mortality (1.7% 
vs 0.6%; P < .001) and 1- and 5-year mortality (13% and 29% for the unfit vs 5% 
and 14% for the fit cohorts, respectively; P < .001). A subgroup analysis of the 
unfit cohort revealed that those deemed unfit because of a hostile abdomen had 
significantly lower 1- and 5-year mortality (6% and 20%, respectively) compared 
with those considered unfit because of cardiopulmonary compromise and frailty 
(14% and 30%, respectively; P = .451). Reintervention-free survival at 1 and 
5 years was significantly greater in the fit cohort (93% and 82%, respectively) 
compared with that for the unfit cohort (85% and 68%, respectively; P < .001). 
The designation as unfit for OSR was an independent predictor of both 
perioperative (odds ratio, 1.59; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.03-2.46; P = 
.038) and long-term mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 1.92; 95% CI, 1.69-2.17; P < 
.001). Advanced age (odds ratio, 2.91; 95% CI, 1.28-6.66; P = .011) was the 
strongest determinant of perioperative mortality, and end-stage renal disease 
(HR, 2.51; 95% CI, 1.78-3.55; P < .001) was the strongest predictor of long-term 
mortality. Statin use (HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.69-0.87; P < .001) and 
angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor use (HR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.75-0.93; 
P < .001) were protective of long-term mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite low perioperative mortality, the long-term mortality of 
those designated by operating surgeons as unfit for OSR was rather high for 
patients undergoing elective EVAR, likely owing to the competing risk of death 
from medical frailty. An unfit designation because of a hostile abdomen did not 
confer any additional risks after EVAR. Judicious estimation of the patient's 
life expectancy is essential when considering the treatment options for this 
subset of patients deemed unfit for OSR.
