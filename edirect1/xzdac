BACKGROUND: Serious mental illness, including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder 
and other psychoses, is linked with high disease burden, poor outcomes, high 
treatment costs and lower life expectancy. In the UK, most people with serious 
mental illness are treated in primary care by general practitioners, who are 
financially incentivised to meet quality targets for patients with chronic 
conditions, including serious mental illness, under the Quality and Outcomes 
Framework. The Quality and Outcomes Framework, however, omits important aspects 
of quality.
OBJECTIVES: We examined whether or not better quality of primary care for people 
with serious mental illness improved a range of outcomes.
DESIGN AND SETTING: We used administrative data from English primary care 
practices that contribute to the Clinical Practice Research Datalink GOLD 
database, linked to Hospital Episode Statistics, accident and emergency 
attendances, Office for National Statistics mortality data and community mental 
health records in the Mental Health Minimum Data Set. We used survival analysis 
to estimate whether or not selected quality indicators affect the time until 
patients experience an outcome.
PARTICIPANTS: Four cohorts of people with serious mental illness, depending on 
the outcomes examined and inclusion criteria.
INTERVENTIONS: Quality of care was measured with (1) Quality and Outcomes 
Framework indicators (care plans and annual physical reviews) and (2) 
non-Quality and Outcomes Framework indicators identified through a systematic 
review (antipsychotic polypharmacy and continuity of care provided by general 
practitioners).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Several outcomes were examined: emergency admissions for 
serious mental illness and ambulatory care sensitive conditions; all unplanned 
admissions; accident and emergency attendances; mortality; re-entry into 
specialist mental health services; and costs attributed to primary, secondary 
and community mental health care.
RESULTS: Care plans were associated with lower risk of accident and emergency 
attendance (hazard ratio 0.74, 95% confidence interval 0.69 to 0.80), serious 
mental illness admission (hazard ratio 0.67, 95% confidence interval 0.59 to 
0.75), ambulatory care sensitive condition admission (hazard ratio 0.73, 95% 
confidence interval 0.64 to 0.83), and lower overall health-care (£53), primary 
care (£9), hospital (£26) and mental health-care costs (£12). Annual reviews 
were associated with reduced risk of accident and emergency attendance (hazard 
ratio 0.80, 95% confidence interval 0.76 to 0.85), serious mental illness 
admission (hazard ratio 0.75, 95% confidence interval 0.67 to 0.84), ambulatory 
care sensitive condition admission (hazard ratio 0.76, 95% confidence interval 
0.67 to 0.87), and lower overall health-care (£34), primary care (£9) and mental 
health-care costs (£30). Higher general practitioner continuity was associated 
with lower risk of accident and emergency presentation (hazard ratio 0.89, 95% 
confidence interval 0.83 to 0.97) and ambulatory care sensitive condition 
admission (hazard ratio 0.77, 95% confidence interval 0.65 to 0.92), but not 
with serious mental illness admission. High continuity was associated with lower 
primary care costs (£3). Antipsychotic polypharmacy was not statistically 
significantly associated with the risk of unplanned admission, death or accident 
and emergency presentation. None of the quality measures was statistically 
significantly associated with risk of re-entry into specialist mental health 
care.
LIMITATIONS: There is risk of bias from unobserved factors. To mitigate this, we 
controlled for observed patient characteristics at baseline and adjusted for the 
influence of time-invariant unobserved patient differences.
CONCLUSIONS: Better performance on Quality and Outcomes Framework measures and 
continuity of care are associated with better outcomes and lower resource 
utilisation, and could generate moderate cost savings.
FUTURE WORK: Future research should examine the impact of primary care quality 
on measures that capture broader aspects of health and functioning.

Better primary care quality and continuity of care were associated with better

When the bowel meets the bladder: Optimal management of colorectal pathology 
with urological involvement.

Fistulae between the gastrointestinal and urinary systems are rare but becoming 
increasingly more common in current surgical practice. They are a heterogeneous 
group of pathological entities that are uncommon complications of both benign 
and malignant processes. As the incidence of complicated diverticular disease 
and colorectal malignancy increases, so too does the extent of fistulous 
connections between the gastrointestinal and urinary systems. These complex 
problems will be more common as a factor of an aging population with increased 
life expectancy. Diverticular disease is the most commonly encountered 
aetiology, accounting for up to 80% of cases, followed by colorectal malignancy 
in up to 20%. A high index of suspicion is required in order to make the 
diagnosis, with ever improving imaging techniques playing an important role in 
the diagnostic algorithm. Management strategies vary, with most surgeons now 
advocating for a single-stage approach to enterovesical fistulae, particularly 
in the elective setting. Concomitant bladder management techniques are also 
disputed. Traditionally, open techniques were the standard; however, increased 
experience and advances in surgical technology have contributed to refined and 
improved laparoscopic management. Unfortunately, due to the relative rarity of 
these entities, no randomised studies have been performed to ascertain the most 
appropriate management strategy. Rectourinary fistulae have dramatically 
increased in incidence with advances in the non-operative management of prostate 
cancer. With radiotherapy being a major contributing factor in the development 
of these complex fistulae, optimum surgical approach and exposure has changed 
accordingly to optimise their management. Conservative management in the form of 
diversion therapy is effective in temporising the situation and allowing for the 
diversion of faecal contents if there is associated soiling, macerated tissues 
or associated co-morbidities. One may plan for definitive surgical intervention 
at a later stage. Less contaminated cases with no fibrosis may proceed directly 
to definitive surgery if the appropriate expertise is available. An abdominal 
approach with direct repair and omentum interposition between the repaired 
tissues has been well described. In low lying fistulae, a transperineal approach 
with the patient in a prone-jack knife position provides optimum exposure and 
allows for the use of interposition muscle grafts. According to recent 
literature, it offers a high success rate in complex cases.

Interspecific competition among carnivores has been linked to differences in 
behavior, morphology, and resource use. Insights into these interactions can 
enhance understanding of local ecological processes that can have impacts on the 
recovery of endangered species, such as the ocelot (Leopardus pardalis). 
Ocelots, bobcats (Lynx rufus), and coyotes (Canis latrans) share a small 
geographic range overlap from South Texas to south-central Mexico but 
relationships among the three are poorly understood. From May 2011 to March 
2018, we conducted a camera trap study to examine co-occurrence patterns among 
ocelots, bobcats, and coyotes on the East Foundation's El Sauz Ranch in South 
Texas. We used a novel multiseason extension to multispecies occupancy models 
with ≥2 interacting species to conduct an exploratory analysis to examine 
interspecific interactions and examine the potential effects of patch-level and 
landscape-level metrics relative to the occurrence of these carnivores. We found 
strong evidence of seasonal mutual coexistence among all three species and 
observed a species-specific seasonal trend in detection. Seasonal coexistence 
patterns were also explained by increasing distance from a high-speed roadway. 
However, these results have important ecological implications for planning 
ocelot recovery in the rangelands of South Texas. This study suggests a 
coexistence among ocelots, bobcats, and coyotes under the environmental 
conditions on the El Sauz Ranch. Further research would provide a better 
understanding of the ecological mechanisms that facilitate coexistence within 
this community. As road networks in the region expand over the next few decades, 
large private working ranches will be needed to provide important habitat for 
ocelots and other carnivore species.

Poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) membranes are widely used for bioethanol 
separation. However, the network cavity size r3 of PDMS membranes is generally 
smaller than the ethanol kinetic radius (0.225 nm), which limits the transport 
of ethanol molecules and weakens the pervaporation performance. Herein, we 
proposed a particle-driven, ultrafast-cured strategy to overcome the above key 
issue: (1) Incorporating particles into PDMS for preventing polymer chains from 
packing tightly, (2) freezing particles within a PDMS layer by the ultrafast 
UV-cross-linking for improving its distribution and increasing the chain 
extension of the polymer, and (3) covalently bonding particles with PDMS to 
enhance their compatibility. Consequently, r3 was increased to 0.262 nm, and an 
extremely high loading membrane (50 wt %) with an ultrashort curing time (20 s) 
was prepared, which is difficult to be realized by the conventional thermally 
driven approach. As a result, a separation factor of 13.4 with a total flux of 
2207 g m-2 h-1 for separating ethanol from a 5 wt % aqueous solution at 60 °C 
was obtained. This strategy shows the feasibility of recovery of different 
bioalcohols and the large-scale continuous membrane preparation.

A quantum chemical model for the study of the electronic structure of compressed 
atoms lends itself to a perturbation-theoretic analysis. It is shown, both 
analytically and numerically, that the increase of the electronic energy with 
increasing compression depends on the electronic configuration, as a result of 
the variable spatial extent of the atomic orbitals involved. The different 
destabilization of the electronic states may lead to an isobaric change of the 
ground-state electronic configuration, and the same first-order model paves the 
way to a simple thermodynamical interpretation of this process.

INTRODUCTION: Preference-based instruments measuring health status express the 
value of specific health states in a single number. One method used is time 
trade-off (TTO). Health-status values are key elements in calculating 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and are pertinent for resource allocation. 
Since they are used in economic evaluations of healthcare, searching for a 
theoretical foundation of TTO in economics is justified.
AREA COVERED: This paper provides an overview of TTO, including its relation to 
economic theory, and discusses biases and distortions, compiled from recent and 
older research. Inconsistencies between TTO and random utility theory were 
detected; The TTO is confounded by time preferences and by respondents' life 
expectancies. TTO is cognitively challenging, therefore guidance during the 
interviews is needed, producing interview effects. TTO does not measure one 
thing at a time, nor are the values independent of other states that are being 
valued in the same task. That is, TTO does not exhibit theoretical measurement 
properties such as unidimensionality and the invariance principle.
EXPERT OPINION: We conclude that the TTO may be a pragmatic method of eliciting 
health state values, but the limitations in regard to measurement theory and 
practical elicitation problems makes it prone to inconsistencies and 
arbitrariness.

People living with a severe mental illness experience a life expectancy gap 
compared to the rest of the population that is largely driven by preventable 
cardiovascular diseases stemming from lifestyle factors, and the side effects of 
psychotropic medications. Mental health nurses are well positioned to help 
address the gap using lifestyle interventions. However, many nurses don't 
prioritise delivering such care, or lack the skills and confidence to implement 
these strategies. This study used a mixed method approach to determine the 
effectiveness of 2-day metabolic workshops that aimed to provide nurses with the 
skills to provide lifestyle interventions. The quantitative component compares 
pre and post measures of attitudes, confidence, knowledge and perceived barriers 
of providing metabolic care using a validated tool (M-BACK) and the qualitative 
component to elicit more details of the needs, expectations and plans of 
participants. Fifty-six nurse participants demonstrated statistically 
significant improvements in M-BACK post scores (p < 0.001), with 53 of the 56 
participants (95%) achieving improved M-BACK scores. Participants identified 
three primary barriers to delivering metabolic care, related to individual staff 
members, consumers, and system issues. Prior to the course participants stated 
they hoped to improve their knowledge, enhance their practical skills and 
provide education for others. Following completion of the course participants 
planned to implement lifestyle education and interventions for consumers, 
provide education and support to other staff and integrate metabolic health care 
into clinical reviews and planning. This study demonstrates that education on 
metabolic health care can be effective in improving the attitudes, confidence, 
and knowledge of mental health nursing in providing metabolic health care and a 
decrease in the perceived barriers to delivering that care.

BACKGROUND: Dysphagia is a well-known stroke complication characterised by 
difficulty in swallowing. It may affect the majority of stroke patients and 
increases mortality and morbidity, due to aspiration pneumonia and malnutrition. 
Food thickening may help patients to feed themselves, and its effectiveness was 
demonstrated. However, the cost-effectiveness studies are lacking. We evaluate 
the cost-utility of xanthan gum-based consistency modification therapy (Nutilis 
Clear®) in adult post-stroke patients from the public payer perspective in 
Poland.
METHODS: Routine clinical practice was used as a comparator, as no alternative 
specific treatment for dysphagia is available. To verify the robustness of the 
results against the modelling approach, we built two models: a static (a fixed 
simple-equations model, 8-week time horizon of dysphagia) and a dynamic one 
(Markov model, with a possible dysphagia resolution over a 1-year horizon). In 
both models, the treatment costs, health state utilities, and clinical events 
(i.e. aspiration, aspiration pneumonia, death) were included. Parameters were 
estimated jointly for both models, except for the duration of dysphagia and the 
risk of aspiration pneumonia (specific to the time horizon). We only assumed 
Nutilis Clear® to prevent aspirations, without affecting dysphagia duration.
RESULTS: The average cost of one quality-adjusted life year (i.e. the 
incremental cost-utility ratios, ICURs) amounted to 21,387 PLN (€1 ≈ 4.5 PLN), 
and 20,977 PLN in static and dynamic model, respectively; far below the 
cost-effectiveness threshold in Poland (147,024 PLN). The one-way, scenario, and 
probabilistic sensitivity analysis confirmed these findings.
CONCLUSIONS: Nutilis Clear® is highly cost-effective in Poland from the public 
payer perspective. Our approach can be used in other countries to study the 
cost-effectiveness of food thickening in stroke patients.

HYPOTHESIS: Heterotopic ossification (HO) is a common complication of surgically 
treated elbow fractures that can inhibit range of motion and impair quality of 
life. Although there are many treatment methods for HO, there is a lack of 
consensus as to the best option. We hypothesized that contracture release 
combined with Botox injection would lead to improved functional outcome scores 
when compared with current treatment methods.
METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted of patients who presented to a 
single surgeon with HO secondary to elbow fracture between 2005 and 2018. A 
total of 59 patients were identified who met inclusion criteria. Data were 
classified into 3 groups: contracture release (control - CR), Botox injection 
with CR (Botox + CR), and radiation therapy with CR (CR + RT). Range of motion 
measurements were obtained, including flexion, extension, pronation, and 
supination.
RESULTS: A total of 30 patients (30 of 59, 50.8%) received CR, 6 (6 of 59, 9.2%) 
were treated with CR + RT, and 23 (23 of 59, 40.0%) had CR + Botox. There was a 
significant difference between pre- and postoperative arc of motion for both CR 
+ RT (P < .01) and CR + Botox (P < .01). In addition, there was a significant 
difference in pre- and postoperative extension for patients who received 
intraoperative Botox injections (P < .05). There was no significant difference 
between pre- and postoperative motion nor extension in the CR group.
CONCLUSION: Intraoperative Botox injection with CR is an effective method in the 
treatment of post-traumatic elbow stiffness caused by HO.

INTRODUCTION: Life expectancy of people living with human immunodeficiency 
(PLHIV) has increased mainly due to the accessibility and effectiveness of 
antiretroviral therapy (ART). However, adverse effects from long-term use of 
antiretrovirals, and the physiological changes associated with aging, may 
compromise the quality of life of PLHIV, in addition to causing new demands on 
the healthcare system.
OBJECTIVES: Estimate the frequency of osteoporosis and osteopenia in patients on 
prolonged ART and to verify their associated factors.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, 
Brazil, from August 2017 to June 2018, in a sample of PLHIV (age ≥ 18 years) who 
started ART between 2001 and 2005. Data were collected through face-to-face 
interviews, physical evaluation, laboratory tests, and Dual-Energy X-Ray 
Absorptiometry Screening (DEXA). The outcome of interest was presence of bone 
alteration, defined as presence of osteopenia or osteoporosis in DEXA. The 
association between the explanatory variables and the event was assessed through 
odds ratio (OR) estimate, with 95% confidence interval (CI). Multiple logistic 
regression was performed to evaluate factors independently associated with bone 
alteration.
RESULTS: Among 92 participants, 47.8% presented bone alteration (19.6% 
osteoporosis and 28.2% osteopenia). The variables that remained in the final 
logistic regression model were age ≥ 50 years (OR: 12.53; 95% CI: 4.37-35.90) 
and current alcohol use (OR: 2.63; 95% CI: 0.94-7.37).
CONCLUSIONS: This study showed a high frequency of bone changes, especially in 
PLHIV older than 50 years. This information is useful to stimulate the screening 
and timely intervention of this comorbidity of PLHIV on prolonged use of ART in 
order to prevent or minimize complications and new demands on the healthcare 
system.

AIMS: Cannabinoids are the chemical compounds with a high affinity for 
cannabinoid receptors affecting the central nervous system through the release 
of neurotransmitters. However, the current knowledge related to the role of such 
compounds in the regulation of cellular aging is limited. This study aimed to 
investigate the effect of cannabidiol and tetrahydrocannabinol on the function 
of aged pancreatic islets.
MAIN METHODS: The expression of p53, p38, p21, p16, and Glut2 genes and 
β-galactosidase activity were measured as hallmarks of cell aging applying 
real-time PCR, ELISA, and immunocytochemistry techniques. Pdx1 protein 
expression, insulin release, and oxidative stress markers were compared between 
young and aged rat pancreatic islet cells.
KEY FINDINGS: Upon the treatment of aged pancreatic islets cells with 
cannabidiol and tetrahydrocannabinol, the expression of p53, p38, p21 and the 
activity of β-galactosidase were reduced. Cannabidiol and tetrahydrocannabinol 
increase insulin release, Pdx1, Glut2, and thiol molecules expression, while the 
oxidative stress parameters were decreased. The enhanced expression of Pdx1 and 
insulin release in aged pancreatic islet cells reflects the extension of cell 
healthy aging due to the significant reduction of ROS.
SIGNIFICANCE: This study provides evidence for the involvement of cannabidiol 
and tetrahydrocannabinol in the oxidation process of cellular aging.

BACKGROUND: We designed a collaborative care program for the integrated 
management of chronic musculoskeletal pain and depression, which frequently 
coexist in primary care patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate the 
cost-effectiveness of this program compared with care as usual.
METHODS: We performed a cost-effectiveness analysis alongside a randomized 
clinical trial. Results were monitored over a 12-month period. The primary 
outcome was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). We performed 
cost-effectiveness analyses from the perspectives of the healthcare system and 
society using an intention-to-treat approach with imputation of missing values.
RESULTS: We evaluated 328 patients (167 in the intervention group and 161 in the 
control group) with chronic musculoskeletal pain and major depression at 
baseline. From the healthcare system perspective, the mean incremental cost was 
€234 (p = .17) and the mean incremental effectiveness was 0.009 QALYs (p = .66), 
resulting in an ICER of €23,989/QALY. Costs from the societal perspective were 
€235 (p = .16), yielding an ICER of €24,102/QALY. These estimates were 
associated with a high degree of uncertainty illustrated on the 
cost-effectiveness plane.
CONCLUSIONS: Contrary to our expectations, the collaborative care program had no 
significant effects on health status, and although the additional costs of 
implementing the program compared with care as usual were not high, we were 
unable to demonstrate a favorable cost-effectiveness ratio, largely due to the 
high degree of uncertainty surrounding the estimates.

Drop attacks are the most responsive seizure type to open callosotomy, however, 
surgical complications can worsen the prognosis. Various less invasive 
techniques have been explored in an effort to minimize the risk. We present a 
patient who suffered from life-threatening traumatizing drop attacks in whom 
previous open anterior callosotomy and vagal nerve stimulation were 
unsatisfactory. Following posterior extension of the callosotomy by non-invasive 
gamma knife surgery, the rate of drop attacks declined from 30 a day to once a 
day, or every few days over a four-month period, without complications. Open 
callosotomy is an invasive and high risk treatment option for patients with drop 
attacks. The procedure has a potential for complications and neurological 
consequences that can worsen the functional capacity of a patient who already 
suffers with disability. Recently, in an attempt to decrease the invasiveness 
associated with this technique, additional technical refinements and less 
invasive procedures have been explored in a few studies. Here, we report a case 
of refractory epilepsy with life-threatening traumatizing DA, in which the 
patient was treated by radiosurgical posterior callosotomy after unsatisfactory 
open anterior callosotomy and vagal nerve stimulation.

Schizophrenia is a mental disease that results in decreased life expectancy and 
well-being by promoting obesity and sedentary lifestyles. Schizophrenia is 
treated by antipsychotic drugs. Although the second-generation antipsychotics 
(SGA), Olanzapine and Aripiprazole, are more effective in treating 
schizophrenia, they display a higher risk of metabolic side effects, mostly by 
development of diabetes and insulin resistance, weight gain, and dyslipidemia. 
Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is induced when ER homeostasis of lipid 
biosynthesis and protein folding is impaired. This leads to the activation of 
the unfolded protein response (UPR), a signaling cascade that aims to restore ER 
homeostasis or initiate cell death. Chronic conditions of ER stress in the liver 
are associated with diabetes and perturbed lipid metabolism. These metabolic 
dysfunctions resemble the pharmacological side effects of SGAs. We therefore 
investigated whether SGAs promote the UPR in human and mouse hepatocytes. We 
observed full-fledged activation of ER stress by Aripiprazole not by Olanzapine. 
This occurred at low micromolar concentrations and to variable intensities in 
different cell types, such as hepatocellular carcinoma, melanoma, and 
glioblastoma. Mechanistically, Aripiprazole caused depletion of ER calcium, 
leading to activation of inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1)and protein kinase R 
(PKR)-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK), two major transducers of the 
UPR. Cells underwent apoptosis with Aripiprazole treatment, which coincided with 
UPR induction, and this effect was reduced by adding glutathione without 
affecting UPR itself. Deletion of IRE1 from HepG2, a human liver cancer cell 
line, protected cells from Aripiprazole toxicity. Our study reveals for the 
first time a cytotoxic effect of Aripiprazole that involves the induction of ER 
stress. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The antischizophrenic drug Aripiprazole exerts 
cytotoxic properties at high concentrations. This study shows that this 
cytotoxicity is associated with the induction of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 
stress and IRE1 activation, mechanisms involved in diet-induced obesity. 
Aripiprazole induced ER stress and calcium mobilization from the ER in human and 
mouse hepatocytes. Our study highlights a new mechanism of Aripiprazole that is 
not related to its effect on dopamine signaling.

What influences Roma women attending NHS cervical screening? Knowledge, fear, 
and passive consent.

BACKGROUND: Recent immigration from Eastern Europe poses new challenges in 
engaging with women eligible to have smears. The Roma population have low 
socioeconomic status, low educational status, and a life expectancy 10 years 
lower than other EU citizens. An audit of smear uptake in four 'Deep End' 
Sheffield practices identified as having >1000 registered Roma Slovak patients, 
demonstrated smear uptakes between 53% to 40%, all of which are below the 
Sheffield CCG average of 73.5%.
AIM: To establish the barriers, facilitators and attitudes of Roma women towards 
accessing the NHS cervical screening.
METHOD: Semi-structured interviews were recorded, transcribed, and analysed 
thematically using an iterative, with independent verification of emergent 
themes. Interviews continued to data saturation. Interviews were carried out in 
the patient's home or a community centre, facilitated by a trained interpreter.
RESULTS: Sixteen women who self-identified as Roma, were interviewed. The 
overarching themes of 'language discordance', 'poor educational attainment', and 
'passivity in receiving care', influenced the women's likelihood of smear uptake 
or the need for screening. These emergent themes underpinned a longstanding 
distrust of the role of the state in relation to the health needs of the 
community.
CONCLUSION: It is vital that we develop and evaluate appropriate interventions 
to increase smear uptake in migrant and other vulnerable populations. There is a 
need for the UK to adapt screening programmes to maximise uptake within 'hard to 
reach' groups, such as the 'Roma', who are likely to be at the highest risk of 
cancer and late presentation of the disease.

The effects of hepatitis C virus (HCV), such as morbidity and mortality 
associated with cirrhosis and liver cancer, is a major public health issue in 
Australia. Highly effective treatment has recently been made available to all 
Australians living with HCV. A decision-analytic model was developed to evaluate 
the cost-effectiveness of the hepatology partnership, compared to usual care. A 
Markov model was chosen, as it is state-based and able to include recursive 
events, which accurately reflects the natural history of the chronic and 
repetitive nature of HCV. Cost-effectiveness of the new model of care is 
indicated by the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), where the mean 
change to costs associated with the new model of care is divided by the mean 
change in quality adjusted life-years (QALYs). Ten thousand iterations of the 
model were run, with the majority (73%) of ICERs representing cost-savings. In 
comparison to usual care, the intervention improves health outcomes (22.38 QALYs 
gained) and reduces costs by $42,122 per patient. When compared to usual care, a 
partnership approach to management of HCV is cost-effective and good value for 
money, even when key model parameters are changed in scenario analyses. 
Reduction in costs is driven by improved efficiency of the new model of care, 
where more patients are treated in a timely manner, away from the expensive 
tertiary setting. From an economic perspective, a reduction in hospital-based 
care is a positive outcome and represents a good investment for decision-makers 
who wish to maximise health gain per dollar spent.

OBJECTIVE To describe the human resources for health and analyze the inequality 
in its distribution in Mexico. METHODS Cross-sectional study based on the 
National Occupation and Employment Survey (ENOE in Spanish) for the fourth 
quarter of 2018 in Mexico. Graduated physicians and nurses, and 
auxiliary/technician nurses with completed studies were considered as human 
resources for health. States were grouped by degree of marginalization. 
Densities of human resources for health per 1,000 inhabitants, Index of 
Dissimilarity (DI) and Concentration Indices (CI) were estimated as measures of 
unequal distribution. RESULTS The density of human resources for health was 4.6 
per 1,000 inhabitants. We found heterogeneity among states with densities from 
2.3 to 10.5 per 1,000 inhabitants. Inequality was higher in the states with a 
very low degree of marginalization (CI = 0.4) than those with high 
marginalization (CI = 0.1), and the inequality in the distribution of physicians 
(CI = 0.5) was greater than in graduated nurses (CI = 0.3) among states. In 
addition, 17 states showed a density above the threshold of 4.5 per 1,000 
inhabitants proposed in the Global Strategy on Human Resources for Health. That 
implies a deficit of nearly 60,000 human resources for health among the 15 
states below the threshold. For all states, to reach a density equal to the 
national density of 4.6, about 12.6% of human health resources would have to be 
distributed among states that were below national density. CONCLUSIONS In 
Mexico, there is inequality in the distribution of human resources for health, 
with state differences. Government mechanisms could support the balance in the 
labor market of physicians and nurses through a human resources policy.

OBJETIVO: Describir los recursos humanos en salud y analizar la desigualdad en 
su distribución en México.
MÉTODOS: Estudio transversal basado en la Encuesta Nacional de Ocupación y 
Empleo del cuarto trimestre de 2018 en México. Se consideraron como recursos 
humanos en salud médicos y enfermeras con licenciatura, y personal de enfermería 
auxiliar/técnica con estudios concluidos. Se agrupó a los estados por grado de 
marginación y se estimó densidades de recursos humanos en salud por 1.000 
habitantes, Índices de Disimilitud e Índices de Concentración (IC) como medidas 
de desigualdad en la distribución.
RESULTADOS: La densidad de recursos humanos en salud fue de 4,6 por 1.000 
habitantes; se observó heterogeneidad entre los estados con que van 2,3 hasta 
10,5 por 1.000 habitantes. La desigualdad fue mayor en los estados con muy bajo 
grado de marginación (IC = 0,4) que en los estados de muy alto grado (IC = 0,1), 
y fue mayor la desigualdad en la distribución de los médicos (IC = 0,5) que en 
las enfermeras profesionales (IC = 0,3) entre los estados. Para que todos los 
estados tuvieran una densidad igual a la nacional de 4,6, se tendrían que 
distribuir alrededor de 12,6% de los recursos humanos en salud entre los estados 
que estuvieron por debajo de la densidad nacional. Adicionalmente, 17 estados 
tuvieron una densidad superior al umbral de 4,5 por 1.000 habitantes propuesto 
en la Estrategia Global en Recursos Humanos para la Salud. Eso implica un 
déficit de casi 60 mil recursos humanos en salud entre los 15 estados por debajo 
del umbral.
CONCLUSIONES: En México existe desigualdad en la distribución de recursos 
humanos en salud, diferenciada en los estados. Mecanismos gubernamentales a 
través de una política de recursos humanos podrían incentivar el equilibrio en 
el mercado de laboral de los médicos y enfermeras.

IMPORTANCE: Screening for breast, cervical, and colorectal cancers in the United 
States has remained below the Healthy People 2020 goals, with evidence 
indicating that persistent screening disparities still exist. The US Department 
of Health and Human Services has emphasized cross-sectoral collaboration in 
aligning social determinants of health with public health and medical services. 
Examining the economics of intervening through these novel methods in the realm 
of cancer screening can inform program planners, health care providers, 
implementers, and policy makers.
OBJECTIVE: To conduct a systematic review of economic evaluations of 
interventions leveraging social determinants of health to improve screening for 
breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer to guide implementation.
EVIDENCE REVIEW: A systematic literature search for economic evidence was 
performed in MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, Cochrane Library, Global Health, Scopus, 
Academic Search Complete, Business Source Complete, EconLit, CINAHL (Cumulative 
Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature), ERIC (Education Resources 
Information Center), and Sociological Abstracts from January 1, 2004, to 
November 25, 2019. Included studies intervened on social determinants of health 
to improve breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer screening in the United 
States and reported intervention cost, incremental cost per additional person 
screened, and/or incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). Risk of 
bias was assessed along with qualitative assessment of quality to ensure 
complete reporting of economic measures, data sources, and analytic methods. In 
addition, included studies with modeled outcomes had to define structural 
elements and sources for input parameters, distinguish between programmatic and 
literature-derived data, and assess uncertainty.
FINDINGS: Thirty unique articles with 94 706 real and 4.21 million simulated 
participants satisfied our inclusion criteria and were included in the analysis. 
The median intervention cost per participant was $123.87 (interquartile interval 
[IQI], $24.44-$313.19; 34 estimates). The median incremental cost per additional 
person screened was $250.37 (IQI, $44.67-$609.38; 17 estimates). Studies that 
modeled final economic outcomes had a median incremental cost per person of 
$122.96 (IQI, $46.96-$124.80; 5 estimates), a median incremental screening rate 
of 15% (IQI, 14%-20%; 5 estimates), and a median incremental QALY per person of 
0.04 years (IQI, 0.006-0.06 year; 5 estimates). The median incremental cost per 
QALY gained of $3120.00 (IQI, $782.59-$33 600.00; 5 estimates) was lower than 
$50 000, an established, conservative threshold of cost-effectiveness.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Interventions focused on social determinants of 
health to improve breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer screening appear to be 
cost-effective for underserved, vulnerable populations in the United States. The 
increased screening rates were associated with earlier diagnosis and treatment 
and in improved health outcomes with significant gains in QALYs. These findings 
represent the latest economic evidence to guide implementation of these 
interventions, which serve the dual purpose of enhancing health equity and 
economic efficiency.
