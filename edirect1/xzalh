METHOD: The relationship between Human Development Index (HDI)--a composite 
index measuring average achievements on three basic dimensions of human 
development (life expectancy, educational attainment and socio-economic 
status)--and elderly suicide rates was examined in a cross-national study 
utilizing secondary data from the World Health Organization and the United 
Nations.
RESULTS: There was a significant curvilinear (inverted U-shaped curve) 
relationship between elderly suicide rates in males and the HDI, fitting the 
quadratic equation y = a + bx - cx2. A similar curvilinear relationship was 
observed in females, but the significance level only approached 0.05.
CONCLUSIONS: A model with four sequential stages was proposed to explain the 
findings: (i) low elderly suicide rate--low human development society; (ii) high 
elderly suicide rate--low human development society; (iii) high elderly suicide 
rate--high human development society; and (iv) low elderly suicide rate--high 
human development society.

Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio 44195, USA. zaramoccf@yahoo.com

BACKGROUND: The diversity of the nation is one of society's greatest assets, but 
this feature is overshadowed by the disproportionate burden of disease that 
exists among America's minorities. Evidence of the disparate health status has 
been documented in low life expectancy, cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular, and 
kidney disease as well as a plethora of disorders that necessitate organ 
transplantation. Many minorities have been reluctant to register to become organ 
donors. This circumstance can be alleviated by educating the public regarding 
the necessity of organ transplantation. We have developed a "unique" 
collaborative outreach program designed to promote acceptance of organ donation 
in African-Americans (AAs). Our outreach curriculum at Bureau of Motor Vehicles 
(BMV) has resulted in increased registrations and awareness regarding the need 
and positive perceptions toward donation.
METHODS: We developed a culturally sensitive outreach program: cultural 
sensitivity indicates how culture has the ability to influence communication 
between patients and health providers. An "Outreach Promotional Contest" was 
strategically targeted toward 28 Ohio BMVs to promote and assist in an outreach 
educational program regarding organ donation/registry.
RESULTS: The consequence/results has been an increase of 3.4% in the BMV 
locations. The one BMV, with the highest increase was attended predominantly by 
AAs which moreover, won first place in the contest (6.425%; P < .05).
CONCLUSION: To increase the number of people willing to register, we believe 
that both community education regarding the need and importance, as well as 
culturally sensitive promotion of organ donation, is the best way to increase 
organ donor registries particularly among minority populations.

[Functional range of motion of the hip joint].

PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: The functional mobility of a joint represents the range of 
motion healthy individuals require to fulfill everyday life tasks. Oscillation 
angle corresponds to the entire range of motion that can be achieved by the 
joint. Wedge opening and direction are the characteristic features. We describe 
the characteristics of functional mobility of the hip joint in healthy subjects.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Hip motion was analyzed in twelve healthy subjects aged 22 
to 25 years. The three dimensional analysis used the Motion Analysis System 
(Motion Analysis Corporation, Santa Rosa, CA) at a frequency of 60 Hz. MatLab 
software was used to modelize a prosthesis and determine the oscillation angle 
and its direction as a function of implant position and head-to-neck ratio. 
After determining the hip center for each individual subject, the range of 
motion necessary to complete a task was given by the maximal angle along each 
anatomic axis needed to reach a given position in comparison with the resting 
position. The following tasks were studied: sit to stand motion, lifting weight 
from a squatting position, reaching the ground with both legs abducted in 
extension, walking, ascending and descending stairs, getting on a bicycle, 
sitting cross-legged, cutting toenails. Whether or not the task could be 
achieved with the prosthetic conformation was then determined.
RESULTS: Each task was described as a combination of motion in the three 
anatomic axes. Lifting weight from a squatting position combined flexion (110 
degrees), abduction (9 degrees) and external rotation (18 degrees) with a 
standard deviation of 9 degrees. For a given task, only a few combinations of 
femoral and acetabular orientations were compatible with completion of that 
task. Combining the motions required for several tasks diminished the possible 
orientations for prosthetic positioning.
DISCUSSION: Analyzing the motion required for these tasks shows the maximal 
range of motion involved in each direction. There was very little variability 
among healthy subjects. These results are in agreement with other values 
determined with other methods. Compensatory mechanisms used by disabled people 
to complete different tasks were not taken into consideration. The effects of 
changing either the head-to-neck ratio or implant position are discussed in 
relation to completion of a given task.

Life expectancy of the 20th century Venda: a compilation of skeletal and 
cemetery data.

South Africa.

Little information is available on the 20th century mortality rates of rural 
black South African groups, such as the Venda. The purpose of this study was to 
apply abridged life tables in order to estimate life expectancy from both 
skeletal remains and death registry information of modern South African 
communities. Comparisons were also made with prehistoric and contemporary groups 
as a means to better evaluate life expectancy for this time period. The sample 
consisted of 160 skeletons of known Venda origin and burial registry information 
for 1364 black South Africans from the Rebecca Street and Mamelodi Cemeteries in 
Pretoria, South Africa. Standard anthropological techniques were applied to 
determine sex and estimate age from the skeletal remains. The stationary and 
non-stationary life table models were used to analyse the data. A high rate of 
child mortality, low juvenile and adult mortality with a steady increase in 
mortality after the age of 30 years was observed for both the Venda and the 
cemetery samples. Throughout the 20th century, life expectancy was shown to 
increase for black South Africans. However, due to the widespread HIV 
infection/AIDS of the 21st century, infant and young adult mortality rates 
continue to rise at such a speed that the decline in mortality seen for South 
Africans in the last 50 years will most likely to be lost in the next decade due 
to this disease.

OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of macrogol 4000 compared to 
lactulose in the treatment of chronic functional constipation, from the 
perspective of the National Health Service (NHS) in the UK.
METHODS: A decision model depicting the management of chronic functional 
constipation was constructed using clinical outcomes and resource use values 
derived from patients suffering from chronic functional constipation in The 
Health Improvement Network (THIN) Database. The model was used to estimate the 
cost-effectiveness of a general practitioner (GP) prescribing macrogol 4000 
relative to lactulose to treat adults >/=18 years of age suffering from chronic 
functional constipation.
RESULTS: Forty-two per cent (95% confidence interval [CI]: 38%; 46%) of macrogol 
4000-treated patients are expected to be successfully treated within 3 months 
after starting treatment, compared to 31% (95% CI: 27%; 37%) of 
lactulose-treated patients. Patients' health status at 3 months was estimated to 
be 0.213 (95% CI: 0.200; 0.223) and 0.210 (95% CI: 0.197; 0.220) 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) in the macrogol 4000 and lactulose groups, 
respectively. The total 3-monthly NHS cost of treating patients with macrogol 
4000 or lactulose was estimated to be pound115 (95% CI: pound98; pound132) and 
pound102 (95% CI: pound86; pound119), respectively. Hence, the cost per QALY 
gained with macrogol 4000 was estimated to be pound4333.
CONCLUSION: Within the limitations of the model, treatment with macrogol 4000 
relative to lactulose is expected to increase the probability of being 
successfully treated by 35% at 3 months (p<0.0001), although this yields only a 
1% improvement in health gain. Nevertheless, macrogol 4000 affords a 
cost-effective addition to the range of laxatives available for this potentially 
resource-intensive condition, since it is clinically more effective than 
lactulose and the cost-effective strategy from the perspective of the NHS.

Box 393, Muscat 113, Oman. jallawat@yahoo.com

INTRODUCTION: The overall health status of the Omani population has evolved over 
the past 4 decades from one dominated by infectious disease to one in which 
chronic disease poses the main challenge. Along with a marked reduction in the 
incidence of infectious diseases, improvements in health care and socioeconomic 
status have resulted in sharp declines in infant and early childhood mortality 
and dramatic increases in life expectancy.
METHODS: Focusing on the time period from 1990 through 2005, we reviewed 
relevant epidemiological studies and reports and examined socioeconomic 
indicators to assess the impact of the changing disease profile on Oman's 
economy and its health care infrastructure.
RESULTS: Over the next 25 years, the elderly population of Oman will increase 
6-fold, and the urbanization rate is expected to reach 86%. Currently, more than 
75% of the disease burden in Oman is attributable to noncommunicable diseases, 
with cardiovascular disease as the leading cause of death. The distribution of 
chronic diseases and related risk factors among the general population is 
similar to that of industrialized nations: 12% of the population has diabetes, 
30% is overweight, 20% is obese, 41% has high cholesterol, and 21% has the 
metabolic syndrome.
CONCLUSION: Unless reforms are introduced to the current health care system, 
chronic diseases will constitute a major drain on Oman's human and financial 
resources, threatening the advances in health and longevity achieved over the 
past 4 decades.

[Smoking and schizophrenia: epidemiological and clinical features].

[Article in French]

Dervaux A(1), Laqueille X.

Author information:

France. a.dervaux@ch-ste-anne.fr

FREQUENCY: The prevalence of cigarette smoking is significantly higher among 
patients with schizophrenia (60-90%) than in the general population (23-30%). 
While tobacco smoking decreases in the general population (from 45% in the 
1960's to 23-30% in the 2000's), smoking in patients with schizophrenia remains 
high. Patients with schizophrenia smoke more cigarettes than control subjects. 
Patients smoke more deeply, thereby increasing their exposure to the harmful 
elements in tobacco smoke. IMPACT OF SMOKING IN SCHIZOPHRENIC PATIENTS: As in 
the general population, smoking contributes to the reduced life expectancy in 
patients with schizophrenia. Patients with schizophrenia are at increased risk 
for cardiovascular disease due to high rates of cigarette smoking. In the 
Department of Mental Health of the commonwealth of Massachusetts, cardiovascular 
disease was the factor the most strongly associated with excess mortality. 
Cardiac deaths were elevated more than six-fold. Weight gain, insulin 
resistance, metabolic syndrome and diabetes mellitus are frequent in patients 
with schizophrenia, and may worsen the risk of cardiovascular diseases. It has 
been reported that the risk for lung cancer in patients with schizophrenia is 
lower than that of the general population, despite increased smoking. However, 
in a study conducted in Finland, a slightly increased cancer risk was found in 
patients with schizophrenia. Half of the excess cases were attributable to lung 
cancer. IMPROVEMENT OF COGNITIVE DEFICITS: Patients with schizophrenia may use 
nicotine to reduce cognitive deficits and negative symptoms or neuroleptic side 
effects. Smoking may transiently alleviate negative symptoms in schizophrenic 
patients by increasing dopaminergic and glutamatergic neurotransmission in the 
prefrontal cortex. In patients with schizophrenia, nicotine improves some 
cognitive deficits: (1) sensory gating deficits and abnormalities in smooth 
pursuit eye movements associated with schizophrenia are transiently normalized 
with the administration of nicotine ; (2) high-dose nicotine transiently 
normalizes the abnormality in P50 inhibition in patients with schizophrenia and 
in their relatives; (3) in tasks that tax working memory and selective 
attention, nicotine may improve performance in schizophrenia patients by 
enhancing activation of and functional connectivity between brain regions that 
mediate task performance (Jacobsen et al. 2004; Paktar et al.2002); (4) 
cigarette smoking may selectively enhance visuospatial working memory and 
attentional deficits in smokers with schizophrenia. However, Harris et al., 
found that nicotine affects only the attention without effects of nicotine on 
learning, memory or visuospatial/constructional abilities. In addition, smoking 
could facilitate disinhibition in schizophrenic patients.

The weaker sex? Exploring lay understandings of gender differences in life 
expectancy: a qualitative study.

Emslie C(1), Hunt K.

Despite increasing interest in gender and health, 'lay' perceptions of gender 
differences in mortality have been neglected. Drawing on semi-structured 
interview data from 45 men and women in two age cohorts (born in the early 1950s 
and 1970s) in the UK, we investigated lay explanations for women's longer life 
expectancy. Our data suggest that respondents were aware of women's increased 
longevity, but found this difficult to explain. While many accounts were 
multifactorial, socio-cultural explanations were more common, more detailed and 
less tentative than biological explanations. Different socio-cultural 
explanations (i.e. gendered social roles, 'macho' constraints on men and gender 
differences in health-related behaviours) were linked by the perception that 
life expectancy would converge as men and women's lives became more similar. 
Health behaviours such as going to the doctor or drinking alcohol were often 
located within wider structural contexts. Female respondents were more likely to 
focus on women's reproductive and caring roles, while male respondents were more 
likely to focus on how men were disadvantaged by their 'provider' role. We 
locate these narratives within academic debates about conceptualising gender: 
e.g. 'gender as structure' versus 'gender as performance', 'gender as 
difference' versus 'gender as diversity'.

Health, University of Technology, Sydney, NSW, Australia.

AIM(S): To examine nursing leadership in contemporary health care and its 
potential contribution to health service organization and management.
BACKGROUND: As the nursing profession repositions itself as an equal partner in 
health care beside medicine and management, its enhanced nursing standards and 
clinical knowledge are not leading to a commensurate extension of nursing's 
power and authority in the organization.
METHOD(S): An ethnographic study of an ICU in Sydney, Australia, comprising: 
interviews with unit nursing managers (4); focus groups (3) with less 
experienced, intermediate and experienced nurses (29 in total); and interviews 
with senior nurse manager (1).
RESULTS: Inter- and intra-professional barriers in the workplace, fragmentation 
of multidisciplinary clinical systems that collectively deliver care, and 
clinical and administrative disconnection in resolving organizational problems, 
prevented nurses articulating a model of intensive and end-of-life care.
CONCLUSION(S): Professional advocacy skills are needed to overcome barriers and 
to articulate and operationalize new nursing knowledge and standards if nurses 
are to enact and embed a leadership role.
IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT: The profession will need to move beyond a 
reliance on professional clinical models to become skilled multidisciplinary 
team members and professional advocates for nurses to take their place as equal 
partners in health care.

Author information:

Oxford OX3 9DU, UK. drjgriffiths@yahoo.co.uk

BACKGROUND: Extended follow-up of survivors of ICU treatment has shown many 
patients suffer long-term physical and psychological consequences that affect 
their health-related quality of life. The current lack of rigorous longitudinal 
studies means that the true prevalence of these physical and psychological 
problems remains undetermined.
METHODS/DESIGN: The ICON (Intensive Care Outcome Network) study is a 
multi-centre, longitudinal study of survivors of critical illness. Patients will 
be recruited prior to hospital discharge from 20-30 ICUs in the UK and will be 
assessed at 3, 6, and 12 months following ICU discharge for health-related 
quality of life as measured by the Short Form-36 (SF-36) and the EuroQoL 
(EQ-5D); anxiety and depression as measured by the Hospital Anxiety and 
Depression Scale (HADS); and post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms as 
measured by the PTSD Civilian Checklist (PCL-C). Postal questionnaires will be 
used.
DISCUSSION: The ICON study will create a valuable UK database detailing the 
prevalence of physical and psychological morbidity experienced by patients as 
they recover from critical illness. Knowledge of the prevalence of physical and 
psychological morbidity in ICU survivors is important because research to 
generate models of causality, prognosis and treatment effects is dependent on 
accurate determination of prevalence. The results will also inform economic 
modelling of the long-term burden of critical illness.

Comparison of delayed female mating on reproductive biology of codling moth and 
obliquebanded leafroller.

Delay of mating was examined as a possible mechanism for population decreases 
associated with mating disruption for codling moth, Cydia pomonella L., and 
obliquebanded leafroller, Choristoneura rosaceana (Harris) (Lepidoptera: 
Tortricidae). We examined the effect of delaying female mating 0, 2, 4, or 6 d 
while holding male age constant on life table parameters of both species. We 
found that increasing delays in mating were accompanied by two responses: (1) an 
increase in the percentage of sterile pairs and (2) a reduction in net 
reproductive rate and population growth unrelated to sterility. On a percentage 
basis, obliquebanded leafroller population growth was more strongly affected 
than codling moth. However, the net fertility rate of obliquebanded leafroller 
was nearly eight-fold higher than that of codling moth, so that obliquebanded 
leafroller females that experienced a 4-d delay in mating had nearly the same 
reproductive rate as codling moth females that experienced no delay. Leslie 
matrix simulations using life tables with field-based adult longevity estimates 
showed that codling moth females experiencing >2-d delay in mating resulted in 
decreases in population density or extinction within two generations. In 
contrast, obliquebanded leafroller females delayed <6 d showed rapid population 
growth that decreased as female age at mating increased; only the 6-d delay 
treatment resulted in decreased population levels. Our results indicate that 
obliquebanded leafroller females must on average experience a much longer delay 
in mating to significantly reduce population growth compared with codling moth 
females, suggesting that delay of mating likely plays a greater role in codling 
moth mating disruption than for obliquebanded leafroller.

OBJECTIVES: Cost-utility analysis of screening for anal cancer in high-risk 
groups from a UK perspective.
METHODS: Criteria for the assessment of screening programmes were combined in a 
Markov model representing the natural history of anal cancer and HIV infection 
in the UK population of men who have sex with men (MSM). Alternative screening 
programmes were overlaid on the natural history model to evaluate their impact. 
The model was populated using data derived from a systematic review of the 
literature, and calibrated probabilistically to represent joint uncertainty in 
the input parameters.
RESULTS: Reference case results showed screening is unlikely to be 
cost-effective. Sensitivity analyses identified two important parameters: 
regression from low-grade anal intra-epithelial neoplasia (AIN) and utility 
effects. Increased AIN regression rates resulted in a minimum incremental cost 
per QALY gained of 39,405 pounds, whereas a best case scenario reduced the ratio 
to 20,996 pounds.
CONCLUSIONS: There are major areas of uncertainty. New analyses of existing 
primary data, undertaken specifically to inform regression rates may usefully 
update key parameters at little additional cost. If these analyses increase the 
likelihood that screening is cost-effective, further studies of the utility 
effects of treatment for high-grade AIN, and potential screening attendance 
rates may be justified.

Better life expectancy in women with BRCA2 compared with BRCA1 mutations is 
attributable to lower frequency and later onset of ovarian cancer.

Hospital, Manchester, United Kingdom. Louise.Byrd@cmmc.nhs.uk

PURPOSE: No formal assessment of life expectancy in women with BRCA1 and BRCA2 
mutations in these genes has been reported previously. We have evaluated life 
expectancy using actuarial analysis and assessed the effect of breast and 
ovarian cancers on premature death in >1,000 BRCA1/2 carriers.
METHODS: Families with pathogenic mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 have been 
ascertained in a 10-million population region of United Kingdom since 1996. 
Mutation carriers and their first-degree relatives were used in an analysis of 
breast and ovarian cancer incidence and mortality as well as to derive and 
compare an actuarial assessment of life expectancy.
RESULTS: Six hundred twelve BRCA1 and 482 BRCA2 female mutation carriers were 
identified from 482 families. Life expectancy was significantly reduced for 
BRCA1 carriers compared with BRCA2 (P = 0.0002). This effect was attributable to 
an increased death rate from ovarian cancer (P = 0.04). Kaplan-Meier analysis 
revealed a better long-term survival from early-stage ovarian cancer in BRCA2 
carriers but no significant differences in deaths from breast cancer or from 
women presenting with late-stage ovarian cancer. There was no other major 
contributing cause to death other than breast/ovarian cancer in BRCA1/2 female 
carriers.
CONCLUSION: Interventions to reduce ovarian cancer incidence are likely to have

BACKGROUND: Although HIV infection is more prevalent in people younger than age 
45 years, a substantial number of infections occur in older persons. Recent 
guidelines recommend HIV screening in patients age 13 to 64 years. The 
cost-effectiveness of HIV screening in patients age 55 to 75 years is uncertain.
OBJECTIVE: To examine the costs and benefits of HIV screening in patients age 55 
to 75 years.
DESIGN: Markov model.
DATA SOURCES: Derived from the literature.
TARGET POPULATION: Patients age 55 to 75 years with unknown HIV status.
TIME HORIZON: Lifetime.
PERSPECTIVE: Societal.
INTERVENTION: HIV screening program for patients age 55 to 75 years compared 
with current practice.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Life-years, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), costs, and 
incremental cost-effectiveness.
RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: For a 65-year-old patient, HIV screening using 
traditional counseling costs $55,440 per QALY compared with current practice 
when the prevalence of HIV was 0.5% and the patient did not have a sexual 
partner at risk. In sexually active patients, the incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio was $30,020 per QALY. At a prevalence of 0.1%, HIV screening cost less 
than $60,000 per QALY for patients younger than age 75 years with a partner at 
risk if less costly streamlined counseling is used.
RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: Cost-effectiveness of HIV screening depended on 
HIV prevalence, age of the patient, counseling costs, and whether the patient 
was sexually active. Sensitivity analyses with other variables did not change 
the results substantially.
LIMITATIONS: The effects of age on the toxicity and efficacy of highly active 
antiretroviral therapy and death from AIDS were uncertain. Sensitivity analyses 
exploring these variables did not qualitatively affect the results.
CONCLUSION: If the tested population has an HIV prevalence of 0.1% or greater, 
HIV screening in persons from age 55 to 75 years reaches conventional levels of 
cost-effectiveness when counseling is streamlined and if the screened patient 
has a partner at risk. Screening patients with advanced age for HIV is 
economically attractive in many circumstances.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is the most common neurodegenerative disease 
of the motor system. Bulbar symptoms such as dysphagia and dysarthria are 
frequent features of ALS and can result in reductions in life expectancy and 
quality of life. These dysfunctions are assessed by clinical examination and by 
use of instrumented methods such as fiberendoscopic evaluation of swallowing and 
videofluoroscopy. Laryngospasm, another well-known complication of ALS, commonly 
comes to light during intubation and extubation procedures in patients 
undergoing surgery. Laryngeal and pharyngeal complications are treated by use of 
an array of measures, including body positioning, compensatory techniques, voice 
and breathing exercises, communication devices, dietary modifications, various 
safety strategies, and neuropsychological assistance. Meticulous monitoring of 
clinical symptoms and close cooperation within a multidisciplinary team 
(physicians, speech and language therapists, occupational therapists, 
dietitians, caregivers, the patients and their relatives) are vital.

Theoretical estimation of maximum human lifespan.

Weon BM(1), Je JH.

Republic of Korea.

The existence of maximum human lifespan remains a puzzle in aging research. 
Maximum human lifespan is believed to be around 125 years, whereas current 
demographic trends seem to show no limitation. To reconcile this contrast, the 
estimation of maximum human lifespan requires an adequate mathematical model. 
However, sparse data of available old-age mortality pattern make the estimation 
impossible. Here we suggest an extended Weibull model for the estimation using a 
proper mathematical method based on survival probability pattern. We find a 
tendency that survival probability is maximized in modern human survival curves. 
Based on such tendency, we develop an estimation method for maximum human 
lifespan and indeed obtain about 126 years from periodic life tables for Swedish 
female between 1950 and 2005. Despite uncertainty from available mortality data, 
our approach may offer quantitative biodemographic opportunities linking aging 
and survival kinetics.

Priority setting in practice: what is the best way to compare costs and 
benefits?

Prioritizing candidates for health-care expenditure using cost per 
Quality-Adjusted Life Year (QALY) is a helpful but insufficient means of ranking 
alternative uses for scarce health-care funds at the local level. This is 
because QALYs do not by themselves capture all criteria decision makers need to 
take into account. Other criteria such as reducing inequalities, meeting 
national and local priorities and public acceptability also feature in the 
decision maker's utility function. Programme budgeting and marginal analysis 
(PBMA) is an established framework for systematic priority setting in which a 
'weighted benefit score' for each option is calculated based on all relevant 
decision-making criteria. Ranking options as a ratio of cost to benefit is 
desirable and necessary to ensure efficiency. In this paper we review a number 
of approaches to scoring costs and benefits of options in a PBMA context. 
Several approaches rank by benefit score alone, rather than efficiency (cost per 
unit of benefit). Of those that do rank by efficiency, we discuss the benefits 
and drawbacks. The optimal approach is far from clear, with each technique 
having its own strengths and weaknesses. A deliberative approach using summaries 
of costs and benefits of options as a basis for discussion may be preferable.

Sir2 mediates apoptosis through JNK-dependent pathways in Drosophila.

Griswold AJ(1), Chang KT, Runko AP, Knight MA, Min KT.

Increased expression of the histone deacetylase sir2 has been reported to extend 
the life span of diverse organisms including yeast, Caenorhabditis elegans, and 
Drosophila melanogaster. A small molecule activator of Sir2, resveratrol, has 
also been suggested to extend the fitness and survival of these simple model 
organisms as well as mice fed high calorie diets. However, other studies in 
yeast have shown that Sir2 itself may prevent life extension, and high 
expression levels of Sir2 can be toxic to yeast and mouse cells. This 
conflicting evidence highlights the importance of understanding the mechanisms 
by which Sir2 expression or activation affects survival of organisms. To 
investigate the downstream signaling pathways affected by Sir2 in Drosophila, we 
generated transgenic flies expressing sir2. Here, we show that overexpression of 
sir2 in Drosophila promotes caspase-dependent but p53-independent apoptosis that 
is mediated by the JNK and FOXO signaling pathways. Furthermore, we find that a 
loss-of-function sir2 mutant partially prevents apoptosis induced by UV 
irradiation in the eye. Together, these results suggest that Sir2 normally 
participates in the regulation of cell survival and death in Drosophila.

Predicting death in children.

Brook L(1), Hain R.

Author information:

Rarely do paediatric palliative medicine physicians have to break the news of a 
diagnosis of a life-limiting condition. It is much commoner for us to be faced 
with the question: "how long?". This cannot be answered with certainty, and yet 
a great deal may depend on it. While palliative care should ideally be available 
from diagnosis, the need for "active" practical palliative care intervention 
will fluctuate during the course of a child's illness, often over months or 
years, sometimes decades. Typically, there will be several periods during which 
death seems likely before the final terminal episode, particularly among 
children with non-malignant life-limiting condition. Optimal management of all 
episodes depends on anticipating the child's needs, which in turn depends on 
recognising that such an episode has begun. Providing adequate palliative care 
critically depends on making a diagnosis of dying. In this article, we will 
consider why it is important to make a diagnosis of dying, briefly review some 
of the helpful tools available, and examine some of the evidence from published 
literature in children and adults.

The cost of Child Health Days: a case study of Ethiopia's Enhanced Outreach 
Strategy (EOS).

Fiedler JL(1), Chuko T.

(1)Social Sectors Development Strategies, Boston, MA, USA. jfiedler@ssds.net

Child Health Days (CHDs) are twice-annual campaign-style events designed to 
increase the coverage of vitamin A and one or more other child health services. 
Although more than two dozen countries have had a CHD, little has been published 
about them. This paper presents an activity-based costing study of Ethiopia's 
version of CHDs, the Enhanced Outreach Strategy (EOS). The December 2006 round 
reached more than 10 million beneficiaries at an average cost per beneficiary of 
US$0.56. When measles is added, the cost of the package doubles. Given the way 
the distribution day delivery system and the service package are structured, 
there are economies of scope. Because most of the costs are determined by the 
number of delivery sites and are independent of the number of beneficiaries, 
other things equal, increasing the beneficiaries would reduce the average cost 
per beneficiary. Taking into account only the mortality impact of vitamin A, EOS 
saved 20,200 lives and averted 230,000 DALYs of children 6-59 months. The 
average cost per life saved was US$228 and the cost per DALY averted was 
equivalent to 6% of per capita GDP (US$9), making the EOS cost-effective, 
according to WHO criteria. While CHDs are generally construed as a temporary 
strategy for improving coverage of supply-constrained systems, inadequate 
attention has been paid to demand-side considerations that suggest CHDs have an 
important role to play in changing care-seeking behaviour, in increasing 
community organization and participation, and in promoting district autonomy and 
capacity. Recognition of these effects suggests the need for decisions about 
where and when to introduce, and when to end, a CHD to take into account more 
than 'just' health sector considerations: they are more broadly about community 
development. UNICEF played a key role in initiating the EOS and finances 68% of 
costs, raising concern about the programme's long-term sustainability.

expansin by pretreatment with fungal pectinases and EGTA in vitro.

Mature plant cell walls lose their ability to expand and become unresponsive to 
expansin. This phenomenon is believed to be due to cross-linking of 
hemicellulose, pectin, or phenolic groups in the wall. By screening various 
hydrolytic enzymes, we found that pretreatment of nongrowing, heat-inactivated, 
basal cucumber (Cucumis sativus) hypocotyls with pectin lyase (Pel1) from 
Aspergillus japonicus could restore reconstituted exogenous expansin-induced 
extension in mature cell walls in vitro. Recombinant pectate lyase A (PelA) and 
polygalacturonase (PG) from Aspergillus spp. exhibited similar capacity to Pel1. 
Pel1, PelA, and PG also enhanced the reconstituted expansin-induced extension of 
the apical (elongating) segments of cucumber hypocotyls. However, the effective 
concentrations of PelA and PG for enhancing the reconstituted expansin-induced 
extension were greater in the apical segments than in the basal segments, 
whereas Pel1 behaved in the opposite manner. These data are consistent with 
distribution of more methyl-esterified pectin in cell walls of the apical 
segments and less esterified pectin in the basal segments. Associated with the 
degree of esterification of pectin, more calcium was found in cell walls of 
basal segments compared to apical segments. Pretreatment of the calcium chelator 
EGTA could also restore mature cell walls' susceptibility to expansin by 
removing calcium from mature cell walls. Because recombinant pectinases do not 
hydrolyze other wall polysaccharides, and endoglucanase, xylanase, and protease 
cannot restore the mature wall's extensibility, we can conclude that the pectin 
network, especially calcium-pectate bridges, may be the primary factor that 
determines cucumber hypocotyl mature cell walls' unresponsiveness to expansin.

[Surgical therapy for malignant pleural effusions].

[Article in German]

Symptomatic malignant pleural effusions are common in patients with neoplastic 
disease (50 %). Frequently, they are a sign of advanced disease. These patients 
have an average life expectancy of 3 to 12 months. The therapeutic aim should be 
an efficient treatment with a short hospital stay. Chest tube drainage gives 
rapid relief of symptoms and information on the expansion of the lungs. When 
complete expansion of the lung is possible, VATS insufflation of talc is 
recommended. Talc is the most effective sclerosant (80 %) followed by 
doxycycline (70 %). VATS pleurodesis has a higher complication rate but is more 
effective than a talc slurry instilled through the chest tube. When the lung is 
trapped, long-term indwelling pleural drainage and pleuroperitoneal shunts are 
alternatives.

Cost-effectiveness analyses of natalizumab (Tysabri) compared with other 
disease-modifying therapies for people with highly active relapsing-remitting 
multiple sclerosis in the UK.

BACKGROUND: Natalizumab (Tysabri) is a new disease-modifying therapy that has 
been shown to be clinically effective in patients with relapsing-remitting 
multiple sclerosis (RRMS) and has been licensed for use in patients with highly 
active RRMS (HARRMS). These patients are those who experience higher relapse 
rates and faster disability progression than the general RRMS population.
OBJECTIVES: To estimate the cost effectiveness of natalizumab compared with 
interferon-beta, glatiramer acetate and best supportive care from various UK 
cost perspectives.
METHODS: A 30-year Markov model was developed, based on previously published 
models for multiple sclerosis, to estimate transition between disability states 
and the probability of relapse within disability states. The model was 
parameterized with data from the UK Multiple Sclerosis (MS) Survey 2005 and data 
from the AFFIRM study, a 2-year multicentre, randomized, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled trial of natalizumab in RRMS patients. Additional data were 
sourced from the literature. A UK societal cost perspective was used in the base 
case, with additional cost perspectives considered in the sensitivity analysis. 
The baseline characteristics for the patient group were taken from the patient 
population in the AFFIRM study (mean age 36 years, mean time since diagnosis 5 
years and a mean Kurtzke Extended Disability Status Scale [EDSS] score of 2.5). 
The model and its parameterization were designed and developed to support a 
reimbursement application for natalizumab submitted to the UK National Institute 
for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE). Efficacies for natalizumab and 
glatiramer acetate were taken from clinical trial data, and for interferon-beta 
from a meta-analysis of clinical trial data. Disutilities from adverse events 
for each comparator were also included in the model. Outcomes and costs were 
discounted at 3.5% per anum. Costs for interferon-beta and glatiramer acetate 
were based on published prices (year 2006 values) under the UK Risk Sharing 
Scheme, and for natalizumab the UK NHS list price was used. Diagnostic, 
administration and adverse event costs were also included. The incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated for the base case, and a 
probabilistic sensitivity analysis was performed to assess the probability of 
cost effectiveness at different willingness-to-pay thresholds.
RESULTS: The ICER for natalizumab compared with interferon-beta was 2300 pound 
per QALY. Compared with glatiramer acetate, it was 2000 pound per QALY, and 
compared with best supportive care it was 8200 pound per QALY. From a health and 
social care cost perspective, the ICERs were 18,700 pound, 20,400 pound and 
25,500 per QALY, respectively. At a willingness-to-pay threshold of 30,000 pound 
per QALY, the probability of natalizumab being cost effective against any 
comparator from a societal perspective was >89%.
CONCLUSION: If UK society is willing to pay more than 8200 pound per QALY, or 
Health and Social Services are willing to pay more than 26,000 pound per QALY, 
this analysis suggests that natalizumab is likely to be a cost-effective 
treatment for all patients with HARRMS.

INTRODUCTION: The Sexual Experience Questionnaire (SEX-Q) enables quick and easy 
assessment of functional, emotional, and satisfaction-related aspects of the 
sexual experience in men with erectile dysfunction (ED).
AIM: To assess correlations between improvement on the SEX-Q and outcomes on 
other validated questionnaires. METHODS. Men with ED (score < or =25 on the 
Erectile Function domain of the International Index of Erectile Function [IIEF]) 
who had used less than or equal to six doses of any phosphodiesterase 5 
inhibitor (none within 6 months) were randomized to 10 weeks of double-blind, 
placebo-controlled (DBPC) flexible-dose sildenafil citrate (50 or 100 mg, as 
needed), followed by 6 weeks of open-label (OL) sildenafil.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: SEX-Q, IIEF, Quality of Erection Questionnaire (QEQ), 
Self-Esteem and Relationship (SEAR) Questionnaire, Erection Hardness Score 
(EHS), successful intercourse attempts (SIAs), Erectile Dysfunction Inventory of 
Treatment Satisfaction (EDITS), and global efficacy questions (GEQs).
RESULTS: Compared with the placebo group (N = 105), the sildenafil group (N =
