OBJECTIVE: Using a multivariate extension of the Baron and Kenny (1986) 
mediation framework, we examined the simultaneous effect of variables 
hypothesized to mediate the relationship between a motivationally tailored 
physical activity intervention, and 6-month physical activity behavior in 239 
healthy, underactive adults (M age = 47.5; 82% women).
DESIGN: Participants were randomly assigned to (a) print-based feedback; (b) 
telephone-based feedback; or (c) contact control.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Psychosocial variables, including self-efficacy, 
decisional balance, and processes of change.
RESULTS: All mediation criteria were satisfied for both intervention arms. A 
moderate indirect effect of print (0.39, 95% CI = 0.21, 0.57) was found due to 
increases in behavioral processes (0.54, 95% CI = 0.29, 0.80) being attenuated 
by decreases due to cognitive processes (-0.17, 95%CI = 0.31,-.03). A moderate 
indirect effect was observed for telephone (0.47, 95% CI = 0.28, 0.66), with 
increases due to behavioral processes (0.61, 95% CI = 0.34, 0.87) attenuated by 
decreases due to cognitive processes (0.15, 95% CI = -0.27, -0.02); 
self-efficacy and decisional balance mediational paths did not attain 
statistical significance.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight the importance of studies that deconstruct 
the theoretical components of interventions to determine which combination 
produces the greatest behavior changes at the lowest cost.

Using a path integral technique, we show exactly that for a semiflexible 
biopolymer in constant extension ensemble, no matter how long the polymer and 
how large the external force, the effects of short-range correlations in the 
sequence-dependent spontaneous curvatures and torsions can be incorporated into 
a model with well-defined mean spontaneous curvature and torsion as well as a 
renormalized persistence length. Moreover, for a long biopolymer with large mean 
persistence length, the sequence-dependent persistence lengths can be replaced 
by their mean. However, for a short biopolymer or for a biopolymer with small 
persistence lengths, inhomogeneity in persistence lengths tends to make physical 
observables very sensitive to details and therefore less predictable.

Estrogens are considered neurotrophic for dopamine neurons. Parkinson's disease 
is more frequent in males than in females, and more prevalent in females with 
short reproductive life. Estrogens are neuroprotective against neurotoxic agents 
for dopamine neurons in vivo and in vitro. Here, we have investigated the role 
of estrogens in wild-type (WT) and parkin null mice (PK-/-). WT mice present 
sexual dimorphisms in neuroprotective mechanisms (Bcl-2/Bax, chaperones, and 
GSH), but some of these inter-sex differences disappear in PK-/-. Tyrosine 
hydroxylase (TH) protein and TH+ cells decreased earlier and more severely in 
female than in male PK-/- mice. Neuronal cultures from midbrain of WT and PK-/- 
mice were treated with estradiol from 10 min to 48 h. Short-term treatments 
activated the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway of WT and PK-/- neurons 
and the phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase/AKT/glycogen synthase kinase-3 pathway of 
WT but not of PK-/- cultures. Long-term treatments with estradiol increased the 
number of TH+ neurons, the TH expression, and the extension of neurites, and 
decreased the level of apoptosis, the expression of glial fibrillary acidic 
protein, and the number of microglial cells in WT but not in PK-/- cultures. The 
levels of estrogen receptor-alpha were elevated in midbrain cultures and in the 
striatum of adult PK-/- male mice, suggesting that suppression of parkin changes 
the estrogen receptor-alpha turnover. From our data, it appears that parkin 
participates in the cellular estrogen response which could be of interest in the 
management of parkin-related Parkinson's disease patients.

This paper performs new tests of the QALY model when health varies over time. 
Our tests do not involve confounding assumptions and are robust to violations of 
expected utility. The results support the use of QALYs at the aggregate level, 
i.e. in economic evaluations of health care. At the individual level, there is 
less support for QALYs. The individual data are, however, largely consistent 
with a more general QALY-type model that remains tractable for applications.

Long-term indwelling pleural catheter (PleurX) for malignant pleural effusion 
unsuitable for talc pleurodesis.

AIMS: Talc pleurodesis using talc slurry via chest tube is a primary option in 
malignant pleural effusion, since life expectancy is short and surgical 
decortication is hazardous. Incomplete lung expansion after fluid evacuation, 
and/or excessive fluid secretion predicts failure of pleurodesis. A 
mini-invasive alternative was investigated.
METHODS: Between March 2004 and September 2005, 51 consecutive patients with 
malignant pleural effusion, and clinically considered unsuitable for talc 
pleurodesis, received an indwelling pleural catheter (Denver PleurX). In 47, 
implantation was done bedside using local anaesthesia. There were 24 men and 27 
women, median age 63 (range 36-85) years, receiving 39 right side, 10 left side, 
and 2 bilateral catheters. There were 19 non-small cell lung cancer cases, 7 
mesothelioma, and 25 with other malignancy. Chemotherapy was being given to 18 
patients and was not interrupted.
RESULTS: Discharge to home was possible in 71% (36 of 71 patients) on the 
following day. At 2 years follow-up in September 2007, one patient was alive. 
Mean survival was 3 months (range 5 days to 37+months) for all patients, with 
best median survivals of 5.5-6 months in breast and ovarian cancer. Catheter was 
removed or replaced in 15% (8 of 51 patients) due to infection, air leak, or 
blockage. One patient requested decortication for excessive fluid secretion. 
None required surgery or died due to catheter-related complications. Pleural 
fusion with subsequent catheter removal was achieved in 21% (11 of 51 patients).
CONCLUSIONS: An indwelling pleural catheter is a safe alternative for patients 
with malignant pleural effusion unsuitable for talc pleurodesis. In some, 
pleural fusion may be achieved.

Years of life lost because of gunshot injury to the brain and spinal cord.

Richmond TS(1), Lemaire J.

Author information:
(1)School of Nursing, Firearm and Injury Center at Penn, University of 
Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, USA.

OBJECTIVE: A recent study (Lemaire) estimated the life expectancy loss 
attributable to gun deaths at 103.6 days for the overall U.S. population: 150.7 
days for white males and 361.5 days for black males. This study estimates the 
life expectancy loss attributable to the premature death of individuals who 
initially survived gun-related traumatic brain injury (TBI) and spinal cord 
injury (SCI) in the United States.
DESIGN: Interpersonal TBI data were drawn from a surveillance system, and 
self-inflicted TBI data were obtained from the Web-based Injury Statistics and 
Reporting System. SCI data were obtained from a national database. Multiple 
decrement analysis was used to calculate the days of life lost to gunshot wounds 
to the brain and spinal cord, by race and gender, in the United States.
RESULTS: On average, across age, gender, and race, life expectancy in the United 
States is reduced by 3.1 days because of the shorter lifespan for individuals 
who survive an initial gunshot wound to the brain or spinal cord. Black males 
bear a disproportionate burden, losing 9.5 days, whereas white males lose 4.6 
days. Black and white females lose 1.5 and 1.0 days, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: We add these findings to the Lemaire study, resulting in a total of 
106.7 days of life expectancy loss from gunshot wounds for the U.S. population, 
with 371.0 days of life lost for black males.

Human papilloma virus DNA testing may improve the cost effectiveness of cervical 
cancer screening programs. However, the circumstances to get this improvement 
are not the same between countries. The objective of this paper is to evaluate 
the cost effectiveness of introducing human papilloma virus testing in the 
current screening practice both in developed and developing countries. We 
conducted a review of published articles since January 2000 until December 2006 
related to the cost effectiveness of introducing human papilloma virus testing 
in cervical cancer screening programs. A total of 17 original researches and six 
reviews were analyzed. Human papilloma virus testing is cost effective in 
developed countries only if it is a complementary test to Pap test and used to 
determine the management of women with atypical squamus cells of undetermined 
significance, the interval among tests is increased more than two years and it 
is performed in women over 30 years. On the other hand, developing countries 
should establish first organized screening programs and guarantee full coverage 
and access to diagnosis and treatment.

Surgical treatment for cancer of the oral cavity can result in dramatic 
aesthetic and functional sequelae partially avoidable by reconstructive 
techniques. Many studies concerning quality of life have been carried out in 
order to retrospectively assess outcomes after such major oncological 
procedures. Aim of this study was to evaluate, in a prospective fashion, the 
quality of life as a primary endpoint in patients treated for cancers involving 
the oral cavity and requiring reconstruction. The study design consisted of a 
prospective evaluation of pre- and post-operative quality of life at 3, 6, and 
12 months to assess variations during follow-up using two different 
questionnaires: the University of Washington Quality of Life and the Head and 
Neck Performance Status Scale. Between May 1999 and October 2004, 92 patients 
with oral cancer requiring reconstruction were treated. All were included in the 
study, but only 35 (38%) concluded the evaluation protocol at one year after 
surgery without evidence of disease. The mean pre- and post-operative (3, 6, and 
12 months) scores of the questionnaires and the scores of specific University of 
Washington Quality of Life categories (disfigurement, chewing, swallowing, 
comprehension of speech) were evaluated. The impact on residual quality of life 
of different factors such as gender, extension of tongue and mandibular defects, 
type of reconstruction, and radiotherapy was statistically quantified with a 
Wilcoxon non-parametric test and logistic regression for multivariate analysis. 
Comparison of mean pre- and post-operative scores between the University of 
Washington Quality of Life and Head and Neck Performance Status Scale, showed a 
similar trend during the study period with a significant decrease at 3 months 
after surgery and subsequent gradual improvement at 6 and 12 months. The 
majority of patients (77%) preserved normal or near normal functions at 12 
months after surgery. The chewing domain worsened considerably (p <0.05), with 
poorer outcome in patients undergoing segmental mandibulectomy (p <0.05). By 
multivariate analysis, mandibular resection maintained its statistical 
significance in the chewing domain (p = 0.038). Moreover, the type of 
reconstruction was an independent factor (p = 0.038) that influenced the 
University of Washington Quality of Life total score, with better functional 
results after free flap reconstruction. Despite the dismal prognosis of patients 
affected by advanced oral cavity cancer, reconstructive techniques play a 
crucial role in maintenance of satisfactory quality of life.

Il trattamento chirurgico del cancro del cavo orale può esitare in drammatiche 
sequele estetiche e funzionali parzialmente evitabili mediante l’impiego di 
tecniche ricostruttive. Molti studi riguardanti la qualità della vita (“quality 
of life”, QoL) sono stati eseguiti al fine di valutare retrospettivamente i 
risultati ottenuti dopo tali procedure oncologiche maggiori. Scopo del presente 
lavoro è quello di valutare in maniera prospettica come obiettivo principale la 
QoL in pazienti trattati per cancro del cavo orale che abbia richiesto un tempo 
ricostruttivo. La pianificazione dello studio ha incluso una valutazione 
prospettica della QoL pre-operatoriamente e post-operatoriamente a 3, 6 e 12 
mesi al fine di valutarne le variazioni durante il follow-up usando due diversi 
questionari: l’University of Washington Quality of Life (UW-QoL) e l’Head and 
Neck Performance Status Scale (PSS-HN). Tra il maggio 1999 e l’ottobre 2004, 92 
pazienti con cancro del cavo orale sono stati trattati presso la nostra Clinica 
mediante chirurgia seguita da un tempo ricostruttivo. Tutti sono stati inclusi 
nello studio, ma soltanto 35 (38%) hanno portato a termine il protocollo di 
valutazione ad 1 anno dall’intervento senza alcuna evidenza di ripresa della 
malattia. I punteggi medi pre- e post-operatori a 3, 6 e 12 mesi e quelli delle 
specifiche categorie dell’UW-QoL (disestetismo, masticazione, deglutizione e 
comprensibilità dell’eloquio) sono stati valutati. L’impatto di diversi fattori, 
quali il sesso, l’estensione del difetto linguale e mandibolare, il tipo di 
ricostruzione utilizzata e l’impiego della radioterapia, sulla QoL è stato 
quantificato mediante un test non parametrico di Wilcoxon ed una regressione 
logistica con analisi multivariata. Il confronto dei punteggi medi pre- e 
post-operatori tra l’UW-QoL ed il PSS-HN ha mostrato un andamento simile durante 
il periodo di studio, con un significativo peggioramento della QoL a 3 mesi 
dall’intervento ed un successivo, graduale miglioramento a 6 e a 12 mesi. La 
maggior parte dei pazienti (77%) ha preservato funzioni normali o quasi normali 
a 12 mesi dall’intervento. La masticazione è peggiorata in modo significativo (p 
< 0,05), con risultati peggiori in quei pazienti sottoposti a mandibulectomia 
segmentaria (p < 0,05). All’analisi multivariata, la resezione mandibolare ha 
mantenuto il suo livello di significatività statistica per quanto riguarda il 
punteggio della masticazione (p = 0,038). Inoltre, il tipo di ricostruzione 
impiegato si è dimostrato un fattore indipendente (p = 0,038) nell’influenzare 
il punteggio totale dell’UW-QoL, con risultati funzionali migliori dopo 
ricostruzione mediante lembi liberi. Nonostante la prognosi infausta dei 
pazienti affetti da cancro del cavo orale in stadio avanzato, le tecniche 
ricostruttive giocano un ruolo cruciale nel mantenimento di una soddisfacente 
QoL post-operatoria.

Predicting the short form-6D preference-based index using the eight mean short 
form-36 health dimension scores: estimating preference-based health-related 
utilities when patient level data are not available.

Yorkshire, UK. r.m.ara@sheffield.ac.uk

OBJECTIVE: The objective is to derive an algorithm to predict a cohort 
preference-based short form-6D (short form-6D) score using the eight mean health 
dimension scores from the short form-36 (SF-36) when patient level data are not 
available.
METHODS: Health-related quality of life data (N = 6890) covering a wide range of 
health conditions was used to explore the relationship between the SF-6D and the 
eight health dimension scores. Models obtained using ordinary least square 
regressions were compared for goodness of fit and predictive abilities on both 
within-sample subgroups and out-of-sample published data sets.
RESULTS: The models explained more than 83% of the variance in the individual 
SF-6D scores with a mean absolute error of 0.040. When using mean health 
dimension scores from within-sample subgroups and out-of-sample published data 
sets, the majority of predicted scores were well within the minimal important 
difference (0.041) for the SF-6D.
CONCLUSIONS: This article presents a mechanism to estimate a mean cohort 
preference-based SF-6D score using the eight mean health dimension scores of the 
SF-36. Using published summary statistics, the out-of-sample validation 
demonstrates that the algorithms can be used to inform both clinical and 
economic research. Further research is required in different health conditions.

What outcomes are important to patients with long term conditions? A discrete 
choice experiment.

OBJECTIVE: To assess how much patients with long-term conditions value 
self-efficacy (i.e., confidence in their ability to manage their condition) 
compared with other health outcomes, including measures of quality of life, and 
process outcomes including access to General Practitioners.
METHODS: Discrete Choice Experiment (DCE) set in UK community settings.
PARTICIPANTS: 367 patients (mean age 57.5) living in the community with a wide 
range of self-defined long-term conditions.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The relative value that individuals place on four 
specific outcomes, namely, self-efficacy, Health Related Quality of Life 
(HRQoL), access to General Practitioners, and level of isolation.
RESULTS: Most responders completed their questionnaire in a consistent manner. 
Most valuations of outcomes were in the expected direction and were 
statistically significant. A substantial minority of responders exhibited 
counter-intuitive preferences. The existence of a significant constant in all 
models raised concerns about model misspecification. Nevertheless, all models 
showed that participants were willing to trade substantial reductions in their 
HRQoL for improvements in their self-efficacy.
CONCLUSIONS: The majority of patients with chronic conditions were able to 
complete the DCE questionnaires. However, the existence of counter-intuitive 
preferences and evidence of model misspecification require further 
investigation. These issues are largely overlooked in the health economics 
literature. Self-efficacy is an important outcome for this group and is not 
included explicitly in conventional HRQoL measures. This is potentially 
important where decisions are made on the basis of cost-effectiveness using 
Quality Adjusted Life Years as the metric. Exclusion of these outcomes may lead 
to the cost-effectiveness of these interventions being understated.

Cost-effectiveness of testing for breast cancer susceptibility genes.

Holland ML(1), Huston A, Noyes K.

Author information:
(1)Department of Community and Preventive Medicine, University of Rochester, 
Rochester, NY 14620, USA. margaret_holland@urmc.rochester.edu

OBJECTIVES: Genetic mutations in breast cancer susceptibility genes BRCA1/2 are 
associated with an increased risk of breast/ovarian cancers. Cost-effective 
preventive measures are available for women who test positive. The objective of 
this study was to determine at what risk of mutation it is cost-effective to 
test women for BRCA1/2 mutations.
METHODS: A semi-Markov model accrued costs and quality-adjusted life years 
(QALYs) annually from the societal perspective. The estimates of health-care 
costs, life expectancy, likelihood of obtaining a mastectomy or oophorectomy, 
and patient preferences for treatment and certainty about their BRCA1/2 status 
were based on the literature.
RESULTS: At a 10% probability of mutation (the current guideline), the test 
strategy generated 22.9 QALYs over the lifetime and cost $118k, while the 
no-test strategy generated 22.7 QALYs and cost $117k. The incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio of the test strategy was $9k and the differences 
between costs and effects were not substantial. The test strategy remained 
cost-effective to a probability of mutation of 0%, as long as utility gained 
from a negative test result was 0.006 or greater. These results were sensitive 
to the frequency of inconclusive test results and utility gain from a negative 
test result.
CONCLUSIONS: The costs and effectiveness of both the test and no-test strategies 
are very similar even when there is a small probability of mutation. Current 
guidelines, which can be used by insurance companies to refuse coverage, could 
deny some women a cost-effective approach. Further research to decrease the 
frequency of inconclusive results could improve the cost-effectiveness of this 
test.

OBJECTIVES: Pharmacogenomic applications in oncology offer significant promise, 
but the clinical and economic implications remain unclear. The objective of this 
study was to evaluate the potential cost-utility of implementing epidermal 
growth factor receptor (EGFR) testing before initiating second-line therapy for 
advanced refractory non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
METHODS: We developed a decision analytic model to evaluate the cost-utility of 
EGFR protein expression or gene copy number testing compared to standard care 
with erlotinib in refractory advanced NSCLC patients. Costs and utilities were 
obtained from publicly available sources. We performed sensitivity analyses to 
evaluate uncertainty in the results.
RESULTS: The quality-adjusted life expectancies for erlotinib, EGFR protein 
expression testing, and gene copy number testing were: 0.44, 0.48, and 0.50 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs); and the costs were: $57,238, $63,512, and 
$66,447, respectively. The most cost-effective testing option, EGFR gene copy 
number testing, produced an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 
$162,018/QALY compared to no testing (erlotinib). The results were most 
sensitive to the survival estimates, health state utilities, and cost of disease 
progression. In the probabilistic sensitivity analyses, erlotinib without 
testing was the optimal treatment strategy until the $150,000/QALY 
willingness-to-pay threshold, after which gene copy testing was optimal. The 
discounted expected value of perfect information at a $100,000/QALY threshold in 
the USA over 5 years was $31.4 million.
CONCLUSIONS: The study results suggest that EGFR pharmacogenomic testing has the 
potential to improve quality-adjusted life expectancy in the treatment of 
refractory NSCLC by a clinically meaningful margin at a value commensurate with 
the approved therapies in this setting. Additional research in this area is 
warranted.

Author information:
(1)School of Health and Related Research, The University of Sheffield, 
Sheffield, England, UK. cmp04yy@sheffield.ac.uk

OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study is to estimate a preference-based single index 
for calculating quality-adjusted life years for patients with overactive bladder 
(OAB), based on a survey of the UK general population using the 5-dimensional 
health classification system OAB-5D, derived from the validated Overactive 
Bladder Questionnaire (OAB-q).
METHODS: An interview valuation survey of members of public in the South 
Yorkshire, UK was undertaken using the time-trade-off method. Each respondent 
was randomly allocated to one of 14 blocks, and valued seven states each plus 
the "pits" state, so that a total of 99 states were valued. A number of 
multivariate regression models were estimated for predicting a total of 3125 
health state values defined by the classification. Models were compared and 
selected using a set of criteria, including overall diagnosis by adjusted 
R-squared, the sign and significance of individual parameter estimates, the 
relative size of coefficients within a given dimension and predictive ability.
RESULTS: The mean model was recommended for use in economic evaluation.
CONCLUSION: This will permit the cost-effectiveness of new interventions to be 
assessed in patients with OAB using existing and future OAB-q data sets.

BACKGROUND: The rate of biological ageing is individual and represents the 
steady decrease in physiological and mental functions. Adverse social factors 
have been shown to influence this process. Self-perceived early ageing (SEA) 
might be a useful indicator of early biological ageing and increased mortality 
risk. The aim of this population-based study was to identify markers of SEA, 
including telomere length.
METHODS: We studied 1502 subjects (744 men, 758 women) from Northern Sweden. 
These subjects underwent a physical examination, blood sampling (including 
telomere length) and completed a self-administered questionnaire about their 
subjective age, social situation, lifestyle, and self-rated health (SRH). Age- 
and SRH-adjusted statistical analyses were made comparing SEA subjects with 
same-sex controls.
RESULTS: In all, 7.9% of men and 12.1% of women reported SEA. These subjects had 
significantly (p<0.0001) wider waist circumference and higher body mass index 
than controls. SEA men showed higher fasting glucose and SEA women showed higher 
total cholesterol levels than controls (p=0.020 and p=0.015, respectively). In 
addition, SEA women more often reported infrequent physical exercise (p=0.006), 
mental problems (p=0.064) and worse SRH (p=0.001) than controls. In a random 
sub-sample, telomere length was significantly shorter in SEA subjects (n=139) 
than controls (n=301; p=0.02), but not after full adjustment for BMI.
CONCLUSIONS: Self-perceived early ageing is not uncommon and is associated with 
abdominal obesity, poor self-rated health, lower education, and shorter telomere 
length. This could link adverse social factors with features of the metabolic 
syndrome as well as with early biological ageing, of importance for targeting 
preventive programmes.

South Africa. ianc@ul.ac.za

AIMS: The Dikgale Demographic Surveillance System (DDSS) site, established in 
1995, is one of three rural surveillance sites in South Africa. This paper 
describes detailed mortality patterns of a rural African population in the 
central region of Limpopo Province.
METHODS: These data were based on yearly household visits to collect data on 
vital events, covering 63, 873 person-years of observation over eight years.
RESULTS: Crude mortality was 7.5 per 1,000 person-years (females: 6.9, males: 
8.1). Under-1 year and under-5 years mortality was 15.1 and 5.8 per 1,000 
person-years, respectively. Life expectancy at birth was 64.3 years (females: 
68.1, males: 60.0). For the two four-year periods (1996-9 and 2000-3) under-20 
years mortality risk decreased (rate ratio=0.45, 95% CI: 0.25 to 0.80) while 
20-49 years mortality risk increased (rate ratio=1.55, 95% CI: 1.10 to 2.20). 
Multivariate mortality risk for migrants remained relatively constant (0.71, 95% 
CI: 0.54 to 0.94) across the two four-year periods, but has increased 2.5-fold 
in all DDSS +50 year-old adults across the two four-year periods.
CONCLUSIONS: The DDSS mortality estimates appear to have remained relatively 
constant while recent mortality estimates for the Agincourt Demographic and 
Health Surveillance System (ADHSS) site suggest that mortality risk is higher 
and life expectancy is lower in ADHSS residents. Moreover, DDSS mortality 
estimates are substantially more favourable compared with provincial and 
national mortality estimates.

pain.

OBJECTIVE: Patients at low risk for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) who present to 
the emergency department complaining of acute chest pain place a substantial 
economic burden on the U.S. health care system. Noninvasive 64-MDCT coronary 
angiography may facilitate their triage, and we evaluated its 
cost-effectiveness.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A microsimulation model was developed to compare costs 
and health effects of performing CT coronary angiography and either discharging, 
stress testing, or referring emergency department patients for invasive coronary 
angiography, depending on their severity of atherosclerosis, compared with a 
standard-of-care (SOC) algorithm that based management on biomarkers and stress 
tests alone.
RESULTS: Using CT coronary angiography to triage 55-year-old men with acute 
chest pain increased emergency department and hospital costs by $110 and raised 
total health care costs by $200. In 55-year-old women, the technology was 
cost-saving; emergency department and hospital costs decreased by $410, and 
total health care costs decreased by $380. Compared with the SOC, CT coronary 
angiography-based triage extended life expectancy by 10 days in men and by 6 
days in women. This translated into corresponding improvements of 0.03 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and 0.01 QALYs, respectively. The 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for CT coronary angiography was $6,400 per 
QALY in men; in women, CT coronary angiography was cost-saving. 
Cost-effectiveness ratios were sensitive to several parameters but generally 
remained in the range of what is typically considered cost-effective.
CONCLUSION: CT coronary angiography-based triage for patients with low-risk 
chest pain is modestly more effective than the SOC. It is also cost-saving in 
women and associated with low cost-effectiveness ratios in men.

BACKGROUND: Innate neuroimmune dysfunction is a pathobiological feature of 
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). However, links, if any, between disease and 
adaptive immunity are poorly understood. Thus, the role of T cell immunity in 
disease was investigated in human G93A superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) transgenic 
(Tg) mice and subsequently in ALS patients.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: Quantitative and qualitative immune deficits in lymphoid 
cell and T cell function were seen in G93A-SOD1 Tg mice. Spleens of Tg animals 
showed reductions in size, weight, lymphocyte numbers, and morphological 
deficits at terminal stages of disease compared to their wild-type (Wt) 
littermates. Spleen sizes and weights of pre-symptomatic Tg mice were unchanged, 
but deficits were readily seen in T cell proliferation coincident with increased 
annexin-V associated apoptosis and necrosis of lymphocytes. These lymphoid 
deficits paralleled failure of Copolymer-1 (COP-1) immunization to affect 
longevity. In addition, among CD4(+) T cells in ALS patients, levels of 
CD45RA(+) (naïve) T cells were diminished, while CD45RO(+) (memory) T cells were 
increased compared to age-matched caregivers. In attempts to correct mutant SOD1 
associated immune deficits, we reconstituted SOD1 Tg mice with unfractionated 
naïve lymphocytes or anti-CD3 activated CD4(+)CD25(+) T regulatory cells (Treg) 
or CD4(+)CD25(-) T effector cells (Teff) from Wt donor mice. While naive 
lymphocytes failed to enhance survival, both polyclonal-activated Treg and Teff 
subsets delayed loss of motor function and extended survival; however, only Treg 
delayed neurological symptom onset, whereas Teff increased latency between 
disease onset and entry into late stage.
CONCLUSIONS: A profound and progressive immunodeficiency is operative in 
G93A-SOD1 mice and is linked to T cell dysfunction and the failure to elicit 
COP-1 neuroprotective immune responses. In preliminary studies T cell deficits 
were also observed in human ALS. These findings, taken together, suggest caution 
in ascribing vaccination outcomes when these animal models of human ALS are used 
for study. Nonetheless, the abilities to improve neurological function and life 
expectancy in G93A-SOD1 Tg mice by reconstitution with activated T cells do 
provide opportunities for therapeutic intervention.

Cardiovascular disease could be contained based on currently available data!

Largely due to better control of infectious diseases and significant advances in 
biomedical research, life expectancy worldwide has increased dramatically in the 
last three decades. However, as the average age of the population has risen, the 
incidence of chronic age-related diseases such as arthritis, Alzheimer's, 
Parkinson's, cardiovascular disease, cancer, osteoporosis, benign prostatic 
hyperplasia, and late-onset diabetes have increased and have become serious 
public health problem, as well. The etiology of these disorders is still 
incompletely understood, therefore, neither preventive strategies nor long-term 
effective treatment modalities are available for these disorders. In keeping 
with the aforementioned, the ultimate goal in cardiovascular research is to 
prevent the onset of cardiovascular episodes and thereby allow successful ageing 
without morbidity and cognitive decline. Herein, I argue that cardiovascular 
episodes could be contained with relatively simple approaches. Cardiovascular 
disorder is characterized by cellular and molecular changes that are commonplace 
in age-related diseases in other organ system, such alterations include 
increased level of oxidative stress, perturbed energy metabolism, and "horror 
autotoxicus" largely brought about by the perturbation of ubiquitin -proteasome 
system, and excessive oxidative stress damage to the cardiac muscle cells and 
tissues, and cross-reactions of specific antibodies against human heat shock 
protein 60 with that of mycobacterial heat shock protein 65. "Horror 
autotoxicus", a Latin expression, is a term coined by Paul Ehrlich at the turn 
of the last century to describe autoimmunity to self, or the attack of "self" by 
immune system, which ultimately results to autoimmune condition. Based on the 
currently available data, the risk of cardiovascular episodes and several other 
age-related disorders, including cancer, Alzheimer's disease and diabetes, is 
known to be influenced by the nature and level of food intake. Now, a wealth of 
scientific data from studies of rodents and monkeys has documented the 
significant beneficial effects of calorie restriction (CR) or dietary 
restriction (DR), and multiple antioxidant agents in extending life span and 
reducing the incidence of progeroid-related diseases. Reduced levels of cellular 
oxidative stress, protection of genome from deleterious damage, detoxification 
of toxic molecules, and enhancement of energy homeostasis, contribute to the 
beneficial effects of dietary restriction and multiple antioxidant agents. 
Recent findings suggest that employment of DR and multiple antioxidant agents 
(including, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, CuZn superoxide dismutase, and Mn 
superoxide dismutase = enzymes forming the primary defense against oxygen 
toxicity), and ozone therapy may mount an effective resistance to pathogenic 
factors relevant to the pathogenesis of cardiovascular episodes. Hence, while 
further studies will be needed to establish the extent to which CR and multiple 
antioxidant agents will reduce incidence of cardiovascular episodes in humans, 
it would seem prudent to recommend CR and multiple antioxidant agents as widely 
applicable preventive approach for cardiovascular disorders and other 
progeroid-related disorders.

Role of hormesis in life extension by caloric restriction.

Science Center, San Antonio, TX, USA. masoro@aol.com

Caloric restriction (CR) markedly extends the life of rats, mice and several 
other species, and it also modulates age-associated physiological deterioration 
and delays the occurrence and/or slows progression of age-associated diseases. 
The level of CR that retards the aging processes is a low-intensity stressor, 
which enhances the ability of rats and mice of all ages to cope with intense 
stressors. CR thus exhibits a hormetic action in these species, and therefore it 
is hypothesized that hormesis plays a role in the life-extending and anti-aging 
actions of CR. Both the findings in support of this hypothesis and those 
opposing it are critically considered. However, it is likely that hormesis is 
not the only process contributing to CR-induced life extension. It is proposed 
that two general processes are involved in CR-induced life extension. One is the 
reduced endogenous generation of damaging agents, such as reactive oxygen 
species. The second is hormesis, which enhances processes that protect against 
the action of damaging agents and also promotes processes that repair the damage 
once it occurs.

Intense stress can challenge tissue homeostasis and accelerate the ageing 
process. However, several lines of evidence indicate that repeated mild stresses 
can have beneficial and even life-prolonging effects. Hypersecretion of 
glucocorticoids (GC) represents the major hormonal response to stress. Besides 
its life-sustaining role, GC excess, usually due to several side-effects that 
promote a "catabolic" phenotype, can be detrimental for several tissues. 
Cushing's syndrome patients are characterized by chronic endogenous GC excess 
and consequently at the time of diagnosis they have an atrophic elderly-like 
skin. Interestingly, when Cushing's syndrome fibroblasts were removed from the 
high-GC milieu in vivo and cultured in vitro under standard conditions they 
express an "anabolic" phenotype, i.e. they restore their ability for collagen 
synthesis, they secrete reduced levels of metalloproteases (MMP-1 and MMP-2) and 
have an increased proliferative capacity and contractility. Furthermore, these 
cells exhibit a significant extension of their proliferative lifespan, while 
they respond better to exogenous stress by producing significantly higher levels 
of heat-shock protein-70 (HSP70). These results imply that long-term 
hypercortisolism in vivo can have beneficial consequences on fibroblast 
physiology in vitro.

Comment on
    Skin Therapy Lett. 2008 Nov-Dec;13(8):4.

Ultraviolet (UV) radiation is a carcinogen that also compromises skin appearance 
and function. Since the UV action spectra for DNA damage, skin cancer, and 
vitamin D photosynthesis are identical, and vitamin D is readily available from 
oral supplements, why has sun protection become controversial? First, the media 
and, apparently, some researchers are hungry for a new message. They have also 
drawn attention to the emerging evidence of possible vitamin D benefits other 
than for bone health. Second, the controversy is fueled by a powerful special 
interest group: the tanning industry. This industry does not target the frail 
elderly or inner-city ethnic minorities, which are the groups at greatest risk 
of vitamin D deficiency, but rather fair-skinned teenagers and young adults, who 
are at highest risk of UV photodamage. Third, evolution does not keep pace with 
civilization. When nature gave humans the appealing capacity for cutaneous 
vitamin D photosynthesis, life expectancy was less than 40 years of age; 
long-term photodamage was not a concern, and vitamin D deficiency, with its 
resulting skeletal abnormalities (rickets), was likely to be fatal in early 
life. This article briefly reviews the pseudo-controversy , as well as the data 
supporting a revision of the recommendations for vitamin D supplementation. It 
concludes with a suggested message for patients, many of whom are understandably 
confused by recent media coverage of the topic.

Tilleul, Belgium. didier.dequanter@chu-charleroi.be

BACKGROUND: The treatment of massive and/or symptomatic pericardial effusion in 
patients with cancer remains a subject of discussion. Medical and surgical 
management have been proposed. In the present study, we aimed to determine the 
prognostic factors influencing survival of cancer patients admitted in intensive 
care unit (ICU) with severe pericardial effusion to better select the treatment 
strategies.
METHODS: All patients with cancer and massive or symptomatic pericardial 
effusion were retrospectively analyzed. Patients were followed up until death or 
last time known to be alive. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed 
to determine prognostic factors influencing survival.
RESULTS: Between January 1999 and August 2004, 55 eligible patients were 
admitted in the ICU for pericardial effusion, including 30 with lung cancer, 9 
with breast cancer, 5 with hematological malignancies, and 11 patients with 
other types of solid tumors. Forty-three patients underwent a surgical drainage. 
No operative death occurred. Four patients presented with an asymptomatic 
recurrence. Median survival of the entire group was 112 days. Survival rates for 
1, 2, and 3 years were 27%, 17%, and 12%, respectively. In univariate analysis, 
the following variables were significantly associated with a reduced survival: 
histopathological diagnosis of malignant pericardial effusion, age (>60 years), 
the volume of pericardial effusion (<550 cc), and the cancer status (complete or 
partial response). After multivariate analysis, the cancer status was the only 
statistically significant clinical factor influencing overall survival (P = 
.005).
CONCLUSION: In this series of patients presenting with severe pericardial 
effusion, the control of the underlying neoplasm was the only significant factor 
influencing survival and could be helpful in making decision to the optimal 
(invasive) treatment that should balance treatment efficacy with life 
expectancy.

BACKGROUND: A significant proportion of advanced stage head and neck cancer 
patients are incurable and have a limited life expectancy. This study reports a 
single institution experience with a hypofractionated radiotherapy regimen for 
palliation of loco-regionally advanced and incurable HNSCC.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between 2000 and 2005, 110 patients of unresectable HNSCC 
were treated with a palliative radiotherapy (40Gy in 16 fractions). Distressing 
symptoms were assessed before treatment. Patients with good objective regression 
with acceptable toxicity received further escalation of dose till 50Gy. We made 
three strata to compare symptomatic improvement namely percentage relief <50%, 
between 50-75% and >75% as compared to baseline.
RESULTS: Most common baseline distressing complaints were pain in 109 (99%) 
patients and dysphagia in 97 (88%) patients. Eleven patients (10%) had complete 
response (CR) and 80 (73%) patients had complete and partial response (PR). At 
completion of radiotherapy 26%, 57%, and 17% of patients had <50%, 50-75%, and 
>75% symptomatic relief, respectively. The overall PFS (defined as either 
complete disappearance of the disease or non-progression in the irradiated 
field) at 12 months was 55.1% (95% CI, 40.3%-69.9%). On multivariate analysis 
weight >50kg (p=0.049) and radiotherapy dose of more than 40Gy (p=0.012) were 
found to be significant for PFS. Acute and late reactions were acceptable.
CONCLUSIONS: The hypofractionated radiotherapy regimen evaluated is an effective 
treatment modality for sustained symptoms relief with good response rates and 
acceptable toxicity.

How to manage patients with aortic stenosis?

Orłowska-Baranowska E.

Aortic stenosis is a form of valvular heart disease that is bound to be seen 
more and more often by healthcare professionals in the coming years. This is due 
to the increasing life expectancy and the increasing rate of incidental 
echocardiographic diagnosis in asymptomatic patients. No effective drug 
treatment for AS is available. Symptomatic patients with significant AS should 
be referred for surgery. When deciding the method and timing of management, 
cardiologists and cardiac surgeons should take into consideration the symptoms 
present, the patient.'s age (life expectancy) and the echocardiographic 
evaluation of the severity of stenosis. The riskto- benefit ratio of the various 
management options should be assessed individually. (Cardiol J 2007; 14: 
510-517).

Lifespan extension and increased pumping rate accompany pharyngeal 
muscle-specific expression of nfi-1 in C. elegans.

Caenorhabditis elegans nfi-1 belongs to the Nuclear Factor I (NFI) family of 
transcription factors known to regulate metazoan gene expression and 
development. We showed previously that loss of nfi-1 in worms results in 
multiple behavioral defects; slower pharyngeal pumping rate, impaired egg 
laying, defective motility, and a shortened life span. Here, we generated 
cell-type specific transgenic worms to determine the cells in which nfi-1 must 
be expressed to rescue the pharyngeal pumping defect. Expression of nfi-1 from 
the pharyngeal muscle-specific myo-2 promoter, but not from the F25B3.3 or myo-3 
promoters, rescued the pharyngeal pumping defect of nfi-1 worms. Surprisingly, 
myo-2-driven nfi-1 expression also rescued the shortened lifespan of nfi-1 
worms, demonstrating a possible cell-autonomous role of nfi-1 in pharyngeal 
muscle for both phenotypes. We propose some relationships between the pharyngeal 
pumping and lifespan phenotypes and potential mechanisms of nfi-1 function.
