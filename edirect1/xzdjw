BACKGROUND: Tobacco smoking is one of the most preventable causes of mortality 
related to noncommunicable diseases (NCDs). This study aimed to estimate the 
direct economic burden and years of life lost (YLL) attributable to smoking in 
NCDs in Mashhad, 2015-2016.
METHODS: Hospital-based data were utilized to calculate the economic burden of 
four selected diseases related to smoking. An epidemiological 
population-attributable risk method was used to determine the 
smoking-attributable fraction (SAF). Moreover, the study was conducted by data 
related to disease-specific expenditures and patients' information on cost and 
the number of mortality for estimating the YLL for each disease, population and 
life expectancy data, the prevalence of smoking, and the relative risk of 
smoking. Data analysis was performed with STATA software, version 12.
RESULTS: The total costs attributable to smoking for stroke, myocardial 
infarction, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and lung cancer were 
94148, 151272, 1191396, and 574784 US Dollars, respectively (per 100000). In 
2015, the YLL per deaths due to COPD were 4217 and 3522 among males and females, 
respectively. Furthermore, in 2016, the YLL per deaths due to the stroke in 
males and females were 8317 and 7563, respectively. In the same year, the 
highest proportion of years of potential life lost per 100000 
smoking-attributable deaths belonged to COPD.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study can be used to inform policy-makers about 
smoking-attributable diseases in Iran. To decrease the smoking-attributable 
costs, which have resulted in the spread of NCDs, policy-makers should adopt and 
implement effective policies regarding smoking prevention and control.

INTRODUCTION: The primary studies demonstrated that fabellar prevalence (FP) 
varied with ethnic and geographical distribution. Osteoarthritis (OA) and 
age-related degeneration have a significant association with FP. The prevalence 
of OA worldwide was doubled with life expectancy. Increased life expectancy has 
increased exposure to OA and age-related degeneration which could be a possible 
reason for the rise of FP. The analysis was conducted to provide insight about 
FP in respect to geographical, ethnic, sex, and laterality distribution.
METHODOLOGY: Eighty-six studies were included which have data from 34,733 knee 
joints. Fifty radiological studies were consisting of 27,293 knees and 36 
cadaveric studies had the data of 7,440 knees of dissected specimens, 
respectively. The prevalence, Odds, and rate ratios were calculated for aging, 
osteoarthritis, and ethnic variation.  Results: The worldwide FP was 25% (95% 
CI, 0.22, 0.28). The prevalence of fabella was found to be higher in cadaveric 
studies (32%) than radiological studies (19%) with significant heterogeneity. 
The FP was 16-18% till 1950 which was doubled by 2020 (35%). The FP in OA knee 
was 51% which was thrice of baseline.

BACKGROUND: Primary osteoporosis is a common complication of aging and 
menopause. The negative effects of osteoporosis in the coming years will 
increase by increasing life expectancy and population aging. The purpose of this 
research was to compare health-promoting lifestyle and quality of life in 
postmenopausal women with and without primary osteoporosis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This cross-sectional analytical research was conducted on 
445 postmenopausal women aged 50-65 selected by simple random sampling in Tabriz 
health centers from September 2018 to July 2019. Data collection instruments 
included demographic, midwifery, anthropometric, health-promoting lifestyle 
profile II and menopausal quality-of-life questionnaire questionnaires, and 
serum test checklist (25-hydroxy vitamin D, complete blood count/diff, 
thyroid-stimulating hormone, fasting blood sugar, Calcium, and Phosphor). 
Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry method was used to measure bone density. Data 
were analyzed using SPSS/23 through descriptive and inferential statistics such 
as Chi-square, independent t-test, Mann-Whitney, and multiple regression.
RESULTS: The mean score of lifestyle was 141.2 ± 21.9 in normal and 127.2 ± 25.4 
in osteoporosis group, and differences were statistically significant in total 
score (P < 0.001) and all subdomains. The mean score of quality of life was 3.9 
± 1.2 in the normal and 4.5 ± 1.4 in the osteoporotic group. The differences 
were significant in total score (P < 0.001) and all subdomains except for sexual 
function subdomain (P = 0.064). Logistic regression adjusted for confounders 
indicated by one unit increase in total lifestyle score, the odds of primary 
osteoporosis reduced by 2.2% (adjusted odds ratio [0.95% confidence interval]: 
0.978 [0.963-0.994], P = 0.006).
CONCLUSION: To prevent of primary osteoporosis and improve the quality of life 
of postmenopausal women, it seems that education and implementation of 
health-promoting lifestyle are essential. The research findings can be used to 
plan for health care in middle and old ages.

System design is recognized as one of the most critical components of a software 
system that bridges system requirements and coding. System design also has a 
significant impact on testing and maintenance activities, and on further 
improvements during the lifespan of the software system. Software design should 
reflect all necessary components of the requirements in a clear and 
understandable manner by all stakeholders of the software system. To distinguish 
system elements, separation of concerns in software design is suggested. In this 
respect, identification of the user tasks, i.e., the tasks that need to be 
performed by the user, is not currently reflected explicitly in system design 
documents. Our main assumption in this study is that software quality can be 
improved significantly by clearly identifying the user tasks from those that 
need to be performed by the computer system itself. Additionally, what we 
propose has the potential to better reflect the user requirements and main 
objectives of the system on the software design and thereby to improve software 
quality. The main aim of this study is to introduce a novel notation for 
software developers in the frame of UML Activity Diagram (UML-AD) that enables 
designers to identify the user tasks and define them separately from the system 
tasks. For this purpose, an extension of UML-AD, named UML-ADE (UML-Activity 
Diagram Extended) was proposed. Afterwards, it was implemented in a serious game 
case for which the specification of user tasks is extremely important. Finally, 
its effectiveness was analyzed and compared to UML-AD experimentally with 72 
participants. The defect detection performance of the participants on both 
diagrams with two real-life serious game scenarios was evaluated. Results show a 
higher level of understandability for those using UML-ADE, which in turn may 
indicate a better design and higher software quality. The results encourage 
researchers to develop specific design representations dedicated to task design 
to improve system quality and to conduct further evaluations of the impact of 
these design on each of the above mentioned potential benefits for the software 
systems.

OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the cost-effectiveness of a community-based 
colorectal cancer-screening program (C-CRCSP) in Shanghai, China, among the 
residents in the urban, suburban and rural areas.
METHODS: A Markov model was constructed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a 
25-year annual C-CRCSP including 100 000 populations. Cost-effectiveness was 
determined by the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER); referring to 
either life-years gained, or quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained. The 
threshold was gross domestic product per capita. Univariate and multivariate 
sensitivity analyses were performed to investigate the influence of compliance, 
prevalence, technological performance, medical cost and annual cost discount 
rate (3.5%) on ICER. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis evaluated the 
probability of the cost-effectiveness of C-CRCSP at different maximum acceptable 
ceiling ratios.
RESULTS: Compared with no screening, the C-CRCSP resulted in total gains of 7840 
QALYs and 2210 life-years (LY), at a total cost of CNY 58.54 million; that is, 
the ICER were CNY 7460/QALYs and CNY 26650/LY. Stratifying by residency, the 
cumulative gains in QALYs and LY were estimated to be the lowest in the urban 
populations compared with the rural and suburban populations. The cost for the 
urban population was 3-fold and 6-fold that of the suburban and rural 
populations. The ICER for QALYs ranged from 2180 (rural) to 16 840 (urban).
CONCLUSION: The cost-effectiveness of a C-CRCSP in Shanghai was most favorable 
for the rural population, while the urban population benefits less in terms of 
QALYs. ICER could be enhanced by measures that increase compliance.

In mammals, eight aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (AARSs) and three AARS-interacting 
multifunctional proteins (AIMPs) form a multi-tRNA synthetase complex (MSC). MSC 
components possess extension peptides for MSC assembly and specific functions. 
Human cytosolic methionyl-tRNA synthetase (MRS) has appended peptides at both 
termini of the catalytic main body. The N-terminal extension includes a 
glutathione transferase (GST) domain responsible for interacting with AIMP3, and 
a long linker peptide between the GST and catalytic domains. Herein, we 
determined crystal structures of the human MRS catalytic main body, and the 
complex of the GST domain and AIMP3. The structures reveal human-specific 
structural details of the MRS, and provide a dynamic model for MRS at the level 
of domain orientation. A movement of zinc knuckles inserted in the catalytic 
domain is required for MRS catalytic activity. Depending on the position of the 
GST domain relative to the catalytic main body, MRS can either block or present 
its tRNA binding site. Since MRS is part of a huge MSC, we propose a dynamic 
switching between two possible MRS conformations; a closed conformation in which 
the catalytic domain is compactly attached to the MSC, and an open conformation 
with a free catalytic domain dissociated from other MSC components.

OBJECTIVES: In nursing homes (NHs), 30% to 60% of patients experience daily pain 
and >80% have dementia. This can lead to neuropsychiatric symptoms, including 
psychosis symptoms such as delusion. We investigated if there was a relationship 
between pain and psychosis symptoms over time. We also aimed to investigate the 
effect of a multicomponent intervention (COSMOS) on pain, psychosis symptoms, 
and analgesic prescription.
DESIGN: COSMOS is a cluster-randomized, single blinded, controlled trial. Each 
NH unit was defined as a cluster and randomized to either the COSMOS 
intervention or care as usual. The COSMOS intervention is a multicomponent 
intervention, consisting of staff training in communication, pain treatment, 
medication review, organization of activities, and safety. The intervention 
lasted for 4 months with a follow-up at month 9.
SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Sixty-seven units from 33 Norwegian NHs in 8 
municipalities. The study included 723 patients aged ≥65 years, residing at the 
NH ≥2 weeks before inclusion. Patients with a life expectancy <6 months were 
excluded.
MEASURES: Pain was measured using the 
Mobilization-Observation-Behavior-Intensity-Dementia Pain Scale. Psychosis 
symptoms were measured using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory-NH version. 
Measurements were performed at baseline, and months 4 and 9.
RESULTS: Multilevel Mixed-Effect statistical analysis found that psychosis 
symptoms as a group (odds ratio [OR] 2.03, P = .009), and delusion (OR 2.12, P = 
.007) were associated with pain over time. No significant intervention effect on 
psychosis symptoms was observed. Compared with the control group, people with 
dementia in the intervention group experienced less musculoskeletal pain 
(β: -0.47, P = .047). Analgesic prescription was not affected by the 
intervention.
CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Pain is associated with psychosis symptoms, and 
pain assessment should be done when making treatment decisions on psychosis 
symptoms in NH patients. The COSMOS intervention improved musculoskeletal pain 
in people with dementia, but not psychosis symptoms, and there is need for 
further studies on treatment of psychosis symptoms in NH patients.

Rural-urban health disparities in life expectancy are large and increasing, with 
the rural-urban disparity stroke mortality serving as a potential contributor. 
Data from Vital Statistics shows an unexplained temporal pattern in the 
rural-urban disparity in stroke-specific mortality, with the magnitude of the 
disparity increasing from 15% to 25% between 1999 and 2010, but subsequently 
decreasing to 8% by 2019. This recent decrease in the magnitude of the 
rural-urban disparity in stroke mortality appears to be driven by a previously 
unreported plateauing of stroke mortality in urban areas and a continued decline 
of stroke mortality in rural areas. There is a need to better understand the 
contributors to these temporal changes; however, a general lack of temporal data 
on potential contributors prevents this investigation. However considering 
contributors to the rural-urban differences pooled across time, an overall a 
higher stroke incidence in rural areas appears to be a contributor to the higher 
rural stroke mortality, with this higher incidence potentially associated with a 
higher prevalence of stroke risk factors in rural areas. Conversely, studies 
assessing rural-urban disparities in stroke case fatality show smaller and 
inconsistent associations. To the extent that disparities in case fatality do 
exist, there are many studies showing rural-urban disparities in stroke care 
could be contributing. While these data offer insights to the overall 
rural-urban disparities in stroke mortality, additional data are needed to help 
understand temporal changes in the magnitude of the rural-urban stroke mortality 
disparity.

Since Nixon famously declared war on cancer in 1971, trillions of dollars have 
been spent on cancer research but the life expectancy for most forms of cancer 
is still poor. There are many reasons for the partial success of cancer 
translational research. One of these can be the predominance of certain 
paradigms that potentially narrowed the vision in interpreting cancer. The main 
paradigm to explain carcinogenesis is based on DNA mutations, which is well 
interpreted by the somatic mutation theory (SMT). However, a different theory 
claims that cancer is instead a tissue disease as proposed by the Tissue 
Organization Field Theory (TOFT). Here, we propose new hypotheses to explain the 
origin and pathogenesis of cancer. In this perspective, the 
systemic-evolutionary theory of cancer (SETOC) is discussed as well as how the 
microenvironment affects the adaptation of transformed cells and the reversion 
to a unicellular-like or embryo-like phenotype.

BACKGROUND: Covid-19 has caused many complications for both the infected and 
those in need of medical care. This may be due to infection-related prognosis 
worsening or the patients' avoidance of referring to the hospital for fear of 
contracting the infection. The decline of acute referral to the ER of many 
significant conditions with severe results on both the well-being and 
life-expectancy is a serious concern. To address these concerns, we designed 
this study to evaluate the recent pandemic's impact on "in-hospital mortality" 
caused by neurological disorders pre and postpandemic.
METHODS AND MATERIAL: The inclusion criteria were any acute neurological 
condition and the consent of the patients eligible for our study. The 
definitions of all assessed conditions and the comorbidities are ICD-10 based. 
Hypertension and diabetes mellitus, due to their high prevalence, were evaluated 
separately from other internal comorbidities. The total number of the enrolled 
patients was 1742, 671 of whom had been during the COVID-19 pandemic, and 1071 
had attended the ER during the prepandemic era.
RESULTS: The overall mortality was significantly higher during the pandemic, and 
the covid infected had suffered higher mortality rates. (p-value < 0.05) 
CONCLUSION: During the pandemic, those with minor strokes and other 
nonlife-threatening ailments had avoided hospital care leading to a 
significantly higher rate of critical conditions. Increased incidence of strokes 
and ICHs during the pandemic, too, caused significant increased in-hospital 
mortality.

Resilience is widely seen as an important attribute of coastal systems and, as a 
concept, is increasingly prominent in policy documents. However, there are 
conflicting ideas on what constitutes resilience and its operationalisation as 
an overarching principle of coastal management remains limited. In this paper, 
we show how resilience to coastal flood and erosion hazard could be measured and 
applied within policy processes, using England as a case study. We define 
resilience pragmatically, integrating what is presently a disparate set of 
policy objectives for coastal areas. Our definition uses the concepts of 
resistance, recovery and adaptation, to consider how the economic, social and 
environmental dimensions of coastal systems respond to change. We develop a set 
of composite indicators for each dimension, grounded empirically with reference 
to national geospatial datasets. A prototype Coastal Resilience Model (CRM) has 
been developed, which combines the dimensions and generates a quantitative 
resilience index. We apply it to England's coastal hazard zone, capturing a 
range of different stakeholder perspectives using relative indicator weightings. 
The illustrative results demonstrate the practicality of formalising and 
quantifying resilience. To re-focus national policy around the stated desire of 
enhancing resilience to coastal flooding and erosion would require firm 
commitment from government to monitor progress towards resilience, requiring 
extension of the present risk-based approach, and a consensus methodology in 
which multiple (and sometimes conflicting) stakeholder values are explicitly 
considered. Such a transition may also challenge existing governance 
arrangements at national and local levels, requiring incentives for coastal 
managers to engage with and apply this new approach, more departmental 
integration and inter-agency cooperation. The proposed Coastal Resilience Model, 
with the tools to support planning and measure progress, has the potential to 
help enable this transition.

IMPORTANCE: Despite efforts to enhance serious illness communication, patients 
with advanced heart failure (HF) lack prognostic understanding.
OBJECTIVES: To determine rate of concordance between HF patients' estimation of 
their prognosis and their physician's estimate of the patient's prognosis, and 
to compare patient characteristics associated with concordance.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis of a cluster randomized controlled trial with 
24-month follow-up and analysis completed on 09/01/2020. Patients were enrolled 
in inpatient and outpatient settings between September 2011 to February 2016 and 
data collection continued until the last quarter of 2017.
SETTING: Six teaching hospitals in the U.S.
PARTICIPANTS: Patients with advanced HF and implantable cardioverter 
defibrillators (ICDs) at high risk of death. Of 537 patients in the parent 
study, 407 had complete data for this analysis.
INTERVENTION: A multi-component communication intervention on conversations 
between HF clinicians and their patients regarding ICD deactivation and advance 
care planning.
MAIN OUTCOME(S) AND MEASURE(S): Patient self-report of prognosis and physician 
response to the "surprise question" of 12-month prognosis. Patient-physician 
prognostic concordance (PPPC) measured in percentage agreement and kappa. 
Bivariate analyses of characteristics of patients with and without PPPC.
RESULTS: Among 407 patients (mean age 62.1 years, 29.5% female, 42.4% 
non-white), 300 (73.7%) dyads had non-PPPC; of which 252 (84.0%) reported a 
prognosis >1 year when their physician estimated <1 year. Only 107 (26.3%) had 
PPPC with prognosis of ≤ 1 year (n=20 patients) or > 1 year (n=87 patients); 
(Κ = -0.20, p = 1.0). Of those with physician estimated prognosis of < 1 year, 
non-PPPC was more likely among patients with lower symptom burden- number and 
severity (both p ≤.001), without completed advance directive (p=.001). Among 
those with physician prognosis estimate > 1 year, no patient characteristic was 
associated with PPPC or non-PPPC.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Non-PPPC between HF patients and their physicians is 
high. HF patients are more optimistic than clinicians in estimating life 
expectancy. These data demonstrate there are opportunities to improve the 
quality of prognosis disclosure between patients with advanced HF and their 
physicians. Interventions to improve PPPC might include serious illness 
communication training.

OBJECTIVE: Greater population life expectancy and consistent improvement in 
diagnostic techniques have increased the diagnosis of abdominal aortic aneurysms 
(AAAs) in the elderly population. The aim was to study the natural history of 
small (< 55 mm) incidental AAAs in octogenarian and nonagenarian patients to 
assess the need for follow up and/or invasive treatment.
METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of a prospective registry. Patients ≥ 
80 years old at the time of diagnosis of a < 55 mm AAA in 1988-2018 were 
selected. Clinical and anatomical characteristics were registered. Patients were 
divided in three groups: 30 - 39 mm, 40 - 49 mm, and 50 - 54 mm AAA. The outcome 
variables were aorto-iliac rupture, AAA reaching a surgical threshold (≥ 55 mm), 
and death. A descriptive statistical analysis was performed and life tables, 
Kaplan-Meier curves, and uni- and multivariable Cox regression were used.
RESULTS: Three hundred and ten patients were included, 256 (82.6%) men, with 
mean index age of 84.5 years (standard deviation [SD] 3.5), and median follow up 
of 37.9 months (interquartile range [IQR] 18.2 - 65.4). Eighteen (5.8%) AAAs 
ruptured; four of these patients were operated on and only one survived. 
Sixty-two (20%) AAA reached a surgical size; eight were repaired electively, 
with 0% early mortality. The survival rates were 81%, 70%, and 38% at one, two, 
and five years. The rupture rates were 1%, 2%, and 6% and the AAAs reaching 
surgical threshold were 1%, 4%, and 19% for the same time periods. AAA size < 40 
mm was an independent protective factor from rupture (0.13; 95% confidence 
interval [CI] 0.03 - 0.48), reaching surgical threshold (0.08; 95% CI 0.04 - 
0.16) and death (0.63; 95% CI 0.42 - 0.95).
CONCLUSION: The risk of late rupture of small incidental AAA diagnosed in 
octogenarian and nonagenarian patients is very small, especially when the AAA is 
< 40 mm in diameter. In contrast, global mortality is high. Conservative 
management seems sensible, with strict selection of the patients who would 
benefit from follow up and eventual repair.

BACKGROUND: We propose a modified quality-adjusted life year (QALY) calculation 
that aims to be consistent with guidance for interpreting change in 
patient-reported outcomes. This calculation incorporates the minimally important 
difference (MID) in generic preference-based health-related quality of life 
(HRQL) change scores to reflect what might be considered meaningful HRQL 
improvement/deterioration. In doing so, we review common issues in QALY 
calculations such as adjustment for baseline scores and standardizing for 
between-group differences.
METHODS: Using EQ-5D-5L outcome data from the Alberta TEAMCare-Primary Care 
Network trial in the management of depression for patients with type 2 diabetes 
(n = 98), this study compared results from different QALY calculation methods to 
investigate the impact of (i) adjusting for baseline HRQL score, (ii) 
standardizing between-group differences at baseline, and (iii) adjusting for 
'meaningful' HRQL changes. The following QALY calculation methods are examined: 
area under curve (QALY-AUC), change from baseline (QALY-CFB), regression 
modelling (QALY-R), and incorporating an MID for HRQL changes from baseline 
(QALY-MID).
RESULTS: The incremental QALY-AUC estimate favoured the Collaborative Care group 
(0.031) while the incremental QALY-CFB (-0.028) estimate favoured Enhanced Care. 
Adjusting for meaningful HRQL changes resulted in a crude incremental QALY-MID 
of -0.023; however, after adjusting for between-group differences at baseline, 
QALY-R and adjusted incremental QALY-MID estimates were -0.007 and -0.001, 
respectively. In addition, recursive regression analyses showed that very low 
baseline HRQL scores impact incremental QALY estimates.
CONCLUSIONS: Uncertainty in incremental QALY estimates reflects uncertainty in 
the value of small within-individual change as well as the impact of small 
differences between groups at baseline. Applying a responder-definition approach 
yielded crude and adjusted QALY-MID estimates that were more in favour of 
Collaborative Care than QALY-CFB and QALY-R estimates, respectively, suggesting 
that ambiguous small changes in HRQL scores have the potential to influence QALY 
outcomes used in economic or non-economic applications.

INTRODUCTION: To compare the cost-effectiveness of vedolizumab with that of 
conventional therapy in patients with moderate-to-severe active Crohn's disease 
(CD) in China.
METHODS: A decision tree and Markov model were built to predict the lifetime 
cost and health outcomes in the induction phase and maintenance phase of 
vedolizumab treatment and conventional therapy (a combination of 
corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, and aminosalicylates) in adult patients 
with moderate-to-severe active CD from the perspective of China's healthcare 
system. Clinical efficacy and health utility were derived from the GEMINI 2 and 
GEMINI 3 trials and published literature. Costs were mainly obtained from 
clinical physician surveys in China and are presented in 2020 US dollars. Health 
outcomes (quality-adjusted life years, QALYs) and costs were discounted at an 
annual rate of 5%. The incremental cost per QALY gained was used to compare the 
cost-effectiveness of the two treatments. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity 
analyses (PSAs) were performed to test the robustness of the model.
RESULTS: The model predicted more QALYs (9.92 vs 9.00 QALYs) and lower incurred 
costs ($288,284 vs $309,680) in vedolizumab than in conventional therapy in a 
mixed population (anti-TNF-naïve and anti-TNF-failure populations) over a 
lifetime horizon in the base-case analysis. Similar results were observed in the 
anti-TNF-naïve and anti-TNF-failure subgroups of patients with CD. One-way 
sensitivity analysis results suggested that health state cost was the most 
influential factor in the model. The PSA results supported the dominance of 
vedolizumab in the base-case analysis.
CONCLUSION: Vedolizumab appears to be a cost-effective strategy option in the 
treatment of adult patients with moderate-to-severe active CD in China in both 
anti-TNF-naïve and anti-TNF-failure populations.

BACKGROUND: Randomised clinical trials (RCTs) conducted in intensive care units 
(ICUs) frequently focus on all-cause mortality, but other patient-important 
outcomes are increasingly used and recommended. Their use, however, is not 
straightforward: choices and definitions, operationalisation of death, handling 
of missing data, choice of effect measures, and statistical analyses for these 
outcomes vary greatly.
METHODS: We will conduct a scoping review in accordance with the Preferred 
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping 
Reviews. We will search 10 selected general and speciality journals for RCTs 
conducted in adult ICU patients from 2018 and onwards reporting at least 1 
patient-important outcome other than mortality (including days alive without 
life support/days alive and out of hospital-type outcomes, health-related 
quality of life, functional/cognitive/neurological outcomes, and other general 
patient-important outcomes). We will summarise data on outcome measures and 
definitions, assessment time points, proportions and handling of death, 
proportions and handling of missing data, and effect measures and statistical 
methods used for analysis.
DISCUSSION: The outlined scoping review will provide an overview of choices, 
definitions and handling of patient-important outcomes other than mortality in 
contemporary RCTs conducted in adult ICU patients. This may guide discussions 
with patients and relatives, the design of future RCTs, and research on optimal 
outcome choices and handling.

The duality of risk from threats: Are homicidal threats a novel determinant for 
suicide risk?

Suicide and homicide have long been considered to sit at opposing ends of a 
continuum of deliberate harm, initially emerging as separate fields of practice. 
While it is now accepted that suicide and homicide are associated, the evidence 
base for how they are associated is far from complete. Surfacing from this body 
of knowledge are questions of clinical and ethical responsibilities, such as 
assessors of risk to moving to a default position of evaluating risk to self and 
others, regardless of which is the presenting problem. The current study 
examined longitudinal suicide risk among those known to have uttered homicidal 
threats. 757 threateners, known to the health and/or criminal justice systems 
for threatening to kill a person other than themselves, were examined via case 
matching methodology to reveal deaths recorded in a national coronial database. 
Over the follow up period, 11% of the threateners died, and over half of them 
(57.5%) perished from suicide. Threateners who died lost on average 47 years of 
potential life. That is, they lost more than half their life when compared to 
the average life expectancy of Australians. Further offending was also 
associated with higher mortality as was having a history of mental health 
treatment. This study provides support for the duality of risk from uttered 
threats as threatening homicide was found to be a novel predictor of suicide 
risk.
