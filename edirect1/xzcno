impact of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is significant with a 
prevalence of up to 50%. The pathogenesis of NAFLD and the reasons for 
progression to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) are still not fully 
elucidated, but insulin resistance, mitochondrial dysfunction and dyslipidemia 
seem to be the main drivers. Both HIV-infection itself and combination 
antiretroviral therapy (cART) can contribute to the development of NAFLD/NASH in 
various ways. As ongoing HIV-related immune activation is associated with 
insulin resistance, early initiation of cART is needed to limit its duration. In 
addition, the use of early-generation nucleoside reverse transcriptase 
inhibitors and protease inhibitors is also associated with the development of 
NAFLD/NASH. Patients at risk should therefore receive antiretroviral drugs with 
a more favorable metabolic profile. Only weight reduction is considered to be an 
effective therapy for all patients with NAFLD/NASH, although certain drugs are 
available for specific subgroups. Since patients with NASH are at risk of 
developing liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, several 
non-antifibrotic and antifibrotic drugs are under investigation in clinical 
trials to broaden the therapeutic options. The epidemiology and etiology of 
NAFLD/NASH in HIV-positive patients is likely to change in the near future. 
Current guidelines recommend early initiation of cART that is less likely to 
induce insulin resistance, mitochondrial dysfunction and dyslipidemia. In 
contrast, as a result of increasing life expectancy in good health, this 
population will adopt the more traditional risk factors for NAFLD/NASH. 
HIV-treating physicians should be aware of the etiology, pathogenesis and 
treatment of NAFLD/NASH in order to identify and treat the patients at risk.

Saint-Etienne, France.

RATIONALE: Neonatal infectious endocarditis (IE) in a healthy heart is rare. The 
infectious agents most frequently found in newborns are Staphylococcus aureus 
and fungi. Infection at the site of central intravenous catheter is generally 
thought to be the cause of this pathology.
PATIENT CONCERNS: We present 2 cases of premature newborns whose condition is 
evolving positively. They presented S aureus endocarditis during their first 
week of life.
DIAGNOSIS: Modified Duke diagnostic criteria-from clinical, echocardiogram and 
microbiological findings-based on those used for adults, can be used for 
children and newborns, but the very low prevalence of neonatal IE often delays 
diagnosis. Diagnosis on the basis of transthoracic heart ultrasound requires an 
extension report, given the very high embolic risk.
INTERVENTION: In the large majority of cases, long-term antibiotic therapy 
efficaciously treats the infection, although sometimes surgery is necessary. 
These 2 newborns needed only antibiotic therapy.
OUTCOME: Despite the various complications, especially embolic, these 2 children 
are followed and are doing well.
LESSONS: Long-term pediatric heart monitoring combined with prophylactic 
antibiotics are essential, according to the European Society of Cardiology 
guidelines.

Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China.

BACKGROUND: Adjuvanted herpes zoster (HZ) subunit (HZ/su) vaccine is recommended 
for healthy adults aged ≥50 years, yet vaccine efficacy is expected to wane over 
time. Age-sex specific cost-effectiveness analyses of HZ/su vaccine are 
warranted to inform decision-making on vaccine policy. We aimed to determine the 
optimal gender-specific age for cost-effective HZ/su vaccination in Hong Kong.
METHODS: A Markov model was used to compare outcomes with and without HZ/su in 
healthy males and females at age 50-80 years. Model outcome measures were total 
cost, HZ cases, and HZ-associated quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) loss. 
Incremental cost per QALY saved (ICER) by HZ/su was estimated for each age-sex 
group. Sensitivity analyses were performed to examine robustness of model 
results.
RESULTS: HZ/su reduced incidence of HZ in both males and females aged 50-80 
years and the numbers needed to vaccinate to avoid one HZ case were lowest at 
age 60 years for males (6.05) and females (5.50). The highest QALY-saved 
occurred in females (0.00396 QALYs) and males (0.00379 QALYs) who were 
vaccinated at 60 years old. The ICERs were lowest at age 60-70 years for both 
genders. Using 1× gross domestic product per capita of Hong Kong (USD46,153) as 
willingness-to-pay threshold, HZ/su vaccine was accepted to be cost-effective 
for all female and male age groups at vaccine cost = USD160, for female aged 
50-79 years and male aged 54-74 years at vaccine cost = USD200, and for female 
aged 59-71 years at vaccine cost = USD240.
CONCLUSIONS: HZ/su vaccine is more likely to be cost-effective for males and 
females aged between 60-70 years than the extreme age groups (less than 60 years 
and older than 70 years) in Hong Kong. The age range for cost-effective 
acceptance of HZ/su vaccine appears to be broader in females than males given 
the same vaccine cost and willingness-to-pay threshold.

OBJECTIVES: The primary objective of the review was to describe change that 
occurs in skeletal muscle during periods of unplanned hospitalisation in adult 
patients. The secondary objective was to examine the relationship between both 
physical activity and inflammation with the change in skeletal muscle. A further 
objective was to investigate the effect of interventions on change in skeletal 
muscle during periods of unplanned hospitalisation.
DESIGN: A systematic review and meta-analyses. Embase, MEDLINE, CINAHL, AMED, 
PEDro and the Cochrane Library were searched for studies that included any 
measures of skeletal muscle (excluding pulmonary function) at two time points 
during unplanned hospitalisation. Studies that were set in critical care, or 
included patients with acute or progressive neurological illness, were excluded.
RESULTS: Our search returned 27,809 unique articles, of which 35 met the 
inclusion criteria. Meta-analyses of change between baseline and follow-up in 
random effects models suggested that grip strength had an average increase: 
standardised mean difference (SMD) = 0.10 (95% CI: 0.03; 0.16); knee extension 
strength had an average reduction: SMD = -0.24 (95% CI: -0.33; -0.14); and 
mid-arm muscle circumference had an average reduction: SMD = -0.17 (95% CI: 
-0.22; -0.11). Inflammation appeared to be associated with greater loss of 
muscle strength. There was inconclusive evidence that the level of physical 
activity affects change in skeletal muscle. In regard to the effect of 
interventions, only exercise interventions were consistently associated with 
improved skeletal muscle outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: Adult patients who undergo an unplanned hospital admission may 
experience a small reduction in knee extension strength and mid-arm muscle mass. 
Prospective research is needed to clarify the contribution of confounding 
factors underlying the observations made in this review, with particular 
attention to levels of physical activity, and possible contributions from 
environmental factors and processes of hospital care.

Public Health and Preventive Medicine, Monash University, Australia.

BACKGROUND: The loss of productivity arising from tobacco use in 
low/middle-income countries has not been well described. We sought to examine 
the impact of cigarette smoking on population health and work productivity in 
Malaysia using a recently published measure, the productivity-adjusted life year 
(PALY).
METHODS: A life table model was constructed using published Malaysian 
demographic and mortality data. Our analysis was limited to male smokers due to 
the low smoking prevalence in females (1.1%). Male smokers aged 15-64 years were 
followed up until 65 years or until death. The population attributable risk, 
health-related quality of life decrements and relative reduction in productivity 
due to smoking were sourced from published data. The analysis was repeated 
assuming the cohorts were never smokers, and the differences in outcomes 
represented the health and productivity burden conferred by smoking. The cost of 
productivity loss was estimated based on the gross domestic product per 
equivalent full-time worker in Malaysia.
RESULTS: Tobacco use is highly prevalent among working-age males in Malaysia, 
with 4.2 million (37.5%) daily smokers among men aged between 15 and 64 years. 
Overall, our model estimated that smoking resulted in the loss of over 
2.1 million life years (2.9%), 5.5 million (8.2%) quality-adjusted life years 
(QALYs) and 3.0 million (4.8%) PALYs. Smoking was estimated to incur 
RM275.3 billion (US$69.4 billion) in loss of productivity.
CONCLUSION: Tobacco use imposes a significant public health and economic burden 
among working-age males in Malaysia. This study highlights the need of effective 
public health interventions to reduce tobacco use.

Cost-effectiveness of implementing guidelines for the treatment of 
glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis in Japan.

A model-based cost-effectiveness analysis was performed to evaluate the 
cost-effectiveness of implementing the clinical guideline for the treatment for 
glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis (GIO). The treatment indication for GIO in 
the current Japanese clinical guidelines is likely to be cost-effective except 
for the limited patients who are at low risk for fracture.
INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness 
of implementing the clinical guideline for the treatment for 
glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis (GIO) from the perspective of the Japanese 
healthcare system.
METHODS: A patient-level state transition model was developed to predict 
lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) in postmenopausal 
Japanese women with osteopenia or osteoporosis using glucocorticoid (GC). An 
annual discount rate of 2% for both costs and QALYs was applied. The incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of 5-year alendronate therapy compared with no 
therapy was estimated with different combinations of the risk factors such as 
starting age (45, 55, or 65), femoral neck BMD (% young adult mean (YAM) of 70%, 
75%, or 80%), dose of GC (2.5, 5, or 10 mg per day), and the presence of 
previous fracture (yes or no).
RESULTS: For 55-year-old women using GC with a BMD of 75% of YAM, the ICER 
ranged from $10,958 to $ 29,727 per QALY. Scenario analyses indicated that the 
lower age, the lower BMD, the higher dose of GC, and the presence of previous 
fracture associated with lower ICER. The best-case scenario was 45-year-old 
women with a BMD of 70% of YAM, GC dose of 10 mg per day, and previous fracture, 
and resulted in healthcare cost-savings. The worst-case scenario was 65-year-old 
women with a BMD of 80% of YAM, GC dose of 2.5 mg per day, and no previous 
fracture, and resulted in the ICER of $66,791 per QALY. Sensitivity analyses in 
the worst-case scenario showed that the annual discount rate for costs and 
health benefit had the strong influence on the estimated ICER. Although the ICER 
was influenced by other parameters such as disutility due to vertebral fracture, 
efficacy of alendronate, and so on, the ICERs remained more than $50,000 per 
QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: The cost-effectiveness of preventive alendronate therapy for 
postmenopausal women with osteopenia or osteoporosis using GC is sensitive to 
age, BMD, GC dose, and the presence of previous fracture. Our analysis suggested 
that the treatment indication for postmenopausal women with osteopenia or 
osteoporosis using GC in the current Japanese clinical guidelines is likely to 
be cost-effective except for the limited patients who are at low risk for 
fracture.

A package was created that extends apple shelf-life by slowing Penicillium 
expansum growth. The package consisted of a peelable lid and a tray with a 
double bottom with inclusion complexes (ICs) of ß-cyclodextrin (ß-CD) containing 
the essential oils of palmarosa (ICp) or of star anise (ICsa). Oil amounts 
required for antimicrobial activity were obtained from in vitro assays. After 
12 days at 23 °C, P. expansum-inoculated apples in both of the double-bottom 
antimicrobial packages (DBAP) had 1/3 less fungal growth, less than 50% weight 
loss and ethylene and CO2 production, and less than 25% firmness loss, TA and 
SSC increase, and pH decrease compared to controls. The DBAP with ICsa performed 
better than with ICp in reducing ethylene production, respiration rate, firmness 
loss, TA increase, and pH decrease. This demonstrates DBAP containing ICp or 
ICsa can maximize the shelf-life of apples injured by P. expansum, validating a 
novel type of antimicrobial packaging.

Alzheimer's disease is the most frequent cause of dementia worldwide, 
representing a global health challenge, with a massive impact on the quality of 
life of Alzheimer's disease patients and their relatives. The diagnosis of 
Alzheimer's disease constitutes a real challenge, because the symptoms manifest 
years after the first degenerative changes occurring in the brain and the 
diagnosis is based on invasive and/or expensive techniques. Therefore, there is 
an urgent need to identify new reliable biomarkers to detect Alzheimer's disease 
at an early stage. Taking into account the evidence for visual deficits in 
Alzheimer's disease patients, sometimes even before the appearance of the first 
disease symptoms, and that the retina is an extension of the brain, the concept 
of the retina as a window to look into the brain or a mirror of the brain has 
received increasing interest in recent years. However, only a few studies have 
assessed the changes occurring in the retina and the brain at the same time 
points. Unlike previous reviews on this subject, which are mainly focused on 
brain changes, we organized this review by comprehensively summarizing findings 
related with structural, functional, cellular, and molecular parameters in the 
retina reported in both Alzheimer's disease patients and animal models. 
Moreover, we separated the studies that assessed only the retina, and those that 
assessed both the retina and brain, which are few but allow establishing 
correlations between the retina and brain. This review also highlights some 
inconsistent results in the literature as well as relevant missing gaps in this 
field.

Control of Cardiovascular Disease in the 20th Century: Meeting the Challenge of 
Chronic Degenerative Disease.

Cooper RS.

After World War II, industrialized countries found themselves faced with a new 
epidemic of chronic disease. Stroke had long been a common cause of death, 
however a much more virulent form of vascular disease involving the coronary 
arteries was now recognized as a major public health challenge. By the late 
1950s, cardiovascular diseases (CVD) accounted for almost two-thirds of deaths 
in the US. Within 10 years, the key causal factors underlying CVD had been fully 
defined, and by the mid-1960s, prevention trials, policy changes, and subsequent 
population-wide risk factor improvement and targeted high-risk medical therapy 
led to a rapid and sustained decline in both coronary heart disease (CHD) and 
stroke. By the turn of the century, CVD had declined over 80%, transforming 
health for adults and providing the main driver of lengthening life expectancy. 
This transformative process has now reached every country in the world. 
Epidemiologic, nutritional and clinical research, along with changes in social 
norms, public health education, smoke-free indoor air regulations, drug 
development, and clinical trials have led to the astounding success of the CVD 
control movement. The broad pattern pursued in the control of CVD provides a 
template for similar control efforts aimed at cancer, diabetes, renal disease, 
and other common chronic diseases.

The Mist Tent: An Analysis of Therapeutic Change in the History of Cystic 
Fibrosis Care.

Labonte ML.

Mist tent therapy for cystic fibrosis went through a rise and fall in popularity 
between the 1950s and 1970s, providing an opportunity to explore the nature of 
therapeutic change in medicine. The therapy "worked" in the context of a 
particularly grim life expectancy in the early 1950s and in the setting of a 
comprehensive therapeutic program that began in Cleveland in 1957. Although 
clinical studies published in the 1970s provided evidence that mist tents were 
ineffective or even harmful, these later studies were not necessarily more 
robust than earlier studies that provided evidence of mist tent efficacy, 
suggesting that other factors may have also contributed to mist tent 
abandonment. In fact, the unpalatable nature of mist tent therapy, which was 
described by one doctor as akin to incarceration, and studies that questioned 
the theoretical underpinnings of the therapy also played important roles in the 
eventual abandonment of mist tents.

In this study, we evaluated the effect of the herbicide propyl 
4-(2-(4,6-dimethoxypyrimidin-2-yloxy)benzylamino) benzoate (ZJ0273) on barley 
growth and explored the potential to trigger growth recovery through the 
application of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs). Barley plants were 
foliar-sprayed with various concentrations of ZJ0273 (100, 500, or 1000 mg/L) at 
the four-leaf stage. Increasing either the herbicide concentration or 
measurement time after herbicide treatment significantly impaired plant 
morphological parameters such as plant height and biomass, and affected 
physiological indexes, i.e. maximal photochemical efficiency (Fv/Fm), quantum 
yield of photosystem II (ФPSII), net photosynthetic rate (Pn), and chlorophyll 
meter value (soil and plant analyzer development (SPAD)). Cellular injury of 
herbicide-treated plants was also evidenced by increased levels of reactive 
oxygen species (ROS) and antioxidative enzyme activity. Elevated levels of 
herbicide significantly reduced the activity of acetolactate synthase (ALS)-a 
key enzyme in the biosynthesis of BCAAs. In a separate experiment, growth 
recovery in herbicide-stressed barley plants was studied using various 
concentrations of BCAAs (10, 50, 100, and 200 mg/L). Increasing BCAA 
concentration in growth media significantly increased the biomass of 
herbicide-stressed barley seedlings, but had no significant effect on 
non-stressed plants. Further, BCAAs (100 mg/L) significantly down-regulated ROS 
and consequently antioxidant enzyme levels in herbicide-stressed plants. Our 
results showed that exogenous application of BCAAs could reverse the inhibitory 
effects of ZJ0273 by restoring protein biosynthesis in barley seedlings.

Use of Late-Life Expectancy for Assessing the Long-Term Benefit of Immune 
Checkpoint Inhibitors.

To grade the long-term benefit of anticancer agents, the American Society of 
Clinical Oncology Value Framework (ASCO-VF) awards tail-of-the-curve bonus 
points by using milestone survival at twice the median control survival. Here, 
we propose an alternative, late-life expectancy that we defined as the area 
under the Kaplan-Meier curve from median control survival to the end of 
follow-up. We analyzed all indications of immune checkpoint inhibitors with 
survival data and found that 9 indications out of 13 (69.2%) qualified for 
ASCO-VF tail-of-the-curve bonus points either in progression-free or overall 
survival. Our proposed score recognized a long-term benefit not captured by the 
ASCO-VF, for example, for CHECKMATE-66 where twice the median overall survival 
was not reached. We found that nivolumab was associated with an increase of 
65.3% (95% CI = 38.9 to 89.5) in overall survival late-life expectancy, which 
highlights its important long-term benefit. In conclusion, the ASCO-VF could be 
improved with the use of late-life expectancy.

Because an intervention's clinical benefit depends on who receives it, a key to 
improving the efficiency of lung cancer screening with low-dose computed 
tomography (LDCT) is to incentivize its use among the current or former smokers 
who are most likely to benefit from it. Despite its clinical advantages and 
cost-effectiveness, only 3.9 percent of the eligible population underwent LDCT 
screening in 2015. Using individual lung cancer mortality risk, we developed a 
policy simulation model to explore the potential impact of implementing 
risk-targeted incentive programs, compared to either implementing untargeted 
incentive programs or doing nothing. We found that compared to the status quo, 
an untargeted incentive program that increased overall LDCT screening from 3,900 
(baseline) to 10,000 per 100,000 eligible people would save 12,300 life-years 
and accrue a net monetary benefit (NMB) of $771 million over a lifetime horizon. 
Increasing screening by the same amount but targeting higher-risk people would 
yield an additional 2,470-6,600 life-years and an additional $210-$560 million 
NMB, depending on the extent of the risk-targeting. Risk-targeted incentive 
programs could include provider-level bonuses, health plan premium subsidies, 
and smoking cessation programs to maximize their impact. As clinical medicine 
becomes more personalized, targeting and incentivizing higher-risk people will 
help enhance population health and economic efficiency.

    Ann Intern Med. 2019 Feb 5;170(3):203-204.

BACKGROUND: In 2016, universal individual donation nucleic acid testing (ID-NAT) 
of donated blood for Zika virus began in U.S. states and territories.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of universal ID-NAT in the first 
year of screening compared with alternatives for the 50 states and separately 
for Puerto Rico.
DESIGN: Microsimulation that captured Zika-related harms to transfusion 
recipients, sexual partners, and their infants.
DATA SOURCES: National testing results compiled by AABB and costs, utilities, 
and outcome probabilities estimated from the literature.
TARGET POPULATION: Transfusion recipients.
TIME HORIZON: Lifetime.
PERSPECTIVE: Societal.
INTERVENTION: Universal ID-NAT, universal mini-pool NAT (MP-NAT), and ID-NAT 
exclusively for components transfused to women of childbearing age. Seasonally 
targeted strategies in Puerto Rico and geographically targeted strategies in the 
50 states were also considered.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and outcomes.
RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: In Puerto Rico, MP-NAT exclusively during high 
mosquito season was cost-effective at $81 123 per QALY (95% CI, -$49 138 to 
$978 242 per QALY). No screening policy was cost-effective in the 50 states. 
Universal ID-NAT cost $341 million per QALY (CI, $125 million to $2.90 billion 
per QALY) compared with no screening in the 50 states.
RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: In Puerto Rico, MP-NAT only during the season 
of high mosquito activity was most cost-effective in 64% of probabilistic 
sensitivity analysis iterations. In the 50 states, no intervention was 
cost-effective in 99.99% of iterations. Cost-effectiveness was highly dependent 
on the rate of assumed infectious donations.
LIMITATION: Data were limited on the component-specific transmissibility of Zika 
and long-term sequelae of infection.
CONCLUSION: Screening was cost-effective only in the high mosquito season in 
Puerto Rico, and no evaluated screening policy was cost-effective in the 50 
states. During periods with lower rates of Zika-infectious donations, the 
cost-effectiveness of screening will be even less favorable.

Rolling circle amplification (RCA) is an elegant and well-recognized isothermal 
nucleic acid amplification mechanism that has been widely used for the detection 
of various kinds of genetic biomarkers. However, traditional RCA is a linear 
signal amplifying mechanism so that the amplification efficiency is generally 
not satisfactory. Herein, we rationally combine RCA with efficient loop-mediated 
isothermal amplification (LAMP) to establish a rapid and ultrasensitive RCA-LAMP 
method for the detection of microRNAs (miRNAs). In the RCA-LAMP, the target 
let-7a miRNA can directly template the ligation of a padlock probe to trigger 
RCA reaction, producing long and tandem amplification products. Only such 
RCA-produced long DNA repeats can act as the template to generate a lot of 
double stem-loop DNAs with functional sequences, which are the essential 
starting materials to initiate subsequent LAMP. Finally, the products of LAMP 
reaction, the amount of which is dependent on the initial miRNA dosage, can be 
fluorescently monitored in a real-time manner. Through the combination of 
ligation-mediated RCA with LAMP, the amplification efficiency and the detection 
sensitivity has been significantly improved. As a result, even 10 aM miRNA 
target can be clearly and accurately detectable. Despite the excellent 
analytical performance for miRNA analysis, compared with conventional RCA-based 
miRNA assays, the combination of RCA with LAMP does not introduce any additional 
reaction steps or sample transfer operations. Both the RCA and LAMP are 
fulfilled in a single step. Therefore, this facile and ultrasensitive RCA-LAMP 
assay provides a new promising tool for miRNA analysis and can be extended to 
the detection of various kinds of genetic biomarkers.

Disparities in chronic disease and life expectancy remain a significant public 
health problem and are largely attributable to social determinants of health. 
Community health workers (CHWs) promote health equity through individual- and 
community-level activities, and leadership and advocacy skills training make 
CHWs more likely to catalyze structural change. CHWs are increasingly being 
integrated into clinical practices to support care management, creating a need 
for new grassroots community-level advocates. We adapted for community residents 
an existing CHW training curriculum focused on social determinants of health and 
effecting community change. We offered 36 hours of training at community-based 
locations in New Orleans, Louisiana. We assessed baseline civic and community 
participation and pre- and postknowledge for each lesson. Among 43 enrollees, 42 
completed the program. The majority were Black (92.7%), female (92.7%), and 
retired or unemployed (77.5%), with a median age of 61.5 years. In the past 
year, 85% of participants had volunteered, 57.1% had been involved with a 
community organization, and 32.4% had contacted the city council. Participants 
demonstrated statistically significant increases in knowledge in 5 of 6 lessons. 
Our success in increasing knowledge of advocacy among a civically engaged group 
suggests that trainees may become community leaders in addressing social 
determinants of health.

Hung Hom, Hong Kong.

Purpose: To identify the existing evidence evaluating the cost-effectiveness of 
physiotherapy treatments for people with neurological disorders.Methods: 
Multiple databases were searched from database inception until July 2018. 
Studies estimating the cost-effectiveness as incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratios, cost per quality-adjusted life year, cost per disability-adjusted life 
year and cost per other measurable results were included. Physiotherapy Evidence 
Database scale, and Consensus on Health Economic Criteria list were used for 
rating the quality of the evidence.Results: Ten studies involving 1462 
participants were included. Aerobic training, progressive strength training, and 
a pragmatic physiotherapy program (combination of stretching, strength, and 
balance training) were reported as potentially cost-effective for older adults 
with vascular cognitive impairment, falls prevention in Parkinson's disease and 
multiple sclerosis respectively. Physiotherapy as an adjuvant for pain control 
was also reported as cost-effective for reflex sympathetic dystrophy. One study 
testing extra physiotherapy-by-physiotherapy assistant in cerebral palsy and two 
studies testing extra therapy using a robotic arm and Wii therapy for hand 
rehabilitation in stroke were reported as not cost-effective.Conclusions: There 
are limited studies that have evaluated the cost-effectiveness of physiotherapy 
treatments in neurological disorders. Three studies that combined extra 
physiotherapy-by-physiotherapy assistant and novel interventions with 
conventional physiotherapy were found not cost-effective.Implications for 
RehabilitationProgressive muscle strengthening exercise over a period of 6-month 
is reported to be cost-effective for falls prevention in people with Parkinson's 
diseaseAerobic training is reported as potentially cost-effective for older 
adults with vascular cognitive impairmentPhysiotherapy given as an adjuvant 
treatment is reported to be potentially cost-effective for reflex sympathetic 
dystrophy of less than 1-year durationOne study reported physiotherapy involving 
static stretching, aerobic exercise, strengthening exercise, and balance 
training as cost-effective for people with multiple sclerosisAdditional 
physiotherapy-by-physiotherapy assistant or family member for improving motor 
development in cerebral palsy and the use of novel physiotherapy techniques such 
as robotics or Wii plus conventional physiotherapy for improving arm function in 
stroke are found not cost-effectiveGroup therapy for improving physical activity 
in mild Alzheimer's disease is found not cost-effective.

Revisiting the Income Inequality Hypothesis With 292 OECD Regional Units.

Kim KT(1).

Author information:
(1)1 Department of Social Welfare, Soongsil University, Seoul, Republic of 
Korea.

The income inequality hypothesis on the relationship between income inequality 
and population health has been debated for decades Disagreement exists on the 
hypothesis because empirical findings have reached inconsistent conclusions. At 
the cross-national level, the limited number of industrialized nations has 
created a chronic small-N problem for statistical analyses of the hypothesis. 
The OECD regional database containing statistics of hundreds of regional units 
can provide a breakthrough and is used for the first time for multiple 
regression in this article. It is found that income inequality is a 
statistically significant determinant of all the health indicators analysed. The 
findings support the income inequality hypothesis. In addition, the impact of 
income inequality seems to be stronger on infant mortality than on old-age 
mortality. GDP per capita also statistically significantly influences both life 
expectancy and old-age mortality but not infant mortality.

Rapid advance in oncology leads to increasing survival of oncologic patients. 
More and more of them live long enough to reach either the natural age of 
menopause or, as a side effect of their oncotherapy, experience the cessation of 
gonadal function, leading to premature ovarian insufficiency, with disturbing 
vasomotor symtoms and long-term negative cardiovascular and skeletal effects. 
Thus, an ever increasing number of cancer survivors search endocrinologic help 
in the form of hormone replacement therapy (HRT). The misinterpretation of the 
WHI (Women's Health Initiative) Study has lead to an irrational fear of female 
hormone replacement, both by the general population and medical professionals. 
It has seemed the logical and safe conclusion to many physicians to avoid HRT, 
supposing that this attitude definitely causes no harm, whereas the decision of 
prescribing estrogen alone or with progestins might bear oncologic and 
thromboembolic risks and may even lead to litigation in case of a potentially 
related complication. However, it was known even before the WHI results that 
premature menopause and hypogonadism decreases the life expectancy of women by 
years through its skeletal and cardiovascular effects, and this negative effect 
correlates with the length of the hypoestrogenaemic period. Therefore, the 
denial of HRT also needs to be supported by evidence and should be weighed 
againts the risks of HRT. Yet, the oncologic risk of HRT is extremely difficult 
to assess. In this work we review the latest evidence from in vitro experiments 
to clinical studies, regarding HRT in survivors of gynecologic and 
non-gynecologic cancers. Based on our literature research, we group tumours 
regarding the oncologic risk of properly chosen female hormone replacement 
therapy in cancer survivors as follows: 'HRT is advanageous' (e.g. endometrial 
cancer type I, cervical adenocarcinoma, haematologic malignancies, local 
cutaneous malignant melanoma, colorectal cancer, hepatocellular cancer); 'HRT is 
neutral' (e.g. BRCA 1/2 mutation carriers without cancer, endometrial cancer 
type II, uterinal carcinosarcoma and adenosarcoma, certain types of ovarian 
cancer, cervical, vaginal and vulvar squamous cell carcinoma, prolactinoma, 
kidney cancer, pancreatic cancer, thyroid cancer); 'HRT is relatively 
contraindicated' for various reasons (e.g. leiomyosarcoma, certain types of 
ovarian tumours, brain tumours, advanced metastatic malignant melanoma, lung 
cancer, gastric cancer, bladder cancer); 'HRT is diasadvantageous and thus 
contraindicated' (e.g. breast cancer, endometrial stroma sarcoma, meningioma, 
glioma, hormone receptor positive gastric and bladder cancer).

It was reported that the highly conserved C-terminal region of Bacillus 
thuringiensis Cry1A protoxins was very important for parasporal crystal 
formation and solubility feature in alkaline environment. In order to improve 
the solubilization efficiency of Cry2Aa crystal, the coding sequences of Cry2Aa 
protein and the C-terminal half of Cry1Ac were fused seamlessly through Red/ET 
homologous recombination and expressed in an acrystalliferous B. thuringiensis 
strain under the control of the cry1Ac promoter and terminator. Microscopic 
observation revealed that the recombinant strain containing the chimeric gene 
cry2Aa-1Ac produced distinct parasporal inclusion with semispherical to 
approximately cuboidal shape during sporulation. SDS-PAGE analysis showed that 
this strain expressed stable 130-kDa Cry2Aa-1Ac chimeric protein, which was 
confirmed to be the correctly expressed product by LC-MS/MS. The chimeric 
protein inclusion could be effectively dissolved at pH 10.5 and activated by 
trypsin like the parental Cry1Ac crystal. While, the parental Cry2Aa crystal 
exhibited very low solubility under this condition. Bioassays against 
third-instar larvae of Helicoverpa armigera proved that the chimeric protein was 
more toxic than Cry2Aa. Additionally, synergistic effect was clearly detected 
between the chimeric protein and Cry1Ac against H. armigera, while there was 
only additive effect for the combination of wild Cry2Aa and Cry1Ac. These 
results indicated that the developed chimeric protein might serve as a potent 
insecticidal toxin used in the field against lepidopteran pests.

PURPOSE: Germline mutations in BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 genes (gBRCA1/2m) are 
associated with an increased risk of breast cancer (BC) and ovarian cancer (OC). 
The aim of this study was to estimate the efficiency of providing germline 
BRCA1/2 testing to high-grade epithelial ovarian cancer (HGEOC) patients without 
family history of OC or BC and the subsequent testing and management of their 
relatives with gBRCA1/2m in Spain.
METHODS/PATIENTS: Incident HGEOC patients without family history of OC or BC who 
were gBRCA1/2m carriers and their relatives were simulated in a 50-year time 
horizon. The study compared two scenarios: BRCA1/2 testing vs no testing, using 
the perspective of the Spanish National Health Service. Cancer risk among 
gBRCA1/2m carriers was estimated based on their age and whether they had 
undergone risk-reducing surgeries. Direct healthcare costs and utilities of 
patients who developed EOC and BC were also included. A probabilistic 
sensitivity analysis (PSA) with 5 thousand simulations was developed 
considering ± 25% of the base-case value.
RESULTS: The BRCA1/2-testing scenario amounted to €13,437,897.43 while the 
no-testing scenario amounted to €12,053,291.17. It was estimated that the 
screening test improved the quality of life among the patients' relatives by 
43.8 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). The incremental cost-utility ratio 
(ICUR) was €31,621.33/QALY in the base case. The PSA showed that 89.12% of the 
simulations were below the €50,000/QALY threshold.
CONCLUSION: Providing this screening test to HGEOC patients and their relatives 
is cost-effective and it allows one to identify a target population with high 
risk of cancer to provide effective prevention strategies.

OBJECTIVE: Interpersonal relationships are important predictors of health 
outcomes and interpersonal influences on behaviours may be key mechanisms 
underlying such effects. Most health behaviour theories focus on intrapersonal 
factors and may not adequately account for interpersonal influences. We evaluate 
a dyadic extension of the Theory of Planned Behaviour by examining whether 
parent and adolescent characteristics (attitudes, subjective norms, perceived 
behavioural control and intentions) are associated with not only their own but 
also each other's intentions/behaviours.
DESIGN: Using the Actor-Partner Interdependence Model, we analyse responses from 
1717 parent-adolescent dyads from the Family Life, Activity, Sun, Health, and 
Eating study.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Adolescents/parents completed self-reports of their fruit 
and vegetable consumption, junk food and sugary drinks consumption, engagement 
in physical activity, and engagement in screen time sedentary behaviours.
RESULTS: Parent/adolescent characteristics are associated with each other's 
health-relevant intentions/behaviours above the effects of individuals' own 
characteristics on their own behaviours. Parent/adolescent characteristics 
covary with each other's outcomes with similar strength, but parent 
characteristics more strongly relate to adolescent intentions, whereas 
adolescent characteristics more strongly relate to parent behaviours.
CONCLUSIONS: Parents and adolescents may bidirectionally influence each other's 
health intentions/behaviours. This highlights the importance of dyadic models of 
health behaviour and suggests intervention targets.
