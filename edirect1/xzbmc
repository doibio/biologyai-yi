In the 1970s and 1980s the course of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) could be defined 
as fateful despite the introduction of methotrexate as well as other 
immunosuppressive treatments. In most patients at this time RA was combined with 
an early disability due a progressive destruction of joints. In addition, 
comorbidity was known to be one of the major causes for a decreased life 
expectancy. These less than optimal options for treating RA patients led to 
intensive research in the pathogenesis with the aim to develop new treatment 
principles. Based on the increasing knowledge of pathogenically important 
mechanisms, so-called biologicals were developed targeting T and B cells and 
proinflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor alpha. Over the past 10 
years the repertoire of biologicals for treating RA has steadily and 
significantly increased, which was necessary especially for those patients 
classified as non-responders to available biological compounds. In the present 
overview cellular structures, T and B cells as well as cells of the 
monocyte/macrophage system are discussed as targets for immune interventions.

BACKGROUND: The Cannabinoid Use in Progressive Inflammatory brain Disease 
(CUPID) trial aimed to determine whether or not oral Δ(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol 
(Δ(9)-THC) slowed the course of progressive multiple sclerosis (MS); evaluate 
safety of cannabinoid administration; and, improve methods for testing 
treatments in progressive MS.
OBJECTIVES: There were three objectives in the CUPID study: (1) to evaluate 
whether or not Δ(9)-THC could slow the course of progressive MS; (2) to assess 
the long-term safety of Δ(9)-THC; and (3) to explore newer ways of conducting 
clinical trials in progressive MS.
DESIGN: The CUPID trial was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
parallel-group, multicentre trial. Patients were randomised in a 2 : 1 ratio to 
Δ(9)-THC or placebo. Randomisation was balanced according to Expanded Disability 
Status Scale (EDSS) score, study site and disease type. Analyses were by 
intention to treat, following a pre-specified statistical analysis plan. A 
cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) substudy, Rasch measurement theory 
(RMT) analyses and an economic evaluation were undertaken.
SETTING: Twenty-seven UK sites.
PARTICIPANTS: Adults aged 18-65 years with primary or secondary progressive MS, 
1-year evidence of disease progression and baseline EDSS 4.0-6.5.
INTERVENTIONS: Oral Δ(9)-THC (maximum 28 mg/day) or matching placebo.
ASSESSMENT VISITS: Three and 6 months, and then 6-monthly up to 36 or 42 months.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcomes were time to EDSS progression, and 
change in Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale-29 version 2 (MSIS-29v2) 20-point 
physical subscale (MSIS-29phys) score. Various secondary patient- and 
clinician-reported outcomes and MRI outcomes were assessed. RMT analyses 
examined performance of MS-specific rating scales as measurement instruments and 
tested for a symptomatic or disease-modifying treatment effect. Economic 
evaluation estimated mean incremental costs and quality-adjusted life-years 
(QALYs).
RESULTS: Effectiveness - recruitment targets were achieved. Of the 498 
randomised patients (332 to active and 166 to placebo), 493 (329 active and 164 
placebo) were analysed.
PRIMARY OUTCOMES: no significant treatment effect; hazard ratio EDSS score 
progression (active : placebo) 0.92 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.68 to 1.23]; 
and estimated between-group difference in MSIS-29phys score (active-placebo) 
-0.9 points (95% CI -2.0 to 0.2 points). Secondary clinical and MRI outcomes: no 
significant treatment effects. Safety - at least one serious adverse event: 35% 
and 28% of active and placebo patients, respectively. RMT analyses - scale 
evaluation: MSIS-29 version 2, MS Walking Scale-12 version 2 and MS Spasticity 
Scale-88 were robust measurement instruments. There was no clear symptomatic or 
disease-modifying treatment effect. Economic evaluation - estimated mean 
incremental cost to NHS over usual care, over 3 years £27,443.20 per patient. No 
between-group difference in QALYs.
CONCLUSIONS: The CUPID trial failed to demonstrate a significant treatment 
effect in primary or secondary outcomes. There were no major safety concerns, 
but unwanted side effects seemed to affect compliance. Participants were more 
disabled than in previous studies and deteriorated less than expected, possibly 
reducing our ability to detect treatment effects. RMT analyses supported 
performance of MS-specific rating scales as measures, enabled group- and 
individual person-level examination of treatment effects, but did not influence 
study inferences. The intervention had significant additional costs with no 
improvement in health outcomes; therefore, it was dominated by usual care and 
not cost-effective. Future work should focus on determining further factors to 
predict clinical deterioration, to inform the development of new studies, and 
modifying treatments in order to minimise side effects and improve study 
compliance. The absence of disease-modifying treatments in progressive MS 
warrants further studies of the cannabinoid pathway in potential 
neuroprotection.

INTRODUCTION: The increasing life expectancy and the proportion of octogenarians 
make radical cystectomy (RC) more frequent in octogenarian patients with muscle 
invasive bladder cancer.
OBJECTIVE: To analyze overall survival and complications in our series.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Descriptive analysis of patients older than 80 years 
undergoing RC between 2000 and 2012. Surgical risk (American Society of 
Anesthesiologists scale, ASA), hospital stay, complications (Clavien-Dindo 
classification) and types of urinary diversion were evaluated. Variables were 
expressed in mean or medians. Overall survival was analyzed using the 
Kaplan-Meier method. Univariate overall survival analysis was performed using 
the univariate Cox regression model. The null hypothesis was rejected by a type 
I error <0.05. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 15.0 (SPSS Inc., 
Chicago, Ill., USA).
RESULTS: Thirty-three patients were included. Their mean age was 81.9 ± 1.8 
years. There were 24 males (72.7%). The surgical risk was identified as follows: 
ASA II in 9 patients (27.3%), ASA III in 23 (69.7%) and ASA IV in 1 (3%). 
Concerning urinary diversion, 19 patients (57.6%) underwent ureteroileostomy and 
14 (42.4%) bilateral cutaneous ureterostomy. Average hospital length of stay was 
19 days (14-30). TNM stage was T0 in 1 patient (3%), T1 in 4 (12.1%), T2 in 11 
(33.3%), T3 in 13 (39.4%), T4 in 4 (12.1%), Nx in 9 (12%), N0 in 13 (39.4%), N1 
in 3 (9.1%), and N2 in 5 (15.2%). The most frequent complications were pneumonia 
in 6 patients (18.2%) and surgical wound infection in 6 (18.2%). Lymphadenectomy 
did not involve a significant increase in complications. Six patients (18.2%) 
died in the immediate postoperative period, 5 of whom from respiratory 
complications. The mean survival of the rest of the series was 24 months (range 
15.1-32.8).
CONCLUSIONS: Overall assessment of the patient is essential and not only the 
chronological age. RC is a valid option despite chronological age. In the 
postoperative period, there is a higher risk of complications but not higher 
mortality due to surgical complications.

Given the increasing incidence of cancer and improved diagnostics and cancer 
treatments, the number of cancer patients in industrialized nations is 
increasing worldwide. Multimodal treatment regimens, which contribute to a 
tumor-free survival or extend patients life expectancy can, however, alone or in 
combination increase the risk of physical and psychosocial long-term problems or 
late complications. For many patients cancer has become a chronic disease and is 
associated with significant physical and psychosocial problems that affect the 
quality of life in the medium and longer-term perspective. Common problems of 
cancer patients in the longer course of the disease include chronic and 
post-cancer pain, cancer-specific fatigue, psychosocial distress and impairment 
in self-management and activities of daily living, work participation and 
quality of life. Current developments with respect to both curative and 
palliative oncological care have various implications for health services 
research in psycho-oncology. These questions relate to issues of care needs, 
service provision and the appropriateness of care, issues of development, 
implementation and scientific evaluation of patient-centered and affordable 
support programs for different groups of cancer patients with different 
supportive care needs, issues of access and utilization of supportive care 
services, as well as questions of appropriate outcome criteria of health 
services research.

Medical Treatment of Acromegaly with Dopamine Agonists or Somatostatin Analogs.

Université Paris-Saclay, Le Kremlin-Bicêtre, France.

Treatment of acromegaly aims to correct (or prevent) tumor compression of 
surrounding tissues by excising the disease-causing lesion and reduce growth 
hormone (GH) and IGF-1 levels to normal values. When surgery (the usual 
first-line treatment) fails to correct GH/IGF-1 hypersecretion, medical 
treatment with dopamine agonists (DAs; particularly cabergoline) or somatostatin 
analogs (SAs) can be used. The GH receptor antagonist pegvisomant is helpful in 
patients who are totally or partially resistant to SAs and can be given in 
association with both SAs and/or DAs. Thanks to this multistep therapeutic 
strategy, adequate hormonal disease control is achieved in most patients, giving 
them normal life expectancy. Comorbidities associated with acromegaly generally 
improve after treatment, but persistent sequelae may nonetheless impair quality 
of life.

BACKGROUND: Guidelines recommend against treating localized prostate cancer 
(PCa) in men with a greater than 10-year life expectancy. However, physicians 
have difficulty accurately estimating life expectancy.
OBJECTIVE: We used data from a population-based observational study to develop a 
nomogram to estimate long-term other-cause mortality based on self-reported 
health status (SRHS), race/ethnicity, and age at diagnosis.
DESIGN: This was an observational study.
SUBJECTS: Men diagnosed with localized PCa from October 1994 through October 
1995 participated in the study.
MAIN MEASURES: Initial measures obtained 6 months after diagnosis included 
sociodemographic and tumor characteristics, treatment, and a single item on the 
SRHS, with response options ranging from excellent to poor. We used 
Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End-Results program data to determine date and 
cause of death through December 2010. We estimated other-cause mortality with 
proportional hazards survival analyses, accounting for competing risks.
KEY RESULTS: We evaluated 2,695 men, of whom 74% underwent aggressive therapy 
(surgery or radiotherapy). At the initial survey, 18% reported excellent (E), 
36% very good (VG), 31% good (G), and 15% fair/poor (F/P) health. Healthier men 
were younger, and more likely to be white, better educated, and to undergo 
surgery. At follow-up, 44% of the cohort had died; 78% of deaths were from 
causes other than PCa. SRHS predicted other-cause mortality; for men reporting 
E, VG, G, F/P health, the cumulative incidences of other-cause mortality were 
20%, 29%, 40%, and 53%, respectively, p < 0.001. Compared to a reference of 
excellent SRHS, multivariable hazard ratios (95% CI) for other-cause mortality 
for men reporting VG, G, and F/P health were 1.22 (0.97-1.54), 1.73 (1.38-2.17), 
and 2.71 (2.11-3.48), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Responses to a one-item SRHS measure were strongly associated with 
other-cause mortality 15 years after PCa diagnosis. Men reporting fair/poor 
health had substantial risks for other-cause mortality, suggesting limited 
benefit for undergoing aggressive treatment. SRHS can be considered in 
supporting informed decision-making about PCa treatment.

Notwithstanding the advances in tumor research, diagnosis, and treatment, breast 
cancer is still a challenge worldwide. This global burden of disease has been 
associated with population aging and the persistence of cancer-related 
behaviors. The number of women diagnosed with breast cancer has been estimated 
as increasing, especially in middle-income countries such as Brazil. Estimates 
from the Instituto Nacional de Câncer (INCA) point to breast cancer as the major 
malignant neoplasia in Brazilian women and the main cause of death from cancer 
in the country. This fact has been associated with increased life expectancy, 
urbanization, and cancer-related behaviors. Given this scenario, it is clear 
that there is a need for identifying and discussing which factors have 
substantially contributed to this growing number of cases in Brazil, including 
access to treatment, prevention and early diagnosis, weaknesses of the local 
health policy, and intrinsic genetic peculiarities of the Brazilian population. 
This review aims to address the role of such factors.

The advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy has prolonged the life 
expectancy of HIV patients and decreased the number of adults who progress to 
AIDS and HIV-associated dementia. However, neurocognitive deficits remain a 
pronounced consequence of HIV/AIDS. HIV-1 infection targets the central nervous 
system in subcortical brain areas and leads to high rates of delirium, 
depression, opportunistic central nervous system infections, and dementia. 
Long-term HIV replication in the brain occurs in astrocytes and microglia, 
allowing the virus to hide from antiviral medication and later compromise 
neuronal function. The associated cognitive disturbance is linked to both viral 
activity and inflammatory and other mediators from these immune cells that lead 
to the damage associated with HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders, a general 
term given for these disturbances. We review the severity and prevalence of the 
neuropsychiatric complications of HIV including delirium, neurobehavioral 
impairments (depression), minor cognitive-motor dysfunction, and HIV-associated 
dementia.

Cesare 11, 70124 , Bari, Italy. artor.niccoliasabella@uniba.it.

OBJECTIVE: Mucormycosis is an infection caused by mycetes mucorales, emerged as 
a life-threatening infection associated with severe morbidity and high 
mortality. Conventional imaging such as computed tomography (CT) and magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI) are usually performed to assess mucormycosis extension, 
but they may present insufficiencies in their performance.
CASE PRESENTATION: We present the case of a 13 years old patient with diagnosis 
of rhino-orbital-cerebral mucormycosis (RCM) who performed head MRI and 
[(18)F]2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography/computed 
tomography ((18)F-FDG PET/CT) both for the infection spread assessment and for 
the early evaluation of response to systemic amphotericin-B treatment.
CONCLUSION: This case suggests that (18)F-FDG PET/CT could be considered as a 
valuable tool for the initial staging of RCM when compared with MRI and should 
be performed as soon as possible after the first clinical suspicion of this 
disease. In addition (18)F-FDG PET/CT may also be useful for the assessment of 
response to treatment.

Deaconess Medical Center, Cambridge; and †Division of Urogynecology and 
Reconstructive Pelvic Surgery, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, 
University of Massachusetts Memorial Medical Center, Worcester, MA.

OBJECTIVE: We sought to investigate the cost utility of nonsurgical versus 
surgical treatments for stress urinary incontinence (SUI).
METHODS: A decision analysis model was created to compare nonsurgical and 
surgical treatment options for women with SUI. Decision paths included 
conservative management, pelvic floor physical therapy (pelvic floor muscle 
training [PFMT]), PFMT with electrical stimulation, incontinence pessary, and 
surgical treatment. A Markov model cohort analysis was performed with a cycle 
length of 1 year starting at age 45 years with a lifetime horizon. 
Probabilities, success rates, and utilities were obtained from the literature 
when available or by expert opinion. Cost-utility analysis was performed using 
US recommendations from a societal perspective. Cost data were obtained from 
Medicare reimbursement in 2012 US dollars.
RESULTS: Incontinence pessary was the most cost-effective treatment option with 
a cost of $11,411 for 18.9 quality-adjusted life years. At a willingness to pay 
(WTP) threshold of $50,000, incontinence pessary remained the most 
cost-effective treatment option. At a WTP threshold of $60,000, surgery became 
the most cost-effective treatment option. The PFMT and PFMT with electrical 
stimulation were dominated at any WTP threshold.
CONCLUSIONS: Surgical correction is likely the most cost-effective treatment 
option for young healthy women with SUI. Results are driven by the high success 
rate of minimally invasive slings. More studies are needed to define utility 
values for heath states experienced by women with SUI. This will enhance our 
ability to develop more accurate cost-utility models and offer the best 
treatment for women affected by incontinence.

The rise in life expectancy has placed grandparents at higher risk to experience 
losing a grandchild. The authors examined the ways grandparents experience the 
loss of a grandchild. Twelve grandparents were interviewed based on an interview 
guide and phenomenologically analyzed. Three main themes were found: the loss as 
a personal turning point; the significance of the ongoing relationships with the 
deceased; and the impact on one's beliefs and attitudes. The loss of a 
grandchild is characterized by a complex tension between two inter-related 
forces of distancing and becoming closer to the grandchild and his or her 
parent.

Atrial fibrillation is a common condition in the elderly, and the incidence of 
thromboembolic events secondary to atrial fibrillation increases with age. 
Antithrombotic therapy effectively prevents stroke and systemic embolism but 
also exposes patients to the risk of bleeding. Because the risk of bleeding also 
increases with age, clinicians tend to withhold anticoagulation in the elderly. 
Anticoagulation is particularly complex in the frail elderly patient, who 
presents additional risk factors affecting both efficacy and safety of 
thromboembolic prevention. The main clinical trials rarely include frail elderly 
patients and, consequently, the guidelines do not provide guidance for their 
management. In the absence of clear indications for this class of patients, we 
identified some areas that should be taken into account both before starting and 
when discontinuing anticoagulation: comorbidities, polypharmacotherapy, 
adherence, cognitive impairment, mobility and monitoring barriers, nutritional 
status and swallowing disorders, risk of falls, and reduced life expectancy. We 
also suggest a multidimensional algorithm covering both a standard ischemic and 
bleeding risk assessment and an additional anticoagulation-focused frailty 
assessment. This is of particular relevance given the recent introduction of the 
oral direct inhibitors, as they are likely to widen the treatment options for 
the frail elderly. Depending on which aspect of frailty is present, 
anticoagulation can now be tailored accordingly.

PURPOSE: Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) has been proposed for the 
palliation of painful vertebral bone metastases because higher radiation doses 
may result in superior and more durable pain control. A phase III clinical trial 
(Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 0631) comparing single fraction SBRT with 
single fraction external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) in palliative treatment 
of painful vertebral bone metastases is now ongoing. We performed a 
cost-effectiveness analysis to compare these strategies.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: A Markov model, using a 1-month cycle over a lifetime 
horizon, was developed to compare the cost-effectiveness of SBRT (16 or 18 Gy in 
1 fraction) with that of 8 Gy in 1 fraction of EBRT. Transition probabilities, 
quality of life utilities, and costs associated with SBRT and EBRT were captured 
in the model. Costs were based on Medicare reimbursement in 2014. Strategies 
were compared using the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), and 
effectiveness was measured in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). To account 
for uncertainty, 1-way, 2-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were 
performed. Strategies were evaluated with a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold 
of $100,000 per QALY gained.
RESULTS: Base case pain relief after the treatment was assumed as 20% higher in 
SBRT. Base case treatment costs for SBRT and EBRT were $9000 and $1087, 
respectively. In the base case analysis, SBRT resulted in an ICER of $124,552 
per QALY gained. In 1-way sensitivity analyses, results were most sensitive to 
variation of the utility of unrelieved pain; the utility of relieved pain after 
initial treatment and median survival were also sensitive to variation. If 
median survival is ≥11 months, SBRT cost <$100,000 per QALY gained.
CONCLUSION: SBRT for palliation of vertebral bone metastases is not 
cost-effective compared with EBRT at a $100,000 per QALY gained WTP threshold. 
However, if median survival is ≥11 months, SBRT costs ≤$100,000 per QALY gained, 
suggesting that selective SBRT use in patients with longer expected survival may 
be the most cost-effective approach.

Acromegaly is a rare condition characterized by the excessive secretion of 
growth hormone (GH), usually by a pituitary adenoma. The clinical manifestations 
of acromegaly include enlarged hands, feet and face, headaches, arthralgias, 
fatigue and hyperhydrosis. This condition is also associated with comorbidities 
such as hypertension and diabetes in a significant proportion of patients and 
frequently compromises life quality and life expectancy. The biochemical 
diagnosis of acromegaly rests on the demonstration of an autonomous secretion of 
GH by means of the measurement of glucose-suppressed GH levels and the serum 
concentration of insulin like growth factor type 1 (IGF-1). The localizing 
method of choice is magnetic resonance image of the selar area, which in 70 % of 
the cases reveals the presence of a macroadenoma. Even though the primary 
treatment is usually the transsphenoidal resection of the adenoma, the majority 
of patients require a multimodal intervention that includes radiotherapy, as 
well as pharmacological therapy with somatostatin analogs and dopamine agonists. 
The latter approach has resulted in a significant reduction in mortality and in 
an improvement in the quality of life.

Publisher: La acromegalia es una entidad rara que se caracteriza por un 
incremento en la secreción de hormona de crecimiento (GH), generalmente 
resultado de un adenoma hipofisiario. Las manifestaciones clínicas incluyen 
acrocrecimiento de manos, pies y cara, cefalea, artralgias, fatiga e 
hiperhidrosis. Esta condición se asocia a comorbilidades como la hipertensión y 
la diabetes en una proporción importante de pacientes y resulta en una 
disminución en la esperanza y la calidad de vida. El diagnóstico bioquímico se 
basa en la demostración de una hipersecreción autónoma de GH mediante la prueba 
de supresión con glucosa y en la presencia de niveles elevados de factor de 
crecimiento insulinoide tipo 1 (IGF-1). El método de imagen de elección es la 
resonancia magnética nuclear (RMN) de silla turca, la cual muestra un 
macroadenoma en el 7 % de los casos. Si bien el tratamiento de elección es la 
cirugía transefenoidal, la mayoría de los pacientes requiere de un abordaje 
multimodal, que incluye radioterapia y manejo farmacológico con agonistas 
dopaminérgicos y análogos de la somatostatina. Este abordaje multimodal, aunado 
al tratamiento específico de las distintas comorbilidades ha resultado en una 
disminución significativa en la mortalidad y en una importante mejoría en la 
calidad de vida de estos pacientes.

There is a high need for blood-based biomarkers detecting age-related changes in 
muscular performance at an early stage. Therefore, we investigated whether serum 
levels of growth and differentiation factor-15 (GDF-15), activin A, myostatin, 
follistatin, and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) would reflect age- and 
physical performance-related differences between young (22-28 years) and elderly 
(65-92 years) females. Isokinetic peak torque of knee extension (PTE) was 
measured in young females to obtain reference values for the discrimination of 
different stages of age-associated muscle weakness. Additionally, elderly women 
were screened for sarcopenia using the algorithm of the European Working Group 
on Sarcopenia in Older People (low muscle mass in addition to low PTE and/or low 
walking speed). IGF-1 levels were higher and GDF-15 levels were lower in young 
females in comparison to the elderly (p < 0.01), whereas members of the activin 
A/myostatin/follistatin axis showed similar levels across age groups. In older 
women, IGF-1 correlated negatively with age (ρ = -0.359, p < 0.01) and 
positively with muscle mass (ρ = 0.365, p < 0.01). In contrast, GDF-15 
correlated positively with age (ρ = 0.388, p < 0.001) and negatively with muscle 
mass (ρ = -0.320, p < 0.01). However, none of the serum markers differed between 
women classified as non-, mildly and severely dynapenic/sarcopenic. Multiple 
linear regression analyses revealed that a combination of all blood-based 
biomarkers obtained in addition to age and fat mass moderately predicted muscle 
mass (+2.9%). Neither a single nor a combined set of tested biomarkers reflected 
the presence of dynapenia or sarcopenia in elderly women. However, due to the 
associations of IGF-1 and GDF-15 with correlates of muscle mass and function, 
these parameters remain promising candidates in a potential set of blood-based 
biomarkers to diagnose sarcopenia and/or dynapenia.

Artemisinin mimics calorie restriction to extend yeast lifespan via a dual-phase 
mode: a conclusion drawn from global transcriptome profiling.

Calorie restriction (CR) promotes longevity among distinct organisms from yeast 
to mammals. Although CR-prolonged lifespan is believed to associate with 
enhanced respiratory activity, it is apparently controversial for accelerated 
energy consumption regardless of insufficient nutrient intake. In reconciling 
the contradiction of less food supply versus much metabolite dispense, we 
revealed a CR-based mode of dual-phase responses that encompass a phase of 
mitochondrial enhancement (ME) and a phase of post-mitochondrial enhancement 
(PME), which can be distinguished by the expression patterns and activity 
dynamics of mitochondrial signatures. ME is characterized by global 
antioxidative activation, and PME is denoted by systemic metabolic modulation. 
CR-mediated aging-delaying effects are replicated by artesunate, a 
semi-synthetic derivative of the antimalarial artemisinin that can alkylate 
heme-containing proteins, suggesting artesunate-heme conjugation functionally 
resembles nitric oxide-heme interaction. A correlation of artesunate-heme 
conjugation with cytochrome c oxidase activation has been established from 
adduct formation and activity alteration. Exogenous hydrogen peroxide also 
mimics CR to trigger antioxidant responses, affect signaling cascades, and alter 
respiratory rhythms, implying hydrogen peroxide is engaged in lifespan 
extension. Conclusively, artesunate mimics CR-triggered nitric oxide and 
hydrogen peroxide to induce antioxidative networks for scavenging reactive 
oxygen species and mitigating oxidative stress, thereby directing metabolic 
conversion from anabolism to catabolism, maintaining essential metabolic 
functionality, and extending life expectancy in yeast.

OBJECTIVE: Premature mortality is a public health concern that can be quantified 
as years of potential life lost (YPLL). Studying premature mortality from 
in-hospital mortality can help guide hospital initiatives and resource 
allocation. This paper identified the diagnosis categories associated with 
in-hospital deaths that account for the highest YPLL and their trends over time.
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective review of the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS), 
1988-2010.
METHODS: Using the NIS, YPLL on patients hospitalized in the United States from 
1988 to 2010 was calculated. Hospitalizations were categorized by related 
principal diagnoses using the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) 
single-level Clinical Classification Software (CCS) definitions.
RESULTS: Between 1988 and 2010, total in-hospital estimated mortality of 
20,154,186 people accounted for 198,417,257 YPLL (9.84 YPLL per in-hospital 
mortality; 8,626,837 estimated annual mean YPLL). The ten highest YPLL diagnosis 
categories accounted for 51% of the overall YPLL. The liveborn disease category 
(i.e., in-hospital live births) was the most common principal diagnosis and 
accounted for the highest YPLL at 1,070,053. The septicemia category accounted 
for the second highest YPLL at 548,922. The highest in-hospital mortality rate 
(20.8%) was associated with adult respiratory failure/insufficiency/arrest. The 
highest estimated in-hospital annual mean deaths occurred in patients with 
pneumonia at 69,134. For all in-hospital mortality, the inflation adjusted total 
in-hospital charges per YPLL was highest for acute myocardial infarction at 
$9292 per YPLL.
CONCLUSIONS: Using YPLL, a framework has been provided to compare the impact of 
premature in-hospital mortality from dissimilar diseases. The methodology and 
results may be used to help guide further investigation of hospital quality 
initiatives and resource allocation.

OBJECTIVES: Real-time virtual sonography (RVS) is a promising navigation 
technique for percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (RFA) treatment, especially 
in ablating nodules poorly visualized on conventional ultrasonography (US). 
However, its cost-effectiveness has not been established. The purpose of this 
study is to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of RVS navigated RFA (RVS-RFA) 
relative to US guided RFA (US-RFA) in patients with small hepatocellular 
carcinoma (HCC) in China, from the modified societal perspective.
METHODS: A state-transition Markov model was created using TreeAge Pro™ 2012. 
The parameters used in the model, including natural history of HCC patients, 
procedure efficacy and related costs, were obtained from a systematic search of 
literature through PubMed, EMBASE, and Science Citation Index databases. The 
simulated cohort was patients with solitary, small HCC (<3 cm in diameter) and 
Child-Pugh class A or B, whose tumors are poorly visualized in B-mode US but 
clearly detectable by CT or MRI.
RESULTS: In this cohort of difficult cases, RVS-RFA was a preferred strategy 
saving 2,467 CNY ($392) throughout the patient's life while gaining additional 
1.4 QALYs compared with conventional US guidance. The results were sensitive to 
the efficacy of US-RFA and RVS-RFA including complete ablation rate and local 
recurrence rate, the median survival for patients with progressive HCC, the 
probability of performing RFA for recurrent HCC, and the cost of RVS navigation, 
disposable needle or hospitalization.
CONCLUSIONS: RVS-RFA is a dominant strategy for patients with small HCC 
unidentifiable in B-mode US, in terms of cost savings and QALYs gained, relative 
to the conventional US-guided method.

The SF-6D, a health-related quality-of-life measure, assigns value to patients' 
perception of their health. We determined SF-6D values of 844 TKA patients, 
deduced clinical relevance of value changes using effect size, and compared 
these to clinical and functional improvements 6weeks, 3months, and 1 through 
5years post-operatively. The SF-6D significantly improved at all follow-ups 
after 6weeks. The effect size indicated clinical relevance at every follow-up. 
The KSS improved at all follow-ups (+43, +51, +56, +57, +57 points), and LEAS 
scores improved at follow-ups after 6weeks (+1 point at 3months, +2 points 
thereafter), correlating with SF-6D changes. Deducing utility scores facilitates 
cost analyses, allowing clinicians to deduce quality-adjusted life-years and 
economic impacts of treatments.

An appreciation of the neuropathology of human spinal cord injury (SCI) is a 
basic requirement for all concerned with the medical treatment of patients with 
SCI as well as for the many neuroscientists devoted to finding a "cure". An 
understanding of the neuropathology of SCI is a necessary guide to those 
concerned at all levels of treatment, whether they are doctors or other health 
professionals. The underlying changes in the spinal cord are especially relevant 
to the restorative neurology (RN) of SCI. The new discipline of RN seeks to 
enhance the function of residual spinal cord elements which have survived the 
injury and so improve the patient's rehabilitative status. This is in contrast 
to the conventional approach in rehabilitation which works around the clinical 
neurological deficiencies. Following the injury a series of changes take place 
in the spinal cord and surrounding tissues which continue to evolve throughout 
the life of the patient. In flexion and extension injuries resulting from motor 
vehicle trauma, diving and sporting accidents the spinal cord is compressed and 
disrupted but usually with some continuity remaining in the white matter 
columns. The brunt of the injury is usually centrally placed where there is 
bleeding into the disrupted grey matter involving one two segments, usually 
cervical. The loss of central grey matter is nowhere near as important as is the 
tearing apart of the white matter tracts in determining the patient's clinical 
state. The central grey matter supplies one two overlapping segmental myotomes 
and sensory fields. In contrast loss of continuity in the long white matter 
tracts is catastrophic because all functions below the level of injury are 
affected, autonomic or voluntary either by paralysis or anaesthesia, usually 
both. It is important to determine the exact nature of the injury in every 
patient as a preliminary to treatment by RN. This assessment is both clinical 
and neurophysiological with special attention given to any part of the long 
white matter tracts which may have escaped the initial injury. It is these 
residual nerve fibres which provide the opportunity to improve the patient's 
neurological state by being re-activated, modulated and enhanced by stimulation 
or by other RN methods. The conversion of a clinically complete SCI patient to 
being incomplete and ambulant is a tremendous improvement in the patient's 
status. It is the purpose of this article to provide the reader with the 
essential neuropathology of SCI as a beginning point in planning treatment 
whether it is medical or ancillary, as well as to inform the neuroscientist 
about the condition being addressed in his or her research.

Improved life expectancy and the need for robust tools to monitor renal safety 
of emerging new therapies have fueled the interest in renal function in Duchenne 
muscular dystrophy (DMD) patients. We aimed to establish a methodology to 
accurately assess their renal function. Twenty DMD patients (5-22 years) were 
included in this prospective study. After obtaining medical history, all 
patients underwent a clinical examination, 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure 
monitoring, ultrasound of the kidneys, direct GFR measurement ((51)Cr-EDTA, 
mGFR), complete blood and urine analysis. Seventeen of 20 patients were treated 
with corticosteroids and 5/20 with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor 
(lisinopril). No patient suffered from urinary tract infections or other renal 
diseases. Hypertension (systolic or diastolic blood pressure >P95) was found in 
9/20 patients (8/9 patients were on steroid treatment) and a non-dipping blood 
pressure profile in 13/20 subjects (10/13 patients were on steroid treatment). 
Urinary protein to creatinine ratio was elevated in 17/18 patients, whereas 
24-hour urine protein excretion was normal in all subjects. Median interquartile 
range (IQR) mGFR was 130.4 (29.1) mL/min/1.73 m(2). Hyperfiltration (mGFR 
>150 mL/min/1.73 m(2)) was found in 5/20 patients. Inverse correlation between 
mGFR and age was observed (R(2) = 0.45, p = 0.001). Serum creatinine based 
estimated GFR (eGFR) equations overestimated mGFR up to 300%. eGFR based on 
cystatin C Filler equation was closest to the mGFR (median eGFR (IQR) of 129.5 
(39.7) mL/min/1.73 m(2)). Our study demonstrates a high prevalence of 
hyperfiltration and hypertension in children and adolescents with DMD. Because 
the majority of hypertensive patients were under corticosteroid treatment, the 
iatrogenic cause of hypertension cannot be excluded. Serum or urine creatinine 
measurements are of no value to evaluate renal function in DMD patients due to 
the reduced skeletal muscle mass.

OBJECTIVE: Sitting is one of milestones in motor development. However, reaching 
of the sitting position must precede achieving the ability of independent 
sitting. Qualitative assessment of motor performance at 3 months of age, with 
the prospective quantitative assessment of the function of independent reaching 
of the sitting position at the age of 8 months.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: 125 children, 51 girls and 74 boys (born at term n = 78; 
born prematurely n = 47) were subject to prospective assessment of motor 
development with qualitative characteristics at the age of 3 months and 
quantitative characteristics at the age of 8 months. In parallel, the children 
were subjected to neurological assessment. Risk factors that could potentially 
affect motor development were analyzed.
RESULTS: Children who at the age of 3 months performed at least 13 /15 
qualitative elements in the prone position and at least 13/15 qualitative 
elements in the supine position, at the age of 8 months reached independently 
the sitting position. Poor qualitative assessment at the age of 3 months and a 
higher prevalence of risk factors increased the risk of non-reaching the sitting 
position. In the prone position, the pelvis, lower limbs, the arms and shoulders 
showed the most expressed differences between the children who reached or did 
not reached the independent sitting. For the supine position, the pelvis and 
lower limbs, as well as the extension of the spine and correct alignment of the 
shoulders showed the most expressed differences.
CONCLUSIONS: Proper qualitative development at the age of 3 months is a good 
predictor of the achievement of independent reaching of the sitting position at 
the age of 8 months.
