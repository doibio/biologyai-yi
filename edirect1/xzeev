BACKGROUND: In Europe, as in other high-income (HI) countries, quite half of the 
newly diagnosed patients with head and neck (H and N) cancers are older than 65 
years of age and their proportion within the prevalent cases is even higher. 
Moreover, the incidence rate (IR) for all H and N cancers sites increased with 
age and the survival rate is lower in older patients (≥65), compared with 
younger patients (<65). The number of older patients affected by H and N cancers 
will increase because of the increase in life expectancy. The aim of the article 
is to provide an epidemiological description of H and N cancers in the elderly 
population.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Incidence and prevalence data by time periods and 
continents were extracted from the Global Cancer Observatory. The survival 
information for Europe is obtained from the EUROCARE and RARECAREnet projects. 
In 2020, according to the results from these data, slightly more than 900,000 
cases have been diagnosed with H and N cancers in the world, and approximately 
40% were older than 65 years of age. This percentage was higher, reaching 
approximately 50% in the HI countries. The highest number of cases was in the 
Asiatic populations, while the highest crude IR was in Europe and Oceania. Among 
H and N cancers occurring in the elderly, laryngeal and oral cavity cancers were 
the most common, while nasal cavities and nasopharyngeal cancers were the 
rarest. This was true for all the countries, excluding some Asiatic populations, 
in which tumour of the nasopharynx was more common. The five-year survival rate 
in the European population was low in the elderly, compared with the younger for 
all H and N cancers, and it ranged from approximately 60% for both 
salivary-gland type and laryngeal to 22% for hypopharyngeal tumors. For the 
elderly, the conditional 5-year survival after surviving one year became more 
than 60% for many H and N epithelial tumors.
CONCLUSION: The high variability in the H and N cancer incidence around the 
world is due to the distribution of the major risk factors which for the elderly 
are mainly alcohol and smoking. The reasons for low survival in the elderly are 
most likely due to the complexity of treatment, the late arrival of patients at 
diagnosis, and the difficult access to specialized centers.

The number of people living with dementia is rising globally as life expectancy 
increases. Dementia is a multifactorial disease. Due to the ubiquity of 
radiation exposure in medical and occupational settings, the potential 
association between radiation and dementia, and its subtypes (Alzheimer's and 
Parkinson's disease), is of particular importance. There has also been an 
increased interest in studying radiation induced dementia risks in connection 
with the long-term manned space travel proposed by The National Aeronautics and 
Space Administration (NASA). Our aim was to systematically review the literature 
on this topic, and use meta-analysis to generate a summary measure of 
association, assess publication bias and explore sources of heterogeneity across 
studies. We identified five types of exposed populations for this review: 1. 
survivors of atomic bombings in Japan; 2. patients treated with radiation 
therapy for cancer or other diseases; 3. occupationally exposed workers; 4. 
those exposed to environmental radiation; and 5. patients exposed to radiation 
from diagnostic radiation imaging procedures. We included studies that 
considered incident or mortality outcomes for dementia and its subtypes. 
Following PRISMA guidelines, we systematically searched the published literature 
indexed in PubMed between 2001 and 2022. We then abstracted the relevant 
articles, conducted a risk-of-bias assessment, and fit random effects models 
using the published risk estimates. After we applied our eligibility criteria, 
18 studies were identified for review and retained for meta-analysis. For 
dementia (all subtypes), the summary relative risk was 1.11 (95% CI: 1.04, 1.18; 
P = 0.001) comparing individuals receiving 100 mSv of radiation to those with no 
exposure. The corresponding summary relative risk for Parkinson's disease 
incidence and mortality was 1.12 (95% CI 1.07, 1.17; P <0.001). Our results 
provide evidence that exposure to ionizing radiation increases the risk of 
dementia. However, our findings should be interpreted with caution due to the 
small number of included studies. Longitudinal studies with improved exposure 
characterization, incident outcomes, larger sample size, and the ability to 
adjust for effects of potential confounders are needed to better assess the 
possible causal link between ionizing radiation and dementia.

to 2019: findings from global burden of disease study.

and Prevention (Chinese Center for Tropical Diseases Research), NHC Key 
Laboratory of Parasite and Vector Biology, WHO Collaborating Centre for Tropical 
Diseases, National Center for International Research on Tropical Diseases, 
Shanghai, China.

OBJECTIVE: This study sought to investigate the parasitic diseases of neglected 
tropical diseases defined by the World Health Organization based on the Global 
Burden of Disease Study (GBD) database. Importantly, we analyzed the prevalence 
and burden of these diseases in China from 1990 to 2019 to provide valuable 
information to formulate more effective measures for their management and 
prevention.
METHODS: Data on the prevalence and burden of neglected parasitic diseases in 
China from 1990 to 2019 were extracted from the global health data exchange 
(GHDx) database, including the absolute number of prevalence, age-standardized 
prevalence rate, disability-adjusted life year (DALY) and age-standardized DALY 
rate. Descriptive analysis was used to analyze the prevalence and burden 
changes, sex and age distribution of various parasitic diseases from 1990 to 
2019. A time series model [Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA)] 
was used to predict the DALYs of neglected parasitic diseases in China from 2020 
to 2030.
RESULTS: In 2019, the number of neglected parasitic diseases in China was 
152518062, the age-standardized prevalence was 11614.1 (95% uncertainty interval 
(UI) 8758.5-15244.5), the DALYs were 955722, and the age-standardized DALY rate 
was 54.9 (95% UI 26.0-101.8). Among these, the age-standardized prevalence of 
soil-derived helminthiasis was the highest (9370.2/100,000), followed by 
food-borne trematodiases (1502.3/100,000) and schistosomiasis (707.1/100,000). 
The highest age-standardized DALY rate was for food-borne trematodiases 
(36.0/100,000), followed by cysticercosis (7.9/100,000) and soil-derived 
helminthiasis (5.6/100,000). Higher prevalence and disease burden were observed 
in men and the upper age group. From 1990 to 2019, the number of neglected 
parasitic diseases in China decreased by 30.4%, resulting in a decline in DALYs 
of 27.3%. The age-standardized DALY rates of most diseases were decreased, 
especially for soil-derived helminthiasis, schistosomiasis and food-borne 
trematodiases. The ARIMA prediction model showed that the disease burden of 
echinococcosis and cysticercosis exhibited an increasing trend, highlighting the 
need for further prevention and control.
CONCLUSION: Although the prevalence and disease burden of neglected parasitic 
diseases in China have decreased, many issues remain to be addressed. More 
efforts should be undertaken to improve the prevention and control strategies 
for different parasitic diseases. The government should prioritize multisectoral 
integrated control and surveillance measures to prioritize the prevention and 
control of diseases with a high burden of disease. In addition, the older adult 
population and men need to pay more attention.

Improved life expectancy from advances in antiretroviral therapy (ART) has been 
followed by a rise in comorbidities and polypharmacy in this aging population. 
Historically, polypharmacy has been associated with suboptimal virologic 
outcomes in persons with HIV, although data in the current ART era and among 
historically marginalized populations in the United States are limited. We 
measured the prevalence of comorbidities and polypharmacy, evaluating their 
impact on virologic suppression. This retrospective IRB-approved cross-sectional 
study reviewed health records of adults with HIV on ART and receiving care (≥2 
visits) in 2019 at a single center in a historically minoritized community. 
Virologic suppression (HIV RNA <200 copies/mL) based on polypharmacy (≥5 non-HIV 
medications) or multimorbidity (≥2 chronic conditions) was evaluated. Logistic 
regression analyses were performed to identify factors associated with virologic 
suppression, with age, race/ethnicity, and CD4 < 200 cells/mm3 as covariates. Of 
the 963 individuals that met the criteria, 67%, 47%, and 34% had ≥1 comorbidity, 
multimorbidity, and polypharmacy, respectively. The cohort demographics were: 
mean of 49 years (range, 18-81), 40% cisgender women, 46% Latinx individuals, 
45% Black individuals, 8% White individuals. Virologic suppression rates were 
95% among patients with polypharmacy compared with 86% in those with a lower 
pill burden (p = 0.0001). The odds of virologic success were higher for 
individuals with polypharmacy [adjusted odds ratio, aOR = 2.3 (95% confidence 
interval, CI: 1.2-4.4)] and Latinx identity [aOR = 2.4 (95% CI: 1.5-3.8)], but 
lower if a CD4 count <200 cells/mm3 [aOR = 0.07 (95% CI: 0.04-0.1)]. The 
comorbidity burden was higher than previously described, which are driving 
polypharmacy rates. In the current ART era, polypharmacy is not inherently 
associated with worse virologic outcomes.

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to provide a better understanding of the secular trends in 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA) burden at the regional and national levels, 
contributing to identifying the areas with high burden needs and finding the 
potential areas requiring additional attention, which will facilitate the 
development of strategies tailored to RA burden.
METHOD: Data were obtained from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and 
Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2019 study. We presented the secular trends in the 
prevalence, incidence, and years lived with disability (YLDs) of RA needs by 
sex, age, sociodemographic index (SDI), region, country, and category between 
1990 and 2019 using data from the GBD 2019 study. The age-standardized rates 
(ASR) and its estimated annual percentage changes (EAPCs) are employed to 
describe the secular trends in RA.
RESULTS: Globally, there were an estimated 18.5 million [95% confidence interval 
(CI) 31.53 to 41.74)] prevalent cases of RA, with 1.07 million (95% CI 0.95 to 
1.18) incident cases per year and almost 2.43 million YLDs (95% CI 1.68 to 3.28) 
in 2019. The age-standardized prevalence and incidence rates estimated for RA 
were 224.25 per 100,000 and 12.21 per 100,000 in 2019, with EAPCs of 0.37 (95% 
CI - 0.32, 0.42) and 0.30 (95% CI 0.25 to 0.34), respectively. The corresponding 
age-standardized YLDs estimated was 29.35 per 100,000 in 2019, with an EAPC of 
0.38 (95% CI: 0.33, 0.43). During the study period, the ASR of RA was 
consistently higher in females than in males. Moreover, the age-standardized YLD 
rate of RA was associated with the sociodemographic index (SDI) in 2019 across 
all 204 countries and territories (R = 0.28). The projections indicate that the 
age-standardized incidence rates (ASIR) trend will continue to increase from 
2019 to 2040, with a projected ASIR of 10.48 and 4.63/100,000 for females and 
males, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: RA is prevalent and remains a significant global public health 
challenge. Globally, the burden of RA has increased over the past 30 years and 
will continue to increase. Prevention and early treatment of RA are pivotal to 
avoiding disease onset and alleviating the enormous burden. Key Points • The 
burden of rheumatoid arthritis is increasing globally. • Global estimates 
indicate that the number of RA incident cases will increase 1.4-fold globally, 
from approximately 1.07 million at the end of 2019 to approximately 1.5 million 
by 2040.

Research shows that geographic disparities in life expectancy between leading 
and lagging states are increasing over time while racial disparities between 
Black and White Americans have been going down. In the 65+ age strata morbidity 
is the most common cause of death, making differences in morbidity and 
associated adverse health-related outcomes between advantaged and disadvantaged 
groups an important aspect of disparities in life expectancy at age 65 (LE65). 
In this study, we used Pollard's decomposition to evaluate the disease-related 
contributions to disparities in LE65 for two types of data with distinctly 
differing structures: population/registry and administrative claims. To do so, 
we analyzed Pollard's integral, which is exact by construction, and developed 
exact analytic solutions for both types of data without the need for numerical 
integration. The solutions are broadly applicable and easily implemented. 
Applying these solutions, we found that the largest relative contributions to 
geographic disparities in LE65 were chronic lower respiratory diseases, 
circulatory diseases, and lung cancer; and, to racial disparities: arterial 
hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and cerebrovascular diseases. Overall, the 
increase in LE65 observed over 1998-2005 and 2010-2017 was primarily due to a 
reduction in the contributions of acute and chronic ischemic diseases; this was 
partially offset by increased contributions of diseases of the nervous system 
including dementia and Alzheimer's disease.

Tandem duplications are frequent structural variations of the genome and play 
important roles in genetic disease and cancer. However, interpreting the 
phenotypic consequences of tandem duplications remains challenging, in part 
owing to the lack of genetic tools to model such variations. Here, we developed 
a strategy, tandem duplication via prime editing (TD-PE), to create targeted, 
programmable, and precise tandem duplication in the mammalian genome. In this 
strategy, we design a pair of in trans prime editing guide RNAs (pegRNAs) for 
each targeted tandem duplication, which encode the same edits but prime the 
single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) extension in opposite directions. The reverse 
transcriptase (RT) template of each extension is designed homologous to the 
target region of the other single guide RNA (sgRNA) to promote the reannealing 
of the edited DNA strands and the duplication of the fragment in between. We 
showed that TD-PE produced robust and precise in situ tandem duplications of 
genomic fragments ranging from ∼50 bp to ∼10 kb, with a maximal efficiency up to 
28.33%. By fine-tuning the pegRNAs, we achieved simultaneous targeted 
duplication and fragment insertion. Finally, we successfully produced multiple 
disease-relevant tandem duplications, showing the general utility of TD-PE in 
genetic research.

BACKGROUND: Previous studies undertaken in New Zealand using generic rurality 
classifications have concluded that life expectancy and age-standardised 
mortality rates are similar for urban and rural populations.
METHODS: Administrative mortality (2014-2018) and census data (2013 and 2018) 
were used to estimate age-stratified sex-adjusted mortality rate ratios (aMRRs) 
for a range of mortality outcomes across the rural-urban spectrum (using major 
urban centres as the reference) for the total population and separately for 
Māori and non-Māori. Rural was defined according to the recently developed 
Geographic Classification for Health.
RESULTS: Mortality rates were higher overall in rural areas. This was most 
pronounced in the youngest age group (<30 years) in the most remote communities 
(eg, all-cause, amenable and injury-related aMRRs (95% CIs) were 2.1 (1.7 to 
2.6), 2.5 (1.9 to 3.2) and 3.0 (2.3 to 3.9) respectively. The rural:urban 
differences attenuated markedly with increasing age; for some outcomes in those 
aged 75 years or more, estimated aMRRs were <1.0. Similar patterns were observed 
for Māori and non-Māori.
CONCLUSION: This is the first time that a consistent pattern of higher mortality 
rates for rural populations has been observed in New Zealand. A purpose-built 
urban-rural classification and age stratification were important factors in 
unmasking these disparities.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Distributional cost-effectiveness analysis (DCEA) 
facilitates quantitative assessments of how health effects and costs are 
distributed among population subgroups, and of potential trade-offs between 
health maximisation and equity. Implementation of DCEA is currently explored by 
the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in England. Recent 
research conducted an aggregate DCEA on a selection of NICE appraisals; however, 
significant questions remain regarding the impact of the characteristics of the 
patient population (size, distribution by the equity measure of interest) and 
methodologic choices on DCEA outcomes. Cancer is the indication most appraised 
by NICE, and the relationship between lung cancer incidence and socioeconomic 
status is well established. We aimed to conduct an aggregate DCEA of two 
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treatments recommended by NICE, and identify 
key drivers of the analysis.
METHODS: Subgroups were defined according to socioeconomic deprivation. Data on 
health benefits, costs, and target populations were extracted from two NICE 
appraisals (atezolizumab versus docetaxel [second-line treatment following 
chemotherapy to represent a broad NSCLC population] and alectinib versus 
crizotinib [targeted first-line treatment to represent a rarer mutation-positive 
NSCLC population]). Data on disease incidence were derived from national 
statistics. Distributions of population health and health opportunity costs were 
taken from the literature. A societal welfare analysis was conducted to assess 
potential trade-offs between health maximisation and equity. Sensitivity 
analyses were conducted, varying a range of parameters.
RESULTS: At an opportunity cost threshold of £30,000 per quality-adjusted 
life-year (QALY), alectinib improved both health and equity, thereby increasing 
societal welfare. Second-line atezolizumab involved a trade-off between 
improving health equity and maximising health; it improved societal welfare at 
an opportunity cost threshold of £50,000/QALY. Increasing the value of the 
opportunity cost threshold improved the equity impact. The equity impact and 
societal welfare impact were small, driven by the size of the patient population 
and per-patient net health benefit. Other key drivers were the inequality 
aversion parameters and the distribution of patients by socioeconomic group; 
skewing the distribution to the most (least) deprived quintile improved 
(reduced) equity gains.
CONCLUSION: Using two illustrative examples and varying model parameters to 
simulate alternative decision problems, this study suggests that key drivers of 
an aggregate DCEA are the opportunity cost threshold, the characteristics of the 
patient population, and the level of inequality aversion. These drivers raise 
important questions in terms of the implications for decision making. Further 
research is warranted to examine the value of the opportunity cost threshold, 
capture the public's views on unfair differences in health, and estimate robust 
distributional weights incorporating the public's preferences. Finally, guidance 
from health technology assessment organisations, such as NICE, is needed 
regarding methods for DCEA construction and how they would interpret and 
incorporate those results in their decision making.

BACKGROUND: Effective antiretroviral therapy (ART) in people living with HIV 
(PLWH) has improved life expectancy and increased risk of age-associated 
cardiometabolic comorbidities. At-risk alcohol use is more frequent among PLWH 
and increases the risk of health challenges. PLWH with at-risk alcohol use are 
more likely to meet criteria for prediabetes/diabetes and this is associated 
with impaired whole-body glucose-insulin dynamics.
METHODS: The Alcohol & Metabolic Comorbidities in PLWH: Evidence Driven 
Interventions Study (ALIVE-Ex Study, NCT03299205) is a longitudinal, 
prospective, interventional study to determine the effects of an aerobic 
exercise protocol on improving dysglycemia among PLWH with at-risk alcohol use. 
The intervention is a moderate intensity aerobic exercise protocol implemented 
3 days per week for 10 weeks at the Louisiana State University Health Sciences 
Center-New Orleans. Participants who have a fasting blood glucose level between 
94 and 125 mg/dl will be enrolled in the study. Oral glucose tolerance tests, 
fitness assessments, and skeletal muscle biopsies will be performed pre- and 
post-exercise intervention. The primary outcome is to determine whether the 
exercise protocol improves measures of whole-body glucose-insulin dynamics, 
cardiorespiratory fitness, and skeletal muscle metabolic and bioenergetic 
function. Secondary outcomes are to determine whether the exercise intervention 
improves cognitive function and overall quality of life. Results generated will 
demonstrate the effect of exercise on glycemic measures in PLWH with subclinical 
dysglycemia and at-risk alcohol use.
CONCLUSIONS: The proposed intervention will also have the potential to be 
scalable to promote lifestyle changes among PLWH, particularly in underserved 
communities.

Cancer: A Single Institution Experience and a Systematic Review of the 
Literature.

We studied the dose-local control (LC) relationship in ablative vs. non-ablative 
radiotherapy in a non-radical treatment setting of "locally advanced pancreatic 
cancer (LAPC)" by comparing our patients (n = 89) treated with SBRT on the 
CyberKnife unit vs. conventional radiation between January 2005 and January 
2021, and by reviewing the literature. A systematic search was performed 
leveraging Medline for references on SBRT use in pancreatic cancer without date 
terms or language restrictions. A total of 3702 references were identified and 
the search was then repeated in Embase and the Cochrane database. Ultimately, 12 
studies were eligible for inclusion, which either compared SBRT to conventional 
radiation, or SBRT use in dose escalation for primary LAPC in a non-neoadjuvant 
setting. Our cohort's median overall survival was 152 days (CI 95%, 118-185); 
including 371 days (CI 95%, 230-511) vs. 126 days (CI 95%, 90-161) favoring 
SBRT, p = 0.004. The median time to local progression was 170 days (48-923) for 
SBRT vs. 107 days (27-489) for the non-ablative group. In our SBRT patients, no 
local progressions were seen with BED10 > 60 Gy. Even when palliating LAPC, SBRT 
should be considered as an alternative to conventional radiation, especially in 
patients with a low disease burden. BED10 ≥ 60-70 Gy offers better local control 
without increasing toxicity rates. Less local progression may provide a better 
quality of life to those patients who already have a short life expectancy.

The socioeconomic burden of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) stems from its 
characteristic multifactorial etiology and, implicitly, the difficulties 
associated with its treatment. With the increase in life expectancy and health 
awareness, nutraceuticals and functional foods are filling in the gaps left by 
the limitation of classical medical treatment in chronic conditions associated 
with lifestyle factors, such as neurological disorders. Processes, such as 
fermentation that enhance food phytochemical content are garnering increased 
attention due to their functional and health-related properties. This systematic 
review aims to provide an overview of the evidence of phytochemicals from 
fermented food sources inducing therapeutic outcomes and cognitive benefits from 
in vivo experimental models of Alzheimer's Disease. The present systematic 
review was conducted in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. Searches were 
performed in the following databases: MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane, Scopus, Google 
Scholar, and Science Citation Index Expanded (Web of Science) by two independent 
reviewers. Titles and abstracts yielded by the search were screened for 
eligibility against the inclusion criteria. The search strategy yielded 1899 
titles, encompassing studies from 1948 to 2022. After the removal of duplicates, 
and screening of titles, abstracts, and full texts, thirty three studies 
obtained from the original search strategy and seven studies from references 
satisfied the inclusion criteria and were included in the present systematic 
review. Several studies have emphasized the potential of fermentation to yield 
small-molecule phytochemicals that are not present in raw products. When these 
phytochemicals are combined, their collective strength has demonstrated the 
ability to exceed the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective 
benefits of individual phytochemicals when given in their pure form. Among the 
various fermented foods that have been studied, soy isoflavones obtained through 
fermentation have shown the most substantial evidence of altering phytochemical 
content and improving outcomes in animal models of AD. While promising in 
initial results, other fermented foods and traditional medicines require more 
detailed research in order to establish their effectiveness and proper 
utilization. As is, many of the experimental designs lacked phytochemical 
analysis of the used fermented product or comparison with the non-fermented 
counterpart. This, coupled with proper reporting in animal studies, will 
significantly raise the quality of performed studies as well as the weight of 
obtained results.

The recovery of valuable bioactive compounds from the main underutilised 
by-products of the food industry is one of the greatest challenges to be 
addressed in circular economy. Potato peels are the largest waste generated 
during potato processing. However, they could be a potential source of valuable 
bioactive compounds, such as polyphenols, that can be reused as natural 
antioxidants. Currently, environmentally benign enabling technologies and new 
types of non-toxic organic solvents for the extraction of bioactive compounds 
may dramatically improve the sustainability of these processes. This paper 
focuses on the potential inherent in the valorisation of violet potato peels 
(VPPs) by recovering antioxidants using natural deep eutectic solvents (NaDES) 
under ultrasound (US)- and microwave (MW)-assisted extraction. Both the enabling 
technologies provided performances that were superior to those of conventional 
extractions in terms of antioxidant activity determined by the DPPH· 
(2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) assay. In particular, the most promising 
approach using NaDES is proven to be the acoustic cavitation with a Trolox eq. 
of 1874.0 mmolTE/gExtr (40 °C, 500 W, 30 min), vs. the 510.1 mmolTE/gExtr of 
hydroalcoholic extraction (80 °C, 4 h). The shelf-life of both hydroalcoholic 
and NaDES-VPPs extracts have been assessed over a period of 24 months, and found 
that NaDES granted a 5.6-fold shelf-life extension. Finally, the 
antiproliferative activity of both hydroalcoholic and NaDES-VPPs extracts was 
evaluated in vitro using the MTS assay on human tumour Caco-2 cells and normal 
human keratinocyte cells (HaCaT). In particular, NaDES-VPPs extracts exhibited a 
significantly more pronounced antiproliferative activity compared to the 
ethanolic extracts without a noteworthy difference between effects on the two 
cell lines.

BACKGROUND: Advances in the medical-surgical field have significantly increased 
the life expectancy of patients undergoing solid organ transplantation but this 
exposes patients to long-term complications due to chronic therapies and changes 
in lifestyle. It is known that children affected by pathology tend to be more 
sedentary and inactivity represents a further risk factor for the onset of 
non-communicable diseases. The aim of the present study was to compare the 
lifestyle of two groups of young patients: one group of healthy subjects (HG) 
and one group of kidney or liver transplant recipients (TG).
METHODS: Patients were asked to complete Physical Activity Questionnaire for 
Older Children (PAQ-C).
RESULTS: A total of 104 subjects were recruited (50.9% male, mean age 12.8 ± 
3.16 years old). No significant differences were observed in the final score 
between groups when comparing subjects based on health condition (Healthy 2.69 ± 
0.65 vs. Transplant Group 2.42 ± 0.88), the intensity of sports activities 
(Competitive 2.82 ± 0.59 vs. Not Competitive 2.53 ± 0.7) or type of transplant 
(Liver 2.51 ± 0.91 vs. Kidney 2.16 ± 0.75).
CONCLUSION: The results of this study showed a worrying reality: children are 
engaged in low levels of physical activity regardless of their health status and 
in general the level of activity does not reach the recommended values even in 
the absence of contraindications. So, it is necessary to encourage healthy 
children to practice more PA and to introduce PA prescriptions for transplanted 
children to prevent their health from deteriorating due to sedentariness.

Exploring Older Adults' Willingness to Install Home Surveil-Lance Systems in 
Taiwan: Factors and Privacy Concerns.

Technology, Yunlin 64002, Taiwan.

Taiwan has a rapidly increasing aging population with a considerably high life 
expectancy rate, which poses challenges for healthcare and medical systems. This 
study examines three key factors: safety concerns, family expectations, and 
privacy concerns, and their influence on surveillance system installation 
decisions. A cross-sectional study was conducted involving a group of physically 
active older adults in Taiwan, using a questionnaire to collect data on the 
reasons for in-stalling a surveillance system and preferences for three image 
privacy protection techniques: blurring the face and transformation to a 2D or 
3D character. The study concluded that while safety concerns and family 
expectations facilitate the adoption of surveillance systems, privacy concerns 
serve as a significant barrier. Furthermore, older adults showed a clear 
preference for avatar-based privacy protection methods over simpler techniques, 
such as blurring. The outcomes of this research will be instrumental in shaping 
the development of privacy-conscious home surveillance technologies, adeptly 
balancing safety and privacy. This understanding can pave the way for technology 
design that skillfully balances privacy concerns with remote monitoring quality, 
thereby enhancing the well-being and safety of this demographic. These results 
could possibly be extended to other demographics as well.

To investigate the trend of healthcare needs among elders in low-income 
countries (LICs) and how changes in healthcare access and quality (HAQ) have 
correlated with these changes from 1990 to 2019, this study used estimates from 
the global burden of disease (GBD) 2019 study, including prevalence, years of 
life lost (YLLs), years lived with disability (YLDs), life expectancy (LE), 
health-adjusted life expectancy (HALE) and the HAQ index for years 1990 and 
2019. We found increases in numbers of YLLs, YLDs, and prevalent cases due to 
NCDs, and the rate of increase was higher for all indicators of non-communicable 
diseases (NCDs) when compared with communicable, maternal, neonatal and 
nutritional diseases among elders. We also observed increases in LE and HALE 
among all countries. However, this was also challenged by increases in unhealthy 
life years (ULYs) and their constant percentage of LE. The HAQ index of LICs was 
also found to be low, although it had increased during the period. A reduction 
in the burden of acute diseases explains the increase in LE, but increases in 
ULYs and the NCD burden were also observed. LICs need to improve their HAQ to 
counter the growing threat of longer but less healthy lives.

People living with HIV (PLWH) have an elevated risk of chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease (COPD) and are at a higher risk of asthma and worse outcomes. 
Even though the combination of antiretroviral therapy (cART) has significantly 
improved the life expectancy of HIV-infected patients, it still shows a higher 
incidence of COPD in patients as young as 40 years old. Circadian rhythms are 
endogenous 24 h oscillations that regulate physiological processes, including 
immune responses. Additionally, they play a significant role in health and 
diseases by regulating viral replication and its corresponding immune responses. 
Circadian genes play an essential role in lung pathology, especially in PLWH. 
The dysregulation of core clock and clock output genes plays an important role 
in chronic inflammation and aberrant peripheral circadian rhythmicity, 
particularly in PLWH. In this review, we explained the mechanism underlying 
circadian clock dysregulation in HIV and its effects on the development and 
progression of COPD. Furthermore, we discussed potential therapeutic approaches 
to reset the peripheral molecular clocks and mitigate airway inflammation.

The term "liver disease" refers to any hepatic condition that leads to tissue 
damage or altered hepatic function and can be induced by virus infections, 
autoimmunity, inherited genetic mutations, high consumption of alcohol or drugs, 
fat accumulation, and cancer. Some types of liver diseases are becoming more 
frequent worldwide. This can be related to increasing rates of obesity in 
developed countries, diet changes, higher alcohol intake, and even the 
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic was associated with increased liver 
disease-related deaths. Although the liver can regenerate, in cases of chronic 
damage or extensive fibrosis, the recovery of tissue mass is impossible, and a 
liver transplant is indicated. Because of reduced organ availability, it is 
necessary to search for alternative bioengineered solutions aiming for a cure or 
increased life expectancy while a transplant is not possible. Therefore, several 
groups were studying the possibility of stem cells transplantation as a 
therapeutic alternative since it is a promising strategy in regenerative 
medicine for treating various diseases. At the same time, nanotechnological 
advances can contribute to specifically targeting transplanted cells to injured 
sites using magnetic nanoparticles. In this review, we summarize multiple 
magnetic nanostructure-based strategies that are promising for treating liver 
diseases.

Haemophilia A (HA) and haemophilia B (HB) are X-linked inherited bleeding 
disorders caused by the absence or deficiency of coagulation factors VIII 
(FVIII) and IX (FIX), respectively. Recent advances in the development of 
effective treatments for haemophilia have led to a significant increase in life 
expectancy. As a result, the incidence of some comorbidities, including 
fragility fractures, has increased in people with haemophilia (PWH). The aim of 
our research was to perform a review of the literature investigating the
