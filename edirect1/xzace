BACKGROUND: Controversy continues over whether additional sources of pulmonary 
blood flow are beneficial in combination with a bidirectional cavopulmonary 
anastomosis. We have therefore assessed the effects of additional pulmonary 
blood flow on outcome after bidirectional cavopulmonary anastomosis.
METHODS: From 1996 to 2000, 106 patients underwent bidirectional cavopulmonary 
anastomosis, either isolated (group 1, n = 54), or with additional pulmonary 
blood flow through the pulmonary artery (group 2, n = 30) or a Blalock-Taussig 
shunt (group 3, n = 22).
RESULTS: Superior vena cava syndrome was more frequent in group 2 and less in 
groups 1 and 3 (p < 0.05). Low-output syndrome was more frequent in group 2 and 
less in group 3 (p = 0.01). Repeated-measures analysis of variance showed higher 
oxygen saturations with additional pulmonary blood flow (p < 0.05) and 
significant changes over time (p < 0.0001). Pulmonary pressures, systemic 
ventricular fractional shortening, end-diastolic diameter index, end-diastolic 
pressure, and atrioventricular valve regurgitation remained unaffected by 
additional pulmonary blood flow. Pulmonary artery pressures were lower in group 
2 than 3 (p < 0.05). Fractional shortening (p < 0.05) and atrioventricular valve 
regurgitation (p < 0.0001) changed significantly over time. Fractional 
shortening showed a strong trend toward different changing patterns with or 
without additional pulmonary blood flow (p = 0.055), and atrioventricular valve 
regurgitation showed different changing patterns among the groups (p < 0.005). 
End-diastolic diameter and pulmonary artery dimensions, which were smaller than 
normal, remained unchanged. In logistic regression, smaller body surface area at 
bidirectional cavopulmonary anastomosis, single ventricle, and bidirectional 
cavopulmonary anastomosis with a Blalock-Taussig shunt were associated with 
early death. Actuarial survival including total cavopulmonary connection did not 
differ among groups (p = 0.96).
CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that additional pulmonary blood flow has no adverse 
effect on outcome after cavopulmonary anastomosis. Additional flow through the 
main pulmonary artery offers different advantages and disadvantages concerning 
perioperative complications and pulmonary artery growth compared with additional 
flow through a Blalock-Taussig shunt.

BACKGROUND: Pediatric heart transplantation is a surgical therapy for dilated 
cardiomyopathy and for complex congenital heart defects with low pulmonary 
artery resistance. However, it is still discussed as controversial because of 
uncertain long-term results. We report our experience with pediatric heart 
transplantation in a heterogeneous population.
METHODS: Since 1988, 50 heart transplants were performed in 47 patients (30 with 
dilated cardiomyopathy, 17 with congenital heart disease). Mean age was 9.4 +/- 
6.9 years (range, 4 days to 17.9 years). Twenty-three patients had a total of 36 
previous operations. Clinical outcome was evaluated retrospectively.
RESULTS: Perioperative mortality was 6% due to primary graft failure. Late 
mortality (12%) was caused by acute rejection (n = 2), pneumonia (n = 2), 
intracranial hemorrhage (n = 1), and suicide (n = 1). Mean follow-up was 5.24 
+/- 3.6 years. Actuarial 1, 5, and 10 year survival was 86%, 86%, and 80% and 
improved significantly after 1995 (92% [1 year]; 92% [5 years]). There was no 
significant difference between patients with dilated or congenital heart disease 
(1 year: 86% vs 82%; 5 years: 83% vs 74%; 10 years 83% vs 74%; p = 0.62). Three 
patients with therapy resistant acute or chronic rejection and assisted 
circulation underwent retransplantation and are alive. Freedom from acute 
rejection after 5 years was 40% with primary cyclosporine immunosuppression 
regime and 56% with tacrolimus. Since the introduction of mycophenolate mofetil, 
freedom from acute rejection increased to 62%. All survivors are at home and in 
good cardiac condition.
CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric heart transplantation is the treatment of choice for 
end-stage dilated cardiomyopathy as for congenital heart disease with excellent 
clinical midterm results. It is a valid alternative to reconstructive surgery in 
borderline patients. However, further follow-up is necessary to evaluate the 
long-term side effects of immunosuppressants.

outcomes.

Calafiore AM.

BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to evaluate early and late results of 
reoperative coronary artery bypass grafting compared with those of first 
coronary artery bypass grafting.
METHODS: From November 21, 1994, to December 31, 2001, 4,381 patients underwent 
isolated coronary revascularization: among these patients, 274 (6.3%) underwent 
a redo. Applying the propensity score, 239 redo patients (group R) were matched 
with 239 who underwent the first revascularization (group F).
RESULTS: Early mortality was 2.1% (group F) and 4.2% (group R), not 
significantly different. Group R showed significantly higher creatine kinase 
myocardial band release, length of intensive care unit stay, and incidence of 
incomplete myocardial revascularization than group F. In group R, off-pump 
patients showed higher incidence of incomplete revascularization. Redo was a 
risk factor for abnormal (>19 IU/L) creatine kinase myocardial band release 
(odds ratio, 1.7; p = 0.0066) and incomplete myocardial revascularization (odds 
ratio, 2.4; p = 0.0060). Five-year clinical outcome was significantly worse in 
group R, except for freedom from redo or percutaneous transluminal coronary 
angioplasty. Redo was an independent variable for lower freedom from death of 
any cause, cardiac death, acute myocardial infarction, cardiac events, and any 
event. Patients with higher creatine kinase myocardial band release or 
incomplete myocardial revascularization showed lower freedom from 
cardiac-related events. Incidence of incomplete myocardial revascularization and 
creatine kinase myocardial band release were significantly higher in group R by 
both univariate and multivariate analysis. This could explain the worse late 
outcome of redo patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Complete revascularization without damaging the heart, whichever 
technique is used, is the target of redo surgery, to achieve the same quality of 
results obtained in the first operation.

BACKGROUND: This study compares early results of left anterior descending 
coronary artery stenting using drug-eluting stents (Cypher) with off-pump 
coronary artery bypass grafting (OPCAB).
METHODS: From June 2002 to June 2003, 386 consecutive patients underwent 
myocardial revascularization of the left anterior descending coronary artery 
territory, 130 by Cypher and 256 by OPCAB. After matching for age, sex, and 
extent of coronary artery disease, two groups (each with 94 patients) were used 
to compare the two revascularization modalities. The two groups were similar; 
however, old myocardial infarction and intraaortic balloon pump were more 
prevalent in the OPCAB group, and prior percutaneous transluminal coronary 
angioplasty was more prevalent in the Cypher group.
RESULTS: The number of coronary vessels treated per patient in the two groups 
was similar (1.54 versus 1.34, OPCAB and Cypher, respectively; not significant). 
Mean follow-up was 18 months. Thirty-day mortality was 1% in the OPCAB group and 
0% in the Cypher group. There was one late death in each group. Angina returned 
in 31% of the Cypher group and in 11% of the OPCAB group (p = 0.001). There were 
nine reinterventions in the Cypher group: seven coronary angioplasties 
(including two to the left anterior descending coronary artery) and two surgical 
interventions. There were two reinterventions (percutaneous transluminal 
coronary angioplasty) in the surgical group (p = 0.042).
CONCLUSIONS: Despite the higher risk profile of patients treated with OPCAB, 
their clinical outcome is better. A longer and more complete angiographic 
follow-up is required to determine the role of drug-eluting stents in left 
anterior descending coronary artery revascularization.

for surgical repair?

BACKGROUND: Secondary tricuspid dilatation may or not be accompanied by 
tricuspid regurgitation (TR). Tricuspid dilatation can be objectively measured 
whereas TR can vary according to the preload, afterload, and right ventricular 
function. The purpose of this prospective study was to determine whether 
surgical repair of the tricuspid valve based on tricuspid dilatation rather than 
TR could lead to potential benefits.
METHODS: Between 1989 and 2001, 311 patients underwent mitral valve repair 
(MVR). The tricuspid valve was examined in each patient. Tricuspid annuloplasty 
was performed only if the tricuspid annular diameter was greater than twice the 
normal size (> or = 70 mm) regardless of the grade of regurgitation. Patients in 
group 1 (163 patients; 52.4%) received MVR alone. Patients in group 2 (148 
patients; 47.6%) received MVR plus tricuspid annuloplasty.
RESULTS: Although not significant there was a difference with regard to hospital 
mortality (group 1 = 1.8%, group 2 = 0.7%) and actuarial survival rate 
(Kaplan-Meier: group 1 = 97.3%, 96.2%, and 85.5%; group 2 = 98.5%, 98.5%, and 
90.3% at 3, 5, and 10 years, respectively). The New York Heart Association 
(NYHA) functional class was significantly improved in group 2 (group 1 = 1.59 
+/- 0.84; group 2 = 1.11 +/- 0.31; p1). TR increased by more than two grades in 
48% of the patients in group 1 and in only 2% of the patients in group 2 (p < 
0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Remodeling annuloplasty of the tricuspid valve based on tricuspid 
dilation improves functional status irrespective of the grade of regurgitation. 
Considerable tricuspid dilatation can be present even in the absence of 
substantial TR. Tricuspid dilatation is an ongoing disease process that will, 
with time, lead to severe TR.

Biosciences, University of Tokushima Graduate School, Tokushima, Japan.

BACKGROUND: The thymus or thymoma plays a role in the pathogenesis of myasthenia 
gravis (MG). Although previous studies have reported that the presence of MG in 
thymoma patients is an indicator of poor prognosis, recent reports have shown 
that the presence of MG no longer influences the prognosis or indicates a more 
favorable prognosis in thymoma patients.
METHODS: To clarify the difference in tumor behavior between thymoma with MG and 
that without MG, we compiled 1,089 thymomas treated between 1990 and 1994 from 
115 institutes in Japan and analyzed the clinical characteristics of thymoma 
with MG compared with thymoma without MG.
RESULTS: MG was associated with 270 cases (24.8%) of thymoma. The total 
resection cases comprised 94.6% and 91.4%, and the recurrent cases comprised 
6.4% and 8.3% in the groups with and without MG, respectively. The 5-year 
survival rates for thymoma with and without MG in stage III were 85.7% and 
89.3%, respectively; and those in stage IV were 85.1% and 63.9%, respectively. 
The prognosis of thymoma with MG in stage IV tended to be better than that of 
thymoma without MG (p = 0.0523). The thymoma with MG group had fewer stage IVb 
thymomas than did the thymoma without MG group (15% vs 34%). The resectability 
rate in the thymoma with MG group was higher than that in the thymoma without MG 
group (60% vs 38%).
CONCLUSIONS: Thymoma with MG is equally or less malignant than that without MG. 
The infrequency of stage IVb thymomas and the high resectability rate had an 
influence on the favorable prognosis of stage IV thymoma with MG.

BACKGROUND: Extended pneumonectomy with partial resection of the left atrium for 
lung cancer is not frequently performed; therefore, its results remain 
controversial. The present study analyzed a single center's experience with this 
extended surgery, highlighting the surgery's technical aspects, postoperative 
outcomes, and oncologic results.
METHODS: From November 1996 to December 2003, 15 patients underwent extended 
pneumonectomy with partial resection of the left atrium for lung cancer, without 
cardiopulmonary bypass.
RESULTS: Of the 15 patients (median age of 63 years, range 35 to 74 years), 11 
were men (73%) and 4 were women. Six patients (40%) underwent preoperative 
invasive mediastinal staging. Nine patients (60%) underwent induction 
chemotherapy. Nine patients (60%) underwent right pneumonectomy. Pathologic 
analysis of the specimens identified 8 patients (53%) with N2 disease, 5 
patients (33%) with N1 disease, and 2 patients with N0 disease. The T status was 
T4 in 10 patients, pT3 in 3 patients, and T0 in the remaining 2 patients. The 
were 10 squamous cell carcinomas (60%), 2 adenocarcinomas, 1 adenosquamous 
carcinoma, 1 mucoepidermoid carcinoma, and 1 atypical carcinoid tumor. The 
median intensive care unit and hospital stay were 1 day and 6.4 days, 
respectively. There were only two (15.3%) minor postoperative complications 
(atrial arrhythmias), which were successfully treated medically. There was no 
postoperative mortality. At completion of the study, 9 patients (60%) were still 
alive, with 8 showing no evidence of disease. The remaining 6 patients died 
because of systemic recurrences. The 3-year probability of survival was 39%.
CONCLUSIONS: Extended pneumonectomy with partial resection of the left atrium 
for advanced lung cancer is a feasible procedure, with low postoperative 
morbidity and mortality. In fact, it can lead to excellent local control of the 
disease, if not to a permanent cure in select patients.

BACKGROUND: We assessed the survival rates regarding different stages of 
operable lung cancers causing operable brain metastasis in patients with or 
without cancer-related symptoms. The correlation between survival rates and the 
disease-free interval between lung surgery and metastasectomy was studied.
METHODS: Sixty-five patients were operated on for lung cancer and brain 
metastases. The disease-free interval was divided into 5 subgroups: 0-2 months, 
3-5 months, 6-11 months, 12-23 months, and 24 months and beyond. The study group 
comprised of patients with lung cancer in the following stages: 17 patients in 
stage I (1 patient in stage IA, 16 patients in stage IB), 16 patients in stage 
II (2 patients in stage IIA, 14 patients in stage IIB), 9 patients in stage 
IIIA, 4 patients in stage IIIB, and 19 patients in stage IV. Forty-four patients 
were symptom-free for lung cancer and 21 patients manifested lung cancer related 
symptoms.
RESULTS: The 5-year survival rates were as follows: stage I = 22%, stage II = 
20%, stage IIIA = 22%, stage IIIB = 0%, and stage IV = 23% after lung 
resections. There were no significant differences in the 5-year survival rates 
regarding the disease-free interval subgroups after brain metastasectomies (p = 
0.19): disease-free interval 0-2 months = 22% and disease-free interval 24 
months and beyond = 23%. The 5-year survival rate after metastasectomy was 
significantly greater (26% vs 5%) in patients without lung cancer related 
symptoms (p = 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: The 5-year survival rate in stage I, II, IIIA, and IV lung cancer 
with operable hematogenous brain metastases corresponds to that in the customary 
stage IIIA (23%). The disease-free interval exhibited no significant impact on 
the survival rate. The complaint-free status exhibits a significantly greater 
impact on the survival rate in hematogenic metastasis.

BACKGROUND: Maspin is a serpin protease inhibitor, which is known to suppress 
tumor progression in breast cancer and to be regulated by wild-type p53. This 
study was performed to elucidate the biologic significance of maspin expression 
in non-small cell lung cancer.
METHODS: To investigate whether maspin is involved in progression, 
clinicopathologic features, and prognosis of non-small cell lung cancer, we 
performed an immunohistochemical study using antimaspin antibody and identified 
the presence of maspin messenger ribonucleic acid in cancerous and noncancerous 
tissues by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis. In 
addition, we evaluated p53 expression immunohistochemically on the serial 
sections.
RESULTS: Most adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma showed cytoplasmic 
staining pattern. The cytoplasmic positive rate was 77.8% (42 of 54 specimens) 
for the stage III group, and 36.2% (21 of 58 specimens) for the stage I group (p 
< 0.0001). Three-year survival rates after operation were 30.8% for the 
maspin-positive group and 71.1% for the maspin-negative group (p = 0.007). In 
multivariate analysis, immunohistochemical maspin expression in patients with 
non-small cell lung cancer was an independent prognostic factor for overall 
survival. No correlation between maspin and p53 expression in cancer cells could 
be observed. There was an average fourfold increase in maspin messenger 
ribonucleic acid levels in cancerous tissues compared with those of noncancerous 
tissues, and stage III cases exhibited significantly higher maspin messenger 
ribonucleic acid levels than stage I cases (p = 0.003).
CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that overexpression of maspin in 
cytoplasm may be a useful marker of tumor progression and unfavorable prognosis 
for overall survival in some patients with non-small cell lung cancer. 
Furthermore, maspin expression in cytoplasm appears to be unaffected by p53.

BACKGROUND: In patients undergoing lung resection for non-small cell lung cancer 
(NSCLC), the primary TNM (tumor-regional lymph node-distant metastasis) staging 
system is the best prognostic factor. However, it is necessary to investigate 
other factors that could more accurately predict a patient's prognosis. In this 
study we evaluated the significance of positive intraoperative pre-resectional 
lavage in patients with NSCLC.
METHODS: We enrolled 84 patients (79 men, 5 women) aged between 36 and 81 years 
(mean age, 64.8 years) undergoing a major lung resection for NSCLC, with no 
preoperative evidence of pleural effusions. Intraoperatively, the patients were 
given a pre-resectional pleural lavage with physiologic saline solution. The 
fluid was aspirated and sent to cytology.
RESULTS: Pre-resectional pleural lavage was positive in 19 patients (22.6%). The 
lavage was positive in 7.3% in patients with early stage I disease (3/41) and 
37.2% in patients with stage II/III disease. In the group of 16 patients with 
chest wall neoplastic involvement (T3), 9 had a positive lavage (56.2%; p = 
0.05). No significant correlation was found between positive lavage and nodal 
status, visceral pleural involvement, or histologic findings. Patients with 
malignant cells in the pre-resectional lavage had a significantly shorter 
survival than patients with a negative lavage (p = 0.025).
CONCLUSIONS: A positive cytology finding of intraoperative pre-resectional 
pleural lavage could be an important prognostic factor in patients undergoing 
major lung resection for NSCLC. Patients with a positive lavage should be 
upstaged. However, larger series are needed to define accurately the role of 
this technique in early stage lung cancer.

BACKGROUND: Pulmonary metastasectomy is a standard method of treatment for 
selective pulmonary metastases of colorectal cancer. However, the pathologic 
factors of metastatic lesions that affect survival and tumor recurrence after 
pulmonary resection are less well defined. The pathologic findings of colorectal 
pulmonary metastases have not been correlated with clinical outcome. The study 
was conducted to clarify the characteristics and identify the prognostic factors 
of the pulmonary metastases of colorectal cancer.
METHODS: Between July 1992 and November 2002, 89 patients underwent the complete 
resection of pulmonary metastases of primary colorectal carcinoma, and we 
pathologically reviewed the surgical specimens of 136 metastatic lesions from 
these patients.
RESULTS: There were no perioperative deaths. The overall 5-year survival rate 
was 61.4%. No clinical factors were associated with the outcome. The univariate 
analysis of pathologic factors revealed aerogenous spread with floating cancer 
cell clusters (ASFC) (p = 0.004), vascular invasion (p = 0.002), lymphatic 
invasion (p = 0.032), and pleural invasion (p = 0.037) to be prognostic factors. 
The multivariate analysis showed vascular invasion (p = 0.02) and ASFC (p = 
0.02) to be independent prognostic factors. The 5-year survival rate of patients 
whose lesions were positive for both ASFC and vascular invasion was 24.7% and 
much poorer than in the patients with ASFC without vascular invasion (78.6%), 
vascular invasion but without ASFC (80.2%), and patients negative for both 
(93.3%) (p = 0.0002).
CONCLUSIONS: The morphologic features of ASFC and vascular invasion at 
metastatic sites are prognostic factors for colorectal cancer patients who have 
undergone pulmonary metastasectomy.

BACKGROUND: The long-term outcomes of pulmonary aspergilloma have been known to 
depend on the underlying lung disease. We analyzed the surgical long-term 
outcomes for both simple and complex aspergilloma.
METHODS: From 1981 to 1999, 90 surgical procedures were performed on 88 patients 
with pulmonary aspergilloma. The patients included 44 men and 44 women with a 
median age of 41 years (range, 12 to 69 years). The underlying lung diseases in 
the 72 complex aspergilloma cases were 57 tuberculosis (65%), 14 bronchiectases 
(16%), and 1 emphysema (1.1%). Sixteen (18%) had no underlying lung disease. The 
procedures performed were 52 lobectomies, 33 segmentectomies or wedge 
resections, 3 pneumonectomies, and 2 cavernostomies.
RESULTS: One case of operative mortality (1.1%) occurred in complex 
aspergilloma. Among the other patients, 24 complications developed (27%): 11 
prolonged air leaks (longer than 7 days), 7 persistent spaces, 3 postoperative 
bleedings, 2 empyemas, 2 pneumonias, and 1 wound infection. Risk factor analysis 
revealed old age and complex aspergilloma as significant risk factors for 
postoperative complication. One simple and 13 complex aspergilloma patients died 
during the follow-up period. Only 4 deaths were caused by pulmonary problems. 
The 10-year actuarial survival rates of simple and complex aspergilloma were 
80.0% and 79.6%, respectively. There was no difference between the long-term 
survival of simple and complex aspergilloma.
CONCLUSIONS: Although the postoperative morbidity rate was higher in complex 
aspergilloma, surgical treatment for both simple and complex aspergilloma could 
achieve satisfactory long-term outcomes in selected groups of patients.

Korea.

BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to define more precisely the surgical 
outcome and clinical course of solitary fibrous tumors of the pleura.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of the clinical records of patients 
who had undergone surgical resection for benign and malignant solitary fibrous 
tumors of the pleura during a 10-year period (1993 to 2003).
RESULTS: Sixty-three patients were enrolled in the study (men, 29; women, 34; 
mean age, 49.6 years). Thirty-six patients (57.1%) were symptomatic at the time 
of diagnosis. Resection was performed through a thoracotomy (n = 37), by means 
of video-assisted thoracoscopy (n = 22), or through a sternotomy (n = 4). Mass 
excision only was performed in 34 cases, and en bloc excision including adjacent 
structures was performed in 29 cases. Forty-four cases (69.8%) were benign and 
19 (30.2%) were malignant. Local recurrences occurred in three cases and distant 
metastases in eight. Recurrences occurred only in malignancy. Symptomatic 
presentation and the impression of a nonpleural tumor by imaging study were 
found to be related to a malignant pathologic diagnosis. The radiologic 
impression of solitary fibrous tumors of the pleura was also related to mass 
excision only.
CONCLUSIONS: For malignant cases, complete surgical resection may be 
insufficient for the cure. Therefore, further study should be performed to 
define the role of preoperative and postoperative systemic treatment.

Identifying the factors that contribute to long and healthy life can lead to 
improved interventions that can help delay or prevent the onset of major 
aging-related diseases and disabilities and increase the time that older persons 
spend in good health. Studies on longevity and other exceptional survival 
outcomes can contribute to this knowledge. The National Institute on Aging (NIA) 
supports a considerable amount of basic, behavioral, demographic, epidemiologic, 
and clinical research on these topics, including a large research program on 
longevity assurance genes, primarily in laboratory animals, and in 
biodemographic aspects of longevity in humans and other species. This article 
describes NIA's activities regarding one important aspect of research on 
longevity and related phenotypes: exceptional survival phenotypes in humans, 
including exceptional longevity, health span, and active life expectancy.

Yeast longevity and aging--the mitochondrial connection.

Studies of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae reveal four processes determining 
life span: metabolism, stress resistance, chromatin-dependent gene regulation, 
and genome stability. The retrograde response, which signals mitochondrial 
dysfunction resulting in changes in nuclear gene expression, extends yeast life 
span and is induced during normal aging. This response involves extensive 
metabolic adaptations. The retrograde response links metabolism and genome 
stability during yeast aging. A reduction in the availability of nutrients also 
extends yeast life span. This metabolic mechanism operates by pathways distinct 
from the retrograde response, although it shares with the latter some longevity 
effectors. Life extension by calorie restriction entails re-modeling of 
mitochondrial function. The retrograde response appears to compensate for age 
changes, while calorie restriction may be a preventive mechanism. The 
maintenance of age asymmetry between the mother and daughter yeast cells also 
depends on mitochondrial function. Loss of this age asymmetry occurs during 
normal yeast aging and may be a paradigm for stem cell aging. The importance of 
mitochondrial integrity in yeast longevity is emphasized by the role of 
prohibition function in attenuating oxidative damage. Our studies point to the 
central role of mitochondria in yeast aging. They highlight the importance of 
the maintenance of mitochondrial membrane potential, which drives the transport 
of biosynthetic precursors derived from the Krebs cycle. Common threads weave 
their way through the studies of aging in yeast and in other model organisms. 
This suggests conserved features of aging across phyla.

Strategies to enhance longevity and independent function: the Jerusalem 
Longitudinal Study.

PURPOSE: To analyze the impact of medical and social factors on survival and 
function from age 70 to 82 and point to possible genetic basis for differences.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Longitudinal, cohort study of a representative sample of 
Jerusalem residents, born 1920-1921. At age 70, 463 subjects underwent a 
thorough interview eliciting social determinants as well as a medical history 
and examination and laboratory investigation. At age 77,265 of the survivors, 
71%, were re-examined. In 2002, all death certificates in Israel were reviewed. 
End points were performance of basic and advanced tasks with ease at age 77 and 
survival to age 82 or life span in subjects who had succumbed. The independent 
influence of each factor was tested using logistic regression.
RESULTS: 89.6% of women were alive after 6 years and 77.4% after 12. Survival 
for men was 79.9% and 59.8%, respectively. Social factors predominated in the 
correlation with longer life: financial security, p=.0004; volunteer activity, 
p=.0002; regular exercise, p=.0002; positive self-assessed health, p<.0001; and 
activities of daily living (ADL) independence, p<.0001. Less striking but 
significant correlation for longevity was noted for avoiding naps, p=.04 and 
instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) independence, p=.048. Medical 
conditions associated with increased mortality included diabetes, p<.0001; 
coronary artery disease, p=.0002; impaired vision, p=.0007; and renal 
insufficiency, p=.008. Anemia and disturbed sleep did not independently 
correlate with mortality while the association with hypertension did not reach 
statistical significance, p=.056. In a regression to determine the independent 
impact of medical and social factors on mortality, unimpaired renal function, 
good vision, avoiding afternoon naps, volunteer or compensated work, physical 
activity and IADL independence all correlated with improved survival. Moreover, 
good vision, volunteer work or work for pay and physical activity were 
independently associated with continued ADL independence after 7 years.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight the ability of social, economic and 
functional factors to modify genetic influence on survival and function. 
Increased physical and social activity is an important tool to lengthen the span 
of robust function. The role of heredity in determining function and mortality 
may be expressed through diverse pathways.

Medical Center, Mt. Scopus, Jerusalem.

In an exploratory study, 11 common polymorphisms were examined for contributing 
to longevity including: apolipoprotein E (apoE), methylenetetrahydrofolate 
reductase (MTHFR), cathepsin D (CAD), superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2), 
angiotensinogen (AGT) and insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2), Leiden factor 7, 
p53 oncogene, dopamine D4 receptor (DRD4) and the serotonin transporter (SERT). 
Genotype and allele frequencies of these genes were compared in 224 older (75 
years) Jewish Jerusalem residents of Ashkenazi ethnicity to a group of 441 
younger subjects (22 years). Nominally significant results provide suggestive 
evidence in the Ashkenazi group that apoE, MHTFR, SOD2, IGF2 ApaI, and factor 
VII are risk factors for a single outcome, survival to 75. Overall, the more 
genetically homogenous Ashkenazi ethnic group showed evidence for association in 
five genes examined suggesting that future studies in this population would 
gainfully focus on this ethnic group.

AIM: To estimate the cost-effectiveness ratio of highly-active antiretroviral 
therapy (HAART) in Canada.
DESIGN: A before-and-after analysis to calculate incremental cost of life year 
gained (LYG) between 1991 and 1995 (pre-HAART period) and between 1997 and 2001 
(HAART period) for non-AIDS and AIDS groups (CDC stage of HIV infection).
METHODS: For two Quebec HIV hospital clinics, mean inpatient (IP) days, 
outpatient (OP) visits and direct health care costs per patient-year (PPY) were 
calculated. Cox's proportional hazards models calculated disease progression, 
stratified by study periods and adjusted for gender, age at cohort entry, sexual 
orientation, injecting drug use and baseline CD4 cell count.
RESULTS: For non-AIDS patients, mean IP days was 1.6 (pre-HAART period) compared 
with 0.8 PPY (HAART period); mean OP visits increased from 2.8 to 5.5 PPY. Total 
cost was US$ 4265 (pre-HAART period) and US$ 9445 PPY (HAART period) of which 66 
and 84%, respectively were spent on antiretroviral drugs. Median progression 
time was 6.3 years in the pre-HAART period compared with 12.5 years in HAART 
period (log rank chi = 270, P < 0.0001). Incremental cost per LYG between 
periods was US$ 14 587. For AIDS patients, mean IP days decreased from 13.3 to 
4.4 PPY between periods; OP visits increased from 8.3 to 9.2 PPY. Total costs 
increased from US$ 9099 to US$ 11 754 PPY, while expenditure on antiretroviral 
drugs increased from 29 to 72% of total cost. Median progression time was 3.8 
years in the pre-HAART period, which increased to 13.3 years in the HAART period 
(log rank chi = 158, P < 0.0001); incremental cost per LYG between periods was 
US$ 12 813.
CONCLUSION: HAART appeared a cost-effective intervention in Canada.

Columbia.

BACKGROUND: As antiretrovirals increase the life expectancy of persons living 
with HIV, quality of life issues become more important. Little research has 
examined the types and levels of activity limitations among HIV-positive 
populations. The objective of this report is to compare the levels of 
limitations among HIV-positive persons to the general population.
METHODS: The BC Persons With AIDS (BCPWA) Society consists of approximately 
3,500 HIV-positive members. A recent survey conducted among BCPWA members 
included a section assessing activity limitations. Prevalence of limitations in 
this group was compared to the general population of BC using the National 
Population Health Survey (NPHS) to calculate standardized prevalence ratios 
(SPR).
RESULTS: Compared to the general BC population, BCPWA members were more likely 
to be male, aged over 30 years, not to have graduated from high school, 
unemployed, living alone and having a household income less than $10,000 per 
year. The SPR for activity limitations among male participants applying the 
rates of limitation among the general population of BC was 9.4 (8.4-10.6). The 
SPR for women was 9.9 (7.2-11.1). Using an NPHS rate restricted to individuals 
who reported a chronic condition, the SPR for males was 6.0 (5.9-6.5) and for 
females was 7.0 (5.8-8.2).
INTERPRETATION: Limitations on activity are prevalent, even when comparing those 
with high CD4 counts and restricting the standard to those with chronic 
conditions. These findings suggest that implementation of programs offering 
support with everyday tasks would be of value in this population.

CONTEXTE: Depuis que les antirétroviraux accroissent l’espérance de vie des 
personnes vivant avec le VIH, les questions de qualité de vie prennent de 
l’importance. Or, on a peu étudié le genre et le niveau des restrictions de 
l’activité chez les personnes séropositives pour le VIH. Nous avons voulu 
comparer ces restrictions chez les personnes séropositives aux niveaux qui 
prévalent dans la population générale.
MÉTHODE: La BC Persons With AIDS Society (BCPWA) regroupe quelque 3 500 
personnes séropositives pour le VIH. Une enquête menée récemment auprès des 
membres de cette société comprenait un volet sur les restrictions de l’activité. 
Nous avons comparé la prévalence des restrictions dans ce groupe à la population 
générale de la Colombie-Britannique, en utilisant l’Enquête nationale sur la 
santé de la population (ENSP) pour calculer des ratios de prévalence normalisés 
(RPN).
RÉSULTATS: Par rapport à la population générale de la Colombie-Britannique, les 
membres de la BCPWA étaient plus susceptibles d’être des hommes, d’avoir plus de 
30 ans, de ne pas avoir terminé leurs études secondaires, d’être au chômage, de 
vivre seuls et d’avoir un revenu du ménage inférieur à 10 000 $ par année. Le 
RPN pour les restrictions de l’activité chez les participants de sexe masculin, 
selon les taux de restrictions de la population générale de la 
Colombie-Britannique, était de 9,4 (8,4–10,6). Ce RPN chez les femmes était de 
9,9 (7,2–11,1). Selon le taux de l’ENSP se limitant aux personnes ayant déclaré 
un état chronique, le RPN chez les hommes était de 6,0 (5,9–6,5), et chez les 
femmes, de 7,0 (5,8–8,2).
INTERPRÉTATION: Les restrictions de l’activité sont courantes, même lorsqu’on 
compare les personnes ayant de fortes concentrations de lymphocytes CD4 et qu’on 
se limite aux personnes ayant un état chronique, ce qui porte à croire que la 
mise en œuvre de programmes de soutien aux tâches quotidiennes serait utile dans 
cette population.

Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is not an uncommon but a commonly neglected 
condition by many medical practitioners. It is a disease that threatens not only 
the limb but also life itself! Atherosclerosis is the commonest cause of PAD in 
the western nations. The cardinal symptom is intermittent claudication (IC) but 
majority of the patients are asymptomatic. Ankle-brachial pressure index (ABI) 
is an effective screening tool for PAD. A diminished ABI (< 0.9) is a definite 
sign of PAD. Its prevalence steadily increases with age. In Germany almost a 
fifth of the patients aged over 65 years suffer from it. With increasing life 
expectancy the prevalence of PAD is on the increase. PAD is a manifestation of 
diffuse and severe atherosclerosis. It is a strong marker of cardiovascular 
disease; a very strong association exists between PAD and other atherosclerotic 
disorders such as coronary artery disease (CAD) and cerebrovascular disease 
(CVD). PAD is an independent predictor of high mortality in patients with CAD. 
Smoking, diabetes mellitus and advancing age are the cardinal risk factors. A 
relatively small number of PAD patients lose limbs by amputation. Most paitients 
with PAD die of either heart attacks or strokes and they die of the former 
conditions far earlier than controls. PAD still remains an esoteric disease and 
there is a significant lack of awareness of this condition by many physicians, 
and therefore under-diagnosed and underestimated. Measures to promote awareness 
of PAD among physicians and the society in general are needed. Since most 
patients are asymptomatic and carry potentially significant morbidity and 
mortality risks, screening for PAD should be made a routine practice at primary 
care level.

Clinical progression of incidental, asymptomatic lesions discovered during 
culprit vessel coronary intervention.

Comment in
    Circulation. 2005 Jan 18;111(2):125-6.

BACKGROUND: With the reduction in restenosis rates by drug-eluting stents, there 
is new controversy concerning the optimal management of incidental, nontarget 
lesions identified during percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Such lesions 
have been treated conservatively because of risk of restenosis but now are being 
considered for PCI to prevent plaque instability. However, the impact of 
incidental stenoses on future cardiac events remains unknown.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed a retrospective cohort study to determine the 
rate and features of clinical plaque progression using the National Heart, Lung, 
and Blood Institute Dynamic Registry of consecutive patients undergoing PCI at 
multiple centers in 1997 to 1998 and 1999. Of 3747 PCI patients, 216 (5.8%) 
required additional nontarget lesion PCI for clinical plaque progression at 1 
year. Fifty-nine percent presented with new unstable angina, and 9.3% presented 
with nonfatal myocardial infarction. Patients with multivessel coronary artery 
disease during original PCI were more likely to require nontarget lesion PCI 
during follow-up (adjusted odds ratio, 1.72 [95% CI, 1.18 to 2.52] for 2 
vessels; adjusted odds ratio, 3.37 [95% CI, 2.32 to 4.89] for 3 vessels). 
Angiographic review showed that the majority (86.9%) of lesions requiring 
subsequent PCI were < or =60% in severity during original PCI, with the mean 
lesion stenosis 41.8+/-20.8% at the time of the initial PCI and 83.9+/-13.9% 
during the recurrent event.
CONCLUSIONS: Approximately 6% of PCI patients will have clinical plaque 
progression requiring nontarget lesion PCI by 1 year. Greater coronary artery 
disease burden confers a significantly higher risk for clinical plaque 
progression.

Linear cryoablation of the left atrium versus pulmonary vein cryoisolation in 
patients with permanent atrial fibrillation and valvular heart disease: 
correlation of electroanatomic mapping and long-term clinical results.

BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to clarify the role of pulmonary vein 
isolation (PVI) alone versus left atrial linear lesions in the treatment of 
permanent atrial fibrillation (AF) in patients with left atrial dilatation and 
valvular disease. The primary end point was to assess the persistence of sinus 
rhythm (SR) off antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs) at 2-year follow-up and to correlate 
clinical outcome with surgical results validated with electroanatomic mapping 
(EAM).
METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 105 patients with permanent AF undergoing valve 
surgery were assigned to 3 different groups: in groups "U" and "7," left atrial 
linear cryoablation was performed, whereas in group "PV" patients, anatomic 
cryoisolation of pulmonary veins only was performed. In groups U and 7, SR was 
achieved in 57% of patients, whereas it was achieved in 20% of PV patients 
during 2-year follow-up. In the first 51 patients, the ablation schemes were 
validated with EAM. The EAM showed that the U lesion was never obtained: in 59% 
of these patients, a complete 7 lesion was achieved instead; in the 7 group, a 
complete 7 lesion was present in 65% of patients, whereas a complete PVI was 
obtained in 71% of patients. Considering patients in whom a complete 7 lesion 
was demonstrated with the EAM, SR without AADs was achieved in 86% of patients, 
whereas only 25% of patients with complete PVI were in SR without AADs.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with permanent AF, left atrial dilatation and valvular 
heart disease linear lesions in the posterior region of the left atrium are more 
effective than PVI alone. With cryoablation, the surgical intent is fulfilled in 
only approximately 65% of the cases. Knowing the real anatomic and 
electrophysiological effects of surgical ablation is necessary to correctly 
interpret the clinical outcome.

Medicine, Chiba City, Japan.

The authors prospectively treated 18 consecutive patients with low-grade 
oligodendroglial tumors without postoperative radiotherapy. The treatment 
strategy was as follows: follow-up after total resection and chemotherapy after 
subtotal resection or biopsy. All patients were alive and 17 patients (94%) were 
progression-free after a median follow-up of 4.7 years. The results suggested 
that radiotherapy could be postponed until clinical progression in the treatment 
of low-grade oligodendroglial tumors.

Low- and middle-income countries suffer disproportionately from reduced life 
expectancy and quality of life. Injuries are overlooked as contributors to 
global inequities in health, yet the long-term disabilities they frequently 
produce represent a significant burden. The Fogarty International Center of the 
National Institutes of Health convened a panel of experts in trauma and injury 
from the United States and low- and middle-income nations to identify research
