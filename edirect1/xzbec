Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative illness characterized by various 
non-motor symptoms that may contribute to disability, impaired quality of life 
and shortened life expectancy. The aim of present study was to determine the 
relative prevalence of common non-motor symptoms in various ethnic groups. A 
retrospective chart analysis was performed on Parkinson's disease patients where 
a total of 314 PD patients from six ethnic categories were examined for the 
occurrence of anxiety, visual hallucinations, nocturia, drooling and dementia. 
Our results show that anxiety in PD patients was correlated with their ethnicity 
classification. Interesting trends were observed with respect to nocturia and 
dementia symptoms and no significant differences were found between ethnic 
groups for visual hallucinations and drooling. Our study shows that non-motor 
symptoms of Parkinson's disease are prevalent across all ethnic groups, and 
except anxiety there may not be any impact of ethnicity on dementia, nocturia, 
drooling, and visual hallucinations.

OBJECTIVE: To rank pollutants in two Nigerian water supply schemes according to 
their effect on human health using a risk-based approach.
METHODS: Hazardous pollutants in drinking-water in the study area were 
identified from a literature search and selected pollutants were monitored from 
April 2010 to December 2011 in catchments, treatment works and consumer taps. 
The disease burden due to each pollutant was estimated in disability-adjusted 
life years (DALYs) using data on the pollutant's concentration, exposure to the 
pollutant, the severity of its health effects and the consumer population.
FINDINGS: The pollutants identified were microbial organisms, cadmium, cobalt, 
chromium, copper, iron, manganese, nickel, lead and zinc. All were detected in 
the catchments but only cadmium, cobalt, chromium, manganese and lead exceeded 
World Health Organization (WHO) guideline values after water treatment. 
Post-treatment contamination was observed. The estimated disease burden was 
greatest for chromium in both schemes, followed in decreasing order by cadmium, 
lead, manganese and cobalt. The total disease burden of all pollutants in the 
two schemes was 46 000 and 9500 DALYs per year or 0.14 and 0.088 DALYs per 
person per year, respectively, much higher than the WHO reference level of 1 × 
10(-6) DALYs per person per year. For each metal, the disease burden exceeded 
the reference level and was comparable with that due to microbial contamination 
reported elsewhere in Africa.
CONCLUSION: The estimated disease burden of metal contamination of two Nigerian 
water supply systems was high. It could best be reduced by protection of water 
catchment and pretreatment by electrocoagulation.

Publisher: OBJECTIF: Classer les polluants dans deux systèmes nigérians 
d'approvisionnement en eau en fonction de leur effet sur la santé humaine, en 
utilisant une approche fondée sur le risque.
MÉTHODES: Dans la zone d'étude, les polluants dangereux dans l'eau potable ont 
été identifiés grâce à une recherche documentaire, et certains polluants ont été 
suivis d'avril 2010 à décembre 2011 dans des bassins versants, des installations 
de traitement et au robinet des consommateurs. La charge de morbidité due à 
chaque polluant a été estimée en années de vie ajustées sur l'incapacité (DALY) 
à l'aide des données relatives à la concentration des polluants, l'exposition 
aux polluants, la gravité de leurs effets sur la santé et la population des 
consommateurs.
RÉSULTATS: Les polluants identifiés étaient des organismes microbiens, le 
cadmium, le cobalt, le chrome, le cuivre, le fer, le manganèse, le nickel, le 
plomb et le zinc. Tous ont été détectés dans les bassins versants, mais seuls le 
cadmium, le cobalt, le chrome, le manganèse et le plomb dépassaient les valeurs 
indicatives de l'Organisation mondiale de la Santé (OMS) après traitement de 
l'eau. Une contamination postérieure au traitement a été observée. Selon les 
estimations, la charge de morbidité la plus lourde résultait du chrome dans les 
deux systèmes, suivi par le cadmium, le plomb, le manganèse et le cobalt, par 
ordre décroissant. La charge de morbidité totale de tous les polluants des deux 
systèmes était de 46 000 et 9500 DALY par an ou de 0,14 et 0,088 DALY par 
personne et par an, respectivement. Elle était donc beaucoup plus élevée que le 
niveau de référence de l'OMS, soit 1×10−6 DALY par personne et par an. Pour 
chaque métal, la charge de morbidité dépassait le niveau de référence et était 
comparable à celle due à la contamination microbienne signalée ailleurs en 
Afrique.
CONCLUSION: Les estimations de la charge de morbidité de la contamination 
métallique des deux systèmes nigérians d'approvisionnement en eau étaient 
élevées. Les meilleures façons de réduire la charge de morbidité seraient la 
protection du bassin versant et le prétraitement par électrocoagulation.

Publisher: OBJETIVO: Clasificar los contaminantes de dos sistemas de suministro 
de agua de Nigeria en función de su efecto sobre la salud humana a través de un 
enfoque basado en el riesgo.
MÉTODOS: Se identificaron los contaminantes peligrosos presentes en el agua 
potable del área de estudio mediante una investigación bibliográfica y entre 
abril de 2010 y diciembre de 2011 se controlaron los contaminantes seleccionados 
en las cuencas, las plantas de tratamiento y los grifos de los consumidores. Se 
calculó la carga de morbilidad causada por cada contaminante en años de vida 
ajustados por discapacidad (AVAD) a partir de los datos de la concentración del 
contaminante, la exposición al mismo, la gravedad de sus efectos sobre la salud 
y la población de consumidores.
RESULTADOS: Los contaminantes identificados fueron organismos microbianos, 
cadmio, cobalto, cromo, cobre, hierro, manganeso, níquel, plomo y zinc. Todos 
los contaminantes fueron detectados en las cuencas, pero sólo las cantidades de 
cadmio, cobalto, cromo, manganeso y plomo superaron los valores de referencia de 
la Organización Mundial de la Salud de (OMS) después del tratamiento del agua. 
Se observó una contaminación posterior al tratamiento. La carga estimada de la 
enfermedad fue mayor para el cromo en ambos esquemas, seguido en orden 
decreciente por el cadmio, plomo, manganeso y cobalto. La carga total de la 
enfermedad de todos los contaminantes en los dos sistemas fue, respectivamente, 
de 46 000 y 9500 AVAD por año o 0,14 y 0,088 AVAD por persona y año, muy por 
encima del nivel de referencia de la OMS de 1 × 10 − 6 AVAD por persona y año. 
La carga de morbilidad para cada metal superó el nivel de referencia y fue 
comparable con aquella por contaminación microbiana evidenciada en otras partes 
de África.
CONCLUSIÓN: La carga de morbilidad estimada de la contaminación por metales de 
dos sistemas de suministro de agua nigerianos fue alta. La mejor forma para 
reducir la carga de morbilidad sería la protección de la captación de agua y el 
tratamiento previo mediante electrocoagulación.

Publisher: الغرض: ترتيب الملوثات في مخططين لإمدادات المياه في نيجيريا وفقاً 
لتأثيرها على صحة الإنسان باستخدام نهج قائم على المخاطر.
الطريقة: تم تحديد الملوثات الخطرة في مياه الشرب في منطقة الدراسة من الأبحاث 
المنشورة وتم رصد الملوثات المحددة في الفترة من نيسان/أبريل 2010 إلى كانون 
الأول/ديسمبر 2011 في مستجمعات المياه ومحطات المعالجة وصنابير المستهلكين. وتم 
تقدير عبء المرض الناتج عن كل ملوث بالنسبة لسنوات العمر المصححة باحتساب مدد العجز 
باستخدام البيانات المعنية بتركيز الملوث والتعرض للملوث وخطورة آثاره الصحية 
والفئات السكانية للمستهلكين.
النتائج: كانت الملوثات التي تم تحديدها عبارة عن كائنات عضوية جرثومية والكادميوم 
والكوبلت والكروم والنحاس والحديد والمنغنيز والنيكل والرصاص والزنك. وتم اكتشافها 
جميعاً في مياه المستجمعات ولكن لم يتعدى قيم المبدأ التوجيهي لمنظمة الصحة 
العالمية بعد معالجة المياه سوى الكادميوم والكوبلت والكروم والمنغنيز والرصاص. 
ولوحظ وجود تلوث بعد معالجة المياه. وكان أكبر عبء للمرض وفق التقديرات في الكروم 
في كلا المخططين، يليه تنازلياً الكادميوم والرصاص والمنغنيز والكوبلت. وكان إجمالي 
عبء المرض لجميع الملوثات في المخططين 46000 و9500 سنة من سنوات العمر المصححة 
باحتساب مدد العجز لكل سنة أو 0.14 و0.088 سنة من سنوات العمر المصححة باحتساب مدد 
العجز لكل شخص سنوياً، على التوالي، وهو ما يزيد بشدة عن المستوى المرجعي للمنظمة 
1× 10 −6 سنة من سنوات العمر المصححة باحتساب مدد العجز لكل شخص سنوياً. وبالنسبة 
لكل معدن، تعدى عبء المرض المستوى المرجعي وكان من الممكن مقارنته بذلك الناتج عن 
التلوث الجرثومي الذي تم الإبلاغ عنه في مناطق أخرى في أفريقيا.
الاستنتاج: كان عبء المرض الناجم عن تلوث المعادن في نظامين من نظم إمدادات المياه 
في نيجيريا وفق التقديرات مرتفعاً. ويمكن تقليله على الوجه الأمثل من خلال حماية 
مستجمعات المياه والمعالجة المسبقة عن طريق التخثير الكهربي.

Publisher: 目的: 根据对人体健康的影响,使用基于风险的方法,对尼日利亚两个供水方案的污染物进行评级。
方法: 从文献检索中确定研究区域饮用水中的有害污染物,监测2010 年4 月到2011 年12 
月集水区、污水处理厂和消费者的水龙头的选定污染物。使用污染物浓度、污染物接触、健康影响严重程度和消费者人群的相关数据以伤残调整寿命年(DALY)为单位估计每个污染物造成的疾病负担。
结果: 
确定的污染物有微生物、镉、钴、铬、铜、铁、锰、镍、铅和锌。所有污染物在集水区检测,但仅镉、钴、铬、锰、铅在水处理之后超过世界卫生组织(WHO)指导值。观察处理后污染物。在两个方案中,铬的估计疾病负担最大,然后按递减顺序依次是镉、铅、锰和钴。在两个方案中,所有污染物的合计疾病负担分别是每年4.6 
万和9500 DALY,或者每年每人0.14 和0.088 DALY,比世界卫生组织的每年每人1 × 10-6 
DALY的参考水平高很多。对于每种金属,疾病负担均超过参考水平,与非洲其他地方报告的微生物污染造成的疾病负担相当。
结论: 尼日利亚两个供水方案的金属污染物估计疾病负担较高。保护集水区和电絮凝法预处理可能是减少污染的最佳方法。

Publisher: ЦЕЛЬ: Осуществить ранжирование загрязняющих веществ в двух 
нигерийских системах водоснабжения по степени их влияния на здоровье человека с 
использованием риск-ориентированного подхода.
МЕТОДЫ: Опасные загрязняющие вещества в питьевой воде в исследуемом районе 
идентифицировались с помощью поиска литературы, а мониторинг отдельных 
загрязняющих веществ осуществлялся с апреля 2010 года по декабрь 2011 года в 
водосборных бассейнах, очистных сооружениях и кранах потребителей. Бремя 
заболеваний, обусловленное каждым загрязняющим веществом, оценивалось в 
скорректированных на нетрудоспособность годах жизни (ДАЛИ) с использованием 
данных о концентрации загрязняющего вещества, воздействии данного загрязняющего 
вещества, тяжести его последствий для здоровья и популяции потребителей.
РЕЗУЛЬТАТЫ: Были идентифицированы следующие загрязняющие вещества: 
микроорганизмы, кадмий, кобальт, хром, медь, железо, марганец, никель, свинец и 
цинк. Все они были обнаружены в водосборных бассейнах, однако только содержание 
кадмия, кобальта, хрома, марганца и свинца превысило нормативные значения, 
установленные Всемирной организацией здравоохранения (ВОЗ) для воды, прошедшей 
обработку. Было обнаружено присутствие загрязняющих веществ после обработки. В 
обеих системах расчетное бремя болезней было максимальным для хрома, а затем в 
порядке убывания следовали кадмий, свинец, марганец и кобальт. Общее бремя 
болезней всех загрязняющих веществ в двух системах составило 46 000 и 9500 ДАЛИ 
в год, или 0,14 и 0,088 ДАЛИ на человека в год, соответственно, что намного 
выше, чем контрольный уровень ВОЗ, равный 1×10−6 ДАЛИ на человека в год. Для 
каждого металла бремя болезней превысило контрольный уровень и было сопоставимо 
с влиянием микробного загрязнения, наблюдаемого в других странах Африки.
ВЫВОД: Расчетное бремя болезней в результате загрязнения металлами воды в двух 
нигерийских системах водоснабжения было высоким. Лучшим способом его снижения 
является защита водосборов и предварительная обработка воды методом 
электрокоагуляции.

C-src enriched serum microvesicles are generated in malignant plasma cell 
dyscrasia.

Plasma cell dyscrasias are immunosecretory disorders that can lead to 
hematological malignancies such as Multiple Myeloma (MM). MM accounts for 15% of 
all hematologic cancers, and those diagnosed with MM typically become severely 
ill and have a low life expectancy. Monoclonal immunoglobulin Free Light Chains 
(FLC) are present in the serum and urine of many patients with plasma cell 
diseases. The biological differences between monoclonal FLCs, produced under 
malignant or benign dyscrasias, has not yet been characterized. In the present 
study, we show that endothelial and heart muscle cell lines internalize kappa 
and lambda FLCs. After internalization, FLCs are rerouted in the extracellular 
space via microvesicles and exosomes that can be re-internalized in contiguous 
cells. Only FLCs secreted from malignant B Lymphocytes were carried in Hsp70, 
annexin V, and c-src positive vesicles. In both MM and AL Amyloidosis patients 
we observed an increase in microvesicle and exosome production. Isolated serum 
vesicles from MM, AL Amyloidosis and monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined 
significance (MGUS) patients contained FLCs. Furthermore MM and AL amyloidosis 
vesicles were strongly positive for Hsp70, annexin V, and c-src compared to MGUS 
and control patients. These are the first data implying that FLCs reroute via 
microvesicles in the blood stream, and also suggest a potential novel mechanism 
of c-src activation in plasma cell dyscrasia.

A cost-utility analysis of lung cancer screening and the additional benefits of 
incorporating smoking cessation interventions.

BACKGROUND: A 2011 report from the National Lung Screening Trial indicates that 
three annual low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) screenings for lung cancer 
reduced lung cancer mortality by 20% compared to chest X-ray among older 
individuals at high risk for lung cancer. Discussion has shifted from clinical 
proof to financial feasibility. The goal of this study was to determine whether 
LDCT screening for lung cancer in a commercially-insured population (aged 50-64) 
at high risk for lung cancer is cost-effective and to quantify the additional 
benefits of incorporating smoking cessation interventions in a lung cancer 
screening program.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: The current study builds upon a previous simulation model 
to estimate the cost-utility of annual, repeated LDCT screenings over 15 years 
in a high risk hypothetical cohort of 18 million adults between age 50 and 64 
with 30+ pack-years of smoking history. In the base case, the lung cancer 
screening intervention cost $27.8 billion over 15 years and yielded 985,284 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained for a cost-utility ratio of $28,240 
per QALY gained. Adding smoking cessation to these annual screenings resulted in 
increases in both the costs and QALYs saved, reflected in cost-utility ratios 
ranging from $16,198 per QALY gained to $23,185 per QALY gained. Annual LDCT 
lung cancer screening in this high risk population remained cost-effective 
across all sensitivity analyses.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study indicate that repeat annual lung cancer 
screening in a high risk cohort of adults aged 50-64 is highly cost-effective. 
Offering smoking cessation interventions with the annual screening program 
improved the cost-effectiveness of lung cancer screening between 20% and 45%. 
The cost-utility ratios estimated in this study were in line with other accepted 
cancer screening interventions and support inclusion of annual LDCT screening 
for lung cancer in a high risk population in clinical recommendations.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the association of lipoprotein and 
triglyceride levels with all-cause mortality in a population free from diabetes 
and cardiovascular disease (CVD) at baseline. The European Guidelines on 
cardiovascular disease prevention state that in general total cholesterol (TC) 
should be < 5 mmol/L (190 mg/dL) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) 
should be < 3 mmol/L (115 mg/dL).
DESIGN: A population-based register study in the period 1999-2007 including 118 
160 subjects aged 50 + without statin use at baseline. All-cause mortality was 
related to lipoprotein and triglyceride levels and adjusted for statin use after 
inclusion.
RESULTS: All-cause mortality was lower in the groups with TC or LDL-C above the 
recommended levels. Compared with subjects with TC < 5 mmol/L, adjusted hazard 
ratios for the group aged 60-70 years ranged from 0.68 (95% confidence interval 
(CI) 0.61-0.77) for TC 5-5.99 mmol/L to 0.67 (95% CI 0.59-0.75) for TC 6-7.99 
mmol/L and 1.02 (95% CI 0.68-1.53) for TC ≥ 8 mmol/L in males and from 0.57 (95% 
CI 0.48-0.67) to 0.59 (95% CI 0.50-0.68) and 1.02 (95% CI: 0.77-1.37) in 
females. For triglycerides, ratios compared with the group < 1 mmol/L in the 
females aged 60-70 years ranged from 1.04 (95% CI 0.88-1.23) to 1.35 (95% CI 
1.10-1.66) and 1.25 (95% CI 1.05-1.48) for triglycerides 1-1.39 mmol/L, 1.4-1.69 
mmol/L, and ≥ 1.7 mmol/L, respectively. Statin treatment after inclusion 
provided a survival benefit.
CONCLUSION: These associations indicate that high lipoprotein levels do not seem 
to be definitely harmful in the general population. However, high triglyceride 
levels in females are associated with decreased survival.

randomised controlled trial comparing exercise into hypermobile versus neutral 
knee extension.

BACKGROUND: Knee pain in children with Joint Hypermobility Syndrome (JHS) is 
traditionally managed with exercise, however the supporting evidence for this is 
scarce. No trial has previously examined whether exercising to neutral or into 
the hypermobile range affects outcomes. This study aimed to (i) determine if a 
physiotherapist-prescribed exercise programme focused on knee joint strength and 
control is effective in reducing knee pain in children with JHS compared to no 
treatment, and (ii) whether the range in which these exercises are performed 
affects outcomes.
METHODS: A prospective, parallel-group, randomised controlled trial conducted in 
a tertiary hospital in Sydney, Australia compared an 8 week exercise programme 
performed into either the full hypermobile range or only to neutral knee 
extension, following a minimum 2 week baseline period without treatment. 
Randomisation was computer-generated, with allocation concealed by sequentially 
numbered opaque sealed envelopes. Knee pain was the primary outcome. Quality of 
life, thigh muscle strength, and function were also measured at (i) initial 
assessment, (ii) following the baseline period and (iii) post treatment. 
Assessors were blinded to the participants' treatment allocation and 
participants blinded to the difference in the treatments.
RESULTS: Children with JHS and knee pain (n=26) aged 7-16 years were randomly 
assigned to the hypermobile (n=12) or neutral (n=14) treatment group. 
Significant improvements in child-reported maximal knee pain were found 
following treatment, regardless of group allocation with a mean 14.5 mm 
reduction on the visual analogue scale (95% CI 5.2 - 23.8 mm, p=0.003). 
Significant differences between treatment groups were noted for parent-reported 
overall psychosocial health (p=0.009), specifically self-esteem (p=0.034), 
mental health (p=0.001) and behaviour (p=0.019), in favour of exercising into 
the hypermobile range (n=11) compared to neutral only (n=14). Conversely, 
parent-reported overall physical health significantly favoured exercising only 
to neutral (p=0.037). No other differences were found between groups and no 
adverse events occurred.
CONCLUSIONS: Parents perceive improved child psychosocial health when children 
exercise into the hypermobile range, while exercising to neutral only is 
perceived to favour the child's physical health. A physiotherapist prescribed, 
supervised, individualised and progressed exercise programme effectively reduces 
knee pain in children with JHS.

Due to increased life expectancy in a growing world population, the impact of 
ageing on the pathophysiology of cardiovascular diseases will increase. 
Therefore, a better understanding of age-related biological changes is important 
and necessary to combat cardiovascular diseases in the future. microRNAs (miRs) 
are small non coding RNAs emerging as key regulator in several vascular 
pathologies such as atherosclerosis or hypertension, which show a clear 
association with increasing age. This review discusses the involvement of miRs 
in several age-associated pathologies such as oxidative stress, vascular 
inflammation, vascular tension, endothelial cell senescence and impaired 
angiogenesis.

BACKGROUND: Liraglutide 3.0 mg, with diet and exercise, produced substantial 
weight loss over 1 year that was sustained over 2 years in obese non-diabetic 
adults. Nausea was the most frequent side effect.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate routinely collected data on nausea and vomiting among 
individuals on liraglutide and their influence on tolerability and body weight.
DESIGN: A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind 20-week study with an 
84-week extension (sponsor unblinded at 20 weeks, open-label after 1 year) in 
eight European countries (Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT00422058).
SUBJECTS: After commencing a 500-kcal/day deficit diet plus exercise, 564 
participants (18-65 years, body mass index (BMI) 30-40 kg m(-2)) were randomly 
assigned (after a 2-week run-in period) to once-daily subcutaneous liraglutide 
(1.2, 1.8, 2.4 or 3.0 mg), placebo or open-label orlistat (120 mg × 3 per day). 
After 1 year, participants on liraglutide/placebo switched to liraglutide 
2.4 mg, and subsequently, to liraglutide 3.0 mg (based on 20-week and 1-year 
results, respectively).
RESULTS: The intention-to-treat population comprised 561 participants (n=90-98 
per arm, age 45.9±10.3 years, BMI 34.8±2.7 kg m(-2) (mean±s.d.)). In year 1, 
more participants reported ⩾1 episode of nausea/vomiting on treatment with 
liraglutide 1.2-3.0 mg (17-38%) than with placebo or orlistat (both 4%, 
P⩽0.001). Most episodes occurred during dose escalation (weeks 1-6), with 'mild' 
or 'moderate' symptoms. Among participants on liraglutide 3.0 mg, 48% reported 
some nausea and 13% some vomiting, with considerable variation between 
countries, but only 4 out of 93 (4%) reported withdrawals. The mean 1-year 
weight loss on treatment with liraglutide 3.0 mg from randomization was 9.2 kg 
for participants reporting nausea/vomiting episodes, versus 6.3 kg for those 
with none (a treatment difference of 2.9 kg (95% confidence interval 0.5-5.3); 
P=0.02). Both weight losses were significantly greater than the respective 
weight losses for participants on placebo (P<0.001) or orlistat (P<0.05). 
Quality-of-life scores at 20 weeks improved similarly with or without 
nausea/vomiting on treatment with liraglutide 3.0 mg.
CONCLUSION: Transient nausea and vomiting on treatment with liraglutide 3.0 mg 
was associated with greater weight loss, although symptoms appeared tolerable 
and did not attenuate quality-of-life improvements. Improved data collection 
methods on nausea are warranted.

PURPOSE: As palliative care further integrates into cancer care, descriptions of 
how supportive care quality measures improve patient outcomes are necessary to 
establish best practices.
METHODS: We assessed the relationship between conformance to 18 palliative care 
quality measures and quality of life from data obtained using our novel 
point-of-care, electronic quality monitoring system, the Quality Data Collection 
Tool for Palliative Care (QDACT-PC). All patients with cancer from January 2008 
through March 2011 seen in the Carolinas Palliative Care Consortium were 
evaluated for demographic, disease, prognostic, performance status, and measure 
conformance variables. Using univariate and multivariate regression, we examined 
the relationship between these variable and high quality of life at the initial 
specialty palliative care consultation.
RESULTS: Our cohort included 459 patients, the majority of whom were over age 65 
years (66%) and white (84%). Lung (29.1%) and GI (24.7%) cancers were most 
common. In univariate analyses, conformance to assessment of comprehensive 
symptoms, fatigue and constipation assessment, timely management of pain and 
constipation, and timely emotional well-being assessment were associated with 
highest levels of quality of life (all Ps < .05). In a multivariate model 
(C-stat = 0.66), performance status (odds ratio [OR], 5.21; P = .003), estimated 
life expectancy (OR, 22.6; P = .003), conformance to the measure related to 
emotional well-being assessment (OR, 1.60; P = .026), and comprehensive 
screening of symptoms (OR, 1.74, P = .008) remained significant.
CONCLUSION: Oncology care pathways that routinely incorporate supportive care 
principles, such as comprehensive symptom and emotional well-being assessments, 
may improve patient outcomes.

CA, USA.

Targeted reciprocal aiming movements are pervasive in everyday life, but it is 
unclear how the timing parameters between task elements affect the preparation 
of these movements. This study used a loud (124 dB) startling acoustic stimulus 
(SAS) to probe how changes in the pause time between the outward and return 
components of a reciprocal aiming task affected the preparatory state of the 
motor system. Participants performed a visually guided wrist extension-flexion 
task to a target located at 20° from the start position and were instructed to 
pause the movement within the wrist extension target zone for either 50, 200, or 
500 ms. A SAS was presented during 25 % of trials before either the onset of the 
wrist extension (out) or flexion (return) components of the task to determine 
how motor preparation was affected by task requirements. Results showed that the 
presentation of a SAS prior to the initial outward movement led to significantly 
earlier onsets of both the outward and return components (p < .05), indicating 
that the pause time in the planned action was pre-planned. For the longer (200, 
500 ms) pause-time conditions, a SAS delivered prior to returning from the 
target region triggered the return portion of the movement early. These findings 
suggest that the shortest pause-time movement (50 ms) was preplanned as a single 
action, whereas for reciprocal movements with longer pause times at least the 
initial part of the movement and the timing of the pause were preplanned and 
integrated, while the return portion was more independent.

Thirty down, only ten to go?! Awareness and influence of a 10-year time frame in 
TTO.

Rotterdam, The Netherlands.

BACKGROUND: Time trade-off (TTO) exercises typically present respondents with a 
limited time horizon, for example 10 years, thus implicitly considerably 
reducing remaining life expectancy for the average respondent. It is unclear how 
this affects health state valuations.
AIM: The aim of the study is to investigate how awareness of the reduced life 
span implied by a 10-year TTO affects health state valuations, using an 
experimental design.
METHODS: Two Web-based questionnaires (Q1 and Q2) were administered in a sample 
representative of the Dutch population. Both questionnaires contained three 
10-year TTO exercises valuing three distinct health states, specified using the 
EQ-5D. Q1 used a TTO instruction not explicitly emphasizing the fact that 
remaining life expectancy was reduced to 10 years, while in Q2 respondents were 
explicitly made aware of this fact by emphasizing their implied age of death. 
Respondents answering Q1 were asked retrospectively whether they had been aware 
of their reduced life span due to the 10-year TTO.
RESULTS: In total, 656 respondents completed the questionnaires (Q1: 339 and Q2: 
317). The average age of the respondents was 43 years and 51 % of respondents 
were male. The average numbers of years traded off for the respondents of Q1 
were for TTO1 0.443, TTO2 0.552, and TTO3 2.083 years. For the respondents of 
Q2, these averages were lower, i.e., TTO1 0.401 (p = 0.085 vs. Q1), TTO2: 0.546 
(p = 0.036 vs. Q1), and TTO3: 1.467 years (p = 0.000 vs. Q1). Fifty-seven 
percent of respondents in Q1 confirmed that they were aware of the reduced life 
span. This spontaneous awareness had a limited and mixed influence on results. 
The generalized negative binomial regression analysis, explaining the time 
traded off showed that age, subjective life expectancy, and questionnaire Q2 
(vs. Q1) were negatively associated with the years traded off, whereas education 
and worse health states in the TTO exercise had a significant positive impact on 
the years traded off. The probit model investigating the impact on the 
willingness to trade showed that age (-), education (+), subjective life 
expectancy (-), questionnaire Q2 versus Q1 (-), the interaction between Q2 and 
male gender (+), and worse health states in the TTO exercise (+) had a 
significant impact on the willingness to trade.
CONCLUSION: These findings emphasize the importance of expected and implied life 
expectancy in TTOs.

Persons with schizophrenia have a reduced life expectancy largely due to death 
from natural causes. Factors that have been previously associated with excess 
mortality include cigarette smoking and antipsychotic medication. The role of 
other environmental factors such as exposure to infectious agents has been the 
subject of only limited investigation. We prospectively assessed a cohort of 
persons with schizophrenia with a clinical evaluation and a blood sample from 
which antibodies to human herpes viruses and Toxoplasma gondii were measured. 
Mortality was determined with data from the National Death Index following a 
period of up to 11 years. We examined the role of demographic, serological, and 
clinical factors on mortality. A total of 25 (5%) of 517 persons died of natural 
causes. The standardized mortality ratio was 2.80 (95% CI 0.89, 6.38). After 
adjusting for age and gender, mortality from natural causes was predicted in 
separate models by cigarette smoking (relative risk [RR] = 4.66, P = .0029); 
lower cognitive score (RR = 0.96, P = .013); level of antibodies to Epstein-Barr 
virus (RR = 1.22, P = .0041) and to Herpes Simplex virus type 1 (RR = 1.19, P = 
.030); immunologic disease (RR = 3.14, P = .044); and genitourinary disease (RR 
= 2.70; P = .035). Because cigarette smoking confers an almost 5-fold risk of 
mortality, smoking cessation is an urgent priority. Having an elevated level of 
antibodies to Epstein-Barr virus and to Herpes Simplex virus type 1 are also 
significant predictors of death from natural causes.

The cost-effectiveness of using financial incentives to improve provider 
quality: a framework and application.

University of Manchester, UK.

Despite growing adoption of pay-for-performance (P4P) programmes in health care, 
there is remarkably little evidence on the cost-effectiveness of such schemes. 
We review the limited number of previous studies and critique the frameworks 
adopted and the narrow range of costs and outcomes considered, before proposing 
a new more comprehensive framework, which we apply to the first P4P scheme 
introduced for hospitals in England. We emphasise that evaluations of 
cost-effectiveness need to consider who the residual claimant is on any cost 
savings, the possibility of positive and negative spillovers, and whether 
performance improvement is a transitory or investment activity. Our application 
to the Advancing Quality initiative demonstrates that the incentive payments 
represented less than half of the £ 13 m total programme costs. By generating 
approximately 5200 quality-adjusted life years and £ 4.4 m of savings in reduced 
length of stay, we find that the programme was a cost-effective use of resources 
in its first 18 months.

Activation of protein kinase C-mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling in 
response to inositol starvation triggers Sir2p-dependent telomeric silencing in 
yeast.

Depriving wild type yeast of inositol, a soluble precursor for phospholipid, 
phosphoinositide, and complex sphingolipid synthesis, activates the protein 
kinase C (PKC)-MAPK signaling pathway, which plays a key role in the activation 
of NAD(+)-dependent telomeric silencing. We now report that triggering PKC-MAPK 
signaling by inositol deprivation or by blocking inositol-containing 
sphingolipid synthesis with aureobasidin A results in increased telomeric 
silencing regulated by the MAPK, Slt2p, and the NAD(+)-dependent deacetylase, 
Sir2p. Consistent with the dependence on NAD(+) in Sir2p-regulated silencing, we 
found that inositol depletion induces the expression of BNA2, which is required 
for the de novo synthesis of NAD(+). Moreover, telomeric silencing is greatly 
reduced in bna2Δ and npt1Δ mutants, which are defective in de novo and salvage 
pathways for NAD(+) synthesis, respectively. Surprisingly, however, omitting 
nicotinic acid from the growth medium, which reduces cellular NAD(+) levels, 
leads to increased telomeric silencing in the absence of inositol and/or at high 
temperature. This increase in telomeric silencing in response to inositol 
starvation is correlated to chronological life span extension but is 
Sir2p-independent. We conclude that activation of the PKC-MAPK signaling by 
interruption of inositol sphingolipid synthesis leads to increased 
Sir2p-dependent silencing and is dependent upon the de novo and salvage pathways 
for NAD(+) synthesis but is not correlated with cellular NAD(+) levels.

Given the emerging global childhood obesity epidemic and the specter of a 
generation of children who will have a shorter life expectancy than that of 
their parents, recent research has focused on factors that influence children's 
weight status and obesogenic behaviors (i.e., eating, physical activity, and 
screen media use). Parents act as primary socializing agents for children, and 
thus growing evidence supports the role of parenting styles and practices in 
children's obesity-related behaviors and weight. Studying these processes in 
children and adolescents is important for several reasons. First, diet and 
physical activity behaviors and weight status track from childhood and 
adolescence into adulthood. Furthermore, diet and physical activity behaviors 
and weight status confer significant risk for cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular 
disease, and other chronic diseases. The purpose of this article is to describe 
the scientific gaps that need to be addressed to develop a more informed 
literature on parenting styles and practices in the domains of weight status and 
obesogenic behaviors, as identified by an expert panel assembled by the National 
Cancer Institute.

Life hazard ratio--a new scale for assessing the severity of injury in the 
populational stud.

Nogalski A, Lűbek T, Ochal A, Jojczuk M.

The heterogeneous population of patients affected by trauma is extremely 
difficult to systematize. This is due to the diversity of mechanisms of injury, 
the nature and severity of the injury and the population, which relate to 
injuries, diverse in terms of gender, age, presence of comorbidities that make 
up the final severity of the injury and a certain degree of danger to life.
THE AIM OF THE STUDY: To develop a universal method to assess the severity of 
injury and loss of life resulting from their consequences, using the parameters 
available in the Polish administrative databases, a similar diagnostic efficacy 
as other used scales to assess the severity of damage.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study analyzed a group of 92,463 patients hospitalized 
due to injuries sustained as a result of injuries in all hospitals of the Lublin 
region in 2003-2005. Developed catalogs risk factors, reference to the 
population of the Lublin province.
RESULTS: Developed five models predictive of injury severity scale counterparts, 
which include different combinations of risk factors associated with the type of 
injury, age of the patient and the mechanism of injury that have been evaluated 
for their diagnostic efficacy in differentiating the expected outcomes. 
Prediction model have the best diagnostic efficacy AUROC 0.9615, SE 0.0025 and 
95% CI 0,9565-0,9665, hereinafter referred to as Life Hazard Ratio (LHR), which 
has a similarly high diagnostic efficacy as the other, examined in the work of 
the rock assess the severity of damage AUROC 0.9585, SE 0.0368, 95% CI0 
0.8849-1.
CONCLUSIONS: 1. The proposed method of use of the International Classification 
ICD-10 allows the use of regional administrative databases to conduct detailed 
analyzes of population and monitor trends in the epidemiology of injuries. 2. 
Developed Life Hazard Ratio (LHR)is a universal method for the objective 
evaluation of the severity of injuries and the associated risk of 
life-threatening, can also conduct population studies. 3. LHR has a comparable 
rate of diagnostic efficacy as other commonly used scales assessing the severity 
of the injury.

Poverty and the state of nutrition in India.

Varadharajan KS(1), Thomas T, Kurpad AV.

Author information:

India is often thought of as a development paradox with relatively high economic 
growth rates in the past few years, but with lower progress in areas of life 
expectancy, education and standard of living. While serious inequalities in 
growth, development and opportunity explain the illusion of the paradox at the 
country level, still, a significant proportion of the world's poor live in 
India, as do a significant proportion of the world's malnourished children. 
Poverty and undernutrition coexist, and poor dietary quality is associated with 
poor childhood growth, as well as significant micronutrient deficiencies. Food 
security is particularly vulnerable to changes in the economic scenario and to 
inequities in wealth distribution. Migration from rural to urban settings with a 
large informal employment sector also ensures that migrants continue to live in 
food insecure situations. While food production has for the most part kept pace 
with the increasing population, it has been with regard to cereal rather than of 
pulses and millet production. Oil seeds, sugar cane and horticultural crops, 
along with non-food crops are also being promoted, which do not address 
nutrition security, and, coupled with the increase in the consumption of 
pre-prepared food, may indeed predispose towards the double burden of 
malnutrition. Access to food is also particularly susceptible to poverty and 
inequality. Many strategies and policies have been proposed to counter 
undernutrition in India, but their implementation has not been uniform, and it 
is still too early to assess their lasting impact at scale.

Effects of compulsory schooling on mortality: evidence from Sweden.

Theoretically, there are several reasons to expect education to have a positive 
effect on health. Empirical research suggests that education can be an important 
health determinant. However, it has not yet been established whether education 
and health are indeed causally related, and the effects found in previous 
studies may be partially attributable to methodological weaknesses. Moreover, 
existing evidence on the education-health relationship generally uses 
information of fairly recent schooling reforms, implying that health outcomes 
are observed only over a limited time period. This paper examines the effect of 
education on mortality using information on a national roll-out of a reform 
leading to one extra year of compulsory schooling in Sweden. In 1936, the 
national government made a seventh school year compulsory; however, the 
implementation was decided at the school district level, and the reform was 
implemented over 12 years. Taking advantage of the variation in the timing of 
the implementation across school districts, by using county-level proportions of 
reformed districts, census data and administrative mortality data, we find that 
the extra compulsory school year reduced mortality. In fact, the mortality 
reduction is discernible already before the age of 30 and then grows in 
magnitude until the age of 55-60.

IMPORTANCE: Life expectancy is increasing in most developed countries, and 
elderly people have the highest incidence of melanoma.
OBJECTIVE: To identify characteristics of melanoma and its management in the 
elderly compared with younger patients.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Retrospective population-based study of 
incident cases of primary melanoma in 1621 patients with stage I or II melanoma 
in 2004 and 2008. Questionnaires administered to physicians and a survey of 
cancer registries and pathology laboratories were used to obtain data. The study 
was conducted in 5 regions in northeastern France.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Characteristics of patients and tumors, 
circumstances of diagnosis, and further management in older patients (≥70 years, 
487 patients [30.0%]) compared with younger ones (<70 years, 1134 [70.0%]).
RESULTS: Older patients had more frequent melanomas of the head and neck (29.4% 
vs 8.7%; P < .001) and of the nodular, lentigo maligna, or acral lentiginous 
histologic subtypes. They had thicker and more frequently ulcerated tumors, 
categorized as T3 or T4 in 36.7% of cases vs 20.1% in younger patients. 
Diagnosis of melanoma occurred more frequently in a general practice setting and 
less frequently in direct consultation with a dermatologist or regular screening 
for skin cancer. Time to definitive excision was longer in older patients, and 
16.8% of them compared with 5.0% of the younger population had insufficient 
excision margins (P < .001). A sentinel lymph node biopsy was performed in 23.3% 
of the older patients with melanoma thicker than 1 mm vs 41.4% in the younger 
patients (P < .001). Adjuvant therapy was less frequently started in older 
patients and was prematurely stopped in a higher proportion of that population.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Age-related variations are observed at every step of 
melanoma management. The most important concerns are access of elderly people to 
settings for early diagnosis and excision with appropriate margins.

Infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a progressive condition 
which may cause endothelial dysfunction and liver damage leading to 
coagulopathy. With adventure of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), 
life expectancy has prolonged in HIV positive patients but several acquired 
immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related conditions such as coagulopathies are 
responsible for associated morbidity and mortality. This study aimed to evaluate 
the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways of coagulation, serum level of fibrinogen 
and platelet count in HIV positive patients and compare it with negative healthy 
individuals. Through a case-control study, 114 HIV seropositive patients were 
compared with 114 seronegative samples in terms of hematological and other 
coagulation parameters. Mean age of study patients was 37.48 years. Intra venous 
drug abuse was the most common route of infection transmission with a prevalence 
of more than 50%. HIV route of transmission had a direct relationship with PTT 
abnormal levels (P&lt;0.0001). However, this relationship was not significant 
for PT values. Stages of HIV disease and administration of HAART did not reveal 
any significant relationship with PT and PTT. There was also a statistically 
significant correlation between CD4+&lt; 200 and PT in case group (P=0.008). On 
the other hands, in control group, CD4+ had a weak relationship with PTT 
(P=0.02) and an inverse correlation with serum fibrinogen (P=0.013). 
Hematological parameters and serum fibrinogen are decreased in HIV positive 
patients especially in direct relation with CD4+ cell count&lt;200 cell/µl. PT 
and PTT abnormal values are also more prevalent in this population.

AIMS: To compare the cost-effectiveness (CE) of retropubic midurethral sling 
(RMS) versus transobturator midurethral sling (TMS) for the treatment of female 
stress urinary incontinence (SUI).
METHODS: A Markov chain decision model was created to simulate treatment of SUI 
with RMS versus TMS. Costing data were obtained from the Medicare RBRVS. Data 
regarding the efficacy and complications associated with RMS versus TMS was 
compiled from a literature review of 21 randomized RCTs with a minimum of 12
