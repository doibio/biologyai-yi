the safety and efficiency of gene-editing; however, a comprehensively 
quantitative assay remains to be established. Here, we describe the step-by-step 
instructions of the primer extension-mediated sequencing (PEM-seq), followed by 
the framework of data processing and statistical analysis. PEM-seq presents a 
full spectrum of repair outcomes for both genome-editing-induced and endogenous 
DSBs in mouse and human cells. For complete details on the use and execution of

The upturn in life expectancy and its consequence, population aging, are 
challenging labor, pension, and social-security systems throughout the developed 
world. The focal aim of this study is to measure the extent of out-of-pocket 
funding of healthcare services by the older adult population. The study has 
three objectives: to profile the healthcare services for which older adults pay 
out of pocket, profile the older adults who pay out of pocket for medical 
services and detect changes over the years, and identify predictors of 
out-of-pocket healthcare services funding by older adults. The study is 
predicated on the SHARE-Israel database (SHARE-Survey of Health, Ageing and 
Retirement in Europe). Relating to information yielded by the last two waves of 
SHARE-Israel (Wave 7 and Wave 8), it sheds light on the characteristics of those 
who reported having paid out-of-pocket for medical services. A large majority of 
the older-adult population in Israel that consumes healthcare services is asked 
to pay for services out of pocket. Having supplemental health insurance, 
personal state of health and changes in it, and economic resources are found to 
have the strongest effect on the probability of out-of-pocket funding. The 
motive of financial and/or social support that older adults receive from and/or 
give to their immediate surroundings makes it more likely that they will pay out 
of pocket for healthcare services. The probability of such funding varies 
between nationalities and immigration statuses. It is found with emphasis that 
the share of out-of-pocket funding of healthcare in older adult households' 
total annual income is trending upward. Furthermore, economic motives are 
central in determining whether such expenditure will stabilize over time. The 
findings stress the need to enhance the healthcare system's awareness of the 
profile of older adults who find it necessary to pay out of pocket for 
healthcare services.

INTRODUCTION: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) due to systemic inflammation and insulin 
resistance increases the risk of cardiovascular disease and reduces life 
expectancy. In order to develop cardiac death prevention strategies, it is 
necessary to estimate the prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MetS) in these 
patients.
METHODS: This systematic review and meta-analysis was performed to estimate the 
prevalence of MetS among patients with RA. International databases (i.e., 
Scopus, PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar) were searched during the 
period of October 1 and October 10, 20121. Heterogeneity among the included 
studies was assessed through the Cochrane Q test statistics and I2 test. 
Finally, a random-effects meta-analysis model was computed to estimate the 
pooled prevalence of MetS.
RESULTS: Sixty-one articles with 96 groups and a sample size of 13,644 people 
were analyzed. The pooled prevalence of MetS was 32% (95% CI: 29.6-34.4). The 
highest prevalence of MetS is related to studies conducted in Asia (32.7%, 95% 
CI: 29-36.3) and Europe (32.7%, 95% CI: 27.5.37.9) and the lowest Prevalence was 
also related to studies conducted in Africa (28%, 95% CI: 28.8-32.2). The 
prevalence of MetS in men was 33% (95% CI: 26-39) and 34% (95% CI: 29-40) in 
women. Findings by diagnostic criteria showed that the highest and lowest 
prevalence of MetS was related to ATP III (37.5%, 95% CI: 30.9-44.2) and EGIR 
(14.4%, 95% CI: 10.5-18.5), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: MetS is highly prevalent in patients with RA and identification of 
high-risk patients is necessary to prevent cardiovascular mortality.

Pecan bacterial leaf scorch, caused by Xylella fastidiosa subsp. multiplex, is 
an economically significant disease of pecan with known detrimental effects on 
the yield of susceptible cultivars. In this study, endosperm was harvested from 
developing pecan seeds, and direct qPCR and sequencing were used to detect and 
confirm the presence of X. fastidiosa. DNA was isolated from mature seeds 
originating from seven trees, revealing a positivity rate up to 90%, and 
transmission of X. fastidiosa from infected seed to the germinated seedlings was 
found to be over 80%. Further epidemiological analyses were performed to 
determine where X. fastidiosa localizes in mature seed and seedlings. The 
highest concentrations of X. fastidiosa DNA were found in the hilum and outer 
integument of the seeds and the petioles, respectively. High-, medium-, and 
low-density seeds were harvested to determine the impact of the bacterium on 
seed density and seedling growth rate. The growth rate of seedlings originating 
from low-density seeds was significantly reduced compared to the medium- and 
high-density seeds. Despite the increased growth and germination rates, the 
high-density seed group had a greater proportion of samples that tested positive 
for the presence of X. fastidiosa by qPCR. The results demonstrate the ability 
of X. fastidiosa to colonize developing seeds and be efficiently transmitted 
from well-developed seeds to germinated seedlings. Continued research is needed 
to understand the plant-microbe interactions involved in the colonization of 
pecan seeds by X. fastidiosa and to develop effective phytosanitary approaches 
to reduce the risks posed by seed transmission.

In patients with a small aortic annulus, the clinical benefits of aortic valve 
replacement depend on avoidance of patient-prosthesis mismatch as it is 
associated with reduced overall survival. Aortic root widening or enlargement is 
a useful technique to implant larger valve prosthesis to prevent 
patient-prosthesis mismatch. Posterior annular enlargement is the commonest 
technique used for aortic root enlargement. Consistent enlargement of the aortic 
root requires more extensive procedures like Manouguian or Konno-Rastan 
techniques. The patients commonly selected are younger patients with good life 
expectancy. However, caution is advised in applying this procedure in elderly 
patients, patients with heavily calcified annulus and when performing 
concomitant procedures. There is no definitive conclusion on the best material 
to use for the reconstruction of aortic annulus and aorta in aortic root 
enlargement procedures.

Integrated Chinese and Western Medicine, Wuhan, China.

This study reports the risk factors, trends, and burden of cancer in China from 
1990 to 2019 from the Global Burden of Diseases. The incidence, mortality, and 
DALY of all cancers in China for the past 30 years were analyzed. In 2019, the 
age-standardized rates (ASRs) of cancer incidence, mortality, and DALY in China 
were 232.42/100 000, 136.72/100 000, and 3288.22/100 000, respectively. The five 
cancers with the highest age-standardized incidence rates were lung, stomach, 
colorectal, breast, and prostate cancers. From 1990 to 2019, the number of new 
cancer cases, deaths, and DALY increased by 168.78%, 86.89%, and 51.20%, 
respectively. The ASR increased by 22.21% for incidence and decreased by 19.01% 
and 27.19% for mortality and DALY, respectively, and their corresponding average 
annual percent change values were 0.71, -0.80, and -1.26, respectively. The main 
risk factors for cancer in China were smoking, air pollution, dietary factors, 
and alcohol use. From 1990 to 2019, the cancer incidence rate was on the rise, 
and cancer mortality and DALY rates were declining; however, these 
characteristics vary by cancer site. Therefore, current prevention strategies 
should be reoriented, and specific strategies for cancers in different sites 
should be established to prevent the increase in cancer cases.

Asymptomatic presentation is common in benign mature mediastinal tumours. 
Symptoms of the above diseases are sometimes life-threatening and can cause 
massive hemoptysis, recurrent pulmonary infection, hypoxia related to the 
pulmonary parenchymal hemorrhage, or pressure effect on or more of the major 
bronchi. A 16-year-old boy presented with frequent episodes of hemoptysis and 
recurrent fever unresponsive to antimicrobials. On investigation, it was found 
to be a benign mature mediastinal mass with cystobronchial connection to the 
right middle lobe. Resection of this mass resulted in the complete recovery of 
the individual. An anterior mediastinal benign teratodermoid tumour with 
intraparenchymal extension through cystobronchial connection is very rare. 
Surgical resection is challenging but offers the complete cure.

Telomere shortening rates inversely correlate with life expectancy and hence it 
is critical to understand how telomere shortening is regulated. Recently, the 
telomeric non-coding RNA, TERRA has been implicated in the regulation of 
replicative senescence. To better understand how TERRA is regulated we employed 
a proteomics approach to look for potential RNA regulators that associate with 
telomeric sequences. Based on the results, we have identified proteins that may 
regulate TERRA in both a positive and negative manner, depending on the state of 
the telomere. In this mini-review, we discuss and speculate about these data to 
expand our understanding of TERRA and telomere interactors with respect to 
telomere shortening dynamics.

The benefits derived from fermented foods and beverages have placed great value 
on their acceptability worldwide. Food fermentation technologies have been 
employed for thousands of years and are considered essential processes for the 
production and preservation of foods, with the critical roles played by the 
autochthonous fermenting food-grade microorganisms in ensuring food security and 
safety, increased shelf life, and enhanced livelihoods of many people in Africa, 
particularly the marginalized and vulnerable groups. Many indigenous fermented 
foods and beverages of Africa are of plant origin. In this review, the 
predominance, fermentative activities, and biopreservative role of Lactobacillus 
spp. during production of indigenous foods and beverages, the potential health 
benefit of probiotics, and the impact of these food-grade microorganisms on food 
safety and prolonged shelf life are discussed. During production of African 
indigenous foods (with emphasis on cereals and cassava-based food products), 
fermentation occurs in succession; the first group of microorganisms to colonize 
the fermenting substrates are lactic acid bacteria (LAB) with the diversity and 
dominance of Lactobacillus spp. The Lactobacillus spp. multiply rapidly in the 
fermentation matrix, by taking up nutrients from the surrounding environments, 
and cause rapid acidification in the fermenting system via the production of 
organic compounds that convert fermentable sugars into mainly lactic acid. 
Production of these compounds in food systems inhibits spoilage microorganisms, 
which has a direct effect on food quality and safety. The knowledge of microbial 
interaction and succession during food fermentation will assist the food 
industry in producing functional foods and beverages with improved nutritional 
profiling and technological attributes, as Lactobacillus strains isolated during 
fermentation of several African indigenous foods have demonstrated desirable 
characteristics that make them safe for use as probiotic microorganisms and even 
as a starter culture in small- and large-scale/industrial food production 
processes.

BACKGROUND: Social determinants of health (SDOH) produce a broad range of life 
expectancy (LE) disparities. In China, limited literatures were found to report 
association between SDOH and LE at ecological level during a consecutive period 
of time from the spatial perspectives. This study aimed to determine the 
existence, quantify the magnitude, and interpret the association between SDOH 
and LE in China.
METHODS: Provincial-level LE were estimated from mortality records during 
2005-2020 from National Mortality Surveillance System in China. A spatial panel 
Durbin model was used to investigate LE associated SDOH proxies. Spatial 
spillover effects were introduced to interpret direct and indirect effects 
caused by SDOH during long-term and short-term period on LE disparities.
FINDINGS: Nationwide, LE increased from 73.1 (95% confidence interval (CI): 
71.3, 74.4) years to 77.7 (95%CI: 76.5, 78.7) years from 2005 to 2020. Unequally 
spatial distribution of LE with High-High clustering in coastal areas and 
Low-Low clustering in western regions were observed. Locally, it was estimated 
that SDOH proxies statistically significant related to an increase of LE, 
including GDP (coefficient: 0.02, 95%CI: 0.00, 0.03), Gini index (coefficient: 
2.35, 95%CI: 1.82, 2.88), number of beds in health care institutions 
(coefficient: 0.02, 95%CI: 0.00, 0.05) and natural growth rate of resident 
population (coefficient: 0.02, 95%CI: 0.01, 0.02). Direct and indirect effects 
decomposition during long-term and short-term of LE associated SDOH proxies 
demonstrated that GDP, urbanization rate, unemployment rate, education 
attainment, Gini index, number of beds in health care institutions, sex ratio, 
gross dependence ratio and natural growth rate of resident population not only 
affected local LE, but also exerted spatial spillover effects towards 
geographical neighbors.
INTERPRETATION: Spatial variations of LE existed at provincial-level in China. 
SDOH regarding socioeconomic development and equity, healthcare resources, as 
well as population characteristics not only affected LE disparities at local 
scale but also among nearby provinces. Externalities of policy of those SDOH 
proxies should be took into consideration to promote health equity nationally. 
Comprehensive approaches on the basis of population strategy should be 
consolidated to optimize supportive socioeconomic environment and narrow the 
regional gap to reduce health disparities and increase LE.

We examined whether there were gains in lifespan among patients who died from 
hematological cancers in Japan between 1990 and 2015 using the novel average 
lifespan shortened (ALSS) measure. We obtained mortality data from the World 
Health Organization mortality database. Years of life lost (YLL) was calculated 
using Japanese life tables. ALSS measure was calculated as a ratio of YLL to the 
expected lifespan. The ALSS results showed that the lifespan of patients who 
died from hematological cancers has improved over time. For instance, women who 
died of leukemia in 1990 lost about 34% of their lifespan; conversely, those who 
died in 2015 lost about 20%. Likewise, men dying from non-Hodgkin lymphoma lost 
about 22% of their lifespan in 1990, whereas men lost about 14% in 2015. In 
summary, the new ALSS measure shows prolonged lifespans among patients who died 
from hematological cancers in Japan over the study period.

INTRODUCTION: Life expectancy in individuals has increased in recent years. 
There is no consensus in the literature on the best treatment for a ruptured 
aneurysm in the elderly (> 60 years), but some places only have microsurgery as 
a therapeutic strategy. This work aims to develop a prognostic scale for 
ruptured intracranial aneurysms in the elderly.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Two thousand five hundred thirty patients with 
subarachnoid hemorrhage were retrospectively evaluated in the last ten years, 
and 550 of them were elderly. We developed a prognostic scale from the analysis 
of medical records, clinical and tomographic features that had statistical 
significance. Glasgow Coma Outcome (GOS) was the outcome of interest and p value 
< 0,05 was considered statistically significant.
RESULTS: Five hundred fifty patients were evaluated, and the comorbidities that 
were independent variables for poor prognosis were smoking and arterial 
hypertension; clinical variables were Hunt-Hess, modified Rankin and Glasgow 
Coma Scale; tomographic was Fisher scale. Poor outcome was defined as GOS ≤ 3. 
Poor surgical outcomes were more remarkable in the high-risk factor categories, 
being 6.41 times higher among individuals who had 3 to 4 risk factors and 8.80 
times higher among individuals with 5 to 6 risk factors.
CONCLUSION: In some vascular neurosurgery services worldwide, microsurgery is 
the only therapeutic option. This scale aimed at the elderly patient 
individualizes the treatment and can predict the clinical outcome in ruptured 
intracranial aneurysms.

Hypermobility of the first CMC joint may adversely affect hand function and may 
lead to osteoarthritis later in life. It presents more commonly in younger women 
with generalized joint hypermobility or postmenopausal women with early stages 
of arthritis. It may follow trauma and deletive surgical interventions. 
Clinically, joint subluxation manifests with a prominent and unstable thumb 
base, and is radiographically confirmed by stress views. A variety of ligament 
reconstruction techniques are available to stabilize the CMC joint including 
open ligament reconstruction with or without temporary Kirschner-wire fixation, 
arthroscopic debridement with capsular shrinkage, metacarpal extension 
osteotomy, internal proprietary anchors, and arthrodesis.

BACKGROUND: Factor VIII (FVIII) binding to endogenous von Willebrand factor 
(VWF) has constrained half-life extension of recombinant FVIII (rFVIII) products 
for hemophilia A. Efanesoctocog alfa (rFVIIIFc-VWF-XTEN; BIVV001) is a novel 
fusion protein designed to decouple FVIII from VWF in circulation and maximize 
half-life prolongation by XTEN® polypeptides and Fc fusion. FVIII, VWF, and 
platelets interact to achieve normal hemostasis. Thus, bioengineered FVIII 
replacement products, such as efanesoctocog alfa, require comprehensive 
assessment of their hemostatic potential.
OBJECTIVES: We compared functional clot formation and injury-induced platelet 
accumulation between efanesoctocog alfa and rFVIII.
PATIENTS/METHODS: The hemostatic potential of efanesoctocog alfa and rFVIII were 
assessed by measuring their dose-dependent effects on in vitro fibrin generation 
in hemophilic plasma and in vivo injury-induced platelet accumulation using 
intravital microscopy and repeat saphenous vein laser-induced injuries in 
hemophilia A mice.
RESULTS: Equal concentrations of efanesoctocog alfa or rFVIII (up to 1 IU/ml) 
added to plasma from patients with hemophilia A elicited similar kinetics for 
dose-dependent fibrin polymerization between factor products. In the presence of 
tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), clots formed had similar stability between 
products. Single intravenous doses (50, 100, or 150 IU/kg) of efanesoctocog alfa 
or rFVIII shortly before repeat saphenous vein laser-induced injuries increased 
platelet accumulation over time in a dose-dependent manner in hemophilia A mice. 
Platelet deposition kinetics were similar between products.
CONCLUSIONS: Equivalent doses of efanesoctocog alfa and rFVIII had similar 
efficacy in promoting fibrin clot formation and injury-induced platelet 
accumulation. The hemostatic potential of efanesoctocog alfa was 
indistinguishable from that of rFVIII.

Cancer became one of the most common clinical problems in the care of older 
adults. Cancer is the leading cause of death in Israel. Currently about 50% of 
cancer diagnoses occur in patients over 65 years of age, but this number is 
expected to increase to 70% by 2030. This is largely due to the shifting 
demographics, increasing life expectancy and improvements in the level of 
mortality from cardiovascular disease. The aging cancer population has an impact 
across the treatment spectrum from screening decisions, multimodality treatment 
options, survivorship and quality of life. This paper will review the approach 
to the principles of geriatric oncology within different treatment modalities.

The prevalence of disabilities in the general population is not neglectable and 
gaps in providing quality health service persist between people with and without 
disabilities. Though life expectancy of persons with disability is increasing, 
there is an excess of preventable morbidity and mortality. The person with 
disability has needs and expectations and should be partners in the process of 
prevention, treatment and follow-up of their health status. According to 
research, the medical care for the patient with disability does not meet the 
standards derived from the evidence. Patient safety is a core domain in the 
quality of care and that is true for the care of persons with disability. 
Communication, stigma, lack of knowledge, skills and training, are major 
inhibitors of the provision of high-quality care for the people with 
disabilities and are considered to be factors responsible for the high incidence 
of adverse and medical errors in this group of patients. Approaching these 
topics with critical attention is needed across the span of medical care from 
the community to the hospital and from prevention to the more complex and 
sophisticated care offered to the patient with disability.

The emphasis of the international system of radiological protection of the 
environment is to protect populations of flora and fauna. Throughout the MODARIA 
programmes, the United Nations' International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has 
facilitated knowledge sharing, data gathering and model development on the 
effect of radiation on wildlife. We present a summary of the achievements of 
MODARIA I and II on wildlife dose effect modelling, extending to a new 
sensitivity analysis and model development to incorporate other stressors. We 
reviewed evidence on historical doses and transgenerational effects on wildlife 
from radioactively contaminated areas. We also evaluated chemical population 
modelling approaches, discussing similarities and differences between chemical 
and radiological impact assessment in wildlife. We developed population 
modelling methodologies by sourcing life history and radiosensitivity data and 
evaluating the available models, leading to the formulation of an 
ecosystem-based mathematical approach. This resulted in an ecologically relevant 
conceptual population model, which we used to produce advice on the evaluation 
of risk criteria used in the radiological protection of the environment and a 
proposed modelling extension for chemicals. This work seeks to inform 
stakeholder dialogue on factors influencing wildlife population responses to 
radiation, including discussions on the ecological relevance of current 
environmental protection criteria. The area of assessment of radiation effects 
in wildlife is still developing with underlying data and models continuing to be 
improved. IAEA's ongoing support to facilitate the sharing of new knowledge, 
models and approaches to Member States is highlighted, and we give suggestions 
for future developments in this regard.

IMPORTANCE: In China, little is known about end-of-life (EOL) care preferences 
of patients with terminal cancer. Understanding these patients' treatment 
preferences is needed to improve patient-centered health care, better inform 
surrogates and medical staff about patient preferences, and enhance the quality 
of EOL care.
OBJECTIVE: To examine preferences for EOL care among patients with terminal 
cancer in China.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this survey study, patients older than 50 
years who had terminal cancer were randomly selected from medical records at a 
single hospital in China. Data on patients' EOL care preferences were collected 
by discrete choice experiment (DCE) from August to November 2018 and were 
analyzed from October 2020 to March 2021.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The main outcome was patient preferences in EOL 
care, derived using a mixed logit model. Each DCE scenario described 6 
attributes: hospitalization days, life extension, quality of life, adverse 
treatment events, place-of-death preference, and out-of-pocket costs. The 
marginal willingness to pay (WTP) in US dollars was estimated from regression 
coefficients.
RESULTS: Of 188 patients selected for the survey, 183 participated (97.3%). 
Among the respondents, the mean [SD] age was 61 [8.4] years, and 128 (69.8%) 
were male. Patients' preferences for moderate increase in survival time, better 
quality of life, death at home, and lower out-of-pocket costs were significantly 
associated with their choices between treatment models. Extending life by 10 
months (vs 4 months: β, 1.63; 95% CI, 0.81-2.44) and a better quality of life 
(very good vs poor: β, 1.79; 95% CI, 0.96-2.62) were the most important 
attributes to patients. The uptake rate for a treatment scenario increased by 
61.6% when the quality of life improved from poor to very good, and when life 
extension increased from 4 months to 10, the uptake rate increased by 57.2%. The 
uptake increased by 12.5% when the place of death changed from hospital to home. 
However, it decreased by 31.4% when the costs increased to $21 174. The study 
found a WTP of $38 854 (95% CI, $19 468-$95 096) to improve quality of life from 
a poor to a very good level, substantially higher than the WTP for a life 
extension of 6 months ($35 308; 95% CI, $17 745-$80 279) or 1 year ($27 572; 95% 
CI, $16 389-$58 027) compared with the baseline scenario of a 4-month extension. 
Patients were willing to pay $8860 (95% CI, $621-$26 474) to die at home rather 
than in a hospital.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The findings suggest that in addition to extending 
life moderately for patients with terminal cancer, improving quality of life 
during EOL care and supporting home deaths may deserve greater attention. The 
findings also suggest that physicians and surrogates should ask about patients' 
care preferences and better inform them of their choices to improve EOL care 
outcomes.

differ from nonautistics.

It has previously been proposed that autistic people have problems with timing 
which underlie the behavioral and cognitive differences in the condition. 
However, the nature of this postulated timing issue has not been well specified 
and the existing experimental literature has generated mixed findings. In the 
current study, we attempted a systematic investigation of timing processes in 
autistic adults using scalar expectancy theory as a theoretical framework. 
Autistic (n = 58) and nonautistic (n = 91) adults matched for age, sex, and 
full-scale IQ completed a battery of auditory and visual timing tasks measuring 
basic subsecond duration perception (temporal discrimination thresholds), clock 
processes (verbal estimation), clock and memory processes (temporal 
generalization), and event timing (temporal order judgments). Participants also 
completed suprasecond retrospective duration estimates where the participant was 
not warned in advanced that they would be required to make a timing judgment, 
and questionnaires measuring self-reported timing behaviors in daily life. The 
groups reported differences on questionnaires, but measures of timing 
performance were comparable overall. In an exploratory analysis, we performed 
principal components analysis to investigate the relationship between timing 
judgments and participants' self-reported social-communicative, sensory, and 
motor traits. Measures of timing performance were not well correlated with these 
questionnaire scores. The current study, the largest conducted on time and 
autism to date, shows no clear evidence for reduced timing performance in 
autistic adults. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved).

Acroporid corals are one of the most important corals in the Caribbean because 
of their role in building coral reefs. Unfortunately, Acropora corals have 
suffered a severe decline in the last 50 years thus prompting the development of 
many restoration practices, such as coral nurseries, to increase the abundance 
of these species. However, many coral nursery designs require constant visits 
and maintenance limiting restoration to more convenient sites. Additionally, 
most studies lack the details required for practitioners to make informed 
decisions about replicating nursery designs. Two line nurseries were monitored 
for three years in The Bahamas to assess the survival of corals, Acropora 
cervicornis and Acropora palmata, as well as evaluate the durability and cost 
effectiveness of the nursery design. Survivorship ranged from 70 to 97% with one 
location experiencing significantly higher survivorship. The initial year 
build-out cost was high for a nursery, $22.97 per coral, but each nursery was 
comprised of specific materials that could withstand high storm conditions. Some 
unique aspects of the design included the use of longline clips and 
large-diameter monofilament lines which allowed for easier adjustments and more 
vigorous cleaning. The design proved to be very durable with materials showing a 
life expectancy of five years or more. Additionally, the design was able to 
withstand multiple hurricanes and winter storm conditions with little to no 
damage. Only two maintenance visits a year were required reducing costs after 
construction. After three years, this nursery design showed promising durability 
of materials and survivorship of both Acropora cervicornis and Acropora palmata 
despite being serviced just twice a year.

BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer is an important cause of death worldwide. The number 
of years of life lost (YLL) due to prostate cancer is a metric of the toll of 
prostate cancer and using projections of demographic changes, can be used to 
measure future burden.
METHODS: Prostate cancer mortality data by country and world region was 
retrieved from the Global Cancer Observatory and the World Health Organization 
mortality data set, and life expectancy was from the United Nations Department 
of Economic and Social Affairs. We estimated YLL as the difference between age 
at death in people with prostate cancer and remaining life expectancy for people 
of the same age in the general population. We also estimated the 
age-standardized YLL rates per 100,000 males over 50 and the average annual 
percentage change in YLL rates over the period 2000-2019 and the number of YLL 
for the year 2040 by applying population projections to the 2020 YLL rates.
RESULTS: In 2020, 3.5 million person-years of life were lost due to prostate 
cancer in males over 50, and 40% of YLL were in those aged over 75. 
Age-standardized rates varied greatly between and within regions. Over the last 
two decades, rates of YLL have increased in many Asian and African countries 
while they have decreased in northern American and European countries. Globally, 
YLL are anticipated to double by 2040 to reach 7.5 million, with the greatest 
increases in Africa, Asia, and Latin America and the Caribbean.
CONCLUSION: There are wide variations in the burden of prostate cancer globally 
as measured by YLL. The burden of prostate cancer is projected to increase over 
time and appears to be highest in Sub-Saharan Africa, Eastern Europe, and Latin 
America and the Caribbean. It will be critical to plan and implement programs to 
reduce the burden of prostate cancer globally.
