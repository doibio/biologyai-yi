OBJECTIVE: The Ministry of Health (MOH), Mongolia, is considering introducing 
13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) in its national immunization 
programme to prevent the burden of disease caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae. 
This study evaluates the cost-effectiveness and budget impact of introducing 
PCV13 compared to no PCV vaccination in Mongolia.
METHODS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of introducing PCV13 
compared to no PCV vaccination was assessed using an age-stratified static 
multiple cohort model. The risk of various clinical presentations of 
pneumococcal disease (meningitis, pneumonia, non-meningitis non-pneumonia 
invasive pneumococcal disease and acute otitis media) at all ages for thirty 
birth cohorts was assessed. The analysis considered both health system and 
societal perspectives. A 3+0 vaccine schedule and price of US$3.30 per dose was 
assumed for the baseline scenario based on Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance's advance 
market commitment tail price.
RESULTS: The ICER of PCV13 introduction is estimated at US$52 per 
disability-adjusted life year (DALY) averted (health system perspective), and 
cost-saving (societal perspective). Although indirect effects of PCV have been 
well-documented, a conservative scenario that does not consider indirect effects 
estimated PCV13 introduction to cost US$79 per DALY averted (health system 
perspective), and US$19 per DALY averted (societal perspective). Vaccination 
with PCV13 is expected to cost around US$920,000 in 2016, and thereafter 
US$820,000 every year. The programme is likely to reduce direct disease-related 
costs to MOH by US$440,000 in the first year, increasing to US$510,000 by 2025.
CONCLUSION: Introducing PCV13 as part of Mongolia's national programme appears 
to be highly cost-effective when compared to no vaccination and cost-saving from 
a societal perspective at vaccine purchase prices offered through Gavi. 
Notwithstanding uncertainties around some parameters, cost-effectiveness of PCV 
introduction for Mongolia remains robust over a range of conservative scenarios. 
Availability of high-quality national data would improve future economic 
analyses for vaccine introduction.

OBJECTIVE: To report our experience of radical resection of secondary cancers 
after ureterosigmoidostomy. Ureterosigmoidostomy was the most common continent 
urinary diversion before the era of continent cutaneous diversion and 
neobladders, specifically in children. When performed for bladder exstrophy, 
patients will live with this kind of diversion for quite a long time. As a 
result, urologists will be confronted with patients presenting with an 
adenocarcinoma in their ureterosigmoidostomy. In most cases reported in the 
literature, an ileal conduit was used for urinary conversion. However, nowadays 
an ileal loop must not be the only solution for patients with a long life 
expectancy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between 2004 and 2015, 6 patients were treated for an 
adenocarcinoma in their ureterosigmoidostomy. All patients underwent radical 
resection of the tumor-bearing sigmoid colon. After thorough preoperative 
informed consent concerning the choice of future urinary diversion, such as 
conversion to an ileal conduit, construction of a continent catheterizable 
pouch, or repeat continent anal diversion, 4 patients chose a repeat continent 
anal urinary diversion.
RESULTS: Up to this date, no complications or recurrences were seen after a 
median follow-up of 35 months.
CONCLUSION: In patients with secondary malignancy of the colon, radical 
resection of the tumor-bearing bowel segment is mandatory. A repeat continent 
anal urinary diversion appears to be a feasible alternative to secondary urinary 
diversion after resection of the tumor-bearing sigmoid colon. However, a longer 
follow-up is required to determine whether the risk of secondary malignancy 
remains unchanged, and whether the risk is increased or decreased.

Stochasticity, heterogeneity, and variance in longevity in human populations.

Inter-individual variance in longevity (or any other demographic outcome) may 
arise from heterogeneity or from individual stochasticity. Heterogeneity refers 
to differences among individuals in the demographic rates experienced at a given 
age or stage. Stochasticity refers to variation due to the random outcome of 
demographic rates applied to individuals with the same properties. The variance 
due to individual stochasticity can be calculated from a Markov chain 
description of the life cycle. The variance due to heterogeneity can be 
calculated from a multistate model that incorporates the heterogeneity. We show 
how to use this approach to decompose the variance in longevity into 
contributions from stochasticity and heterogeneous frailty for male and female 
cohorts from Sweden (1751-1899), France (1816-1903), and Italy (1872-1899), and 
also for a selection of period data for the same countries. Heterogeneity in 
mortality is described by the gamma-Gompertz-Makeham model, in which a gamma 
distributed "frailty" modifies a baseline Gompertz-Makeham mortality schedule. 
Model parameters were estimated by maximum likelihood for a range of starting 
ages. The estimates were used to construct an age×frailty-classified matrix 
model, from which we compute the variance of longevity and its components due to 
heterogeneous frailty and to individual stochasticity. The estimated fraction of 
the variance in longevity due to heterogeneous frailty (averaged over time) is 
less than 10% for all countries and for both sexes. These results suggest that 
most of the variance in human longevity arises from stochasticity, rather than 
from heterogeneous frailty.

BACKGROUND: Large observational datasets such as Clinical Practice Research 
Datalink (CPRD) provide opportunities to conduct clinical studies and economic 
evaluations with efficient designs.
OBJECTIVES: Our objectives were to report the economic evaluation methodology 
for a cluster randomised controlled trial (RCT) of a UK NHS-delivered public 
health intervention for children with asthma that was evaluated using CPRD and 
describe the impact of this methodology on results.
METHODS: CPRD identified eligible patients using predefined asthma diagnostic 
codes and captured 1-year pre- and post-intervention healthcare contacts (August 
2012 to July 2014). Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) 4 months 
post-intervention were estimated by assigning utility values to 
exacerbation-related contacts; a systematic review identified these utility 
values because preference-based outcome measures were not collected. 
Bootstrapped costs were evaluated 12 months post-intervention, both with 1-year 
regression-based baseline adjustment (BA) and without BA (observed).
RESULTS: Of 12,179 patients recruited, 8190 (intervention 3641; control 4549) 
were evaluated in the primary analysis, which included patients who received the 
protocol-defined intervention and for whom CPRD data were available. The 
intervention's per-patient incremental QALY loss was 0.00017 (bias-corrected and 
accelerated 95% confidence intervals [BCa 95% CI] -0.00051 to 0.00018) and cost 
savings were £14.74 (observed; BCa 95% CI -75.86 to 45.19) or £36.07 (BA; BCa 
95% CI -77.11 to 9.67), respectively. The probability of cost savings was much 
higher when accounting for BA versus observed costs due to baseline cost 
differences between trial arms (96.3 vs. 67.3%, respectively).
CONCLUSION: Economic evaluations using data from a large observational database 
without any primary data collection is feasible, informative and potentially 
efficient. Clinical Trials Registration Number: ISRCTN03000938.

Safinamide (Xadago®) is an orally active, selective, reversible monoamine 
oxidase-B inhibitor with both dopaminergic and non-dopaminergic (glutamatergic) 
properties. In the EU, safinamide is approved for the treatment of mid- to 
late-stage fluctuating Parkinson's disease (PD) as add-on therapy to a stable 
dose of levodopa alone or in combination with other PD medications. Safinamide 
50-100 mg/day administered as a fixed or flexible dose significantly increased 
daily 'on' time without dyskinesia (primary endpoint) in patients with mid- to 
late-stage PD with motor fluctuations in 24-week, placebo-controlled clinical 
trials. Other outcomes, including motor function, overall clinical status and 
health-related quality of life, were also generally improved with safinamide. 
Furthermore, in an 18-month extension of one study, although dyskinesia (primary 
endpoint) was not significantly improved with safinamide relative to placebo, 
treatment benefits in other outcomes were generally sustained over 24 months of 
treatment. Safinamide was generally well tolerated in clinical trials; 
dyskinesia was the most common adverse event. Although further studies are 
needed, including comparative and long-term studies, current evidence indicates 
that safinamide extends the treatment options available for use as add-on 
therapy to levodopa and other PD medications in patients with mid- to late-stage 
PD experiencing motor fluctuations.

Cyanobacteria were present on the earth 3.5 billion years ago; since then they 
have colonized almost all terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. They produce a 
high number of bioactive molecules, among which some are cyanotoxins. 
Cyanobacterial growth at high densities, forming blooms, is increasing in 
extension and frequency, following anthropogenic activities and climate changes, 
giving rise to some concern for human health and animal life exposed to 
cyanotoxins. Numerous cases of lethal poisonings have been associated with 
cyanotoxins ingestion in wild animal and livestock. In humans few episodes of 
lethal or severe human poisonings have been recorded after acute or short-term 
exposure, but the repeated/chronic exposure to low cyanotoxin levels remains a 
critical issue. The properties of the most frequently detected cyanotoxins 
(namely, microcystins, nodularins, cylindrospermopsin and neurotoxins) are here 
critically reviewed, describing for each toxin the available information on 
producing organisms, biosynthesis/genetic and occurrence, with a focus on the 
toxicological profile (including kinetics, acute systemic toxicity, mechanism 
and mode of action, local effects, repeated toxicity, genotoxicity, 
carcinogenicity, reproductive toxicity; human health effects and epidemiological 
studies; animal poisoning) with the derivation of health-based values and 
considerations on the risks for human health.

Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are membrane-coated objects such as exosomes and 
microvesicles, released by many cell-types. Their presence in body fluids and 
the variable surface composition and content render them attractive potential 
biomarkers. The ability to determine their cellular origin could greatly move 
the field forward. We used multiplex proximity extension assays (PEA) to 
identify with high specificity and sensitivity the protein profiles of exosomes 
of different origins, including seven cell lines and two different body fluids. 
By comparing cells and exosomes, we successfully identified the cells 
originating the exosomes. Furthermore, by principal component analysis of 
protein patterns human milk EVs and prostasomes released from prostate acinar 
cells clustered with cell lines from breast and prostate tissues, respectively. 
Milk exosomes uniquely expressed CXCL5, MIA, and KLK6, whereas prostasomes 
carried NKX31, GSTP1, and SRC, highlighting that EVs originating from different 
origins express distinct proteins. In conclusion, PEA provides a powerful 
protein screening tool in exosome research, for purposes of identifying the cell 
source of exosomes, or new biomarkers in diseases such as cancer and 
inflammation.

    Orthopedics. 2017 Jul 1;40(4):202.

With increases in both life expectancy and the number of patients with 
endoprosthetic replacements, more periprosthetic fractures are expected to 
occur. Periprosthetic fractures related to megaprostheses present a treatment 
challenge, with a high incidence (one-third of affected patients) of secondary 
revision as a result of prosthetic loosening, infection, nonunion, refracture, 
or even amputation. Efforts to improve endoprosthetic reconstruction should 
focus on preventing postoperative complications. Understanding the causes of 
complications and strategies to avoid them could lead to significant 
improvements in implant survival, limb function, and patient outcomes. This 
article presents a concise review of the current literature and an algorithmic 
approach to reconstruction of these complex injuries. [Orthopedics. 2017;

This study aims to explore shape variability of the acetabulum during the human 
adult life span, in relation to sex and age. The human acetabular shape was 
analysed in 682 os coxae from three different documented skeletal collections 
from the Iberian Peninsula. Two landmarks and thirty-two sliding semi-landmarks 
were used for the geometric morphometric procedures and a clock-wise standard 
was used for orientation. The 180° meridian (6:00) line was positioned over the 
midpoint of the acetabular notch and 36 reference points in 10° increments along 
the rim were marked. Data showed that size, sex and age significantly influence 
acetabular shape variation. Sex differences were significant in individuals 
younger than 65 years old and were characterised by males exhibiting relatively 
extended acetabular rim profiles from 10:00 to 1:00, narrower acetabular 
notches, and reduced acetabular fossae. In addition, three main age-related 
changes occurred to the acetabular shape in both sexes: outer acetabular profile 
modification, with extension from 10:00 to 1:00 and reduction from 7:00 to 9:00, 
acetabular notch narrowing, and acetabular fossa reduction. The age-related 
changes that were observed are shared by both sexes and seem to be related to 
bone production associated with age. Specifically, age appears to affect the 
entire border of the lunate surface: the acetabular rim, both acetabular horns, 
and the outer edge of the acetabular fossa. Furthermore, shape data confirmed 
the clover-leaf shape of the acetabular fossa in both males and females. These 
results improve our understanding of acetabular shape, and assist in refining 
age-estimation methods and enhancing hip surgery and rehabilitation.

A traumatic injury of peripheral nerves is serious clinical problem that may 
lead to major loss of nerve function, affecting quality of patient's life. 
Currently, nerve autograft is widely used to reconstruct the nerve gap. However, 
such surgical procedure suffers from many disadvantages including donor site 
morbidity and limited availability. In order to address these issues, neural 
tissue engineering has focused on the development of synthetic nerve scaffolds 
to support bridging a larger gap and improving nerve generation. For this 
purpose, we fabricated a novel 3-D biomimetic scaffold, which has tunable porous 
structure and embedded core-shell nanoparticles with sustained neurogenic factor 
delivery system, using stereolithography based 3-D printing and coaxial 
electrospraying techniques. Our results showed that scaffolds with larger 
porosity significantly improve PC-12 neural cell adhesion compared to ones with 
smaller porosity. Furthermore, scaffolds embedded with bovine serum albumin 
containing nanoparticles showed an enhancement in cell proliferation relative to 
bared control scaffolds. More importantly, confocal microscopy images 
illustrated that the scaffold with nerve growth factor nanoparticles greatly 
increased the length of neurites and directed neurite extension of PC-12 cells 
along the fiber. In addition, the 3-D printed nanocomposite scaffolds also 
improved the average neurite length of primary cortical neurons. The results in 
this study demonstrate the potential of this 3-D printed scaffold in improving 
neural cell function and nerve growth.

In connection with the publication of a clinical practice guideline on the 
management of low back pain (LBP) in general practice in Denmark, a cluster 
randomised controlled trial was conducted. In this trial, a multifaceted 
guideline implementation strategy to improve general practitioners' treatment of 
patients with LBP was compared with a usual implementation strategy. The aim was 
to determine whether the multifaceted strategy was cost effective, as compared 
with the usual implementation strategy. The economic evaluation was conducted as 
a cost-utility analysis where cost collected from a societal perspective and 
quality-adjusted life years were used as outcome measures. The analysis was 
conducted as a within-trial analysis with a 12-month time horizon consistent 
with the follow-up period of the clinical trial. To adjust for a priori selected 
covariates, generalised linear models with a gamma family were used to estimate 
incremental costs and quality-adjusted life years. Furthermore, both 
deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted. Results 
showed that costs associated with primary health care were higher, whereas 
secondary health care costs were lower for the intervention group when compared 
with the control group. When adjusting for covariates, the intervention was less 
costly, and there was no significant difference in effect between the 2 groups. 
Sensitivity analyses showed that results were sensitive to uncertainty. In 
conclusion, the multifaceted implementation strategy was cost saving when 
compared with the usual strategy for implementing LBP clinical practice 
guidelines in general practice. Furthermore, there was no significant difference 
in effect, and the estimate was sensitive to uncertainty.

IMPORTANCE: In China, diabetes prevalence has increased substantially in recent 
decades, but there are no reliable estimates of the excess mortality currently 
associated with diabetes.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the proportional excess mortality associated with diabetes 
and estimate the diabetes-related absolute excess mortality in rural and urban 
areas of China.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A 7-year nationwide prospective study of 
512 869 adults aged 30 to 79 years from 10 (5 rural and 5 urban) regions in 
China, who were recruited between June 2004 and July 2008 and were followed up 
until January 2014.
EXPOSURES: Diabetes (previously diagnosed or detected by screening) recorded at 
baseline.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: All-cause and cause-specific mortality, collected 
through established death registries. Cox regression was used to estimate 
adjusted mortality rate ratio (RR) comparing individuals with diabetes vs those 
without diabetes at baseline.
RESULTS: Among the 512 869 participants, the mean (SD) age was 51.5 (10.7) 
years, 59% (n = 302 618) were women, and 5.9% (n = 30 280) had diabetes (4.1% in 
rural areas, 8.1% in urban areas, 5.8% of men, 6.1% of women, 3.1% had been 
previously diagnosed, and 2.8% were detected by screening). During 3.64 million 
person-years of follow-up, there were 24 909 deaths, including 3384 among 
individuals with diabetes. Compared with adults without diabetes, individuals 
with diabetes had a significantly increased risk of all-cause mortality (1373 vs 
646 deaths per 100 000; adjusted RR, 2.00 [95% CI, 1.93-2.08]), which was higher 
in rural areas than in urban areas (rural RR, 2.17 [95% CI, 2.07-2.29]; urban 
RR, 1.83 [95% CI, 1.73-1.94]). Presence of diabetes was associated with 
increased mortality from ischemic heart disease (3287 deaths; RR, 2.40 [95% CI, 
2.19-2.63]), stroke (4444 deaths; RR, 1.98 [95% CI, 1.81-2.17]), chronic liver 
disease (481 deaths; RR, 2.32 [95% CI, 1.76-3.06]), infections (425 deaths; RR, 
2.29 [95% CI, 1.76-2.99]), and cancer of the liver (1325 deaths; RR, 1.54 [95% 
CI, 1.28-1.86]), pancreas (357 deaths; RR, 1.84 [95% CI, 1.35-2.51]), female 
breast (217 deaths; RR, 1.84 [95% CI, 1.24-2.74]), and female reproductive 
system (210 deaths; RR, 1.81 [95% CI, 1.20-2.74]). For chronic kidney disease 
(365 deaths), the RR was higher in rural areas (18.69 [95% CI, 14.22-24.57]) 
than in urban areas (6.83 [95% CI, 4.73-9.88]). Among those with diabetes, 10% 
of all deaths (16% rural; 4% urban) were due to definite or probable diabetic 
ketoacidosis or coma (408 deaths).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among adults in China, diabetes was associated with 
increased mortality from a range of cardiovascular and noncardiovascular 
diseases. Although diabetes was more common in urban areas, it was associated 
with greater excess mortality in rural areas.

Investigating reasons for differing life expectancy and prevalence of 
cardiovascular risk factors between old and new states of the Federal Republic 
of Germany an epidemiological study in Western Pomerania - the population-based 
project Study of Health in Pomerania (SHIP) - was planned.Prevalence and 
incidence of common risk factors, subclinical disorders and clinical diseases 
have been assessed since 1997 in five-year intervals. The third follow up 
(SHIP-3) was assessed between 2014 and 2016. In addition, an independent 
representative population sample was investigated between 2008 - 2012 
(SHIP-TREND). Recently, the first follow up of this cohort has been started 
(SHIP-TREND-1). This paper reports the methodological approaches for detecting 
pneumological relevant morbidities in this population-based study. It aims to 
offer insights for potential cooperation with interested research groups.

BACKGROUND: The risk of Herpes Zoster (HZ) increases with age and various 
studies have also demonstrated an increasing HZ incidence globally. 
Simultaneously, the global trend of an aging population has placed a greater 
burden on the healthcare system. This study aims to estimate the potential 
burden of HZ over time accounting for the increasing trends of both HZ incidence 
and global aging.
METHODS: A recent systematic review on HZ incidence identified studies that 
evaluated the temporal effects of HZ incidence. Data from the identified studies 
were extracted to estimate the trend of HZ incidence in the ≥65-year-old age 
cohort. The incidence rates were estimated up to the year 2030 using two 
scenarios: a linear extrapolation and a last observation carried forward. Three 
countries were chosen to perform the analysis on: Australia, Japan and the 
United States.
RESULTS: The incidence data from the three countries showed an average annual 
increase between 2.35 and 3.74% over the time period of the studies selected. 
The elderly population for the US, Japan and Australia are expected to increase 
by 55, 10 and 53% respectively by the year 2030 compared to the levels in 2015. 
Under the first scenario between 2001 and 2030, the number of annual incident 
cases of HZ in those aged ≥65 years is expected to increase by +343% (293,785 to 
1,303,328), +176% (158,616 to 437,867) and +376% (18,105 to 86,268) in the US, 
Japan and Australia respectively while those for the second scenario are +150%, 
+83% and +223% respectively. In the US alone, the estimated annual cost of 
HZ-related cases in the ≥65 age cohort is approximately 4.74 Billion US$ in 
2030.
CONCLUSIONS: The increasing incidence of HZ coupled with the demographic trends 
(i.e., aging population and greater life expectancy) in many countries are 
likely to imply a rising economic burden of HZ on already constrained healthcare 
budgets.

BACKGROUND: Prior analyses beyond clinical trials are yet to evaluate the 
projected lifetime benefit of apixaban treatment compared to 
low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH)/vitamin K antagonist (VKA) for treatment of 
venous thromboembolism (VTE) and prevention of recurrences. The objective of 
this study is to assess the cost-effectiveness of initial plus extended 
treatment with apixaban versus LMWH/VKA for either initial treatment only or 
initial plus extended treatment.
METHODS: A Markov cohort model was developed to evaluate the lifetime clinical 
and economic impact of treatment of VTE and prevention of recurrences with 
apixaban (starting at 10 mg BID for 1 week, then 5 mg BID for 6 months, then 
2.5 mg BID for an additional 12 months) versus LMWH/VKA for 6 months and either 
no further treatment or extended treatment with VKA for an additional 12 months. 
Clinical event rates to inform the model were taken from the AMPLIFY and 
AMPLIFY-EXT trials and a network meta-analysis. Background mortality rates, 
costs, and utilities were obtained from published sources. The analysis was 
conducted from the perspective of the United Kingdom National Health Service. 
The evaluated outcomes included the number of events avoided in a 1000-patient 
cohort, total costs, life-years, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and cost 
per QALY gained.
RESULTS: Initial plus extended treatment with apixaban was superior to both 
treatment durations of LMWH/VKA in reducing the number of bleeding events, and 
was superior to initial LMWH/VKA for 6 months followed by no therapy, in 
reducing VTE recurrences. Apixaban treatment was cost-effective compared to 
6-month treatment with LMWH/VKA at an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
(ICER) of £6692 per QALY. When initial LMWH/VKA was followed by further VKA 
therapy for an additional 12 months (i.e., total treatment duration of 
18 months), apixaban was cost-effective at an ICER of £8528 per QALY gained. 
Sensitivity analysis suggested these findings were robust over a wide range of 
inputs and scenarios for the model.
CONCLUSIONS: In the UK, initial plus extended treatment with apixaban for 
treatment of VTE and prevention of recurrences appears to be economical and a 
clinically effective alternative to LMWH/VKA, whether used for initial or 
initial plus extended treatment.

Long-standing racial differences in US life expectancy suggest that black 
Americans would be exposed to significantly more family member deaths than white 
Americans from childhood through adulthood, which, given the health risks posed 
by grief and bereavement, would add to the disadvantages that they face. We 
analyze nationally representative US data from the National Longitudinal Study 
of Youth (n = 7,617) and the Health and Retirement Study (n = 34,757) to 
estimate racial differences in exposure to the death of family members at 
different ages, beginning in childhood. Results indicate that blacks are 
significantly more likely than whites to have experienced the death of a mother, 
a father, and a sibling from childhood through midlife. From young adulthood 
through later life, blacks are also more likely than whites to have experienced 
the death of a child and of a spouse. These results reveal an underappreciated 
layer of racial inequality in the United States, one that could contribute to 
the intergenerational transmission of health disadvantage. By calling attention 
to this heightened vulnerability of black Americans, our findings underscore the 
need to address the potential impact of more frequent and earlier exposure to 
family member deaths in the process of cumulative disadvantage.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of different ozone 
doses (2, 5, and 10 mg/L) on shelf life extension of fresh chicken legs, 
packaged in polyamide/poleyethylene bags and stored at 4 ± 1 °C, for a period of 
12 days. Parameters taken into account were: microbiological (Total viable 
count, Pseudomonas spp., Lactic acid bacteria, Yeasts and molds, and 
Enterobacteriaceae), physicochemical (pH, colour) and sensory (odor, appearance, 
texture, and taste) attributes. Results showed that colour parameter values (L*, 
a*, and b*) were not affected by the gaseous ozone dose, whereas only L* and b* 
were reduced during storage in all samples. pH was reduced by storage time but 
was not affected by ozonation dose and packaging. Total viable count and 
Pseudomonas spp., increased statistically significant with ozonation dose and 
storage time, but were not affected by packaging. Yeasts, molds, 
Enterobacteriaceae, and Lactic acid bacteria, were decreased during storage, 
packaging and ozonation dose. Finally, sensory examination (appearance, texture, 
odor and taste) showed that samples treated with ozone concentration of 10 mg/L 
retained the original characteristic features of fresh chicken legs as compared 
to the control samples. The gaseous ozone treatment of 10 mg/L for 1 h, to 
chicken legs packaged in plastic containers of polyamide/polyethylene under 
refrigeration, is appropriate for maintaining freshness and quality of chicken, 
since their shelf life was extended by 4 days, as compared to the control 
samples.

BACKGROUND: Few studies have addressed retention of minorities, particularly 
African Americans, in longitudinal research. Our aim was to determine whether 
there was differential retention between African Americans and Whites in the 
ARIC cohort and identify cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors and 
indicators of socioeconomic status (SES) associated with these retention 
differences.
METHODS: 15,688 participants, 27% African American and 73% White, were included 
from baseline, 1987-1989, and classified as having died, lost or withdrew from 
study contact, or remained active in study calls through 2013. Life tables were 
created illustrating retention patterns stratified by race, from baseline 
through visit 5, 2011-2013. Prevalence tables stratified by race, participation 
status, and center were created to examine CVD risk factors and SES at baseline 
and visit 5.
RESULTS: 54% of African Americans compared with 62% of Whites were still in 
follow-up by 2013. This difference was due to an 8% higher cumulative incidence 
of death among African Americans. Those who remained in follow-up had the lowest 
baseline CVD risk factors and better SES, followed by those who were 
lost/withdrew, then those who died. Whites had lower levels of most CVD risk 
factors and higher SES than African Americans overall at baseline and visit 5; 
though, the magnitude of visit 5 differences was less.
CONCLUSIONS: In the ARIC cohort, retention differed among African Americans and 
Whites, but related more to mortality differences than dropping-out. Additional 
research is needed to better characterize the factors contributing to minority 
participants' recruitment and retention in longitudinal research.

OBJECTIVE: According to a recent randomized, double-blind clinical trial 
comparing the combination of voriconazole and anidulafungin (VOR+ANI) with VOR 
monotherapy for invasive aspergillosis (IA) in patients with hematologic disease 
or with hematopoietic stem cell transplant, mortality was lower after 6 weeks 
with VOR+ANI than with VOR monotherapy in a post hoc analysis of patients with 
galactomannan-based IA. The objective of this study was to compare the 
cost-effectiveness of VOR+ANI with VOR, from the perspective of hospitals in the 
Spanish National Health System.
METHODS: An economic model with deterministic and probabilistic analyses was 
used to determine costs per life-year gained (LYG) for VOR+ANI versus VOR in 
patients with galactomannan-based IA. Mortality, adverse event rates, and life 
expectancy were obtained from clinical trial data. The costs (in 2015 euros [€]) 
of the drugs and the adverse event-related costs were obtained from Spanish 
sources. A Tornado plot and a Monte Carlo simulation (1,000 iterations) were 
used to assess uncertainty of all model variables.
RESULTS: According to the deterministic analysis, for each patient treated with 
VOR+ANI compared with VOR monotherapy, there would be a total of 0.348 LYG 
(2.529 vs 2.181 years, respectively) at an incremental cost of €5,493 (€17,902 
vs €12,409, respectively). Consequently, the additional cost per LYG with 
VOR+ANI compared with VOR would be €15,785. Deterministic sensitivity analyses 
confirmed the robustness of these findings. In the probabilistic analysis, the 
cost per LYG with VOR+ANI was €15,774 (95% confidence interval: €15,763-16,692). 
The probability of VOR+ANI being cost-effective compared with VOR was estimated 
at 82.5% and 91.9%, based on local cost-effectiveness thresholds of €30,000 and 
€45,000, respectively.
CONCLUSION: According to the present economic study, combination therapy with 
VOR+ANI is cost-effective as primary therapy of IA in galactomannan-positive 
patients in Spain who have hematologic disease or hematopoietic stem cell 
transplant, compared with VOR monotherapy.

Brugada Syndrome: Defining the Risk in Asymptomatic Patients.

Sieira J(1), Brugada P(1).

Author information:

Universiteit Brussel, Brussels, Belgium.

Since the first description of the Brugada syndrome (BS) in 1992, scientific 
progress in the understanding of this disease has been enormous; at the same 
time more and more individuals with the disease have been diagnosed. The profile 
of patients with BS has changed with more asymptomatic individuals and less 
expressive clinical features. Asymptomatic BS individuals are at lower 
arrhythmic risk than those presenting with syncope or sudden cardiac death 
(SCD). The event incidence rate is around 0.5 % per year; this figure is 
relevant due to the fact that individuals have a long life expectancy and are 
otherwise healthy. As a result of the risk of SCD, risk stratification is of 
utmost importance. As the implantation of a cardioverter defibrillator is the 
main treatment for those patients at higher risk, benefits and long-term 
potential risks have to be adequately considered. Some risk factors, such as 
spontaneous type 1 electrocardiogram (ECG) pattern, are widely accepted, whilst 
for others contradictory data are present. Furthermore, novel risk factors are 
now available that might help in the management of BS. The presence of a 
spontaneous type 1 ECG pattern, history of sinus node dysfunction and inducible 
ventricular arrhythmias during programmed electrical stimulation of the heart 
allow us to risk stratify these patients.
