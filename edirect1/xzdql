BACKGROUND: The incidence of keratinocyte carcinomas is high and rapidly 
growing. Approximately 80% of keratinocyte carcinomas consist of basal cell 
carcinomas (BCC) with 50% of these being considered as low-risk tumors. 
Nevertheless, 83% of the low-risk BCC patients were found to receive more 
follow-up care than recommended according to the Dutch BCC guideline, which is 
one visit post-treatment for this group. More efficient management could reduce 
unnecessary follow-up care and related costs.
OBJECTIVES: To study the efficacy, cost-utility, and budget impact of a 
personalized discharge letter for low-risk BCC patients compared with usual care 
(no personalized letter).
METHODS: In a multi-center intervention study, a personalized discharge letter 
in addition to usual care was compared to usual care in first-time BCC patients. 
Model-based cost-utility and budget impact analyses were conducted, using 
individual patient data gathered via surveys. The outcome measures were number 
of follow-up visits, costs and quality adjusted life years (QALY) per patient.
RESULTS: A total of 473 first-time BCC patients were recruited. The personalized 
discharge letter decreased the number of follow-up visits by 14.8% in the first 
year. The incremental costs after five years were -€24.45 per patient. The QALYs 
were 4.12 after five years and very similar in both groups. The national budget 
impact was -€2,7 million after five years.
CONCLUSIONS: The distribution of a personalized discharge letter decreases the 
number of unnecessary follow-up visits and implementing the intervention in a 
large eligible population would results in substantial cost savings, 
contributing to restraining the growing BCC costs.

BACKGROUND: Socioeconomic inequalities in alcohol-related mortality in Spain 
exists, and are postulated to contribute to inequalities in all-cause mortality. 
We aim to assess absolute and relative educational inequalities in 
alcohol-related mortality, and to estimate the role of alcohol in educational 
inequalities in both life expectancy and lifespan variation in Spain.
METHODS: We used multiple cause-of-death (MCOD) mortality data for individuals 
aged 30 and over for Spain (2016-2018) by educational attainment. We estimated 
by sex and educational attainment age-standardised alcohol-attributable 
mortality rates, relative and absolute indices of educational inequalities; and 
total life expectancy and lifespan variation at age 30 for all-cause mortality 
and after eliminating alcohol-attributable mortality.
RESULTS: The use of MCOD resulted in an additional 2543 annual alcohol-related 
deaths (+75% among men and +50% among women) compared with estimates derived 
from underlying causes of death. In absolute terms, educational inequalities 
were the highest among men aged 45-84 and among women aged 45-64. In relative 
terms, higher inequalities raised in working ages, whereas at older ages 
inequalities tended to be lower, although still important among men. Alcohol 
contributed to educational inequalities in life expectancy (men: 0.13 years 
(3.2%); women 0.02 years (0.7%)) and lifespan variation (2.1% and 1.4% for men 
and women, respectively).
CONCLUSION: Alcohol consumption remains an important lifestyle habit to be 
tackled in order to reduce socioeconomic inequalities in mortality in Spain, 
particularly among men.

INTRODUCTION: The burden of cancer continues to increase worldwide, and cancer 
is the leading cause of life expectancy reduction and death in Korea. Population 
attributable fraction (PAF), an epidemiological measure of exposures and health 
outcomes, could provide information on the public health impacts of exposures in 
populations. Knowing the PAFs of modifiable risk factors could aid in planning 
and prioritising strategies to reduce cancer burden in the population. This 
study aims to summarise systematically the PAF estimates of modifiable cancer 
risk factors in Korea.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This review will include studies that determined PAFs of 
modifiable risk factors on cancer incidence and mortality in Korea. We will 
define modifiable risk factors as those that can be changed directly by peoples' 
conscious actions. We will perform systematic searches in EMBASE, MEDLINE, 
Cochrane Library and Korean databases (Korean Studies Information Service 
System, Research Information Sharing Service, KoreaMED, Korean Medical Database, 
National Assembly Library, and Korea Institute of Science and Technology 
Information) from their inception to July 2021. Two reviewers will independently 
screen studies for eligibility, extract data and perform quality assessments of 
the included studies. We will present the results in a qualitative or 
descriptive manner and will not perform meta-analyses or other quantitative data 
synthesis to derive summary estimates of PAFs because we anticipate high 
variability among PAF estimates.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethics approval is not required because we will only 
use data from published papers. We will disseminate the results through 
publication in a peer-reviewed journals.

BACKGROUND: A clinical trial proved the clinical effectiveness of perfusion 
imaging-guided intravenous thrombolysis with alteplase for patients with acute 
ischemic stroke (AIS) with the time of onset between 4.5 and 9 hours. This study 
aimed to assess the lifetime cost-effectiveness of alteplase versus placebo from 
the perspective of Chinese and United States (US) healthcare payers.
METHODS: A decision-analytic model was built to estimate lifetime costs and 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) associated with alteplase or placebo. Model 
inputs were extracted from published sources. Incremental costs, incremental 
QALYs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) were calculated to 
evaluate the base-case scenario. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analysis 
were performed to evaluate uncertainty in the results.
RESULTS: In China, alteplase yielded an additional lifetime QALY of 0.126 with 
an additional cost of Chinese Yuan (¥) ¥9552 compared with placebo, and the ICER 
was ¥83 950 (US$12 157)/QALY. In the US, alteplase had a higher QALY 
(difference: 0.193) with a lower cost (difference: US$-2024) compared with 
placebo. In probabilistic sensitivity analyses, alteplase had a 42.54% to 78.3% 
probability of being cost-effective compared with placebo in China when the 
willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold ranged from ¥72 447/QALY to ¥217 341/QALY. In 
the US, alteplase had a 93.47% to 93.57% probability of being cost-effective 
under the WTP threshold of US$100 000/QALY to US$150 000/QALY. These findings 
remained robust under one-way sensitivity analysis.
CONCLUSION: For patients with AIS with a time of onset between 4.5 and 9 hours, 
perfusion imaging-guided intravenous alteplase was likely to be cost-effective 
in China and was cost-effective in the US when compared with placebo.

BACKGROUND: Chronic heart failure is a debilitating condition that accounts for 
an annual NHS spend of £2.3B. Low levels of endogenous coenzyme Q10 may 
exacerbate chronic heart failure. Coenzyme Q10 supplements might improve 
symptoms and slow progression. As statins are thought to block the production of 
coenzyme Q10, supplementation might be particularly beneficial for patients 
taking statins.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of 
coenzyme Q10 in managing chronic heart failure with a reduced ejection fraction.
METHODS: A systematic review that included randomised trials comparing coenzyme 
Q10 plus standard care with standard care alone in chronic heart failure. Trials 
restricted to chronic heart failure with a preserved ejection fraction were 
excluded. Databases including MEDLINE, EMBASE and CENTRAL were searched up to 
March 2020. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool 
(version 5.2). A planned individual participant data meta-analysis was not 
possible and meta-analyses were mostly based on aggregate data from 
publications. Potential effect modification was examined using meta-regression. 
A Markov model used treatment effects from the meta-analysis and baseline 
mortality and hospitalisation from an observational UK cohort. Costs were 
evaluated from an NHS and Personal Social Services perspective and expressed in 
Great British pounds at a 2019/20 price base. Outcomes were expressed in 
quality-adjusted life-years. Both costs and outcomes were discounted at a 3.5% 
annual rate.
RESULTS: A total of 26 trials, comprising 2250 participants, were included in 
the systematic review. Many trials were reported poorly and were rated as having 
a high or unclear risk of bias in at least one domain. Meta-analysis suggested a 
possible benefit of coenzyme Q10 on all-cause mortality (seven trials, 1371 
participants; relative risk 0.68, 95% confidence interval 0.45 to 1.03). The 
results for short-term functional outcomes were more modest or unclear. There 
was no indication of increased adverse events with coenzyme Q10. Meta-regression 
found no evidence of treatment interaction with statins. The base-case 
cost-effectiveness analysis produced incremental costs of £4878, incremental 
quality-adjusted life-years of 1.34 and an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
of £3650. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses showed that at thresholds of 
£20,000 and £30,000 per quality-adjusted life-year coenzyme Q10 had a high 
probability (95.2% and 95.8%, respectively) of being more cost-effective than 
standard care alone. Scenario analyses in which the population and other model 
assumptions were varied all found coenzyme Q10 to be cost-effective. The 
expected value of perfect information suggested that a new trial could be 
valuable.
LIMITATIONS: For most outcomes, data were available from few trials and 
different trials contributed to different outcomes. There were concerns about 
risk of bias and whether or not the results from included trials were applicable 
to a typical UK population. A lack of individual participant data meant that 
planned detailed analyses of effect modifiers were not possible.
CONCLUSIONS: Available evidence suggested that, if prescribed, coenzyme Q10 has 
the potential to be clinically effective and cost-effective for heart failure 
with a reduced ejection fraction. However, given important concerns about risk 
of bias, plausibility of effect sizes and applicability of the evidence base, 
establishing whether or not coenzyme Q10 is genuinely effective in a typical UK 
population is important, particularly as coenzyme Q10 has not been subject to 
the scrutiny of drug-licensing processes. Stronger evidence is needed before 
considering its prescription in the NHS.
FUTURE WORK: A new independent, well-designed clinical trial of coenzyme Q10 in 
a typical UK heart failure with a reduced ejection fraction population may be 
warranted.
STUDY REGISTRATION: This study is registered as PROSPERO CRD42018106189.
FUNDING: This project was funded by the National Institute for Health Research 
(NIHR) Health Technology Assessment programme and will be published in full in

website for further project information.

Plain Language Summary: People living with chronic heart failure suffer from 
shortness of breath, ankle swelling, tiredness, frequent stays in hospital and 
reduced quality of life and have shorter lives. The NHS spends over £2 billion 
each year managing chronic heart failure. Coenzyme Q10 is a vitamin-like 
substance made by the body that helps cells produce energy. Low levels of 
coenzyme Q10 in heart muscle may lead to, or exacerbate, chronic heart failure. 
Taking coenzyme Q10 supplements might improve symptoms or slow deterioration. To 
the best of our knowledge, we found all randomised clinical trials of coenzyme 
Q10 in patients with the type of chronic heart failure caused by muscle weakness 
(i.e. heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, where the heart's pumping 
function is weaker than normal). We asked the research groups responsible for 
these trials to provide the patient data that they had collected in their 
trials. Most research groups did not share their data and so we mainly used 
information from published trial reports. This limited our planned analyses. We 
found that taking coenzyme Q10 alongside usual treatment for heart failure with 
reduced ejection fraction potentially reduced deaths by approximately one-third 
and reduced readmission to hospital by around 40%. However, these results were 
uncertain. Side effects were not increased. We had some concerns about how 
reliable the data were, and it is not clear how well the results apply to UK 
patients. We also worked out what the benefits and costs to the NHS would be if 
coenzyme Q10 became available on prescription for patients with heart failure 
with reduced ejection fraction. Our model found that prescription could be 
worthwhile; however, a new trial is needed first to make sure that coenzyme Q10 
improves outcomes for patients. A new trial would be particularly important 
because coenzyme Q10 has not been assessed in the same way as prescribed 
medicines. A new trial could make sure that there is better evidence about 
whether or not prescribing would be a good use of NHS resources.

Engagement in lifelong HIV care is critical for both patient and public health, 
yet there are limited resources to invest in improving HIV outcomes. We 
systematically reviewed evidence on the cost-effectiveness of retention and 
re-engagement interventions. We searched five databases for peer-reviewed 
studies published between 2010 and 2020. We assessed reporting and methods 
quality, extracted data on target populations, interventions, and 
cost-effectiveness, and evaluated overall strength of evidence. Eleven studies 
met inclusion criteria, and eight had moderate-high quality. Cost-effectiveness 
estimates ranged from cost-saving to over $1,000,000/quality-adjusted life year 
(QALY) gained. Of the 73 cost-effectiveness ratios reported, 64% 
were < $100,000/QALY gained. Interventions were more likely to be cost-effective 
when targeted to high-risk groups, implemented in locations where baseline 
retention levels were low, and when used in combination with other high-impact 
HIV interventions (such as prevention). Overall, existing evidence is moderately 
strong that retention and/or re-engagement interventions can be cost-effective 
in high-income countries.

BACKGROUND: The health benefits of physical activity (PA) participation in later 
life are widely recognised. Understanding factors that can influence the 
participation of community-dwelling older adults in PA is crucial in an ageing 
society. This will be paramount in aiding the design of future interventions to 
effectively promote PA in this population. The main aim of this qualitative 
study was to explore influences on PA among community-dwelling older people, and 
the secondary aim was to explore gender differences.
METHODS: Qualitative data were collected in 2014 by conducting focus group 
discussions using a semi-structured discussion guide with older people resident 
in Hertfordshire, UK. Discussions were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim and 
transcripts analysed thematically.
RESULTS: Ninety-two participants were recruited to the study (47% women; 74-83 
years) and a total of 11 focus groups were conducted. Findings indicated six 
themes that appeared to affect older adults' participation in PA: past life 
experiences; significant life events; getting older; PA environment; 
psychological/personal factors; and social capital. Overall, the findings 
emphasised the role of modifiable factors, namely psychological factors (such as 
self-efficacy, motivation, outcome expectancy) and social factors (such as 
social support and social engagement). These factors exerted their own influence 
on physical activity participation, but also appeared to mediate the effect of 
other largely non-modifiable background and ageing-related factors on 
participants' engagement with PA in later life.
CONCLUSION: In view of these findings, intervention designers could usefully 
work with behavioural scientists for insight as to how to enhance psychological 
and social factors in older adults. Our data suggest that interventions that aim 
to build self-efficacy, motivation and social networks have the potential to 
indirectly promote PA participation in older adults. This would be best achieved 
by developing physical activity interventions through working with participants 
in an empowering and engaging way.

Progress in earlier detection and clinical management has increased life 
expectancy and quality of life in people with Down syndrome (DS). However, no 
drug has been approved to help individuals with DS live independently and fully. 
Although rat models could support more robust physiological, behavioral, and 
toxicology analysis than mouse models during preclinical validation, no DS rat 
model is available as a result of technical challenges. We developed a 
transchromosomic rat model of DS, TcHSA21rat, which contains a freely 
segregating, EGFP-inserted, human chromosome 21 (HSA21) with >93% of its 
protein-coding genes. RNA-seq of neonatal forebrains demonstrates that 
TcHSA21rat expresses HSA21 genes and has an imbalance in global gene expression. 
Using EGFP as a marker for trisomic cells, flow cytometry analyses of peripheral 
blood cells from 361 adult TcHSA21rat animals show that 81% of animals retain 
HSA21 in >80% of cells, the criterion for a "Down syndrome karyotype" in people. 
TcHSA21rat exhibits learning and memory deficits and shows increased anxiety and 
hyperactivity. TcHSA21rat recapitulates well-characterized DS brain morphology, 
including smaller brain volume and reduced cerebellar size. In addition, the rat 
model shows reduced cerebellar foliation, which is not observed in DS mouse 
models. Moreover, TcHSA21rat exhibits anomalies in craniofacial morphology, 
heart development, husbandry, and stature. TcHSA21rat is a robust DS animal 
model that can facilitate DS basic research and provide a unique tool for 
preclinical validation to accelerate DS drug development.

Primary myelofibrosis (PMF) is a chronic myeloproliferative neoplasm 
characterized by cytopenias, splenomegaly, and risk of leukemic transformation. 
In light of newer therapies, such as ruxolitinib, that are not curative but 
improve quality of life, the timing of transplantation needs more in-depth 
analysis to determine which patients would benefit from an early versus a 
delayed transplantation strategy. Because prospective clinical trials are 
impractical for diseases with only one curative option, such as PMF, we 
developed a Markov cohort model to simulate the long-term disease trajectory in 
patients with PMF and predict the optimal timing of transplantation stratified 
by Dynamic International Prognostic Scoring System (DIPSS) risk. In this 
decision model, a hypothetical cohort of patients begins in the alive with PMF 
state and can transition monthly to other health states. Transition 
probabilities were acquired from published literature. We performed 
probabilistic analyses by jointly varying all model parameters over 1000 
simulations. Irrespective of DIPSS risk, all patients with PMF benefited from 
transplantation with respect to life expectancy gained. Life expectancy gains 
from transplantation peaked at 9.7 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 9.5 to 
9.9 months) from diagnosis in patients with high-risk disease and at 16.6 months 
(95% CI, 16.4 to 16.8 months) from diagnosis in patients with intermediate-2 
disease. Patients with intermediate-1 risk had a delayed peak in net gain in 
life expectancy at 20.5 months (95% CI, 20.2 to 20.7 months). Patients with 
low-risk disease had a greater net gain in life expectancy the longer that 
transplantation was delayed; this trend plateaued at 29 to 45 months. Our 
modeling suggests that preparation for transplantation is indicated upfront for 
patients diagnosed with intermediate-2 risk and high-risk PMF, whereas this can 
be delayed for low-risk or intermediate-1 risk disease.

PURPOSE: Following treatment of HPV-driven oropharynx cancer, surveillance 
nasopharyngoscopy and imaging are often performed but are expensive and 
frequently ineffective. A novel plasma circulating tumor-tissue modified viral 
HPV DNA (TTMV-HPV-DNA) assay accurately detects recurrences. We modeled the cost 
of the new assay.
METHODS: We designed and validated a partitioned survival model which replicated 
the results of the RTOG 1016 study and calculated cumulative surveillance costs 
from the payer's perspective. Two strategies were considered: a standard of 
routine endoscopy with imaging as needed and an alternative strategy which 
omitted scopes and imaging but obtained serial TTMV-HPV-DNA samples. No 
difference in effectiveness (QALY or LY) was assumed in the base case. A 5-year 
horizon was used, costs were reported in 2020 U.S. dollars discounted by 3%. 
Seven scenarios tested model assumptions and practice variation. Deterministic 
and probabilistic sensitivity analyses assessed parameter uncertainty.
RESULTS: In the base case, at the list TTMV-HPV-DNA price, the cumulative cost 
of surveillance was $11,674 for the standard strategy and $20,756 for the 
TTMV-HPV-DNA strategy (+$9082 over 5 years). Probabilistic sensitivity analysis 
demonstrated the cost difference ranged from $4917-$12,047. The TTMV-HPV-DNA 
strategy was most likely to be either cost saving or cost-effective if future 
data demonstrate small improvements in quality or quantity of life 
(approximately 33 quality-adjusted life-days), if the assay reduces utilization 
of imaging, and if the periodicity of TTMV-HPV-DNA draws could be reduced from 
that on clinical trials.
CONCLUSIONS: This data informs providers seeking to design more accurate, 
accessible, and economical post-treatment surveillance strategies.

OBJECTIVE: Since increased mortality rates have been associated with convulsive 
seizures, it is important to achieve seizure control in these patients. Here, we 
report post hoc analyses to assess long-term seizure-freedom rates with 
adjunctive perampanel in patients (aged ≥ 12 years) with refractory focal to 
bilateral tonic-clonic seizures (FBTCS) or generalized tonic-clonic seizures 
(GTCS) who participated in open-label extension (OLEx) studies.
METHODS: Patients with focal-onset seizures, with/without FBTCS, who completed 
double-blind, Phase III Studies 304, 305, or 306 could enter OLEx Study 307 
(16-week blinded Conversion; 256-week Maintenance). Patients with GTCS who 
completed the double-blind phase of Study 332 could enter the OLEx Phase (6-week 
blinded Conversion; 136-week Maintenance). Maximum perampanel dose: 12 mg/day. 
Seizure-freedom rates for up to 24 months were assessed in perampanel-treated 
patients who achieved seizure freedom during the double-blind studies to 
determine if their seizure-free status was maintained during the OLEx. In 
addition, to ensure any patients who only achieved seizure freedom during the 
OLEx were captured, seizure-freedom rates were also assessed in all patients who 
achieved and maintained a seizure-free status for a period of at least six 
consecutive months at any time during the double-blind and/or OLEx studies; some 
of these patients may have received placebo during the double-blind study but 
only their time on perampanel is included in the seizure-free analysis. 
Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to identify predictive factors 
for achieving seizure freedom for at least 6 months. Treatment-emergent adverse 
events (TEAEs) were assessed.
RESULTS: Overall, 53.8% (n = 42/78) of patients who received perampanel and were 
FBTCS free during the double-blind studies remained seizure free for up to 
24 months during Study 307, and 31.6% (n = 6/19) of patients who were GTCS free 
during the double-blind phase of Study 332 remained seizure free for up to 
24 months during the OLEx Phase. Over 40% (FBTCS, 41.5% [n = 197/475]; GTCS, 
52.9% [n = 73/138]) of patients were seizure free for a period of at least six 
consecutive months. Multivariate analysis showed that the best predictors of 
achieving seizure freedom from FBTCS for at least 6 months were lower baseline 
seizure frequency (p = 0.0014) and absence of enzyme-inducing anti-seizure 
medications at baseline (p = 0.0056); multivariate analysis was not conducted 
for GTCS since only one variable was identified as a significant predictor of 
seizure freedom in the univariate analysis (lower baseline seizure frequency). 
Perampanel was generally well tolerated with no new safety signals identified. 
The most common TEAE was dizziness. For both seizure types, 10% or fewer 
seizure-free patients discontinued perampanel due to TEAEs.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that adjunctive perampanel may be a suitable 
long-term treatment option for patients (aged ≥ 12 years) with convulsive 
seizures to achieve and maintain seizure freedom.

BACKGROUND: There is increasing evidence for the potential benefits and harms of 
cardiovascular disease (CVD) medications in older people (>75 years) prompting 
updating of clinical guidelines. We explored the views of older people about CVD 
medication to inform guideline development.
METHODS: Qualitative study using semistructured interviews and focus groups. An 
ethnically diverse group of community dwelling older people were purposefully 
recruited from northern New Zealand using flyers in primary care clinics, local 
libraries, social groups, and places of worship, and by word of mouth. 
Interviews and focus groups were digitally recorded, transcribed verbatim, and 
analysed using an iterative and inductive approach to thematic analysis.
RESULTS: Thirty-nine participants from 4 ethnic groups were recruited (mean 74 
years; range 61-91 years; Māori (7), South Asian (8), European (9), and Pasifika 
(15)). Most participants were taking CVD medication/s. Four main themes emerged: 
(i) emphasizing the benefits of CVD medication and downplaying the harms; (ii) 
feeling compelled to take medication; (iii) trusting "my" doctor; and (iv) 
expecting medication to be continued.
CONCLUSION: Findings raise questions about older people's agency in 
decision-making regarding CVD medication. CVD risk management guidelines for 
older people could include strategies to support effective communication of the 
potential benefits and harms of CVD medication in older people, balancing life 
expectancy, and the expected duration of therapy.

Plain Language Summary: We explored the views of older people about 
cardiovascular disease (CVD) medication. Qualitative study using semistructured 
interviews and focus groups. An ethnically diverse group of community dwelling 
older people were purposefully recruited from northern New Zealand. Interviews 
and focus groups were digitally recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analysed. 
Thirty-nine participants from 4 ethnic groups were recruited (mean 74 years; 
range 61–91 years; Māori (7), South Asian (8), European (9), and Pasifika (15)). 
Most participants were taking CVD medication/s. Participants emphasized the 
benefits of medication and downplayed the harms; they did not want to take 
medication but felt compelled to; they trusted their doctor to know best 
regarding medication; and they believed their doctor wanted them to keep taking 
medication. Findings raise questions about older people’s agency in 
decision-making regarding medication. Work is needed to identify strategies to 
support effective communication of the potential benefits and harms of 
medication in older people, balancing life expectancy, and the expected duration 
of therapy.

    Circulation. 2022 Sep 6;146(10):e141.

BACKGROUND: The American Heart Association, in conjunction with the National 
Institutes of Health, annually reports the most up-to-date statistics related to 
heart disease, stroke, and cardiovascular risk factors, including core health 
behaviors (smoking, physical activity, diet, and weight) and health factors 
(cholesterol, blood pressure, and glucose control) that contribute to 
cardiovascular health. The Statistical Update presents the latest data on a 
range of major clinical heart and circulatory disease conditions (including 
stroke, congenital heart disease, rhythm disorders, subclinical atherosclerosis, 
coronary heart disease, heart failure, valvular disease, venous disease, and 
peripheral artery disease) and the associated outcomes (including quality of 
care, procedures, and economic costs).
METHODS: The American Heart Association, through its Statistics Committee, 
continuously monitors and evaluates sources of data on heart disease and stroke 
in the United States to provide the most current information available in the 
annual Statistical Update. The 2022 Statistical Update is the product of a full 
year's worth of effort by dedicated volunteer clinicians and scientists, 
committed government professionals, and American Heart Association staff 
members. This year's edition includes data on the monitoring and benefits of 
cardiovascular health in the population and an enhanced focus on social 
determinants of health, adverse pregnancy outcomes, vascular contributions to 
brain health, and the global burden of cardiovascular disease and healthy life 
expectancy.
RESULTS: Each of the chapters in the Statistical Update focuses on a different 
topic related to heart disease and stroke statistics.
CONCLUSIONS: The Statistical Update represents a critical resource for the lay 
public, policymakers, media professionals, clinicians, health care 
administrators, researchers, health advocates, and others seeking the best 
available data on these factors and conditions.

BACKGROUND: Knee trauma permanently elevates one's risk for knee osteoarthritis. 
Despite this, people at-risk of post-traumatic knee osteoarthritis rarely seek 
or receive care, and accessible and efficacious interventions to promote knee 
health after injury are lacking. Exercise can ameliorate some mechanisms and 
independent risk factors for osteoarthritis and, education and action-planning 
improve adherence to exercise and promote healthy behaviours.
METHODS: To assess the efficacy of a virtually-delivered, physiotherapist-guided 
exercise-based program (SOAR) to improve knee health in persons discharged from 
care after an activity-related knee injury, 70 people (16-35 years of age, 
12-48 months post-injury) in Vancouver Canada will be recruited for a two-arm 
step-wedged assessor-blinded delayed-control randomized trial. Participants will 
be randomly allocated to receive the intervention immediately or after a 10-week 
delay. The program consists of 1) one-time Knee Camp (group education, 1:1 
individualized exercise and activity goal-setting); 2) weekly individualized 
home-based exercise and activity program with tracking, and; 3) weekly 1:1 
physiotherapy-guided action-planning with optional group exercise class. 
Outcomes will be measured at baseline, 9- (primary endpoint), and 18-weeks. The 
primary outcome is 9-week change in knee extension strength (normalized peak 
concentric torque; isokinetic dynamometer). Secondary outcomes include 9-week 
change in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (accelerometer) and 
self-reported knee-related quality-of-life (Knee injury and OA Outcome Score 
subscale) and self-efficacy (Knee Self Efficacy Scale). Exploratory outcomes 
include 18-week change in primary and secondary outcomes, and 9- and 18- week 
change in other components of knee extensor and flexor muscle function, hop 
function, and self-reported symptoms, function, physical activity, social 
support, perceived self-care and kinesiophobia. Secondary study objectives will 
assess the feasibility of a future hybrid effectiveness-implementation trial 
protocol, determine the optimal intervention length, and explore stakeholder 
experiences.
DISCUSSION: This study will assess the efficacy of a novel, virtually-delivered, 
physiotherapist-guided exercise-based program to optimize knee health in persons 
at increased risk of osteoarthritis due to a past knee injury. Findings will 
provide valuable information to inform the management of osteoarthritis risk 
after knee trauma and the conduct of a future effectiveness-implementation 
trial.

Murine double minute 2 (Mdm2) is the principal E3-ubiquitin ligase for p53 and 
contains a C2H2C4 type RING domain wherein the last cysteine residue is followed 
by an evolutionarily conserved 13 amino acid C-terminal tail. Previous studies 
have indicated that integrity of the C-terminal tail is critical for Mdm2 
function. Recently, a mutation extending the MDM2 length by five amino acids was 
identified and associated with enhanced p53 response in fibroblasts and 
premature aging in a human patient. To investigate the importance of the 
conserved Mdm2 C-terminal length on p53 regulatory function in vivo, we 
engineered three novel mouse alleles using CRISPR-Cas9 technology. Genetic 
studies with these murine models showed that curtailing Mdm2 C-terminal length 
by even a single amino acid leads to p53-dependent embryonic lethality. 
Extension of the Mdm2 C-terminal length by five amino acids (QLTCL) yielded 
viable mice that are smaller in size, exhibit fertility problems, and have a 
shortened life span. Analysis of early passage mouse embryonic fibroblasts 
indicated impaired Mdm2 function correlates with enhanced p53 activity under 
stress conditions. Furthermore, analysis in mice showed tissue-specific 
alterations in p53 target gene expression and enhanced radiosensitivity. These 
results confirm the physiological importance of the evolutionarily conserved 
Mdm2 C-terminus in regulating p53 functions.
SIGNIFICANCE: This in vivo study highlights that alterations to the C-terminus 
of Mdm2 perturb its regulation of the tumor suppressor p53.

BACKGROUND: Transcatheter edge-to-edge mitral valve repair (TMVr) improves 
symptoms and survival for patients with heart failure with reduced left 
ventricular ejection fraction (HFrEF) and severe secondary mitral regurgitation 
despite guideline-recommended medical therapy (GRMT). Whether TMVr is 
cost-effective from a UK National Health Service (NHS) perspective is unknown.
METHODS: We used patient-level data from the Cardiovascular Outcomes Assessment 
of the MitraClip Percutaneous Therapy for Heart Failure Patients with Functional 
Mitral Regurgitation (COAPT) trial to perform a cost-effectiveness analysis of 
TMVr +GRMT versus GRMT alone from an NHS perspective. Costs for the TMVr 
procedure were based on standard English tariffs and device costs. Subsequent 
costs were estimated based on data acquired during the trial. Health utilities 
were estimated using the Short-Form 6-Dimension Health Survey.
