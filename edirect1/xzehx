BACKGROUND: Fecal immunochemical test (FIT) is for colorectal cancer (CRC) 
screening. Its association with non-CRC mortality has been overlooked. Given the 
quantitative FIT values, its dose-response relationships with different causes 
of deaths and years of life shortened were assessed.
METHODS: This retrospective study included 546,214 adults aged ≥ 20 who attended 
a health surveillance program from 1994 to 2017 and were followed up until the 
end of 2020. FIT ≥ 20 μg Hb/g was defined as positive. The Cox model was used to 
assess adjusted hazard ratios (aHR).
RESULTS: Positive FIT was associated with increased all-cause mortality (aHR: 
1.34, 95 % CI: 1.25-1.44) and all-cancer mortality (aHR: 1.71, 95 % CI: 
1.55-1.89), with a reduction of life expectancy by 4 years. The association 
remained even with CRC excluded. With each 10 μg Hb/g increase in FIT above 
20 μg Hb/g, life expectancy was reduced by one year, and mortality increased by 
4 %. About 18.6 % of deaths with positive FIT were attributed to cardiovascular 
disease (CVD), followed by CRC (13.5 %) and upper gastrointestinal (GI) cancers 
(4.5 %). The all-cause mortality rate after excluding CRC for positive FIT was 
3.56/1,000 person-year, comparable to the all-cause mortality rate of 3.69/1,000 
person-year for hypertension.
CONCLUSION: Positive FIT was associated with increased mortality in a 
dose-response manner and shortened life expectancy by 4 years, an overlooked 
risk comparable to hypertension, even with CRC excluded. After a negative 
colonoscopy, subjects with positive FIT should undergo a workup on CVD risk 
factors and look for other upper GI cancers.

Cashmere, a highly valuable animal product derived from cashmere goats, holds 
significant economic importance. MiRNAs serve as crucial regulators in the 
developmental processes of mammalian hair follicles. Understanding the 
regulation of miRNAs during the hair follicle cycle is essential for enhancing 
cashmere quality. In this investigation, we employed high-throughput sequencing 
technology to analyze the expression profiles of miRNAs in the secondary hair 
follicles of Jiangnan cashmere goats at different stages. Through bioinformatics 
analysis, we identified differentially expressed miRNAs (DE miRNAs). The 
regulatory relationships between miRNAs and their target genes were verified 
using multiple techniques, including RT-qPCR, western blot, Dual-Luciferase 
Reporter, and CKK-8 assays. Our findings revealed the presence of 193 DE miRNAs 
during various stages of the hair follicle cycle in Jiangnan cashmere goats. 
Based on the previously obtained mRNA data, the target genes of DE miRNA were 
predicted, and 1,472 negative regulatory relationships between DE miRNAs and 
target genes were obtained. Notably, the expression of chi-miR-877-3p was 
down-regulated during the telogen (Tn) phase compared to the anagen (An) and 
catagen (Cn) phases, while the IGFBP5 gene exhibited up-regulation. Further 
validation experiments confirmed that overexpression of chi-miR-877-3p in dermal 
papilla cells suppressed IGFBP5 gene expression and facilitated cell 
proliferation. The results of this study provide novel insights for analyzing 
the hair follicle cycle.

Plain Language Summary: Cashmere goats, known for their diverse range of animal 
products including delectable meat, soft sheepskin, and high-quality natural 
fiber, offer an excellent opportunity to explore hair regeneration as they 
represent a heterogenous fur mammal. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNA 
molecules encoded by approximately 3% of mammalian genes. Remarkably, they have 
the ability to regulate around 30% of protein-coding genes. Given that a single 
miRNA can target multiple genes, they exert control over various biological 
functions such as metabolism, growth, development, and immunity. In this study, 
we found that miR-877-3p is able to regulate the expression of insulin-like 
growth factor binding protein 5 (IGFBP5), a key gene involved in the development 
of the hair follicle cycle. Investigating the regulatory role of miRNAs in the 
hair follicle cycle of cashmere goats provides a novel perspective for 
unraveling the mechanisms underlying hair follicle growth and development in 
mammals.

As life expectancy continues to increase, so do disorders related to the 
musculoskeletal system. Orthopedics-related impairments remain a challenge, with 
nearly 325 thousand and 120 thousand deaths recorded in 2019. Musculoskeletal 
system, including bone and cartilage tissue, is a living system in which cells 
constantly interact with the immune system, which plays a key role in the tissue 
repair process. An alternative to bridge the gap between these two systems is 
exploiting nanomaterials, as they have proven to serve as delivery agents of an 
array of molecules, including immunomodulatory agents (anti-inflammatory drugs, 
cytokines), as well as having the ability to mimic tissue by their nanoscopic 
structure and promote tissue repair per se. Therefore, this review outlooks 
nanomaterials and immunomodulatory factors widely employed in the area of bone 
and cartilage tissue engineering. Emerging developments in nanomaterials for 
delivery of immunomodulatory agents for bone and cartilage tissue engineering 
applications have also been discussed. It can be concluded that latest progress 
in nanotechnology have enabled to design intricate systems with the ability to 
deliver biologically active agents, promoting tissue repair and regeneration; 
thus, nanomaterials studied herein have shown great potential to serve as 
immunomodulatory agents in the area of tissue engineering.

BACKGROUND: The life expectancy of people with Down syndrome (DS) is limited by 
Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related deaths, mainly due to respiratory infections. 
The emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic could have changed known, past trends in 
mortality in this population. We analysed the differences in causes of mortality 
between individuals with DS deceased before and after the onset of the pandemic.
METHOD: This is a cross-sectional study of adults with DS recruited at a 
tertiary, university outpatient clinic in Madrid, Spain. Demographic and 
clinical data were retrospectively collected from their medical records, 
including information on their deaths, if any.
RESULTS: Five hundred seventy-two adults were included in the study, and 67 
(11.7%) died. The main cause of death was respiratory infections, which occurred 
in 36 participants [9 (45.0%) before, and 27 (58.7%) after the appearance of 
COVID-19]. No significant differences were found in the determinants of 
pre-pandemic and post-pandemic death after adjusting for age and AD, except for 
an association between the use of psychotropic medication and death in the 
post-pandemic period (odds ratio: 2.24; 95% confidence interval: 1.04-4.82). 
Vaccination against COVID-19 showed a marked protective effect against mortality 
(odds ratio: 0.0002; 95% confidence interval: 6.7e10-6 to 0.004).
CONCLUSIONS: The appearance of COVID-19 has not impacted the overall trend of 
increase in mean age of death of adults with DS in our milieu, probably thanks 
to the very important protective effect of vaccination, which supports 
prioritising people with DS in future immunisation campaigns. The association 
between psychotropic medication use and mortality requires further exploration.

OBJECTIVES: Sarcopenia is well known to be associated with mortality, but there 
is a lack of evidence on the estimates of life expectancy (LE) for sarcopenia in 
China. This study aims to estimate total life expectancy (TLE) and 
sarcopenia-specific LE in community-dwelling older Chinese adults with and 
without sarcopenia.
METHODS: This study included participants aged 60 years and older who enrolled 
in the cohort in 2011 and 2013 and at least completed one follow-up until 2015 
as part of the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS). The 
criteria for defining sarcopenia were based on the guidelines established by the 
Asian Working Group on Sarcopenia in 2019. TLE and sarcopenia-specific LE were 
estimated for the total population and subgroups using continuous-time 
multistate modeling.
RESULTS: A total of 6,029 participants (49.2% women) with an average age of 68.4 
(SD: 6.56) years were included in the study. The baseline prevalence of 
sarcopenia and possible sarcopenia was 19.5 and 44.9%, respectively. We observed 
that sarcopenia stages naturally deteriorated to worse stages (including death, 
by 24.4%) and returned to better stages (17.1%) during a median follow-up of 
3.92 years (IQR: 2.00 ~ 4.00). The average TLE at the age of 60 was 20.9 
[95% CI: 20.2-21.5] years (22.1 [95% CI: 19.6-24.6] for non-sarcopenic older 
adults, 20.9 [95% CI: 19.5-22.3] for possible sarcopenic, and 18.7 [95% CI: 
16.4-21.1] for sarcopenic). Men, former and current smokers, and those living in 
northwest China had less TLE. Sarcopenic older adults, those with lower 
education, those who are unmarried, those with agriculture hukou, and those 
living in rural and northwest China were expected to live fewer years with 
non-sarcopenia. Sarcopenic older people, men, those with agriculture hukou, and 
those living in rural and southwest China were expected to live more years with 
sarcopenia.
DISCUSSION: The results improved our understanding of the relationship between 
sarcopenia and life expectancy. We suggested that targeted strategies should be 
considered in high-risk populations and underdeveloped regions to prevent 
sarcopenia and improve non-sarcopenic life years for the older population.

BACKGROUND: Despite Hong Kong's world leading longevity, little is known about 
its associated disability burden and social patterning. Hence, this study 
assessed the gender-specific secular trends and area-level inequalities in life 
expectancy (LE) and disability-free life expectancy (DFLE) at age 65 in Hong 
Kong.
METHODS: Population structure, death records, and disability data in 2007, 2013, 
and 2020 were retrieved from the Census and Statistics Department to estimate LE 
and DFLE using the Sullivan Method. District-based sociodemographic indicators 
were used to compare LE and DFLE across 18 districts of Hong Kong in 2013.
FINDINGS: Between 2007 and 2020, LE at age 65 increased by 3.7 years (from 18.3 
to 22.0) in men and by 2.1 years (from 22.7 to 24.8) in women. By contrast, DFLE 
increased more slowly, by 1.8 years (from 14.6 to 16.3) in men and by only 0.1 
year (from 16.4 to 16.5) in women, leading to a substantial increase in 
proportion of life spent with disability. Results from multiple linear 
regression using district-based data in 2013 showed a similar extent of 
associations of education with LE and DFLE (mean year difference: 0.81 [95% CI: 
0.14, 1.48] and 0.68 [0.10, 1.27], respectively, per 10% increase in average 
education level), while female gender was more strongly associated with LE (4.44 
[3.56, 5.31]) than with DFLE (2.00 [1.18, 2.82]).
INTERPRETATION: Expansion of disability burden and male-female health-survival 
paradox hold true in Hong Kong. Unlike Western countries with a stronger 
socioeconomic patterning of DFLE, the extent of area-level socioeconomic 
inequalities in LE and DFLE appears to be more comparable in Hong Kong.

BACKGROUND: The increasing life expectancy and the growing number of older 
people are becoming public health challenges, warranting the need for 
appropriate policy tools. Existing policy frameworks should prioritize and cover 
the public health demands of elders. However, there is a lack of concrete 
evidence on the existing policy tools and programs targeting elders in Ethiopia.
OBJECTIVE: This study was to explore the existing policies, programs, and 
interventions for elderly people in Ethiopia.
STUDY DESIGN: A descriptive qualitative study using phenomenological approach 
and secondary data review wa conducted.
METHODS: A combination of systematic desk reviews of relevant policy and program 
documents and key informant interviews (KIIs) was used to capture data. Four 
purposefully selected interviews, based on their expertise, rich experience, 
in-depth understanding, and direct involvement in the policy environment, were 
conducted. Face-to-face interviews with the Audio recorder were employed during 
KII. The number of KIIs was limited to four, the point of theoretical saturation 
where no further new and informative themes were identified. Interview audios 
were transcribed, translated, and analyzed in thematic descriptive analysis. The 
United Nations Madrid International Plan of Action on Aging was used as a 
guideline for the data extraction process from relevant documents.
RESULTS: A total of 221 documents were retrieved, and 75 met the inclusion 
criteria. We identified four interconnected main themes and 11 sub-themes of 
concern for the elderly. Ethiopia recognized old people as vulnerable in various 
national legal and policy documents, including the constitution, population 
policy, and development plans. Surprisingly, no government policy exists in 
Ethiopia to address the health and nutritional problems of the elderly in 
particular.
CONCLUSION: Though Ethiopia is facing demographic transition, no specific 
old-age policies, programs, or interventions are being implemented. Hence, the 
government and relevant stakeholders should strive to design and implement an 
old-age policy outlining cost-effective interventions for elders.

BACKGROUND: Health status and life expectancy are important considerations for 
assessing potential benefits and harms of colorectal cancer (CRC) screening 
programs, particularly among older adults.
METHODS: We examined receipt of past-year CRC screening according to predicted 
10-year mortality risk among 25,888 community-dwelling adults aged 65-84 years 
who were not up-to-date with screening in the nationwide National Health 
Interview Survey. Ten-year mortality risk was estimated using a validated index; 
from the lowest to highest quintiles of the index, risk was 12%, 24%, 39%, 58%, 
and 79%, respectively. We also examined the proportion of screening performed 
among adults with life expectancy <10 years.
RESULTS: The prevalence of past-year CRC screening was 39.5%, 40.6%, 38.7%, 
36.4%, and 35.4%, from the lowest to highest quintile of 10-year mortality risk. 
Odds of CRC screening did not differ between adults in the lowest vs highest 
quintile (adjusted odds ratio 1.05, 95% confidence interval: 0.93-1.20). 
One-quarter (27.9%) of past-year CRC screening occurred in adults with life 
expectancy <10 years, and more than half (50.7%) of adults aged 75-84 years had 
10-year mortality risk ≥50% at the time of screening. In an exploratory 
analysis, invasive but not noninvasive screening increased as 10-year mortality 
risk increased ( P < 0.05) among adults aged 70-79 years.
DISCUSSION: Past-year CRC screening does not differ by predicted 10-year 
mortality risk. An age-based approach to CRC screening results in underscreening 
of older, healthier adults and overscreening of younger adults with chronic 
conditions. Personalized screening with incorporation of individual life 
expectancy may increase the value of CRC screening programs.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder 
characterized by progressive loss of motor neurons in the spinal cord. Although 
the disease's pathophysiological mechanism remains poorly understood, 
multifactorial mechanisms affecting motor neuron loss converge to worsen the 
disease. Although two FDA-approved drugs, riluzole and edaravone, targeting 
excitotoxicity and oxidative stress, respectively, are available, their 
efficacies are limited to extending survival by only a few months. Here, we 
developed combinatorial drugs targeting multifactorial mechanisms underlying key 
components in ALS disease progression. Using data analysis based on the genetic 
information of patients with ALS-derived cells and pharmacogenomic data of the 
drugs, a combination of nebivolol and donepezil (nebivolol-donepezil) was 
identified for ALS therapy. Here, nebivolol-donepezil markedly reduced the 
levels of cytokines in the microglial cell line, inhibited nuclear factor-κB 
(NF-κB) nucleus translocation in the HeLa cell and substantially protected 
against excitotoxicity-induced neuronal loss by regulating the PI3K-Akt pathway. 
Nebivolol-donepezil significantly promoted the differentiation of neural 
progenitor cells (NPC) into motor neurons. Furthermore, we verified the low dose 
efficacy of nebivolol-donepezil on multiple indices corresponding to the quality 
of life of patients with ALS in vivo using SOD1G93A mice. Nebivolol-donepezil 
delayed motor function deterioration and halted motor neuronal loss in the 
spinal cord. Drug administration effectively suppressed muscle atrophy by 
mitigating the proportion of smaller myofibers and substantially reducing 
phospho-neurofilament heavy chain (pNF-H) levels in the serum, a promising ALS 
biomarker. High-dose nebivolol-donepezil significantly prolonged survival and 
delayed disease onset compared with vehicle-treated mice. These results indicate 
that the combination of nebivolol-donepezil efficiently prevents ALS disease 
progression, benefiting the patients' quality of life and life expectancy.

Aging normally leads to profound changes in the homeostasis of carbohydrate 
metabolism, which is considered a good predictor of health state and life 
expectancy. The objective of this study was assessing main indicators of 
carbohydrate metabolism in Northern men of older ages living under conditions of 
the North-Eastern region of Russia (Magadan). The results of the study showed 
carbohydrate disorders in healthy elderly men who exhibited high values of 
fasting plasma glucose (5,81±0,20 mmol/L) and glycosylated hemoglobin 
(5,73±0,12%), mainly owing to elevated insulin resistance (HOMA-IR was 2,63±0,25 
arb. units), and not to reduced pancreatic β-cells function (HOMA-β was 
96,85±6,10%), in the absence of a compensatory increase in basal insulin levels 
(9,97±0,81 µm/mL). Carbohydrate metabolism tenduence in healthy elderly men 
appears to worsen cardiometabolic health in older residents of the North. Our 
data confirm those by other authors and indicate the formation of age-associated 
pathology that causes accelerated aging of the body.

Publisher: Старение приводит к глубоким изменениям в гомеостазе углеводного 
обмена, который считается хорошим предиктором здоровья и увеличения 
продолжительности жизни. Цель работы — изучение основных характеристик 
углеводного обмена у мужчин-северян пожилого возраста, проживающих в условиях 
Северо-Восточного региона России (Магадан). Результаты исследования показали, 
что нарушение углеводного обмена у здоровых мужчин пожилого возраста проявлялось 
высоким уровнем глюкозы в плазме натощак (5,81±0,20 ммоль/л), гликированного 
гемоглобина (5,73±0,12%) главным образом из-за повышенной резистентности к 
инсулину (HOMA-IR составил 2,63±0,25 у. е.), а не снижения функции β-клеток 
поджелудочной железы (HOMA-β составил 96,85±6,10%), при отсутствии 
компенсаторного возрастания уровня базального инсулина (9,97±0,81 мкМе/мл). 
Выявленное нарушение углеводного обмена у здоровых мужчин пожилого возраста 
отражает тенденцию снижения кардиометаболического здоровья у пожилых 
жителей-северян. Данные, полученные в нашей работе, согласуются с 
представленными в литературе результатами исследований других авторов и 
свидетельствуют о формировании возраст-ассоциированной патологии, приводящей к 
ускоренному старению организма.

A long history of discriminatory policies in the United States has created 
disparities in neighborhood resources that shape ethnoracial health inequities 
today. To quantify these differences, we organized publicly available data on 
forty-two variables at the census tract level within nine domains affected by 
structural racism: built environment, criminal justice, education, employment, 
housing, income and poverty, social cohesion, transportation, and wealth. Using 
data from multiple sources at several levels of geography, we developed scores 
in each domain, as well as a summary score that we call the Structural Racism 
Effect Index. We examined correlations with life expectancy and other measures 
of health for this index and other commonly used area-based indices. The 
Structural Racism Effect Index was more strongly associated with each health 
outcome than were the other indices. Its domain and summary scores can be used 
to describe differences in social risk factors, and they provide powerful new 
tools to guide policies and investments to advance health equity.

Tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) is the gold standard for emergency 
treatment of ischemic stroke, which is the third leading cause of death 
worldwide. Major challenges of tPA therapy are its rapid elimination by 
plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) and hepatic clearance, leading to the 
use of high doses and consequent serious side effects, including internal 
bleeding, swelling and low blood pressure. In this regard, we developed three 
polyethylene glycol (PEG)ylated tPA bioconjugates based on the recombinant human 
tPA drug Alteplase using site-specific conjugation strategies. The first 
bioconjugate with PEGylation at the N-terminus of tPA performed by reductive 
alkylation showed a reduced proteolytic activity of 68 % compared to wild type 
tPA. PEGylation at the single-free cysteine of tPA with linear and branched PEG 
revealed similar proteolytic activities as the wild-type protein. Moreover, both 
bioconjugates with PEG-cysteine-modification showed 2-fold slower inhibition 
kinetics by PAI-1. All bioconjugates increased in hydrodynamic size as a 
critical requirement for half-life extension.

IMPORTANCE: The likelihood of benefit from a preventive intervention in an older 
adult depends on its time-to-benefit and the adult's life expectancy. For 
example, the time-to-benefit from cancer screening is >10 years, so adults with 
<10-year life expectancy are unlikely to benefit.
OBJECTIVE: To examine receipt of screening for breast, prostate, or colorectal 
cancer and receipt of immunizations by 10-year life expectancy.
DESIGN: Analysis of 2019 National Health Interview Survey.
PARTICIPANTS: 8,329 non-institutionalized adults >65 years seen by a healthcare 
professional in the past year, representing 46.9 million US adults.
MAIN MEASURES: Proportions of breast, prostate, and colorectal cancer 
screenings, and immunizations, were stratified by 10-year life expectancy, 
estimated using a validated mortality index. We used logistic regression to 
examine receipt of cancer screening and immunizations by life expectancy and 
sociodemographic factors.
KEY RESULTS: Overall, 54.7% of participants were female, 41.4% were >75 years, 
and 76.4% were non-Hispanic White. Overall, 71.5% reported being current with 
colorectal cancer screening, including 61.4% of those with <10-year life 
expectancy. Among women, 67.0% reported a screening mammogram in the past 2 
years, including 42.8% with <10-year life expectancy. Among men, 56.8% reported 
prostate specific antigen screening in the past two years, including 48.3% with 
<10-year life expectancy. Reported receipt of immunizations varied from 72.0% 
for influenza, 68.8% for pneumococcus, 57.7% for tetanus, and 42.6% for shingles 
vaccination. Lower life expectancy was associated with decreased likelihood of 
cancer screening and shingles vaccination but with increased likelihood of 
pneumococcal vaccination.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite the long time-to-benefit from cancer screening, in 2019 
many US adults age >65 with <10-year life expectancy reported undergoing cancer 
screening while many did not receive immunizations with a shorter 
time-to-benefit. Interventions to improve individualization of preventive care 
based on older adults' life expectancy may improve care of older adults.

BACKGROUND: The global aging population is expanding rapidly and many 
individuals have a particularly higher risk of malnutrition. Malnutrition can 
lead to impaired body function, morbidity, and mortality. Meeting nutritional 
requirements is a key strategy to minimize multiple debilitating adverse 
outcomes associated with malnutrition in the elderly. Oral nutritional 
supplements (ONS) have been widely used as a dietary intervention for 
malnutrition in older adults. These supplements provide additional nutrients and 
calories to support nutritional requirements and have been shown to improve 
nutritional status, physical function, and quality of life in malnourished older 
adults.
METHODS: This is an open-label, randomized controlled, parallel-group study 
including 50 institutionalized older adults (aged > 60 years) with malnutrition 
or at risk of malnutrition, living in a selected elderly care institution in 
Colombo, Sri Lanka. The aim is to assess improvement in healthy body weight gain 
and body composition in older adults with malnutrition at risk of malnutrition 
by using an ONS. Older adults will be screened for malnutrition using the Mini 
Nutrition Assessment (MNA) tool and eligible participants randomized using the 
simple random sampling technique to intervention and control groups (1:1 
allocation ratio). The intervention group will consume 200 mL of ONS before bed 
continuously for 12 weeks. The primary outcome is the percentage who achieved at 
least 5% weight gain in the intervention group compared to the control group. 
Nutritional status (anthropometric, biochemical, clinical, and dietary), body 
composition (dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry), frailty, functional capacity 
(hand grip strength, knee extension, and Barthel index) cognitive status 
(Montreal Cognitive Assessment), and physical activity will be assessed as 
secondary outcomes at baseline and at the end of the 12-week intervention. Some 
measurements (anthropometry, dietary, and functional assessments) will also be 
performed at the end of the 4th week. Data will be analyzed using SPSS V-23.
DISCUSSION: This study will determine whether the use of an ONS is effective in 
promoting healthy weight gain in older adults with malnutrition or at risk of 
malnutrition. In addition, investigating the impact of an ONS on multiple 
outcomes via clinical, nutritional, functional, and cognitive function will 
provide a more comprehensive understanding of the potential benefits of these 
supplements.

Unmet needs in street homeless people: a commentary on multiple interconnected 
needs in a vulnerable group.

Albert R(1), Baillie D(1), Neal H(1).

Author information:
(1)East London Foundation Trust, London, UK.

Street homeless people face stigmas in addition multiple unmet needs, which may 
include physical, psychological, mental health and social needs to name a few. 
Their life expectancy is shorter than that of the general population. Mental 
health problems are common but street homeless people face considerable barriers 
accessing support. Institutional approaches from the health system re-traumatise 
street homeless people seeking care and cause moral injury and burn-out in 
staff. Given high rates of trauma in street homeless people, trauma-informed 
care approaches should be used. Professionals should make every contact count, 
using it as an opportunity to build trust with honesty and consistency and find 
out what matters to the person, as well as taking practical steps such as 
ensuring a means of contact. Engaging with the person's wider support system, 
such as support workers from homeless organisations, is key as they may have a 
good understanding how the mental health affects the person.

BACKGROUND: This study aimed to investigate the effects of MUVON PLUS, a dietary 
supplement containing hydrolized collagen, chondroitin sulfate, and vitamin C, 
on the biomechanical behavior of the knee joint in patients with second-degree 
osteoarthritis (OA).
MATERIAL AND METHOD: The study included 15 participants who underwent 
biomechanical testing before and after 3 and 6 months of supplement 
administration. Biometrics and SimiMotion software were used to process and 
analyze the data. Results showed significant improvements in biomechanical 
parameters such as joint range of motion, joint torque, and joint stiffness for 
all patients during the treatment. Improvements were observed across various 
tests, including horizontal walking, stairs climbing and descending, 
sitting/standing up from a chair, and knee squats. This improvement in 
biomechanical performance was also reflected in the patients' reported quality 
of life. For the stairs climbing test, the maximum flexion-extension angle 
increased by approximately 7% after 3 months and 12% after 6 months. In the 
stairs descending test, the maximum flexion-extension angle increased by 
approximately 8% after 3 months and 19% after 6 months. These results highlight 
an improvement in mobility for the study participants.
CONCLUSIONS: Significant improvements of the biomechanical parameters of the 
knee joint were found in all patients during the treatment with the MUVON PLUS 
in all tests, which indicates the clear clinical benefit, revealed by improving 
the quality of life reported by patients. Overall, the study demonstrated the 
effectiveness of MUVON PLUS in enhancing the biomechanical behavior of the knee 
joint in patients with OA, providing valuable insights for future research and 
treatment.

BACKGROUND: The paliperidone palmitate 6-month (PP6M) long-acting injectable 
formulation is currently the longest dosing interval available for schizophrenia 
treatment.
OBJECTIVE: To compare treatment outcomes between a real-world external 
comparator arm (ECA; NeuroBlu database) and the PP6M open-label extension (OLE) 
clinical trial arm.
METHODS: The ECA comprised patients receiving PP 1-month (PP1M) or PP 3-month 
(PP3M) for ⩾12 months without a relapse. The PP6M OLE arm included patients with 
PP1M treatment prior to randomization who completed the 12-month double-blind 
PP6M study on either PP3M or PP6M relapse-free. Inverse probability treatment 
weighting (IPTW) was used to study time-to-relapse (primary outcome) and change 
in Clinical Global Impressions-Severity (CGI-S) score (secondary outcome).
RESULTS: At 24 months, 3.9% (7/178) of patients in the PP6M cohort experienced a 
relapse versus 15.6% (26/167) in the ECA. Time-to-relapse was longer in the PP6M 
cohort versus the ECA at 12-, 18-, and 24-months across the different weighting 
methods; median time-to-relapse was not reached in both cohorts. Hazard ratio 
(HR) for relapse was significantly lower for the PP6M cohort versus the ECA 
throughout the duration of the study [HR at 24 months: 0.18 (95% CI: 0.08-0.42), 
p < 0.001]. At 24 months, change in CGI-S score for the PP6M cohort was 0.76 
points lower than the ECA (p < 0.001). Results were similar in a sensitivity 
analysis using propensity score matching (PSM); IPTW resulted in larger sample 
sizes in balanced dataset than PSM.
CONCLUSION: Consistent findings across weighting and matching methods suggest 
PP6M efficacy in reducing and delaying relapses and long-term symptom control 
compared to PP1M/PP3M in usual-care settings. Additional confounds, such as 
greater illness severity and more frequent comorbidities and comedications in 
the ECA, were not fully controlled by the applied statistical methods. Future 
real-world studies directly comparing PP6M with PP3M/PP1M and adjusting for 
these confounders are warranted.

BACKGROUND: Benefiting from increased life expectancy and improved perioperative 
management, more elderly patients with pancreatic head cancer (PHC) underwent 
pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD). However, individualized predictive models for the 
safety and efficacy of PD is still lacking. this study aimed to developed three 
safety- and efficacy-related risk calculators for elderly (> = 65 years) PHC 
patients.
METHODS: This study was designed with two research cohorts, namely, the training 
cohort and the validation cohort, and comprises four general steps: (1) Risk 
factors were analyzed for the incidence of postoperative complications, 
cancer-specific survival (CSS), and overall survival (OS) in the training cohort 
(N = 271) using logistic and Cox-regression analysis. (2) Nomograms were then 
plotted based on the above results. (3) The accuracy of the developed nomogram 
models was then verified with the validation cohort (N = 134) data using 
consistency index (C-index) and calibration curves. (4) We then evaluated the 
efficacy of these nomograms using decision curve analysis (DCA) in both the 
training and validation cohorts, and ultimately constructed three online 
calculators based on these nomograms.
RESULTS: We identified ASA, diabetes, smoking, and lymph node invasion as 
predisposing risk factors for postoperative complications, and the predictive 
factors that affected both OS and CSS were ASA, diabetes, BMI, CA19-9 level, and 
tumor diameter. By integrating the above risk factors, we constructed three 
nomograms on postoperative complication, CSS, and OS. The C-index for 
complication, CSS, and OS were 0.824, 0.784, and 0.801 in the training cohort 
and 0.746, 0.718, and 0.708 in the validation cohort. Moreover, the validation 
curves and DCA demonstrated good calibration and robust compliance in both 
training and validation cohorts. We then developed three web calculators 
(https://caiming.shinyapps.io/CMCD/, https://caiming.shinyapps.io/CMCSS/, and 
https://caiming.shinyapps.io/CMOS/) to facilitate the use of the nomograms.
CONCLUSIONS: The calculators demonstrated promising performance as an tool for 
predicting the safety and efficacy of PD in elderly PHC patients.
