the obstructive disease can lead to achieve encouraging outcomes also in 
extremely advanced age; an aggressive evaluation of comorbidities and the 
cardiorespiratory risks reduction, when possible, could be useful in improve 
postoperative outcomes in terms of mortality.

INTRODUCTION: Up to 26.5% of new diagnosed prostate cancers (PCa) are locally 
advanced (LA). Although traditionally discouraged in this setting, radical 
prostatectomy (RP) lowers the risk of metastatic progression and cancer-specific 
death. We report a review of the available evidences and describe our surgical 
technique of extrafascial robot-assisted RP.
EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: The PubMed/Medline database was searched for "prostate 
cancer," "high-risk," "locally advanced," "prostatectomy." Duplicates and expert 
opinion papers were removed.
EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: RP is an option in selected patients with LA-PCa and >10 
years life expectancy. Five, 10 and 15 years after open RP, disease free 
survival rates were 85%, 73% and 67%. At the same time-points, cancer specific 
survival and overall survival were 95%, 90%, 79% and 90%, 76%, 53%, 
respectively. Postoperative potency was achieved by 25% of the patients while 
79% were continent. Robotic prostatectomy provides comparable cancer control 
outcomes, but it is associated with a lower transfusion rate and a shorter 
hospitalization time. The concept of "extrafascial prostatectomy" was introduced 
in 2000 by Villers: this surgical approach reduces the incidence of mid- and 
postero-lateral positive margins (28% vs. 51%, when compared to intrafascial; 
P=0.08), expecially in pT3 cancers, but markedly affects potency.
CONCLUSIONS: Robot-assisted RP is an option in patients with LA-PCa. Removing 
the prostate gland and the seminal vesicles still contained inside their 
aponeurotic covering, minimize the risk of positive surgical margins and 
clinical recurrence.

INTRODUCTION: The widespread use of antiretroviral therapies (ART) has increased 
life expectancy in HIV patients, predisposing them to chronic non-communicable 
diseases including Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD). We performed a systematic 
review and meta-analysis (PROSPERO registration number CRD42016036246) to 
determine the global and regional prevalence of CKD in HIV patients.
METHODS: We searched PubMed, Web of Science, EBSCO and AJOL for articles 
published between January 1982 and May 2016. CKD was defined as estimated 
glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <60ml/min using the MDRD, Cockcroft-Gault or 
CKD-EPI equations. Random effects model was used to combine prevalence estimates 
from across studies after variance stabilization via Freeman-Tukey 
transformation.
RESULT: Sixty-one eligible articles (n = 209,078 HIV patients) in 60 countries 
were selected. The overall CKD prevalence was 6.4% (95%CI 5.2-7.7%) with MDRD, 
4.8% (95%CI 2.9-7.1%) with CKD-EPI and 12.3% (95%CI 8.4-16.7%) with 
Cockcroft-Gault; p = 0.003 for difference across estimators. Sub-group analysis 
identified differences in prevalence by WHO region with Africa having the 
highest MDRD-based prevalence at 7.9% (95%CI 5.2-11.1%). Within Africa, the 
pooled MDRD-based prevalence was highest in West Africa [14.6% (95%CI 
9.9-20.0%)] and lowest in Southern Africa (3.2%, 95%CI 3.0-3.4%). The 
heterogeneity observed could be explained by WHO region, comorbid hypertension 
and diabetes mellitus, but not by gender, hepatitis B or C coinfection, CD4 
count or antiretroviral status.
CONCLUSION: CKD is common in HIV-infected people, particularly in Africa. HIV 
treatment programs need to intensify screening for CKD with added need to 
introduce global guidelines for CKD identification and treatment in HIV positive 
patients.

Psix saccharicola (Mani) (Hymenoptera: Platygastridae) is a solitary egg 
parasitoid of the pistachio green stink bug, Acrosternum arabicum (Wagner) 
(Hemiptera: Pentatomidae), which is one of the most important pests of pistachio 
in Iran. Augmentation of P. saccharicola field populations using mass-reared 
individuals may provide an alternative to conventional pesticide use for 
pistachio green stink bug control. Cold storage is an important component of 
mass-rearing protocols for optimum timing of host egg parasitization and 
potentially extended storage of P. saccharicola pupae prior to adult emergence. 
The impact of cold storage on A. arabicum eggs for various time intervals at 
4.0°C was investigated. Results indicated that host eggs stored at 4.0°C for up 
to 60 d could be exploited by P. sacchricola, whereas no offspring were produced 
when eggs were stored for 120 d. The emergence rates of the F1 and F2 
generations declined with increased host egg storage time. Both sex ratio and 
survival rate of the F2 generation decreased as the refrigeration time of host 
eggs increased. The impact of cold storage on P. saccharicola pupae was 
evaluated. Reared pupae of P. saccharicola were held for 1 wk at three 
temperatures and compared with a control (27 ± 1°C). Psix saccharicola pupae 
were tolerant to cold storage at 8 and 12°C. Cold storage adversely affected 
mean adult emergence at 4°C, which decreased following low temperature exposure. 
Furthermore, mean percentage survivorship was unaffected by storage at low 
temperatures in the F1 generation, but was reduced at 4°C. The sex ratio of the 
F1 generation became more male-biased when held at lower storage temperatures. 
The highest female proportion was observed at 12°C.

Direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) represent an opportunity to improve hepatitis C 
virus (HCV) care cascade. This combined with improved harm reduction 
interventions may lead to HCV elimination especially in people who inject drugs 
(PWID). We assessed the effectiveness/cost-effectiveness of improvements in harm 
reduction and chronic hepatitis C (CHC) care cascade in PWID in France. We used 
a dynamic model of HCV transmission and CHC natural history and evaluated the 
following: improved needle/syringe programmes-opioid substitution therapies, 
faster diagnosis/linkage to care, earlier treatment initiation, alone and in 
combination among active PWID (mean age = 36). Outcomes were as follows: life 
expectancy in discounted quality-adjusted life years (QALYs); direct lifetime 
discounted costs; incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER); number of 
infections/reinfections. Under the current practice, life expectancy was 15.846 
QALYs, for a mean lifetime cost of €20 762. Treatment initiation at F0 fibrosis 
stage alone was less effective and more costly than faster diagnosis/linkage to 
care combined with treatment initiation at F0, which increased life expectancy 
to 16.694 QALYs, decreased new infections by 37%, with a ICER = €5300/QALY. 
Combining these interventions with harm reduction improvements was the most 
effective scenario (life expectancy = 16.701 QALYs, 41% decrease in new 
infections) but was not cost-effective (ICER = €105 600/QALY); it became 
cost-effective with higher initial HCV incidence rates and lower harm reduction 
coverage than in our base-case scenario. This study illustrated the high 
effectiveness, and cost-effectiveness, of a faster diagnosis/linkage to care 
together with treatment from F0 with DAAs. This "Test and treat" strategy should 
play a central role both in improving the life expectancies of HCV-infected 
patients, and in reducing HCV transmission.

Autophagy-A key pathway for cardiac health and longevity.

California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA.

As average life expectancy continues to rise in the developed world, 
age-associated pathologies are increasing in prevalence. The hallmarks of 
cardiac ageing include cardiomyocyte loss, fibrosis and hypertrophy, all of 
which contribute to an increased incidence of cardiac disease. At the molecular 
level, cellular ageing is characterized by increased ROS production, 
mitochondrial dysfunction and the accumulation of damaged proteins and 
organelles. Cardiomyocytes and other senescent cell types rely upon autophagy, a 
lysosome-mediated degradation pathway, to remove potentially toxic protein 
aggregates and damaged organelles from the cellular milieu. However, increasing 
lines of evidence point to an age-associated decrease in cardiomyocyte 
autophagy, with predictably negative consequences for cardiac function and 
health. Conversely, stimulation of autophagy has been shown to improve cellular 
health and cardiac function and to increase lifespan in numerous model 
organisms. Clearly, autophagy represents a critical pathway for cellular 
vitality, as well as a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of 
age-related cardiac pathologies. In this review, we will discuss the mechanism 
of autophagy and its regulation in the cell, the role of autophagy in the ageing 
heart, and how the autophagy pathway might be targeted to improve cardiac 
health.

Shelf Life Extension of Tomato Paste Through Organoleptically Acceptable 
Concentration of Betel Leaf Essential Oil Under Accelerated Storage Environment.

Kharagpur, Kharagpur, 721302, West Bengal, India.

This study was attempted with two objectives: (1) to find an acceptable 
concentration of betel leaf essential oil (BLEO) based on sensory evaluation 
that can be employed in tomato paste; (2) to evaluate the effect of the 
acceptable concentration of BLEO in the paste during accelerated storage under 
89 ± 1.2% RH at 39 ± 1 °C. Linguistic data obtained from sensory evaluation of 
tomato paste treated with 4 different concentrations of BLEO were analyzed using 
fuzzy logic approach. The organoleptically acceptable concentration was 
determined to be 0.25 mg/g of BLEO in tomato paste. The effect of the selected 
concentration of BLEO on different physicochemical and microbial attributes of 
tomato paste during accelerated storage was studied. Untreated tomato paste was 
found to have 12% less total antioxidant capacity than treated paste at the end 
of storage. Based on a* /b* value in CIELAB color space, the BLEO treated paste 
efficiently extended the shelf life by 14 days with respect to untreated paste 
samples under accelerated storage conditions. BLEO comes with a tag contributing 
to green consumerism, and its application as food preservative is no less than a 
value addition to the product.
PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Essential oil is considered to have promising potential 
as an alternative food preservative, and its use is practically possible if they 
could overcome the sensory barrier, while retaining the preservative potency. 
The importance of identifying the sensory attributes for commercial success of 
essential oil treated food product was considered in this study. It contributes 
to the potency of organoleptically acceptable concentration of BLEO in shelf 
life extension of tomato paste under accelerated storage conditions. At 
industrial level, the estimated shelf life of treated tomato paste can be 
increased by incorporating more hurdles alongside BLEO.

BACKGROUND: To date, the majority of studies assessing accidental injuries among 
the elderly have focused on fall injuries, while studies of other mechanisms of 
injuries have been lacking. Therefore, the main objective of this study was to 
investigate all injury-related visits among older adults to an emergency 
department and risk factors for injuries.
METHODS: Data were collected on all registered visits of adults, ≥67 years old, 
living in the capital of Iceland, to the emergency department of Landspitali, 
the National University Hospital, in 2011 and 2012.
RESULTS: The yearly incidence rate for injuries was 106 per 1000 adults, 
≥67 years old. Of all injuries (n = 4,469), falls were the most common mechanism 
of injury (78 per 1000), followed by being struck or hit (12 per 1000) and being 
crushed, cut or pierced (8 per 1000). Other mechanisms of injury, such as acute 
overexertion, foreign body in natural orifice, injuries caused by thermal and 
chemical effect and other and unspecified mechanism were less common (8 per 
1000). Fractures were the most common consequences of injuries (36 per 1000). 
The most frequent place of injury was in or around homes (77 per 1000), with men 
being more likely than women to be injured outside of the home (60 per 1000 vs. 
36 per 1000).
CONCLUSION: Results indicate that falls are the main cause of accidental 
injuries, followed by being struck and hit injuries but other causes contributed 
to the rest. Falls constitute a major public health problem and fall-related 
injuries can have a substantial impact on the lives of older adults. As life 
expectancy continues to increase, fall risk is expected to increase. Since falls 
constitute a major impact on the lives of older adults and can lead to not only 
declines in physical activity and functional status, but to considerable health 
care costs, the health care system needs to intervene.

Amyloid-like structure formation by various metabolites represents a significant 
extension of the amyloidogenic building block family. Similar to protein 
amyloids, metabolite amyloids induce apoptotic toxicity, a process that was 
linked to membrane association. Here, we demonstrate that metabolite amyloids 
interact with model membranes and study the mechanism by molecular dynamics.

BACKGROUND: Cocaine use has a high prevalence in the United States and can be 
associated with significant cardiovascular disease, even in asymptomatic users. 
β-Adrenergic receptor hyperactivation is the underlying pathophysiologic pathway 
of cocaine cardiotoxicity. β-Blocker therapy is controversial in patients with 
active cocaine use.
HYPOTHESIS: β-Blocker therapy is associated with clinical improvement in 
patients with heart failure despite active cocaine use.
METHODS: In a single-center, retrospective chart analysis, patients with newly 
diagnosed heart failure and active cocaine use who had been started on β-blocker 
therapy were reviewed. The New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class 
and the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) were recorded at baseline and 
after 12 monthsnthsnths of β-blocker use. Patients were excluded if they had 
been on prior β-blocker therapy, had other reasons for volume overload, had 
chronic kidney disease stages G4 or G5, or had a life expectancy <12 months.
RESULTS: Thirty-eight patients were identified; most were African American 
males. A statistically significant improvement was found in both NYHA functional 
class (P < 0.0001) and LVEF (P < 0.0001) after 12 months of β-blocker therapy. 
No major adverse cardiovascular events occurred in this population.
CONCLUSIONS: β-Blocker use in cocaine users with heart failure with a reduced 
ejection fraction is associated with a lower NYHA functional class and a higher 
LVEF at 12-month follow-up. No major adverse cardiovascular events were 
observed.

The introduction of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) drastically 
improved performance status, immune function, and life expectancy of 
HIV-infected individuals. In addition, incidence of opportunistic infections and 
of AIDS-defining malignancies declined. Nevertheless, aggressive non-Hodgkin's 
lymphoma still remains the leading cause of AIDS-related deaths. The 
availability of cART, however, significantly improved the therapeutic options 
for HIV-positive patients with lymphomas. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, 
Burkitt's lymphoma, or Hodgkin lymphoma has increasingly become curable 
diseases. In light of these favorable developments in the treatment of HIV and 
HIV-associated lymphomas, reduction in treatment-associated toxicities and 
further improvement of outcome of patients with advanced immune suppression are 
major requirements for future clinical trials. This review summarizes the 
current treatment landscape and gives an overview on future needs in 
HIV-positive patients with lymphoma.

Cancer is a disease of multicellularity; it originates when cells become 
dysregulated due to mutations and grow out of control, invading other tissues 
and provoking discomfort, disability, and eventually death. Human life 
expectancy has greatly increased in the last two centuries, and consequently so 
has the incidence of cancer. However, how cancer patterns in humans compare to 
those of other species remains largely unknown. In this review, we search for 
clues about cancer and its evolutionary underpinnings across the tree of life. 
We discuss data from a wide range of species, drawing comparisons with humans 
when adequate, and interpret our findings from an evolutionary perspective. We 
conclude that certain cancers are uniquely common in humans, such as lung, 
prostate, and testicular cancer; while others are common across many species. 
Lymphomas appear in almost every animal analysed, including in young animals, 
which may be related to pathogens imposing selection on the immune system. 
Cancers unique to humans may be due to our modern environment or may be 
evolutionary accidents: random events in the evolution of our species. Finally, 
we find that cancer-resistant animals such as whales and mole-rats have evolved 
cellular mechanisms that help them avoid neoplasia, and we argue that there are 
multiple natural routes to cancer resistance.

Congenital heart diseases (CHDs) and cardiovascular abnormalities are one of the 
pillars of clinical diagnosis of 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS) and still 
represent the main cause of mortality in the affected children. In the past 30 
years, much progress has been made in describing the anatomical patterns of CHD, 
in improving their diagnosis, medical treatment, and surgical procedures for 
these conditions, as well as in understanding the underlying genetic and 
developmental mechanisms. However, further studies are still needed to better 
determine the true prevalence of CHDs in 22q11.2DS, including data from prenatal 
studies and on the adult population, to further clarify the genetic mechanisms 
behind the high variability of phenotypic expression of 22q11.2DS, and to fully 
understand the mechanism responsible for the increased postoperative morbidity 
and for the premature death of these patients. Moreover, the increased life 
expectancy of persons with 22q11.2DS allowed the expansion of the adult 
population that poses new challenges for clinicians such as acquired 
cardiovascular problems and complexity related to multisystemic comorbidity. In 
this review, we provide a comprehensive review of the existing literature about 
22q11.2DS in order to summarize the knowledge gained in the past years of 
clinical experience and research, as well as to identify the remaining gaps in 
comprehension of this syndrome and the possible future research directions.

Nipple-Sparing Mastectomy and Immediate Breast Reconstruction With a Deep 
Inferior Epigastric Perforator Flap: A Study of Patient Satisfaction.

Levy J, Bosc R, Warren N, Rebecca S, Dao TH, Hersant B, Meningaud JP.

INTRODUCTION: The morphological result of nipple-areola complex (NAC) 
reconstruction may be disappointing for patients who undergo skin-sparing 
mastectomies and immediate breast reconstruction, followed by secondary 
reconstruction of the nipple-areola complex.The aim of this study was to analyze 
patient satisfaction after nipple-sparing mastectomy and immediate breast 
reconstruction with a deep inferior epigastric perforator flap.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our retrospective study involved all patients who 
underwent an immediate breast reconstruction after unilateral mastectomy with 
conservation of the NAC. The following three kinds of surgical approach were 
used: mastectomy with periareolar incision, mastectomy with hemiperiareolar 
incision and lateral extension, and mastectomy with inverted-T mammoplasty 
incision. Our study was based on a survey using a standardized questionnaire and 
a Likert scale to report patient satisfaction on the basis of criteria defined 
by the investigators.
RESULTS: We evaluated 17 patients. All reconstruction patients were satisfied or 
very satisfied with the overall aesthetic appearance, projection, and volume as 
well as the appearance of scarring on the reconstructed breast. None of our 
patients reported dissatisfaction in response to the criteria under evaluation. 
A periareolar incision was used most often to perform the mastectomy (10 
patients). Partial NAC necrosis was observed in five patients, without 
negatively influencing their perception of the morphological outcome of their 
reconstruction.
CONCLUSIONS: Immediate breast reconstruction using a deep inferior epigastric 
perforator free flap after nipple-sparing mastectomies met with a high rate of 
general satisfaction among patients and resulted in a low rate of nipple-areola 
complex necrosis.

BACKGROUND: The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) project systematically assesses 
mortality, healthy life expectancy, and disability across 195 countries and 
territories, using the disability-adjusted life year (DALY). Disability weights 
in the DALY are based upon surveys that ask users to rate health states based on 
lay descriptions. We conducted an experimental study to examine whether the 
inclusion or removal of psychological, social, or familial implications from a 
health state description might affect individual judgments about disease 
severity, and thus relative disability weights.
METHODS: We designed a survey consisting of 36 paired descriptions in which 
information about plausible psychological, social, or familial implications of a 
health condition was either present or absent. Using a Web-based platform, we 
recruited 1,592 participants, who were assigned to one of two experimental 
groups, each of which were asked to assign a value to the health state 
description from 0 to 100 using a slider, with 0 as the "worst possible health" 
and 100 as the "best possible health." We tested five hypotheses: (1) the 
inclusion of psychological, social, or familial consequences in health state 
descriptions will reduce the average rating of a health state; (2) the effect 
will be stronger for diseases with lower disability weights (i.e., less severe 
diseases); (3) the effect will vary across the type of additional information 
added to the health state description; (4) the impact of adding information on 
familial consequences will be stronger for female than male; (5) the effect of 
additional consequences on ratings of health state descriptions will not differ 
by levels of completed education and age.
RESULTS: On average, adding social, psychological, or familial consequences to 
the health state description lowered individual ratings of that description by 
0.78 points. The impact of adding information had a stronger impact on ratings 
of the least severe conditions, reducing average ratings in this category by 
1.67 points. Addition of information about child-rearing had the strongest 
impact, reducing average ratings by 2.09 points. We found little evidence that 
the effect of adding information on ratings of health descriptions varied by 
gender, education, or age.
CONCLUSIONS: Including information about health states not directly related to 
major functional consequences or symptoms, particularly with respect to 
child-rearing and specifically for descriptions of less severe conditions, can 
lead to lower ratings of health. However, this impact was not consistent across 
all conditions or types of information, and was most pronounced for inclusion of 
information about child-rearing, and among the least severe conditions.

People with schizophrenia have a shortened life expectancy, with cardiovascular 
disease (CVD) being the primary contributor to this excessive mortality. A total 
of 466 inpatients with schizophrenia and 507 healthy community controls in the 
Chinese mainland were recruited in this study. Sociodemographic information, 
medical history, and smoking history were recorded. In addition, total 
cholesterol (TC), fasting blood glucose (FBG), triglycerides (TG), and 
high-destiny lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) were analyzed. The 10-year CVD risk 
was significantly higher in patients with schizophrenia compared with healthy 
controls. Male schizophrenia patients had significantly higher Framingham risk 
scores (FRS) than the females. Patients with schizophrenia carried significantly 
greater risk factors of CVD; body-mass index (BMI), TG and smoking prevalence 
were significantly higher than in the health community controls, while FBG and 
HDL-C were on the contrary. Smoking was significantly associated with FRS among 
schizophrenia inpatients. Collectively, these results suggest that Han Chinese 
mainland patients with schizophrenia harbor a high 10-year CVD risk when 
compared with healthy controls, especially in males. CVD in schizophrenia 
patients requires greater attention by clinicians and researchers.

BACKGROUND: Due to the ageing population, the number of visually impaired people 
in the Netherlands will increase. To ensure the future availability of services 
in rehabilitative eye care, we aim to assess the cost-effectiveness of 
information and communication technology (ICT) training among visually impaired 
adults from a societal perspective, using primary data from two large 
rehabilitative eye care providers in the Netherlands.
METHODS: Participants were asked to fill in a questionnaire, which used six 
different instruments at three different time points: pre training, post 
training and three months post training. We investigated whether the 
participants' quality of life and well-being improved after the training and 
whether this improvement persisted three months post training. Economic 
evaluation was conducted by comparing costs and outcomes before and after 
training. Quality of life and well-being were derived from the EQ-5D and 
ICECAP-O, respectively. Costs for productivity losses and medical consumption 
were obtained from the questionnaires. Information regarding the costs of 
training sessions was provided by the providers.
RESULTS: Thirty-eight participants filled in all three questionnaires. The mean 
age at baseline was 63 years (SD = 16). The effect of ICT training on ICT skills 
and participants' well-being was positive and persisted three months after the 
last training session. Assuming these effects remain constant for 10 years, this 
would result in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of € 11,000 per 
quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) and € 8000 per year of well-being gained, when 
only the costs of ICT training are considered. When the total costs of medical 
consumption are included, the ICER increases to € 17,000 per QALY gained and € 
12,000 per year of well-being gained. Furthermore, when the willingness-to-pay 
threshold is € 20,000 per year of well-being, the probability that ICT training 
will be cost-effective is 75% (91% when including only the costs of ICT 
training).
CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that ICT training among the visually impaired is 
cost-effective when the effects of ICT training on well-being persist for 
several years. However, further research involving a larger sample and 
incorporating long-term effects should be conducted.

Conflict of interest statement: ETHICS APPROVAL AND CONSENT TO PARTICIPATE: The 
participants in this study were receiving ‘care as usual’ (ICT training) and 
only filling in a questionnaire concerning the ICT training. Consequently, the 
participants were not subjects to a procedure and were not required to follow 
rules of behavior. As such, this study would not fall under the Dutch Medical 
Research Involving Human Subjects Act (WMO). At the time when the study was 
designed (in 2014) consulting with the Medical Ethical Committee was not common 
in the Netherlands, for studies only concerning filling in questionnaires 
related to usual care (not involving a new intervention). If this study had 
taken place in 2018, it would have received a waiver for the study protocol. The 
Dutch Medical Ethical Committee is however not allowed to give a waiver in 2018 
for a study that started in 2014. All respondents were informed about the aims 
of the study and its anonymous and voluntary nature before giving their consent 
to participate. Informed consent was obtained from all participants. COMPETING

OBJECTIVE: The life expectancy of patients with congenital heart disease (CHD) 
has significantly improved with advances in their paediatric medical care. 
Mortality patterns are changing as a result. Our study aims to describe survival 
and causes of death in a contemporary cohort of adult patients with CHD.
METHODS: We reviewed 3068 patients in our adult CHD database (age ≥16 years, 
seen at least once in our centre between 2000 and 2015), and documented the 
number and causes of death, via Australia's National Death Index. Survival and 
mortality patterns were analysed by complexity of CHD and by underlying 
congenital diagnosis.
RESULTS: Our cohort comprised 3068 adult patients (53% male). The distribution 
of patients (per the Bethesda classification) was 47% simple, 34% moderate and 
18% complex (1% not classifiable). Over a median follow-up of 6.2 years (IQR 
3.5-10.4), 341 patients (11%) died with an incidence of 0.4 deaths/100 patient 
years (py). Survival was significantly worse with increasing complexity of CHD 
(p<0.001); mortality rate in the simple group was 0.3 deaths/100 py with a 
median age of death 70 years, and in the complex group was 1.0 death/100 py with 
a median age of death 34 years. Overall, non-cardiac causes of death outnumbered 
cardiac causes, at 54% and 46%, respectively. The leading single cause of death 
was heart failure (17%), followed by malignancy (13%). Simple adult CHD patients 
mostly died due to non-cardiac causes such as malignancy. Perioperative 
mortality only accounted for 5% of deaths.
CONCLUSIONS: Premature death is common in adults with CHD. Although heart 
failure remains the most common cause of death, in the contemporary era in a 
specialist CHD centre, non-cardiac related deaths outnumber cardiac deaths, 
particularly in those with simple CHD lesions.

Promising multi-dose HIV vaccine regimens are being tested in trials in South 
Africa. We estimated the potential epidemiological and economic impact of HIV 
vaccine campaigns compared to continuous vaccination, assuming that vaccine 
efficacy is transient and dependent on immune response. We used a dynamic 
economic mathematical model of HIV transmission calibrated to 2012 
epidemiological data to simulate vaccination with anticipated antiretroviral 
treatment scale-up in South Africa. We estimate that biennial vaccination with a 
70% efficacious vaccine reaching 20% of the sexually active population could 
prevent 480,000-650,000 HIV infections (13.8-15.3% of all infections) over 10 
years. Assuming a launch price of $15 per dose, vaccination was found to be 
cost-effective, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $13,746 per 
quality-adjusted life-year as compared to no vaccination. Increasing vaccination 
coverage to 50% will prevent more infections but is less likely to achieve 
cost-effectiveness. Campaign vaccination is consistently more effective and 
costs less than continuous vaccination across scenarios. Results suggest that a 
partially effective HIV vaccine will have substantial impact on the HIV epidemic 
in South Africa and offer good value if priced less than $105 for a five-dose 
series. Vaccination campaigns every two years may offer greater value for money 
than continuous vaccination reaching the same coverage level.

This study aimed to evaluate the antioxidant activity of Argel leaf water 
extract (ALWE) and its effect at different concentrations (0, 5, 10, and 
20 mg/100 mL) on the antioxidant, antimicrobial, physicochemical, and sensory 
attributes of chicken meatballs during cold storage. ALWE contained substantial 
quantities of total phenolic content (TPC), anthocyanin, and exhibited high DPPH 
scavenging activity. ALWE incorporation in chicken meatballs had a varying 
effect on the chemical composition and sensory attributes of the product. 
However, ALWE incorporation at high concentration decreased the protein content 
of cooked meatballs and reduced fat content in both raw and cooked balls. 
Increased ALWE concentration in chicken meatballs lowered the pH, microbial 
load, and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances. Furthermore, ALWE raised the 
TPC and DPPH scavenging activity of chicken meatballs. Throughout the storage 
period, chicken meatballs formulated with ALWE showed better quality attributes 
than non-formulated chicken meatballs. In conclusion, ALWE can be employed as a 
functional ingredient for improved health benefits and shelf-life extension of 
chicken meatballs.

Natural foods are used in many folks and household treatments and have immense 
potential to treat a serious complication and health benefits, in addition to 
the basic nutritional values. These food products improve health, delay the 
aging process, increase life expectancy, and possibly prevent chronic diseases. 
Purple head Brassica oleracea L. var. italica Plenck is one of such foods and in 
current studies was explored for chemical compounds at different development 
stages by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Antioxidant potential was 
explored employing different assays like molybdate ion reduction, DPPH, 
superoxide anion radical scavenging and plasmid nicking assay. Inspired by 
antioxidant activity results, we further explored these extracts for 
antiproliferative potential by morphological changes, cell cycle analysis, 
measurement of intracellular peroxides and mitochondrial membrane potential 
changes. Current study provides the scientific basis for the use of broccoli as 
easily affordable potent functional food.

Novel Biocontrol Methods for Listeria monocytogenes Biofilms in Food Production 
Facilities.

High mortality and hospitalization rates have seen Listeria monocytogenes as a 
foodborne pathogen of public health importance for many years and of particular 
concern for high-risk population groups. Food manufactures face an ongoing 
challenge in preventing the entry of L. monocytogenes into food production 
environments (FPEs) due to its ubiquitous nature. In addition to this, the 
capacity of L. monocytogenes strains to colonize FPEs can lead to repeated 
identification of L. monocytogenes in FPE surveillance. The contamination of 
food products requiring product recall presents large economic burden to 
industry and is further exacerbated by damage to the brand. Poor equipment 
design, facility layout, and worn or damaged equipment can result in Listeria 
hotspots and biofilms where traditional cleaning and disinfecting procedures may 
be inadequate. Novel biocontrol methods may offer FPEs effective means to help 
improve control of L. monocytogenes and decrease cross contamination of food. 
Bacteriophages have been used as a medical treatment for many years for their 
ability to infect and lyse specific bacteria. Endolysins, the hydrolytic enzymes 
of bacteriophages responsible for breaking the cell wall of Gram-positive 
bacteria, are being explored as a biocontrol method for food preservation and in 
nanotechnology and medical applications. Antibacterial proteins known as 
bacteriocins have been used as alternatives to antibiotics for biopreservation 
and food product shelf life extension. Essential oils are natural antimicrobials 
formed by plants and have been used as food additives and preservatives for many 
years and more recently as a method to prevent food spoilage by microorganisms. 
Competitive exclusion occurs naturally among bacteria in the environment. 
However, intentionally selecting and applying bacteria to effect competitive 
exclusion of food borne pathogens has potential as a biocontrol application. 
This review discusses these novel biocontrol methods and their use in food 
safety and prevention of spoilage, and examines their potential to control L. 
monocytogenes within biofilms in food production facilities.
