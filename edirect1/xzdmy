concluding that people 65 years old and over with lower social capital were 
presented with a poor HRQoL. Study synthesis highlights the impact of social 
capital suggesting that nurses caring for older people must focus on their 
engagement in terms of social diversity and trust in the community.

Although exposure to air pollution increases the risk of premature mortality and 
years of life lost (YLL), the effects of daily air quality improvement to the 
life expectancy of respiratory diseases remained unclear. We applied a 
generalized additive model (GAM) to assess the associations between daily PM2.5 
exposure and YLL from respiratory diseases in 96 Chinese cities during 
2013-2016. We further estimated the avoidable YLL, potential gains in life 
expectancy, and the attributable fraction by assuming daily PM2.5 concentration 
decrease to the air quality standards of China and World Health Organization. 
Regional and national results were generated by random-effects meta-analysis. A 
total of 861,494 total respiratory diseases and 586,962 chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease (COPD) caused death from 96 Chinese cities were recorded 
during study period. Each 10 μg/m3 increase of PM2.5 in 3-day moving average 
(lag02) was associated with 0.16 (95% CI: 0.08, 0.24) years increment in life 
expectancy from total respiratory diseases. The highest effect was observed in 
Southwest region with 0.42 (95% CI: 0.22, 0.62) years increase in life 
expectancy. By attaining the WHO's Air Quality Guidelines, we estimated that an 
average of 782.09 (95% CI: 438.29, 1125.89) YLLs caused by total respiratory 
death in each city could be avoided, which corresponded to 1.15% (95% CI: 0.67%, 
1.64%) of the overall YLLs, and 0.12 (95% CI: 0.07, 0.17) years increment in 
life expectancy. The results of COPD were generally consistent with total 
respiratory diseases. Our findings indicate that reduction in daily PM2.5 
concentrations might lead to longer life expectancy from respiratory death.

To evaluate the achievements of China's immunization program between 1950 and 
2018, we chose 11 vaccine-preventable diseases (VPDs) as representative 
notifiable diseases and used annual surveillance data obtained between 1950 and 
2018 to derive disease incidence and mortality trends. Quasi-Poisson and 
polynomial regression models were used to estimate the impacts of specific 
vaccine programs, and life-table methods were used to calculate the loss of life 
expectancy, years of life lost, and loss of working years. The total 
notification number for the 11 VPDs was 211,866,000 from 1950 to 2018. The 
greatest number occurred in 1959, with a total incidence of 1,723 per million 
persons. From 1978 to 2018, a substantial decline was observed in the incidence 
of major infectious diseases. The incidence of pertussis fell 98% from 126.35 to 
1.58 per million, and the incidences of measles, meningococcal meningitis, and 
Japanese encephalitis fell 99%, 99%, and 98%, respectively. The regression 
models showed that most of the 11 diseases exhibited dramatic declines in 
morbidity after their integration into the Expanded Program on Immunization 
(EPI), while varicella and paratyphoid fever, which were not integrated into the 
EPI, showed increased morbidity. From 1978 to 2018, the total life expectancy 
for the 11 VPDs increased by 0.79 years, and similar results were obtained for 
different age groups. China has had great success in controlling VPDs in recent 
decades, and improving vaccination coverage is a key aspect of controlling VPDs 
in China.

BACKGROUND: HIV is now considered a chronic condition, and people living with 
HIV, when treated, have a similar life expectancy as compared to the general 
population. Consequently, improving and ensuring a good health-related quality 
of life (HrQoL) among people living with HIV (people living with HIV) is 
increasingly important and has risen on the global agenda in recent years. A 
'fourth 90' as 90% of people with viral load suppression have a good HrQoL 
should therefore be adopted alongside the other 90-90-90 targets. This study 
aims to report the progress on HrQoL as the 'fourth 90' and compare against the 
general population in the Netherlands and England.
METHODS: In the Netherlands, individuals attending the HIV outpatient clinic of 
a tertiary hospital were asked to complete the EQ-5D-5L from June 2016 until 
December 2018. In England, individuals attending one of 73 HIV outpatient 
clinics were randomly sampled to complete the Positive Voices survey, which 
included the EQ-5D-5L, from January to September 2017. HrQoL scores were 
combined with demographic data and compared to general population data.
FINDINGS: The EQ-5D-5L was filled-out by 895 people living with HIV in the NL 
and 4,137 in England. HrQoLutility was 0·85 among Dutch and 0·83 among English 
people living with HIV. This equated to 98% and 94% of the general population 
HrQoLutility in the Netherlands and England, respectively. Of the EQ-5D domains, 
anxiety/depression was mostly affected, with one-third in Dutch (35%) and almost 
half (47%) of English people living with HIV reporting symptoms. This was higher 
compared to their respective general populations (21% NL and 31% England).
INTERPRETATION: Overall, HrQoLutility for people living with HIV was high in 
both countries and highly comparable to the general populations Nevertheless, 
there should be an increased focus on anxiety and depression in the people 
living with HIV population The EQ-5D-5L proved an easy HrQoL measurement tool 
and identified areas for improvement by social and behavioural interventions.
FUNDING: The study received funding (unrestricted grants) from: Gilead sciences, 
ViiV Healthcare, MSD, and Jansen pharmaceuticals.

We aimed to describe the global prevalence and temporal trends of hearing loss. 
We collected detailed information of hearing loss from the Global Burden of 
Disease study between 1990 and 2019. Average annual percentage changes (AAPCs) 
in hearing loss age-standardized prevalence rate (ASPR), by sex, region, and 
category, were calculated to quantify the temporal prevalence trends. Globally, 
the prevalent cases of hearing loss increased from 7514.97×105 in 1990 to 
14566.62×105 in 2019, and the ASPR increased from 173.33×102 per 100,000 in 1990 
to 177.56×102 per 100,000 in 2019. The years lived with disability (YLDs) 
increased from 220080.97×102 in 1990 to 402353.05×102 in 2019. The AAPC was 
83.27 (95% CI 70.66, 95.88) ×10-3 in prevalence and -72.87 (95% CI -92.18, 
-53.56) ×10-3 in YLDs. Significant correlations of AAPCs with ASPR (r=-0.60, 
p<0.001), and age-standardized YLD rate (r=-0.43, p=0.0012 for YLD<455, r=0.32, 
p<0.001 for YLD≥455) were detected. The YLDs of hearing loss owing to 
occupational noise (HLOON) increased from 39334.39 (95% UI 26881.04, 55999.67) 
×102 in 1990 to 70014.49 (98% UI 47605.62, 100593.43) ×102 in 2019, and the 
increasing AAPC was observed for females and aged between 15 and 49 years old in 
global and most regions. The age effect was under zero in 7 age groups, the 
period effect of hearing loss prevalence was increasing and the birth cohort 
effect was decreasing with the time advance. The number of cases and ASPR of 
hearing loss in the world is still growing. Efforts to control hearing loss, 
especially HLOON, are imminent.

PURPOSE: The purpose of the report is to present a rare case of clinical 
management of a 26-year-old patient with fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva 
(FOP), and discuss treatment options and possible outcomes.
SUMMARY: FOP is a rare autosomal dominant genetic disorder of the connective 
tissue that affects one in two million people. It is characterized by multiple 
areas of progressive heterotopic endochondral ossifications. The symptoms 
typically begin with painful soft tissue swellings in the patient's first 
decade, which frequently occur after minor trauma, but may also happen 
spontaneously. The soft tissue swellings eventually form hard bony masses that 
cause joint limitations, growth defects, skeletal deformities, and chronic pain. 
The results are severely limiting to the activities of daily living and overall 
quality of life with the average life expectancy being 40 years of age. Medical 
and dental treatment, including the use of general anesthesia, may be 
complicated by increased risk of ossification of the soft tissues in the airway 
and lungs. The following case report focuses on a 26-year-old Caucasian female, 
with FOP. The patient presented to the Erie County Medical Center Dental clinic 
in Spring 2019 with generalized dental pain. She reported a history of multiple 
dental infections over many years which were periodically treated with 
antibiotics. A thorough intraoral exam and radiographs were not able to be 
completed upon initial presentation due to severe trismus and mobility 
limitations. The patient was a wheelchair user, verbal, and maintained a 
completely liquid diet by mouth. The patient also had a medical history 
significant for dysphagia and aspiration. After a substantial pre-operative 
optimization process, the patient was brought to the operating room for full 
mouth dental extractions. At the 2-week follow-up from surgery the patient 
showed excellent healing.
CONCLUSION: While there are greater potential risks with placing a patient with 
FOP patient under general anesthesia, proper management of dental disease can 
relieve the patient from recurrent infections and discomfort.

Dysphagia and progressive swallowing problems due to motoneuron death is one of 
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) symptoms. Malnutrition and body weight loss 
result in immunological disturbances, fatigability and increase risk of 
secondary complications in ALS patients, percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy 
tube (PEG) placement representing a well-recognized method for malnutrition 
correction and potentially increasing life expectancy. However, despite 
nutritional correction, occasional rapid neurological deterioration may develop 
after PEG placement. We have hypothesized that this decline can be a result of 
exteroceptive stress during PEG placement and promote neurodegeneration in ALS 
patients. Intravenous sedation may decrease stress during invasive procedures 
and it is safe during PEG placement in ALS patients. The aim of the study was 
comparing different PEG placement protocols of anesthesia (local anesthesia or 
local anesthesia plus intravenous sedation) in ALS from perspectives of stress 
load and neurological deterioration profile. During 1.5 years 94 ALS patients 
were admitted; gastrostomy was performed in 79 patients. After screening 
according to inclusion and exclusion criteria, 30 patients were included in the 
prospective consecutive study. All patients were divided in two groups, with 
local anesthesia and with combination of local anesthesia and intravenous 
sedation. Routine biochemical indices, neurodegeneration and stress markers were 
measured. The age of ALS patients was 61 ± 10 years; 20 patients were included 
at stage 4A and 10 at stage 4B (King's College staging). PEG was placed at 
average14 months after the diagnosis and 2.2 years after first symptoms. Mean 
ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised was 27.8, mean forced vital capacity of lung 
46.3% (19-91%). After one year of observation only 8 patients survived. Mean 
life duration after PEG was 5 months (5 days-20 months). Comparison of two PEG 
placement protocols did not reveal differences in survival time, stress load and 
inflammation level. Higher saliva cortisol levels, serum cortisol, glucose, 
C-reactive protein and interleukin-6 were detected after PEG placement, 
confirming considerable stress response. PEG is a stressful factor for ALS 
patients, PEG placement representing a natural model of exteroceptive stress. 
Stress response was detected as increased cortisol, C-reactive protein, 
interleukin-6, and glucose levels. Intravenous sedation did not increase the 
risk of PEG placement procedure, however, sedation protocol did not affect 
stress load.

BACKGROUND: To date, no attempt has been made to collate literature on the 
relationship between the social environmental impact of COVID-19 and erectile 
dysfunction. The aim of this explorative review was to assess and compare the 
prevalence of erectile dysfunction (ED) in male healthcare workers and males 
during the COVID-19 pandemic.
METHODS: A systematic review of major databases from inception to February 2021 
was conducted. Prevalence data were extracted, and a random-effects 
meta-analysis was undertaken.
OUTCOMES: The pooled prevalence of ED amongst healthcare workers working in 
COVID-19 specific environments, and non-healthcare during the COVID-19 pandemic.
RESULTS: Of 52 initial studies, six were included for the final analysis. The 
pooled prevalence of ED in healthcare workers working in a COVID-19 environment 
was 63.6% (95% CI 20.3-92.3%), and in non-healthcare workers during the COVID-19 
pandemic was 31.9% (95% CI 19.5-47.6%).
CONCLUSION: The prevalence of ED in healthcare workers working in COVID-19 
environments was higher than representative samples and is of concern. Sexual 
health (and by extension, overall health), should be a priority when considering 
ways to care for this population. Considering the social environmental impact of 
COVID-19 on sexual health and in particular on ED, it is important to provide 
adequate psychological support systems and to promote quality of life with 
particular attention to sexual health.

BACKGROUND: Endoprosthetic reconstruction after oncologic resection of bone 
tumors requires stable fixation between the prosthesis and residual host bone. 
Compressive osseointegration has been developed as an alternative to traditional 
stemmed implants to address the challenges and complications of achieving this 
fixation. Sufficient time has now passed from the advent of compressive implants 
to allow for an assessment of the intermediate-term and long-term results of 
this form of fixation.
QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: At a minimum follow-up of 10 years after implantation of a 
compressive osseointegration device for oncologic reconstruction: (1) What is 
the risk of periprosthetic fracture, aseptic loosening, or implant breakage 
resulting in revision surgery for endoprosthesis removal? (2) What is the 
long-term cortical response at the host-endoprosthesis interface as visualized 
on plain radiographs?
METHODS: A single-center, retrospective study was performed between 2002 and 
2010, in which 110 patients with primary bone sarcoma of the proximal or distal 
femur were considered for oncologic resection and reconstruction. Patients were 
considered for a compressive osseointegration endoprosthesis if they were 50 
years of age or younger, had not previously received femoral radiation, had no 
metabolic disease impairing bone healing, were not diagnosed with metastatic 
disease, and had life expectancy greater than six months. Of the 110 patients, 
25 were treated with a compressive osseointegration implant of the proximal or 
distal femur, and 85 patients were treated with conventional stemmed implants or 
amputation because of older age, advanced disease, metabolic comorbidities, 
inability to tolerate a nonweightbearing postoperative period, or in the case of 
rotationplasty, patient preference. All patients who received this device during 
the period of study were considered eligible for inclusion in this review. The 
median (range) age was 18 years (7 to 50), and 13 of 25 patients were men. Five 
patients died of disease before the minimum follow-up duration of 10 years; two 
underwent amputation due to local recurrence and three died with the implant in 
situ, leaving 20 patients for complete analysis. Median follow-up was 144 
months, and all 20 surviving patients had a minimum follow-up of 10 years (121 
to 230 months). The primary endpoint was reoperation and implant removal for 
periprosthetic fracture, aseptic loosening, or mechanical breakage of any 
component of the compressive device in the endoprosthesis. In final analysis, 
death was considered a competing event to revision surgery, and cumulative 
incidence was reported after competing-event analysis. A secondary aim was 
radiographic evaluation of the host-implant interface to assess the long-term 
cortical response to compressive osseointegration.
RESULTS: Spindle fracture or loosening was noted in three patients, and the 
remaining 17 patients maintained the compression device until the final 
follow-up. The risk of reoperation for aseptic loosening, periprosthetic 
fracture, or mechanical breakage of the implant using a competing risks 
estimator was 12% at 10 years (95% CI 0% to 26%). These complications occurred 
within 29 months of the index surgery; no patients had implant loosening or 
mechanical breakdown after this initial period. On radiographic assessment, 14 
patients demonstrated cortical hypertrophy of the bone-implant interface, six 
patients had maintenance of the native cortical contour, and no patients had 
cortical atrophy or narrowing at the implant interface.Conclusion Long-term 
follow-up in patients with compressive osseointegrative endoprosthetic devices 
demonstrated no late revisions because of periprosthetic fracture, aseptic 
loosening, or implant breakage in this cohort with a minimum 10-year follow-up. 
There was no evidence of late-onset cortical atrophy or stress shielding at the 
host-implant interface. This study supports the long-term stability of the 
interface between host bone and the endoprosthesis in compressive 
osseointegration devices.
LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV, therapeutic study.

INTRODUCTION: Massive haemoptysis refers to coughing and losing a huge amount of 
blood in a 24-hour period. It's a life-threatening condition with high mortality 
rate.
CASE PRESENTATION: We report a rare case of massive haemoptysis in a 60-year-old 
female patient who had aortic coarctation repair 30 years ago. Her Computed 
tomography (CT) angiography showed huge aneurysmal dilatation and dissection of 
the descending thoracic aorta at the site of the repair. Thoracic endovascular 
aortic repair (TEVAR) was done, but the patient had recurrent massive 
haemoptysis due to extension of the aneurysm to the aortic arch. The patient 
then underwent one stage surgical right to left carotid artery shunt followed by 
TEVAR to the aortic arch covering the left common carotid artery. The procedure 
was successful, and haemoptysis was controlled without any complications.
DISCUSSION: In this case the high index of suspicion for thoracic aortic 
aneurysm in patients presenting with haemoptysis and prior history of 
coarctation repair were demonstrated.
CONCLUSION: massive haemoptysis in patients who had aortic coarctation repair is 
an alarming sign, and surgical intervention is required. TEVAR has become one of 
the best approaches for managing aortic aneurysm and has replaced open repair.

Isometric Hip Strength and Patient-Reported Outcomes of Individuals With and 
Without Chronic Ankle Instability.

Bain KA, Clawson PA, Slone SA, Gribble PA, Hoch JM, Hoch MC, Kosik KB.

CONTEXT: Strength deficits and decreased scores on generic, dimension-specific, 
and region-specific health-related quality of life (HRQL) PRO measures are 
commonly documented among individuals with chronic ankle instability (CAI). 
However, it is unknown if there is a relationship between hip strength and 
self-reported patient-reported outcome (PRO) scores.
OBJECTIVE: To compare isometric peak torque for hip-extension (H-EXT) and 
hip-abduction (H-ABD), as well as PRO scores between CAI, lateral ankle sprain 
copers (LAS copers), and uninjured controls (UC). The secondary purpose was to 
examine the relationship between isometric hip peak torque and PROs in 
participants with CAI.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional.
SETTING: Laboratory.
PARTICIPANTS: Sixty-three individuals, 45 women (23.02 [3.83] y, 165.91 
[7.55] cm, 67.28 [11.95] kg) and 18 men (26.28 [5.43] y, 179.28 [9.01] cm, 83.87 
[13.26] kg), grouped as uninjured control (n = 26), LAS coper (n = 15), or CAI 
(n = 22).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The Foot and Ankle Ability Measure was used to assess 
region-specific HRQL. The Fear Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire was used to 
assess injury-related fear. The Disablement in Physically Active was used to 
assess global HRQL. Isometric peak torque was measured with a handheld 
dynamometer for H-EXT and H-ABD.
RESULTS: No group differences were observed for H-ABD (P = .34) or H-EXT (P = 
.35). The CAI group had significantly worse scores on all PROs compared with LAS 
coper (P < .001) and HC (P < .001). Moderate-weak correlations were found 
between H-ABD and Foot and Ankle Ability Measure-activities of daily living (P = 
.047; ρ = .392) and Foot and Ankle Ability Measure-Sport (P = .013; ρ = .482) 
and H- EXT and Fear Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire-Work (P = .007; ρ = -.517).
CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with CAI displayed lower HRQL based on worse scores on 
generic, dimension-specific, and region-specific PROs compared with LAS copers 
and uninjured controls. There were no significant between-group differences for 
H-EXT and H-ABD isometric peak torque production, but there was a moderate 
positive relationship between isometric H-ABD and self-reported ankle disability 
in individuals with CAI.

Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is an extremely aggressive primary human brain 
tumor. The median survival of GBM patients is 15 months in case of completing 
the modern complex treatment protocol. Chemotherapy can help to extend the life 
expectancy of patients. GBM treatment resistance is associated with cancer stem 
cells (CSCs). The present paper analyses the main reasons for ineffectiveness of 
the existing GBM treatment methods and suggests treating CSCs as a complex 
phenomenon, resulting from the coordinated interaction of normal stem cells and 
cancer cells (CCs) in immunosuppressive microsurroundings. The GBM treatment 
strategy is suggested not for only suppressing strategically important signaling 
pathways in CCs, but also for regulating interaction between normal stem cells 
and cancer cells. The paper considers the issue of controlling penetrability of 
the blood-brain barrier that is one of the main challenges in neuro-oncology. 
Also, the paper suggests the ways of extending life expectancy of GBM patients 
today and prospects for the near future.

OBJECTIVE: To report the global burden of maternal disorders and their main 
subcategories in 195 countries and territories between 2007 and 2017.
METHODS: The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 
2017 estimated maternal disease burden at global, regional, and country levels. 
Maternal disorders were disaggregated into 10 categories, and estimated 
incidence and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) of maternal disorders were 
reported separately. Indicators were estimated in different geographic settings 
and different sociodemographic index (SDI) regions. Based on GBD 2017 estimates, 
we systematically examined the incidence and DALYs of maternal disorders and 
their main subcategories at the global, regional, and national levels during the 
period from 2007 to 2017 by age and SDI.
RESULTS: Globally, a total of 7.98 million maternal disorders occurred in 2017, 
with a 4.33% (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 3.24%-5.60%) decrease in 
age-standardized incidence rate and a more significant decrease (30.26%) in the 
age-standardized rate of DALYs. Most incidences and DALYs were found in 
low-income and middle-income countries, especially in the sub-Saharan region. 
The greatest incidence of maternal disorders was found to be in maternal 
abortion and miscarriage (2.00 million), and the highest disease burden was in 
maternal hemorrhage (2.23 million).
CONCLUSION: A slight increase in the incidence of maternal disorders and 
substantial reductions in DALYs of overall maternal disorders and their main 
subcategories were found from 2007 to 2017, especially in low-income countries 
and the sub-Saharan region. Maternal hemorrhage, hypertensive disorders, and 
indirect maternal death were the top three causes of maternal disorders disease 
burden.

With increased life expectancy and the growing total population of elderly 
patients, there has been rise in the number of cases of acute appendicitis in 
elderly people. Although acute appendicitis is not the most typical pathological 
condition in the elderly, it is not uncommon. Most of these patients require 
surgical treatment, and as with any acute surgical pathology in advanced age, 
treatment possibilities are affected by comorbidities, overall health status, 
and an increased risk of complications. In this literature review we discuss 
differences in acute appendicitis in the elderly population, with a focus on 
clinical signs, diagnostics, pathogenesis, treatment, and results.

As the life expectancy of the population increases worldwide, cancer is becoming 
a substantial public health problem. Considering its recurrence and mortality 
rates, most cancer cases are difficult to cure. In recent decades, a large 
number of studies have been carried out on different cancer types; 
unfortunately, tumor incidence and mortality have not been effectively improved. 
At present, early diagnostic biomarkers and accurate therapeutic strategies for 
cancer are lacking. High temperature requirement A1 (HtrA1) is a trypsin-fold 
serine protease that is also a chymotrypsin-like protease family member 
originally discovered in bacteria and later discovered in mammalian systems. 
HtrA1 gene expression is decreased in diverse cancers, and it may play a role as 
a tumor suppressor for promoting the death of tumor cells. This work aimed to 
examine the role of HtrA1 as a cell type-specific diagnostic biomarker or as an 
internal and external regulatory factor of diverse cancers. The findings of this 
study will facilitate the development of HtrA1 as a therapeutic target.

BACKGROUND: Acute renal colic caused by urinary calculi (ARCUC) has a 
considerable impact on the quality of life. Acupuncture might be a potential 
treatment option. However, the evidence is limited. We will conduct this trial 
to evaluate the efficacy and safety of acupuncture as adjunctive treatment to 
diclofenac for ARCUC.
METHODS/DESIGN: A total of 80 eligible patients who are diagnosed with urinary 
stone renal colic will be randomly allocated to the acupuncture group or the 
sham acupuncture group. Each patient will receive 1 session of acupuncture or 
sham acupuncture. The primary outcome will be the response rate of patients 
achieving a reduction of > 50% on visual analog score (VAS) from baseline to 
10 min after treatment. Secondary outcomes will include the VAS, remedial 
analgesia, re-visit and admission rate, blinding assessment, credibility and 
expectancy, and adverse event. All patients who receive randomization will be 
included in the intent-to-treat analysis.
DISCUSSION: The finding of this trial will provide evidence on the efficacy and 
safety of acupuncture for the treatment of ARCUC. The results of this study will 
be published in peer-reviewed journals.

Lifestyle-related non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and their risk factors are 
unequivocally associated with SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility and COVID-19 severity. 
NCD manifestations and their lifestyle risks are associated with chronic 
low-grade systemic inflammation (CLGSI). This review supports that 
immuno-modulation with positive lifestyle change aimed at reducing SARS-CoV-2 
susceptibility and COVID-19 severity, is a goal consistent with contemporary 
physiotherapy practice. Physiotherapists have a long tradition of managing a , 
thus, managing CLGSI is a logical extension. Improving patients' lifestyle 
practices also reduces their NCD risks and increases activity/exercise capacity, 
health and wellbeing - all principal goals of contemporary physiotherapy. The 
COVID-19 pandemic lends further support for prioritising health and lifestyle 
competencies including smoking cessation; whole food plant-based nutrition; 
healthy weight; healthy sleep practices; and stress management; in conjunction 
with reducing sedentariness and increasing physical activity/exercise, to 
augment immunity as well as function and overall health and wellbeing. To 
support patients' lifestyle change efforts, physiotherapists may refer patients 
to other health professionals. The authors conclude that immuno-modulation with 
lifestyle behaviour change to reduce susceptibility to viruses including 
SARS-CoV-2, is consistent with contemporary physiotherapy practice. 
Immuno-modulation needs to be reflected in health competencies taught in 
physiotherapy professional education curricula and taught at standards 
comparable to other established interventions.

Globally, gas flaring caused 350 million tonnes of CO2 emissions in 2018. In 
addition to climate change, this burning practice also has other negative 
consequences for humans (e.g., respiratory problems) and the environment. The 
aim of this paper is to quantify the impact of flaring on human health (at the 
global and country level) via the calculation of the number of 
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) caused by the combustion of associated 
gas. For this quantification, gas flaring emissions were linked with midpoint 
indicators (e.g., climate change) in life cycle assessment (LCA) for all 
selected countries. Regionalised characterisation factors (CFs) were applied in 
the impact assessment to allow for spatial differentiation. The global impact on 
human health caused by flaring was obtained by taking the sum for all countries. 
The results show that these flaring emissions globally cause 4.83 × 105 DALYs or 
6.19 × 10-5 DALYs/person on an annual basis. This amounts to 0.12% of the total 
DALYs related to air pollution (from PM2.5) caused by all polluting sectors and 
6.51% of the total DALYs related to climate change. To quantify these impacts, 
this study uses a country perspective rather than considering local 
characteristics. Thus, if more precise information at a more local level (e.g., 
city level) is sought, additional factors (e.g., meteorological conditions) 
should be taken into account. Finally, future research should also focus on the 
benefits of gas flaring reduction techniques to enable the selection of the most 
promising technologies for the elimination of gas flaring and its effects.

Including the costs of non-medical consumption in life years gained in economic 
evaluations of medical interventions has been controversial. This paper focuses 
on the estimation of these costs using Dutch data coming from cross-sectional 
household surveys consisting of 56,569 observations covering the years 
1978-2004. We decomposed the costs of consumption into age, period and cohort 
effects and modelled the non-linear age and cohort patterns of consumption using 
P-splines. As consumption patterns depend on household composition, we also 
estimated household size using the same regression modeling strategy. Estimates 
of non-medical consumption and household size were combined with life tables to 
estimate the impact of including non-medical survivor costs on an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Results revealed that including non-medical 
survivor costs substantially increases the ICER, but the effect varies strongly 
with age. The impact of cohort effects is limited but ignoring household 
economies of scale results in a significant overestimation of non-medical costs. 
We conclude that a) ignoring the costs of non-medical consumption results in an 
underestimation of the costs of life prolonging interventions b) economies of 
scale within households with respect to consumption should be accounted for when
