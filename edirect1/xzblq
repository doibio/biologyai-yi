Geographic range size is often conceptualized as a fixed attribute of a species 
and treated as such for the purposes of quantification of extinction risk; 
species occupying smaller geographic ranges are assumed to have a higher risk of 
extinction, all else being equal. However many species are mobile, and their 
movements range from relatively predictable to-and-fro migrations to complex 
irregular movements shown by nomadic species. These movements can lead to 
substantial temporary expansion and contraction of geographic ranges, 
potentially to levels which may pose an extinction risk. By linking occurrence 
data with environmental conditions at the time of observations of nomadic 
species, we modeled the dynamic distributions of 43 arid-zone nomadic bird 
species across the Australian continent for each month over 11 years and 
calculated minimum range size and extent of fluctuation in geographic range size 
from these models. There was enormous variability in predicted spatial 
distribution over time; 10 species varied in estimated geographic range size by 
more than an order of magnitude, and 2 species varied by >2 orders of magnitude. 
During times of poor environmental conditions, several species not currently 
classified as globally threatened contracted their ranges to very small areas, 
despite their normally large geographic range size. This finding raises 
questions about the adequacy of conventional assessments of extinction risk 
based on static geographic range size (e.g., IUCN Red Listing). Climate change 
is predicted to affect the pattern of resource fluctuations across much of the 
southern hemisphere, where nomadism is the dominant form of animal movement, so 
it is critical we begin to understand the consequences of this for accurate 
threat assessment of nomadic species. Our approach provides a tool for 
discovering spatial dynamics in highly mobile species and can be used to unlock 
valuable information for improved extinction risk assessment and conservation 
planning.

BACKGROUND: There is policy interest in the screening and treatment of mental 
health problems in young people who offend, but the value of such screening is 
not yet known.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the diagnostic test accuracy of screening measures for 
mental health problems in young people who offend; to evaluate the clinical 
effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of screening and treatment; to model 
estimates of cost; to assess the evidence base for screening against UK National 
Screening Committee criteria; and to identify future research priorities.
DATA SOURCES: In total, 25 electronic databases including MEDLINE, PsycINFO, 
EMBASE and The Cochrane Library were searched from inception until April 2011. 
Reverse citation searches of included studies were undertaken and reference list 
of included studies were examined.
REVIEW METHODS: Two reviewers independently examined titles and abstracts and 
extracted data from included studies using a standardised form. The inclusion 
criteria for the review were (1) population - young offenders (aged 10-21 
years); (2) intervention/instrument - screening instruments for mental health 
problems, implementation of a screening programme or a psychological or 
pharmacological intervention as part of a clinical trial; (3) comparator - for 
diagnostic test accuracy studies, any standardised diagnostic interview; for 
trials, any comparator; (4) outcomes - details of diagnostic test accuracy, 
mental health outcomes over the short or longer term or measurement of cost 
data; and (5) study design - for diagnostic test accuracy studies, any design; 
for screening programmes, randomised controlled trials or controlled trials; for 
clinical effectiveness studies, randomised controlled trials; for economic 
studies, economic evaluations of screening strategies or interventions.
RESULTS: Of 13,580 studies identified, nine, including eight independent 
samples, met the inclusion criteria for the diagnostic test accuracy and 
validity of screening measures review. Screening accuracy was typically modest. 
No studies examined the clinical effectiveness of screening, although 10 studies 
were identified that examined the clinical effectiveness of interventions for 
mental health problems. There were too few studies to make firm conclusions 
about the clinical effectiveness of treatments in this population. No studies 
met the inclusion criteria for the assessment of the cost-effectiveness of 
screening or treatment. An exemplar decision model was developed for depression, 
which identified a number of the likely key drivers of uncertainty, including 
the prevalence of unidentified mental health problems, the severity of mental 
health problems and their relationship to generic measures of outcome and the 
impact of treatment on recidivism. The information evaluated as part of the 
review was relevant to five of the UK National Screening Committee criteria. On 
the basis of the above results, none of the five criteria was met.
LIMITATIONS: The conclusions of the review are based on limited evidence. 
Conclusions are tentative and the decision model should be treated as an 
exemplar.
CONCLUSIONS: Evidence on the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of 
screening for mental health problems in young people who offend is currently 
lacking. Future research should consider feasibility trials of clinical 
interventions to establish important parameters ahead of conducting definitive 
trials. Future diagnostic studies should compare the diagnostic test accuracy of 
a range of screening instruments, including those recommended for use in the UK 
in this population. These studies should be designed to reduce the decision 
uncertainty identified by the exemplar decision model.

BACKGROUND: Limited data are available regarding outcomes in elderly head and 
neck cancer patients. This retrospective study was designed to characterize head 
and neck cancer in geriatric patients.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study included all patients in a large 
university-based tumor registry who were diagnosed with head and neck cancer 
from January 1, 1990, to December 31, 2005. Patients aged ≥70 years at the time 
of diagnosis were defined as older. Overall survival and progression-free 
survival were censored at 60 months. Survival differences were compared using 
the log-rank test. Hazard ratios were estimated using a Cox proportional hazards 
model, adjusting for potential confounders.
RESULTS: Of 1,598 patients identified, 1,166 patients were aged <70 years (i.e., 
younger) and 281 patients were aged ≥70 years (older). When controlling for 
possible confounders, older patients were nearly twice as likely to die within 5 
years as their younger counterparts (hazard ratio: 1.92). The median life 
expectancy for older patients was nearly 5 years for stage I-II disease and <2 
years for stage III-IV disease. Older patients with stage III-IV disease who 
received multimodality therapy had 5-year survival similar to that younger 
patients with stage III-IV disease who were treated similarly (33.2% vs. 44.0%). 
Older patients with stage III-IV disease who received single-modality therapy 
had extremely poor survival compared with all other patients (hazard ratio for 
progression-free survival: 1.5).
CONCLUSION: This study highlights the need for better understanding of the 
factors affecting head and neck cancer outcomes in elderly patients. Information 
about life expectancy in elderly head and neck cancer patients may help guide 
treatment decisions.

OBJECTIVE: To understand the characteristics and retention situation of clients 
in extension clinic of methadone maintenance therapy.
METHODS: From December 20, 2010 to March 10, 2011, the system sampling method 
was used to get the cases. A total of 462 heroin addicts from 22 methadone 
maintenance therapy clinics and extension clinics located in Mangshi, Ruili, 
Longchuan, Yingjiang, Lianghe of Dehong prefecture, Yunnan province were 
interviewed, and the demographic characteristics, quality of life, urine testing 
results for morphine of the patients between the extension MMT clinic and 
standard MMT clinic were also collected and compared. A cohort study was 
conducted to analyze retention situation of the new clients with Kaplan Meier 
method during 9 months treatment.
RESULTS: Of the 462 cases, 239 cases were from standard MMT clinic, and 223 
cases were from the extension MMT clinic. Among them, 117 cases were new 
research objects into the group during the investigation. Among the clients of 
extension MMT clinic, 96.7% (147/152) of them were males, 37.5% (57/152) were 
Dai nationality, and 61.2% (93/152) were married, 38.8% (59/152) with primary 
school education, 95.4% (145/152) lived with their family or relatives, 96.7% 
(147/152) could arrive at the clinic from their habitation within 15 minutes. 
The positive detection rates 72% (13/18), 71% (24/34), 58% (30/52), 29% (15/52), 
14% (6/44), 14% (4/29), 15% (5/34), 17% (6/35), 6% (2/33), 16% (5/31) of 
urine-morphine testing among new clients of extension MMT clinics decreased as 
the period of treatment lengthened (χ(2) = 61.04, P < 0.05). The period of 
retention of the clients in extension MMT clinics was 175-days averagely, with 
an average retention 122 days of when withdrawing. The retention rates of the 
clients were 52% (37/71)and 61% (28/46) at 9th month of the extension MMT 
clinics and standard MMT clinics respectively. There was no difference in the 
retention rate between those of two types of clinics (χ(2) = 0.82, P = 0.37) .
CONCLUSION: Most of the clients in extension MMT clinics lived with their family 
or relatives, and spent less time on the way to the clinics. After 9 months 
methadone maintenance therapy, the quality of life of clients in extension 
clinics was improved while addiction among them decreased. The extension clinic 
was an effective strategy for retention in remote areas.

Despite controversy over the risks and benefits of statin therapy, statins 
continue to be commonly used medicines by older people. In a cohort study of 
participants aged ≥70 years (n = 540) living in residential care, Sydney, we 
found that the proportion of statin users decreased gradually from the baseline 
of 33.1% to 31.3% at 6 months (P = 0.13) and to 28.7% over 1 year (P = 0.002). 
Prevalence of statin use decreased with increasing age, with individuals aged 
≥90 years being more likely to discontinue or deprescribe statins. The patterns 
of statin use did not change according to increasing baseline dose or baseline 
indication.

BACKGROUND: The seroprevalence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection among 
Canadians is estimated at 0.3% to 0.9%. Of those with chronic HCV infection, 10% 
to 20% will experience advanced liver disease by 30 years of infection. Targeted 
screening seems a plausible strategy. We aimed to estimate the health and 
economic effects of various screening and treatment strategies for chronic HCV 
infection in Canada.
METHODS: We used a state-transition model to examine the cost-effectiveness of 4 
screening strategies: no screening; screen and treat with pegylated interferon 
plus ribavarin; screen and treat with pegylated interferon and ribavarin-based 
direct-acting antiviral agents; and screen and treat with interferon-free 
direct-acting antivirals. We considered Canadian residents in 2 age groups: 
25-64 and 45-64 years of age. We obtained model data from the literature. We 
predicted deaths related to chronic HCV infection, costs, quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios.
RESULTS: We found that screening and treating would prevent at least 9 
HCV-related deaths per 10,000 persons screened over the lifetime of the cohort. 
Screening was associated with QALY increases of 0.0032 to 0.0095 and cost 
increases of $124 to $338 per person, which translated to an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio of $34,359 to $44,034 per QALY gained, relative to no 
screening, depending on age group screened and antiviral therapy received.
INTERPRETATION: A selective one-time HCV screening program for people 25-64 or 
45-64 years of age in Canada would likely be cost-effective. Identification of 
silent cases of chronic HCV infection and the offer of treatment when 
appropriate could extend the lives of Canadians at reasonable cost.

BACKGROUND: Evidence-based consensus guidelines recommend only observation for 
men with low-risk prostate cancer and life expectancy less than 10 years. This 
report describes the incidence, drivers, cost, and morbidity of overtreatment of 
low-risk prostate cancer within the United States.
METHODS: The SEER-Medicare Program was used to identify 11,744 men aged 66 years 
or older diagnosed with low-risk prostate cancer in 2004 through 2007. 
Overtreatment of prostate cancer was defined as definitive treatment of a 
patient with a life expectancy of less than 10 years. Expected survival was 
estimated using NCCN methodology. Costs were the amount paid by Medicare in 
years after minus year before diagnosis. Toxicities were relevant Medicare 
diagnoses/interventions. P values are 2-sided.
RESULTS: Of 3001 men with low-risk prostate cancer and a life expectancy of less 
than 10 years, 2011 men (67%) were overtreated. On multivariable logistic 
regression, overtreated men were more likely to be married (odds ratio [OR], 
1.29; 95% CI, 1.05-1.59; P=.02), reside in affluent regions (P<.001), and harbor 
more advanced disease at diagnosis (P<.001). Two-year toxicity was greater in 
overtreated patients (P<.001). Relative to active surveillance/watchful 
waiting/observation, the median additional cost per definitive treatment was 
$18,827 over 5 years; the cumulative annual cost attributable to overtreatment 
in the United States was $58.7 million. The ability to avoid treating the 80% of 
men with low-grade disease who will never die of prostate cancer would save 
$1.32 billion per year nationally.
CONCLUSIONS: Overtreatment of low-risk prostate cancer is partially driven by 
sociodemographic factors and occurs frequently, with marked impact on patient 
quality of life and health-related costs.

BACKGROUND: Long-acting antiretroviral therapy (LA-ART) is currently under 
development and could improve outcomes for human immunodeficiency virus 
(HIV)-infected individuals with poor daily ART adherence.
METHODS: We used a computer simulation model to evaluate the cost-effectiveness 
of 3 LA-ART strategies vs daily oral ART for all: (1) LA-ART for patients with 
multiple ART failures; (2) second-line LA-ART for those failing first-line 
therapy; and (3) first-line LA-ART for ART-naive patients. We calculated the 
maximum annual cost of LA-ART at which each strategy would be cost-effective at 
a willingness to pay of $100 000 per quality-adjusted life-year. We assumed HIV 
RNA suppression on daily ART ranged from 0% to 91% depending on adherence, vs 
91% suppression on LA-ART regardless of daily ART adherence. In sensitivity 
analyses, we varied adherence, efficacy of LA-ART and daily ART, and loss to 
follow-up.
RESULTS: Relative to daily ART, LA-ART increased overall life expectancy by 
0.15-0.24 years, and by 0.51-0.89 years among poorly adherent patients, 
depending on the LA-ART strategy. LA-ART after multiple failures became 
cost-effective at an annual drug cost of $48 000; in sensitivity analysis, this 
threshold varied from $40 000-$70 000. Second-line LA-ART and first-line LA-ART 
became cost-effective at an annual drug cost of $26 000-$31 000 and $24 000-$27 
000, vs $28 000 and $25 000 for current second-line and first-line regimens.
CONCLUSIONS: LA-ART could improve survival of HIV patients, especially those 
with poor daily ART adherence. At an annual cost of $40 000-$70 000, LA-ART will 
offer good value for patients with multiple prior failures. To be a viable 
option for first- or second-line therapy, however, its cost must approach that 
of currently available regimens.

BACKGROUND: Extending mammalian health span and life span has been achieved 
under a variety of dietary restriction protocols. Reducing the intake of a 
specific amino acid has also been shown to extend health and longevity. We 
recently reported that methionine (MET) restriction is not effective in life 
span extension in growth hormone (GH) signaling mutants. To better understand 
the apparent necessity of GH in the 'sensing' of altered dietary MET, the 
current study was designed to evaluate MET and glutathione (GSH) metabolism (as 
well as other pathways) in long-living GH-deficient Ames dwarf and wild-type 
mice following 8 weeks of restricted (0.16%), low (0.43%), or enriched (1.3%) 
dietary MET consumption. Metabolite expression was examined in liver tissue, 
while gene and protein expression were evaluated in liver, kidney, and muscle 
tissues.
RESULTS: Body weight was maintained in dwarf mice on the MET diets, while 
wild-type mice on higher levels of MET gained weight. Liver MET levels were 
similar in Ames mice, while several MET pathway enzymes were elevated regardless 
of dietary MET intake. Transsulfuration enzymes were also elevated in Ames mice 
but differences in cysteine levels were not different between genotypes. Dwarf 
mice maintained higher levels of GSH on MET restriction compared to wild-type 
mice, while genotype and diet effects were also detected in thioredoxin and 
glutaredoxin. MET restriction increased transmethylation in both genotypes as 
indicated by increased S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), betaine, and dimethylglycine. 
Diet did not impact levels of glycolytic components, but dwarf mice exhibited 
higher levels of key members of this pathway. Coenzyme A and measures of fatty 
acid oxidation were elevated in dwarf mice and unaffected by diet.
CONCLUSIONS: This component analysis between Ames and wild-type mice suggests 
that the life span differences observed may result from the atypical MET 
metabolism and downstream effects on multiple systems. The overall lack of 
responsiveness to the different diets is well reflected across many metabolic 
pathways in dwarf mice indicating the importance of GH signaling in the ability 
to discriminate dietary amino acid levels.

Various attempts have been made to measure the burden of alcohol, drugs and 
tobacco smoking on population health, and mortality is an often used measure. As 
part of the governmental strategy to prevent use of alcohol, drugs, doping and 
tobacco (ANDT) in Sweden, we assessed disease burden measured by DALY 
(Disability Adjusted Life Years), attributed to alcohol, drugs and tobacco over 
time, as an overall indicator of problem level. DALY was developed within the 
Global Burden of Disease study (GBD), and combines life lost to premature death 
(YLL) and years lived with disability (YLD) in one measure. In 2010 tobacco 
contributed to 7.7% of the total disease burden in Sweden, followed by alcohol 
(3.4%) and drugs (1.3%). The disease burden caused by tobacco has decreased 
substantially since 1990, while small changes are observed for alcohol and 
drugs. Much of the disease burden specially related to drugs and alcohol was 
related to YLD, which can be captured with the DALY measure.

BACKGROUND: In elderly and comorbid patients with rectal cancer, radical surgery 
is associated with significant perioperative mortality. Data suggest that a 
watch-and-wait approach where a complete clinical response is obtained after 
neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy might be oncologically safe.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine whether patient age and comorbidity 
should influence surgeon and patient decision making where a complete clinical 
response is obtained.
DESIGN: Decision-analytic modeling consisting of a decision tree and Markov 
chain simulation was used. Modeled outcome parameters were elicited both from 
comprehensive literature review and from a national patient outcomes database.
SETTINGS: Outcomes for 3 patient cohorts treated with neoadjuvant therapy were 
modeled after either surgery or watch and wait.
PATIENTS: Patients included 60-year-old and 80-year-old men with mild 
comorbidities (Charlson score <3) and 80-year-old men with significant 
comorbidities (Charlson score >3).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Absolute survival, disease-free survival, and 
quality-adjusted life years were measured.
RESULTS: The model found that absolute survival was similar in 60-year-old 
patients but was significantly improved in fit and comorbid 80-year-old patients 
at 1 year after treatment where watch and wait was implemented instead of 
radical surgery, with a survival advantage of 10.1% (95% CI, 7.9-12.6) and 13.5% 
(95% CI, 10.2-16.9). At all of the other time points, absolute survival was 
equivalent for both techniques. There were no short- or long-term differences 
among any patient groups managed either by radical surgery or watch and wait in 
terms of either disease-free survival or quality-adjusted life years.
LIMITATIONS: Oncologic data for the watch-and-wait approach used for this study 
is derived from only a small number of studies pertaining to a highly selected 
group of patients. The 90-day postoperative mortality rate derived from the 
United Kingdom population-based study might be lower in other countries or 
individual institutions.
CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests competing effects of oncologic and surgical 
risk when using watch-and-wait management and that elderly and comorbid patients 
have the most to gain from this approach.

Brief report: HIV-1 transmissions during asymptomatic infection: exploring the 
impact of changes in HIV-1 viral load due to coinfections.

Liverpool School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, Liverpool, United Kingdom.

High HIV-1 plasma viral loads (PVLs) in sub-Saharan Africa, partly because of 
high rates of coinfection, may have been one of the drivers of the "explosive" 
epidemics seen in that region. Using a previously published framework of 
infectiousness and survival, we estimate the excess onward HIV-1 transmission 
events (secondary infections) resulting from coinfection-induced changes in PVL 
during asymptomatic HIV-1 infection. For every 100 HIV-infected people, each 
suffering 1 episode of tuberculosis infection, there are 4.9 (2.7th-97.5th 
percentile: 0.2-21.5) excess onward HIV-1 transmission events attributable to 
this coinfection. Other estimates are malaria 0.4 (0.0-2.0), soil-transmitted 
helminths 3.1 (0.1-14.9), schistosomiasis 8.5 (0.2-38.6), filariasis 13.3 
(0.3-89.2), syphilis 0.1 (0.0-1.6), herpes simplex virus 4.0 (0.0-24.2), and 
gonorrhea 2.1 (0.1-8.0) transmissions. If these higher PVLs confer a shorter 
life expectancy and higher infectiousness, then their impact on transmission is, 
in general, reduced. For most HIV-1 coinfections, the duration of a single 
infection is too short and/or the associated PVL elevation is too modest to 
contribute substantially to onward HIV-1 transmission.

Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension.

Medical School.

BACKGROUND: Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) results from 
inadequate recanalization of the pulmonary circulation after pulmonary 
thromboembolism. Its 2-year prevalence is 1-4% . If untreated, patients with 
CTEPH have a mean life expectancy of less than three years. Fortunately, a 
number of effective treatments are now available.
METHODS: This review is based on a selective search of PubMed for pertinent 
articles published from 1980 to 2014.
RESULTS: The gold-standard test for the exclusion of CTEPH is perfusion 
scintigraphy: the predictive value of a negative test is nearly 100% . On the 
other hand, confirmation of a positive diagnosis for treatment planning requires 
right-heart catheterization and pulmonary angiography. The treatment of first 
choice for CTEPH is surgical pulmonary endarterectomy (PEA), with which about 
70% of patients can be cured. The perioperative mortality of this procedure in 
experienced centers is now 2-4% . Thirty to 50% of all patients with CTEPH are 
considered inoperable; for these patients, and for patients with persistent 
pulmonary hypertension after PEA, the drug riociguat was introduced in Germany 
in 2014 (the first drug specifically introduced for the treatment of CTEPH). 
There is also a new interventional treatment option for inoperable 
patients-pulmonary balloon angioplasty, which is currently being performed in a 
small number of centers.
CONCLUSION: The timely diagnosis of CTEPH, followed by referral to a specialized 
center, is now more important than ever, because treatment options are now 
available for nearly all of the forms in which this disease can manifest itself.

Estimates of preference-weighted health outcomes or health state utilities are 
needed to assess improvements in health in terms of quality-adjusted life-years. 
Gains in quality-adjusted life-years are used to assess the cost-effectiveness 
of prophylactic use of clotting factor compared with on-demand treatment among 
people with hemophilia, a congenital bleeding disorder. Published estimates of 
health utilities for people with hemophilia vary, contributing to uncertainty in 
the estimates of cost-effectiveness of prophylaxis. Challenges in estimating 
utility weights for the purpose of evaluating hemophilia treatment include 
selection bias in observational data, difficulty in adjusting for predictors of 
health-related quality of life and lack of preference-based data comparing 
adults with lifetime or primary prophylaxis versus no prophylaxis living within 
the same country and healthcare system.

Chemotherapy-free treatment in patients with follicular lymphoma.

France.

The outcome of patients with follicular lymphoma (FL) has improved over the last 
two decades through the introduction of anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies, usually 
used in combination with chemotherapy. However, patients with FL still 
experience multiple relapses, requiring several lines of treatment. Early 
toxicity of chemotherapy is a significant concern and as the life expectancy of 
patients with FL is increasing, late toxicities become an increasingly important 
concern. Progress made in understanding the biology of FL, especially 
dysregulation of intracellular pathways and immunological antitumor responses, 
recently allowed for the development of innovative chemo-free therapeutic 
approaches. In this report, different options such as new anti-CD20 antibodies, 
antibodies targeting other cell surface antigens, bi-specific antibodies, 
immunomodulation, idiotype vaccine and other targeted therapies are presented. 
The article also highlights how, although promising in early phase studies, the 
cost-effectiveness of new agents will have to be justified in Phase III trials. 
Furthermore, chemo-free regimen might not mean toxicity-free treatment and 
monitoring of early and late toxicities is required.

A systematic review and economic evaluation of intraoperative tests [RD-100i 
one-step nucleic acid amplification (OSNA) system and Metasin test] for 
detecting sentinel lymph node metastases in breast cancer.

BACKGROUND: In breast cancer patients, sentinel lymph node biopsy is carried out 
at the same time as the removal of the primary tumour to postoperatively test 
with histopathology for regional metastases in the sentinel lymph node. Those 
patients with positive test results are then operated on 2-4 weeks after primary 
surgery to remove the lymph nodes from the axilla (axillary lymph node 
dissection, ALND). New molecular tests RD-100i [one-step nucleic acid 
amplification (OSNA); based on messenger RNA amplification to identify the 
cytokeratin-19 (CK19) gene marker] (Sysmex, Norderstedt, Germany) and Metasin 
(using the CK19 and mammaglobin gene markers) (Cellular Pathology, Princess 
Alexandra Hospital NHS Trust, Harlow, UK) are intended to provide an 
intraoperative diagnosis, thereby avoiding the need for postoperative 
histopathology and, in positive cases, a second operation for ALND.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of 
using OSNA and Metasin in the NHS in England for the intraoperative diagnosis of 
sentinel lymph nodes metastases, compared with postoperative histopathology, the 
current standard.
DATA SOURCES: Electronic databases including MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process & Other 
Non-Indexed Citations, EMBASE, The Cochrane Library and the Health Economic 
Evaluations Database as well as clinical trial registries, grey literature and 
conference proceedings were searched up to July 2012.
REVIEW METHODS: A systematic review of the evidence was carried out using 
standard methods. Single-gate studies were used to estimate the accuracy of OSNA 
with histopathology as the reference standard. The cost-effectiveness analysis 
adapted an existing simulation model of the long-term costs and health 
implications of early breast cancer diagnostic outcomes. The model accounted for 
the costs of an extended first operation with intraoperative testing, the loss 
of health-related quality of life (disutility) from waiting for postoperative 
test results, disutility and costs of a second operation, and long-term costs 
and disutility from lymphoedema related to ALND, adjuvant therapy, locoregional 
recurrence and metastatic recurrence.
RESULTS: A total of 724 references were identified in the searches, of which 17 
studies assessing test accuracy were included in the review, 15 on OSNA and two 
on Metasin. Both Metasin studies were unpublished. OSNA sensitivity of 84.5% 
[95% confidence interval (CI) 74.7% to 91.0%] and specificity of 91.8% (95% CI 
87.8% to 94.6%) for patient nodal status were estimated in a meta-analysis of 
five studies [unadjusted for tissue allocation bias (TAB)]. At these values and 
a 20% node-positive rate, OSNA resulted in lifetime discounted cost-savings of 
£498 and a quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) loss of 0.048 relative to 
histopathology, that is, £4324 saved per QALY lost. The most favourable 
plausible scenario for OSNA in terms of the node-positive rate (range 10-40%), 
diagnostic accuracy values (91.3% sensitivity and 94.2% specificity, from three 
reports that adjusted for TAB), the costs of histopathology, OSNA and second 
surgery, and long-term costs and utilities resulted in a maximum saving per QALY 
lost of £10,500; OSNA sensitivity and specificity would need to be ≥ 95% for 
this figure to be ≥ £20,000.
LIMITATIONS: There is limited evidence on the diagnostic test accuracy of 
intraoperative tests. The quality of information on costs of resource 
utilisation during the diagnostic pathway is low and no evidence exists on the 
disutility of waiting for a second surgery. No comparative studies exist that 
report clinical outcomes of intraoperative diagnostic tests. These knowledge 
gaps have more influence on the decision than current uncertainty in the 
performance of postoperative histopathology in standard practice.
CONCLUSIONS: One-step nucleic acid amplification is not cost-effective for the 
intraoperative diagnosis of sentinel lymph node metastases. OSNA is less 
accurate than histopathology and the consequent loss of health benefits in this 
patient group is not compensated for by health gains elsewhere in the health 
system that may be obtained with the cost-savings made. The evidence on Metasin 
is insufficient to evaluate its cost-effectiveness.

Low serum tryptophan predicts higher mortality in cardiovascular disease.

Murr C(1), Grammer TB, Kleber ME, Meinitzer A, März W, Fuchs D.

Author information:

Innsbruck, Austria.

BACKGROUND: The essential amino acid tryptophan is required for protein 
synthesis and formation of the neurotransmitter serotonin and may exert 
immunoregulatory functions. An accelerated tryptophan breakdown rate is 
associated with inflammation and immune activation.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Serum concentrations of free tryptophan, neopterin and 
high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) were measured in 1196 patients with 
coronary artery disease (CAD) derived from the LUdwigshafen RIsk and 
Cardiovascular Health (LURIC) study.
RESULTS: Tryptophan concentrations did not differ between patients with (mean ± 
SD: 40.1 ± 9.8 μM) or without (42.3 ± 23.9 μM; not significant, Welch's test) 
angiographic CAD, but patients with CAD had higher neopterin (9.1 ± 8.2 nM) and 
hsCRP (9.3 ± 18.5 mg/L) concentrations compared to patients without (neopterin: 
7.6 ± 4.7 nM, hsCRP: 5.8 ± 7.6 mg/L; both P < 0.0001). There existed an inverse 
correlation between serum tryptophan and neopterin (Spearman's rank correlation: 
rs = -0.273) and hsCRP (rs = -0.163; both P < 0.0001) concentrations. Median 
observation time was 10.5 years, and 385 patients had died, including 244 
patients due to cardiovascular and 132 due to noncardiovascular causes. After 
adjustments for cardiovascular risk factors and other possible confounders, the 
hazard ratio (with 95% CI) in the first tryptophan quartile of the study 
population was 1.51 (1.19-1.90; P = 0.0006) for total mortality, 1.41 
(1.05-1.89; P = 0.0224) for cardiovascular and 1.79 (1.20-2.67; P = 0.0042) for 
noncardiovascular mortalities, respectively, thus indicating a significantly 
higher risk of death in patients with tryptophan concentrations < 34 μM.
CONCLUSIONS: Low serum tryptophan in patients with CAD is associated with immune 
activation and indicates reduced life expectancy.

We compared the costs and cost-effectiveness of telemonitoring vs usual care for 
patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). A total of 256 
patients were randomised to either telemonitoring or usual care. In the 
telemonitoring arm, the touch-screen telemonitoring equipment transmitted data 
to clinical teams monitoring the patients. Total healthcare costs were estimated 
over a 12-month period from a National Health Service perspective and quality 
adjusted life year (QALYs) were estimated by the EQ-5D tool. Telemonitoring was 
not significantly more costly than usual care (mean difference per patient 
£2065.90 (P < 0.18). The increased costs were predominantly due to 
telemonitoring service costs and non-significantly higher secondary care costs. 
Telemonitoring for COPD was not cost-effective at a base case of £137,277 per 
QALY with only 15% probability of being cost-effective at the usual threshold of 
£30,000 per QALY. Although there was some statistical and methodological 
uncertainty in the measures used, telemonitoring was not cost-effective in the 
sensitivity analyses performed. It seems unlikely that a telemonitoring service 
of the kind that was trialled would be cost-effective in providing care for 
people with COPD.

VLED and formula LED in the management of type 2 diabetes: defining the clinical 
need and research requirements.

It has been known for many years that substantial weight loss, achieved by 
bariatric surgery or non-surgical means can mean normalize glucose tolerance. 
Recent randomized controlled trial evidence indicates that >15 kg weight loss is 
necessary, to this and it may lead to near normalization (doubling) of life 
expectancy. Less than 5% of patients achieve this through even the best, 
evidence-based medical weight management programme (Counterweight 
http://www.counterweight.org). A weight loss of >15 kg is easily achievable by 8 
weeks very low-energy diet (VLED)/LELD (Low energy Liquid-formula Diet) in 
compliant patients, with little difference between 400 and 800 kcal day(-1) , 
but weight maintenance after VLED has until recently been so poor that VLED is 
not, at present, recommended in clinical guidelines. However, mean weight loss 
close to >15 kg can be maintained 18-24 months using a variety of maintenance 
strategies. These include a structured reintroduction of foods linked to an 
education programme with behavioural strategies, intermittent VLED use and 
prescribable anti-obesity drugs (dexfenfluramine, orlistat, sibutramine). Most 
of these studies have been in non-diabetic subjects. A new 'curative' paradigm 
in type 2 diabetes mellitus management, aiming to normalize glucose tolerance 
and health risks by achieving and maintaining >15 kg loss, as soon as possible 
after diagnosis, should be highly acceptable to patients, generating many 
additional Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs). It is likely to be highly 
cost-effective by avoiding the current recommended, mainly palliative, model, 
using polypharmacy which provides an overall risk reduction of only 5-10%. 
Clinical trials are on-going to establish the feasibility of delivering formula 
(LELD) and a maintenance programme to large numbers of patients within routine 
primary care. There is urgent need, to run similar studies in diabetic patients. 
New approaches to long-term (lifelong) maintenance of weight loss and a 
non-diabetic state may include anti-obesity drugs.

Multiple myeloma (MM) is a plasma cell malignancy leading to significant 
life-expectancy shortening. Although the incorporation of the novel agents 
thalidomide, bortezomib, and lenalidomide in the front-line therapy has resulted 
in significant improvement, almost all patients relapse, making the treatment of 
relapse a real challenge. In the present article, when and how to treat relapsed 
MM is discussed. Treatment can be safely delayed in a subset of patients with 
asymptomatic relapse, whereas those with symptomatic relapse, advanced disease 
at diagnosis, or significant paraproteinemic increase require prompt rescue 
therapy. The benefit of retreatment and the use of a sequential approach for 
successive relapses considering drug synergism are highlighted. For patients 
with aggressive relapses and for those who have exhausted all available options, 
continued therapy until disease progression is recommended, particularly when 
using regimens with a long-term safety profile. Patients with a duration 
response to a first autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) longer than 2 
years may benefit from a second ASCT. Patients with aggressive disease and/or 
poor cytogenetics at diagnosis relapsing within the first 2 years from ASCT 
should be considered for an allogeneic transplantation. Finally, a number of 
newer promising drugs are being actively investigated and the enrolment of 
patients in clinical trials is encouraged.
