twice each 10-15 years is noted. Even at maintenance of level of sugar at 
diabetes accumulation of the secondary metabolites breaking small vessels isn't 
excluded. At the same time many life-endangering complications develop.
OBJECTIVE: To identify the possibilities of plasmapheresis in the prevention and 
treatment of complications of metabolic syndrome.
METHOD: Analysis of the world literature data on complications of metabolic 
syndrome and methods of their treatment.
RESULTS: At metabolic syndrome the frequency of strokes and myocardial 
infarctions there is twice more often than in population. For 5-9 years the 
general life expectancy decreases. Disorders of microcirculation at diabetes 
lead to a retinopathy with total loss of sight, a nephropathy from the outcome 
in a renal failure, to polyneuropathy and diabetic foot syndrome with high risk 
of high level amputations of the lower extremities. At the same time 
medicamentous therapy is not able to prevent such complications and almost only 
way of removal of these pathological metabolites is therapeutic apheresis, 
mainly the plasmapheresis. Data from our own studies confirm the effectiveness 
of such tactics.
CONCLUSION: Plasmapheresis has to be applied not only to the correction of 
already critical conditions, but also to their prevention.

We examined the effects of continuous overexpression of thioredoxin (Trx) 1 on 
aging in Trx1 transgenic mice [Tg(TXN)+/0]. This study was conducted to test 
whether increased thioredoxin expression over the lifespan in mice would alter 
aging and age-related pathology because our previous study demonstrated that 
Tg(act-TXN)+/0 mice had no significant maximum life extension, possibly due to 
the use of actin as a promoter, which may have resulted in loss of Trx1 
overexpression during aging. To test this hypothesis, we generated new Trx1 
transgenic mice using a fragment of the human genome containing the TXN gene 
with an endogenous promoter to ensure continuous overexpression of Trx1 
throughout the lifespan. Universal overexpression of Trx1 was observed, and Trx1 
overexpression was maintained during aging (up to 22-24 months old) in the 
Tg(TXN)+/0 mice. The levels of Trx1 are significantly higher (approximately 4 to 
31 fold) in all of the tissues examined in the Tg(TXN)+/0 mice compared to the 
wild-type (WT) littermates. The overexpression of Trx1 did not cause any changes 
in the levels of Trx2, glutaredoxin, glutathione, or other major antioxidant 
enzymes. The survival study demonstrated that male Tg(TXN)+/0 mice slightly 
extended the earlier part of the lifespan compared to WT littermates, but no 
significant life extension was observed over the lifespan. The cross-sectional 
pathological analysis (22-25 months old) showed that Tg(TXN)+/0 mice had a 
significantly higher severity of lymphoma and more tumor burden than WT mice, 
which was associated with the suppression of the apoptosis signal-regulating 
kinase 1 (ASK1) pathway. Our findings suggest that the increased levels of Trx1 
over the lifespan in Tg(TXN)+/0 mice showed some beneficial effects (slight 
extension of lifespan) in the earlier part of life but had no significant 
effects on median or maximum lifespans, and increased Trx1 levels enhanced tumor 
development in old mice.

metastases: A systematic review.

PURPOSE: Stereotactic radiation surgery (SRS) is increasingly applied in 
patients with brain metastases (BM) and is expected to have fewer adverse 
effects on cognitive functioning than whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT). 
Patients with BM are often confronted with a relatively short life expectancy, 
and the prevention or delay of cognitive decline to maintain quality of life is 
a clinically and highly relevant treatment goal. This review systematically and 
specifically evaluates the current literature on the cognitive effects of SRS in 
patients with BM.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: Published trials on SRS alone or in combination with 
WBRT, including objective assessment of cognitive functioning, were identified 
through a systematic search of the PubMed database up to March 2018.
RESULTS: Of the 241 records screened, 14 studies matched the selection criteria: 
2 pilot studies, 7 single-group/observational trials (1 study update), and 5 
randomized trials (1 secondary analysis).
CONCLUSIONS: In general, the results show little to no objective cognitive 
decline up to 4 months after SRS compared with WBRT. However, most trials 
suffered from methodologic limitations that hindered reliable conclusions. Most 
importantly, few studies investigated the specific cognitive effects of SRS 
alone or versus WBRT. Furthermore, disentangling the cognitive effects of SRS 
from the effects of the disease itself and from the effects of other treatments 
remains very difficult. By presenting this comprehensive review, we aim to 
encourage researchers to probe deeper into this area and to do so in a 
standardized and methodologically optimal manner. The ultimate objective of this 
line of research is to inform both doctors and patients more precisely about the 
cognitive effects they can expect from treatment. This study is expected to 
improve the quality of decision-making and maximize clinical outcomes for each 
individual patient.

Human life expectancy is increasing faster lately and, consequently, the number 
of patients with age-related diseases such as type 2 diabetes (T2D) is rising 
every year. Cases of hyperinsulinemia have been extensively reported in elderly 
subjects and this alteration in blood insulin concentration is postulated to be 
a cause of insulin resistance, which in some cases triggers T2D onset. Thus, it 
is important to know the underlying mechanisms of age-dependent hyperinsulinemia 
to find new strategies to prevent T2D in elderly subjects. Two processes control 
blood insulin concentration: Insulin secretion by the endocrine portion of the 
pancreas and insulin clearance, which occurs mainly in the liver by the action 
of the insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE). Here, we demonstrated that 10-month-old 
mice (old) display increased body and fat pad weight, compared with 3-month-old 
mice (control), and these alterations were accompanied by glucose and insulin 
intolerance. We also confirm hyperinsulinemia in the old mice, which was related 
to increased insulin secretion but not to reduced insulin clearance. Although no 
changes in insulin clearance were observed, IDE activity was lower in the liver 
of old compared with the control mice. However, this decreased IDE activity was 
compensated by increased expression of IDE protein in the liver, thus explaining 
the similar insulin clearance observed in both groups. In conclusion, at the 
beginning of aging, 10-month-old mice do not display any alterations in insulin 
clearance. Therefore, hyperinsulinemia is initiated primarily due to a higher 
insulin secretion in the age-related metabolic dysfunction in mice.

OBJECTIVES: to evaluate socioeconomic inequalities in mortality by educational 
level in Italy.
DESIGN: cohort study based on the record linkage between the 2012-2014 archives 
of mortality and the 2011 Italian population Census.
SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Italian population registered in the 2011 Census.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: life expectancy by educational level, age-standardized 
mortality rates, mortality rate ratios (MRRs) for overall mortality, and 12 
groups of causes of death.
RESULTS: life expectancy at birth was 80.3 years among men and 84.9 among women. 
High-educated men were expected to live 3 years longer than lower educated men, 
while the gap was narrower in women (1.5 years). Lower educated men had a higher 
mortality from any cause (MRR: 1.34; 95%CI 1.33-1.35) with larger differentials 
for lung, upper aerodigestive, and liver cancers, respiratory system diseases, 
AIDS and accidents. Socioeconomic inequalities were larger in the North-West of 
the Country for lung and liver cancer. Educational inequalities were smaller 
among women for all-cause mortality, but remarkably larger for circulatory 
system diseases (MRR: 1.40; 95%CI 1.38-1.42), particularly in the South (MRR: 
1.46; 95%CI 1.42-1.50).
CONCLUSIONS: this study documented socioeconomic inequalities in mortality in 
Italy for many causes of death; some of them resulted heterogeneous by area of 
residence. Most of the inequalities can be counteracted with specific measures 
aimed to improve behavioural risk factors among less educated people.

Overgrowth syndromes are rare genetic disorders characterized by excessive pre- 
and postnatal growth accompanied by dysmorphic features and developmental 
disorders. In addition to other health hazards, the life expectancy of affected 
children may be compromised due to an increased risk of developing tumors. To 
demonstrate the need for early recognition, correct diagnostic evaluation and 
adequate follow-up, we present a family with recurrent Simpson-Golabi-Behmel 
syndrome (SGBS). SGBS is a X-linked neonatal overgrowth syndrome caused by 
mutations in the GPC3 or GPC4 genes. All three affected males manifested with 
congenital diaphragmatic hernia. When fetal overgrowth and congenital 
diaphragmatic hernia co-occur, the choice for a possible cause is limited among 
SGBS, Marfan syndrome and Pallister-Killian syndrome. Their different phenotypes 
allow clinical assessment and correct diagnosis in most cases and should be 
followed by genetic testing. Regular oncologic screening aimed towards early 
recognition of malignant tumors may improve long-term outcomes in SGBS as well 
as in all other overgrowth syndromes.

BACKGROUND: Restoration of shoulder function is an important treatment goal in 
upper brachial plexus injury (UBPI). Combined dual motor nerve transfer (CDNT) 
of spinal accessory to suprascapular and radial to axillary nerves demonstrates 
good functional recovery with minimal risk of perioperative complications.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of CDNT vs alternative operative 
and nonoperative treatments for UBPI.
METHODS: A decision model was constructed to evaluate costs ($, third-party 
payer) and effectiveness (quality-adjusted life years [QALYs]) of CDNT compared 
to glenohumeral arthrodesis (GA), conservative management, and nontreatment 
strategies. Estimates for branch probabilities, costs, and QALYs were derived 
from published studies. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER, $/QALY) 
were calculated to compare the competing strategies. One-way, 2-way, and 
probabilistic sensitivity analyses with 100 000 iterations were performed to 
account for effects of uncertainty in model inputs.
RESULTS: Base case model demonstrated CDNT effectiveness, yielding an expected 
21.04 lifetime QALYs, compared to 20.89 QALYs with GA, 19.68 QALYs with 
conservative management, and 19.15 QALYs with no treatment. The ICERs for CDNT, 
GA, and conservative management vs nontreatment were $5776.73/QALY, $10 
483.52/QALY, and $882.47/QALY, respectively. Adjusting for potential income 
associated with increased likelihood of returning to work after clinical 
recovery demonstrated CDNT as the dominant strategy, with ICER = -$56 
459.54/QALY relative to nontreatment. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed 
CDNT cost-effectiveness at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $50 000/QALY in 
78.47% and 81.97% of trials with and without income adjustment, respectively. 
Conservative management dominated in <1% of iterations.
CONCLUSION: CDNT and GA are cost-effective interventions to restore shoulder 
function in patients with UBPI.

Betalains are nitrogenous plant pigments known for their high antioxidant 
capacity. For the first time, this antioxidant nature has been studied in an in 
vivo system using the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans. The oxidative 
stress caused in the fluorescent strain TJ375 (hsp-16.2::GFP) was reversed by 
the presence of both natural and semi-synthetic betalains, with an ED50 value 
around 25 μM for betacyanins and up to 10 μM for betaxanthins, with 
indicaxanthin, the major pigments in prickly pear fruits, as the most effective 
betalain. The effect of model betalains on the lifespan of the wild-type N2 
strain was carefully studied using the automatic platform "Lifespan Machine". In 
a search for different approaches to suppress progeny, pop-1 RNAi was used to 
avoid FUdR use. The presence of betalains in the medium, both as pure compounds 
and as enriched Opuntia extracts significantly increased the lifespan of C. 
elegans.

The current knowledge about the effect of pCO2-driven ocean acidification on the 
bioaccumulation of pollutants in marine species is still scarce, as only limited 
types of pollutants have been investigated. Therefore, to obtain a better 
understanding of the effect of ocean acidification on the process of 
bioaccumulation and subsequent food safety, the accumulation of benzo[a]pyrene 
(B[a]P), chloramphenicol (CAP), and nitrofurazone (NFZ) in an edible bivalve 
species, Tegillarca granosa, under present and near-future ocean acidification 
scenarios was investigated in the present study. The health risks associated 
with consuming contaminated blood clams were also assessed using target hazard 
quotient (THQ), lifetime cancer risk (CR), or margin of exposure (MoE). To 
explain the alterations in bioaccumulation of these pollutants, the expressions 
of genes encoding corresponding key metabolic proteins were analyzed as well. 
The results obtained showed that ocean acidification exerted a significant 
effect on the accumulation of B[a]P, NFZ, and CAP in the clams. After four-week 
exposure to B[a]P, NFZ, or CAP contaminated seawater acidified with CO2 at 
pH 7.8 and 7.4, significantly greater amounts of B[a]P and lower amounts of NFZ 
and CAP were accumulated in the clams compared to that in the control. Although 
no non-carcinogenic risk of consuming B[a]P-contaminated blood clams was 
detected using the THQ values obtained, the CR values obtained indicated a high 
life-time risk in all groups. In addition, according to the MoE values obtained, 
the health risks in terms of consuming NFZ- and CAP-contaminated clams were 
significantly reduced under ocean acidification scenarios but still cannot be 
ignored, especially for children. The gene expression results showed that the 
ability of clams to eliminate B[a]P may be significantly constrained, whereas 
the ability to eliminate NFZ and CAP may be enhanced under ocean acidification 
scenarios, indicating that the changes in the accumulation of these pollutants 
may be due to the altered in vivo metabolism.

While much is known about long-term survival after traumatic brain injury, less 
is known about survival after anoxic/hypoxic brain injury. We previously 
compared the two and found no significant difference (hazard ratio [HR] 0.97, 
p=0.92) after controlling for age, sex, and severity of disability. The present 
study updates this, based on 1,802 patients with TBI and 380 with anoxic, aged 
15 to 25, evaluated in 1986 or later, and who survived one year post injury. The 
anoxic group had higher mortality (HR = 1.13), though again the difference was 
not statistically significant (p=0.58).

Aortic intramural hematoma (IMH) is a pathologic process with a clinical 
presentation identical to aortic dissection and associated with significant 
morbidity and mortality. Radiologists must be familiar with the imaging 
appearances of IMH as computed tomography (CT) plays a critical role in both 
diagnosis and patient management. The course of IMH is variable and the process 
may regress, remain stable, or progress in extent and therefore imaging findings 
associated with a negative prognosis must be recognized and included in the 
formal radiology report. Potentially life-threatening complications and findings 
associated with IMH include hemopericardium and cardiac tamponade, coexisting 
aortic dissection, ulcer-like projection, intramural blood pool, and extension 
of hematoma along the pulmonary or coronary arteries, which are identifiable 
with aortic protocol CT. The purpose of this pictorial review is to provide the 
reader with an image-based review of the diagnostic criteria, related 
complications, and associated critical prognostic features in patients 
presenting with aortic IMH.

OBJECTIVE: Comorbid depression is associated with increased health care 
utilization and cost. We examined the effects of peer support on acute care (AC) 
and hospital utilization in individuals with diabetes with or without depressive 
symptoms.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a cluster-randomized controlled trial 
conducted in 2010-2012, with the clusters being practices and their surrounding 
communities. Adults with type 2 diabetes who wanted help with self-management 
were eligible to participate. Those without a doctor, with limited life 
expectancy, with plans to move within the next year, and with an unwillingness 
to work with a peer advisor were excluded. Intervention participants received 1 
year of peer support. Control participants received usual care. The Patient 
Health Questionnaire (PHQ-8) (range 0-24; 5 indicates mild and 10 indicates 
moderate depressive symptoms) assessed depressive symptoms. AC and hospital 
utilization were measured by self-report. Data were collected at baseline, 6 
months, and 12 months. Quasi-Poisson regression using generalized estimating 
equations examined differences in utilization per year attributable to the 
intervention for those with and without mild depressive symptoms (and 
separately, moderate depressive symptoms), controlling for imbalance across 
treatment arms.
RESULTS: At baseline, half of the sample reported mild depressive symptoms (52% 
intervention and 48% control, P = 0.37), a quarter reported moderate depressive 
symptoms (25% intervention and 26% control, P = 1.0), and there were no 
significant differences in utilization. A total of 168 intervention (six 
clusters) and 187 control (five clusters) participants had follow-up data. In 
individuals with mild depressive symptoms, the incident rate ratio (IRR) for 
hospitalization among intervention compared with control was 0.26 (95% CI 
0.08-0.84) per 10 patient-years. The IRR for AC was 0.55 (95% CI 0.28-1.07) per 
10 person-years. Findings were similar for individuals with moderate depressive 
symptoms.
CONCLUSIONS: Peer support lowered AC visits and hospitalizations for individuals 
with depressive symptoms but not for those without depressive symptoms; these 
findings can guide resource allocation for population health management.

This work proposes a method to compute the income gradient in period life 
expectancy that accounts for income mobility. Using income and mortality records 
of the Danish population over the period 1980-2013, we validate the method and 
provide estimates of the income gradient. The period life expectancy of 
individuals at a certain age, and belonging to a certain income class, is 
normally computed by using the mortality of older cohorts in the same income 
class. This approach does not take into account that a substantial fraction of 
the population moves away from their original income class, which leads to an 
upward bias in the estimation of the income gradient in life expectancy. For 
40-y-olds in the bottom 5% of the income distribution, the risk of dying before 
age 60 is overestimated by 25%. For the top 5% income class, the risk of dying 
is underestimated by 20%. By incorporating a classic approach from the social 
mobility literature, we provide a method that predicts income mobility and 
future mortality simultaneously. With this method, the association between 
income and life expectancy is lower throughout the income distribution. Without 
accounting for income mobility, the estimated difference in life expectancy 
between persons in percentiles 20 and 80 in the income distribution is 4.6 y for 
males and 4.1 y for females, while it is only half as big when accounting for 
mobility. The estimated rise in life-expectancy inequality over time is also 
halved when accounting for income mobility.

BACKGROUND: Alternative methods of accessing the internet and performing 
computing-related work tasks are becoming common, e.g., using tablets or 
standing workstations. Few studies examine postural differences while using 
these alternative methods.
OBJECTIVE: To assess neck and upper limb kinematics while using a tablet, laptop 
and desktop computer (sitting and standing).
METHODS: Differences in neck flexion/extension, lateral flexion, rotation; elbow 
flexion/extension; wrist flexion/extension, radial/ulnar deviation; and shoulder 
elevation in 30 participants were assessed in four conditions, three in sitting 
(tablet, laptop and desktop computer) and one in standing (desktop computer). 
Three-dimensional motion capture recorded posture variables during an editing 
task. Differences between variables were determined using one-way ANOVA with 
Bonferroni post-hoc tests.
RESULTS: Compared to the desktop (sitting), tablet and laptop use resulted in 
increased neck flexion (mean difference tablet 16.92°, 95% CI 12.79-21.04; 
laptop 10.92, 7.86-13.97, P < 0.001) and shoulder elevation (right; tablet 
10.29, 5.27-15.11; laptop 7.36, 3.72-11.01, P < 0.001). There were no meaningful 
posture differences between the sitting and standing desktop.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that using a tablet or laptop may increase 
neck flexion, potentially increasing posture strain. Regular users of 
tablets/laptops should consider adjustments in their posture, however, further 
research is required to determine whether posture adjustments prevent or reduce 
musculoskeletal symptoms.

The current epidemic of type 2 diabetes (T2D) represents a significant global 
and national health concern. Globally, the prevalence of diabetes has doubled 
between 1980 and 2014. In 2014 the World Health Organization estimated that 
there were 422 million adults living with diabetes worldwide. In the USA, the 
number of people diagnosed with T2D is estimated to increase to over 70 million 
by 2050, putting an immense strain on the US healthcare system. Achieving 
glycemic control is widely acknowledged as the key goal of treatment in T2D and 
is critical for reducing the onset and progression of diabetes-related 
complications such as cardiovascular diseases, neuropathies, retinopathies, and 
nephropathies. Despite the increase in the availability of antihyperglycemic 
medications and evidence-based treatment guidelines, the proportion of people 
with T2D who fail to achieve glycemic goals continues to rise. One major 
contributor is a delay in treatment intensification despite suboptimal glycemic 
control, referred to as clinical or therapeutic inertia. Clinical inertia 
prolongs the duration of patients' hyperglycemia which subsequently puts them at 
increased risk of diabetes-associated complications and reduced life expectancy. 
Clinical inertia results from a complex interaction between patient, healthcare 
providers, and healthcare system barriers that need to be addressed together, 
rather than as separate entities. In this article we provide an overview of 
clinical inertia in the clinical management of T2D and provide suggestions for 
overcoming aspects that may have a negative impact on patient care.Funding:

Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is a highly infectious pathogen, which affects 
the respiratory tract, reproductive system, and kidney of chickens. Many 
different genotypes of IBV are recognized which cause different clinical 
manifestations. According to the antigenic differences, different serotypes of 
the virus do not cross-protect. Massachusetts serotype induces the best 
cross-protection against other serotypes. Recently, the IBV QX genotype has been 
detected in Iran. QX genotype causes permanent damage to the oviduct in layer 
and breeder flock if it occurs in the early life cycle. In this study, we 
compared two vaccination program using 793/B type and Massachusetts type 
vaccine. One-day-old SPF chickens were divided into four groups. Groups 1 and 2 
were unvaccinated groups. Group 3 was vaccinated with the H120 vaccine at day 1 
and 793/B at day 14 (eye drop), and group 4 was vaccinated with H120+793/B (eye 
drop) on the first day and 793/B at day 14. Groups 2, 3, and 4 challenged 
(oculonasal) with QX genotype (104 EID50) at day 35. Five days post challenge, 
the sample were clollected for ciliostasis test, histopathology, and 
quantitative real-time RT-PCR from trachea, lung, and kidneys. Results showed 
that two vaccination programs created more than 80% of protection against 
challenge virus, but no significant difference was recorded between two 
programs. Based on our results, it can be concluded that vaccination with two 
mixed vaccines (H120+793/B) on the first day of the life of a chick does not 
make any difference in comparison to single vaccine (H120) in reducing of 
pathological damages and viral load. As long as the second vaccination against 
IB may not be applied properly in farm situation, applying the mixture of 793/B 
type vaccine with H120 at day 1 (ocular or spray) may help to increase 
vaccination program efficacy.

OBJECTIVES: Although not licensed for acute bipolar depression, lamotrigine has 
evidence for efficacy in trials and its use is recommended in guidelines. So far 
there had been no prospective health economic evaluation of its use.
METHODS: Cost-utility analysis of the CEQUEL trial comparing quetiapine plus 
lamotrigine vs quetiapine monotherapy (and folic acid vs placebo in an add-on 
factorial design) for patients with bipolar depression (n = 201) from the health 
and social care perspective. Differences in costs together with quality-adjusted 
life years (QALYs) between the groups were assessed over 52 weeks using a 
regression-based approach.
RESULTS: Health-related quality of life improved substantially for all 
randomization groups during follow-up with no significant difference in QALYs 
between any of the comparisons (mean adjusted QALY difference: lamotrigine vs 
placebo -0.001 (95% CI: -0.05 to 0.05), folic acid vs placebo 0.002 (95% CI: 
-0.05 to 0.05)). While medication costs in the lamotrigine group were higher 
than in the placebo group (£647, P < 0.001), mental health community/outpatient 
costs were significantly lower (-£670, P < 0.001). Mean total costs were similar 
in the groups (-£180, P = 0.913).
CONCLUSIONS: Lamotrigine improved clinical ratings in bipolar depression 
compared with placebo. This differential effect was not detected using the 
EQ-5D-3L. The additional cost of lamotrigine was balanced by significant savings 
in some other medical costs which made its use cost neutral to the health 
service. Compared to placebo, folic acid produced neither clinical nor 
significant health economic benefits. The study supports the use of lamotrigine 
in combination with other drugs to treat bipolar depression.

Endometrial carcinoma is one of the most frequent women cancer. Its incidence is 
increasing due to the aging of the population and changes in life. Fortunately, 
these cancers are usually detected at an early stage due to post-menopausal 
bleeding. The prognostic factors are quite well determined : loco-regional and 
distant tumoral extension according to the FIGO classification, grade and 
histological type and the presence of lympho-vascular space invasions. These 
cancers, however, are usually of good prognosis because of an early diagnosis, 
and their treatment is based on surgery, preferably minimally invasive approach, 
whose extension is adapted to the prognostic factors from the pre-therapeutic 
assessment. The definitive histological examination will condition the adjuvant 
treatments.

OBJECTIVE: The ECHELON-1 trial demonstrated efficacy and safety of brentuximab 
vedotin plus doxorubicin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine (A + AVD) vs doxorubicin, 
bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine (ABVD) as frontline therapy for stage 
III/IV classical Hodgkin lymphoma. This analysis evaluated the 
cost-effectiveness of A + AVD from a US healthcare payer perspective.
METHODS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), defined as the 
incremental costs per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained, was estimated 
using a non-homogenous semi-Markov cohort model with health states defined on 
progression following frontline treatment, and for those with progression, 
receipt of autologous stem-cell transplant (ASCT), and progression after ASCT. 
Patients undergoing ASCT were classified as refractory or relapsed based on 
timing of progression. Probabilities of progression/death with frontline therapy 
were based on parametric survival distributions fit to data on modified 
progression-free survival (mPFS) from ECHELON-1. Duration of frontline treatment 
and incidence of adverse events were from ECHELON-1. Utility values for patients 
in the frontline mPFS state were based on EQ-5D data from ECHELON-1. Other 
inputs were from published sources. A lifetime time horizon was used. Costs and 
QALYs were discounted at 3%. Analyses were conducted alternately using data on 
mPFS for the overall and North American populations of ECHELON-1.
RESULTS: The ICER for A + AVD vs ABVD was $172,074/QALY gained in the analysis 
using data on mPFS for the overall population and $69,442/QALY gained in the 
analysis using data on mPFS for the North American population of ECHELON-1. The 
ICER is sensitive to estimated costs of ASCT and frontline failure.
CONCLUSION: The ICER for A + AVD vs ABVD based on ECHELON-1 is within the range 
of threshold values for cost-effectiveness in the US. A + AVD is, therefore, 
likely to be a cost-effective frontline therapy for patients with stage III/IV 
classical Hodgkin lymphoma from a US healthcare payer perspective.

Aging and aging-associated diseases: a microRNA-based endocrine regulation 
hypothesis.

Umansky S(1).

Author information:
(1)DiamiR Biosciences, Monmouth Junction, NJ 08852, USA.

Although there are numerous hypotheses explaining the nature of aging and 
associated processes, two concepts are dominant: (i) aging is a result of 
cell-autonomous processes, such as the accumulation of DNA mutations, aberrant 
methylations, protein defects, and shortening of telomeres, leading to either 
inhibition of cellular proliferation and death of non-dividing terminally 
differentiated cells or tumor development; (ii) aging is a result of a central 
program that is switched on at a specific stage of organismic development. The 
microRNA-based endocrine regulation hypothesis combines the two above concepts 
by proposing central regulation of cell death occurrences via 
hypothalamus-pituitary gland (PG)-secreted miRNA hormones, the expression and/or 
secretion of which are regulated by sex hormones. This hypothesis explains such 
well-known phenomena as inverse comorbidity of either cancer or Alzheimer's (AD) 
and other neurodegenerative diseases; higher AD morbidity and lower frequency of 
many common types of cancer in women vs. men; higher risk of early AD and lower 
risk of cancer in subjects with Down syndrome; longer life expectancy in women 
vs. men and much lower sex-dependent differences, if any, in other mammals; 
increased lifespans due to hypophysectomy or PG hypofunction; and parabiotic 
effects of blood or plasma transfusions between young and old animals.

BACKGROUND: The life table is a useful instrument to measure the impact of 
health care in a population. In this case we report the situation of the 
population that use the medical services of the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro 
Social in the state of Jalisco.
METHODS: We used the abridged Reed-Merrell method, which shows the life 
expectancy in five-year age groups.
RESULTS: In 2015 life expectancy for people with hospital insurance was 80.51 
for women and 77.93 for men. For the total of insured women and men, life 
expectancy was 77.65 and 73.73 years, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Compared with previous calculations, we observed a deceleration of 
the gain of life expectancy in both sexes, even though women keep more life 
expectancy than men.

BACKGROUND: Randomized controlled trials ("randomized trials") can provide 
evidence to assess the equity impact of an intervention. Decision makers need to 
know about equity impacts of healthcare interventions so that people get 
healthcare that is best for them. To better understand the equity impacts of 
healthcare interventions, a range of people who were potentially the ultimate 
users of research results were involved in a six-phase project to extend the 
CONsolidated Standards Of Reporting Trials Statement for health equity 
("CONSORT-Equity 2017"). We identified these "knowledge users" as: patients and 
healthcare researchers, decision makers and providers. This paper reports on one 
project phase: specifically, a qualitative study designed to integrate the 
expertise of knowledge users. The experiences and perspectives of knowledge 
users provided many insights about the reporting of health equity issues in 
randomized trials. This paper describes key informant interviews with knowledge 
users that contribute to a better understanding of the effects of an 
intervention on health equity. Additionally, the paper shows how these insights 
were used to develop CONSORT-Equity 2017.
METHODS: A qualitative study that used the framework analysis method was 
conducted in collaboration with an international study executive and advisory 
board team. In-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted with a purposive 
sample of key informants who: consider the research ethics of, fund, conduct, 
participate in, publish, or use research evidence generated in randomized 
trials. Transcripts were coded and analyzed using the seven-stage framework 
analysis method, and data reported to reflect knowledge user suggestions to 
develop CONSORT-Equity 2017.
RESULTS: Thirteen key informants, of which three were patients, chose to 
participate in interviews. Seven themes emerged: "Differentiate the type of 
trial", "Prompts for health equity", "Ethics matter", "Describe unique research 
strategies", "Clarity of reporting", "Implications of equity for sampling and 
analysis", "Think beyond the immediate trial". The interviews provided direction 
for the extension of 16 CONSORT-Equity 2017 items.
CONCLUSIONS: Key informant interviews were used to identify new concepts that 
were not generated in our other studies and to develop CONSORT-Equity 2017. We 
encourage the use of key informant interviews in guideline development to obtain 
and include the real-life expertise of knowledge users.
