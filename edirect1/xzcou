Habitat selection and extension of the area used by a given species may vary 
during different phases of its life and are often determined by the distribution 
and availability of resources throughout the landscape, such as food, breeding 
sites, and shelters. In this study, we assessed the influence of body size on 
the areas used by 21 individuals of the yellow-footed tortoises (Chelonoidis 
denticulatus) from January to June 2017 in a dense rain forest area in Central 
Amazonia. We also investigated whether individuals selected different ranges of 
terrain slope, elevation, areas with high food availability, or areas with 
treefall gaps that could be used for shelter or thermoregulation. We monitored 
tortoise movements using thread-bobbins, and sampled terrain characteristics, 
availability of potential food resources and forest gaps along the routes used 
by the tortoises. We also measured the same variables in plots distributed 
systematically throughout the study area to evaluate resource availability. 
Tortoises used an average area of 1.56 ha (SD = 1.51, min = 0.03, max = 6.44). 
The size of the area used was positively associated with the individual body 
size, but did not vary between sexes. Small individuals selected higher and 
flatter areas where the availability of fallen flowers was higher, whereas the 
area used by larger individuals did not differ from the natural availability of 
topographic traits and food in the region. Although tortoises did not select 
areas according to availability of tree-fall gaps, most larger tortoises were 
found sheltered under fallen trees (85%). Conversely, small individuals were 
mainly found hidden under litter (66%). Body size determined the patterns of 
landscape use by tortoises; larger individuals were mainly generalists, but 
small individuals occupied high and flat areas. The yellow-footed tortoise is 
endangered by hunting, illegal collection for the pet trade, habitat destruction 
and effects of climate change. Size-related differences in habitat selection 
should be taken into account in species-distribution models for the 
identification of suitable areas for reintroduction and the development of 
management plans in protected areas.

CONTEXT: Stability of patients' treatment preferences has important implications 
for decisions about concurrent and future treatment.
OBJECTIVES: To examine the stability of treatment preferences and correlates 
among patients with advanced cancer.
METHODS: In this cohort, 104 patients with metastatic cancer, progression after 
at least one chemotherapy regimen, and an oncologist-estimated life expectancy 
of six or fewer months participated in structured interviews after clinical 
visits in which patients' recent scan results were discussed. Interviews were 
repeated in three monthly follow-ups. At baseline, patients' age, education, 
sex, race, marital status, insurance status, and type of cancer were documented. 
At each assessment, patients reported their treatment preferences (i.e., 
prioritizing life-prolonging vs. comfort), quality of life, and current health 
status.
RESULTS: At baseline (n = 104), 55 (53%) patients preferred life-prolonging care 
and 49 (47%) preferred comfort care. Patients were followed up for one 
(n = 104), two (n = 74), or three months (n = 44). Between baseline and Month 1, 
84 patients (81%) had stable preferences. During follow-up, preferences of 71 
patients (68%) remained stable (equally divided between a consistent preference 
for life-prolonging and comfort care). Treatment preferences of 33 (32%) 
patients changed at least once during follow-up. Direction of change was 
inconsistent. Patients' preferences at baseline strongly predicted preferences 
at Month 1 (odds ratio = 17.8; confidence interval = 6.7-47.3; P < .001). 
Description of the current health status at baseline was the only variable 
significantly associated with stability of preferences at Month 1.
CONCLUSION: Two-thirds of patients with advanced cancer had stable preferences. 
Changes of preferences were often inconsistent and unpredictable. Our findings 
suggest potential benefits of ongoing communication about preferences.

Telomeres and telomerase provide a unique and important avenue of study in 
improving both life expectancy and quality of life due to their close 
association with aging and disease. While major advances in our understanding of 
these two biological mediators have characterized the last two decades, previous 
studies have been limited by the inability to affect change in real time within 
living cells. The last three years, however, have witnessed a huge step forward 
to overcome this limitation. The advent of the clustered regularly interspaced 
short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated (CRISPR/Cas) system has led to a 
wide array of targeted genetic studies that are already being employed to modify 
telomeres and telomerase, as well as the genes that affect them. In this review, 
we analyze studies utilizing the technology to target and modify telomeres, 
telomerase, and their closely associated genes. We also discuss how these 
studies can provide insight into the biology and mechanisms that underlie aging, 
cancer, and other diseases.

Disability adjusted life years (DALYs) have been used since the 1990s. It is a 
composite measure of years of life lost with years lived with disability. 
Essentially, one DALY is the equivalent of a year of healthy life lost if a 
person had not experienced disease. Norovirus is the most common cause of 
gastrointestinal diseases worldwide. Norovirus activity varies from one season 
to the next for reasons not fully explained. Infection with norovirus is 
generally not severe, and is normally characterized as mild and self-limiting 
with no long-term sequelae. In this study, we model a range of estimates of 
DALYs for community cases of norovirus in England and Wales. We estimated a 
range of DALYs for norovirus to account for mixing of the severity of disease 
and the range of length of illness experienced by infected people. Our estimates 
were between 1159 and 4283 DALYs per year, or 0.3⁻1.2 years of healthy life lost 
per thousand cases of norovirus. These estimates provide evidence that norovirus 
leads to a considerable level of ill health in England and Wales. This 
information will be helpful should candidate norovirus vaccines become available 
in the future.

BACKGROUND: Comorbid psychological distress (i.e. insomnia and depression) is 
experienced by 20-40% of patients with cardiovascular disease. This has a 
considerable impact on their health and quality of life, leading to frequent 
re-hospitalisations, higher healthcare costs and a shorter life expectancy. 
Internet-based cognitive behavioural therapy shows great potential for treating 
psychological distress in cardiovascular disease. Effective and feasible 
treatments can, however, only benefit patients if they are fully implemented in 
clinical care.
AIM: This scoping review aimed to explore the literature for internet-based 
cognitive behavioural therapy in cardiovascular disease and for strategies to 
implement the intervention.
METHODS: We searched electronic databases, journals and internet sources to find 
original studies about internet-based cognitive behavioural therapy in 
cardiovascular disease, adhering to scoping methodology guidelines. After 
identifying 267 titles, we screened 40 abstracts and chose 11 full-text articles 
for full-text screening. The results sections in four articles were searched for 
outcomes that related to the effectiveness and implementation of internet-based 
cognitive behavioural therapy by directed qualitative content analysis using an 
implementation framework.
RESULTS: Three of the four articles fulfilling the inclusion criteria concerned 
internet-based cognitive behavioural therapy for treating mild to moderate 
depressive symptoms in cardiovascular disease, and none focused on insomnia. The 
studies showed evidence for the effectiveness of internet-based cognitive 
behavioural therapy, and/or described patient factors influencing clinical 
effectiveness. Our qualitative content analysis showed that many implementation 
aspects and stakeholder perspectives remain unexplored.
CONCLUSIONS: Internet-based cognitive behavioural therapy promises to alleviate 
patient suffering in cardiovascular disease. There is, however, little research 
about internet-based cognitive behavioural therapy for cardiovascular disease, 
and about how this evidence-based intervention is implemented.

Although cost-effectiveness analysis has a long tradition of supporting 
healthcare decision-making in Sweden, there are no clear criteria for when an 
intervention is considered too expensive. In particular, the opportunity cost of 
healthcare resource use in terms of health forgone has not been investigated 
empirically. In this work, we therefore seek to estimate the marginal cost of a 
life year in Sweden's public healthcare sector using time series and panel data 
at the national and regional levels, respectively. We find that estimation using 
time series is unfeasible due to reversed causality. However, through panel 
instrumental variable estimation we are able to derive a marginal cost per life 
year of about SEK 370,000 (EUR 39,000). Although this estimate is in line with 
emerging evidence from other healthcare systems, it is associated with 
uncertainty, primarily due to the inherent difficulties of causal inference 
using aggregate observational data. The implications of these difficulties and 
related methodological issues are discussed.

Food processing techniques are inevitable technological measures that aim to 
increase and sustain the quality of agricultural products. This is traditionally 
achieved by the application of heat or exposure to chemicals. Since the advent 
of X-rays, food scientists have been evaluating the prospect of employing 
ionising radiations for pest removal, sprouting inhibition and shelf-life 
extension of food products. Gamma radiation, electron beam and X-rays have 
emerged as the favoured methods of food irradiation in recent years. Several 
decades of research have endeavoured to determine the advantage and disadvantage 
of subjecting food materials to radiation. This has resulted in several 
international bodies, such as WHO and FAO, certifying that food irradiation is a 
safe processing method. This review article provides an insight of the various 
effects of irradiation on food with respect to nutritional quality, shelf-life 
extension, toxicological aspects, legislation pertaining to food irradiation and 
global acceptability.

INTRODUCTION: There exists a knowledge gap about the specific needs and 
utilisation of healthcare services by people with young-onset dementia (YOD), 
defined as being diagnosed before the patient is 65 years of age. Palliative 
care for dementia has received increasing attention, yet those with YOD have 
been overlooked.
OBJECTIVE: To explore healthcare utilisation, including at end-of-life, of 
people with YOD in Ireland, using hospital electronic records for case finding.
METHOD: We obtained Hospital In-Patient Enquiry data identifying all people with 
YOD admitted to three large urban hospitals between 2009 and 2016, and conducted 
a retrospective chart review. Information collected included demographics, 
medical and psychosocial history, functional capacity, last hospital admission, 
mortality and details regarding an advance care plan (ACP), using a standardised 
extraction form.
RESULTS: Of the 121 patients identified, 50% were male. The commonest dementia 
types were: dementia secondary to Down's syndrome (16%), vascular (14%), 
frontotemporal (13%) and Alzheimer's disease (13%). 88% had ≥1 comorbid disease, 
including neurological (55%), cardiovascular (36%), and mental health illnesses 
(29%). Although 70% of people with YOD had an indication for an ACP (i.e. one or 
more markers of limited life expectancy), only 11% had any ACP recorded. 37% of 
patients had died, most commonly due to a complication of advanced dementia 
(e.g. aspiration pneumonia) rather than comorbid illness.
CONCLUSION: People with YOD most commonly die from complications of dementia, as 
opposed to people with late-onset dementia, who often die with dementia. 
Advanced care planning appears to be suboptimal in people with YOD. More 
research is essential to inform future policies and services for this often 
neglected population.

OBJECTIVE: To compare the outcomes of MitraClip and surgical mitral repair in 
low-intermediate risk elderly patients affected by degenerative mitral 
regurgitation (DMR).
METHODS: We retrospectively selected patients aged ≥75 years, with Society of 
Thoracic Surgeons Predicted Risk Of Mortality (STS-PROM) <8%, submitted to 
MitraClip (n = 100) or isolated surgical repair (n = 206) for DMR at 2 centers 
between January 2005 and May 2017. To adjust for baseline imbalances, we used a 
propensity score model for average treatment effect on survival.
RESULTS: After weighting, MitraClip showed fewer postoperative complications 
(P < .05) but increased residual mitral regurgitation (MR) ≥2 (27.0% vs 2.8%, 
P < .001) compared with surgery. One-year survival was greater after MitraClip 
compared with surgery (97.6% vs 95.3%, hazard ratio [HR], 0.09; confidence 
interval [CI], 0.02-0.37, P = .001), whereas 5-year survival was lower (34.5% vs 
82.2% respectively, HR, 4.12; CI, 2.31-7.34, P < .001). Greater STS-PROM (HR, 
1.18; CI, 1.12-1.24, P < .001) and MR ≥3+ recurrence (HR, 2.18; CI, 1.07-4.48, 
P = .033) were associated with reduced survival. 5-year MR ≥3+ was more frequent 
after MitraClip compared with surgery: 36.9% versus 3.9%, odds ratio, 11.4; CI, 
4.40-29.68, P < .001.
CONCLUSIONS: In elderly patients affected by DMR and STS-PROM <8%, the average 
effect of MitraClip resulted in lower acute postoperative complications and 
improved 1-year survival compared with surgery. However, MitraClip was 
associated with greater MR recurrence and reduced survival beyond 1 year. 
Long-term survival was impaired by patients' greater risk profile and MR 
recurrence. Early results are promising, but in the setting of operable patients 
with life expectancy beyond 1 year, the quality bar for transcatheter mitral 
repair needs to be raised.

BACKGROUND: The worldwide increase of human life expectancy and the rapid aging 
of the population will contribute to an increasing prevalence of chronic 
illness. Even so, individuals who reach very advanced ages often postpone or 
escape age-related diseases that are common causes of death.
OBJECTIVE: This article aims to examine health-related characteristics of two 
distinct samples of Portuguese centenarians (one predominantly rural - PR vs. 
one predominantly urban - PU), and explore potential dissimilarities in their 
morbidity profiles and use of health care services.
METHODS: A total of 241 centenarians were considered. Sociodemographic 
characteristics, health status, and use of health care services were assessed by 
semi-structured interviews with the centenarians and their proxies (family or 
formal caregiver).
RESULTS: A higher average of 4.80 self-reported illnesses (sd = 2.01) were found 
in the PU sample (vs. 2.96; sd = 1.77 in the PR sample); in overall the PR 
sample presented a better health condition with lower levels of physical and 
mental impairments, and a greater number of centenarians who did not succumb to 
the three most common lethal diseases (heart disease, non-skin cancer and 
stroke) in the elderly population (85.4% vs. 60% in the PU sample).
CONCLUSIONS: Portuguese centenarians experienced a substantial number of 
illnesses, but an overall better health status was found in centenarians from 
the PR area. By providing distinctive health-related profiles, our findings 
suggest the importance of contextual factors in shaping how very advanced ages 
may be achieved.

With efficacious behavioral, biomedical, and structural interventions available, 
combination implementation strategies are being implemented to combat HIV/AIDS 
across settings internationally. However, priority statements from national and 
international bodies make it unclear whether the objective should be the 
reduction in HIV incidence or the maximization of health, most commonly measured 
with quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Building off a model-based evaluation 
of HIV care interventions in British Columbia, Canada, we compare the optimal 
sets of interventions that would be identified using HIV infections averted, and 
QALYs as the primary outcome in a cost-effectiveness analysis. We found an 
explicit focus on averting new infections undervalues the health benefits 
derived from antiretroviral therapy, resulting in suboptimal and potentially 
harmful funding recommendations.

Hypertension increases the risk of premature death and reduces work 
productivity. We estimated the burden of hypertension in Australia in terms of 
productivity lost over the working lifetime of the Australian population. Life 
table models were used to estimate excess mortality, years of life lost, and 
productivity-adjusted life years lost among Australians with hypertension and of 
working age (20 to 69 years), with simulated follow-up until age 70 years. In 
2017, an estimated 4.1 million working-age Australians (25.9%) had hypertension, 
of whom an estimated 21.6% were treated and controlled, 17.0% were treated but 
uncontrolled, and 61.4% were untreated. With simulated follow-up, over 149 846 
excess deaths leading to a loss of over 548 794 years of life were predicted to 
occur in the hypertension cohort. Hypertension also caused the loss of 609 801 
productivity-adjusted life years (2.4%), equating to AUD$137.2 billion in lost 
gross domestic product over the working lifetime. A 25% reduction in 
hypertension prevalence, in line with the World Health Organisation Global 
Action Plan targets, would lead to 155 450 productivity-adjusted life years 
saved over the working lifetime, whereas the adequate treatment and control of 
all of those with hypertension would lead to 342 538 productivity-adjusted life 
years saved. This equates to AUD$34.3 billion and $76.4 billion in gross 
domestic product retained over the working lifetime of the cohort, respectively. 
Our findings highlight the considerable economic burden of hypertension in 
Australia and that effective strategies aimed at the prevention and adequate 
control of hypertension are likely to pay significant economic dividends for 
individuals, employers, and governments in the longer term.

Hereditary Hemochromatosis (HH) is an autosomal recessive genetic disease, 
characterized by an excessively increased absorption of dietary iron. Excess 
iron can be accumulated because of the lack of an effective excretory mechanism 
leading to toxic effects. HH is one of the most common genetic disorders in 
individuals of European descent. Genetic polymorphisms of the HFE gene 
(rs1800562, rs1799945 and rs1800730) also affect the normal activity of another 
protein, hepcidin, a negative regulator of iron homeostasis. If left untreated, 
hereditary hemochromatosis can lead to morbidity and eventually death. Clinical 
onset hereditary hemochromatosis symptoms occur more frequently in adult men 
than women, as the monthly loss of iron due to menstruation in women slows down 
accumulation and the symptoms usually start appearing after menopause. 
Therapeutic phlebotomy is the primary form of treatment for this disease so far, 
combined with the use of chelating agents. Orthotopic liver transplantation 
(OTL) is performed in patients with advanced cirrhosis. In order to prevent the 
progression of iron accumulation, an early detection may be achieved by 
genotypic check of the frequent mutations of the HFE. Consequently, initiation 
of treatment may take place before the development of clinical symptoms, 
particularly cirrhosis, contributing significantly in achieving normal life 
expectancy. Therefore, genotypic check is vital in order to prevent the 
development of this type of hemochromatosis.

The influenza A virus infects target cells through multivalent interactions of 
its major spike proteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), with the 
cellular receptor sialic acid (SA). HA is known to mediate the attachment of the 
virion to the cell, whereas NA enables the release of newly formed virions by 
cleaving SA from the cell. Because both proteins target the same receptor but 
have antagonistic functions, virus infection depends on a properly tuned balance 
of the kinetics of HA and NA activities for viral entry to and release from the 
host cell. Here, dynamic single-molecule force spectroscopy, based on scanning 
force microscopy, was employed to determine these bond-specific kinetics, 
characterized by the off rate koff, rupture length xβ and on rate kon, as well 
as the related free-energy barrier ΔG and the dissociation constant KD. 
Measurements were conducted using surface-immobilized HA and NA of the influenza 
A virus strain A/California/04/2009 and a novel, to our knowledge, synthetic 
SA-displaying receptor for functionalization of the force probe. Single-molecule 
force spectroscopy at force loading rates between 100 and 50,000 pN/s revealed 
most probable rupture forces of the protein-SA bond in the range of 10-100 pN. 
Using an extension of the widely applied Bell-Evans formalism by Friddle, De 
Yoreo, and co-workers, it is shown that HA features a smaller xβ, a larger koff 
and a smaller ΔG than NA. Measurements of the binding probability at increasing 
contact time between the scanning force microscopy force probe and the surface 
allow an estimation of KD, which is found to be three times as large for HA than 
for NA. This suggests a stronger interaction for NA-SA than for HA-SA. The 
biological implications in regard to virus binding to the host cell and the 
release of new virions from the host cell are discussed.

Food endogenous enzymes have impacts on color, texture and flavor of foods 
during food processing or preservation. Cold plasma is a novel non-thermal food 
processing technology, which has been extensively studied for contamination 
elimination and shelf life extension of foods. Particularly, much work has been 
reported about the effects of cold plasma on enzyme activities and alterations 
about enzymes conformational structures. It is thus necessary to understand the 
mechanisms of actions and applications of cold plasma technology in the 
conformation of food endogenous enzymes. This review focuses on the applications 
of cold plasma for the inactivation of various endogenous enzymes, including 
peroxidase, polyphenol oxidase, lysozyme, α-chymotrypsin, alkaline phosphatase, 
and pectin methylesterase. The activations of several enzymes, such as 
superoxide dismutase, catalase, and lipase, by cold plasma are also discussed. 
In addition, this review highlights the transformation of conformational 
structures including primary and spatial structures induced by chemical reactive 
species during cold plasma treatments, such as reactive oxygen species and 
reactive nitrogen species, especially, active sites consisting of prosthetic 
group and specific amino acids are demonstrated. Both extrinsic and intrinsic 
factors affecting cold plasma treatments are also described. In general, cold 
plasma exhibits the ability to activate or inactivate enzymes activities with 
affecting the conformational structures of enzyme. Further studies should be 
focused on exploration at molecular level for providing more insight on the 
interaction mechanism. In addition, equipment and process parameters of cold 
plasma operation for different fresh food products should be optimized for 
achieving appropriate control on enzyme variation and obtaining maximum 
efficiency.

Many scientific studies collect data where the response and predictor variables 
are both functions of time, location, or some other covariate. Understanding the 
relationship between these functional variables is a common goal in these 
studies. Motivated from two real-life examples, we present in this paper a 
function-on-function regression model that can be used to analyze such kind of 
functional data. Our estimator of the 2D coefficient function is the optimizer 
of a form of penalized least squares where the penalty enforces a certain level 
of smoothness on the estimator. Our first result is the Representer Theorem 
which states that the exact optimizer of the penalized least squares actually 
resides in a data-adaptive finite dimensional subspace although the optimization 
problem is defined on a function space of infinite dimensions. This theorem then 
allows us an easy incorporation of the Gaussian quadrature into the optimization 
of the penalized least squares, which can be carried out through standard 
numerical procedures. We also show that our estimator achieves the minimax 
convergence rate in mean prediction under the framework of function-on-function 
regression. Extensive simulation studies demonstrate the numerical advantages of 
our method over the existing ones, where a sparse functional data extension is 
also introduced. The proposed method is then applied to our motivating examples 
of the benchmark Canadian weather data and a histone regulation study.

Well leg compartment syndrome (WLCS) is a rare complication which can occur 
following urological, gynecological, general surgical or orthopedic surgeries 
carried out with the lower limb in the hemilithotomy position. WLCS is 
associated with significant morbidity and mortality because delay in diagnosis 
and treatment can lead to loss of function and even life-threatening 
complications. During orthopedic surgeries on a traction table, such as femoral 
nailing, the contralateral "well leg" is often placed in the hemilithotomy 
position, thus facilitating the use of fluoroscopy. This position (also named 
the Lloyd-Davis position) consists of hip flexion, abduction, external rotation 
and knee flexion. We present the cases of two teenaged patients who underwent 
femoral nailing on an extension table of a femoral fracture and developed WLCS. 
We also present a review of the literature and a discussion of the 
pathophysiology, risk factors and treatment of this condition. Clinicians need 
to be aware of the risk factors for WLCS and have high index of suspicion. 
Further studies looking at the risks, benefits and feasibility of ways to reduce 
this risk are required.

Adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) is a rare neoplasm of secretory epithelium that 
most commonly occurs in the fifth and sixth decades of life. It is characterized 
by high recurrence rates and poor response to chemotherapy, In the orbit, ACC 
usually presents as a lacrimal gland mass. We describe the rare case of a 
70-year-old woman who presented with pain during mastication and bilateral 
facial numbness in the cranial nerve V2 distribution. She was found to have 
adenoid cystic carcinoma involving the orbits bilaterally without lacrimal gland 
involvement and without a clear primary tumor. Imaging suggested that the tumor 
arose from the soft palate by extension along cranial nerves V2 and V3. The 
patient was treated with radiation therapy with some degree of radiographic 
improvement 27 months after diagnosis. This case emphasizes the importance of 
considering adenoid cystic carcinoma when evaluating orbital tumors sparing the 
lacrimal gland. We also suggest the possibility of an oropharyngeal source with 
anterograde intracranial extension in cases of putative primary orbital ACC 
without lacrimal gland involvement.

and ablation.

Small, locally restricted renal cell carcinoma less than 4 cm in size should 
ideally be removed operatively by nephron-sparing tumour enucleation (partial 
kidney resection). In an increasingly elderly population, there is a growing 
trend toward parallel incidence of renal cell carcinoma and chronic renal 
insufficiency, with the latter's associated general comorbidities. Thus, for 
some patients, the risks of the anaesthesia and operation increase, while the 
advantage in terms of survival decreases. Transcutaneous radio-frequency 
ablation under local anaesthesia, transcutaneous afterloading high-dose-rate 
brachytherapy under local anaesthesia, and percutaneous stereotactic ablative 
radiotherapy may offer a less invasive alternative therapy. Active surveillance 
is to be regarded as no more than a controlled bridging up to definitive 
treatment (operation or ablation), while watchful waiting, on account of the 
lack of prognostic relevance and the symptomatology of renal cell carcinoma, 
with its comorbidity-related, clearly reduced life expectancy, does not involve 
any further diagnostic or therapeutic measures.

Multilevel Factors Predicting Cardiac Rehabilitation Attendance and Adherence in 
Underserved Patients at a Safety-Net Hospital.

Clark, Eways, and Wilson); and Truman Medical Center, Kansas City, Missouri (Dr 
Smith, Mss Waters and Umhoefer, and Mr Bergland).

PURPOSE: This study examined multilevel factors as predictors of cardiac 
rehabilitation (CR) attendance and adherence among underserved patients at a 
safety-net hospital (SNH).
METHODS: Participants were recruited during hospitalization for a cardiac 
procedure or event. Participants responded to a questionnaire, and outcome data 
(including CR attendance and adherence) were extracted from medical records at 
baseline and 6 mo post-discharge.
RESULTS: Data were collected from 171 participants, 92 (53.8%) of whom attended 
CR. On average, participants completed 24 CR sessions (66.7% adherence) and 40 
(43.5%) participants fully adhered to the 36 prescribed sessions. Bivariate 
comparisons showed that participants who attended CR were more likely to have 
insurance (P = .002), perceive CR as important (P = .008), believe they needed 
CR (P = .005), and endorsed fewer barriers to CR (P = .005) than their 
nonattending counterparts. After controlling for insurance status, a regression 
analysis to predict attendance revealed only 1 predictor; perceived lack of time 
(P = .04). Bivariate analyses showed that only 1 clinical factor, treatment 
during hospitalization, was significantly related to adherence (P = .03). 
Patients with medical management alone (no revascularization) showed less 
adherence than their counterparts with revascularization.
CONCLUSIONS: Although access to insurance is a significant predictor of 
attendance, psychological barriers that are amenable to being addressed by CR 
staff are also important. Findings suggest that perceived lack of time is 
important in SNH patient decision making to attend CR. This psychological 
barrier is a subject on which CR staff can intervene to educate patients about 
the life expectancy increases and decreased personal health care expenditures 
because of attendance.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate cost-efficiency of rehabilitation following severe 
traumatic brain injury (TBI) and estimate the life-time savings in costs of 
care.
SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: TBI patients (n = 3578/6043) admitted to all 75 specialist 
rehabilitation services in England 2010-2018.
DESIGN: A multicenter cohort analysis of prospectively collated clinical data 
from the UK Rehabilitation Outcomes Collaborative national clinical database.
MAIN MEASURES: Primary outcomes: (a) reduction in dependency (UK Functional 
Assessment Measure), (b) cost-efficiency, measured in time taken to offset 
rehabilitation costs by savings in costs of ongoing care estimated by the 
Northwick Park Dependency Scale/Care Needs Assessment (NPDS/NPCNA), and (c) 
estimated life-time savings.
RESULTS: The mean age was 49 years (74% males). Including patients who remained 
in persistent vegetative state on discharge, the mean episode cost of 
rehabilitation was £42 894 (95% CI: £41 512, £44 235), which was offset within 
18.2 months by NPCNA-estimated savings in ongoing care costs. The mean period 
life expectancy adjusted for TBI severity was 21.6 years, giving mean net 
life-time savings in care costs of £679 776/patient (95% CI: £635 972, £722 
786).
CONCLUSIONS: Specialist rehabilitation proved highly cost-efficient for severely 
disabled patients with TBI, despite their reduced life-span, potentially 
generating over £4 billion savings in the cost of ongoing care for this 8-year 
national cohort.

Due to advances in fertility preservation options and improvements in life 
expectancy, there is growing need for fertility preservation counseling for 
women at risk for premature ovarian insufficiency. The aim of this review is to 
provide an overview of various causes of female fertility loss and to raise 
awareness for counseling women about their options for fertility preservation. 
Furthermore, for counseling of women not only at the time of gonadotoxic 
treatment but also post-treatment and also of women with other benign causes of 
increased risk for impaired fertility or premature ovarian insufficiency.
