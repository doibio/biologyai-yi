OBJECTIVES: To develop a model of the option value a therapy provides by 
enabling patients to live to see subsequent innovations and to apply the model 
to the case of nivolumab in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and non-small cell lung 
cancer (NSCLC).
STUDY DESIGN: A model of the option value of nivolumab in RCC and NSCLC was 
developed and estimated.
METHODS: Data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) cancer 
registry and published clinical trial results were used to estimate survival 
curves for metastatic cancer patients with RCC, squamous NSCLC, or nonsquamous 
NSCLC. To estimate the conventional value of nivolumab, survival with the 
pre-nivolumab standard of care was compared with survival with nivolumab 
assuming no future innovation. To estimate the option value of nivolumab, 
long-term survival trends in RCC and squamous and nonsquamous NSCLC were 
measured in SEER to forecast mortality improvements that nivolumab patients may 
live to see.
RESULTS: Compared with the previous standard of care, nivolumab extended life 
expectancy by 6.3 months in RCC, 7.5 months in squamous NSCLC, and 4.5 months in 
nonsquamous NSCLC, according to conventional methods. Accounting for expected 
future mortality trends, nivolumab patients are likely to gain an additional 1.2 
months in RCC, 0.4 months in squamous NSCLC, and 0.5 months in nonsquamous 
NSCLC. These option values correspond to 18%, 5%, and 10% of the conventional 
value of nivolumab, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Option value is important when valuing therapies like nivolumab 
that extend life in a rapidly evolving area of care.

[PRESSURE ULCER AS THE PRINCIPAL INDICATOR OF HEALTH CARE QUALITY AT NEUROLOGY 
DEPARTMENT].

[Article in Croatian]

Horvat VB, Kos M.

According to the European Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel (EPUAP) definition, 
pressure ulcer is a local skin or subcutaneous tissue damage due to the force of 
pressure or friction or their combination. Pressure ulcers have accompanied 
humans since the beginning and respective descriptions are found in the 19th 
century literature. Pressure ulcer is a major medical, social and 
health-economic problem because it is associated with a number of complications 
that require multidisciplinary approach in care and treatment. In affected 
patients, pressure ulcer causes quality of life reduction, discomforts, pain, 
emotional problems and social isolation. If the process of tissue decay is not 
halted, tissue damage will spread involving deep and wider structures, thus 
seriously compromising the patient general condition. Pressure ulcer usually 
develops at the sites of protrusions formed by lumbar spine, ischium, hip, 
ankle, knee or elbow, as well as in the areas with less developed adipose 
tissue. Any temporary or permanent immobility should be perceived as a milieu 
favoring the onset of pressure ulcer. Advances in medicine and standards of 
living in general have prolonged life expectancy, thus also increasing the 
population at risk of chronic diseases including pressure ulcer. The aim of the 
study was to determine the relationship between the length of bed-ridden 
condition and the occurrence of pressure ulcers in patients treated at 
Department of Cerebrovascular Diseases and Intensive Neurology from January 1, 
2012 until December 31, 2015. The study included patients with pressure ulcer 
verified on admission and those having developed pressure ulcer during hospital 
stay. Clinical picture of severe stroke predominated in the majority of study 
patients. Patients were divided into groups according to health care 
requirements as classified by the Croatian Chamber of Nurses. Preliminary 
results indicated the length of bed-ridden condition to be associated with the 
occurrence of chronic wounds, and thus with increased cost and length of 
hospital treatment. Therefore, health care methods and procedures should be 
focused on reduction of pressure ulcer development, quality health care, 
implementation of preventive measures, and continuous education of health care 
professionals.

[BASIC PRINCIPLES OF SURGICAL TREATMENT OF CHRONIC WOUNDS – SHARP DEBRIDEMENT].

[Article in Croatian]

Marinović M, Fumić N, Laginja S, Smokrović E, Bakota B, Bekić M, Čoklo M.

The ever improving health standards in terms of quality and more efficient 
health care result in an increase in life expectancy, thus increasing the number 
of elderly people in the population. A higher level of activity in elderly 
population leads to greater incidence of injuries, and on the other hand, there 
is an increasing number of comorbidities. Circulatory disorders, diabetes 
mellitus, metabolic imbalances, etc. and a reduced biological potential of 
tissue regeneration result in an increased number of chronic wounds that pose a 
significant health, social and economic burden on the society. These conditions 
require significant involvement of medical and non-medical staff in pre-hospital 
institutions. Significant material and other health care resources are allocated 
for the treatment of chronic wounds. These conditions result in a lower quality 
of life of patients and their families and caregivers. Debridement is a crucial 
medical procedure for the treatment of acute and chronic wounds. The result of 
debridement is removal of all barriers within and around the wound that obstruct 
physiological processes of wound healing. Debridement is a repeating process 
when indicated. There are several types of debridement, each with its advantages 
and disadvantages. The method of debridement should be determined by the 
physician or other professional trained person on the basis of wound 
characteristics and in accordance with their expertise and capabilities. In the 
same wound, we can combine different types of debridement, all with the goal of 
faster and better wound healing.

Increased life expectancy of persons living with HIV infection receiving 
antiretroviral therapy heightens the importance of preventing and treating 
chronic comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease. While guidelines have 
increasingly advocated more aggressive use of statins for low-density 
lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol reduction, it is unclear whether people with HIV, 
especially women, are receiving statins when indicated, and whether their HIV 
disease is a factor in access. We assessed the cumulative incidence of statin 
use after an indication in the Women's Interagency HIV Study (WIHS), from 2000 
to 2014. Additionally, we used weighted proportional hazards regression to 
estimate the effect of HIV serostatus on the time to initiation of a statin 
after an indication. Cumulative incidence of statin use 5 years after an 
indication was low: 38% in HIV-seropositive women and 30% in HIV-seronegative 
women. Compared to HIV-seronegative women, the weighted hazard ratio for 
initiation of a statin for HIV-seropositive women over 5 years was 0.94 [95% 
confidence interval (CI) 0.62, 1.43]. Applying the American College of 
Cardiology and the American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines increased the 
proportion of HIV-seropositive women with a statin indication from 16% to 45%. 
Clinicians treating HIV-seropositive women should consider more aggressive 
management of the dyslipidemia often found in this population.

Preserving the independence of people living with multiple sclerosis towards the 
end of life.

Costello J(1).

Social Work.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common neurological disease affecting the 
central nervous system. It has several subtypes. The condition's pathophysiology 
can involve many body systems, but there are common symptoms. Treatment is both 
conventional and unconventional, including the controversial use of medicinal 
cannabis to control pain. Diagnosis can be difficult, as a case study 
illustrates. Support services are available to patients and carers in the form 
of MS support groups. People with MS contribute towards their own sense of 
wellbeing in a number of ways, and a key feature of survivorship with MS is the 
development of a positive attitude and a sense of hope. Palliative care involves 
facilitating a good quality of life as the condition progresses into the 
advanced stages. Invariably, people with MS wish to spend their last days at 
home among their loved ones. Numerous issues arise around end-of-life care and 
the role of the nurse in providing palliative care, which includes support 
needed by lay caregivers, who are often family members.

OBJECTIVE: A microsimulation model was adapted to evaluate the 
cost-effectiveness of nalmefene combined with psychosocial support (NMF + PS) 
versus psychosocial support alone (PS). The economic impact of alcohol reduction 
using nalmefene treatment was not evaluated.
METHOD: The model simulates patient-level alcohol consumption over a 5-year time 
horizon across different treatment cohorts. Study outcomes included 
probabilities of alcohol-attributable diseases and injuries as well as deaths 
from these events. The approach used nalmefene clinical trial data, a time 
horizon of 1 and 5 years, and a U.K. societal perspective. Extensive 
deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted.
RESULTS: Compared with the PS strategy, NMF + PS was associated at Year 5 with a 
gain of 0.047 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and an additional £503, 
leading to an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of £10,613 per QALY 
gained. When compared with the strategy without treatment, NMF + PS was 
associated with a gain of 0.228 QALYs and an additional £1,795, leading to an 
ICER of £1,758 per QALY gained. The NMF + PS strategy dominated both treatment 
strategies when considering the U.K. societal perspective. Sensitivity analyses 
confirmed the robustness of the results.
CONCLUSIONS: A combination of NMF and PS was better than PS alone, considering a 
5-year time horizon and a societal perspective.

Advancements in medical science and technology, medicine and public health 
coupled with increased consciousness about nutrition and environmental and 
personal hygiene have paved the way for the dramatic increase in life expectancy 
globally in the past several decades. However, increased life expectancy has 
given rise to an increasing aging population, thus jeopardizing the 
socio-economic structure of many countries in terms of costs associated with 
elderly healthcare and wellbeing. In order to cope with the growing need for 
elderly healthcare services, it is essential to develop affordable, unobtrusive 
and easy-to-use healthcare solutions. Smart homes, which incorporate 
environmental and wearable medical sensors, actuators, and modern communication 
and information technologies, can enable continuous and remote monitoring of 
elderly health and wellbeing at a low cost. Smart homes may allow the elderly to 
stay in their comfortable home environments instead of expensive and limited 
healthcare facilities. Healthcare personnel can also keep track of the overall 
health condition of the elderly in real-time and provide feedback and support 
from distant facilities. In this paper, we have presented a comprehensive review 
on the state-of-the-art research and development in smart home based remote 
healthcare technologies.

Friend PJ(1).

Author information:

of Oxford, Churchill Hospital, Old Road, Oxford, OX3 7LE, UK.

BACKGROUND: The aim of this review is to bring pancreatic transplantation out of 
the specialist realm, informing practitioners about this important procedure, so 
that they feel better equipped to refer suitable patients for transplantation 
and manage, counsel and support when encountering them within their own 
speciality.
SOURCES OF DATA: Narrative review conducted in May 2017. OVID interface 
searching EMBASE and MEDLINE databases, using Timeframe: Inception to June 1, 
2017. Articles were assessed for clinical relevance and most up to date content 
with articles written in english as the only inclusion criteria. Other sources, 
used included conference proceedings/presentations, unpublished data from our 
institution (Oxford Transplant Centre).
AREAS OF AGREEMENT: Pancreas transplantation has evolved from an experimental 
procedure to the gold standard of care for patients with type 1 diabetes and 
uraemia. Currently, it remains the most effective method of establishing and 
maintaining euglycemia over the longer term, halting and potentially reversing 
many of the secondary complications associated with diabetes. Significant 
improvements to quality of life and better life expectancy make it in the longer 
term, a lifesaving procedure compared to waiting candidates.
AREAS OF CONTROVERSY: The future of solid organ pancreas transplantation remains 
uncertain, with extensive comorbidity and advances in alternative therapies 
makes the long-term growth of the procedure questionable.
GROWING POINTS AND AREAS TIMELY FOR DEVELOPING RESEARCH: Therapies to alleviate 
problems associated with ischaemia reperfusion injury, graft pancreatitis and 
more effective monitoring methods for detecting and treating organ rejection are 
the key areas of growth.

A long systemic half-life is key for therapeutic proteins. To that end we have 
generated serum albumin-binding designed ankyrin repeat domains. These domains 
bind serum albumin of different species with nanomolar affinities, and have 
significantly improved pharmacokinetic properties both in mouse and cynomolgus 
monkey compared to non-serum albumin-binding DARPin® domains. In addition, they 
exhibit high thermal stability and long storage stability, which is an essential 
feature for their use in drug development. Covalently linking a serum 
albumin-binding DARPin® domain to domains with other target specificities 
results in improvements of multiple orders of magnitude in exposure and terminal 
half-life, both in mouse and cynomolgus monkey. Pharmacokinetic assessment of 
such constructs revealed terminal half-life values ranging from 27 h to 80 h in 
mouse, and from 2.6 days to 20 days in cynomolgus monkey. Extrapolation by 
allometric scaling on these findings suggests terminal half-life values of 5-50 
days in human, indicating that pharmacokinetic properties in the range of 
monoclonal antibodies can be achieved with DARPin® drug candidates. Such serum 
albumin-binding DARPin® domains are thus valuable tools for the generation of 
multi-functional drugs with an extended in vivo half-life.

This study estimated the lifetime cancer risk (LCR) attributable to 
1,3-butadiene (BD) personal exposure and to other microenvironments, including 
residential home, outdoor, in-office, in-vehicle, and dining. Detailed life 
expectancy by country (WHO), inhalation rate and body weight by gender reported 
by USEPA were used for the calculation, focusing on adult population 
(25≤Age<65). LCR estimation of the adult population due to personal exposure 
exceeded the USEPA benchmark of 1×10-6 in many cities. For outdoor BD exposure, 
LCR estimations in 45 out of 175 cities/sites (sharing 26%) exceeded the USEPA 
benchmark. Out of the top 20 cities having high LCR estimations, developing 
countries contributed 19 cities, including 14, 3, 1, 1 cities in China, India, 
Chile, and Pakistan. One city in the United States was in the list due to the 
nearby industrial facilities. The LCR calculations for BD levels found in 
residential home, in-vehicle and dining microenvironments also exceeded 1×10-6 
in some cities, while LCR caused by in-office BD levels had the smallest risk. 
Four cities/regions were used for investigating source distributions to total 
LCR results because of their sufficient BD data. Home exposure contributed 
significantly to total LCR value (ranging 56% to 86%), followed by in-vehicle 
(4% to 38%) and dining (4 to 7%). Outdoor microenvironment shared highly in 
Tianjin with 6%, whereas in-office contributed from 2-3% for all cities. High 
LCR estimations found in developing countries highlighted the greater cancer 
risk caused by BD in other cities without available measurement data.

Throughout life, stem cells in the ventricular-subventricular zone generate 
neuroblasts that migrate via the rostral migratory stream (RMS) to the olfactory 
bulb, where they differentiate into local interneurons. Although progress has 
been made toward identifying extracellular factors that guide the migration of 
these cells, little is known about the intracellular mechanisms that govern the 
dynamic reshaping of the neuroblasts' morphology required for their migration 
along the RMS. In this study, we identify DOCK7, a member of the DOCK180-family, 
as a molecule essential for tangential neuroblast migration in the postnatal 
mouse forebrain. DOCK7 regulates the migration of these cells by controlling 
both leading process (LP) extension and somal translocation via distinct 
pathways. It controls LP stability/growth via a Rac-dependent pathway, likely by 
modulating microtubule networks while also regulating F-actin remodeling at the 
cell rear to promote somal translocation via a previously unrecognized myosin 
phosphatase-RhoA-interacting protein-dependent pathway. The coordinated action 
of both pathways is required to ensure efficient neuroblast migration along the 
RMS.

Obesity is associated with substantial morbidity, costs, and decreased life 
expectancy, and continues to rise worldwide. While etiological understanding is 
needed for prevention, epidemiological studies indicated that colonization with 
Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) may affect body mass index (BMI), but with 
inconsistent results. Here, we examine the relationship between H. pylori 
colonization and BMI/obesity. Cross-sectional analyses were performed in two 
independent population-based cohorts of elderly from the Netherlands and Germany 
(n = 13,044). Genetic risk scores were conducted based on genetic loci 
associated with either H. pylori colonization or BMI/obesity. We performed a 
bi-directional Mendelian randomization. Meta-analysis of cross-sectional data 
revealed no association between anti-H. pylori IgG titer and BMI, nor of H. 
pylori positivity and BMI. Anti-H. pylori IgG titer was negatively associated 
with obesity (OR 0.99972; 95% CI 0.99946-0.99997, p = 0.03) and with obesity 
classes (Beta -6.91 •10-5; 95% CI -1.38•10-4, -5.49•10-7, p = 0.048), but the 
magnitude of these effects was limited. Mendelian randomization showed no causal 
relation between H. pylori genetic risk score and BMI/obesity, nor between BMI 
or obesity genetic risk scores and H. pylori positivity. This study provides no 
evidence for a clinically relevant association between H. pylori and 
BMI/obesity.

PURPOSE: Cancer patients can be overwhelmed when being confronted with their 
diagnosis and treatment options. Such information is often provided during one 
consultation between the patient and treating clinician. In order to achieve 
optimal cancer care, there may be justification for alternative consultation 
styles. We assessed, in a sample of adult medical oncology patients, their 
preferences for (i) attending one 40-min consultation or two 20-min 
consultations and (ii) receiving written only or both written and online 
information, when making a cancer treatment decision.
METHODS: This was a cross-sectional survey using a discrete choice design of 159 
adult medical oncology patients presenting for their second or subsequent 
outpatient consultation. Participants were presented with a set of hypothetical 
scenarios and asked to indicate their most and least preferred scenario. The 
scenarios contained a caveat explaining that there would be no difference 
between the available treatment options in terms of when treatment would be 
initiated and the impact it would have on patients' life expectancy.
RESULTS: One hundred forty-seven patients completed the DCE. Of these, 70% 
(n = 103) preferred being provided with written and online information rather 
than just written information. This preference was statistically significant 
(p < 0.01). Fifty-nine percent (n = 86) of patients preferred two 20-min 
consultations over one 40-min consultation when making a treatment decision. 
Significantly, more patients preferred two shorter consultations rather than one 
longer consultation when this was combined with written and online information 
(p < 0.01).
CONCLUSION: When making a cancer treatment decision, clinicians should consider 
offering patients written and online information, combined with two shorter 
consultations.

OBJECTIVE: We determined the cost-effectiveness of two different diagnostic 
imaging strategies in guiding curative treatment of early-stage hepatocellular 
carcinoma (HCC).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We developed a decision analytic model using as its 
starting point a cohort of patients aged 55 years with early-stage HCC detected 
at dynamic multiphasic CT and with Child-Pugh class A cirrhosis. The model 
compared two strategies on the initial workup: conventional CT strategy using 
dynamic multiphasic CT only and gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI strategy using 
additional gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI after initial CT. A Markov cohort model 
simulated a cohort of patients after curative or adjuvant treatment, with 
follow-up over the remaining life expectancy. We analyzed mean life-years gain, 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), costs per person, and incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). To evaluate results, we performed one-way, 
two-way, and probabilistic sensitivity analyses.
RESULTS: The life expectancies and QALY were 7.22 years and 5.08 for the 
conventional CT strategy and 7.79 years and 5.52 for the gadoxetic acid-enhanced 
MRI strategy, respectively. The expected costs were $99,770 for conventional CT 
and $105,025 for gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI in the United States. The ICER with 
gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI was $11,957, as opposed to that with conventional 
CT, which was lower than the cost-effectiveness threshold of $50,000/QALY. 
One-way, two-way, and probabilistic sensitivity analyses showed unchanged 
results over an acceptable range.
CONCLUSION: Gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI after CT is cost-effective for detecting 
additional HCC in patients with early-stage HCC who can undergo curative 
treatment (besides liver transplantation). The cost-effectiveness of gadoxetic 
acid-enhanced MRI may be considered in the management of patients with 
early-stage HCC during staging.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of chemohormonal therapy in patients 
with metastatic hormone-sensitive and non-metastatic high-risk prostate cancer.
METHODS: An analytical decision model was developed to determine the 
cost-effectiveness of chemohormonal therapy versus androgen deprivation therapy 
alone in patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer and patients 
with non-metastatic high-risk prostate cancer. The cost-effectiveness in 
metastatic patients with a high-volume disease was assessed separately. The 
model used data from randomized clinical trials and drug acquisition costs in 
Brazil. In addition, the costs of post-progression therapies have been included 
in this model. The benefits to health are expressed as the quality-adjusted 
life-years, and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated.
RESULTS: Chemohormonal therapy may be associated with improved quality-adjusted 
life-years for all patient. The improvement was more than six times greater for 
patients with high-volume metastatic disease. In these patients, the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios were up to 74% lower than the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios of patients with non-metastatic disease.
CONCLUSION: Chemohormonal therapy has been more cost-effective in patients with 
high-volume metastatic disease.

OBJETIVO: Avaliar a relação custo-efetividade da adição de quimioterapia 
hormonal em pacientes com câncer de próstata metastático sensível a hormônio ou 
localizado de alto risco.
MÉTODOS: Um modelo de decisão analítico foi desenvolvido para determinar o 
custo-efetividade da adição de quimioterapia versus a monoterapia de privação de 
andrógeno para pacientes com câncer de próstata metastático hormônio-sensível e 
pacientes de alto risco com câncer de próstata não metastático. O 
custo-efetividade em pacientes metastáticos com um alto volume da doença foi 
verificado isoladamente. Os dados do modelo foram obtidos de ensaios clínicos 
randomizados utilizando custos de aquisição de medicamentos no Brasil. Os custos 
de terapias pós-progressão também foram incluídos no modelo. Os efeitos foram 
expressos em anos de vida ajustados por qualidade, e foram calculadas as razões 
de custo-efetividade incremental.
RESULTADOS: A adição de quimioterapia levou a um ganho de anos de vida ajustados 
por qualidade para todos os doentes. Este incremento foi seis vezes maior para 
os pacientes com doença metastática de alto volume. Nestes pacientes, as taxas 
do custo incremental por anos de vida ajustados por qualidade foram até 74% mais 
baixos do que o aumento das taxas dos pacientes com doença não metastática.
CONCLUSÃO: A adição de quimioterapia foi mais custo-efetiva para pacientes com 
doença metastática de alto volume.

BACKGROUND: Child maltreatment is a significant public health problem. Group 
Family Nurse Partnership (gFNP) is a new intervention for young, expectant 
mothers implemented successfully in pilot studies. This study was designed to 
determine the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of gFNP in reducing risk 
factors for maltreatment with a potentially vulnerable population.
METHODS: A multi-site, randomized controlled, parallel-arm trial and prospective 
economic evaluation was conducted, with allocation via remote randomization 
(minimization by site, maternal age group) to gFNP or usual care. Participants 
were expectant mothers aged below 20 years with at least one live birth, or aged 
20-24 years with no live births and with low educational qualifications. Data 
from maternal interviews at baseline and when infants were 2, 6 and 12 months, 
and video-recording at 12 months, were collected by researchers blind to 
allocation. Cost information came from weekly logs completed by gFNP family 
nurses and other service delivery data reported by participants. Primary 
outcomes measured at 12 months were parenting attitudes (Adult-Adolescent 
Parenting Index, AAPI-2) and maternal sensitivity (CARE Index). The economic 
evaluation was conducted from a UK NHS and personal social services perspective 
with cost-effectiveness expressed in terms of incremental cost per 
quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. The main analyses were 
intention-to-treat with additional complier average causal effects (CACE) 
analyses.
RESULTS: Between August 2013 and September 2014, 492 names of potential 
participants were received of whom 319 were eligible and 166 agreed to take 
part, 99 randomly assigned to receive gFNP and 67 to usual care. There were no 
between-arm differences in AAPI-2 total (7 · 5/10 in both, SE 0.1), difference 
adjusted for baseline, site and maternal age group 0 · 06 (95% CI - 0 · 15 to 
0 · 28, p = 0 · 59) or CARE Index (intervention 4 · 0 (SE 0 · 3); control 4 · 7 
(SE 0 · 4); difference adjusted for site and maternal age group - 0 · 68 (95% 
CI - 1 · 62 to 0 · 16, p = 0 · 25) scores. The probability that gFNP is 
cost-effective based on the QALY measure did not exceed 3%.
CONCLUSIONS: The trial did not support gFNP as a means of reducing the risk of 
child maltreatment in this population but slow recruitment adversely affected 
group size and consequently delivery of the intervention.

Zebrafish is an excellent model to study central nervous system (CNS) axonal 
degeneration and regeneration since we can observe these processes in vivo and 
in real time in transparent larvae. Previous studies have shown that Mauthner 
cell (M-cell) axon regenerates poorly after mechanical spinal cord injury. 
Inconsistent with this result, however, we have found that M-cell possesses a 
great capacity for axon regeneration after two-photon laser ablation. By using 
ZEISS LSM 710 two-photon microscope, we performed specific unilateral axotomy of 
GFP labeled M-cells in the Tol-056 enhancer trap line larvae. Our results showed 
that distal axons almost degenerated completely at 24h after laser axotomy. 
After that, the proximal axons initiated a robust regeneration and many of the 
M-cell axons almost regenerated fully at 4days post axotomy. Furthermore, we 
also visualized that regenerated axons were remyelinated when we severed 
fluorescent dye labeled M-cells in the Tg (mbp:EGFP-CAAX) line larvae. Moreover, 
by single M-cell co-electroporation with Syp:EGFP and DsRed2 plasmids we 
observed synapses re-establishment in vivo during laser injury-induced axon 
re-extension which suggested re-innervation of denervated pathways. In addition, 
we further demonstrated that nocodazole administration could completely abolish 
this regeneration capacity. These results together suggested that in vivo 
time-lapse imaging of M-cell axon laser injury may provide a powerful analytical 
model for understanding the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms of the 
CNS axon regeneration.

AIMS: This 501-patient, multi-centre, randomised controlled trial sought to 
establish the effect of low-intensity, pulsed, ultrasound (LIPUS) on tibial 
shaft fractures managed with intramedullary nailing. We conducted an economic 
evaluation as part of this trial.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data for patients' use of post-operative healthcare 
resources and time taken to return to work were collected and costed using 
publicly available sources. Health-related quality of life, assessed using the 
Health Utilities Index Mark-3 (HUI-3), was used to derive quality-adjusted life 
years (QALYs). Costs and QALYs were compared between LIPUS and control (a 
placebo device) from a payer and societal perspective using non-parametric 
bootstrapping. All costs are reported in 2015 Canadian dollars unless otherwise 
stated.
RESULTS: With a cost per device of $3,995, the mean cost was significantly 
higher for patients treated with LIPUS versus placebo from a payer (mean 
increase = $3647, 95% confidence interval (CI) $3244 to $4070; p < 0.001) or a 
societal perspective (mean increase = $3425, 95% CI $1568 to $5283; p < 0.001). 
LIPUS did not provide a significant benefit in terms of QALYs gained (mean 
difference = 0.023 QALYs, 95% CI -0.035 to 0.069; p = 0.474). Incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios of LIPUS compared with placebo were $155 433/QALY from 
a payer perspective and $146 006/QALY from a societal perspective.
CONCLUSION: At the current price, LIPUS is not cost-effective for fresh tibial 
fractures managed with intramedullary nailing. Cite this article: Bone Joint J

The changing climate is shifting the distributions of marine species, yet the 
potential for shifts in depth distributions is virtually unexplored. Hydrostatic 
pressure is proposed to contribute to a physiological bottleneck constraining 
depth range extension in shallow-water taxa. However, bathymetric limitation by 
hydrostatic pressure remains undemonstrated, and the mechanism limiting 
hyperbaric tolerance remains hypothetical. Here, we assess the effects of 
hydrostatic pressure in the lithodid crab Lithodes maja (bathymetric range 
4-790 m depth, approximately equivalent to 0.1 to 7.9 MPa hydrostatic pressure). 
Heart rate decreased with increasing hydrostatic pressure, and was significantly 
lower at ≥10.0 MPa than at 0.1 MPa. Oxygen consumption increased with increasing 
hydrostatic pressure to 12.5 MPa, before decreasing as hydrostatic pressure 
increased to 20.0 MPa; oxygen consumption was significantly higher at 
7.5-17.5 MPa than at 0.1 MPa. Increases in expression of genes associated with 
neurotransmission, metabolism and stress were observed between 7.5 and 12.5 MPa. 
We suggest that hyperbaric tolerance in Lmaja may be oxygen-limited by 
hyperbaric effects on heart rate and metabolic rate, but that Lmaja's 
bathymetric range is limited by metabolic costs imposed by the effects of high 
hydrostatic pressure. These results advocate including hydrostatic pressure in a 
complex model of environmental tolerance, where energy limitation constrains 
biogeographic range, and facilitate the incorporation of hydrostatic pressure 
into the broader metabolic framework for ecology and evolution. Such an approach 
is crucial for accurately projecting biogeographic responses to changing 
climate, and for understanding the ecology and evolution of life at depth.

BACKGROUND: Migration selectivity is thought to shape the health profiles of 
Mexican immigrants.
OBJECTIVE: This study examines how the experience of Mexican migration to the 
United States affects the health process and the quality of life in old age by 
age at migration, specific to sex.
METHODS: We use 20 years of data from the Hispanic Established Populations for 
the Epidemiologic Study of the Elderly to estimate the proportion of life spent 
disability-free prior to death across eight subgroups by sex, nativity, and age 
at migration among Mexican-origin elderly in the United States.
RESULTS: Female migrants are at a significant disadvantage in terms of IADL 
disability-free life expectancy relative to US-born women, particularly 
late-life migrants. Conversely, mid- and late-life male migrants exhibit an 
advantage in ADL disability-free life expectancy compared to their US-born 
counterparts.
CONCLUSIONS: Foreign-born Mexican elders are not a homogeneous group. This issue 
merits special attention in the development of community-based long-term care 
programs in order to appropriately target the specific needs of different 
subgroups of older Mexican individuals entering their last decades of life.
CONTRIBUTION: This study contributes to immigrant health literature by providing 
a more comprehensive documentation of nativity differentials, by distinguishing 
subgroups of Mexican elderly by sex, nativity, and age at migration.

Semi-Functional Quantitative Flow Cytometry Assay for Lymphocytic 
Choriomeningitis Virus Titration.

University Seoul 03722, Korea.

Quantitative PCR and plaque assay are powerful virological techniques used to 
measure the load of defective or infectious virus in mouse and human. However, 
these methods display limitations such as cross contamination and long run-time. 
Here, we describe a novel technique termed as semi-functional quantitative flow 
cytometry (SFQF) for the accurate estimation of the quantity of infectious 
lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV). LCMV titration method using flow 
cytometry was previously developed but has technical shortcomings, owing to the 
less optimized parameters such as cell overgrowth, plate scale, and detection 
threshold. Therefore, we first established optimized conditions for SFQF assay 
using LCMV nucleoprotein (NP)-specific antibody to evaluate the threshold of the 
virus detection range in the plaque assay. We subsequently demonstrated that the 
optimization of the method increased the sensitivity of virus detection. We 
revealed several new advantages of SFQF assay, which overcomes some of the 
previously contentious points, and established an upgraded version of the 
previously reported flow cytometric titration assay. This method extends the
