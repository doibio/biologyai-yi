Due to the high levels of alcohol use, alcohol-attributable mortality and burden 
of disease, and detrimental drinking patterns, Lithuania implemented a series of 
alcohol control policies within a relatively short period of time, between 2008 
and 2019. Based on their expected impact on alcohol consumption and 
alcohol-attributable harm, as well as their target population, these policies 
have been classified using a set of objective criteria and expert opinion. The 
classification criteria included: positive vs. negative outcomes, mainly 
immediate vs. delayed outcomes, and general population vs. specific group 
outcomes. The judgement of the alcohol policy experts converged on the objective 
criteria, and, as a result, two tiers of intervention were identified: Tier 
1-highly effective general population interventions with an anticipated 
immediate impact; Tier 2-other interventions aimed at the general population. In 
addition, interventions directed at specific populations were identified. This 
adaptable methodological approach to alcohol control policy classification is 
intended to provide guidance and support for the evaluation of alcohol policies 
elsewhere, to lay the foundation for the critical assessment of the policies to 
improve health and increase life expectancy, and to reduce crime and violence.

We analyzed miR-146b, miR-21, miR-221, miR-21, and miR-181b in formalin fixed 
paraffin-embedded papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) tissue samples of 312 
individuals and evaluated their expression relationship with clinicopathological 
parameters. A higher expression of miR-21 was related to unifocal lesions (p < 
0.011) and autoimmune thyroiditis (0.007). miR-221, miR-222 expression was 
higher in the PTC tissue samples with extrathyroidal extension (p = 0.049, 
0.003, respectively). In a group of PTC patients with pT1a and pT1b sized 
tumors, the expression of miR-146b, miR-21, miR-221, and miR-222 in PTC tissue 
samples was lower than in patients with pT2, pT3, and pT4 (p = 0.032; 0.0044; 
0.003; 0.001; 0.001, respectively). Patients with lymph node metastases had 
higher expression of miR-21, -221, -222, and -181b (p < 0.05). A high expression 
of miR-146b, miR-21, miR-221 panel was associated with decreased overall 
survival (OS) (Log rank p = 0.019). Univariate analysis revealed that presence 
of metastatic lymph nodes and high expression of miR-146b, miR-21, and miR-221 
panels were associated with increased hazard of shorter OS. After multivariate 
analysis, only sex (male) and age (≥55 years) emerged as independent prognostic 
factors associated with shorter OS (HR 0.28 (95% CI 0.09-0.86) and HR 0.05 (95% 
CI 0.01-0.22), respectively). In conclusion, 5 analyzed miRs expression have 
significant relations to clinicopathologic parameters so further investigations 
of these molecules are expedient while searching for prognostic PTC biomarkers.

INTRODUCTION: Femoroacetabular impingement is a commonly recognized condition 
among people with hip pain.
AIM: The aim of this study was to assess how arthroscopy and physiotherapy 
treatment influenced the quality of life and functional condition of patients 
after arthroscopic femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) surgery.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We examined 19 people for the study and included 12 (6 
men and 6 women). Their mean age was 40.1 ± 9.7 years. Manual and digital 
goniometers were used for the range of motion (ROM) measurements, and a 
dynamometer for muscle strength was used. Results from the operated limb were 
compared to the nonoperated healthy limb. We examined the patient's health and 
well-being using the Harris Hip Score (HHS) and Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) 
scales. The mean follow-up period was 21.2 months.
RESULTS: The postsurgery mean range of motion for all movements was lower in the 
operated limb. Statistically significant differences between limbs in ROM were 
observed for flexion, abduction, extension, and external rotation. Muscle 
strength was comparable between hip joints, except extension and adduction, 
which were statistically significantly weaker. The mean strength of the hip 
flexors and internal rotators was higher in the operated limb. After surgery, 
67% of patients returned to exercise at the same or higher level. The mean HHS 
results were good, with values of 88.00 ± 11.48. The SF-36 scores were >50.
CONCLUSION: After surgery and physiotherapy of FAI, ROM remained lower in the 
operated limb. Flexion and rotations remained to cause pain. The strength of 
flexors and internal rotators improved, and there was a high rate of return to 
sport.

This study aims to calculate the health-adjusted life years (HALE) by using 
years lived with disability (YLD) from the national claims data, as well as to 
identify the differences and inequalities in income level and region. The study 
was carried out on total population receiving health insurance and medical 
benefits. We calculated incidence-based YLD for 260 disease groups, and used it 
as the number of healthy years lost to calculate HALE. We adopted the insurance 
premium to calculate the income as a proxy indicator. For the region 
classification, we chose 250 Korean municipal-level administrative districts. 
Our results revealed that HALE increased from 2008 to 2018. HALE in males 
increased faster than that in females. HALE was higher in higher income levels. 
In 2018, the gap in HALE between Q1 and Q2, the lower income group, was about 
5.57 years. The gap in females by income level was smaller than that in males. 
Moreover, the gap in HALE by region was found to increase. Results suggest that 
there is an inequality in YLD in terms of income level in Korea. Therefore, we 
need intensive management for the low-income group to promote HALE at the 
national level.

Phage display technology involves the surface genetic engineering of phages to 
expose desirable proteins or peptides whose gene sequences are packaged within 
phage genomes, thereby rendering direct linkage between genotype with phenotype 
feasible. This has resulted in phage display systems becoming invaluable 
components of directed evolutionary biotechnology. The M13 is a DNA phage 
display system which dominates this technology and usually involves selected 
proteins or peptides being displayed through surface engineering of its minor 
coat proteins. The displayed protein or peptide's functionality is often highly 
reduced due to harsh treatment of M13 variants. Recently, we developed a novel 
phage display system using the coliphage Qβ as a nano-biotechnology platform. 
The coliphage Qβ is an RNA phage belonging to the family of Leviviridae, a long 
investigated virus. Qβ phages exist as a quasispecies and possess features 
making them comparatively more suitable and unique for directed evolutionary 
biotechnology. As a quasispecies, Qβ benefits from the promiscuity of its RNA 
dependent RNA polymerase replicase, which lacks proofreading activity, and 
thereby permits rapid variant generation, mutation, and adaptation. The minor 
coat protein of Qβ is the readthrough protein, A1. It shares the same initiation 
codon with the major coat protein and is produced each time the ribosome 
translates the UGA stop codon of the major coat protein with the of 
misincorporation of tryptophan. This misincorporation occurs at a low level 
(1/15). Per convention and definition, A1 is the target for display technology, 
as this minor coat protein does not play a role in initiating the life cycle of 
Qβ phage like the pIII of M13. The maturation protein A2 of Qβ initiates the 
life cycle by binding to the pilus of the F+ host bacteria. The extension of the 
A1 protein with a foreign peptide probe recognizes and binds to the target 
freely, while the A2 initiates the infection. This avoids any disturbance of the 
complex and the necessity for acidic elution and neutralization prior to 
infection. The combined use of both the A1 and A2 proteins of Qβ in this display 
system allows for novel bio-panning, in vitro maturation, and evolution. 
Additionally, methods for large library size construction have been improved 
with our directed evolutionary phage display system. This novel phage display 
technology allows 12 copies of a specific desired peptide to be displayed on the 
exterior surface of Qβ in uniform distribution at the corners of the phage 
icosahedron. Through the recently optimized subtractive bio-panning strategy, 
fusion probes containing up to 80 amino acids altogether with linkers, can be 
displayed for target selection. Thus, combined uniqueness of its genome, 
structure, and proteins make the Qβ phage a desirable suitable innovation 
applicable in affinity maturation and directed evolutionary biotechnology. The 
evolutionary adaptability of the Qβ phage display strategy is still in its 
infancy. However, it has the potential to evolve functional domains of the 
desirable proteins, glycoproteins, and lipoproteins, rendering them superior to 
their natural counterparts.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent form of dementia, and the numbers 
of AD patients are expected to increase as human life expectancy improves. 
Deposition of β-amyloid protein (Aβ) in the extracellular matrix and 
intracellular neurofibrillary tangles are molecular hallmarks of the disease. 
Since the precise pathophysiology of AD has not been elucidated yet, effective 
treatment is not available. Thus, understanding the disease pathology, as well 
as identification and development of valid biomarkers, is imperative for early 
diagnosis as well as for monitoring disease progression and therapeutic 
responses. Keeping this goal in mind several studies using quantitative 
proteomics platform have been carried out on both clinical specimens including 
the brain, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), plasma and on animal models of AD. In this 
review, we summarize the mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics studies on AD 
and discuss the discovery as well as validation stages in brief to identify 
candidate biomarkers.

Many studies have highlighted the relationship between food and health status, 
with the aim of improving both disease prevention and life expectancy. Among the 
different food groups, fermented foods a have huge microbial biodiversity, 
making them an interesting source of metabolites that could exhibit health 
benefits. Our previous study highlighted the capacity of raw goat milk cheese, 
and some of the extracts recovered by the means of chemical fractionation, to 
increase the longevity of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. In this article, 
we pursued the investigation with a view toward understanding the biological 
mechanisms involved in this phenomenon. Using mutant nematode strains, we 
evaluated the implication of the insulin-like DAF-2/DAF-16 and the p38 MAPK 
pathways in the phenomenon of increased longevity and oxidative-stress 
resistance mechanisms. Our results demonstrated that freeze-dried raw goat milk 
cheese, and its extracts, induced the activation of the DAF-2/DAF-16 pathway, 
increasing longevity. Concerning oxidative-stress resistance, all the extracts 
increased the survival of the worms, but no evidence of the implication of both 
of the pathways was highlighted, except for the cheese-lipid extract that did 
seem to require both pathways to improve the survival rate. Simultaneously, the 
cheese-lipid extract and the dried extract W70, obtained with water, were able 
to reduce the reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in human leukocytes. This 
result is in good correlation with the results obtained with the nematode.

An abundance of literature has investigated the association between low back 
pain (LBP) and physical ability or function. It has been shown that LBP patients 
display reduced range of motion, decreased balance ability, impaired 
proprioception, and lower strength compared to asymptomatic persons. The aim of 
this study was to investigate the differences between LBP patients and healthy 
controls in terms of several physical abilities. Based on the premised that 
different biomechanical and physiological causes and consequences could be 
related to different types of LBP, a secondary exploratory attempt of the study 
was to examine the differences between LBP subgroups based on the pain location 
(local or referred) or type of pathology (discogenic or degenerative) on the 
level of impairment of function and ability. Participants performed range of 
motion tests, trunk maximal voluntary contraction force tests, a sitting balance 
assessment, the timed up-and-go test, the chair rise test, and the trunk 
reposition error test. Compared to the control group, symptomatic patients on 
average showed 45.7% lower trunk extension (p < 0.001, η2 = 0.33) and 27.7 % 
lower trunk flexion force (p < 0.001, η2 = 0.37) during maximal voluntary 
contraction. LBP patients exhibited decreased sitting balance ability and lower 
scores in mobility tests (all p < 0.001). There were no differences between 
groups in Schober's test and trunk repositioning error (p > 0.05). No 
differences were observed among the LBP subgroups. The exploratory analyses are 
limited by the sample size and uncertain validity of the diagnostic procedures 
within this study. Further studies with appropriate diagnostic procedures and 
perhaps a different subgrouping of the LBP patients are needed to elucidate if 
different types of LBP are related to altered biomechanics, physiology, and 
function.

According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the average 
human life expectancy is 78.8 years. Specifically, 3.2 million deaths are 
reported yearly due to heart disease, cancer, Alzheimer's disease, diabetes, and 
COVID-19. Diagnosing the disease is mandatory in the current way of living to 
avoid unfortunate deaths and maintain average life expectancy. CMOS image sensor 
(CIS) became a prominent technology in assisting the monitoring and clinical 
diagnosis devices to treat diseases in the medical domain. To address the 
significance of CMOS image 'sensors' usage in disease diagnosis systems, this 
paper focuses on the CIS incorporated disease diagnosis systems related to vital 
organs of the human body like the heart, lungs, brain, eyes, intestines, bones, 
skin, blood, and bacteria cells causing diseases. This literature survey's main 
objective is to evaluate the 'systems' capabilities and highlight the most 
potent ones with advantages, disadvantages, and accuracy, that are used in 
disease diagnosis. This systematic review used PRISMA workflow for study 
selection methodology, and the parameter-based evaluation is performed on 
disease diagnosis systems related to the human body's organs. The corresponding 
CIS models used in systems are mapped organ-wise, and the data collected over 
the last decade are tabulated.

As the average age and life expectancy increases, the incidence of both acute 
and chronic central nervous system (CNS) pathologies will increase. 
Understanding mechanisms underlying neuroinflammation as the common feature of 
any neurodegenerative pathology, we can exploit the pharmacology of cell 
specific ion channels to improve the outcome of many CNS diseases. As the main 
cellular player of neuroinflammation, microglia play a central role in this 
process. Although microglia are considered non-excitable cells, they express a 
variety of ion channels under both physiological and pathological conditions 
that seem to be involved in a plethora of cellular processes. Here, we discuss 
the impact of modulating microglia voltage-gated, potential transient receptor, 
chloride and proton channels on microglial proliferation, migration, and 
phagocytosis in neurodegenerative diseases.

Methamphetamine is, worldwide, one of the most consumed drugs of abuse. One 
important side effect is neurodegeneration leading to a decrease in life 
expectancy. The aim of this paper was to check whether the drug affects one of 
the receptors involved in neurodegeneration/neuroprotection events, namely the 
adenosine A2A receptor (A2AR). First, we noticed that methamphetamine does not 
affect A2A functionality if the receptor is expressed in a heterologous system. 
However, A2AR becomes sensitive to the drug upon complexes formation with the 
cannabinoid CB1 receptor (CB1R) and the sigma 1 receptor (σ1R). Signaling via 
both adenosine A2AR and cannabinoid CB1R was affected by methamphetamine in 
cells co-expressing the two receptors. In striatal primary cultures, the 
A2AR-CB1R heteromer complex was detected and methamphetamine not only altered 
its expression but completely blocked the A2AR- and the CB1R-mediated activation 
of the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. In conclusion, 
methamphetamine, with the participation of σ1R, alters the expression and 
function of two interacting receptors, A2AR, which is a therapeutic target for 
neuroprotection, and CB1R, which is the most abundant G protein-coupled receptor 
(GPCR) in the brain.

Cervical cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death among women 
worldwide. The chemotherapeutical agent cisplatin, a small platinum-based 
compound, is considered as the standard therapy for locally advanced cervical 
cancer or recurrent cancers, sometimes in combination with radiotherapy or other 
drugs. However, drug resistance and radio-resistance phenomena could reduce the 
life expectancy of cervical cancer patients. Resistance mechanisms are complex 
and often involve multiple cellular pathways in which microRNAs (miRNAs) play a 
fundamental role. miRNAs are a class of endogenous non-coding small RNAs 
responsible for post-transcriptional gene regulation. Convincing evidence 
demonstrates that several deregulated miRNAs are important regulators in the 
onset of drug and radioresistance in cervical cancer, thus underlying their 
potential applications in a clinical setting. In this review, we summarized the 
mechanisms by which miRNAs affect both cisplatin and radioresistance in cervical 
cancer. We also described the regulatory loops between miRNAs and lncRNAs 
promoting drug resistance. Besides, we reported evidence for the role of miRNAs 
in sensitizing cancer cells to cisplatin-based chemotherapy, and provided some 
suggestions for the development of new combined therapies for cervical cancer.

The life expectancy of patients with high-grade glioma (HGG) has not improved in 
decades. One of the crucial tools to enable future improvement is advanced 
models that faithfully recapitulate the tumour microenvironment; they can be 
used for high-throughput screening that in future may enable accurate 
personalised drug screens. Currently, advanced models are crucial for 
identifying and understanding potential new targets, assessing new 
chemotherapeutic compounds or other treatment modalities. Recently, various 
methodologies have come into use that have allowed the validation of complex 
models-namely, spheroids, tumouroids, hydrogel-embedded cultures 
(matrix-supported) and advanced bioengineered cultures assembled with 
bioprinting and microfluidics. This review is designed to present the state of 
advanced models of HGG, whilst focusing as much as is possible on the paediatric 
form of the disease. The reality remains, however, that paediatric HGG (pHGG) 
models are years behind those of adult HGG. Our goal is to bring this to light 
in the hope that pGBM models can be improved upon.

Ready-to-eat salads are very perishable with quality losses within 6-7 days, and 
the extension of their shelf life is still a challenge. In this work, an 
atmospheric pressure plasma jet (APPJ) was applied for the surface 
decontamination of fresh-cut lettuce baby leaves. The APPJ antimicrobial 
efficiency on the natural microbiota and its impact on some physicochemical 
attributes of lettuce were evaluated as a function of the treatment duration 
(0-30 s). Then, the influence of plasma treatment on the salad shelf life was 
studied, following the growth of aerobic mesophilic bacteria in both untreated 
and plasma-treated samples during 9 days of storage at 4 °C, together with the 
plasma-induced changes in physicochemical parameters of lettuce leaves. The APPJ 
induced a fast (15 s) microbial decontamination (1.3 log10 CFU/g) of the salad 
surface. Exposure time and salad-plasma plume distance were the parameters that 
substantially affected the microbial inactivation. APPJ treatment retarded 
bacterial growth during the refrigerated storage, as plasma-treated samples were 
noticeably less contaminated than the non-treated ones in the first 3-4 days. No 
significant effect were observed on electrolyte leakage, pH, and dry matter 
content in both the set up phase and the shelf life study.

BACKGROUND: The prevalence of pediatric metabolic syndrome is usually closely 
linked to overweight and obesity; however, this condition has also been 
described in children with disabilities. We performed a multivariate pattern 
analysis of metabolic profiles in neurologically impaired children and 
adolescents in order to reveal patterns and crucial biomarkers among highly 
interrelated variables.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 44 cases of patients (25M/19F, 
mean age 12.9 ± 8.0) with severe disabilities. Clinical and anthropometric 
parameters, body composition, blood pressure, and metabolic and endocrinological 
assessment (fasting blood glucose, insulin, total cholesterol, high-density 
lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase, 
glutamate pyruvate transaminase, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase) were recorded in 
all patients. As a control group, we evaluated 120 healthy children and 
adolescents (61M/59F, mean age 12.9 ± 2.7).
RESULTS: In the univariate analysis, the children-with-disabilities group showed 
a more dispersed distribution, thus with higher variability of the features 
related to glucose metabolism and insulin resistance (IR) compared to the 
healthy controls. The principal component (PC1), which emerged from the PC 
analysis conducted on the merged dataset and characterized by these variables, 
was crucial in describing the differences between the children-with-disabilities 
group and controls.
CONCLUSION: Children and adolescents with disabilities displayed a different 
metabolic profile compared to controls. Metabolic syndrome (MetS), particularly 
glucose metabolism and IR, is a crucial point to consider in the treatment and 
care of this fragile pediatric population. Early detection of the interrelated 
variables and intervention on these modifiable risk factors for metabolic 
disturbances play a central role in pediatric health and life expectancy in 
patients with a severe disability.

Physical activity and low-level laser therapy (LLLT) can reduce knee 
osteoarthritis (KOA) inflammation. We are conducting a randomized 
placebo-controlled trial to investigate the long-term effectiveness of LLLT 
combined with strength training (ST) in persons with KOA, since it, to our 
knowledge, has not been investigated before. Fifty participants were enrolled. 
LLLT and ST was performed 3 times per week over 3 and 8 weeks, respectively. In 
the LLLT group, 3 Joules of 904 nm wavelength laser was applied to 15 spots per 
knee (45 Joules/knee/session). The primary outcomes are pain during movement, at 
night and at rest (Visual Analogue Scale) and global pain (Knee injury and 
Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, KOOS) pain subscale. The secondary outcomes are 
KOOS disability and quality-of-life, analgesic usage, global health change, knee 
active range of motion, 30 s chair stand, maximum painless isometric knee 
extension strength, knee pain pressure threshold and real-time 
ultrasonography-assessed suprapatellar effusion, meniscal neovascularization and 
femur cartilage thickness. All the outcomes are assessed 0, 3, 8, 26 and 52 
weeks post-randomization, except for global health change, which is only 
evaluated at completed ST. This study features the blinding of participants, 
assessors and therapists, and will improve our understanding of what occurs with 
the local pathophysiology, tissue morphology and clinical status of persons with 
KOA up to a year after the initiation of ST and a higher 904 nm LLLT dose than 
in any published trial on this topic.

With the development of unstable footwear, more research has focused on the 
advantages of this type of shoe. This type of shoe could improve the muscle 
function of the lower limb and prevent injury risks in dynamic situations. 
Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate differences in 
lower-limb kinetics and kinematics based on single-leg landing (SLL) using 
normal shoes (NS) and bionic shoes (BS). The study used 15 male subject 
volunteers (age 23.4 ± 1.14 years, height 177.6 ± 4.83cm, body weight (BW) 73.6 
± 7.02 kg). To ensure the subject standardization of the participants, there 
were several inclusion criteria used for selection. There were two kinds of 
experimental shoes used in the landing experiment to detect the change of lower 
limbs when a landing task was performed. Kinetics and kinematic data were 
collected during an SLL task, and statistical parametric mapping (SPM) analysis 
was used to evaluate the differences between NS and BS. We found that the 
flexion and extension angles of the knee (p = 0.004) and hip (p = 0.046, p = 
0.018) joints, and the dorsiflexion and plantarflexion of ankle (p = 0.031) 
moment were significantly different in the sagittal planes. In the frontal 
plane, the eversion and inversion of the ankle (p = 0.016), and the abduction 
and adduction of knee (p = 0.017, p = 0.007) angle were found significant 
differences. In the horizontal plane, the external and internal rotation of hip 
(p = 0.036) and knee (p < 0.001, p = 0.029) moment were found significant 
differences, and knee angle (p = 0.043) also. According to our results, we 
conclude that using BS can cause bigger knee and hip flexion than NS. Also, this 
finding indicates that BS might be considered to reduce lower-limb injury risk 
during the SLL phase.

Comment on
    Chemosphere. 2013 Sep;93(2):201-8.

The objective of this commentary is to promote the use of bivalves as 
biomonitors, which is a part of the continual efforts of the International 
Mussel Watch. This commentary is an additional discussion on "Bivalve mollusks 
in metal pollution studies: From bioaccumulation to biomonitoring" by Zuykov et 
al., published in Chemosphere 93, 201-208. The present discussion can serve as a 
platform for further insights to provide new thoughts and novel ideas on how to 
make better use of bivalves in biomonitoring studies. The certainty of better 
and more extensive applications of mollusks in environmental monitoring in the 
future is almost confirmed but more studies are urgently needed. With all the 
reported studies using bivalves as biomonitors of heavy metal pollution, the 
effectiveness of using Mussel Watch is beyond any reasonable doubts. The 
challenge is the development of more accurate methodologies for of heavy metal 
data interpretation, and the precision of the biomonitoring studies using 
bivalves as biomonitors, whether in coastal or freshwater ecosystems. Lastly, 
inclusion of human health risk assessment of heavy metals in commercial bivalves 
would make the research papers of high public interest.

Sargassum fusiforme, a plant used as a medicine and food, is regarded as a 
marine vegetable and health supplement to improve life expectancy. Here, we 
demonstrate that S. fusiforme extract (SFE) has antiviral effects against 
respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in vitro and in vivo mouse model. Treatment of 
HEp2 cells with a non-cytotoxic concentration of SFE significantly reduced RSV 
replication, RSV-induced cell death, RSV gene transcription, RSV protein 
synthesis, and syncytium formation. Moreover, oral inoculation of SFE 
significantly improved RSV clearance from the lungs of BALB/c mice. 
Interestingly, the phenolic compounds eicosane, docosane, and tetracosane were 
identified as active components of SFE. Treatment with a non-cytotoxic 
concentration of these three components elicited similar antiviral effects 
against RSV infection as SFE in vitro. Together, these results suggest that SFE 
and its potential components are a promising natural antiviral agent candidate 
against RSV infection.

University, P.O. Box 311, FI-65101 Vaasa, Finland.

As the ethnic composition around the world is becoming more diverse, the need to 
produce vital statistics for ethnically mixed populations is continuously 
increasing. Our aim is to provide the first life expectancy estimates for 
individuals with uniform Finnish, uniform Swedish, and mixed Finnish-Swedish 
backgrounds, based on individuals in the native population of Finland who can be 
linked to both their parents. Life expectancy at birth in the period 2005-2015 
was calculated from population and mortality numbers at the one-year level based 
on each person's sex, year of birth, and the unique ethnolinguistic affiliation 
of the index person and each parent. Swedish-registered individuals with 
Swedish-registered parents had the longest life expectancy at birth, or 85.68 
years (95% CI: 85.60-85.77) for females and 81.36 for males (95% CI: 
81.30-81.42), as compared to 84.76 years (95% CI: 84.72-84.79) and 78.89 years 
(95% CI: 78.86-78.92) for Finnish-registered females and males with 
Finnish-registered parents. Persons with mixed backgrounds were found in between 
those with uniform Finnish and uniform Swedish backgrounds. An individual's own 
ethnolinguistic affiliation is nevertheless more important for longevity than 
parental affiliation. Similar register-based analyses for other countries with 
mixed populations would be useful.

The loss of skeletal muscle mass (muscle atrophy or wasting) caused by aging, 
diseases, and injury decreases quality of life, survival rates, and healthy life 
expectancy in humans. Although long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been 
implicated in skeletal muscle formation and differentiation, their precise roles 
in muscle atrophy remain unclear. In this study, we used RNA-sequencing 
(RNA-Seq) to examine changes in the expression of lncRNAs in four muscle atrophy 
conditions (denervation, casting, fasting, and cancer cachexia) in mice. We 
successfully identified 33 annotated lncRNAs and 18 novel lncRNAs with common 
expression changes in all four muscle atrophy conditions. Furthermore, an 
analysis of lncRNA-mRNA correlations revealed that several lncRNAs affected 
small molecule biosynthetic processes during muscle atrophy. These results 
provide novel insights into the lncRNA-mediated regulatory mechanism underlying 
muscle atrophy and may be useful for the identification of promising therapeutic 
targets.

Achieving the optimal transition to a family diet over the first two years of 
life has remained a challenge in Ethiopia. The use of amylase-rich flour (ARF) 
can improve complementary foods. However, utilisation requires an effective 
delivery strategy for upskilling the community to use ARF. The aim of this study 
was to explore facilitators and barriers of cascading ARF skills to improve 
complementary foods. The study was conducted in Gale Mirga kebele of Kersa 
district in Eastern Ethiopia in 2016. The study utilised exploratory qualitative
