RESULTS: To show the capabilities of APRICOT, we have processed a real magnetic 
resonance image to accurately characterize a prostate cancer using a Message 
Passing Interface cluster deployed automatically with APRICOT. In addition, the 
second example shows how APRICOT scales the deployed infrastructure, according 
to the workload, using a batch cluster. This example consists of a 
multiparametric study of a positron emission tomography image reconstruction.
CONCLUSION: APRICOT's benefits are the integration of specific infrastructure 
deployment, the management and usage for Open Science, making experiments that 
involve specific computational infrastructures reproducible. All the experiment 
steps and details can be documented at the same Jupyter notebook which includes 
infrastructure specifications, data storage, experimentation execution, results 
gathering, and infrastructure termination. Thus, distributing the 
experimentation notebook and needed data should be enough to reproduce the 
experiment.

Myxococcus xanthus arranges into two morphologically distinct biofilms depending 
on its nutritional status, i.e., coordinately spreading colonies in the presence 
of nutrients and spore-filled fruiting bodies in the absence of nutrients. A 
secreted polysaccharide, referred to as exopolysaccharide (EPS), is a structural 
component of both biofilms and is also important for type IV pilus-dependent 
motility and fruiting body formation. Here, we characterize the biosynthetic 
machinery responsible for EPS biosynthesis using bioinformatics, genetics, 
heterologous expression, and biochemical experiments. We show that this 
machinery constitutes a Wzx/Wzy-dependent pathway dedicated to EPS biosynthesis. 
Our data support that EpsZ (MXAN_7415) is the polyisoprenyl-phosphate 
hexose-1-phosphate transferase responsible for the initiation of the repeat unit 
synthesis. Heterologous expression experiments support that EpsZ has 
galactose-1-P transferase activity. Moreover, MXAN_7416, renamed WzxEPS, and 
MXAN_7442, renamed WzyEPS, are the Wzx flippase and Wzy polymerase responsible 
for translocation and polymerization of the EPS repeat unit, respectively. In 
this pathway, EpsV (MXAN_7421) also is the polysaccharide copolymerase and EpsY 
(MXAN_7417) the outer membrane polysaccharide export (OPX) protein. Mutants with 
single in-frame deletions in the five corresponding genes had defects in type IV 
pilus-dependent motility and a conditional defect in fruiting body formation. 
Furthermore, all five mutants were deficient in type IV pilus formation, and 
genetic analyses suggest that EPS and/or the EPS biosynthetic machinery 
stimulates type IV pilus extension. Additionally, we identify a polysaccharide 
biosynthesis gene cluster, which together with an orphan gene encoding an OPX 
protein make up a complete Wzx/Wzy-dependent pathway for synthesis of an unknown 
polysaccharide.IMPORTANCE The secreted polysaccharide referred to as 
exopolysaccharide (EPS) has important functions in the social life cycle of M. 
xanthus; however, little is known about how EPS is synthesized. Here, we 
characterized the EPS biosynthetic machinery and showed that it makes up a 
Wzx/Wzy-dependent pathway for polysaccharide biosynthesis. Mutants lacking a 
component of this pathway had reduced type IV pilus-dependent motility and a 
conditional defect in development. These analyses also suggest that EPS and/or 
the EPS biosynthetic machinery is important for type IV pilus formation.

Vertebral fracture assessment (VFA) is cost-effective when it was incorporated 
in the routine screening for osteoporosis in community-dwelling women aged 
≥ 65 years, which support guidelines, such as the National Osteoporosis 
Foundation (NOF) for the diagnostic use of VFA as an important addition to 
fracture risk assessment.
INTRODUCTION: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of VFA as a screening tool to 
reduce future fracture risk in US community-dwelling women aged ≥ 65 years.
METHODS: An individual-level state-transition cost-effectiveness model from a 
healthcare perspective was constructed using derived data from published 
literature. The time horizon was lifetime. Five screening strategies were 
compared, including no screening at all, central dual-energy X-ray 
absorptiometry (DXA) only, VFA only, central DXA followed by VFA if the femoral 
neck T-score (FN-T) ≤ - 1.5, or if the FN-T ≤ - 1.0. Various initiation ages and 
rescreening intervals were evaluated. Oral bisphosphonate treatment for 5-year 
periods was assumed. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (2017 US dollars per 
quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained) were used as the outcome measure.
RESULTS: The incorporation of VFA slightly increased life expectancy by 
0.1 years and reduced the number of subsequent osteoporotic fractures by 3.7% 
and 7.7% compared with using DXA alone and no screening, respectively, leading 
to approximately 30 billion dollars saved. Regardless of initiation ages and 
rescreening intervals, central DXA followed by VFA if the FN-T ≤ - 1.0 was most 
cost-effective ($40,792 per QALY when the screening is initiated at age 65 years 
and with rescreening every 5 years). Results were robust to change in VF 
incidence and medication costs.
CONCLUSION: In women aged ≥ 65 years, VFA is cost-effective when it was 
incorporated in routine screening for osteoporosis. Our findings support the 
National Osteoporosis Foundation (NOF) guidelines for the diagnostic use of VFA 
as an important addition to fracture risk assessment.

BACKGROUND: Patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma 
(r/r DLBCL) have limited treatment options and poor prognoses. Tisagenlecleucel, 
a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy has shown early promise in 
improving survival outcomes, but at a high upfront cost. This study evaluated 
the cost-effectiveness of tisagenlecleucel versus salvage chemotherapy for 
treating patients with r/r DLBCL who have failed at least 2 lines of systemic 
therapies.
METHODS: A hybrid decision tree and three-state partitioned survival model 
(progression-free (PF), progressive disease and death) was developed from the 
Singapore healthcare payer perspective. Survival curves from JULIET trial and 
CORAL-1 extension study were extrapolated beyond trial period over a 15-year 
time horizon to estimate the underlying progression-free survival and overall 
survival parametric distributions for both arms. Health state utilities were 
retrieved from the literature, and direct costs were sourced from public 
healthcare institutions in Singapore. One-way probabilistic sensitivity analyses 
and scenario analyses were conducted to explore the impact of uncertainties and 
assumptions on cost-effectiveness results.
RESULTS: Compared with salvage chemotherapy, tisagenlecleucel was associated 
with a base-case incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) US$508,530 
(S$686,516) per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained and US$320,200 
(S$432,269) per life year (LY) gained. One-way sensitivity analysis showed the 
ICER was most sensitive to time horizon, PF utility and cost of 
tisagenlecleucel. Scenario analyses confirmed that the ICERs remained high under 
favorable assumptions and substantial price reduction was required to reduce the 
ICER.
CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis showed tisagenlecleucel use in r/r DLBCL patients who 
failed at least 2 prior lines of systemic therapies was associated with 
exceedingly high ICER, which is unlikely to represent good use of healthcare 
resources. Comparative clinical evidence from the ongoing trials might provide 
more insight into future evaluations.

Wallace's Line demarcates a biogeographical boundary between the Indomalaya and 
Australasian ecoregions. Most placental mammalian genera, for example, occur to 
the west of this line, whereas most marsupial genera occur to the east. However, 
macaque monkeys are unusual because they naturally occur on both western and 
eastern sides. To further explore this anomalous distribution, we analyzed 222 
mitochondrial genomes from ∼20 macaque species, including new genomes from 60 
specimens. These comprise a population sampling of most Sulawesi macaques, 
Macaca fascicularis (long-tailed macaques) specimens that were collected by 
Alfred R. Wallace and specimens that were recovered during archaeological 
excavations at Liang Bua, a cave on the Indonesian island of Flores. In 
M. fascicularis, three mitochondrial lineages span the southernmost portion of 
Wallace's Line between Bali and Lombok, and divergences within these lineages 
are contemporaneous with, and possibly mediated by, past dispersals of modern 
human populations. Near the central portion of Wallace's Line between Borneo and 
Sulawesi, a more ancient dispersal of macaques from mainland Asia to Sulawesi 
preceded modern human colonization, which was followed by rapid dispersal of 
matrilines and was subsequently influenced by recent interspecies hybridization. 
In contrast to previous studies, we find no strong signal of recombination in 
most macaque mitochondrial genomes. These findings further characterize macaque 
evolution before and after modern human dispersal throughout Southeast Asia and 
point to possible effects on biodiversity of ancient human cultural diasporas.

BACKGROUND: PDSAFE is an individually-tailored, physiotherapist-delivered, 
balance, strength and strategy training programme aimed at preventing falls 
among people with Parkinson's. We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of PDSAFE 
compared with usual care for people with Parkinson's at higher risk of falling, 
from a UK National Health Service and Personal Social Service perspective.
METHODS: Resource use and quality of life data (EQ-5D-3L) were collected from 
238 participants randomised to the PDSAFE intervention and 236 participants 
randomised to control, at baseline, 3 months, 6 months (primary outcome), and 
12 months. Adjusted cost and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were estimated 
using generalised linear models and uncertainty estimated using a non-parametric 
bootstrap.
RESULTS: Over 6 months, the PDSAFE intervention was associated with an 
incremental cost of £925 (95% CI £428 to £1422) and a very small and 
statistically insignificant QALY gain of 0.008 (95% CI - 0.006 to 0.021). The 
resulting incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was £120,659 per QALY and 
the probability of the intervention being cost-effective at a UK threshold of 
£30,000/QALY was less than 1%. The ICER varied substantially across subgroups 
although no subgroup had an ICER lower than the £30,000 threshold. The result 
was sensitive to the time horizon with the ICER reducing to £55,176 per QALY 
when adopting a 12-month time horizon and assuming a sustained treatment effect 
on QoL, nevertheless, the intervention was still not cost-effective according to 
the current UK threshold.
CONCLUSIONS: Evidence from this trial suggests that the PDSAFE intervention is 
unlikely to be cost-effective at 6 months. The 12-month analysis suggested that 
the intervention became closer to being cost-effective if quality of life 
effects were sustained beyond the intervention period, however this would 
require confirmation. Further research, including qualitative studies, should be 
conducted to better understand the treatment effect of physiotherapy and its 
impact on quality of life in people with Parkinson's given existing mixed 
evidence on this topic.

INTRODUCTION: Complex ureteral obstruction is a pathology that has always been a 
challenge for the urologist, especially in patients with high surgical risk or 
with a short life expectancy.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Between 2002 and 2017, 13 extra-anatomical bypasses were 
placed. A descriptive retrospective study was carried out. An analysis of the 
permeability time of the prosthesis was performed using Kaplan-Meyer curves. 
Demographic and etiological characteristics as well as early and late 
complications were analysed.
RESULTS: Etiologies were benign in 39% (including 3 transplant recipients) and 
malignant in 69%. Permeability rates were 90.9% at each of 12, 24 and 48 months, 
respectively, and 75.8% at 60 months. There were no deaths in the early 
postoperative period, nor intraoperative complications. The most frequent 
complications were infections. Three of them were associated with bypass 
extrusion, which needed to be removed. A total of 5 prosthesis had to be 
removed. 40% of the patients did not present complications.
CONCLUSIONS: The extra-anatomical ureteral bypass is an alternative to permanent 
nephrostomy in the treatment of complex ureteral strictures. Their patency rates 
after long-term follow-up vary from 90% to 75% at 48 and 60 months, 
respectively. Their complication rates can be considered acceptable in the 
patients' clinical contexts.

OBJECTIVES: To determine whether depression and anxiety are associated with 
advance care planning (ACP) engagement or values concerning future medical care.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional.
PARTICIPANTS: English- and Spanish-speaking patients, aged 55 years and older, 
from a San Francisco, CA, county hospital.
MEASURES: Depression was measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire 8-item 
scale, and anxiety was measured by the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item 
scale, using standardized cutoffs of 10 or more for moderate-to-severe symptoms. 
ACP engagement was measured using validated surveys of ACP behavior change 
(e.g., self-efficacy and readiness; mean five-point Likert score) and ACP 
actions (e.g., ask, discuss, and document wishes; 0- to 25-point scale), with 
higher scores representing higher engagement. In addition, we asked a question 
about valuing life extension ("some health situations would make life not worth 
living"). We used adjusted linear and logistic regression.
RESULTS: Mean age of 986 participants was 63 years, 81% were non-White, 39% had 
limited health literacy, 45% were Spanish speaking, 13% had depression, and 10% 
had anxiety. After adjustment for demographic and health status variables, 
participants who were depressed versus not depressed had higher ACP behavior 
change scores (0.2 points; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.06-0.38; P = .007), 
higher ACP action scores (1.5 points; 95% CI = 0.51-2.57; P = .003), and higher 
odds of not valuing life extension (odds ratio (OR) = 2.5; 95% CI = 1.5-4.3; 
P < .001). Results were similar in participants with versus without anxiety (ACP 
behavior change: 0.2 points; 95% CI = 0.05-0.40; P = .01; ACP action scores: 1.2 
points; 95% CI = 0.14-2.32; P = .028; odds of not valuing life extension: OR = 
2.3; 95% CI = 1.3-3.9; P = .004).
CONCLUSION: Depression and anxiety were associated with greater ACP engagement 
and not valuing life extension. Although the direction of association between 
ACP engagement and values with anxiety and depression cannot be determined in 
this cross-sectional study, these conditions may influence ACP preferences. 
Future studies should assess whether changes in anxiety or depression affect ACP 
preferences over time.

Advance care planning is considered an important part of high-quality 
end-of-life care. Its cost-effectiveness is currently unknown. In this study, we 
explore the cost-effectiveness of a strategy, in which advance care planning is 
offered systematically to older people at the end-of-life compared with standard 
care. We conducted decision-analytic modelling. The perspective was health and 
social care and the time horizon was 1 year. Outcomes included were 
quality-adjusted life years as they referred to the surviving carers. Data 
sources included published studies, national statistics and expert views. 
Average total cost in the advance care planning versus standard care group was 
£3,739 versus £3,069. The quality-adjusted life year gain to carers was 0.03 for 
the intervention in comparison with the standard care group. Based on carer's 
health-related quality-of-life, the average cost per quality-adjusted life year 
was £18,965. The probability that the intervention was cost-effective was 55% 
(70%) at a cost per quality-adjusted life year threshold of £20,000 (£30,000). 
Conducting cost-effectiveness analysis for advance care planning is challenging 
due to uncertainties in practice and research, such as a lack of agreement on 
how advance care planning should be provided and by whom (which influences its 
costs), and about relevant beneficiary groups (which influences its outcomes). 
However, even when assuming relatively high costs for the delivery of advance 
care planning and only one beneficiary group, namely, family carers, our 
analysis showed that advance care planning was probably cost-effective.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the toxicity reduction required to justify the added 
costs of MRI-guided radiotherapy (MR-IGRT) over CT-based image guided 
radiotherapy (CT-IGRT) for the treatment of localized prostate cancer.
METHODS: The costs of delivering prostate cancer radiotherapy with MR-IGRT and 
CT-IGRT in conventional 39 fractions and stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) 5 
fractions schedules were determined using literature values and cost accounting 
from two institutions. Gastrointestinal and genitourinary toxicity rates 
associated with CT-IGRT were summarized from 20 studies. Toxicity-related costs 
and utilities were obtained from literature values and cost databases. Markov 
modeling was used to determine the savings per patient for every 1% relative 
reduction in acute and chronic toxicities by MR-IGRT over 15 years. The costs 
and quality adjusted life years (QALYs) saved with toxicity reduction were 
juxtaposed with the cost increase of MR-IGRT to determine toxicity reduction 
thresholds for cost-effectiveness. One way sensitivity analyses were performed. 
Standard $100,000 and $50,000 per QALY ratios were used.
RESULTS: The added cost of MR-IGRT was $1,459 per course of SBRT and $10,129 per 
course of conventionally fractionated radiotherapy. Relative toxicity reductions 
of 7 and 14% are required for SBRT to be cost-effective using $100,000 and 
$50,000 per QALY, respectively. Conventional radiotherapy requires relative 
toxicity reductions of 50 and 94% to be cost-effective.
CONCLUSION: From a healthcare perspective, MR-IGRT can reasonably be expected to 
be cost-effective. Hypofractionated schedules, such a five fraction SBRT, are 
most likely to be cost-effective as they require only slight reductions in 
toxicity (7-14%).
ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: This is the first detailed economic assessment of 
MR-IGRT, and it suggests that MR-IGRT can be cost-effective for prostate cancer 
treatment through toxicity reduction alone.

Disinfection byproducts (DBPs) in drinking water is an issue in many countries. 
Many DBPs are possible or probable human carcinogens while few DBPs pose cyto- 
and genotoxic effects to the mammalian cells. The populations are likely to 
consume DBPs with drinking water throughout their lifetimes. A number of DBPs 
are regulated in many countries to protect humans. In this study, human 
exposure, risk and disability-adjusted life years (DALY) were predicted from 
DBPs in multiple water supply systems, including groundwater (GW), desalinated 
water (DW) and blend water (BW). The averages of lifetime excess cancer risks 
from GW, DW and BW were 4.15 × 10-6, 1.75 × 10-5 and 2.59 × 10-5 respectively. 
The populations in age groups of 0 - <2, 2-16 and >16 years contributed 
25.4-25.7%, 28.6-29.6% and 45.0-45.7% to the total risks respectively. The DALY 
from GW, DW and BW were estimated to be 5.8, 27.0 and 39.9 years, respectively 
while the corresponding financial burdens were US$ 0.63, 2.93 and 4.34 million 
respectively. The findings are likely to assist in selecting the supply water 
sources to better control human exposure and risk from DBPs.

INTRODUCTION: In Africa, travels, urbanisation and changing consumer habits are 
increasing the number of people buying and eating food prepared/sold at public 
spaces including transport stations, particularly in the urban and periurban 
areas. Although food trading in such public spaces serves as a source of 
livelihood for many people, unsafe food can have a negative impact on health. 
We, therefore, aim to systematically explore and examine the literature, and 
describe the evidence on food safety (food handling, storage, preparation and 
sale, packaging of food when sold, hygiene of sale venue and quality (nutrition) 
of food sold/purchased/eaten) at transport stations to inform policy, as well as 
identify research gaps for future studies in Africa.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will employ the Arksey & O'Malley framework, Levac et 
al recommendations and the Joanna Briggs Institute guidelines to guide this 
study. We will conduct a comprehensive search in PubMed, SCOPUS, Web of Science, 
Google Scholar and EBSCOhost (Academic search complete, CINAHL with Full-text 
and Health Source) from inception to December 2019 for relevant peer-review 
articles using a combination of keywords/search terms with no limitations. We 
will also search for relevant literature from the reference list of all included 
articles. Two investigators will independently screen the articles in parallel 
at the abstract and full-text phases using the eligibility criteria as a guide. 
Data extraction will be done using a piloted data extraction form designed in a 
Microsoft Word tabular format. Afterward, the extracted data will be collated 
into themes and subthemes, summarised, and the results reported using a 
narrative approach. We will the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews 
and Meta-analyses: Extension for scoping reviews checklist to report this study 
results.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethics approval is not required. All sources of data 
will be adequately cited and added to the reference list. We will present the 
final scoping review results at the appropriate workshops, meetings, 
conferences, as well as submit for peer-review and publication in a scientific 
journal.

INTRODUCTION: Investment in early childhood produces positive returns: for the 
child, the family and the community. Benefits have been shown to be significant 
within certain parameters, but a systematic review of the economic evidence 
across multiple sectors including health, education and social welfare will have 
the capacity to inform policy relative to the full range of social determinants. 
This review will take a broad approach, encompassing a range of costs and 
benefits to enable the identification of the most beneficial investments in 
early childhood and to highlight gaps in current research.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Economic evaluations incorporating both costs and 
long-term outcomes of early childhood interventions and programmes will be 
included. Outcomes may be valued in monetary units or quantified non-monetary 
units (eg, quality-adjusted life years (QALY), disability-adjusted life years 
(DALY)). Results will be expressed as a ratio according to the outcome; with 
monetary outcomes expressed as cost-benefit ratios or return on investment, and 
non-monetary outcomes expressed as cost per QALY or DALY. The target population 
is children aged 0-5 years.Extensive database searches across sectors will be 
undertaken. The review will involve five phases: defining the research question, 
identifying relevant studies, selecting studies, extracting and collating data, 
and summarising and reporting results. The search commenced in 2019 and the 
expected end date is December 2020.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The findings of this review will inform policymakers 
and practitioners in public health, education, social welfare and primary care 
settings. The publication plan includes a series of academic publications, and 
policy papers prepared and disseminated through Telethon Kids Institute 
networks. Exemption from ethics approval was granted by the University of 
Western Australia Human Ethics Office (RA/4/20/5677).

Compounds from spices and herbs extracts are being explored as natural 
antibacterial additives. A plant extract used in traditional folk medicine is 
Hibiscus sabdariffa L., also known as Roselle. Therefore, the potential use of a 
phenolic hibiscus extract as antibacterial or natural food preservative was 
analyzed in vitro and in situ. A phenolic extract was obtained from hibiscus 
calyces and fractionated, and then the fractions were tested against foodborne 
pathogen bacteria. Liquid-liquid extraction and solid-phase extraction were used 
to fractionate the hibiscus extract, and HPLC was employed to analyze the 
fractions' phenolic composition. Minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) and 
minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) were calculated for brute hibiscus 
phenolic extract, each of the fractions and pure commercial phenolic compounds. 
Bacteria tested were Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, 
Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes and Bacillus cereus. The fraction 
obtained after liquid-liquid extraction presented the best performance of MBC 
and MIC against the bacteria tested. Furthermore, a hibiscus ethanolic extract 
was employed as a natural preservative to extend the shelf-life of beef. 
Microbiological, color and sensory analyses were performed to the meat during 
the shelf-life test. The application of the phenolic hibiscus extract also 
showed an increase of the duration of the meat`s shelf life.

Gender Differences in Kinematic Parameters of Topspin Forehand and Backhand in 
Table Tennis.

Italy.

Background: The identification of gender differences in kinematics and 
coordination of movement in different body segments in sports may improve the 
training process by emphasizing the necessity of its differentiation, and 
consequently individualization, developing, and improving the technique in women 
and men. Indicating differences can also help in determining the risk of injury 
in order to prevent from them by diversifying training programs. However, there 
is no information regarding this problem in the existing literature pertaining 
to table tennis. Therefore, the aim of the study was to evaluate the differences 
in the values of selected angular and kinematic parameters during topspin 
forehand and topspin backhand shots between male and female table tennis 
players. Methods: Six male and six female advanced table tennis players 
performed topspin forehand and topspin backhand shots, both receiving a backspin 
ball. The angular parameters in four events (ready position, backswing, maximum 
acceleration, and forward) at chosen joints as well as the maximal acceleration 
of the playing hand were measured, using the myoMotion system, and were compared 
between male and female players. Results: Significant differences (p ≤ 0.05) 
were found in the magnitude of angular parameters and maximum hand acceleration 
between men and women. The movement pattern of topspin strokes performed by men 
takes into account, more than that in the case of women, movements that use 
large muscle groups and large joints (hip joints, trunk joints, shoulder joints 
in extension, and flexion). The difference in the values of maximal acceleration 
reached almost 50 m/s2 in topspin forehand (p < 0.01) and 20 m/s2 in backhand (p 
< 0.01). Conclusions: Differentiation of movement patterns can be a 
manifestation of movement optimization due to anthropological differences and 
limitations. The differences in the values of maximal acceleration suggest that 
women could use both sides to perform a topspin attack against the backspin 
ball, while men should seek opportunities to make a stronger shot with a 
forehand topspin.

To simulate today's complex tribo-contact scenarios, a methodological breakdown 
of a complex design problem into simpler sub-problems is essential to achieve 
acceptable simulation outcomes. This also helps to manage iterative, 
hierarchical systems within given computational power. In this paper, the 
authors reviewed recent trends of simulation practices in tribology to model 
tribo-contact scenario and life cycle assessment (LCA) with the help of 
simulation. With the advancement of modern computers and computing power, 
increasing effort has been given towards simulation, which not only saves time 
and resources but also provides meaningful results. Having said that, like every 
other technique, simulation has some inherent limitations which need to be 
considered during practice. Keeping this in mind, the pros and cons of both 
physical experiments and simulation approaches are reviewed together with their 
interdependency and how one approach can benefit the other. Various simulation 
techniques are outlined with a focus on machine learning which will dominate 
simulation approaches in the future. In addition, simulation of tribo-contacts 
across different length scales and lubrication conditions is discussed in 
detail. An extension of the simulation approach, together with experimental 
data, can lead towards LCA of components which will provide us with a better 
understanding of the efficient usage of limited resources and conservation of 
both energy and resources.

Chine, 75020 Paris, France.

Background and objectives: Hip fracture is a major public health issue. Those 
fractures lead to high costs and a decrease in quality of life. A national 
French survey was conducted, with the objectives to firstly assess the current 
management of hip fracture and its prevention, both in the osteoporotic and 
cancer settings, and secondly to evaluate the opinions of physicians on the 
potential use of minimally invasive implantable devices to prevent hip fracture 
in alternative of surgery. Materials and methods: This national survey was 
conducted in France between April and July 2017. Questionnaires were sent to 
orthopedic surgeons, interventional radiologists, oncologists, and 
rheumatologists. Completed questionnaires were analyzed and compared according 
to two indications: orthopedics-traumatology and oncology. Factors associated 
with these responses were assessed using univariable analyses, based on 
chi-square tests or an exact Fisher test, as appropriate. Results: A total of 
182 questionnaires were completed and further analyzed. Physicians have 
highlighted the need for a low re-fracture rate and to improve life expectancy 
for more than 1 year (50% for responders of the orthopedics-traumatology 
questionnaire and 80% for the responders interested in both indications), as 
well as quality of life (12.5% and 31%, respectively), but with no significant 
differences in the oncologic indication. Most of the experts were willing to use 
or prescribe implantable devices for prevention (63% in orthopedics-traumatology 
and 93% in oncology), although limited clinical experience (54 and 58%) and 
surgical risk (around 30% in each indication) were considered as limits. 
Conclusions: Prevention of hip fracture remains a concern for physicians. More 
clinical experience with implantable devices, in particular in cancer patients, 
is needed, but implemented in a strategy to maximize patient recovery while 
reducing costs.

Pursuing the Elixir of Life: In Vivo Antioxidative Effects of Manganosalen 
Complexes.

Rouco L(1), González-Noya AM(2), Pedrido R(2), Maneiro M(1).

Manganosalen complexes are coordination compounds that possess a chelating 
salen-type ligand, a class of bis-Schiff bases obtained by condensation of 
salicylaldehyde and a diamine. They may act as catalytic antioxidants mimicking 
both the structure and the reactivity of the native antioxidant enzymes active 
site. Thus, manganosalen complexes have been shown to exhibit superoxide 
dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase activities, and they could 
potentially facilitate the scavenging of excess reactive oxygen species (ROS), 
thereby restoring the redox balance in damaged cells and organs. Initial 
catalytic studies compared the potency of these compounds as antioxidants in 
terms of rate constants of the chemical reactivity against ROS, giving catalytic 
values approaching and even exceeding that of the native antioxidative enzymes. 
Although most of these catalytic studies lack of biological relevance, 
subsequent in vitro studies have confirmed the efficiency of many manganosalen 
complexes in oxidative stress models. These synthetic catalytic scavengers, 
cheaper than natural antioxidants, have accordingly attracted intensive 
attention for the therapy of ROS-mediated injuries. The aim of this review is to 
focus on in vivo studies performed on manganosalen complexes and their activity 
on the treatment of several pathological disorders associated with oxidative 
damage. These disorders, ranging from the prevention of fetal malformations to 
the extension of lifespan, include neurodegenerative, inflammatory, and 
cardiovascular diseases; tissue injury; and other damages related to the liver, 
kidney, or lungs.

The sociodemographic index (SDI), a composite index per capita income, 
educational attainment, and total fertility rate in a country, can indicate 
whether the country's burden of disease varies depending upon its level of 
socioeconomic development. This study identified the subnational SDI and disease 
burden of South Korea based on the country's overall SDI, using national 
representative data. The burden of disease was measured using 
disability-adjusted life years (DALY) with an incidence-based approach. We used 
National Health Insurance Services claims data to estimate the years lived with 
disability (YLD) and cause-of-death statistics to estimate the years of life 
lost (YLL). Indicators of subnational SDI were also extracted. The Korean 
subnational SDIs for 250 regions were correlated with YLL, YLD, and DALY for the 
year 2016. The correlation between SDI and YLL was stronger in big cities than 
in medium areas and small areas. Moreover, the higher the SDI, the higher the 
coefficient. The SDI should be used as a standard for interpreting and comparing 
regions' disease burden at the subnational level.

The psyllid Cacopsylla chinensis (Yang & Li) (Hemiptera: Psyllidae) is a serious 
pest of pears in China. To determine and contrast the fitness of the psyllid on 
two endemic cultivars of Pyrus bretschneideri (i.e., BHXS and BSL) and two 
introduced cultivars of Pyrus communis (i.e., CB and CRB), we analyzed data on
