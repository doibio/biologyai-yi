ischaemic attack, including residents with communication and cognitive 
impairments, not receiving end-of-life care.
INTERVENTION: Personalised 3-month course of OT delivered by qualified 
therapists. Care workers participated in training workshops to support personal 
activities of daily living. The control condition consisted of usual care for 
residents.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Outcome data were collected by a blinded assessor. The 
primary outcome at the participant level was the Barthel Index of Activities of 
Daily Living (BI) score at 3 months. The secondary outcomes included BI scores 
at 6 and 12 months post randomisation, and the Rivermead Mobility Index, 
Geriatric Depression Scale-15 and European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions, three 
levels, questionnaire scores at all time points. Economic evaluation examined 
the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gain. Costs were 
estimated from the perspective of the NHS and Personal Social Services.
RESULTS: Overall, 568 residents from 114 care homes were allocated to the 
intervention arm and 474 residents from another 114 care homes were allocated to 
the control arm, giving a total of 1042 participants. Randomisation occurred 
between May 2010 and March 2012. The mean age of participants was 82.9 years, 
and 665 (64%) were female. No adverse events attributable to the intervention 
were recorded. Of the 1042 participants, 870 (83%) were included in the analysis 
of the primary outcome (intervention, n = 479; control, n = 391). The primary 
outcome showed no significant differences between groups. The adjusted mean 
difference in the BI score between groups was 0.19 points higher in the 
intervention arm [95% confidence interval (CI) -0.33 to 0.70, p = 0.48; adjusted 
intracluster correlation coefficient 0.09]. Secondary outcome measures showed no 
significant differences at all time points. Mean incremental cost of the 
Occupational Therapy intervention for residents with stroke living in UK Care 
Homes intervention was £438.78 (95% CI -£3360.89 to £1238.46) and the 
incremental QALY gain was 0.009 (95% CI -0.030 to 0.048).
LIMITATIONS: A large proportion of participants with very severe activity-based 
limitations and cognitive impairment may have limited capacity to engage in 
therapy.
CONCLUSION: A 3-month individualised course of OT showed no benefit in 
maintaining functional activity in an older care home population with 
stroke-related disabilities.
FUTURE WORK: There is an urgent need to reduce health-related complications 
caused by inactivity and to provide an enabling built environment within care 
homes.

To evaluate the burden of air pollution on years of life lost (YLL) in addition 
to mortality, we conducted a time series analysis based on the data on air 
pollution, meteorological conditions and 163,704 non-accidental deaths of 
Ningbo, China, 2009-2013. The mean concentrations of particulate matter with 
aerodynamic diameter <10 μm, particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter 
<2.5 μm, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide were 84.0 μg/m(3), 60.1 μg/m(3), 
25.1 μg/m(3) and 41.7 μg/m(3), respectively. An increase of 10-μg/m(3) in 
particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter <10 μm, particulate matter with 
aerodynamic diameter <2.5 μm, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide was associated 
with 4.27 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.17-7.38), 2.97 (95% CI -2.01-7.95), 
29.98 (95% CI 19.21-40.76) and 16.58 (95% CI 8.19-24.97) YLL, respectively, and 
0.53% (95% CI 0.29-0.76%), 0.57% (95% CI 0.20-0.95%), 2.89% (95% CI 2.04-3.76%), 
and 1.65% (95% CI 1.01-2.30%) increase of daily death counts, respectively. The 
impact of air pollution lasted for four days (lag 0-3), and were more 
significant in the elderly than in the young population for both outcomes. These 
findings clarify the burden of air pollution on YLL and highlight the importance 
and urgency of air pollution control in China.

    Arthroscopy. 2016 Jul;32(7):1245-6.

PURPOSE: To perform a cost-utility analysis to determine if the use of 
platelet-rich plasma (PRP) products during arthroscopic rotator cuff repair 
(RCR) is cost-effective.
METHODS: A cost-utility analysis was conducted using a Markov decision model. 
Model inputs including health utility values, retear rates, and transition 
probabilities were derived from the best evidence available in the literature 
regarding full-thickness rotator cuff tears and their repair, as well as the 
augmentation of their repair with PRP. Costs were determined by examining the 
typical patient undergoing treatment for a full-thickness rotator cuff tear in a 
private orthopaedic clinic and outpatient surgery center.
RESULTS: The cost per quality-adjusted life-year ($/QALY) of RCR with and 
without PRP was $6,775/QALY and $6,612/QALY, respectively. In our base case, the 
use of PRP to augment RCR was not cost-effective because it had exactly the same 
"effectiveness" as RCR without PRP augmentation while being associated with a 
higher cost (additional $750). Sensitivity analysis showed that to achieve a 
willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000/QALY, the addition of PRP would need to 
be associated with a 9.1% reduction in retear rates. If the cost of PRP were 
increased to $1,000, the retear rate would need to be reduced by 12.1% to reach 
this same threshold. This compared with a necessary reduction of only 6.1% if 
the additional cost of PRP was $500.
CONCLUSIONS: This cost-utility analysis shows that, currently, the use of PRP to 
augment RCR is not cost-effective. Sensitivity analysis showed that 
PRP-augmented repairs would have to show a reduced retear rate of at least 9.1% 
before the additional cost would be considered cost-effective.
LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III, analysis of Level I, II, and III studies.

ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Infection by intestinal parasitic worms 
(soil-transmitted helminths or geohelminths) is prevalent in many parts of the 
world, and poses a particular health risk to children. This paper presents 
findings from a preliminary study with the primary aim to document indigenous 
knowledge about the use of herbal medicines in the treatment of intestinal worm 
infections in children among the local communities of Kalat district of northern 
Balochistan, Pakistan.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ethnomedicinal data were collected through a 
triangulation approach, that included participant-observation and rapid 
appraisal methods. Prior-informed consent (PIC) was obtained from participants 
before conducting structured and semi-structured interviews and delivering an 
open ended questionnaire. A total of 94 participants, including 28 men (of whom 
7 were traditional healers), and 66 women of four different age groups were 
interviewed. Results were analyzed using quantitative indices of Use Value 
citations (UVC) and Disease-Consensus Index (DCI).
RESULTS: Fewer men than women agreed to be interviewed, thus overall women in 
the area appeared to have more ethnomedicinal knowledge. The majority of study 
participants belonged to the older age group (>55 years). A total of 49 plant 
species, belonging to 47 genera, distributed in 30 families were reported. The 
families Asteraceae and Lamiaceae were most frequently represented, with four 
species each. Trees were the most common life form, with seeds the most 
frequently cited plant part used (29%). Nearly a third (31%) of plant-based 
remedies reported in the treatment of intestinal worms were administered as a 
decoction. The highest UVC and DCI was reported for the species Ferula 
assa-foetida sL. (UVC 0.51, DCI 0.46).
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides previously unreported data on the use of 
medicinal plants in the treatment of geohelminth infections in children of 
Kalat. Eight species, Acacia modesta Wall., Asparagus capitatus Baker, 
Microcephala lamellata (Bunge) Pobed., Nepeta praetervisa Rech.f., Plantago 
ciliata Desf., Pistacia atlantica Desf., Seriphidium quettense (Podlech) 
Y.R.Ling and Thymus linearis Benth. are reported here as anthelmintics for the 
first time. Detailed studies on the anthelmintic activity of chemical 
constituents of these species are lacking from existing literature. Further 
phytochemical, pharmacological and toxicity studies are required in order to 
evaluate the efficacy and safety of these newly reported anthelmintic species. 
These plants may provide a source of novel anthelmintic drug leads, which are 
urgently required due to the problem of global anthelmintic resistance.

Vici syndrome [OMIM242840] is a severe, recessively inherited congenital 
disorder characterized by the principal features of callosal agenesis, 
cataracts, oculocutaneous hypopigmentation, cardiomyopathy, and a combined 
immunodeficiency. Profound developmental delay, progressive failure to thrive 
and acquired microcephaly are almost universal, suggesting an evolving (neuro) 
degenerative component. In most patients there is additional variable 
multisystem involvement that may affect virtually any organ system, including 
lungs, thyroid, liver and kidneys. A skeletal myopathy is consistently 
associated, and characterized by marked fibre type disproportion, increase in 
internal nuclei, numerous vacuoles, abnormal mitochondria and glycogen storage. 
Life expectancy is markedly reduced.Vici syndrome is due to recessive mutations 
in EPG5 on chromosome 18q12.3, encoding ectopic P granules protein 5 (EPG5), a 
key autophagy regulator in higher organisms. Autophagy is a fundamental cellular 
degradative pathway conserved throughout evolution with important roles in the 
removal of defective proteins and organelles, defence against infections and 
adaptation to changing metabolic demands. Almost 40 EPG mutations have been 
identified to date, most of them truncating and private to individual 
families.The differential diagnosis of Vici syndrome includes a number of 
syndromes with overlapping clinical features, neurological and metabolic 
disorders with shared CNS abnormalities (in particular callosal agenesis), and 
primary neuromuscular disorders with a similar muscle biopsy appearance. Vici 
syndrome is also the most typical example of a novel group of inherited 
neurometabolic conditions, congenital disorders of autophagy.Management is 
currently largely supportive and symptomatic but better understanding of the 
underlying autophagy defect will hopefully inform the development of targeted 
therapies in future.

OBJECTIVES: What explains increases in BMI (and obesity) over time and across 
countries? Although many microeconomic forces are likely explanations, 
increasingly scholars are arguing that macroeconomic forces such as market 
liberalism and globalization are root causes of the obesity epidemic. The 
purpose of this paper is to examine the impact of economic freedom on obesity 
conditional on the level of income and other factors.
STUDY DESIGN: We use an unbalanced pooled cross section of up to 135 countries 
for 1995 and 2000-2009.
METHODS: Our statistical model specifications include pooled OLS and fixed 
effects.
RESULTS: First, we find that controlling for fixed effects siphons off much of 
the relationship previously documented between economic freedom and BMI. Second, 
economic freedom is associated with slightly higher BMIs but only for men in 
developing nations. Lastly, we show that economic freedom increases life 
expectancy for both men and women in developing countries.
CONCLUSION: Therefore, policies aimed at reducing obesity that limit economic 
liberalism may come at the expense of life expectancy in the developing world.

We provide male and female census count data, age-specific survivorship, and 
female age-specific fertility estimates for populations of seven wild primates 
that have been continuously monitored for at least 29 years: sifaka (Propithecus 
verreauxi) in Madagascar; muriqui (Brachyteles hypoxanthus) in Brazil; capuchin 
(Cebus capucinus) in Costa Rica; baboon (Papio cynocephalus) and blue monkey 
(Cercopithecus mitis) in Kenya; chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) in Tanzania; and 
gorilla (Gorilla beringei) in Rwanda. Using one-year age-class intervals, we 
computed point estimates of age-specific survival for both sexes. In all 
species, our survival estimates for the dispersing sex are affected by heavy 
censoring. We also calculated reproductive value, life expectancy, and mortality 
hazards for females. We used bootstrapping to place confidence intervals on 
life-table summary metrics (R0, the net reproductive rate; λ, the population 
growth rate; and G, the generation time). These data have high potential for 
reuse; they derive from continuous population monitoring of long-lived organisms 
and will be invaluable for addressing questions about comparative demography, 
primate conservation and human evolution.

DNA-methylation (DNAm) levels at age-associated CpG sites can be combined into 
epigenetic aging signatures to estimate donor age. It has been demonstrated that 
the difference between such epigenetic age-predictions and chronological age is 
indicative for of all-cause mortality in later life. In this study, we tested 
alternative epigenetic signatures and followed the hypothesis that even 
individual age-associated CpG sites might be indicative for life-expectancy. 
Using a 99-CpG aging model, a five-year higher age-prediction was associated 
with 11% greater mortality risk in DNAm profiles of the Lothian Birth Cohort 
1921 study. However, models based on three CpGs, or even individual CpGs, 
generally revealed very high offsets in age-predictions if applied to 
independent microarray datasets. On the other hand, we demonstrate that DNAm 
levels at several individual age-associated CpGs seem to be associated with life 
expectancy - e.g., at CpGs associated with the genesPDE4C and CLCN6. Our results 
support the notion that small aging signatures should rather be analysed by more 
quantitative methods, such as site-specific pyrosequencing, as the precision of 
age-predictions is rather low on independent microarray datasets. Nevertheless, 
the results hold the perspective that simple epigenetic biomarkers, based on few 
or individual age-associated CpGs, could assist the estimation of biological 
age.

Design considerations and challenges for mechanical stretch bioreactors in 
tissue engineering.

Lei Y(1), Ferdous Z(1).

Tennessee, Knoxville, TN, 37996.

With the increase in average life expectancy and growing aging population, lack 
of functional grafts for replacement surgeries has become a severe problem. 
Engineered tissues are a promising alternative to this problem because they can 
mimic the physiological function of the native tissues and be cultured on 
demand. Cyclic stretch is important for developing many engineered tissues such 
as hearts, heart valves, muscles, and bones. Thus a variety of stretch 
bioreactors and corresponding scaffolds have been designed and tested to study 
the underlying mechanism of tissue formation and to optimize the mechanical 
conditions applied to the engineered tissues. In this review, we look at various 
designs of stretch bioreactors and common scaffolds and offer insights for 
future improvements in tissue engineering applications. First, we summarize the 
requirements and common configuration of stretch bioreactors. Next, we present 
the features of different actuating and motion transforming systems and their 
applications. Since most bioreactors must measure detailed distributions of 
loads and deformations on engineered tissues, techniques with high accuracy, 
precision, and frequency have been developed. We also cover the key points in 
designing culture chambers, nutrition exchanging systems, and regimens used for 
specific tissues. Since scaffolds are essential for providing biophysical 
microenvironments for residing cells, we discuss materials and technologies used 
in fabricating scaffolds to mimic anisotropic native tissues, including 
decellularized tissues, hydrogels, biocompatible polymers, electrospinning, and 
3D bioprinting techniques. Finally, we present the potential future directions 
for improving stretch bioreactors and scaffolds. © 2016 American Institute of

Erythrocyte drug encapsulation is one of the most promising therapeutic 
alternative approaches for the administration of toxic or rapidly cleared drugs. 
Drug-loaded erythrocytes can operate through one of the three main mechanisms of 
action: extension of circulation half-life (bioreactor), slow drug release, or 
specific organ targeting. Although the clinical development of erythrocyte 
carriers is confronted with regulatory and development process challenges, 
industrial development is expanding. The manufacture of this type of product can 
be either centralized or bedside based, and different procedures are employed 
for the encapsulation of therapeutic agents. The major challenges for successful 
industrialization include production scalability, process validation, and 
quality control of the released therapeutic agents. Advantages and drawbacks of 
the different manufacturing processes as well as success key points of clinical 
development are discussed. Several entrapment technologies based on osmotic 
methods have been industrialized. Companies have already achieved many of the 
critical clinical stages, thus providing the opportunity in the future to cover 
a wide range of diseases for which effective therapies are not currently 
available.

This literature review examines available evidence on the current and past costs 
associated with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in Italy, together with the future 
health-economic prospects for the disease. Studies have been conducted to date 
on the prevalence, or the associated costs, of RA in Italy. Although future 
changes in the incidence of RA are a matter of debate, the impact of RA on 
health care costs is expected to grow in coming decades in line with projected 
increases in life expectancy and in the proportion of elderly people in Italy. 
It has been estimated that the indirect (productivity loss and informal care) 
and intangible (deterioration in health-related quality of life) costs of the 
disease will contribute to an increase in national health service expenditure, 
which will correspond to 1% of the total health care costs of the nation in the 
near future. The introduction of biological agents for the treatment of 
rheumatic diseases has resulted in an increase in the direct costs of RA; 
however, economic analyses that exclude indirect costs will underestimate the 
full economic impact of RA. The effectiveness of innovative therapies in 
preventing disease progression and functional impairment may, over time, 
attenuate the cost impact of RA in terms of hospitalizations and work 
absenteeism. Further research is needed to develop estimates of the economic 
impact of different therapeutic approaches in patients with RA in Italy, in 
order to provide tools that can drive the choice of the most cost-effective 
therapeutic option while maintaining high-quality care.

We have developed a unique long-acting drug-delivery system for the GLP-1 
agonist exenatide. The peptide was covalently attached to Tetra-PEG hydrogel 
microspheres by a cleavable β-eliminative linker; upon s.c. injection, the 
exenatide is slowly released at a rate dictated by the linker. A second 
β-eliminative linker with a slower cleavage rate was incorporated in polymer 
cross-links to trigger gel degradation after drug release. The uniform 40 μm 
microspheres were fabricated using a flow-focusing microfluidic device and in 
situ polymerization within droplets. The exenatide-laden microspheres were 
injected subcutaneously into the rat, and serum exenatide measured over a 
one-month period. Pharmacokinetic analysis showed a t1/2,β of released exenatide 
of about 7 days which represents over a 300-fold half-life extension in the rat 
and exceeds the half-life of any currently approved long-acting GLP-1 agonist. 
Hydrogel-exenatide conjugates gave an excellent Level A in vitro-in vivo 
correlation of release rates of the peptide from the gel, and indicated that 
exenatide release was 3-fold faster in vivo than in vitro. Pharmacokinetic 
simulations indicate that the hydrogel-exenatide microspheres should support 
weekly or biweekly subcutaneous dosing in humans. The rare ability to modify in 
vivo pharmacokinetics by the chemical nature of the linker indicates that an 
even longer acting exenatide is feasible.

BACKGROUND: Care-home residents are mostly inactive, have little interaction 
with staff, and are dependent on staff to engage in daily occupations. We 
recently developed an iPad application called the Aid for Decision-making in 
Occupation Choice (ADOC) to promote shared decision-making in activities and 
occupation-based goal setting by choosing from illustrations describing daily 
activities. This study aimed to evaluate if interventions based on 
occupation-based goal setting using the ADOC could focus on meaningful 
activities to improve quality of life and independent activities of daily 
living, with greater cost-effectiveness than an impairment-based approach as 
well as to evaluate the feasibility of conducting a large cluster, randomized 
controlled trial.
METHOD: In this single (assessor)-blind pilot cluster randomized controlled 
trial, the intervention group (ADOC group) received occupational therapy based 
on occupation-based goal setting using the ADOC, and the interventions were 
focused on meaningful occupations. The control group underwent an 
impairment-based approach focused on restoring capacities, without goal setting 
tools. In both groups, the 20-minute individualized intervention sessions were 
conducted twice a week for 4 months.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Short Form-36 (SF-36) score, SF-6D utility score, quality 
adjusted life years (QALY), Barthel Index, and total care cost.
RESULTS: We randomized and analyzed 12 facilities (44 participants, 18.5% 
drop-out rate), with 6 facilities each allocated to the ADOC (n = 23) and 
control (n = 21) groups. After the 4-month intervention, the ADOC group had a 
significantly greater change in the BI score, with improved scores (P = 0.027, 
95% CI 0.41 to 6.87, intracluster correlation coefficient = 0.14). No other 
outcome was significantly different. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, 
calculated using the change in BI score, was $63.1.
CONCLUSION: The results suggest that occupational therapy using the ADOC for 
older residents might be effective and cost-effective. We also found that 
conducting an RCT in the occupational therapy setting is feasible.

INTRODUCTION: Psychiatric disease is overlooked in drug users. Patients with 
both drug abuse and a psychiatric disease - dual diagnosis - suffer decreased 
compliance to treatment and decreased life expectancy compared with 
single-diagnosis patients. Identifying the patients among either drug addicts or 
mentally ill patients is difficult.
METHODS: All drug addicts autopsied at the Department of Forensic Medicine, 
University of Copenhagen, Denmark, in the years 1992, 2002 and 2012 were 
included. The group was divided into two subpopulations of possible dual 
diagnosis patients either according to police reports stating mental illness or 
to psychotropics found in the toxicology screening after autopsy.
RESULTS: We found a rise in possible mental illness in both subpopulations in 
the study period. Drug addicts with psychotropics in the blood at the time of 
death increased from 3.1% in 1992 to 48.1% in 2012, and this group was 
significantly younger at the time of death than those without psychotropics in 
the blood.
CONCLUSIONS: Suspected dual diagnosis patients have increased in number. They 
die earlier than their drug addict counterparts. Methadone remains the leading 
cause of death in all subpopulations. Possible causes are misuse of treatment 
and/or illegally bought methadone, wrongly assigned cause of death due to 
unknown tolerance and/or polydrug toxicity in combination with psychotropic 
medicine.

of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, 20892.

Research on the biology of aging has accelerated rapidly in the last two 
decades. It is now at the point where translation of the findings into useful 
approaches to improve the health of the elderly population seems possible. In 
trying to fill that gap, a new field termed geroscience will be articulated here 
that attempts to identify the biological underpinnings for the age-dependency of 
most chronic diseases. Herein, I will review the major conceptual issues leading 
to the formulation of geroscience as a field, as well as give examples of 
current areas of inquiry in which basic aging biology research could lead to 
therapeutic approaches to address age-related chronic diseases, not one at a 
time, but most of them in unison.

BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Long-term observational cohorts provide the opportunity 
to investigate the potential impact of dietary patterns on death. We aimed to 
investigate all-cause death according to the consumption of selected food 
groups, and then to identify those independently associated with reduced 
mortality.
SUBJECTS/METHODS: Population survey of middle-aged men randomly selected in the 
period 1995-1997 from the general population of three French areas and followed 
over a median of 14.8 years. Dietary data were collected through a 3-day food 
record. Cox modeling was used to assess the risk of death according to selected 
foods groups after extensive adjustment for confounders, including a diet 
quality index.
RESULTS: The study population comprised 960 men (mean age 55.5 ±6.2 years). 
After a median follow-up of 14.8 (interquartile range 14.3-15.2) years, 150 
(15.6%) subjects had died. Food groups that remained independently predictive of 
a lower risk of death after extensive adjustment were an above-median 
consumption of milk (adjusted relative risk: 0.61, 95% confidence interval (CI): 
0.43-0.86, P-value=0.005), fruits and vegetables (0.68, 0.46-0.98, 
P-value=0.041) and a moderate consumption of yogurts and cottage cheese (0.50, 
95% CI: 0.31-0.81, P-value=0.005), other cheeses (0.62, 0.39-0.97, 
P-value=0.036) and bread (0.57, 0.37-0.89, P-value=0.014). Besides, there was a 
nonsignificant trend for a higher risk of death associated with highest sodium 
intakes.
CONCLUSIONS: Consumption of food groups that largely match recommendations is 
associated with a reduced risk of all-cause death in men. A diet providing 
moderate amounts of diverse food groups appears associated with the highest life 
expectancy.

Even though the inevitable process of aging by itself cannot be considered a 
disease, it is directly linked to life span and is the driving force behind all 
age-related diseases. It is an undisputable fact that age-associated diseases 
are among the leading causes of death in the world, primarily in industrialized 
countries. During the last several years, an intensive search of antiaging 
treatments has led to the discovery of a variety of drugs that promote health 
span and/or life extension. The biguanide compound metformin is widely used for 
treating people with type 2 diabetes and appears to show protection against 
cancer, inflammation, and age-related pathologies. Here, we summarize the recent 
developments about metformin use in translational aging research and discuss its 
role as a potential geroprotector.

Assessing variation in life-history tactics within a population using mixture 
regression models: a practical guide for evolutionary ecologists.

Mixed models are now well-established methods in ecology and evolution because 
they allow accounting for and quantifying within- and between-individual 
variation. However, the required normal distribution of the random effects can 
often be violated by the presence of clusters among subjects, which leads to 
multi-modal distributions. In such cases, using what is known as mixture 
regression models might offer a more appropriate approach. These models are 
widely used in psychology, sociology, and medicine to describe the diversity of 
trajectories occurring within a population over time (e.g. psychological 
development, growth). In ecology and evolution, however, these models are seldom 
used even though understanding changes in individual trajectories is an active 
area of research in life-history studies. Our aim is to demonstrate the value of 
using mixture models to describe variation in individual life-history tactics 
within a population, and hence to promote the use of these models by ecologists 
and evolutionary ecologists. We first ran a set of simulations to determine 
whether and when a mixture model allows teasing apart latent clustering, and to 
contrast the precision and accuracy of estimates obtained from mixture models 
versus mixed models under a wide range of ecological contexts. We then used 
empirical data from long-term studies of large mammals to illustrate the 
potential of using mixture models for assessing within-population variation in 
life-history tactics. Mixture models performed well in most cases, except for 
variables following a Bernoulli distribution and when sample size was small. The 
four selection criteria we evaluated [Akaike information criterion (AIC), 
Bayesian information criterion (BIC), and two bootstrap methods] performed 
similarly well, selecting the right number of clusters in most ecological 
situations. We then showed that the normality of random effects implicitly 
assumed by evolutionary ecologists when using mixed models was often violated in 
life-history data. Mixed models were quite robust to this violation in the sense 
that fixed effects were unbiased at the population level. However, fixed effects 
at the cluster level and random effects were better estimated using mixture 
models. Our empirical analyses demonstrated that using mixture models 
facilitates the identification of the diversity of growth and reproductive 
tactics occurring within a population. Therefore, using this modelling framework 
allows testing for the presence of clusters and, when clusters occur, provides 
reliable estimates of fixed and random effects for each cluster of the 
population. In the presence or expectation of clusters, using mixture models 
offers a suitable extension of mixed models, particularly when evolutionary 
ecologists aim at identifying how ecological and evolutionary processes change 
within a population. Mixture regression models therefore provide a valuable 
addition to the statistical toolbox of evolutionary ecologists. As these models 
are complex and have their own limitations, we provide recommendations to guide 
future users.

Visualising variation in mortality rates across the life course and by sex, USA 
and comparator states, 1933-2010.

BACKGROUND: Previous research showed that younger adult males in the USA have, 
since the 1950s, died at a faster rate than females of the same age. In this 
paper, we quantify this difference, and explore possible explanations for the 
differences at different ages and in different years.
METHODS: Using data from the Human Mortality Database (HMD), the number of 
additional male deaths per 10 000 female deaths was calculated for each year 
from 1933 to 2010, and for each year of age from 0 to 60 years, for the USA, and 
a number of other countries for comparison. The data were explored visually 
using shaded contour plots.
RESULTS: Gender differences in excess mortality have increased. Coming of age 
(between the ages of 15 and 25 years of age) is especially perilous for men 
relative to women now compared with the past in the USA; the visualisations 
highlight this change as important.
CONCLUSIONS: Sex differences in mortality risks at various ages are not static. 
While women may today have an advantage when it comes to life expectancy, in the 
USA, this has greatly increased since the 1930s. Just as young adulthood for 
women has been made safer through safer antenatal and childbirth practices, 
changes in public policy can make the social environment safer for men.

BACKGROUND: Kiribati is an atoll country of 103,058 (2010 Census) situated in 
the central Pacific. Previous mortality estimates have been derived from 
demographic analyses of census data. This is the first mortality analysis based 
on reported deaths.
METHODS: Recorded deaths were from the Ministry of Health and the Civil 
Registration Office for 2000-2009; populations were from the 2000, 2005, and 
2010 censuses. Duplicate death records were removed by matching deaths within 
and between data sources using a combination of names, date of death, age, sex, 
island of residence, and cause of death. Probability of dying <5 years (5q0) and 
15-59 years (45q15), and life expectancy (LE) at birth, were computed with 95 % 
confidence intervals. These data were compared with previous census analyses.
RESULTS: There were 8,681 unique deaths reported over the decade 2000-2009 in 
Kiribati. The reconciled mortality data indicate 5q0 for both sexes of 64 per 
1,000 live births in 2000-2004, and 51 for 2005-2009 (assuming no 
under-enumeration), compared with 69 and 59 for comparable periods from the 2005 
and 2010 census analyses (children ever-born/children surviving method). Based 
on reconciled deaths, LE at birth (e0) for males was 54 years for 2000-2004 and 
55 years in 2005-2009, five years lower than the 2005 and 2010 census estimates 
for comparable periods of 59 and 58 years. Female LE was 62 years for 2000-2004 
and 63 years for 2005-2009, two-three years less than estimates for comparable 
periods of 63 and 66 years from the 2005 and 2010 census analyses. Adult 
mortality (45q15) was 47-48 % in males and 27-28 % in females from reconciled 
mortality over 2000-2009, higher than census estimates of 34-38 % in males and 
21-26 % in females for the same periods. The reconciled data are very likely to 
be incomplete and actual mortality higher and life expectancy lower than 
reported here.
CONCLUSION: This analysis indicates higher mortality than indirect demographic 
methods from the 2005 and 2010 Censuses. Reported deaths are most likely 
under-reported; especially 5q0, as many early neonatal deaths are probably 
classified as stillbirths. These analyses suggest that the health situation in 
Kiribati is more serious and urgent than previously appreciated.
