BACKGROUND: High levels of preformed anti-HLA antibodies dramatically diminish 
renal transplant outcomes. Most desensitization programmes guarantee good 
intermediate outcomes but quite disappointing long-term prognosis. The search 
for a fully compatible kidney increases time on the waiting list.
METHODS: In February 2011, a nationwide hyperimmune programme (NHP) was begun in 
Italy: all available kidneys are primarily proposed to highly sensitized 
patients with a panel reactive antibody above 80%. In this manuscript, we 
evaluate the outcome of paediatric patients transplanted with this approach.
RESULTS: Twenty-one patients were transplanted. Complete data are available for 
20 patients. Mean age at transplantation was 14.5 years [standard deviation (SD) 
± 5.5)]. Mean time on the waiting list was 29.3 months (SD ± 27.5). Median 
follow-up was 29.2 months (range: 11.2-59.3). The average number of HLA 
mismatches in these patients was 2.3 versus 3.7 in 48 standard patients 
transplanted in the same period (P < 0.001). Only one graft was lost. Two cases 
of humoral rejection occurred and were successfully treated. No cellular 
rejection was reported. Median creatinine clearance was 84, 88, 77 and 77 
mL/min/1.73 m 2 respectively 1, 6, 12 and 24 months after transplant.
CONCLUSIONS: Transplantation of sensitized patients avoiding prohibited antigens 
is feasible, at least in a selected cohort of patients. In order to be able to 
further improve this approach, which in our opinion is very successful, it would 
be necessary to expand the donor pool, possibly increasing the number of 
countries participating in the programme. In this series, time on the waiting 
list did not increase significantly. This allocation policy should ideally lead 
to an outcome comparable to that expected in standard patients, which is 
particularly desirable in young patients who have the longest life expectancy. 
Since long-term results of desensitization programmes are not (yet) convincing, 
we suggest that these programmes should be reserved for selected cases where 
compatible organs cannot be found within a reasonable time span.

Although an osteoporosis screening program has been implemented as a health 
promotion project in Japan, its cost-effectiveness has yet to be elucidated 
fully. We performed a cost-effectiveness analysis and found that osteoporosis 
screening and treatment would be cost-effective for Japanese women over 
60 years.
INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this study was to estimate the cost-effectiveness 
of osteoporosis screening and drug therapy in the Japanese healthcare system for 
postmenopausal women with no history of fracture.
METHODS: A patient-level state transition model was developed to predict the 
outcomes of Japanese women with no previous fracture. Lifetime costs and 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were estimated for women who receive 
osteoporosis screening and alendronate therapy for 5 years and those who do not 
receive the screening and treatments. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
(ICER) of the screening option compared with the no screening option was 
estimated. Sensitivity analyses were performed to examine the influence of 
parameter uncertainty on the base case results.
RESULTS: The ICERs of osteoporosis screening and treatments for Japanese women 
aged 50-54, 55-59, 60-64, 65-69, 70-74, and 75-79 years were estimated to be 
$89,242, $64,010, $40,596, $27,697, $17,027, and $9771 per QALY gained, 
respectively. Deterministic sensitivity analyses showed that several parameters 
such as the disutility due to vertebral fracture had a significant influence on 
the base case results. Applying a willingness to pay of $50,000 per QALY gained, 
the probability that the screening option became cost-effectiveness estimated to 
50.9, 56.3, 59.1, and 64.7 % for women aged 60-64, 65-69, 70-74, and 
75-79 years, respectively. Scenario analyses showed that the ICER for women aged 
55-59 years with at least one clinical risk factor was below $50,000 per QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) screening and 
alendronate therapy for osteoporosis would be cost-effective for postmenopausal 
Japanese women over 60 years. In terms of cost-effectiveness, the individual 
need for osteoporosis screening should be determined by age and clinical risk 
factors.

BACKGROUND: The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommends a single 
dose of herpes zoster (HZ) vaccine in persons aged 60 years or older, but the 
efficacy decreases to zero after approximately 10 years. A booster dose 
administered after 10 years might extend protection, but the cost-effectiveness 
of a booster strategy has not been examined.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to determine the optimal schedule for HZ vaccine DESIGN: We 
built a Markov model to follow patients over their lifetime. From the societal 
perspective, we compared costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) saved of 
11 strategies to start and repeat HZ vaccine at different ages.
SUBJECTS: Adults aged 60 years.
INTERVENTION: HZ vaccine.
MAIN MEASURES: Costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and incremental costs 
per QALY saved.
KEY RESULTS: At a $100,000/QALY threshold, "vaccination at 70 plus one booster" 
was the most cost-effective strategy, with an incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio (ICER) of $36,648/QALY. "Vaccination at 60 plus two boosters" was more 
effective, but had an ICER of $153,734/QALY. In deterministic sensitivity 
analysis, "vaccination at 60 plus two boosters" cost < $100,000/QALY if 
compliance rate was > 67 % or vaccine cost was < $156 per dose. In probabilistic 
sensitivity analysis, "vaccination at 70 plus one booster" was preferred at a 
willingness-to-pay of up to $135,000/QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: Under current assumptions, initiating HZ vaccine at age 70 years 
with one booster dose 10 years later appears optimal. Future data regarding 
compliance with or efficacy of a booster could affect these conclusions.

Under the U.S. Lung Allocation Score (LAS) system, older and sicker patients are 
prioritized for lung transplantation (LT). The impact of these changes on 
health-related quality of life (HRQL) after transplant has not been determined. 
In a single-center prospective cohort study from 2010 to 2016, we assessed HRQL 
before and repeatedly after LT for up to 3 years using the SF12-Physical and 
Mental Health, the respiratory-specific Airway Questionnaire 20-Revised, and the 
Euroqol 5D/Visual Analog Scale utility measures by multivariate linear mixed 
models jointly modeled with death. We also tested changes in LT-Valued Life 
Activities disability, BMI, allograft function, and 6-min walk test exercise 
capacity as predictors of HRQL change. Among 211 initial participants (92% of 
those eligible), LT improved HRQL by all 5 measures (p < 0.05) and all but 
SF12-Mental Health improved by threefold or greater than the minimally 
clinically important difference. Compared to younger participants, those aged 
≥65 improved less in SF12-Physical and Mental Health (p < 0.01). Improvements in 
disability accounted for much of the HRQL improvement. In the LAS era, LT 
affords meaningful and durable HRQL improvements, mediated by amelioration of 
disability. Identifying factors limiting HRQL improvement in selected subgroups, 
especially those aged ≥65, are needed to maximize the net benefits of LT.

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common autosomal recessive disease in 
Caucasians. Although most cases are diagnosed in childhood, diagnosis in adults 
is apparently increasing.
OBJECTIVE: Evaluate the adult population with CF, comparing patients who were 
diagnosed before and after 18 years of age.
METHODS: Retrospective analysis of patients followed in three main medical 
centres in Portugal in 2012. Comparison of two groups: G1 - patients diagnosed 
at <18 years and G2 - patients diagnosed at ≥18 years.
RESULTS: 89 adults were identified: 61.8% in G1, 38.2% in G2. Gender 
distribution was similar in both groups. Average age in G2 was higher (38.3±8.4 
vs. 26.8±6.1 years, p<0.001). Respiratory symptoms most frequently led to CF 
diagnosis in all patients, mainly in adulthood. There was a greater percentage 
of patients homozygous for the mutation delF508 in G1 (43.6 vs. 8.8%, p=0.02). 
Respiratory and pancreatic function, and body mass index (BMI) showed a higher 
severity in G1 (G1 vs. G2: FEV1: 54.6±27.3 vs. 29.9±64.6%, p=0.177; pancreatic 
insufficiency 72.7 vs. 26.5%, p<0.001; BMI 20.2±3.4 vs. 22.2±4.8, p=0.018). 
Pseudomonas aeruginosa and methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus were the 
most frequently isolated microorganisms. Lung transplantation rate was higher in 
G2 (20.6 vs. 10.9%, p=0.231) while mortality rate was higher in G1 (0 vs. 3.6%, 
p=0.261). Hospital admission rate was higher in G1 as well as mortality rate.
CONCLUSION: The results suggest that patients with CF diagnosed in childhood 
have characteristics that distinguish them from those diagnosed in adulthood, 
and these differences may have implications for diagnosis, prognosis and life 
expectancy.

Globally, ovarian cancer is the seventh most common cancer in women and the 
eighth most common cause of cancer death, with five-year survival rates below 
45%. Although age-standardised rates are stable or falling in most high-income 
countries, they are rising in many low and middle income countries. Furthermore, 
with increasing life-expectancy, the number of cases diagnosed each year is 
increasing. To control ovarian cancer we need to understand the causes. This 
will allow better prediction of those at greatest risk for whom screening might 
be appropriate, while identification of potentially modifable causes provides an 
opportunity for intervention to reduce rates. In this paper we will summarise 
the current state of knowledge regarding the known and possible causes of 
epithelial ovarian cancer and discuss some of the main theories of ovarian 
carcinogenesis. We will also briefly review the relationship between lifestyle 
and survival after a diagnosis of ovarian cancer.

Time to Explore Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement in Younger, Low-Risk 
Patients.

Sondergaard L(1).

(1)Heart Center, Rigshospitalet, University of Copenhagen, Denmark. Electronic 
address: drsondergaard@gmail.com.

During the last decade transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has been 
established as a treatment for patients with severe aortic stenosis, who are at 
particularly high surgical risk. As compared with surgical aortic valve 
replacement (SAVR), TAVR has been associated with lower early risk of mortality, 
atrial fibrillation, acute kidney injury, and bleeding. Furthermore, device and 
periprocedural improvements have addressed most of the initial limitations 
for TAVR, including the Achilles' heel, paravalvular leakage. Supported by this 
as well as preliminary data among lower-risk patients, TAVR is currently being 
evaluated in prospective randomized trials against SAVR in younger 
low-risk patients. Although durability of the TAVR device may be of concern in 
younger patients given their longer life expectancy, intermediate-term 
controlled data does not reveal any difference between TAVR and SAVR devices.

The antimicrobial activity of essential oils (EOs), organic acid (OA) salts and 
natamycin, a natural antifungal produced during fermentation by the bacterium 
Streptomyces natalensis, was assessed against four pathogens (Escherichia coli 
O157:H7, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella Typhimurium and Aspergillus niger). 
The Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) of each antimicrobial (AM) was 
assessed to determine their efficiency on tested microbial species in order to 
select the most efficient. Then, the interactions between different 
antimicrobial compounds showing the lowest MIC were determined by the 
checkerboard method. The most effective antimicrobial formulation showing 
synergistic or additive effects was then encapsulated in an alginate matrix to 
protect the antimicrobial efficiency during storage. The effectiveness of the 
formulation was then evaluated in situ using broccoli as a food model. A 
combined treatment of active coating and γ-irradiation (0.4 and 0.8kGy) was also 
done in order to evaluate the possible synergistic effect between treatments. 
The results of this study allowed the selection of 4 EOs, one OA salt and the 
natamycin as an antifungal agent exhibiting lower MIC values. The interactive 
antimicrobial effects between them showed that an antimicrobial formulation 
composed of 300ppm of lemongrass EO, 5000ppm of sodium diacetate and 80ppm of 
natamycin resulted in an additive effect against A. niger, E. coli and S. 
Typhimurium and showing synergistic effect against L. monocytogenes. Finally, in 
situ analyses showed a synergistic antimicrobial activity between active coating 
and γ-irradiation and allowed the extension of the shelf-life of ready-to-eat 
(RTE) broccoli during storage at 4°C.

Phosphine resistance in stored-product insects occurs worldwide and is a major 
challenge to continued effective use of this fumigant. We determined resistance 
frequencies and levels of resistance in Tribolium castaneum and Plodia 
interpunctella collected from California almond storage and processing 
facilities. Discriminating doses of phosphine were established for eggs and 
larvae of P. interpunctella and eggs of T. castaneum using laboratory 
susceptible strains of the two species. For T. castaneum and P. interpunctella 
eggs, discriminating doses were 62.4 and 107.8 ppm, respectively, over a 3-d 
fumigation period, and for P. interpunctella larvae, discriminating dose was 
98.7 ppm over a 20-h fumigation period. Discriminating dose tests on adults and 
eggs showed that 4 out of 11 T. castaneum populations tested had resistance 
frequencies that ranged from 42 to 100% for adults and 54 to 100% for eggs. LC99 
values for the susceptible and the most resistant adults of T. castaneum were 
7.4 and 356.9 ppm over 3 d, respectively. LC99 values for T. castaneum eggs were 
51.5 and 653.9 ppm, respectively. Based on adult data, the most resistant T. 
castaneum beetle population was 49× more resistant than the susceptible strain. 
Phosphine resistance frequencies in P. interpunctella eggs ranged from 4 to 20%. 
Results show phosphine resistance is present in both species in California. 
Future research will investigate phosphine resistance over a wider geographic 
area. In addition, the history of pest management practices in facilities where 
insects tested in this study originated will be determined in order to develop 
phosphine resistance management strategies for California almond storage and 
processing facilities.

The ability to reason about probabilities has ecological relevance for many 
species. Recent research has shown that both preverbal infants and non-human 
great apes can make predictions about single-item samples randomly drawn from 
populations by reasoning about proportions. To further explore the evolutionary 
origins of this ability, we conducted the first investigation of probabilistic 
inference in a monkey species (capuchins; Sapajus spp.). Across four 
experiments, capuchins (N = 19) were presented with two populations of food 
items that differed in their relative distribution of preferred and 
non-preferred items, such that one population was more likely to yield a 
preferred item. In each trial, capuchins had to select between hidden 
single-item samples randomly drawn from each population. In Experiment 1 each 
population was homogeneous so reasoning about proportions was not required; 
Experiments 2-3 replicated previous probabilistic reasoning research with 
infants and apes; and Experiment 4 was a novel condition untested in other 
species, providing an important extension to previous work. Results revealed 
that at least some capuchins were able to make probabilistic inferences via 
reasoning about proportions as opposed to simpler quantity heuristics. 
Performance was relatively poor in Experiment 4, so the possibility remains that 
capuchins may use quantity-based heuristics in some situations, though further 
work is required to confirm this. Interestingly, performance was not at ceiling 
in Experiment 1, which did not involve reasoning about proportions, but did 
involve sampling. This suggests that the sampling task posed demands in addition 
to reasoning about proportions, possibly related to inhibitory control, working 
memory, and/or knowledge of object permanence.

BACKGROUND: Macroeconomic indicators are likely associated with prostate cancer 
(PCa) incidence and mortality globally, but have rarely been assessed.
METHODS: Data on PCa incidence in 2003-2007 for 49 countries with either 
nationwide cancer registry or at least two regional registries were obtained 
from Cancer Incidence in Five Continents Vol X and national PCa mortality for 
2012 from GLOBOCAN 2012. We compared PCa incidence and mortality rates with 
various population-level indicators of health, economy and development in 2000. 
Poisson and linear regression methods were used to quantify the associations.
RESULTS: PCa incidence varied more than 15-fold, being highest in high-income 
countries. PCa mortality exhibited less variation, with higher rates in many 
low- and middle-income countries. Healthcare expenditure (rate ratio, RR 1.46, 
95 % CI 1.45-1.47) and population growth (RR 1.15, 95 % CI 1.14-1.16), as well 
as computer and mobile phone density, were associated with a higher PCa 
incidence, while gross domestic product, GDP (RR 0.94, 95 % CI 0.93-0.95) and 
overall mortality (RR 0.72, 95 % CI 0.71-0.73) were associated with a low 
incidence. GDP (RR 0.55, 95 % CI 0.46-0.66) was also associated with a low PCa 
mortality, while life expectancy (RR 3.93, 95 % CI 3.22-4.79) and healthcare 
expenditure (RR 1.20, 95 % CI 1.09-1.32) were associated with an elevated 
mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that healthcare expenditure and, thus, the 
availability of medical resources are an important contributor to the patterns 
of international variation in PCa incidence. This suggests that there is an 
iatrogenic component in the current global epidemic of PCa. On the other hand, 
higher healthcare expenditure is associated with lower PCa death rates.

[Lumbar spinal stenosis].

[Article in Danish]

Lumbar spinal stenosis is the most common reason for spinal surgery in Denmark. 
Lumbar spinal stenosis is a clinical syndrome of pain in the buttocks or lower 
extremities, with or without back pain. It is associated with reduced space 
available for the neural and vascular elements of the lumbar spine. The 
condition is often exacerbated by standing, walking or lumbar extension and 
relieved by forward flexion. The options for non-surgical management include 
drugs and physiotherapy. Treatment outcomes seem to be better for surgical 
neural decompression than for non-operative treatment.

INTRODUCTION: Mortality from injuries, particularly violent injuries, is more 
common among the young. Although traditional epidemiologic measures describe 
burden of death using rate-related mortalities, this method may not accurately 
represent burden of premature death. Years of life lost (YLLs) incorporate time 
discounting and age weighting to more accurately estimate the burden of death. 
To the authors' knowledge, there has been no examination of YLLs using the Rhode 
Island Violent Death Reporting System data. This study's objective was to assess 
the burden of violent death in Rhode Island in terms of YLLs.
METHODS: This study used 2006-2013 Rhode Island Violent Death Reporting System 
data. YLLs as a result of premature violent deaths were assessed overall and by 
age, sex, race/ethnicity, and manner of death. Data were analyzed in 2015.
RESULTS: Suicide made the largest contribution to the overall YLLs (61.3%), 
followed by homicide (24.0%), whereas undetermined intent deaths captured by the 
system accounted for 14.8% of YLLs. In Rhode Island, people aged 25-44 years had 
the highest YLLs due to suicide, and Hispanics had the highest YLLs due to 
homicide/legal intervention. By comparison, using crude mortality rate 
calculations, people aged 45-64 years had the highest suicide mortality rate and 
non-Hispanic blacks had the highest homicide mortality rate.
CONCLUSIONS: YLL calculations provide a different picture than crude 
mortality-based assessments of the population at highest risk for violent death. 
This study demonstrates the strengths of using YLL to assess the burden of 
violent death at the state level.

INTRODUCTION: In the U.S., people of different races/ethnicities have 
differences in cancer incidence, mortality, survival, stage at diagnosis, and 
receipt of treatment, resulting in variances in cancer burden. The burden of 
cancer in 2011 was assessed by race/ethnicity for 24 cancers using 
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs).
METHODS: In 2014-2015, DALYs and their two components were estimated (years of 
life lost [YLLs] and years lived with disability) by race/ethnicity using 
population-based cancer registry data collected in 2013, vital statistics, and 
literature reviews.
RESULTS: A total of 9.8 million DALYs (91% YLLs) were lost to cancer. Half of 
DALYs were due to lung (24%), breast (10%), colorectal (9%), and pancreatic (6%) 
cancers. Age-standardized DALY rate (ASR) ratios of non-Hispanic blacks (NHBs) 
over non-Hispanic whites (NHWs) for "all cancers" were 1.3 (95% CI=1.2, 1.4) 
times higher in men and 1.2 (95% CI=1.2, 1.3) times higher in women (ASR in NHBs 
4,003 per 100,000 in men and 3,329 in women vs 3,088 and 2,758 in NHWs, 
respectively); ASRs were also higher in NHB for 15 cancers. Compared with NHWs, 
Hispanics and non-Hispanic Asians exhibited lower ASR for "all cancers" and 
common cancers, contrasting with a higher ASR for infection-related cancers 
(stomach, liver, cervix).
CONCLUSIONS: The cancer burden was highest in NHBs, followed by NHWs, Hispanics, 
and non-Hispanic Asians. In all races/ethnicities, the cancer burden was largely 
driven by YLLs, highlighting the need to prevent death at middle age through 
broad implementation of structural and behavioral measures of primary 
prevention, early detection, and treatment.

RISE-SSc is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2 study 
investigating the efficacy and safety of riociguat in patients with diffuse 
cutaneous systemic sclerosis (dcSSc). Based on positive results from riociguat 
trials in patients with pulmonary hypertension and chronic thromboembolic 
pulmonary hypertension in combination with the known antiproliferative and 
antifibrotic effects seen in animal models, patients with SSc may benefit from 
treatment with riociguat. Patients with SSc meeting the ACR/EULAR systemic 
sclerosis classification criteria with diffuse cutaneous SSc (dcSSc) subset per 
LeRoy criteria, and a disease duration of less than or equal to 18 months will 
be randomized to placebo or riociguat 0.5 mg (up-titrated to a maximum dose of 
2.5 mg TID over 10 weeks) and maintained on therapy for a total of 52 weeks. 
During the first 10 weeks of the long-term extension phase, placebo subjects 
will be up-titrated on riociguat, and all patients will be followed for up to 6 
years. The primary endpoint of change in modified Rodnan skin score (mRSS) from 
baseline will be assessed at 52 weeks, as will be secondary endpoints such as 
mRSS progression and regression rates, patient quality of life, digital ulcer 
burden, and change in forced vital capacity and carbon monoxide diffusing 
capacity. This review will further define the clinical rationale for the use of 
riociguat in the treatment of SSc and provide details on study protocol, design, 
and outcome reporting.

BACKGROUND: Oral health care of patients with acquired immune deficiency 
syndrome (AIDS) due to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a growing area of 
concern, taking into consideration the increased life expectancy of patients 
resulting from antiretroviral therapy. There is insufficient literature 
regarding the impact of dental implants in AIDS patients. This study 
investigated the long-term clinical outcome of implant placement in patients 
diagnosed with AIDS.
METHODS: This monocentric study included AIDS patients with CD4 <200 cells/μL, 
age 18 years or older, and a minimum of one edentulous space requiring implant. 
All patients in the study were undergoing highly active antiretroviral therapy 
(HAART). HAART includes nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), 
non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), protease inhibitors 
(PIs), and integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs). Typical treatment 
includes two different NTRIs, along with a third drug, either an INSTI, a PI, or 
an NNRTI. Bicon dental implants were placed in the patients after medical 
clearance and were followed up for 5 years. Bicon system implants were chosen 
because of availability and previous experience with this brand. Implant success 
criteria are defined as implants that had no clinical mobility at uncovering, no 
radiographic radiolucency, and allowed for loading and abutment placement. 
Implant success in AIDS patients was measured over a period of 5 years. 
Descriptive statistics were used.
RESULTS: Sixteen adults met the inclusion criteria (12 males and 4 females) with 
mean CD4 count as 141.25 (sd 35.5). Thirty-three implants were placed in 
selected patients. Average time to uncovering was 151 days (sd 25 days). Two of 
the three failures were maxillary implants in the anterior arch, and the third 
was in the mandibular posterior arch.
CONCLUSIONS: The study found a slightly higher failure rate of 10 % in patients 
with AIDS, compared to widely accepted failure rates in healthy patients at 
5-7 %. With the advent of new medical therapies, even AIDS patients should be 
offered the option of root-formed implants as a viable alternative to fixed and 
removable prosthetics.

Americans.

BACKGROUND: Due to a decreasing birth rate and longer life expectancy, the 
proportion of Americans over the age of 65 is expected to rise in coming years. 
Drivers over 65 drive two billion miles yearly, a number that will increase. For 
that reason, it is imperative to understand their attitudes and perceptions. It 
is also important to understand whether drivers over 65 can be treated as one 
cohesive group, or if there are differences among them.
METHODS: A web-enabled survey was conducted among Americans in the years 
2011-2013. Responses from 1793 persons over 65 regarding attitudes towards 
driving behaviors, support for safety interventions, and engagement in unsafe 
behaviors were analyzed. Respondents were stratified by age: 65-69, 70-74, and 
75 and older. Age groups were compared using logistic regression. Other 
potential explanatory factors were analyzed and controlled for.
RESULTS: The three groups were similar on many outcomes. However, statistically 
significant differences were found between them with regard to perceptions on 
speeding and the support for speed cameras, among other outcomes. In nearly all 
cases, those 75 and older were the most "pro-safety." However, when adjusted for 
demographic characteristics other than age, a larger proportion of respondents 
75 and older reported engaging in red light running and drowsy driving in the 
last 30 days, and the difference was statistically significant.
CONCLUSION: Older drivers are strongly "pro-traffic safety." However, the 
finding that those 65-69 are less so is concerning. This is especially true if 
it is the result of a cohort effect instead of an age effect. The increase in 
certain behaviors among those 75 and older is also concerning; drivers over this 
age are more prone to fatal injury when involved in a motor vehicle crashes. 
This poses a public health issue as the 75and older population expands.

Apremilast: A Phosphodiesterase 4 Inhibitor for the Treatment of Psoriatic 
Arthritis.

INTRODUCTION: Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a spondyloarthritis that occurs in up 
to 30% of psoriasis patients. Patients with PsA are at risk for decreased 
quality of life due to both joint and skin symptoms, impaired physical function 
and disease progression. Treatments include non-steroidal anti-inflammatory 
drugs, conventional systemic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) 
such as methotrexate, and biologic agents, including tumor necrosis factor-α 
inhibitors. The most recently introduced treatment option is apremilast, an oral 
phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitor.
METHODS: This review provides an in-depth discussion of apremilast's mechanism 
of action, and evidence of its clinical efficacy and safety from the Psoriatic 
Arthritis Long-term Assessment of Clinical Efficacy (PALACE) phase III pivotal 
clinical trials (PALACE 1, 2, and 3).
RESULTS: These trials demonstrate that apremilast is effective for the treatment 
of active PsA, despite prior conventional DMARDs or biologic treatment. The 
primary efficacy end point, a 20% improvement from baseline in modified American 
College of Rheumatology response criteria at Week 16, was achieved by 
significantly greater proportions of patients treated with apremilast 20 mg 
twice daily (BID) and apremilast 30 mg BID versus placebo in PALACE 1, 2, and 3. 
Improvements in this and other clinical and patient-reported end points, 
including swollen and tender joint counts, Psoriasis Area and Severity Index 
score, physical function, and quality of life, were maintained, extending over 
52 weeks of treatment among patients initially randomized to apremilast. 
Apremilast's safety profile has been acceptable, with diarrhea and nausea being 
the most common adverse events, with no evidence for an increased risk of 
infection or need for laboratory monitoring. The PALACE pivotal data indicate 
that apremilast presents a new option for the treatment of PsA that may be 
appropriate for use early in the treatment ladder. Ongoing PALACE open-label 
extension trials of up to 4 years will characterize the long-term clinical 
effects and safety of apremilast therapy.

Discrete choice experiments (DCEs) are a promising alternative to more 
resource-intensive preference elicitation methods such as time trade-off (TTO), 
as pairwise comparisons are more amenable to online completion, which can save 
time and money. However, modeling DCE data produces latent utilities which are 
on an unknown scale. Therefore, latent utilities need to be transformed to a 
full health-dead scale before they can be used in quality-adjusted life year 
calculations. We aimed to explore transformation functions from DCE-derived 
latent utilities to TTO-derived health utilities. We used EQ-5D-5L valuation 
data from eight different countries that collected both DCE and TTO data by 
using a standardized protocol. Results found less variation in the function that 
transformed latent utilities to health utilities in the western countries than 
in the eastern countries. While a global transformation function is not 
recommended, results suggest that regional transformation functions could 
potentially be used to derive health utilities from DCE data. Copyright © 2016

The aim of this study was to systematically evaluate the cumulative radiation 
exposure and the associated lifetime-cancer-risk from diagnostic imaging in 
patients with Hodgkin-lymphoma-(HL) or diffuse-large-B-cell-lymphoma (DLBCL). 99 
consecutive patients (53-males) diagnosed with HL or DLBCL were included in the 
study and followed. Based on the imaging reports, organ and effective-doses-(ED) 
were calculated individually for each patient and the excess lifetime risks were 
estimated. The average ED in the first year after diagnosis was significantly 
different for men (59 ± 33 mSv) and women (74 ± 33 mSv)-(p < 0.05). The mean 
cumulative ED in each of the following 5 years was 16 ± 16 mSv without 
significant differences between men and women-(p > 0.05). Over all years, more 
than 90% of the ED resulted from CT. The average cumulative radiation risk 
estimated for the first year was significantly lower for men (0.76 ± 0.41%) as 
compared to women (1.28 ± 0.54%)-(p < 0.05). The same was found for each of the 
subsequent 5-years (men-0.18 ± 0.17%; women-0.28 ± 0.25%)-(p < 0.05). In 
conclusion, for HL and DLBCL patients investigated in this study, a cumulative 
radiation risk of about 1 excess cancer per 100 patients is estimated for 
diagnostic imaging procedures performed during both the first year after 
diagnosis and a follow-up period of 5 years.
