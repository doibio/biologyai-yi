£2,000 and 0.602 versus 0.561. These values yielded an ICER of £53,948 per QALY. 
Bootstrapped uncertainty analysis suggests that the TC has a 0.07 probability of 
being cost-effective at a £20,000 threshold. Stratified analysis suggests that 
with certain costs being controlled, an ICER of £24,639 can be calculated for 
patients with a higher degree of disease severity.
CONCLUSION: A tight control strategy to treat PsA is an effective intervention 
in the treatment pathway; however, this study does not find tight control to be 
cost-effective in most analyses. Lower drug prices, targeting polyarthritis 
patients, or reducing the frequency of rheumatology visits may improve value for 
money metrics in future studies.

the literature.

BACKGROUND: Immigration to the Nordic countries has increased in the last 
decades and foreign-born inhabitants now constitute a considerable part of the 
region's population. Several studies suggest poorer self-reported health among 
foreign-born compared to natives, while results on mortality and life expectancy 
are inconclusive. To date, few studies have summarized knowledge on mortality 
differentials by country of birth. This article aims to systematically review 
previous results on all-cause and cause-specific mortality by country of birth 
in the Nordic countries.
METHODS: The methodology was conducted and documented systematically and 
transparently using a narrative approach. We identified 43 relevant studies out 
of 6059 potentially relevant studies in August 2016, 35 of which used Swedish 
data, 8 Danish and 1 Norwegian.
RESULTS: Our findings from fully-adjusted models on Swedish data support claims 
of excess mortality risks in specific categories of foreign-born. Most notably, 
immigrants from other Nordic countries, especially Finland, experience increased 
risk of mortality from all causes, and specifically by suicide, breast and 
gynaecological cancers, and circulatory diseases. Increased risks in people from 
Central and Eastern Europe can also be found. On the contrary, decreased risks 
for people with Southern European and Middle Eastern origins are found for 
all-cause, suicide, and breast and gynaecological cancer mortality. The few 
Danish studies are more difficult to compare, with conflicting results arising 
in the analysis. Finally, results from the one Norwegian study suggest 
significantly decreased mortality risks among foreign-born, to be explored in 
further research.
CONCLUSIONS: With new studies being published on mortality differentials between 
native and foreign-born populations in the Nordic countries, specific risk 
patterns have begun to arise. Regardless, data from most Nordic countries 
remains limited, as does the information on specific causes of death. The 
literature should be expanded in upcoming years to capture associations between 
country of birth and mortality more clearly.

Life expectancy difference and life expectancy ratio: two measures of treatment 
effects in randomised trials with non-proportional hazards.

The hazard ratio (HR) is the most common measure of treatment effect in clinical 
trials that use time-to-event outcomes such as survival. When survival curves 
cross over or separate only after a considerable time, the proportional hazards 
assumption of the Cox model is violated, and HR can be misleading. We present 
two measures of treatment effects for situations where the HR changes over time: 
the life expectancy difference (LED) and life expectancy ratio (LER). LED is the 
difference between mean survival times in the intervention and control arms. LER 
is the ratio of these two times. LED and LER can be calculated for at least two 
time intervals during the trial, allowing for curves where the treatment effect 
changes over time. The two measures are readily interpretable as absolute and 
relative gains or losses in life expectancy.

Alternative life cycle strategies in the West African reed frog Hyperolius 
nitidulus: the answer to an unpredictable environment?

Biozentrum, Am Hubland, 97074, Wuerzburg, Germany.

The West African reed frog Hyperolius nitidulus, mainly known for its 
extraordinary aestivation behaviour and physiology, is able to vary its 
reproductive strategy in response to environmental conditions. We found indirect 
as well as direct evidence for individuals not following the generally assumed 
one year-one generation life cycle including an extended aestivation phase 
during the dry season, but leading very short lives for only a part of that 
rainy season in which the frogs were born. Second-generation frogs (males and 
females that reproduced in the season in which they were born) were 
significantly smaller than all other adults and their egg diameter was reduced. 
As the pattern and amount of rainfall and thus the span of time suitable for 
reproduction in H. nitidulus varies strongly between years in this savannah 
region, a flexible reproductive strategy may be highly adaptive for risk 
spreading. Alternative reproduction strategies probably contribute to the great 
success of H. nitidulus in terms of the extension of its geographical range and 
its often very high local abundance.

BACKGROUND: Years of potential life lost (YPLL) is a parameter that allows to 
analyze premature deaths.
AIM: To study the causes, differences by gender, geographic variations and the 
trend of premature deaths in the last decade in Chile.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Using death databases published by the Ministry of Health, 
YPLL were calculated for the decade 2001-2010, using the method proposed by the 
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.
RESULTS: The standardized annual average YPLL rate in Chile in the study period 
was 4.703 per 100,000 inhabitants. Trauma, cancer and cardiovascular diseases 
accounted for 68% of YPLL. The male/female YPLL ratio was 2.07; for trauma and 
mental disorders, the male/female ratio for YPLL was over 5; for cardiovascular 
and respiratory diseases the male/female ratio was over two. Regions with a 
higher proportion of rural areas had higher YPLL rates.
CONCLUSIONS: The main causes of YPLL are potentially preventable. Further 
studies should be carried out to identify risk factors for premature death.

The growth and development of Inuit children and adolescents living in the high 
arctic (Igloolik, NWT, 69°40' N, 81°W) has been surveyed crosssectionally and 
semilongitudinally on three occasions during a period of rapid acculturation: 
1969-1970, 1979-1980, 1989-1990. Recruitment declined from 85% (1969-1970) to 
63% (1989-1990) of eligible subjects, in the most recent survey a total of 91 
males and 65 females. Secular trends in the community have included a change 
from nomadic to settled life, improved access to health care, reduction of 
average family size, a progressive shift from country to market foods, the 
introduction of a 12-grade school, and a progressive reduction of habitual 
physical activity with the advent of television and video programs. The stature 
of the youngest students has tended to increase by ∼1cm/decade, possibly as a 
consequence of dietary changes and resultant earlier maturation, but the stature 
of older adolescents has tended to decrease, possibly as a consequence of spinal 
trauma sustained during high-speed snowmobile operation. In the boys, the 
estimated onset of rapid pubertal growth has advanced from an age of 13-14 to 
12-13 years, and in the girls, the period of rapid growth is now already 
established at 11 years. Over the 20 years of observation, skinfold thicknesses 
at any given age have increased, handgrip and knee extension forces have 
diminished, and relative aerobic power has also decreased. In consequence, the 
current generation of Inuit children are no more fit than their sedentary peers 
in southern Canada. © 1994 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

OBJECTIVE: To quantify the effect of immortal-time bias in an observational 
study examining the effect of cumulative testosterone exposure on mortality.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We used a population-based matched cohort study of men 
aged ≥66 years, newly treated with testosterone-replacement therapy (TRT), and 
matched-controls from 2007 to 2012 in Ontario, Canada to quantify the effects of 
immortal-time bias. We used generalised estimating equations to determine the 
association between cumulative TRT exposure and mortality. Results produced by 
models using time-fixed and time-varying exposures were compared. Further, we 
undertook a systematic review of PubMed to identify studies addressing 
immortal-time bias or time-varying exposures in the urological literature and 
qualitatively summated these.
RESULTS: Among 10 311 TRT-exposed men and 28 029 controls, the use of a 
time-varying exposure resulted in the attenuation of treatment effects compared 
with an analysis that did not account for immortal-time bias. While both 
analyses showed a decreased risk of death for patients in the highest tertile of 
TRT exposure, the effect was overestimated when using a time-fixed analysis 
(adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 0.56, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.52-0.61) when 
compared to a time-varying analysis (aHR 0.67, 95% CI: 0.62-0.73). Of the 1 241 
studies employing survival analysis identified in the literature, nine 
manuscripts met criteria for inclusion. Of these, five used a time-varying 
analytical method. Each of these was a large, population-based retrospective 
cohort study assessing potential harms of pharmacological agents.
CONCLUSIONS: Where exposures vary over time, a time-varying exposure is 
necessary to draw meaningful conclusions. Failure to use a time-varying analysis 
will result in overestimation of a beneficial effect. However, time-varying 
exposures are uncommonly utilised among manuscripts published in prominent 
urological journals.

OBJECTIVE: To compare survival outcomes for renal embolization (RE) to 
cytoreductive nephrectomy (CN) and no primary renal treatment (NT) among 
patients with synchronous metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) treated using 
either targeted therapy (TT) or immunotherapy (IT).
RESULTS: The median follow-up duration was 81.3 months, with a duration of 
first-line treatment of 3.5 months. Among the 211 patients, the median PFS and 
OS were 4.4 and 10.6 months. Specifically for patients receiving TT (124 
patients), the PFS and OS were 5.5 and 12.0 months. An intervention effect was 
identified only for OS, with a median OS of 20.1, 8.8 and 9.3 months for CN, RE 
and NT, respectively. After stratification by risk classification, CN provided a 
significant benefit on OS, compared to RE and NT, for patients with an 
intermediate risk (MSKCC). For those with a poor risk (Heng criteria), NT 
provided better survival than PFS (p=0.003), and a comparable survival to RE (p 
> 0.05).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective analysis of 211 patients, 87 treated with 
IT and 124 with TT, retrieved from our RCC database. Patients' risk factors for 
survival was evaluated using the Heng and MSKCC criteria, with only patients 
with an intermediate or poor survival risk included in the analysis. 
Between-group comparisons were evaluated with respect to progression-free 
survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).
CONCLUSIONS: The differential effect of CN and RE on OS appears to be modulated 
by risk classification. In patients with a poor risk, RE should be implemented 
after careful consideration of comorbidities and life expectancy.

The relationships between income inequality, welfare regimes and aggregate 
health: a systematic review.

Kim KT(1).

: When analysing the relationships between income inequality, welfare regimes 
and aggregate health at the cross-national level, previous primary articles and 
systematic reviews reach inconsistent conclusions. Contrary to theoretical 
expectations, equal societies or the Social Democratic welfare regime do not 
always have the best aggregate health when compared with those of other 
relatively unequal societies or other welfare regimes. This article will shed 
light on the controversial subjects with a new decomposition systematic review 
method. The decomposition systematic review method breaks down an individual 
empirical article, if necessary, into multiple findings based on an article's 
use of the following four components: independent variable, dependent variable, 
method and dataset. This decomposition method extracts 107 findings from the 
selected 48 articles, demonstrating the dynamics between the four components. 
'The age threshold effect' is recognized over which the hypothesized relations 
between income inequality, welfare regimes and aggregate health reverse. The 
hypothesis is supported mainly for younger infant and child health indicators, 
but not for adult health or general health indicators such as life expectancy. 
Further three threshold effects (income, gender and period) have also been put 
forward. The negative relationship between income inequality and aggregate 
health, often termed as the Wilkinson Hypothesis, was not generally observed in 
all health indicators except for infant and child mortality. The Scandinavian 
welfare regime reveals worse-than-expected outcomes in all health indicators 
except infant and child mortality.

Recombinant antibody fragments belong to the promising class of 
biopharmaceuticals with high potential for future therapeutic applications. 
However, due to their small size they are rapidly cleared from circulation. 
Binding to serum proteins can be an effective approach to improve 
pharmacokinetic properties of short half-life molecules. Herein, we have 
investigated the Zag albumin-binding domain (ABD) derived from Streptococcus 
zooepidemicus as a novel strategy to improve the pharmacokinetic properties of 
therapeutic molecules. To validate our approach, the Zag ABD was fused with an 
anti-TNFα single-domain antibody (sdAb). Our results demonstrated that the 
sdAb-Zag fusion protein was highly expressed and specifically recognizes human, 
rat and mouse serum albumins with affinities in the nanomolar range. Moreover, 
data also demonstrated that the sdAb activity against the therapeutic target 
(TNFα) was not affected when fused with Zag ABD. Importantly, the Zag ABD 
increased the sdAb half-life ∼39-fold (47min for sdAb versus 31h for sdAb-Zag). 
These findings demonstrate that the Zag ABD fusion is a promising approach to 
increase the half-life of small recombinant antibodies molecules without 
affecting their therapeutic efficacy. Moreover, the present study strongly 
suggests that the Zag ABD fusion strategy can be potentially used as a universal 
method to improve the pharmokinetics properties of many others therapeutics 
proteins and peptides in order to improve their dosing schedule and clinical 
effects.

Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia in the elderly 
population. Currently, there are no effective treatments to prevent or delay the 
natural course of the disease. Numerous studies have provided information about 
the molecular processes underlying biological ageing and, perhaps more 
importantly, potential interventions to slow ageing and promote healthy 
longevity in laboratory model systems. The main issue addressed in this review 
is whether an intervention that has anti-ageing properties can alter the 
appearance and/or progression of Alzheimer's disease, a disease in which age is 
the biggest risk factor. Different anti-ageing interventions have been shown to 
prevent (and in some cases possibly restore) several parameters recognised as 
central symptoms to the development of Alzheimer's disease. In addition, they 
are taking the first steps towards translating these laboratory discoveries into 
clinical applications.

As part of its single technology appraisal (STA) process, the National Institute 
for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) invited the manufacturer (UCB Pharma) of 
certolizumab pegol (CZP; Cimzia®) to submit evidence of its clinical and cost 
effectiveness for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) following 
inadequate response to a tumour necrosis factor-α inhibitor (TNFi). The School 
of Health and Related Research Technology Appraisal Group at the University of 
Sheffield was commissioned to act as the independent Evidence Review Group 
(ERG). The ERG produced a detailed review of the evidence for the clinical and 
cost effectiveness of the technology, based upon the company's submission to 
NICE. The clinical effectiveness evidence in the company's submission for CZP 
was based predominantly on six randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the 
efficacy of CZP against placebo. The clinical effectiveness review identified no 
head-to-head evidence on the efficacy of CZP against the comparators within the 
scope; therefore, the company performed a network meta-analysis (NMA). The 
company's NMA concluded that CZP had a similar efficacy to that of its 
comparators. The company submitted a Markov model that assessed the incremental 
cost effectiveness of CZP versus comparator biologic disease-modifying 
antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) for the treatment of RA from the perspective of 
the National Health Service for three decision problems, each of which followed 
an inadequate response to a TNFi. These were (1) a comparison against rituximab 
(RTX) in combination with methotrexate (MTX); (2) a comparison against bDMARDs 
when RTX was contraindicated or withdrawn due to an adverse event; and (3) a 
comparison against bDMARDs when MTX was contraindicated or withdrawn due to an 
adverse event. Results from the company's economic evaluation showed that CZP 
resulted in a similar number of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) produced at 
similar or lower costs compared with comparator bDMARDs. The 
commercial-in-confidence patient access schemes for abatacept and tocilizumab 
could not be incorporated by the company, but were incorporated by the ERG in a 
confidential appendix for the NICE Appraisal Committee (AC). The company 
estimated that the addition of CZP before RTX in a sequence for patients who 
could receive MTX produced more QALYs at an increased cost, with a cost per QALY 
of £33,222. Following a critique of the model, the ERG undertook exploratory 
analyses that did not change the conclusions reached based on the company's 
economic evaluation in relation to the comparison with bDMARDs. The ERG 
estimated that where CZP replaced RTX, CZP was dominated, as it produced fewer 
QALYs at an increased cost. The AC concluded that there was little difference in 
effectiveness between CZP and comparator bDMARDs and that equivalence among 
bDMARDs could be accepted. The AC consequently recommended CZP plus MTX for 
people for whom RTX is contraindicated or not tolerated and CZP monotherapy for 
people for whom MTX is contraindicated or not tolerated. The AC concluded that 
CZP plus MTX could not be considered a cost-effective use of National Health 
Service resources when RTX plus MTX is a treatment option.

Persons aged ≥65years not only account for over 60% of venous thromboembolism 
(VTE) events, they have also a higher mortality and VTE-related morbidity than 
younger patients, including anticoagulation-related bleeding and the 
postthrombotic syndrome. However, only few studies have focused specifically on 
VTE in older persons and practice guidelines commonly extrapolate study results 
from younger healthier patients to the multimorbid elderly. Evidence suggests 
that the clinical presentation is more subtle in the elderly with VTE and that 
commonly used diagnostic modalities, including clinical prediction rules, 
D-dimer tests, and planar ventilation-perfusion scans are less specific and 
efficient in older persons. Moreover, because preventive and therapeutic 
anticoagulation trials often exclude elderly multimorbid patients who have an 
increased risk of bleeding, the optimal prophylactic approach in medical 
inpatients and the best therapeutic anticoagulation strategy in patients with 
confirmed VTE are uncertain in such patients. In this narrative review, we 
summarize the evidence on the risk, prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and 
prognosis of VTE in older patients. We also propose a research agenda to 
increase the evidence basis on VTE in older patients to optimize their quality 
of care. Given the fact that the incidence of elderly persons with VTE is likely 
to rise, future VTE research should attempt to enroll elderly multimorbid 
patients into pragmatic clinical trials and to increasingly incorporate 
patient-centered universal outcomes, such as health-related quality of life, 
functional status, symptom burden, and active life expectancy.

INTRODUCTION: The epidemiological and social relevance of dementia and mild 
cognitive impairment increases with life expectancy and prevalence of metabolic 
disorders. The recognition of an important role for dietary nutrients on 
cognitive functioning opens new preventive strategies. This work analyses the 
association between erythrocyte omega-3 index and omega-6 / omega-3 ratio and 
cognitive performance/ mild cognitive impairment.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: We selected a random sample of individuals registered at a 
health centre aged ≥ 55 years. Participants were asked about their alimentary 
habits, erythrocyte indexes were determined and neuropsychological evaluation 
included the Montreal Cognitive Assessment and a comprehensive test battery.
RESULTS: Mean age of 90 participants was 64 years (sd = 5.6), 71.1% had four 
years of education and 40% of them had more than one vascular risk factor. 
Limits for omega-3 index and omega-6 / omega-3 ratio were 2.90 - 9.79 (mean = 
6.20; sd = 1.50) and 1.14 - 2.95 (mean = 2.12; sd = 0.39), respectively. 
Montreal Cognitive Assessment scores ranged from 10 to 29 (mean = 22; sd = 4.5), 
increasing on average 1 - 2 points for above average omega-3 values and an 
omega-6 / omega-3 ratio ≤ 2 (Group 1) and decreasing 5 - 6 points for omega-3 
below mean values and the same omega-6 / omega-3 ratio (Group 2). Prevalence of 
mild cognitive impairment was 25.6% (95% CI: 16.4 - 34.7), ranging from 12.5% to 
83.3% in the two groups above.
DISCUSSION: This preliminary study is one of the first analyzing the 
repercussion of omega-3 index and omega-6 / omega-3 ratio on cognitive 
functioning, considering additionally the participant clinical and dietary 
profiles.
CONCLUSION: The association found suggests that omega-3 and omega-6 / omega-3 
ratio could be important biomarkers in the prevention of cognitive impairment.

Publisher: Introdução: A relevância epidemiológica e social da demência e do 
défice cognitivo ligeiro aumenta com a esperança de vida e prevalência das 
doenças metabólicas. O reconhecimento da importância dos nutrientes no 
funcionamento cognitivo perspectiva novas estratégias preventivas. Neste 
trabalho analisamos a associação entre os valores do índice ómega-3 e da razão 
ómega-6 / ómega-3 e desempenho cognitivo/ défice cognitivo ligeiro. Material e 
Métodos: Selecionamos uma amostra aleatória de utentes de um centro de saúde com 
idade ≥ 55 anos, que foram inquiridos sobre hábitos alimentares e sujeitos a 
avaliação neuropsicológica, incluindo o Montreal Cognitive Assessment, e 
determinando-se os índices indicados. Resultados: Os 90 participantes tinham em 
média 64 anos (dp = 5,6), 71,1% quatro anos de escolaridade e 40% mais de um 
factor de risco vascular. Os limites dos valores de ómega-3 e da razão ómega-6 / 
ómega-3 foram respectivamente 2,90 - 9,79 (média = 6,20; dp = 1,50) e 1,14 - 
2,95 (média = 2,12; dp = 0,39). A pontuação no Montreal Cognitive Assessment 
variou entre 10 - 29 (média = 22,0; dp = 4,5), aumentando em média 1 - 2 pontos 
para valores de ómega-3 acima da média e uma razão ómega-6 / ómega-3 ≤ 2 
(Grupo 1) e diminuindo 5 - 6 pontos para um valor de ómega-3 abaixo da média e a 
mesma razão ómega-6 / ómega-3 (Grupo 2). A prevalência de défice cognitivo 
ligeiro foi 25,6% (IC 95%:16,4 - 34,7%), variando entre 12,5% e 83,3% nos dois 
grupos mencionados. Discussão: Este estudo preliminar é um dos primeiros a 
analisar a repercussão do índice ómega-3 e da razão ómega-6 / ómega-3 na função 
cognitiva, considerando adicionalmente o perfil clínico e consumo alimentar dos 
participantes. Conclusão: A associação encontrada sugere que o índice ómega-3 e 
a razão ómega-6 / ómega-3 podem ser biomarcadores importantes na prevenção da 
deterioração cognitiva.

The present study investigates the effects of α-amylase (6 and 10ppm), xylanase 
(70 and 120ppm) and cellulase (35 and 60ppm) on the rheological properties of 
bread dough. The mixing property of dough was measured by using a DoughLAB. The 
extension and stickiness of dough were analysed using the Texture Analyzer. The 
results illustrate that the addition of single enzyme and enzyme combinations 
can increase the extensibility, softening, mixing tolerance index (MTI) and 
stickiness, whereas decrease the resistance to extension. For water absorption, 
the addition of single enzyme had no significant effect, while the combination 
enzyme significantly (p<0.05) decreased the values from 63.9 to 59.6% (wheat 
flour dough) and 71.4-67.1% (dough incorporated with 15% wheat bran). Compared 
to the single enzyme with the value of 34.1mm, enzyme combination (6, 120 and 
60ppm) increased the extensibility of wheat flour dough by up to 42%. 
Additionally, combination of α-amylase, xylanase and cellulase had a synergetic 
effect on the dough rheology.

PURPOSE: We assessed the impact of focal therapy on perioperative, oncologic and 
functional outcomes in men who underwent salvage robotic assisted radical 
prostatectomy compared to primary robotic assisted radical prostatectomy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Focal therapy was performed in patients presenting with 
Gleason score 3 + 3 or 3 + 4, clinical stage cT2a or less, serum prostate 
specific antigen 15 ng/ml or less, unilateral positive biopsy, maximum length of 
any positive core less than 10 mm and life expectancy greater than 10 years. 
Focal therapy was defined as target ablation of the index lesion plus a 1 cm 
safety margin in the normal ipsilateral prostatic parenchyma. The salvage group 
included 22 men who underwent salvage prostatectomy after focal therapy failure. 
The primary group was defined using matched pair 1:2 selection of 44 of 2,750 
patients treated with primary prostatectomy. The primary and secondary end 
points were the between group differences in functional and oncologic outcomes, 
respectively.
RESULTS: Complication rates were comparable (p >0.05). Pad-free probability was 
comparable between the groups at 1 and 2 years (p = 0.8). Recovery of erectile 
function was significantly lower after salvage robotic assisted radical 
prostatectomy (p = 0.008), which also showed a significantly lower probability 
of cumulative biochemical recurrence-free survival compared to primary robotic 
assisted radical prostatectomy (56.3% vs 92.4% at 2 years, p = 0.001). Salvage 
prostatectomy demonstrated a significantly increased risk of biochemical 
recurrence (HR 4.8, 95% CI 1.67-13.76, p = 0.004). Study limitations included 
the retrospective nature, the lack of randomization and the short followup.
CONCLUSIONS: Salvage robotic assisted radical prostatectomy after focal therapy 
failure is feasible with acceptable complication rates. However, patients 
assigned to primary focal therapy should be advised about a poorer prognosis in 
terms of oncologic control and lower erectile recovery rates in case of a future 
salvage surgery.

BACKGROUND: Until recently, advanced melanoma (unresectable and metastatic) has 
had a poor prognosis and has been treated with chemotherapy. The introduction of 
new treatments (BRAF and MEK inhibitors and immunotherapy) has improved overall 
survival and progression-free survival of some patients.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to review the published evidence on 
the cost-effectiveness of pharmacological treatments for advanced melanoma.
METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted, without date or language 
restrictions, in PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, the Cochrane Library, the UK National 
Institute for Health and Care Excellence databases and the Health Technology 
Assessment journal. Internet searches were also made to identify possible grey 
literature. Main study characteristics, methods and outcomes were extracted and 
critically assessed. The quality of health economic studies was assessed by the 
Quality Assessment of Economic Evaluation in Health Care checklist.
RESULTS: The search identified nine full-text pharmacoeconomic analyses of 
advanced melanoma treatments. According to the economic analyses published in 
the articles, the new treatments have been shown to be more effective (with more 
life-years and quality-adjusted life-years) than chemotherapy, although 
generally the cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained was above the commonly 
accepted threshold. Because of the variability of the available analyses 
comparing the new treatments, we cannot determine which treatment is the most 
cost-effective.
CONCLUSIONS: From the available data, it cannot be concluded that the new drugs 
(BRAF and MEK inhibitors and immunotherapy) are cost effective compared with 
chemotherapy or which is the most cost-effective new treatment.

subobscura.

Sciences , Sendai , Japan.

We developed a new paradigm for quantitative analysis of courtship behavior in 
flies, Fly Motion-detector with an Actuator-Coupled Stimulator (FlyMacs), in 
which the stimulation of a fly with a moving visual target and recording of 
induced behaviors are automated under computer control. We employ FlyMacs for 
the identification of motion features that trigger specific courtship elements 
in Drosophila subobscura, whose mating is suggested to be strongly vision 
dependent. A female abdomen attached to the actuator, when moved in an 
appropriate pattern, evokes in the test male tapping-like foreleg motions, 
midleg swing and proboscis extension, which are considered to be elementary 
actions in male courtship behavior. Tapping is primarily induced when the target 
is moving, whereas midleg swing and proboscis extension are most frequently 
observed after the target stops moving. In contrast to midleg swing, which tends 
to occur immediately after target cessation (∼3000 ms), the incidence of 
proboscis extension gradually increases with time after target cessation, 
reaching a plateau at 3000 ms. The results suggest that tapping, midleg swing 
and proboscis extension are each induced by different movement features of the 
visual target. These findings do not support the view that a single key stimulus 
induces the entire courtship ritual. Rather, courtship behaviors in D. 
subobscura are correlated with movement and position of the target, which 
suggests that D. subobscura uses sensory information to pattern its courtship.

In the current era of therapy for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), life 
expectancy for persons living with HIV (PLWH) approaches that of the general 
population. This newly prolonged survival among PLWH is associated with an 
increased prevalence of comorbidities due to the inflammation, immune activation 
and immune senescence associated with HIV infection. Higher prevalence of 
tobacco and alcohol use, co-infection with viral hepatitis and traditional 
cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension and hyperlipidemia contribute 
as well. In this review, we hope to describe the current comorbidities occurring 
among PLWH and bring increased awareness for conditions that may otherwise not 
be considered given the younger age at time of presentation.

Are ACE Inhibitors and Beta-blockers Dangerous in Patients at Risk for 
Anaphylaxis?

The objective of this article is to review the available studies regarding 
angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and beta-blockers and their 
effect on patients at risk for anaphylaxis. A literature search was conducted in 
PUBMED to identify peer-reviewed articles using the following keywords: 
anaphylaxis, ACE inhibitor, beta-blocker, food allergy, radiocontrast media, 
venom allergy, skin testing, and immunotherapy. Some studies show an increased 
risk of anaphylaxis in patients who are taking ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers, 
whereas others studies do not show an increased risk. For venom immunotherapy, 
there are more data supporting the concomitant use of beta-blockers and ACE 
inhibitors in the build-up and maintenance phases. Most of the medical 
literature is limited to case reports and retrospective data. Prospective 
controlled trials are needed on this important topic. For those patients at risk 
of anaphylaxis who lack cardiovascular disease, it is recommended to avoid 
beta-blockers and possibly ACE inhibitors. However, for those patients with 
cardiovascular disease, beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors have been shown to 
increase life expectancy. Consideration should be given for the concomitant use 
of these medications while patients are receiving venom immunotherapy.

Thrombotic diseases caused by cancer progression have been reported as one of 
the major causes of cancer associated morbidity and mortality along with cancer 
invasiveness and infectious complications. Moreover, anticoagulant therapy with 
heparin and heparin-like drugs, or vitamin K antagonists, or the Direct Oral 
Anticoagulants, is seeing an extended application in cancer patients and offers 
prolonged life expectancy to oncology patients for whom blood activation and 
thrombotic events have a variable incidence, depending on cancer type. 
Laboratory tools are highly useful for identifying patients at thrombotic risk 
through the measurement of blood activation markers and selecting those 
appropriate for anticoagulant therapy. Among the pathological markers, DDimer or 
Extracellular Vesicles have the highest diagnostic value in these pathological 
conditions. Global assays are useful for dosage adjustment, such as assessing 
either an induced anticoagulant effect or the measurement of drug activity. 
Various assays are also developed such as platelet aggregometry techniques for 
evaluating drug induced- aggregates or methods allowing measurement of the drug 
activity to its targeted coagulation factors such as: heparin to thrombin or 
Factor Xa; DOACs to Thrombin or Factor Xa (Dabigatran to thrombin and DiXaIs, 
Rivaroxaban, Apixaban, and Edoxaban, to Factor Xa). Such explorative techniques 
help to find the right dosage adjustment to protect patients from developing 
thrombosis without exposing them bleeding. It also permits exploration of 
unexpected drug behavior in treated patients, to check the right adherence to 
therapy in long-term anticoagulant protocols, and prevention of bleeding in 
patients with impaired renal or hepatic function. Complementary use of blood 
activation markers brings additional information on the curative effects of the 
anticoagulant therapy, and allows identification of pro-thrombotic activity in 
the clinically silent state. These issues are concisely addressed below.

[Primary care in Italy].

[Article in Spanish]

Italy is not a country where Spanish doctors emigrate, as there is an 
over-supply of health care professionals. The Italian Servizio Sanitario 
Nazionale has some differences compared to the Spanish National Health System. 
The Servizio Sanitario Nazionale is financed by national and regional taxes and 
co-payments. There are taxes earmarked for health, and Primary Care receives 50% 
of the total funds. Italian citizens and residents in Italy have the right to 
free health cover. However, there are co-payments for laboratory and imaging 
tests, pharmaceuticals, specialist ambulatory services, and emergencies. 
Co-payments vary in the different regions. The provision of services is 
regional, and thus fragmentation and major inequities are the norm. Doctors in 
Primary Care are self-employed and from 2000 onwards, there are incentives to 
work in multidisciplinary teams. Salary is regulated by a national contract and 
it is the sum of per-capita payments and extra resources for specific 
activities. Responsibilities are similar to those of Spanish professionals. 
However, medical care is more personal. Relationships between Primary Care and 
specialised care depend on the doctors' relationships. Primary Care doctors are 
gatekeepers for specialised care, except for gynaecology, obstetrics and 
paediatrics. Specialised training is compulsory in order to work as general 
practitioner. The Italian Health Care System is a national health system like
