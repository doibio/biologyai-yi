INTRODUCTION: In 2021, KEYNOTE-590 (NCT03189719) showed that pembrolizumab plus 
5-fluorouracil and cisplatin (PPF) has more benefits than 5-fluorouracil and 
cisplatin (PF) as a first-line regimen to treat individuals with advanced 
esophageal cancer. However, given that it is expensive, controversies over the 
value of using this compared to competitive strategies remain. Hence, we 
conducted a cost-effectiveness evaluation of pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy.
METHODS: A Markov model was applied in evaluating the efficacy and cost of PPF 
and PF over a 7-year horizon and measured the health outcomes in life-years 
(LYs), quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio (ICER). The economic data included were relevant to patients in the USA 
and China. We also performed one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses to 
determine the uncertainties relevant to the model. Willingness to pay thresholds 
(WTP) of $150,000/QALY (USA) and $35,673/QALY (China) were used to calculate a 
probability for the cost-effectiveness of PPF.
RESULTS: PPF yielded 0.386-0.607 QALYs (0.781-1.195 LYs) compared with PF. In 
our analysis, compared with receiving PF, patients with advanced esophageal 
cancer receiving PPF had an ICER of $577,461/QALY in the USA and $258,261/QALY 
in China, those for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma were $550,211/QALY in the 
USA and $244,580/QALY in China, and a programmed cell death ligand 1 combined 
positive score (PD-L1 CPS) ≥ 10 was associated with a cost of $479,119/QALY in 
the USA and $201,355/QALY in China. Sensitivity analysis found the price of 
pembrolizumab to be the biggest influence.
CONCLUSION: From the economic perspectives of the USA and China, a first-line 
regimen of PPF for esophageal cancer therapy may not be as cost-effective as PF. 
However, patients with esophageal cancer and PD-L1 CPS ≥ 10 may gain the most 
LYs from initial PPF treatment.

Background: Mammography is generally recommended for breast cancer survivors. 
However, discussion is ongoing about stopping surveillance mammography when life 
expectancy is <5-10 years as the benefit of screening might be diminished toward 
the end of life. The utilization pattern of mammography in the last year of life 
among this population has not been well studied. Methods: We identified 58,736 
females diagnosed with breast cancer between January 2002 and December 2015, who 
died at the age of at least 67, from the SEER-Medicare database. We examined the 
utilization patterns of mammography during their last year of life and 
investigated factors associated with the use of mammography at the end of life 
using a multivariable logistic regression model. Results: Overall, 28.5% of the 
patients received mammography during the last year of life. Multivariable 
logistic regression showed that older age (OR = 0.31, 95% CI = 0.29-0.34, 
p < 0.001 for 95 vs. 85 years old), more advanced cancer stage (OR = 0.22, 95% 
CI = 0.20-0.24 p < 0.001 for distant vs. localized disease), and higher 
comorbidity score (OR = 0.92, 95% CI = 0.91-0.93, p < 0.001 for every 1-point 
increase) were associated with less mammography use. Age was nonlinearly 
associated with mammography use, with a steady proportion of patients receiving 
a mammography until approximately age 80 and then a sharp decrease thereafter. 
Conclusion: This population-based study found that a sizable proportion of older 
breast cancer survivors received mammography during the last year of life.

BACKGROUND: Living not just longer, but also cognitively healthier, and more 
independent lives is essential if European countries are to cope with the 
financial challenges that the shifting age composition of Europe's population 
presents. Here we investigate the change in life expectancy (LE) spent with good 
and poor cognitive function among older adults across Europe.
METHODS: LE with good/poor cognitive function was estimated by the Sullivan 
Method. Cross-sectional data on cognitive functioning was obtained from 23,213 
(wave 1, 2004-05) and 40,874 (wave 6, 2015) 50+-year-olds of the Survey of 
Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE). Information on mortality was 
obtained from the Eurostat Database. Results for 70+-year-olds were emphasized.
RESULTS: LE with good cognitive function increased with 1.6 years from 10.7 
years (95% CI: 10.6-10.9) in 2004-05 to 12.4 years (95% CI: 12.3-12.5) in 2015 
for 70+-year-olds. Disparity was observed across sex and region. In 2004-05, a 
70+-year-old woman could expect to spend 30.9% (95% CI: 29.4-32.4) of her 
remaining LE with poor cognitive function compared to 27.7% (95% CI: 26.0 -29.4) 
for men. In 2015, women (24.4% (95% CI: 23.4-25.3)) had considerably caught up 
with men (24.8% (95% CI:23.7.25.8)), shifting the pattern in favor of women. In 
2004-05 and 2015, Northern Europeans had the lowest LE with poor cognitive 
function while Southern Europeans had the highest, but made the most improvement 
during the period.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall we find that LE with poor cognitive function has been 
compressed in the European population of 70+-year-olds.

BACKGROUND: Data on the burden of stroke and changing trends at national and 
subnational levels are necessary for policymakers to allocate recourses 
appropriately. This study presents estimates of the stroke burden from 1990 to 
2019 using the results of the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2019 study.
METHODS: For the GBD 2019, verbal autopsy and vital registration data were used 
to estimate stroke mortality. Cause-specific mortality served as the basis for 
estimating incidence, prevalence, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). 
The burden attributable to stroke risk factors was calculated by a comparative 
risk assessment. Decomposition analysis was applied to determine the 
contribution of population aging, population growth, and changes in the 
age-specific incidence rates.
RESULTS: In 2019, the number of prevalent cases, incident cases, and deaths due 
to stroke in Iran were 963,512; 102,778; and 40,912, respectively. The 
age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR) and the age-standardized death rate 
(ASDR) decreased from 1990 to 2019. Of national stroke ASDRs in 2019, 44.7% 
(35.7-54.7%) were attributable to hypertension and 28.8% (15.2-57.4) to high 
fasting plasma glucose. At the subnational level, the trend of the stroke 
incidence and mortality rate decreased in all provinces. Stroke was responsible 
for 4.48% of total DALYs in 2019 (3.38% due to ischemic stroke, 0.87% due to 
intracerebral hemorrhage, and 0.22% due to subarachnoid hemorrhage).
CONCLUSION: ASIR and ASDR of stroke are decreasing nationally and subnationally; 
however, the number of incident cases and deaths are increasing in all SDI 
quintiles, possibly due to population growth.

OBJECTIVES: Little evidence exists on costs or cost-effectiveness of online 
interventions for caregivers of people living with dementia. We aimed to assess 
cost-effectiveness of online cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for dementia 
caregivers with mild-to-moderate depression/anxiety, with or without telephone 
support, relative to a psychoeducational control treatment.
DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness study of data from 3-armed randomized controlled 
trial comparing computerized CBT (cCBT) or telephone-supported cCBT 
(cCBT+Telephone) to modular online educational program on dementia 
(Psychoeducation).
SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: UK-resident adult dementia caregivers with 
mild-to-moderate anxiety/depression.
COST-EFFECTIVENESS ANALYSIS: We calculated health and social care costs, from 
participant-reported data collected at baseline, 12, 26 weeks, costs of 
intervention delivery. We examined 3 outcomes: cost of one-point reduction in 
General Health Questionnaire-12 (GHQ-12) rating at 26-weeks, cost of prevented 
"caseness" on GHQ-12 at 26 weeks, and cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) 
based on Short Form-6 Dimensions (SF-6D) over 26 weeks.
RESULTS: Data from 176 participants (44 cCBT, 91 cCBT+Telephone, 41 
Psychoeducation) were analyzed. Costs did not differ between cCBT and 
Psychoeducation; costs were £125 higher in cCBT+Telephone. Control and 
intervention groups did not differ on GHQ-12. Caseness was lower in 
cCBT+Telephone than Psychoeducation; cost of preventing a case was £610, and 
probability of cost-effectiveness on this outcome reached 98.5% at willingness 
to pay (WTP) of £12,900. Mean QALY did not differ between cCBT+Telephone and 
Psychoeducation. QALY gain in cCBT was 0.01 (95% CI 0.001, 0.021). Cost per QALY 
was £8130. Although base case probability of cost-effectiveness of cCBT was 93% 
at WTP-per-QALY of £27,600, sensitivity analyses suggested cCBT+Telephone was 
the more cost-effective.
CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: We report preliminary evidence for adopting 
telephone-supported online CBT. This may be cost-effective in preventing a case 
of mental health disorder if, absent a societally accepted WTP threshold for 
this outcome, payers are willing to pay £12,900. Future research should 
investigate whether supported/unsupported online CBT improves health-related 
quality of life.

The burdens and trends of gastric cancer are poorly understood, especially in 
high-prevalence countries. Based on the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019, we 
analyzed the incidence, death, and possible risk factors of gastric cancer in 
five Asian countries, in relation to year, age, sex, and sociodemographic index. 
The annual percentage change was calculated to estimate the trends in 
age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR) and age-standardized death rate (ASDR). 
The highest ASIR per 100,000 person-years in 2019 was in Mongolia [44 (95% 
uncertainty interval (UI), 34 to 55)], while the lowest was in the Democratic 
People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) [23 (95% UI, 19 to 29)]. The highest ASDR per 
100,000 person-years was in Mongolia [46 (95% UI, 37 to 57)], while the lowest 
was in Japan [14 (95% UI, 12 to 15)]. Despite the increase in the absolute 
number of cases and deaths from 1990 to 2019, the ASIRs and ASDRs in all five 
countries decreased with time and improved sociodemographic index but increased 
with age. Smoking and a high-sodium diet were two possible risk factors for 
gastric cancer. In 2019, the proportion of age-standardized disability-adjusted 
life-years attributable to smoking was highest in Japan [23% (95% UI, 19 to 
28%)], and the proportions attributable to a high-sodium diet were highest in 
China [8.8% (95% UI, 0.21 to 33%)], DPRK, and the Republic of Korea. There are 
substantial variations in the incidence and death of gastric cancer in the five 
studied Asian countries. This study may be crucial in helping policymakers to 
make better decisions and allocate appropriate resources.

OBJECTIVE: To analyse the cost-effectiveness of multicomponent interventions 
designed to improve outcomes in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in primary care 
in the Canary Islands, Spain, within the INDICA randomised clinical trial, from 
the public health system perspective.
DESIGN: An economic evaluation was conducted for the within-trial period 
(2 years) comparing the four arms of the INDICA study.
SETTING: Primary care in the Canary Islands, Spain.
PARTICIPANTS: 2334 patients with T2DM without complications were included.
INTERVENTIONS: Interventions for patients (PTI), for primary care professionals 
(PFI), for both (combined intervention arm for patients and professionals, CBI) 
and usual care (UC) as a control group.
OUTCOMES: The main outcome was the incremental cost per quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALY). Only the intervention and the healthcare costs were included.
ANALYSIS: Multilevel models were used to estimate results, and to measure the 
size and significance of incremental changes. Missed values were treated by 
means of multiple imputations procedure.
RESULTS: There were no differences between arms in terms of costs (p=0.093), 
while some differences were observed in terms of QALYs after 2 years of 
follow-up (p=0.028). PFI and CBI arms were dominated by the other two arms, PTI 
and UC. The differences between the PTI and the UC arms were very small in terms 
of QALYs, but significant in terms of healthcare costs (p=0.045). The total cost 
of the PTI arm (€2571, 95% CI €2317 to €2826) was lower than the cost in the UC 
arm (€2750, 95% CI €2506 to €2995), but this difference did not reach 
statistical significance. Base case estimates of the incremental cost per QALY 
indicate that the PTI strategy was the cost-effective option.
CONCLUSIONS: The INDICA intervention designed for patients with T2DM and 
families is likely to be cost-effective from the public healthcare perspective. 
A cost-effectiveness model should explore this in the long term.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the incremental value of new drugs across disease areas 
receiving favourable coverage decisions by the UK's National Institute for 
Health and Care Excellence (NICE) over the past decade.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional study assessed 
favourable appraisal decisions of drugs between 1 January 2010 and 31 December 
2020. Estimates of incremental benefit were extracted from NICE's evidence 
review groups reports.
PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURE: Incremental benefit of novel drugs relative to the best 
alternative therapeutic option, expressed in quality-adjusted life-years 
(QALYs).
RESULTS: 184 appraisals of 129 drugs provided QALYs. The median incremental 
value was 0.27 QALY (IQR: 0.07-0.73). Benefits varied across drug-indication 
pairs (range: -0.49 to 5.22 QALY). The highest median benefits were found in 
haematology (0.70, IQR: 0.55-1.22) and oncology (0.46, IQR: 0.20-0.88), the 
lowest in ophthalmology (0.09, IQR: 0.04-0.22) and endocrinology (0.02, IQR: 
0.01-0.06). Eight appraisals (4.3%) found contributions of more than two QALYs, 
but one in four (50/184) drug-indication pairs provided less than the equivalent 
of 1 month in perfect health compared to existing treatments.
CONCLUSIONS: In our review period, the median incremental value of novel drugs 
approved for use within the English National Health System, relative to the best 
alternative therapeutic option, was equivalent to 3-4 months of life in perfect 
health, but data were heterogeneous. Objective evaluations of therapeutic value 
helps patients and physicians to develop reasonable expectations of drugs and 
delivers insights into disease areas where medicinal therapeutic progress has 
had the most and least impact.

Hip fractures are a serious public health issue with major consequences, 
especially for frail community dwellers. This study found a poor prognosis at 
6 months post-trauma with regard to life expectancy and rehabilitation to 
pre-fracture independency levels. It should be realized that recovery to 
pre-trauma functioning is not a certainty for frail community-dwelling patients.
INTRODUCTION: Proximal femoral fractures are a serious public health issue in 
the older patient. Although a significant rise in frail community-dwelling 
elderly is expected because of progressive aging, a clear overview of the 
outcomes in these patients sustaining a proximal femoral fracture is lacking. 
This study assessed the prognosis of frail community-dwelling patients who 
sustained a proximal femoral fracture.
METHODS: A multicenter retrospective cohort study was performed on frail 
community-dwelling patients with a proximal femoral fracture who aged over 
70 years. Patients were considered frail if they were classified as American 
Society of Anesthesiologists score ≥ 4 and/or a BMI < 18.5 kg/m2 and/or 
Functional Ambulation Category ≤ 2 pre-trauma. The primary outcome was 6-month 
mortality. Secondary outcomes were adverse events, health care consumption, rate 
of institutionalization, and functional recovery.
RESULTS: A total of 140 out of 2045 patients matched the inclusion criteria with 
a median age of 85 (P25-P75 80-89) years. The 6-month mortality was 58 out of 
140 patients (41%). A total of 102 (73%) patients experienced adverse events. At 
6 months post-trauma, 29 out of 120 (24%) were readmitted to the hospital. Out 
of the 82 surviving patients after 6 months, 41 (50%) were unable the return to 
their home, and only 32 (39%) were able to achieve outdoor ambulation.
CONCLUSION: Frail community-dwelling older patients with a proximal femoral 
fracture have a high risk of death, adverse events, and institutionalization and 
often do not reobtain their pre-trauma level of independence. Foremost, the 
results can be used for realistic expectation management.

INTRODUCTION: Due to the effectiveness of combined antiretroviral therapy and 
its growing availability worldwide, most people living with HIV (PLHIV) have a 
near-normal life expectancy. However, PLHIV continue to face various health and 
social challenges that severely impact their health-related quality-of-life 
(HRQoL). The UNAIDS Global AIDS Strategy discusses the need to optimize 
quality-of-life, but no guidance was given regarding which instruments were 
appropriate measures of HRQoL. This study aimed to review and assess the use of 
HRQoL instruments for PLHIV.
METHODS: We conducted a global systematic review and meta-analysis, searching 
five databases for studies published between January 2010 and February 2021 that 
assessed HRQoL among PLHIV aged 16 years and over. Multivariable regression 
analyses were performed to identify factors associated with the choice of HRQoL 
instruments. We examined the domains covered by each instrument. Random-effects 
meta-analysis was conducted to explore the average completion rates of HRQoL 
instruments.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: From 714 publications, we identified 65 different HRQoL 
instruments. The most commonly used instruments were the World Health 
Organization Quality-of-Life- HIV Bref (WHOQOL-HIV BREF)-19%, Medical Outcome 
Survey-HIV (MOS-HIV)-17%, Short Form-36 (SF-36)-12%, European Quality-of-Life 
Instrument-5 Dimension (EQ-5D)-10%, World Health Organization Quality-of-Life 
Bref (WHOQOL BREF)-8%, Short Form-12 (SF-12)-7% and HIV/AIDS Targeted 
Quality-of-Life (HAT-QOL)-6%. There were greater odds of using HIV-specific 
instruments for middle- and low-income countries (than high-income countries), 
studies in the Americas and Europe (than Africa) and target population of PLHIV 
only (than both PLHIV and people without HIV). Domains unique to the 
HIV-specific instruments were worries about death, stigma and HIV disclosure. 
There were no significant differences in completion rates between different 
HRQoL instruments. The overall pooled completion rate was 95.9% (95% CI: 
94.7-97.0, I2 = 99.2%, p < 0.01); some heterogeneity was explained by 
country-income level and study type.
CONCLUSIONS: A wide range of instruments have been used to assess HRQoL in 
PLHIV, and the choice of instrument might be based on their different 
characteristics and reason for application. Although completion rates were high, 
future studies should explore the feasibility of implementing these instruments 
and the appropriateness of domains covered by each instrument.

PURPOSE: This study aimed to estimate the cost-effectiveness of exome sequencing 
(ES) and genome sequencing (GS) for children.
METHODS: We modeled costs, diagnoses, and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) 
for diagnostic strategies for critically ill infants (aged <1 year) and children 
(aged <18 years) with suspected genetic conditions: (1) standard of care (SOC) 
testing, (2) ES, (3) GS, (4) SOC followed by ES, (5) SOC followed by GS, (6) ES 
followed by GS, and (7) SOC followed by ES followed by GS. We calculated the 
10-year incremental cost per additional diagnosis, and lifetime incremental cost 
per QALY gained, from a health care perspective.
RESULTS: First-line GS costs $15,048 per diagnosis vs SOC for infants and 
$27,349 per diagnosis for children. If GS is unavailable, ES represents the next 
most efficient option compared with SOC ($15,543 per diagnosis for infants and 
$28,822 per diagnosis for children). Other strategies provided the same or fewer 
diagnoses at a higher incremental cost per diagnosis. Lifetime results depend on 
the patient's assumed long-term prognosis after diagnosis. For infants, GS 
ranged from cost-saving (vs all alternatives) to $18,877 per QALY (vs SOC). For 
children, GS (vs SOC) ranged from $119,705 to $490,047 per QALY.
CONCLUSION: First-line GS may be the most cost-effective strategy for diagnosing 
infants with suspected genetic conditions. For all children, GS may be 
cost-effective under certain assumptions. ES is nearly as efficient as GS and 
hence is a viable option when GS is unavailable.

BACKGROUND: Better evaluation of existing health programmes, appropriate policy 
making against emerging health threats, and reducing inequalities in Iran rely 
on a comprehensive national and subnational breakdown of the burden of diseases, 
injuries, and risk factors.
METHODS: In this systematic analysis, we present the national and subnational 
estimates of the burden of disease in Iran using the Global Burden of Disease 
Study 2019. We report trends in demographics, all-cause and cause-specific 
mortality, as well as years of life lost (YLLs), years lived with disability 
(YLDs), and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) caused by major diseases and 
risk factors. A multi-intervention segmented-regression model was used to 
explore the overall impact of health sector changes and sanctions. For this 
analysis, we used a variety of sources and reports, including vital 
registration, census, and survey data to provide estimates of mortality and 
morbidity at the national and subnational level in Iran.
FINDINGS: Iran, which had 84·3 million inhabitants in 2019, had a life 
expectancy of 79·6 years (95% uncertainty interval 79·2-79·9) in female 
individuals and 76·1 (75·6-76·5) in male individuals, an increase compared with 
1990. The number of DALYs remained stable and reached 19·8 million (17·3-22·6) 
in 2019, of which 78·1% were caused by non-communicable diseases (NCDs) compared 
with 43·0% in 1990. During the study period, age-standardised DALY rates and YLL 
rates decreased considerably; however, YLDs remained nearly constant. The share 
of age-standardised YLDs contributing to the DALY rate steadily increased to 
44·5% by 2019. With regard to the DALY rates of different provinces, 
inequalities were decreasing. From 1990 to 2019, although the number of DALYs 
attributed to all risk factors decreased by 16·8%, deaths attributable to all 
risk factors substantially grew by 43·8%. The regression results revealed a 
significant negative association between sanctions and health status.
INTERPRETATION: The Iranian health-care system is encountering NCDs as its new 
challenge, which necessitates a coordinated multisectoral approach. Although the 
Iranian health-care system has been successful to some extent in controlling 
mortality, it has overlooked the burden of morbidity and need for 
rehabilitation. We did not capture alleviation of the burden of diseases in Iran 
following the 2004 and 2014 health sector reforms; however, the sanctions were 
associated with deaths of Iranians caused by NCDs.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is the most neglected chronic disease affecting 
over 750 million persons in the world. Currently, many patients with cancers or 
other chronic diseases (i.e., CKD) struggle to receive clinical treatment or 
examination due to hospitals cancelling or delaying in the COVID-19 pandemic, 
which may increase the risk of death. Cystatin C (Cys C) has been proposed as a 
potential glomerular filtration rate (GFR) marker for the early detection of 
acute kidney injury and CKD. However, most traditional methods for Cys C 
detection are immunoassays using serum as a sample and are tedious to perform 
and economically burdensome. To diagnose the disease in the early stage and 
carry out daily management during the current pandemic, we developed an 
integration of hydrogel microneedle patch (HMNP) and lateral flow cassette (LFC) 
to rapidly detect Cys C in skin interstitial fluid (ISF) in 25 min for 
blood-free CKD management anytime and anywhere by the naked eye that can reduce 
the impact of an individual's quality of life and life expectancy. Conceivably, 
this strategy presents a wide scope in the application of numerous other 
diseases if corresponding analytes are available in skin ISF.

INTRODUCTION: Immunotherapy revolutionized cancer care in the last decade and, 
notably among its tools, the programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) inhibitors. 
These drugs are related to increased life expectancy rates. However, they can 
cause several adverse events that have not been fully characterized, thus 
challenging clinical practice.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the toxicity profile, determining its frequency, 
causality, and severity associated with treatment with PD-1 inhibitors in 
patients treated at an oncology service in the private health sector in Belo 
Horizonte.
METHODS: Observational, retrospective, and cross-sectional study, based on the 
review of electronic medical records. The eligibility criteria included patients 
over 18 years old with a diagnosis of any cancer and staging, receiving a PD-1 
inhibitor from January 2017 to January 2020.
RESULTS: The sample consisted of 134 patients with lung cancer (46,3%), melanoma 
(34,3%), and kidney cancer (19,4%). The most common adverse event (AE) related 
to treatment were fatigue (51.5%), anorexia (23.1%), hypothyroidism (15.7%), and 
skin rash (14.9%), being grades 1 and 2 more prevalent. Between 3 and 12 months, 
there were more cutaneous, nutritional, and metabolic toxicities, and fatigue 
was present throughout the entire treatment period. Gastrointestinal and 
pulmonary toxicities were more frequent up to the 9th month.
CONCLUSION: Based on real-world evidence, it was possible to reveal important 
findings to support the safe practice of PD-1 inhibitors treatment. Fatigue was 
the most prevalent AE among patients. In addition, the kinetics of AE allowed 
the identification of major occurrences according to the period o treatment, 
allowing more precise monitoring and surveillance.

BACKGROUND: Obesity may have a protective effect (greater survival) in older 
adults, a finding known as the "obesity paradox." This study examined the 
association between self-reported body mass index (BMI) and active life 
expectancy (ALE) among older U.S. adults.
METHODS: Using the Medicare Health Outcomes Survey Cohort 15 (2012 baseline, 
2014 follow-up), we estimated life expectancy and ALE by participants' baseline 
BMI and age using multi-state models. A participant was classified as in an 
active state if this person reported having no difficulty for any of these six 
activities of daily living (ADLs).
RESULTS: Small differences in life expectancy were noted among persons in normal 
weight (BMI 18.5-24.9 kg/m2), overweight (BMI 25-29.9 kg/m2), and obesity ranges 
(BMI 30 kg/m2 and higher). However, persons with obesity had a significantly 
lower ALE. ALE at age 65 was 11.1 (11.0-11.2) years for persons with obesity, 
1.2 (1.1-1.3) years less than that for the normal weight and overweight persons 
(12.3 years for both, 12.2-12.4). Persons with class III obesity had a 
significantly lower life expectancy and ALE than normal weight persons. Although 
persons with class I or II obesity had a similar life expectancy as normal 
weight persons, they have a shorter ALE.
CONCLUSIONS: Although older adults with obesity have a similar life expectancy 
as normal weight persons, they have a significantly shorter ALE. Given the 
complex relationship of BMI and ALE, a "one size fits all" approach to weight 
management is not advisable.

BACKGROUND: Violence against women is the most widespread kind of human rights 
violation, and it has been linked to a wide range of consequences. The most 
prominent psychosocial and mental health concern that has serious effects for 
women's physical and mental well-being. This study assessed the prevalence and 
associated factors of women's violence by intimate partner among women in the 
reproductive age group (15-49).
METHODS: Multistage community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 
reproductive age group women in the central Gondar zone. We recruited 845 
participants and interviewed by health extension workers using face-to-face 
interviews. We used a Women's Abuse Screening test to outcome variable; it has a 
total score ranges 0-16, a score > 1 indicates positive for the presence of 
intimate partner violence within a year. Variables were coded and entered to Epi 
data version 3.1 and exported to SPSS version 21 for analysis. Descriptive 
statistics and multivariate logistic regression analysis was run for data 
analysis. Adjusted odds ratios (AOR) with a 95% confidence level (CI) were 
declared significant.
RESULT: Among a total of 845 participants 804 responded to the interviews with a 
response rate of 95%. The prevalence rate of intimate partner violence is 
391(48.6%). From multivariate logistic regression analysis women being married 
[AOR:3.85; 95% CI (2.38, 6.22)], high school and above educational status [(AOR: 
0.43; 95% CI (0.30, 0.61), women's having > 3children [(AOR: 1.82, 95% CI (1.0, 
3.1)], having a household food insecurity[(AOR: 2.09, 95% CI (1.51, 2.91)], 
having life threatening events [(AOR: 2.09; 95% CI (1.51, 2.91)], moderate 
social support [(AOR: 0.60; 95% CI (0.41, 0.83)], depression [(AOR: 3.12; 95% CI 
(1.60, 6.07) were significantly associated with violence by intimate partner at 
95% CI .
CONCLUSION: Intimate partner violence is common among reproductive-age women. 
Married, women with several children, food insecurity, life-threatening events, 
and depression were all found to be significant predictors of violence. Measures
