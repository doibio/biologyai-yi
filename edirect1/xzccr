Formation of cracks impairs the durability of concrete elements. Corrosion 
inducing substances, such as chlorides, can enter the matrix through these 
cracks and cause steel reinforcement corrosion and concrete degradation. 
Self-repair of concrete cracks is an innovative technique which has been studied 
extensively during the past decade and which may help to increase the 
sustainability of concrete. However, the experiments conducted until now did not 
allow for an assessment of the service life extension possible with self-healing 
concrete in comparison with traditional (cracked) concrete. In this research, a 
service life prediction of self-healing concrete was done based on input from 
chloride diffusion tests. Self-healing of cracks with encapsulated polyurethane 
precursor formed a partial barrier against immediate ingress of chlorides 
through the cracks. Application of self-healing concrete was able to reduce the 
chloride concentration in a cracked zone by 75% or more. As a result, service 
life of steel reinforced self-healing concrete slabs in marine environments 
could amount to 60-94 years as opposed to only seven years for ordinary 
(cracked) concrete. Subsequent life cycle assessment calculations indicated 
important environmental benefits (56%-75%) for the ten CML-IA (Center of 
Environmental Science of Leiden University-Impact Assessment) baseline impact 
indicators which are mainly induced by the achievable service life extension.

Orthopedic applications commonly require the administration of systemic 
antibiotics. Gentamicin is one of the most commonly used aminoglycosides in the 
treatment and prophylaxis of infections associated with orthopedic applications, 
but gentamicin has a short half-life. However, silica nanoparticles (SiO₂ NPs) 
can be used as elegant carriers for antibiotics to prolong their release. Our 
goal is the preparation and characterization of SiO₂-gentamicin nanohybrids for 
their potential antimicrobial administration in orthopedic applications. In 
vitro gentamicin release profile from the nanohybrids (gentamicin-conjugated 
SiO₂ NPs) prepared by the base-catalyzed precipitation exhibited fast release 
(21.4%) during the first 24 h and further extension with 43.9% release during 
the five-day experiment. Antimicrobial studies of the SiO₂-gentamicin 
nanohybrids versus native SiO₂ NPs and free gentamicin were performed against 
Bacillus subtilis (B. subtilis), Pseudomonas fluorescens (P. fluorescens) and 
Escherichia coli (E. coli). SiO₂-gentamicin nanohybrids were most effective 
against B. subtilis. SiO₂ NPs play no antimicrobial role. Parallel antimicrobial 
studies for the filter-sterilized gentamicin were performed to assess the effect 
of ultraviolet (UV)-irradiation on gentamicin. In summary, the initial fast 
gentamicin release fits the need for high concentration of antibiotics after 
orthopedic surgical interventions. Moreover, the extended release justifies the 
promising antimicrobial administration of the nanohybrids in bone applications.

Low decision-making power (DMP) has been associated with HIV seropositivity 
among women in sub-Saharan Africa. As treatment accessibility and life 
expectancy for HIV-positive individuals increase, greater attention to the 
mental health and well-being of HIV-positive women is needed. This study 
examined whether low DMP was associated with psychological distress, social 
support or health-related quality of life (HRQoL) among women initiating ART. 
The sample included 722 women aged 18 or older initiating ART during 2012-2013 
at six HIV clinics in Oromia, Ethiopia. DMP was assessed with five questions 
about household resource control and decision-making. Psychological distress was 
assessed with the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10). HRQoL was assessed 
with the overall subscale of the HIV/AIDS-Targeted Quality of Life instrument. 
Multivariable logistic regression analyses controlled for age, education, and 
location (urban/rural). Most respondents (63%) reported high DMP, followed by 
medium (27%) and low (10%) DMP. More than half (57%) reported psychological 
distress. Compared to medium DMP, low DMP among married or cohabitating women 
was associated with greater odds of low social support (aOR: 1.9 [1.3, 2.9]; 
high DMP among women not in a relationship was associated with greater odds of 
low social support (aOR: 4.4 [2.4, 8.1]) and psychological distress (aOR: 1.7 
[1.1, 2.6]). Interventions to reduce psychological distress among women 
initiating ART should consider the familial context, as high DMP among women not 
in a relationship was associated with psychological distress. High DMP may 
indicate weak social ties and fewer material resources, particularly among women 
not in a relationship.

BACKGROUND: Wasting is one of the indicators of malnutrition known to contribute 
to the deaths occurring from childhood malnutrition. It is the measure of body 
mass in relation to body length used to explain recent nutritional status.
AIM: This paper examines the determinants of wasting among under 5s in Ghana.
METHOD: Data were drawn from the 2014 Ghana Demographic and Health Survey 
children's records file to examine the determinants of wasting among children. A 
total of 2720 children under 5 years with valid anthropometric data were used. 
Data on wasting were collected by measuring the weight and height of all 
children under 5 years of age. Bi-variate and multi-variate statistics are used 
to examine the determinants of wasting.
RESULTS: The bi-variate analysis showed significant differences ( p < 0.001) in 
the prevalence of wasting among under 5s according to age of the child, region, 
and wealth status. On the other hand, the multi-variate analysis revealed that 
the odds of wasting were lower among children aged 24-35 months (Odds ratio (OR) 
= 0.37; p < 0.001), those from households of the middle wealth quintile (OR = 
0.49, p < 0.05) and with health insurance (OR = 0.70; p < 0.10).
CONCLUSIONS: Programmes and policies aimed at ensuring the survival of children 
during the first 24 months of life should be strengthened to reduce the risk of 
wasting among under 5s. Also, efforts should be made by the relevant government 
agencies and other stakeholders to strengthen the socio-economic status of 
mothers to enable them to provide adequate nutrition and improve access to 
health insurance for their children in order to reduce the incidence of wasting 
among these children.

BACKGROUND: Lack of Hepatitis C virus (HCV) incidence data in (Norwegian) 
high-risk groups impedes the ability to make informed decisions on prevention 
measures. Thus we rely on modelling to estimate the incidence and burden of HCV 
infections.
METHODS: We constructed a compartmental model for HCV infections in Norway among 
active and former people who inject drugs (PWIDs). We based yearly transition 
rates on literature. The model was fitted to absolute numbers of hepatitis C 
associated cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and death from national 
data sources (2000-2013). We estimated the number (95%CI) of HCV infections, 
cirrhosis, HCC and death and disability adjusted life years (DALYs) due to HCV 
infections in Norway, 1973-2030. We assumed treatment rates in the projected 
period were similar to those in 2013.
RESULTS: The estimated proportion of chronic HCV (including those with cirrhosis 
and HCC) among PWIDs was stable from 2000 (49%; 4441/9108) to 2013 (43%; 
3667/8587). We estimated that the incidence of HCV among PWIDs was 381 new 
infections in 2015. The estimated number of people with cirrhosis, HCC, and 
liver transplant was predicted to increase until 2022 (1537 people). DALYs among 
active PWIDs estimated to peak in 2006 (3480 DALYs) and decrease to 1870 DALYs 
in 2030. Chronic HCV infection contributes most to the total burden of HCV 
infection, and peaks at 1917 DALYs (52%) in 2007. The burden of HCV related to 
PWID increased until 2006 with 81/100,000 DALYs inhabitants and decreased to 
68/100,000 DALYs in 2015.
CONCLUSION: The burden of HCV associated with injecting drug use is 
considerable, with chronic HCV infection contributing most to the total burden. 
This model can be used to estimate the impact of different interventions on the 
HCV burden in Norway and to perform cost-benefit analyses of various public 
health measures.

BACKGROUND: The objective was to evaluate cost-utility of bariatric surgery in 
Germany for a lifetime and 10-year horizon from a health care payer perspective.
METHODS: State-transition Markov model provided absolute and incremental 
clinical and monetary results. In the model, obese patients could undergo 
surgery, develop post-surgery complications, experience diabetes type II, 
cardiovascular diseases or die. German Quality Assurance in Bariatric Surgery 
Registry and literature sources provided data on clinical effectiveness and 
safety. The model considered three types of surgeries: gastric bypass, sleeve 
gastrectomy, and adjustable gastric banding. The model was extensively 
validated, and deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were 
performed to evaluate uncertainty. Cost data were obtained from German sources 
and presented in 2012 euros (€).
RESULTS: Over 10 years, bariatric surgery led to the incremental cost of €2909, 
generated additional 0.03 years of life and 1.2 quality-adjusted life years 
(QALYs). Bariatric surgery was cost-effective at 10 years with an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio of €2457 per QALY. Over a lifetime, surgery led to 
savings of €8522 and generated an increment of 0.7 years of life or 3.2 QALYs. 
The analysis also depicted an association between surgery and a reduction of 
obesity-related adverse events (diabetes, cardiovascular disorders). Delaying 
surgery for up to 3 years, resulted in a reduction of life years and QALYs 
gained, in addition to a moderate reduction in associated healthcare costs.
CONCLUSIONS: Bariatric surgery is cost-effective at 10 years post-surgery and 
may result in a substantial reduction in the financial burden on the healthcare 
system over the lifetime of the treated individuals. It is also observed that 
delays in the provision of surgery may lead to a significant loss of clinical 
benefits.

BACKGROUND: Heart failure (HF) affects around 500,000 people in the UK. HF 
medications are frequently underprescribed and B-type natriuretic peptide 
(BNP)-guided therapy may help to optimise treatment.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of 
BNP-guided therapy compared with symptom-guided therapy in HF patients.
DESIGN: Systematic review, cohort study and cost-effectiveness model.
SETTING: A literature review and usual care in the NHS.
PARTICIPANTS: (a) HF patients in randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of 
BNP-guided therapy; and (b) patients having usual care for HF in the NHS.
INTERVENTIONS: Systematic review: BNP-guided therapy or symptom-guided therapy 
in primary or secondary care. Cohort study: BNP monitored (≥ 6 months' follow-up 
and three or more BNP tests and two or more tests per year), BNP tested (≥ 1 
tests but not BNP monitored) or never tested. Cost-effectiveness model: 
BNP-guided therapy in specialist clinics.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Mortality, hospital admission (all cause and HF related) 
and adverse events; and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) for the 
cost-effectiveness model.
DATA SOURCES: Systematic review: Individual participant or aggregate data from 
eligible RCTs. Cohort study: The Clinical Practice Research Datalink, Hospital 
Episode Statistics and National Heart Failure Audit (NHFA).
REVIEW METHODS: A systematic literature search (five databases, trial 
registries, grey literature and reference lists of publications) for published 
and unpublished RCTs.
RESULTS: Five RCTs contributed individual participant data (IPD) and eight RCTs 
contributed aggregate data (1536 participants were randomised to BNP-guided 
therapy and 1538 participants were randomised to symptom-guided therapy). For 
all-cause mortality, the hazard ratio (HR) for BNP-guided therapy was 0.87 [95% 
confidence interval (CI) 0.73 to 1.04]. Patients who were aged < 75 years or who 
had heart failure with a reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) received the most 
benefit [interactions (p = 0.03): < 75 years vs. ≥ 75 years: HR 0.70 (95% CI 
0.53 to 0.92) vs. 1.07 (95% CI 0.84 to 1.37); HFrEF vs. heart failure with a 
preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF): HR 0.83 (95% CI 0.68 to 1.01) vs. 1.33 (95% 
CI 0.83 to 2.11)]. In the cohort study, incident HF patients (1 April 2005-31 
March 2013) were never tested (n = 13,632), BNP tested (n = 3392) or BNP 
monitored (n = 71). Median survival was 5 years; all-cause mortality was 141.5 
out of 1000 person-years (95% CI 138.5 to 144.6 person-years). All-cause 
mortality and hospital admission rate were highest in the BNP-monitored group, 
and median survival among 130,433 NHFA patients (1 January 2007-1 March 2013) 
was 2.2 years. The admission rate was 1.1 patients per year (interquartile range 
0.5-3.5 patients). In the cost-effectiveness model, in patients aged < 75 years 
with HFrEF or HFpEF, BNP-guided therapy improves median survival (7.98 vs. 6.46 
years) with a small QALY gain (5.68 vs. 5.02) but higher lifetime costs (£64,777 
vs. £58,139). BNP-guided therapy is cost-effective at a threshold of £20,000 per 
QALY.
LIMITATIONS: The limitations of the trial were a lack of IPD for most RCTs and 
heterogeneous interventions; the inability to identify BNP monitoring 
confidently, to determine medication doses or to distinguish between HFrEF and 
HFpEF; the use of a simplified two-state Markov model; a focus on health service 
costs and a paucity of data on HFpEF patients aged < 75 years and HFrEF patients 
aged ≥ 75 years.
CONCLUSIONS: The efficacy of BNP-guided therapy in specialist HF clinics is 
uncertain. If efficacious, it would be cost-effective for patients aged < 75 
years with HFrEF. The evidence reviewed may not apply in the UK because care is 
delivered differently.
FUTURE WORK: Identify an optimal BNP-monitoring strategy and how to optimise HF 
management in accordance with guidelines; update the IPD meta-analysis to 
include the Guiding Evidence Based Therapy Using Biomarker Intensified Treatment 
(GUIDE-IT) RCT; collect routine long-term outcome data for completed and ongoing 
RCTs.

OBJECTIVES: Excessive consumption of added sugars in the human diet has been 
associated with obesity, type 2 diabetes (T2D), coronary heart disease (CHD) and 
other elements of the metabolic syndrome. Recent studies have shown that 
non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a critical pathway to metabolic 
syndrome. This model assesses the health and economic benefits of interventions 
aimed at reducing intake of added sugars.
METHODS: Using data from US National Health Surveys and current literature, we 
simulated an open cohort, for the period 2015-2035. We constructed a 
microsimulation model with Markov chains for NAFLD (including steatosis, 
non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma 
(HCC)), body mass index, T2D and CHD. We assessed reductions in population 
disease prevalence, disease-attributable disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) 
and costs, with interventions that reduce added sugars consumption by either 20% 
or 50%.
FINDINGS: The model estimated that a 20% reduction in added sugars intake will 
reduce prevalence of hepatic steatosis, NASH, cirrhosis, HCC, obesity, T2D and 
CHD. Incidence of T2D and CHD would be expected to decrease by 19.9 (95% CI 12.8 
to 27.0) and 9.4 (95% CI 3.1 to 15.8) cases per 100 000 people after 20 years, 
respectively. A 20% reduction in consumption is also projected to annually avert 
0.767 million (M) DALYs (95% CI 0.757M to 0.777M) and a total of US$10.3 billion 
(B) (95% CI 10.2B to 10.4B) in discounted direct medical costs by 2035. These 
effects increased proportionally when added sugars intake were reduced by 50%.
CONCLUSIONS: The decrease in incidence and prevalence of disease is similar to 
results in other models, but averted costs and DALYs were higher, mainly due to 
inclusion of NAFLD and CHD. The model suggests that efforts to reduce 
consumption of added sugars may result in significant public health and economic 
benefits.

PURPOSE: Oncologists are making treatment decisions on increasing numbers of 
older patients with cancer. Due to comorbidities and frailty that increase with 
age, such decisions are often complex. We determined factors influencing 
oncologists' decisions to prescribe chemotherapy for older adults.
METHODS: Members of the Medical Oncology Group of Australia (MOGA) were invited 
to complete an online survey in February to April 2016.
RESULTS: Ninety-three oncologists completed the survey of which 69 (74%) were 
consultants and 24 (26%) were trainees, with most (72, 77%) working 
predominantly in a public hospital-associated practice. The three highest ranked 
factors influencing decisions about (a) adjuvant chemotherapy were performance 
status, survival benefit of treatment, and life expectancy in the absence of 
cancer and about (b) palliative chemotherapy were performance status, patient 
preference, and quality of life. Most geriatric health domains are reportedly 
assessed routinely by the majority of respondents, though few routinely use 
geriatric screening tools (14%) or geriatric assessments (5%). In hypothetical 
patient scenarios, oncologists were less likely to prescribe palliative and 
adjuvant chemotherapy as age and rates of severe toxicity increased.
CONCLUSION: Performance status was the most influential factor for oncologists 
when making a decision about chemotherapy for their older patients, and the 
importance of other factors differed according to treatment intent. Oncologists 
were less likely to recommend chemotherapy as patient age and treatment toxicity 
increased. The low uptake of geriatric assessments or screening tools provides 
scope for improved clinical assessment of older adults in treatment 
decision-making.

Risk of Developing Dementia at Older Ages in the United States.

Fishman E(1).

Dementia is increasingly recognized as a major source of disease burden in the 
United States, yet little research has evaluated the lifecycle implications of 
dementia. To address this research gap, this article uses the Aging, 
Demographics, and Memory Study (ADAMS) to provide the first nationally 
representative, longitudinal estimates of the probability that a dementia-free 
person will develop dementia later in life. For the 1920 birth cohort, the 
average dementia-free 70-year-old male had an estimated 26.9 % (SE = 3.2 %) 
probability of developing dementia, and the average dementia-free 70-year-old 
female had an estimated 34.7 % (SE = 3.7 %) probability. These estimates of risk 
of dementia are higher for younger, lower-mortality cohorts and are 
substantially higher than those found in local epidemiological studies in the 
United States, suggesting a widespread need to prepare for a life stage with 
dementia.

OBJECTIVES: The Eastern Mediterranean Region faces several health challenges at 
a difficult time with wars, unrest, and economic change.
METHODS: We used the Global Burden of Disease 2015 study to present the burden 
of diseases, injuries, and risk factors in the Eastern Mediterranean Region from 
1990 to 2015.
RESULTS: Ischemic heart disease was the leading cause of death in the region in 
2015, followed by cerebrovascular disease. Changes in total deaths ranged from a 
reduction of 25% for diarrheal diseases to an increase of about 42% for diabetes 
and tracheal, bronchus, and lung cancer. Collective violence and legal 
intervention increased by 850% during the time period. Diet was the leading risk 
factor for disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) for men compared to maternal 
malnutrition for females. Childhood undernutrition was the leading risk factor 
for DALYs in 1990 and 2005, but the second in 2015 after high blood pressure.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that the region is facing several health challenges 
and calls for global efforts to stabilise the region and to address the current 
and future burden of disease.

OBJECTIVES: Diarrheal diseases (DD) are an important cause of disease burden, 
especially in children in low-income settings. DD can also impact children's 
potential livelihood through growth faltering, cognitive impairment, and other 
sequelae.
METHODS: As part of the Global Burden of Disease study, we estimated DD burden, 
and the burden attributable to specific risk factors and etiologies, in the 
Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR) between 1990 and 2015. We calculated 
disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs)-the sum of years of life lost and years 
lived with disability-for both sexes and all ages.
RESULTS: We estimate that over 103,692 diarrhea deaths occurred in the EMR in 
2015 (95% uncertainty interval: 87,018-124,692), and the mortality rate was 16.0 
deaths per 100,000 persons (95% UI: 13.4-19.2). The majority of these deaths 
occurred in children under 5 (63.3%) (65,670 deaths, 95% UI: 53,640-79,486). 
DALYs per 100,000 ranged from 304 (95% UI 228-400) in Kuwait to 38,900 (95% UI 
25,900-54,300) in Somalia.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings will guide evidence-based health policy decisions for 
interventions to achieve the ultimate goal of reducing the DD burden.

OBJECTIVES: We used findings from the Global Burden of Disease 2015 study to 
update our previous publication on the burden of diabetes and chronic kidney 
disease due to diabetes (CKD-DM) during 1990-2015.
METHODS: We extracted GBD 2015 estimates for prevalence, mortality, and 
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) of diabetes (including burden of low 
vision due to diabetes, neuropathy, and amputations and CKD-DM for 22 countries 
of the EMR from the GBD visualization tools.
RESULTS: In 2015, 135,230 (95% UI 123,034-148,184) individuals died from 
diabetes and 16,470 (95% UI 13,977-18,961) from CKD-DM, 216 and 179% increases, 
respectively, compared to 1990. The total number of people with diabetes was 
42.3 million (95% UI 38.6-46.4 million) in 2015. DALY rates of diabetes in 2015 
were significantly higher than the expected rates based on Socio-demographic 
Index (SDI).
CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed a large and increasing burden of diabetes in the 
region. There is an urgency in dealing with diabetes and its consequences, and 
these efforts should be at the forefront of health prevention and promotion.

OBJECTIVES: We used the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2015 study results to 
explore the burden of high body mass index (BMI) in the Eastern Mediterranean 
Region (EMR).
METHODS: We estimated the prevalence of overweight and obesity among children 
(2-19 years) and adults (≥20 years) in 1980 and 2015. The burden of disease 
related to high BMI was calculated using the GBD comparative risk assessment 
approach.
RESULTS: The prevalence of obesity increased for adults from 15.1% (95% UI 
13.4-16.9) in 1980 to 20.7% (95% UI 18.8-22.8) in 2015. It increased from 4.1% 
(95% UI 2.9-5.5) to 4.9% (95% UI 3.6-6.4) for the same period among children. In 
2015, there were 417,115 deaths and 14,448,548 disability-adjusted life years 
(DALYs) attributable to high BMI in EMR, which constitute about 10 and 6.3% of 
total deaths and DALYs, respectively, for all ages.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to estimate trends in obesity burden for 
the EMR from 1980 to 2015. We call for EMR countries to invest more resources in 
prevention and health promotion efforts to reduce this burden.

OBJECTIVES: To report the burden of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) in the Eastern 
Mediterranean Region (EMR) during 1990-2015.
METHODS: We used the 2015 Global Burden of Disease study for estimates of 
mortality and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) of different CVD in 22 
countries of EMR.
RESULTS: A total of 1.4 million CVD deaths (95% UI: 1.3-1.5) occurred in 2015 in 
the EMR, with the highest number of deaths in Pakistan (465,116) and the lowest 
number of deaths in Qatar (723). The age-standardized DALY rate per 100,000 
decreased from 10,080 in 1990 to 8606 in 2015 (14.6% decrease). Afghanistan had 
the highest age-standardized DALY rate of CVD in both 1990 and 2015. Kuwait and 
Qatar had the lowest age-standardized DALY rates of CVD in 1990 and 2015, 
respectively. High blood pressure, high total cholesterol, and high body mass 
index were the leading risk factors for CVD.
CONCLUSIONS: The age-standardized DALY rates in the EMR are considerably higher 
than the global average. These findings call for a comprehensive approach to 
prevent and control the burden of CVD in the region.

OBJECTIVES: We used data from the Global Burden of Disease 2015 study (GBD) to 
calculate the burden of lower respiratory infections (LRIs) in the 22 countries 
of the Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR) from 1990 to 2015.
METHODS: We conducted a systematic analysis of mortality and morbidity data for 
LRI and its specific etiologic factors, including pneumococcus, Haemophilus 
influenzae type b, Respiratory syncytial virus, and influenza virus. We used 
modeling methods to estimate incidence, deaths, and disability-adjusted 
life-years (DALYs). We calculated burden attributable to known risk factors for 
LRI.
RESULTS: In 2015, LRIs were the fourth-leading cause of DALYs, causing 
11,098,243 (95% UI 9,857,095-12,396,566) DALYs and 191,114 (95% UI 
170,934-210,705) deaths. The LRI DALY rates were higher than global estimates in 
2015. The highest and lowest age-standardized rates of DALYs were observed in 
Somalia and Lebanon, respectively. Undernutrition in childhood and ambient 
particulate matter air pollution in the elderly were the main risk factors.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings call for public health strategies to reduce the level 
of risk factors in each age group, especially vulnerable child and elderly 
populations.

OBJECTIVES: Mental disorders are among the leading causes of nonfatal burden of 
disease globally.
METHODS: We used the global burden of diseases, injuries, and risk factors study 
2015 to examine the burden of mental disorders in the Eastern Mediterranean 
region (EMR). We defined mental disorders according to criteria proposed in the 
diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders IV and the 10th 
International Classification of Diseases.
RESULTS: Mental disorders contributed to 4.7% (95% uncertainty interval (UI) 
3.7-5.6%) of total disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), ranking as the ninth 
leading cause of disease burden. Depressive disorders and anxiety disorders were 
the third and ninth leading causes of nonfatal burden, respectively. Almost all 
countries in the EMR had higher age-standardized mental disorder DALYs rates 
compared to the global level, and in half of the EMR countries, observed mental 
disorder rates exceeded the expected values.
CONCLUSIONS: The burden of mental disorders in the EMR is higher than global 
levels, particularly for women. To properly address this burden, EMR governments 
should implement nationwide quality epidemiological surveillance of mental 
disorders and provide adequate prevention and treatment services.
