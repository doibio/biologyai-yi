daily living subscales. The mean active flexion between the preoperative and 
both postoperative timepoints at 6 months and 1 year was also statistically 
significant (P = .021 and P = .001).
CONCLUSIONS: MS-TKA with a CR insert can facilitate symptom relief and improve 
overall function of the knee after surgery. Both the patient and clinical 
outcomes were comparable to 1-year outcomes utilizing other MS-TKA designs and 
were superior to those at 1-year follow-up following implantation of CR-TKA. 
Most notability, the KOOS symptoms and sports score were higher for the MS-TKA 
with a CR insert than for an MS-TKA design.

Hydrogen (H) atoms are abundant in macromolecules and often play critical roles 
in enzyme catalysis, ligand-recognition processes and protein-protein 
interactions. However, their direct visualization by diffraction techniques is 
challenging. Macromolecular X-ray crystallography affords the localization of 
only the most ordered H atoms at (sub-)atomic resolution (around 1.2 Å or 
higher). However, many H atoms of biochemical significance remain undetectable 
by this method. In contrast, neutron diffraction methods enable the 
visualization of most H atoms, typically in the form of deuterium (2H) atoms, at 
much more common resolution values (better than 2.5 Å). Thus, neutron 
crystallography, although technically demanding, is often the method of choice 
when direct information on protonation states is sought. REFMAC5 from the 
Collaborative Computational Project No. 4 (CCP4) is a program for the refinement 
of macromolecular models against X-ray crystallographic and cryo-EM data. This 
contribution describes its extension to include the refinement of structural 
models obtained from neutron crystallographic data. Stereochemical restraints 
with accurate bond distances between H atoms and their parent atom nuclei are 
now part of the CCP4 Monomer Library, the source of prior chemical information 
used in the refinement. One new feature for neutron data analysis in REFMAC5 is 
refinement of the protium/deuterium (1H/2H) fraction. This parameter describes 
the relative 1H/2H contribution to neutron scattering for hydrogen isotopes. The 
newly developed REFMAC5 algorithms were tested by performing the (re-)refinement 
of several entries available in the PDB and of one novel structure (FutA) using 
either (i) neutron data only or (ii) neutron data supplemented by external 
restraints to a reference X-ray crystallographic structure. Re-refinement with 
REFMAC5 afforded models characterized by R-factor values that are consistent 
with, and in some cases better than, the originally deposited values. The use of 
external reference structure restraints during refinement has been observed to 
be a valuable strategy, especially for structures at medium-low resolution.

OBJECTIVES: The study seeks to identify the impact of smoking, sports 
participation, and alcohol consumption on life expectancy of men and women in 
Russian regions.
STUDY DESIGN: We use official data for 2014-2020 for 77 Russian regions. We 
estimate factors related to life expectancy separately for men and women to 
account for differences in their life expectancy and lifestyles.
METHODS: We run fixed-effect models to estimate regional life expectancy 
depending on smoking, alcohol consumption, sport participation, healthcare 
characteristics, and demographical and economic factors.
RESULTS: Life expectancy was negatively associated with alcohol consumption and 
smoking and positively with sport participation: a 1-L increase in alcohol 
consumption was attributed to a 1.6-month decrease in male life expectancy and 
to a 1.8-month decrease in female life expectancy. If the proportion of smoking 
women was halved, the increase in woman's life expectancy would be 4.6 months. 
If sports participation rates were doubled for men and women, the expected 
increase in their life expectancy would be 1 and 0.9 years, respectively. Other 
factors attributed to life expectancy were settlement type, income inequality, 
characteristics of regional healthcare systems, and the COVID-19 pandemic.
CONCLUSION: We find significant variation in life expectancy across Russian 
regions that can be partly explained by unhealthy lifestyles. We suggest that 
policies aimed at improving national health in diverse countries such as Russia 
adjust healthy lifestyle measures to the needs of particular region.

AIM: The place of death is one of the indicators of the quality of end-of-life 
care, which has become an essential public health issue with the aging of the 
population and the increase in life expectancy. There is a lack of data 
regarding the location of deaths caused by chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
(COPD), the third-leading cause of mortality worldwide. This retrospective, 
cross-sectional study aimed to investigate the places of death of patients with 
COPD in Turkey and their trends over the years.
METHODS: The study included patients who had a COPD International Classification 
of Diseases code in the hospital information system and were provided a 
medication report for this disease in a university hospital's chest diseases 
outpatient clinic between January 1, 2014, and December 31, 2021. The place and 
date of death were obtained from the death notification system and recorded as 
an in-hospital or out-of-hospital death.
RESULTS: A total of 1402 (77.3%) patients died in the hospital and 412 (22.7%) 
died outside the hospital, and when comparing the pandemic period and before, no 
significant difference was observed between the places of death. Sixty-three 
(49.6%) of 127 patients over the age of 90 years died outside the hospital, and 
a significant relationship was observed between advanced age and out-of-hospital 
mortality (P < 0.005).
CONCLUSION: According to our findings, a substantial number of patients with 
COPD in Turkey die in hospitals. The insufficiency of nursing homes and lack of 
hospice care cause more hospital deaths. Our data are expected to guide the 
development of end-of-life care policies for patients with COPD in our country.

BACKGROUND: There is little knowledge on the dose-response association between 
cardiovascular health (CVH) and risk of all-cause, cardiovascular disease (CVD) 
and cancer deaths among cancer survivors.
AIMS: We aimed to examine the dose-response association of CVH with all-cause, 
CVD, and cancer mortality.
METHODS: A total of 1701 US adult cancer survivors were followed-up during a 
median of 7.3 (IQR 4.0-10.2) years from 2007 to 2018 through the National Health 
and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). We used the American Heart 
Association´s (AHA) Life´s Essential 8 (LE8) as a proxy for CVH.
RESULTS: Restricted cubic spline models indicated a close to inverse linear 
shape for the dose-response association between LE8 score and all-cause 
mortality with significant risk reductions within the range between 61.25 
(Hazard ratio [HR]: 0.76, 95% CI, 0.59-0.98) and 100 points (HR: 0.28, 95%CI, 
0.12-0.62), and a curvilinear shape for the dose-response association between 
LE8 score and CVD deaths with significant risk reductions within the range 
between 50.25 (HR: 0.72, 95% CI, 0.52-0.99) and 90.25 points (HR: 0.15, 95%CI, 
0.02-0.98). No significant dose-response association was observed between LE8 
and cancer deaths.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed a close to inverse relationship between higher LE8 
and risk of death from all cause, an inverse curvilinear relationship between 
higher LE8 and the risk for CVD death, and a non-significant association between 
higher LE8 and the risk of cancer death among US adult cancer survivors, which 
may translate to a substantial number of annual averted deaths and thus 
important public health implications.

BACKGROUND: Timely access to healthcare is essential but measuring access is 
challenging. Prior research focused on analyzing potential travel times to 
healthcare under optimal mobility scenarios that do not incorporate direct 
observations of human mobility, potentially underestimating the barriers to 
receiving care for many populations.
METHODS: We introduce an approach for measuring accessibility by utilizing 
travel times to healthcare facilities from aggregated and anonymized smartphone 
Location History data. We measure these revealed travel times to healthcare 
facilities in over 100 countries and juxtapose our findings with potential 
(optimal) travel times estimated using Google Maps directions. We then quantify 
changes in revealed accessibility associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.
RESULTS: We find that revealed travel time differs substantially from potential 
travel time; in all but 4 countries this difference exceeds 30 minutes, and in 
49 countries it exceeds 60 minutes. Substantial variation in revealed healthcare 
accessibility is observed and correlates with life expectancy (⍴=-0.70) and 
infant mortality (⍴=0.59), with this association remaining significant after 
adjusting for potential accessibility and wealth. The COVID-19 pandemic altered 
the patterns of healthcare access, especially for populations dependent on 
public transportation.
CONCLUSIONS: Our metrics based on empirical data indicate that revealed travel 
times exceed potential travel times in many regions. During COVID-19, 
inequitable accessibility was exacerbated. In conjunction with other relevant 
data, these findings provide a resource to help public health policymakers 
identify underserved populations and promote health equity by formulating 
policies and directing resources towards areas and populations most in need.

Plain Language Summary: Spatial access to healthcare facilities (i.e., how long 
people need to travel to reach care) is important for understanding public 
health, but hard to measure. Most research so far has focused on theoretical 
(potential) travel times. Using anonymized smartphone location history data, we 
measure actual (revealed) travel times to healthcare facilities in over 100 
countries. We find that revealed travel times exceed theoretical travel times in 
many regions of the world, meaning that in reality people travel longer to get 
healthcare. Our data also show that inequities in travel time became worse 
during the COVID-19 pandemic. When combined with other data, these results can 
help policymakers identify areas and populations at need, and direct resources 
to improve public health.

BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: The United Arab Emirates (UAE) is a rapidly developing 
country. With the increase in average life-expectancy, high rates of 
consanguinity, and the adoption of a Western lifestyle, the burden of 
neurological disorders is expected to increase over the next few decades. 
Despite the importance of neurological disorders, there has not been a 
systematic review of published studies on the epidemiology of neurological 
disorders in the UAE.
METHODS: We searched for studies of incidence and/or prevalence of neurological 
disorders in the UAE published in English in MEDLINE, Google Scholar, Embase, 
and Scopus databases with no date restrictions up until 01 October 2023. Two 
authors independently assessed abstracts and full texts of possibly relevant 
papers, followed by data extraction from studies satisfying the eligibility 
criteria.
RESULTS: Eight articles (N = 2067 patients) were included, half reported 
incidence and prevalence of multiple sclerosis, with an average crude prevalence 
56/100,000 and related demyelinating disorders. Others were related to headache, 
meningitis, cerebral venous thrombosis, and brain tumours.
CONCLUSION: There is a distinct lack of data on the epidemiology of different 
neurological diseases in the UAE. Large population-based studies, ideally 
longitudinal, are required to provide accurate and reliable estimates of the 
incidence and prevalence of neurological disorders to help inform healthcare 
capacity planning.

BACKGROUND: Population health is vital to a nation's overall well-being and 
development. To achieve sustainable human development, a reduction in health 
inequalities and an increase in interstate convergence in health indicators is 
necessary. Evaluation of the convergence patterns can aid the government in 
monitoring the health progress across the Indian states. This study investigates 
the progressive changes in the convergence and divergence patterns in health 
status across major states of India from 1990 to 2018.
METHODS: Sigma plots (σ), kernel density plots, and log t-test methods are used 
to test the convergence, divergence, and club convergence patterns in the health 
indicators at the state level.
RESULTS: The result of the sigma convergence suggests that life expectancy at 
birth has converged across all states. After 2006, however, the infant mortality 
rate, neonatal mortality rate, and total fertility rate experienced a divergence 
pattern. The study's findings indicate that life expectancy at birth converges 
in the same direction across all states, falling into the same club (Club One). 
However, considerable cross-state variations and evidence of clubs' convergence 
and divergence are observed in the domains of infant mortality rate, neonatal 
death rate, and total fertility rate. As suggested by the kernel density 
estimates, life expectancy at birth stratifies, polarizes, and becomes unimodal 
over time, although with a single stable state. A bimodal distribution was found 
for infant, neonatal, and total fertility rates.
CONCLUSIONS: Therefore, healthcare strategies must consider each club's 
transition path while focusing on divergence states to reduce health variations 
and improve health outcomes for each group of individuals.

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to explore the public view on priority-setting 
criteria for healthcare resource allocation. Specifically, it investigates how 
the value of a quality-adjusted life year (QALY) varies depending on patient 
characteristics.
METHODS: A discrete choice experiment was conducted using an online sample of 
the general South Korean population. Respondents were presented with two 
competing treatment scenarios. The attributes of the scenarios were age at 
disease onset, life expectancy without treatment, life-years gain with 
treatment, health-related quality of life (HRQoL) without treatment, and HRQoL 
gains with treatment. Two hundred choice sets were generated and randomly 
allocated into 20 blocks. A conditional logit model was used to estimate the 
factors affecting the respondents' choices.
RESULTS: A total of 3,482 respondents completed the survey. The larger the QALY 
gain, the more likely it was that the scenario would be chosen but with a 
diminishing marginal value. Respondents prioritized 40-year-old patients over 
5-year-olds and 5-year-olds over 70-year-olds and prioritized baseline HRQoL of 
40% and 60% over 20%. Patients at the end of life were not preferred to those 
with a longer life expectancy.
CONCLUSION: Overall, respondents preferred health-maximizing options without 
explicit consideration for end-of-life patients or those with poor health. In 
addition, they revealed a kinked preference for patient age, prioritizing 
middle-aged patients over children and older people.

Exposure to heavy metals in contaminated drinking water is strongly correlated 
with various cancers, highlighting the burden of disease. This study aimed to 
assess the non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic risks associated with exposure to 
heavy metals (As, Pb, Cd, and Cr) in drinking water of Fars province and 
evaluate the attributed burden of disease. Non-carcinogenic risk assessment was 
performed using the hazard quotient (HQ) method, while the carcinogenic risk 
assessment utilized the excess lifetime cancer risk approach. The burden of 
disease was evaluated in terms of years of life lost, years lived with 
disability, and disability-adjusted life years (DALY) for three specific 
cancers: skin, lung, and kidney cancer. The average drinking water 
concentrations of arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr) and lead (Pb) were 
determined to be 0.72, 0.4, 1.10 and 0.72 μg/L, respectively. The total average 
HQ of heavy metals in drinking water in the study area were 0.127, 0.0047, 
0.0009 and 0.0069, respectively. The average ILCRs of heavy metal in the entire 
country were in the following order: 1.15 × 10-5 for As, 2.22 × 10-7 for Cd and 
3.41 × 10-7 for Cr. The results also indicated that among the various counties 
analyzed, Fasa experiences the greatest burden of disease in terms of DALYs, 
with a value of 87.56, specifically attributed to cancers caused by exposure to 
arsenic. Generally, it can be said that the burden of disease is a critical 
aspect of public health that requires comprehensive understanding and effective 
intervention.

Chronic wounds are a worldwide problem that affect >40 million people every 
year. The constant inflammatory status accompanied by prolonged bacterial 
infections reduce patient's quality of life and life expectancy drastically. An 
important cell type involved in the wound healing process are mesenchymal 
stromal cells (MSCs) due to their long-term demonstrated immunomodulatory and 
pro-regenerative capacity. Thus, in this work, we leveraged and compared the 
therapeutic properties of MSCs derived from both adipose tissue and hair 
follicle, which we combined with sponge-like scaffolds (SLS) made of valorized 
soy protein and β-chitin. In this regard, the combination of these cells with 
biomaterials permitted us to obtain a multifunctional therapy that allowed high 
cell retention and growing rates while maintaining adequate cell-viability for 
several days. Furthermore, this combined therapy demonstrated to increase 
fibroblasts and keratinocytes migration, promote human umbilical vein 
endothelial cells angiogenesis and protect fibroblasts from highly proteolytic 
environments. Finally, this combined therapy demonstrated to be highly effective 
in reducing wound healing time in vivo with only one treatment change during all 
the experimental procedure, also promoting a more functional and native-like 
healed skin.

OBJECTIVES: We used publicly available population data from 1 January 2019 up to 
31 December 2022, to investigate mortality trends in Italy during the COVID-19 
pandemic, evaluating changes in life expectancy (LE) at birth within provinces 
and the impact of COVID-19 vaccinations.
STUDY DESIGN: Aggregate data analysis.
METHODS: Annual period life tables were used to estimate sex-specific LEs within 
provinces from 2019 to 2022. We used Arriaga decomposition to analyze the 
contribution of age groups (<60 years and ≥60 years) to annual LE changes. We 
implemented a Quasi-Poisson regression model to estimate the number of averted 
deaths by the achieved COVID-19 vaccination rates from January 2021 up to 
December 2022, simulating a counterfactual scenario where vaccine doses were not 
administered.
RESULTS: The results revealed geographical heterogeneity in annual LE changes 
across Italian provinces during the pandemic. By the end of 2022, LE was below 
the prepandemic levels in 88% of provinces for females and in 76% for males. In 
addition, we estimated that the achieved vaccination rates averted 460,831 
deaths (95% confidence interval: 250,976-707,920), corresponding to a 25% 
reduction in expected all-cause mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the study highlighted the significant role of COVID-19 
vaccinations in averting a considerable number of deaths and improving LE. 
However, by the end of 2022, LE had not fully recovered to prepandemic levels in 
many provinces. This could be attributed to concurrent factors, including 
enduring COVID-19 pandemic effects, intense summer heat waves and early onset of 
seasonal flu. Further research and continuous monitoring are essential to fully 
comprehend long-term mortality trends and optimize public health strategies.

Controlled environment agriculture (CEA) is a rapidly growing sector that 
presents unique challenges and opportunities in ensuring food safety. This 
manuscript highlights critical gaps and needs to promote food safety in CEA 
systems as identified by stakeholders (n=47) at the Strategizing to Advance 
Future Extension andResearch (S.A.F.E.R.) CEA conference held in April 2023 at 
The Ohio State University's Ohio CEA Research Center. Feedback collected at the 
conference was analyzed using an emergent thematic analysis approach to 
determine key areas of focus. Research-based guidance is specific to the type of 
commodity, production system type, and size. Themes include the need for 
improved supply chain control, cleaning, and sanitization practices, pathogen 
preventive controls and mitigation methods and training and education. 
Discussions surrounding supply chain control underscored the significance of the 
need for approaches to mitigate foodborne pathogen contamination. Effective 
cleaning and sanitization practices are vital to maintaining a safe production 
environment, with considerations such as establishing standard operating 
procedures, accounting for hygienic equipment design, and managing the microbial 
communities within the system. Data analysis further highlights the need for 
risk assessments, validated pathogen detection methods, and evidence-based 
guidance in microbial reduction. In addition, training and education were 
identified as crucial in promoting a culture of food safety within CEA. The 
development of partnerships between industry, regulatory, and research 
institutions are needed to advance data-driven guidance and practices across the 
diverse range of CEA operations and deemed essential for addressing challenges 
and advancing food safety practices in CEA. Considering these factors, the CEA 
industry can enhance food safety practices, foster consumer trust, and support 
its long-term sustainability.

Motor imagery (MI) is used for rehabilitation and sports training. Previous 
studies focusing on the upper limb have investigated the effects of MI on 
corticospinal excitability in the muscles involved in the imagined movement 
(i.e., the agonist muscles). The present study focused on several lower-limb 
movements and investigated the influences of MI on corticospinal excitability in 
the lower limb muscles. Twelve healthy individuals (ten male and two female 
individuals) participated in this study. Motor-evoked potentials (MEP) from the 
rectus femoris (RF), biceps femoris (BF), tibialis anterior (TA), and soleus 
(SOL) muscles were elicited through transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to 
the primary motor cortex during MI of knee extension, knee flexion, ankle 
dorsiflexion, and ankle plantarflexion and at rest. The results showed that the 
RF MEPs were significantly increased during MI in knee extension, ankle 
dorsiflexion, and ankle plantarflexion but not in knee flexion, compared with 
those at rest. The TA MEPs were significantly increased during MI in knee 
extension and foot dorsiflexion, while MEPs were not significantly different 
during MI in knee flexion and foot dorsiflexion than those at rest. For the BF 
and SOL muscles, there was no significant MEP modulation in either MI. These 
results demonstrated that corticospinal excitability of the RF and TA muscles 
was facilitated during MI of movements in which they are active and during MI of 
lower-limb movements in which they are not involved. On the contrary, 
corticospinal excitability of the BF and SOL muscles was not facilitated by MI 
of lower-limb movements. These results suggest that facilitation of 
corticospinal excitability depends on the muscle and the type of lower-limb MI.

Death and end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) are major outcomes of glomerular 
disease. (GD) The years of potential life lost (YLL) may provide additional 
insight into the disease burden beyond death rates. There is limited data on 
premature mortality in GD. In this retrospective observational cohort study, we 
evaluated the mortality, ESKD rates, and YLL in Thais with biopsy-proven GD. The 
mortality and combined outcome rates were determined by log-rank test and ESKD 
by using a competing risk model. YLL and premature life lost before age 60 were 
calculated for different GD based on the life expectancy of the Thai population. 
Patients with GD (n = 949) were followed for 5237 patient years. The death rate 
and ESKD rates (95%CI) were 4.2 (3.7-4.9) and 3.3 (2.9-3.9) per 100 
patient-years, respectively. Paraprotein-related kidney disease had the highest 
death rate, and diabetic nephropathy had the highest ESKD rate. Despite not 
having the highest death rate, lupus nephritis (LN) had the highest YLL (41% of 
all GD) and premature loss of life before age 60. In conclusion, YLL provided a 
different disease burden assessment compared to mortality rates and identified 
LN as the major cause of premature death due to GD in a Southeast Asian cohort.

BACKGROUND: The increase in life expectancy has contributed to an increase in 
the number of older people, but this population has to learn to live with at 
least one chronic illness. Thus, hope has become an important resource for the 
older adult to face the repercussions of chronic illness.
OBJECTIVE: To synthesise qualitative evidence on the experience of hope in older 
people with chronic illness.
METHODS: This meta-synthesis included qualitative studies which present the 
experiences of hope in older people diagnosed with at least one chronic illness. 
The searches were made from six databases, guided by the SPIDER tool. The 
identified articles were then independently screened by two reviewers. The 
results were analysed according to the thematic synthesis approach.
RESULTS: Eighteen articles were included, and four analytical themes were 
constructed. The results allow us to understand that older people live with 
long-term conditions and hope for an ordinary life. To react to new changes and 
to maintain hope, they create goals that motivate them in daily life. The 
treatment is initially seen as a salvation, but the information acquired with 
the evolution of the illness modifies this perception. In addition, the 
uncertainty about the success of the treatment creates conflict in their hope. 
In the support and care of older people in the new context of illness, 
meaningful relationships strengthen hope most of the time. There is still the 
hope of being reconciled with death, but there are times when suffering 
overcomes the hope of living.
CONCLUSIONS: This meta-synthesis highlights that the experience of hope in older 
people is dynamic and influenced by the context of changes related to illness, 
treatment, significant relationships and proximity to death.
IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: A better understanding of the role and 
characteristics of hope in older people with chronic illness may help to develop 
more effective interventions to promote and maintain hope.

OBJECTIVE: Early detection through mammographic screening and various treatment 
modalities of cancer may have changed life expectancy and cause-specific 
mortality of breast cancer patients. We aimed to determine the long-term cause 
of death patterns in screening-detected patients and clinically diagnosed 
patients in the Netherlands compared with the general population.
METHODS: Using data from the Netherlands Cancer Registry and Statistics 
Netherlands of around 26,000 women, aged 50-75 at diagnosis and surgically 
treated for invasive breast cancer in 2004-2008, we compared patients with 
screening-detected and clinically diagnosed cancer for major causes of death 
until 2020. The expected number of all-cause and cause-specific deaths was 
calculated using rates of the general population.
RESULTS: During the follow-up period, 4310 women died. The age-standardised 
all-cause mortality ratio for the screening-detected cancer group was 1.41 (95% 
confidence interval (95% CI), 1.37-1.46). A higher mortality ratio was observed 
for patients with clinically detected cancer: 2.27 (95% CI, 2.19-2.34). The 
observed versus expected breast cancer mortality ratio in the screening-detected 
patient group was 8.92 (95% CI, 8.45-9.40) and 20.23 (19.38-21.09) in the 
clinical group. Excess mortality was found for lung cancer in both patient 
groups, and small elevations for circulatory and respiratory disease in the 
clinically detected group.
CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that for the screening group no other causes of 
death but breast and lung cancer were prominent compared with the general 
population. The clinical group showed excess mortality for some other causes of 
death as well, suggesting a less healthy group compared with the general 
population.

Complete transverse transection of the normal-sized non-pregnant uterus 
associated with wearing a safety belt in abdominal blunt trauma: Narrative 
review and case study.

Mai, Thailand.

This review and case study illustrates a patient with a complete transverse 
transection of a non-pregnant uterus caused by blunt trauma associated with 
wearing a safety belt. The 31-year-old patient, who had a previous cesarean 
section, presented with impending hypovolemic shock caused by intra-abdominal 
hemorrhage secondary to blunt trauma while wearing a safety belt. On physical 
examination, a transverse straight line of ecchymosis along the line of a 
fastened safety belt was noted without any other external injury. The operative 
findings revealed a complete transverse transection which had cut through the 
lower part of the non-pathological, normal-sized uterus with active bleeding and 
mild injury to the small bowel without active bleeding. Total hysterectomy and 
simple closure of the small bowel were performed with successful outcomes. We 
hypothesize that transection was caused by the enormous pressure produced by 
blunt trauma transmitted through the abdomen by the fastened safety belt and the 
weakness of the uterine wall caused by the previous low transverse cesarean 
section which facilitated the separation and extension to the entire wall. In 
conclusion, this case study provides the following learning points: (1) Enormous 
forces produced by a fixed fastened safety belt during a car accident can cause 
complete transverse transection of a normal-sized, non-pathological uterus, 
leading to life-threatening intra-abdominal hemorrhage. (2) A previous cesarean 
section may potentiate the transection, especially when the uterus is 
repositioned above the pelvic brim. (3) The gynecologic condition should also be 
included in the differential diagnoses in cases of intra-abdominal hemorrhage. 
If highly suspected, gynecologists should be notified for early recognition and 
avoidance of delayed actions.

BACKGROUND: Dementia is a neurodegenerative disease resulting in the loss of 
cognitive and psychological functions. Artificial intelligence (AI) may help in 
detection and screening of dementia; however, little is known in this area.
OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to identify and evaluate AI 
interventions for detection of dementia using motion data.
METHOD: The review followed the framework proposed by O'Malley's and Joanna 
Briggs Institute methodological guidance for scoping reviews. We adhered to the 
Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for 
Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) checklist for reporting the results. An information 
specialist performed a comprehensive search from the date of inception until 
November 2020, in five bibliographic databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science 
Core Collection, CINAHL, and IEEE Xplore. We included studies aimed at the 
deployment and testing or implementation of AI interventions using motion data 
for the detection of dementia among a diverse population, encompassing varying 
age, sex, gender, economic backgrounds, and ethnicity, extending to their health 
care providers across multiple health care settings. Studies were excluded if 
they focused on Parkinson's or Huntington's disease. Two independent reviewers 
screened the abstracts, titles, and then read the full-texts. Disagreements were 
resolved by consensus, and if this was not possible, the opinion of a third 
reviewer was sought. The reference lists of included studies were also screened.
RESULTS: After removing duplicates, 2,632 articles were obtained. After title 
and abstract screening and full-text screening, 839 articles were considered for 
categorization. The authors categorized the papers into six categories, and data 
extraction and synthesis was performed on 20 included papers from the motion 
tracking data category. The included studies assessed cognitive performance (n = 
5, 25%); screened dementia and cognitive decline (n = 8, 40%); investigated 
visual behaviours (n = 4, 20%); and analyzed motor behaviors (n = 3, 15%).
CONCLUSIONS: We presented evidence of AI systems being employed in the detection 
of dementia, showcasing the promising potential of motion tracking within this 
domain. Although some progress has been made in this field recently, there 
remain notable research gaps that require further exploration and investigation. 
Future endeavors need to compare AI interventions using motion data with 
traditional screening methods or other tech-enabled dementia detection 
mechanisms. Besides, future works should aim at understanding how gender and 
sex, and ethnic and cultural sensitivity can contribute to refining AI 
interventions, ensuring they are accessible, equitable, and beneficial across 
all society.
