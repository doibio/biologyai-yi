MEASUREMENTS: Alcohol consumption was estimated using nationally representative 
survey data combined with sales data and corrected for tourist and unrecorded 
consumption. Disease incidence, prevalence and mortality were calculated using 
Ministry of Health data. We used dose-response relationships between alcohol and 
illness from the 2016 Global Burden of Disease study and calculated disability 
rates for each illness. Changes in consumption were based on the following 
effect sizes: total intervention package [-30.3%, standard deviation 
(SD) = 0.02); tax (-7.60%, SD = 0.01); outlet density (-8.64%, SD = 0.01); 
outlet hours (-9.24%, SD = 0.01); and marketing (-8.98%, SD = 0.02). We measured 
health gain using health-adjusted life years (HALYs) and life expectancy.
FINDINGS: Compared with the BAU scenario, the total alcohol intervention package 
resulted in 726 000 [95% uncertainty interval (UI) = 492 000-913 000] HALYs 
gained during the life-time of the modelled population. Māori experienced 
greater HALY gains compared with non-Māori (0.21, 95% UI = 0.14-0.26 and 0.16, 
95% UI = 0.11-0.20, respectively). When modelled individually, each alcohol 
intervention within the intervention package produced similar health gains 
(~200 000 HALYs per intervention) owing to the similar effect sizes.
CONCLUSIONS: Modelled interventions for increased alcohol tax, reduced 
availability of alcohol and a ban on alcohol marketing among Māori and non-Māori 
in New Zealand (NZ) suggest substantial population-wide health gains and reduced 
health inequities between Māori and non-Māori.

Toxic gases have surreptitiously influenced the health and environment of 
contemporary society with their odorless/colorless characteristics. As a result, 
a pressing need for reliable and portable gas-sensing devices has continuously 
increased. However, with their negligence to efficiently microstructure their 
bulky supportive layer on which the sensing and heating materials are located, 
previous semiconductor metal-oxide gas sensors have been unable to fully enhance 
their power efficiency, a critical factor in power-stringent portable devices. 
Herein, an ultrathin insulation layer with a unique serpentine architecture is 
proposed for the development of a power-efficient gas sensor, consuming only 
2.3 mW with an operating temperature of 300 °C (≈6% of the leading commercial 
product). Utilizing a mechanically robust serpentine design, this work presents 
a fully suspended standalone device with a supportive layer thickness of only 
≈50 nm. The developed gas sensor shows excellent mechanical durability, 
operating over 10 000 on/off cycles and ≈2 years of life expectancy under 
continuous operation. The gas sensor detected carbon monoxide concentrations 
from 30 to 1 ppm with an average response time of ≈15 s and distinguishable 
sensitivity to 1 ppm (ΔR/R0 = 5%). The mass-producible fabrication and heating 
efficiency presented here provide an exemplary platform for diverse 
power-efficient-related devices.

BACKGROUND: Individuals of lower socioeconomic status generally have higher 
healthcare expenditures than individuals of higher socioeconomic status. 
However, little is known about how expenditures are distributed across 
socioeconomic groups over a lifetime, once accounting for differences in life 
expectancy. This study describes how lifetime healthcare expenditures are 
distributed across age, sex and socioeconomic groups in Sweden while adjusting 
for differences in life expectancy.
METHODS: Healthcare utilization from 2016 were linked to demographic and 
socioeconomic data for a random sample of individuals aged 20 and above in the 
four largest Swedish regions (n = 440 659). Mortality data were used to estimate 
income- and sex-specific survival rates. Expected lifetime healthcare 
expenditures were estimated by combining survival rates with mean healthcare 
expenditures over age, by sex, and income quintile.
RESULTS: We find that expected lifetime healthcare expenditures are highest 
among the first (lowest) income quintile despite their evident lower life 
expectancy. Expected lifetime expenditures were 17.9% (16.8%) higher in the 
first income quintile compared to the fifth (highest) quintile for women (men). 
Individuals in the first income quintile had higher expected lifetime 
expenditures for all care categories except for primary care.
CONCLUSION: We conclude that despite a lower life expectancy, the quintile of 
the lowest socioeconomic status still had higher lifetime healthcare 
expenditures.

Background: Lung cancer is associated with a high mortality rate and often 
complicated with malignant pleural effusion (MPE), which has a very poor 
clinical outcome with a short life expectancy. However, our understanding of 
cell-specific mechanisms underlying the pathobiology of pleural metastasis 
remains incomplete. Methods: We analyzed single-cell transcriptomes of cells in 
pleural effusion collected from patients with lung cancer and congestive heart 
failure (as a control), respectively. Soluble and complement factors were 
measured using a multiplex cytokine bead assay. The role of ferroptosis was 
evaluated by GPX4 small interfering RNA (siRNA) transfection and overexpression. 
Results: We found that the mesothelial-mesenchymal transition (MesoMT) of the 
pleural mesothelial cells contributed to pleural metastasis, which was validated 
by lung cancer/mesothelial cell co-culture experiments. The ferroptosis 
resistance that protected cancer from death which was secondary to extracellular 
matrix detachment was critical for pleural metastasis. We found a universal 
presence of immune-suppressive lipid-associated tumor-associated macrophages 
(LA-TAMs) with complement cascade alteration in the MPE of the lung cancer 
patients. Specifically, upregulated complement factors were also found in the 
MPE, and C5 was associated with poor overall survival in the lung cancer 
patients with epidermal growth factor receptor mutation. Plasmacytoid dendritic 
cells (pDCs) exhibited a dysfunctional phenotype and pro-tumorigenic feature in 
the primary cancer. High expression of the gene set extracted from pDCs was 
associated with a poor prognosis in the lung cancer patients. Receptor-ligand 
interaction analysis revealed that the pleural metastatic niche was aggravated 
by cross-talk between mesothelial cells-cancer cells/immune cells via TNC and 
ICAM1. Conclusions: Taken together, our results highlight cell-specific 
mechanisms involved in the pathobiological development of pleural metastasis in 
lung cancer. These results provide a large-scale and high-dimensional 
characterization of the pleural microenvironment and offer a useful resource for 
the future development of therapeutic drugs in lung cancer.

BACKGROUND: While research has led to significant advancements in the health and 
life expectancy of children with Down Syndrome (DS), there remains a significant 
burden of disease and health inequity. Further research, focused on areas of 
greatest need, is imperative to address this. An understanding of what research 
has been undertaken, and any existing gaps, helps to guide future academic 
efforts.
METHODS: We utilised an epistemological approach to summarise two decades of 
paediatric DS literature. Publications were categorised according to the country 
of origin, methodology, primary health themes and subcategory research themes.
RESULTS: Across 5,800 paediatric DS publications we demonstrate a general 
increase in the number of publications in this field between 2000 and 2014, with 
a trending decline thereafter. The majority of publications were affiliated with 
Institutions based in Western countries. The majority of studies utilised a 
cross-sectional methodology (33.3%), while relatively few were interventional 
(5.6%), qualitative (2.7%) or mixed-method studies (1.6%). Most publications 
focused on development & cognition (13.1%), neurology (9.9%) and oncology 
(9.8%), with fewer focusing on genitourinary health (0.9%), growth (0.9%), 
mortality (0.9%) and child protection (0.2%).
CONCLUSION: These findings highlight areas of relative paucity within the 
paediatric DS literature which may warrant increased academic attention.

The United States has a highly sophisticated pediatric healthcare system and 
spends more than any other country per capita on children's healthcare. However, 
not all children have access to needed and affordable health care and the life 
expectancy and health outcomes of children in the country are worse than in any 
other industrialized nation. These nations typically offer universal healthcare 
for children as part of a robust recognition of a children's rights framework. 
In 1989 the United Nations adopted the Convention on the Rights of the Child 
that recognizes the right of the child to the highest attainable standard of 
health and to facilities for the treatment of illness and rehabilitation of 
health. Currently the United States is the only United Nations member country 
that has not ratified the Convention on the Rights of the Child. This paper 
outlines the potential benefits of adopting a child rights approach based on the 
principles and provisions of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. The fact 
that countries who invest much less in healthcare compared to the United States 
can achieve better health outcomes provides the certainty that a solution is 
possible and within reach.

Treatment of clival meningiomas is still one of the unresolved issues in modern 
neurosurgery. There are several treatment strategies. These ones include various 
combinations of follow-up, surgical CSF drainage, tumor resection and 
radiotherapy.
OBJECTIVE: To assess postoperative outcomes in patients with clival meningiomas.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: We analyzed 18 patients with large or giant clival 
meningiomas.
RESULTS: We assessed extent of resection using the scale by G. Frank and E. 
Pasquini (2002): total resection - 95-100%, subtotal - 80-95%, partial - 50-80%, 
extended biopsy - <50% of tumor. Total resection was achieved in 1 patient 
(5.5%), subtotal - 5 (27.8%), partial - 12 (66.7%). At the same time, brainstem 
decompression and regression of hydrocephalus were observed in all cases. 
Fourteen patients were followed-up. Median follow-up was 8.5 months. Seventeen 
patients underwent radiotherapy due to predominant partial and subtotal 
resection. Total focal dose ranged from 50 to 57 Gy in standard fractionation 
mode. None patient had residual tumor enlargement throughout the follow-up 
period. There were no lethal outcomes.
CONCLUSION: Endoscopic transnasal access to clival meningiomas in appropriate 
anatomical features of tumor and surrounding structures is a full-fledged 
alternative to transcranial treatment in these patients. This approach provides 
total resection and brainstem decompression. These facts increase life 
expectancy without deterioration of the quality of life.

Publisher: Лечение менингиом области ската остается одним из нерешенных вопросов 
в современной нейрохирургии. Существует несколько стратегий лечения, включающих 
различную комбинацию таких опций, как наблюдение, ликвородренирующая операция, 
удаление опухоли, лучевая терапия.
ЦЕЛЬ ИССЛЕДОВАНИЯ: Оценка результатов хирургического лечения серии пациентов с 
менингиомами ската.
МАТЕРИАЛ И МЕТОДЫ: Представлен опыт лечения 18 больных с большими или 
гигантскими менингиомами ската в ФГАУ «Национальный медицинский 
исследовательский центр нейрохирургии им. акад. Н.Н. Бурденко» Минздрава России.
РЕЗУЛЬТАТЫ: Радикальность удаления опухоли оценивалась по шкале G. Frank и E. 
Pasquini: тотальное удаление — 95—100%, субтотальное — 80—95%, частичное — 
50—80%, расширенная биопсия — удалено не более 50% опухоли. Тотального удаления 
опухоли удалось достичь у 1 (5,5%) пациента, субтотального — у 5 (27,8%), 
частичного — у 12 (66,7%) больных. При этом во всех случаях получилось добиться 
декомпрессии стволовых структур и регресса гидроцефалии. Катамнез прослежен у 14 
человек. Его медиана составила 8,5 мес. Ввиду преимущественно частичного и 
субтотального удаления 17 пациентам проводилось лучевое лечение. Суммарная 
очаговая доза составляла от 50 до 57 Гр в стандартном режиме фракционирования. В 
течение наблюдения ни у одного из больных не наблюдалось увеличения размера 
остаточной опухоли. Летальных исходов не было.
ЗАКЛЮЧЕНИЕ: Эндоскопический трансназальный доступ к менингиомам ската при 
соответствующих анатомических особенностях опухоли и окружающих структур 
является полноценной альтернативой транскраниальным вариантам лечения этой 
категории пациентов, позволяющей выполнять как радикальное удаление, так и 
декомпрессию стволовых структур, что уже само по себе обеспечивает продление 
жизни пациентам без снижения ее качества.

Alzheimer's disease (AD), one of the most common dementias, is a 
neurodegenerative disease characterized by cognitive impairment and decreased 
judgment function. The expected number of AD patient is increasing in the 
context of the world's advancing medical care and increasing human life 
expectancy. Since current molecular mechanism studies on AD pathogenesis are 
incomplete, there is no specific and effective therapeutic agent. Mass 
spectrometry (MS)-based unbiased proteomics studies provide an effective and 
comprehensive approach. Many advances have been made in the study of the 
mechanism, diagnostic markers, and drug targets of AD using proteomics. This 
paper focus on subcellular level studies, reviews studies using proteomics to 
study AD-associated mitochondrial dysfunction, synaptic, and myelin damage, the 
protein composition of amyloid plaques (APs) and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), 
changes in tissue extracellular vehicles (EVs) and exosome proteome, and the 
protein changes in ribosomes and lysosomes. The methods of sample separation and 
preparation and proteomic analysis as well as the main findings of these studies 
are involved. The results of these proteomics studies provide insights into the 
pathogenesis of AD and provide theoretical resource and direction for future 
research in AD, helping to identify new biomarkers and drugs targets for AD.

OBJECTIVE: To develop an injectable dosage form of the daily oral HIV drugs, 
tenofovir (T), lamivudine (L), and dolutegravir (D), creating a single, 
complete, all-in-one TLD 3-drug-combination that demonstrates long-acting 
pharmacokinetics.
DESIGN: Using drug-combination-nanoparticle (DcNP) technology to stabilize 
multiple HIV drugs, the 3-HIV drugs TLD, with disparate physical-chemical 
properties, are stabilized and assembled with lipid-excipients to form 
TLD-in-DcNP . TLD-in-DcNP is verified to be stable and suitable for subcutaneous 
administration. To characterize the plasma time-courses and PBMC concentrations 
for all 3 drugs, single subcutaneous injections of TLD-in-DcNP were given to 
nonhuman primates (NHP, M. nemestrina ).
RESULTS: Following single-dose TLD-in-DcNP , all drugs exhibited long-acting 
profiles in NHP plasma with levels that persisted for 4 weeks above predicted 
viral-effective concentrations for TLD in combination. Times-to-peak were within 
24 hr in all NHP for all drugs. Compared to a free-soluble TLD, TLD-in-DcNP 
provided exposure enhancement and extended duration 7.0-, 2.1-, and 20-fold as 
AUC boost and 10-, 8.3-, and 5.9-fold as half-life extension. Additionally, DcNP 
may provide more drug exposure in cells than plasma with PBMC-to-plasma drug 
ratios exceeding one, suggesting cell-targeted drug-combination delivery.
CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms that TLD with disparate properties can be made 
stable by DcNP to enable TLD concentrations of 4 weeks in NHP. Study results 
highlighted the potential of TLD-in-DcNP as a convenient all-in-one, complete 
HIV long-acting product for clinical development.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: While most patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) 
present in a chronic phase and are expected to have a normal life expectancy, 
some patients present with or progress to a more aggressive accelerated phase 
(AP) or blast phase (BP) of CML. Herein, we discuss the diagnostic 
considerations of advanced phase CML and review its contemporary management.
RECENT FINDINGS: Later-generation, more potent BCR::ABL1 tyrosine kinase 
inhibitors (TKIs) such as ponatinib may result in superior outcomes in patients 
with advanced phase CML. For CML-BP, combination approaches directed against the 
blast immunophenotype appear superior to TKI monotherapy. The role of allogeneic 
stem cell transplantation is controversial in CML-AP but has consistently been 
shown to improve outcomes for patients with CML-BP. Advanced phase CML, 
particularly CML-BP, remains a poor risk subtype of CML. However, novel 
combination approaches using later-generation TKIs are being explored in 
clinical trials and may lead to improved outcomes.

The aerial root mealybug, Pseudococcus baliteus Lit (Hemiptera: Pseudococcidae), 
is an important invasive and quarantine pest that poses a potential threat to 
fruits, vegetables, and ornamental plants. As a result, phytosanitary treatments 
are necessary to ensure the commodities of international trade are free from 
these pests. To determine the minimum absorbed dose required for phytosanitary 
irradiation (PI) application, irradiation dose-response and large-scale 
confirmatory tests were conducted. Eggs that were 2, 4, and 6 days old and late 
gravid females (containing 0-day-old eggs) of P. baliteus were X-ray irradiated 
with doses of 10, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, and 120 Gray (Gy). The efficacy of 
preventing egg-hatching (mortality) was compared using two-way ANOVA, 95% 
confidence interval overlapping and lethal dose ratio test in probit analysis. 
The radiotolerance sequence of mealybugs egg was found to be 0 < 2 ≈ 4 < 
6-day-old eggs, and their estimated LD99.9968 values with 95% confidence 
interval were 132.0 (118.9-149.5), 137.6 (125.2-153.7), 145.5 (134.5-159.1), and 
157.4 (144.6-173.6) Gy, respectively. Subsequently, target doses of 135 and 145 
Gy were used in the confirmatory gamma radiation treatments. No F1 generation 
neonates developed from a total of 47,316 late females irradiated at the 
measured dose of 107.7-182.5 Gy, resulting in the treatment efficiency of

This study aims to estimate the global, regional, and national burden of 
depressive disorders in 204 countries and territories from 1990 to 2019. All 
data were obtained from the 2019 Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study. 
Age-period-cohort (APC) modeling was conducted to disentangle age, period, and 
birth cohort effects on depression incidence. We compared these estimates across 
regions classified based on their socio-demographic index (SDI). The Estimated 
Annual Percentage Change (EAPC) was calculated for each of the 204 countries and 
territories to identify the top five countries with increased depression 
incidence (Spain, Mexico, Malaysia, the United States of America, and Uruguay) 
and the top five countries with decreased depression incidence (Singapore, 
Estonia, Cuba, Maldives, and Sri Lanka). The results from APC analysis indicate 
that although depression incidence has decreased globally, the incidence rate in 
high SDI regions is still increasing, especially in the younger generations. 
Findings suggest that currently some populations are in need of receiving more 
psychological support (i.e., individuals born after 1950s in high SDI regions; 
males in middle SDI regions). Forthcoming studies could corroborate our findings 
using individual-level data which may guide future prevention and intervention 
of depression in high-risk populations or regions.

After two decades of use in chronic myeloid leukaemia, the risks and benefits of 
established treatment practices for BCR::ABL1 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) 
in the chronic myeloid leukaemia in chronic phase of the disease should be 
analysed. In this Viewpoint, we suggest that the use of lower than approved TKI 
doses in both front-line and later-line therapies would result in similar 
treatment efficacy, less toxicity, better treatment compliance, and reduced cost 
of care. The absence of an early molecular response might not warrant a change 
of a TKI, particularly for second-generation TKIs. Among patients in whom 
reaching a treatment-free remission is not a therapeutic goal or treatment-free 
remission is unlikely, changing TKIs to improve the depth of molecular response 
might result in more harm than good. Reducing the TKI dose in response to mild 
to moderate, or even serious, reversible side-effects might be better than 
changing the TKI. The availability of generic imatinib, generic dasatinib, and 
possibly later other generic second-generation TKIs would offer 90% of patients 
with chronic myeloid leukaemia an effective, safe, and affordable therapy that 
normalises life expectancy, and results in treatment-free remission status in 
30-50% of patients over the long term. Finally, based on treatment value, any 
TKI that costs more than US$30 000-40 000 per year should be critically 
evaluated in relation to alternative modalities, such allogeneic haematopoietic 
stem-cell transplantation.

Landscapes nearby glaciers are disproportionally affected by climate change, but 
we lack detailed information on microclimate variations that can modulate the 
impacts of global warming on proglacial ecosystems and their biodiversity. Here, 
we use near-subsurface soil temperatures in 175 stations from polar, equatorial 
and alpine glacier forelands to generate high-resolution temperature 
reconstructions, assess spatial variability in microclimate change from 2001 to 
2020, and estimate whether microclimate heterogeneity might buffer the severity 
of warming trends. Temporal changes in microclimate are tightly linked to 
broad-scale conditions, but the rate of local warming shows great spatial 
heterogeneity, with faster warming nearby glaciers and during the warm season, 
and an extension of the snow-free season. Still, most of the fine-scale spatial 
variability of microclimate is one-to-ten times larger than the temporal change 
experienced during the past 20 years, indicating the potential for microclimate 
to buffer climate change, possibly allowing organisms to withstand, at least 
temporarily, the effects of warming.

Imaging mass cytometry (IMC) is a highly multiplexed, antibody-based imaging 
method that captures heterogeneous spatial protein expression patterns at 
subcellular resolution. Here we report the extension of IMC to low-abundance 
markers through incorporation of the DNA-based signal amplification by exchange 
reaction, immuno-SABER. We applied SABER-IMC to image the tumor immune 
microenvironment in human melanoma by simultaneous imaging of 18 markers with 
immuno-SABER and 20 markers without amplification. SABER-IMC enabled the 
identification of immune cell phenotypic markers, such as T cell co-receptors 
and their ligands, that are not detectable with IMC.

BACKGROUND: Asia's inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) burden has rapidly increased 
recently, but the epidemiological trends in Asia remain unclear. We report IBD's 
incidence, prevalence, mortality, and Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALY) in 
52 Asian countries from 1990 to 2019.
METHODS: Data from the Global Burden of Disease 2019 were analyzed for IBD 
burden across 52 countries, using metrics like incidence, prevalence, mortality 
rates, and DALY. The epidemiological trend of IBD from 1990 to 2019 was assessed 
with the Joinpoint and APC methods. Decomposition and frontier analyses examined 
factors behind IBD case and death changes. The NORPRED forecasted Asia's 
morbidity and mortality trends from 2019 to 2044.
RESULTS: From 1990 to 2019, The incidence and prevalence of IBD increased in 
Asia, while mortality and DALY decreased. East Asia had the highest increase in 
disease burden. IBD incidence was highest among the 30-34 age group, with 
prevalence peaking in the 45-49 age group. In high-income regions, IBD peak age 
shifted to younger groups. Decompose analysis showed population growth as the 
primary factor for the increasing IBD cases in Asia. NORDPRED model predicted a 
continued IBD burden increase in Asia over the next 25 years.
CONCLUSIONS: Between 1990 and 2019, ASIR and ASPR of IBD in Asia increased, 
while ASMR and ASDR decreased. Due to population growth and aging, the IBD 
burden is expected to rise over the next 25 years, particularly in East Asia.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Cystic fibrosis is an inherited, multisystem disease that 
affects the gastrointestinal system in numerous ways. This article reviews the 
nutritional, gastrointestinal, and hepatobiliary manifestations of cystic 
fibrosis with an emphasis on the effects of CFTR modulator therapy.
RECENT FINDINGS: The life expectancy of individuals with cystic fibrosis has 
increased substantially in recent years. CFTR modulator therapy improves 
pulmonary function and results in weight gain. An individualized approach to 
nutrition is encouraged. Pancreatic exocrine function may improve with 
intervention early in life. The use of non-invasive methods to screen for 
hepatobiliary involvement is recommended. Highly effective CFTR modulators lead 
to increased survival and improved quality of life for many individuals. Their 
effects on gastrointestinal symptoms and hepatobiliary disease are not fully 
understood. Patient-reported outcome measures and biomarkers are important 
clinical endpoints for studying the effects of modulators.

BACKGROUND: The current standard operation for proximal gastric and 
gastroesophageal junction (P/GEJ) cancers with limited esophageal extension is 
total gastrectomy (TG). TG is associated with impaired appetite and weight 
loss due to the loss of gastric functions such as production of ghrelin and 
with anemia due to intrinsic factor loss and vitamin B12 malabsorption. 
Theoretically, proximal gastrectomy (PG) can mitigate these problems by 
preserving gastric function. However, PG with direct esophagogastric 
reconstruction is associated with severe postoperative reflux, delayed gastric 
emptying, and poor quality of life (QoL). Minimally invasive PG (MIPG) with 
antireflux techniques has been increasingly performed by experts but is 
technically demanding owing to its complexity. Moreover, the actual advantages 
of MIPG over minimally invasive TG (MITG) with regards to postoperative QoL are 
unknown. Our overall objective of this study is to determine the short-term QoL 
benefits of MIPG. Our central hypotheses are that MIPG is safe and that patients 
have improved appetite after MIPG with effective antireflux techniques, which 
leads to an overall QoL improvement when compared with MITG.
METHODS: Enrollment of a total of 60 patients in this prospective 
survey-collection study is expected. Procedures (MITG versus MIPG, antireflux 
techniques for MIPG [double-tract reconstruction versus the double-flap 
technique]) will be chosen based on surgeon and/or patient preference. 
Randomization is not considered feasible because patients often have strong 
preferences regarding MITG and MIPG. The primary outcome is appetite level 
(reported on a 0-10 scale) at 3 months after surgery. With an expected 30 
patients per cohort (MITG versus MIPG), this study will have 80% power to detect 
a one-point difference in appetite level. Patient-reported outcomes will be 
longitudinally collected (including questions about appetite and reflux), and 
specific QoL items, body weight, body mass index and ghrelin, albumin, and 
hemoglobin levels will be compared.
DISCUSSION: Surgeons from the US, Japan, and South Korea formed this 
collaboration with the agreement that the surgical approach to P/GEJ cancers is 
an internationally important but controversial topic that requires immediate 
action. At the completion of the proposed research, our expected outcome is the 
establishment of the benefit and safety of MIPG.

BACKGROUND: Numerous studies over the past four decades have revealed that 
breast cancer screening (BCS) significantly reduces breast cancer (BC) 
mortality. However, in BRICS-plus countries, the association between BCS and BC 
case fatality and disability are unknown. This study examines the association of 
different BCS approaches with age-standardized mortality, case-fatality, and 
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) rates, as well as with other biological 
and sociodemographic risk variables, across BRICS-plus from a national and 
economic perspective.
METHODS: In this ecological study applying mixed-effect multilevel regression 
models, a country-specific dataset was analyzed by combining data from the 
Global Burden of Disease study 2019 on female age-standardized BC mortality, 
incidence, and DALYs rates with information on national/regional BCS 
availability (against no such program or only a pilot program) and BCS type 
(only self-breast examination (SBE) and/or clinical breast examination (CBE) 
[SBE/CBE] versus SBE/CBE with mammographic screening availability [MM and/or 
SBE/CBE] versus SBE/CBE/mammographic with digital mammography and/or ultrasound 
(US) [DMM/US and/or previous tests] in BRICS-plus countries.
RESULTS: Compared to self/clinical breast examinations (SBE/CBE) across 
BRICS-plus, more complex BCS program availability was the most significant 
predictor of decreased mortality [MM and/or SBE/CBE: - 2.64, p < 0.001; DMM/US 
and/or previous tests: - 1.40, p < 0.001]. In the BRICS-plus, CVD presence, high 
BMI, second-hand smoke, and active smoking all contributed to an increase in BC 
mortality and DALY rate. High-income and middle-income regions in BRICS-plus had 
significantly lower age-standardized BC mortality, case-fatality, and DALYs 
rates than low-income regions when nationwide BC screening programs were 
implemented.
CONCLUSIONS: The availability of mammography (digital or traditional) and BCS is 
associated with breast cancer burden in BRICS-plus countries, with regional 
variations. In light of high-quality evidence from previous causal studies, 
these findings further support the preventive role of mammography screening for 
BCS at the national level. Intervening on BCS related risk factors may further 
reduce the disease burden associated with BC.

Mango (Mangifera indica L.) is one of the most economically important fruit 
crops across the world, mainly in the tropics and subtropics of Asia, Africa, 
and Central and South America. Abiotic stresses are the prominent hindrance that 
can adversely affect the growth, development, and significant yield loss of 
mango trees. Understanding the molecular physiological mechanisms underlying 
abiotic stress responses in mango is highly intricate. Therefore, to gain 
insights into the molecular basis and to alleviate the abiotic stress responses 
to enhance the yield in the mere future, the use of high-throughput frontier 
approaches should be tied along with the baseline investigations. Taking these 
gaps into account, this comprehensive review mainly speculates to provide 
detailed mechanisms and impacts on physiological and biochemical alterations in 
mango under abiotic stress responses. In addition, the review emphasizes the 
promising omics approaches in unraveling the candidate genes and transcription 
factors (TFs) responsible for abiotic stresses. Furthermore, this review also 
summarizes the role of different types of biostimulants in improving the abiotic 
stress responses in mango. These studies can be undertaken to recognize the 
roadblocks and avenues for enhancing abiotic stress tolerance in mango 
cultivars. Potential investigations pointed out the implementation of powerful 
and essential tools to uncover novel insights and approaches to integrate the 
existing literature and advancements to decipher the abiotic stress mechanisms 
in mango. Furthermore, this review serves as a notable pioneer for researchers 
working on mango stress physiology using integrative approaches.
