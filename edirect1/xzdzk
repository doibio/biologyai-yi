OBJECTIVE: Advances in medicine have increased the life expectancy of pediatric 
patients with chronic illnesses, and challenges with the guided transition of 
adolescents and young adults from pediatric clinics to adult clinics have grown. 
The aim of this study was to better understand readiness and factors related to 
this transition process in Brazil.
METHOD: In this cross-sectional study of 308 patients aged from 16 to 21 years 
under follow-up in pediatric specialties, the degree of readiness for transition 
was assessed using the Transition Readiness Assessment Questionnaire (TRAQ) and 
its domains. Associations with demographic data, clinical data, socio-economic 
level, medication adherence, family functionality, and parental satisfaction 
with health care were evaluated.
RESULTS: The median TRAQ score was 3.7 (3.2 - 4.2). Better readiness was 
associated with female patients, socio-economic class A-B, current active 
employment, higher level of education, not failing any school year, attending 
medical appointments alone, functional family, and a good knowledge of disease 
and medications. A low correlation was observed between TRAQ and age. TRAQ 
presented good internal consistency (alpha-Cronbach 0.86). In the multiple 
linear regression, TRAQ score showed a significant association with female 
gender, advanced age, socio-economic class A-B, better knowledge of disease and 
medications, and independence to attend appointments alone.
CONCLUSION: TRAQ instrument can guide healthcare professionals to identify 
specific areas of approach, in order to support adolescents with chronic disease 
to set goals for their own personal development and improve their readiness to 
enter into the adult healthcare system. In this study, some factors were related 
to better TRAQ scores.

INTRODUCTION: The purpose of emergency medical services (EMS) is to preserve 
life and limb in emergency situations. Palliative care, however, is not 
concerned with 'life-saving' measures, but the prevention and relief of 
suffering. While these care goals appear to conflict, EMS and palliative care 
may be complementary if integrated. The aim of this scoping review is to map 
existing literature concerning EMS and palliative care by identifying literature 
types, extracting key findings and noting limitations using descriptive 
analysis.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The framework of Arksey and O'Malley will direct this 
review. The following databases will be searched: MEDLINE via PubMed, Web of 
Science, CINAHL, Embase and PsycINFO. In addition, the University of Cape Town 
Thesis Repository and Google Scholar will be searched for relevant grey 
literature. Empirical studies concerning EMS and palliative care published 
between January 2000 and September 2021 will be included. Article selection will 
be performed and presented in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for 
Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for scoping reviews checklist. 
Extracted data from included articles will undergo descriptive analysis with 
findings being reported in a discussion format.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This review will identify and describe existing 
literature concerning EMS and palliative care, highlighting key findings and 
knowledge gaps in the subject area. Findings will be disseminated to relevant 
stakeholders through peer-reviewed, open-access journal publication. As no 
participants will be involved and selected literature is publicly available, no 
ethical approval will be required.

INTRODUCTION: Carotid revascularization in patients with end-stage renal disease 
(ESRD) continues to be a controversial topic, as life expectancy is poor, thus, 
preventing the recouperation of cumulative stroke-risk reduction in the 
postoperative period. We performed this primarily descriptive analysis of the 
results of transcarotid revascularization (TCAR) in renal failure patients.
METHODS: A retrospective review of two independent carotid revascularization 
databases maintained at two large health systems were performed to capture all 
consecutive TCAR procedures. Patients were classified as either (1) ESRD or (2) 
preserved renal function (PRF) and compared with standard univariate techniques, 
where appropriate.
RESULTS: From December 2015 to April 2022, 851 consecutive TCARs were attempted 
at our participating facilities. Of these, 27 were performed in ESRD patients 
(all hemodialysis). These patients were younger and presented with a higher 
Charlson Comorbidity Index. The incidence of a high anatomic risk criterion as 
defined for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) were similar 
between groups, as was the incidence of a symptomatic carotid lesion. There were 
no differences between the groups in terms of intraoperative characteristics and 
the postoperative medication management were grossly similar by renal function. 
In the 30-day perioperative period, there were no stroke, death, or myocardial 
infarction in the 27 ESRD patients treated with TCAR. The mean duration of 
follow-up in the ESRD cohort was 15.0 months. During this time, there was no 
ipsilateral stroke events, one contralateral stroke, and one MI. All 27 carotid 
stents remained patent during this period. Six patients perished after TCAR at a 
mean interval of 12.2 months after TCAR.
CONCLUSION: Survival is poor after carotid revascularization via the TCAR 
technique on intermediate follow-up. Careful patient selection is required to 
identify those who will survive to collect on the cumulative stroke-risk 
reduction afforded by carotid intervention.

Brown root rot disease (BRRD), caused by Phellinus noxius, is an important tree 
disease in tropical and subtropical areas. To improve chemical control of BRRD 
and deter emergence of fungicide resistance in P. noxius, this study 
investigated control efficacies and systemic activities of fungicides with 
different modes of action. Fourteen fungicides with 11 different modes of action 
were tested for inhibitory effects in vitro on 39 P. noxius isolates from 
Taiwan, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Australia, and Pacific Islands. Cyproconazole, 
epoxiconazole, and tebuconazole (Fungicide Resistance Action Committee [FRAC] 3, 
target-site G1) inhibited colony growth of P. noxius by 99.9 to 100% at 10 ppm 
and 97.7 to 99.8% at 1 ppm. The other effective fungicide was cyprodinil + 
fludioxonil (FRAC 9 + 12, target-site D1 + E2), which showed growth inhibition 
of 96.9% at 10 ppm and 88.6% at 1 ppm. Acropetal translocation of six selected 
fungicides was evaluated in bishop wood (Bischofia javanica) seedlings by 
immersion of the root tips in each fungicide at 100 ppm, followed by liquid or 
gas chromatography tandem mass spectrometry analyses of consecutive segments of 
root, stem, and leaf tissues at 7 and 21 days posttreatment. Bidirectional 
translocation of the fungicides was also evaluated by stem injection of 
fungicide stock solutions. Cyproconazole and tebuconazole were the most readily 
absorbed by roots and efficiently transported acropetally. Greenhouse 
experiments suggested that cyproconazole, tebuconazole, and epoxiconazole have a 
slightly higher potential for controlling BRRD than mepronil, prochloraz, and 
cyprodinil + fludioxonil. Because all tested fungicides lacked basipetal 
translocation, soil drenching should be considered instead of trunk injection 
for their use in BRRD control.

Alzheimer's disease is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases in the 
western population. The incidence of this disease increases with age. Rising 
life expectancy and the resulting increase in the ratio of elderly in the 
population are likely to exacerbate socioeconomic problems. Alzheimer's disease 
is a multifactorial disease. In addition to amyloidogenic processing leading to 
plaques, and tau pathology, but also other molecular causes such as oxidative 
stress or inflammation play a crucial role. We summarize the molecular 
mechanisms leading to Alzheimer's disease and which potential interventions are 
known to interfere with these mechanisms, focusing on nutritional approaches and 
physical activity but also the beneficial effects of cognition-oriented 
treatments with a focus on language and communication. Interestingly, recent 
findings also suggest a causal link between oral conditions, such as 
periodontitis or edentulism, and Alzheimer's disease, raising the question of 
whether dental intervention in Alzheimer's patients can be beneficial as well. 
Unfortunately, all previous single-domain interventions have been shown to have 
limited benefit to patients. However, the latest studies indicate that combining 
these efforts into multidomain approaches may have increased preventive or 
therapeutic potential. Therefore, as another emphasis in this review, we provide 
an overview of current literature dealing with studies combining the 
above-mentioned approaches and discuss potential advantages compared to 
monotherapies. Considering current literature and intervention options, we also 
propose a multidomain interdisciplinary approach for the treatment of 
Alzheimer's disease patients that synergistically links the individual 
approaches. In conclusion, this review highlights the need to combine different 
approaches in an interdisciplinary manner, to address the future challenges of 
Alzheimer's disease.

Background: Hemophilia A (HA) is an X-linked recessive blood coagulation 
disorder caused by a variety of abnormalities in F8 gene, resulting in the 
absence of impaired molecule production of factor VIII (FVIII) in the plasma. 
The genetic testing of the F8 gene encoding FVIII is used for confirmation of HA 
diagnosis, which significantly reduced serious complications of this disease 
and, ultimately, increased life expectancy. Methods: Sanger sequencing was 
performed in F8 gene exons of the suspected patients with blood 
coagulation-related indicators. Results: A novel F8 indel variant c.6343delC, 
p.Leu2115SerfsTer28 in exon 22 of the F8 gene was identified in the suspected 
families. The infant with this novel variant appeared the symptom of minor 
bleeding and oral cavity bleeding, and decreased activity of FVIII, which is 
consistent with that of F8 deleterious variants. The 3'D protein structural 
analysis of the novel variant shows a change in FVIII protein stability, which 
may be responsible for the pathogenesis of HA. Conclusions: A novel deleterious 
variant was identified in our case, which expands the F8 variants spectrum. Our 
result is helpful for HA diagnosis and benefits carrier detection and prenatal 
diagnosis. Our study also reveals that mutation screening of the F8 gene should 
be necessary for HA suspected patients.

Sirtuins (SIRT1-7 in mammals) are evolutionarily conserved nicotinamide adenine 
dinucleotide-dependent lysine deacetylases/deacylases that regulate fundamental 
biological processes including aging. In this study, we reveal that male Sirt7 
knockout (KO) mice exhibited an extension of mean and maximum lifespan and a 
delay in the age-associated mortality rate. In addition, aged male Sirt7 KO mice 
displayed better glucose tolerance with improved insulin sensitivity compared 
with wild-type (WT) mice. Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) enhances insulin 
sensitivity and extends lifespan when it is overexpressed. Serum levels of FGF21 
were markedly decreased with aging in WT mice. In contrast, this decrease was 
suppressed in Sirt7 KO mice, and the serum FGF21 levels of aged male Sirt7 KO 
mice were higher than those of WT mice. Activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) 
stimulates Fgf21 transcription, and the hepatic levels of Atf4 mRNA were 
increased in aged male Sirt7 KO mice compared with WT mice. Our findings 
indicate that the loss of SIRT7 extends lifespan and improves glucose metabolism 
in male mice. High serum FGF21 levels might be involved in the beneficial effect 
of SIRT7 deficiency.

BACKGROUND: With the growing life expectancy for older adults, this study aims 
to examine the correlation among sociodemographic characteristics and the 
combined effect of QoL-related domains including physical health, psychological 
health, social relationships, and environmental factors with the overall QoL 
level of older adults in Taiwan.
METHODS: The WHOQOL-BREF Taiwanese Version questionnaire was adopted and 
conducted using a randomized telephone interview system from community household 
elders. In total, 1078 participants aged 65 years and older were recruited. A 
multiple regression model was used to examine the statistical significance 
between the overall QoL score as the dependent variable and the sociodemographic 
characteristics, and 26 items of QoL-related questionnaires as the independent 
variables.
RESULTS: Categories including female, aged 85 years and above, higher education 
level, and better financial situation had significantly higher overall QoL 
level. Except the physical health domain and six items, the correlations among 
all other domains and their including items of questionnaires with overall QoL 
level were significant.
CONCLUSION: The Taiwanese WHOQOL-BREF questionnaire can be used to examine the 
overall QoL level of elders in Taiwan. Nevertheless, the robust systems of 
universal health care and long-term care in Taiwan may have led to the no 
significance of the six items.

BACKGROUND: The credible materials about the burden of asthma in China when 
compared to other countries in the group of twenty (G20) remain unavailable.
OBJECTIVES AND DESIGN: Following the popular analysis strategy used in the 
Global Burden of Disease Study, the age-, sex-, country-specific prevalence, and 
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) of asthma in China were analyzed. 
Meanwhile, the comparison in trends between China and other countries in the G20 
was also evaluated.
RESULTS: In 2019, asthma was the 8th leading cause of the DALYs' burden of 369 
diseases in China. From 1990 to 2019, the age-standardized prevalence and DALY 
rates of asthma in China decreased by 14% and 51%, respectively; further, the 
decline rate of DALYs was much higher than the global average (-51%: -43%). It 
is worth noting that the overall population age-standardized DALYs rate of 
asthma in China was the lowest in the G20 during 2019 (102.81, 95% UI: 
(72.30,147.42)/100,000). Moreover, the age-standardized asthma prevalence rate 
peaks in both childhood (178.14, 95% UI: (90.50, 329.01)/100,000) and the 
elderly (541.80, 95% UI: (397.79, 679.92)/100,000). Moreover, throughout the 
study, subjects in the 5 to 9 years old interval were a constant focus of our 
attention.
CONCLUSIONS: The disease burden of asthma has varied greatly by gender and age 
over the past 30 years. In contrast to the increasing burden in most other G20 
countries, the age-standardized prevalence rate of asthma shows a significant 
decreasing trend in China, however, the age-standardized DALYs rate shows a 
fluctuating change, and has even shown a rebound trend in recent years.

Background-The incidence of colorectal cancer is increasing among elderly 
people, where postoperative complications are frequent. Methods-We evaluated 
postoperative physical and quality of life changes in elderly patients 
undergoing laparoscopic surgery for colorectal cancer. A prospective cohort 
study was performed in 31 colorectal cancer patients ≥60 years who were 
scheduled for laparoscopic surgery due to colorectal cancer. Outcomes were 
measured one month preoperative (T1), three days postoperative (T2) and one 
month postoperative (T3). Results-The largest early postoperative (from T1 to 
T2) declines were observed for isometric knee extension strength (33.1%), 30 s 
Chair Stand Test (27.9%) and handgrip strength (16.9%). Significant reductions 
in quality of life measured with the QLQ-C30 summary score and the EQ 5D index 
score were found between T1-T3 and T1-T2, respectively. Conclusions-A decline in 
isometric knee extension strength, 30 s Chair Stand Test, handgrip strength and 
quality of life is evident in elderly patients in the days following 
laparoscopic surgery for colorectal cancer. Preoperative values are recovered 
one month after surgery for all the outcomes, except for isometric knee 
extension, which should receive especial attention.

All around the world, inequalities persist in the complex web of social, 
economic, and ecological factors that mediate food security outcomes at 
different human and institutional scales. There have been rapid and continuous 
improvements in agricultural productivity and better food security in many 
regions of the world during the past 50 years due to an expansion in crop area, 
irrigation, and supportive policy and institutional initiatives. However, in 
Sub-Saharan Africa, the situation is inverted. Statistics show that food 
insecurity has risen since 2015 in Sub-Saharan African countries, and the 
situation has worsened owing to the Ukraine conflict and the ongoing 
implications of the COVID-19 threat. This review looks into multidimensional 
challenges to achieving the SDG2 goal of "End hunger, achieve food security and 
improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture" in Sub-Saharan Africa 
and the prosper policy recommendations for action. Findings indicate that weak 
economic growth, gender inequality, high inflation, low crop productivity, low 
investment in irrigated agriculture and research, climate change, high 
population growth, poor policy frameworks, weak infrastructural development, and 
corruption are the major hurdles in the sustaining food security in Sub-Saharan 
Africa. Promoting investments in agricultural infrastructure and extension 
services together with implementing policies targeted at enhancing the 
households' purchasing power, especially those in rural regions, appear to be 
essential drivers for improving both food availability and food access.

Sedentary behaviours continue to increase and are associated with heightened 
risks of morbidity and mortality. We assessed the cost-effectiveness of SMART 
Work & Life (SWAL), an intervention designed to reduce sitting time inside and 
outside of work, both with (SWAL-desk) and without (SWAL-only) a 
height-adjustable workstation compared to usual practice (control) for UK office 
workers. Health outcomes were assessed in quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) and 
costs in pound sterling (2019-2020). Discounted costs and QALYs were estimated 
using regression methods with multiply imputed data from the SMART Work & Life 
trial. Absenteeism, productivity and wellbeing measures were also evaluated. The 
average cost of SWAL-desk was £228.31 and SWAL-only £80.59 per office worker. 
Within the trial, SWAL-only was more effective and costly compared to control 
(incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER): £12,091 per QALY) while SWAL-desk 
was dominated (least effective and most costly). However, over a lifetime 
horizon, both SWAL-only and SWAL-desk were more effective and more costly than 
control. Comparing SWAL-only to control generated an ICER of £4985 per QALY. 
SWAL-desk was more effective and costly than SWAL-only, generating an ICER of 
£13,378 per QALY. Findings were sensitive to various worker, intervention, and 
extrapolation-related factors. Based on a lifetime horizon, SWAL interventions 
appear cost-effective for office-workers conditional on worker characteristics, 
intervention cost and longer-term maintenance in sitting time reductions.

BACKGROUND: Palliative care comprises multiprofessional, integrated, 
person-centered healthcare services for patients and their families facing 
problems related to progressive or advanced diseases and limited life 
expectancy. Although non-oncology patients' needs are similar to those of tumor 
patients, they are often underestimated. The purpose of our study was to 
investigate the actual utilization of palliative care services in Germany, 
especially in the outpatient setting.
METHODS: Using the IQVIA Disease Analyzer database, a total of 14,792 
outpatients from 805 primary care practices in Germany with documented 
palliative care and related diagnosis between 2018 and 2021 were analyzed. 
Proportions of different diagnoses among patients receiving outpatient 
palliative care were stratified by gender and different age groups.
RESULTS: The most common underlying diagnosis for outpatient palliative care was 
cancer (55%), followed by heart failure (16%) and dementia (8%), with age- and 
sex-specific differences found in the proportion of diagnoses for utilization. 
While the relative proportions of cancers decreased with age (87% in the 18- to 
50-year-old age group versus 37% in the 80-plus age group), the proportion of 
palliative care related to heart failure increased in the older population (2% 
in the 18- to 50-year-old age group versus 25% in the 80-plus age group).
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides an overview of the situation of outpatient 
palliative care in Germany and shows age- and gender-specific trends regarding 
the underlying medical diagnoses. Based on these data, palliative care should be 
adapted to current demographic developments.

Wellbeing can be ensured in society through quality healthcare, a minimum of 
medical errors, and the improved performance of healthcare professionals. To 
this end, health information systems have been implemented in hospitals, with 
this implementation representing progress in medicine and information 
technologies. As a result, life expectancy has significantly increased, 
standards in healthcare have been raised, and public health has improved. This 
progress is influenced by the process of managing healthcare organizations and 
information systems. While hospitals tend to adapt health information systems to 
reduce errors related to patient misidentification, the rise in the occurrence 
and recording of medical errors in Lebanon resulting from failures to correctly 
identify patients reveals that such measures remain insufficient due to unknown 
factors. This research aimed to investigate the effect of health information 
systems (HISs) and other factors related to work-related conditions on 
reductions in patient misidentification and related consequences. The empirical 
data were collected from 109 employees in Neioumazloum Hospital in Lebanon. The 
results revealed a correlation between HISs and components and the effects of 
other factors on patient identification. These other factors included workload, 
nurse fatigue, a culture of patient safety, and lack of implementation of 
patient identification policies. This paper provides evidence from a Lebanese 
hospital and paves the way for further studies aiming to explore the role of 
information technologies in adopting HISs for work performance and patient 
satisfaction. Improved care for patients can help achieve health equality, 
enhance healthcare delivery performance and patient safety, and decrease the 
numbers of medical errors.

Positive mental health and mental health literacy are two main concepts to 
ensure an individual and social state of mental health and well-being. A scoping 
review of the scientific literature published in the field of health sciences 
was conducted to identify the relationship between mental health literacy and 
the positive mental health of family caregivers. A research expression was used 
to search for articles in health databases, respecting the main topics of the 
Participants/Concept/Context (PCC) framework. A total of eight articles were 
included from the 2830 initially identified using the PRISMA Extension for 
Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) process. It was noticeable that none of the studies 
related positive mental health and mental health literacy of caregivers. 
Nevertheless, it was possible to identify predictors of mental health and 
self-efficacy, such as burden and a lack of information about and support in the 
process of care. Caregivers' quality of life, self-esteem and confidence are 
also important positive mental health predictors that are closely related to 
health literacy. The knowledge of these factors can contribute to the reduction 
in negative determinants of mental health of caregivers and the resolution of 
strategies to meet caregivers' needs.

Cisplatin (cDDP)-based chemotherapy is often limited by severe deleterious 
effects (nephrotoxicity, hepatotoxicity and neurotoxicity). The polynuclear 
palladium(II) compound Pd2Spermine (Pd2Spm) has emerged as a potential 
alternative drug, with favorable pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic properties. 
This paper reports on a Nuclear Magnetic Resonance metabolomics study to (i) 
characterize the response of mice brain and liver to Pd2Spm, compared to cDDP, 
and (ii) correlate brain-liver metabolic variations. Multivariate and 
correlation analysis of the spectra of polar and lipophilic brain and liver 
extracts from an MDA-MB-231 cell-derived mouse model revealed a stronger impact 
of Pd2Spm on brain metabolome, compared to cDDP. This was expressed by changes 
in amino acids, inosine, cholate, pantothenate, fatty acids, phospholipids, 
among other compounds. Liver was less affected than brain, with cDDP inducing 
more metabolite changes. Results suggest that neither drug induces neuronal 
damage or inflammation, and that Pd2Spm seems to lead to enhanced brain 
anti-inflammatory and antioxidant mechanisms, regulation of brain bioactive 
metabolite pools and adaptability of cell membrane characteristics. The cDDP 
appears to induce higher extension of liver damage and an enhanced need for 
liver regeneration processes. This work demonstrates the usefulness of 
untargeted metabolomics in evaluating drug impact on multiple organs, while 
confirming Pd2Spm as a promising replacement of cDDP.

It is usually difficult to achieve good outcomes with salvage treatment for 
recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) because of its deep-seated location, 
surrounding critical structures, and patient history of high-dose irradiation. 
Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKS) is a treatment option for malignancies with skull 
base and intracranial invasion. We conducted a retrospective, observational, 
single-center study including 15 patients with recurrent NPC (stage T4b) 
involving the skull base and intracranial invasion, who underwent GKS as a 
salvage treatment. Patients were enrolled over 12 years. Per a previous study, 
the TNM classification T4b was subclassified into T4b1 and T4b2, defined as the 
involvement of the skull base or cavernous sinus with an intracranial extension 
of <5 mm and >5 mm, respectively. The effect of prognostic factors, including 
age, sex, survival period, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) presentation, 
presence of other distant metastases, tumor volume, marginal dose, maximal dose, 
and Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS), on outcomes was analyzed. The patients 
with T4b1 NPC (p = 0.041), small tumor volume (p = 0.012), higher KPS (p < 
0.001), and no other metastasis (p = 0.007) had better outcomes after GKS 
treatment, suggesting that it is a viable treatment modality for NPC. We also 
suggest that detailed brain imaging studies may enable the early detection of 
intracranial invasion.

Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women. The life expectancy after a 
breast cancer diagnosis is improving steadily, leaving many more persons with 
the long-term consequences of treatment. Sexual problems are a common concern 
for breast cancer survivors yet remain overlooked in both the clinical setting 
and the research literature. Factors that contribute to sexual health concerns 
in breast cancer survivors are biopsychosocial, as are the barriers to 
addressing and treating these health concerns. Sexual health needs and treatment 
may vary by anatomy and gender. Multidisciplinary management may comprise 
lifestyle modifications, medications, sexual health aids such as vibrators, 
counseling, and referrals to pelvic health physical therapy and specialty care. 
In this article, we review the contributing factors, screening, and management 
of sexual difficulties in cisgender female breast cancer survivors. More 
information is needed to better address the sexual health of breast cancer 
survivors whose sexual/gender identity differs from that of cisgender women.

Fast charging capability is highly desired for new generation lithium-ion 
batteries used in consumer-grade electronic devices and electric vehicles. 
However, currently used anodes suffer from sluggish ion kinetics due to limited 
interlayer distance. Herein, the coal-based semicoke was chosen as precursor to 
prepare cost-effective carbon anodes with high-rate performance through a facile 
pyrolytic strategy. The evolution of microstructure and its effect on 
electrochemical performance are entirely studied. The results show that large 
number of short-ordered defective structures are generated due to the occurrence 
of turbostatic-like structures when pyrolyzed at 900 °C, which are propitious to 
large interlayer distance and developed porous structure. High accessible 
surface area and large interlayer spacing with short-ordered defective domains 
endow the sample treated at 900 °C under argon (A900) with accelerated ion 
dynamics and enhanced ion adsorption dominated surface-induced capacitive 
processes. As a result, A900 delivers high capacity (331.1 mAh g-1 at 0.1 A g-1) 
and long life expectancy (94.8% after 1000 cycles at 1 A g-1) as well as good 
rate capability (153.2 mAh g-1 at 5 A g-1). This work opens a scalable avenue to 
fabricating cost-effective, high-rate, and long cycling life carbon anodes.
