BACKGROUND: Tyrosinemia type 1 (HT1) is a rare metabolic disorder caused by a 
defect in the tyrosine catabolic pathway. Since HT1 patients are treated with 
NTBC, outcome improved and life expectancy greatly increased. However extensive 
neurocognitive and behavioural problems have been described, which might be 
related to treatment with NTBC, the biochemical changes induced by NTBC, or 
metabolites accumulating due to the enzymatic defect characterizing the disease.
OBJECTIVE: To study the possible pathophysiological mechanisms of brain 
dysfunction in HT1, we assessed blood and brain LNAA, and brain monoamine 
neurotransmitter metabolite levels in relation to behavioural and cognitive 
performance of HT1 mice.
DESIGN: C57BL/6 littermates were divided in three different experimental groups: 
HT1, heterozygous and wild-type mice (n = 10; 5 male). All groups were treated 
with NTBC and underwent cognitive and behavioural testing. One week after 
behavioural testing, blood and brain material were collected to measure amino 
acid profiles and brain monoaminergic neurotransmitter levels.
RESULTS: Irrespective of the genetic background, NTBC treatment resulted in a 
clear increase in brain tyrosine levels, whereas all other brain LNAA levels 
tended to be lower than their reference values. Despite these changes in blood 
and brain biochemistry, no significant differences in brain monoamine 
neurotransmitter (metabolites) were found and all mice showed normal behaviour 
and learning and memory.
CONCLUSION: Despite the biochemical changes, NTBC and genotype of the mice were 
not associated with poorer behavioural and cognitive function of the mice. 
Further research involving dietary treatment of FAH-/- are warranted to 
investigate whether this reveals the cognitive impairments that have been seen 
in treated HT1 patients.

[Fecal incontinence - symptoms are guiding therapy].

[Article in German]

Furtwängler A, Strittmatter B.

Fecal incontinence (FI) is an escalating medical problem. Due to increasing life 
expectancy FI becomes more evident, especially in the geriatric population. The 
prevalence varies from 4 % in the adult population reaching > 50 % in the 
octogenerians, yet most probably associated with a significant based error due 
to underreporting. Diagnosis is depending primarily upon history taking and 
gathered information from the patient and caregivers. Additional technical 
diagnostic procedures are of secondary importance. In most cases no single cause 
for FI can be identified, mostly multifactorial disorders contribute to a 
progressive loss of anorectal continence. The mainstay in therapeutic approaches 
to control symptoms comprise changes in lifestyle patterns, physiotherapy and 
medical therapy, but depend on the patient's compliance. Invasive or even 
surgical treatments are circumstantial, although sacral neuromodulation has 
proofed to be a successful treatment modality during the past decades. 
Ultimately a permanent stoma may lead to symptom control and result in an 
increased quality of life.

BACKGROUND: There is a growing consensus that the perspective of the patient 
should be considered in the evaluation of novel interventions.
RESEARCH QUESTION: What treatment outcomes matter to people with cystic fibrosis 
(CF), and what trade-offs would they make to realize these outcomes?
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Adults attending a specialist CF center were invited 
to complete an online discrete choice experiment (DCE). The DCE required 
participants to evaluate hypothetical CF treatment profiles, defined by impact 
on lung function, pulmonary exacerbations, abdominal symptoms, life expectancy, 
quality of life, inhaled medicine usage, and physiotherapy requirement. Choice 
data were analyzed, using multinomial logit and latent class models.
RESULTS: One hundred and three people with CF completed the survey (median age, 
35 years; range, 18-76 years); 52% were female; mean FEV1 % predicted, 69% [SD, 
22%]). On average, an improvement in life expectancy by 10 years or more had the 
greatest impact on treatment preference, followed by a 15% increase in lung 
function. However, it was shown that people would trade substantial reductions 
in these key outcomes to reduce treatment time or burden. Preference profiles 
were not uniform across the sample: three distinct subgroups were identified, 
each placing markedly different importance on the relative importance of both 
life expectancy and lung function compared with other attributes.
INTERPRETATION: The relative importance of treatment burden to people with CF, 
compared with life expectancy and lung function, suggests it should be routinely 
captured in clinical trials as an important secondary outcome measure. When 
considering the patient perspective, it is important that decision-makers 
recognize that the values of people with CF are not homogeneous.

OBJECTIVE: Muscle strength is a powerful predictor of mortality that can quickly 
and inexpensively be assessed by measuring handgrip strength (HGS). What is 
missing for clinical practice, however, are empirically meaningful cut-off 
points that apply to the general population and that consider the correlation of 
HGS with gender and body height as well as the decline in HGS during processes 
of normal ageing. This study provides standardised thresholds that directly link 
HGS to remaining life expectancy (RLE), thus enabling practitioners to detect 
patients with an increased mortality risk early on.
DESIGN: Relying on representative observational data from the Health and 
Retirement Study, the HGS of survey participants was z-standardised by gender, 
age and body height. We defined six HGS groups based on cut-off points in SD; we 
use these as predictors in survival analyses with a 9-year follow-up and provide 
RLE by gender based on a Gompertz model for each HGS group.
PARTICIPANTS: 8156 US American women and men aged 50-80 years.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Z-standardised HGS and all-cause mortality.
RESULTS: Even slight negative deviations in HGS from the reference group with 
[0.0 SD, 0.5 SD) have substantial effects on survival. RLE among individuals 
aged 60 years with standardised HGS of [-0.5 SD, 0.0 SD) is 3.0/1.4 years lower 
for men/women than for the reference group, increasing to a difference of 
4.1/2.6 years in the group with HGS of [-1.0 SD, -0.5 SD). By contrast, we find 
no benefit of strong HGS related to survival.
CONCLUSIONS: HGS varies substantially with gender, age and body height. This 
confirms the importance of considering these heterogeneities when defining 
reference groups and risk thresholds. Moreover, survival appears to decrease at 
much higher levels of muscle strength than is assumed in previous literature, 
suggesting that medical practitioners should start to become concerned when HGS 
is slightly below that of the reference group.

Sleep disturbances increase with age and are predictors of mortality. Here, we 
present deep neural networks that estimate age and mortality risk through 
polysomnograms (PSGs). Aging was modeled using 2500 PSGs and tested in 10,699 
PSGs from men and women in seven different cohorts aged between 20 and 90. Ages 
were estimated with a mean absolute error of 5.8 ± 1.6 years, while basic sleep 
scoring measures had an error of 14.9 ± 6.29 years. After controlling for 
demographics, sleep, and health covariates, each 10-year increment in age 
estimate error (AEE) was associated with increased all-cause mortality rate of 
29% (95% confidence interval: 20-39%). An increase from -10 to +10 years in AEE 
translates to an estimated decreased life expectancy of 8.7 years (95% 
confidence interval: 6.1-11.4 years). Greater AEE was mostly reflected in 
increased sleep fragmentation, suggesting this is an important biomarker of 
future health independent of sleep apnea.

BACKGROUND: Studies have shown that centralising surgical treatment for some 
cancers can improve patient outcomes, but there is limited evidence of the 
impact on costs or health-related quality of life.
OBJECTIVES: We report the results of a cost-utility analysis of the RESPECT-21 
study using difference-in-differences, which investigated the reconfiguration of 
specialist surgery services for four cancers in an area of London, compared to 
the Rest of England (ROE).
METHODS: Electronic health records data were obtained from the National Cancer 
Registration and Analysis Service for patients diagnosed with one of the four 
cancers of interest between 2012 and 2017. The analysis for each tumour type 
used a short-term decision tree followed by a 10-year Markov model with 
6-monthly cycles. Costs were calculated by applying National Health Service 
(NHS) Reference Costs to patient-level hospital resource use and supplemented 
with published data. Cancer-specific preference-based health-related 
quality-of-life values were obtained from the literature to calculate 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Total costs and QALYs were calculated 
before and after the reconfiguration, in the London Cancer (LC) area and in ROE, 
and probabilistic sensitivity analysis was performed to illustrate the 
uncertainty in the results.
RESULTS: At a threshold of £30,000/QALY gained, LC reconfiguration of prostate 
cancer surgery services had a 79% probability of having been cost-effective 
compared to non-reconfigured services using difference-in-differences. The 
oesophago-gastric, bladder and renal reconfigurations had probabilities of 62%, 
49% and 12%, respectively, of being cost-effective at the same threshold. Costs 
and QALYs per surgical patient increased over time for all cancers across both 
regions to varying degrees. Bladder cancer surgery had the smallest patient 
numbers and changes in costs, and QALYs were not significant. The largest 
improvement in outcomes was in renal cancer surgery in ROE, making the relative 
renal improvements in LC appear modest, and the probability of the LC 
reconfiguration having been cost-effective low.
CONCLUSIONS: Prostate cancer reconfigurations had the highest probability of 
being cost-effective. It is not clear, however, whether the prostate results can 
be considered in isolation, given the reconfigurations occurred simultaneously 
with other system changes, and healthcare delivery in the NHS is highly 
networked and collaborative. Routine collection of quality-of-life measures such 
as the EQ-5D-5L would have improved the analysis.

Global biodiversity is affected remarkably by global climate change, which in 
turn its effect reflected on all life aspects. Identifying microorganisms in 
environmental samples, particularly soil could be a valuable interest to study 
their effect on soil quality and plant growth. Through this study, we conducted 
a molecular characterization of bacteria found in the rhizosphere of Medico 
sativa plants grown in Hail soil and we highlighted their main properties. The 
sequences analyses revealed that the main bacterial isolates Pseudarthrobacter, 
Metabacillus, Priestia, and Massilia species. According to the sequences 
analysis and the phylogeny tree results, some of the identified bacteria were 
classified at the species level: Pseudarthrobacter was identified clearly as 
Pseudarthrobacter phenanthrenivorans; Metabacillus isolates grouped with 
Metabacillus sediminilitoris and the two Priestia isolates closely related to 
Priestia aryabhattai. We concluded that Hail soil is a niche of diverse bacteria 
with a high interest in soil environment and ecosystems. Further studies are 
required for further classification of all identified bacteria and to define 
their specific role in the environment.

PURPOSE: Craniopharyngiomas are nonmalignant sellar and parasellar tumors 
exhibiting a bimodal age distribution. While the outcomes following treatment in 
patients with childhood-onset craniopharyngiomas are well characterized, similar 
information in adult-onset craniopharyngiomas is limited. We aimed to describe 
the long-term outcomes (weight and metabolic parameters, mortality) in patients 
with adult-onset craniopharyngioma following treatment.
METHODS: Patients with adult-onset craniopharyngioma with initial treatment 
(1993-2017) and >6 months of follow-up at our institution were retrospectively 
identified. Body mass index (BMI) categories included obese (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2), 
overweight (BMI 25-29.9 kg/m2), and normal weight (BMI < 25 kg/m2).
RESULTS: For the 91 patients with adult-onset craniopharyngioma (44% women, mean 
diagnosis age 48.2 ± 18 years) over a mean follow-up of 100.3 ± 69.5 months, 
weight at last follow-up was significantly higher than before surgery (mean 
difference 9.5 ± 14.8 kg, P < 0.001) with a higher percentage increase in weight 
seen in those with lower preoperative BMI (normal weight (20.7 ± 18%) vs. 
overweight (13.3 ± 18.0%) vs. obese (6.4 ± 15%), P = 0.012). At last follow-up, 
the prevalence of obesity (62 vs. 40.5%, P = 0.0042) and impaired glucose 
metabolism (17.4% vs. 34%, P = 0.017) increased significantly. All-cause 
mortality was 12%, with the average age of death 71.9 ± 19.7 years (average U.S. 
life expectancy 77.7 years, CDC 2020).
CONCLUSION: Patients with adult-onset craniopharyngioma following treatment may 
experience weight gain, increased prevalence of obesity, impaired glucose 
metabolism, and early mortality. Lower preoperative BMI is associated with a 
greater percentage increase in postoperative weight.

Recife is recognized as the 16th most vulnerable city to climate change in the 
world. In addition, the city has levels of air pollutants above the new limits 
proposed by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2021. In this sense, the 
present study had two main objectives: (1) To evaluate the health (and economic) 
benefits related to the reduction in mean annual concentrations of PM10 and 
PM2.5 considering the new limits recommended by the WHO: 15 µg/m3 (PM10) and 5 
µg/m3 (PM2.5) and (2) To simulate the behavior of these pollutants in scenarios 
with increased temperature (2 and 4 °C) using machine learning. The averages of 
PM2.5 and PM10 were above the limits recommended by the WHO. The scenario 
simulating the reduction in these pollutants below the new WHO limits would 
avoid more than 130 deaths and 84 hospital admissions for respiratory or 
cardiovascular problems. This represents a gain of 15.2 months in life 
expectancy and a cost of almost 160 million dollars. Regarding the simulated 
temperature increase, the most conservative (+ 2 °C) and most drastic (+ 4 °C) 
scenarios predict an increase of approximately 6.5 and 15%, respectively, in the 
concentrations of PM2.5 and PM10, with a progressive increase in deaths 
attributed to air pollution. The study shows that the increase in temperature 
will have impacts on air particulate matter and health outcomes. Climate change 
mitigation and pollution control policies must be implemented for meeting new 
WHO air quality standards which may have health benefits.

Sweet cherry (Prunus avium L.) is a highly valued fruit, whose quality can be 
evaluated using several objective methodologies, such as calibre, colour, 
texture, soluble solids content (SSC), titratable acidity (TA), as well as 
maturity indexes. Functional and nutritional compounds are also frequently 
determined, in response to consumer demand. The aim of the present review is to 
clarify and establish quality evaluation parameters and methodologies for the 
whole cherry supply chain, in order to promote easy and faithful communication 
among all stakeholders. The use of near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) as a 
non-destructive and expeditious method for assessing some quality parameters is 
discussed. In this review, the results of a wide survey to assess the most 
common methodologies for cherry quality evaluation, carried out among cherry 
researchers and producers within the framework of the COST Action FA1104 
'Sustainable production of high-quality cherries for the European market', are 
also reported. The standardisation of quality evaluation parameters is expected 
to contribute to the preservation and shelf-life extension of sweet cherries, 
and the valorisation of the whole supply chain. For future studies on sweet 
cherry, we put forward a proposal regarding both sample size and the tests 
chosen to evaluate each parameter. © 2022 Society of Chemical Industry.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: FH is still underdiagnosed. Cost-effectiveness results of 
preventive screening strategies vary. We aimed at systematically assessing the 
benefits, harms and cost effectiveness of screening for familial 
hypercholesterolemia (FH) and at providing an overview of the main 
characteristics and methodological approaches of applied decision-analytic 
models.
METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted in MEDLINE, EconLit, 
CRD-databases and the CEA-registry for FH screening starting 2012. Earlier 
studies were included from a published systematic review. Results were reported 
in standardized semi-quantitative evidence tables. Costs were converted to 
current euros. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were recalculated 
according to economic guidelines.
RESULTS: Out of our 211 retrieved studies, eight were included in the review in 
addition to six studies from an earlier review. Studies were conducted in Europe 
(UK, The Netherlands, Spain, Poland), USA and Australia evaluating cascade (CS), 
opportunistic (OS), universal screening (UniS), or combinations using genetic 
testing, clinical criteria or combinations. Studies evaluating only CS 
identified strategies with an ICER of up to 37,100 EUR/quality-adjusted 
life-year (QALY) but some strategies were dominated depending on test 
combinations. UniS of newborns in combination with CS had an ICER≤15,000 
EUR/QALY for sequential cholesterol-genetic screening. In other studies, UniS 
was dominated by OS/CS.
CONCLUSIONS: Our systematic review demonstrates the values of FH screening and 
provides an overview of potentially relevant screening strategies to be tested 
using a decision-analytic model for the respective country or region. Future 
research is needed on the transferability of results to other countries and 
modeling spillover effects to newborns.

BACKGROUND: The rising cost of cancer drug therapy threatens the long-term 
sustainability of Taiwan National Health Insurance. Cost savings can be achieved 
through various strategies, e.g., using smaller vial sizes, sharing vials, 
weight-based dosing, or switching to biosimilars. Here we aimed to examine the 
cost-effectiveness of a trastuzumab biosimilar combined with docetaxel (TDbiol) 
for treatment-naïve HER2+ metastatic breast cancer (MBC), and the financial 
impact of drug wastage.
METHODS: A Markov model with three health states was developed to assess the 
cost-effectiveness of trastuzumab biosimilars plus docetaxel over a 40-month 
time horizon in patients with HER2+ MBC. Based on the literature and our expert 
opinion, we assumed similar efficacy between the trastuzumab biosimilar and its 
reference product. The primary clinical input for the biosimilar was the same as 
for the reference product in the Catastrophic Patient Database (HV). Health 
state utilities were derived from the literature, and direct medical costs were 
obtained from the National Health Insurance Administration (NHIA).
RESULTS: In the base-case scenario, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
(ICER) was NTD 811,050 per QALY gained. One-way sensitivity analyses showed that 
the model was sensitive to utilities and transition probabilities, but not 
particularly sensitive to the wastage assumption. In scenario analyses, the ICER 
was higher when applying the price for trastuzumab reference biologic (branded), 
than for trastuzumab biosimilar.
CONCLUSION: The trastuzumab biosimilar combination regimen is cost-effective and 
offers significant drug cost savings in Taiwan.

countries.

BACKGROUND: The economic slowdown affects the population's health. Based on a 
social gradient concept, we usually assume that this detrimental impact results 
from a lower social status, joblessness, or other related factors. Although many 
researchers dealt with the relationship between economy and health, the findings 
are still inconsistent, primarily related to unemployment. This study 
reinvestigates a relationship between the economy's condition and health by 
decomposing it into macroeconomic indicators.
METHODS: We use data for 21 European countries to estimate the panel models, 
covering the years 1995-2019. Dependent variables describe population health 
(objective measures - life expectancy for a newborn and 65 years old, healthy 
life expectancy, separately for male and female). The explanatory variables 
primarily represent GDP and other variables describing the public finance and 
health sectors.
RESULTS: (1) the level of economic activity affects the population's health - 
GDP stimulates the life expectancies positively; this finding is strongly 
statistically significant; (2) the unemployment rate also positively affects 
health; hence, increasing the unemployment rate is linked to better health - 
this effect is relatively short-term.
CONCLUSIONS: Social benefits or budgetary imbalance may play a protective role 
during an economic downturn.

BACKGROUND: This study investigated the effects of chronic heat stress on liver 
inflammatory injury and its potential mechanisms in broilers. Chickens were 
randomly assigned to the 1-week control group (Control 1), 1-week heat stress 
group (HS1), 2-week control group (Control 2), and a 2-week heat stress group 
(HS2) with 15 replicates per group. Broilers in the heat stress groups were 
exposed to heat stress (35 ± 2 °C) for 8 h/d for 7 or 14 consecutive days, and 
the rest of 26 hours/day were kept at 23 ± 2 °C like control group broilers. 
Growth performance and liver inflammatory injury were examined for the analysis 
of liver injury.
RESULTS: The results showed that heat stress for 2 weeks decreased the growth 
performance, reduced the liver weight (P < 0.05) and liver index (P < 0.05), 
induced obvious bleeding and necrosis points. Liver histological changes found 
that the heat stress induced the liver infiltration of neutrophils and 
lymphocytes in broilers. Serum levels of AST and SOD were enhanced in HS1 
(P < 0.01, P < 0.05) and HS2 (P < 0.01, P < 0.05) group, compared with control 1 
and 2 group broilers. The MDA content in HS1 group was higher than that of in 
control 1 group broilers (P < 0.05). Both the gene and protein expression levels 
of HSP70, TLR4 and NF-κB in the liver were significantly enhanced by heat 
stress. Furthermore, heat stress obviously enhanced the expression of IL-6, 
TNF-α, NF-κB P65, IκB and their phosphorylated proteins in the livers of 
broilers. In addition, heat stress promoted the activation of NLRP3 with 
increased NLRP3, caspase-1 and IL-1β levels.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggested that heat stress can cause liver 
inflammation via activation of the TLR4-NF-κB and NLRP3 signaling pathways in 
broilers. With the extension of heat stress time, the effect of heat stress on 
the increase of NF-κB and NLRP3 signaling pathways tended to slow down.

BACKGROUND: Alpha-mannosidosis is a rare autosomal recessive lysosomal storage 
disorder (LSD) caused by reduced activity of alpha-mannosidase. Clinical 
manifestations include skeletal dysmorphism, mental impairment, hearing loss and 
recurrent infections. The severe type of the disease leads to early childhood 
death, while patients with milder forms can live into adulthood. There are no 
mortality studies to date. This study aimed to investigate the age at death and 
the causes of death of patients with alpha-mannosidosis who had not received 
disease-modifying treatment.
METHODS: Clinicians and LSD patient organisations (POs) from 33 countries were 
invited to complete a questionnaire between April-May 2021. Cause of death and 
age at death was available for 15 patients. A literature review identified seven 
deceased patients that met the inclusion criteria.
RESULTS: Median age at death for patients reported by clinicians/POs was 
45 years (mean 40.3 ± 13.2, range 18-56, n = 15); 53% were female. One death 
occurred during the patient's second decade of life, and 14 out of 15 deaths 
(93.3%) during or after the patients' third decade, including four (26.7%) 
during their sixth decade. Median age at death for patients identified from the 
literature was 4.3 years (mean 15.7 ± 17.0, range 2.2-41, n = 7); two were 
female. Four of the seven patients (57.1%) died within the first decade of life. 
Seven of 15 deaths (46.7%) reported by clinicians/POs were recorded as pneumonia 
and three (20.0%) as cancer. Other causes of death included acute renal failure 
due to sepsis after intestinal perforation, decrease of red blood cells of 
unknown origin, kidney failure with systemic lupus erythematosus, aortic valve 
insufficiency leading to heart failure, and dehydration due to catatonia. Three 
out of seven causes of death (42.9%) reported in the literature were associated 
with septicaemia, two (28.6%) with respiratory failure and one to pneumonia 
following aspiration.
CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that pneumonia has been the primary cause of 
death during recent decades in untreated patients with alpha-mannosidosis, 
followed by cancer. Determining the causes of mortality and life expectancy in 
these patients is crucial to further improve our understanding of the natural 
history of alpha-mannosidosis.

Political Science, London, UK.

OBJECTIVES: to assess the effect of recent stalling of life expectancy and 
various scenarios for disability progression on projections of social care 
expenditure between 2018 and 2038, and the likelihood of reaching the Ageing 
Society Grand Challenge mission of five extra healthy, independent years at 
birth.
DESIGN: two linked projections models: the Population Ageing and Care Simulation 
(PACSim) model and the Care Policy and Evaluation Centre long-term care 
projections model, updated to include 2018-based population projections.
POPULATION: PACSim: about 303,589 individuals aged 35 years and over (a 1% 
random sample of the England population in 2014) created from three nationally 
representative longitudinal ageing studies.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Total social care expenditure (public and private) for 
older people, and men and women's independent life expectancy at age 65 
(IndLE65) under five scenarios of changing disability progression and recovery 
with and without lower life expectancy.
RESULTS: between 2018 and 2038, total care expenditure was projected to increase 
by 94.1%-1.25% of GDP; men's IndLE65 increasing by 14.7% (range 11.3-16.5%), 
exceeding the 8% equivalent of the increase in five healthy, independent years 
at birth, although women's IndLE65 increased by only 4.7% (range 3.2-5.8%). A 
10% reduction in disability progression and increase in recovery resulted in the 
lowest increase in total care expenditure and increases in both men's and 
women's IndLE65 exceeding 8%.
CONCLUSIONS: interventions that slow down disability progression, and improve 
recovery, could significantly reduce social care expenditure and meet government 
targets for increases in healthy, independent years.

INTRODUCTION: With the increase in life expectancy and consequent aging of the 
population, degenerative lumbar spine diseases tend to increase its number 
exponentially. Several treatment options are available to treat degenerative 
spinal diseases, such as laminectomies, posterior fusions, and interbody 
fusions, depending on their locations, correction necessities, and surgeon 
philosophy. With the advance in technology and surgical knowledge, minimally 
invasive techniques (MIS) arose as a solution to reduce surgical morbidity, 
while maintaining the same benefits as the traditionally/open surgeries. Several 
studies investigated the possible advantages of MIS techniques against the 
traditional open procedures. However, those articles are usually focused only on 
one technique or on one pathology.
METHODS: The electronic databases, including PubMed, Google Scholar, Ovid, and 
BVS, were systematically reviewed. Only original articles in English or 
Portuguese were added to the review, the revision was performed following the 
PRISMA guideline.
RESULTS: Fifty-three studies were included in the meta-analysis. Of the studied 
outcomes the Length of Stay Odds of complications, Blood Loss, and Surgery costs 
presented significantly favored MIS approaches, while the Last FUP ODI score, 
and Surgery Time did not differ among the groups.
CONCLUSION: Minimally invasive techniques are a remarkably interesting option to 
traditional open surgeries, as these procedures showed a significant reduction 
in blood loss, hospitalization time, complications, and surgical costs.
