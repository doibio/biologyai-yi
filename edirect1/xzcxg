complicates fILD and is associated with impaired functional capability, lower 
physical activity, and significantly reduced life expectancy. There is no proven 
treatment for patients with fILD-PH. We report results from the first cohort of 
a phase 2b/3 trial with pulsed inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) in patients with 
fILD-PH.
METHODS: Subjects in cohort 1 were randomized to iNO 30 μg/kg ideal body 
weight/h (iNO30) or placebo for 8 weeks of blinded treatment; subjects then 
transitioned to open-label extension (OLE) on iNO30 followed by dose escalation 
to iNO45 then iNO75. Activity monitoring was used to assess changes in daily 
activity. Safety and efficacy were evaluated.
RESULTS: Twenty-three patients were randomized to iNO30 and 18 to placebo. 
During blinded treatment, iNO30 subjects showed an average improvement in 
moderate/vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and remained stable in overall 
activity. Placebo subjects showed an average drop of 26% in MVPA and a 12% drop 
in overall activity. The iNO group had an improvement in oxygen saturation. 
During OLE, subjects maintained their activity levels including placebo subjects 
who transitioned from a decline to a maintenance in all activity parameters. 
Inhaled nitric oxide at all doses (30, 45, and 75) was safe and well tolerated.
CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with iNO30 demonstrated clinically and statistically 
significant benefit in MVPA and clinically significant benefit in overall 
activity. In the OLE, higher doses of iNO were also safe and well tolerated 
while showing maintenance in activity parameters.

OBJECTIVE: In stable neuromuscular patients under long-term non-invasive 
ventilation (NIV), subjective sleep quality may be predicted by chronic 
hypoventilation, as assessed by base excess (BE), and %N3 sleep stage duration. 
In this study, we explored how other variables, closely associated with 
self-reported health complaints, contributed to subjective sleep quality in 
adult patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD).
METHODS: This is a secondary analysis of a quality of life study in 48 adult DMD 
patients under NIV therapy, with little evidence of residual hypoventilation. 
Subjective sleep quality was evaluated by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index 
(PSQI). A PSQI score >5 was considered indicative of poor sleep quality. Several 
other symptoms were evaluated: sleepiness, by the Epworth Sleepiness Scale 
(ESS); depression and anxiety, by the anxiety and depression subscales of the 
Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS-A and HADS-D); autonomic symptoms, 
by the Composite Autonomic Symptom Score 31; pain, by the Numeric Pain Rating 
Scale (NPRS); and fatigue, by the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS).
RESULTS: Mean PSQI was 6.1 ± 2.9. Abnormal scores were found for NPRS in 40, for 
HADS-A in 10 and for FSS in 24 subjects. The NPRS, HADS-A and FSS scores and the 
N3 sleep stage, independently predicted PSQI (R2 = 0.47, p < 0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: In adult DMD patients, pain, fatigue and anxiety may have a 
prominent influence on subjective sleep quality. Improvement of sleep quality 
may be of utmost importance in DMD, as it may ameliorate quality of life and 
extend its benefits to cardiovascular morbidity and life expectancy.

The increase in the life expectancy of patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC) 
in the last decade is due to changes that have occurred in the area of 
preclinical studies. Understanding cancer pathophysiology and the emergence of 
new therapeutic options, including immunotherapy, would not be possible without 
proper research. Before new approaches to disease treatment are developed and 
introduced into clinical practice they must be preceded by preclinical tests, in 
which animal studies play a significant role. This review describes the progress 
in animal model development in kidney cancer research starting from the oldest 
syngeneic or chemically-induced models, through genetically modified mice, 
finally to xenograft, especially patient-derived, avatar and humanized mouse 
models. As there are a number of subtypes of RCC, our aim is to help to choose 
the right animal model for a particular kidney cancer subtype. The data on 
genetic backgrounds, biochemical parameters, histology, different stages of 
carcinogenesis and metastasis in various animal models of RCC as well as their 
translational relevance are summarized. Moreover, we shed some light on imaging 
methods, which can help define tumor microstructure, assist in the analysis of 
its metabolic changes and track metastasis development.

Objectives　This study aimed to determine risk factors for frailty and 
lifestyle-related diseases impacting the incidence of loss of independence among 
Japanese community-dwelling older adults, and to measure the magnitude of these 
associations.Methods　We conducted an 8.1-year prospective study involving 1,214 
residents of the town of Kusatsu, aged 65 years and over, who were initially 
free of disability and underwent the comprehensive geriatric assessment between 
2002 and 2011. Loss of independence was defined as the incidence of disability 
or having died before the occurrence of disability was certified by the 
Long-Term Care Insurance program in Japan. Risk factors for lifestyle-related 
diseases and health status comprised hypertension, diabetes mellitus, 
overweight, chronic kidney disease, current smoking, past history of stroke, 
heart disease and cancer, frailty, underweight, anemia, hypoalbuminemia, and 
cognitive decline. Frailty was defined as the presence of three or more of the 
following criteria: Weight loss, weakness, exhaustion, slowness, and low levels 
of physical activity. Prefrailty was defined as the presence of one or two of 
these same criteria. Cox proportional-hazard regression model was used to 
estimate hazard ratios (HR) and the population attributable fraction (PAF) of 
loss of independence.Results　During the follow-up, 475 cases, including 372 
disabilities and 103 deaths, were identified as having experienced loss of 
independence. The multivariable HRs for the loss of independence were 1.3 to 
2.2-fold higher for the presence of frailty, past history of stroke, cognitive 
decline, prefrailty, and smoking. The PAF of loss of independence was the 
greatest for prefrailty (19%), followed by frailty (12%). The PAF was relatively 
large for prefrailty (19%) and smoking (11%) in men, and frailty (18%), 
prefrailty (18%), and chronic kidney disease (11%) in women. Stratified by age 
category, participants aged 65-74 years having frailty and several 
lifestyle-related diseases showed significantly higher HRs for loss of 
independence and greater PAFs for prefrailty (18%), frailty (13%), and smoking 
(11%).Conclusions　Loss of independence among Japanese community-dwelling older 
adults who underwent screening examinations was largely attributed to frailty 
and prefrailty. Our findings suggest that the screening and the intervention for 
frailty and lifestyle-related diseases in the early stages of old age might be 
beneficial in prolonging healthy life expectancy of Japanese community-dwelling 
older adults.

BACKGROUND: Thanks to the advances in care, pregnancy is now attainable for the 
majority of young female CKD patients, although it is still a high-risk 
endeavor. Clinical decision-making in these cases is impacted by a myriad of 
factors, making (pre)pregnancy counseling a complex process. The complexities, 
further impacted by limited data and unknown risks regarding outcome, can cause 
discussions when deciding on the best care for a specific patient.
OBJECTIVES: In this article, we provide an overview of the considerations and 
dilemmas we encounter in preconception counseling and offer our perspective on 
how to deal with them in daily clinical practice.
METHODS: The main topics we discuss in our counseling are (1) the high risk of 
pregnancy complications, (2) the risk of permanent CKD deterioration due to 
pregnancy and subsequent decreased life expectancy, (3) appropriate changes in 
renal medication, and (4) assisted reproduction, genetic testing, and prenatal 
or preimplantation genetic diagnostics.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: In our clinic, we openly address moral dilemmas arising 
in clinical practice in pregnancy and CKD, both within the physician team and 
with the patient. We do this by ensuring an interpretive physician-patient 
interaction and shared decision-making, deliberating in a multidisciplinary 
setting and, if needed, with input from an expert committee.

BACKGROUND: Randomized trials have shown that initiating breast cancer screening 
between ages 50 and 69 years and continuing it for 10 years decreases breast 
cancer mortality. However, no trials have studied whether or when women can 
safely stop screening mammography. An estimated 52% of women aged 75 years or 
older undergo screening mammography in the United States.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate the effect of breast cancer screening on breast cancer 
mortality in Medicare beneficiaries aged 70 to 84 years.
DESIGN: Large-scale, population-based, observational study of 2 screening 
strategies: continuing annual mammography, and stopping screening.
SETTING: U.S. Medicare program, 2000 to 2008.
PARTICIPANTS: 1 058 013 beneficiaries aged 70 to 84 years who had a life 
expectancy of at least 10 years, had no previous breast cancer diagnosis, and 
underwent screening mammography.
MEASUREMENTS: Eight-year breast cancer mortality, incidence, and treatments, 
plus the positive predictive value of screening mammography by age group.
RESULTS: In women aged 70 to 74 years, the estimated difference in 8-year risk 
for breast cancer death between continuing and stopping screening was -1.0 (95% 
CI, -2.3 to 0.1) death per 1000 women (hazard ratio, 0.78 [CI, 0.63 to 0.95]) (a 
negative risk difference favors continuing). In those aged 75 to 84 years, the 
corresponding risk difference was 0.07 (CI, -0.93 to 1.3) death per 1000 women 
(hazard ratio, 1.00 [CI, 0.83 to 1.19]).
LIMITATIONS: The available Medicare data permit only 8 years of follow-up after 
screening. As with any study using observational data, the estimates could be 
affected by residual confounding.
CONCLUSION: Continuing annual breast cancer screening past age 75 years did not 
result in substantial reductions in 8-year breast cancer mortality compared with 
stopping screening.

Extra Virgin Olive Oil Polyphenols: Modulation of Cellular Pathways Related to 
Oxidant Species and Inflammation in Aging.

Serreli G(1), Deiana M(1).

Cagliari, Italy.

The olive-oil-centered Mediterranean diet has been associated with extended life 
expectancy and a reduction in the risk of age-related degenerative diseases. 
Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) itself has been proposed to promote a "successful 
aging", being able to virtually modulate all the features of the aging process, 
because of its great monounsaturated fatty acids content and its minor bioactive 
compounds, the polyphenols above all. Polyphenols are mostly antioxidant and 
anti-inflammatory compounds, able to modulate abnormal cellular signaling 
induced by pro-inflammatory stimuli and oxidative stress, as that related to 
NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf-2) and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of 
activated B cells (NF-κB), which have been identified as important modulators of 
age-related disorders and aging itself. This review summarizes existing 
literature about the interaction between EVOO polyphenols and NF-κB and Nrf-2 
signaling pathways. Reported studies show the ability of EVOO phenolics, mainly 
hydroxytyrosol and tyrosol, to activate Nrf-2 signaling, inducing a cellular 
defense response and to prevent NF-κB activation, thus suppressing the induction 
of a pro-inflammatory phenotype. Literature data, although not exhaustive, 
indicate as a whole that EVOO polyphenols may significantly help to modulate the 
aging process, so tightly connected to oxidative stress and chronic 
inflammation.

The increase in life expectancy and the increasing prevalence of diabetic 
disease and venous insufficiency lead to the increase of chronic wounds. The 
prevalence of ulcers ranges from 1% in the adult population to 3-5% in the over 
65 years population, with 3-5.5% of the total healthcare expenditure, as 
recently estimated. The aim of this work was the design and the development of 
electrospun scaffolds, entirely based on biopolymers, loaded with 
montmorillonite (MMT) or halloysite (HNT) and intended for skin reparation and 
regeneration, as a 3D substrate mimicking the dermal ECM. The scaffolds were 
manufactured by means of electrospinning and were characterized for their 
chemico-physical and preclinical properties. The scaffolds proved to possess the 
capability to enhance fibroblast cells attachment and proliferation with 
negligible proinflammatory activity. The capability to facilitate the cell 
adhesion is probably due to their unique 3D structure which are assisting cell 
homing and would facilitate wound healing in vivo.

Limited studies quantified the age, period, and cohort effects attributable to 
different risk factors on mortality rates (MRs) and disability-adjusted life 
years (DALYs) due to breast cancer among Chinese women. We used data from the 
Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD) in 2017. Mixed-effect and hierarchical 
age-period-cohort (HAPC) models were used to assess explicit and implicit 
fluctuations in MRs and DALYs attributable to different breast cancer associated 
risk factors. As the only risk factor, high body mass index (HBMI) showed 
continuously increasing trends in MRs and DALYs across ages, periods, and 
cohorts. Age, recent periods (2010-2015), and risk factor HBMI showed 
significant positive effect on MRs and DALYs (p < 0.05). Moreover, we reported 
significant interaction effects of older age and period in recent years in 
addition to the interplay of older age and risk factor HBMI on MRs and DALYs. 
Increased age and obesity contribute to substantially raised breast cancer MRs 
and DALYs in China and around the globe. These discoveries shed light on 
protective health policies and provision of healthy lifestyle for improving the 
subsequent breast cancer morbidity and mortality for China, as well as other 
related Asian regions that are presently facing the same public health 
challenges.

BACKGROUND: Injuries and resulting stiffness around joints, especially the 
elbow, have huge psychological effects by reducing quality of life through 
interference with normal daily activities such as feeding, dressing, grooming, 
and reaching for objects. Over the last several years and through numerous 
research results, the myofibroblast-mast cell-neuropeptide axis of fibrosis had 
been implicated in post-traumatic joint contractures. Pre-clinical models and a 
pilot randomized clinical trial (RCT) demonstrated the feasibility and safety of 
using Ketotifen Fumarate (KF), a mast cell stabilizer to prevent elbow joint 
contractures. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of KF in reducing joint 
contracture severity in adult participants with operately treated elbow 
fractures and/or dislocations.
METHODS/DESIGN: A Phase III randomized, controlled, double-blinded multicentre 
trial with 3 parallel groups (KF 2 mg or 5 mg or lactose placebo twice daily 
orally for 6 weeks). The study population consist of adults who are at least 
18 years old and within 7 days of injury. The types of injuries are distal 
humerus (AO/OTA type 13) and/or proximal ulna and/or proximal radius fractures 
(AO/OTA type 2 U1 and/or 2R1) and/or elbow dislocations (open fractures with or 
without nerve injury may be included). A stratified randomization scheme by 
hospital site will be used to assign eligible participants to the groups in a 
1:1:1 ratio. The primary outcome is change in elbow flexion-extension range of 
motion (ROM) arc from baseline to 12 weeks post-randomization. The secondary 
outcomes are changes in ROM from baseline to 6, 24 & 52 weeks, PROMs at 2, 6, 
12, 24 & 52 weeks and impact of KF on safety including serious adverse events 
and fracture healing. Descriptive analysis for all outcomes will be reported and 
ANCOVA be used to evaluate the efficacy KF over lactose placebo with respect to 
the improvement in ROM.
DISCUSSION: The results of this study will provide evidence for the use of KF in 
reducing post-traumatic joint contractures and improving quality of life after 
joint injuries.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: This study was prospectively registered (July 10, 2018) with 
ClinicalTrials.gov reference: NCT03582176.

BACKGROUND: The oral health of Indigenous children in remote communities is much 
worse than other population groups in Australia. Providing and maintaining an 
oral health service is challenging due to the remoteness of communities, the 
associated high cost, and the low retention of clinical staff. An annual 
preventive intervention delivered by fly-in clinicians may be a more 
cost-effective way to manage this problem. In this analysis we estimate the 
cost-effectiveness of an annual professional intervention for the prevention of 
dental caries in children of a remote Indigenous community in Far North 
Queensland.
METHODS: A cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted based on an annual 
preventive intervention protocol. This included treating all dental decay in 
those with disease, applying fissure sealants, a disinfectant swab, fluoride 
varnish and providing oral hygiene instructions and dietary advice to all 
participating school children. This study included an intervention group and a 
natural comparison group and both groups were followed-up for 2 years after the 
initial preventive intervention. A Markov model was built to assess the 
cost-effectiveness of the intervention compared with the usual care. Costs of 
treatment from the Queensland Department of Health were used and effectiveness 
was measured as quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) with the CHU-9D. One-way and 
probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted to identify key drivers and 
quantify uncertainty.
RESULTS: The preventive intervention was found to be highly cost-effective. The 
incremental cost per QALY gained was AU$3747. Probability of new caries and 
seeking treatment were identified as the main drivers of the model. In 
probabilistic sensitivity analysis intervention was cost effective in 100% of 
simulations.
CONCLUSION: An annual preventive intervention for remote Indigenous communities 
in Australia is a highly cost-effective strategy to prevent dental caries and 
improve the quality of life of children.

As people live longer, ages at death are becoming more similar. This dual 
advance over the last two centuries, a central aim of public health policies, is 
a major achievement of modern civilization. Some recent exceptions to the joint 
rise of life expectancy and life span equality, however, make it difficult to 
determine the underlying causes of this relationship. Here, we develop a 
unifying framework to study life expectancy and life span equality over time, 
relying on concepts about the pace and shape of aging. We study the dynamic 
relationship between life expectancy and life span equality with reliable data 
from the Human Mortality Database for 49 countries and regions with emphasis on 
the long time series from Sweden. Our results demonstrate that both changes in 
life expectancy and life span equality are weighted totals of rates of progress 
in reducing mortality. This finding holds for three different measures of the 
variability of life spans. The weights evolve over time and indicate the ages at 
which reductions in mortality increase life expectancy and life span equality: 
the more progress at the youngest ages, the tighter the relationship. The link 
between life expectancy and life span equality is especially strong when life 
expectancy is less than 70 y. In recent decades, life expectancy and life span 
equality have occasionally moved in opposite directions due to larger 
improvements in mortality at older ages or a slowdown in declines in midlife 
mortality. Saving lives at ages below life expectancy is the key to increasing 
both life expectancy and life span equality.

BACKGROUND: Uncorrected congenital heart lesions in children keep them in a 
state of constant hypoxia with compromised quality of life and reduced life 
expectancy. This requires early diagnosis and interventions including prevention 
and treatment of the resultant anaemia. Unfortunately, congenital heart disease 
(CHD) often goes unrecognized and thus untreated.
OBJECTIVES: We determined the occurrence of CHD in children below 15 years at 
the Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital (KATH), assessed the prevalence of relative 
iron deficiency anaemia in that cohort and the use of iron supplementation in 
these patients.
METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study, using a structured data 
collection tool, by retrospectively reviewing patient records from December 2015 
to January 2010. Data was also obtained prospectively from January 2016 to March 
2016.
RESULTS: Eighty cases (44 females and 36 males) of CHD were encountered. 
Tetralogy of Fallot was the most common (48.8%) CHD. Cases of cyanotic 
congenital heart disease were reported at autopsy. Of the 80 cases, 48 (72.7%) 
had signs of relative iron deficiency. Thirty (62.5%) of the 48 patients did not 
receive iron supplementation. In 14 cases, full blood count was not determined 
and yet 10 patients received iron at sub-optimal doses (<3 mg/kg/day) and one 
was given iron at 6 mg/kg/day.
CONCLUSION: CHD is a common phenomenon among newborns at KATH. Use of iron 
supplementation was suboptimal. Compliance with guidelines on the use of iron as 
well as structures for early detection of CHD for definitive interventions are 
advocated.

Extrauterine growth restriction (EUGR) is a frequent morbidity of preterm 
infants that can affect short- and long-term prognosis as it involves different 
EUGR-related alterations in growth and neurological development, as well as 
cardiometabolic risk. However, knowledge about the prognosis of EUGR is scarce. 
Thus, the objective of this study is to review the evidence regarding 
EUGR-related comorbidities in childhood by a systematic approach. This review 
was carried out using the Joanna Briggs Institute Reviewers' Manual Methodology 
and the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and 
Meta-Analyses)-Search Extension for scoping review. The MEDLINE and EMBASE 
databases were used to identify papers published until September 2017. 
Twenty-four publications were included and 19 examined cohort studies. EUGR is 
mainly associated with (1) lower weight, length, and head circumference measures 
in childhood; (2) poor neurodevelopment; and (3) alterations in cardiometabolic 
risk markers. The definition for EUGR and the populations studied differ among 
authors.Conclusion: EUGR is mainly associated with poor growth and 
neurodevelopment, as well as with cardiometabolic alterations in childhood. 
Evidence is based on observational studies with variability in the included 
populations due to the lack of consensus regarding the definition for EUGR. 
Finding a gold standard definition becomes paramount in order to select 
phenotypes at risk later in life. What is known? • EUGR is a frequent condition 
of preterm infants. Up to date little is known about the effect of the metabolic 
programming on prognosis. What is new? • The available evidence, which is based 
on observational studies with variability in the population and the existing 
different definitions for EUGR, do not enable appropriate data collection. EUGR 
is mainly associated with poor growth and neurodevelopment, as well as with 
cardiometabolic alterations in childhood.

Direct-acting antiviral drugs (DAAs) have recently changed the paradigm of 
hepatitis C therapy, significantly improving treatment response rates, patient 
life expectancy and quality of life. In Portugal, sofosbuvir (SOF) and 
SOF/ledipasvir (SOF/LDV) were fully reimbursed by the National Health System 
since early 2015 and generalized use of interferon-free DAA based regimens 
became current practice. During 2016, the remaining DAAs were sequentially added 
and covered by the same health access policy. The Portuguese Study Group of 
Hepatitis and HIV Co-infection (GEPCOI) collected data from 15 clinical centres 
in Portugal, pertaining to the HCV treatment experience with DAA regimens. A 
cohort of 2133 patients was analysed, representing one of the largest DAA 
treated HCV/HIV co-infected individuals. The global sustained virologic response 
(SVR) achieved was 95% in this real-life cohort setting. Linear regression 
analysis showed significant differences in treatment response rates when using 
SOF plus ribavirin (RBV) combination in genotype 2 or 3 infected individuals 
(P < .002) and in those with liver cirrhosis (P < .002). These findings 
corroborate that early treatment is mandatory in HIV/HCV co-infected patients, 
as response rates may be negatively influenced by higher fibrosis stages and 
suboptimal DAA regimens. The current national Portuguese health policy should 
continue to promote wider treatment access and individualized therapy 
strategies, aiming at the elimination of HCV infection in this high-risk 
co-infected population.

Objective: In people living with HIV (PLWH), antiretroviral treatments have 
increased the median life expectancy. Raltegravir (RAL) represents 
a long-term safe regimen used both in the first-line antiretroviral treatments 
and in the optimization strategies. Aim of the study was to evaluate the 
real-life efficacy, tolerability, and safety of the long-term RAL use in 
a multicenter cohort of elderly PLWH.Methods: A 60-month follow-up observational 
study was carried out in the RAL-AGE Cohort including aged PLWH (≥60 years old) 
treated with RAL-based regimens (n = 96). The control group was a cohort of PLWH 
aged less than 60 years (n = 50).Results: RAL treated aged HIV population 
experiences an increase of CD4+ cells and a stable control of viral load at 
60 months of follow-up. A significant improvement in lipid metabolism profile, 
a decrease of platelet count and a reduction in cardiovascular risk levels were 
observed in the older population. Immune activation markers expressed 
on CD4+ T cells decreased compared to baseline, but this difference was greater 
in the control group.Conclusion: A 60-month treatment with 
RAL-containing regimens is safe and highly effective in the older PLWH and these 
data give new insights on the elderly population.Clinical trial registration: 
NCT02765776 and NCT03579485.

OBJECTIVE: In this study, we quantified the global macroeconomic burden of 
breast cancer to underscore the critical importance of improving access to 
oncologic surgical care internationally.
SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Breast cancer mortality in many low and middle-income 
countries (LMICs) is dramatically higher than in high-income countries. Prior to 
identifying solutions, however, it is important to first define the burden of 
disease.
METHODS: Data from the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation (2005-2015) 
were used to assess epidemiologic trends for 194, middle, and low-income 
countries. Economic burden defined by Welfare Loss (WL) was calculated by 
measuring disability-adjusted-life-years lost to breast cancer alongside the 
dollar equivalent of a value of statistical life year and as a function of each 
country's gross domestic product (GDP).
RESULTS: Annual mortality rates among breast cancer patients were significantly 
greater in LMICs in South Asia (3.06 per 100 women) and Sub-Saharan Africa (2.76 
per 100 women), compared with high-income countries like the United States (1.69 
per 100 women). From 2005-2015, mortality in South Asia increased by 8.20% and 
decreased by 6.45% in Sub-Saharan Africa; mortality rates in 2015 were observed 
as 27.9 per 100,000 in South Asia and 18.61 per 100,000 in Sub-Saharan Africa. 
Countries in South Asia demonstrated the greatest rise in WL due to breast 
cancer, from 0.05% to 0.08% of GDP.
CONCLUSIONS: The burden of disease and economic impact of breast cancer is 
intensifying in LMICs. Global efforts to improve access to surgical care for 
women with breast cancer could reduce mortality and mitigate the social and 
financial impact of this disease in LMICs.

STUDY DESIGN: Economic modeling of data from a multicenter, prospective 
registry.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to analyze the cost utility of recombinant 
human bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP) in adult spinal deformity (ASD) 
surgery.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: ASD surgery is expensive and presents risk of major 
complications. BMP is frequently used off-label to reduce the risk of 
pseudarthrosis.
METHODS: Of 522 ASD patients with fusion of five or more spinal levels, 367 
(70%) had at least 2-year follow-up. Total direct cost was calculated by adding 
direct costs of the index surgery and any subsequent reoperations or 
readmissions. Cumulative quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained were 
calculated from the change in preoperative to final follow-up SF-6D health 
utility score. A decision-analysis model comparing BMP versus no-BMP was 
developed with pseudarthrosis as the primary outcome. Costs and benefits were 
discounted at 3%. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was performed using mixed 
first-order and second-order Monte Carlo simulations. One-way sensitivity 
analyses were performed by varying cost, probability, and QALY estimates 
(Alpha = 0.05).
RESULTS: BMP was used in the index surgery for 267 patients (73%). The mean 
(±standard deviation) direct cost of BMP for the index surgery was 
$14,000 ± $6400. Forty patients (11%) underwent revision surgery for symptomatic 
pseudarthrosis (BMP group, 8.6%; no-BMP group, 17%; P = 0.022). The mean 2-year 
direct cost was significantly higher for patients with pseudarthrosis 
($138,000 ± $17,000) than for patients without pseudarthrosis 
($61,000 ± $25,000) (P < 0.001). Simulation analysis revealed that BMP was 
associated with positive incremental utility in 67% of patients and considered 
favorable at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $150,000/QALY in >52% of 
patients.
CONCLUSION: BMP use was associated with reduction in revisions for symptomatic 
pseudarthrosis in ASD surgery. Cost-utility analysis suggests that BMP use may 
be favored in ASD surgery; however, this determination requires further 
research.

Hospital, Taichung City, Taiwan.

BACKGROUND: Free ileocolon flap is a reliable technique allowing simultaneous 
restoration of swallowing and speech. The aim is to report our 6-year experience 
in a single center.
METHODS: Thirty-seven patients treated between 2010 and 2015 were included in 
the study. Swallowing and speech function were evaluated in 27 patients with a 
7-point and 5-point Likert scale, respectively. Moreover, 12 of them consented 
to voice spectrum analysis (VSA).
RESULTS: Complications noted were: aspiration (3), esophagocutaneous fistula 
(2), and stricture (1). Seven patients experienced self-limited diarrhea. 
Regarding swallowing function, 77.8% scored ≥5 on Likert scale whereas speech 
Likert scale showed excellent results (score >12) in 74%. VSA demonstrated mean 
phonation time of 10.75 seconds, mean frequency of 131 Hz and mean dynamic range 
of 56 dB.
CONCLUSION: In experienced hands, the ileocolon flap is safe and effective, 
particularly in patients with long-life expectancy, providing good swallowing
