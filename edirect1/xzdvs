INTRODUCTION: The results of multiple studies indicate the negative impact of 
exposure to air pollution on human life expectancy. Epidemiological evidence on 
this relation is in large proportion provided by ecological studies, what causes 
interpretation difficulties. Poland is a country characterized by large 
territorial differences in ambient air pollution and in life expectancy. This 
promotes analyses of the mentioned relationship based on ecological model.
AIM: The aim of the study was to analyse the results of a simple ecological 
study concerning the relationship between life expectancy and air pollution with 
the focus on the difficulties in interpretation of the results.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study used a simple ecological study approach. We used 
the official data on sex-specific life expectancy for year 2018 and annual 
average ambient air concentrations of PM2.5 in years 2010-2018 for 10 large 
metropolitan areas in Poland. The data was used as a marker of long-term air 
pollution levels in particular areas. Associations between life expectancy and 
air pollution levels were assessed using Spearman correlation analysis.
RESULTS: The analysis concerning exposure to air pollution and life-expectancy 
in several Polish large agglomerations did not show statistically significant 
associations.
CONCLUSIONS: Our ecological study did not show statistically significant 
associations between life expectancy and ambient air pollution levels measured 
by means of PM2.5 concentrations. Ecological nature of the population's exposure 
marker, without considering many important factors influencing length of life, 
may explain the negative results of the correlation analysis. This is an example 
of so called ecological fallacy, affecting the used model of epidemiological 
study.

OBJECTIVES: Web-based interventions for the promotion of maternal mental health 
could represent a cost-effective strategy to reduce the burden associated with 
perinatal mental illness. This study aimed to evaluate the cost-utility of Be a 
Mom, a self-guided web-based cognitive behavioral therapy intervention, compared 
with a waiting-list control.
METHODS: The economic evaluation alongside a randomized controlled trial was 
conducted from a societal perspective over a 14-month time frame. Postpartum 
women presenting low risk for postpartum depression were randomized to the 
intervention (n = 191) or control (n = 176) group and assessed at baseline, 
postintervention and 4 and 12 months after postintervention. Data regarding 
healthcare use, productive losses and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were 
collected and used to calculate incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). 
Uncertainty was accounted for with nonparametric bootstrapping and sensitivity 
analyses.
RESULTS: At 14 months, and after accounting for a 3.5 percent discount rate, the 
intervention resulted in a yearly cost-saving of EUR 165.47 (-361.77, 28.51) and 
a QALY gain of 0.0064 (-0.0116, 0.0244). Bootstrapping results revealed a 
dominant ICER for the intervention group. Although results were statistically 
nonsignificant, cost-effectiveness acceptability curves showed that at a EUR 0 
willingness to pay threshold, there is a 96 percent probability that the 
intervention is cost-effective when compared with the control group. The 
sensitivity analyses generally supported the acceptable likelihood of the 
intervention being more cost-effective than the control group.
CONCLUSIONS: From a societal perspective, the implementation of Be a Mom among 
low-risk postpartum women could be a cost-effective way to improve perinatal 
mental health.

BACKGROUND: Alcoholic cardiomyopathy (ACM) remains a significant public health 
issue with a growing global burden. The burden of ACM in China and different 
regions remains poorly understood.
METHODS: Data on ACM deaths, disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), the 
corresponding global age-standardized death rate (ASDR), age-standardized DALY 
rate and estimated annual percentage change (EAPC) were analysed based on age, 
sex, socio-demographic index (SDI) quintiles, different regions and in China 
from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study 2019.
RESULTS: Globally, the death rate and DALYs due to ACM were 71 723 and 2 441 108 
in 2019, 33.06% and 38.79% increase from 1990, respectively. The corresponding 
ASDR and age-standardized DALY rate decreased with EAPC of -1.52 (95% 
uncertainty interval (UI) = -2.39, -0.65) and -1.12 (95% UI = -2.14, -0.10). The 
high-middle SDI regions, especially Eastern Europe, showed the highest number of 
ACM-related deaths and DALYs. The ACM-related deaths and DALYs were 2545 and 
87823 in China in 2019, 171.03% and 147.17% increase from 1990, respectively. 
Unlike the world level, ASDR and age-standardized DALY rate also increased in 
China. The ACM burden is higher in men, and people with 50 to 69 years old 
accounted for the most.
CONCLUSIONS: ACM burden in China and across the world increased substantially 
from 1990 to 2019. The greatest burden was borne by the high-middle SDI regions, 
especially by men aged 50-69 years old. Geographically and gender-age tailored 
strategies were needed to prevent ACM.

BACKGROUND: The EXCEL trial (Evaluation of XIENCE Versus Coronary Artery Bypass 
Surgery for Effectiveness of Left Main Revascularization) demonstrated in 
patients with left main coronary artery disease, no significant difference 
between coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) and percutaneous coronary 
intervention (PCI) with everolimus-eluting stents for the composite end point of 
death, stroke, or myocardial infarction at 5 years. However, all-cause mortality 
at 5 years was higher with PCI. Long-term cost-effectiveness of these 2 
strategies has heretofore not been evaluated.
METHODS: From 2010 to 2014, 1905 patients with left main coronary artery disease 
were randomized to CABG (n=957) or PCI (n=948). Costs ($2019) were assessed over 
5 years using resource-based costing and Medicare reimbursement rates. Health 
utilities were assessed using the EuroQOL 5-dimension questionnaire. Five-year 
EXCEL data in combination with US lifetables were used to develop a Markov model 
to evaluate lifetime cost-effectiveness. An incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
<$50 000 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained was considered highly 
cost-effective.
RESULTS: Index revascularization procedure costs were $4,850/patient higher with 
CABG, and total costs for the index hospitalization were $17 610/patient higher 
with CABG ($32 297 versus $19 687, P<0.001). Cumulative 5-year costs were 
$20 449/patient higher with CABG. CABG was projected to increase lifetime costs 
by $21 551 while increasing quality-adjusted life expectancy by 0.49 QALYs, 
yielding an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $44 235/QALY. In a post hoc 
sensitivity analysis using mortality hazard ratios from a meta-analysis of all 
randomized CABG versus PCI in left main disease trials, the gain associated with 
CABG was 0.08 to 0.14 QALYs, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio of $139 775 to $232 710/QALY gained.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on data from the EXCEL trial, CABG is an economically 
attractive revascularization strategy compared with PCI over a lifetime horizon 
for patients with significant left main coronary artery disease. However, this 
conclusion is sensitive to the long-term mortality rates with the 2 strategies, 
and CABG is no longer highly cost-effective when substituting the pooled 
treatment effect from the 4 major PCI versus CABG trials for left main disease.

BACKGROUND: Digital technologies could contribute to health promotion and 
disease prevention. It is unclear if and how such digital technologies address 
the health needs of older people in nonclinical settings (ie, daily life).
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to identify digital technologies for health promotion 
and disease prevention that target the needs of older people in nonclinical 
settings by performing a scoping review of the published literature. The scoping 
review is guided by the framework of Arksey and O'Malley.
METHODS: Our scoping review follows the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items 
for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews) 
guidelines. The information sources are bibliographic databases (MEDLINE, 
PsycINFO, CINAHL, and SCOPUS) and bibliographies of any included systematic 
reviews. Manual searches for additional studies will be performed in Google 
Scholar and most relevant journals. The electronic search strategy was developed 
in collaboration with a librarian who performed the search for studies on 
digital technologies for health promotion and disease prevention targeting the 
needs of older people. Study selection and data coding will be performed 
independently by 2 authors. Consensus will be reached by discussion. Eligibility 
is based on the PCC (Population, Concept, and Context) criteria as follows: (1) 
older people (population); (2) any digital (health) technology, such as 
websites, smartphone apps, or wearables (concept); and (3) health promotion and 
disease prevention in nonclinical (daily life, home, or community) settings 
(context). Primary studies with any design or reviews with a systematic 
methodology published in peer-reviewed academic journals will be included. Data 
items will address study designs, PCC criteria, benefits or barriers related to 
digital technology use by older people, and evidence gaps. Data will be 
synthesized using descriptive statistics or narratively described by identifying 
common themes. Quality appraisal will be performed for any included systematic 
reviews, using a validated instrument for this study type (A Measurement Tool to 
Assess Systematic Reviews, version 2 [AMSTAR2]).
RESULTS: Following preliminary literature searches to test and calibrate the 
search syntax, the electronic literature search was performed in March 2022 and 
manual searches were completed in June 2022. Study selection based on titles and 
abstracts was completed in July 2022, and the full-text screen was initiated in 
July 2022.
CONCLUSIONS: Our scoping review will identify the types of digital technologies, 
health targets in the context of health promotion and disease prevention, and 
health benefits or barriers associated with the use of such technologies for 
older people in nonclinical settings. This knowledge could guide further 
research on how digital technologies can support healthy aging.

BACKGROUND: Treatment-resistant schizophrenia (TRS) comes with significant 
medical comorbidities, including heart disease, liver disease, and diabetes-all 
of which contribute to higher mortality rates and shortened life expectancy. 
Second-generation antipsychotic medications do not consistently alleviate 
psychotic symptoms, especially among patients with TRS. Clozapine, the gold 
standard of pharmacological treatment for TRS, offers only partial relief for 
many patients. Additional treatment approaches, which include cognitive 
behavioral therapy (CBT), are often necessary.
PURPOSE: The aim of this integrative review was to assess the efficacy of CBT as 
an adjunctive treatment for TRS in various study populations.
METHODS: The Johns Hopkins Nursing Evidence-Based Practice Model and Guidelines 
were used to guide the review. A literature search of PubMed, CINAHL, Scopus, 
and PsycInfo was conducted, and a total of 66 articles were identified. Strong 
inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied to ensure that only high-quality 
studies were included for analysis.
RESULTS: Of the eight studies that met the eligibility criteria, five indicated 
that CBT has statistically significant efficacy in reducing positive psychotic 
symptoms of TRS. There was also evidence that in implementing CBT, a follow-up 
period of at least six months helps to sustain improvements.
CONCLUSIONS: CBT can be a safe and effective adjunctive treatment for patients 
with this illness. We recommend that nurses who work in psychiatric settings, 
EDs, and home health or community care settings obtain training in CBT.

Analysis of the genes retained in the minimized Mycoplasma JCVI-Syn3A genome 
established that systems that repair or preempt metabolite damage are essential 
to life. Several genes known to have such functions were identified and 
experimentally validated, including 5-formyltetrahydrofolate cycloligase, 
coenzyme A (CoA) disulfide reductase, and certain hydrolases. Furthermore, we 
discovered that an enigmatic YqeK hydrolase domain fused to NadD has a novel 
proofreading function in NAD synthesis and could double as a MutT-like 
sanitizing enzyme for the nucleotide pool. Finally, we combined metabolomics and 
cheminformatics approaches to extend the core metabolic map of JCVI-Syn3A to 
include promiscuous enzymatic reactions and spontaneous side reactions. This 
extension revealed that several key metabolite damage control systems remain to 
be identified in JCVI-Syn3A, such as that for methylglyoxal. IMPORTANCE 
Metabolite damage and repair mechanisms are being increasingly recognized. We 
present here compelling genetic and biochemical evidence for the universal 
importance of these mechanisms by demonstrating that stripping a genome down to 
its barest essentials leaves metabolite damage control systems in place. 
Furthermore, our metabolomic and cheminformatic results point to the existence 
of a network of metabolite damage and damage control reactions that extends far 
beyond the corners of it that have been characterized so far. In sum, there can 
be little room left to doubt that metabolite damage and the systems that counter 
it are mainstream metabolic processes that cannot be separated from life itself.

Practical management of older adults with cancer: geriatric oncology in Japan.

Mizutani T(1).

Author information:
(1)Department of Medical Oncology, Kyorin University Faculty of Medicine, Japan.

Japan has the highest proportion of older adults globally, and the average life 
expectancy of the Japanese population has increased in recent decades. Given 
that the incidence of cancer increases with age, it is a major health concern 
for older adults. However, geriatric oncology is a relatively new field and 
collaboration between oncologists and geriatricians in Japan is limited. Hence, 
oncologists and other healthcare professionals engaged in cancer care have not 
been able to adequately understand geriatric care, and information and 
experience are insufficient for this specific population. Thus, they may 
struggle with the assessment and management of older adults with cancer. 
Recently, several Japanese academic societies for cancer have developed 
practical guidelines and research policy with regard to geriatric research in 
older adults with cancer, in addition to organizing symposia and workshops 
focusing especially on geriatric oncology. Furthermore, because the Japan 
Geriatrics Society established a discipline committee on cancer, close 
collaboration between oncologists and geriatricians has grown steadily. 
Geriatric oncology is currently recognized as an important field of cancer care 
in Japan. The integration of oncology and geriatric care is anticipated in the 
near future. However, understanding the aspects of geriatric care and meanings 
of technical jargons used in geriatric oncology is difficult. Accordingly, this 
article provides an overview of the current knowledge and recent advancements in 
geriatric oncology. In addition, it outlines the current status and problems of 
geriatric oncology in Japan.

D-VITylation: Harnessing the biology of vitamin D to improve the pharmacokinetic 
properties of peptides and small proteins.

Peptides have great potential to be potent and specific therapeutics, yet their 
small size leads to rapid glomerular filtration, which severely limits 
therapeutic applications. Although conjugation of small proteins to large 
polymers typically results in longer residence times, these conjugates often 
have a significant loss of biological activity due to steric hindrance. Here, we 
improve the pharmacokinetics (PK) of peptide therapeutics by harnessing the 
biology of vitamin D. Attachment of a small vitamin D-based molecule 
(D-VITylation) protects the conjugated peptide or protein from renal clearance 
by virtue of reversible binding to the serum-circulating vitamin D binding 
protein (DBP), without compromising bioactivity. Varying the conjugation site on 
vitamin D affects the binding to DBP, with higher affinity corresponding to a 
longer plasma half-life. We also demonstrate the important contribution of the 
peptide to the overall PK, likely due to alternative clearance mechanisms such 
as protease degradation and receptor-mediated cellular uptake. With a Fab 
antibody fragment, for which these alternate clearance mechanisms are not 
significant, D-VITylation increases the half-life of elimination from 14 to 61 h 
in rats. The PK profile in minipigs and projected lifetime in humans suggest 
that D-VITylation is a viable strategy to achieve once-weekly dosing of peptide 
therapeutics in humans.

BACKGROUND: Patients with severe mental illness (SMI) have a shorter life 
expectancy and have been considered by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a 
vulnerable group. As the causes for this mortality gap are complex, 
clarification regarding the contributing factors is crucial to improving the 
health care of SMI patients. Acute appendicitis is one of the most common 
indications for emergency surgery worldwide. A higher perforation rate has been 
found among psychiatric patients. This study aims to evaluate the differences in 
appendiceal perforation rate, emergency department (ED) management, in-hospital 
outcomes, and in-hospital expenditure among acute appendicitis patients with or 
without SMI via the use of a multi-centre database.
METHODS: Relying on Chang Gung Research Database (CGRD) for data, we selectively 
used its data from January 1st, 2007 to December 31st, 2017. The diagnoses of 
acute appendicitis and SMI were confirmed by combining ICD codes with relevant 
medical records. A non-SMI patient group was matched at the ratio of 1:3 by 
using the Greedy algorithm. The outcomes were appendiceal perforation rate, ED 
treatment, in-hospital outcome, and in-hospital expenditure.
RESULTS: A total of 25,766 patients from seven hospitals over a span of 11 years 
were recruited; among them, 11,513 were excluded by criteria, with 14,253 
patients left for analysis. SMI group was older (50.5 vs. 44.4 years, p < 0.01) 
and had a higher percentage of females (56.5 vs. 44.4%, p = 0.01) and Charlson 
Comorbidity Index. An analysis of the matched group has revealed that the SMI 
group has a higher unscheduled 72-hour revisit to ED (17.9 vs. 10.4%, p = 0.01). 
There was no significant difference in appendiceal perforation rate, ED 
treatment, in-hospital outcome, and in-hospital expenditure.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated no obvious differences in appendiceal 
perforation rate, ED management, in-hospital outcomes, and in-hospital 
expenditure among SMI and non-SMI patients with acute appendicitis. A higher 
unscheduled 72-hour ED revisit rate prior to the diagnosis of acute appendicitis 
in the SMI group was found. ED health providers need to be cautious when it 
comes to SMI patients with vague symptoms or unspecified abdominal complaints.

In this study, high-throughput sequencing (HTS) was used to compare and analyze 
the microbial diversity and succession during the brewing process of xiaoqu 
Baijiu. A total of 34 phyla and 378 genera of bacteria, as well as four phyla, 
32 genera of fungi were detected. At the phylum level, Firmicutes, 
Proteobacteria, Ascomycota, and Mucoromycota were the dominant groups. During 
the brewing process of xiaoqu Baijiu, the dominant bacteria were Weissella and 
unidentified Rickettsiales within the first 2 days of brewing, followed by 
Lactobacillus at 3 days until to the end of brewing. The dominant fungi were 
Rhizopus, Saccharomyces, and Issatchenkia. The relative abundance of Rhizopus 
decreased with the extension of brewing time, while the relative abundance of 
Saccharomyces increased, and Saccharomyces became the dominant species at the 
second day of brewing. This study revealed the diversity and changes of the 
microbial community during the brewing process of xiaoqu Baijiu, providing 
theoretical support and laying a foundation for future study on the contribution 
of microbial metabolism during brewing of xiaoqu Baijiu, thereby promoting the 
development of xiaoqu Baijiu industry.

Reduced Insulin/IGF-like signaling (IIS) plays an evolutionarily conserved role 
in improving longevity and some measures of health-span in model organisms. 
Recent studies, however, have found a disconnection between lifespan extension 
and behavioral health-span. We have previously shown that reduction of IIS in 
Drosophila neurons extends female lifespan but does not improve negative 
geotaxis senescence and has a detrimental effect on exploratory walking 
senescence in both sexes. We hypothesize that individual neuronal subtypes 
respond differently to IIS changes, thus the behavioral outcomes of pan-neuronal 
IIS reduction are the balance of positive, negative and neutral functional 
effects. In order to further understand how reduced IIS in neurons independently 
modulates lifespan and locomotor behavioral senescence we expressed a dominant 
negative Insulin receptor transgene selectively in individual neuronal subtypes 
and measured the effects on lifespan and two measures of locomotor senescence, 
negative geotaxis and exploratory walking. IIS reduction in cholinergic, 
GABAergic, dopaminergic, glutamatergic, and octopaminergic neurons was found to 
have either no affect or a detrimental effect on lifespan and locomotor 
senescence. However, reduction of IIS selectively in serotonergic neurons 
resulted in extension of lifespan in females with no effect on locomotor 
senescence. These data indicate that individual neuronal subtypes respond 
differently to IIS changes in the modulation of lifespan and locomotor 
senescence, and identify a specific role for the insulin receptor in 
serotonergic neurons in the modulation of lifespan.

Life expectancy has long been associated with macro-level factors, including 
health expenditures, but little research has focused on the relationship with 
morbidity measures. This paper examines the relationship between the expected 
years lived free of and with chronic conditions (YLFCC and YLCC) at age 50 and 
macroeconomic and social factors including, for the first time, several 
indicators of public health expenditure. We calculate YLFCC and YLCC for Spanish 
regions using the Sullivan method over a long period of time (2006-2019). Spain 
is a good case study due to two reasons. First, its national health system is 
decentralized among regional administrations since 2002. Second, the financial 
crisis of 2008 led to public health cuts in 2010-2014 that each region handled 
differently. We use fixed-effects models to assess the relationship between 
changes in macro-level regional indicators (socioeconomic factors, healthcare 
resources, health behavior and public health expenditures) with YLFCC and YLCC 
across regions and over time. Results show that socioeconomic levels, public 
health expenditure, healthcare resources and health behaviors are associated 
with years lived free of and with chronic conditions when analyzing them 
independently. However, in the global model including all these dimensions only 
public health expenditure is associated with both YLFCC and YLCC for men and 
women, showing that a higher level of expenditures is correlated with more YLFCC 
and less YLCC. Therefore, regional authorities need to pay special attention to 
the level of investments on health services, as they are clearly associated with 
a better quality of living of the middle age and older population.

INTRODUCTION: Physical activity is proven to be a significant element of 
successful aging, but many seniors worldwide fail to achieve the recommended 
levels. This study aimed to assess the readiness of the community in Nur-Sultan, 
Kazakhstan, to act on the issue of physical inactivity among older adults.
METHODS: In order to achieve this purpose, we conducted qualitative interviews 
with key informants in the community and applied a validated community readiness 
tool.
RESULTS: The results suggest that the local community is at early stages of 
readiness to act on the issue of older adult physical inactivity. We identified 
a number of barriers that prevented seniors from leading active lifestyles, 
which included community misconceptions about older adult physical activity, 
family centeredness in older adulthood, scarcity of resources, passive support 
from the leadership, and lack of efforts in the community. Research findings 
also highlighted the importance of conducting in-depth analysis of key informant 
responses in addition to calculating readiness scores, when using the community 
readiness tool.
CONCLUSIONS: Community-specific strategies for enhancing the level of physical 
activity among seniors are required to offset the disease burden associated with 
aging and to prolong life expectancy in Kazakhstan, and it is of paramount 
importance to tailor potential efforts as to address the current readiness of 
the community and its needs.

OBJECTIVES: The mutual influence between end-of-life cancer patients and their 
family caregivers is widely endorsed. The present study aimed to explore the 
relationship between end-of-life cancer patients' dignity-related distress and 
the distress of their caregivers.
METHOD: A cross-sectional approach was used. The sample consisted of 128 
patients with a Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) below 50 and a life 
expectancy of a few weeks, and their family caregivers. Personal and clinical 
data were collected and validated rating scales were administered: Patient 
Dignity Inventory (PDI) to terminal cancer patients; Hospital Anxiety and 
Depression Scale (HADS), Demoralization Scale (DS), Herth Hope Index (HHI), 
Caregiver Reaction Assessment (CRA), Short Form Health Survey 36 (SF-36), and 
Distress Thermometer (DT) to caregivers.
RESULTS: Findings highlighted significant correlations between patients' scores 
on the Psychological Distress PDI subscale and the PDI Total Score and 
caregivers' Emotional Role. Patients' Psychological Distress, PDI Total Score, 
and Loss of Purpose and Meaning were associated with caregivers' Disrupted 
Schedule. Finally, patients' Physical Symptoms and Dependency, Loss of Purpose 
and Meaning, and PDI Total Score were correlated with caregivers' 
Disheartenment.
SIGNIFICANCE OF RESULTS: The results highlighted the key role of dignity as a 
relational dimension during the end-of-life phase. Therefore, because of 
caregivers' distress could affect patients' dignity-related distress by 
influencing the interpersonal aspects of patients' autonomy, it would be 
important to relieve caregivers' distress in order to promote patients' autonomy 
and minimize their fear of being a burden.

The appeal of multiscale modeling approaches is predicated on the promise of 
combinatorial synergy. However, this promise can only be realized when distinct 
scales are combined with reciprocal consistency. Here, we consider multiscale 
molecular dynamics (MD) simulations that combine the accuracy and macromolecular 
flexibility accessible to fixed-charge all-atom (AA) representations with the 
sampling speed accessible to reductive, coarse-grained (CG) representations. 
AA-to-CG conversions are relatively straightforward because deterministic 
routines with unique outcomes are achievable. Conversely, CG-to-AA conversions 
have many solutions due to a surge in the number of degrees of freedom. While 
automated tools for biomolecular CG-to-AA transformation exist, we find that one 
popular option, called Backward, is prone to stochastic failure and the AA 
models that it does generate frequently have compromised protein structure and 
incorrect stereochemistry. Although these shortcomings can likely be 
circumvented by human intervention in isolated instances, automated multiscale 
coupling requires reliable and robust scale conversion. Here, we detail an 
extension to Multiscale Machine-learned Modeling Infrastructure (MuMMI), 
including an improved CG-to-AA conversion tool called sinceCG. This tool is 
reliable (∼98% weakly correlated repeat success rate), automatable (no 
unrecoverable hangs), and yields AA models that generally preserve protein 
secondary structure and maintain correct stereochemistry. We describe how the 
MuMMI framework identifies CG system configurations of interest, converts them 
to AA representations, and simulates them at the AA scale while on-the-fly 
analyses provide feedback to update CG parameters. Application to systems 
containing the peripheral membrane protein RAS and proximal components of RAF 
kinase on complex eight-component lipid bilayers with ∼1.5 million atoms is 
discussed in the context of MuMMI.

The effects of hexythiazox on life-history traits and demographic parameters of 
Tetranychus urticae Koch (Acari: Tetranychidae) were evaluated using the 
age-stage two-sex life table (in fecundity-based and fertility-based variants), 
with emphasis on its transovarial toxicity. Hexythiazox was applied when T. 
urticae females were either in the preovipositional period or in the first day 
of oviposition. In the F0 generation bioassay, treatments with concentrations of 
50, 12.5 and 3.125 mg/l significantly reduced the longevity of females and their 
fecundity. These effects were mostly the result of mortality of treated females 
(18-23%) over the 24-h exposure period. Even though the net reproductive rate 
(R0) decreased significantly, the intrinsic rate of increase (r), finite rate of 
increase (λ) and doubling time (D) were not significantly different from the 
control. The strongest transovarial toxic effect occurred within the first 4 
days following treatment, when 52-89% of the eggs laid by treated females (96% 
in control) hatched. Fertility was significantly reduced by concentrations of 
50, 12.5, 3.125, 0.781 and 0.195 mg/l. These concentrations caused significant 
reductions in R0 (34-54%), r (12-24%) and λ (3-5%), whereas D was extended for 
0.4-0.7 days. In the F1 generation bioassay, 50, 12.5, 3.125, 0.781, 0.049 and 
0.012 mg/l caused significant reductions in R0 (34-92%), r (10-68%) and λ 
(3-17%), whereas extending D for 0.3-5.6 days. These effects were mostly the 
consequence of transovarial toxicity. Application of the fecundity-based life 
table underestimated population-level effects of hexythiazox on T. urticae.

OBJECTIVES: To estimate the change to health service costs and health benefits 
from a decision to adopt temporary isolation rooms that are effective at 
isolating the patient within a general ward environment. We assess the 
cost-effectiveness of a decision to adopt an existing temporary isolation room 
in a Singapore setting.
METHOD: We performed a model-based cost-effectiveness analysis to evaluate the 
impact of a decision to adopt temporary isolation rooms for infection 
prevention. We estimated changes to the costs from implementation, the number of 
cases of healthcare associated infection, acute care bed days used, they money 
value of bed days, the number of deaths, and the expected change to life years. 
We report the probability that adoption was cost-effective by the cost by life 
year gained, against a relevant threshold. Uncertainty is addressed with 
probabilistic sensitivity analysis and the findings are tested with plausible 
scenarios for the effectiveness of the intervention.
RESULTS: We predict 478 fewer cases of HAI per 100,000 occupied bed days from a 
decision to adopt temporary isolation rooms. This will result in cost savings of 
$SGD329,432 and there are 1,754 life years gained. When the effectiveness of the 
intervention is set at 1% of cases of HAI prevented the incremental cost per 
life year saved is $16,519; below the threshold chosen for cost-effectiveness in 
Singapore.
CONCLUSIONS: We provide some evidence that adoption of a temporary isolation 
room is cost-effective for Singapore acute care hospitals. It is plausible that 
adoption is a positive decision for other countries in the region who may 
demonstrate fewer resources for infection prevention and control.

The importance of elders: Extending Hamilton's force of selection to include 
intergenerational transfers.

In classical evolutionary models, the force of natural selection diminishes with 
age toward zero by last reproduction. However, intergenerational resource 
transfers and other late-life contributions in social species may select for 
postreproductive longevity. We present a formal framework for estimating 
indirect fitness contributions via production transfers in a skills-intensive 
foraging niche, reflecting kinship and cooperation among group members. Among 
contemporary human hunter-gatherers and horticulturalists, indirect fitness 
contributions from transfers exceed direct reproductive contributions from 
before menopause until ages when surpluses end, around the modal age of adult 
death (∼70 y). Under reasonable assumptions, these benefits are the equivalent 
to having up to several more offspring after age 50. Despite early independence, 
minimal production surplus, and a shorter lifespan, chimpanzees could 
theoretically make indirect contributions if they adopted reliable food-sharing 
practices. Our results for chimpanzees hypothetically adopting hunter-gatherer 
subsistence suggest that a skills-intensive foraging ecology with late 
independence and late peak production could select for human-like life histories 
via positive feedback between longevity and late-life transfers. In contrast, 
life history changes preceding subsistence shifts would not favor further life 
extension or subsistence shifts. Our results formalize the theory that longevity 
can be favored under socioecological conditions characterized by parental and 
alloparental care funded through transfers of mid- to late-life production 
surpluses. We also extend our analysis beyond food transfers to illustrate the 
potential for indirect fitness contributions from pedagogy, or information 
transfers. While we focus mostly on humans, our approach is adaptable to any 
context or species where transfers can affect fitness.
