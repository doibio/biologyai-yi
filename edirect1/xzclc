177Lu-DOTATATE. The indirect treatment comparison that our economic analysis was 
based on was of a simple Bucher type, unadjusted for any differences in the 
baseline characteristics across the two trials.
CONCLUSIONS: Given NICE's current stated range of £20,000-30,000 per QALY for 
the cost-effectiveness threshold, based on list prices, only sunitinib might be 
considered good value for money in England and Wales.
FUTURE WORK: Further analysis of individual patient data from RADIANT-3 would 
allow assessment of the robustness of our findings. The data were not made 
available to us by the company sponsoring the trial.

OBJECTIVES: To assess how often older adults admitted to hospital for common 
non-cardiac conditions were discharged with intensified antihypertensive 
treatment, and to identify markers of appropriateness for these 
intensifications.
DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.
SETTING: US Veterans Administration Health System.
PARTICIPANTS: Patients aged 65 years or over with hypertension admitted to 
hospital with non-cardiac conditions between 2011 and 2013.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Intensification of antihypertensive treatment, defined as 
receiving a new or higher dose antihypertensive agent at discharge compared with 
drugs used before admission. Hierarchical logistic regression analyses were used 
to control for characteristics of patients and hospitals.
RESULTS: Among 14 915 older adults (median age 76, interquartile range 69-84), 
9636 (65%) had well controlled outpatient blood pressure before hospital 
admission. Overall, 2074 (14%) patients were discharged with intensified 
antihypertensive treatment, more than half of whom (1082) had well controlled 
blood pressure before admission. After adjustment for potential confounders, 
elevated inpatient blood pressure was strongly associated with being discharged 
on intensified antihypertensive regimens. Among patients with previously well 
controlled outpatient blood pressure, 8% (95% confidence interval 7% to 9%) of 
patients without elevated inpatient blood pressure, 24% (21% to 26%) of patients 
with moderately elevated inpatient blood pressure, and 40% (34% to 46%) of 
patients with severely elevated inpatient blood pressure were discharged with 
intensified antihypertensive regimens. No differences were seen in rates of 
intensification among patients least likely to benefit from tight blood pressure 
control (limited life expectancy, dementia, or metastatic malignancy), nor in 
those most likely to benefit (history of myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular 
disease, or renal disease).
CONCLUSIONS: One in seven older adults admitted to hospital for common 
non-cardiac conditions were discharged with intensified antihypertensive 
treatment. More than half of intensifications occurred in patients with 
previously well controlled outpatient blood pressure. More attention is needed 
to reduce potentially harmful overtreatment of blood pressure as older adults 
transition from hospital to home.

The octomeric exocyst complex governs the final step of exocytosis in both 
plants and animals. Its roles, however, extend beyond exocytosis and include 
organelle biogenesis, ciliogenesis, cell migration, and cell growth. Exo70 is a 
conserved component of the exocyst whose function in Drosophila is unclear. In 
this study, we characterized two mutant alleles of Drosophila exo70. exo70 
mutants exhibit reduced synaptic growth, locomotor activity, glutamate receptor 
density, and mEPSP amplitude. We found that presynaptic Exo70 is necessary for 
normal synaptic growth at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ). At the neuromuscular 
junction, exo70 genetically interacts with the small GTPase ralA to regulate 
synaptic growth. Loss of Exo70 leads to the blockage of JNK signaling-, 
activity-, and temperature-induced synaptic outgrowths. We showed that this 
phenotype is associated with an impairment of integral membrane protein 
transport to the cell surface at synaptic terminals. In octopaminergic motor 
neurons, Exo70 is detected in synaptic varicosities, as well as the regions of 
membrane extensions in response to activity stimulation. Strikingly, mild 
thermal stress causes severe neurite outgrowth defects and pharate adult 
lethality in exo70 mutants. exo70 mutants also display defective locomotor 
activity in response to starvation stress. These results demonstrated that Exo70 
is an important regulator of induced synaptic growth and is crucial for an 
organism's adaptation to environmental changes.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The 
exocyst complex is a conserved protein complex directing secretory vesicles to 
the site of membrane fusion during exocytosis, which is essential for 
transporting proteins and membranes to the cell surface. Exo70 is a subunit of 
the exocyst complex whose roles in neurons remain elusive, and its function in 
Drosophila is unclear. In Drosophila, Exo70 is expressed in both glutamatergic 
and octopaminergic neurons, and presynaptic Exo70 regulates synaptic outgrowth. 
Moreover, exo70 mutants have impaired integral membrane transport to the cell 
surface at synaptic terminals and block several kinds of induced synaptic 
growth. Remarkably, elevated temperature causes severe arborization defects and 
lethality in exo70 mutants, thus underpinning the importance of Exo70 functions 
in development and adaptation to the environment.

OBJECTIVE: To compare the expected quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) in adult 
patients undergoing immediate vs deferred antiepileptic drug (AED) treatment 
after a first unprovoked seizure.
METHODS: We constructed a simulated clinical trial (Markov decision model) to 
compare immediate vs deferred AED treatment after a first unprovoked seizure in 
adults. Three base cases were considered, representing patients with varying 
degrees of seizure recurrence risk and effect of seizures on quality of life 
(QOL). Cohort simulation was performed to determine which treatment strategy 
would maximize the patient's expected QALYs. Sensitivity analyses were guided by 
clinical data to define decision thresholds across plausible measurement ranges, 
including seizure recurrence rate, effect of seizure recurrence on QOL, and 
efficacy of AEDs.
RESULTS: For patients with a moderate risk of recurrent seizures (52.0% over 10 
years after first seizure), immediate AED treatment maximized QALYs compared to 
deferred treatment. Sensitivity analyses showed that for the preferred choice to 
change to deferred AED treatment, key clinical measures needed to reach 
implausible values were 10-year seizure recurrence rate ≤38.0%, QOL reduction 
with recurrent seizures ≤0.06, and efficacy of AEDs on lowering seizure 
recurrence rate ≤16.3%.
CONCLUSION: Our model determined that immediate AED treatment is preferable to 
deferred treatment in adult first-seizure patients over a wide and clinically 
relevant range of variables. Furthermore, our analysis suggests that the 10-year 
seizure recurrence rate that justifies AED treatment (38.0%) is substantially 
lower than the 60% threshold used in the current definition of epilepsy.

Glutaredoxins (Grx) are small proteins conserved throughout all the kingdoms of 
life that are engaged in a wide variety of biological processes and share a 
common thioredoxin-fold. Among them, class II Grx are redox-inactive proteins 
involved in iron-sulfur (FeS) metabolism. They contain a single thiol group in 
their active site and use low molecular mass thiols such as glutathione as 
ligand for binding FeS-clusters. In this study, we investigated molecular 
aspects of 1CGrx1 from the pathogenic parasite Trypanosoma brucei brucei, a 
mitochondrial class II Grx that fulfills an indispensable role in vivo. 
Mitochondrial 1CGrx1 from trypanosomes differs from orthologues in several 
features including the presence of a parasite-specific N-terminal extension 
(NTE) whose role has yet to be elucidated. Previously we have solved the 
structure of a truncated form of 1CGrx1 containing only the conserved 
glutaredoxin domain but lacking the NTE. Our aim here is to investigate the 
effect of the NTE on the conformation of the protein. We therefore solved the 
NMR structure of the full-length protein, which reveals subtle but significant 
differences with the structure of the NTE-less form. By means of different 
experimental approaches, the NTE proved to be intrinsically disordered and not 
involved in the non-redox dependent protein dimerization, as previously 
suggested. Interestingly, the portion comprising residues 65-76 of the NTE 
modulates the conformational dynamics of the glutathione-binding pocket, which 
may play a role in iron-sulfur cluster assembly and delivery. Furthermore, we 
disclosed that the class II-strictly conserved loop that precedes the active 
site is critical for stabilizing the protein structure. So far, this represents 
the first communication of a Grx containing an intrinsically disordered region 
that defines a new protein subgroup within class II Grx.

BACKGROUND: Inclusion cell disease (I-cell) is a rare autosomal recessive 
metabolic disease involving multiple organ systems, associated with a severely 
restricted life expectancy. No curative therapy is currently available, with 
management aimed at symptom palliation.
METHODS: We present a retrospective, single-centre, case series of children 
referred to a tertiary paediatric metabolic service. The clinical presentation, 
demographics, genetics and natural history of the condition are investigated.
RESULTS: Five patients with I-cell disease were referred over a 10-year period. 
All patients were born with dysmorphic features and had a family history of 
I-cell disease on further exploration. Phenotypic variation was seen within 
patients with the same genetic profile. Airway problems were common with 100% of 
the documented sleep oximetry studies suggesting sleep-disordered breathing. Of 
the two patients who had tracheal intubation anaesthetic difficulties we 
encountered, one required intraoperative reintubation, and one suffered a failed 
intubation with subsequent death. All five patients required oxygen therapy with 
the use of CPAP and BiPAP also seen. Feeding issues were almost universal with 
four of the five patients requiring nasogastric feeding. Four patients had died 
in the 10-year period with a mean life expectancy of 36 months. Cause of death 
for three of the four patients was respiratory failure.
CONCLUSIONS: Airway problems, including sleep-disordered breathing, were 
ubiquitous in this cohort of children. Any intervention requiring a general 
anaesthetic needs careful multidisciplinary consideration due to significant 
associated risks and possibly death. Management as a result is generally 
non-surgical and symptomatic. This case series demonstrates universal 
involvement of the airway and respiratory systems, an important consideration 
when selecting meaningful outcomes for future effectiveness studies of novel 
therapies.

Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a complex genetic disorder characterised by a set 
of phenotypic traits, which include infantile hypotonia, short stature, and 
morbid obesity. Over the last 12 years, visible progress has been made in 
medical care management of PWS patients in Poland. Increasing awareness of the 
disorder in neonatal and paediatric care has led to early identification of the 
condition in neonates, followed by the institution of an appropriate dietary 
regime, introduction of physiotherapy, and early-onset recombinant human growth 
hormone (rhGH) treatment. Growth hormone (GH) therapy in Poland is conducted 
within the nationwide framework of the Therapeutic Programme: "Treatment of 
Prader-Willi Syndrome". The therapeutic interventions initiated in the 
paediatric centres need to be continued in multidisciplinary adult care 
settings. The main aim of PWS clinical management in adulthood is prevention of 
obesity and its comor-bidities, treatment of hormonal disorders, mental health 
stabilisation, nutritional guidance, as well as on-going physiotherapy. 
Integrated multidisciplinary therapeutic intervention is necessary if patients 
with such a complex genetic condition as PWS are to not only achieve an average 
life expectancy but also to enjoy higher quality of life.

Background Treatment options in oncology have increased in recent years due to 
the quick pace of innovation. In the cancer care landscape, therapies that 
enable patients to live to the next innovation have additional value, "option 
value," from the benefit of surviving to the next innovation. In such disease 
areas, providers and payers should consider this value when gauging the value of 
new therapies. The purpose of this study is to develop a model to estimate the 
additional survival patients attain from a therapy that allows them to live to 
benefit from further advances in care, and to apply the model to immunotherapy 
for metastatic melanoma. Methods The benefit of a therapy extends beyond 
immediate tumor control; it can also allow patients to live to benefit from 
further advances in care. This is a therapy's option value. Using data from the 
SEER cancer registry and clinical trial publications, we developed a model to 
estimate option value and applied it to ipilimumab, the first immune checkpoint 
modulator used to treat metastatic melanoma. Because ipilimumab extends 
survival, select patients benefited from survival extension to live to benefit 
from the introduction of PD-1 inhibitors (i.e. pembrolizumab and nivolumab). We 
calculated the option value of ipilimumab in terms of additional life-months 
patients gained by living to become potential candidates for PD-1 inhibitors, 
discounting at 3% per year. Results Patients taking ipilimumab as a second-line 
therapy for metastatic melanoma gained 10.5 months compared to patients taking 
the prior standard of care. Patients diagnosed in 2011, 2012, and 2013 gained an 
additional 1.6, 2.8, and 5.1 months of life expectancy, respectively, by living 
to see the introduction of PD-1 inhibitors. This equates to an option value of 
15%, 27%, and 49%, respectively, of the conventionally calculated survival gain 
from ipilimumab. Ipilimumab had greater option value for patients diagnosed in 
later years who were more likely to live to the introduction of PD-1 inhibitors. 
Conclusions Therapies that enable patients to see further advances in care have 
option value. Option value is particularly important to patients with disease 
areas undergoing rapid innovation.

OBJECTIVE: Patients with metastatic bone lesions have a limited life expectancy. 
These metastatic lesions compromise the proximal femur, and fractures are quite 
common. The survival of these patients depends on the behavior of the primary 
tumor. The aim of this study was to evaluate the quality of life of patients 
with extensive metastatic lesion of the proximal femur with pathological or 
imminent fracture, treated with non-conventional endoprosthesis.
METHODS: From May 2008 to August 2012, twenty-five (25) patients with bone 
metastases of the proximal femur, with pathological or imminent fracture were 
recruited into this study. These patients had survived for at least six weeks 
after surgery and the TESS questionnaire (Toronto Extremity Salvage Score) was 
administered.
RESULTS: The final score of the TESS was an average of 57 points (SD 23.78 
points). There was no significant difference in TESS values considering: sex, 
presence of fracture, or site of the bone lesion.
CONCLUSION: The TESS questionnaire provides information about the function and 
quality of life of patients with malignant tumors of the lower limbs, from the 
patient's perspective. The results can be considered positive, when compared to 
the limited life expectancy and complexity of this group of patients. Level of 
evidence III, Therapeutic studies, retrospective comparative study.

Publisher: OBJETIVO: Pacientes com lesões ósseas metastáticas têm expectativa de 
vida limitada. Essas lesões metastáticas comprometem a parte proximal do fêmur, 
e as fraturas são bastante comuns. A sobrevida desses pacientes depende do 
comportamento do tumor primário. O objetivo deste estudo é avaliar a qualidade 
de vida de pacientes com lesões metastáticas extensas na parte proximal do fêmur 
com fratura patológica ou iminente, tratados com endopróteses não convencionais.
MÉTODOS: De maio de 2008 a agosto de 2012, vinte e cinco (25) pacientes com 
metástases ósseas da parte proximal do fêmur com fratura patológica ou iminente 
foram recrutados para este estudo. Esses pacientes tinham sobrevida de pelo 
menos seis semanas após a cirurgia e o questionário TESS (Toronto Extremity 
Salvage Score) foi aplicado.
RESULTADOS: O escore final do TESS teve média de 57 pontos (DP de 23,78 pontos). 
Não houve diferença significativa entre os valores do TESS ao se considerar 
sexo, presença de fratura ou localização da lesão óssea.
CONCLUSÃO: O questionário TESS fornece informações sobre a função e a qualidade 
de vida dos pacientes com tumores malignos dos membros inferiores, do ponto de 
vista do paciente. Os resultados obtidos podem ser considerados positivos, 
diante da expectativa de vida limitada e a complexidade desse grupo de 
pacientes. Nível de evidência III, Estudos terapêuticos, Estudo retrospectivo

In the real-world, it is unclear that after the radiofrequency ablation (RFA), 
whether it is a cost-effective strategy to administer nucleotide analogue (NA) 
for patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related HCC patients. The aim of this 
study was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of the RFA plus NA versus RFA alone 
in patients with HBV-related HCC within the Milan criteria in China and the USA. 
A Markov model was developed to simulate a cohort of patients with HCC within 
the Milan criteria and Child-Pugh A/B cirrhosis and underwent RFA with or 
without NA therapy over their remaining life expectancy. Analysis was performed 
in two geographical cost settings: China and the USA. The RFA plus NA therapy 
provided an average of 7.57 years, whereas RFA monotherapy offered 5.83 years. 
The RFA plus NA therapy produced 5.09 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), 
whereas RFA monotherapy achieved 3.89 QALYs. The incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio (ICER) of the RFA plus NA therapy versus RFA monotherapy was 
$10368.19/QALY in China and $38805.45/QALY in the USA. These values were below 
the thresholds of the cost-effectiveness in both countries. Sensitivity analysis 
revealed that the utility of recurrent HCC was the most sensitive parameter in 
all cost scenarios in both of the RFA plus NA therapy and RFA monotherapy 
groups. Our Markov model has shown that for the patients with HBV-related HCC 
within the Milan criteria and Child-Pugh A/B cirrhosis, RFA plus NA is more 
cost-effective than RFA monotherapy across the two different cost scenarios 
namely, China and the USA.

A salivary gland anlage tumour (SGAT) is a very rare type of benign tumour that 
usually presents in early infancy with respiratory distress which is exacerbated 
upon feeding. We report a full-term male neonate who was referred to the Al 
Nahdha Hospital, Muscat, Oman, in 2015 with severe neonatal respiratory distress 
due to a nasopharyngeal obstruction immediately after birth. Computed tomography 
and magnetic resonance imaging revealed a well-circumscribed mass in the 
nasopharynx, without intracranial extension. Histopathological analysis of the 
lesion confirmed a diagnosis of SGAT. Following excision of the tumour, the 
postoperative period was uneventful. No recurrence was observed over the next 
two years. This case report highlights the importance of the early recognition 
of this extremely rare and potentially life-threatening, yet easily curable, 
condition.

Abscess of the iliopsoas muscle is a rare condition that requires a high degree 
of clinical suspicion for diagnosis. High mortality rates highlight the need for 
prompt recognition. We report the case of a 26-year-old man, with a history of 
intravenous drug use, who was referred from an outside facility with sacral 
fracture and gluteal abscess. Sacral trauma occurred 3 weeks before 
presentation, with progressive worsening of buttock pain. The patient was 
treated with irrigation and débridement of the gluteal abscess. Follow-up MRI 
revealed a communicating iliopsoas abscess that initially had been undiagnosed. 
After a prolonged hospital stay requiring additional irrigation and débridement 
procedures, the patient was discharged in a stable condition. Five-month 
follow-up has demonstrated no evidence of recurrence of infection. To our 
knowledge, this is the first reported case of Staphylococcus aureus gluteal 
abscess with pelvic extension into the iliopsoas secondary to sacral trauma and 
intravenous drug use.

The Use of Donation After Circulatory Death Organs for Simultaneous Liver-kidney 
Transplant: To DCD or Not to DCD?

BACKGROUND: Because of the challenges with organ scarcity, many centers 
performing simultaneous liver-kidney transplant (SLKT) are opting to accept 
donation after circulatory death (DCD) organs as a means of facilitating earlier 
transplant and reducing death rates on the waitlist. It has been suggested, 
however, that DCD organs may have inferior graft and patient survival 
posttransplant compared with donation after neurologic death (DND) organs.
METHODS: We created a Markov model to compare the overall outcomes of accepting 
a DCD SLKT now versus waiting for a DND SLKT in patients waitlisted for SLKT, 
stratified by base Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score (≤20, 21-30, 
>30).
RESULTS: Waiting for DND SLKT was the preferred treatment strategy for patients 
with a MELD score of 30 or less (incremental value of 0.54 and 0.36 
quality-adjusted life years for MELD score of 20 or less and MELD score of 21 to 
30 with DND versus DCD SLKT, respectively). The option to accept a DCD SLKT 
became the preferred choice for those with a MELD score greater than 30 
(incremental value of 0.31 quality-adjusted life years for DCD versus DND SLKT). 
This finding was confirmed in a probabilistic sensitivity analysis and persisted 
when analyzing total life years obtained for accept DCD versus do not accept 
DCD.
CONCLUSIONS: There is a benefit to accepting DCD SLKT for patients with MELD 
score greater than 30. Although not accepting DCD SLKT and waiting for DND SLKT 
is the preferred option for patients with MELD of 30 or less, the incremental 
value is small.

133. Global Mortality and Morbidity of HIV/AIDS.

Danforth K, Granich R, Wiedeman D, Baxi S, Padian N.

In: Holmes KK, Bertozzi S, Bloom BR, Jha P, editors. Major Infectious Diseases. 
3rd edition. Washington (DC): The International Bank for Reconstruction and 
Development / The World Bank; 2017 Nov 3. Chapter 2.

The HIV/AIDS epidemic has seen dramatic shifts since the first cases were 
described in 1981. Initially perceived as a disease among gay men or Haitians in 
Western countries, HIV transmission has been reported in virtually all parts of 
the world. Prevalence levels in the 1990s reached more than 30 percent among 
adults in many Sub-Saharan African cities, and no accessible, effective 
treatment was available. Although treatment was available for a limited number 
of people in wealthier settings shortly after the studies on triple therapy in 
1996, mortality nevertheless soared, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa, 
slashing the hard-won gains in life expectancy resulting from social and 
economic development and advances in medical technology and nutrition (United 
Nations Population Division 2004) by more than a decade within a few years. 
Since 2000, remarkable progress has been made in the diagnosis and treatment of 
persons living with HIV/AIDS. With medications now affordable at a cost of 
approximately US$129–$568 per person per year even in the hardest hit countries 
(Bendavid and others 2010; Menzies, Berruti, and Blandford 2012; PEPFAR 2013; 
UNAIDS 2015a; Walensky and others 2013), 17 million people were receiving 
antiretroviral therapy (ART) in 2015. The international targets are to treat 
nearly three-quarters of those living with HIV/AIDS by 2030 (UNAIDS 2012, 2014b, 
2015b, 2016b; WHO 2013c). ART has reduced HIV/AIDS morbidity and mortality 
significantly (Cohen and others 2011; Danel and others 2015; INSIGHT START Study 
Group 2015; Kitahata and others 2009; Lopez-Cortes, Gutierrez-Valencia, and 
Ben-Marzouk-Hidalgo 2016; Lundgren, Babiker, and Neaton 2016; Médecins Sans 
Frontières 2013; Montaner and others 2006; SMART Study Group and others 2006; 
Sterne and others 2009; Violari and others 2008). In high-income countries 
(HICs), access to early treatment has led to near-normal life expectancy for 
persons living with HIV/AIDS (Johnson and others 2013; May and others 2014; 
Rodger and others 2013; Samji and others 2013). As a result, the focus of 
clinical care of HIV/AIDS in these settings has shifted from treatment of a 
usually fatal infectious disease with multiple comorbidities (see chapter 4 
[Harripersaud and others 2017] and chapter 11 [Bloom and others 2017] of this 
volume) to management of a chronic condition and prevention of illness, death, 
and transmission for individuals who remain adherent to treatment (Attia and 
others 2009; Cohen and others 2011; Das and others 2010; Fang and others 2004; 
Montaner and others 2010).

134. The Human Capital and Productivity Benefits of Early Childhood Nutritional 
Interventions.

In: Bundy DAP, Silva ND, Horton S, Jamison DT, Patton GC, editors. Child and 
Adolescent Health and Development. 3rd edition. Washington (DC): The 
International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank; 2017 Nov 
20. Chapter 27.

By 2012, child mortality had fallen to almost half its level in 1990. The next 
major challenge is to improve early-life conditions to harness developmental 
potential. An estimated 200 million children under age five years in low- and 
middle-income countries (LMICs) are unlikely to reach their developmental 
potential because of inadequate health, nutritional, and other investments in 
early life (Grantham-McGregor and others 2007). This inability to achieve full 
potential implies substantial losses of welfare and future economic productivity 
for these children and for their societies (Akresh and others 2012; Behrman, 
Alderman, and Hoddinott 2004; Bhalotra and Venkataramani 2011; Bhutta and others 
2008; Currie and Vogl 2013; Hoddinott and others 2008; Horton, Alderman, and 
Rivera 2009) and increases the risk of adult morbidities and lower life 
expectancy (Bhalotra, Karlsson, and Nilsson 2015; Hjort, Solvesten, and Wust 
2014). This chapter supplements previous work focusing on estimates of economic 
benefits from early-life nutritional interventions in LMICs. Figure 27.1 shows 
the pathways through which early-life interventions can affect later-life 
economic outcomes. Prenatal and early childhood interventions affect outcomes at 
every stage of the lifecycle. These impacts accumulate, making it important to 
study long-term dynamic effects of interventions. Familial and public 
investments enter during all lifecycle stages, often induced by the initial 
intervention. Later investments may in principle complement or substitute for 
those early in the lifecycle, but some evidence suggests they may be reinforcing 
(Almond and Mazumder 2013; Bhalotra and Venkataramani 2011, 2013), consistent 
with recent models that describe human capital production as involving dynamic 
complementarities across types of investment (for example, health and schooling) 
and across ages, such that investments early in life increase rates of return to 
investments later in life (Cunha and Heckman 2007; see also Alderman and others 
2017, chapter 7 in this volume). In the first section, we provide a selected 
review of evidence of long-term human capital and economic benefits from 
early-life interventions and then some illustrative calculations of benefit-cost 
ratios for these interventions. We focus on interventions affecting maternal and 
early childhood health, including micronutrient supplementation and 
breastfeeding, and maternal survival. We then present evidence of effects of 
early interventions on low birth weight (LBW), stunting, and cognitive 
development in the second section. The third section discusses issues in the 
estimation of benefit-cost ratios of early-life interventions and presents 
simulations, illustrating sensitivity of estimates to alternative parameters. 
The fourth section discusses issues of designing policy based on the growing 
body of estimates from randomized trials in LMICs. Definitions of age groupings 
and age-specific terminology used in this volume can be found in chapter 1 
(Bundy and others 2017).

135. Global and Regional Causes of Death: Patterns and Trends, 2000–15.

editors. Disease Control Priorities: Improving Health and Reducing Poverty. 3rd 
edition. Washington (DC): The International Bank for Reconstruction and 
Development / The World Bank; 2017 Nov 27. Chapter 4.

One of the six core functions of the World Health Organization (WHO) is 
monitoring the health situation, trends, and determinants in the world. Global, 
regional, and country statistics on population and health indicators are 
important for assessing progress toward goals for development and health and for 
guiding the allocation of resources. Timely data are needed to monitor progress 
on increasing life expectancy and reducing age- and cause-specific mortality 
rates. In particular, timely data are needed to monitor progress toward reaching 
the health-related targets within the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), 
which will require regular reporting on child mortality; maternal mortality; and 
mortality owing to noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), suicide, air pollution, road 
traffic injuries, homicide, natural disasters, and conflict. This chapter 
summarizes global and regional patterns of causes of death for 2015 and trends 
for 2000–15 using the 2015 Global Health Estimates (GHE 2015) released by the 
WHO at the beginning of 2017 (WHO 2017a). The GHE 2015 statistics provide a 
comprehensive, comparable set of cause-of-death estimates from 2000 onward, 
consistent with and incorporating estimates from the United Nations (UN) and 
interagency and the WHO data for population, births, all-cause deaths, and 
specific causes of death. The GHE 2015 present results for 183 WHO member states 
with a population of 90,000 or greater in 2015. The GHE 2015 cause-of-death 
estimates by country, region, and world for 2000–15 confirm and expand previous 
WHO analyses of global health trends. In particular, the WHO published an 
assessment of progress toward achievement of the UN Millennium Development Goals 
(MDGs) at the end of 2015 (WHO 2015b), followed by the World Health Statistics 
2016: Monitoring Health for the SDGs (WHO 2016d), which focused on progress and 
challenges for achieving the SDGs for 2030. The SDGs expand the focus of health 
targets from the unfinished MDG agenda for child and maternal mortality and 
priority infectious diseases to a broader agenda including NCDs, injuries, 
health emergencies, and health risk factors as well as a strong focus on 
universal health coverage (UN Statistics Division 2017; WHO 2016d). The GHE 2015 
estimates of trends and levels of mortality by cause will contribute to WHO and 
UN monitoring and reporting of progress toward the SDG health goals and targets.

136. Annual Rates of Decline in Child, Maternal, Tuberculosis, and
Noncommunicable  Disease Mortality across 109 Low- and Middle-Income Countries
from 1990 to 2015.

editors. Disease Control Priorities: Improving Health and Reducing Poverty. 3rd 
edition. Washington (DC): The International Bank for Reconstruction and 
Development / The World Bank; 2017 Nov 27. Chapter 5.

A country’s performance in health is typically defined by how much better or 
worse it performs with respect to a particular outcome (for example, life 
expectancy) compared with what would be expected in light of certain contextual 
attributes (for example, income and education) (Jamison and Sandbu 2001). In 
Good Health at Low Cost, Halstead, Walsh, and Warren (1985) used a case study 
approach to assess country performance in levels of mortality, examining why 
three countries and one Indian state had low levels of mortality despite scant 
resources. Later analyses also quantified performance with respect to levels of 
mortality and fertility (Wang and others 1999). The number of deaths is affected 
strongly by long-standing country-level determinants. Essentially, a country 
that starts with a low level of mortality is likely to continue to have lower 
mortality, whereas a country that begins with a high level of mortality might 
improve substantially but still have comparatively high mortality. Examining 
alterations in the number of deaths or annual rate of change in mortality is 
useful for understanding how a country’s health performance might relate to 
adjustments in policy. Most published work on country performance is based on 
estimates of mortality levels, but some studies investigate rates of change 
(Bhutta and others 2010; Croghan, Beatty, and Ron 2006; Kassebaum and others 
2014; Lozano and others 2011; Muennig and Glied 2010; Munshi, Yamey, and Verguet 
2016; Verguet and Jamison 2013a, 2013b, 2014; Wang and others 2014). To the 
extent that rates of change respond to the introduction of health policies (for 
example, a new immunization program), rates of decline in mortality offer a 
dependent variable with which to understand the effect on performance of social 
and system determinants. Nevertheless, the measure—like any one-dimensional 
metric—still has weaknesses. Notably, large declines from high levels of 
mortality may still leave an unacceptably large number of deaths. Therefore, 
rates of change complement rather than replace the important information 
conveyed by estimates of mortality levels. The need to measure progress in 
health was especially apparent when assessing whether countries were on track to 
achieve the Millennium Development Goals (Bhutta and others 2010; Kassebaum and 
others 2014; Lozano and others 2011; Wang and others 2014). Measuring progress 
is also crucial to determining whether countries can achieve the next set of 
post-2015 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) that were adopted by United 
Nations (UN) member states in 2015. The SDGs include health goals with an 
associated set of targets; the Lancet Commission on Investing in Health proposed 
a target of achieving a “grand convergence in global health” by 2035, defined as 
reducing infectious, maternal, and child deaths to universally low levels, 
similar to today’s rates in the best-performing middle-income countries, such as 
Chile and Turkey (Jamison and others 2013). Other targets were proposed by the 
Global Investment Framework for Women’s and Children’s Health (Stenberg and 
others 2014), the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF 2013), the Sustainable 
Development Solutions Network (SDSN 2013), and the High-Level Panel on the 
post-2015 development agenda (Norheim and others 2015; Peto, Lopez, and Norheim 
2014; UN 2013). All of these proposals were debated before adoption of the SDGs 
by all UN member states. Studying historical rates of change (rates of decline) 
in mortality across countries over recent decades can be helpful for testing the 
feasibility of these different proposals and the SDGs, which include ambitious 
targets for child, maternal, tuberculosis, human immunodeficiency virus/acquired 
immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS), and noncommunicable disease (NCD) 
mortality that would require high rates of decline from 2015 to 2030. Such 
targets for mortality can be tested for their feasibility by looking at whether 
high rates of decline in mortality have ever been achieved by any low- or 
middle-income country (LMIC) and whether similar declines could be achieved in 
2016–30. Assessing a country’s health performance with respect to changes in 
rates of decline in mortality is, therefore, valuable for studying the effects 
of policy and for testing the feasibility of proposed post-2015 health goals. 
This chapter updates a previous study (Verguet and others 2014) that examined 
changes in the annual rate of decline of key mortality indicators for 109 LMICs 
by expanding the period to cover 1990–2015. In addition, we examine annual rates 
of decline in NCD mortality (the probability of dying between ages 50 and 69 
years from NCDs in the presence of other causes) over 1993–2013.

137. Benefit-Cost Analysis in Disease Control Priorities, Third Edition.

Chang AY, Horton S, Jamison DT.

In: Jamison DT, Gelband H, Horton S, Jha P, Laxminarayan R, Mock CN, Nugent R, 
editors. Disease Control Priorities: Improving Health and Reducing Poverty. 3rd 
edition. Washington (DC): The International Bank for Reconstruction and 
Development / The World Bank; 2017 Nov 27. Chapter 9.

A variety of economic methods is used for analysis in the health sector. Other 
chapters in this volume summarize the findings from Disease Control Priorities 
(third edition) (DCP3) concerning cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) and extended 
cost-effectiveness analysis (ECEA) (Horton 2018; Verguet and Jamison 2018). This 
chapter summarizes the findings concerning benefit-cost analysis (BCA). BCA has 
long been used for the analysis of public policy. The U.S. Secretary of the 
Treasury first used it in 1808, and its use became mandatory for the U.S. Army 
Corps of Engineers in 1936. The U.S. Bureau of the Budget first issued 
guidelines for its use in 1952. Mills, Lubell, and Hanson (2008) suggest that 
BCA became less well used for analysis of malaria eradication around 1980, when 
CEA methods were becoming well developed. More recently, there has been a 
resurgence of interest in applying BCA to assess the viability of public 
investment programs and to set priorities among a list of interventions (Jha and 
others 2015; Ozawa and others 2016). BCA tends to be relatively readily 
understood by the general public, because the private sector uses analogous 
concepts. However, BCA also tends to raise controversies because it assigns 
monetary values to outcomes (such as small changes in annual mortality 
probabilities) that cannot be monetized according to many individuals. We 
observe that BCA and CEA in the health sector represent two distinct cultures. 
The metric for value in CEA can accommodate real health outcomes, such as child 
deaths averted, and aggregate measures, such as quality-adjusted life years 
(QALYs) or disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), as well as more granular 
measures, such as malaria cases correctly treated. When health benefits are 
measured in life years, both the ages of the individuals and their remaining 
life expectancies are implicitly factored into the analysis. In contrast, in 
BCA, health benefits are often measured in terms of the number of statistical 
lives; ages and remaining life expectancy of individuals are often not 
considered. BCA involves an additional step of assigning monetary value to 
health benefits; analysts are required to explicitly assume a certain 
relationship between the proportional change in this monetary value and the 
differences in countries’ income levels, namely, income elasticity. This factor 
is often not considered in CEA. The choice of applying CEA or BCA to evaluate 
economic benefits depends on the type of outcomes produced by the health 
interventions. For some interventions, the main benefits include reduced 
mortality, improved quality of life, or reduced morbidity or disability. For 
these outcomes, CEA works well and allows comparisons with other health 
interventions. Many health interventions also affect future health care 
requirements; preventive interventions, in particular, can reduce future health 
care costs. In CEA, these future cost reductions can be subtracted from current 
costs of the intervention before comparing net costs to the health benefits. 
Other interventions may improve health, but their key outcomes are more easily 
expressed in monetary terms. For example, supplementation or food fortification 
with iron or iodine produces modest health benefits in the form of reduced 
anemia and cretinism. However, the most pervasive benefits accrue via improved 
human capital—in this case, cognition and education—and thus BCA is more 
appropriate. The eradication of a disease, such as smallpox, improves health but 
can also save a substantial amount of money through elimination of future 
prevention and treatment costs. Hence, BCA may be the most effective way to 
provide evidence of and advocate for this as a policy intervention. A third 
group of interventions undertaken in sectors outside health (for example, 
improvements in road safety, safety regulations for vehicles, or water and 
sanitation) are more naturally assessed by BCA methods. The investment decisions 
are made in sectors that are accustomed to using BCA, and the investments with 
health benefits are being compared to other investments with outcomes that are 
assessed by BCA. CEA is more frequently used for comparisons within the health 
sector; it has been refined for specific policy purposes, such as the decision 
whether to allow insurance coverage of a particular new drug, technique, health 
technology, or diagnostic test within a country, or for the prioritization of 
the use of donor funds when international assistance is involved. (For 
alternative approaches incorporating noneconomic considerations, see also 
Norheim and others 2017.) BCA, CEA, and ECEA are complementary techniques; each 
has value in addressing specific circumstances or specific policy questions. 
This chapter summarizes the BCA findings from DCP3. It then examines the 
existing methods for valuing life and considers possible improvements and ends 
with concluding comments.

Public Health, Boston, MA.

BACKGROUND: Identifying successful public health ideas and practices is a 
difficult challenge towing to the presence of complex baseline characteristics 
that can affect health outcomes. We propose the use of machine learning 
algorithms to predict life expectancy at birth, and then compare health-related 
characteristics of the under- and overachievers (i.e., municipalities that have 
a worse and better outcome than predicted, respectively).
METHODS: Our outcome was life expectancy at birth for Brazilian municipalities, 
and we used as predictors 60 local characteristics that are not directly 
controlled by public health officials (e.g., socioeconomic factors).
RESULTS: The highest predictive performance was achieved by an ensemble of 
machine learning algorithms (cross-validated mean squared error of 0.168), 
including a 35% gain in comparison with standard decision trees. Overachievers 
presented better results regarding primary health care, such as higher coverage 
of the massive multidisciplinary program Family Health Strategy. On the other 
hand, underachievers performed more cesarean deliveries and mammographies and 
had more life-support health equipment.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that analyzing the predicted value of a health 
outcome may bring insights about good public health practices.
