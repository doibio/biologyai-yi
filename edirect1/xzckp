intervals were often times shorter than recommended. Screening among younger men 
was frequent despite low rates of risk factors. High rates of comorbidity may 
limit life expectancy among older men receiving screening. These findings 
highlight the need for improved guidance with prostate cancer screening.

A recent case of conjoined twins required multiple hospitalizations in the 
pediatric intensive care unit and led to a difficult situation confronting staff 
regarding the potential separation where surgery would result in the death of 
one twin. The hospital ethics committee was consulted. A systematic approach was 
utilized to examine medical standards, historical precedents, and various 
ethical and legal frameworks. The ethics committee believed that either 
proceeding with or forgoing attempted separation surgery would be ethically 
acceptable. We share our reasoning and lessons learned for others facing this 
situation in the future.

Lamin A/C gene mutations can be associated with cardiac diseases, usually 
referred to as 'cardiolaminopathies' characterized by arrhythmic disorders 
and/or left ventricular or biventricular dysfunction up to an overt picture of 
heart failure. The phenotypic cardiac manifestations of laminopathies are 
frequently mixed in complex clinical patterns and specifically may include 
bradyarrhythmias (sinus node disease or atrioventricular blocks), atrial 
arrhythmias (atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, atrial standstill), 
ventricular tachyarrhythmias and heart failure of variable degrees of severity. 
Family history, physical examination, laboratory findings (specifically serum 
creatine phosphokinase values) and ECG findings are often important 'red flags' 
in diagnosing a 'cardiolaminopathy'. Sudden arrhythmic death, thromboembolic 
events or stroke and severe heart failure requiring heart transplantation are 
the most dramatic complications of the evolution of cardiolaminopathies and 
appropriate risk stratification is clinically needed combined with clinical 
follow-up. Treatment with cardiac electrical implantable devices is indicated in 
case of bradyarrhythmias (implant of a device with pacemaker functions), risk of 
life-threatening ventricular tachyarrhythmias (implant of an ICD) or in case of 
heart failure with wide QRS interval (implant of a device for cardiac 
resynchronization). New technologies introduced in the last 5 years can help 
physicians to reduce device-related complications, thanks to the extension of 
device longevity and availability of leadless pacemakers or defibrillators, to 
be implanted in appropriately selected patients. An improved knowledge of the 
complex pathophysiological pathways involved in cardiolaminopathies and in the 
determinants of their progression to more severe forms will help to improve 
clinical management and to better target pharmacological and non-pharmacological 
treatments.

BACKGROUND: Ambulatory Advanced Heart Failure (AAHF) is characterized by 
recurrent HF hospitalizations, escalating diuretic requirements, intolerance to 
neurohormonal antagonists, end-organ dysfunction, short-term reduced life 
expectancy despite optimal medical management (OMM). The role of intermittent 
inotropes in AAHF is unclear. The RELEVANT-HF registry was designed to obtain 
insight on the effectiveness and safety of compassionate scheduled repetitive 
24-hour levosimendan infusions (LEVO) in AAHF patients.
METHODS: 185 AAHF NYHA class III-IV patients, with ≥2 HF 
hospitalizations/emergency visits in the previous 6 months and systolic 
dysfunction, were treated with LEVO at tailored doses (0.05-0.2 μg/kg/min) 
without prior bolus every 3-4 weeks. We compared data on HF hospitalizations 
(percent days spent in hospital, DIH) in the 6 months before and after treatment 
start.
RESULTS: Infusion-related adverse events occurred in 23 (12.4%) patients the 
commonest being ventricular arrhythmias (16, 8.6%). During follow-up, 37 
patients (20%) required for clinical instability treatment adjustments 
(decreases in infusion dose, rate of infusion or interval). From the 6 months 
before to the 6 months after treatment start we found lower DIH (9.4 (8.2) % vs 
2.8 (6.6) %, p < 0.0001), cumulative number (1.3 (0.6) vs 1.8 (0.8), p = 0.0001) 
and length of HF admissions (17.4 (15.6) vs 21.6 (13.4) days, p = 0.0001). 
One-year survival was 86% overall and 78% free from death/LVAD/urgent 
transplant.
CONCLUSIONS: In AAHF patients, who remain symptomatic despite OMM, LEVO is well 
tolerated and associated with lower overall length of hospital stay during six 
months. This multicentre clinical experience underscores the need for a 
randomized controlled trial of LEVO impact on outcomes in AAHF patients.

Substrate Specificity of Acyltransferase Domains for Efficient Transfer of Acyl 
Groups.

Acyltransferase domains (ATs) of polyketide synthases (PKSs) are critical for 
loading of acyl groups on acyl carrier protein domains (A) via self- and 
trans-acylation reactions, to produce structurally diverse polyketides. However, 
the interaction specificity between ATs and unusual acyl units is rarely 
documented. In Streptomycestsukubaensis YN06, we found that AT4FkbB [an AT in 
the fourth module of tacrolimus (FK506) PKS] transferred both allylmalonyl 
(allmal) and emthylmalonyl (ethmal) units to ACPs, which was supposed 
responsible for the production of both FK506 and its analog FK520, respectively. 
Mutations of five residues in AT4FkbB (Q119A, L185I-V186D-V187T, and F203L) 
caused decreased efficiency of allmal transfer, but a higher ratio of ethmal 
transfer, supposedly due to less nucleophilic attacks between Ser599 in the 
active site of AT4FkbB and the carbonyl carbon in the allmal unit, as observed 
from molecular dynamics simulations. Furthermore, reverse mutations of these 
five residues in ethmal-specific ATs to the corresponding residues of AT4FkbB 
increased its binding affinity to allmal-CoA. Among these residues, Val187 of 
AT4FkbB mainly contributed to allmal recognition, and V187K mutant produced less 
FK520 than wild type. Our findings thus suggested that five critical residues 
within AT4FkbB were important for AT functionality in polyketide extension and 
potentially for targeting biosynthesis by generating desirable products and 
eliminating undesirable analogs.

The Extended Evolutionary Synthesis (EES) debate is gaining ground in 
contemporary evolutionary biology. In parallel, a number of philosophical 
standpoints have emerged in an attempt to clarify what exactly is represented by 
the EES. For Massimo Pigliucci, we are in the wake of the newest instantiation 
of a persisting Kuhnian paradigm; in contrast, Telmo Pievani has contended that 
the transition to an EES could be best represented as a progressive reformation 
of a prior Lakatosian scientific research program, with the extension of its 
Neo-Darwinian core and the addition of a brand-new protective belt of 
assumptions and auxiliary hypotheses. Here, we argue that those philosophical 
vantage points are not the only ways to interpret what current proposals to 
'extend' the Modern Synthesis-derived 'standard evolutionary theory' (SET) 
entail in terms of theoretical change in evolutionary biology. We specifically 
propose the image of the emergent EES as a vast network of models and 
interweaved representations that, instantiated in diverse practices, are 
connected and related in multiple ways. Under that assumption, the EES could be 
articulated around a paraconsistent network of evolutionary theories (including 
some elements of the SET), as well as models, practices and representation 
systems of contemporary evolutionary biology, with edges and nodes that change 
their position and centrality as a consequence of the co-construction and 
stabilization of facts and historical discussions revolving around the epistemic 
goals of this area of the life sciences. We then critically examine the 
purported structure of the EES-published by Laland and collaborators in 2015-in 
light of our own network-based proposal. Finally, we consider which epistemic 
units of Evo-Devo are present or still missing from the EES, in preparation for 
further analyses of the topic of explanatory integration in this conceptual 
framework.

PURPOSE: The optimal approach to the integration of postmastectomy 
reconstruction and radiation therapy is not well-established. This review will 
summarize current literature pertaining to the most common types of 
reconstruction in the setting of postmastectomy radiation therapy (PMRT).
DATA SOURCES: Literature from PubMed was reviewed from 2000 to 2016.
STUDY SELECTION: Studies were selected with relevance to "postmastectomy breast 
reconstruction," "breast reconstruction," and "breast reconstructive methods and 
PMRT." Surgical outcomes, patient satisfaction, and cost-effectiveness were 
examined.
DATA EXTRACTION: Data from publications was extracted, summarized, and converted 
to a table.
RESULTS OF DATA SYNTHESIS: Implant-based techniques are on the rise, in the 
setting of PMRT. Implant-based methods are more affordable in the short term and 
result in immediate breast-mound formation compared to autologous methods. When 
compared to implant-based reconstruction with PMRT, autologous reconstruction 
with PMRT results in better quality of life (QoL) and sensory recovery as well 
as fewer complications and failures. Among autologous flaps, deep inferior 
epigastric perforator flaps are considered superior to transverse rectus 
abdominal muscle (TRAM) pedicled flaps and may be more suitable for PMRT. 
Latissimus dorsi and muscle-sparing free TRAM flaps are also viable options. In 
delayed autologous, which may be advantageous for high-risk patients, the 
optimal timing to delay surgery after radiation therapy is unknown. 
Reconstruction with a 2-stage tissue expander-implant technique offers good to 
excellent cosmetic outcomes in the setting of PMRT, although there may be 
complications in this 2-stage process.
CONCLUSION: Surgical, cosmetic, quality of life, and life expectancy must be 
taken into account when selecting the way to integrate breast reconstruction and 
PMRT.

BACKGROUND: The total cost of treating the 3 million Americans chronically 
infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) represents a substantial affordability 
challenge requiring treatment prioritization. This study compares the health and 
economic outcomes of alternative treatment prioritization schedules.
METHODS: We developed a multiyear HCV treatment budget allocation model to 
evaluate the tradeoffs of 7 prioritization strategies. We used optimization to 
identify the priority schedule that maximizes population net monetary benefit 
(NMB). We compared prioritization schedules in terms of the number of 
individuals treated, the number of individuals who progress to end-stage liver 
disease (ESLD), and population total quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). We 
applied the model to the population of treatment-naive patients with a total 
annual HCV treatment budget of US$8.6 billion.
RESULTS: First-come, first-served (FCFS) treats the fewest people with advanced 
fibrosis, prevents the fewest cases of ESLD, and gains the fewest QALYs. A 
schedule developed from optimizing population NMB prioritizes treatment in the 
first year to patients with moderate to severe fibrosis who are younger than 65 
years, followed by older individuals with moderate to severe fibrosis. While 
this strategy yields the greatest population QALYs, prioritization by disease 
severity alone prevents more cases of ESLD. Sensitivity analysis indicated that 
the differences between prioritization schedules are greater when the budget is 
smaller. A 10% annual treatment price reduction enabled treatment 1 year sooner 
to several patient subgroups, specifically older patients and those with less 
severe liver fibrosis.
CONCLUSION: In the absence of a sufficient budget to treat all patients, 
explicit prioritization targeting younger people with more severe disease first 
provides the greatest health benefits. We provide our spreadsheet model so that 
decision makers can compare health tradeoffs of different budget levels and 
various prioritization strategies with inputs tailored to their population.

BACKGROUND: Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) screening programmes have been 
established for men in the UK to reduce deaths from AAA rupture. Whether or not 
screening should be extended to women is uncertain.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of population screening for AAAs 
in women and compare a range of screening options.
DESIGN: A discrete event simulation (DES) model was developed to provide a 
clinically realistic model of screening, surveillance, and elective and 
emergency AAA repair operations. Input parameters specifically for women were 
employed. The model was run for 10 million women, with parameter uncertainty 
addressed by probabilistic and deterministic sensitivity analyses.
SETTING: Population screening in the UK.
PARTICIPANTS: Women aged ≥ 65 years, followed up to the age of 95 years.
INTERVENTIONS: Invitation to ultrasound screening, followed by surveillance for 
small AAAs and elective surgical repair for large AAAs.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Number of operations undertaken, AAA-related mortality, 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), NHS costs and cost-effectiveness with 
annual discounting.
DATA SOURCES: AAA surveillance data, National Vascular Registry, Hospital 
Episode Statistics, trials of elective and emergency AAA surgery, and the NHS 
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Screening Programme (NAAASP).
REVIEW METHODS: Systematic reviews of AAA prevalence and, for elective 
operations, suitability for endovascular aneurysm repair, non-intervention 
rates, operative mortality and literature reviews for other parameters.
RESULTS: The prevalence of AAAs (aortic diameter of ≥ 3.0 cm) was estimated as 
0.43% in women aged 65 years and 1.15% at age 75 years. The corresponding 
attendance rates following invitation to screening were estimated as 73% and 
62%, respectively. The base-case model adopted the same age at screening (65 
years), definition of an AAA (diameter of ≥ 3.0 cm), surveillance intervals (1 
year for AAAs with diameter of 3.0-4.4 cm, 3 months for AAAs with diameter of 
4.5-5.4 cm) and AAA diameter for consideration of surgery (5.5 cm) as in NAAASP 
for men. Per woman invited to screening, the estimated gain in QALYs was 
0.00110, and the incremental cost was £33.99. This gave an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of £31,000 per QALY gained. The corresponding 
incremental net monetary benefit at a threshold of £20,000 per QALY gained was 
-£12.03 (95% uncertainty interval -£27.88 to £22.12). Almost no sensitivity 
analyses brought the ICER below £20,000 per QALY gained; an exception was 
doubling the AAA prevalence to 0.86%, which resulted in an ICER of £13,000. 
Alternative screening options (increasing the screening age to 70 years, 
lowering the threshold for considering surgery to diameters of 5.0 cm or 4.5 cm, 
lowering the diameter defining an AAA in women to 2.5 cm and lengthening the 
surveillance intervals for the smallest AAAs) did not bring the ICER below 
£20,000 per QALY gained when considered either singly or in combination.
LIMITATIONS: The model for women was not directly validated against empirical 
data. Some parameters were poorly estimated, potentially lacking relevance or 
unavailable for women.
CONCLUSION: The accepted criteria for a population-based AAA screening programme 
in women are not currently met.
FUTURE WORK: A large-scale study is needed of the exact aortic size distribution 
for women screened at relevant ages. The DES model can be adapted to evaluate 
screening options in men.

BACKGROUND: A cost-effectiveness analysis of IMRT compared to 3D-CRT for head 
and neck cancer patients (HNCPs) was conducted in the Brazilian Public Health 
System.
METHODS: A Markov model was used to simulate radiation therapy-induced dysphagia 
and xerostomia in HNCPs. Data from the PARSPORT trial and the quality-of-life 
study were used as parameters. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) 
and cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained were calculated.
RESULTS: At 2 years, IMRT was associated with an incremental benefit of 0.16 
QALYs gained per person, resulting in an ICER of BRL 31,579 per QALY gained. 
IMRT was considered cost-effective when using the guideline proposed by the 
World Health Organization (WHO) of three times the national gross domestic 
product (GDP) per capita (BRL 72,195). Regarding life expectancy (15 years), the 
incremental benefit of IMRT was 1.16 QALYs gained per person, with an ICER of 
BRL 4,341. IMRT was also cost-effective using the WHO definition, which states 
that the maximum cost is equal to the GDP per capita (BRL 24,065).
CONCLUSIONS: IMRT was considered cost-effective from the perspective of the 
Brazilian public health system.

Obesity is considered a serious public health problem, as an epidemic disease 
with major global repercussions that is associated with the development of other 
chronic conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases. 
The current study examines the distribution of adult obesity in different 
countries using a beta regression model. This is a descriptive ecological study 
with a quantitative and inferential approach and a focus on beta regression 
analysis. Application of this method used a set of real data from public sources 
on adult obesity in 78 countries in 2014. Descriptive data analysis showed that 
50% of the countries showed adult obesity prevalence greater than 20%. In 
addition, analysis of the distribution of prevalence by country showed lower 
adult obesity levels in countries of Asia and Africa. Meanwhile, higher values 
were found in countries of the Americas and Europe. Boxplot analysis also 
evidenced a possible difference in the proportion of obese adults between the 
Americas and Europe on one side and Africa and Asia on the other. Adjustment of 
the beta regression model with varying dispersion and 5% significance identified 
mean annual per capita alcohol intake, percentage of insufficient physical 
activity, percentage of the population living in urban areas, and life 
expectancy as variables associated with adult obesity.

Publisher: A obesidade é considerada um grave problema de saúde pública, por se 
tratar de uma doença epidêmica de grande repercussão no cenário mundial e que 
está relacionada ao desenvolvimento de outras doenças crônicas, como, por 
exemplo, hipertensão, diabetes e doenças cardiovasculares. Diante disso, o 
presente trabalho tem como objetivo estudar a distribuição da obesidade em 
adultos de diferentes nações, por meio do modelo de regressão beta. Trata-se de 
um estudo ecológico descritivo com abordagem quantitativa e inferencial com foco 
na análise de regressão beta. A aplicação desse método considerou um conjunto de 
dados reais, obtidos a partir de fontes de informação pública, referente à 
obesidade adulta nas nações no ano de 2014. Após a análise descritiva dos dados, 
verificou-se que 50% das nações apresentam uma prevalência de adultos obesos 
maiores que 0,20 (20%). Adicionalmente, ao analisar a distribuição de sua 
prevalência por nação, constatou-se que os menores valores de obesidade adulta 
estão concentrados nos países pertencentes aos continentes da Ásia e África. Por 
outro lado, os maiores valores encontram-se distribuídos entre os países nos 
continentes da América e Europa. Ainda, a partir da análise gráfica do boxplot, 
foram observadas evidências de uma possível diferença nas proporções de adultos 
obesos entre os continentes da América e Europa com os da África e Ásia. Após 
ajustar o modelo de regressão beta com dispersão variável, foi possível 
identificar, ao nível de 5% de significância, que as variáveis consumo médio de 
álcool em litros por pessoa, porcentagem de atividade física insuficiente, 
porcentagem da população que vive em áreas urbanas e expectativa de vida 
apresentam efeito.

Publisher: La obesidad está considerada un grave problema de salud pública, al 
tratarse de una enfermedad epidémica de gran repercusión en el escenario 
mundial, que está relacionada con el desarrollo de otras enfermedades crónicas, 
como, por ejemplo, hipertensión, diabetes y enfermedades cardiovasculares. Ante 
esto, el presente trabajo tiene como objetivo estudiar la distribución de la 
obesidad en adultos de diferentes naciones, mediante un modelo de regresión 
beta. Se trata de un estudio ecológico descriptivo con un abordaje cuantitativo 
e inferencial, centrándose en el análisis de regresión beta. La aplicación de 
este método consideró un conjunto de datos reales, obtenidos a partir de fuentes 
de información pública, referente a la obesidad adulta en las naciones durante 
el año 2014. Tras el análisis descriptivo de los datos, se verificó que el 50% 
de las naciones presentan una prevalencia de adultos obesos mayor de un 0,20 
(20%). Asimismo, al analizar la distribución de su prevalencia por nación, se 
constató que los menores valores de obesidad adulta están concentrados en los 
países pertenecientes a los continentes de Asia y África. Por otro lado, los 
mayores valores se encuentran distribuidos entre los países en los continentes 
de América y Europa. Sin embargo, a partir del análisis gráfico del diagrama de 
caja, se observaron evidencias de una posible diferencia en las proporciones de 
adultos obesos entre los continentes de América y Europa, respecto a los de 
África y Asia. Tras ajustar el modelo de regresión beta con dispersión variable, 
fue posible identificar, con un nivel de un 5% de significancia, que variables 
como: el consumo medio de alcohol en litros por persona, el porcentaje de 
actividad física insuficiente, el porcentaje de la población que vive en áreas 
urbanas y su expectativa de vida presentan efectos en este sentido.

The use of multiple drugs is often referred to as polypharmacy, although this 
term has not been precisely defined. Frequently, drugs are used unwisely in 
multiple combinations increasing the risk of adverse reactions, or for the 
long-term prevention of diseases in patients with a short life expectancy who, 
therefore, will not benefit from them. The reflection on this has led to the 
introduction of the concept of deprescription. There are many reasons for the 
inappropriate drug prescription and barriers to reduce medications. Tools were 
developed to help prescribers to limit the number of prescribed drugs that 
patients are taking. Several studies have shown that deprescription of some 
drugs is possible and safe and can even have a positive influence on wellbeing, 
cognitive function, falls, and admission to a hospital. Deprescription should be 
individualized and carried out, as far as possible, in agreement with patients 
and their families. A six-step method for deprescription is proposed.

The United States (U.S.) is a leader and innovator in biomedicine, yet trails 
behind for many key health indicators, especially for women. This paper 
highlights key evidence indicating that not only is the state of women's health 
in the U.S. lagging, but it is at risk for falling off the curve. Women's health 
care remains fragmented; research in the field can be disconnected and difficult 
to integrate across disciplines-silos prevail. Structural obstacles contribute 
to this lack of cohesion, and innovative, interdisciplinary research approaches 
which integrate the multidimensional aspects of sex and gender, and race and 
ethnicity, with a life course perspective are sorely needed. Such synergistic, 
scientific strategies have the potential to reverse the trend towards shorter 
life expectancy and poorer health for women in the U.S. The National Institute 
for Health (NIH) seeks to raise the bar for the health of all women by tackling 
these issues through enhancing the relevance of biomedical research to the 
health of women and driving the sustained advancement of women in biomedical 
careers.

BACKGROUND: In a rapidly aging society that has promoted extensive reforms of 
the healthcare system, clarifying functional patterns in long-term care wards is 
important for developing regional healthcare policies. This study aimed to 
classify patterns of inpatient characteristics among Japanese long-term care 
wards and to examine hospital/ward characteristics.
METHODS: We analyzed data from 1856 long-term care wards extracted from the 2014 
Annual Report for Functions of Medical Institutions in Japan. We classified five 
clusters of long-term care wards based on inpatients' medical acuity/activities 
of daily living using cluster analysis, and compared hospital/ward 
characteristics across the clusters with a chi-square test or analyses of 
variance.
RESULTS: Cluster 1 was low medical acuity/high activities of daily living 
(n = 175); cluster 2, medium medical acuity/high activities of daily living 
(n = 340); cluster 3, medium medical acuity/low activities of daily living 
(n = 461); cluster 4, high medical acuity/low activities of daily living 
(n = 409); and cluster 5, mixed (n = 471). Although clusters 1 and 2 had similar 
higher proportions of home discharge (48.1% and 34.6%, respectively), there was 
a difference in length of hospital stay between the clusters (154.6 and 
216.6 days, respectively). On the other hand, clusters 3 and 4 experienced a 
longer length of hospital stay (295.7 and 239.8 days, respectively) and a higher 
proportion of in-hospital deaths (42.7% and 50.2%, respectively). 
Characteristics of cluster 5 were not significantly different from the average 
of overall wards.
CONCLUSIONS: There were distinctive differences across hospitals in their use of 
long-term care wards. Wards with different functions have different support 
needs; the clusters with high activities of daily living needed support in 
promoting home discharge, while those with low activities of daily living needed 
support in providing quality end-of-life care. Our results can be useful for 
constructing the future regional healthcare system. This study also suggests 
introducing a standardized patient classification system in long-term care 
settings.

The Human Bocavirus 1 NP1 Protein Is a Multifunctional Regulator of Viral RNA 
Processing.

Human bocavirus 1 (HBoV1) encodes a genus-specific protein, NP1, which regulates 
viral alternative pre-mRNA processing. Similar to NP1 of the related bocavirus 
minute virus of canine (MVC), HBoV1 NP1 suppressed cleavage and polyadenylation 
of RNAs at the viral internal polyadenylation site (pA)p. HBoV1 (pA)p is a 
complex region. It contains 5 significant cleavage and polyadenylation sites, 
and NP1 was found to regulate only the three of these sites that are governed by 
canonical AAUAAA hexamer signals. HBoV1 NP1 also facilitated splicing of the 
upstream intron adjacent to (pA)p. Alternative polyadenylation and splicing of 
the upstream intron were independent of each other, functioned efficiently 
within an isolated transcription unit, and were responsive independent of NP1. 
Characterization of HBoV1 NP1 generalizes its function within the genus 
Bocaparvovirus, uncovers important differences, and provides important 
comparisons with MVC NP1 for mechanistic and evolutionary 
considerations.IMPORTANCE The Parvovirinae are small nonenveloped icosahedral 
viruses that are important pathogens in many animal species, including humans. 
The NP1 protein of human bocavirus 1 (HBoV1), similar to NP1 of the bocavirus 
minute virus of canine (MVC), regulates viral alternative RNA processing by both 
suppressing polyadenylation at an internal site, (pA)p, and facilitating 
splicing of an upstream adjacent intron. These effects allow both extension into 
the capsid gene and splicing of the viral pre-mRNA that correctly registers the 
capsid gene open reading frame. Characterization of HBoV1 NP1 generalizes this 
central mode of parvovirus gene regulation to another member of the bocavirus 
genus and uncovers both important similarities and differences in function 
compared to MVC NP1 that will be important for future comparative studies.

Cell penetrating peptides (CPPs) offer great potential to deliver therapeutic 
molecules to previously inaccessible intracellular targets. However, many CPPs 
are inefficient and often leave their attached cargo stranded in the cell's 
endosome. We report a versatile platform for the isolation of peptides 
delivering a wide range of cargos into the cytoplasm of cells. We used this 
screening platform to identify multiple "Phylomer" CPPs, derived from bacterial 
and viral genomes. These peptides are amenable to conventional sequence 
optimization and engineering approaches for cell targeting and half-life 
extension. We demonstrate potent, functional delivery of protein, peptide, and 
nucleic acid analog cargos into cells using Phylomer CPPs. We validate in vivo 
activity in the cytoplasm, through successful transport of an oligonucleotide 
therapeutic fused to a Phylomer CPP in a disease model for Duchenne's muscular 
dystrophy. This report thus establishes a discovery platform for identifying 
novel, functional CPPs to expand the delivery landscape of druggable 
intracellular targets for biological therapeutics.

BACKGROUND: Blended care combines face-to-face treatment with web-based 
components in mental health care settings. Blended treatment could potentially 
improve active patient participation, by letting patients work though part of 
the protocol autonomously. Further, blended treatment might lower the costs of 
mental health care, by reducing treatment duration and/or therapist contact. 
However, knowledge on blended care for depression is still limited.
OBJECTIVES: To develop a blended cognitive behavioural treatment (bCBT) for 
depressed patients in an outpatient specialized mental health care centre and to 
conduct a preliminary evaluation of this bCBT protocol.
METHOD: A bCBT protocol was developed, taking recommendations into account from 
depressed patients (n = 3) and therapists and experts in the field of e-health 
(n = 18). Next, an initial evaluation of integrated high-intensive bCBT was 
conducted with depressed patients (n = 9) in specialized mental health care. 
Patients' clinical profiles were established based on pre-treatment diagnostic 
information and patient self-reports on clinical measures. Patient treatment 
adherence rates were explored, together with patient ratings of credibility and 
expectancy (CEQ) before treatment, and system usability (SUS) and treatment 
satisfaction after treatment (CSQ-8). During and after treatment, the blended 
treatment protocol was evaluated in supervision sessions with the participating 
therapists (n = 7).
RESULTS: Seven out of nine patients started bCBT, of whom five completed ≥ 90% 
of treatment. System usability was evaluated as being above average (range 63 to 
85), and patients were mostly to very satisfied with bCBT (range 16 to 32). 
Patients reported improvements in depression, health-related quality of life and 
anxiety. We observed that therapists evaluated the highly structured blended 
treatment as a helpful tool in providing evidence-based treatment to this 
complex patient group.
DISCUSSION: Although no conclusions can be drawn based on the current study, our 
observations suggest that a blended CBT approach might shorten treatment 
duration and has the potential to be a valuable treatment option for patients 
with severe depression in specialized mental health care settings. Further 
exploration of the effectiveness of our bCBT protocol by means of a randomized 
controlled trial is warranted.

BACKGROUND: Depression and anxiety interfere with an individual's quality of 
life and result in substantial economic costs to the workplace through lost 
productivity. The internet offers an unparalleled opportunity for the large 
scale, cost-effective delivery of mental health awareness and destigmatisation 
programs in the workplace. However, to date high quality assessments of the 
effectiveness of such workplace programs have been confined to health 
professional settings. The current study reports the effectiveness of Mental 
Health Guru (MH-Guru), a two-module online mental health workplace induction 
program.
METHODS: A total of 507 employees from a large multi-departmental government 
workplace were randomised to a 2-week online depression and anxiety educational 
program (Mental Health Guru; MH-Guru), or a Wait List Control condition. 
Participants completed online surveys at baseline, 1 week post-intervention and 
at 6-month follow-up. Primary outcome measures included depression and anxiety 
literacy, personal stigma about depression and anxiety, and help seeking 
intentions for anxiety and depression at post-test. Secondary measures included 
help-seeking attitudes and self-reported help seeking behaviour. Satisfaction 
measures were also collected.
RESULTS: Dropout at post intervention was 26.7% and 21.0% for the MH-Guru and 
Control conditions respectively. Relative to Control, MH-Guru participants 
showed significantly greater improvements in depression and anxiety literacy at 
post intervention. Between group standardized effect sizes at post-test and 
6-months were 0.78 and 0.81 for depression literacy and 0.80 and 0.79 for 
anxiety literacy. Compared to the Control participants, the MH-Guru group also 
showed significantly greater reductions in depression and anxiety personal 
stigma. Between group effect sizes in stigma for depression were - 0.56 and 
- 0.47 at post-test and 6-months respectively and - 0.42 at both time points for 
anxiety. The MH-Guru intervention was not associated with a differentially 
greater increase in anxiety or depression help-seeking intentions or improvement 
in help seeking attitudes compared to the Control group. However, self-reported 
help-seeking behaviour was significantly greater in the MH-Guru group at 
post-test. In addition, the MH-Guru group showed greater intentions to seek help 
for depression from the Internet at 6-month follow-up. Satisfaction items 
suggested that the program was acceptable to employees.
CONCLUSIONS: Brief online programs such as MH-Guru have the potential to play an 
important role in increasing mental health awareness and decreasing stigmatizing 
attitudes in the workplace, and by extension the general community.

Potential gains in life expectancy by eliminating deaths from cardiovascular 
diseases and diabetes mellitus in the working life ages among Slovak population.

BACKGROUND: In recent years, high mortality from cardiovascular diseases 
(chronic ischemic heart disease, acute coronary syndrome, cerebrovascular 
diseases, atherosclerosis, hypertensive diseases) and diabetes mellitus have 
burdened economic and health system of the Slovak Republic considerably. By 
eliminating these deaths, the life expectancy could be prolonged. Since the 
mortality of population during working period has higher importance in terms of 
economic consequences of diseases, this article aims to assess the potential 
gains in life expectancy (PGLEs) of the Slovak population comparing the entire 
life span and working life-time.
METHODS: Data are obtained from the National Health Information Center mortality 
reports by sex during 1996-2014, and the method of constructing abridged life 
tables is used to compute the corresponding PGLEs. The added years, which would 
be gained by eliminating causes of deaths, are decomposed by the two sets of 
working age groups population (25-44 and 45-64 years).
RESULTS: The highest impact on life expectancy was recorded in chronic ischemic 
heart disease for both sexes aged 45-64 years (0.078 for males, 0.019 added 
years for females) over 1996-2014. However, they showed a small declining trend 
(- 16%) for males and even an increasing trend (2%) for females. At present, the 
labour force potential of working group (25-44 years) is most threatened by 
deaths from cerebrovascular diseases, while population of working age 
(45-64 years) by deaths from chronic ischemic heart disease. Relative importance 
of acute coronary syndrome for males (45-64 years) increased, when comparing the 
entire with working time life.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings pose new and immediate challenges to policy makers and 
provoke discussion about prevention program strategies leading to increasing the 
life expectancy.
