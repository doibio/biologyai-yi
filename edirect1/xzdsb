causes, whereas regions with low SDIs and life expectancy for all sexes (Afar 
and Somali) had high rates of premature mortality from the leading causes. In 
2019, child and maternal malnutrition; unsafe water, sanitation, and 
handwashing; air pollution; high systolic blood pressure; alcohol use; and high 
fasting plasma glucose were the leading risk factors for health loss across 
regions and cities.
INTERPRETATION: There were substantial improvements in health over the past 
three decades across regions and chartered cities in Ethiopia. However, the 
progress, measured in SDI, life expectancy, TFR, premature mortality, 
disability, and risk factors, was not uniform. Federal and regional health 
policy makers should match strategies, resources, and interventions to disease 
burden and risk factors across regions and cities to achieve national and 
regional plans, Sustainable Development Goals, and universal health coverage 
targets.

BACKGROUND: This study quantified differences in remaining life expectancy (RLE) 
among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander and other Australian patients with 
cancer. We assessed how much of this disparity was due to differences in cancer 
and noncancer mortality and calculated the population gain in life years for 
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders cancer diagnoses if the cancer survival 
disparities were removed.
METHODS: Flexible parametric relative survival models were used to estimate RLE 
by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander status for a population-based cohort of 
709,239 persons (12,830 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders), 2005 to 2016.
RESULTS: For all cancers combined, the average disparity in RLE was 8.0 years 
between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders (12.0 years) and other 
Australians (20.0 years). The magnitude of this disparity varied by cancer type, 
being >10 years for cervical cancer versus <2 years for lung and pancreatic 
cancers. For all cancers combined, around 26% of this disparity was due to 
differences in cancer mortality and 74% due to noncancer mortality. Among 1,342 
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders diagnosed with cancer in 2015 an 
estimated 2,818 life years would be gained if cancer survival disparities were 
removed.
CONCLUSIONS: A cancer diagnosis exacerbates the existing disparities in RLE 
among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders. Addressing them will require 
consideration of both cancer-related factors and those contributing to noncancer 
mortality.
IMPACT: Reported survival-based measures provided additional insights into the 
overall impact of cancer over a lifetime horizon among Aboriginal and Torres 
Strait Islander peoples.

Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) as an age-related, irreversible 
neurodegenerative disease, characterized by cognitive dysfunction, has become 
progressively serious with a global rise in life expectancy. As the failure of 
drug elaboration, considerable research effort has been devoted to developing 
therapeutic strategies for treating AD. TCM is gaining attention as a potential 
treatment for AD. Gastrodia elata Blume, Polygala tenuifolia Willd., Cistanche 
deserticola Ma, Rehmannia lutinosa (Gaertn.)DC., Acorus gramineus Aiton, and 
Curcuma longa L. (GPCRAC) are all well-known Chinese herbs with neuroprotective 
benefits and are widely used in traditional Chinese decoction for AD therapy. 
However, the efficacy and further mechanisms of GPCRAC extracts in AD 
experimental models are still unclear. The purpose of this study was to 
investigate the synergistic protective efficacy of GPCRAC extracts (composed of 
extracts from these six Chinese medicines), and the protein targets mediated by 
GPCRAC extracts in treating AD. Methods: Scopolamine-induced cognitive 
impairment mouse model was established to determine the neuroprotective effects 
of GPCRAC extracts in vivo, as shown by behavioral tests and cerebral 
cholinergic function assays. To identify the potential molecular mechanism of 
GPCRAC extracts against AD, label-free quantitative proteomics coupled with 
tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) were performed. The integrated 
bioinformatics analysis was applied to screen the core differentially expressed 
proteins in vital canonical pathways. Critical altered proteins were validated 
by qPCR and Western blotting. Results: Administration of GPCRAC extracts 
significantly recovered scopolamine-induced cognitive impairment, as evidenced 
by the improved learning and memory ability, increased Ach content and ChAT 
activity, as well as decreased AchE activity in the hippocampus of mice. In 
total, 390 proteins with fold-change>1.2 or <0.83 and p < 0.05 were identified 
as significant differentially expressed proteins, of which 110 were 
significantly up-regulated and 25 were significantly down-regulated between 
control and model group. By mapping the significantly regulated proteins, we 
identified five hub proteins: PPP2CA, Gsk3β, PP3CC, PRKACA, and BCL-2 that were 
associated with dopaminergic synapse and apoptosis signaling pathway, 
respectively. Western blotting and QPCR demonstrate that the expression levels 
of these core proteins could be significantly improved by the administration of 
GPCRAC extracts. These pathways and some of the identified proteins are 
implicated in AD pathogenesis. Conclusion: Administration of GPCRAC extracts was 
effective on alleviating scopolamine-induced cognitive impairment, which might 
be through modulation of dopaminergic synapse and apoptosis signaling pathway. 
Consequently, our quantitative proteome data obtained from scopolamine-treated 
model mice successfully characterized AD-related biological alterations and 
proposed novel protein biomarkers for AD.

Metabolic Surgery: Paradigm Shift in Metabolic Syndrome/Diabetes Therapy.

Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.

BACKGROUND: Obesity and metabolic disorders as type 2 diabetes (T2D), 
nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) or better called metabolic dysfunction 
fatty liver disease (MAFLD), arterial hypertension (AHT), and obstructive sleep 
apnea syndrome (OSAS) show a rising prevalence. The increased cardiovascular 
risk is one of the main causes for death of obese, metabolic ill patients. 
Sustainable and efficient therapeutic options are needed.
SUMMARY: Metabolic surgery not only permits a substantial and lasting weight 
loss but also ameliorates metabolic co-morbidities and reduces cardiovascular 
risk and mortality of obese patients. Most existing data focused on T2D, but 
evidence for other metabolic co-morbidities such as NAFLD, AHT, and OSAS 
increase constantly. After metabolic surgery, glycemic control of diabetic 
patients is superior compared to conservative treatment. Also, diabetes related 
micro- and macrovascular complications are reduced after surgery, and the median 
life expectancy is over 9 years longer. In patients with MAFLD, metabolic 
surgery leads to reduction of steatosis and fibrosis while the risk to develop a 
hepatocellular carcinoma is reduced significantly. Patients with OSAS have an 
improved lung function and continuous pressure airway treatment during the night 
is unnecessary in many patients. Patients with AHT need significantly less or 
even no antihypertensive medication after surgery and the hazard ratio of death 
is reduced by 49.2%. Therefore, the focus in treating obese and metabolic ill 
patients is no longer on pure weight loss but on improvement of co-morbidities 
and reduction of mortality. This is reflected by the updated S3-guidelines of 
2018 that provide nationally established consistent guidelines with clear 
indications for metabolic surgery no longer focusing on body mass index (BMI) 
only. This article aims to give an overview over the existing literature 
concerning surgical treatment options for metabolic syndrome.
KEY MESSAGES: Metabolic co-morbidities impact life-quality and life expectancy 
of obese patients. Metabolic surgery offers the chance to treat those metabolic 
co-morbidities independently of the preoperative BMI and should be considered 
early as a treatment option for obese patients.

BACKGROUND: Lumbar radiculopathy is an extensively common complaint reported by 
patients of low back pain (LBP), resulting in several impairments. A 
comparatively novel technique, non-surgical spinal decompression (NSD), is 
introduced, which uses a sensitive computerized feedback mechanism and 
decompresses the spinal nerve roots through segmental distraction. The objective 
of this study was to determine the effects of NSD therapy in addition to routine 
physical therapy on pain, lumbar range of motion (ROM), functional disability, 
back muscle endurance (BME), and quality of life (QOL) in patients with lumbar 
radiculopathy.
METHODS: A total of sixty patients with lumbar radiculopathy were randomly 
allocated into two groups, an experimental (n = 30) and a control (n = 30) 
group, through a computer-generated random number table. Baseline values were 
recorded before providing any treatment by using a visual analogue scale (VAS), 
Urdu version of Oswestry disability index (ODI-U), modified-modified Schober's 
test (MMST), prone isometric chest raise test, and Short Form 36-Item Survey 
(SF-36) for measuring the pain at rest, functional disability, lumbar ROM, BME, 
and QOL, respectively. All patients received twelve treatment sessions over 4 
weeks, and then all outcome measures were again recorded.
RESULTS: By using the ANCOVA test, a statistically significant (p < 0.05) 
between-group improvement was observed in VAS, ODI-U, BME, lumbar ROM, role 
physical (RP), and bodily pain (BP) domains of SF-36, which was in favour of NSD 
therapy group. The between-group difference was 1.07 ± 0.32 cm (p < .001) for 
VAS, 5.65 ± 1.48 points (p < .001) for ODI-U, 13.93 ± 5.85 s (p = 0.002) for 
BME, 2.62 ± 0.27 cm (p < .001) for lumbar flexion, 0.96 ± 0.28 (p < .001) for 
lumbar extension, 5.77 ± 2.39 (p = 0.019) for RP and 6.33 ± 2.52 (p = 0.016) for 
BP domain of SF-36. For these outcomes, a medium to large effect size 
(d = 0.61-2.47, 95% CI: 0.09-3.14) was observed.
CONCLUSION: It was concluded that a combination of non-surgical spinal 
decompression therapy with routine physical therapy is more effective, 
statistically and clinically, than routine physical therapy alone in terms of 
improving pain, lumbar range of motion, back muscle endurance, functional 
disability, and physical role domain of quality of life, in patients with lumbar 
radiculopathy, following 4 weeks of treatment.

BACKGROUND: Understanding the perspective of health care professionals (HCPs) is 
significant to the implementation of deprescribing in older adults with limited 
life expectancy (LLE) but a tool to assess this is lacking.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to develop and validate a survey tool for assessing 
HCPs attitudes towards deprescribing (HATD) in older adults with LLE.
METHODS: An online survey was used to collect data to determine the psychometric 
properties of a 49-item questionnaire generated from literature review, expert 
opinion and pretesting. 108 HCPs (doctors, nurses and pharmacists) with 
experience or interest in palliative care or a member of a palliative care 
team/organisation completed the survey.
RESULTS: Principal component analysis of the participants' data resulted in a 
23-item questionnaire structured in five factors, named HATD tool. The factors 
were related to concerns about deprescribing (7 items), perceived burden of 
medications on patients (7 items), organisational support for deprescribing (4 
items), assurance to deprescribing (2 items) and perceived involvement of 
patients in medication management (3 items). The HATD tool had valid descriptive 
statistics (Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin measure: 0.708; Bartlett's test of sphericity: 
p < 0.001, determinant: 1.35E-5; variance explained: 60.4%; nonredundant 
residuals with absolute values > 0.05: 39%). The reliability statistics of all 
the factors were ≥0.750 for both Cronbach's alpha (α) and composite reliability 
(CR) except for the patient-involvement factor (α = 0.644 but CR = 0.787).
CONCLUSIONS: The 23-itemed HATD tool is a valid and reliable tool to assess the 
attitudes and beliefs of HCPs towards deprescribing in older adults with LLE in 
the Australian setting.

BACKGROUND: Given that life expectancy has improved, nonagenarians have become a 
significant proportion of world population. As aortic stenosis is primarily a 
disease of the elderly, the need for invasive cardiac approaches is expected to 
increase in people of extreme age. Herein, we compare the in-hospital adverse 
clinical outcomes and mortality after transcatheter aortic valve implantation 
(TAVI) procedures in nonagenarians to younger than 90 year old patients.
METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted on 1336 patients who underwent TAVI 
between January 2016 and March 2020 at Toulouse University Hospital, Rangueil, 
France. Post-TAVI adverse clinical outcomes were defined according to Valve 
Academic Research Consortium-2 Criteria. The studied population was divided into 
2 groups according to age.
RESULTS: Out of 1336 patients, 250 (18.7%) were nonagenarians with a mean age of 
91.8 ± 1.9 years. Pacemaker implantation (12.4% vs 12.1%), stroke (2% vs 1.8%), 
and major vascular complications (9.2% vs 6.7%) were more common in 
nonagenarians, whereas acute kidney injury (1.2% vs 2.7%) and major bleeding 
events (3.2% vs 3.4%) were more common in the <90-year-old group. Nonagenarians 
are more likely to develop major vascular complications (odds ratio [OR] = 1.76 
95% confidence interval [CI] 1.04-3, P = .03). The prevalence of in-hospital 
mortality in nonagenarians and <90-year-old patients were 5.2% and 2%, 
respectively. Survival analysis showed a significant difference in mortality 
during hospitalization period only ( P = .04).
CONCLUSION: The prevalence of TAVI procedural success is remarkably high in 
nonagenarians and comparable to that of younger patients. However, the 
in-hospital mortality rate was 2-fold more than that of <90-year-old patients.

BACKGROUND: Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) provide a means to compare 
injuries using a common measurement which allows quality of life and duration of 
life from an injury to be considered. A more comprehensive picture of the 
economic losses associated with injuries can be found when QALY estimates are 
combined with medical and work loss costs. This study provides estimates of QALY 
loss.
METHODS: QALY loss estimates were assigned to records in the 2018 National 
Electronic Injury Surveillance System - All Injury Program. QALY estimates by 
body region and nature of injury were assigned using a combination of previous 
research methods. Injuries were rated on six dimensions, which identify a set of 
discrete qualitative impairments. Additionally, a seventh dimension, 
work-related disability, was included. QALY loss estimates were produced by 
intent and mechanism, for all emergency department-treated cases, by two 
disposition groups.
RESULTS: Lifetime QALY losses ranged from 0.0004 to 0.388 for treated and 
released injuries, and from 0.031 to 3.905 for hospitalised injuries. The 1-year 
monetary value of QALY losses ranged from $136 to $437 000 among both treated 
and released and hospitalised injuries. The lifetime monetary value of QALY 
losses for hospitalised injuries ranged from $16 000 to $2.1 million.
CONCLUSIONS: These estimates provide information to improve knowledge about the 
comprehensive economic burden of injuries; direct cost elements that can be 
measured through financial transactions do not capture the full cost of an 
injury. Comprehensive assessment of the long-term cost of injuries, including 
quality of life losses, is critical to accurately estimate the economic burden 
of injuries.

INTRODUCTION: This study aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of sintilimab 
plus bevacizumab versus sorafenib as a first-line treatment for unresectable 
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in China to provide economic evidence to inform 
health decision making.
METHODS: We performed an economic evaluation from the perspective of the Chinese 
healthcare system using a partitioned survival model with three mutually 
exclusive health states: progression free, post-progression, and death. Efficacy 
data were obtained from the ORIENT-32 clinical trial and extrapolated to the 
lifetime horizon. Cost and utility values were derived from published studies 
and online price databases. The primary outcomes of the model were 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratios (ICERs). Sensitivity analyses were carried out to verify the robustness 
of the model results.
RESULTS: Compared with sorafenib, sintilimab plus bevacizumab incurred a higher 
lifetime cost ($33,766 vs. $23,294) and yielded more QALYs (1.428 vs. 0.928 
QALYs). The ICER for sintilimab plus bevacizumab was $20,968/QALY and lower than 
the willingness-to-pay threshold of $33,592. The results of sensitivity analysis 
showed that ICER values were most sensitive to the subsequent treatment cost of 
the sorafenib group after progression and the price of bevacizumab. In the 
scenario analysis, the ICER was $4191/QALY when a 7.5 mg/kg dose of bevacizumab 
was applied in the model.
CONCLUSIONS: Compared with sorafenib, the sintilimab plus bevacizumab 
combination is likely to be a cost-effective option for patients with 
unresectable HCC in China.

Nitrogen (N) limitation has been considered as a constraint on terrestrial 
carbon uptake in response to rising CO2 and climate change. By extension, it has 
been suggested that declining carboxylation capacity (Vcmax ) and leaf N content 
in enhanced-CO2 experiments and satellite records signify increasing N 
limitation of primary production. We predicted Vcmax using the coordination 
hypothesis and estimated changes in leaf-level photosynthetic N for 1982-2016 
assuming proportionality with leaf-level Vcmax at 25°C. The whole-canopy 
photosynthetic N was derived using satellite-based leaf area index (LAI) data 
and an empirical extinction coefficient for Vcmax , and converted to annual N 
demand using estimated leaf turnover times. The predicted spatial pattern of 
Vcmax shares key features with an independent reconstruction from remotely 
sensed leaf chlorophyll content. Predicted leaf photosynthetic N declined by 
0.27% yr-1 , while observed leaf (total) N declined by 0.2-0.25% yr-1 . 
Predicted global canopy N (and N demand) declined from 1996 onwards, despite 
increasing LAI. Leaf-level responses to rising CO2 , and to a lesser extent 
temperature, may have reduced the canopy requirement for N by more than rising 
LAI has increased it. This finding provides an alternative explanation for 
declining leaf N that does not depend on increasing N limitation.

Effective antiretroviral treatment has increased the life expectancy of people 
living with HIV, and currently, the challenges of prominent importance appear to 
be mental health issues. This preregistered study among adults living with 
HIV/AIDS investigated the effectiveness of a brief self-affirmation intervention 
framed in terms of if-then plans (i.e. self-affirming implementation intentions 
[S-AII]) against both active and non-active control conditions, forming 
non-affirming implementation intentions and mere goal intentions, respectively. 
The primary outcomes were defined as a reduction of depressive symptoms and 
enhancement of well-being, along with secondary outcomes as positive other- and 
self-directed feelings. A total of 162 individuals were assessed for 
eligibility, and 130 (aged 18-74 years) were randomized to the study conditions. 
Intervention effects were estimated through intention-to-treat analysis, using 
linear mixed models. The S-AII intervention yielded improvements in overall 
well-being over 2 weeks (d = .23), primarily driven by positive changes in 
emotional (d = .24) and social (d = .30) dimensions of well-being. There were no 
significant differences in depression or secondary outcomes. Based on a minimal 
clinically important difference index, the S-AII intervention resulted in 
improvement in well-being in approximately 40 percent of participants. 
Nevertheless, further systematic research is needed to optimize 
self-affirmation-interventions, before their application in real-life contexts.

AIMS: Existing treatment-sequence models for psoriasis are limited by lines of 
treatments included. We sought to more accurately capture the patient experience 
with an increasing number of treatments while maintaining the complexity and 
transparency of current models.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We adapted a standard treatment-sequence model for 
psoriasis with two lines of active treatments followed by best supportive care 
(BSC). The first line was used to model the targeted treatments for comparison 
(Biologic A or B). The second line was used potentially to model all treatments 
(excluding the first-line treatment) before BSC, termed the basket of biologics 
(BoB). First-line treatment and the BoB were modeled with an induction and 
maintenance phase. The BoB efficacy was assumed to be the average of all 
treatments included and the BoB annual discontinuation rate was based on the 
number of treatments included and their individual annual discontinuation rate. 
A varying number of treatments in the BoB were tested (1, 5, 10). Model inputs 
were from published literature.
RESULTS: In our example, when the number of treatments in the BoB increased from 
1 to 10, the annual discontinuation rate of the BoB dropped from 16.5% to 1.2%. 
Time on BoB increased from 4.16 to 19.16 years and the time on BSC decreased 
from 28.28 to 13.29 years. Total costs and quality-adjusted life years increased 
with an increasing number of treatments in the BoB.
LIMITATIONS: The properties of the BoB were simplified in order to maintain the 
transparency of the model. Results may differ if individual treatments in the 
BoB are modeled line by line.
CONCLUSIONS: Modification with the BoB allows a greater number of treatments 
within the model, providing a closer reflection of clinical reality, and has 
implications for evaluation of the long-term cost-effectiveness of psoriasis 
treatments.

Plain Language Summary: Psoriasis is a chronic skin disease with no cure that 
causes itchy and painful plaques and scales, most commonly found on the scalp, 
trunk, elbows, and knees. A variety of treatments are available that can improve 
the signs and symptoms of psoriasis. Healthcare payers are interested in the 
costs, benefits, and risks of treatments for all diseases, including those for 
psoriasis. These payers often use mathematical models to better understand and 
compare the value of various treatments. With psoriasis, these models usually 
assume three lines of active therapy and then a final supportive therapy over a 
patient’s lifetime. However, the average number of therapies patients with 
psoriasis receive is often greater than three, resulting in them spending most 
of their time on, and switching among, treatments rather than on best supportive 
care. Therefore, instead of modeling each line of treatment individually, the 
researchers proposed a modification to the existing model framework, whereby all 
subsequent treatments are combined into a single basket. This modification 
allowed for many treatments to be considered over the lifetime of patients with 
psoriasis and also maintained the model’s complexity. The researchers found that 
as the amount of time on active therapy increased, the amount of time on 
supportive therapy decreased, treatment costs increased, and patients spent more 
time with better quality-of-life. The researchers concluded that the proposed 
model modification more closely resembles clinical practice than the previous 
model and would be very useful to healthcare payers in better estimating the 
value of psoriasis treatments.

Continuity and security includes people with intellectual and developmental 
disabilities (IDD) not only having resources to meet their basic needs, but also 
includes the amount of change and disruption people have in their lives and the 
control they have over that change. We explored the impact of continuity and 
security on people with IDD's (n = 325) quality of life by analyzing Personal 
Outcome Measures interviews. Continuity and security not only significantly 
increased overall quality of life, but it also positively impacted two thirds of 
the different outcomes, ranging from health to relationships to rights. A 
stronger community infrastructure is needed to promote the continuity and 
security, and, by extension, quality of life of people with IDD.

INTRODUCTION: Real-time continuous glucose monitoring (rt-CGM) allows patients 
with diabetes to adjust insulin dosing, potentially improving glucose control. 
This study aimed to compare the long-term cost-effectiveness of the Dexcom G6 
rt-CGM device versus self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) and flash glucose 
monitoring (FGM) in Australia in people with type 1 diabetes (T1D).
METHODS: Long-term costs and clinical outcomes were estimated using the CORE 
Diabetes Model. Clinical input data for the analysis of rt-CGM versus SMBG and 
FGM were sourced from the DIAMOND study and a network meta-analysis, 
respectively. Rt-CGM and FGM were associated with quality of life (QoL) benefits 
due to reduced fear of hypoglycaemia (FoH) and fingerstick testing. Analyses 
were performed over a lifetime time horizon from an Australian healthcare payer 
perspective, including direct costs from published data. Future costs and 
clinical outcomes were discounted at 5% per annum.
RESULTS: Rt-CGM was associated with an increased quality-adjusted life 
expectancy of 1.199 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), increased mean total 
lifetime costs of AUD 21,596 and an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) 
of AUD 18,020 per QALY gained compared with SMBG. Compared with FGM, rt-CGM was 
associated with an increased quality-adjusted life expectancy of 0.569 QALYs, 
increased mean total lifetime costs of AUD 11,064 and an ICER of AUD 19,455 per 
QALY gained. Key drivers of outcomes included HbA1c benefits and QoL benefits 
associated with reduced FoH and fingerstick testing.
CONCLUSIONS: Due to improved clinical outcomes and QoL gains rt-CGM is highly 
cost-effective compared with SMBG and FGM in people with T1D in Australia.

Successful Diagnosis and Treatment of Occult Prostate Cancer Despite Multiple 
Negative Prostate Biopsies and Negative Prostate MRIs.

Morris KE, Grimberg DC, Gupta RT, Pendse AA, Moul JW.

Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) values above 100 ng/mL often suggest metastatic 
prostate cancer. We present the case of a patient with a PSA of 110 ng/mL, 4 
negative prostate biopsies, and 4 negative prostate MRIs. After his fifth MRI 
revealed a PI-RADS 5 lesion, he underwent his fifth transrectal biopsy; this 
revealed Gleason 3 + 4 = 7. He was found to have organ-confined pT2 disease on 
subsequent radical prostatectomy pathology. This case highlights that there may 
be no PSA for which one can assume metastatic disease with certainty. Depending 
on life expectancy, patients with extremely elevated PSA may still warrant a 
full staging workup.

Bone metastases are difficult to treat surgically, necessitating a 
multidisciplinary approach that must be applied to each patient depending on the 
specifics of their case. The main indications for surgical treatment are a lack 
of response to chemotherapy, radiation therapy, hormone therapy, immunotherapy, 
and bisphosphonates which is defined by persistent pain or tumor progression; 
the risk of imminent pathological bone fracture; and surgical treatment for 
single bone metastases. An important aspect of choosing the right treatment for 
these patients is accurately estimating life expectancy. Improved chemotherapy, 
postoperative radiation therapy, and sustainable reconstructive modalities will 
increase the patient's life expectancy. The surgeon should select the best 
surgical strategy based on the primary tumor and its characteristics, the 
presence of single or multiple metastases, age, anatomical location, and the 
functional resources of the patient. Preventive osteosynthesis, osteosynthesis 
to stabilize a fracture, resections, and reconstructions are the main surgical 
options for bone metastases. Resection and reconstruction with a modular 
prosthesis remain the generally approved surgical option to restore 
functionality, increase the quality of life, and increase life expectancy. 
Preoperative embolization is necessary, especially in the case of metastases of 
renal or thyroid origin. This procedure is extremely important to avoid 
complications, with a major impact on survival rates.

BACKGROUND: The formation of dental caries is the most common chronic disease in 
children, and is preventable. The oral health-related quality of life has an 
immense impact on an individual's daily functioning, well-being or overall 
quality of life.
OBJECTIVES: This study aims to investigate the cost effectiveness of the Dental 
RECUR Brief Negotiated Interview for Oral Health (DR-BNI). This 30-minute 
therapeutic "talk" by a dental nurse with a parent/guardian was compared with a 
placebo-controlled intervention in preventing reoccurrence of dental caries in 
children who have had a primary tooth extracted.
METHODS: An economic model was developed to simulate the clinical progression of 
dental caries among children who have previously had a primary tooth extracted. 
The analysis was conducted using the UK NHS perspective. The main outcome was 
the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) based on the quality-adjusted 
life years (QALYs). Estimates of costs and probabilities were obtained from the 
DR-BNI multicentre randomised controlled trial (RCT), while QALY values were 
obtained from published literature. Univariate and probabilistic sensitivity 
analyses were conducted to assess the uncertainty of the result and robustness 
of the model. Affordability and risk-aversion of the intervention were 
investigated to help decision makers make the best possible choices.
RESULTS: With an intervention cost of £6.47, the results from the RCT showed the 
healthcare cost for the DR-BNI intervention was £115.90 per child while the 
control had a healthcare cost of £119.46 per child. The QALYs gained for the 
prevention of reoccurrence of dental caries was higher in the DR-BNI 
intervention arm by 0.023 QALYs; thus, the DR-BNI was the dominant intervention. 
At willingness to pay threshold of £3500/QALY gained, a maximum probability of 
being cost effectiveness is achieved at 86%. The secondary analysis showed a 
cost-savings of £20.94 per participant for the prevention of at least one 
filling or extraction. Affordability results showed that the DR-BNI programme is 
affordable to the UK health system at a moderately low budget.
CONCLUSIONS: This study shows the proactive talking intervention to have a very 
moderate cost and to be effective in providing better health related 
quality-of-life gains. The intervention is cost savings with a dominant ICER 
even with a 200% increase in the cost of intervention. The NHS will be providing 
better oral health for children at a better net monetary benefit-to-risk ratio 
by adopting the DR-BNI intervention in preventing the reoccurrence of dental 
fillings and extractions for each participant.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial was registered prospectively on 27th September 
2013 with the trial registration number ISRCTN 24958829.

BACKGROUND: With increasing life expectancy, the incidence of gastric cancer 
(GC) in older adults is increasing. This study analyzed differences in GC 
characteristics according to age and sex among patients who underwent surgical 
treatment for GC.
METHODS: A total of 2,983 patients diagnosed with gastric adenocarcinoma who 
underwent surgical treatment at Seoul National University Bundang Hospital 
between 2003 and 2017 were classified into three groups: I (&lt;65 years, 
n=1,680), II (60-74 years, n=919), and III (≥75 years, n=384). We compared the 
baseline clinical characteristics, pathological characteristics of the tumor, 
overall and GC-specific survival rates, and associated risk factors between the 
groups.
RESULTS: Cancer of the distal third of the stomach (p&lt;0.001), with 
intestinal-type histology (p&lt;0.001), and with p53 overexpression (p=0.004) 
were more common in groups II and III than in group I, and the proportion of 
intestinal-type GC increased with age. The cancer type, lymph node metastasis, 
and cancer stage did not differ significantly. In terms of overall survival, 
survival decreased with increasing age (p&lt;0.001), but this difference 
decreased significantly for GC-specific survival. Cox multivariate analyses 
revealed age, histologic type (diffuse or mixed type), and advanced cancer stage 
(p=0.002, 0.001, and &lt;0.001, respectively) as risk factors for GC-related 
mortality.
CONCLUSION: Age itself was found to be one of the most important prognostic 
factors for overall and disease-specific survival in elderly GC patients, along 
with cancer stage.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is a prevalent 
cardiovascular disease. Understanding current and future disease burden of PAD 
and its attributable risk factors is critical for developing prevention measures 
targeting PAD and associated complications.
METHODS: We analyzed the death burden of PAD and the trends of six risk factors 
from 1990 to 2019 using the updated 2019 Global Burden of Disease study 
database, and projected the next decade death burden using a Bayesian 
age-period-cohort (BAPC) model.
RESULTS: The global age-standardized mortality rate (ASMR) of PAD has a modest 
downward trend from 1990 to 2019. Regionally, ASMRs in higher-sociodemographic 
index (SDI) areas remained more remarkable than in lower-SDI areas by 2019, 
while the rate of increase in death burden in the lower-SDI regions increased 
rapidly over time. ASMR in males was greater than in females. In the population 
aged older than 40 years, the sex difference in PAD-associated mortality 
decreased with age. High fasting plasma glucose (FPG) became the primary risk 
factor for PAD-related death. The contributions of risk factors to PAD-related 
death varied by age group. Kidney dysfunction was the primary contributor to 
PAD-related death in people aged 40-59 years, particularly in women.
CONCLUSIONS: The global death burden of PAD has not substantially decreased over 
the three decades. There are large variations in the trend of PAD mortality and 
its attributable risk factors by SDI regions, sex, and age group. Targeted and 
effective strategies are needed for the management of PAD-related mortality in 
specific subgroups.
