collected to inform the economic analysis. An embedded process evaluation will 
obtain information to test out the theory of change underpinning the 
intervention and its acceptability to staff and residents.
DISCUSSION: This feasibility trial with embedded process evaluation and 
collection of health economic data will allow us to undertake detailed 
feasibility work to inform a future large-scale trial. It will provide valuable 
information to inform research procedures in this important but challenging 
area.

Outcomes of Recreational Activity-Associated Trauma in Elderly Persons on 
Blood-Thinning Medications.

DeBoard ZM, Grotts J, Ferrigno L.

With increasing life expectancy, the elderly are participating in recreational 
activities traditionally pursued by younger persons. Elderly patients have many 
reasons for worse outcomes after trauma, one of which may be the rising use of 
anticoagulant and/or antiplatelet medications. This study aimed to determine 
whether preinjury use of these agents yielded worse outcomes in geriatric 
patients injured during high-impact recreational activities. The National Trauma 
Data Bank was reviewed from 2007 to 2010 for patients ≥65 years admitted to 
Level I or II trauma centers with ICD-9 E-codes for specific mechanisms of 
injury. These included motorcycles, bicycles, snowmobiles, all-terrain vehicles, 
equestrian, water and alpine skiing, snowboarding, and others. Patients with 
preinjury bleeding disorder (BD), including warfarin and clopidogrel use, were 
compared with controls via a coarsened exact matching analysis. BD patients 
(294) were compared with 3929 controls. Although increased in BD patients, no 
significant mortality differences were observed in unmatched or matched 
analyses. BD patients yielded greater hospital length of stay (5 vs 4 days, P = 
0.020) with increased odds of receiving five units or more of blood (7.0% vs 
2.1%, odds ratio = 4.7, P < 0.001) and of deep vein thrombosis (7.6% vs 3.8%, 
odds ratio = 2.1, P = 0.018). Elderly patients with BD, including warfarin or 
clopidogrel use, do not seem to have significantly increased mortality after 
injury during specified recreational activities. BD patients had greater 
hospital length of stay, transfusion requirements, and deep vein thrombosis 
rates. These findings may inform counseling for those taking such medications as 
to the potential for adverse outcomes.

Recent discoveries have shown that harboring cells without the Y chromosome in 
the peripheral blood is associated with increased risk for all-cause mortality 
and disease such as different forms of cancer, Alzheimer's disease, as well as 
other conditions in aging men. In the entire world, the life expectancy of men 
is shorter compared to women, a sex difference that has been known for 
centuries, but the underlying mechanism(s) are not well understood. As a 
male-specific genetic risk factor, an increased risk for pathology and mortality 
associated with mosaic loss of chromosome Y (LOY) in blood cells could help to 
explain that men on average live shorter lives compared to women. This review 
primarily focuses on observed associations between LOY in blood and various 
diseases in aging men. Other topics covered are known risk factors for LOY, 
methods to detect LOY, and a discussion regarding mechanisms such as 
immunosurveillance, that could possibly explain how an acquired mutation in 
blood cells can be associated with disease processes in other organs.

INTRODUCTION: Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) is associated with high burden and 
healthcare costs. Virologic response achieved with antivirals is associated with 
progression avoidance. This study aimed to estimate the efficiency and clinical 
impact of antiviral strategies in CHB patients.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A Markov model estimated lifetime complications and direct 
costs in both, HBeAg-positive and HBeAg-negative cohorts. Strategy 1 (71% of 
treated population) and strategy 2 (100%), both based on pegylated interferon 
(peg-IFN) followed by oral tenofovir or entecavir, were compared to no 
treatment. Progression was based on HBV-DNA levels. Rescue therapy with oral 
antivirals was applied for peg-IFN failure. Disease costs (C, 2014) and 
utilities were obtained from literature.
RESULTS: Compared to natural history, strategy 1 increased QALY (3.98 in 
HBeAg-positive, 2.16 in -negative cohort). With strategy 2, survival was up to 
5.60 (HBeAg-positive) and 3.05 QALY (in HBeAg-negative). The model predicted 
avoidance of 128 and 86 carcinomas in HBeAg-positive and -negative patients with 
strategy 1, and up to 181 and 121 in HBeAg-positive and -negative for strategy 
2. Total cost increased up to C102,841 (strategy 1) and C105,408 (strategy 2) in 
HBeAg-positive, and C85,858 and C93,754 in HBeAg-negative. A C1,581/QALY gained 
ratio was estimated versus the natural history for both strategies. In 
conclusion, increasing antiviral coverage would be efficient, reducing 
complications.

Update of
    Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2001;(2):CD002202.

BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is one of the most common inherited 
diseases worldwide. It is associated with lifelong morbidity and a reduced life 
expectancy. Hydroxyurea (hydroxycarbamide), an oral chemotherapeutic drug, 
ameliorates some of the clinical problems of SCD, in particular that of pain, by 
raising fetal haemoglobin. This is an update of a previously published Cochrane 
Review.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of hydroxyurea therapy in people with SCD (all 
genotypes), of any age, regardless of setting.
SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders 
Group Haemoglobinopathies Register, comprising of references identified from 
comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals 
and abstract books of conference proceedings. We also searched online trial 
registries.Date of the most recent search: 16 January 2017.
SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials, of one 
month or longer, comparing hydroxyurea with placebo, standard therapy or other 
interventions for people with SCD.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Authors independently assessed studies for 
inclusion, carried out data extraction and assessed the risk of bias.
MAIN RESULTS: Seventeen studies were identified in the searches; eight 
randomised controlled trials were included, recruiting 899 adults and children 
with SCD (haemoglobin SS (HbSS), haemoglobin SC (HbSC) or haemoglobin 
Sβºthalassaemia (HbSβºthal) genotypes). Studies lasted from six to 30 
months.Four studies (577 adults and children with HbSS or HbSβºthal) compared 
hydroxyurea to placebo; three recruited individuals with only severe disease and 
one recruited individuals with all disease severities. There were statistically 
significant improvements in terms of pain alteration (using measures such as 
pain crisis frequency, duration, intensity, hospital admissions and opoid use), 
measures of fetal haemoglobin and neutrophil counts and fewer occurrences of 
acute chest syndrome and blood transfusions in the hydroxyurea groups. There 
were no consistent statistically significant differences in terms of quality of 
life and adverse events (including serious or life-threatening events). Seven 
deaths occurred during the studies, but the rates by treatment group were not 
statistically significantly different.Two studies (254 children with HbSS or 
HbSβºthal also with risk of primary or secondary stroke) compared hydroxyurea 
and phlebotomy to transfusion and chelation; there were statistically 
significant improvements in terms of measures of fetal haemoglobin and 
neutrophil counts, but more occurrences of acute chest syndrome and infections 
in the hydroxyurea and phlebotomy group. There were no consistent statistically 
significant differences in terms of pain alteration and adverse events 
(including serious or life-threatening events). Two deaths occurred during the 
studies (one in a the hydroxyurea treatment arm and one in the control arm), but 
the rates by treatment group were not statistically significantly different. In 
the primary prevention study, no strokes occurred in either treatment group but 
in the secondary prevention study, seven strokes occurred in the hydroxyurea and 
phlebotomy group (none in the transfusion and chelation group) and the study was 
terminated early.The quality of the evidence for the above two comparisons was 
judged as moderate to low as the studies contributing to these comparisons were 
mostly large and well designed (and at low risk of bias); however evidence was 
limited and imprecise for some outcomes such as quality of life, deaths during 
the studies and adverse events and results are applicable only to individuals 
with HbSS and HbSβºthal genotypes.Of the remaining two studies, one (22 children 
with HbSS or HbSβºthal also at risk of stoke) compared hydroxyurea to 
observation; there were statistically significant improvements in terms of 
measures of fetal haemoglobin and neutrophil counts but no statistically 
significant differences in terms of adverse events (including serious or 
life-threatening events).The final study (44 adults and children with HbSC) 
compared treatment regimens with and without hydroxyurea - there was 
statistically significant improvement in terms of measures of fetal haemoglobin, 
but no statistically significant differences in terms of adverse events 
(including serious or life-threatening events). No participants died in either 
of these studies and other outcomes relevant to the review were not reported.The 
quality of the evidence for the above two comparisons was judged to be very low 
due to the limited number of participants, the lack of statistical power (as 
both studies were terminated early with approximately only 20% of their target 
sample size recruited) and the lack of applicability to all age groups and 
genotypes.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is evidence to suggest that hydroxyurea is effective 
in decreasing the frequency of pain episodes and other acute complications in 
adults and children with sickle cell anaemia of HbSS or HbSβºthal genotypes and 
in preventing life-threatening neurological events in those with sickle cell 
anaemia at risk of primary stroke by maintaining transcranial doppler 
velocities. However, there is still insufficient evidence on the long-term 
benefits of hydroxyurea, particularly in preventing chronic complications of 
SCD, recommending a standard dose or dose escalation to maximum tolerated dose. 
There is also insufficient evidence about the long-term risks of hydroxyurea, 
including its effects on fertility and reproduction. Evidence is also limited on 
the effects of hydroxyurea on individuals with HbSC genotype. Future studies 
should be designed to address such uncertainties.

AIMS: This study assessed the cost-effectiveness of ezetimibe with statin 
therapy vs statin monotherapy from a US payer perspective, assuming the 
impending patent expiration of ezetimibe.
METHODS: A Markov-like economic model consisting of 28 distinct health states 
was used. Model population data were obtained from US linked claims and 
electronic medical records, with inclusion criteria based on diagnostic 
guidelines. Inputs came from recent clinical trials, meta-analyses, and 
cost-effectiveness analyses. The base-case scenario was used to evaluate the 
cost-effectiveness of adding ezetimibe 10 mg to statin in patients aged 35-74 
years with a history of coronary heart disease (CHD) and/or stroke, and with 
low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels ≥70 mg/dL over a lifetime 
horizon, assuming a 90% price reduction of ezetimibe after 1 year to take into 
account the impending patent expiration in the second quarter of 2017. Sub-group 
analyses included patients with LDL-C levels ≥100 mg/dL and patients with 
diabetes with LDL-C levels ≥70 mg/dL.
RESULTS: The lifetime discounted incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for 
ezetimibe added to statin was $9,149 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) for 
the base-case scenario. For patients with LDL-C levels ≥100 mg/dL, the ICER was 
$839/QALY; for those with diabetes and LDL-C levels ≥70 mg/dL, it was $560/QALY. 
One-way sensitivity analyses showed that the model was sensitive to changes in 
cost of ezetimibe, rate reduction of non-fatal CHD, and utility weight for 
non-fatal CHD in the base-case and sub-group analyses.
LIMITATIONS: Indirect costs or treatment discontinuation estimation were not 
included.
CONCLUSIONS: Compared with statin monotherapy, ezetimibe with statin therapy was 
cost-effective for secondary prevention of CHD and stroke and for primary 
prevention of these conditions in patients whose LDL-C levels are ≥100 mg/dL and 
in patients with diabetes, taking into account a 90% cost reduction for 
ezetimibe.

Subjective Time Perceptions and Aging Well: A Review of Concepts and Empirical 
Research - A Mini-Review.

Gabrian M(1), Dutt AJ, Wahl HW.

Heidelberg, Germany.

Human beings impose subjective, time-related interpretations on their existence, 
and the experience of time is a major aspect of lifespan development. In this 
mini-review, we understand subjective time as the way individuals subjectively 
perceive and evaluate the passing of their personal "objective" lifetime. A 
broad range of constructs and operationalizations has been developed in (gero-) 
psychology to capture subjective time, including future time perspective, 
personal goals, or autobiographical memories. In order to theoretically 
integrate this yet loosely connected body of literature, we propose a conceptual 
model of subjective time concepts according to 2 dimensions: temporal direction 
(past, present, future) and thematic field (duration/expansion, time-ordered 
life content, and time-related evaluations, attitudes, and mindsets). This 
conceptual model of subjective time perceptions builds the foundation for a 
review of the empirical literature regarding associations of subjective time 
with developmental outcomes (i.e., subjective well-being and physical health) in 
middle and late adulthood. Empirical findings establish subjective time concepts 
as a consistent predictor of well-being and health. Positive subjective time 
perceptions (i.e., an expanded view of the future, a focus on positive past and 
future life content, and favorable time-related evaluations) were associated 
with higher well-being and better physical health, while negative subjective 
time perceptions in general were linked to lower levels of health and 
well-being. Contrasting past- and future-oriented subjective time perceptions, 
it appears that past-oriented subjective time perceptions have been studied 
primarily in relation to subjective well-being, while future-oriented time 
perceptions play a key role both with regard to physical health and well-being. 
In conclusion, we argue that a stronger integration of subjective time 
constructs into developmental regulation models may deepen our understanding of 
human development across the lifespan. To this end, we call for theoretical and 
empirical interlinkages between yet loosely connected conceptual developments 
related to subjective time. These endeavors should be paralleled by an extension 
of methodological procedures (e.g., implementation of longitudinal research 
designs as well as a focus on the oldest-old) in order to inform a "lifespan 
theory of subjective time."

Caloric Restriction-Induced Extension of Chronological Lifespan Requires Intact 
Respiration in Budding Yeast.

Caloric restriction (CR) has been shown to extend lifespan and prevent cellular 
senescence in various species ranging from yeast to humans. Many effects of CR 
may contribute to extend lifespan. Specifically, CR prevents oxidative damage 
from reactive oxygen species (ROS) by enhancing mitochondrial function. In this 
study, we characterized 33 single electron transport chain (ETC) gene-deletion 
strains to identify CR-induced chronological lifespan (CLS) extension 
mechanisms. Interestingly, defects in 17 of these 33 ETC gene-deleted strains 
showed loss of both respiratory function and CR-induced CLS extension. On the 
contrary, the other 16 respiration-capable mutants showed increased CLS upon CR 
along with increased mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and intracellular 
adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels, with decreased mitochondrial superoxide 
generation. We measured the same parameters in the 17 non-respiratory mutants 
upon CR. CR simultaneously increased MMP and mitochondrial superoxide generation 
without altering intracellular ATP levels. In conclusion, respiration is 
essential for CLS extension by CR and is important for balancing MMP, ROS, and 
ATP levels.

BACKGROUND: Bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is associated with a 
greater likelihood of survival to hospital discharge after out-of-hospital 
cardiac arrest (OHCA). However the long-term survival benefits in relationship 
to cost have not been well-studied. We evaluated bystander CPR, hospital-based 
costs, and long-term survival following OHCA in order to assess the potential 
cost-effectiveness of bystander CPR.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of consecutive 
EMS-treated OHCA patients >=12years who arrested prior to EMS arrival and 
outside a nursing facility between 2001 and 2010 in greater King County, WA. 
Utstein-style information was obtained from the EMS registry, including 5-year 
survival. Costs from the OHCA hospitalization were obtained from the Washington 
State Comprehensive Hospital Abstract Reporting System. Cost effectiveness was 
based on hospital costs divided by quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) for a 
5-year follow-up window.
RESULTS: Of the 4448 eligible patients, 18.5% (n=824) were discharged alive from 
hospital and 12.1% (n=539) were alive at 5 years. Five-year survival was higher 
in patients who received bystander CPR (14.3% vs. 8.7%, p<0.001) translating to 
an average 0.09 QALYs associated with bystander CPR. The average (SD) total cost 
of the initial acute care hospitalization was USD 19,961 (40,498) for all 
admitted patients and USD 75,175 (52,276) for patients alive at year 5. The 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio associated with bystander CPR was USD 
48,044 per QALY.
CONCLUSION: Based on this population-based investigation, bystander CPR was 
positively associated with long-term survival and appears cost-effective.

Actinic keratosis (AK) is a common reason for consultation in both Primary Care 
and Specialised Care. It is the third or fourth most common reason for 
consultation in dermatology, accounting for up to 5-6% of patients attended. It 
has also been observed that its prevalence has been increasing in the last 
10years, compared to other dermatoses. This is also expected to continue to 
increase due to longer life expectancy, and by the changes in sun exposure 
habits since the middle of the last century. The aim of this article is to 
update the concepts of AK, cancerisation field and to present the currently 
available therapeutic tools.

La queratosis actínica (QA) es motivo de consulta frecuente tanto en atención 
primaria como en atención especializada. Supone el tercer o cuarto motivo más 
frecuente de consulta en dermatología, llegando a representar hasta un 5-6% de 
los pacientes atendidos. Además, se ha observado que esta prevalencia ha ido en 
aumento en los últimos 10 años, en comparación con otras dermatosis, y se prevé 
que seguirá aumentado por la mayor esperanza de vida y por los cambios de 
hábitos de exposición solar acontecidos desde mediados del siglo pasado. El 
objetivo de este artículo es actualizar los conceptos de QA y de campo de 
cancerización, y exponer las herramientas terapéuticas disponibles actualmente.

PURPOSE: To assess socioeconomic disparity in global burden of cataract, by 
using disability-adjusted life years (DALYs).
DESIGN: International, comparative burden-of-disease study.
METHODS: Published data on national age-standardized DALY rates caused by 
cataract and human development index (HDI) between 1990 and 2013 were obtained. 
The association between age-standardized DALY rates and HDI in 2013 was 
analyzed. The health-related Gini coefficients and the concentration indexes 
were calculated to explore the trends in between-country inequality in cataract 
burden from 1990 to 2013.
RESULTS: Multiple comparison revealed that lower-HDI countries had higher 
age-standardized DALY rates caused by cataract. Age-standardized DALY rates were 
inversely associated with HDI (β = -0.522, P < .01). From 1990 to 2013, global 
age-standardized DALY rates showed a trend of decline, whereas the Gini 
coefficients increased from 0.409 to 0.439. The concentration indexes indicated 
that socioeconomic-associated inequality declined in the 1990s and subsequently 
increased since 2000, with values of -0.259 in 1990, -0.244 in 2000, and -0.273 
in 2013.
CONCLUSIONS: Global health progress in cataract was accompanied by widening 
inequality, with cataract burden being more concentrated in countries with lower 
socioeconomic status. The findings highlight the need to provide more cataract 
services for developing countries, to combat global vision loss caused by 
cataract.

disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and years lived with disability (YLDs).
DESIGN: Systematic analysis of all open-access data.
SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Public and philanthropic funding to all UK cancer 
research institutions, 2000-2013.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Number and financial value of cancer research investments 
reported in 2013 UK pounds (UK£). Mortality, DALYs and YLDs data were acquired 
from the Global Burden of Disease Study. A compound metric was adapted to 
estimate research investment relative to disease burden as measured by 
mortality, DALYs and YLDs.
RESULTS: We identified 4299 funded studies with a total research investment of 
£2.4 billion. The highest fundings by anatomical sites were haematological, 
breast, prostate, colorectal and ovarian cancers. Relative to disease burden as 
determined by a compound metric combining mortality, DALYs and YLDs, 
gender-specific cancers were found to be highest funded-the five sites that 
received the most funding were prostate, ovarian, breast, mesothelioma and 
testicular cancer; the least well-funded sites were liver, thyroid, lung, upper 
gastrointestinal (GI) and bladder. Preclinical science accounted for 66.2% of 
award numbers and 62.2% of all funding. The top five areas of primary research 
focus by funding were pathogenesis, drug therapy, diagnostic, screening and 
monitoring, women's health and immunology. The largest individual funder was the 
Medical Research Council. In combination, the five lowest funded site-specific 
cancers relative to disease burden account for 47.9%, 44.3% and 20.4% of 
worldwide cancer mortality, DALYs and YLDs.
CONCLUSIONS: Research funding for cancer is not allocated according to relative 
disease burden. These findings are in line with earlier published studies. 
Funding agencies and industry should openly document their research investments 
to improve better targeting of research investment.

The finite state projection approach to analyze dynamics of heterogeneous 
populations.

Bioinformatics, Imperial College London, London SW7 2AZ, United Kingdom.

Population modeling aims to capture and predict the dynamics of cell populations 
in constant or fluctuating environments. At the elementary level, population 
growth proceeds through sequential divisions of individual cells. Due to 
stochastic effects, populations of cells are inherently heterogeneous in 
phenotype, and some phenotypic variables have an effect on division or survival 
rates, as can be seen in partial drug resistance. Therefore, when modeling 
population dynamics where the control of growth and division is phenotype 
dependent, the corresponding model must take account of the underlying cellular 
heterogeneity. The finite state projection (FSP) approach has often been used to 
analyze the statistics of independent cells. Here, we extend the FSP analysis to 
explore the coupling of cell dynamics and biomolecule dynamics within a 
population. This extension allows a general framework with which to model the 
state occupations of a heterogeneous, isogenic population of dividing and 
expiring cells. The method is demonstrated with a simple model of cell-cycle 
progression, which we use to explore possible dynamics of drug resistance 
phenotypes in dividing cells. We use this method to show how stochastic 
single-cell behaviors affect population level efficacy of drug treatments, and 
we illustrate how slight modifications to treatment regimens may have dramatic 
effects on drug efficacy.

Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences.

The prevalence of unruptured cerebral aneurysms (UCAs) in elderly patients is 
increasing in our aging population. UCA management in elderly patients has some 
difficulties, such as reduced life expectancy, increased comorbidities and 
treatment risks, and poor prognosis in case of rupture. In this review article, 
we summarize the most recent findings on the natural history, therapeutic 
options and treatment results for UCAs exclusively in elderly patients, and 
describe possible medical treatments for patients with UCAs.

[Neurolysis and Spinal Analgesia in Cancer Pain Management].

[Article in Japanese]

Hattori S(1), Tachibana J.

Author information:
(1)Dept. of Cancer Pain Management, Cancer Institute Hospital of JFCR.

Cancer pain appears as a complex pain and often progressive.WhenWHO pain 
management strategy and/or palliative care failed to relieve their pain, 
patients are given high dose opioids or anonymous adjuvant drugs and have no 
chance to meet specialized pain treatment. This section briefly covers the 
outline of neurolysis and spinal analgesia for these cancer patients with severe 
pain. Purpose of nerve block and neurolysis are to block the incoming signal of 
pain in order to reduce pain, reduce analgesic dose, recover ADL, and finally to 
be discharged from the hospital. However, autonomic nervous system, sensory 
nerves, and motor function could be impaired at the same time. Careful selection 
of candidate should be considered by the pain specialists. Spinal analgesia is 
indicated when, conservative pain treatment failed to reduce pain, wide range or 
multiple pain area, and when contraindicated for neurolysis. Epidural analgesia 
is preferred for in-hospital treatment and intrathecal analgesia for home care 
settings. Many cancer pain patients' life expectancy is not long enough to 
postpone the indication of these invasive techniques. If you seek to maintain 
patients' quality of life(QOL), one should consider these procedures at some 
point, although it may not be indicated.

Morphogenesis of honeybee hypopharyngeal gland during pupal development.

Humboldt University, Philippstrasse 13, 10115 Berlin, Germany.

BACKGROUND: The hypopharyngeal gland of worker bees contributes to the 
production of the royal jelly fed to queens and larvae. The gland consists of 
thousands of two-cell units that are composed of a secretory cell and a duct 
cell and that are arranged in sets of about 12 around a long collecting duct.
RESULTS: By fluorescent staining, we have examined the morphogenesis of the 
hypopharyngeal gland during pupal life, from a saccule lined by a 
pseudostratified epithelium to the elaborate organ of adult worker bees. The 
hypopharyngeal gland develops as follows. (1) Cell proliferation occurs during 
the first day of pupal life in the hypopharyngeal gland primordium. (2) 
Subsequently, the epithelium becomes organized into rosette-like units of three 
cells. Two of these will become the secretory cell and the duct cell of the 
adult secretory units; the third cell contributes only temporarily to the 
development of the secretory units and is eliminated by apoptosis in the second 
half of pupal life. (3) The three-cell units of flask-shaped cells undergo 
complex changes in cell morphology. Thus, by mid-pupal stage, the gland is 
structurally similar to the adult hypopharyngeal gland. (4) Concomitantly, the 
prospective secretory cell attains its characteristic subcellular organization 
by the invagination of a small patch of apical membrane domain, its extension to 
a tube of about 100 μm in length (termed a canaliculus), and the expansion of 
the tube to a diameter of about 3 μm. (6) Finally, the canaliculus-associated 
F-actin system becomes reorganized into rings of bundled actin filaments that 
are positioned at regular distances along the membrane tube.
CONCLUSIONS: The morphogenesis of the secretory units in the hypopharyngeal 
gland of the worker bee seems to be based on a developmental program that is 
conserved, with slight modification, among insects for the production of dermal 
glands. Elaboration of the secretory cell as a unicellular seamless epithelial 
tube occurs by invagination of the apical membrane, its extension likely by 
targeted exocytosis and its expansion, and finally the reorganisation of the 
membrane-associated F-actin system. Our work is fundamental for future studies 
of environmental effects on hypopharyngeal gland morphology and development.

Global pattern of plant utilization across different organisms: Does plant 
apparency or plant phylogeny matter?

The present study is the first to consider human and nonhuman consumers together 
to reveal several general patterns of plant utilization. We provide evidence 
that at a global scale, plant apparency and phylogenetic isolation can be 
important predictors of plant utilization and consumer diversity. Using the 
number of species or genera or the distribution area of each plant family as the 
island "area" and the minimum phylogenetic distance to common plant families as 
the island "distance", we fitted presence-area relationships and 
presence-distance relationships with a binomial GLM (generalized linear model) 
with a logit link. The presence-absence of consumers among each plant family 
strongly depended on plant apparency (family size and distribution area); the 
diversity of consumers increased with plant apparency but decreased with 
phylogenetic isolation. When consumers extended their host breadth, unapparent 
plants became more likely to be used. Common uses occurred more often on common 
plants and their relatives, showing higher host phylogenetic clustering than 
uncommon uses. On the contrary, highly specialized uses might be related to the 
rarity of plant chemicals and were therefore very species-specific. In summary, 
our results provide a global illustration of plant-consumer combinations and 
reveal several general patterns of plant utilization across humans, insects and 
microbes. First, plant apparency and plant phylogenetic isolation generally 
govern plant utilization value, with uncommon and isolated plants suffering 
fewer parasites. Second, extension of the breadth of utilized hosts helps 
explain the presence of consumers on unapparent plants. Finally, the 
phylogenetic clustering structure of host plants is different between common 
uses and uncommon uses. The strength of such consistent plant utilization 
patterns across a diverse set of usage types suggests that the persistence and 
accumulation of consumer diversity and use value for plant species are 
determined by similar ecological and evolutionary processes.

Dental geriatrics and periodontitis.

Persson GR.

The present literature review is focused on two main areas: (i) periodontal 
conditions in older individuals; and (ii) the scientific data available on 
periodontal treatment outcomes in individuals ≥ 75 years of age. The population 
of older people is increasing but the data on periodontal therapies and their 
efficacy in this population are limited and need to be carefully reviewed. 
Although life expectancy has increased, this does not mean that older people are 
medically healthy. Several chronic systemic diseases are associated with 
periodontitis, and the prevalence of most chronic diseases increases with age. 
Furthermore, older people are challenged by impaired immunity (immune 
senescence) with a decline in the numbers of naïve T-cells in peripheral blood 
and lymphoid tissues. The most frequent significant correlates with successful 
ageing include not smoking and the absence of disability, arthritis and diabetes 
mellitus. Periodontal diseases in older individuals may have specific features 
that are not consistent with periodontal diseases. In this respect, data suggest 
that gingival lesions in older individuals develop differently from gingival 
lesions in younger adults. The progression of periodontitis may be slower in 
older individuals, and older individuals with periodontitis may benefit from 
more conservative treatment approaches. Diagnostic criteria used for the 
assessment and diagnosis of periodontitis in younger adults may not be fully 
applicable in older individuals. In summary, declining health, perception of 
treatment needs, dietary changes, comorbidity with other diseases and immune 
senescence are challenging factors to clinicians and researchers, in terms of 
therapies and in understanding periodontitis etiology in older individuals.

Introduction Malignant rhabdoid tumor (MRT) is defined as a high-grade sarcoma 
derived from an uncertain cell of origin. Its diagnosis is associated with poor 
prognosis and patient's life expectancy is greatly reduced. Material and method 
Here, we describe a unique case of 9-month-old boy who presented with a large 
MRT arising from the soft tissue of the neck. Following intensive multimodal 
treatment, the patient benefited from a 25 years' remission until the discovery 
of multiple liver metastases. Conclusion MRT of soft tissue needs to be 
distinguished from other soft tissue neoplasms, as MRT is highly aggressive and 
is usually associated with a poor outcome. In addition, this is the longest 
remission time reported in a patient with soft tissue MRT and this might be 
related to the use of early intensive multimodal treatments.

In the World Health Organization (WHO)-coordinated Cardiovascular Disease and 
Alimentary Comparison Study, isoflavones (I; biomarker for dietary soy) and 
taurine (T; biomarker for dietary fish) in 24-hour-urine (24U) were inversely 
related to coronary heart disease (CHD) mortality. High levels of these 
biomarkers are found in Japanese people, whose CHD mortality is lowest among 
developed countries. We analyzed the association of these biomarkers with 
cardiovascular disease risk in the Japanese to know their health effects within 
one ethnic population. First, to compare the Japanese intake of I and T with 
international intakes, the ratios of 24UI and 24UT to creatinine from the WHO 
Study were divided into quintiles for analysis. The ratio for the Japanese was 
the highest in the highest quintiles for both I and T, reaching 88.1%, far 
higher than the average ratio for the Japanese (26.3%) in the total study 
population. Second, 553 inhabitants of Hyogo Prefecture, Japan, aged 30 to 79 
years underwent 24-U collection and blood analyses. The 24UT and 24UI were 
divided into tertiles and adjusted for age and sex. The highest T tertile, 
compared with the lowest tertile, showed significantly higher levels of 
high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C), total cholesterol, 24U sodium (Na) 
and potassium (K). The highest I tertile showed significantly higher folate, 
24UNa and 24UK compared with the lowest tertile. The highest tertile of both T 
and I showed significantly higher HDL-C, folate, and 24UNa and 24UK compared 
with the lowest tertile. Thus, greater consumption of fish and soy were 
significantly associated with higher HDL-C and folate levels, possibly a 
contributor to Japan having the lowest CHD mortality and longest life expectancy 
among developed countries. As these intakes were also associated with a high 
intake of salt, a low-salt intake of fish and soy should be recommended for 
healthy life expectancy.

: In Europe, over 70% of the population live in urban areas (UAs). Most 
international comparative health research is done using national level data, as 
reliable and comparable urban data are often unavailable or difficult to access. 
This study aims to investigate whether population health is different in UAs 
compared with their corresponding countries. : Routinely available 
health-related data were collected by the EURO-URHIS 2 project, for 10 European 
countries and for 24 UAs within those countries. National and UA level data for 
11 health indicators were compared through the calculation of relative 
difference, and geographical patterns within Europe were investigated using the 
Mann Whitney U test. Linear regression modelling was used to adjust for 
population density, gross domestic product and urbanicity. : In general, the 
urban population in Eastern Europe is less healthy than the Western European 
urban population. However, people in Eastern Europe have significantly better 
broad health outcomes in UAs as compared with the corresponding country as a 
whole, whereas people in Western Europe have generally worse broader health 
outcomes in UAs. : For most European countries and UAs that were investigated, 
the national level health status data does not correspond with the health status 
at UA level. In order to identify health problems in UAs and to provide 
information for local health policy, health monitoring and international 
benchmarking should also be conducted at the local level.

The advantageous biological properties of hydroxyethyl starch (HES) triggered 
research interest toward the design and synthesis of drug delivery systems 
(DDSs) based on this polysaccharide. Convenient reaction schemes, including 
one-step reactions, led to the synthesis of HES conjugates with selected 
anticancer molecules or therapeutic proteins. Nanocapsules and hydrogels based 
on HES were also prepared and studied as prospective drug delivery systems. 
Formulations originating from these drug conjugates and also from nanocapsules 
and hydrogels loaded with drugs were characterized, highlighting the extension 
of their half-life in plasma, which is a critical property as far as their 
efficacy is concerned. Results obtained in vitro and in vivo proved promising, 
justifying the undertaking of additional experiments with such systems, 
including their multifunctionalization. The promising formulations that are 
discussed in this Topical Review is expected to further increase interest in 
applying HES for molecular constructing novel DDSs with enhanced efficacy, which 
may, in the future, find clinical applications.

Design and fuzzy logic control of an active wrist orthosis.

Kilic E(1), Dogan E(1).

Author information:

Turkey.

People who perform excessive wrist movements throughout the day because of their 
professions have a higher risk of developing lateral and medial epicondylitis. 
If proper precautions are not taken against these diseases, serious consequences 
such as job loss and early retirement can occur. In this study, the design and 
control of an active wrist orthosis that is mobile, powerful and lightweight is 
presented as a means to avoid the occurrence and/or for the treatment of 
repetitive strain injuries in an effective manner. The device has an 
electromyography-based control strategy so that the user's intention always 
comes first. In fact, the device-user interaction is mainly activated by the 
electromyography signals measured from the forearm muscles that are responsible 
for the extension and flexion wrist movements. Contractions of the muscles are 
detected using surface electromyography sensors, and the desired quantity of the 
velocity value of the wrist is extracted from a fuzzy logic controller. Then, 
the actuator system of the device comes into play by conveying the necessary 
motion support to the wrist. Experimental studies show that the presented device 
actually reduces the demand on the muscles involved in repetitive strain
