transmyocardial laser revascularization was applied due to disseminated coronary 
artery disease. The in-hospital mortality stood at 1.98%, however there were no 
cardiac deaths reported. The postoperative MACCE incidence was 6.94% due to 6 
cases of myocardial infarction, and 1 case of acute stroke. The in-hospital 
mortality was 1.98%. Other postoperative complications occurred as follows: 
rethoracotomy (2.9%), blood products transfusions (69.3%), prolonged mechanical 
ventilation (9.9%), atrial fibrillation (15.8%), deep wound infection (3.96%), 
sternal dehiscence (1.98%).
CONCLUSIONS: Technique of TAMR in coronary artery bypass grafting is a safe 
method in low-risk patients over 70 years old and can be performed with good 
short-term outcome. Further evaluation analyzing the long-term benefits in 
elderly patients of TAMR is warranted.

Purpose: To comparatively evaluate the results of a 2-dose human papillomavirus 
(HPV) vaccination programme with the AS04-adjuvanted HPV16/18 vaccine 
(AS04-HPV-16/18v) or HPV-6/11/16/18 vaccine (4vHPVv), in addition to cervical 
cancer (CC) screening, in Malaysia. Methods: A lifetime Markov model replicating 
the natural history of HPV in 13-year-old girls was adapted to Malaysia to 
assess the impact of vaccination on pre-cancerous lesions, genital warts and CC 
cases, CC deaths, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and costs from the 
perspective of the Malaysian Ministry of Health. Vaccine effectiveness was based 
on efficacy and HPV type distribution. Both vaccines were assumed to have equal 
efficacy against vaccine-type HPV but differed for protection against 
non-vaccine types. Vaccine price parity was used and health and cost outcomes 
were discounted at 3%/annum. Sensitivity analyses tested the robustness of the 
results. Results: The model predicted that AS04-HPV-16/18v would result in 361 
fewer CC cases and 115 fewer CC deaths than 4vHPVv, whereas 4vHPVv averted 4,241 
cases of genital warts over the cohort’s lifetime. Discounted total costs showed 
savings of 18.50 million Malaysian Ringgits and 246 QALYs in favour of 
AS04-HPV-16/18v. In one-way sensitivity analyses, the discount rate was the most 
influential variable for costs and QALYs, but AS04-HPV- 16/18v remained dominant 
throughout. A two-way sensitivity analysis to assess the longevity of 
cross-protection for both vaccines confirmed the base-case. Conclusions: In 
Malaysia, the use of AS04-HPV-16/18v, in addition to screening, was modelled to 
be dominant over 4vHPVv, with greater estimated CC benefits and lower costs.

AIM: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of aripiprazole once-monthly 400/300 mg 
(AOM 400) in maintenance monotherapy treatment of bipolar I disorder (BP-I).
METHODS: A de novo lifetime Markov model was developed for BP-I using available 
data for AOM 400 and relevant comparators. Base-case analysis considered costs 
and outcomes from the US payer perspective.
RESULTS: The cost per quality-adjusted life year gained with AOM 400 versus 
comparators ranged from US$2007 versus oral asenapine to dominance (i.e., lower 
cost with quality-adjusted life gain) versus long-acting injectable risperidone, 
paliperidone palmitate, oral cariprazine and best supportive care. Patients 
treated with AOM 400 were estimated to have fewer mood episodes and 
hospitalizations per patient (5.37) than comparators (6.33, asenapine or 
cariprazine; 6.54, risperidone long-acting injectable; 7.64, paliperidone 
palmitate; and 8.93, best supportive care). Sensitivity analyses showed results 
were robust to parameter uncertainty.
CONCLUSION: AOM 400 may be considered cost effective in the maintenance 
monotherapy treatment of BP-I in adults.

BACKGROUND: A data collection tool was developed and nationally deployed to 
clinical pharmacists (CPs) working in advanced practice provider roles within 
the Department of Veterans Affairs to document interventions and associated 
clinical outcomes. Intervention and short-term clinical outcome data derived 
from the tool were used to populate a validated clinical outcomes modeling 
program to predict long-term clinical and economic effects.
OBJECTIVE: To predict the long-term effect of CP-provided pharmacotherapy 
management on outcomes and costs for patients with type 2 diabetes.
METHODS: Baseline patient demographics and biomarkers were extracted for type 2 
diabetic patients having > 1 encounter with a CP using the tool between January 
5, 2013, and November 20, 2014. Treatment biomarker values were extracted 12 
months after the patient's initial visit with the CP. The number of visits with 
the CP was extracted from the electronic medical record, and duration of visit 
time was quantified by Current Procedural Terminology codes. Simulation modeling 
was performed on 3 patient cohorts-those with a baseline hemoglobin A1c of 8% to 
< 9%, 9% to < 10%, and ≥ 10%-to estimate long-term cost and clinical outcomes 
using modeling based on pivotal trial data (the Archimedes Model). A sensitivity 
analysis was conducted to assess the extent to which our results were dependent 
on assumptions related to program effectiveness and costs.
RESULTS: A total of 7,310 patients were included in the analysis. Analysis of 
costs and events on 2-, 3-, 5-, and 10-year time horizons demonstrated 
significant reductions in major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs), 
myocardial infarctions (MIs), episodes of acute heart failure, foot ulcers, and 
foot amputations in comparison with a control group receiving usual 
guideline-directed medical care. In the cohort with a baseline A1c of ≥ 10%, the 
absolute risk reduction was 1.82% for MACE, 1.73% for MI, 2.43% for acute heart 
failure, 5.38% for foot ulcers, and 2.03% for foot amputations. The incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios for cost per quality-adjusted life-year during the 2-, 
3-, 5-, and 10-year time horizons were cost-effective for the cohorts of 
patients with a baseline A1c of 9% to < 10% and ≥ 10%.
CONCLUSIONS: CPs acting as advanced practice providers reduced A1c from baseline 
for veterans with type 2 diabetes compared with modeled usual care. Archimedes 
modeling of the A1c reductions projects a decreased incidence of diabetes 
complications and overall health care spending when compared with modeled usual 
care.

BACKGROUND: In this study, we investigated whether there has been an improvement 
in premature mortality due to central nervous system (CNS) cancers among the 
Canadian population from 1980 through 2010.
METHODS: Mortality data for CNS cancers were obtained from World Health 
Organization mortality database. Years of life lost (YLL) was estimated using 
Canadian life tables. Average lifespan shortened (ALSS) was calculated and 
defined as the ratio of YLL relative to the expected lifespan.
RESULTS: Over this study period, we observed decreases in age standardized rates 
to the World Standard Population for mortality due to CNS cancers from 5.3 to 
4.1 per 100,000 men, and from 3.6 to 2.9 per 100,000 women. Average YLL 
decreased from 23.6 to 21.5 years of life among men, and from 27.0 to 23.1 years 
among women in 1980 and 2010, respectively. The ALSS showed that men with CNS 
cancers lost 30.1% of their life span and women lost 32.5% in 1980, whereas they 
lost 25.8 and 26.6% in 2010, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Our study shows that -Canadian people with CNS cancers have had 
their lives prolonged at the end of the study period.

BACKGROUND: The Basque Colorectal Cancer Screening Programme began in 2009 and 
the implementation has been complete since 2013. Faecal immunological testing 
was used for screening in individuals between 50 and 69 years old. Colorectal 
Cancer in Basque country is characterized by unusual epidemiological features 
given that Colorectal Cancer incidence is similar to other European countries 
while adenoma prevalence is higher. The object of our study was to economically 
evaluate the programme via cost-effectiveness and budget impact analyses with 
microsimulation models.
METHODS: We applied the Microsimulation Screening Analysis (MISCAN)-Colon model 
to predict trends in Colorectal Cancer incidence and mortality and to quantify 
the short- and long-term effects and costs of the Basque Colorectal Cancer 
Screening Programme. The model was calibrated to the Basque demographics in 2008 
and age-specific Colorectal Cancer incidence data in the Basque Cancer Registry 
from 2005 to 2008 before the screening begun. The model was also calibrated to 
the high adenoma prevalence observed for the Basque population in a previously 
published study. The multi-cohort approach used in the model included all the 
cohorts in the programme during 30 years of implementation, with lifetime 
follow-up. Unit costs were obtained from the Basque Health Service and both 
cost-effectiveness analysis and budget impact analysis were carried out.
RESULTS: The goodness-of-fit of the model adaptation to observed programme data 
was evidence of validation. In the cost-effectiveness analysis, the savings from 
treatment were larger than the added costs due to screening. Thus, the Basque 
programme was dominant compared to no screening, as life expectancy increased by 
29.3 days per person. The savings in the budget analysis appeared 10 years after 
the complete implementation of the programme. The average annual budget was 
€73.4 million from year 2023 onwards.
CONCLUSIONS: This economic evaluation showed a screening intervention with a 
major health gain that also produced net savings when a long follow-up was used 
to capture the late economic benefit. The number of colonoscopies required was 
high but remain within the capacity of the Basque Health Service. So far in 
Europe, no other population Colorectal Cancer screening programme has been 
evaluated by budget impact analysis.

Bosutinib in chronic myeloid leukemia: patient selection and perspectives.

Faculty at the RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany.

During recent years, the therapeutic landscape in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) 
has changed significantly. Since the clinical introduction of tyrosine kinase 
inhibitors (TKIs) approximately 15 years ago, patients' concerns have shifted 
from reduced life expectancy toward long-term toxicities of TKI, depth of 
remission, and the probability of successful treatment discontinuation. Patients 
with newly diagnosed CML in chronic phase (at least with a Sokal score not 
exceeding intermediate) may now expect an almost normal life expectancy. 
However, even if almost 30% of all newly diagnosed chronic-phase patients might 
eventually be facing the prospect of a life without CML-specific treatment, 
based on current knowledge, most, if not all, patients would have to undergo an 
expected minimum of 5-8 years of TKI treatment and the majority would face a 
life-long exposure to the side-effects of TKIs. At present, 5 different TKIs are 
licensed for the treatment of CML, that is, imatinib, which is a 
first-generation TKI (including its generic derivatives); nilotinib, dasatinib, 
and bosutinib, which are second-generation TKIs; as well as ponatinib, which is 
a so-called third-generation TKI and is supposed to be used for patients 
harboring the T315I-mutation. One of the important, yet unanswered questions is 
the choice of the best possible TKI upfront for each individual patient. 
Bosutinib is currently licensed for patients with CML after failure or 
intolerance of at least 2 other TKIs. It can also be prescribed according to 
label if after failure of the first TKI therapy, another option does not seem 
feasible. This review focuses on the existing data on clinical efficacy, 
tolerability, and side effects of bosutinib treatment in CML patients with the 
aim to identify patient characteristics and treatment scenarios most suitable 
for treatment with bosutinib.

BACKGROUND: The stepped wedge trial (SWT) design is a type of the randomized 
clinical trial (RCT) design in which clusters or individuals are randomly and 
sequentially crossed over from control to intervention over a number of time 
periods. Trials using SWT design have become increasingly popular in medical, 
behavioral and social sciences research. Therefore, complete and transparent 
reporting of these studies is crucial. In particular, the quality of the 
abstracts of their reports is important because these may be the only accessible 
sources for their results.
OBJECTIVE: The aims of this survey were to evaluate the reporting quality of SWT 
abstracts and to identify factors contributing to better reporting quality.
METHODS: We performed literature searches to identify relevant articles in 
English published from November 1987 to October 2016 in the following electronic 
databases: Medline, Embase, Web of Science, CINAHL, and PsycINFO. At least two 
reviewers examined the quality of abstract reporting using the 17-item CONSORT 
(CONsolidated Standards Of Reporting Trials) Extension for Abstracts tool. 
Poisson regression models for incidence rate ratio (IRR) were used to identify 
factors associated with reporting quality (e.g., CONSORT endorsement, the number 
of authors, abstract format).
RESULTS: A total of 92 eligible articles were identified. Only 6 from the 17 
items were reported in more than 80% of the articles (e.g., the statement of 
conclusions, contact details for the corresponding author). In the multivariable 
analysis, the year of publication since 2008 (IRR: 1.16; 95% confidence interval 
(CI): 1.02, 1.33), journal endorsement of the CONSORT Statement (IRR: 1.15; 95% 
CI: 1.01, 1.31), and multiple authorship (IRR 1.13, 95% CI: 1.01, 1.27) were 
significantly associated with better reporting quality.
CONCLUSION: The quality of reporting of SWT abstracts was suboptimal, although 
there have been some significant improvements since 2008. Endorsement of the 
CONSORT Statement by journals is an essential element of improvement strategies. 
Also, multiple authorship is significantly associated with better quality of 
abstract reporting.

PURPOSE: An Achilles tendon rupture is a common injury that typically affects 
people in the middle of their working lives. The injury has a negative impact in 
terms of both morbidity for the individual and the risk of substantial sick 
leave. The aim of this study was to investigate the cost-effectiveness of 
surgical compared with non-surgical management in patients with an acute 
Achilles tendon rupture.
METHODS: One hundred patients (86 men, 14 women; mean age, 40 years) with an 
acute Achilles tendon rupture were randomised (1:1) to either surgical treatment 
or non-surgical treatment, both with an accelerated rehabilitation protocol 
(surgical n = 49, non-surgical n = 51). One of the surgical patients was 
excluded due to a partial re-rupture and five surgical patients were lost to the 
1-year economic follow-up. One patient was excluded due to incorrect inclusion 
and one was lost to the 1-year follow-up in the non-surgical group. The cost was 
divided into direct and indirect costs. The direct cost is the actual cost of 
health care, whereas the indirect cost is the production loss related to the 
impact of the patient's injury in terms of lost ability to work. The health 
benefits were assessed using quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Sampling 
uncertainty was assessed by means of non-parametric boot-strapping.
RESULTS: Pre-injury, the groups were comparable in terms of demographic data and 
health-related quality of life (HRQoL). The mean cost of surgical management was 
€7332 compared with €6008 for non-surgical management (p = 0.024). The mean 
number of QALYs during the 1-year time period was 0.89 and 0.86 in the surgical 
and non-surgical groups respectively. The (incremental) cost-effectiveness ratio 
was €45,855. Based on bootstrapping, the cost-effectiveness acceptability curve 
shows that the surgical treatment is 57% likely to be cost-effective at a 
threshold value of €50,000 per QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: Surgical treatment was more expensive compared with non-surgical 
management. The cost-effectiveness results give a weak support (57% likelihood) 
for the surgical treatment to be cost-effective at a willingness to pay per QALY 
threshold of €50,000. This is support for surgical treatment; however, 
additionally cost-effectiveness studies alongside RCTs are important to clarify 
which treatment option is preferred from a cost-effectiveness perspective.

Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a genetic recessive disorder with 
progressive muscle weakness. Despite the general muscle wasting, degeneration 
and necrosis of cardiomyocytes have been the main causes of morbidity and death 
in individuals with DMD. Cardiac failure is generally preceded by disturbances 
in heart rate variability (HRV), and non-invasive measurement of the autonomic 
nervous system has been an important tool to predict adverse cardiovascular 
events. Hence, the application of HRV to study autonomic modulation in DMD 
individuals, and the establishment of correlations between HRV and heart/lung 
diseases, age, and mortality will have the potential to improve quality of life 
and life expectancy of individuals with DMD. In order to evaluate the state of 
the art in this field, we conducted a systematic search in Medline/PubMed and 
BVS (virtual library in health) databases. We selected 8 studies using 
pre-defined criteria and meta-analysis revealed decreased parasympathetic 
activity and increased sympathetic predominance in individuals with DMD as major 
observations. Moreover, there is a strong association between diminished HRV and 
myocardial fibrosis with DMD. These patterns are evident in patients at 
early-stage DMD and become more prominent as disease severity and age increase. 
Thus, data minning clearly indicates that HRV assessment can be used as a 
predictor for sudden death in individuals with DMD. The use of the HRV, which is 
inexpensive, ubiquitously available in clinics and hospitals, and a non-invasive 
analysis tool, can save lives and decrease the morbity in DMD by alerting care 
givers to consider autonomic nervous system intervention.

BACKGROUND: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major health issue worldwide. New 
generation of direct-active antiviral medications is an epoch-making turning 
point in the management of HCV infections.
OBJECTIVE: Conducing a cost-effectiveness analysis comparing the combination of 
elbasvir/grazoprevir and sofosbuvir + pegylated interferon/ribavirin for the 
management of all HCV patients (even those in the initial stages of fibrosis).
METHODS: A Markov model was built on the natural history of the disease to 
assess the efficacy of the alternatives. The outcomes are expressed in terms of 
quality adjusted life-years (QALYs) and result in terms of incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio).
RESULTS: Elbasvir/grazoprevir implies an expenditure of €21,104,253.74 with a 
gain of 19,287.90 QALYs and sofosbuvir + pegylated interferon/ribavirin implies 
an expenditure of €31,904,410.11 with a gain of 18,855.96 QALYs. 
Elbasvir/grazoprevir is thus a dominant strategy.
CONCLUSION: Consideration should be given to the opportunity cost of not 
treating patients with a lower degree of fibrosis (F0-F2).

Each year, non-communicable diseases (NCDs) kill 40 million people worldwide and 
impose an estimated economic burden of $600 billion. Without effective 
policymaking, NCDs will continue to undermine health and economic systems 
globally. We propose that climate policy measures-such as carbon pricing-can 
yield significant health-related co-benefits aside from their intended 
greenhouse gas emission reduction. We simulate three carbon tax scenarios in the 
energy and food sector in Belgium and assess the resulting health-related 
co-benefits. These benefits originate from decreased exposure to two leading NCD 
risk factors: fine particulate matter and dietary regimes excessive in animal 
products. The carbon tax could prevent 42,300-78,800 Disability-Adjusted Life 
Years in Belgium, or save 0.6-1.1% of total health care expenditure and an 
additional 0.06-0.12% of Belgian GDP. We conclude that these health-related 
co-benefits should be included in the cost-benefit analysis of carbon pricing.

BACKGROUND: Dumping syndrome is a prevalent complication of oesophageal and 
gastric surgery characterised by early (postprandial tachycardia) and late 
(hypoglycaemia) postprandial symptoms.
AIM: To evaluate efficacy and safety of the somatostatin analogue, pasireotide 
in patients with dumping syndrome after bariatric or upper gastrointestinal 
cancer surgery.
METHODS: A single-arm, open-label, multicentre, intrapatient dose-escalation, 
phase 2 study with 4 phases: screening, 3-month SC (subcutaneous), 3-month IM 
(intramuscular) and 6-month optional extension IM phase. Primary endpoint was 
the proportion of patients without hypoglycaemia (plasma glucose <3.3 mmol/L [60 
mg/dL] during an oral glucose tolerance test, OGTT) at the end of 3-month SC 
phase. A ≥50% response rate was considered clinically relevant.
RESULTS: Forty-three patients with late dumping were enrolled; 33 completed the 
3-month SC phase and 23 completed the 12-month study. The proportion of patients 
without hypoglycaemia at month 3 (primary endpoint) was 60.5% (26 of 43; 95% 
confidence interval, 44.4%-75.0%). Improvement in quality of life was observed 
during SC phase, which was maintained in the IM phase. The proportion of 
patients with a rise in pulse rate of ≥10 beats/min during OGTT reduced from 
baseline (60.5%) to month 3 (18.6%) and month 12 (27.3%). Overall (month 0-12), 
the most frequent (>20% of patients) adverse events were headache (34.9%); 
diarrhoea, hypoglycaemia (27.9% each); fatigue, nausea (23.3% each); and 
abdominal pain (20.9%).
CONCLUSION: These results suggest that pasireotide is a promising option in 
patients with dumping syndrome after bariatric or upper gastrointestinal cancer 
surgery.

OBJECTIVES: To analyze the health economic implications of increasing the 
proportion of patients with type 2 diabetes meeting treatment targets for 
glycemia, blood pressure, and serum lipid levels in Mexico.
METHODS: Complication rates, life expectancy, quality-adjusted life expectancy, 
and costs were projected over patient lifetimes using a published and validated 
diabetes model (with outcomes discounted at 5% annually). Baseline cohort 
characteristics were derived from the Mexican cohort of A1chieve. Scenarios in 
which 20% to 80% of the patients achieved glycemic targets (glycosylated 
hemoglobin [HbA1c] level of 7%) only, or blood pressure and lipid targets (based 
on international guidelines) in addition to glycemic targets were compared with 
current standard of care.
RESULTS: Increasing the proportion of patients meeting Hb A1c targets was 
projected to increase mean life expectancy and quality-adjusted life expectancy 
by up to 0.60 years and 0.34 quality-adjusted life-years over current care. When 
patients achieved all treatment targets, clinical benefits were greater than 
when only the Hb A1c level was controlled. Increasing the proportion of patients 
reaching the glycemic target was projected to lead to cost savings over 
conventional treatment, reducing mean costs by up to Mexican pesos 42,389 (US 
$3314). Surprisingly, bringing patients to other targets, as well as the Hb A1c 
target, did not result in greater cost savings. This was as a result of the 
increased life expectancy in these simulations, leading to greater costs in the 
final years (survival paradox).
CONCLUSIONS: Increasing the proportion of patients achieving treatment targets 
resulted in improved clinical outcomes and cost savings from a health care payer 
perspective in Mexico.

Study of disease in the past can help illuminate patterns of human health, 
disease, and aging in the present. As average human life expectancy and 
incidence of chronic disease have increased in the last century, efforts to 
understand this epidemiologic shift have led to more investigation of healthy 
aging. Using osteological and radiological methods of analysis, this study 
examined 212 mostly nineteenth century adult skeletons from the crypt of St. 
Bride's in London, in order to investigate the relationship between 
age-at-death, sex, and number of lesions observed in bone. Lesions were 
classified into macro-level categories according to the Rapid Method for 
Recording Human Skeletal Data, and the correlation between age group and number 
of lesions in each category, as well as the total number of lesions, were 
analyzed. Correlations between age-at-death and the number and type of lesions 
were compared across both methods of analysis. A greater total number of lesions 
and a greater number of types of lesions was observed for the osteologically 
analyzed data, compared to the radiologically analyzed data. Correlations 
between age-at-death and specific pathology groups were in general weak, though 
stronger for the osteologically analyzed data. For each method of analysis, 
there were statistically significant differences between the total number of 
lesions and age group, with total number of lesions increasing with age, 
regardless of method of analysis. Joint and metabolic lesions were the most 
significant predictors of age-at-death. The correlations between total lesions 
observed and age-at-death were similar for radiologically and osteologically 
analyzed data, for the same set of bones. This suggests that, for the bones 
analyzed, while the number of lesions recorded differed according to method of 
analysis, the relationship between overall observed lesion burden and 
age-at-death was similar for both osteological and radiological analysis.

The purpose of this study was to investigated the effect of age - over or under 
life-expectancy (LE) - on six months resistance training alone or combined with 
a nutritional supplement, and cognitive training by analyzing markers for 
oxidative stress and antioxidant defense in institutionalized elderly, living in 
Vienna. Three groups (n = 117, age = 83.1 ± 6.1 years) - resistance training 
(RT), RT combined with protein and vitamin supplementation (RTS) or cognitive 
training (CT) - performed two guided training sessions per week for six months. 
Oxidative stress, antioxidant defense and DNA strand breaks were analyzed and 
transformed into an "antioxidant factor" to compare the total effect of the 
intervention. Physical fitness was assessed by the 6-min-walking, the chair-rise 
and the handgrip strength tests. We observed significant negative baseline 
correlations between 8-oxo-7.8-dihydroguanosine and handgrip strength 
(r = -0.350, p = 0.001), and between high sensitive troponin-T and the 
6-min-walking test (r = -0.210, p = 0.035). RT and RTS groups, showed 
significant improvements in physical performance. Over LE, subjects of the RT 
group demonstrated a significant greater response in the "antioxidant factor" 
compared to RTS and CT (RT vs. RTS p = 0.033, RT vs. CT p = 0.028), whereas no 
difference was observed between the intervention groups under LE. Six months of 
elastic band resistance training lead to improvements in antioxidant defense, 
DNA stability and oxidative damage, summarized in the "antioxidant factor", 
however mainly in subjects over their statistical LE. Consuming a supplement 
containing antioxidants might inhibit optimal cellular response to exercise. The 
study was approved by the ethics committee of the City of Vienna 
(EK-11-151-0811) and registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01775111.

OBJECTIVES: To estimate the cost effectiveness of introducing the quadrivalent 
human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine into the national immunization program of 
Iran.
METHODS: The CERVIVAC cost-effectiveness model was used to calculate incremental 
cost per averted disability-adjusted life-year by vaccination compared with no 
vaccination from both governmental and societal perspectives. Calculations were 
based on epidemiologic parameters from the Iran National Cancer Registry and 
other national data sources as well as from literature review. We estimated all 
direct and indirect costs of cervical cancer treatment and vaccination program. 
All future costs and benefits were discounted at 3% per year and deterministic 
sensitivity analysis was used.
RESULTS: During a 10-year period, HPV vaccination was estimated to avert 182 
cervical cancer cases and 20 deaths at a total vaccination cost of US 
$23,459,897; total health service cost prevented because of HPV vaccination was 
estimated to be US $378,646 and US $691,741 from the governmental and societal 
perspective, respectively. Incremental cost per disability-adjusted life-year 
averted within 10 years was estimated to be US $15,205 and US $14,999 from the 
governmental and societal perspective, respectively, and both are higher than 3 
times the gross domestic product per capita of Iran (US $14,289). Sensitivity 
analysis showed variation in vaccine price, and the number of doses has the 
greatest volatility on the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. Using a 
two-dose vaccination program could be cost-effective from the societal 
perspective (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio = US $11,849).
CONCLUSIONS: Introducing a three-dose HPV vaccination program is currently not 
cost-effective in Iran. Because vaccine supplies cost is the most important 
parameter in this evaluation, considering a two-dose schedule or reducing 
vaccine prices has an impact on final conclusions.

BACKGROUND: The adverse impact of unhealthy lifestyle choices and the 
prescription of antipsychotic medications contribute to weight gain, poor 
cardiovascular health and reduced life expectancy for people with psychosis. The 
present study aimed to explore the acceptability and perceived outcomes of a 
lifestyle intervention designed to prevent or reduce weight gain in people with 
first-episode psychosis.
METHODS: This was a qualitative study using a data-driven approach. People 
recovering from first-episode psychosis recruited from UK early intervention 
services and taking part in the active arm of a randomised controlled trial of a 
lifestyle intervention (the InterACT trial), were interviewed using a 
semi-structured interview schedule. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and 
analysed using Framework Analysis.
RESULTS: Participants valued the collaborative and individualised approach taken 
by the intervention deliverers, and formed high quality relationships with them. 
Aspects of the intervention that were positively appraised included goal 
setting, social opportunities, and progress monitoring. Benefits of the 
intervention, including increased levels of exercise; improved diet and physical 
health; increased psychological wellbeing (e.g. confidence, self-esteem); and 
improved social relationships, were identified by participants, independent of 
actual weight loss.
CONCLUSIONS: Future interventions should ensure that workers have the skills to 
form high quality relationships with users, and to individualise the 
intervention according to users' needs and preferences. Future trials that test 
healthy living interventions should consider supplementing physical outcome 
measures with wider psychosocial outcome assessments, in particular social 
relationship quality, psychological wellbeing, self-esteem and self-efficacy.
