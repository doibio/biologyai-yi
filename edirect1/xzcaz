potentially translate to higher revision rates.
METHODS: We reviewed our Trent regional arthroplasty register to assess current 
surgical practice in younger patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty. The 
results were compared to a previous study published in 2005.
RESULTS: Between 2010 and 2012, 1,097 primary THAs were performed on patients 
aged 54 or less. There was an equal cohort of males to females with a mean age 
of 46 years of patients undergoing THA. Osteoarthritis was the commonest 
aetiology for patients having surgery. Reviewing the components used there were 
32 different femoral and 30 different acetabular types along with 70 different 
combinations of components. There were 608 uncemented THAs, 313 hybrid THRs, 98 
cemented THAs, 67 resurfacing arthroplasties and 11 reverse hybrid THAs.
DISCUSSION: The majority of implants were uncemented in both femur and 
acetabulum with consultants performing most of the procedures. There is a clear 
preference for uncemented femoral and acetabular fixation in the younger 
patient, and the trend towards uncemented components has increased over the last 
10 years amongst the same surgeons. There continues to be a wide variety of cup 
and stem usage along with many different combinations of components, with no 
consensus on the ideal combination.

BACKGROUND: Citric acid is commonly used as a flavoring and preservative in food 
and beverages. The effect of adding citric acid directly or encapsulated (each 
at 1 and 2 g kg-1 ) on the quality and shelf-life of ready-to-eat sea bass 
patties was evaluated during storage at 4 °C in vacuum skin packaging.
RESULTS: Microbial growth and total basic volatile nitrogen were maintained at 
relatively low levels up to 8 weeks of storage. With respect to oxidative 
stability, the addition of encapsulated citric acid minimized secondary 
oxidation values more efficiently than its direct addition, regardless of the 
concentration. This is in agreement with the decreased fishy odor observed in 
those patties containing encapsulated citric acid. Accordingly, sensory analysis 
showed that the addition of encapsulated citric acid at 1 g kg-1 resulted in 
lower scores in fish aroma compared to that of the control. Sourness is 
dependent on the amount of citric acid added, regardless of the form (direct or 
encapsulated).
CONCLUSIONS: The form of citric acid addition, rather than the amount of citric 
acid added, caused changes in texture. Therefore, the use of encapsulated citric 
acid represents a suitable strategy that is of great interest in the seafood 
industry. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry.

Cognitive capital is an emerging paradigm that captures the criticality of 
investing in children whilst neural proliferation and development of brain 
architecture are at their peak. Distinct from financial capital, cognitive 
capital represents investment in future human potential from interventions in 
nutrition, health, education, child protection, and social welfare systems that 
optimize brain development. The return on investment is significant given the 
plasticity of the developing brain in response to positive stimuli. Investment 
in brain development results in improved health and well-being, educational 
outcomes, skills, employment, and quality of life. The inverse is also true. 
Negative stimuli lead to depreciating cognitive capital, poorer mental and 
physical health and educational outcomes, and decreased life chances. Cognitive 
capital could be an organizing framework for China's next phase of development 
to ensure the building of a prosperous society. Through significant commitment 
from the government, China has seen remarkable improvements in under-five 
mortality, literacy rates, access to basic education, life expectancy, and gross 
domestic product in the past few decades as the result of an expansion of 
publicly funded social services. Yet, inequities remain within and across 
communities and regions. In 2015, China had a country ranking of 97 for gross 
national income per capita, highlighting remaining challenges across the whole 
population. Cognitive capital relies on a package of forward-looking policies 
that lead to equitable, efficient, and effective use of existing and future 
resources. This is consistent with the United Nations Convention on the Rights 
of the Child. Investments in interventions that maximize optimal brain 
development in children, realize children's rights, and contribute to future 
economic growth, defined as "cognitive capital," represent a significant 
opportunity for improving children's lives, nation-building, and future economic 
growth in China.

Claims databases consisting of routinely collected longitudinal records of 
medical expenditures are increasingly utilized for estimating expected medical 
costs of patients with a specific condition. Survival data of the patients of 
interest are usually highly censored, and observed expenditures are incomplete. 
In this study, we propose a survival-adjusted estimator for estimating mean 
lifetime costs, which integrates the product of the survival function and the 
mean cost function over the lifetime horizon. The survival function is estimated 
by a new algorithm of rolling extrapolation, aided by external information of 
age- and sex-matched referents simulated from national vital statistics. The 
mean cost function is estimated by a weighted average of mean expenditures of 
patients in a number of months prior to their death, of which the number could 
be determined by observed costs in their final months, and the weights depend on 
extrapolated hazards. We evaluate the performance of the proposed approach in 
comparison with that of a popular method using simulated data under various 
scenarios and 2 cohorts of intracerebral hemorrhage and ischemic stroke patients 
with a maximum follow-up of 13 years and conclude that our new method estimates 
the mean lifetime costs more accurately.

Omalizumab is frequently used as add-on treatment to inhaled corticosteroids 
(ICS) and long-acting β2-agonists in patients with suboptimal control of severe 
asthma. Patients with severe asthma will typically require chronic treatment, 
although due to the limited amount of data available there are still some 
concerns about the safety and efficacy of long-term therapy with omalizumab. 
Herein, in an extension of a previous 4-year study, we report disease-related 
outcomes of 8 patients with severe persistent allergic asthma who have been 
followed for a total of 9 years in a real-life setting. Both quality of life 
(QoL) (evaluated using the Juniper Asthma-Related QoL Questionnaire [AQLQ]) and 
forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) showed sustained improvement at 9 
years. The median values of AQLQ and FEV1 at 4 years were 5.5 and 82.0% compared 
to 5.9 and 85.5%, respectively, at 9 years, which were all significantly 
increased from baseline. After 9 years, the mean annual number of severe 
exacerbations was 0.63 compared to 5 at baseline. There also appeared to be a 
trend toward use of a lower dose of ICS at longer follow-up times. After 9 
years, there were no safety concerns for continued use of omalizumab, and no 
asthma-related hospitalizations or emergency department visits were documented 
over the last 5 years. The present analysis is the longest reported clinical 
follow-up of omalizumab. Long-term maintenance treatment with omalizumab for up 
to 9 years is associated with continued benefits in reducing symptoms, 
exacerbations, and medication burden without any safety concerns.

The interventions to slow aging, favoring active life expectancy, represent the 
new perspectives in ageing investigation. Some mechanisms that delay or prevent 
the onset of aging pathologies have been identified. Between them, a healthy 
lifestyle seems to reduce many risk factors. In particular, eating habits 
represent the most concrete, low-cost way to act on aging process. Mediterranean 
diet has received much attention since its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory 
effects have been consistently demonstrated. Unfortunately, many people follow a 
Western diet, poor in phytochemicals that represent the main source of 
beneficial effects of this dietary pattern. So, supplements administration 
should be considered, especially in subjects exposed to high level of oxidative 
stress and inflammation. So, we tested the properties of a commercial food 
supplement containing a series of plant polyphenols in combination with 
caffeine, bioperine (black pepper extract), and selenium in smoking healthy 
volunteers. Fifty participants have been recruited and hematochemical analyses 
and biochemistry tests have been performed, before and after 60 days of 
supplement intake. Thirteen subjects dropped out of the study. At the end of the 
intervention, the variation of inflammatory and oxidant markers has been 
evaluated, measuring urinary isoprostanes, serum advanced glycation end 
products, and oxidized low-density lipoproteins. The results showed that this 
supplement exhibits promising antioxidant and anti-inflammatory responses, 
especially in women, highlighting the role of supplementation in certain groups 
of subjects, for the control of oxidative stress as well as inflammatory status. 
So, its intake should be useful in delaying the onset of age-related diseases.

BACKGROUND: In Zambia, human anthrax cases often occur following cases of animal 
anthrax. Human behaviour has been implicated in this transmission. The objective 
of the study was to explore human behavioural patterns that may contribute to 
outbreaks of anthrax among affected communities.
METHODS: A mixed methods study was conducted in four districts of Zambia from 
November 2015 to February 2016. A cross sectional survey involving 1,127 
respondents, six focus group discussions and seven key informant interviews with 
professional staff were conducted. Descriptive statistics on socio-demographic 
characteristics, awareness of anthrax, attitudes towards cattle vaccination and 
risk factors for anthrax and vaccination practices were run using STATA 12 for 
analysis.
RESULTS: Overall, 88% of respondents heard about anthrax, 85.1% were aware that 
anthrax is transmitted by eating infected meat and 64.2% knew that animals and 
humans can be infected with anthrax. However, qualitative data suggested that 
awareness of anthrax varied across communities. Qualitative findings also 
indicated that, in Western and Muchinga provinces, human anthrax was transmitted 
by eating infected beef and hippo (Hippopotamus amphibious) meat, respectively. 
Although survey data indicated that 62.2% of respondents vaccinated their 
animals, qualitative interviews and annual vaccination reports indicated low 
vaccination rates, which were attributed to inadequate veterinary service 
provision and logistical challenges. While 82% of respondents indicated that 
they reported animal deaths to veterinary officers, only 13.5% of respondents 
buried infected carcasses. Majority (78.1%) of respondents either ate, sold or 
shared meat from dead animals with other community members. Poverty, lack of 
access to meat protein and economic reasons were cited as drivers for consuming 
infected meat.
CONCLUSIONS: Health education campaigns must be intensified to reduce the risk 
of human exposure. Veterinary extension services should be strengthened and cold 
chain facilities decentralized in order to improve accessibility to anthrax 
vaccine. It is also important to involve the affected communities and 
collaborate with other disciplines in order to effectively tackle poverty, 
improve veterinary services and address inherent meat consumption practices 
within the communities.

BACKGROUND: Although the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) showed 
good efficacy against pneumococcal disease in the the CAPiTA trial, the 
23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccination (PPSV23) program has been 
ongoing for older adults aged ≥ 65 years in Korea since May of 2013. This study 
aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the current vaccination strategy (a 
single-dose PPSV23 vaccination) compared to a single-dose PCV13 vaccination and 
sequential PCV13-PPSV23 vaccinations in the elderly population aged ≥ 65 years.
METHODS: Using a Markov model, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) 
of three vaccination strategies were assessed in a societal context. The 
transition probabilities, utility weights to estimate quality adjusted life year 
(QALY), and disease treatment costs were either calculated or cited from 
published data and the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service. 
Simulations were performed in hypothetical cohorts of Korean adults aged ≥ 19 
years. The vaccine effectiveness of PPSV23 was cited from a Cochrane Review 
report, while PCV13 effectiveness data were gathered from the CAPiTA trial.
RESULTS: Current PPSV23 vaccination strategies were cost-effective (ICER, 
$25,786 per QALY). However, the administration of PCV13 as a substitute for 
PPSV23 was shown to be more cost-effective than PPSV23 vaccination (ICER, $797 
per QALY). Sequential PCV13-PPSV23 vaccination was also more cost-effective than 
PPSV23 for elderly people aged ≥ 65 years. In sensitivity analysis assuming 
significant PPSV23 effectiveness (50%) against non-bacteremic pneumococcal 
pneumonia, the PCV13 vaccination strategy was superior to the PPSV23 vaccination 
strategy in terms of cost-effectiveness.
CONCLUSION: The results suggest that PCV13 vaccination is more cost-effective in 
elderly subjects aged ≥ 65 years compared to the current PPSV23 vaccination 
strategy. When complete data is obtained in 2018 on the maximal herd effects of 
childhood PCV13 immunization, the incidence of pneumococcal pneumonia and the 
cost-effectiveness of vaccination strategies need to be reassessed.

Accelerated weathering exposures were performed on poly(ethylene-terephthalate) 
(PET) films. Longitudinal multi-level predictive models as a function of PET 
grades and exposure types were developed for the change in yellowness index (YI) 
and haze (%). Exposures with similar change in YI were modeled using a linear 
fixed-effects modeling approach. Due to the complex nature of haze formation, 
measurement uncertainty, and the differences in the samples' responses, the 
change in haze (%) depended on individual samples' responses and a linear 
mixed-effects modeling approach was used. When compared to fixed-effects models, 
the addition of random effects in the haze formation models significantly 
increased the variance explained. For both modeling approaches, diagnostic plots 
confirmed independence and homogeneity with normally distributed residual 
errors. Predictive R2 values for true prediction error and predictive power of 
the models demonstrated that the models were not subject to over-fitting. These 
models enable prediction under pre-defined exposure conditions for a given 
exposure time (or photo-dosage in case of UV light exposure). PET degradation 
under cyclic exposures combining UV light and condensing humidity is caused by 
photolytic and hydrolytic mechanisms causing yellowing and haze formation. 
Quantitative knowledge of these degradation pathways enable cross-correlation of 
these lab-based exposures with real-world conditions for service life 
prediction.

PURPOSE: Stereotactic body radiotherapy to vertebral column remains uncommon 
practice and only relevant in selected group of patients. The main objective of 
the study was to describe the current state of medical practices of stereotactic 
body radiotherapy to vertebral column in France in 2016 and to assess the 
diversity of practices to identify areas for improvement and establish a common 
database set for this technique.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A questionnaire was written with contribution of a 
medical physicist, a radiation oncologist, an information technologist and a 
radiotherapy resident. The questionnaire was distributed online to a radiation 
oncologists and a medical physicists partner of selected French radiotherapy 
specialized centres that provide stereotactic body radiotherapy to vertebral 
metastasis from April to June 2016. The questionnaire surveyed the following 
topics: patients' selection, simulation, targeted volume and organs at risk 
delineation, prescription, dosimetric implementation and image guidance.
RESULTS: A total of 31 centres were surveyed. Seventy eight per cent of centres 
(n=21) completed the questionnaire. The "ideal" patient for spine stereotactic 
radiotherapy according to these institutions has a good performance status, a 
long life expectancy, controlled primary tumour with oligometastatic spread. The 
most prescribed protocol was 30Gy in three fractions. For clinical target volume 
delineation, about two thirds of centres used the International Spine 
Radiosurgery Consortium (ISRC) recommendations (Noël G et al.,2006).
CONCLUSION: This study identified some consistency of practices in some aspects 
despite the lack of consensus guidelines. Nevertheless, further studies are 
needed to establish consensus of planning and treatment.

Fresh and processed muscle-based foods are highly perishable food products and 
packaging plays a crucial role in providing containment so that the full effect 
of preservation can be achieved through the provision of shelf-life extension. 
Conventional packaging materials and systems have served the industry well, 
however, greater demands are being placed upon industrial packaging formats 
owing to the movement of muscle-based products to increasingly distant markets, 
as well as increased customer demands for longer product shelf-life and storage 
capability. Consequently, conventional packaging materials and systems will have 
to evolve to meet these challenges. This review presents some of the new 
strategies that have been developed by employing novel nanotechnological 
concepts which have demonstrated some promise in significantly extending the 
shelf-life of muscle-based foods by providing commercially-applicable, 
antimicrobially-active, smart packaging solutions. The primary focus of this 
paper is applied to subject aspects, such as; material chemistries employed, 
forming methods utilised, interactions of the packaging functionalities 
including nanomaterials employed with polymer substrates and how such materials 
ultimately affect microbes. In order that such materials become industrially 
feasible, it is important that safe, stable and commercially-viable packaging 
materials are shown to be producible and effective in order to gain public 
acceptance, legislative approval and industrial adoption.

In this study, lignocellulose biorefineries annexed to a typical sugar mill were 
investigated to produce either ethanol (EtOH) or 1,3-butadiene (BD), utilizing 
bagasse and trash as feedstock. Aspen simulation of the scenarios were developed 
and evaluated in terms of economic and environmental performance. The minimum 
selling prices (MSPs) for bio-based BD and EtOH production were 2.9-3.3 and 
1.26-1.38-fold higher than market prices, respectively. Based on the sensitivity 
analysis results, capital investment, Internal Rate of Return and extension of 
annual operating time had the greatest impact on the MSP. Monte Carlo simulation 
demonstrated that EtOH and BD productions could be profitable if the average of 
ten-year historical price increases by 1.05 and 1.9-fold, respectively. The 
fossil-based route was found inferior to bio-based pathway across all 
investigated environmental impact categories, due to burdens associated with oil 
extraction.

BACKGROUND: Studies have reported that pharmacologic interventions with 
candesartan or ramipril could reduce the risk of hypertension among 
prehypertensive subjects free of clinical cardiovascular disease (CVD), however, 
the cost-effectiveness and long-term cardiovascular risk of drug treatment among 
these population is unclear.
METHOD: A Markov state-transition model was developed to simulate a hypothetical 
cohort of Chinese adults with high-range prehypertension (130-139/85-89mmHg) but 
without CVD. Data on the incidence of CVD and hypertension was obtained from 
corresponding risk equations. Utility and disease-related costs were obtained 
from published literatures. Robustness and uncertainty was evaluated using 
deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses.
RESULTS: Compared with placebo, drug treatment resulted in delaying the 
development of hypertension by nearly 12years and reducing the absolute 
incidence of hypertension by 32.01% over lifetime. The cumulative incidence of 
coronary heart disease, stroke and heart failure were reduced and survival was 
improved from 28.46 to 28.80years. The average incremental cost effectiveness 
ratio for drug treatment was $12,994 per quality-adjusted life-year and the 
value was mostly sensitive to the effect size of treatment and age starting 
treatment. At a willingness-to-pay threshold of >3×China gross domestic product 
per capita in 2014, there was a 30.48% chance that drug treatment would remain 
cost-effective and a low chance of being cost-effective if relative risk of 
treatment on hypertension was larger than 0.64.
CONCLUSION: Drug treatment for prehypertension may help stem the current 
epidemic of hypertension among Chinese adults free of CVD, which may in turn 
reduce CVD complications and potentially be cost effective.

Novel paradigms emerge in oncology today. Systemic treatments are more effective 
and diversified along with an increased life expectancy in oligometastatic 
patients. Stereotactic radiotherapy using hypofractionation opens new 
perspectives for local tumour control. The area of radiobiology has expanded 
with integration of tumour microenvironment in which radiation-induced 
inflammation mediators and immune system play a major role. Immunity checkpoints 
inhibitors experience a major development. This rapidly evolving field seems 
involved in the abscopal effects, especially when radiation is combined with 
checkpoints inhibitors, as demonstrated in numerous preclinical studies and 
several clinical trials. Paradoxically, irradiation also produces 
immunosuppressive effects. This manuscript aims to report the dual effects of 
ionizing radiation on the immune system and reviews some results of the 
combination of radiation and immunity chekpoints inhibitors and also research 
perspectives.

BACKGROUND: Health care for people living with HIV has improved substantially in 
the past two decades. Robust estimates of how these improvements have affected 
prognosis and life expectancy are of utmost importance to patients, clinicians, 
and health-care planners. We examined changes in 3 year survival and life 
expectancy of patients starting combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) between 
1996 and 2013.
METHODS: We analysed data from 18 European and North American HIV-1 cohorts. 
Patients (aged ≥16 years) were eligible for this analysis if they had started 
ART with three or more drugs between 1996 and 2010 and had at least 3 years of 
potential follow-up. We estimated adjusted (for age, sex, AIDS, risk group, CD4 
cell count, and HIV-1 RNA at start of ART) all-cause and cause-specific 
mortality hazard ratios (HRs) for the first year after ART initiation and the 
second and third years after ART initiation in four calendar periods (1996-99, 
2000-03 [comparator], 2004-07, 2008-10). We estimated life expectancy by 
calendar period of initiation of ART.
FINDINGS: 88 504 patients were included in our analyses, of whom 2106 died 
during the first year of ART and 2302 died during the second or third year of 
ART. Patients starting ART in 2008-10 had lower all-cause mortality in the first 
year after ART initiation than did patients starting ART in 2000-03 (adjusted HR 
0·71, 95% CI 0·61-0·83). All-cause mortality in the second and third years after 
initiation of ART was also lower in patients who started ART in 2008-10 than in 
those who started in 2000-03 (0·57, 0·49-0·67); this decrease was not fully 
explained by viral load and CD4 cell count at 1 year. Rates of non-AIDS deaths 
were lower in patients who started ART in 2008-10 (vs 2000-03) in the first year 
(0·48, 0·34-0·67) and second and third years (0·29, 0·21-0·40) after initiation 
of ART. Between 1996 and 2010, life expectancy in 20-year-old patients starting 
ART increased by about 9 years in women and 10 years in men.
INTERPRETATION: Even in the late ART era, survival during the first 3 years of 
ART continues to improve, which probably reflects transition to less toxic 
antiretroviral drugs, improved adherence, prophylactic measures, and management 
of comorbidity. Prognostic models and life expectancy estimates should be 
updated to account for these improvements.

An important motivation for the construction of biobanks is to discover 
biomarkers that identify diseases at early, potentially curable stages. This 
will require biobanks from large numbers of individuals, preferably sampled 
repeatedly, where the samples are collected and stored under conditions that 
preserve potential biomarkers. Dried blood samples are attractive for biobanking 
because of the ease and low cost of collection and storage. Here we have 
investigated their suitability for protein measurements. Ninety-two proteins 
with relevance for oncology were analyzed using multiplex proximity extension 
assays (PEA) in dried blood spots collected on paper and stored for up to 30 
years at either +4 °C or -24 °C.Our main findings were that (1) the act of 
drying only slightly influenced detection of blood proteins (average correlation 
of 0.970), and in a reproducible manner (correlation of 0.999), (2) detection of 
some proteins was not significantly affected by storage over the full range of 
three decades (34 and 76% of the analyzed proteins at +4 °C and -24 °C, 
respectively), whereas levels of others decreased slowly during storage with 
half-lives in the range of 10 to 50 years, and (3) detectability of proteins was 
less affected in dried samples stored at -24 °C compared with at +4 °C, as the 
median protein abundance had decreased to 80 and 93% of starting levels after 10 
years of storage at +4 °C or -24 °C, respectively. The results of our study are 
encouraging as they suggest an inexpensive means to collect large numbers of 
blood samples, even by the donors themselves, and to transport, and store 
biobanked samples as spots of whole blood dried on paper. Combined with emerging 
means to measure hundreds or thousands of protein, such biobanks could prove of 
great medical value by greatly enhancing discovery as well as routine analysis 
of blood biomarkers.

The increase in life expectancy of about 30 years in the developed countries 
represents one of the most important achievements of the last hundred years. 
During aging, normal pituitary activity undergoes significant changes, 
reflecting the complex relationship between aging and endocrine systems. These 
alterations are postulated to be causally linked to human aging, possibly 
contributing to changes in body composition, bone structure, physical 
performance, cardiovascular system functions, and increased morbidity and 
mortality. Owing to age-dependent physiological changes in pituitary function, 
as well as coexistent chronic illness and polypharmacy, interpretation of 
pituitary function tests in older adults is more difficult than in the younger. 
As symptoms of pituitary disorders may overlap with what is considered to be 
''normal aging,'' the presence of a pituitary disorder in the elderly may often 
go undiagnosed. Unrecognized and untreated pituitary disorders are associated 
with adverse outcomes that can be ameliorated or prevented by adequate therapy. 
This paper summarizes the present state of knowledge on the age-related changes 
in pituitary function, as well as discusses the etiology, clinical 
manifestation, diagnosis, and management of pituitary disorders in the elderly.

The emergence of improved antiretroviral therapy has increased the life 
expectancy of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals, although 
there is an increased susceptibility to developing cardiovascular diseases 
(CVD). The risk for CVD is purported to be even higher among people with HIV and 
hepatitis C virus (HCV) coinfection because of the increased inflammatory 
response, which may synergistically impact CVD risk. However, studies comparing 
CVD outcomes between HIV alone and HIV/HCV individuals have been discordant. 
Accordingly, we conducted a meta-analysis to clarify and quantify the 
association between HIV/HCV coinfection and the risk for CVD. We searched 
EMBASE, CINAHL, Google Scholar, PubMed, and Web of Science from inception to 
December 2016 to identify studies that provided information on HIV/HCV 
coinfection and CVD, defined as coronary artery disease, congestive heart 
failure and stroke. We used a random-effects model to abstract and pool data on 
the hazard ratios (HRs) for CVD. HRs were adjusted for traditional CVD risk 
factors including age, sex, smoking, hypertension, diabetes and LDL cholesterol. 
Among the 283 articles reviewed, four cohort studies met inclusion criteria with 
a total of 33 723 participants. The pooled adjusted HRs for the association 
between HIV/HCV coinfection and CVD were 1.24 (95% CI: 1.07-1.40) compared to 
HIV monoinfection. The test for heterogeneity was not statistically significant 
(I2 =0.0%, P=.397). In conclusion, individuals with HIV/HCV coinfection had an 
increased CVD risk compared to those with HIV monoinfection. More research is 
needed to further examine the nature of this association, and response to 
traditional risk-reduction therapies.

BACKGROUND: Streptococcus pneumoniae infection is the most common cause of 
community-acquired pneumonia in adults. Invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) 
carries a high case fatality rate. We investigated the lifespan of adults who 
recovered from IPD during a 32-year follow-up.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We determined whether adults discharged after an episode 
of IPD from hospitals affiliated with the Marshall University Joan C. Edwards 
School of Medicine in Huntington, West Virginia from 1983-2003 were alive on 
June 30, 2014. Lifespan was assessed by Kaplan-Meier methodology, Cox 
proportional hazards multivariate analysis, life expectancy using life tables 
for West Virginia, years of potential life lost and serotype occurrence.
RESULTS: The study group comprised 155 adults who survived IPD. They had a mean 
age at discharge of 64.6 years, mean lifespan after IPD of 7.1 years, mean 
expected lifespan after IPD of 17.0 years, mean age at death of 71.6 years and a 
mean life expectancy of 81.6 years. Only 14 (9.0%) patients lived longer than 
their life expectancy. Of the 13 comorbid diseases analyzed, cancer and 
neurologic diseases and the number of comorbid diseases suffered by each patient 
were the significant variables associated with survival. The mean years of 
potential life lost was 9.936 years. Only serotype 12 of 31 serotypes recovered 
occurred more often in patients who survived for 11 or more years after 
discharge (relative risk = 3.44, 95% CI: 1.19-9.95).
CONCLUSIONS: The fact that most adult patients who recovered from IPD died 
before their documented life expectancy argues for the pernicious severity of 
IPD and the importance of immunization of adults with pneumococcal vaccines.
