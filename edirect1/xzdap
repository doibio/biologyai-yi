applications of pharmacogenomics to RA management by identifying polymorphisms 
associated with variation in treatment response or toxicity. The use of genetic 
variants to guide treatment strategy has the potential to not only reduce 
National Health Service costs, but also drastically improve patient experience 
and quality of life.

Reported median overall survival (mOS) in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) 
patients participating in systemic therapy trials has increased to over 
30 months. It is uncertain whether trial results translate to real-life 
populations. Moreover, patients prefer presentation of multiple survival 
scenarios. Population-based data of all stage IV CRC patients diagnosed between 
2008 and 2016 were obtained from the Netherlands Cancer Registry, which has a 
case ascertainment completeness surpassing 95%. We calculated the following 
percentiles (scenarios) of OS per year of diagnosis for the total population, 
and for treatment subgroups: 10th (best-case), 25th (upper-typical), 50th 
(median), 75th (lower-typical) and 90th (worst-case). Twenty-five percent of 
patients did not receive any antitumor treatment. From 2008 to 2016, mOS of the 
total population (n = 27275) remained unchanged at approximately 12 months. OS 
improved only for the upper-typical and best-case patients; by 4.2 to 29.1 
months (P < .001), and by 6 to 62 months (P < .001), respectively. No clinically 
relevant change was observed among patients who received systemic therapy, with 
mOS close to 15 months and best-case scenario approximately 40 months. A 
clinically relevant improvement in survival over time was observed in patients 
who initially received metastasectomy and/or HIPEC only. In contrast to the wide 
belief based on trial data that mOS of mCRC patients receiving systemic therapy 
has improved substantially, improvement could not be demonstrated in our 
real-life population. Clinicians should consider quoting multiple survival 
scenarios based on real-life data instead of point estimates from clinical 
trials, when informing patients about their life expectancy.

OBJECTIVE: We aim to compare the cost-effectiveness of the old cytology 
programme with the new high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) screening 
programme, using performance indicators from the new Dutch hrHPV screening 
programme.
DESIGN: Model-based cost-effectiveness analysis.
SETTING: The Netherlands.
POPULATION: Dutch 30-year-old unvaccinated females followed up lifelong.
METHODS: We updated the microsimulation screening analysis (MISCAN) model using 
the most recent epidemiological and screening data from the Netherlands. We 
simulated both screening programmes, using the screening behaviour and costs 
observed in each programme. Sensitivity analyses were performed on screening 
behaviour, utility losses and discount rates.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cervical cancer incidence and mortality rates, number of 
screening tests and repeat tests, colposcopy referrals by lesion grade, costs 
from a societal perspective, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained and 
cost-effectiveness.
RESULTS: The new Dutch cervical cancer screening programme decreased the 
cervical cancer mortality by 4% and the incidence by 1% compared with the old 
programme. Colposcopy referrals of women without cervical intra-epithelial 
neoplasia grade 2 or worse, increased by 172%, but 13% more QALYs were still 
achieved. Total costs were reduced by 21%, mainly due to fewer screening tests. 
Per QALY gained, the hrHPV programme cost 46% less (€12,225) than the cytology 
programme (€22,678), and hrHPV-based screening remained more cost-effective in 
all sensitivity analyses.
CONCLUSIONS: The hrHPV-based screening programme was found to be more effective 
and cost-effective than the cytology programme. Alternatives for the current 
triage strategy should be considered to lower the number of unnecessary 
referrals.
TWEETABLE ABSTRACT: First results after implementation confirm that HPV 
screening is more cost-effective than cytology screening.

Providing care for the 99.9% during the COVID-19 pandemic: How ethics, equity, 
epidemiology, and cost per QALY inform healthcare policy.

Managing healthcare in the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) era should be 
guided by ethics, epidemiology, equity, and economics, not emotion. Ethical 
healthcare policies ensure equitable access to care for patients regardless of 
whether they have COVID-19 or another disease. Because healthcare resources are 
limited, a cost per Quality Life Year (QALY) approach to COVID-19 policy should 
also be considered. Policies that focus solely on mitigating COVID-19 are likely 
to be ethically or financially unsustainable. A cost/QALY approach could target 
resources to optimally improve QALYs. For example, most COVID-19 deaths occur in 
long-term care facilities, and this problem is likely better addressed by a 
focused long-term care reform than by a society-wide non-pharmacological 
intervention. Likewise, ramping up elective, non-COVID-19 care in low prevalence 
regions while expanding testing and case tracking in hot spots could reduce 
excess mortality from non-COVID-19 diseases and decrease adverse financial 
impacts while controlling the epidemic. Globally, only ∼0.1% of people have had 
a COVID-19 infection. Thus, ethical healthcare policy must address the needs of 
the 99.9%.

OBJECTIVE: To examine the cost-effectiveness of a preventive self-care health 
management program for community-dwelling older adults as compared to usual 
care.
DESIGN/INTERVENTION: A cost-effectiveness analysis was executed alongside a 
randomised controlled trial. Nurse case managers provided interventions, 
including holistic assessment, empowerment of self-care, preventive health 
behaviours and self-efficacy with co-produced care planning, supported by 
nursing students. The control group received social control calls.
PARTICIPANTS/SETTING: Community-dwelling older adults were randomly assigned to 
the intervention (n = 271) or control (n = 269) group. The intervention was 
conducted in collaboration with 11 community centres under four non-government 
organisations in various districts of Hong Kong.
MEASUREMENTS: Cost and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were collected pre 
(baseline, 0 months) and post intervention (3 months) and 3 months after 
completion of the program (6 months). Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios 
between the groups were calculated, dividing the difference in cost by the 
difference in QALYs.
RESULTS: Analysis showed that the net incremental QALY gain was 0.0014 
(3 months) and 0.0033 (6 months) when the intervention group was compared to the 
control group. The probability of being cost-effective at 6 months was 53.2% and 
53.4%, based on the cost-effectiveness thresholds recommended by both the 
National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence ($200,000/QALYs) and the 
World Health Organization (Hong Kong gross domestic product/capita, HK$381,780).
CONCLUSIONS: The results provide some evidence to suggest that the addition of a 
home-based, preventive self-care health management program may have effects on 
cost outcomes for community-dwelling older adults in Hong Kong.

Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) affects 1.6 million Americans, and only 14% of emerging 
adults ages 18-25 years achieve targets for glycemic control (A1C < 7.0%). Sleep 
deficiency, including habitual short sleep duration (<6.5 hr total sleep time 
and high within-person variability in total sleep time), is associated with 
poorer glycemic control. Emerging adults with T1D have a more pronounced sleep 
extension on weekends compared with matched controls, consistent with sleep 
deficiency; however, associations among sleep variability and glycemic control 
have not been explored in this population. Sleep deficiency may affect the 
complex higher-order neurocognitive functioning needed for successful diabetes 
self-management (DSM). We report the protocol for an ongoing study designed to 
characterize sleep and the associations among sleep deficiency, neurocognitive 
function, DSM, diabetes quality of life, and glycemia among a sample of 40 
emerging adults with T1D. We monitor sleep via wrist-worn actigraphy and glucose 
via continuous glucose monitoring concurrently over 14 days. We are collecting 
data on self-report and objective sleep, a 10-min psychomotor vigilance test on 
a PVT-192 device, a 3-min Trail Making Test on paper, and questionnaires, 
including twice-daily Pittsburgh sleep diaries using Research Electronic Data 
Capture (REDCap)TM . Results from this study will be used to support the 
development and testing of the efficacy of a tailored sleep self-management 
intervention that may improve total sleep time, sleep variability, 
neurocognitive function, DSM, glycemic control, and glucose variability among 
emerging adults with T1D.

The prevalence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) continues to rise globally; 
however, the true proportion of paediatric IBD patients remains unknown. We 
conducted an all-age, multiparameter, population-based search using 
capture-recapture methodology to identify all IBD cases to August 31, 2018 
within Lothian, a defined health board and the largest of the 3 within 
South-East Scotland. Individual case note validation was performed for all 
24,601 possible IBD cases according to internationally recognised diagnostic and 
age criteria. Of 7035 confirmed point-prevalent patients, 560 were classified as 
A1 age phenotype at diagnosis, constituting just 8% of all cases. Ninety-nine 
patients were less than 17 years of age on August 31, 2018, constituting only 
1.4% of all point-prevalent cases. These results demonstrate the true 
contemporary proportion of prevalent paediatric IBD patients is strikingly low, 
reflecting compounding prevalence in adult practice and the near-normal life 
expectancy of this chronic, incurable condition.

Invited Commentary: Rethinking Cervical Cancer Elimination in Terms of Lifetime 
Risk Rather Than Arbitrarily Defined Age-Standardized Incidence Rates.

Malagón T, Franco EL.

Comment on
    Am J Epidemiol. 2021 Apr 6;190(4):506-514.

In their accompanying article, Vänskä et al. (Am J Epidemiol. 
2021;190(4):506-514) provide us with cohort lifetime risks of cervical cancer 
attributable to different types of human papillomavirus in Sweden. We argue that 
a standardized lifetime risk such as those calculated by Vänskä et al. might be 
a more appropriate public health target for cervical cancer elimination than 
age-standardized incidence rates. Age standardization to an arbitrary standard 
age distribution implies an implicit value choice regarding the weight of 
different age groups for which we find little moral justification. Conversely, a 
standardized lifetime risk uses standard life expectancy as a weight, 
corresponding to the likelihood that cervical cancer would impact a woman and 
prevent her from pursuing opportunities within a standard life span. Based on 
the data from Vänskä et al., a standardized lifetime risk of 129-250 cervical 
cancers per 100,000 women born could be an aspirational alternative public 
health target for cervical cancer elimination as a public health problem, 
complementary to the World Health Organization's arbitrary draft target of 4 
cervical cancers per 100,000 age-standardized woman-years.

Commonly used measures of population aging categorize adults into those who are 
"old" and those who are not. How this threshold of the stage of "old age" is 
determined is crucial for our understanding of population aging. We propose that 
the old age threshold be determined using an equivalency criterion. People at 
the old age threshold should be roughly equivalent to one another in relevant 
characteristics regardless of when and where they lived. The UN publishes two 
variants of the potential support ratio based on different old age thresholds. 
One old age threshold is based on a fixed chronological age and the other on a 
fixed remaining life expectancy. Using historical data on 5-year death rates at 
the old age threshold as an indicator of one aspect of health, we assess the 
extent to which the two approaches are consistent with the equivalency 
criterion. The death rates are derived from all the complete cohort life tables 
in the Human Mortality Database. We show that the old age threshold based on a 
fixed remaining life expectancy is consistent with the equivalency criterion, 
while the old age threshold based on a fixed chronological age is not. The 
picture of population aging that emerges when measures consistent with the 
equivalency criterion are used are markedly different from those that result 
when the equivalency criterion is violated. We recommend that measures of aging 
that violate the equivalency criterion should only be used in special 
circumstances where that violation is unimportant.

AIM: The medico-surgical strategy for the treatment of perianal fistulizing 
Crohn's disease (CD) following surgical drainage remains challenging and 
debated. Our aims were to describe the failure rate of therapeutic interventions 
after drainage of the fistula tract and determine the factors associated with 
failure to optimize medico-surgical strategies.
METHOD: All consecutive patients with perianal fistulizing CD who underwent 
surgical drainage with at least a 12-week follow-up were included. Failure was 
defined as the occurrence of at least one of the following items: abscess 
recurrence, purulent discharge from the tract, visible external opening and 
further drainage procedure(s).
RESULTS: One hundred and sixty-nine patients were included. The median follow-up 
was 4.0 years. The cumulative failure rates were 20%, 30% and 36% at 1, 3 and 
5 years, respectively. The cumulative failure rates in patients who had 
sphincter-sparing surgeries or seton removal were significantly higher than in 
those who had a fistulotomy. Anterior fistula [hazard ratio (HR) = 2.52 
(1.13-5.61), P = 0.024], supralevator extension [HR = 20.78 (3.38-127.80), 
P = 0.001] and the absence or discontinuation of immunosuppressants after anal 
drainage [HR = 3.74 (1.11-12.5), P = 0.032] were significantly associated with 
failure in the multivariate analysis model.
CONCLUSION: Combined strategies for perianal fistulizing CD lead to a failure 
rate of 36% at 5 years. Where advisable, fistulotomy may be preferred because it 
has a lower rate of recurrence. The benefits of immunosuppressants require a 
dedicated prospective randomized trial.

Life expectancy has gradually grown over the last century. This has deeply 
affected healthcare costs, since the growth of an aging population is correlated 
to the increasing burden of chronic diseases. This represents the interesting 
challenge of how to manage patients with chronic diseases in order to improve 
health care budgets. Effective primary prevention could represent a promising 
route. To this end, precision, together with personalized medicine, are useful 
instruments in order to investigate pathological processes before the appearance 
of clinical symptoms and to guide physicians to choose a targeted therapy to 
manage the patient. Cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases represent 
suitable models for taking full advantage of precision medicine technologies 
applied to all stages of disease development. The availability of high 
technology incorporating artificial intelligence and advancement progress made 
in the field of biomedical research have been substantial to understand how 
genes, epigenetic modifications, aging, nutrition, drugs, microbiome and other 
environmental factors can impact health and chronic disorders. The aim of the 
present review is to address how precision and personalized medicine can bring 
greater clarity to the clinical and biological complexity of these types of 
disorders associated with high mortality, involving tremendous health care 
costs, by describing in detail the methods that can be applied. This might offer 
precious tools for preventive strategies and possible clues on the evolution of 
the disease and could help in predicting morbidity, mortality and detecting 
chronic disease indicators much earlier in the disease course. This, of course, 
will have a major effect on both improving the quality of care and quality of 
life of the patients and reducing time efforts and healthcare costs.

BACKGROUND: The family, as the smallest social institution, has responsibilities 
across many functions, including maintaining family health. Increases in chronic 
diseases and life expectancy require more family support to prevent disease and 
implement treatment for family members with chronic diseases. Therefore, 
physician involvement in not only the treatment of diseases but also their 
prevention and rehabilitation is required In Indonesia. Hence, a new approach 
for physician involvement with families is required, especially with regard to 
comprehensiveness. This study aimed to develop a physician involvement program 
with the family model for primary healthcare in Indonesia.
METHODS: A two-round Delphi method with family medicine experts from 17 of the 
highest accredited medical faculties in Indonesia as participants was conducted, 
and factor analysis performed thereafter. The items were considered relevant at 
≤0.8 validity content ratio. The second step of this research is survey using 
e-questionnaire involving 101 primary care physician from all over Indonesia. 
They live scattered in several provinces in the main islands of Indonesia such 
Sumatra, Java, Kalimantan, Sulawesi dan Bali.
RESULTS: Results showed an adequately measured sample and correlation for all 
items (Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin of sampling=0.821; Bartlett's test <0.001). Seven 
dimensions were derived from results with eigenvalue of >1, and 25 items were 
filtered after determining the loading factor of >0.5. The Cronbach's α for each 
factor varied from 0.602 to 0.829, and that for the total 25 items was 0.913, 
with a total variation documented as high as 66%.
CONCLUSION: A new physician involvement model with the family approach model, 
known as the "GENOGRAM model," was developed, which consisted of seven 
dimensions and 25 items.

Objective: The article that follows is purposed at demonstrating how IT opioid 
plus bupivacaine achieves sustained acceptable pain relief while simultaneously 
rapidly reducing oral morphine equivalents (OME). Background: Cancer patients 
represent a population with significant morbidity, pain, and limited life 
expectancy. It is, therefore, vital to achieve satisfactory analgesia quickly 
and safely. To date, there is limited data in the literature that discusses 
efficacy of combined intrathecal (IT) medication therapy in reducing systemic 
opioids in the oncological population. Methods: This was a retrospective 
analysis that reviewed cancer pain patients from day of IT pump implantation 
through the six-month postoperative time point. A cohort of 50 oncological 
patients who had intrathecal drug delivery systems (IDDSs) implanted at Memorial 
Sloan Kettering Cancer Center between 2017 and 2019 were studied. Median OMEs 
were the primary modality of analysis for this review. Mean visual analogue 
scale scores were secondarily reviewed. Results: Median OMEs decreased from 503 
preoperative to 105 at six months postoperative time point. Median time to 
discharge was 6.5 days. Unfortunately, due to malignant mortality, 27 patients 
did not make it to the 6-month postoperative time point. Discussion: IDDSs with

BACKGROUND: Patisiran, an RNA interference therapeutic, has demonstrated robust 
reduction of wild-type and mutant transthyretin protein and was able to improve 
polyneuropathy and quality of life following 18 months of treatment in patients 
with hereditary transthyretin-mediated (hATTR) amyloidosis. In this 24-month 
Phase II open-label extension study, we evaluated the effects of patisiran 
treatment (0.3 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks) on safety, serum transthyretin 
levels, and clinical parameters. Efficacy assessments included modified 
Neuropathy Impairment Score +7 (mNIS+7) and multiple disease-relevant measures. 
Cardiac assessments were performed in a pre-specified cardiac subgroup.
RESULTS: Twenty-seven patients entered this study, including 12 (44%) with 
ambulation difficulties due to their neuropathy and 11 (41%) who met criteria 
for the cardiac subgroup. During treatment, the majority of adverse events were 
mild/moderate in severity; there were no drug-related adverse events leading to 
treatment discontinuation. The most common drug-related adverse events were 
flushing and infusion-related reactions (22% each). Patisiran resulted in rapid, 
robust (~ 82%), and sustained reduction of mean transthyretin levels over 
24 months. A mean 6.95-point decrease (improvement) in mNIS+7 from baseline was 
observed at 24 months. Patisiran's impact on mNIS+7 was irrespective of 
concomitant tafamidis or diflunisal use, sex, or age. Clinical assessments of 
motor function, autonomic symptoms, disease stage, and quality of life remained 
stable over 24 months. No significant changes were observed for 
echocardiographic measures or cardiac biomarkers in the cardiac subgroup. 
Exploratory analyses demonstrated improvements in nerve-fiber density with 
corresponding reductions in amyloid burden observed in skin biopsies over 
24 months.
CONCLUSIONS: Long-term treatment with patisiran had an acceptable safety profile 
and was associated with halting/improvement of polyneuropathy progression in 
patients with hATTR amyloidosis.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (identifier: 
NCT01961921 ) on October 14, 2013.

OBJECTIVES: Linkage of electronic health records (EHRs) to Hospital Episode 
Statistics (HES)-Office for National Statistics (ONS) mortality data has 
provided compelling evidence for lower life expectancy in people with severe 
mental illness. However, linkage error may underestimate these estimates. Using 
a clinical sample (n=265 300) of individuals accessing mental health services, 
we examined potential biases introduced through missed matching and examined the 
impact on the association between clinical disorders and mortality.
SETTING: The South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust (SLaM) is a 
secondary mental healthcare provider in London. A deidentified version of SLaM's 
EHR was available via the Clinical Record Interactive Search system linked to 
HES-ONS mortality records.
PARTICIPANTS: Records from SLaM for patients active between January 2006 and 
December 2016.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Two sources of death data were available for SLaM 
participants: accurate and contemporaneous date of death via local batch tracing 
(gold standard) and date of death via linked HES-ONS mortality data. The effect 
of linkage error on mortality estimates was evaluated by comparing 
sociodemographic and clinical risk factor analyses using gold standard death 
data against HES-ONS mortality records.
RESULTS: Of the total sample, 93.74% were successfully matched to HES-ONS 
records. We found a number of statistically significant administrative, 
sociodemographic and clinical differences between matched and unmatched records. 
Of note, schizophrenia diagnosis showed a significant association with higher 
mortality using gold standard data (OR 1.08; 95% CI 1.01 to 1.15; p=0.02) but 
not in HES-ONS data (OR 1.05; 95% CI 0.98 to 1.13; p=0.16). Otherwise, little 
change was found in the strength of associated risk factors and mortality after 
accounting for missed matching bias.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite significant clinical and sociodemographic differences 
between matched and unmatched records, changes in mortality estimates were 
minimal. However, researchers and policy analysts using HES-ONS linked resources 
should be aware that administrative linkage processes can introduce error.

BACKGROUND: Descending necrotizing mediastinitis (DNM) resulting from 
oropharyngeal and cervical abscess is a life-threatening condition. This study 
attempted to improve our recognition of the extension and distribution of the 
abscess for ideal thoracic drainage.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective clinical analysis of seven patients who 
underwent thoracic drainage for DNM with available clinical data. For mapping 
and classification of the distribution of the abscess, computed tomography and 
intraoperative findings were utilized.
RESULTS: To cure patients, cervical drainage and thoracic drainage were 
performed 14 and 11 times, respectively. The operation time for thoracic 
drainage and intraoperative blood loss were 141±77 min and 103±103 g, 
respectively. The mean hospital stay was 66±41 days. All patients are alive 
without recurrence. We divided the abscess distribution into nine categories 
including the anterior thoracic wall, according to the computed tomography and 
intraoperative findings. The rate of abscess descended gradually toward the 
lower mediastinum. Abscesses were not necessarily continuous, and skipped 
lesions were occasionally noted.
CONCLUSIONS: We were able to cure all seven patients with DNM. It might be 
helpful to recognize the exact distribution of the abscess and 
distribution-specific drainage using a new map and classification of thoracic 
abscess.

BACKGROUND: As the life expectancy of cancer-bearing patients has increased, 
more patients with bone metastasis are receiving long-term treatment with 
bone-modifying agents (BMAs; e.g., zoledronate and denosumab), which are a risk 
factor for developing atypical femoral fracture (AFF). In this study, we 
surveyed the risk of iatrogenic AFF using a clinical database on treatment of 
bone metastasis in the past 10 years.
METHODS: From April 2011 through October 2019, 721 patients with bone metastasis 
(436 men, 285 women; mean age, 65.7 ± 12.4 years) were registered under the bone 
metastasis consultation system, which has been run by orthopaedic surgeons since 
2011, at a university hospital in Japan. We retrospectively reviewed the 
database to identify patients who had received BMAs for treatment of bone 
metastasis, and we investigated the incidence of critical skeletal-related 
events (including AFF) which required surgical interventions by orthopaedic 
surgeons.
RESULTS: BMAs were administered to 529 patients (73.4%). Orthopaedic surgery for 
the treatment of skeletal-related events was performed in 36 patients (5.0%): 
femur, 13 (1.8%); others, 23 (3.2%). Eight AFFs in 5 patients (breast cancer, 
n = 4; prostate cancer, n = 1), who all had prior exposure to zoledronate or 
denosumab before onset of AFF, were treated with internal fixation using 
intramedullary nailing. In 192 patients with no BMA exposure, critical 
(surgically treated) AFF was not detected. In summary, the incidence of critical 
AFF was 0.9% among 529 patients who received BMAs for treatment of bone 
metastasis, and the incidence was 6.6% when limited to breast cancer patients (4 
of 61).
CONCLUSION: In treatment of bone metastasis using BMAs, especially for breast 
cancer patients, attention should be paid to the risk of developing AFFs. 
Routine radiographic screening for AFF might be necessary in patients with 
prolonged BMA use for bone metastasis, even if asymptomatic. This report alerts 
all physicians and surgeons involved in the management of cancer patients, 
especially those with bone metastasis, regarding the risk of AFF following BMA 
use.

Challenges Confronting the Practice of Nursing in Singapore.

Chua GP(1).

Author information:

Centre Singapore, Singapore.

Singapore, a young nation like many developed countries, faced a shortage of 
nurses. Attempts to resolve the workforce shortage through the employment of 
foreign nurses started in the mid-1980s. Over the years, workforce recruitment 
from traditional sources nearby, namely Malaysia and Philippines, has expanded 
to include nurses from countries such as People Republic of China, India, and 
Myanmar. Attempts have also been made to train, recruit, and retain local nurses 
such as improving working conditions and remunerations, raising the profile of 
nursing, improving career recognition and progression, and encouraging 
nonpracticing nurses back to the workforce. However, the institutions' and the 
government's attempts to ameliorate the nursing shortage were met with limited 
success. Even with the recruitment of foreign nurses, the shortage of workforce 
persists. The shortage is compounded by the three major health-care challenges 
confronting Singapore: (1) rapid growth in population; (2) rapid aging of the 
population; and (3) increasing burden of chronic diseases. As the population 
continues to grow and as more of the population ages, as life expectancy 
increases and the burden of chronic diseases increases, not only will the demand 
for nurses continue, but the intensity and the nursing care they require will 
also increase. This article describes the challenges confronting the practice of 
nursing in Singapore and their implications. Although these challenges are 
daunting, they offer nursing the unprecedented opportunities to shape 
health-care delivery systems and increase nursing influences everywhere across 
settings and along the delivery continuum.

BACKGROUND: To investigate progression free survival (PFS), local control (LC) 
and overall survival (OS) outcomes for patients treated with spine 
hypofractionated stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) and to evaluate 
possible predictors of rapid progression in view of a correct patient selection 
for this potentially curative SABR.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cohort of 59 patients with spinal metastases were 
treated with SABR. ﻿Patient selection criteria were the following: 
histologically proven diagnosis of a solid tumor, a World Health Organization 
(WHO) score ≤ 2, life expectancy > 6 months, Spinal Instability Neoplastic Score 
(SINS) ≤ 12 points and presenting with radically treated oligometastatic disease 
(≤5 lesions) or stable polymetastatic disease with an oligoprogressive lesion.
RESULTS: From March 2015 to June 2019, 59 patients were treated with Linac-based 
SABR to 64 spinal metastases with a median follow-up of 55 months. SABR was 
standard delivered every other day in 3 to 10 fractions with median prescription 
dose of 27 Gy (range 21-49 Gy).The 1-,2- and 5-year PFS was 98%, 85% and 75% for 
all patients. OS at 5 years for all patients was 92%. Metachronous lesions 
(p < 0.01; HR = 7.1) and oligometastatic (vs. oligoprogressive) lesions 
(p = 0.02; HR = 0.3) were associated with higher PFS in uni- and multivariate 
Cox regression analysis. No significant predictors in multivariate analysis were 
demonstrated for rapid progressors.Vertebral compression fractures developed de 
novo in 6.3% (4/64) of cases. The median time to fracture was 11 months (range 
7-15) after treatment. ﻿No other adverse events ≥ 3 grade were observed.
CONCLUSIONS: Tumor control and toxicity after high-dose hypofractionated SABR 
was evaluated in patients with spinal oligometastases. High rates of efficacy 
and minimal toxicity were demonstrated. Oligometastatic patients with 
metachronous spinal metastases seem to benefit the most from SABR.

BACKGROUND: Cutaneous neurofibromas (cNFs) are the most common tumors in people 
with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and are associated with reduced quality of 
life. There is currently no widely accepted standardized language for describing 
cNFs clinically or histopathologically. The objective of this study was to 
evaluate interobserver agreement across pathologists in describing and reporting 
of neurofibromas involving the skin.
METHODS: Twenty-eight (H&E)-stained slides of cNF were scanned using an Aperio 
XT scanner. The digital images were reviewed by 6 pathologists, who entered free 
text of up to a 200 word description for each case into a REDcap database. 
Responses were analyzed for the most commonly used terms based on frequency, as 
well as agreement (reported as concordance) between reviewers.
RESULTS: A set of the terms most commonly used by pathologists for the 
histological classification of cNF along with areas of agreement and 
disagreement have been identified. The study shows that there was strong 
agreement across reviewers that not all neurofibromas involving the skin are 
cutaneous neurofibromas and regarding the presence or absence of atypical 
features and heterologous elements. Areas of less concordance were identified 
and include cNF subtypes, definition of extension and pattern of growth, as well 
as the distinction of a cNF from a plexiform without an intraneural component 
involving skin.
CONCLUSIONS: This work is the first step towards development of a robust 
classification system and devising "gold standard" histopathologic diagnostic 
criteria for cutaneous neurofibromas.

INTRODUCTION: MAGE was a Multicenter, single-Arm, observational 6-month (plus 
6-month extension) study that aimed to assess treatment satisfaction, efficacy, 
and safety of insulin Glargine 300 U/mL (Gla-300) in people with type 2 diabetes 
(T2DM) receiving basal-bolus insulin in a rEal-world setting.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Participants were at least 18 years old, with T2DM for
