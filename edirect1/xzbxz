Cancer patients often develop chronic, clinically significant symptoms of 
depression and anxiety. Previous studies suggest that psilocybin may decrease 
depression and anxiety in cancer patients. The effects of psilocybin were 
studied in 51 cancer patients with life-threatening diagnoses and symptoms of 
depression and/or anxiety. This randomized, double-blind, cross-over trial 
investigated the effects of a very low (placebo-like) dose (1 or 3 mg/70 kg) vs. 
a high dose (22 or 30 mg/70 kg) of psilocybin administered in counterbalanced 
sequence with 5 weeks between sessions and a 6-month follow-up. Instructions to 
participants and staff minimized expectancy effects. Participants, staff, and 
community observers rated participant moods, attitudes, and behaviors throughout 
the study. High-dose psilocybin produced large decreases in clinician- and 
self-rated measures of depressed mood and anxiety, along with increases in 
quality of life, life meaning, and optimism, and decreases in death anxiety. At 
6-month follow-up, these changes were sustained, with about 80% of participants 
continuing to show clinically significant decreases in depressed mood and 
anxiety. Participants attributed improvements in attitudes about life/self, 
mood, relationships, and spirituality to the high-dose experience, with >80% 
endorsing moderately or greater increased well-being/life satisfaction. 
Community observer ratings showed corresponding changes. Mystical-type 
psilocybin experience on session day mediated the effect of psilocybin dose on 
therapeutic outcomes.

The incidence of atrial fibrillation (AF) in congenital heart disease (CHD) 
adults has increased in the past decades due to a longer life expectancy of this 
population where the subjects are exposed to cardiac overflow, overpressure and 
structural changes for years. The literature regarding AF ablation in repaired 
CHD adults emphasizes the importance of intracardiac echocardiography (ICE) to 
perform the transseptal puncture and the ablation procedure in the left atrium 
(LA), both effectively and safely. In small case control studies, where the 
predominant congenital cardiomyopathy was the atrial septal defect, the most 
common strategy for ablation was antral isolation of the pulmonary veins showing 
results, at one year follow-up, similar to those in the general population. The 
positive results of AF ablation so far, in this specific population, widen the 
range of therapeutic options for a group of patients whose only chance has been 
pharmacological treatment, which has proved to be inefficacious in most of the 
cases and not free from adverse events.

BACKGROUND: Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is caused by homozygous inactivation 
of the SMN1 gene. The SMN2 copy number modulates the severity of SMA. The 
0SMN1/1SMN2 genotype, the most severe genotype compatible with life, is expected 
to be associated with the most severe form of the disease, called type 0 SMA, 
defined by prenatal onset.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to review clinical features and prenatal 
manifestations in this rare SMA subtype.
METHODS: SMA patients with the 0SMN1/1SMN2 genotype were retrospectively 
collected using the UMD-SMN1 France database.
RESULTS: Data from 16 patients were reviewed. These 16 patients displayed type 0 
SMA. At birth, a vast majority had profound hypotonia, severe muscle weakness, 
severe respiratory distress, and cranial nerves involvement (inability to 
suck/swallow, facial muscles weakness). They showed characteristics of fetal 
akinesia deformation sequence and congenital heart defects. Recurrent episodes 
of bradycardia were observed. Death occurred within the first month. At prenatal 
stage, decreased fetal movements were frequently reported, mostly only by 
mothers, in late stages of pregnancy; increased nuchal translucency was reported 
in about half of the cases; congenital heart defects, abnormal amniotic fluid 
volume, or joint contractures were occasionally reported.
CONCLUSION: Despite a prenatal onset attested by severity at birth and signs of 
fetal akinesia deformation sequence, prenatal manifestations of type 0 SMA are 
not specific and not constant. As illustrated by the frequent association with 
congenital heart defects, type 0 SMA physiopathology is not restricted to motor 
neuron, highlighting that SMN function is critical for organogenesis.

BACKGROUND: Patients are often not given the information needed to understand 
their prognosis and make informed treatment choices, with many consequently 
experiencing less than optimal care and quality-of-life at end-of-life.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy of a nurse-facilitated communication 
support program for patients with advanced, incurable cancer to assist them in 
discussing prognosis and end-of-life care.
DESIGN: A parallel-group randomised controlled trial design was used.
SETTINGS: This trial was conducted at six cancer treatment centres affiliated 
with major hospitals in Sydney, Australia.
PARTICIPANTS: 110 patients with advanced, incurable cancer participated.
METHODS: The communication support program included guided exploration of a 
question prompt list, communication challenges, patient values and concerns and 
the value of discussing end-of-life care early, with oncologists cued to endorse 
question-asking and question prompt list use. Patients were randomised after 
baseline measure completion, a regular oncology consultation was audio-recorded 
and a follow-up questionnaire was completed one month later. Communication, 
health-related quality-of-life and satisfaction measures and a manualised 
consultation-coding scheme were used. Descriptive, Mixed Modelling and 
Generalised Linear Mixed Modelling analyses were conducted using SPSS version 
22.
RESULTS: Communication support program recipients gave significantly more cues 
for discussion of prognosis, end-of-life care, future care options and general 
issues not targeted by the intervention during recorded consultations, but did 
not ask more questions about these issues or overall. Oncologists' question 
prompt list and question asking endorsement was inconsistent. Communication 
support program recipients' self-efficacy in knowing what questions to ask their 
doctor significantly improved at follow-up while control arm patients' 
self-efficacy declined. The communication support program did not impact 
patients' health-related quality-of-life or the likelihood that their health 
information or shared decision-making preferences would be met. Satisfaction 
with the communication support program was high.
CONCLUSIONS: Given the importance of clarifying prognostic expectations and 
end-of-life care wishes in the advanced cancer context, the communication 
support program appears to be an effective and well-received solution to 
encourage early information seeking related to these issues though, its 
long-term impact remains unclear. The manualised nature of the intervention, 
designed with existing clinical staff in mind, may make it suited for 
implementation in a clinical setting, though additional work is needed to 
identify why question asking was unaffected and establish its impact later in 
the illness trajectory.

BACKGROUND: Economic evaluation has been implemented to inform policy in many 
areas, including coverage decisions, technology pricing, and the development of 
clinical practice guidelines. However, there are barriers to evidence-based 
policy in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) that include limited 
stakeholder awareness, resources and data availability, as well as the lack of 
capacity to conduct country-specific economic evaluations. This study aims to 
survey health policy experts' opinions on barriers to use of cost-effectiveness 
data in these settings and to obtain their advice on how to make a new 
cost-per-DALY database being developed by Tufts Medical Center more relevant to 
LMICs. It also identifies the factors influencing transferability.
METHODS: In-depth interviews were conducted with 32 participants, including 
policymakers, technical advisors, and researchers in Health Ministries, 
universities and non-governmental organisations in Bangladesh, India (New Delhi, 
Tamil Nadu and Karnataka) and Vietnam.
RESULTS: The survey revealed that, in all settings, the use of 
cost-effectiveness information in policy development is lacking, owing to 
limited knowledge among policymakers and inadequate human resources with health 
economics expertise in the government sector. Furthermore, researchers in 
universities do not have close connections with health authorities. In India and 
Vietnam, the demand for evidence to inform coverage decisions tends to increase 
as the countries are moving towards universal health coverage. The informants in 
all countries argue that cost-effectiveness data are useful for decision-makers; 
however, most of them do not perform data searches by themselves but rely on the 
information provided by the technical advisor counterparts. Most interviewees 
were familiar with using evidence from other countries and were also aware of 
the influences of contextual elements as a limitation of transferability. 
Finally, strategies to promote the newly developed database include training on 
basic economic evaluation for policymakers and researchers, and effective 
communication programs, with support from reputable global agencies.
CONCLUSIONS: Although cost-effectiveness information is recognised as essential 
in resource allocation, there are several impediments in the generation and use 
of such evidence to inform priority setting in LMICs. As such, the Cost-per-DALY 
database should be well-designed and introduced with appropriate promotion 
strategies so that it will be helpful in real-world policymaking.

Rainfall erosivity as a dynamic factor of soil loss by water erosion is modelled 
intra-annually for the first time at European scale. The development of Rainfall 
Erosivity Database at European Scale (REDES) and its 2015 update with the 
extension to monthly component allowed to develop monthly and seasonal R-factor 
maps and assess rainfall erosivity both spatially and temporally. During winter 
months, significant rainfall erosivity is present only in part of the 
Mediterranean countries. A sudden increase of erosivity occurs in major part of 
European Union (except Mediterranean basin, western part of Britain and Ireland) 
in May and the highest values are registered during summer months. Starting from 
September, R-factor has a decreasing trend. The mean rainfall erosivity in 
summer is almost 4 times higher (315MJmmha-1h-1) compared to winter 
(87MJmmha-1h-1). The Cubist model has been selected among various statistical 
models to perform the spatial interpolation due to its excellent performance, 
ability to model non-linearity and interpretability. The monthly prediction is 
an order more difficult than the annual one as it is limited by the number of 
covariates and, for consistency, the sum of all months has to be close to annual 
erosivity. The performance of the Cubist models proved to be generally high, 
resulting in R2 values between 0.40 and 0.64 in cross-validation. The obtained 
months show an increasing trend of erosivity occurring from winter to summer 
starting from western to Eastern Europe. The maps also show a clear delineation 
of areas with different erosivity seasonal patterns, whose spatial outline was 
evidenced by cluster analysis. The monthly erosivity maps can be used to develop 
composite indicators that map both intra-annual variability and concentration of 
erosive events. Consequently, spatio-temporal mapping of rainfall erosivity 
permits to identify the months and the areas with highest risk of soil loss 
where conservation measures should be applied in different seasons of the year.

BACKGROUND: As the prevalence of and life expectancy after solid organ 
transplantation increases, some of these patients will require total hip 
arthroplasty (THA). Immunosuppressive therapy, metabolic disorders, and 
post-transplant medications may place transplant patients at higher risk of 
adverse events following surgery. The objective of this study was to compare 
inpatient complications, mortality, length of stay (LOS), and costs for THA 
patients with and without solid organ transplant history.
METHODS: A retrospective cross-sectional analysis was conducted using 1998-2011 
Nationwide Inpatient Sample. Primary THA patients were queried (n = 3,175,456). 
After exclusions, remaining patients were assigned to transplant (n = 7558) or 
non-transplant groups (n = 2,772,943). After propensity score matching, adjusted 
for patient and hospital characteristics, logistic regression and paired t-tests 
examined the effect of transplant history on outcomes.
RESULTS: Between 1998 and 2011, THA volume among transplant patients grew 
approximately 48%. The overall prevalence of one or more complications following 
THA was greater in the transplant group than in the non-transplant group (32.0% 
vs 22.1%; P < .001). In-hospital mortality was minimal, with comparable rates 
(0.1%) in both groups (P = .93). Unadjusted trends show that transplant patients 
have greater annual and overall mean LOS (4.47 days) and mean admission costs 
($18,402) than non-transplant patients (3.73 days; $16,899; P < .001). After 
propensity score matching, transplant history was associated with increased 
complication risk (odds ratio, 1.56) after THA, longer hospital LOS (+0.64 days; 
P < .001), and increased admission costs (+$887; P = .005).
CONCLUSION: Transplant patients exhibited increased odds of inpatient 
complications, longer LOS, and greater admission costs after THA compared with 
non-transplant patients.

OBJECTIVES: This study assessed whether video-electroencephalography (VEEG) 
monitoring followed by surgery was cost-effective in adult patients with 
drug-resistant focal epilepsy under Thai health care context, as compared with 
continued medical treatment without VEEG.
METHODS: The total cost (in Thai Baht, THB) and effectiveness (in 
quality-adjusted life years, QALYs) were estimated over a lifetime horizon, 
using a decision tree and a Markov model. Data on short-term surgical outcomes, 
direct health care costs, and utilities were collected from Thai patients in a 
specialized hospital. Long-term outcomes and relative effectiveness of the 
surgery over medical treatment were derived, using systematic reviews of 
published literature.
RESULTS: Seizure-free rates at years 1 and 2 after surgery were 79.4% and 77.8%, 
respectively. Costs of VEEG and surgery plus 1-year follow-up care were 216,782 
THB, of which the VEEG and other necessary investigations were the main cost 
drivers (42.8%). On the basis of societal perspective, the total cost over a 
40-year horizon accrued to 1,168,679 THB for the VEEG option, 64,939 THB higher 
than that for no VEEG. The VEEG option contributed to an additional 1.50 QALYs 
over no VEEG, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 43,251 THB 
(USD 1236) per 1 QALY gained. Changes in key parameters had a minimal impact on 
the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. Accounting for uncertainty, there was 
an 84% probability that the VEEG option was cost-effective on the basis of 
Thailand's cost-effective threshold of 160,000 THB/QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: For patients with drug-resistant epilepsy, VEEG monitoring followed 
by epilepsy surgery was cost-effective in Thailand. Therefore it should be 
recommended for health insurance coverage.

Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München, Munich, Germany.

Neutrophil granulocytes are the most abundant immune cells in the blood yet the 
pathways orchestrating their differentiation and biological function remain 
incompletely understood. Studying (ultra-) rare patients with monogenetic 
defects of neutrophil granulocytes may open new horizons to understand basic 
principles of hematopoiesis and innate immunity. Here, recent insights into 
genetic factors controlling myelopoiesis and their more general role in biology 
will be presented in a clinical perspective. Advances in supportive care, first 
and foremost the use of recombinant human granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, 
has made a substantial difference for the quality of life and life expectancy of 
patients with congenital neutropenia (CN). Up to date, the only definitive cure 
can be provided by transplantation of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cells. The 
elucidation of the underlying molecular factors contributing to defective 
differentiation and function of neutrophil granulocytes nurtures new ideas of 
targeted individualized therapies.

Chicago, Chicago, IL.

Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) remains a cornerstone of treatment of 
many hematologic malignancies but transplant-associated morbidity and mortality 
limit application to older patients. Biologic or chronologic age barriers to HCT 
have fallen, because patients in their 8th decade of life comprise the group 
with the greatest rise in transplant use over the past decade. Evaluating 
physiologic age or general health in older transplant candidates requires a 
systematic approach inclusive of functional and comorbidity assessment, which 
typically is accomplished through geriatric assessment (GA). GA incorporates 
measures of comorbidity, function, nutrition, social support, and other 
health-related domains to better describe physiologic age. Older allogeneic 
transplant patients have a surprisingly high prevalence of vulnerabilities by GA 
prior to transplant, and significant comorbidity or functional limitations 
heighten the risks of transplant-related mortality. Ultimately, incorporation of 
physiologic age can improve estimates of nondisease life expectancy, prognostic 
survival after HCT, and inform HCT candidacy. Future research on the optimal 
tools to characterize physiologic age and appropriate interventions in the 
context of transplant are needed.

Due to current demographic developments with a continuous increase in average 
life expectancy and improved medical treatment, the number of elderly patients 
with joint replacement of the lower extremities also has increased in recent 
years. Most of these patients have not only one but several chronic diseases 
requiring treatment and medication. Drug-drug interaction and functional 
restrictions of the elderly additionally reduce the postoperative psychophysical 
capacity; therefore, special knowledge in rehabilitative treatment and pain 
management is necessary. Physiotherapy and exercise should include training of 
mobility, endurance, strength, coordination and training in activities of daily 
living. The individual constitution and pain during exercise must always be 
taken into consideration. Rehabilitative outcome is dependent on a functioning 
cooperation of an interdisciplinary rehabilitation team and requires an 
organized, holistic treatment approach in interconnected structures, which aims 
at rapid postoperative mobilization.

BACKGROUND: Drug related problems have a significant clinical and economic 
burden on patients and the healthcare system. Medication review with follow-up 
(MRF) is a professional pharmacy service aimed at improving patient's health 
outcomes through an optimization of the medication.
OBJECTIVE: To ascertain the economic impact of the MRF service provided in 
community pharmacies to aged polypharmacy patients comparing MRF with usual 
care, by undertaking a cost analysis and a cost-benefit analysis.
METHODS: The economic evaluation was based on a cluster randomized controlled 
trial. Patients in the intervention group (IG) received the MRF service and the 
comparison group (CG) received usual care. The analysis was conducted from the 
national health system (NHS) perspective over 6 months. Direct medical costs 
were included and expressed in euros at 2014 prices. Health benefits were 
estimated by assigning a monetary value to the quality-adjusted life years. 
One-way deterministic sensitivity analysis was undertaken in order to analyse 
the uncertainty.
RESULTS: The analysis included 1403 patients (IG: n = 688 vs CG: n = 715). The 
cost analysis showed that the MRF saved 97 € per patient in 6 months. 
Extrapolating data to 1 year and assuming a fee for service of 22 € per 
patient-month, the estimated savings were 273 € per patient-year. The 
cost-benefit ratio revealed that for every 1 € invested in MRF, a benefit of 
3.3 € to 6.2 € was obtained.
CONCLUSION: The MRF provided health benefits to patients and substantial cost 
savings to the NHS. Investment in this service would represent an efficient use 
of healthcare resources.

BACKGROUND: Policymakers need to know the cost-effectiveness of interventions to 
prevent type 2 diabetes (T2D). The objective of this study was to estimate the 
cost-effectiveness of a T2D prevention initiative targeting weight reduction, 
increased physical activity and healthier diet in persons in pre-diabetic states 
by comparing a hypothetical intervention versus no intervention in a Swedish 
setting.
METHODS: A Markov model was used to study the cost-effectiveness of a T2D 
prevention program based on lifestyle change versus a control group where no 
prevention was applied. Analyses were done deterministically and 
probabilistically based on Monte Carlo simulation for six different scenarios 
defined by sex and age groups (30, 50, 70 years). Cost and quality adjusted life 
year (QALY) differences between no intervention and intervention and incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were estimated and visualized in 
cost-effectiveness planes (CE planes) and cost-effectiveness acceptability 
curves (CEA curves).
RESULTS: All ICERs were cost-effective and ranged from 3833 €/QALY gained 
(women, 30 years) to 9215 €/QALY gained (men, 70 years). The CEA curves showed 
that the probability of the intervention being cost-effective at the threshold 
value of 50,000 € per QALY gained was very high for all scenarios ranging from 
85.0 to 91.1%.
DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: The prevention or the delay of the onset of T2D is 
feasible and cost-effective. A small investment in healthy lifestyle with change 
in physical activity and diet together with weight loss are very likely to be 
cost-effective.

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited haemoglobin disorder, associated with 
recurrent painful episodes, ongoing haemolytic anaemia and progressive 
multi-organ damage. Until the early 1990s, survival beyond the fourth decade for 
a patient with SCD was considered unusual and prompted case reports. Nowadays, 
in countries with developed health care systems, more than 90 percent of 
newborns with SCD survive into adulthood. Nevertheless, their life expectancy is 
still shortened by more than two decades compared to the general population. 
With an increasing life expectancy, SCD has now evolved into a debilitating 
disorder with substantial morbidity resulting from ongoing sickle cell 
vasculopathy and multi-organ damage. Limited data on health care issues of older 
adults with SCD poses multiple challenges to patients, their families and health 
care providers. In this review, we will address and discuss acute and chronic 
complications of SCD with a special focus on the older adult.

INTRODUCTION: Tobacco use remains a leading modifiable cause of cancer incidence 
and premature mortality in the U.S. and globally. Despite increasing life 
expectancy worldwide, less is known about the effects of cigarette smoking on 
older populations. This study sought to determine the effects of smoking on 
mortality in older age.
METHODS: Associations of mortality with self-reported age at smoking cessation, 
age at smoking initiation, and amount smoked after age 70 years were examined in 
160,113 participants of the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study aged >70 years. 
Participants completed a questionnaire detailing their smoking use in 2004-2005, 
and were followed for mortality through December 31, 2011. Analyses were 
conducted between 2014 and 2016.
RESULTS: Relative to never smokers, current smokers were more likely to die 
during follow-up (hazard ratio, 3.18; 95% CI=3.04, 3.31). Furthermore, former 
smokers had lower risks than current smokers (hazard ratios for quitting between 
ages 30-39, 40-49, 50-59, and 60-69 years were 0.41 [95% CI=0.39, 0.43], 0.51 
[95% CI=0.49, 0.54], 0.64 [95% CI=0.61, 0.67], and 0.77 [95% CI=0.73, 0.81], 
respectively). Among current smokers, mortality was inversely associated with 
age at initiation, but directly associated with the number of cigarettes smoked 
per day at age >70 years.
CONCLUSIONS: As among younger people, lifetime cigarette smoking history is a 
key determinant of mortality after age 70 years.

In 2001, the World Health Assembly (WHA) passed the landmark WHA 54.19 
resolution for global scale-up of mass administration of anthelmintic drugs for 
morbidity control of schistosomiasis and soil-transmitted helminthiasis, which 
affect more than 1·5 billion of the world's poorest people. Since then, more 
than a decade of research and experience has yielded crucial knowledge on the 
control and elimination of these helminthiases. However, the global strategy has 
remained largely unchanged since the original 2001 WHA resolution and associated 
WHO guidelines on preventive chemotherapy. In this Personal View, we highlight 
recent advances that, taken together, support a call to revise the global 
strategy and guidelines for preventive chemotherapy and complementary 
interventions against schistosomiasis and soil-transmitted helminthiasis. These 
advances include the development of guidance that is specific to goals of 
morbidity control and elimination of transmission. We quantify the result of 
forgoing this opportunity by computing the yearly disease burden, mortality, and 
lost economic productivity associated with maintaining the status quo. Without 
change, we estimate that the population of sub-Saharan Africa will probably lose 
2·3 million disability-adjusted life-years and US$3·5 billion of economic 
productivity every year, which is comparable to recent acute epidemics, 
including the 2014 Ebola and 2015 Zika epidemics. We propose that the time is 
now to strengthen the global strategy to address the substantial disease burden 
of schistosomiasis and soil-transmitted helminthiasis.

The ethics of unilateral implantable cardioverter defibrillators and cardiac 
resynchronization therapy with defibrillator deactivation: patient perspectives.

Medical Center, 1959 NE Pacific Street, PO Box 356422, Seattle, WA 98195, USA.

AIMS: Decisions about deactivation of implantable cardioverter defibrillators 
(ICDs) are complicated. Unilateral do-not-resuscitate (DNR) orders (against 
patient/family wishes) have been ethically justified in cases of medical 
futility. Unilateral deactivation of ICDs may be seen as a logical extension of 
a unilateral DNR order. However, the ethical implications of unilateral ICD 
deactivation have not been explored.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Sixty patients who had an ICD or cardiac resynchronization 
therapy with defibrillator (CRT-D) were interviewed at a quaternary medical 
centre outpatient electrophysiology practice. Survey questions addressed whether 
deactivation of defibrillator function was included in advanced directives, 
whether deactivation constitutes physician-assisted suicide, and whether 
unilateral deactivation can be ethically justified. Responses were elicited to 
scenarios in which defibrillation function was deactivated in different contexts 
(including patient request to deactivate, existing DNR, and unilateral 
deactivation). Only 15% of respondents had thought about device deactivation if 
they were to develop a serious illness from which they were not expected to 
recover. A majority (53%) had advance directives, but only one mentioned what to 
do with the device. However, a majority (78%) did not consider deactivation of 
an ICD shocking function against patients' wishes to be ethical or moral.
CONCLUSION: Management of ICDs and CRT-Ds as patients near the end of their 
lives creates ethical dilemmas. Few patients consider device deactivation at 
end-of-life, although a large majority believes that unilateral deactivation is 
not ethical/moral, even in the setting of medical futility. Advance care 
planning for these patients should address device deactivation.

A new era for drinking? Epidemiological evidence on adolescent male-female 
differences in drinking incidence in the United States and Europe.

Lansing, MI, 48824, USA. janthony@msu.edu.

PURPOSE: We seek answers to three questions about adolescent risk of starting to 
drink alcoholic beverages: (1) in new United States (US) data, can we reproduce 
a recently discovered female excess risk? (2) has a female excess risk emerged 
in European countries? and (3) might the size of country-level female-male 
differences (FMD) be influenced by macro-level gender equality and development 
processes?
METHODS: Estimates are from US and European surveys of adolescents, 
2010-2014. For US estimates, newly incident drinking refers to consuming the 
first full drink during the 12-month interval just prior to assessment. For all 
countries, lifetime cumulative incidence of drinking refers to any drinking 
before assessment of the sampled 15-16 years.
RESULTS: Cumulative meta-analysis summary estimates from the US show a highly 
reproducible female excess in newly incident drinking among 12-17 years (final 
estimated female-male difference in risk, FMD = 2.1%; 95% confidence 
interval = 1.5%, 2.7%). Several European countries show female excess risk, 
estimated as lifetime cumulative incidence of drinking onsets before age 
17 years. At the country level, the observed magnitude of FMD in risk is 
positively associated with the Gender Development Index (especially facets 
related to education and life expectancy of females relative to males), and with 
residence in a higher income European country.
CONCLUSIONS: New FMD estimates support reproducibility of a female excess risk 
in the US. In Europe, evidence of a female excess is modest. Educational 
attainment, life expectancies, and income merit attention in future FMD research 
on suspected macro-level processes that influence drinking onsets.

BACKGROUND: Universal vaccination against rotavirus was included in the funded 
Australian National Immunisation Program in July 2007. Predictive 
cost-effectiveness models assessed the program before introduction.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective economic evaluation of the Australian 
rotavirus program using national level post-implementation data on vaccine 
uptake, before-after measures of program impact and published estimates of 
excess intussusception cases. These data were used as inputs into a multi-cohort 
compartmental model which assigned cost and quality of life estimates to 
relevant health states, adopting a healthcare payer perspective. The primary 
outcome was discounted cost per quality adjusted life year gained, including or 
excluding unspecified acute gastroenteritis (AGE) hospitalisations.
RESULTS: Relative to the baseline period (1997-2006), over the 6years 
(2007-2012) after implementation of the rotavirus program, we estimated that 
∼77,000 hospitalisations (17,000 coded rotavirus and 60,000 unspecified AGE) and 
∼3 deaths were prevented, compared with an estimated excess of 78 cases of 
intussusception. Approximately 90% of hospitalisations prevented were in 
children <5years, with evidence of herd protection in older age groups. The 
program was cost-saving when observed changes (declines) in both 
hospitalisations coded as rotavirus and as unspecified AGE were attributed to 
the rotavirus vaccine program. The adverse impact of estimated excess cases of 
intussusception was far outweighed by the benefits of the program.
CONCLUSION: The inclusion of herd impact and declines in unspecified AGE 
hospitalisations resulted in the value for money achieved by the Australian 
rotavirus immunisation program being substantially greater than predicted 
bypre-implementation models, despite the potential increased cases of 
intussusception. This Australian experience is likely to be relevant to 
high-income countries yet to implement rotavirus vaccination programs.
