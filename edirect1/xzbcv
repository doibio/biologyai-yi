OBJECTIVE: To estimate the economic burden of vision loss and eye disorders in 
the United States population younger than 40 years in 2012.
DESIGN: Econometric and statistical analysis of survey, commercial claims, and 
census data.
PARTICIPANTS: The United States population younger than 40 years in 2012.
METHODS: We categorized costs based on consensus guidelines. We estimated 
medical costs attributable to diagnosed eye-related disorders, undiagnosed 
vision loss, and medical vision aids using Medical Expenditure Panel Survey and 
MarketScan data. The prevalence of vision impairment and blindness were 
estimated using National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data. We 
estimated costs from lost productivity using Survey of Income and Program 
Participation. We estimated costs of informal care, low vision aids, special 
education, school screening, government spending, and transfer payments based on 
published estimates and federal budgets. We estimated quality-adjusted life 
years (QALYs) lost based on published utility values.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Costs and QALYs lost in 2012.
RESULTS: The economic burden of vision loss and eye disorders among the United 
States population younger than 40 years was $27.5 billion in 2012 (95% 
confidence interval, $21.5-$37.2 billion), including $5.9 billion for children 
and $21.6 billion for adults 18 to 39 years of age. Direct costs were $14.5 
billion, including $7.3 billion in medical costs for diagnosed disorders, $4.9 
billion in refraction correction, $0.5 billion in medical costs for undiagnosed 
vision loss, and $1.8 billion in other direct costs. Indirect costs were $13 
billion, primarily because of $12.2 billion in productivity losses. In addition, 
vision loss cost society 215 000 QALYs.
CONCLUSIONS: We found a substantial burden resulting from vision loss and eye 
disorders in the United States population younger than 40 years, a population 
excluded from previous studies. Monetizing quality-of-life losses at $50 000 per 
QALY would add $10.8 billion in additional costs, indicating a total economic 
burden of $38.2 billion. Relative to previously reported estimates for the 
population 40 years of age and older, more than one third of the total cost of 
vision loss and eye disorders may be incurred by persons younger than 40 years.

Proteotyping for the rapid identification of influenza virus and other 
biopathogens.

Australia. k.downard@sydney.edu.au.

The influenza virus is one of the most deadly infectious agents known to man and 
has been responsible for the deaths of some hundred million lives throughout 
human history. The need to rapidly and reliably survey circulating virus strains 
down to the molecular level is ever present. This tutorial describes the 
development and application of a new proteotyping approach that harnesses the 
power of high resolution of mass spectrometry to characterise the influenza 
virus, and by extension other bacterial and viral pathogens. The approach is 
shown to be able to type, subtype, and determine the lineage of human influenza 
virus strains through the detection of one or more signature peptide ions in the 
mass spectrum of whole virus digests. Pandemic strains can be similarly 
distinguished from seasonal ones, and new computer algorithms have been written 
to allow reassorted strains that pose the greatest pandemic risk to be rapidly 
identified from such datasets. The broader application of the approach is 
further demonstrated here for the parainfluenza virus, a virus which can be life 
threatening to children and presents similar clinical symptoms to influenza.

Pediatric neuromuscular disorders comprise a large variety of disorders that can 
be classified based on their neuroanatomical localization, patterns of weakness, 
and laboratory test results. Over the last decade, the field of translational 
research has been active with many ongoing clinical trials. This is particularly 
so in two common pediatric neuromuscular disorders: Duchenne muscular dystrophy 
and spinal muscular atrophy. Although no definitive therapy has yet been found, 
numerous active areas of research raise the potential for novel therapies in 
these two disorders, offering hope for improved quality of life and life 
expectancy for affected individuals.

Ethical Dilemma and Management of Infertility in HIV Seropositive Discordant 
Couples: A Case Study in Nigeria.

Umeora O(1), Chukwuneke F.

Author information:
(1)Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, College of Medicine, Ebonyi State 
University Teaching Hospital, Abakaliki, Nigeria.

The traditional African society places an invaluable premium on procreation and, 
in some communities, a woman's place in her matrimony is only confirmed on 
positive reproductive outcome. Infertility is rife in Nigeria, and HIV/acquired 
immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) infection is a global pandemic, which has led 
to a drop in life expectancy across the world. In Nigeria, a number of cultural 
norms relating to gender roles and power dynamics constitute a serious barrier 
to issues of sexuality and infertility. Couples are concerned about their 
infertility diagnostic test being disclosed to each other, especially before 
marriage. This concern is understandable, especially in an environment that 
lacks the modern concepts and attitude toward sexual matters. This is 
complicated by the advent of HIV/AIDS infection and the societal mind-set that 
look at seropostive individuals as transgressors. At present, sexual and 
reproductive health rights are currently not in place because ethical issues are 
not given prominence by many physicians in Nigeria. A case of an infertile and 
seropostive discordant couple, which raised a lot of medical and ethical 
concerns, is presented here to awaken the consciousness of Nigerian physicians 
and stimulate discussions on the ethical matters such as this in clinical 
practice.

BACKGROUND: The Indian population is overwhelmed by the rapid developmental 
activities in the new millennium. This has brought in urbanization and several 
banes of the faster life. Alcoholism is one among the menaces which have to be 
tackled at an early stage.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the subjective expectancies from alcohol intake in young 
college students.
METHODS: We carried out a survey on the expectancy from youth of the alcohol 
effects, which in fact is known as the principal motivator of alcohol intake. We 
chose the pre-university students (n= 200; 100 males and 100 females) of one of 
the oldest and prestigious colleges of Mangalore (south India). The survey used 
the Comprehensive Effect of Alcohol (CEOA) where the students had to respond to 
two sets of 38 questions, in which they would mention whether they agreed or 
disagreed to the statement regarding the effects of alcohol intake.
RESULTS: From the results, we found that these young students were in agreement 
of the view that alcohol could cause a positive reinforcement. They also 
strongly agreed that alcohol consumption could cause negative effects. This was 
significantly more pronounced among the girls. Strikingly, only 25% of the boys 
and 14.5% of girls had consumed alcohol before, who indicated a stronger 
positive reinforce response as compared to those who had not tasted alcohol.
CONCLUSIONS: The results reveal that the first exposure to alcohol consumption 
is the key factor which leads to alcoholism. If the experience of alcohol intake 
and the effects of alcohol are liked with the subjects, that becomes a 
motivating factor for future attempts. This needs a closer look by the 
clinicians, counselors and the parents, who need to actively interfere in 
educating the youth and in guiding them in the right direction during their 
formative ages.

Prevention and wellness across the lifespan.

Benjamin GC(1).

Author information:

Life expectancy in the United States is more than 30 years longer than in 1900, 
thanks to a number of health care and public health interventions. Yet with that 
success come both benefits and challenges. As we live longer, we continue to 
age. New chronic diseases emerge as our body parts wear out or as the result of 
our lifestyle. However, aging does not necessarily mean that getting sicker is 
inevitable. It is possible to live longer with a high quality of life--even for 
those with chronic diseases. To do so takes an early investment in wellness and 
an approach to life that centers on prevention, as pointed out in the 2012 
American Public Health Association Annual Meeting.

Services just for men? Insights from a national study of the Well Men Services 
Pilots.

Aberdeen, UK. f.douglas@abdn.ac.uk

BACKGROUND: Men continue to have a lower life expectancy in most countries 
compared to women. Explanations of this gendered health inequality tend to focus 
on male risk taking, unhealthy lifestyle choices and resistance to seeking help 
from health services. In the period 2005-2008 the Scottish Government funded a 
nationwide community health promotion programme aimed at improving men's health, 
called Well Men Service Pilots (henceforth WMS).
METHOD: This paper explores WMS programme users' perspectives and experiences of 
health help-seeking against theories of hegemonic masculinity as explanatory 
frameworks for men's behaviour around health and illness, and their views on a 
male-specific focus of the programme. It is based on a secondary analysis of 43 
semi-structured interviews with men who engaged with this programme.
RESULTS: We challenge the commonly held notion of men as being disinterested in 
their health, and point to their heterogeneity in relation to their views about 
health and notions of health seeking. Moreover, men in our study were largely 
ambivalent about the need for gender specific services, despite their positive 
reactions to the programme in general.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings question the utility of some theories of masculinity 
that posit somewhat simplistic explanations for men's reluctance to seek help 
from formal healthcare services. They also suggest that providing male-specific 
health services may not significantly address men's supposed reluctance to seek 
help from formal health services. Essentially, age seemed to be more important 
than gender. All encompassing health programmes are likely to fail to meet their 
health improvement objectives if they attempt to engage with men on the simple 
basis that they are male.

Synergetic and antagonist muscle strength and activity in women with knee 
osteoarthritis.

Science of Serres, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: People with knee osteoarthritis (OA) display limitations 
in daily activities and a lower quality of life. The purpose of this study was 
to investigate the differences in strength balance and activation during maximum 
strength efforts between women with knee OA and asymptomatic women.
METHODS: Twelve women with knee OA (age 60.33 ± 6.66 years) and 11 controls (age 
56.54 ± 5.46 years) performed maximum isokinetic eccentric and concentric knee 
extension and flexion tests at 60°/s, 120°/s, and 150°/s. Surface 
electromyography (EMG) was recorded from the biceps femoris (BF), vastus 
lateralis (VL), and vastus medialis (VM). Hamstrings-to-quadriceps moment ratios 
(H/Q), the synergetic (VL/VM), and co-contraction (BF/[VM + VL]) EMG ratios were 
calculated.
RESULTS: Analysis-of-variance designs showed that women experiencing knee OA had 
significantly higher H/Q moment ratios and VM/VL EMG ratios than controls (P < 
0.05). The co-contraction index was significantly lower in the OA group only 
during knee flexion (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Women with knee OA showed a higher H/Q moment ratios probably 
because of the need for better joint stability or a lower quadriceps capacity. 
This deficiency was accompanied by a higher VM activation, which probably serves 
to stabilize the patella upon maximum contraction as well as a higher activation 
of antagonist muscles.

National Taiwan University College of Medicine, Taipei;

BACKGROUND: This study compared the lifetime costs for peritoneal dialysis (PD) 
and hemodialysis (HD) patients in Taiwan.
METHODS: Using the National Health Insurance (NHI) database of all end-stage 
renal disease patients on maintenance dialysis registered from July 1997 to 
December 2005, we matched eligible PD patients with eligible HD patients on age, 
sex, and diabetes status. The matched patients were followed until 31 December 
2006. Patients were excluded if they were less than 18 years of age, had been 
diagnosed with cancer before dialysis, or had been dialyzed at centers or 
clinics other than hospitals. Outcomes-including life expectancy, total lifetime 
costs, and costs per life-year paid by the NHI-were estimated and compared.
RESULTS: The 3136 pairs of matched PD and HD patients had a mean age of 53.2 ± 
15.4 years. The total lifetime cost for PD patients (US$139 360 ± US$8 336) was 
significantly lower than that for HD patients (US$185 235 ± US$9 623, p < 
0.001). Except for patients with diabetes (who had a short life expectancy), the 
total lifetime cost was significantly lower for PD patients than for HD patients 
regardless of sex and age (p < 0.01).
CONCLUSION: In Taiwan, the total lifetime costs paid by the NHI were lower for 
PD than for HD patients.

Increased life expectancy and cancer incidence imply the need to develop a 
specialized care policy for elderly patients with cancer. We created an 
oncogeriatric consulting team (OGCT) in Toulouse University Hospital to carry 
out comprehensive gerontological assessment at the bedside of hospitalized 
patients. We analyze the impact on the final cancer treatment decision of this 
mobile geriatric assessment. We carried out a descriptive, retrospective 
real-life analysis of a patient cohort over a two-year period. The OGCT assessed 
124 patients, of whom the majority were women (54.8%), median age 81 years, 
living at home (95.2%) and with family caregivers (86.5%). Nearly all were frail 
(96.7% according to the classification of Balducci and colleagues) and 3.2% were 
vulnerable. The team's decisions were analyzed for patients who had not yet been 
treated (n=107). After analysis, the team's proposal was in line with the 
initial cancer treatment plan in 68.2% of cases (n=73). In cases where there was 
a disagreement, the final decision was in line with the mobile team's proposal 
in 17.75% of 107 patients (n=19). The decision of the team was followed more 
often when their assessment proposed strictly palliative treatment. The decision 
to give elderly patients specific cancer treatment seems in our experience 
rather to be a matter for the oncologists, and is not very susceptible to 
modification by geriatric opinion. On the other hand, the geriatrician appears 
to be more credible and his/her opinion more likely to be followed when the 
patient is considered too frail and less aggressive, or even exclusively 
palliative, treatment is proposed.

Measuring functional outcome after total hip replacement with subject-specific 
hip joint loading.

Total hip replacement is an often-performed orthopedic surgical procedure; the 
amount of procedures undertaken will increase since our life expectancy is 
growing. In order to optimize function, hip biomechanics should be restored to 
as near normal as possible. The goal of this pilot study was to determine 
whether or not it is feasible to compute the vectorial hip reaction force 
pathways on the head of the prosthesis and the force angles relative to the cup 
of the prosthesis that occur during gait in total hip replacement patients, 
serving as an objective measurement of the functional outcome following hip 
replacement. A three-dimensional gait analysis, measuring ground reaction forces 
and kinematics, was performed. The data retrieved from the gait analysis was 
used as the input for the musculoskeletal model to compute vectorial joint 
reaction forces for data processing. To evaluate the position and orientation of 
the joint reaction forces, the force path, as well as the force angles for the 
operated and non-operated joint, has been calculated during the stance phase of 
the specific leg. The force path for subject 2 on the non-operated side is only 
located in the posterior-lateral quarter, as is the force path for subject 1. In 
contrast to this subject, the force path for subject 2 at the operated hip joint 
can be found only within the anterior quarter of the head of the implant, where 
it is nearly equally distributed in the medio-lateral half of the prosthesis 
head. The force-inclination angles on the cup of subject 1, with respect to the 
plane of the socket face, indicates that the force vector is mainly positioned 
in the same quadrant when compared with subject 2 (in a cup-fixed coordinate 
system). The force-anteversion angle behaves similarly to the force-inclination 
angle, even when the effects are not as pronounced. The proposed methods in this 
article are aiming to define two functional outcomes of total hip replacement 
that are related to wear and rim loading. It is accepted that wear is not only a 
function of time, but a function of use. Owing to the methods listed in this 
article, we are able to determine a) the applied force and b) the sliding 
distance (force pathway) in a subject-specific manner. The computed hip-reaction 
force angles and the distance to the rim cup are a measurement for cup or rim 
loading, and occurs in the so-called safe-zones. This method may well give us 
insight into the biomechanical situation during gait, after receiving total hip 
replacement, that we need to fully understand the mechanisms acting on a hip 
joint and to prove a possible increase of functional outcome after receiving 
total hip replacement.

Bariatric surgery for the treatment of severely obese patients in South 
Korea--is it cost effective?

BACKGROUND: In South Korea, the number of severely obese patients has increased. 
An economic study comparing bariatric surgery with nonsurgical interventions has 
not been published for Asia.
OBJECTIVES: This study was conducted to evaluate the cost effectiveness of 
bariatric surgery as compared to nonsurgical interventions for severe obese 
Korean people.
METHODS: We used the Markov model to compare the lifetime expected costs and 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) between bariatric surgery and nonsurgical 
interventions from Korean Healthcare system perspectives. Our target cohort 
consisted of severe obese people defined as having a body mass index of 30-<40 
kg/m(2) in South Korea. The starting age of the cohort was 30 years old, and the 
cycle length was 1 year. Nonsurgical interventions included a physician visit, 
exercise, diet, and pharmacotherapy. A discount of 5 % was applied in cost and 
QALY. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of bariatric surgery 
compared to nonsurgery interventions was calculated.
RESULTS: The cost-utility analysis study indicated that bariatric surgery had 
US$1,522 incremental costs and 0.86 incremental QALYs as compared to nonsurgical 
interventions. Through the base case analysis, ICER was US$1,771/QALY. The 
sensitivity analyses were performed using a variety of assumptions, and the 
robustness of the study results was also demonstrated.
CONCLUSION: The study indicated that bariatric surgery was a cost-effective 
alternative to nonsurgical interventions over a lifetime, providing substantial 
lifetime benefits for severely obese Korean people.

University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. haaz59@yahoo.com

OBJECTIVE: To determine the effects of applying a natural polymer solution 
(shellac) to dry gangrene, and thereby prevent infection and progression to wet 
gangrene, in diabetic patients.
METHODS: This randomized, controlled, pilot study included patients with type 2 
diabetes mellitus who had unreconstructable peripheral vascular disease and were 
awaiting autoamputation. Eligible patients were contraindicated for surgery, had 
a limited life expectancy and/or had refused surgical amputations. All patients 
received the best possible medical treatment and were randomized to receive 
either topical shellac or antiseptic application of 10% povidone-iodine (PVP-I) 
solution to gangrenous areas.
RESULTS: A total of 26 diabetic patients were eligible for inclusion, of whom 23 
completed the study: 13 were treated with shellac and 10 with PVP-I. The 
amputation rate was higher in the conventional treatment group versus the 
shellac group (60.0% versus 46.2%, respectively), although this difference was 
not statistically significant.
CONCLUSIONS: Shellac is a natural solution that may be used to embalm gangrenous 
tissue in selected diabetic patients. More studies are needed to assess the 
long-term outcomes of this technique.

BACKGROUND: Few studies have analysed the effects of income inequality on health 
in developing countries, particularly during economic growth, reduction of 
social disparities and reinforcement of the welfare and healthcare system. We 
evaluated the association between income inequality and life expectancy in 
Brazil, including the effect of social and health interventions, in the period 
2000-2009.
METHODS: A panel dataset was created for the 27 Brazilian states over the 
referred time period. Multivariable linear regressions were performed using 
fixed-effects estimation with heteroscedasticity and serial correlation robust 
SEs. Models were fitted for life expectancy as a dependent variable, using the 
Gini index or a percentile income dispersion ratio as the main independent 
variable, and for demographic, socioeconomic and healthcare-related determinants 
as covariates.
RESULTS: The Gini index, as the other measure of income inequality, was 
negatively associated with life expectancy (p<0.05), even after adjustment for 
all the socioeconomic and health-related covariates. The Family Health Program, 
the main primary healthcare (PHC) programme of the country, was positively 
associated with life expectancy (p<0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: In recent years, effective social policies have enabled Brazil to 
partially reduce absolute poverty and income inequality, contributing-together 
with PHC-to decreasing death rates in the population. Reducing income inequality 
may represent an important step towards improving health and increasing life 
expectancy, particularly in developing countries where inequalities are high.

PURPOSE: To determine the effects of progressive resistance training on 
mobility, muscle strength, and quality of life in nursing-home residents with 
impaired mobility.
METHODS: Nursing-home residents aged 77 years and older with impaired mobility 
were recruited in Berlin, Germany. The eight-week exercise program consisted of 
progressive resistance training twice a week. Mobility (primary outcome) was 
assessed with the Elderly Mobility Scale (zero = worst, 20 = best) at baseline 
and after 8 weeks. Muscle strength (secondary outcome) was determined by the 
eight-repetition maximum. The Short Form-36 Health Survey was used to assess 
quality of life.
RESULTS: Of the 15 participants (mean age 84 years, range 77-97 years), ten 
completed the 8-week program. Mobility (Elderly Mobility Scale mean ± standard 
deviation pre 14.1 ± 3.2 and post 17.5 ± 3.6; P = 0.005) as well as muscle 
strength of upper and lower limbs improved (from 62% at chest press up to 108% 
at leg extension machine), whereas most quality of life subscales did not show 
considerable change.
CONCLUSION: Resistance training twice a week over 2 months seemed to 
considerably improve mobility and muscle strength in persons aged 77-97 years 
with impaired mobility.

Republic of China.

Mushroom β-glucans are potent immunological stimulators in medicine, but their 
productivities are very low. In this study, we successfully improved its 
production by promoter engineering in Pleurotus ostreatus. The promoter for 
β-1,3-glucan synthase gene (GLS) was replaced by the promoter of 
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene of Aspergillus nidulans. The 
homologous recombination fragment for swapping GLS promoter comprised five 
segments, which were fused by two rounds of combined touchdown PCR and overlap 
extension PCR (TD-OE PCR), and was introduced into P. ostreatus through 
PEG/CaCl2-mediated protoplast transformation. The transformants exhibited one to 
three fold higher transcription of GLS gene and produced 32% to 131% higher 
yield of β-glucans than the wild type. The polysaccharide yields had a 
significant positive correlation to the GLS gene expression. The infrared 
spectra of the polysaccharides all displayed the typical absorption peaks of 
β-glucans. This is the first report of successful swapping of promoters in 
filamentous fungi.

BACKGROUND: Turnover of mRNA is a critical step in the regulation of gene 
expression, and an important step in mRNA decay is removal of the 5' cap. We 
previously demonstrated that the expression of some immediate early gene mRNAs 
is controlled by RNA stability during early differentiation of 3T3-L1 
preadipocytes.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here we show that the mouse decapping protein 
Dcp1a is phosphorylated via the ERK signaling pathway during early 
differentiation of preadipocytes. Mass spectrometry analysis and site-directed 
mutagenesis combined with a kinase assay identified ERK pathway-mediated dual 
phosphorylation at Ser 315 and Ser 319 of Dcp1a. To understand the functional 
effects of Dcp1a phosphorylation, we examined protein-protein interactions 
between Dcp1a and other decapping components with co-immunoprecipitation. Dcp1a 
interacted with Ddx6 and Edc3 through its proline-rich C-terminal extension, 
whereas the conserved EVH1 (enabled vasodilator-stimulated protein homology 1) 
domain in the N terminus of Dcp1a showed a stronger interaction with Dcp2. Once 
ERK signaling was activated, the interaction between Dcp1a and Ddx6, Edc3, or 
Edc4 was not affected by Dcp1a phosphorylation. Phosphorylated Dcp1a did, 
however, enhanced interaction with Dcp2. Protein complexes immunoprecipitated 
with the recombinant phosphomimetic Dcp1a(S315D/S319D) mutant contained more 
Dcp2 than did those immunoprecipitated with the nonphosphorylated 
Dcp1a(S315A/S319A) mutant. In addition, Dcp1a associated with AU-rich element 
(ARE)-containing mRNAs such as MAPK phosphatase-1 (MKP-1), whose mRNA stability 
was analyzed under the overexpression of Dcp1a constructs in the Dcp1a knockdown 
3T3-L1 cells.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our findings suggest that ERK-phosphorylated Dcp1a 
enhances its interaction with the decapping enzyme Dcp2 during early 
differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells.

Care Management, Ingolstädter Landstraße, Neuherberg, Germany.

BACKGROUND: Several risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD) have been 
identified in recent decades. However, the association between the health system 
and the burden of CVD has not yet been sufficiently researched. The objective of 
this study was to analyse the association between health system development and 
the burden of CVD, in particular CVD-related disability-adjusted life-years 
(DALYs).
METHODS: Univariate and multivariate generalized linear mixed models were 
applied to country-level data collected by the World Bank and World Health 
Organization. Response variables were the age-standardized CVD mortality and 
age-standardized CVD DALY rates.
RESULTS: The amount of available health system resources, indicated by total 
health expenditures per capita, physician density, nurse density, dentistry 
density, pharmaceutical density and the density of hospital beds, was associated 
with reduced CVD DALY rates and CVD mortality. However, in the multivariate 
models, the density of nurses and midwives was positively associated with CVD. 
High out-of-pocket costs were associated with increased CVD mortality in both 
univariate and multivariate analyses.
CONCLUSION: A highly developed health system with a low level of out-of-pocket 
costs seems to be the most appropriate to reduce the burden of CVD. Furthermore, 
an efficient balance between human health resources and health technologies is 
essential.

Improving but inferior survival in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia in 
taiwan: a population-based study, 1990-2004.

University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.

BACKGROUND: Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is much less prevalent in Asian 
countries. Whether there are differences in survival outcomes between the East 
and West, however, remain unclear.
METHODS: The survival data for CLL patients identified in the Taiwan Cancer 
Registry database between 1990 and 2004, together with corresponding data in the 
US Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database, were retrieved. The 
relative survivals (RS, adjusted for the expected survival in the general 
population) were estimated in patients diagnosed in three 5-year periods of 
time.
RESULTS: CLL drastically shortened patients' life expectancy; more importantly, 
this negative impact in Taiwan was much larger than that in the US: the 5-year 
RS in Taiwan and US were 59% and 76%, and the 10-year RS, 45% and 56%, 
respectively. Nevertheless, survival in Taiwan was better in the periods after 
1995 (5-year RS, from 53.0% to 60.6%), a time period corresponding to the 
introduction of the Taiwan National Health Insurance scheme. Such improvement 
was largely due to decreased mortality in patients younger than 65 (5-year RS, 
from 53.5% to 69.1%). Despite the improvement, patients' RS in Taiwan in recent 
periods remain steadily 15∼20% inferior to that in the US in both younger and 
older patient groups.
CONCLUSIONS: The improved RS in Taiwan implies that therapeutic advances are 
changing the prognosis of CLL. The stable RS gap between Taiwanese and the US 
patients suggests the existence of an ethnic difference in CLL patients' 
outcomes.

With the widespread availability of highly active antiretroviral therapy 
(HAART), and increased life expectancy among HIV-infected individuals, 
liver-related mortality has emerged as the leading cause of non-AIDS-related 
death. The incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a sequela of chronic 
liver disease, is rising among HIV-infected individuals. While women are 
increasingly and disproportionately affected by HIV, little is known about HCC 
in HIV-infected women given HCC's predilection for men. In 2007, 2 out of 398 
HIV-infected women seen at a Rhode Island HIV clinic were diagnosed with HCC. Of 
351 HIV-infected individuals with HCC described in the published literature, 12 
(3.4%) were women. These 2 cases add to the existing literature on this topic.

Cardiovascular risk, atherosclerosis and metabolic syndrome after liver 
transplantation: a mini review.

Liver transplantation is the standard of care for acute and chronic end-stage 
liver disease. Advances in medical therapy and surgical techniques have 
transformed the long-term survival of liver-transplant (LT) recipients. The 
prevalence of post-transplant cardiovascular complications has been rising with 
increased life expectancy after liver transplantation. Currently, deaths related 
to cardiovascular complications are one of the main causes of long-term 
mortality in LT recipients, as cardiovascular disease is the reason of 19-42% of 
non-liver-related mortality after transplant. On the other hand, metabolic 
syndrome is common among LT recipients before and after transplantation. In 
fact, their components (abdominal obesity, diabetes mellitus, hypertension and 
dyslipidemia) are often exacerbated by transplant-specific factors, such as 
immunosuppression, inappropriate diet, smoking and a sedentary lifestyle, and 
add a significant risk of developing atherosclerosis. These aspects are 
discussed in this article.

Albumin as a versatile platform for drug half-life extension.

Sleep D(1), Cameron J, Evans LR.

Author information:

dsee@novozymes.com.

BACKGROUND: Albumin is the most abundant plasma protein, is highly soluble, very 
stable and has an extraordinarily long circulatory half-life as a direct result 
of its size and interaction with the FcRn mediated recycling pathway. In 
contrast, many therapeutic molecules are smaller than the renal filtration 
threshold and are rapidly lost from the circulation thereby limiting their 
therapeutic potential. Albumin can be used in a variety of ways to increase the 
circulatory half-life of such molecules.
SCOPE OF REVIEW: This article will review the mechanisms which underpin 
albumin's extraordinarily long circulatory half-life and how the understanding 
of these processes are currently being employed to extend the circulatory 
half-life of drugs which can be engineered to bind to albumin, or are conjugated 
to, or genetically fused to, albumin.
MAJOR CONCLUSIONS: The recent and growing understanding of the pivotal role of 
FcRn in maintaining the extended circulatory half-life of albumin will 
necessitate a greater and more thorough investigation of suitable pre-clinical 
model systems for assessing the pharmacokinetic profiles of drugs associated, 
conjugated or fused to albumin.
GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: Association, conjugation or fusion of therapeutic drugs to 
albumin is a well-accepted and established half-life extension technology. The 
manipulation of the albumin-FcRn interaction will facilitate the modulation of 
the circulatory half-life of albumin-enabled drugs, leading to superior 
pharmacokinetics tailored to the disease state and increased patient compliance.

Distribution of health-related social surplus in pharmaceuticals: an estimation 
of consumer and producer surplus in the management of high blood lipids and 
COPD.

Refoios Camejo R, McGrath C, Miraldo M, Rutten F.

Erratum in
    Eur J Health Econ. 2014 May;15(4):447. Camejo, Rodrigo Refoios [corrected to 
Refoios Camejo, Rodrigo].

BACKGROUND: Following suggestions that developers should be allowed to capture a 
defined share of the total value generated by their technologies, the amount of 
surplus accruing to the pharmaceutical industry has become an important concept 
when discussing policies to encourage innovation in healthcare.
METHODS: Observational clinical and market data spanning over a period of 20 
years were applied in order to estimate the social surplus generated by 
pharmaceuticals used in the management of high cholesterol and chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The distribution of social surplus between 
consumers and producers was also computed and the dynamics of rent extraction 
examined.
RESULTS: Health-related social surplus increased consistently over time for both 
disease areas, mostly due to the launch of more effective technologies and a 
greater number of patients being treated for the conditions. However, the growth 
rate of social surplus differed for each disease and dissimilar patterns of 
distribution between consumer and producer surplus emerged across the years. For 
lipid-lowering therapies, yearly consumer surplus reaches 85 % of total 
health-related social surplus after the loss of exclusivity of major molecules, 
whilst for COPD it ranges from 54 to 69 %. Average producer surplus is 
approximately 25 % of total health-related social surplus in the lipid-lowering 
market between 1990 and 2010, and 37 % for COPD between 2001 and 2010. The share 
of surplus captured by non-innovative generic producers also varies differently 
across periods for both markets, reaching 11.12 % in the case of lipid-lowering 
therapies but just 1.55 % in the case of COPD.
CONCLUSION: A considerable amount of the value may be recouped by consumers only 
towards the end of the lifecycle. Elements affecting the distribution of social 
surplus vary across disease areas and include the market pricing structure and 
the pattern of clinical effectiveness observed over time. The application of a 
longer-term disease specific perspective may be required when assessing the 
cost-effectiveness of health technologies at launch.
