people in the United States. Despite its high projected prevalence, it is a 
significantly under-estimated phenomena, with estimates ranging from 15 to 25% 
of the current U.S.
POPULATION: The effect of the aging of the population and significant increase 
in life expectancy has combined to catapult dementia into the range of one of 
world's most alarming healthcare problems. Diverse and emerging literature in 
the area of cognitive prevention/intervention for mild cognitive impairment 
(MCI)/early stage dementia will be reviewed. Additionally, future research and 
clinical directions will be explored.

BACKGROUND: Chronic pain is a common, disabling, and costly comorbidity, 
particularly in people living with HIV (PLWH). This study developed and pilot 
tested a pain self-management intervention for chronic pain tailored to PLWH 
called Skills TO Manage Pain (STOMP).
OBJECTIVES: Given the additional resources needed to deliver STOMP in HIV 
clinical settings, an important objective of the pilot study was to assess not 
only STOMP's preliminary efficacy, but also its cost-effectiveness.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND SUBJECTS: The present study draws from a 44-participant, 
2-arm randomized pilot trial of the STOMP intervention vs usual care among PLWH 
and at least moderate chronic pain (Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT02824562). 
Cost-effectiveness is presented as the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
(ICER). Costs were considered from the clinic perspective over a 1-year time 
horizon using real costs from the pilot trial. It was conservatively assumed 
there would be no costs savings. The Standard Gamble (SG) method was used to 
directly measure utilities.
RESULTS: Thirty-six participants met inclusion criteria for the present 
analyses. Mean age was 52 years; 61% were female and 86% were black. The total 
cost of STOMP was $483.83 per person. Using the SG method, the change in QALYs 
was 0.15, corresponding to an ICER of $3,225.
CONCLUSIONS: STOMP's cost/QALY is substantially lower than the $50,000 to 
$100,000/QALY benchmark often used to indicate cost-effectiveness. Although 
based on a pilot trial and, therefore, preliminary, these findings are 
promising, and suggest the importance of cost analyses in future STOMP trials.

cell lung cancer.

AIM: This study presents the cost-utility analysis that was developed to inform 
the NICE health technology assessment of osimertinib vs platinum-based doublet 
chemotherapy (PDC) in patients with EGFR-T790M mutation-positive non-small cell 
lung cancer (NSCLC) who have progressed on epidermal growth factor 
receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI) therapy.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: A partitioned survival model with three health states 
(progression-free, progressed disease, and death) from a UK payer perspective 
and over lifetime (15 years) was developed. Direct costs included disease 
management, treatment-related (acquisition, administration, monitoring, adverse 
events), and T790M testing costs. Efficacy and safety data were taken from 
clinical trials AURA extension and AURA2 for osimertinib and IMPRESS for PDC. An 
adjusted indirect treatment comparison was applied to reduce the potential bias 
in the non-randomized comparison. Parametric functions were utilized to 
extrapolate survival beyond the observed period. Health state utility values 
were calculated from EQ-5D data collected in the trials and valued using UK 
tariffs. Resource use and costs were based on published sources.
RESULTS: Osimertinib was associated with a gain of 1.541 quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs) at an incremental cost of £64,283 vs PDC (incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio [ICER]: £41,705/QALY gained). Scenario analyses showed 
that none of the plausible scenarios produced an ICER above £44,000 per QALY 
gained, and probabilistic sensitivity analyses demonstrated a 63.4% probability 
that osimertinib will be cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of 
£50,000.
LIMITATIONS: The analysis is subject to some level of uncertainty inherent to 
phase 2 single-arm data and the immaturity of the currently available survival 
data for osimertinib.
CONCLUSIONS: Osimertinib may be considered a cost-effective treatment option 
compared with PDC in the second-line setting in patients with EGFR-T790M 
mutation-positive NSCLC from a UK payer perspective. Further data from the 
ongoing AURA clinical trial program will reduce the inherent uncertainty in the 
analysis.

Streptococcus pneumoniae infection is a major global public health concern in 
older adults, especially as life expectancy continues to increase in most 
countries, including India. Recently, a 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine 
(PCV13) with the ability to enhance immunity (immunologic memory) on natural 
exposure or revaccination has been shown to protect against community-acquired 
pneumonia and invasive pneumococcal disease in adults 65 years of age and older. 
An unconjugated 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine has been available 
for decades; however, data on protection against pneumonia are inconsistent. For 
the first time, a multicenter study has been conducted in India to assess the 
safety and immunogenicity of a single dose of PCV13 in adults aged 50 to 
65 years. In this study, PCV13 elicited robust immune responses against all 13 
pneumococcal serotypes as reflected by the magnitude of geometric mean fold 
rises (range, 6.6-102.7) in functional antibody levels from before to 1 month 
after vaccination. No serious adverse events occurred. These clinical trial 
findings support the safety and immunogenicity of PCV13 when administered to 
adults in India and indicate that a single dose of PCV13 has the potential to 
protect against vaccine-type pneumococcal disease in adults aged 50 to 65 years.

BACKGROUND: A recent large United Kingdom (UK) clinical trial demonstrated that 
positron-emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT)-guided administration 
of neck dissection (ND) in patients with advanced head and neck cancer after 
primary chemo-radiotherapy treatment produces similar survival outcomes to 
planned ND (standard care) and is cost-effective over a short-term horizon. 
Further assessment of long-term outcomes is required to inform a robust adoption 
decision. Here we present results of a lifetime cost-effectiveness analysis of 
PET-CT-guided management from a UK secondary care perspective.
METHODS: Initial 6-month cost and health outcomes were derived from trial data; 
subsequent incidence of recurrence and mortality was simulated using a de novo 
Markov model. Health benefit was measured in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) 
and costs reported in 2015 British pounds. Model parameters were derived from 
trial data and published literature. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to 
assess the impact of uncertainty and broader National Health Service (NHS) and 
personal social services (PSS) costs on the results.
RESULTS: PET-CT management produced an average per-person lifetime cost saving 
of £1485 and an additional 0.13 QALYs. At a £20,000 willingness-to-pay per 
additional QALY threshold, there was a 75% probability that PET-CT was 
cost-effective, and the results remained cost-effective over the majority of 
sensitivity analyses. When adopting a broader NHS and PSS perspective, PET-CT 
management produced an average saving of £700 and had an 81% probability of 
being cost-effective.
CONCLUSIONS: This analysis indicates that PET-CT-guided management is 
cost-effective in the long-term and supports the case for wide-scale adoption.

BACKGROUND: The IDEAL framework aims at improving the evidence base of available 
surgical innovations. However, the development of such innovations and 
collection of evidence is costly. Surgical innovation can provide more value for 
money if innovations are evaluated at an early stage, where evaluations can 
inform the decision whether to stop or to further develop an innovation. We 
illustrate how decision modelling can be readily adopted at the earliest stages 
(0-1) of the IDEAL framework, using an innovation in bilateral DIEP flap breast 
reconstruction as an example.
METHODS: We quantified expected costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) of 
the current treatment and compared them with an innovation aimed at reducing 
complications and surgery time. The maximum effect of eliminating all 
complications (headroom analysis) was explored. Moreover, three scenarios with 
varying complications and surgery time reductions were modelled. Furthermore, 
the maximum price of the innovation was estimated in a threshold analysis 
according to its impact and societal willingness to pay.
RESULTS: The headroom analysis showed that when all complications associated 
with the current treatment are prevented, up to €889 per patient is saved. 
Scenario analysis showed cost savings between €256 and €828 per patient. When 
surgery time is reduced by 15 min and complications by 50%, the innovation will 
remain cost-effective at €671 per patient.
CONCLUSION: In a field struggling with cost containment, decision modelling can 
help to separate promising innovations from costly failures at an early stage. 
In this example, decision modelling showed that it seems worthwhile to further 
develop the innovation.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: There is uncertainty regarding the optimal management of 
endoscopically invisible (flat) low-grade dysplasia in ulcerative colitis. Such 
a finding does not currently provide an automatic indication for colectomy; 
however, a recommendation of surveillance instead of surgery is controversial. 
The aim of this study was to determine the clinical and cost-effectiveness of 
colonoscopic surveillance versus colectomy for endoscopically invisible 
low-grade dysplasia of the colon in ulcerative colitis.
METHODS: A Markov model was used to evaluate the costs and health outcomes of 
surveillance and surgery over a 20-year timeframe. Outcomes evaluated were life 
years gained and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Cohorts of patients aged 
25 to 75 were modeled, including estimates from a validated surgical risk 
calculator and considering none, 1, or both of 2 key comorbidities: heart 
failure and obstructive airway disease.
RESULTS: Surveillance is associated with more life years and QALYs compared with 
surgery from age 61 for those with no comorbidities, age 51 for those with 1 
comorbidity and age 25 for those with 2 comorbidities. At the current United 
Kingdom National Institute for Health and Care Excellence threshold of $25,800 
per QALY, ongoing surveillance was cost-effective at age 65 in those without 
comorbidities and at age 60 in those with either 1 or more comorbidities.
CONCLUSIONS: Surveillance can be recommended from age 65 for those with no 
comorbidities; however, in younger patients with typical postsurgical quality of 
life, colectomy may be more effective clinically and more cost-effective. The 
results were sensitive to the colorectal cancer incidence rate in patients under 
surveillance and to quality of life after surgery.

People with serious mental illness have a reduced life expectancy that is partly 
attributable to increased cardiovascular disease. One approach to address this 
is regular physical health monitoring. However, physical health monitoring is 
poorly implemented in everyday clinical practice and there is little evidence to 
suggest that it improves physical health. We argue that greater emphasis should 
be placed on primary prevention strategies such as assertive smoking cessation, 
dietary and exercise interventions and more judicious psychotropic prescribing.

AIM: To compare the cost of carbetocin with that of oxytocin for the prevention 
and management of hemorrhage following cesarean delivery in Ecuador.
MATERIALS & METHODS: We developed a decision tree based cost-effectiveness model 
to compare carbetocin with oxytocin in the prevention of hemorrhage following 
cesarean delivery in Ecuador. Our model was run from a third party payer 
perspective and was validated by local experts in the field. The efficacy of the 
interventions was determined based on a systematic review of the literature. 
Direct costs were calculated based on current National Health Service price 
lists and retail price. Since the period covered by the analysis was 1 year, 
costs and health effects were not discounted.
RESULTS: The difference in costs between the interventions was US$16.26, with a 
difference in effectiveness of 0.0067 disability adjusted life years averted. 
The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for carbetocin compared with oxytocin 
for prevention of hemorrhage following cesarean delivery was US$2432.89 per 
disability adjusted life year averted.
CONCLUSION: Carbetocin is as efficacious and safe as oxytocin for primary 
prevention of hemorrhage in cesarean delivery in Ecuador. It is highly cost 
effective for reducing the need for additional uterotonic drugs in both 
emergency and elective cesarean delivery.

Individuals are heterogeneous in many ways. Some of these differences are 
incorporated as individual states (e.g. age, size, breeding status) in 
population models. However, substantial amounts of heterogeneity may remain 
unaccounted for, due to unmeasurable genetic, maternal or environmental factors. 
Such unobserved heterogeneity (UH) affects the behaviour of heterogeneous 
cohorts via intra-cohort selection and contributes to inter-individual variance 
in demographic outcomes such as longevity and lifetime reproduction. Variance is 
also produced by individual stochasticity, due to random events in the life 
cycle of wild organisms, yet no study thus far has attempted to decompose the 
variance in demographic outcomes into contributions from UH and individual 
stochasticity for an animal population in the wild. We developed a 
stage-classified matrix population model for the southern fulmar breeding on Ile 
des Pétrels, Antarctica. We applied multievent, multistate mark-recapture 
methods to estimate a finite mixture model accounting for UH in all vital rates 
and Markov chain methods to calculate demographic outcomes. Finally, we 
partitioned the variance in demographic outcomes into contributions from UH and 
individual stochasticity. We identify three UH groups, differing substantially 
in longevity, lifetime reproductive output, age at first reproduction and in the 
proportion of the life spent in each reproductive state. -14% of individuals at 
fledging have a delayed but high probability of recruitment and extended 
reproductive life span. -67% of individuals are less likely to reach adulthood, 
recruit late and skip breeding often but have the highest adult survival rate. 
-19% of individuals recruit early and attempt to breed often. They are likely to 
raise their offspring successfully, but experience a relatively short life span. 
Unobserved heterogeneity only explains a small fraction of the variances in 
longevity (5.9%), age at first reproduction (3.7%) and lifetime reproduction 
(22%). UH can affect the entire life cycle, including survival, development and 
reproductive rates, with consequences over the lifetime of individuals and 
impacts on cohort dynamics. The respective role of UH vs. individual 
stochasticity varies greatly among demographic outcomes. We discuss the 
implication of our finding for the gradient of life-history strategies observed 
among species and argue that individual differences should be accounted for in 
demographic studies of wild populations.

Nighttime ultraviolet (UV) radiation, if applied properly, has a significant 
potential for management of powdery mildews in many crop species. In this study, 
the role of growth light duration, irradiance, a combination of both (daily 
light integral) and light spectral quality (blue or red) on the efficacy of UV 
treatments against powdery mildew caused by Podosphaera xanthii and the growth 
performance of cucumber plants was studied in growth chambers. Increasing daily 
light integral provided by high-pressure sodium lamps (HPS) decreased efficacy 
of nighttime UV treatments against P. xanthii, but it increased plant growth. 
Furthermore, the efficacy of nighttime UV decreased when day length was 
increased from 16 to 20h at a constant daily light integral. The efficacy of 
nighttime UV increased if red light was applied after UV treatment, showing the 
possibility of day length extension without reducing the effect of UV. 
Increasing the dose of blue light during daytime reduced the efficacy of 
nighttime UV in controlling the disease, whereas blue deficient growth light 
(<6% of blue) caused UV mediated curling of young leaves. Furthermore, 
application of blue light after nighttime UV reduced its disease control 
efficacy. This showed the importance of maintaining a minimum of blue light in 
the growth light before nighttime UV treatment. Findings from this study showed 
that optimization of nighttime UV for management of powdery mildew is dependent 
on the spectral composition of the photosynthetically active radiation.

BACKGROUND: Lumbosacral and coccygeal skin covered appendages are a rare 
malformation, considered human-tails.
CASE REPORT: The authors describe the case of a full term newborn girl with 
lumbar skin appendage and a normal neurologic examination. The magnetic 
resonance of the spine revealed a dermal sinus continuous with the skin 
appendage and with extension into to the spinal canal. Due to the infection 
risk, a surgery was performed on the third day of life, with dermal sinus 
ligation and appendage removal. At 12 months of follow-up the girl has a normal 
neurologic examination.
CONCLUSIONS: With the description of this case the authors aim to emphasize that 
although rare, lumbar skin appendages can be associated with spinal dysraphism 
and other lesions, requiring extensive work-up and long-term surveillance.

BACKGROUND: Acute carotid stent thrombosis in patients undergoing CAS is a 
relatively rare and potentially devastating complication influencing 
significantly the quality of life. With the increasing use of stenting in 
clinical practice, it is expected to represent a more often encountered 
complication for physicians performing CAS. Emergent removal of the thrombosed 
stent and endarterectomy is indicated when the intrastent thrombosis is not 
associated with intracranial carotid branch thrombosis.
METHODS: The technique and its peculiarities and tip and tricks of this carotid 
operation have not been described meticulously. We describe the steps of the 
surgical technique in detail, and we analyze crucial issues associated with the 
technique.
RESULTS: We have performed this emergency operation in 2 patients with acute 
early stroke after CAS. Both patients presented recovery of their previous 
neurologic deficits and had uneventful postoperative course.
CONCLUSIONS: We illustrate the technique of emergent removal of the thrombosed 
stent after CAS. If carotid stent thrombosis with no distal extension is 
documented post procedurally, emergency stent removal and endarterectomy is the 
preferred strategy. Special care should be taken to avoid risk of clot 
dislocation and consequent cerebral embolization during the surgical exposure of 
the carotid bifurcation and placement of the vascular clamps.

BACKGROUND: Self-stigma represents a major barrier to recovery in people with 
psychotic disorders but is understudied in early illness stage. Longitudinal 
investigation of prediction for self-stigma is scarce and none is conducted in 
early psychosis. We aimed to prospectively examine baseline predictors of 
self-stigma in early psychosis patients in the context of a 3-year follow-up of 
a randomized-controlled trial (RCT) comparing 1-year extension of early 
intervention (EI) with step-down psychiatric care for first-episode psychosis 
(FEP).
METHOD: One hundred sixty Chinese patients were recruited from a specialized EI 
program for FEP in Hong Kong after they had completed this 2-year EI service, 
and underwent a 12-month RCT. Participants were followed up and reassessed 
3years after inclusion to the trial. Comprehensive evaluation encompassing 
clinical, functional, subjective quality of life and treatment-related variables 
were conducted. Data analysis was based on 136 participants who completed 
self-stigma assessment at 3-year follow-up.
RESULTS: Fifty patients (36.8%) had moderate to high levels of self-stigma at 
3-year follow-up. Multivariate regression analysis revealed that female gender, 
prior psychiatric hospitalization, longer duration of untreated psychosis and 
greater positive symptom severity at study intake independently predicted 
self-stigma at the end of 3-year study period.
CONCLUSION: Our results of more than one-third of early psychosis patients 
experienced significant self-stigma underscore the clinical needs for early 
identification and intervention of self-stigmatization in the initial years of 
psychotic illness. Further research is warranted to clarify prediction profile 
and longitudinal course of self-stigma in the early illness phase.

AIM: To systematically review studies comparing bystander automated external 
defibrillator (AED) use to no AED use in regard to clinical outcomes in 
out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA), and to provide a descriptive summary of 
studies on the cost-effectiveness of bystander AED use.
METHODS: We searched Medline, Embase, the Web of Science, and the Cochrane 
Library for randomized trials and observational studies published before June 1, 
2017. Meta-analyses were performed for patients with all rhythms, shockable 
rhythms, and non-shockable rhythms.
RESULTS: Forty-four observational studies, 3 randomized trials, and 13 
cost-effectiveness studies were included. Meta-analysis of 6 observational 
studies without critical risk of bias showed that bystander AED use was 
associated with survival to hospital discharge (all rhythms OR: 1.73 [95%CI: 
1.36, 2.18], shockable rhythms OR: 1.66 [95%CI: 1.54, 1.79]) and favorable 
neurological outcome (all rhythms OR: 2.12 [95%CI: 1.36, 3.29], shockable 
rhythms OR: 2.37 [95%CI: 1.58, 3.57]). There was no association between 
bystander AED use and neurological outcome for non-shockable rhythms (OR: 0.76 
[95%CI: 0.10, 5.87]). The Public-Access Defibrillation trial found higher 
survival rates when volunteers were equipped with AEDs. The other trials found 
no survival difference, although their study settings differed. The quality of 
evidence was low for randomized trials and very low for observational studies. 
AEDs were cost-effective in settings with high cardiac arrest incidence, with 
most studies reporting ratios < $100,000 per quality-adjusted life years.
CONCLUSIONS: The evidence supports the association between bystander AED use and 
improved clinical outcomes, although the quality of evidence was low to very 
low.

Mercury (Hg) is a persistent bio-accumulative toxic metal with unique 
physicochemical properties of public health concern since their natural and 
anthropogenic diffusions still induce high risk to human and environmental 
health. The goal of this review was to analyze scientific literature evaluating 
the role of global concerns over Hg exposure due to human exposure to ingestion 
of contaminated seafood (methyl-Hg) as well as elemental Hg levels of dental 
amalgam fillings (metallic Hg), vaccines (ethyl-Hg) and contaminated water and 
air (Hg chloride). Mercury has been recognized as a neurotoxicant as well as 
immunotoxic and designated by the World Health Organization as one of the ten 
most dangerous chemicals to public health. It has been shown that the half-life 
of inorganic Hg in human brains is several years to several decades. Mercury 
occurs in the environment under different chemical forms as elemental Hg 
(metallic), inorganic and organic Hg. Despite the raising understanding of the 
Hg toxicokinetics, there is still fully justified to further explore the 
emerging theories about its bioavailability and adverse effects in humans. In 
this review, we describe current research and emerging trends in Hg toxicity 
with the purpose of providing up-to-date information for a better understanding 
of the kinetics of this metal, presenting comprehensive knowledge on published 
data analyzing its metabolism, interaction with other metals, distribution, 
internal doses and targets, and reservoir organs.

BACKGROUND: Chronic kidney disease is characterized by stiffening, thinning, 
dilatation, and increased circumferential wall stress of large arteries, 
associated with increased cardiovascular risk. Kidney transplantation (KT) 
reverses many pathological features of chronic kidney disease and improves life 
expectancy; however, longitudinal studies exploring the impact of KT on 
recipient large arteries are scarce.
METHODS AND RESULTS: This study was designed to appraise arterial changes 
following KT. Carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity, carotid remodeling 
(circumferential wall stress and carotid internal diameter), and stiffness were 
measured in 161 consecutive recipients receiving either a living (n=49) or a 
deceased (n=112) donor allograft, at 3 and 12 months after transplantation. Mean 
pulse wave velocity decreased from 10.8 m/s (95% confidence interval, 10.5-11.2 
m/s) (at month 3) to 10.1 m/s (95% confidence interval, 9.8-10.5 m/s) (at month 
12) (P<0.001). After multivariate adjustment, pulse wave velocity reduction from 
month 3 to month 12 was significantly larger in the living donor allograft KT 
(P<0.001). Circumferential wall stress decreased, 70 kPa (95% confidence 
interval, 68-72 kPa) to 64 kPa (95% confidence interval, 62-67 kPa), as well as 
carotid internal diameter and carotid stiffness (P<0.001 for all). Reductions in 
circumferential wall stress, diameter, and stiffness were significantly larger 
in the living donor allograft KT (P<0.001). When deceased donor allograft 
patients were classified into standard and expanded criteria donors, changes in 
both pulse wave velocity and circumferential wall stress were blunted in 
expanded criteria donors. Changes were independent of graft function and blood 
pressure changes.
CONCLUSIONS: Large-artery stiffness and maladaptive carotid artery remodeling of 
chronic kidney disease is partially reversed within 12 months of KT and appears 
unrelated to renal function. Improvements were independently associated with 
live organ donation. Our data suggest that expanded criteria donors may hamper 
vascular recovery.

Knowledge about the natural history of severe alpha 1-antitrypsin (AAT) 
deficiency (PiZZ) is limited. Our aim was to compare the survival of PiZZ 
individuals with randomly selected controls from the Swedish general 
population.The PiZZ subjects (n=1585) were selected from the Swedish National 
AATD Register. The controls (n=5999) were randomly selected from the Swedish 
population register. Smoking habits were known for all subjects.Median follow-up 
times for the PiZZ subjects (731 never-smokers) and controls (3179 
never-smokers) were 12 and 17 years, respectively (p<0.001). During follow-up, 
473 PiZZ subjects (30%), and 747 controls (12%) died. The PiZZ subjects had a 
significantly shorter survival time than the controls, p<0.001. After adjustment 
for gender, age, smoking habits and presence of respiratory symptoms, the risk 
of death was still significantly higher for the PiZZ individuals than for the 
controls, hazard ratio (HR) 3.2 (95% CI 2.8-3.6; p<0.001). By contrast, the risk 
of death was not increased in never-smoking PiZZ individuals identified by 
screening, compared to never-smoking controls, HR 1.2 (95% CI 0.6-2.2).The 
never-smoking PiZZ individuals identified by screening had a similar life 
expectancy to the never-smokers in the Swedish general population. Early 
diagnosis of AAT deficiency is of utmost importance.

Interventions that target biological mechanisms of aging have great potential to 
enhance quality of life by delaying morbidity and mortality. The FDA-approved 
drug rapamycin is a compelling candidate for such an intervention. In a previous 
study, it was reported that 3 months of rapamycin treatment is sufficient to 
increase life expectancy and remodel the gut microbiome in aged mice. Transient 
treatment with rapamycin or a rapamycin derivative has also been shown to delay 
immune stem cell senescence and rejuvenate immune function in aged mice and 
elderly people. Periodontal disease is an important age-related disease 
involving altered immune function, pathological changes to the oral microbiome, 
and systemic inflammation. Periodontal disease is defined clinically by loss of 
alveolar bone and by connective tissue degeneration. Here, we describe 
significant alveolar bone loss during aging in two different mouse strain 
backgrounds and report that rapamycin treatment is sufficient to reverse 
age-associated periodontal disease in mice. Partial restoration of youthful 
levels of alveolar bone is observed in 22-month-old rapamycin-treated mice as 
rapidly as 8 weeks after initiation of treatment. To the best of our knowledge, 
this represents the first intervention shown to substantially prevent or reverse 
age-associated alveolar bone loss. These findings suggest the possibility that 
inhibition of mTOR with rapamycin or other pharmacological agents may be useful 
to treat a clinically relevant condition for which there is currently no 
effective treatment.

INTRODUCTION: The incidence of kidney cancer has increased significantly over 
the past few decades presumably due to the increased use of imaging. The aim of 
this article is to describe contemporary outcomes of ablative therapy and to 
compare them to other therapeutic options in terms of oncological, functional, 
perioperative outcomes and cost.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: We searched MEDLINE®, Embase®, using (MeSH) words; from 
January 2005 through May 2017, and we looked for all the studies. Investigators 
graded the strength of evidence in terms of methodology, language and relevance.
RESULTS: Ninety-one articles were analyzed. We described the outcomes of 
ablative therapy in relation to the energy used and the approach, and compared 
these outcomes to the other therapeutic options in terms of oncological, 
functional and perioperative outcomes. We analyzed these studies in order to 
search for predictive factors influencing the results of ablative therapy. We 
also analyzed the economic burden of small renal tumor management.
CONCLUSION: The strength of evidence is based almost entirely on retrospective 
studies and is susceptible to the inherent limitations of this study design. 
Although, the evidence was low among studies, our revue showed that, in elderly 
patients treated with ablative therapy for cT1a tumors, the cancer-specific 
survival was comparable to partial nephrectomy with differences in overall 
survival that are explained by competing risks of death in the old population. 
Considering the functional results, the renal function preservation seems to be 
comparable between the 2 groups while the perioperative morbidity is higher in 
the partial nephrectomy group. The evidence base medicine at this time cannot 
support the extension of the indications of ablative therapy beyond the actual 
implementations.
