within 2 months from hospital admission was assessed through a telephonic 
interview with the caregiver for each patient discharged alive. Inhospital 
mortality was also recorded. Survival was calculated from date of admission to 
our unit.
RESULTS: Mean prealbumin at admission was 17.3±7.7 mg/dl, while hs-CRP median 
was 24.2 mg/L (IQR 8.7 to 51.8). 108 patients (27%) died within two months from 
admission. In an age- and sex-adjusted analysis, log(hs-CRP) levels at 
admission, but not prealbumin, were independently associated with an increased 
risk for mortality (HR 1.40, 95% CI 1.18 to 1.66, p<0.001). After multiple 
adjustments for covariates, including comorbidity burden measured through 
Charlson score, log(hs-CRP) remained significantly associated with mortality (HR 
1.38, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.76, p=0.01). A Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) 
curve was performed to test the predictive value of hs-CRP at admission on 
two-month mortality (AUC 0.68, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.72, p<0.001). Cut-off value was 
set at 38.4 mg/L. After dichotomization of hs-CRP values according to this 
cut-off, hs-CRP≥38.4 mg/L at admission proved to be a significant risk factor 
for mortality (HR 2.10, 95% CI 1.23 to 3.58, p=0.006).
CONCLUSION: Serum hs-CRP, but not prealbumin, values at admission are predictors 
of short-term mortality at hospital admission in elderly multimorbid patients. 
Inflammation seems to affect prognosis more than malnutrition in this setting 
and may therefore guide clinicians' attitude towards therapeutic choices.

IMPORTANCE: Although cancer remains the most common cause of disease-related 
death in adolescents and young adults (AYAs) in high-income countries, their 
overall survival rates continue to increase and now exceed 80% at 5 years in 
several high-income countries. This has been accomplished through progressive 
improvements in active treatment and supportive care, although accrual rates to 
therapeutic clinical trials remain disappointing. Recognition of the unique 
distribution of diseases in the AYA population with cancer and further 
understanding of the distinctive biology of cancers in AYAs will lead to 
continuing gains in clinical outcomes.
OBSERVATIONS: Many of the challenges faced by AYAs with a diagnosis of malignant 
disease are shared by others with chronic medical conditions and even their 
healthy peers, such as a sense of invulnerability that may contribute to delays 
in diagnosis. A particular need for psychological support has been identified 
for AYAs with cancer, even after active therapy has been completed and 
especially in the context of palliative care. Notable needs also include 
fertility preservation and navigation through the multiple transitions in the 
cancer journey. Additionally, there is a "cost of cure." This is not only in the 
form of short-term, treatment-related morbidity and mortality but also in the 
burden of "late effects," including second cancers, that compromise quality of 
life and limit life expectancy. Establishing clinical programs devoted to AYAs 
with cancer, with complementary educational initiatives, will strengthen the 
advances made. It is anticipated that clinical trial accrual will increase 
substantially, providing further gains in survival. Likewise, addressing the 
challenges of survivorship, including secondary prevention of long-term 
morbidity and mortality, will lead to additional improvements in clinical 
outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Transferring this knowledge to the care of an 
estimated 1 million incident cases of cancer in AYAs worldwide, most of whom do 
not live in high-income countries, remains a considerable challenge.

BACKGROUND: Frequent start movements occurred during the day, yielding high 
upper-extremity stress. The high incidence and impact of shoulder injury on 
daily life wheelchair use made it clinically relevant to investigate whether 
power-assisted propulsion is beneficial during the start.
METHODS: Eleven hand-rim wheelchair users performed a start-movement in an 
instrumented wheelchair on a flat surface. Test order was randomly assigned to 
propulsion with and without power-assist. For each subject, parameters were 
averaged over 3 repeated starts. For statistical analysis Wilcoxon Signed Rank 
test was used.
FINDINGS: Intensity of mechanical shoulder loading decreased during 
power-assisted propulsion for anterior (147.0 (44.8) versus 121.9 (27.4) N; 
effect size (r)=-.75), posterior (4.8 (14.1) versus 2.7 (11.6) N; r=-.64) and 
inferior directed forces (82.6 (27.9) versus 68.9 (22.6) N; r=-.78) and 
abduction (20.2 (14.6) versus 12.9 (7.8) Nm; r=-.88) and extension moments (20.3 
(10.7) versus 13.7 (9.1 Nm; r=-.88). Peak resultant force at the rim 
significantly decreased from 133.5 (38.4) N to 112.2 (25.4) N (r=-.64) and was 
accompanied by significant decreased shoulder abduction (35.3 (6.7) versus 33.3 
(6.8); r=-.67) and significant increased shoulder extension (13.6 (16.3) versus 
20.3 (19.1); r=-.78) during power-assisted start-up.
INTERPRETATION: Power-assist hand-rim wheelchairs are effective in reducing 
external shoulder load and partly effective in reducing force generation in 
extremes of shoulder motion during start-up. The use of power-assist wheels 
might reduce the risk of developing shoulder overuse injuries.

BACKGROUND: Long-term weight loss maintenance is difficult to achieve. 
Effectiveness of obesity interventions could be increased by providing extended 
treatment, and by focusing on person-environment interactions. Ecological 
Momentary Intervention (EMI) can account for these two factors by allowing an 
indefinite extension of a treatment protocol in everyday life. EMI relies on 
observations in daily life to intervene by providing appropriate in-the-moment 
treatment. The Think Slim intervention is an EMI based on the principles of 
cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), and its effectiveness will be investigated 
in the current study.
METHODS: A randomised controlled trial (RCT) will be conducted. At least 134 
overweight adults (body mass index (BMI) above 25 kg/m(2)) will be randomly 
assigned to an 8-week immediate intervention group (Diet + Think Slim 
intervention, n = 67) or to an 8-week diet-only control group (followed by the 
Think Slim intervention, n = 67). The Think Slim intervention consists of (1) an 
app-based EMI that estimates and intervenes when people are likely to overeat, 
based on Ecological Momentary Assessment data, and (2) ten online computerised 
CBT sessions which work in conjunction with an EMI module in the app. The 
primary outcome is BMI. Secondary outcomes include (1) scores on self-report 
questionnaires for dysfunctional thinking, eating styles, eating disorder 
pathology, general psychological symptomatology, and self-esteem, and (2) eating 
patterns, investigated via network analysis. Primary and secondary outcomes will 
be obtained at pre- and post-intervention measurements, and at 3- and 12-month 
follow-up measurements.
DISCUSSION: This is the first EMI aimed at treating obesity via a cognitive 
approach, provided via a smartphone app and the Internet, in the context of an 
RCT.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial has been registered at the Netherlands Trial 
Register, part of the Dutch Cochrane Centre ( NTR5473 ; registration date: 26 
October 2015).

BACKGROUND: The rapid lengthening of life expectancy has raised the problem of 
providing social programs to counteract the age-related cognitive decline in a 
growing number of older people. Physical activity stands among the most 
promising interventions aimed at brain wellbeing, because of its effective 
neuroprotective action and low social cost. The purpose of this review is to 
describe the neuroprotective role exerted by physical activity in different life 
stages. In particular, we focus on adult neurogenesis, a process which has 
proved being highly responsive to physical exercise and may represent a major 
factor of brain health over the lifespan.
METHODS: The most recent literature related to the subject has been reviewed. 
The text has been divided into three main sections, addressing the effects of 
physical exercise during childhood/ adolescence, adulthood and aging, 
respectively. For each one, the most relevant studies, carried out on both human 
participants and rodent models, have been described.
RESULTS: The data reviewed converge in indicating that physical activity exerts 
a positive effect on brain functioning throughout the lifespan. However, 
uncertainty remains about the magnitude of the effect and its biological 
underpinnings. Cellular and synaptic plasticity provided by adult neurogenesis 
are highly probable mediators, but the mechanism for their action has yet to be 
conclusively established.
CONCLUSION: Despite alternative mechanisms of action are currently debated, 
age-appropriate physical activity programs may constitute a large-scale, 
relatively inexpensive and powerful approach to dampen the individual and social 
impact of age-related cognitive decline.

In patients diagnosed with prostate cancer, the selection of treatment, 
including the type of therapy and its aggressiveness, is often based on a 
patient's age and life expectancy. Life expectancy estimates are too often 
calculated solely on the patient's chronological age, overlooking comorbid 
conditions and their severity, which can greatly affect life expectancy. If, in 
addition to chronological age, comorbid conditions are used to assess a 
patient's life expectancy, the most appropriate treatment options are more 
likely to be selected. Older, healthy patients might be able to tolerate more 
aggressive treatment than would be administered on the basis of their age alone, 
and younger patients with numerous comorbid conditions could avoid harsh therapy 
that might not be appropriate given their current state of health. The key idea 
to consider in treatment selection is what a patient's quality of life would be 
like with or without a particular treatment option. In an era of precision 
medicine, decisions regarding the provision of health care should be made 
rationally and on the basis of objective estimates of the threat of disease and 
the benefits and costs of intervention and within the context of the patient's 
characteristics and desires.

BACKGROUND: Life expectancy has been increasing steadily over the past century 
in most countries, with only a few exceptions such as during wartimes.
DISCUSSION: Marked reversal of life expectancy has been linked to substance use 
and related policies. Three such examples are discussed herein, namely the 
double reversal of life expectancy trends (first to positive, then to negative) 
associated with reducing alcohol supply in the then Union of Soviet Socialist 
Republics (USSR), followed by a rapid increase in availability; the impact of 
the rapid increase of prescription opioids on white non-Hispanics in the US; and 
the systemic impact of the violence accompanying the drug war in Mexico on the 
life expectancy of men. Alcohol policies were crucial to initiate the positive 
reversal in the USSR, and different substance use policies could have avoided 
the negative impacts on life expectancy of the described large groups or 
nations. Substance use policies can be responsible for abrupt negative changes 
in life expectancies. An orientation of such policies towards the goals of 
public health and societal well-being can help avoid such changes.

PURPOSE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of manual therapy according to the 
Utrecht School (MTU) in comparison with physiotherapy (PT) in sub-acute and 
chronic non-specific neck pain patients from a societal perspective.
METHODS: An economic evaluation was conducted alongside a 52-week randomized 
controlled trial, in which 90 patients were randomized to the MTU group and 91 
to the PT group. Clinical outcomes included perceived recovery (yes/no), 
functional status (continuous and yes/no), and quality-adjusted life-years 
(QALYs). Costs were measured from a societal perspective using self-reported 
questionnaires. Missing data were imputed using multiple imputation. To estimate 
statistical uncertainty, bootstrapping techniques were used.
RESULTS: After 52 weeks, there were no significant between-group differences in 
clinical outcomes. During follow-up, intervention costs (β:€-32; 95 %CI: -54 to 
-10) and healthcare costs (β:€-126; 95 %CI: -235 to -32) were significantly 
lower in the MTU group than in the PT group, whereas unpaid productivity costs 
were significantly higher (β:€186; 95 %CI:19-557). Societal costs did not 
significantly differ between groups (β:€-96; 95 %CI:-1975-2022). For QALYs and 
functional status (yes/no), the maximum probability of MTU being cost-effective 
in comparison with PT was low (≤0.54). For perceived recovery (yes/no) and 
functional status (continuous), a large amount of money must be paid per 
additional unit of effect to reach a reasonable probability of 
cost-effectiveness.
CONCLUSIONS: From a societal perspective, MTU was not cost-effective in 
comparison with PT in patients with sub-acute and chronic non-specific neck pain 
for perceived recovery, functional status, and QALYs. As no clear total societal 
cost and effect differences were found between MTU and PT, the decision about 
what intervention to administer, reimburse, and/or implement can be based on the 
preferences of the patient and the decision-maker at hand.

BACKGROUND: Heart failure (HF), especially with preserved ejection fraction 
(HFpEF) is common in older patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM), but often not 
recognized. Early HF detection in older T2DM patients may be worthwhile because 
treatment may be initiated in an early stage, with clear beneficial treatment in 
those with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), but without clear prognostic 
beneficial treatment in those with HFpEF. Because both types of HF may be 
uncovered in older T2DM, screening may improve health outcomes at acceptable 
costs. We assessed the cost-effectiveness of five screening strategies in 
patients with T2DM aged 60 years or over.
METHODS: We built a Markov model with a lifetime horizon based on the prognostic 
results from our screening study of 581 patients with T2DM, extended with 
evidence from literature. Cost-effectiveness was calculated from a Dutch 
healthcare perspective as additional costs (Euros) per additional 
quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. We performed probabilistic sensitivity 
analysis to assess robustness of these outcomes. Scenario analyses were 
performed to assess the influence of the availability of effective treatment of 
heart failure with preserved ejection fraction.
RESULTS: For willingness to pay values in the range of €6050/QALY-€31,000/QALY 
for men and €6300/QALY-€42,000/QALY for women, screening-based checking the 
electronic medical record for patient characteristics and medical history plus 
the assessment of symptoms had the highest probability of being cost-effective. 
For higher willingness-to-pay values, direct echocardiography was the preferred 
screening strategy. Cost-effectiveness of all screening strategies improved with 
the increase in effectiveness of treatment for HFpEF.
CONCLUSIONS: Screening for HF in older community-dwelling patients with T2DM is 
cost-effective at the commonly used willingness-to-pay threshold of €20.000/QALY 
by checking the electronic medical record for patient characteristics and 
medical history plus the assessment of symptoms. The simplicity of such a 
strategy makes it feasible for implementation in existing primary care diabetes 
management programs.

BACKGROUND: Retirement is an important transitional process in later life. 
Despite a large body of research examining the impacts of health on retirement, 
questions still remain regarding the association of retirement age with 
survival. We aimed to examine the association between retirement age and 
mortality among healthy and unhealthy retirees and to investigate whether 
sociodemographic factors modified this association.
METHODS: On the basis of the Health and Retirement Study, 2956 participants who 
were working at baseline (1992) and completely retired during the follow-up 
period from 1992 to 2010 were included. Healthy retirees (n=1934) were defined 
as individuals who self-reported health was not an important reason to retire. 
The association of retirement age with all-cause mortality was analysed using 
the Cox model. Sociodemographic effect modifiers of the relation were examined.
RESULTS: Over the study period, 234 healthy and 262 unhealthy retirees died. 
Among healthy retirees, a 1-year older age at retirement was associated with an 
11% lower risk of all-cause mortality (95% CI 8% to 15%), independent of a wide 
range of sociodemographic, lifestyle and health confounders. Similarly, 
unhealthy retirees (n=1022) had a lower all-cause mortality risk when retiring 
later (HR 0.91, 95% CI 0.88 to 0.94). None of the sociodemographic factors were 
found to modify the association of retirement age with all-cause mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: Early retirement may be a risk factor for mortality and prolonged 
working life may provide survival benefits among US adults.

INTRODUCTION: Despite its low incidence in France, invasive serogroup B 
meningococcal disease remains a public health concern. A new vaccine against the 
disease, Bexsero(®), has been licensed in the EU. We studied the epidemiological 
impact and cost-effectiveness of routine vaccination using Bexsero(®) in order 
to inform the decision-making process regarding its potential inclusion in the 
vaccination schedule.
METHODS: A multi-generational Markov model was used. Time horizon was set to 100 
years. Five vaccination strategies were evaluated: infants at 3, 5, 6 and 13 
months, toddlers at 13, 15 and 27 months and adolescents at 15 years provided 2 
doses one month apart. A booster dose at 15 years old and a catch-up for 15 
years old subjects during the first 15 years of the programme were added to the 
infant and toddler strategies. Costs per QALY gained were computed from a 
restricted societal perspective including direct costs only. Herd immunity was 
simulated in an alternative base-case scenario and sensitivity analyses.
RESULTS: In the base-case analysis without herd immunity and with all cohorts 
vaccinated, at € 40 per vaccine dose, routine infant vaccination would provide 
the lowest cost per QALY gained (€ 380,973) despite only preventing 18% of 
cases. Under the assumption of herd immunity, the adolescent vaccination would 
provide the lowest cost per QALY gained (€ 135,902) preventing 24% of cases. 
Infant vaccination with a late booster and catch-up would prevent 51% of cases 
with a cost of € 188,511 per QALY gained.
CONCLUSIONS: Given current meningococcal epidemiology in France and the 
available data on the protection provided by Bexsero(®), our modelling work 
showed that routine vaccination against serogroup B meningococcal disease is not 
cost-effective.

PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to examine the cost-effectiveness of pain 
treatments in two pain centers in Japan.
METHODS: The study population comprised 91 patients receiving various treatments 
for chronic pain, which were divided into three categories: (1) medication, (2) 
medication + nerve block, and (3) other modalities (exercise and/or pain 
education). Pain was assessed using the Pain Disability Assessment Scale (PDAS) 
score, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) score, Pain Catastrophizing 
Scale (PCS) score, and EQ-5D score. First, the reliability of the EQ-5D score 
first assessed by evaluating the correlation this score with those of the other 
pain-related evaluation instruments, and then the cost effectiveness of the pain 
treatments was evaluated. Evaluation of medical costs was based on data provided 
from the Management Services of the hospital, which in turn were based on 
national health scheme medical treatment fees. The quality-adjusted life year 
(QALY) value was calculated from the EQ-5D score, converted to 12 months, and 
then used for cost-benefit analysis along with medical treatment fees.
RESULTS: According to the recent IASP classification, more patients had chronic 
neuropathic pain (41) than chronic primary pain (37 patients) or chronic 
musculoskeletal pain (27 patients). There was a significant correlation between 
the EQ-5D score and the PDAS, HADS, and PCS scores, which demonstrated the 
reliability of the EQ-5D score. Significant improvement in the HADS, PCS, and 
EQ-5D scores was noted after 3 months of pain treatment. Calculation of the 
cost-effectiveness based on the estimated annual medical treatment cost and QALY 
revealed a mean value of US $45,879 ± 103,155 per QALY (median US $16,903), 
indicating adequate socioeconomic utility.
CONCLUSION: Based on our results, the EQ-5D is reliable for evaluating chronic 
pain in patients. The medico-economic balance was appropriate for all treatments 
provided in two comprehensive pain centers in Japan.

OBJECTIVES: This study assessed the use of intermediate endpoints in the 
economic evaluation of new treatments for advanced cancer and the methodological 
approaches adopted when overall survival (OS) data are unavailable or of limited 
use.
METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted to identify economic 
evaluations of treatments for advanced cancer published between 2003 and 2013. 
Cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses expressed in cost per life-year 
gained and cost per quality-adjusted life-year using an intermediate endpoint as 
an outcome measure were eligible. Characteristics of selected studies were 
extracted and comprised population, treatment of interest, comparator, line of 
treatment, study perspective, and time horizon. Use of intermediate endpoints 
and methods adopted when OS data were lacking were analyzed.
RESULTS: In total, 7219 studies were identified and 100 fulfilled the 
eligibility criteria. Intermediate endpoints mostly used were progression-free 
survival and time to progression, accounting for 92 % of included studies. OS 
data were unavailable for analysis in nearly 25 % of economic evaluations. In 
the absence of OS data, studies most commonly assumed an equal risk of death for 
all treatment groups. Other methods included use of indirect comparison based on 
numerous assumptions, use of a proxy for OS, consultation with clinical experts, 
and use of published external information from different treatment settings.
CONCLUSION: Intermediate endpoints are widely used in the economic evaluation of 
new treatments for advanced cancer in order to estimate OS. Currently, different 
methods are used in the absence of suitable OS data and the choice of an 
appropriate method depends on many factors including the data availability.

Early morbidity and mortality in patients with Marfan syndrome (MFS) -a 
connective tissue disease caused by mutations in fibrillin-1 gene- are mainly 
caused by aorta aneurysm and rupture. However, the increase in the life 
expectancy of MFS patients recently achieved by reparatory surgery promotes 
clinical manifestations in other organs. Although some studies have reported 
respiratory alterations in MFS, our knowledge of how this connective tissue 
disease modifies lung mechanics is scarce. Hence, we assessed whether the 
stiffness of the whole lung and of its extracellular matrix (ECM) is affected in 
a well-characterized MFS mouse model (FBN1C1039G/+). The stiffness of the whole 
lung and of its ECM were measured by conventional mechanical ventilation and 
atomic force microscopy, respectively. We studied 5-week and 9-month old mice, 
whose ages are representative of early and late stages of the disease. At both 
ages, the lungs of MFS mice were significantly more compliant than in wild type 
(WT) mice. By contrast, no significant differences were found in local lung ECM 
stiffness. Moreover, histopathological lung evaluation showed a clear 
emphysematous-like pattern in MFS mice since alveolar space enlargement was 
significantly increased compared with WT mice. These data suggest that the 
mechanism explaining the increased lung compliance in MFS is not a direct 
consequence of reduced ECM stiffness, but an emphysema-like alteration in the 3D 
structural organization of the lung. Since lung alterations in MFS are almost 
fully manifested at an early age, it is suggested that respiratory monitoring 
could provide early biomarkers for diagnosis and/or follow-up of patients with 
the Marfan syndrome.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to retrospectively evaluate the 
effectiveness of a fertility awareness-based method supported by a mobile-based 
application to prevent unwanted pregnancies as a method of natural birth 
control.
METHODS: In a retrospective analysis, the application's efficiency as a 
contraceptive method was examined on data from 4054 women who used the 
application as contraception for a total of 2085 woman-years.
RESULTS: The number of identified unplanned pregnancies was 143 during 2053 
woman-years, giving a Pearl Index of 7.0 for typical use. Ten of the pregnancies 
were due to the application falsely attributing a safe day within the fertile 
window, producing a perfect-use Pearl Index of 0.5. Calculating the cumulative 
pregnancy probability by life-table analysis resulted in a pregnancy rate of 
7.5% per year (95% confidence interval 5.9%, 9.1% per year).
CONCLUSIONS: The application appears to improve the effectiveness of fertility 
awareness-based methods and can be used to prevent pregnancies if couples 
consistently protect themselves on fertile days.

目的：本研究的目的是回顾性评价一个建立在生育意识基础上的移动应用程序作为一种自然的生育控制方法，防止不必要的妊娠的有效性。方法：在回顾性分析中，通过4054名妇女对该应用程序共2085妇女年使用的资料，分析该应用程序作为一种避孕方法的有效性。结果：在2053妇女年的使用中，计划外妊娠是143次，典型使用的珀儿指数是7.0。10次妊娠是由于应用程序错误地认为受孕期是安全期，产生完美的珀儿指数为0.5。通过寿命表分析计算的累积妊娠概率为每年7.5%（95%的置信区间为每年5.9%-9.1%）。结论：应用程序改善以生育意识为基础的避孕方法的有效性，如果夫妻在排卵期坚持保护自己，它可以用来防止妊娠。

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The depletion of the ozone layer allows overexposure of the 
skin to UV radiation, which is prolonged due to the increasing life expectancy, 
together with inappropriate life habits contribute to the increasing incidence 
of cutaneous malignancies. Plant extracts with antioxidant capacities are 
frequently employed as a means to protect skin against ultraviolet (UV) 
radiations, thus preventing skin cancers. In the present study we assessed a red 
grape seed extract (GSE) potential capacities to reduce ultraviolet B (UVB) 
radiation-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) and subsequent apoptosis in a 
human keratinocytes cell line (HaCaT). We identified molecules and pathways 
modulated by the GSE through which this may exert its photoprotective effect.
METHODS: The GSE was standardized according to its polyphenolic content and the 
most important biologically active compounds, such as epigallocatechin and 
epicatechin, catechin hydrate, procyanidin B and gallic acid were evidenced by 
high-performance liquid chromatography. According to the plant extract 
cytotoxicity on the HaCaT cell line, two concentrations were selected for 
testing from the non-toxic range: GSE1 (37.5 μgEqGA/ml) and GSE2 (75 μgEqGA/ml). 
The level of ROS was evaluated with CM-H2DCFDA assay, while apoptosis, Bax-α and 
NF-kβ p65 proteins with ELISA and confirmed by western-blot.
RESULTS: Both concentrations of the extract decreased the level of ROS in 
UVB-irradiated keratinocytes (p<0.001), whereas apoptosis and Bax-α 
pro-apoptotic protein were only reduced by the higher concentration (GSE2). The 
NF-kB p65 protein level registered increasing values in time after UVB exposure 
of the cells, while the tested plant extract re-established its level when its 
smaller concentration was used (GSE1).
CONCLUSION: These results encourage further studies on this extract in order to 
identify other molecules and pathways through which this extract might exert its 
beneficial effects and also recommend its use as a potential photoprotective 
agent.

The considerable increase of the life expectancy of HIV-infected patients in the 
age of highly-powerful antiretroviral treatment results in important metabolic 
and bone-joint changes resulting from a long-lasting viral infection time and 
from this treatment. The most common orthopaedic complications are bone 
mineralization changes, osteonecrosis, carpal tunnel syndrome and gleno-humeral 
adhesive capsulitis, with different clinical presentation features, natural 
disease progression and therapeutic response compared to the overall population. 
Literature reports are initial, and the experience of the multidisciplinary 
service of the University of Sao Paulo's Institute of Orthopaedics and 
Traumatology enables us a more indepth knowledge about the various pathologies 
involved and the development of treatment protocols that are appropriate to 
these diagnoses.

BACKGROUND: The two most commonly used uterotonic drugs in caesarean section are 
oxytocin and carbetocin, a synthetic oxytocin analogue. Carbetocin has a longer 
half-life when compared to oxytocin, resulting in a reduced use of additional 
uterotonics. Oxytocin is known to cause fewer cardiovascular side effects when 
administered as a short-infusion compared to as an intravenous bolus. Based on 
these findings, we aim at comparing carbetocin 100 mcg given as a slow 
intravenous bolus with carbetocin 100 mcg applied as a short-infusion in 100 ml 
0.9 % sodium chloride in women undergoing a planned or unplanned caesarean 
delivery. We hypothesise uterine contraction not to be inferior to a bolus 
application (primary efficacy endpoint) and greater haemodynamic stability to be 
achieved after a short-infusion than after a bolus administration, as measured 
by heart rate and mean arterial blood pressure (primary safety endpoint).
METHODS/DESIGN: This is a prospective, double-blind, randomised controlled, 
investigator-initiated, non-inferiority trial taking place at the University 
Hospital Basel, Switzerland. Uterine tone is quantified by manual palpation by 
the obstetrician using a linear analogue scale from 0 to 100 at 2, 3, 5 and 10 
minutes after cord clamping. We will evaluate whether the lower limit of the 
confidence interval for the difference of the maximal uterine tone within the 
first 5 minutes after cord clamping between both groups does not include the 
pre-specified non-inferiority limit of -10. Both haemodynamic secondary 
endpoints will be analysed using a linear regression model, adjusting for the 
baseline value and the dosage of vasoactive drug given between cord clamping and 
1 minute thereafter, in order to investigate superiority of a short-infusion as 
compared to a bolus application. We will follow the extension of CONSORT 
guidelines for reporting the results of non-inferiority trials.
DISCUSSION: Haemodynamic stability and adequate uterine tone are important 
outcomes in caesarean sections. The results of this trial may be used to 
optimise these factors and thereby increase patient safety due to a reduction in 
cardiovascular side effects.

AIM: The aim of the present study was to investigate the proportion of 
physicians and nurses who agree with the administration of antibiotic therapy 
(AT), artificial hydration (AH), and artificial nutrition (AN) in patients with 
advanced dementia and different life expectancies. Furthermore, we aimed at 
analyzing the correlates of the opinion according to which medical treatments 
should no longer be given to advanced dementia patients once their life 
expectancy falls.
METHODS: End-of-life decisions and opinions were measured with a questionnaire 
that was sent to geriatric units, hospices and nursing homes in three different 
regions of Italy. Multivariate logistic regressions were carried out to 
ascertain the correlates of the agreement with the administration of AH, AT or 
AN.
RESULTS: When the patient's life expectancy was 1-6 months, 83% of respondents 
agreed with AH, 79% with AT and 71% with AN. When the life expectancy was less 
than 1 month, a large proportion of respondents still agreed with AH and AT (73% 
and 61%), whereas less than one in two respondents (48%) agreed with AN.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings of the present study showed that AN creates more 
ethical dilemmas in the clinical management of end of life than other 
treatments, such as AH or AT. Opinions on whether or not these practices are 
appropriate at the end of life were related with feelings, thoughts and ethical 
issues that played a different part for physicians and nurses. Geriatr Gerontol
