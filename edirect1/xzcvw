INTRODUCTION: Due to demographic changes, the annual incidence of femoral neck 
fractures (FNF) in patients reaching the 9th and 10th decade of life is 
increasing. Although active and cognitively intact elderly patients could 
benefit from total hip arthroplasty (THA) in case of a FNF, there is no clear 
consensus on whether THA should be performed in this particular subgroup of 
patients with very advanced age. The purpose of this study was to report the 
complication rate, mortality, clinical outcomes and quality-adjusted life year 
(QALY) gained in patients treated with total THA for FNF, while having exceeded 
the mean life expectancy at the time of surgery, compared to a younger control 
group.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients treated with THA through a direct anterior 
approach (DAA) for FNF and exceeding the average life expectancy in Switzerland 
(age ≥ 83 y, n = 45) were matched for gender, body mass index (BMI) and ASA 
score with patients under the age of 83 (age = 65-83, n = 45). Perioperative 
complications, clinical and radiologic outcomes, as well as mortality were 
compared between groups.
RESULTS: Total complication rate did not differ significantly with 22.2% in the 
older group compared to 17.8% in the control group. The 30-day and 1-year 
mortality was slightly but not significantly higher in the older group (2.2% and 
8.9% vs. 2.2% and 2.2%). The average QALY gained was 3.4 years and 4.1 years for 
the older group and their younger counterparts, respectively.
CONCLUSION: THA through the DAA for FNF in cognitively intact and active 
patients might be a credible and safe option even after reaching mean life 
expectancy with excellent functional outcomes and similar surgery-related 
complications compared to patients younger than 83 years. Our results imply that 
an advanced age should not be considered a contraindication for THA in case of a 
FNF.

Background: The surprise question (SQ), "Would I be surprised if this patient 
died within one year?", is a simple instrument to identify patients with 
palliative care needs. The SQ-performance has not been evaluated in patients 
with advanced cancer visiting the emergency department (ED). Objective: To 
evaluate SQ's test characteristics and predictive value in patients with 
advanced cancer visiting the ED. Design: Observational cohort study. Setting: 
Patients >18 years with advanced cancer in the palliative phase visiting the ED 
of an academic medical center. Methods: Attending physicians answered the SQ 
(not surprised [NS] or surprised [S]) and estimated Eastern Cooperative Oncology 
Group (ECOG)-performance status. Disease, visit, and follow-up characteristics 
were retrospectively collected from charts. SQ's sensitivity, specificity, 
positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV), and 
Harrell's c-index were calculated. Prognostic values of SQ and other variables 
were assessed by using Cox proportional hazards models. Results: 
Two-hundred-and-forty-five patients were included (203 NS [83%] and 42 S [17%]), 
median age 62 years, 48% male. Follow-up on overall survival was updated until 
February 2019. At ED entry, NS-patients had worse ECOG-performance and more 
symptoms. At study closure, 233 patients had died (95%). Median survival was 
three months for NS-patients (interquartile [IQ]-range: 1-8); nine months for 
S-patients (IQ-range: 3-28) (p < 0.0001). SQ-performance for one-year mortality: 
sensitivity 89%, specificity 40%, PPV 85%, NPV 50%, c-index 0.56, and hazard 
ratio 2.1 for approaching death. ECOG 3-4 predicted death in NS-patients; 
addition to the SQ improved c-index (0.65); sensitivity (40%), specificity 
(92%), PPV (95%), and NPV (29%). Conclusions: At the ED, the SQ plus ECOG 3-4 
helps identifying patients with advanced cancer and a limited life expectancy. 
Its use supports initiating appropriate care related to urgency of palliative 
care needs.

BACKGROUND: Ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) is the mainstay of surgical 
treatment for patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) but is associated with an 
increased risk of infertility. We developed a simulation model examining the 
impact of initial surgical procedure on quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and 
fertility end points.
METHODS: A patient-level state transition model was used to analyze outcomes by 
surgical approach strategy for females of childbearing age. Initial surgical 
options included IPAA, rectal-sparing colectomy with end ileostomy (RCEI), and 
ileorectal anastomosis (IRA). The primary outcome examined was QALYs, whereas 
secondary outcomes included UC and fertility-associated end points.
RESULTS: IPAA resulted in higher QALYs for patients aged 20-30 years, as 
compared with RCEI. For patients aged 35 years, RCEI resulted in higher QALYs 
(7.54 RCEI vs 7.53 IPAA) and was associated with a 28% higher rate of 
childbirth, a 14-month decrease in time to childbirth, and a 77% reduction in in 
vitro fertilization utilization. When accounting for the decreased infertility 
risk associated with laparoscopic IPAA, IPAA resulted in higher QALYs (7.57) 
even for patients aged 35 years.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite an increased risk of infertility, our model results suggest 
that IPAA may be the optimal surgical strategy for female UC patients aged 20-30 
years who desire children. For patients aged 35 years, RCEI should additionally 
be considered, as QALYs for RCEI and IPAA were similar. These quantitative data 
can be used by patients and providers to help develop an individualized approach 
to surgical management choice.

OBJECTIVES: To analyze the geographic inequalities in life expectancy (LE) and 
the probability of survival up to 40 and 60 years in Brazil between 1991 and 
2010, to partition the variance of these indicators by including municipalities, 
states, and macroregions in the analysis, and to test the association between 
municipal socio-economic and health services indicators with life expectancy.
STUDY DESIGN: Multilevel analysis.
METHODS: Census data from 1991, 2000, and 2010 were used to calculate the 
outcomes and the socio-economic variables. Municipalities were separated into 
centiles according to their values in each outcome. Absolute and relative 
differences were calculated for each year. Multilevel linear regression models 
were performed, taking into account three levels: regions, states, and 
municipalities. Municipal socio-economic and health services variables were 
included in the model with the 2010 data.
RESULTS: All 5545 Brazilian counties showed improvement in the three indicators, 
but the magnitude varied significantly across the country. The highest gains in 
LE were observed in the North and Northeast regions. The gap in LE between the 
1st and 99th percentile decreased from 19.6 years to 12.2 years. The relative 
difference also fell, from 1.37 to 1.18. Most counties' socio-economic and 
health services indicators were associated with the outcomes and explained 
86.7%, 31.2%, and 32.4% of the variation in LE attributable to regions, states, 
and counties, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The average life expectancy increased between 1991 and 2010. 
Concomitantly, a reduction in geographic disparities was observed. The counties' 
socio-economic and health services variables explained much of the variation of 
the outcomes in 2010.

Radiation therapy represents an important approach in the therapeutic management 
of children and adolescents with malignant tumors and its application with 
modern techniques - including Proton Beam Therapy (PBT) - is of great interest. 
In particular, potential radiation-induced injuries and secondary malignancies - 
also associated to the prolonged life expectancy of patients - are still 
questions of concern that increase the debate on the usefulness of PBT in 
pediatric treatments. This paper presents a literary review of current 
applications of PBT in non-Central Nervous System pediatric tumors (such as 
retinoblastoma, Hodgkin Lymphoma, Wilms tumor, bone and soft tissues sarcomas). 
We specifically reported clinical results achieved with PBT and dosimetric 
comparisons between PBT and the most common photon-therapy techniques. The 
analysis emphasizes that PBT minimizes radiation doses to healthy growing 
organs, suggesting for reduced risks of late side-effects and radiation-induced 
secondary malignancies. Extended follow up and confirms by prospective clinical 
trials should support the effectiveness and long-term tolerance of PBT in the 
considered setting.

Telerehabilitation systems provide some advantages against the classic 
rehabilitation methods. The ability of the shoulders depends on active motion 
range of them to do activities in daily life and to do sports. To evaluate the 
shoulder motions, range of motion (ROM) measurement is a basic method. Clinical 
goniometer and digital goniometer are the most commonly used measurement tools. 
However, these measurement tools have some deficiencies and difficulties. In 
this paper, we consider a Kinect One Sensor (Kinect V2) based measurement system 
for shoulder motions as an alternative method. The aim of this study is to 
examine the reliability and validity analyzes of the proposed shoulder 
measurement system. Three systems were used to evaluate validity of the Kinect 
V2 to measure shoulder motions: Kinect V2 based system, clinical goniometer and 
digital goniometer. One expert physical therapist measured shoulder abduction, 
flexion, external rotation, internal rotation and extension ROM values using a 
clinical goniometer and a digital goniometer in 40 healthy volunteers (22 males, 
18 females, and 19-33 years old). All poses for each shoulder motion were 
captured with the Kinect V2 based system again and the ROM values were 
calculated. These procedures were carried out with all of the volunteer 
participants in three repetitions. In reliability for Kinect V2 based shoulder 
motion measurement system, we used the intraclass correlation coefficients 
(ICC), standard error of the measure (SEM), minimal detectable change (MDC). The 
validity test includes the 95% limits of agreement (LOA) and mean difference 
between the Kinect V2 based system and the both of the goniometer systems for 
measuring shoulder motions. The high ICC values show that the Kinect V2 based 
shoulder motion measurement system has very good intra-rater reliability for 
abduction, flexion, external rotation, internal rotation shoulder poses. For 
extension pose, it has good reliability result according to the ICC value. The 
validity analysis gives good results for all shoulder poses except internal 
rotation between Kinect V2 and clinical/digital goniometer. As a result, Kinect 
V2 based measurement system is a reliable and valid alternative 
telerehabilitation tool for shoulder motions.

Cost-effectiveness Analysis of Periodontal Treatment Among Patients With Type 2 
Diabetes.

OBJECTIVE: Previous randomized trials found that treating periodontitis improved 
glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D), thus lowering the risks 
of developing T2D-related microvascular diseases and cardiovascular disease 
(CVD). Some payers in the U.S. have started covering nonsurgical periodontal 
treatment for those with chronic conditions, such as diabetes. We sought to 
identify the cost-effectiveness of expanding periodontal treatment coverage 
among patients with T2D.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted to 
estimate lifetime costs and health gains using a stochastic microsimulation 
model of oral health conditions, T2D, T2D-related microvascular diseases, and 
CVD of the U.S.
POPULATION: Model parameters were obtained from the nationally representative 
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) (2009-2014) and 
randomized trials of periodontal treatment among patients with T2D.
RESULTS: Expanding periodontal treatment coverage among patients with T2D and 
periodontitis would be expected to avert tooth loss by 34.1% (95% CI -39.9, 
-26.5) and microvascular diseases by 20.5% (95% CI -31.2, -9.1), 17.7% (95% CI 
-32.7, -4.7), and 18.4% (95% CI -34.5, -3.5) for nephropathy, neuropathy, and 
retinopathy, respectively. Providing periodontal treatment to the target 
population would be cost saving from a health care perspective at a total net 
savings of $5,904 (95% CI -6,039, -5,769) with an estimated gain of 0.6 
quality-adjusted life years per capita (95% CI 0.5, 0.6).
CONCLUSIONS: Providing nonsurgical periodontal treatment to patients with T2D 
and periodontitis would be expected to significantly reduce tooth loss and 
T2D-related microvascular diseases via improved glycemic control. Encouraging 
patients with T2D and poor oral health conditions to receive periodontal 
treatment would improve health outcomes and still be cost saving or 
cost-effective.

OBJECTIVE: In children with type 1 diabetes (T1D), severe hypoglycemia (SH) is 
associated with poorer cognition, but the association of SH with cognitive 
function in late life is unknown. Given the increasing life expectancy in people 
with T1D, understanding the role of SH in brain health is crucial.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We examined the association between SH and 
cognitive function in 718 older adults with T1D from the Study of Longevity in 
Diabetes (SOLID). Subjects self-reported recent SH (previous 12 months) and 
lifetime history of SH resulting in inpatient/emergency department utilization. 
Global and domain-specific cognition (language, executive function, episodic 
memory, and simple attention) were assessed. The associations of SH with 
cognitive function and impaired cognition were evaluated via linear and logistic 
regression models, respectively.
RESULTS: Thirty-two percent of participants (mean age 67.2 years) reported 
recent SH and 50% reported lifetime SH. Compared with those with no SH, subjects 
with a recent SH history had significantly lower global cognition scores. 
Domain-specific analyses revealed significantly lower scores on language, 
executive function, and episodic memory with recent SH exposure and 
significantly lower executive function with lifetime SH exposure. Recent SH was 
associated with impaired global cognition (odds ratio [OR] 3.22, 95% CI 1.30, 
7.94) and cognitive impairment on the language domain (OR 3.15, 95% CI 1.19, 
8.29).
CONCLUSIONS: Among older adults with T1D, recent SH and lifetime SH were 
associated with worse cognition. Recent SH was associated with impaired global 
cognition. These findings suggest a deleterious role of SH on the brain health 
of older patients with T1D and highlight the importance of SH prevention.

The effects of gelatin-carboxymethyl cellulose (Gel-CMC) based films containing 
chitin nano fiber (CHNF) and Trachyspermum ammi essential oil (Ajowan), on the 
shelf life extension of the raw beef at refrigerated temperature (4 °C) over a 
12-day period were evaluated. Ajowan essential oil (AJEO) and CHNF were added to 
the films at 0.24, 0.64 and 1% v/v; and 2 and 4 wt%, respectively. The 
microbiological (total viable count, psychrotrophic count, Pseudomonas spp., 
Staphylococcus aureus, lactic acid bacteria, molds and yeasts), the chemical 
(pH, thiobarbituric acid and total volatile basic nitrogen), color and sensory 
properties of the packaged samples were evaluated periodically. Bacteria grew 
the most quickly in the control samples, followed by those wrapped with the 
Gel-CMC films; The lowest microbial counts, the least change in the chemical 
properties and the highest sensory scores after 12 days of storage were obtained 
for the samples wrapped in the films incorporated with 1% AJEO and 4 wt% CHNF.

Multiple causes, apart from genetic inheritance, predispose to the production 
and aggregation of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide and Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
development in the older population. There is currently no therapy or medicine 
to prevent or delay AD progression. One novel strategy against AD might involve 
the use of psychobiotics, probiotic gut bacteria with specific mental health 
benefits. Here, we report the neuronal and behavioral protective effects of the 
probiotic bacterium Bacillus subtilis in a Caenorhabditis elegans AD model. 
Aging and neuronal deterioration constitute important risk factors for AD 
development, and we showed that B. subtilis significantly delayed both 
detrimental processes in the wild-type C. elegans strain N2 compared with N2 
worms colonized by the non-probiotic Escherichia coli OP50 strain. Importantly, 
B. subtilis alleviated the AD-related paralysis phenotype of the transgenic C. 
elegans strains CL2120 and GMC101 that express, in body wall muscle cells, the 
toxic peptides Aβ3-42 and Aβ1-42, respectively. B. subtilis-colonized CL2355 
worms were protected from the behavioral deficits (e.g., poor chemotactic 
response and decreased body bends) produced by pan-neuronal Aβ1-42 expression. 
Notably, B. subtilis restored the lifespan level of C. elegans strains that 
express Aβ to values similar to the life expectancy of the wild-type strain N2 
fed on E. coli OP50 cells. The B. subtilis proficiencies in quorum-sensing 
peptide (i.e., the Competence Sporulation Factor, CSF) synthesis and 
gut-associated biofilm formation (related to the anti-aging effect of the 
probiotic) play a crucial role in the anti-AD effects of B. subtilis. These 
novel results are discussed in the context of how B. subtilis might exert its 
beneficial effects from the gut to the brain of people with or at risk of 
developing AD.

Cognitive dysfunction, one of the major concerns of increased life expectancy, 
is prevalent in patients with metabolic disorders. Added to the inflammation in 
the context of aging (inflammaging), low-grade chronic inflammation 
(metaflammation) accompanies metabolic diseases. Peripheral and central 
inflammation underlie metabolic syndrome - related cognitive dysfunction. The 
gut microbiota is increasingly recognized to be linked to both inflammaging and 
metaflammation in parallel to the pathophysiology of obesity, type 2 diabetes 
and the metabolic syndrome. Microbiota composition, diversity and diverse 
metabolites have been related to different metabolic features and cognitive 
traits. The study of different mouse models has contributed to identify 
characteristic microbiota profiles and shifts in the microbial gene richness in 
association with cognitive function. Diet, exercise and prebiotics, probiotics 
or symbiotics significantly influence cognition and changes in the microbiota. 
Few studies have analyzed the gut microbiota composition in association with 
cognitive function in humans. Impaired attention, mental flexibility and 
executive function have been observed in association with a microbiota ecosystem 
in cross-sectional and longitudinal studies. Nevertheless, the evidence in 
humans is still scarce and not causal relationships may be inferred, so larger 
and long-term studies are required to gain insight into the possible role of 
microbiota in human cognition.

In inflammatory peripheral demyelinating disorders, demyelination represents 
segmental demyelination in which the myelin sheath of a myelinating Schwann cell 
(SC) is completely removed by macrophages or a partial myelin degeneration in 
the paranode occurring due to autoantibodies attacking the node/paranode. For 
the segmental demyelination from living myelin-forming SCs, macrophages 
infiltrate within the endoneurium and insinuate between myelin lamellae and the 
cytoplasm of SCs, and the myelin is then removed via phagocytosis. During the 
macrophage invasion into the SC cytoplasm from the node of Ranvier and 
internodal areas, the attacked SCs do not remain quiescent but 
transdifferentiate into inflammatory demyelinating SCs (iDSCs), which exhibit 
unique demyelination pathologies, such as myelin uncompaction from 
Schmidt-Lanterman incisures with myelin lamellae degeneration. The longitudinal 
extension of this self-myelin clearance process of iDSCs into the nodal region 
is associated with the degeneration of nodal microvilli and paranodal loops, 
which provides a potential locus for macrophage infiltration. In addition to the 
nodal intrusion, macrophages appear to be able to invade fenestrated internodal 
plasma membrane or the degenerated outer mesaxon of iDSC. These SC demyelination 
morphologies indicate that the SC reprogramming to iDSCs may be a prerequisite 
for macrophage-mediated inflammatory demyelination. In contrast, paranodal 
demyelination caused by autoantibodies to nodal/paranodal antigens does not 
result in iDSC-dependent macrophage infiltration and subsequent segmental 
demyelination. In the context of inflammatory demyelination, the novel 
perspective of iDSCs provides an important viewpoint to understand the 
pathophysiology of demyelinating peripheral neuropathies and establish 
diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.

The demand for research in the context of identifying the relationship between 
socioeconomic factors and the medical and demographic indicators of individual 
regions is conditioned by continuing deterioration of the health status of 
population of the subjects of the Russian Federation, which occurs under the 
influence of unfavorable environmental factors. The purpose of research is to 
carry out comprehensive analysis of the medical and demographic indicators of 
population health of the region in 2012-2017, taking into account the influence 
of regional health factors. Materials and methods. The study applied such 
research techniques as the Pearson's correlation analysis with matrix 
construction. The processing was performed using the software Statistica 6.0. To 
test the hypothesis of normal distribution, the Shapiro-Wilk criterion was 
applied. The significance of differences was determined by the Student's 
criterion. The differences were considered statistically significant with 
p<0.05. The study used data of the State statistical Report of the Ministry of 
Health of the Russian Federation in 2012-2017. The results. The study 
established that the Trans-Baikal Krai is characterized by a decrease in 
population size up to 1.9%, a decrease in the birth rate up to 18.5%, a 
significant decrease in natural growth, an average mortality rate and an 
increase in life expectancy by 4.89%. According to the Human Development 
Reports, the Trans-Baikal Krai takes the 76th position among the regions of the 
Russian Federation. The comprehensive assessment of the socio-economic 
conditions of the region allowed to identify the factors with the maximum degree 
of influence on the condition of public health, among which the resource 
characteristics of the regional health system are of significant importance, 
that determines the need for long-term study of the effect of these indicators 
on the level of regional health.

The main causes of aging of the population are decreasing of birth rate, 
increasing of life expectancy, increasing of mortality rate of population of 
able-bodied age. The continuing aging of population results in increasing of 
number of elderly people requiring social and medical care. The role of social 
service institutions is increasing. The purpose of study is to assess activities 
of the division's centers of social services to elderly age and disabled citizen 
in the Russia for 2007-2017. The article presents analysis of the indices of 
functioning of the centers of social support of elderly population and disabled 
persons in the Russian Federation. In 2007-2017 in the conditions of aging of 
population most of the indices of divisions of the centers of social support of 
elderly population and disabled persons decreased except social rehabilitation 
divisions and divisions of social service at home. The methods. The normative 
documents regulating activity of the centers of social services and their 
structural divisions are investigated. The indices of functioning of divisions 
centers of the social support of elderly population and disabled persons such as 
day care, temporary residence, social and rehabilitation services, social 
services at home, specialized social and medical services at home, urgent social 
services in Russia, were analyzed according to the Federal State Statistics 
Service (Rosstat) for period of 11 years. The analytical and statistical methods 
were used. Conclusion. In the Russian Federation, the last decade has been 
characterized by significant increase in the total proportion number of persons 
over working age (from 20,8 to 25,0%). At the same time, decreasing of indices 
of functioning of divisions of temporary residences, day care, specialized 
divisions of social and medical services at home, urgent social services 
divisions, reduction in the number of social workers centers of social services 
to elderly age and disabled citizens was established.

BACKGROUND: Clinical interventions known to reduce the risk of caesarean 
delivery include routine induction of labour at 39 weeks, caseload midwifery and 
chart audit, but they have not been compared for cost-effectiveness.
OBJECTIVE: To assesses the cost-effectiveness of three different interventions 
known to reduce caesarean delivery rates compared to standard care; and conduct 
a budget impact analysis.
METHODS: A Markov microsimulation model was constructed to compare the costs and 
outcomes produced by the different interventions. Costs included all costs to 
the health system, and outcomes were quality-adjusted life years (QALY) gained. 
A budget impact analysis was undertaken using this model to quantify the costs 
(in Australian dollars) over three years for government health system funders.
RESULTS: All interventions, plus standard care, produced similar health outcomes 
(mean of 1.84 QALYs gained over 105 weeks). Caseload midwifery was the lowest 
cost option at $15 587 (95% confidence interval [CI] 15 269, 15 905), followed 
by routine induction of labour ($16 257, 95% CI 15 989, 16 536), and chart audit 
($16 325, 95% CI 15 979, 16 671). All produced lower costs on average than 
standard care ($16 905, 95% CI 16 551, 17 259). Caseload midwifery would produce 
the greatest savings of $172.6 million over three years if implemented for all 
low-risk nulliparous women in Australia.
CONCLUSIONS: Caseload midwifery presents the best value for reducing caesarean 
delivery rates of the options considered. Routine induction of labour at 
39 weeks and chart audit would also reduce costs compared to standard care.

Beta-thalassemias are a group of inherited, autosomal recessive diseases, 
characterized by reduced or absent synthesis of beta-globin chains of the 
hemoglobin tetramer, resulting in variable phenotypes, ranging from clinically 
asymptomatic individuals to severe anemia. Three main forms have been described: 
heterozygotes, homozygotes β+, and homozygotes β°. Beta-thalassemia major 
(β-TM), the most serious form, is characterized by an absent synthesis of globin 
chains that are essential for hemoglobin formation, causing chronic hemolytic 
anemia. Cardiac complications represent a leading cause of mortality in β-TM 
patients, although an important and progressive increase of life expectancy has 
been demonstrated after the introduction of chelating therapies. Iron overload 
is the primary factor of cardiac damage resulting in thalassemic cardiomyopathy, 
in which diastolic dysfunction usually happens before systolic impairment and 
overt heart failure (HF). Although iron-induced cardiomyopathy is slowly 
progressive and it usually takes several decades for clinical and laboratory 
features of cardiac dysfunction to manifest, arrhythmias or sudden death may be 
present without signs of cardiac disease and only if myocardial siderosis is 
present. Careful analysis of electrocardiograms and other diagnostic tools may 
help in early identification of high-risk β-TM patients for arrhythmias and 
sudden cardiac death.

In order to develop a product sustainably, multiple analyses, including 
comprehensive environmental assessment, are required. Solar-assisted production 
of walnut husk methanolic extract (WHME) as a natural antioxidant for biodiesel 
was scrutinized by using the life cycle assessment (LCA) approach. More 
specifically, the environmental sustainability of WHME antioxidant was evaluated 
and compared to that of propyl gallate (PG), the most widely used synthetic 
biodiesel antioxidant, under two scenarios. Additionally, supplementary files 
including the inventory data consisting of raw data as well as elementary flows, 
mid-point, and end-point categories are presented. The analysis of scenarios 
revealed that the use of the natural antioxidant and the avoidance of the 
chemical antioxidant in biodiesel fuel could be regarded as an eco-friendly 
approach substantially enhancing the environmental friendliness of biodiesel in 
particular in terms of human health. Furthermore, given the waste-oriented 
nature of WHME, the scenario involved its application could serve as a promising 
strategy to simultaneously valorize the agro-waste and generate a value-added 
product; a move toward implementing the circular economy approach in the 
biodiesel industry.

A case study of new approaches to address health inequalities: Due North five 
years on.

Johnstone PW(1).

Author information:
(1)Public Health England, UK. Also Visiting Professor, Leeds Beckett University.

INTRODUCTION: When local councils took on responsibility for public health in 
England in 2013, leaders from across the north of England met to consider the 
scale of the challenge. As a result, Public Health England commissioned the Due 
North Report which outlined new approaches in tackling health inequalities. This 
second paper outlines what has been learnt in five years as a case study. This 
includes influencing devolution deals and new elected city mayors, planning for 
economic growth in deprived areas and developing community asset-based 
approaches. The paper outlines a new framework for place-based planning to 
reduce health inequalities.
SOURCES OF DATA: Data was gathered from annual reports from north of England 
directors of public health, Office for National Statistics, Public Health 
England's fingertips database and regional and national publications and 
strategies such as the Northern Powerhouse.
AREAS OF AGREEMENT: Devolution to English cities and councils as 'places' is a 
new opportunity to address local needs and inequalities. Due North has supported 
a new public health narrative which locates health action in the most 
fundamental determinants-how local economies are planned, jobs created and power 
is to be transferred to communities and connects reducing years of premature ill 
health to increased economic productivity. Community asset approaches to empower 
local leaders and entrepreneurs can be effective ways to achieve change.
AREAS OF CONTROVERSY: The north-south divide in health is not closing and may be 
worsening. Different ways of working between local government, health and 
business sectors can inhibit in working together and with communities.
GROWING POINTS: Place-based working with devolved powers can help move away from 
top down and silo working, empower local government and support communities. 
Linking policies on health inequalities to economic planning can address 
upstream determinants such as poverty, homelessness and unsafe environments.
AREAS TIMELY FOR DEVELOPING RESEARCH: More research is needed on; (i) addressing 
inequalities at scale for interventions to influence community-led change and 
prosperity in deprived areas, and (ii) the impact of devolution policy on 
population health particularly for deprived areas and marginalised group.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Commissioning high profile reports like Due North is 
influential in supporting new approaches in reducing inequality of health 
through local government, elected mayors; and working with deprived communities. 
This second paper describes progress and lessons.

Differences in frailty in older men and women.

Gordon EH(1), Hubbard RE(1).

Author information:
(1)Centre for Health Services Research, University of Queensland, Brisbane, QLD.

Frailty describes an individual's vulnerability to adverse health outcomes and 
is a useful construct that assists health professionals to understand the 
heterogeneity of the ageing population. While the pathophysiological pathways 
that lead to frailty are not well defined, an individual's sex appears to be a 
key factor influencing the ageing trajectory. Compared with age-matched men, 
women tend to have poorer health status (ie, they are more frail) but longer 
life expectancy (ie, they are more resilient). It seems likely that a 
combination of biological, behavioural and social factors underpin this 
male-female health-survival paradox. Randomised controlled trial data for 
frailty interventions in older adults are emerging, with multicomponent programs 
incorporating exercise and nutrition-based strategies showing promise. 
Pharmaceutical and other innovative therapeutic strategies for frailty are 
highly anticipated. Sex differences in the effectiveness of frailty 
interventions have not been addressed in the research literature to date. In the 
future, successful interventions may target many (if not all) biopsychosocial 
domains, with careful consideration of issues relevant to each sex.

IMPORTANCE: Hospital transfers among nursing home residents in the United States 
who have been diagnosed with advanced illnesses and have limited life expectancy 
are often burdensome, costly, and of little clinical benefit. National 
initiatives, introduced since 2012, have focused on reducing such 
hospitalizations, but little is known about the consequences of these 
initiatives in this population.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the change in hospital transfer rates among nursing 
home residents with advanced illnesses, such as dementia, congestive heart 
failure (CHF), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), from 2011 to 
2017-before and after the introduction of national initiatives to reduce 
hospitalizations.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this cross-sectional study, nationwide 
Minimum Data Set (MDS) assessments from January 1, 2011, to December 31, 2016 
(with the follow-up for transfer rates until December 31, 2017), were used to 
identify annual inception cohorts of long-stay (>100 days) nursing home 
residents who had recently progressed to the advanced stages of dementia, CHF, 
or COPD. The data were analyzed from October 24, 2018, to October 3, 2019.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The number of hospital transfers (hospitalizations, 
observation stays, and emergency department visits) per person-year alive was 
calculated from the MDS assessment from the date when residents first met the 
criteria for advanced illness up to 12 months afterward using Medicare claims 
from 2011 to 2017. Transfer rates for all causes, potentially avoidable 
conditions (sepsis, pneumonia, dehydration, urinary tract infections, CHF, and 
COPD), and serious bone fractures (pelvis, hip, wrist, ankle, and long bones of 
arms or legs) were investigated. Hospice enrollment and mortality were also 
ascertained.
RESULTS: The proportions of residents in the 2011 and 2016 cohorts who underwent
