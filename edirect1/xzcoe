drug-gene associations; (b) determine the quality of the studies that contain 
this evidence; and (c) discuss the quality of this evidence with respect to the 
level of evidence of the drug-gene associations.
METHODS: The PharmGKB database was used to identify cancer drugs with clinically 
relevant drug-gene associations graded high (1A, 1B) or moderate (2A, 2B). A 
systematic literature review was conducted using these drugs. Ovid MEDLINE and 
Embase databases were searched to identify cost-effectiveness, cost-utility, or 
cost-minimization studies comparing pharmacogenetic testing to an alternative. 
Cost and effect values from every relevant comparison within the studies were 
extracted, and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was either 
extracted or calculated for each comparison. Quality assessment was conducted 
for each study using the Quality of Health Economic Studies (QHES) instrument. 
Qualitative synthesis was used to summarize the data.
RESULTS: The search yielded 2,191 citations, of which 35 studies met the 
inclusion criteria. Pharmacoeconomic studies were available for the following 
drugs from the PharmGKB database: fluoropyrimidine, 6-mercaptopurine, 
irinotecan, carboplatin, cisplatin, erlotinib, gefitinib, cetuximab, 
panitumumab, and trastuzumab. The studies were conducted in Asia, Europe, 
Canada, the United States, and Mexico and reported cost-utility, 
cost-effectiveness, and cost-minimization outcomes. The mean QHES score was 80 
(SD = 22) for the studies of drug-gene pairs with high (1A, 1B) and moderate 
(2A, 2B) levels of evidence (1A = 82, 1B = 93, 2A = 71, and 2B = 74). There was 
variation across studies in terms of reporting. 109 relevant comparisons were 
identified within the studies. Of those that reported cost per life-year or cost 
per quality-adjusted life-year (n = 58 comparisons), pharmacogenetic testing was 
dominant in 21% overall and 42%, 21%, 17%, and 5% of the comparisons in Asia, 
Europe, Canada, and the United States, respectively. Variability was observed in 
the ICER values regardless of geographic region or drug. Pharmacogenetic testing 
was cost saving in 17 of 19 cost-minimization comparisons and was favored most 
frequently when compared with genetically indiscriminate strategies containing 
the drug of interest.
CONCLUSIONS: There was mixed evidence regarding the value of pharmacogenetic 
testing to guide cancer treatment. For future pharmacogenomic-related economic 
studies, we recommend prioritizing clinically relevant drug-gene associations 
and greater adherence to available best practice guidelines for conducting and 
reporting economic evaluation studies.

BACKGROUND: No study has investigated the cost and effectiveness of androgen 
deprivation therapy (ADT) and other curative treatment therapies among the 
Medicare population, and no study has taken into consideration the long-term 
side effects associated with ADT.
OBJECTIVE: To examine if adding ADT was cost-effective when accounting for 
ADT-related long-term side effects in men with prostate cancer.
METHODS: For this cost-utility analysis, we used the Surveillance, Epidemiology, 
and End Results (SEER)-Medicare linked database to estimate and compare patient 
survival, costs from a health payer's perspective, and cost-effectiveness of 3 
treatment modalities for advanced prostate cancer patients, including radiation 
therapy, radiation plus ADT, and active surveillance. We also estimated 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) by assigning appropriate health state 
utility values obtained from the literature for each phase of care and for 
long-term side effects. Propensity score matching was used to control for bias 
and confounding that were inherent to the observational study design.
RESULTS: Adding ADT to radiation therapy increased median patient survival by 
0.71 years. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for radiation plus 
ADT versus radiation alone was $63,049 and $295,995 per mean life-year gained 
for radiation compared with active surveillance, respectively. 
Treatment-associated adverse side effects substantially reduced QALYs gained. 
Compared with radiation only, the incremental cost of radiation plus ADT was 
$127,900 per mean QALY and was nearly 80% cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay 
threshold of $210,000 per QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite ADT-associated costs and long-term side effects, compared 
with radiation alone, radiation plus ADT was cost-effective at $127,900 per 
QALY.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) is one of the main causes of infection-related 
cancer. The bivalent vaccine (2vHPV) (16/18) and quadrivalent (6/11/16/18) HPV 
vaccine (4vHPV) have been included in the Spanish vaccination calendar since 
2007. The new nonavalent HPV vaccine (9vHPV), approved in Europe in 2015, 
includes nine HPV types 6/11/16/18/31/33/45/52/58 and has been available in 
Spain since May 2017. Our study aims to estimate the epidemiological impact and 
the cost-effectiveness of a girls-only and a gender-neutral vaccination program 
with 9vHPV compared to the current vaccination program in Spain. A dynamic 
transmission model simulating the natural history of HPV infections was 
calibrated to the Spanish setting and applied to estimate costs and 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) associated with vaccination strategies using 
a payer perspective and a 100-year time horizon. A girls-only vaccination 
strategy at age 12 years with 9vHPV was found to be a cost-effective strategy 
compared with 4vHPV (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of €7,718 per 
QALY). Compared with girls-only vaccination with 4vHPV, gender-neutral 
vaccination with 9vHPV was associated with further reductions of up to 28.5% in 
the incidence of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 2/3 and 17.1% in the 
incidence of cervical cancer, as well as with a 14.0% reduction in cervical 
cancer mortality. Furthermore, a gender-neutral vaccination program with 9vHPV 
could potentially be cost-effective considering some parameters as head and neck 
protection or discount rates, leading to a reduction in the burden of 
HPV-related diseases in both sexes in the Spanish population.

Objective: The objective of this study was to estimate healthy life expectancies 
in eight low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), using two indicators: 
disability-free life expectancy (DFLE) and dependence-free life expectancy 
(DepFLE). Method: Using the Sullivan method, healthy life expectancy was 
calculated based on the prevalence of dependence and disability from the 10/66 
cohort study, which included 16,990 people aged 65 or above in China, Cuba, 
Dominican Republic, India, Mexico, Peru, Puerto Rico, and Venezuela, and 
country-specific life tables from the World Population Prospects 2017. Results: 
DFLE and DepFLE declined with older age across all sites and were higher in 
women than men. Mexico reported the highest DFLE at age 65 for men (15.4, SE = 
0.5) and women (16.5, SE = 0.4), whereas India had the lowest with (11.5, SE = 
0.3) in men and women (11.7, SE = 0.4). Discussion: Healthy life expectancy 
based on disability and dependency can be a critical indicator for aging 
research and policy planning in LMICs.

The cost-effectiveness of oral contraceptives compared to 'no hormonal 
treatment' for endometriosis-related pain: An economic evaluation.

OBJECTIVE: To develop a preliminary cost-effectiveness model that compares oral 
contraceptives and 'no hormonal treatment' for the treatment of 
endometriosis-related pain.
METHODS: A de novo preliminary state transition (Markov) model was developed. 
The model was informed by systematic literature review and expert opinion. The 
uncertainty around the results was assessed both by deterministic and 
probabilistic sensitivity analyses. The economic evaluation was conducted from 
National Health Service (NHS) England perspective. The main outcome measure was 
incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY), with cost-effectiveness 
plane and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves presented for alternative 
willingness-to-pay thresholds.
RESULTS: Oral contraceptives dominated 'no hormonal treatment' and provided more 
QALYs at a lower cost than 'no hormonal treatment', with a cost-effectiveness 
probability of 98%. A one-way sensitivity analysis excluding general 
practitioner consultations showed that oral contraceptives were still 
cost-effective.
CONCLUSIONS: The analyses showed that oral contraceptives could be an effective 
option for the treatment of endometriosis, as this treatment was shown to 
provide a higher level of QALYs at a lower cost, compared to 'no hormonal 
treatment'. The results are subject to considerable parameter uncertainty as a 
range of assumptions were required as part of the modelling process.

BACKGROUND: Spondyloarthritis (SpA) has a significant impact on patients' 
quality of life due to functional impairments. Generic health instruments like 
the EuroQoL 5-dimension (EQ-5D) is important for the cost-utility analysis of 
health care interventions and calculation of quality-adjusted life years. 
However, the applicability of the EQ-5D health measure in Chinese patients with 
SpA is currently unknown. Hence, the aim of the study is to test the 
psychometric properties and to validate the use of the EQ-5D health measure for 
utility analyses in Chinese patients with SpA.
METHODS: Prospective and consecutive recruitment of 220 Chinese patients with 
SpA was conducted. Demographic data including smoking and drinking habits, 
education level, income, and occupation was collected. Disease-associated data 
including disease duration, the presence of back pain, peripheral arthritis, 
dactylitis, enthesitis, uveitis, psoriasis, and inflammatory bowel disease was 
also recorded. Questionnaires regarding disease activity and functional 
disability (BASDAI, BASFI, BASGI, BASMI, ASDAS, ODI), mental health (HADS 
depression and anxiety), and the EQ-5D scores were recorded. SF-36 scores were 
used to verify the findings. Baseline correlations were performed along with 
test-retest reliability, validity, and internal consistency tests. Specifically, 
the relationship between EQ-5D and disease activity and functional scores was 
studied.
RESULTS: EQ-5D scores achieved acceptable internal consistency and reliability. 
A ceiling effect was observed for all domains of the EQ-5D except for 
pain/discomfort. No floor effect was observed. Significant negative correlations 
were observed between ODI, HADS, BASFI, BASMI, BASDAI, and ASDAS-CRP and with 
EQ-5D. A higher disease activity was well-differentiated by EQ-5D, as with the 
disability and mental health scores.
CONCLUSIONS: The EQ-5D demonstrates satisfactory psychometric properties for 
assessment of SpA patients. It has high utility for demonstrating changes in 
disease activity and disability.

Hepatotropic viruses induced hepatitis progresses much faster and causes more 
liver- related health problems in people co-infected with human immunodeficiency 
virus (HIV). Although treatment with antiretroviral therapy has extended the 
life expectancy of people with HIV, liver disease induced by hepatitis B virus 
(HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) causes significant numbers of non-acquired 
immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related deaths in co-infected patients. In 
recent years, new insights into the mechanisms of accelerated fibrosis and liver 
disease progression in HIV/HCV and HIV/HBV co-infections have been reported. In 
this paper, we review recent studies examining the natural history and 
pathogenesis of liver disease in HIV-HCV/HBV co-infection in the era of direct 
acting antivirals (DAA) and antiretroviral therapy (ART). We also review the 
novel therapeutics for management of HIV/HCV and HIV/HBV co-infected 
individuals.

Lumbar spondylolysis is commonly recognized at a single-level of the lumbar 
spine and frequently affects the L5 pars interarticularis unilaterally or 
bilaterally. Some reports have described multiple-level spondylolysis, most 
cases of which occur at consecutive lumbar segments. We herein present a rare 
case of lumbar spondylolysis involving nonconsecutive multiple-level segments; 
only eight such cases have been reported previously. A 38-year-old man presented 
with a 10-month history of chronic severe low back pain. Lumbar 
flexion-extension radiographs and computed tomography revealed spondylolysis at 
the level of L3 and L5, whereas no spondylolisthesis was present and the 
intervertebral disc spaces were maintained at all levels. Because 6 months of 
conservative management failed and repeated diagnostic blocks confirmed that the 
fracture of the L3 pars interarticularis was generating pain, repair of the 
bilateral L3 pars interarticularis with the smiley face rod method was 
performed. At the last follow-up 1 year after surgery, the patient had resumed 
normal life as a laborer and reported no back pain.

PURPOSE: Reducing discomfort in the intensive care unit (ICU) should have a 
positive effect on long-term outcomes. This study assessed whether a tailored 
multicomponent program for discomfort reduction was effective in reducing 
post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms at 1 year in general ICU 
survivors.
METHODS: This study is a prospective observational comparative effectiveness 
cohort study involving 30 ICUs. It was an extension of the IPREA3 study, a 
cluster-randomized controlled trial designed to assess the efficacy of a 
tailored multicomponent program to reduce discomfort in critically ill patients. 
The program included assessment of ICU-related self-perceived discomforts, 
immediate and monthly feedback to the healthcare team, and site-specific 
tailored interventions. The exposure was the implementation of this program. The 
eligible patients were exposed versus unexposed general adult ICU survivors. The 
prevalence of substantial PTSD symptoms at 1 year was assessed based on the 
Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R).
RESULTS: Of the 1537 ICU survivors included in the study, 475 unexposed patients 
and 344 exposed patients had follow-up data at 1 year: 57 (12.0%) and 21 (6.1%) 
presented with PTSD at 1 year, respectively (p = 0.004). Considering the 
clustering and after adjusting for age, gender, McCabe classification, and 
ICU-related self-perceived overall discomfort score, exposed patients were 
significantly less likely than unexposed patients to have substantial PTSD 
symptoms at 1 year (p = 0.015).
CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of a tailored multicomponent program in the ICU that 
has proved to be effective for reducing self-perceived discomfort in general 
adult ICU survivors also reduced the prevalence of substantial PTSD symptoms at 
1 year.

The use of gastro-resistant risedronate, a convenient dosing regimen for oral 
bisphosphonate therapy, seems a cost-effective strategy compared with weekly 
alendronate, generic risedronate, and no treatment for the treatment of 
postmenopausal women with osteoporosis in France.
INTRODUCTION: Gastro-resistant (GR) risedronate tablets are associated with 
improved persistence compared to common oral bisphosphonates but are slightly 
more expensive. This study assessed its cost-effectiveness compared to weekly 
alendronate and generic risedronate for the treatment of postmenopausal women 
with osteoporosis in France.
METHODS: A previously validated Markov microsimulation model was used to 
estimate the lifetime costs (expressed in €2017) per quality-adjusted life-years 
(QALY) of GR risedronate compared with weekly alendronate, generic risedronate, 
and no treatment. Pooled efficacy data for bisphosphonates derived from a 
previous meta-analysis were used for all treatment options, and persistence data 
(up to 3 years) were obtained from a large Australian longitudinal study. 
Evaluation was done for high-risk women 60-80 years of age, with a bone mineral 
density (BMD) T-score ≤ - 2.5 and/or prevalent vertebral fractures.
RESULTS: In all of the simulated populations, GR risedronate was cost-effective 
compared to alendronate, generic risedronate, and no treatment at a threshold of 
€60,000 per QALY gained. In women with a BMD T-score ≤ - 2.5 and prevalent 
vertebral fractures, the cost per QALY gained of GR risedronate compared to 
alendronate, generic risedronate, and no treatment falls below €20,000 per QALY 
gained. In women aged 75 years and older, GR risedronate was even shown to be 
dominant (more QALYs, less costs) compared to alendronate, generic risedronate, 
and no treatment.
CONCLUSION: This study provides the first economic results about GR risedronate, 
suggesting that it represents a cost-effective strategy compared with weekly 
alendronate and generic risedronate for the treatment of postmenopausal women 
with osteoporosis in France.

BACKGROUND: Considering different dimensions of life, special sex life for 
survivors of breast cancer (BC) is important because their life expectancy has 
increased.
OBJECTIVE: We designed this study to improve the sexual function, satisfaction 
and quality of sexual life.
METHODS: In a randomized controlled clinical trial study, from a total 286 
breast cancer survivors (BCS), 118 women enrolled to the study. After providing 
informed consent, the participants were randomly assigned either to the 
intervention group or to the waitlist control group. The intervention consisted 
of six weekly psychosexual counseling sessions that lasted from 90 to 120 min. 
Data were collected by the demographic and clinical forms, Beck Depression 
Inventory, Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI), Larson Sexual Satisfaction 
Questionnaire and sexual quality of life-female (SQOL-F) questionnaire.
RESULTS: Mean age of patients in control and intervention groups were 43.8 ± 6.6 
and 44.84 ± 6.7, respectively. More than 65% of the patients in the both groups 
were either normal or showed a low level of depression. Sexual function (FSFI) 
scores and sexual quality of life (SQOL-F), showed a significant statistic 
differences after intervention (P < 0.001 in both tools). Sexual satisfaction 
(Larson) has showed improvement in some subclasses, however, change in total 
score was not statistically significant (P = 0.073).
CONCLUSIONS: The psychosexual intervention program was effective in improving 
sexual function and quality of sexual life among BCS. This intervention has 
clinical significance as it provided an opportunity for the women to discuss 
their sexual issues.

The contribution of urbanization to changes in life expectancy in Scotland, 
1861-1910.

During the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, urban populations in Europe 
and North America continued to be afflicted by very high mortality as rapid 
urbanization and industrialization processes got underway. Here we measure the 
effect of population redistribution from (low-mortality) rural to 
(high-mortality) urban areas on changes in Scottish life expectancy at birth 
from 1861 to 1910. Using vital registration data for that period, we apply a new 
decomposition method that decomposes changes in life expectancy into the 
contributions of two main components: (1) changes in mortality; and (2) 
compositional changes in the population. We find that, besides an urban penalty 
(higher mortality in urban areas), an urbanization penalty (negative effect of 
population redistribution to urban areas on survival) existed in Scotland during 
the study period. In the absence of the urbanization penalty, Scottish life 
expectancy at birth could have attained higher values by the beginning of the 
twentieth century.

The aim of the study was to establish the radioprotective activity of citrus 
polymetoxylated flavonoids extract (CPMFE) on the X-irradiated rats. The 
experiments were carried out on white Wistar rats. Animals were irradiated with 
X rays in doses of 5 Gy and 7 Gy. The control group consisted the 
sham-irradiated rats. Part of animals of each group were treated with 
intramusculary injections of CPMFE (dose 30 mg/kg) during 7 days; blood was 
taken from the tail vein (0.5 ml) for detection of lipoperoxides (LOO.) content. 
On the 3rd day after irradiation 3 animals from each group were sacrificed 
(under ether anesthesia) and blood samples were taken for the study of 
antioxidant status. The activity of antioxidant enzymes (catalase (CAT) and 
superoxidedismutase (SOD)) was determined by the spectrophotometric method; the 
content of LOO.in the blood was determined by electron paramagnetic resonance 
(EPR) mrthod. In group of irradiated rats a sharp dose-dependent inactivation of 
blood antioxidant enzymes (SOD, CAT) and intensification of the lipid 
peroxidation were detected. The direct and feedback mechanism in the regulation 
of CAT and SOD activity, ensuring the implementation of antioxidant protection 
in the body was revealed. Under irradiation with 7Gy rapid death of animals (on 
3-d day after irradiation the mortality of animals was 70%, and on the 5th day 
all died) were detected. During irradiation with dose 5 Gy the survival of 
animals increased (on the 8-th day after irradiation - 50% survival rate). CPMFE 
in dose-dependent manner supported the reduce the intensity of lipid 
peroxidation processes - at relatively low doses of radiation (5Gy) during the 
first 3 days the content of LOO.in the blood decreased insignificantly compared 
with indices in untreated animals, whereas with an increase in the dose of 
irradiation (7Gy) a statistically significant antiradical effect of CPMFE (a 
statistically significant decrease in the LOO. content) was detected. Under the 
effect of CPMFE in the blood of rats irradiated with a dose of 5 Gy and 7 Gy, 
the activity of CAT and SOD, not statistically significant tends to increase 
(more significant with a dose of 7 Gy). CPMFE did not affect the cumulative 
survival of animals irradiated with a dose of 5 Gy, but reduced the mortality of 
rats by 20% (on the 3rd day of irradiation), and contributed to an increase in 
the life expectancy of animals by 2 times (up to 7 days) in the case of dose 7 
Gr. Based on the analysis of the research results, it can be assumed that under 
conditions of radiation damage, exogenous antioxidants synergistically with a 
dose-dependently activated endogenous non-enzymatic antioxidant system of the 
body (especially at 7Gy) contribute to the effective suppression of chain 
reactions of peroxidation, reduction of mortality and increase in life 
expectancy of animals.

At the end of compulsory schooling, young adults decide on educational and 
occupational trajectories that impact their subsequent employability, health and 
even life expectancy. To understand the antecedents to these decisions, we 
follow a new approach that considers genetic contributions, which have largely 
been ignored before. Using genomewide polygenic scores (EA3) from the most 
recent genomewide association study of years of education in 1.1 million 
individuals, we tested for genetic influence on early adult decisions in a 
United Kingdom-representative sample of 5,839 at 18 years of age. EA3 
significantly predicted educational trajectories in early adulthood (Nagelkerke 
R2 = 10%), χ2(4) = 571.77, p < .001, indicating that young adults partly adapt 
their aspirations to their genetic propensities-a concept known as 
gene-environment correlation. Compared to attending university, a 1 standard 
deviation increase in EA3 was associated on average with a 51% reduction in the 
odds of pursuing full-time employment (OR = .47; 95% CI [.43, .51]); an 
apprenticeship (OR = .49; 95% CI [.45, .54]); or not going in education, 
employment, or training (OR = .50; 95% CI [.41, .60]). EA3 associations were 
attenuated when controlling for previous academic achievement and family 
socioeconomic status. Overall this research illustrates how DNA-based 
predictions offer novel opportunities for studying the sociodevelopmental 
structures of life outcomes. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights

The increase in life expectancy associated with the increase in chronological 
age and less active people helps in the appearance of chronic and degenerative 
diseases. The encouragement of physical exercises contributes to older people 
abandoning sedentarism and preventing such diseases. Exergame is a promising 
alternative, for making exercise a pleasurable activity.In this study, we 
compared the performance of physically active older people with sedentary older 
people in exergames.Participants were 83 older adults over 65 years of age, of 
both sexes, divided into 2 physically active older people (AG) and sedentary 
older people (CG) groups. The participants performed a task through an exergame 
called "MoviLetrando" that uses the score, number of hits, number of omissions, 
and an average time of hits as an evaluation. A characterization questionnaire 
was applied, with information about sex, age, marital status, economic class, 
self-rated health, time of use of electronic games, a questionnaire on the 
practice of physical activity, and the Brunel Mood Scale.There was a higher 
exergame score in AG than in CG (P = .003), in the number of correct answers 
(P = .012). The number of omissions was lower in AG than in CG (P = .023). The 
mean time of correct answers was lower in AG than in CG (P = .013). The 
regression analysis revealed a significant finding F (3, 82) = 11.06, P < .001 
and showed a prediction ability of 26.9% (r = .269). Three variables remained 
significantly associated with the score: physical activity was marginally 
significant (β = .19, P = .06), age (β = -.403, P < .001), depression 
(β = -.212, P = .028).Physically active older people perform better when 
compared with the sedentary older people. Age, depression, and physical activity 
influence the performance in exergame.

INTRODUCTION: Recurrent ovarian carcinoma has dismal prognosis, but control of 
disease and prolonged survival are possible in some patients. The estimated 
5-year survival is 46% for all stages of ovarian cancer, and only 28% for 
metastasized disease. Notably, the majority of women with ovarian cancer are 
diagnosed with stage III or IV disease with a high recurrence rate. As most 
women with relapsed or metastatic cancer will die of progressive disease, there 
is an urgent need for novel therapeutic strategies. The primary aim of our study 
is to evaluate safety and toxicity of intraperitoneal infusion of ex 
vivo-expanded natural killer cells (NK), generated from CD34+ umbilical cord 
blood (UCB) progenitor cells, with and without a preceding non-myeloablative 
immunosuppressive conditioning regimen in patients suffering from recurrent 
ovarian cancer. The secondary objectives are to compare the in vivo lifespan, 
expansion, and biological activity of intraperitoneally infused NK cell products 
with or without preparative chemotherapy, as well as evaluate effects on disease 
load.
METHODS: In this phase I safety trial, 12 patients who are suffering from 
recurrent ovarian cancer, detected by a significant rise in serum level of 
CA-125 on two successive time points, will be included. Prior to UCB-NK cell 
infusion, a laparoscopy is performed to place a catheter in the peritoneal 
cavity. The first cohort of three patients will receive a single intraperitoneal 
infusion of 1.5-3×10 UCB-NK cells, generated ex vivo from CD34+ hematopoietic 
progenitor cells obtained from an allogeneic UCB unit, without a preparative 
chemotherapy regimen. The second group of three patients will be treated with a 
similar dose of UCB-NK cells following a preparative four days non-myeloablative 
immunosuppressive conditioning regimen with cyclophosphamide and fludarabine 
(Cy/Flu). If no severe toxicity is seen in these 6 patients, an extension cohort 
of 6 patients will be included to answer the secondary objectives.
DISCUSSION: This study investigates the safety of a promising new cellular 
therapy in a group of patients with a poor prognosis. Demonstration of safety 
and in vivo expansion capacity of allogeneic UCB-NK cells in the absence of 
Cy/Flu pretreatment will provide rationale for UCB-NK cell infusion after 
regular second-line chemotherapy.

BACKGROUND: Population screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) in 
65‐year‐old men has been shown to be cost‐effective. A risk group with higher 
prevalence is siblings of patients with an AAA. This health economic model‐based 
study evaluated the potential cost‐effectiveness of targeted AAA screening of 
siblings.
METHODS: A Markov model validated against other screening programmes was used. 
Two methods of identifying siblings were analysed: direct questioning of 
patients with an AAA (method A), and employing a national multigeneration 
register (method B). The prevalence was based on observed ultrasound data on 
AAAs in siblings. Additional parameters were extracted from RCTs, vascular 
registers, literature and ongoing screening. The outcome was cost‐effectiveness, 
probability of cost‐effectiveness at different willingness‐to‐pay (WTP) 
thresholds, reduction in AAA death, quality‐adjusted life‐years (QALYs) gained 
and total costs on a national scale.
RESULTS: Methods A and B were estimated to reduce mortality from AAA, at 
incremental cost‐effectiveness ratios of €7800 (95 per cent c.i. 4627 to 12 982) 
and €7666 (5000 to 13 373) per QALY respectively. The probability of 
cost‐effectiveness was 99 per cent at a WTP of €23 000. The absolute risk 
reduction in AAA deaths was five per 1000 invited. QALYs gained were 27 per 1000 
invited. In a population of ten million, methods A and B were estimated to 
prevent 12 and 17 AAA deaths, among 2418 and 3572 siblings identified annually, 
at total costs of €499 500 and €728 700 respectively.
CONCLUSION: The analysis indicates that aneurysm‐related mortality could be 
decreased cost‐effectively by applying a targeted screening method for siblings 
of patients with an AAA.

Individual response to mTOR inhibition in delaying replicative senescence of 
mesenchymal stromal cells.

BACKGROUND AIMS: Delaying replicative senescence and extending lifespan of human 
mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) may enhance their potential for tissue 
engineering and cell based therapies. Accumulating evidence suggests that 
inhibitors of the mTOR signaling pathway, such as rapamycin, constitute 
promising pharmacological agents to retard senescence and extend stemness 
properties of various progenitor cell types. Here, we investigated whether the 
ability of rapamycin to postpone replicative senescence varies among bone marrow 
MSC samples (BM-MSCs) derived from different healthy donors, and explored the 
molecular mechanisms that drive rapamycin-mediated lifespan increment.
METHODS: BM-MSCs at early passages were serially passaged either in absence or 
continuous presence of rapamycin and the number of cell population doublings 
until growth arrest was measured. The inhibition of mTOR signaling was assessed 
by the phosphorylation status of the downstream target RPS6. The expression 
levels of several senescence and pluripotency markers at early and 
late/senescent passages were analyzed by RT-qPCR, flow cytometry and western 
blot.
RESULTS: We found that the lifespan extension in response to the continuous 
rapamycin treatment was highly variable among samples, but effective in most 
BM-MSCs. Despite all rapamycin-treated cells secreted significantly reduced 
levels of IL6, a major SASP cytokine, and expressed significantly higher levels 
of the pluripotency marker NANOG, the expression patterns of these markers were 
not correlated with the rapamycin-mediated increase in lifespan. Interestingly, 
rapamycin-mediated life-span extension was significantly associated only with 
repression of p16INK4A protein accumulation.
CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our results suggest that some, but not all, BM-MSC 
samples would benefit from using rapamycin to postpone replicative arrest and 
reinforce a critical role of p16INK4A protein downregulation in this process.

Purpose: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the disparities in burden of 
disease of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in terms of 
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). Method: This is an international, 
database observational study. The DALYs due to AMD were retrieved from the 2015 
Global Burden of Disease study. The human development index (HDI) and gross 
domestic product (GDP) per capita across countries were obtained from the 2016 
Human Development Report and the World Bank. Other related data were obtained 
from the World Health Organization and United Nations. Results: A total of 195 
countries were included in this study. From 1990 to 2015, the AMD-related global 
DALY numbers, crude DALY rate, and age-standardized DALY rate increased by 
147.66%, 78.13%, and 19.3%, respectively. Global DALY rates increased with age 
and females had higher DALY numbers and rates than males in each age group (all 
P < 0.01). The age-standardized DALY rate was positively associated with HDI and 
GDP per capita (P < 0.001). An analysis by HDI ordering showed substantial 
socioeconomic inequality, with a concentration index of 0.322 for DALY numbers, 
0.472 for crude DALY rate, and 0.142 for age-standardized DALY rate, 
respectively. The country-wide mean body mass index (BMI), serum cholesterol 
concentration, alcohol consumption, physical inactivity, percent of cell phone 
subscribers, and urbanization rate were also significantly associated with 
age-standardized DALY rate. Four variables (GDP per capita, mean BMI, alcohol 
consumption, and urbanization rate) explained 36.48% of the variation of 
age-standardized DALY rate across countries. Conclusion: The global health 
burden of AMD is constantly increasing, implying more demand for AMD services in 
the coming decades. Older age, female gender, higher socioeconomic development, 
physical inactivity, and urbanization rate were related to higher AMD burden. 
These findings may raise the public concern and awareness of the global impact 
of AMD burden and are valuable for policy planning.
