Renal cell carcinoma accounts for 3% of adult solid malignant tumours. 
Approximately 25% of the patients present with metastatic disease at 
presentation. In the era of immunotherapy (interferon alpha-2b and 
interleukin-2), studies showed significant survival benefit with cytoreductive 
nephrectomy (CRN) followed by interferon alpha-2b than interferon alpha 2-b 
alone. Introduction of targeted therapies (vascular endothelial growth factor 
receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitors, mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors) 
in 2005 generated a great interest in the management of metastatic renal cell 
carcinoma (mRCC) as these drugs exhibited tumour shrinkage in the primary tumour 
as well as in the metastatic site/s. Though there is no level 1 evidence, many 
studies have shown the usefulness of cytoreductive nephrectomy along with 
targeted therapy as against to targeted therapy alone. This review is aimed at 
the rationale behind the cytoreductive nephrectomy in mRCC, the current evidence 
and what is in store for the future. A detailed search on the management of mRCC 
was carried out on MEDLINE, Embase, CANCERLIT and Cochrane Library databases 
using the key words "cytoreductive nephrectomy", "immunotherapy" and "targeted 
therapy" since 1980 till 2015. Original articles, review articles, monograms, 
book chapters on metastatic renal cancer and textbooks on urologic oncology, 
oncology and urology were reviewed. Various international guidelines on this 
issue were also studied. An identical search was performed using the American 
Society of Clinical Oncology Abstract database. Trials in the progress or 
recently completed that were relevant to this paper were identified through 
clinicaltrials.gov. The latest information for new articles ahead of publication 
was last accessed in November 2015. CRN has remained an integral part to the 
management of metastatic renal cell carcinoma mainly for the patients with good 
performance status, life expectancy of more than 12 months and in the absence of 
adverse prognostic factors. It had shown measurable survival benefit in the era 
of immunotherapy (CRN + immunotherapy vs. immunotherapy alone). In the era of 
targeted therapy, many studies have shown significant survival benefit with CRN 
+ targeted therapy. However, there is no clear level 1 evidence to support this. 
The ongoing trials (CARMENA and European Organisation for Research and Treatment 
of Cancer SURTIME) would perhaps guide us in the way in which we should manage 
mRCC disease in the future. Maybe we may find some answers on the issues of the 
effectiveness of targeted therapy, the timing of CRN and sequencing these 
treatment arms once the results of these ongoing and future trials are through.

BACKGROUND: Smoking is known to vary by marital status, but little is known 
about its contribution to marital status differences in longevity. We examined 
the changing contribution of smoking to mortality differences between married 
and never married, divorced or widowed Finnish men and women aged 50 years and 
above in 1971-2010.
DATA AND METHODS: The data sets cover all persons permanently living in Finland 
in the census years 1970, 1975 through 2000 and 2005 with a five-year mortality 
follow-up. Smoking-attributable mortality was estimated using an indirect method 
that uses lung cancer mortality as an indicator for the impact of smoking on 
mortality from all other causes.
RESULTS: Life expectancy differences between the married and the other marital 
status groups increased rapidly over the 40-year study period because of the 
particularly rapid decline in mortality among married individuals. In 1971-1975 
37-48% of life expectancy differences between married and divorced or widowed 
men were attributable to smoking, and this contribution declined to 11-18% by 
2006-2010. Among women, in 1971-1975 up to 16% of life expectancy differences by 
marital status were due to smoking, and the contribution of smoking increased 
over time to 10-29% in 2006-2010.
CONCLUSIONS: In recent decades smoking has left large but decreasing imprints on 
marital status differences in longevity between married and previously married 
men, and small but increasing imprints on these differences among women. Over 
time the contribution of other factors, such as increasing material disadvantage 
or alcohol use, may have increased.

Speckle tracking can detect subclinical myocardial dysfunction in rheumatoid 
arthritis patients.

Benacka O, Benacka J, Blazicek P, Belansky M, Payer J, Killinger Z, Lietava J.

INTRODUCTION: Patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have shorter life 
expectancy and their risk of cardiovascular death is more than 50 % higher than 
the rest of the population. Early myocardial dysfunction in RA patients may be 
detectable sooner using speckle‑tracking echocardiography.
METHOD: Cross-sectional study enrolled 55 patients with RA (mean age 44.1 years) 
without known cardiovascular disease and 31 healthy controls. All subjects 
underwent a standard echocardiographic examination: indexed left ventricular 
mass, left ventricle ejection fraction, isovolumic contraction and relaxation 
times (IVCT and IVRT), mitral valve inflow curve (E/A), septal mitral annular 
motion (e'), and E/e' ratio as well as the speckle tracking assessment of left 
ventricle longitudinal, radial and circular strain and strain rate.
RESULTS: In standard echocardiographic examination RA patients exhibited higher 
indexed left ventricle mass (96.36±20.90 g/m2 vs 95.84±21.86 %, p=0.013), lower 
ejection fraction (64.84±3.87 % vs 67.10±3.87 %, p=0.011) and prolonged IVCT 
(61.51±9.30 ms vs 53.71±8.95 ms, p=0.001). Diastolic dysfunction was 
demonstrated by prolonged IVRT (81.62±9.56 ms vs 74.58±12.02 ms, p=0.007) as 
well as by higher E/e' ratio (8.21±1.76 vs 7.21±1.52, p=0.009). Speckle‑tracking 
method detected lower global longitudinal epicardial strain (-19.51 % vs -21.46 
%, p=0.049). Radial, circular, and transversal strains and strain rates were 
same in both groups. Global longitudinal epicardial strain correlated with IVCT 
and IVRT, disease duration, and markers of myocardial damage NTproBNP.
CONCLUSIONS: Standard echocardiographic assessment of myocardial function is 
examiner- and angle-dependent method with considerable limitations for 
evaluation of minimal subclinical changes. Speckle-tracking echocardiography 
significantly revealed incipient myocardial dysfunction in RA patients without 
overt cardiovascular diseases. This correlates with clinical RA characteristics 
and markers of cardiac damage (Tab. 4, Ref. 48).

[Design and validation of a classification system for assessing the degree of 
disability of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis].

INTRODUCTION: Currently there is no system of classification validated and 
commonly used to allow staging the severity of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Based on the ALSFRS-R, four domains were established 
(bulbar, manual skills, gross motor function and respiratory function). Each 
item had a 0 score if the rate was >= 3 (independence) or 1 if the rate was < 3 
(dependence). The functional classification scale was defined as follows: stage 
1, without a loss of independence on any domain, until stage 5, with loss of 
independence in all four domains. This classification is correlated with the 
need of external support, quality of life with the application of the ALSAQ-40 
scale, muscle strength and survival.
RESULTS: From a total of 244 patients, 14.3% were in stage 1, 23.8% in stage 2, 
21.3% in stage 3, 19.3% in stage 4 and 21.3% in stage 5. Muscle strength and 
quality of life were inversely proportional to the stage of the disease, while 
the need for external aids is directly related to the increase in disease stages 
1 to 5 (p < 0.012). Increased survival of patients was found in stages 1 and 2 
with respect to those in stages 3, 4 and 5 (p = 0.004).
CONCLUSION: The proposed classification system is easy to apply and correlates 
well with the patient's clinical, quality of life, resource requirements and 
survival.

Publisher: TITLE: Diseño y validacion de un sistema de clasificacion para 
evaluar el grado de discapacidad de los pacientes con esclerosis lateral 
amiotrofica.
Introduccion. Actualmente no existe un sistema de clasificacion validado y de 
uso comun para estadificar la gravedad de la esclerosis lateral amiotrofica. 
Pacientes y metodos. Basados en la escala de valoracion funcional para la 
esclerosis lateral amiotrofica revisada, se establecieron cuatro dominios 
(bulbar, destrezas manuales, funcion motora gruesa y funcion respiratoria). A 
cada item se le asigno una puntuacion de 0 si su calificacion era igual o mayor 
de 3 (independencia), o 1 si su calificacion era menor de 3 (dependencia). La 
escala de clasificacion funcional se definio desde el estadio 1 (sin perdida de 
independencia en ningun dominio) hasta el estadio 5 (perdida de independencia en 
los cuatro dominios). Esta clasificacion se correlaciono con la necesidad de 
ayudas externas, la calidad de vida aplicando la escala del cuestionario de 
evaluacion de la esclerosis lateral amiotrofica-40, la fuerza muscular y la 
sobrevida. Resultados. De un total de 244 pacientes, el 14,3% se encontraba en 
estadio 1; el 23,8%, en estadio 2; el 21,3%, en estadio 3; el 19,3%, en estadio 
4; y el 21,3%, en estadio 5. Fuerza muscular y calidad de vida fueron 
inversamente proporcionales a la etapa de la enfermedad. La necesidad de ayudas 
externas se relaciona directamente con el aumento de los estadios de la 
enfermedad de 1 a 5 (p < 0,012). Se encontro una mayor sobrevida de los 
pacientes en los estadios 1 y 2 con respecto a los estadios 3, 4 y 5 (p = 
0,004). Conclusion. El sistema de clasificacion propuesto es de facil aplicacion 
y se correlaciona bien con la clinica del paciente, su calidad de vida, el 
requerimiento de recursos y la sobrevida.

OBJECTIVES: We sought to determine whether disease representation in the 
Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR) reflects disease burden, measured 
by the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study as disability-adjusted life-years 
(DALYs).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two investigators performed independent assessment of ten 
men's health and urologic diseases (MHUDs) in CDSR for systematic review and 
protocol representation, which were compared with percentage of total 2010 DALYs 
for the ten conditions. Data were analyzed for correlation using Spearman rank 
analysis.
RESULTS: Nine of ten MHUDs were represented by at least one CDSR review. There 
was a poor and statistically insignificant positive correlation between CDSR 
representation and disease burden (rho = 0.42, p = 0.23). CDSR representation 
was aligned with disease burden for three conditions, greater than disease 
burden for one condition, and less than disease burden for six conditions.
CONCLUSIONS: These results yield high-quality estimates to inform future 
research prioritization for MHUDs. While prioritization processes are complex 
and multi-faceted, disease burden should be strongly considered. Awareness of 
research priority setting has the potential to minimize research disparities on 
a global scale.

BACKGROUND: In spite of a well-developed welfare system in Sweden, there are 
important health divides between residential areas in Stockholm county, with 
shorter life expectancy in disadvantaged areas. These socioeconomic and health 
divides also affect children. Extra efforts and organized collaboration by 
different authorities are required to meet the greater needs of children growing 
up in these areas.
METHODS/DESIGN: This article reports on the programme logic and evaluation 
design of an extended postnatal home visiting programme in collaboration between 
child health services and social services in the Rinkeby area, Stockholm, 
Sweden, where a large proportion are recent immigrants and more than 50% are 
at-risk of poverty. The intervention consists of five extra home visits when the 
child is aged between 2-15 months, jointly by a child health nurse and a social 
service parental advisor, offered to all parents of first-born children 
attending Rinkeby child health centre. Parents of first-born children attending 
child health centres in neighboring areas serve as controls. The evaluation will 
use a mixed methods approach, including participant observation, in-depth 
interviews, interviews using structured questionnaires, review and analysis of 
child health records and records of health care utilization.
DISCUSSION: The intervention has so far been very positively received by the 
parents (95% participation rate), who seem to perceive that they actually 
benefit from participating, and also from staff in child health services and 
social services who find this approach to be in line with their professional 
intentions. The staff members interviewed also appreciate the inter-professional 
collaboration. The intervention has sparked activities also in other sectors 
(the local library, the open child day care centre) of the local area. The 
timing of the intervention, at the start of the child's life, may be well suited 
to support parents in reorienting themselves and finding a positive parenting 
role, to the benefit of the development of the child. The intervention may be 
seen as a concrete example of "proportionate universalism", as a strategy to 
reduce inequalities in health - applying a universal intervention with increased 
intensity in groups that have a greater need for it.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study was retrospectively registered (11 August 2016) in 
the ISRCTN registry ( ISRCTN11832097 DOI: 10.1186/ISRCTN11832097 ).

Netherlands.

OBJECTIVES: The relationship between health care expenditures and health care 
outcomes, such as life expectancy and mortality, is complex. Research outcomes 
show different and contradictory results on this relationship. How and why 
health care expenditures affect health outcomes is not clear. A causal link 
between the two is not proven. Without such knowledge, effects of 
increase/decrease in health care expenses on health outcomes may be 
overestimated/underestimated. This study analyzes the relationship between life 
expectancy at birth and expenditures on health care, taking into account 
expenditures of social production and education, as well as the quantity and 
quality of health care provisions and lifestyles.
DESIGN: This is a cross-sectional study, analyzing national data of 31 European 
countries. First, the bivariate correlation between the dependent variable and 
independent variables are calculated and described. Next a forward linear 
regression analysis is applied.
MEASUREMENT: The data are derived from standardized, comparative data bases as 
available in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and 
Eurostat. Health care expenditures are assessed as a percentage of the Gross 
Domestic Product (GDP).
RESULTS: Health care expenditures are not the main determinant of life 
expectancy at birth, but social protection expenditures are. The regression 
analysis shows that in countries that spend a high percentage of their GDP on 
social protection, that have fewer curative beds and low infant mortality, whose 
citizens report fewer unmet health care needs and drink less alcohol, citizens 
have a significant longer life expectancy.
CONCLUSION: To realize high life expectancy of citizens, policy measures have to 
be directed on investment in social protection expenditures, on improving 
quality of care, and on promoting a healthy life style.

Public health programs to reduce the significant burden of skin cancer have been 
implemented in Australia and around the world. The economic rationale for 
prevention needs to be kept up-to-date as relevant disease patterns, risk 
factors and expenditure patterns change through time. The aim of this study was 
to update and extend the economic credentials for skin cancer prevention in 
Australia. Economic evaluations were conducted in 2015 with multiple methods 
applied, including cost-effectiveness and cost-benefit analysis, multiple study 
perspectives ('societal', 'health sector', '3rd party funder') and 
counterfactual analysis sourced from cancer incidence between 1982 and 2011. 
Modelled outcomes included 'cases prevented', 'deaths averted' and 
'health-adjusted life-years'. Cost-benefit Analysis, including productivity 
impacts in the general economy, was conducted. With an additional $AUD 0.16 
($USD 0.12) per capita investment into future skin cancer prevention across 
Australia, 140,000 skin cancer cases would be prevented over the 20year 
reference period (2011 to 2030). Depending on study perspective and method, the 
upgraded program is either dominant (achieving both health gains and cost 
offsets) or highly cost-effective (health gain at modest net cost). Return on 
investment (ROI) was $AUD 3.20 per dollar invested, with net social benefit of 
$AUD 1.43 billion. The study confirmed the strong economic credentials for skin 
cancer prevention and provided sound arguments for increased investment in 
Australia. The reference case analysis provides a useful benchmark for other 
countries to consider in the design and funding of their prevention programs.

Plume Reach, Trapping Radius, and Absolute Density of Cydia pomonella 
(Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) in Michigan Apple.

Novel methods of data analysis were used to interpret codling moth (Cydia 
pomonella) catch data from central-trap, multiple-release experiments using a 
standard codlemone-baited monitoring trap in commercial apple orchards not under 
mating disruption. The main objectives were to determine consistency and 
reliability for measures of: 1) the trapping radius, composed of the trap's 
behaviorally effective plume reach and the maximum dispersive distance of a 
responder population; and 2) the proportion of the population present in the 
trapping area that is caught. Two moth release designs were used: 1) moth 
releases at regular intervals in the four cardinal directions, and 2) evenly 
distributed moth releases across entire approximately 18-ha orchard blocks using 
both high and low codling moth populations. For both release designs, at high 
populations, the mean proportion catch was 0.01, and for the even release of low 
populations, that value was approximately 0.02. Mean maximum dispersive distance 
for released codling moth males was approximately 260 m. Behaviorally effective 
plume reach for the standard codling moth trap was < 5 m, and total trapping 
area for a single trap was approximately 21 ha. These estimates were consistent 
across three growing seasons and are supported by extraordinarily high 
replication for this type of field experiment. Knowing the trapping area and 
mean proportion caught, catch number per single monitoring trap can be 
translated into absolute pest density using the equation: males per trapping 
area = catch per trapping area/proportion caught. Thus, catches of 1, 3, 10, and 
30 codling moth males per trap translate to approximately 5, 14, 48, and 143 
males/ha, respectively, and reflect equal densities of females, because the 
codling moth sex ratio is 1:1. Combined with life-table data on codling moth 
fecundity and mortality, along with data on crop yield per trapping area, this 
fundamental knowledge of how to interpret catch numbers will enable pest 
managers to make considerably more precise projections of damage and therefore 
more precise and reliable decisions on whether insecticide applications are 
justified. The principles and methods established here for estimating absolute 
codling moth density may be broadly applicable to pests generally and thereby 
could set a new standard for integrated pest management decisions based on 
trapping.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of 
anti-oncostatin M (OSM) IgG1 monoclonal antibodies, CNTO 1119 and its Fc variant 
(CNTO 8212), which incorporates the LS(Xtend) mutation to extend terminal 
half-life (T1/2 ), after a single intravenous (IV) or subcutaneous (SC) 
administration in cynomolgus monkeys, and to predict human PK. In study 1, 
single doses of CNTO 1119 and CNTO 8212 were administered IV or SC at 3 mg/kg to 
cynomolgus monkeys (n = 3 per group). In study 2, single doses of CNTO 8212 were 
administered IV at 1, 5 or 20 mg/kg, or SC at 5 mg/kg to cynomolgus monkeys (n = 
5 per group). Serial blood samples were collected for assessment of serum 
concentrations of CNTO 1119 and/or CNTO 8212. A two-compartment population PK 
model with first-order elimination was utilized to simultaneously describe the 
serum concentrations of CNTO 1119 and CNTO 8212 over time after IV and SC 
administration in cynomolgus monkeys. The typical population PK parameter 
estimates for CNTO 1119 in cynomolgus monkeys were clearance (CL) = 2.81 
mL/day/kg, volume of distribution of central compartment (V1 ) = 31.3 mL/kg, 
volume of distribution of peripheral compartment (V2 ) = 23.3 mL/kg, absolute 
bioavailability (F) = 0.84 and T1/2 = 13.4 days. In comparison, the typical 
population PK parameter estimates for CNTO 8212 in cynomolgus monkeys were CL = 
1.41 mL/day/kg, V1 = 39.8 mL/kg, V2 = 32.6 mL/kg, F = 0.75 and T1/2 = 35.7 days. 
The mean CL of CNTO 8212 was ~50% lower compared with that for CNTO 1119 in 
cynomolgus monkeys. The overall volume of distribution (V1 +V2 ) for CNTO 8212 
was about 32% larger compared with that for CNTO 1119, but generally similar to 
the vascular volume in cynomolgus monkeys. The T1/2 of CNTO 8212 was 
significantly (p < 0.05) longer by about 2.7-fold than that for CNTO 1119 in 
cynomolgus monkeys. Thus, the modification of the Fc portion of an anti-OSM IgG1 
mAb for higher FcRn binding affinity resulted in lower systemic clearance and a 
longer terminal half-life in cynomolgus monkeys. CNTO 8212 demonstrated linear 
PK after a single IV dose (1-20 mg/kg) in cynomolgus monkeys. The predicted 
human PK parameters suggest that CNTO 8212 is likely to exhibit slow clearance 
and long terminal half-life in human beings and may likely allow less frequent 
dosing in the clinical setting.

Many mortality forecasting approaches extrapolate past trends. Their predictions 
of the future development can be quite precise as long as turning points and/or 
age-shifts of mortality decline are not present. To account even for such 
mortality dynamics, we propose a model that combines recently developed ideas in 
a single framework. It (1) uses rates of mortality improvement to model the 
aging of mortality decline, and it (2) optionally combines the mortality trends 
of multiple countries to catch anticipated turning points. We use 
simulation-based Bayesian inference to estimate and run this model that also 
provides prediction intervals to quantify forecast uncertainty. Validating 
mortality forecasts for British and Danish women from 1991 to 2011 suggest that 
our model can forecast regular and irregular mortality developments and that it 
can perform at least as well as other widely accepted approaches like, for 
instance, the Lee-Carter model or the UN Bayesian approach. Moreover, 
prospective mortality forecasts from 2012 to 2050 suggest gradual increases for 
British and Danish life expectancy at birth.

We investigate the role of physician agency in determining health care supply 
and patient outcomes. We show that an increase in health care supply due to a 
change in private physician incentives has a theoretically ambiguous impact on 
patient welfare. The increase can reflect either induced demand for ineffective 
care or a reduction in prior rationing of effective care. Furthermore, physician 
market structure matters in determining the welfare effects of changes in 
private physician incentives. We then analyze a change to Medicare fees that 
caused physicians to increase their provision of chemotherapy. We find that this 
increase in treatment improved patient survival, extending median life 
expectancy for lung cancer patients by about 18%. Consistent with the model, we 
find that while the treatment response was larger in less concentrated markets, 
survival improvements were larger in more concentrated markets.

BACKGROUND: Our aim was to review the selection and methods used for deriving 
health state utility (HSU) estimates included in the cost-utility analyses (CUA) 
submitted by manufacturers to the National Authority for Health (HAS) during the 
first 2 years after the introduction of the economic evaluation for price 
setting in France.
METHODS: We reviewed all manufacturers' submissions that included a CUA and were 
assessed by HAS by the end of October 2015 (N = 34). We reviewed the 
identification, selection, and methods used to estimate HSU and compared them 
with those recommended by HAS.
RESULTS: A literature review to identify HSU was reported in only 13 (38%) 
submissions. The instruments for describing HSU were a preference-based generic 
instrument in 20 (59%) submissions; vignettes in five (15%); a 
condition-specific instrument in three (9%); and a combination of instruments in 
six (18%). The valuation perspective was the general population in 26 (76%) 
submissions; in only nine (26%) submissions, the valuation set was derived from 
the French general population.
CONCLUSIONS: We identified numerous concerns in the selection, valuation and use 
of HSU, as well as a frequent lack of clarity in the methods used. Most 
submissions (79%) included HSU that did not meet HAS recommendations.

American visceral leishmaniasis is a zoonosis caused by Leishmania infantum and 
transmitted mainly by Lutzomyia longipalpis. However, canine cases have been 
reported in the absence of this species in the Greater São Paulo region, where 
Pintomyia fischeri and Migonemyia migonei are the predominant species. This 
raises the suspicion that they could be acting as vectors. Therefore, this study 
sought to investigate specific vector capacity parameters of these species and 
to compare them with those of Lu. longipalpis s.l. Among these parameters the 
blood feeding rate, the survival, and the susceptibility to the development of 
Le. infantum were evaluated for the three species, and the attractiveness of 
dogs to Pi. fischeri and Mg. migonei was evaluated. The estimated interval 
between blood meals was shorter for Lu. longipalpis s.l, followed by Pi. 
fischeri and Mg. migonei. The infection rate with Le. infantum flagellates in 
Lu. longipalpis was 9.8%, in Pi. fischeri 4.8%, and in Mg. migonei nil. The 
respective infective life expectancies (days) of Lu. longipalpis, Mg. migonei, 
and Pi. fischeri were 2.4, 1.94, and 1.68. Both Pi. fischeri and Mg. migonei 
were captured in the kennel with a predominance (95%) of Pi. fischeri. 
Considering the great attractiveness of dogs to Pi. fischeri, its susceptibility 
to infection by Le. infantum, infective life expectancies, and predominance in 
Greater São Paulo, this study presents evidence of Pi. fischeri as a potential 
vector of this parasite in the region.

La leishmaniose viscérale américaine est une zoonose causée par Leishmania 
infantum et transmise principalement par Lutzomyia longipalpis. Cependant, des 
cas canins ont été rapportés dans la région de São Paulo en l’absence de cette 
espèce, avec Pintomyia fischeri et Migonemyia migonei comme espèces 
prédominantes, ce qui suggère qu’elles pourraient agir comme vecteurs. Par 
conséquent, cette étude a cherché à étudier certains paramètres de capacité 
vectorielle de ces espèces et de les comparer avec ceux de Lu. Longipalpis s.l. 
Parmi ces paramètres, le taux d’alimentation sanguin, la survie et la 
susceptibilité au développement de Le. infantum ont été évalués pour les trois 
espèces, et l’attrait des chiens a été évalué pour Pi. fischeri et Mg. migonei. 
L’intervalle estimé entre les repas sanguins était plus court pour Lu. 
longipalpis s.l., suivi par Pi. fischeri et Mg. migonei. Le taux d’infection par 
des formes flagellées de Le. infantum était de 9.8 % chez Lu. longipalpis, 4.8 % 
chez Pi. fischeri, et néant chez Mg. migonei. Les espérances de vie infectieuses 
respectives de Lu. longipalpis, Mg. migonei et Pi. fischeri étaient 2.4, 1.94 et 
1.68 jours. Les deux espèces Pi. fischeri et Mg. migonei ont été capturées dans 
les chenils avec une prédominance (95 %) pour Pi. fischeri. Considérant la 
grande attractivité des chiens pour Pi. fischeri, sa susceptibilité à 
l’infection par Le. infantum, son espérance de vie infectieuse et sa 
prédominance dans le Grand São Paulo, cette étude suggère que Pi. fischeri est 
vecteur potentiel de ce parasite dans cette région.

Muscle Strength, But Not Muscle Oxidative Capacity, Varies Between the Morning 
and the Afternoon in Patients with Multiple Sclerosis: A Pilot Study.

Despite frequent muscle strength or muscle oxidative capacity (based on 
exercise-onset oxygen uptake [VO2] kinetics) assessments in patients with 
multiple sclerosis, the impact of time of day on these parameters is often not 
taken into account. Based on observations in healthy subjects, it remains to be 
studied whether muscle strength, and/or exercise-onset VO2 kinetics, varies 
between the morning and the afternoon in patients with multiple sclerosis. In 
this prospective observational pilot study, walking capacity, exercise-onset VO2 
kinetics, isometric knee extension/flexion strength (dynamometry), and 
self-reported fatigue were measured in 11 patients with multiple sclerosis (age, 
51.8 ± 9.3 yrs; body mass index, 24.7 ± 5.1 kg/m; Expanded Disability Status 
Scale, 3.5 ± 1.4; 3 men) in the morning and 5 hrs later (afternoon). In the 
afternoon, self-reported fatigue (1.9 ± 0.9 cm) and muscle strength (knee 
extension peak torque at 45 degrees, 84 ± 26 Nm) were significantly different (P 
< 0.05), than in the morning (self-reported fatigue, 1.2 ± 0.9 cm; knee 
extension peak torque at 45 degrees, 93 ± 32 Nm), but walking capacity and 
exercise-onset VO2 kinetics were similar at these two time points (P > 0.05). 
Consistent with observations in healthy subjects, muscle strength varies between 
the morning and the afternoon in patients with multiple sclerosis, under the 
conditions of the present study. These findings suggest that muscle strength 
assessments should be conducted at similar or nearly similar times of the day to 
minimize diurnal variation in these measures and hence insure correct 
interpretation.

Technological University , Singapore, Singapore .

BACKGROUND: Hospice care is most appropriate when a patient no longer benefits 
from curative treatment and has limited life expectancy. These patients may 
suffer from any type of life-limiting illness, including end-stage cancer, 
end-stage heart disease, end-stage renal failure, AIDS, and Alzheimer's disease, 
among other illnesses. Patients are managed on their pain and symptoms and home 
hospice care manages these patients in the comfort of their own home, enabling 
patients to spend their last days with dignity and have a good quality of life.
OBJECTIVE: To describe the home hospice patients at HCA Hospice Care (HHC) 
Singapore from 2000 to 2010. Description of home care patients in terms of their 
sociodemographic profile and diagnosis at admission. We reviewed the Electronic 
Medical Records of patients admitted into HHC from 2000 to 2010.
RESULTS: Patients had multiple admissions into HHC home hospice as identified in 
the Electronic Medical Records (EMR) between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 
2010, but we only selected patient's first admission into HHC home hospice for 
this analysis. Of the 25,065 patients in the entire samples, 47.3% were males, 
65.2% were married, and 84.3% were Chinese. 50.9% of the patients died at home, 
75.5% were referred from public hospitals, 53.9% of primary caregivers were 
children, and the mean age of the patients was 68.0 years. Among all cancer 
patients admitted into HHC home hospice, lung cancer (23.6%) was the most common 
principal diagnosis for admission, followed by colorectal (10.5%) and liver 
cancers (7.7%). Among noncancer patients, renal failure (7.0%) was the most 
common diagnosis. Among male patients admitted into HHC home hospice, lung 
cancer (29.6%) was the most common diagnosis, followed by liver cancer (10.8%), 
colorectal cancer (10.0%), and end-stage renal failure (5.5%). For female 
patients, lung cancer (16.9%) was the most common diagnosis, followed by breast 
cancer (15.9%), colorectal cancer (11.0%), and end-stage renal failure (8.7%). 
Ten-year trends of the sociodemographic profile and diagnosis at admission were 
further analyzed to determine home hospice services utilization and the needs of 
the home care patients.
CONCLUSION: With an increasing emphasis to encourage aging and dying in the 
community and more attention given to building up the home hospice industry's 
capacity and capability, it is important to understand the profile of the 
patients who have been utilizing home hospice services. This also helps to plan 
and develop similar services in other parts of the world.

BACKGROUND: Previous studies have shown that exercise training in patients with 
end-stage renal disease could improve their physical functioning and quality of 
life. Nevertheless, few studies have evaluated the effects of Tai Chi exercise 
in patients on hemodialysis.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of a Tai Chi exercise intervention on the 
quality of life and physical functioning in end-stage renal disease patients on 
hemodialysis.
DESIGN: A pre-post experimental design.
SETTING: Patients, aged 20 years or older, on hemodialysis recruited from the 
hemodialysis unit at a medical center in central Taiwan were assigned, based on 
their own preference, to either a control group (n=25) or an intervention group 
(n=21).
INTERVENTION: A weekly one-hour short-form Yang style Tai Chi session for a 
total of 12 weeks.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Physical functioning and Kidney Disease Quality of Life 
(KDQOL) at the baseline and at the end of the intervention.
RESULTS: The least square means of repetition of sit-to-stand cycles in one 
minute (STS-60), 6-min walk test, and gait speed test were significantly 
improved in the intervention group. In addition, the least square means of the 
five different dimensions of the KDQOL were all significantly higher in the 
intervention group, except the SF-12 physical health score.
CONCLUSIONS: Improvements in the kidney disease quality of life and physical 
functioning were observed in Taiwanese patients on hemodialysis with a 12-week 
Tai Chi exercise intervention.

Face Transplant in an Advanced Neurofibromatosis Type 1 Patient.

BACKGROUND The human face is a one-of-a-kind structure with unique morphology, 
complexity, and function, in which different subunits are not even similar to 
other parts of the body. Therefore, extended complex deficits of the face are 
usually difficult to reconstruct, and autologous tissue restoration is generally 
not able to give a satisfactory aesthetic and functional outcome. The main goal 
of face allotransplantation is to restore symmetry, contour, and appearance as 
well as function of the face, especially control of orbicularis oculi and oris 
muscle physiology. We present the case of a total face transplant in an advanced 
neurofibromatosis type 1 patient - the second face transplant in Poland. CASE 
REPORT The recipient was a 28-year-old female with neurofibromatosis type I 
limited to the head region. During 24 years she underwent more than 35 surgical 
procedures, but for the last 3 years a significant decrease of her functionality 
and appearance was observed, including serious problems with speech, eating, and 
vision. In December 2013 she was qualified for a face transplant procedure. When 
the donor was found, she was matched on several clinical and biochemical 
characteristics including negative T and B cell cross-matching. Similarly, the 
transplantation procedure was done using two connected operating rooms; in the 
first, the donor's face was harvested, and in the second, the recipient's face 
was prepared - the tumor mass was resected and vascular and nervous structures 
were prepared. Due to the extension and complexity of the potential defect, more 
than 75% of head soft tissues were harvested including both auriculae, left and 
right eyelids, and scalp down to the occipital lower line. CONCLUSIONS Our case 
showed that neurofibromatosis is a real indication for a face transplantation 
procedure. Also, the results of rehabilitation, quality of life, motor and 
sensory recovery, and physiological status were comparable, showing that face 
transplantation based on careful selection of recipients and procedure planning 
is a real alternative, allowing achievement of excellent results that are far 
away from the outcomes of conventional reconstructions.

BACKGROUND: While many studies have shown associations between obesity and 
increased risk of morbidity and mortality, little comparable information is 
available on how body mass index (BMI) impacts health expectancy. We examined 
associations of BMI with healthy and chronic disease-free life expectancy in 
four European cohort studies.
METHODS: Data were drawn from repeated waves of cohort studies in England, 
Finland, France and Sweden. BMI was categorized into four groups from normal 
weight (18.5-24.9 kg m-2) to obesity class II (⩾35 kg m-2). Health expectancy 
was estimated with two health indicators: sub-optimal self-rated health and 
having a chronic disease (cardiovascular disease, cancer, respiratory disease 
and diabetes). Multistate life table models were used to estimate sex-specific 
healthy life expectancy and chronic disease-free life expectancy from ages 50 to 
75 years for each BMI category.
RESULTS: The proportion of life spent in good perceived health between ages 50 
and 75 progressively decreased with increasing BMI from 81% in normal weight men 
and women to 53% in men and women with class II obesity which corresponds to an 
average 7-year difference in absolute terms. The proportion of life between ages 
50 and 75 years without chronic diseases decreased from 62 and 65% in normal 
weight men and women and to 29 and 36% in men and women with class II obesity, 
respectively. This corresponds to an average 9 more years without chronic 
diseases in normal weight men and 7 more years in normal weight women between 
ages 50 and 75 years compared to class II obese men and women. No consistent 
differences were observed between cohorts.
CONCLUSIONS: Excess BMI is associated with substantially shorter healthy and 
chronic disease-free life expectancy, suggesting that tackling obesity would 
increase years lived in good health in populations.

Role of lipid-lowering agents in the management of diabetic retinopathy.

Diabetic retinopathy affects a substantial proportion of patients with diabetes 
mellitus (DM) and is the leading cause of blindness in working-aged adults. Even 
though the incidence of diabetic retinopathy has declined in the last decades, 
its prevalence increased and is expected to rise further as a result of the 
increasing incidence of type 2 DM (T2DM) and the longer life expectancy of 
patients with DM. The pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy is multifactorial. 
Some observational studies suggested an association between dyslipidemia and the 
development and progression of retinopathy in patients with DM but others did 
not confirm this association. Regarding lipid-lowering agents, studies that 
evaluated the role of statins in the management of these patients are mostly 
small and yielded discrepant results. Large randomized studies with statins in 
patients with T2DM showed no benefit of these agents on diabetic retinopathy but 
were not designed to address this effect. In contrast, both preclinical data and 
two large randomized controlled studies, the FIELD and the ACCORD trial, showed 
that fenofibrate delays the progression of diabetic retinopathy. Even though the 
mechanisms underpinning this favorable effect are not entirely clear, these 
findings suggest that fenofibrate might represent a useful tool for the 
management of diabetic retinopathy.
