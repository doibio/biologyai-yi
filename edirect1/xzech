BACKGROUND: Patients who completed the originating studies, BREEZE-AD1 
(NCT03334396), BREEZE-AD2(NCT03334422), and BREEZE-AD7 (NCT03733301), were 
eligible for enrollment in the multicenter,phase-3, long-term extension study 
BREEZE-AD3 (NCT03334435).
METHODS: At week 52, responders and partial responders to baricitinib 4 mg were 
re-randomized (1:1) into the sub-study to dose continuation (4 mg, N = 84), or 
dose down-titration (2 mg, N = 84). Maintenance of response was assessed from 
week 52 to 104 of BREEZE-AD3. Physician-rated outcomes included vIGA-AD (0,1), 
EASI75, and mean change from baseline in EASI. Patient-reported outcomes 
included DLQI, P OEM total score, HADS, and from baseline: WPAI (presenteeism, 
absenteeism, overall work impairment, daily activity impairment) and change from 
baseline in SCORAD itch and sleep loss.
RESULTS: With continuous treatment with baricitinib 4 mg, efficacy was 
maintained up to week 104 in vIGA-AD (0,1), EASI75, EASI mean change from 
baseline, SCORAD itch, SCORAD sleep loss, DLQI, P OEM, HADS, and WPAI (all 
scores). Patients down-titrated to 2 mg maintained most of their improvements in 
each of these measures.
CONCLUSION: The sub-study of BREEZE AD3 supports flexibility in baricitinib 
dosing regimens. Patients who continued treatment with baricitinib 4 mg and 
down-titrated to 2 mg maintained improvements in skin, itch, sleep, and quality 
of life for up to 104 weeks.

A rich literature shows that early-life conditions shape later-life outcomes, 
including health and migration events. However, analyses of geographic 
disparities in mortality outcomes focus almost exclusively on contemporaneously 
measured geographic place (e.g., state of residence at death), thereby 
potentially conflating the role of early-life conditions, migration patterns, 
and effects of destinations. We employ the newly available Mortality Disparities 
in American Communities data set, which links respondents in the 2008 American 
Community Survey to official death records, and estimate consequential 
differences based on the method of aggregation we use: the unweighted mean 
absolute deviation of the difference in life expectancy at age 50 measured by 
state of birth versus state of residence is 0.58 years for men and 0.40 years 
for women. These differences are also spatially clustered, and we show that 
regional inequality in life expectancy is higher based on life expectancies by 
state of birth, implying that interstate migration mitigates baseline geographic 
inequality in mortality outcomes. Finally, we assess how state-specific features 
of in-migration, out-migration, and nonmigration together shape measures of 
mortality disparities by state (of residence), further demonstrating the 
difficulty of clearly interpreting these widely used measures.

With advances in the treatment of HIV, people living with HIV (PLWH) are now 
expected to have a near-normal life expectancy, but challenges remain in the 
form of substantially poorer health-related quality of life (HRQoL) than the 
general population. Being overweight or obese may pose an additional burden in 
PLWH, but few studies have evaluated the relationship between body mass index 
(BMI) and HRQoL in PLWH. This study aimed to evaluate and describe the 
association between HRQoL and BMI among PLWH in the US. Data were obtained from 
the 2018 and 2019 US National Health and Wellness Survey, an online, 
self-reported, general population survey. Analyses included 575 PLWH who 
self-reported a physician diagnosis and prescription use for the treatment of 
HIV, as well as 1725 propensity score matched non-HIV controls. After adjusting 
for age, sex, race, and comorbidities, higher BMI was associated with poorer 
physical (β =  -0.18, p = 0.005) and general (β =  -0.42, p = 0.014) HRQoL among 
PLWH. Additionally, PLWH reported poorer mental, physical, and general HRQoL 
than non-HIV controls; these relationships were not moderated by BMI. The 
potential negative impact of higher BMI on patients' humanistic outcomes should 
be considered in HIV management, including selection of treatment.

IMPORTANCE: Surveillance after prior colon polyps is the most frequent 
indication for colonoscopy in older adults. However, to our knowledge, the 
current use of surveillance colonoscopy, clinical outcomes, and follow-up 
recommendations in association with life expectancy, factoring in both age and 
comorbidities, have not been studied.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association of estimated life expectancy with 
surveillance colonoscopy findings and follow-up recommendations among older 
adults.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This registry-based cohort study used data 
from the New Hampshire Colonoscopy Registry (NHCR) linked with Medicare claims 
data and included adults in the NHCR who were older than 65 years, underwent 
colonoscopy for surveillance after prior polyps between April 1, 2009, and 
December 31, 2018, and had full Medicare Parts A and B coverage and no Medicare 
managed care plan enrollment in the year prior to colonoscopy. Data were 
analyzed from December 2019 to March 2021.
EXPOSURES: Life expectancy (<5 years, 5 to <10 years, or ≥10 years), estimated 
using a validated prediction model.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The main outcomes were clinical findings of colon 
polyps or colorectal cancer (CRC) and recommendations for future colonoscopy.
RESULTS: Among 9831 adults included in the study, the mean (SD) age was 73.2 
(5.0) years and 5285 (53.8%) were male. A total of 5649 patients (57.5%) had an 
estimated life expectancy of 10 or more years, 3443 (35.0%) of 5 to less than 10 
years, and 739 (7.5%) of less than 5 years. Overall, 791 patients (8.0%) had 
advanced polyps (768 [7.8%]) or CRC (23 [0.2%]). Among the 5281 patients with 
available recommendations (53.7%), 4588 (86.9%) were recommended to return for 
future colonoscopy. Those with longer life expectancy or more advanced clinical 
findings were more likely to be told to return. For example, among patients with 
no polyps or only small hyperplastic polyps, 132 of 227 (58.1%) with life 
expectancy of less than 5 years were told to return for future surveillance 
colonoscopy vs 940 of 1257 (74.8%) with life expectancy of 5 to less than 10 
years and 2163 of 2272 (95.2%) with life expectancy of 10 years or more 
(P < .001).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study, the likelihood of finding 
advanced polyps and CRC on surveillance colonoscopy was low regardless of life 
expectancy. Despite this observation, 58.1% of older adults with less than 5 
years' life expectancy were recommended to return for future surveillance 
colonoscopy. These data may help refine decision-making about pursuing or 
stopping surveillance colonoscopy in older adults with a history of polyps.

BACKGROUND: New treatment options have significantly improved the life 
expectancy of myeloma patients such that their cause of death is increasingly 
likely to be from something other than myeloma. Furthermore, the adverse effects 
of short- or long-term treatments as well as the disease are impacting on 
quality of life (QoL) for longer periods of time. Understanding people's QoL and 
what is important to them, is part of providing holistic care. Although QoL data 
has been collected for many years in myeloma studies, they have not been used to 
inform patient outcomes. There is growing evidence that supports the assessment 
of 'fitness' and consideration of QoL as part of routine myeloma care. A 
national survey was carried out to discover which QoL tools are currently being 
used in the routine care of myeloma patients, by whom and at which time point.
METHODS: An online survey using SurveyMonkey was adopted for flexibility and 
accessibility. The link to the survey was circulated via Bloodwise, Myeloma UK 
and Cancer Research UK contact lists. Paper questionnaires were circulated at 
the UK Myeloma Forum.
RESULTS: Data about practices in 26 centres were collected. This included sites 
across England and Wales. Three out of 26 centres collect QoL data as part of 
standard care. QoL tools used include EORTC QLQ-My20/24, MyPOS, FACT-BMT and 
Quality of Life Index. Questionnaires were completed by patients before, during 
or after a clinic appointment. Clinical nurse specialists calculate the scores 
and create a care plan.
CONCLUSION: Despite growing evidence to support an holistic approach to 
management of myeloma patients, there is a lack of evidence to confirm that 
health-related QoL is being addressed in standard care. This is an area that 
needs further research.

External causes continue to be one of the main causes of mortality in the world 
and Cabo Verde is no exception. Economic evaluations can be used to demonstrate 
the disease burden of public health problems such as injuries and external 
causes and support prioritization of interventions aimed at improving the health 
of the population. The objective of this study was to estimate the indirect 
costs of premature mortality in 2018 due to injuries and other consequences of 
external causes in Cabo Verde. Years of potential life lost, years of potential 
productive life lost and human capital approach were used to estimate the burden 
and indirect costs of premature mortality. In 2018, 244 deaths were registered 
due to injury and other consequences of external causes. Males were responsible 
for 85.4% and 87.73% of years of potential life lost and years of potential 
productive life lost, respectively. The cost of productivity lost due to 
premature death caused by injury was 4,580,225.91 USD. The social and economic 
burden due to trauma was substantial. There is a need for more evidence on the 
burden of disease due to injuries and their consequences, to support the 
implementation of targeted multi-sectoral strategies and policies for the 
prevention, management, and reduction of costs due to injuries in Cabo Verde.

INTRODUCTION: Nonoperative management (NOM) of acute appendicitis in the 
pediatric population is highly debated with uncertain cost-effectiveness. We 
performed a decision tree cost-effectiveness analysis of NOM versus early 
laparoscopic appendectomy (LA) for acute appendicitis in children.
METHODS: We created a decision tree model for a simulated cohort of 49,000 
patients, the number of uncomplicated appendectomies performed annually, 
comparing NOM and LA. We included postoperative complications, recurrent 
appendicitis, and antibiotic-related complications. We used the payer 
perspective with a 1-year time horizon. Model uncertainty was analyzed using a 
probabilistic sensitivity analysis. Event probabilities, health-state utilities, 
and costs were obtained from literature review, Healthcare Cost and Utilization 
Project, and Medicare fee schedules.
RESULTS: In the base-case analysis, NOM costs $6530/patient and LA costs 
$9278/patient on average at 1 y. Quality-adjusted life year (QALY) differences 
minimally favored NOM compared to LA with 0.997 versus 0.996 QALYs/patient. The 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for NOM over LA was $4,791,149.52/QALY. NOM 
was dominant in 97.4% of simulations, outperforming in cost and QALYs. A 
probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed NOM was 99.6% likely to be 
cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000/QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: Our model demonstrates that NOM is a dominant strategy to LA over a 
1-year horizon. We use recent trial data demonstrating higher rates of early and 
late NOM failures. However, we also incorporate a shorter length of index 
hospitalizations with NOM, reflecting a contemporary approach to NOM and 
ultimately driving cost-effectiveness. Long-term follow-up data are needed in 
this population to assess the cost-effectiveness of NOM over longer time 
horizons, where healthcare utilization and recurrence rates may be higher.

INTRODUCTION: Efficient healthcare planning requires reliable projections of the 
future increase in costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) lost due to 
dementia.
METHODS: We used the microsimulation model MISCAN-Dementia to simulate life 
histories and dementia occurrence using population-based Rotterdam Study data 
and nationwide birth cohort demographics. We estimated costs and QALYs lost in 
the Netherlands from 2020 to 2050, incorporating literature estimates of cost 
and utility for patients and caregivers by dementia severity and care setting.
RESULTS: Societal costs and QALYs lost due to dementia are estimated to double 
between 2020 and 2050. Costs are incurred predominantly through institutional 
(34%), formal home (31%), and informal home care (20%). Lost QALYs are mostly 
due to shortened life expectancy (67%) and, to a lesser extent, quality of life 
with severe dementia (14%).
DISCUSSION: To limit healthcare costs and quality of life losses due to 
dementia, interventions are needed that slow symptom progression and reduce care 
dependency.

The biosynthetic pathway of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) has previously been 
reported in marine bacteria, while the regulatory mechanism remains poorly 
understood. In this study, a putative transcriptional regulator PfaR encoded 
adjacent to the PFA biosynthesis gene cluster (pfaEABCD) was computationally and 
experimentally characterized. Comparative analyses on the wild type (WT) strain, 
in-frame deletion, and overexpression mutants revealed that PfaR positively 
regulated EPA synthesis at low temperature. RNA-Seq and real-time quantitative 
PCR analyses demonstrated that PfaR stimulated the transcription of pfaABCD. The 
transcription start site of pfaR was mapped by using primer extension and highly 
conserved promoter motifs bound by the housekeeping Sigma 70 factor that were 
identified in the upstream of pfaR. Moreover, overexpression of PfaR in WT 
strain W3-18-1 at low temperature could improve EPA productivity from 0.07% to 
0.13% (percentage of EPA to dry weight, mg/mg) of dry weight. Taken together, 
these findings could provide important implications into the transcriptional 
control and metabolic engineering in terms of EPA productivity for industrial 
strains. IMPORTANCE We have experimentally confirmed that PfaR is a positive 
transcription regulator that promotes EPA synthesis at low temperature in 
Shewanella putrefaciens W3-18-1. Overexpression of PfaR in WT strain W3-18-1 
could lead to a 1.8-fold increase in EPA productivity at low temperature. It is 
further shown that PfaR may be regulated by housekeeping Sigma 70 factor at low 
temperature.

INTRODUCTION: Dead space is an important risk factor for poor wound healing; 
therefore, it is important to effectively fill deep dead space through 
individualized tissue flap design during the repair of complex wounds. 
Adipofascial flaps have yielded good results in the repair of deep dead space 
wounds.
OBJECTIVE: The authors evaluated the efficacy of 3 kinds of adipofascial flaps 
to repair deep dead space wounds.
METHODS: From January 2019 to January 2022, 15 patients with complicated wounds 
accompanied by deep dead space underwent repair via 1 of 3 kinds of adipofascial 
flaps, and the clinical efficacy was observed.
RESULTS: All 15 transplanted adipofascial flaps exhibited complete survival, and 
within a mean follow-up of 14.7 months, both the donor and recipient sites had 
successfully healed.
CONCLUSION: The traditional pedicled adipofascial flap was used to repair single 
deep dead space wounds, and pedicled perforator adipofascial extension flaps or 
layered fasciocutaneous flaps were used on compound tissue defect wounds, thus 
providing a relatively simple, safe, and effective method to repair a small area 
of tissue defect with deep dead space wounds.

In the last few decades, there have been considerable improvements in the 
diagnosis and care of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), the most common 
childhood muscular dystrophy. International guidelines have been published and 
recently reviewed. A group of Brazilian experts has developed a standard of care 
based on a literature review with evidence-based graded recommendations in a 
two-part publication. Implementing best practice management has helped change 
the natural history of this chronic progressive disorder, in which the life 
expectancy for children of the male sex in the past used to be very limited. 
Since the previous publication, diagnosis, steroid treatment, rehabilitation, 
and systemic care have gained more significant insights with new original work 
in certain fields. Furthermore, the development of new drugs is ongoing, and 
some interventions have been approved for use in certain countries. Therefore, 
we have identified the need to review the previous care recommendations for 
Brazilian patients with DMD. Our objective was to create an evidence-based 
document that is an update on our previous consensus on those topics.

Publisher: Nas últimas décadas, houve progressos significativos no diagnóstico e 
no tratamento da distrofia muscular de Duchenne (DMD), considerada a distrofia 
muscular mais comum na infância. Diretrizes internacionais foram publicadas e 
revisadas recentemente. Um grupo de especialistas brasileiros desenvolveu um 
padrão de atendimento baseado em revisão de literatura, com recomendações 
graduadas pautadas em evidências compiladas em uma publicação dividida em duas 
partes. A implementação de melhores práticas de manejo ajudou a modificar a 
história natural desta doença crônica, progressiva, que, no passado, oferecia 
uma expectativa de vida muito limitada para crianças do sexo masculino. Desde a 
publicação desse consenso anterior, o diagnóstico, o tratamento com esteroides, 
a reabilitação e os cuidados sistêmicos ganharam novas possibilidades a partir 
da divulgação dos resultados de trabalhos originais em algumas dessas áreas. 
Além disso, as pesquisas e o desenvolvimento de novos fármacos estão em 
andamento, e algumas intervenções já foram aprovadas para uso em determinados 
países. Nesse contexto, identificamos a necessidade de rever as recomendações 
anteriores sobre o manejo dos pacientes brasileiros com DMD. Nosso objetivo 
principal foi elaborar uma atualização baseada em evidências sobre esses tópicos 
do consenso.

SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: In children with kidney failure, little is known about 
their treatment trajectories or the effects of kidney failure on lifetime 
survival and years of life lost, which are arguably more relevant measures for 
children. In this population-based cohort study of 2013 children who developed 
kidney failure in Australia and New Zealand, most children were either 
transplanted after initiating dialysis (74%) or had a preemptive kidney 
transplant (14%). Life expectancy increased with older age at kidney failure, 
but more life years were spent on dialysis than with a functioning transplant. 
The expected (compared with the general population) number of life years lost 
ranged from 16 to 32 years, with female patients and those who developed kidney 
failure at a younger age experiencing the greatest loss of life years.
BACKGROUND: Of the consequences of kidney failure in childhood, those rated as 
most important by children and their caregivers are its effects on long-term 
survival. From a life course perspective, little is known about the experience 
of kidney failure treatment or long-term survival.
METHODS: To determine expected years of life lost (YLL) and treatment trajectory 
for kidney failure in childhood, we conducted a population-based cohort study of 
all children aged 18 years or younger with treated kidney failure in Australia 
(1980-2019) and New Zealand (1988-2019).We used patient data from the CELESTIAL 
study, which linked the Australian and New Zealand Dialysis and Transplant 
registry with national death registers. We estimated standardized mortality 
ratios and used multistate modeling to understand treatment transitions and life 
expectancy.
RESULTS: A total of 394 (20%) of 2013 individuals died over 30,082 person-years 
of follow-up (median follow-up, 13.1 years). Most children (74%) were 
transplanted after initiating dialysis; 14% (18% of male patients and 10% of 
female patients) underwent preemptive kidney transplantation. Excess deaths 
(compared with the general population) decreased dramatically from 1980 to 1999 
(from 41 to 22 times expected) and declined more modestly (to 17 times expected) 
by 2019. Life expectancy increased with older age at kidney failure, but more 
life years were spent on dialysis than with a functioning transplant. The number 
of YLL ranged from 16 to 32 years, with the greatest loss among female patients 
and those who developed kidney failure at a younger age.
CONCLUSIONS: Children with kidney failure lose a substantial number of their 
potential life years. Female patients and those who develop kidney failure at 
younger ages experience the greatest burden.

Epidemiological and toxicological studies have shown that inhalation of 
particulate matter (PM) is associated with development of cardiovascular 
diseases. Long-term exposure to PM may increase the risk of cardiovascular 
events and reduce life expectancy. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a 
chronic inflammatory disease, autoimmune in nature, that is characterized by the 
production of autoantibodies that affects several organs, including the heart. 
Air pollution - which can be caused by several different factors - may be one of 
the most important points both at the onset and the natural history of SLE. 
Therefore this study aims to investigate whether exposure to air pollution 
promotes increased inflammation and cardiac remodelling in animals predisposed 
to SLE. Female NZBWF1 mice were exposed to an environmental particle 
concentrator. Aspects related to cardiac remodelling, inflammation and apoptosis 
were analysed in the myocardium. Body weight gain, cardiac trophism by 
heart/body weight ratio, relative area of cardiomyocytes and the fibrotic area 
of cardiac tissue were evaluated during the exposure period. Animals exposed to 
PM2.5 showed increased area of cardiomyocytes, and area of fibrosis; in 
addition, we observed an increase in IL-1 and C3 in the cardiac tissue, 
demonstrating increased inflammation. We suggest that air pollution is capable 
of promoting cardiac remodelling and increased inflammation in animals 
predisposed to SLE.

AIMS: To evaluate the association of cardiovascular health (CVH), measured by 
Life's Essential 8 score, with the risk of premature mortality and to determine 
the patterns of CVH-related differences in life expectancy among people with and 
without type 2 diabetes (T2D).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective study included 309,789 participants (age 
56.6 ± 8.1 years; 46% men) enroled in the UK Biobank. The Life's Essential 8 
composite measure consists of four health behaviours (diet, physical activity, 
nicotine exposure, and sleep) and four health factors (BMI, non-HDL cholesterol, 
blood glucose, and blood pressure), and the maximum CVH score was 100 points. 
CVH was categorised into low, moderate, and high groups. Premature death was 
defined as death before the age of 75. Cox proportional hazard ratios (HRs) with 
95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated, and life expectancy was 
estimated.
RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 12.7 years, 13,683 cases of premature 
death were documented. Compared to participants with low CVH, the multivariable 
HRs (95% CIs) of premature death were 0.59 (0.56-0.62) and 0.42 (0.39-0.45) for 
the moderate and high CVH groups, respectively. This association was stronger in 
participants with T2D compared with those without T2D. At the age of 50 years, 
compared to low CVH groups, high CVH was associated with a gain of 9.79 
(9.70-9.87) and 5.58 (5.48-5.67) additional life years for men with and without 
T2D, respectively. The corresponding life gain for women with and without T2D 
was 24.21 (24.13-24.27) and 10.18 (10.10-10.27), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Maintaining an ideal Life's Essential 8 score may provide more 
benefits for people with T2D than for those without T2D, including a lower risk 
of premature death and an increased lifespan.

BACKGROUND: In children with kidney failure, the longer the duration of dialysis 
the greater the impact on growth deficit, quality of life, and life expectancy. 
The aim of this research is to test whether there was a shortening of treatment 
time from kidney failure to transplantation in pediatric patients and whether 
this time interval impacted height.
METHODS: Observational retrospective cohort study from 2005 to 2018. The first 
outcome variable was time to transplantation in years, while the second was 
height/age standard deviation score (SDS) at transplantation. Cox regression 
models were used to analyze time from disease to transplantation and linear 
regression was employed to test the association of the year of kidney failure 
onset with height.
RESULTS: A total of 780 children were evaluated and 517 underwent kidney 
transplantation after a median time of 1.9 years (IQR = 1.0-4.0). The variables 
significantly associated with time to transplant were: year of kidney failure 
onset (HR = 1.07; 95% CI: 1.05-1.10; p < .001), age at kidney failure onset 
<12 years (HR = 0.59; 95% CI: 0.49-0.71; p < .001), living in different state as 
transplant center (HR = 0.63; 95% CI: 0.53-0.77; p < .001), and undergoing blood 
transfusion before transplantation (HR = 0.63; 95% CI: 0.53-0.75; p < .001). 
Regarding growth, for each 1-year increase in the epoch of kidney failure onset, 
a 0.05 SDS raise in height/age is expected (p < .001).
CONCLUSION: Children with recent kidney failure onset had significantly lower 
time to the outcome and this reduction was associated with a less severe growth 
deficit.

BACKGROUND: Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) is an ultrarare, fatal, 
premature aging disease caused by a toxic protein called progerin. Circulating 
progerin has not been previously detected, precluding research using readily 
available biological samples. This study aimed to develop a plasma progerin 
assay to evaluate progerin's quantity, response to progerin-targeted therapy, 
and relationship to patient survival.
METHODS: Biological samples were collected by The Progeria Research Foundation 
Cell and Tissue Bank from a non-HGPS cohort cross-sectionally and a HGPS cohort 
longitudinally. HGPS donations occurred at baseline and intermittently while 
treated with farnesylation inhibitors lonafarnib±pravastatin and zoledronate, 
within 3 sequential open-label clinical trials at Boston Children's Hospital 
totaling >10 years of treatment. An ultrasensitive single-molecule counting 
progerin immunoassay was developed with prespecified performance parameters. 
Intra- and interpatient group statistics were descriptive. The relationship 
between progerin and survival was assessed by using joint modeling with 
time-dependent slopes parameterization.
RESULTS: The assay's dynamic detection range was 59 to 30 000 pg/mL (R2=0.9987). 
There was no lamin A cross-reactivity. Mean plasma progerin in non-HGPS 
participants (n=69; 39 male, 30 female; age, 0.2-71.3 years) was 351±251 pg/mL, 
and in drug-naive participants with HGPS (n=74; 37 female, 37 male; age, 
2.1-17.5 years) was 33 261±12 346 pg/mL, reflecting a 95-fold increase in 
affected children (P<0.0001). Progerin levels did not differ by sex (P=0.99). 
Lonafarnib treatment resulted in an average per-visit progerin decrease from 
baseline of between 35% to 62% (all P<0.005); effects were not augmented by 
adding pravastatin and zoledronate. Progerin levels fell within 4 months of 
therapy and remained lower for up to 10 years. The magnitude of progerin 
decrease positively associated with patient survival (P<0.0001; ie, 15 000 pg/mL 
decrease yields a 63.9% decreased risk of death). For any given decrease in 
progerin, life expectancy incrementally increased with longer treatment 
duration.
CONCLUSIONS: A sensitive, quantitative immunoassay for progerin was developed 
and used to demonstrate high progerin levels in HGPS plasma that decreased with 
lonafarnib therapy. The extent of improved survival was associated with both the 
magnitude of progerin decrease and duration at lower levels. Thus, plasma 
progerin is a biomarker for HGPS whose reduction enables short- and long-term 
assessment of progerin-targeted treatment efficacy.

age than peers with typical development?

BACKGROUND: Life expectancy is on rise and the intriguing question is: When does 
cognitive decline occur among adults with intellectual disability, compared to 
adults with typical development? This cross-sectional study examined cognitive 
performance of crystallised/fluid intelligence, working and long-term memory of 
adults with intellectual disability of etiologies other than Down syndrome (IQ 
50-68) and adults with typical development (IQ 85-114) in four age cohorts 
(30-39; 40-49; 50-59; 60-69).
METHOD: The WAIS IIIHEB and the Rey-AVLT were administered to both groups.
RESULTS: Four patterns of cognitive performance were found: (a) Vocabulary 
(crystallised intelligence), Spatial Span Forward and Retention yielded similar 
scores across all four age cohorts in participants with typical development and 
with intellectual disability. (b) Similarities, Raven and Digit Span Backward 
exhibit lower scores only in 50-59 or 60-69 compared to the 30-39 age cohort in 
both groups, (c) Digit Span Forward, Spatial Span Backward and Total Leaning 
(LTM) yielded lower scores in the 50-59 or 60-69 age cohorts in the typical 
group, but similar scores in participants with intellectual disability along the 
age cohorts, (d) Block Design (fluid intelligence) yielded a lower score in the 
50-59 cohort versus lower scores only at ages 60-69 in participants with typical 
development.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest a possible parallel trajectory in age-related 
cognitive performance for individuals with and without intellectual disability 
in six measures, and a possible more preserved trajectory in fluid intelligence 
and some memory measures in adults with intellectual disability compared to 
their peers. Caution should be exercised regarding Digit and Spatial Span 
Backwards, which yielded a floor effect in participants with intellectual 
disability. The Cognitive Reserve Theory, the Safeguard Hypothesis and late 
maturation might serve as explanations for these findings.

Examining the computation of the underlying components of DALYs.

Public Health, 677 Huntington Avenue, Boston, MA 02115, USA.

Disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) capture the mortality and morbidity 
arising from a disease: they incorporate the years of life lost (YLLs) and the 
years of life lived with disability (YLD) due to a disease. The relative 
importance of YLLs and YLDs differs across diseases. The magnitudes of YLLs and 
YLDs depend on parameters such as the age of onset of disease, duration of 
disease, the case fatality ratio and disability weight. In this paper, we 
examine the mathematical computation of the DALY and its underlying components, 
YLDs and YLLs. We aim to demonstrate under which circumstances (e.g. sets of 
input parameters) disease-specific YLDs and YLLs become sizeable relative to one 
another using the parameters of a set of diseases in low-income country 
settings. Researchers could then focus on understanding the key inputs that 
drive the relative extents of YLDs and YLLs (e.g. determine whether a detailed 
estimation of disability weights is essential), while maintaining DALYs as their 
key outcome metric consistent with disease burden assessments.

Risk and Benefit of mRNA COVID-19 Vaccines for the Omicron Variant by Age, Sex, 
and Presence of Comorbidity: A Quality-Adjusted Life Years Analysis.

Kitano T, Thompson DA, Engineer L, Dudley MZ, Salmon DA.

Comment in
    Am J Epidemiol. 2023 Jun 2;192(6):1031.

The development of the mutant omicron variant of severe acute respiratory 
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) during the coronavirus disease 2019 
(COVID-19) pandemic raised the importance of reevaluating the risk and benefit 
of COVID-19 vaccines. With a decision tree model, we calculated the benefit-risk 
ratio and the benefit-risk difference of receiving monovalent messenger RNA 
(mRNA) COVID-19 vaccine (primary 2 doses, a third dose, and a fourth dose) in 
the 4-5 months after vaccination using quality-adjusted life years. The analysis 
was stratified by age, sex, and the presence of comorbidity. Evidence from 
peer-reviewed publications and gray literature was reviewed on September 16, 
2022, to inform the study. Benefit-risk ratios for receipt of the BNT162b2 
vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech) ranged from 6.8 for males aged 12-17 years without 
comorbidity for the primary doses to 221.3 for females aged ≥65 years with 
comorbidity for the third dose. The benefit-risk ratios for receipt of the 
mRNA-1273 vaccine (Moderna) ranged from 7.2 for males aged 18-29 years without 
comorbidity for the primary doses to 101.4 for females aged ≥65 years with 
comorbidity for the third dose. In all scenarios of the one-way sensitivity 
analysis, the benefit-risk ratios were more than 1, irrespective of age, sex, 
comorbidity status, and type of vaccine, for both primary and booster doses. The 
benefits of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines in protecting against the omicron variant 
outweigh the risks, irrespective of age, sex, and comorbidity.

IMPORTANCE: Little is known regarding the effect of poor sleep on health-related 
quality of life (HRQOL) in healthy children.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of induced mild sleep deprivation on HRQOL in 
children without major sleep issues.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This prespecified secondary analysis focused 
on HRQOL, a secondary outcome of the Daily Rest, Eating, and Activity Monitoring 
(DREAM) randomized crossover trial of children who underwent alternating weeks 
of sleep restriction and sleep extension and a 1-week washout in between. The 
DREAM trial intervention was administered at participants' homes between October 
2018 and March 2020. Participants were 100 children aged 8 to 12 years who lived 
in Dunedin, New Zealand; had no underlying medical conditions; and had parent- 
or guardian-reported normal sleep (8-11 hours/night). Data were analyzed between 
July 4 and September 1, 2022.
