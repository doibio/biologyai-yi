When an investigational anticancer drug is being tested, demonstration of 
improvement in overall survival (OS) will generally lead to regulatory approval. 
However, the value that improvement in OS adds to patients' lives is guided 
largely by the context of the improvement and accompanying trade-offs. For 
example, when a patient's life expectancy is less than 6 months, many 
oncologists will not embark on any active cancer treatments. However, multiple 
new anticancer drugs have been approved recently after being tested in end-stage 
cancer patients and demonstrating median OS in the experimental arm close to 6 
months. Such practice, particularly when the treatment is also accompanied by 
serious toxicities and cost, can undermine a peaceful life-death transition. In 
this commentary, we review regulatory approvals in the last 5 years and the 
ethical considerations involved in testing active cancer treatment in terminal 
cancer patients.

Measuring the level of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), as a guide to 
pharmacotherapy, can increase the survival of patients with heart failure. This 
study is aimed at systematically reviewing the studies conducted on the 
cost-effectiveness of BNP-guided care in patients with heart failure. Using the 
systematic review method, we reviewed the published studies on the 
cost-effectiveness of BNP-guided care in patients with heart failure during the 
years 2004 to 2017. The results showed that all studies clearly stated the time 
horizon of the study and included direct medical costs in their analysis. In 
addition, most of the studies used the Markov model. The quality-adjusted life 
years (QALYs) were the main outcome used for measuring the effectiveness. The 
studies reported various ranges of the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
(ICER); accordingly, the highest ratio was observed in the USA ($32,748) and the 
lowest ratio was observed in Canada ($6251). Although the results of the studies 
were different in terms of a number of aspects, such as the viewpoint of the 
study, the study horizons, and the costs of expenditure items, they reached 
similar results. Based on the results of the present study, it seems that the 
use of BNP or N-terminal pro-BNP (NT-pro-BNP) in patients with heart failure may 
reduce cost compared to the symptom-based clinical care and increase QALY. In 
this regard, these studies were designed and conducted in high-income countries; 
thus, the application of these results in low- and middle-income countries will 
be limited.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate, from a societal perspective, the incremental 
cost-effectiveness of withdrawing tumor necrosis factor inhibitor (TNFi) 
treatment compared to continuation of these drugs within a 1-year, randomized 
trial among rheumatoid arthritis patients with longstanding, stable disease 
activity or remission.
METHODS: Data were collected from a pragmatic, open-label trial. Cost-utility 
analysis was performed using the nonparametric bootstrapping method, and a 
cost-effectiveness acceptability curve was constructed using the net-monetary 
benefit framework, where a willingness-to-accept threshold (WTA) was defined as 
the minimal cost saved that a patient accepted for each quality-adjusted life 
year (QALY) lost.
RESULTS: A total of 531 patients were randomized to the stop group and 286 
patients to the continuation group. Withdrawal of TNFi treatment resulted in a 
>60% reduction of the total drug cost, but led to an increase of ∼30% in other 
health care expenditures. Compared to continuation, stopping TNFi resulted in a 
mean yearly cost saving of €7,133 (95% confidence interval [95% CI] €6,071, 
€8,234]) and was associated with a mean loss of QALYs of 0.02 (95% CI 0.002, 
0.040). Mean saved cost per QALY lost and per extra flare incurred in the stop 
group compared to the continuation group was €368,269 (95% CI €155,132, 
€1,675,909) and €17,670 (95% CI €13,650, €22,721), respectively. At a WTA of 
€98,438 per QALY lost, the probability that stopping TNFi treatment is 
cost-effective was 100%.
CONCLUSION: Although an official WTA is not defined, the mean saved cost of 
€368,269 per QALY lost seems acceptable in The Netherlands, given existing data 
on willingness to pay.

[Impacts of warming and nitrogen addition on organic fraction release in fresh 
litter of Larix potaninii in alpine zone of the western Sichuan Province, 
China].

The decomposition dynamics of organic components in fresh litter of Larix 
potaninii were monitored by in situ litter-bag incubation under four treatments, 
i.e., field condition (CK), nitrogen addition (AN, 2 g N·m-2), warming by 
top-open chamber (OTC), nitrogen addition with warming by top-open chamber 
(OTC+AN), from November to next September. Decomposition of water-soluble sugar, 
water-soluble phenol and total polyphenol were stimulated significantly under 
the treatment OTC, AN and OTC+AN during the first four months compared with the 
CK, but the difference of these components release narrowed with the extension 
of incubation time. Compared with CK, releases of dichloromethane-extractable 
fraction, acid soluble carbohydrates, acid soluble lignin, and acid insoluble 
lignin, were inhibited significantly under OTC, AN, and OTC+AN treatments, and 
the significance of inhibitory effect under the treatments was: OTC > OTC+AN > 
AN. Especially, in the treatment of OTC, half-life of 
dichloromethane-extractable fraction and acid inso-luble lignin in fresh litter 
were doubled, and that of hot-water soluble component was prolonged by more than 
50% compared with CK. Half-life of water-soluble sugar, water-soluble phenol, 
total polyphenol, acid-soluble carbohydrate and acid-soluble lignin in fresh 
litter were respectively 182, 159, 127, 154 and 190 d in CK, and these 
components seem to be easily mineralized organic fraction. Meanwhile, half-life 
of hot-water soluble components, dichloromethane-extractable fraction, and acid 
insoluble lignin was 209, 302 and 318 d, respectively, indicating these 
fractions recalcitrant to decomposing in the fresh litter. Decomposition of all 
components in L. potaninii litter occurred in cold season from November to next 
March, which suggested that cold season was the most important period for litter 
decay in the alpine conifer. Generally it was assumed that microorganisms were 
inactive and decomposition of organic matters was slow in alpine soil during 
harsh winter, while the results of fresh litter incubation in situ showed that 
all components decomposed very fast during the period. Therefore, in alpine 
treeline, nitrogen deposition and warming would inhibit rather than promote 
decomposition of fresh litter, which would be conducive to carbon sequestration 
for the alpine soil ecosystem.

INTRODUCTION: Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) models are 
becoming one of the most interesting fields for developing therapeutics and 
therapeutics related patents. At present, QSAR methodologies comprise a series 
of possibilities, including joining forces with machine learning methods and 
increasing even more the swiftness they might bring to the prospective 
development of therapeutics in the Health Sciences scope.
AREAS COVERED: After evaluating the period from 2010 to early 2018, the areas 
covered by the reviewed QSAR based therapeutics patents comprise three main 
fields (drug development, risk assessment and novel QSAR methodologies), and 
several areas, from cancer and cancer related symptomatology to 
neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's disease, or even monitoring 
several chemical particles carrier-mediums or interface frontiers.
EXPERT OPINION: Among the several conclusions drawn from this reviewing, some 
pertain to the near future of investigative research on QSAR based inventions 
for therapeutic purposes, while others include the prospective of an even more 
grown interest on cytotoxicity assessment with in silico models and protocols. 
Further, the type of compounds described in these types of patents is likely to 
see an increase in neurodegenerative diseases therapeutics, as the novel 
methodologies meet the challenging global health needs as human life expectancy 
increases.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical efficacy of meningeal carcinomatosis (MC) 
treated by intrathecal chemotherapy (IC) and analyzes the prognostic factors.
METHODS: The clinical and follow-up data of 33 MC patients was collected and 
retrospectively analyzed. Potential prognostic factors such as age, gender, 
primary cancer, transfer time, presence of brain metastasis, intracranial 
pressure, protein, glucose, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), eastern 
cooperative oncology group (ECOG) performance status (PS), systemic treatment 
and IC were discussed.
RESULTS: The most common clinical manifestation of MC was high intracranial 
pressure (30 cases). The negative rate of cerebrospinal fluid cytology was 50% 
after MC patients treated by IC. The remission rate of IC and no-IC group was 
71.4% and 15.7%, respectively, of which the stability rate was 92.8% and 57.8% 
with significant difference. The median survival time was 5.200 months (95% CI 
0.000-11.491) and the survival rate of 3, 6, 12 months were respectively 71.6%, 
49.2%, 30.7%.
CONCLUSION: IC can relieve the symptoms of MC and extend life expectancy. Early 
treatment can improve prognosis. Presence of brain metastasis, ECOG PS and IC 
were correlated with prognosis of patients, whereas IC is an independent 
prognostic factor.

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is an inherited disease characterized by 
unexplained left ventricular hypertrophy. Although it is estimated to affect 1 
out of 500 people, the HCM gene carrier prevalence is much more common, probably 
as high as 1 in 200 people. Most affected individuals have a normal life 
expectancy, whereas some patients may develop sudden cardiac death or end-stage 
heart failure. Despite significant developments in the treatment of HCM with 
surgical, interventional, and device-based procedures, the main focus of current 
pharmacological therapy has not evolved from the basic objectives of relief of 
symptoms and improvement in functional capacity. To date, no medical treatment 
has been shown to prolong survival or reduce the risk of sudden cardiac death. 
In recent decades, research focus in HCM has shifted to identify the treatments 
which are able to alter the natural pathophysiological process of this disease. 
This article reviews the currently recommended and frequently used medications 
(beta-blockers, nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, and disopyramide) 
and emerging pharmacological treatment options in the management of HCM. The 
mechanism of action and latest clinical trials of the novel agents are discussed 
in greater detail.

BACKGROUND: Dignity Therapy (DT) is a short-term intervention to reduce 
psychological suffering in end-of-life care. Its strength lies in 
evidenced-based development and investigation. The aim of the present study is 
to investigate the feasibility of DT at German palliative care units (PCU), as 
well as the acceptability and adaption of a German version of the DT question 
protocol (DTQP).
METHOD: A clinical multicentre mixed methods study, whereby patients and 
relatives provided quantitative (feedback questionnaires) and qualitative 
(cognitive interviews) data on the DT intervention. Before using the DTQP on 
patients, healthcare professionals (HCP) were invited to participate in 
cognitive interviews to provide input on DT. Therefore 360° feedback was 
achieved. Finally, the conducted DT interviews were examined. The study took 
place at two German PCUs (Mainz and Würzburg). Participating HCPs were 
physicians, psychologists, nurses and chaplains. Patients admitted to the PCUs 
were eligible to participate if they had a terminal illness and a life 
expectancy ranging from 2 weeks to 12 months.
RESULTS: Out of 410 admitted patients, 72 were eligible and 30 (7.3% of all 
patients and 41.7% of eligible patients) participated. On average, 9 questions 
from the DTQP were used per DT interview. Subsequent cognitive interviews with 
patients produced four main categories of feedback (on the title, the question 
protocol, wording, and the questions actually asked). Finally, of the 30 
participants, 19 completed the feedback questionnaire, as did 26 relatives. Of 
those, 18 patients and 24 relatives evaluated DT as helpful.
CONCLUSIONS: DT is feasible for German PCUs. Our research yielded a validated 
German translation of the DTQP following EORTC guidelines and findings were 
reported according to the COREQ checklist for qualitative design.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study was registered retrospectively on the 22nd of 
December 2017 at the German Clinical Trials Register ( DRKS00013627 ).

The life expectancy and quality of life of women with genetic disorders 
continues to improve, resulting in more women reaching reproductive age and 
desiring fertility. It is becoming increasingly important that obstetricians 
become familiar with common genetic disorders and their associated risks in 
pregnancy. The authors review pregnancy in women with various genetic disorders, 
including review of pregnancy outcomes, management recommendations, and genetic 
risk assessment. Most data on pregnancies in women with genetic conditions are 
based on case reports and literature reviews. Additional studies, including 
pregnancy registries, are needed to improve our understanding and care of this 
patient population.

Trisomy 21 remains relevant today. As patients' life expectancy increases, 
medical monitoring shows the importance of screening for associated 
complications such as epilepsy and sleep apnoea. For caregivers, it constitutes 
a care model for intellectually disabled people notably with regard to anxiety, 
poor expression of pain and family suffering. Scientific advances raise hope of 
progress in therapeutic practices.

The life expectancy of people with trisomy 21 has increased over recent decades. 
More than half live over 55 years today, compared to just 9 years in 1929. This 
progress is thanks to easier access to care and improved medical diagnoses as 
well as greater physical and psychological stimulation. Continued monitoring 
remains essential but it becomes less systematic as children grow up, despite 
the risk of certain complications increasing from puberty. Consultations devoted 
to trisomy 21 aim to facilitate access to care through an adapted care pathway.

Life expectancy has become longer, thus the number of elderly people who require 
treatment for nephrolithiasis has increased. We aimed to analyze the efficacy of 
flexible ureterorenoscopy (f-URS) and miniaturized percutaneous nephrolithotomy 
(mPNL) in the management of 10 and 30 mm renal stones in patients aged >60 
years. In prospective non-randomized series, the data of patients who underwent 
f-URS or mPNL for kidney stones between July 2013 and July 2016 were analyzed. 
The procedure was accepted as successful if the patient was achieved complete 
stone clearance according to CT imaging between 1-3 months postoperatively. In 
total 60 patients and 58 patients were underwent f-URS and mPNL, respectively. 
The mean operation time, fluoroscopy time and hospitalization time were 
significantly shorter for the f-URS (p < 0.001, p < 0.001, p < 0.001, 
respectively). According to Clavien classification system, complication rates 
were not significantly different between the groups (p = 0.673). The stone-free 
rate was 81.7% for the f-URS group and 77.6% for the mPNL group after a 
single-session procedure (p = 0.747). Calcium oxalate monohydrate stones were 
the most common stone type in both groups. In multivariate analysis, multiple 
stones localization was only independent factor to predict complications. Our 
study had showed that both f-URS and mPNL are effective treatment modalities for 
10-30-mm renal stones in elderly patients. Additionally, presence of stones in 
multiple location was the only predictive factor for complication development.

BACKGROUND: Endometrial sampling is widely used for accurate diagnosis of 
endometrial cancer (EC), which is the most common gynecologic cancer in US 
women. The objective of this study was to explore the cost-effectiveness of two 
endometrial sampling procedures for diagnosing EC: (1) Pipelle endometrial 
sampling (Pipelle), and (2) dilatation & curettage (D&C), while accounting for 
sampling procedure failure rates and diagnostic accuracy in women with 
postmenopausal bleeding (PMB).
METHOD: The decision analytic model was built to compare the cost-effectiveness 
of Pipelle and D&C strategies in a hypothetical cohort of PMB women. The 
analysis was performed from the perspective of a public healthcare payer 
(Medicare, US). We used 2017 Medicare reimbursement data for cost estimation. 
The effectiveness of these two diagnostic strategies was measured by analyzing 
the remaining life expectancy after EC diagnosis and subsequent treatment.
RESULTS: The base case analysis suggested that Pipelle was not only equally 
effective (32.11 vs. 32.11 years of life), but also less costly ($1897.80 vs. 
$2999.11) based on Medicare reimbursement when compared to D&C. In one-way 
sensitivity analyses and Monte Carlo probabilistic sensitivity analysis, the 
Pipelle remained the more cost-effective sampling strategy even after accounting 
for sampling failure rate associated with each sampling strategy.
CONCLUSION: The Pipelle is the more cost-effective sampling strategy compared to 
D&C for EC diagnosis in women with PMB. From the cost-effectiveness perspective, 
the higher sampling failure rate of Pipelle should not be regarded as a 
limitation in its clinical application.

OBJECTIVES: Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have shown to be better for 
progression-free survival than chemotherapy as the first-line treatment for 
advanced, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), especially in patients with 
epidermal growth factor receptor mutation (EGFR M+). This study evaluates under 
the Thai health system context, cost-effectiveness of (A) the use of platinum 
doublets for all without EGFR testing, and (B) an EGFR test followed by TKIs or 
platinum doublets conditional on test results.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A decision analysis model was constructed to estimate 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and total cost for each option. Cancer 
progression and death were pooled from randomized, controlled trials. Quality of 
life was obtained from patient interview, using the European Quality-of-Life, 
5-Dimension questionnaire. Costs associated with treatment outcomes were derived 
from patient chart reviews.
RESULTS: Combining the EGFR test with each TKI, gefitinib, erlotinib and 
afatinib if M+ or otherwise platinum doublets, resulted in higher effectiveness 
than the use of platinum doublets for all by 0.15, 0.19 and 0.21 QALYs, 
respectively. Among the three TKIs, gefitinib was dominated economically by 
erlotinib, which incurred an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of 
$46,783/QALY over the platinum doublets for all. Moving to the next best, 
afatinib resulted in the ICER of $198,961/QALY over erlotinib. Probabilities for 
any TKIs being cost-effective when compared with platinum doublets over a wide 
range of willingness to pay were modest.
CONCLUSION: In Thailand, the first-line treatment for advanced NSCLC with TKIs 
conditional on EGFR test results was not cost-effective as compared with 
platinum doublets for all.

Radioiodine therapy is a matter of controversy because different opinions exist 
about its use for differentiated thyroid carcinoma. The following article sheds 
light on the different opinions and explains why we advocate the use of 
radioiodine therapy in more than only high-risk patients. In comparison to other 
malignancies, differentiated thyroid carcinoma has a different tumor biology due 
to its usually slow growth pattern. Radioiodine therapy was first used about 75 
y ago and provided cure at a time when prospective randomized controlled trials 
had yet to be developed. Large patient cohorts and usually at least a decade of 
clinical follow-up are needed to demonstrate a benefit from radioiodine therapy. 
Thus, especially in low-risk patients, many factors define an individual 
treatment decision, including tumor stage, extent of surgery, tumor biology, 
clinical and imaging data, life expectancy, and patient preferences.

Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a fatal cancer with varying life expectancy, 
even for patients undergoing the same standard therapy. Identification of 
differentially expressed genes in GBM patients with different survival rates may 
benefit the development of effective therapeutic strategies. In the present 
study, key pathways and genes correlated with survival in GBM patients were 
screened with bioinformatic analysis. Included in the study were 136 eligible 
patients who had undertaken surgical resection of GBM followed by temozolomide 
(TMZ) chemoradiation and long-term therapy with TMZ. A total of 
383 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) related to GBM survival were 
identified. Gene Ontology and pathway enrichment analysis as well as hub gene 
screening and module analysis were performed. As expected, angiogenesis and 
migration of GBM cells were closely correlated with a poor prognosis. 
Importantly, the results also indicated that cell dormancy was an essential 
contributor to the reduced survival of GBM patients. Given the lack of specific 
targeted genes and pathways known to be involved in tumour cell dormancy, we 
proposed enriched candidate genes related to the negative regulation of cell 
proliferation, signalling pathways regulating pluripotency of stem cells and 
neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, and 3 hub genes (FTH1, GRM1 and DDIT3). 
Maintaining persistent cell dormancy or preventing tumour cells from entering 
dormancy during chemoradiation should be a promising therapeutic strategy.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate metabolic parameters as predictive of local response 
after stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) for liver-oligometastases.
METHODS: Inclusion criteria of the present retrospective study were: (a) liver 
oligometastases with controlled primary tumor; (b) absence of progressive 
disease ≥6 months; (c) metastases ≤ 3; (d) evaluation of SBRT-response by means 
of 18-fludeoxyglucose-PET/CT for at least two subsequent evaluations; (e) 
Karnofsky performance status >80; (f) life-expectancy >6 months. The following 
metabolic parameters were defined semi-quantitatively for each metastases: (1) 
standardized uptake value (SUVmax; (2) SUV-mean; (3) metabolic tumor volume 
(MTV), tumor volume with a SUV ≥3, threshold 40%; (4) total lesion glycolysis 
(TLG), i.e. the product of SUV-mean and MTV. Local control was defined as 
absence of recurrence in the field of irradiation.
RESULTS: 41 liver metastases were analyzed. Pre-SBRT, median SUV-max was 8.7 
(range, 4.5-23.59), median SUV-mean was 4.6 (range, 3-7.5), median MTV was 
5.7 cc (range, 0.9-80.6) and median total lesion glycolysis was 24.1 (range, 
3.6-601.5). At statistical analysis, metastases with SUV-mean >5 (p 0.04; odds 
ratio 4.75, sensitivity = 50%, specificity = 82.6%, area under the curve 0.66) 
and SUV-max >12 (p 0.02; odds ratio 5.03, sensitivity = 69%, specificity = 70%, 
area under the curve = 0.69) showed higher rates of infield-failure compared to 
the remaining lesions.
CONCLUSION: According to current findings, pre-SBRT SUV-max and SUV-mean could 
be predictable of local response in liver oligometastases. Advances in 
knowledge: Present findings could support the hypothesis that 
fludeoxyglucose-PET/CT may be a powerful tool to predict tumor control. 
Specifically, current results might be helpful for clinicians in the 
decision-making process regarding liver oligometastatic patient selection as 
well as the individual therapy stratification distinguishing between slowly 
local progressing patients and rapidly progressing patients.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory and demyelinating disease of 
the central nervous system. In addition to the genetic, epigenetic and 
immunological components, various other factors, e.g. unhealthy dietary habits, 
play a role in the MS pathogenesis. Dietary intervention is a highly appealing 
approach, as it presents a simple and relatively low risk method to potentially 
improve outcomes in patients with brain disorders in order to achieve remission 
and improvement of clinical status, well-being and life expectancy of patients 
with MS. The importance of saturated fat intake restriction for the clinical 
status improvement of MS patients was pointed for the first time in 1950s. 
Recently, decreased risk of first clinical diagnosis of CNS demyelination 
associated with higher intake of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids 
particularly originating from fish was reported. Only few clinical trials have 
been performed to address the question of the role of dietary intervention, such 
is e.g. low saturated fat diet in MS treatment. This review summarizes current 
knowledge about the effect of different dietary approaches (diets low in 
saturated fat and dietary supplements such as fish oil, lipoic acid, omega-3 
polyunsaturated fatty acids, seeds oils, high fiber diet, vitamin D, etc.) on 
neurological signs, patient's well-being, physical and inflammatory status. So 
far the results are not conclusive, therefore much more research is needed to 
confirm and to understand the effectiveness of these dietary interventions in 
the long term and well defined studies.

Diabetes mellitus is a medical condition characterized by the body's loss of 
control over blood sugar. The frequency of diagnosed cases and consequential 
increases in medical costs makes it a rapidly growing chronic disease that 
threatens human health worldwide. In addition, its unnerving statistical 
projections are perilous to both the economy of the nation and man's life 
expectancy. Type-I and type-II diabetes are the two clinical forms of diabetes 
mellitus. Type-II diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is illustrated by the abnormality of 
glucose homeostasis in the body, resulting in hyperglycemia. Although 
significant research attention has been devoted to the development of diabetes 
regimens, which demonstrates success in lowering blood glucose levels, their 
efficacies are unsustainable due to undesirable side effects such as weight gain 
and hypoglycemia. Over the years, heterocyclic scaffolds have been the basis of 
anti-diabetic chemotherapies; hence, in this review we consolidate the use of 
bioactive scaffolds, which have been evaluated for their biological response as 
inhibitors against their respective anti-diabetic molecular targets over the 
past five years (2012-2017). Our investigation reveals a diverse target set 
which includes; protein tyrosine phosphatase 1 B (PTP1B), dipeptidly peptidase-4 
(DPP-4), free fatty acid receptors 1 (FFAR1), G protein-coupled receptors 
(GPCR), peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-γ (PPARγ), sodium glucose 
co-transporter-2 (SGLT2), α-glucosidase, aldose reductase, glycogen 
phosphorylase (GP), fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase), glucagon receptor 
(GCGr) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK). This review offers a 
medium on which future drug design and development toward diabetes management 
may be modelled (i.e. optimization via structural derivatization), as many of 
the drug candidates highlighted show promise as an effective anti-diabetic 
chemotherapy.

Rising life expectancy in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC), coupled with 
the increasing burden of non-communicable diseases, accentuates the importance 
of generating information to support public health strategies. With this aim in 
mind, the purpose of this study was to identify correlates of physical activity 
and sedentary behavior in LMIC. We analyzed Wave 1 data (collected 2007⁻2010) 
from the World Health Organization&rsquo;s longitudinal Study on global AGEing 
and adult health (SAGE), which focuses on nationally representative samples of 
adults aged 50 years and older from six countries (China, n = 13,157; India, n = 
6560; Mexico, n = 2301; Russian Federation, n = 3763; South Africa, n = 3836; 
and Ghana, n = 4305). Associations of physical activity (operationalized as 
meeting physical activity guidelines of &ge;150 min/week of moderate-to-vigorous 
physical activity or not) and sedentary behavior (&ge;4 h/day versus <4 h/day) 
with demographic, health and health risk, functional, interpersonal, and 
environmental factors were assessed using multivariate logistic models. Across 
the six countries, we found fairly consistent and reasonably strong associations 
between both physical activity and sedentary behavior and several demographic 
factors (age and employment, in particular), self-reported health, instrumental 
activities of daily living, factors relating to socializing, and household 
location. Correlates of physical activity and sedentary behavior in LMIC appear 
to be similar to those found in high-income countries.

Active travel (walking and cycling) is beneficial for people&rsquo;s health and 
has many co-benefits, such as reducing motor vehicle congestion and pollution in 
urban areas. There have been few robust evaluations of active travel, and very 
few studies have valued health and emissions outcomes. The ACTIVE 
before-and-after quasi-experimental study estimated the net benefits of health 
and other outcomes from New Zealand&rsquo;s Model Communities Programme using an 
empirical analysis comparing two intervention cities with two control cities. 
The Programme funded investment in cycle paths, other walking and cycling 
facilities, cycle parking, &lsquo;shared spaces&rsquo;, media campaigns and 
events, such as &lsquo;Share the Road&rsquo;, and cycle-skills training. Using 
the modified Integrated Transport and Health Impacts Model, the 
Programme&rsquo;s net economic benefits were estimated from the changes in use 
of active travel modes. Annual benefits for health in the intervention cities 
were estimated at 34.4 disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and two lives 
saved due to reductions in cardiac disease, diabetes, cancer, and respiratory 
disease. Reductions in transport-related carbon emissions were also estimated 
and valued. Using a discount rate of 3.5%, the estimated benefit/cost ratio was 
11:1 and was robust to sensitivity testing. It is concluded that when concerted 
investment is made in active travel in a city, there is likely to be a 
measurable, positive return on investment.

CONTEXT: Patients with advanced cancer often overestimate their time left to 
live. Those who have heightened awareness of their cognitive and physical 
deficits at the end of life may have a better prognostic understanding.
OBJECTIVES: We sought to investigate the extent to which patients' self-reports 
of physical well-being and cognitive function were associated with prognostic 
understanding.
METHODS: Logistic regression analyzed data from Coping with Cancer II, a 
National Cancer Institute-funded study of patients with advanced cancer from 
nine U.S. cancer clinics. Patients with metastatic cancers who had an 
oncologist-estimated life expectancy of less than six months and did not have 
significant cognitive impairment were eligible (N = 300). Trained interviewers 
administered subsets of the McGill Quality of Life and the Functional Assessment 
of Cancer Therapy-Cognition, Version 2, to measure physical well-being and 
cognitive complaints. There were four dichotomous outcomes: acknowledgment of 
their terminal illness; understanding that their diagnosis was late or end 
stage; belief that life expectancy was months, not years; and prognostic 
understanding, which was defined as accurate responses to all three questions. 
Covariates included age and gender.
RESULTS: Worse patient-reported physical well-being and cognitive function were 
independently associated with the patient's acknowledgment of his and/or her 
terminal illness (adjusted odds ratio 0.91; 95% CI = 0.82, 1.00; P = 0.047 and 
adjusted odds ratio 1.73; 95% CI = 1.17, 2.55; P = 0.006, respectively).
CONCLUSION: Patients who reported worse cognitive function and physical 
well-being were more aware of their terminal illness than those with better 
cognitive function.
