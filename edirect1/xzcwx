INTRODUCTION: Partial thickness burns not undergoing surgical excision are 
treated with topical silver products including silver sulfadiazine (SSD) and 
Mepilex Ag. Skin allograft is a more costly alternative that acts as definitive 
wound coverage until autogenous epithelialization. Economic constraints and the 
movement toward value-based care demand cost and outcome justification prior to 
adopting more costly products.
METHODS: A cost-utility analysis was performed comparing skin allograft to SSD 
and Mepilex Ag using decision tree analysis. The base case modeled a superficial 
partial thickness 20% total body surface area burn. Utilities were derived from 
expert opinion on the basis of personal experience. Costs were derived from 2019 
Medicare payments. Quality adjusted life years were calculated using rollback 
method assuming standard life expectancies in the United States. Probabilistic 
sensitivity analysis was performed to asses model robustness.
RESULTS: The incremental costs of skin allograft to Mepilex Ag and SSD were 
$907.71 and $1257.86, respectively. The incremental quality adjusted life year 
(QALY) gains from allograft over Mepilex Ag and SSD were 0.011 and 0.016. This 
yielded an incremental cost-utility ratio for allograft vs. Mepilex Ag of 
$84,189.29/QALY compared with an incremental cost-utility ratio of 
$79,684.63/QALY for allograft vs. SSD. Assuming willingness-to-pay thresholds of 
$100,000/QALY, probabilistic sensitivity analysis demonstrated that allograft 
was cost effective to Mepilex Ag in 62.1% of scenarios, and cost effective to 
SSD in 64.9% of simulations.
CONCLUSION: Skin allograft showed greater QALYs compared with topical silver 
dressings at a higher cost. Depending on willingness-to-pay thresholds, skin 
allograft may be a considered a cost-effective treatment of partial-thickness 
burns.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), 
nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and alcohol-associated liver disease 
(ALD) are main causes of chronic liver disease. We assessed the global 
incidence, mortality, and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) related to 
chronic liver disease (primary liver cancer [LC] and cirrhosis).
APPROACH AND RESULTS: We obtained data from the 2017 Global Burden of Disease 
study. In 2017, there were 2.14 million liver-related deaths 
(2.06-2.30 million), representing an 11.4% increase since 2012 (16.0% increase 
in LC deaths; 8.7% increase in cirrhosis deaths). LC and cirrhosis accounted for 
38.3% and 61.7%, respectively, of liver deaths (LC and cirrhosis deaths were 
related to HBV [39% and 29%], HCV [29% and 26%], ALD [16% and 25%], and NAFLD 
[8% and 9%]). Between 2012 and 2017, age-standardized incidence rate, 
age-standardized death rate (ASDR), and age-standardized DALY rate increased for 
LC from 11.1 to 11.8, 10.1 to 10.2, and 250.4 to 253.6 per 100,000, 
respectively. Although age-standardized incidence rate for cirrhosis increased 
from 66.0 to 66.3, ASDR and age-standardized DALY rate decreased from 17.1 to 
16.5 and 532.9 to 510.7, respectively. The largest increase in ASDR for LC 
occurred in Eastern Europe (annual percent change [APC] = 2.18% [0.89%-3.49%]), 
whereas the largest decrease occurred in high-income Asia Pacific (APC = -2.88% 
[-3.58 to -2.18%]). ASDR for LC-NAFLD and ALD increased annually by 1.42% 
(1.00%-1.83%) and 0.53% (0.08-0.89), respectively, whereas there were no 
increases for HBV (P = 0.224) and HCV (P = 0.054). ASDR for cirrhosis-NAFLD 
increased (APC = 0.29% [0.01%-0.59%]) but decreased for ALD (APC = -0.44% 
[-0.78% to -0.40%]), HCV (APC = -0.50% [-0.81% to -0.18%]), and HBV 
(APC = -1.43% [-1.71% to -0.40%]).
CONCLUSIONS: From 2012 to 2017, the global burden of LC and cirrhosis has 
increased. Viral hepatitis remains the most common cause of liver deaths, and 
NAFLD is the most rapidly growing contributor to liver mortality and morbidity.

BACKGROUND: Sertoli cell tumors (SCTs) of the testes are rare, and the 
literature provides only weak evidence concerning their clinical course and 
management. The objective of this study was to summarize evidence on SCTs' 
clinical presentation, clinicopathological risk factors for malignancy, 
treatment options, and oncological outcomes.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data sources included Medline, Embase, Scopus, the 
Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Web of Science. Published case 
reports, case series, and cohorts were included. Data on clinicopathological 
variables, treatment of local or metastatic disease, site of metastasis, or 
survival were extracted from each study considered in this paper, and 
associations between clinicopathological variables and metastatic disease were 
analyzed. Whenever feasible, data on individual patients were collected.
RESULTS: Of the 435 patients included, only one (<1%) showed local recurrence 
after testis-sparing surgery (TSS). Three patients underwent adjuvant 
retroperitoneal lymphadenectomy. Fifty patients presented with metastases, 
located in the retroperitoneal lymph nodes (76%), lungs (36%), and bones (16%); 
median time to recurrence was 12 months. Risk factors for metastatic disease 
included age, tumor size, necrosis, tumor extension to the spermatic cord, 
angiolymphatic invasion, and mitotic index. Patients with metastases had a 
median life expectancy of 20 months. In six patients, metastasectomy resulted in 
complete remission.
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that few local recurrences result after TSS, 
and no adjuvant therapy can be regarded as a standard of care. Several risk 
factors are predictive of metastatic disease. Surgery leads to remission in 
metastatic disease, whereas systemic treatment alone does not result in 
long-term remission.
IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Testicular Sertoli cell tumors usually present 
without metastatic disease and show low local recurrence rates after 
testis-sparing surgery; no adjuvant therapy option can be regarded as a standard 
of care. Patients with risk factors should undergo staging investigations. Those 
with metastatic disease have poor prognoses, and metastasectomy may be offered 
in selected cases.

Inotersen, a 2'-O-methoxyethyl (2'-MOE) phosphorothioate antisense 
oligonucleotide, reduced disease progression and improved quality of life in 
patients with hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis with polyneuropathy 
(hATTR-PN) in the NEURO-TTR and NEURO-TTR open-label extension (OLE) trials. 
However, 300 mg/week inotersen treatment was associated with platelet count 
reductions in several patients. Mean platelet counts in patients in the 
NEURO-TTR-inotersen group remained ≥140 × 109/L in 50% and ≥100 × 109/L in 80% 
of the subjects. However, grade 4 thrombocytopenia (<25 × 109/L) occurred in 
three subjects in NEURO-TTR trial, and one of these suffered a fatal 
intracranial hemorrhage. The two others were treated successfully with 
corticosteroids and discontinuation of inotersen. Investigations in a subset of 
subjects in NEURO-TTR (n = 17 placebo; n = 31 inotersen) and OLE (n = 33) trials 
ruled out direct myelotoxicity, consumptive coagulopathy, and heparin-induced 
thrombocytopenia. Antiplatelet immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies were detected 
at baseline in 5 of 31 (16%) inotersen-treated subjects in NEURO-TTR, 4 of whom 
eventually developed grade 1 or 2 thrombocytopenia while on the drug. In 
addition, 24 subjects in the same group developed treatment-emergent 
antiplatelet IgG antibodies, of which 2 developed grade 2, and 3 developed grade 
4 thrombocytopenia. Antiplatelet IgG antibodies in two of the three grade 4 
thrombocytopenia subjects targeted GPIIb/IIIa. Plasma cytokines previously 
implicated in immune dysregulation, such as interleukin (IL)-23 and a 
proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL) were often above the normal range at 
baseline. Collectively, these findings suggest an underlying immunologic 
dysregulation predisposing some individuals to immune-mediated thrombocytopenia 
during inotersen treatment.

Seniors constitute the population group generally most at risk of mortality due 
to heat stress. As life expectancy increases and health conditions of elderly 
people improve over time, vulnerability of the population to heat changes as 
well. We employed the years-of-life-lost (YLL) approach, considering life 
expectancy at the time of each death, to investigate how population ageing 
affects temporal changes in heat-related mortality in the Czech Republic. Using 
an updated gridded meteorological database, we identified heat waves during 
1994-2017, and analysed temporal changes in their impacts on YLL and mortality. 
The mean impact of a heat-wave day on relative excess mortality and YLL had 
declined by approximately 2-3% per decade. That decline abated in the current 
decade, however, and the decreasing trend in mean excess mortality as well as 
YLL vanished when the short-term mortality displacement effect was considered. 
Moreover, the cumulative number of excess deaths and YLL during heat waves rose 
due to increasing frequency and intensity of heat waves during the examined 
period. The results show that in studies of temporal changes it is important to 
differentiate between mean effects of heat waves on mortality and the overall 
death burden associated with heat waves. Analysis of the average ratio of 
excess YLL/death per heat-wave day indicated that the major heat-vulnerable 
population group shifted towards older age (70+ years among males and 75+ years 
among females). Our findings highlight the importance of focusing 
heat-protection measures especially upon the elderly population, which is most 
heat-vulnerable and whose numbers are rising.

OBJECTIVES: Countries have constrained healthcare budgets and must prioritize 
new interventions depending on health goals and time frame. This situation is 
relevant in the sphere of national immunization programs, for which many 
different vaccines are proposed, budgets are limited, and efficient choices must 
be made in the order of vaccine introduction.
METHODS: A constrained optimization (CO) model for infectious diseases was 
developed in which different intervention types (prophylaxis and treatment) were 
combined for consideration in Malaysia. Local experts defined their priority 
public health issues: pneumococcal disease, dengue, hepatitis B and C, 
rotavirus, neonatal pertussis, and cholera. Epidemiological, cost, and 
effectiveness data were informed from local or regionally published literature. 
The model aimed to maximize quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gain through the 
reduction of events in each of the different diseases, under budget and 
intervention coverage constraints. The QALY impact of the interventions was 
assessed over 2 periods: lifetime and 20 years. The period of investment was 
limited to 15 years.
RESULTS: The assessment time horizon influenced the prioritization of 
interventions maximizing QALY gain. The incremental health gains compared with a 
uninformed prioritization were large for the first 8 years and declined 
thereafter. Rotaviral and pneumococcal vaccines were identified as key 
priorities irrespective of time horizon, hepatitis B immune prophylaxis and 
hepatitis C treatment were priorities with the lifetime horizon, and dengue 
vaccination replaced these with the 20-year horizon.
CONCLUSIONS: CO modeling is a useful tool for making economically efficient 
decisions within public health programs for the control of infectious diseases 
by helping prioritize the selection of interventions to maximize health gain 
under annual budget constraints.

BACKGROUND: Continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) is the first option 
for patients with end-stage renal disease under the benefit package of Thailand. 
Nevertheless, automated peritoneal dialysis (APD) may benefit these patients in 
terms of both medical and quality-of-life aspects, but it is more expensive. The 
economic evidence for the comparison between CAPD and APD is not inconclusive. 
Thus, this study aims to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of CAPD compared with 
APD in PD patients.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the health-related quality of life and costs between 
patients treated with CAPD and APD.
METHODS: A Markov model was developed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of CAPD 
and APD from the societal perspective. Costs and outcomes were calculated over a 
lifetime horizon and discounted at an annual rate of 3%. The outcomes were 
presented as quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) of CAPD and APD. Utility scores 
were calculated from the utility values of the 5-level EuroQol questionnaire. A 
probabilistic sensitivity analysis using 5000 Monte Carlo simulations was 
performed to evaluate the stability of the results.
RESULTS: The costs of APD and CAPD were 12 868 080 and 11 144 786 Thai baht, 
respectively, whereas the QALYs were 24.28 and 24.72 QALYs, respectively. APD 
was more costly but less effective than CAPD. The most sensitive parameter was 
direct medical cost of outpatient visits. When the willingness-to-pay threshold 
was 160 000 Thai baht per QALY, the probability of APD providing a 
cost-effective alternative to CAPD was 19%.
CONCLUSION: APD was not a cost-effective strategy as compared with CAPD at the 
current Thai threshold. These findings should encourage clinicians and policy 
makers to encompass the use of CAPD as a good value for money for PD treatment.

BACKGROUND: Strengthening Evidence base on scHool-based intErventions for 
pRomoting adolescent health (SEHER) is a multicomponent, whole-school health 
promotion intervention delivered by a lay counsellor or a teacher in 
government-run secondary schools in Bihar, India. The objective of this study is 
to examine the effects of the intervention after two years of follow-up and to 
evaluate the consistency of the findings observed over time.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted a cluster randomised trial in which 75 
schools were randomised (1:1:1) to receive the SEHER intervention delivered by a 
lay counsellor (SEHER Mitra [SM]) or a teacher (Teacher as SEHER Mitra [TSM]), 
respectively, alongside a standardised, classroom-based life skills Adolescence 
Education Program (AEP), compared to AEP alone (control group). The trial design 
was a repeat cross-sectional study. Students enrolled in grade 9 (aged 13-15 
years) in the 2015-2016 academic year were exposed to the intervention for two 
years and the outcome assessment was conducted at three time points─at baseline 
in June 2015; 8-months follow-up in March 2016, when the students were still in 
grade 9; and endpoint at 17-months follow-up in December 2016 (when the students 
were in grade 10), the results of which are presented in this paper. The primary 
outcome, school climate, was measured with the Beyond Blue School Climate 
Questionnaire (BBSCQ). Intervention effects were estimated using mixed-effects 
linear or logistic regression, including a random effect to adjust for 
within-school clustering, minimisation variables, baseline cluster-level score 
of the outcome, and sociodemographic characteristics. In total, 15,232 students 
participated in the 17-month survey. Compared with the control group, the 
participants in the SM intervention group reported improvements in school 
climate (adjusted mean difference [aMD] = 7.33; 95% CI: 6.60-8.06; p < 0.001) 
and most secondary outcomes (depression: aMD = -4.64; 95% CI: -5.83-3.45; p < 
0.001; attitude towards gender equity: aMD = 1.02; 95% CI: 0.65-1.40; p < 0.001; 
frequency of bullying: aMD = -2.77; 95% CI: -3.40 to -2.14; p < 0.001; violence 
victimisation: odds ratio [OR] = 0.08; 95% CI: 0.04-0.14; p < 0.001; and 
violence perpetration: OR = 0.16; 95% CI: 0.09-0.29; p < 0.001). There was no 
evidence of an intervention effect in the TSM group compared with control group. 
The effects of the lay counsellor-delivered intervention were larger for most 
outcomes at 17-months follow-up compared with those at 8 months: school climate 
(effect size [ES; 95% CI] = 2.23 [1.97-2.50] versus 1.88 [1.44-2.32], p < 
0.001); depression (ES [95% CI] = -1.19 [-1.56 to -0.82] versus -0.27 [-0.44 to 
-0.11], p < 0.001); attitude towards gender equity (ES [95% CI] = 0.53 
[0.27-0.79] versus 0.23 [0.10-0.36], p < 0.001); bullying (ES [95% CI] = -2.22 
[-2.84 to -1.60] versus -0.47 [-0.61 to -0.33], p < 0.001); violence 
victimisation (OR [95% CI] = 0.08 [0.04-0.14] versus 0.62 [0.46-0.84], p < 
0.001); and violence perpetration (OR [95% CI] = 0.16 [0.09-0.29] versus 0.68 
[0.48-0.96], p < 0.001), suggesting incremental benefits with an extended 
intervention. A limitation of the study is that 27% of baseline participants did 
not complete the 17-month outcome assessment.
CONCLUSIONS: The trial showed that the second-year outcomes were similar to the 
first-year outcomes, with no effect of the teacher-led intervention and larger 
benefits on school climate and adolescent health accruing from extending lay 
counsellor-delivered intervention.

Early age at diagnosis of breast cancer is a known risk factor for hereditary 
predisposition and some studies show a high risk of contralateral breast cancer 
in BRCA1 carriers diagnosed at very young ages. However, little is published on 
the risk of TP53 carriers. 397 women with breast cancer diagnosed <36 years of 
age were obtained from three sources: (i) a population-based study of 283 women 
diagnosed sequentially from 1980-1997 in North-West England, (ii) referrals to 
the Genomic Medicine Department at St Mary's Hospital from 1990-2018, and (iii) 
individuals from (i) and the Family History Clinic at Wythenshawe Hospital South 
Manchester who tested negative for pathogenic variants (PV) in all three genes. 
Sequencing of BRCA1, BRCA2, and TP53 genes was carried out alongside tests for 
copy number for PV on all referred women. Rates of contralateral breast cancer 
were censored at death, last assessment, or risk-reducing mastectomy. In total, 
47 TP53, 218 BRCA1, and 132 BRCA2 PV carriers were identified with breast cancer 
diagnosed aged 35 years and under, as well as a representative sample of 261 not 
known to carry a PV in BRCA1, BRCA2, and TP53. Annual rates of contralateral 
breast cancer (and percentage of synchronous breast cancers) were TP53: 7.03% 
(4.3%), BRCA1: 3.57% (1.8%), and BRCA2: 2.63% (1.5%). In non-PV carriers, 
contralateral rates in isolated presumed/tested non-carrier cases with no family 
history were 0.56%, and for those with a family history, 0.69%. Contralateral 
breast cancer rates are substantial in TP53, BRCA1, and BRCA2 PV carriers 
diagnosed with breast cancer aged 35 and under. Women need to be advised to help 
make informed decisions on contralateral mastectomy, guided by life expectancy 
from their index tumor.

The impacts of hurricane-related disasters in agricultural communities include 
extensive losses of fields, orchards, and livestock, the recovery of which could 
span many years. Agricultural Extension Agents (EAs) try to manage and mitigate 
these losses, while simultaneously overseeing emergency shelter operations. 
These non-professional emergency responders face numerous potential stressors, 
the outcomes of which are minimally known. This study examined the short- and 
long-term medical and behavioral outcome of 36 University of Florida 
Agricultural Extension Agents within two months and one year after Hurricane 
Irma, Florida, USA, taking into consideration personal/home and work-related 
hurricane impacts. Regression analyses indicated that combined home and work 
hurricane impacts were associated with greater anxiety, depression, and medical 
symptoms controlling for age and number of prior hurricane experiences within 
two months of landfall. One year later, depression symptoms increased as well as 
the use of negative disengagement coping strategies for which stability of the 
work environment was protective. The findings suggest that advanced training in 
emergency response, organization and time management skills, time off and 
temporary replacement for personally impacted EAs, and workplace stability, 
including enhanced continuity of operations plans, represent critical elements 
of health prevention and early intervention for this occupational group.

The increase in life expectancy during the 20th century ranks as one of 
society's greatest achievements, with massive growth in the numbers and 
proportion of the elderly, virtually occurring in every country of the world. 
The burden of chronic diseases is one of the main consequences of this 
phenomenon, severely hampering the quality of life of elderly people and 
challenging the efficiency and sustainability of healthcare systems. 
Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are considered a global emergency responsible 
for over 70% of deaths worldwide. NCDs are also the basis for complex and 
multifactorial diseases such as hypertension, diabetes, and obesity. The 
epidemics of NCDs are a consequence of a complex interaction between health, 
economic growth, and development. This interaction includes the individual 
genome, the microbiome, the metabolome, the immune status, and environmental 
factors such as nutritional and chemical exposure. To counteract NCDs, it is 
therefore essential to develop an innovative, personalized, preventative, early 
care model through the integration of different molecular profiles of 
individuals to identify both the critical biomarkers of NCD susceptibility and 
to discover novel therapeutic targets.

Limited energy resources of sensor nodes in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) make 
energy consumption the most significant problem in practice. This paper proposes 
a novel, dynamic, self-organizing Hesitant Fuzzy Entropy-based Opportunistic 
Clustering and data fusion Scheme (HFECS) in order to overcome the energy 
consumption and network lifetime bottlenecks. The asynchronous working-sleeping 
cycle of sensor nodes could be exploited to make an opportunistic connection 
between sensor nodes in heterogeneous clustering. HFECS incorporates two levels 
of hierarchy in the network and energy heterogeneity is characterized using 
three levels of energy in sensor nodes. HFECS gathers local sensory data from 
sensor nodes and utilizes multi-attribute decision modeling and the entropy 
weight coefficient method for cluster formation and the cluster head election 
procedure. After cluster formation, HFECS uses the same techniques for 
performing data fusion at the first hierarchical level to reduce the redundant 
information flow from the first-second hierarchical levels, which can lead to an 
improvement in energy consumption, better utilization of bandwidth and extension 
of network lifetime. Our simulation results reveal that HFECS outperforms the 
existing benchmark schemes of heterogeneous clustering for larger network sizes 
in terms of half-life period, stability period, average residual energy, network 
lifetime, and packet delivery ratio.

Colorectal cancer is a type of gastrointestinal malignancy originating from 
either the colon or rectum. In this short report we provide a concise update on 
recent colorectal cancer statistics, especially concerning frequency, mortality, 
life expectancy and risk factors. Overall, colorectal cancer is the third more 
frequent malignant disease around the world (1.85 million of new cases/years; 
10.2% of total malignancies), with 2.27% cumulative risk of onset between 0-74 
years. The age-standardized rate increases by over 10-fold before the age of 50 
up to ≥85 years, whilst men have ~50% enhanced risk compared to women (the 0-74 
years risk is 2.75% in men and 1.83% in women, respectively). Although 
colorectal cancer screening has contributed to slightly reduce the number of 
diagnoses at advanced stages, most cases are only identified after symptoms 
onset. The number of worldwide deaths for colorectal cancer has been estimated 
at 0.88 million in 2018, representing ~1.4% of all-cause and ~8.9% of 
cancer-related deaths, with over 30% increase occurred during the past 15 years 
and a further 25% growth expected by the year 2030. The cumulative risk of dying 
for colorectal cancer is 0.92% between 0-74 years (1.14% in men and 0.72% in 
women, respectively). The 5-year cumulative survival is 64-67%, being 89-90% in 
patients with localized cancer, 70-71% in those with regional cancer, decreasing 
to 14-15% in those with distant cancer. The leading risk factors include 
familial history, pre-cancerous conditions, tall stature, physical inactivity, 
overweight, large intake of alcoholic beverages, high consumption of red or 
processed meat, as well as modest intake of dairy products and foods containing 
wholegrains or dietary fibre. The association between colorectal cancer and 
human development index suggests that reinforcement or timely establishment of 
preventive measures and accurate screening programs may be advisable, especially 
in countries undergoing considerable societal and economic changes.

Osteoporosis is an epidemic in the developed world. Fracture is a major burden 
associated with osteoporosis. Surgical management is recommended for particular 
anatomical areas, whilst other fracture patterns have a less defined and 
controversial role for surgery. This review aims to highlight increase in the 
global burden of osteoporosis and subsequent fragility fractures. As health and 
life expectancy improves, osteoporotic fracture fixation will constitute a 
significant physical and economic burden. The surgical management of 
osteoporotic fractures involves awareness on all levels from government to the 
individual, from primary prevention of fracture to surgical aftercare in the 
community.

Ocrelizumab is indicated for relapsing remitting and primary progressive 
multiple sclerosis (RRMS and PPMS, respectively). In an appraisal undertaken by 
the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), the company Roche 
presented the evidence for ocrelizumab used in patients with PPMS, which came 
from one single randomised controlled trial (RCT) comparing ocrelizumab versus 
placebo. Based on results from this trial, the licensed indication was 
restricted to patients with early PPMS in terms of disease duration and level of 
disability, and with imaging features characteristic of inflammatory activity. 
Overall, the Evidence Review Group (ERG) found that the RCT had a low risk of 
bias. In the post-hoc defined magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) active subgroup, 
matching the label indication, the risk of confirmed disability progression 
sustained for 12 weeks (CDP-12) was significantly delayed in the ocrelizumab 
group compared to placebo. However, considering the same risk with progression 
sustained for 24 weeks (CDP-24), which was deemed the most clinically relevant, 
the benefit from ocrelizumab did not reach statistical significance. In the same 
MRI active subgroup, benefits from ocrelizumab on functional outcomes and on 
health-related quality of life were not clearly demonstrated. A de novo Markov 
model was used to estimate the cost-effectiveness of ocrelizumab versus best 
supportive care (BSC) for treating patients with PPMS. Health states were 
defined by the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), ranging from 0 to 9. 
Disability progression was based on the MSBase natural history cohort that 
exhibited disease progression in the absence of disease-modifying therapy. 
Treatment with ocrelizumab delayed disability progression, with evidence of its 
clinical effectiveness obtained from the RCT. The economic analysis was 
undertaken from the National Health Service and Personal Social Services 
perspective, and the outcomes were reported in terms of life years gained and 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), with the overall results reported in terms 
of an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), expressed as cost per QALY 
gained over a 50-year time horizon. Both costs and effects were discounted at 
3.5% per annum. The company undertook deterministic one-way sensitivity analyses 
and scenario analyses, including probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA). The 
ERG raised several concerns, which were discussed at the appraisal committee 
meetings, resulting in the committee's preferences being applied and a revised 
economic analysis from the company. Under an approved patient access scheme with 
appraisal committee preferences applied, analyses yielded an ICER of 
approximately £78,300 per QALY. Sensitivity analysis results indicated that the 
treatment effect on CDP-12 had the greatest impact. Results for the PSA showed 
that at a willingness-to-pay threshold of £30,000 per QALY gained, ocrelizumab 
versus BSC had a zero probability of being cost-effective. Following new 
analyses submitted by the company, with a revised confidential patient access 
scheme, NICE recommended ocrelizumab in the treatment of early PPMS in adults 
with imaging features characteristic of inflammatory activity.

BACKGROUND: Monitoring of superficial mycoses requires more attention due to 
their important incidence, health costs and antifungal drugs consumption.
OBJECTIVES: The objectives were to estimate the burden of superficial mycoses in 
Belgium and to assess trends in associated antifungal consumption.
METHODS: The burden of dermatophytoses (including onychomycosis), as well as 
skin and genital candidiasis, was estimated using disability-adjusted life years 
(DALY). Moreover, trends in systemic and topical antifungal consumption in 
ambulatory care were examined for the period 2010-2017, together with their 
associated costs.
RESULTS: Due to their high incidence and long treatment duration, 
dermatophytoses represented the bulk of the burden, accounting for 92.2% of the 
total DALYs of superficial mycoses. Terbinafine was the most prescribed 
antifungal in terms of doses (35.4% of the total doses) while fluconazole was 
the most delivered drug in terms of packages (29.1% of the total packages). More 
than 70% of the prescriptions were made by general practitioners while 
consumption varied according to age and gender of the patients. A global 12% 
decrease in antifungal prescriptions was observed between 2011 and 2017. 
However, this reduction would result mainly from packaging changes and increased 
self-medication. A significant decrease in itraconazole treatments was notably 
compensated by an increased prescription of fluconazole packages.
CONCLUSION: This study emphasises that dermatological presentations of 
superficial mycoses are the most important in terms of both burden and 
antifungal consumption in Belgium. Further reduction in antifungals use can be 
achieved by applying the adequate treatment after identification of the 
causative agent.

BACKGROUND: Advances in life expectancy have led to an increase in the number of 
elderly people with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Scarce information is 
available on the outcomes of kidney transplantation (KT) in extremely elderly 
patients based on an allocation policy prioritizing donor-recipient age 
matching.
METHODS: We included recipients ≥75 years that underwent KT from similarly aged 
deceased donors at our institution between 2002 and 2015. Determinants of 
death-censored graft and patient survival were assessed by Cox regression.
RESULTS: We included 138 recipients with a median follow-up of 38.8 months. 
Median (interquartile range) age of recipients and donors was 77.5 (76.3-79.7) 
and 77.0 years (74.7-79.0), with 22.5% of donors ≥80 years. Primary graft 
non-function occurred in 8.0% (11/138) of patients. Cumulative incidence rates 
for post-transplant infection and biopsy-proven acute rejection (BPAR) were 
70.3% (97/138) and 15.2% (21/138), respectively. One- and 5-year patient 
survival were 82.1 and 60.1%, respectively, whereas the corresponding rates for 
death-censored graft survival were 95.6 and 93.1%. Infection was the leading 
cause of death (46.0% of fatal cases). The occurrence of BPAR was associated 
with lower 1-year patient survival [hazard ratio (HR) = 4.21, 95% confidence 
interval (CI) 1.64-10.82; P = 0.003]. Diabetic nephropathy was the only factor 
predicting 5-year death-censored graft survival (HR = 4.82, 95% CI 1.08-21.56; 
P = 0.040).
CONCLUSIONS: ESRD patients ≥75 years can access KT and remain dialysis free for 
their remaining lifespan by using grafts from extremely aged deceased donors, 
yielding encouraging results in terms of recipient and graft survival.

INTRODUCTION: The objective of our study was to present model-based estimates 
and projections on current and future health and economic impacts of cerebral 
palsy in Canada over a 20-year time horizon (2011-2031).
METHODS: We used Statistics Canada's Population Health Model 
(POHEM)-Neurological to simulate individuals' disease states, risk factors and 
health determinants and to describe and project health outcomes, including 
disease incidence, prevalence, life expectancy, health-adjusted life expectancy, 
health-related quality of life and health care costs over the life cycle of 
Canadians. Cerebral palsy cases were identified from British Columbia's health 
administrative data sources. A population-based cohort was then used to generate 
the incidence and mortality rates, enabling the projection of future incidence 
and mortality rates. A utility-based measure (Health Utilities Index Mark 3) was 
also included in the model to reflect various states of functional health to 
allow projections of health-related quality of life. Finally, we estimated 
caregiving parameters and health care costs from Canadian national surveys and 
health administrative data and included them as model parameters to assess the 
health and economic impact of cerebral palsy.
RESULTS: Although the overall crude incidence rate of cerebral palsy is 
projected to remain stable, newly diagnosed cases of cerebral palsy will rise 
from approximately 1800 in 2011 to nearly 2200 in 2031. In addition, the number 
of people with the condition is expected to increase from more than 75 000 in 
2011 to more than 94 000 in 2031. Direct health care costs in constant 2010 
Canadian dollars were about $11 700 for children with cerebral palsy aged 1-4 
years versus about $600 for those without the condition. In addition, people 
with cerebral palsy tend to have longer periods in poorer health-related quality 
of life.
CONCLUSION: Individuals with cerebral palsy will continue to face challenges 
related to an ongoing need for specialized medical care and a rising need for 
supportive services. Our study offers important insights into future costs and 
impacts associated with cerebral palsy and provides valuable information that 
could be used to develop targeted health programs and strategies for Canadians 
living with this condition.
