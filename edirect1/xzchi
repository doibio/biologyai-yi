BACKGROUND: The study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of hydrotherapy versus 
land-based therapy in patients with musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) in 
Singapore.
METHODS: A decision-analytic model was constructed to compare the 
cost-effectiveness of hydrotherapy to land-based therapy over 3 months from 
societal perspective. Target population comprised patients with low back pain 
(LBP), osteoarthritis (OA), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), total hip replacement 
(THR) and total knee replacement (TKR). Subgroup analyses were carried out to 
determine the cost-effectiveness of hydrotherapy in individual MSDs. Relative 
treatment effects were obtained through a systematic review of published data.
RESULTS: Compared to land-based therapy, hydrotherapy was associated with an 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of SGD 27 471 per quality-adjusted 
life-year (QALY) gained, which was below the willingness-to-pay threshold of SGD 
70 000 per QALY (one gross domestic product per capita in Singapore in 2015). 
For the respective MSDs, hydrotherapy were dominant (more effective and less 
costly) in THR and TKR, cost-effective for LBP and RA, and not cost-effective 
for OA. Treatment adherence and cost of hydrotherapy were key drivers to the 
ICER values.
CONCLUSIONS: Hydrotherapy was a cost-effective rehabilitation compared to 
land-based therapy for a population with MSDs in Singapore. However, the benefit 
of hydrotherapy was not observed in patients with OA.

OBJECTIVE:  This article aims to investigate the effect of a decrease in the 
A-frame angle of incline on the highest carpal extension angle in agility dogs.
METHODS:  Kinematic gait analysis (two-dimensional) measuring carpal extension 
was performed on 40 dogs entering the A-frame at 3 angles of incline: 40° 
(standard), 35° and 30°. The highest carpal extension angle from three trials at 
each incline was examined for a significant effect of A-frame angle with height, 
body weight and velocity included as covariates.
RESULTS:  There was no significant effect of A-frame angle on the highest carpal 
joint extension angle for the first or second limb. The adjusted mean carpal 
extension angle for the first limb at 40° was 64° [95% confidence interval (CI), 
60-68), at 35° was 61° (95% CI, 57-65) and at 30° was 62° (95% CI, 59-65). The 
raw mean carpal extension angle for all dogs across all A-frame angles for the 
first limb was 62° (95% CI, 60-64) and the second limb was 61° (95% CI, 59-63).
CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE:  Decreasing the A-frame angle of incline from 40° to 30° 
did not result in reduced carpal extension angles. The failure to find a 
difference and the narrow CI of the carpal angles may indicate that the 
physiologic limits of carpal extension were reached at all A-frame angles.

The trans-venous implantable cardioverter defibrillator (TV-ICD) is effective in 
treating life-threatening ventricular arrhythmia and reduces mortality in 
high-risk patients. However, there are significant short- and long-term 
complications that are associated with intravascular leads. These shortcomings 
are mostly relevant in young patients with long life expectancy and low risk of 
death from non-arrhythmic causes. Drawbacks of trans-venous leads recently led 
to the development of the entirely subcutaneous implantable cardioverter 
defibrillator (S-ICD). The S-ICD does not require vascular access or permanent 
intravascular defibrillation leads. Therefore, it is expected to overcome many 
complications associated with conventional ICDs. This review highlights data on 
safety and efficacy of the S-ICD and is envisioned to help in identifying the 
role of this device in clinical practice.

BACKGROUND: The zoonotic parasite Taenia solium is endemic in Angónia district, 
Tete province, Mozambique, though the burden of the disease complex is unknown.
METHODS: As part of two cross-sectional studies on human and porcine 
cysticercosis in the area, unique epidemiological and cost data were collected 
in Angónia district, Mozambique in 2007. These data provided the basis for the 
assessment of the societal cost of T. solium in the district, which estimates 
the impact of the disease on human and pig populations and includes both health 
and economic approaches in the analysis.
RESULTS: Approximately 0.7% (95% Uncertainty Interval (UI), 0.4-0.9) and 0.4% 
(95% UI, 0.2-0.6) of the total population in the district was estimated to 
suffer from neurocysticercosis (NCC)-associated epilepsy and headache. The 
estimated average number of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) due to 
NCC-associated epilepsy and headache was 6 (95% UI, 4-8) per thousand persons 
per year. The total annual costs due to T. solium cysticercosis were estimated 
at 90,000 USD (95% UI, 39,483-201,463) of which 72% (95% UI, 45-91) were costs 
linked to human cysticercosis and 28% (95% UI, 9.5-55) to pig production losses. 
The annual economic burden per NCC-associated epilepsy case in the district 
amounted to 33 USD (95% UI, 10-76).
CONCLUSIONS: In this highly endemic area of Mozambique a large number of 
individuals suffer from symptoms associated with NCC. Healthy years of life are 
lost and people are left living with disabilities. Infected pork poses a serious 
risk to the community and affects the economy of smallholder farmers. Cost for 
treatment and hospitalization of patients with NCC-associated epilepsy, and lack 
of productivity and inability of suffering patients to work, further hinder 
socioeconomic development. Feasible solutions framed within a country specific 
algorithm and stepwise approaches are needed to control the parasite in the 
country.

OBJECTIVE: To compare ticagrelor and prasugrel with clopidogrel for recurrent 
fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction (reMI) in real-life conditions.
METHODS: Case-referent study using the Pharmacoepidemiological General Research 
eXtension (PGRx)-acute coronary syndrome (ACS) registry. Cases were patients 
with reMI from a cohort with index ACS or external to the cohort (same sites). 
Referents from the cohort, without recurrent event, were matched on index ACS 
type and date, age and sex with reMI cases. Multivariate conditional logistic 
regression assessed the OR (95% CI) for reMI associated with ticagrelor and 
prasugrel vs clopidogrel, adjusted for aspirin use and cardiovascular risk 
factors.
RESULTS: 1047 cases and 2234 matched referents were included. Compared with 
clopidogrel, ticagrelor and prasugrel were associated with respective ORs of 
0.65 (95% CI 0.52 to 0.81) and 0.71 (95% CI 0.53 to 0.96) for reMI occurrence. 
ORs for ticagrelor and prasugrel vs clopidogrel were: 0.50 (95% CI 0.38 to 0.67) 
and 0.66 (95% CI 0.45 to 0.95), 0.39 (95% CI 0.24 to 0.62) and 0.44 (95% CI 0.26 
to 0.75), 0.63 (95% CI 0.43 to 0.92) and 1.20 (95% CI 0.69 to 2.07), 1.11 (95% 
CI 0.72 to 1.72) and 0.82 (95% CI 0.44 to 1.54) when index ACS was a first MI, a 
first ST-elevated MI (STEMI), a first non-STEMI and a recurrent ACS, 
respectively, and 0.63 (95% CI 0.45 to 0.87) and 0.77 (95% CI 0.41 to 1.45) for 
patients aged ≥70  years.
CONCLUSIONS: This real-world study showed a significant reduction of reMI with 
new antiplatelets compared with clopidogrel, ticagrelor being associated with a 
greater decrease of risk notably for first, either STEMI or non-STEMI. The 
larger magnitude of effect may be attributed to potential residual confounding 
or higher effectiveness compared with efficacy reported in trials (EMA Post 
Authorisation Study Registry Number EUPAS5905).

OBJECTIVES: (1) A comprehensive mortality assessment of alcoholic cardiomyopathy 
(ACM) and (2) examination of under-reporting using vital statistics data.
METHODS: A modelling study estimated sex-specific mortality rates for each 
country, which were subsequently aggregated by region and globally. Input data 
on ACM mortality were obtained from death registries for n=91 countries. For 
n=99 countries, mortality estimates were predicted using aggregate alcohol data 
from WHO publications. Descriptive additional analyses illustrated the scope of 
under-reporting.
RESULTS: In 2015, there were an estimated 25 997 (95% CI 17 385 to 49 096) 
global deaths from ACM. This translates into 6.3% (95% CI 4.2% to 11.9%) of all 
global deaths from cardiomyopathy being caused by alcohol. There were large 
regional variations with regard to mortality burden. While the majority of ACM 
deaths were found in Russia (19 749 deaths, 76.0% of all ACM deaths), for about 
one-third of countries (n=57) less than one ACM death was found. Under-reporting 
was identified for nearly every second country with civil registration data. 
Overall, two out of three global ACM deaths might be misclassified.
CONCLUSIONS: The variation of ACM mortality burden is greater than for other 
alcohol-attributable diseases, and partly may be the result of stigma and lack 
of detection. Misclassification of ACM fatalities is a systematic phenomenon, 
which may be caused by low resources, lacking standards and stigma associated 
with alcohol-use disorders. Clinical management may be improved by including 
routine alcohol assessments. This could contribute to decrease 
misclassifications and to provide the best available treatment for affected 
patients.

IMPORTANCE: Health care spending in the United States is a major concern and is 
higher than in other high-income countries, but there is little evidence that 
efforts to reform US health care delivery have had a meaningful influence on 
controlling health care spending and costs.
OBJECTIVE: To compare potential drivers of spending, such as structural capacity 
and utilization, in the United States with those of 10 of the highest-income 
countries (United Kingdom, Canada, Germany, Australia, Japan, Sweden, France, 
the Netherlands, Switzerland, and Denmark) to gain insight into what the United 
States can learn from these nations.
EVIDENCE: Analysis of data primarily from 2013-2016 from key international 
organizations including the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and 
Development (OECD), comparing underlying differences in structural features, 
types of health care and social spending, and performance between the United 
States and 10 high-income countries. When data were not available for a given 
country or more accurate country-level estimates were available from sources 
other than the OECD, country-specific data sources were used.
FINDINGS: In 2016, the US spent 17.8% of its gross domestic product on health 
care, and spending in the other countries ranged from 9.6% (Australia) to 12.4% 
(Switzerland). The proportion of the population with health insurance was 90% in 
the US, lower than the other countries (range, 99%-100%), and the US had the 
highest proportion of private health insurance (55.3%). For some determinants of 
health such as smoking, the US ranked second lowest of the countries (11.4% of 
the US population ≥15 years smokes daily; mean of all 11 countries, 16.6%), but 
the US had the highest percentage of adults who were overweight or obese at 
70.1% (range for other countries, 23.8%-63.4%; mean of all 11 countries, 55.6%). 
Life expectancy in the US was the lowest of the 11 countries at 78.8 years 
(range for other countries, 80.7-83.9 years; mean of all 11 countries, 81.7 
years), and infant mortality was the highest (5.8 deaths per 1000 live births in 
the US; 3.6 per 1000 for all 11 countries). The US did not differ substantially 
from the other countries in physician workforce (2.6 physicians per 1000; 43% 
primary care physicians), or nursing workforce (11.1 nurses per 1000). The US 
had comparable numbers of hospital beds (2.8 per 1000) but higher utilization of 
magnetic resonance imaging (118 per 1000) and computed tomography (245 per 1000) 
vs other countries. The US had similar rates of utilization (US discharges per 
100 000 were 192 for acute myocardial infarction, 365 for pneumonia, 230 for 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; procedures per 100 000 were 204 for hip 
replacement, 226 for knee replacement, and 79 for coronary artery bypass graft 
surgery). Administrative costs of care (activities relating to planning, 
regulating, and managing health systems and services) accounted for 8% in the US 
vs a range of 1% to 3% in the other countries. For pharmaceutical costs, 
spending per capita was $1443 in the US vs a range of $466 to $939 in other 
countries. Salaries of physicians and nurses were higher in the US; for example, 
generalist physicians salaries were $218 173 in the US compared with a range of 
$86 607 to $154 126 in the other countries.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The United States spent approximately twice as much 
as other high-income countries on medical care, yet utilization rates in the 
United States were largely similar to those in other nations. Prices of labor 
and goods, including pharmaceuticals, and administrative costs appeared to be 
the major drivers of the difference in overall cost between the United States 
and other high-income countries. As patients, physicians, policy makers, and 
legislators actively debate the future of the US health system, data such as 
these are needed to inform policy decisions.

BACKGROUND: Due to the rising incidence of penile cancer and increasing life 
expectancy in western nations, the current international guidelines recommend a 
less aggressive surgical approach with reduced safety margins and preferably 
with organ preservation.
OBJECTIVES: The goal of this review is to review the current data on 
stage-dependent reconstructive surgical techniques and their oncological and 
functional results.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Five recently published reviews and several single 
studies and publications on the topic of organ-sparing surgical techniques and 
penile reconstruction were evaluated to draw conclusions for surgery in penile 
cancer.
RESULTS: Due to the rare incidence of penile cancer and the absence of 
comparative, prospective studies in the literature, evidence levels of the 
actual statements and conclusions are low.
CONCLUSIONS: Organ-sparing techniques in penile cancer lead to slightly elevated 
local recurrence rates compared with traditional partial or total penile 
amputation. Thus, sufficient patient compliance is mandatory and an intensified 
follow-up for more than the usual 5 years postoperatively is required. On the 
other hand, these techniques enable the surgeon to offer improved functional and 
esthetic outcomes to the patient, maintaining erectile capacity and sensitivity. 
After extended partial or total penile amputation, penile reconstruction using 
free radial forearm flaps with later prosthetic implantation may be offered to 
younger and sexually active patients in cooperation with experienced plastic 
surgeons, even if the previously published case numbers do not permit 
standardization of these procedures.

OBJECTIVE: To compare of clinical effects of different surgical methods in the 
treatment of elderly femoral neck fractures.
METHODS: From January 2013 to June 2016, 144 elderly patients with femoral neck 
were treated and divided into artificial hip replacement group and cannulated 
screw fixation group according to the surgical methods. In the total hip 
arthroplasty group, there were 89 cases, 28 males and 61 females, with an 
average age of(84.10±3.10) years old;Hollow nail fixation group 55 cases, 20 
males and 35 females, with an average age of (86.80±2.88) years. Preoperative 
patients data, postoperative complications, mortality and postoperative Harris 
hip score were compared between the two groups.
RESULTS: A total of 144 cases were followed up for 12 to 36 months with an 
average of 18 months. There was no significant difference between two groups in 
gender, fracture side, preoperative complications, osteoporosis, ASA score, 
injury to surgery interval, the number of patients admitted to ICU and 
perioperative death. However, the patients in hollow screw fixation group was 
older than the joint replacement group(t=5.311, P<0.05);The degree of 
preoperative fracture displacement in the joint replacement group was higher 
than that in the hollow nail fixation group(χ²=6.894, P=0.009<0.05);Hollow nail 
fixation group in operation time, hospital stay, intraoperative blood loss, 
perioperative blood transfusion was significantly better than the number of 
joint replacement group(P<0.05);The Harris score of the joint replacement group 
was higher than that of the hollow screw fixation group(P<0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: For elderly femoral neck patients, if there is a significant shift 
in the fracture (Garden III, IV), the preferred treatment is hip replacement. 
Postoperative complications are relatively small, satisfactory joint function 
recovery. If the fracture displacement is not obvious (Garden type I, II) or 
patients with more medical diseases, poor physical condition, poor surgical 
tolerance, postoperative life expectancy is not high, the first choice is closed 
reduction and cannulated screw fixation.

BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to present our evaluation of the 
cost-effectiveness of salvage therapies for patients with recurrent head and 
neck cancer.
METHODS: A Markov model was developed with 5 salvage treatment strategies: (1) 
platinum-based chemotherapy alone; (2) chemotherapy plus cetuximab; (3) 
stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) alone; (4) SBRT plus cetuximab; and (5) 
intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) plus chemotherapy. Clinical parameters 
were obtained from comprehensive literature review and 2016 Medicare 
reimbursement. Strategies were compared using the incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio (ICER), with effectiveness in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and 
evaluated with a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of $100 000 per QALY gained.
RESULTS: In the base case analysis, no treatment strategy was cost-effective at 
a WTP threshold. The most cost-effective therapy was SBRT alone with $150 866 
per QALY gained. If median survival of SBRT alone was ≥11 months, SBRT was 
considered to be cost-effective.
CONCLUSION: None of the treatment strategies were cost-effective. However, 
SBRT-based reirradiation has potential to be cost-effective.

[The restoration of hand functions after irreparable injury of the radial 
nerve].

[Article in Polish]

Deskur Z, Deskur A.

INTRODUCTION: The aim of our study was to evaluate the methods used and results 
achieved for the restoration of function of the hands in patients with 
irreparable injury to the radial nerve.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We studied the type and number of methods used for the 
restoration of mobility function of the hands by tendon transfer of active 
muscle to affected muscle. Moreover, we implemented rehabilitation treatment in 
patients with irreparable injury to the radial nerve. Descriptions of the 
treatment were presented in 6 scientific reports published between 1996 and 
2015. The available literature presents the results of the treatment of 129 
patients with irreparable injury to the radial nerve.
RESULTS: The restoration activities of patients’ hand function was most 
frequently done by tendon transfer, i.e. the pronator teres muscle on the 
extensor carpi radialis brevis in 100 (72.5%) patients, the palmaris longus 
muscle on the extensor pollicis longus in 88 (68.2%) patients, and the flexor 
carpii ulnaris muscle on the extensor digitorum communis in 99 (76.7%) patients. 
During the pre- and postoperative period rehabilitation treatment played a 
crucial role in the restoration of patients’ hand functions.
CONCLUSION: All patients regained a complete or almost complete extension of the 
wrist and fingers. The strength of the hands was generally satisfactory. The 
dexterity of the hands in the majority of the studied patients was very good or 
good.

Interactions between the body and the environment occur within the peripersonal 
space (PPS), the space immediately surrounding the body. The PPS is encoded by 
multisensory (audio-tactile, visual-tactile) neurons that possess receptive 
fields (RFs) anchored on the body and restricted in depth. The extension in 
depth of PPS neurons' RFs has been documented to change dynamically as a 
function of the velocity of incoming stimuli, but the underlying neural 
mechanisms are still unknown. Here, by integrating a psychophysical approach 
with neural network modeling, we propose a mechanistic explanation behind this 
inherent dynamic property of PPS. We psychophysically mapped the size of 
participant's peri-face and peri-trunk space as a function of the velocity of 
task-irrelevant approaching auditory stimuli. Findings indicated that the 
peri-trunk space was larger than the peri-face space, and, importantly, as for 
the neurophysiological delineation of RFs, both of these representations 
enlarged as the velocity of incoming sound increased. We propose a neural 
network model to mechanistically interpret these findings: the network includes 
reciprocal connections between unisensory areas and higher order multisensory 
neurons, and it implements neural adaptation to persistent stimulation as a 
mechanism sensitive to stimulus velocity. The network was capable of replicating 
the behavioral observations of PPS size remapping and relates behavioral proxies 
of PPS size to neurophysiological measures of multisensory neurons' RF size. We 
propose that a biologically plausible neural adaptation mechanism embedded 
within the network encoding for PPS can be responsible for the dynamic 
alterations in PPS size as a function of the velocity of incoming stimuli. NEW & 
NOTEWORTHY Interactions between body and environment occur within the 
peripersonal space (PPS). PPS neurons are highly dynamic, adapting online as a 
function of body-object interactions. The mechanistic underpinning PPS dynamic 
properties are unexplained. We demonstrate with a psychophysical approach that 
PPS enlarges as incoming stimulus velocity increases, efficiently preventing 
contacts with faster approaching objects. We present a neurocomputational model 
of multisensory PPS implementing neural adaptation to persistent stimulation to 
propose a neurophysiological mechanism underlying this effect.

A Randomized Phase 2 Study of ADXS11-001 Listeria monocytogenes-Listeriolysin O 
Immunotherapy With or Without Cisplatin in Treatment of Advanced Cervical 
Cancer.

Basu P, Mehta A, Jain M, Gupta S, Nagarkar RV, John S, Petit R.

OBJECTIVES: A global unmet medical need exists for effective treatments for 
persistent, recurrent, or metastatic cervical cancer, as patients have a short 
life expectancy. Recently, immunotherapies have shown promising survival 
benefits for patients with advanced forms of cancer. Axalimogene filolisbac 
(ADXS11-001), a Listeria monocytogenes immunotherapy with a broad effect on the 
immune system, is under investigation for treatment of human 
papillomavirus-associated cancers including cervical cancer.
METHODS: This phase 2 study evaluated the safety and efficacy of ADXS11-001, 
administered with or without cisplatin, in patients with recurrent/refractory 
cervical cancer following prior chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy. A total of 109 
patients were treated, and 69 were evaluable for tumor response at equal to or 
more than 3 months postbaseline.
RESULTS: Median overall survival (OS) was comparable between treatment groups 
(ADXS11-001: 8.28 months; 95% confidence interval [CI], 5.85-10.5 months; 
ADXS11-001 + cisplatin: 8.78 months; 95% CI, 7.4-13.3 months). The 12- and 
18-month milestone OS rates were 30.9% versus 38.9%, and 23.6% versus 25.9% for 
each group, respectively (34.9% and 24.8% combined). Median progression-free 
survival (6.10 vs 6.08 months) and the overall response rate (17.1% vs 14.7%) 
were similar for both groups. ADXS11-001 was generally well tolerated; adverse 
events were predominantly mild to moderate in severity and not related to 
treatment. More adverse events were reported in the combination group (429 vs 
275).
CONCLUSIONS: These promising safety and efficacy results, including the 
encouraging 12-month 34.9% combined OS rate, warrant further investigation of 
ADXS11-001 for treatment of recurrent/refractory cervical cancer.

BACKGROUND: Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) may help cigarette smokers quit 
smoking, yet they may also facilitate cigarette smoking for never-smokers. We 
quantify the balance of health benefits and harms associated with e-cigarette 
use at the population level.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: Monte Carlo stochastic simulation model. Model parameters 
were drawn from census counts, national health and tobacco use surveys, and 
published literature. We calculate the expected years of life gained or lost 
from the impact of e-cigarette use on smoking cessation among current smokers 
and transition to long-term cigarette smoking among never smokers for the 2014 
US population cohort.
RESULTS: The model estimated that 2,070 additional current cigarette smoking 
adults aged 25-69 (95% CI: -42,900 to 46,200) would quit smoking in 2015 and 
remain continually abstinent from smoking for ≥7 years through the use of 
e-cigarettes in 2014. The model also estimated 168,000 additional 
never-cigarette smoking adolescents aged 12-17 and young adults aged 18-29 (95% 
CI: 114,000 to 229,000), would initiate cigarette smoking in 2015 and eventually 
become daily cigarette smokers at age 35-39 through the use of e-cigarettes in 
2014. Overall, the model estimated that e-cigarette use in 2014 would lead to 
1,510,000 years of life lost (95% CI: 920,000 to 2,160,000), assuming an 
optimistic 95% relative harm reduction of e-cigarette use compared to cigarette 
smoking. As the relative harm reduction decreased, the model estimated a greater 
number of years of life lost. For example, the model estimated-1,550,000 years 
of life lost (95% CI: -2,200,000 to -980,000) assuming an approximately 75% 
relative harm reduction and -1,600,000 years of life lost (95% CI: -2,290,000 to 
-1,030,000) assuming an approximately 50% relative harm reduction.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on the existing scientific evidence related to e-cigarettes 
and optimistic assumptions about the relative harm of e-cigarette use compared 
to cigarette smoking, e-cigarette use currently represents more population-level 
harm than benefit. Effective national, state, and local efforts are needed to 
reduce e-cigarette use among youth and young adults if e-cigarettes are to 
confer a net population-level benefit in the future.

BACKGROUND: Comparative research on health outcomes in North and South Korea 
offers a unique opportunity to explore political and social determinants of 
health. We examined the age- and cause-specific contributions to the life 
expectancy (LE) gap between the two Koreas.
METHODS: We calculated the LE at birth in 1993 and 2008 among North and South 
Koreans, and cause-specific contributions to the LE discrepancy between the two 
Koreas in 2008. The cause-specific mortality data from South Korea were used as 
proxies for the cause-specific mortality data in North Korea in 2008.
RESULTS: The LE gap between the two Koreas was approximately 1 year in 1993, but 
grew to approximately 10 years in 2008. This discrepancy was attributable to 
increased gaps in mortality among children younger than 1 year and adults 55 
years of age or older. The major causes of the increased LE gap were circulatory 
diseases, digestive diseases, infant mortality, external causes, cancers and 
infectious diseases.
CONCLUSIONS: This study underscores the urgency of South Korean and 
international humanitarian aid programs to reduce the mortality rate of the 
North Korean people.

BACKGROUND: Physical inactivity is a global problem that increases the risk of 
many chronic diseases and shortens life expectancy. The built environment 
contributes to physical inactivity through accessibility of amenities and 
transportation patterns. With better urban planning, cities could be designed to 
enhance active transportation and population health on a permanent basis.
PURPOSE: We conducted a systematic review to identify determinants of the built 
environment associated with physical activity and to evaluate how changes in the 
built environment are associated with changes in physical activity.
METHODS: We searched six databases, from the inception of each until December 
2015, for studies that were written in English, used longitudinal 
before-and-after design and assessed changes in both the built environment and 
physical activity. A total of 21 prospective cohort studies and 30 natural 
experiments were included in the review.
RESULTS: The review showed that changes in the built environment and in physical 
activity were related. A higher objective accessibility and new infrastructure 
for walking, cycling and public transportation were associated with increased 
overall and transportation-related physical activity. Some evidence was found 
for perceived aesthetics and safety as determinants of physical activity.
CONCLUSIONS: Improved objectively measured accessibility of different type of 
destinations and public transportation and land use mix were associated with 
increased physical activity. Creating new infrastructure for walking, cycling 
and public transportation could induce demand for walking and cycling. The 
results support the creation of compact and diverse residential areas and 
investments into infrastructure that encourage active modes of transportation.

This study compares the adult survivorship profiles of people interred in the 
Saint-Thomas d'Aizier leprosarium, estimated by cementochronology, to eight 
archaeological series in northern France dated from Late Antiquity to the Late 
Middle Ages, periods of significant visibility for Hansen's disease (leprosy). 
The goals are to understand the impact of leprosy on various social groups and 
to explore the cause of leprosy's decline by analyzing male and female 
fertility. Survival rates differed between medieval leprosy-free sites and the 
Saint-Thomas d'Aizier leprosarium, although this difference was statistically 
significant only for the female leprosarium sample. The selective female 
frailty, a consequence of social exclusion and the collapse of the quality of 
life, combined with the infertility of lepromatous couples, offer a multi-causal 
explanation to the end of the expansion and then decline of leprosy in southern 
and western European countries.
