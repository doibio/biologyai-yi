be more similar with his family caregiver than with a random family caregiver.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients, FCGs and nurses indicate to be prepared to engage in 
family participation. Further research needs to concentrate on the different 
attitudes and perceptions towards performing care tasks through qualitative 
research and how a successful implementation can be set up.
IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Our study indicates that implementation of family 
participation in physical care within the hospital could be viable.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study protocol was approved by the ethical committee of 
the Ghent University Hospital (B670201940430).

BACKGROUND: The following study investigated the 30-day and 5-year relative 
survival rate and freedom from neurological events in asymptomatic carotid 
stenosis (ACS) octogenarians who had undergone elective carotid endarterectomy 
(CEA).
METHODS: Between January 2008 and June 2014, a retrospective review was 
conducted on ACS patients who had undergone elective CEA. The patients' sample 
was divided into two groups: Group A (GA) included octogenarians and Group B 
(GB) included younger patients. The GA patients were subjected to a risk-scoring 
system and follow-up. The two groups were compared analysing the following 
primary endpoints: 30-day mortality, stroke, stroke/death and acute myocardial 
infarction (AMI); GA patients' survival rate and freedom from neurological 
events at 5 years. The 30-day secondary endpoints included carotid shunting, 
redo surgical, need for general anaesthesia with preserved consciousness (GAPC) 
conversion and length of hospital stay.
RESULTS: We identified 620 patients with ACS, of them 144 (23.2%) belonged to 
the GA and 476 (76.8%) belonged to the GB. No statistical difference between the 
two groups was found regarding the primary and secondary endpoints. One hundred 
nineteen of 144 GA patients (82.6%) underwent the follow-up; the median 
follow-up was 78.3 months. The GA patients' 5-year survival rate was 62%, while 
freedom from cerebral events was 94.9%. Analysis regarding GA patients' 5-year 
survival rate revealed a significantly lower percentage among the patients with 
a severe risk score compared with those with a moderate risk score 
(respectively, 29.5% vs 67.7%; p = .005). The multivariate analysis showed that 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) 
were independently associated with lower survival.
CONCLUSIONS: The 30-day outcomes of CEA in octogenarians are comparable to those 
in younger patients. Comprehensive life expectancy and preoperative score, 
rather than age alone, should be taken into account before performing CEA on 
octogenarian patients, considering the short- and long-term efficacy in stroke 
prevention.

BACKGROUND: Awareness of the value of aquatic exercise (AE) in the postoperative 
rehabilitation has increased, and several inherent advantages of AE, such as 
adjustment of both resistance and muscle strengthening parameters makes good 
rationale for its inclusion in postoperative rehabilitation. This study aimed to 
determine and compare the benefits of AE and land-based exercise (LBE) on pain, 
functionality, and quality of life after arthroscopic partial meniscectomy 
(APM).
METHODS: This randomized controlled study included 30 middle-aged (35-50), 
physically active patients who were randomized into LBE (n = 15) and AE (n = 15) 
groups after APM for a degenerative meniscal tear. Visual analogue scale (VAS), 
Short Form-36 (SF-36), single-leg hop test and Lysholm questionnaire scores in 
addition to isokinetic muscle strength values were evaluated at baseline, at 
fourth week immediately after cessation of exercise program and at eighth week 
follow-up visits. The exercise sessions were conducted in 1-h sessions per day, 
three days a week for a total of four weeks.
RESULTS: Significant improvement was observed in the VAS, single-leg hop test, 
Lysholm questionnaire, and most of SF-36 subscale scores in both groups at both 
fourth and eighth follow-ups. Isokinetic dynamometer revealed significant 
improvement in the peak torque values for extension at angular velocities of 60° 
and 180° at both follow-ups in the AE group. LBE group showed significant 
improvement in the peak torque value for extension only at an angular velocity 
of 60° only at fourth week follow-up. There was no significant difference 
between groups for any of these parameters at any of the follow-ups.
CONCLUSION: Both AE and LBE programs had significantly improved pain, function, 
isokinetic muscle strength, and quality of life in patients after APM. Either 
type of exercise is essential as part of the rehabilitation protocol for good 
clinical outcomes after APM and should not be neglected (level II).

Objective　Japan's shortage in labor force due to a declining birth rate and 
aging population has led to the rapid development of various systems and work 
environments to promote the employment of older adults. With increasing 
expectations for the active participation of older adults in the labor market, 
it is necessary to clarify the relationship between work and physical and mental 
health in this population, as well as the challenges they face. In particular, 
self-rated health is an important health indicator that captures the overall 
health status of older adults, which is strongly related to the decline in life 
functions and the increase in healthy life expectancy. In this study, we 
examined the longitudinal association between work and self-rated health 
perception among older adults.Methods　A literature search was conducted using 
PubMed, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and the Japana Centra Revuo Medicina (Igaku Chuo 
Zasshi in Japanese). The keywords selected for the search were "older adult," 
"employment," and "self-rated health." The inclusion criteria were i) the 
baseline age of study subjects was 60 years or older, ii) employment was used as 
an independent variable and self-rated health was used as a dependent variable, 
and iii) studies were longitudinal. The quality of the selected literature was 
assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS).Results　As a result of the 
review, a total of five studies were accepted. Four studies were from Japan and 
one was from the United States. The NOS scores showed that all selected studies 
were of high quality, scoring 6 or 7 on a 9-point scale. Three of the five 
studies reported that older adults who were working had higher self-rated health 
than those who were not working. Two of the five studies reported no significant 
association between employment and self-rated health among older 
adults.Conclusion　This systematic review suggested a significant relationship 
between work and self-rated health among older adults. However, the number of 
studies that focused on the longitudinal effect of employment was limited. 
Employment in later life is becoming increasingly common, therefore further 
evidence on its effect on health should be gathered.

Studies have suggested sex-related survival differences in chronic 
thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH). Whether long-term prognosis 
differs between men and women following pulmonary endarterectomy for CTEPH 
remains unclear. We investigated sex-specific survival after pulmonary 
endarterectomy for CTEPH. We included all patients who underwent pulmonary 
endarterectomy for CTEPH at two Scandinavian centers and obtained baseline 
characteristics and vital statuses from patient charts and national health-data 
registers. Propensity scores and weighting were used to account for baseline 
differences. Flexible parametric survival models were employed to estimate the 
association between sex and all-cause mortality and the absolute survival 
differences. The expected survival in an age-, sex-, and year of surgery matched 
general population was obtained from the Human Mortality Database, and the 
relative survival was used to estimate cause-specific mortality. A total of 444 
patients were included, comprising 260 (59%) men and 184 (41%) women. Unadjusted 
30-day mortality was 4.2% in men versus 9.8% in women (p = 0.020). In weighted 
analyses, long-term survival did not differ significantly in women compared with 
men (hazard ratio: 1.36; 95% confidence interval: 0.89-2.06). Relative survival 
at 15 years conditional on 30-day survival was 94% (79%-107%) in men versus 75% 
(59%-88%) in women. In patients who underwent pulmonary endarterectomy for 
CTEPH, early mortality was higher in women compared with men. After adjustment 
for differences in baseline characteristics, female sex was not associated with 
long-term survival. However, relative survival analyses suggested that the 
observed survival in men was close to the expected survival in the matched 
general population, whereas survival in women deviated notably from the matched 
general population.

Biodegradable paper cups coated with rice bran wax and whey protein isolate were 
designed to package popcorn. Coatings with different concentrations of whey 
protein isolate (5.5, 7.75, and 10% w/v) and rice bran wax (0.2, 0.4, and 0.6% 
w/v) were applied on the outer surface of the paper cups. Thickness, color 
changes, Young's modulus and tensile strength, water vapor transmission rate 
(WVTR) of the coated and uncoated cups, and also popcorns properties (pH, 
texture, and sensory properties) were evaluated. Water vapor transmission rate, 
Young's modulus, thickness, total color change index, and tensile strength of 
coated cups with the optimal coating formulation was 19.785 (g/m2 day), 11.810 
(MPa), 276.583 (µm), 1.839, and 11.222 (MPa), respectively. The results showed 
that paper cup coating increased thickness and yellowness and reduced the 
brightness, Young's modulus, and WVTR. Coating had a positive effect on the pH 
and texture of popcorns packaged in coated cups than samples packed in uncoated 
cups (p < .05). With increasing storage time due to moisture absorption, popcorn 
changes from crisp to viscoelastic and increases tissue firmness (p < .05). 
Popcorns' taste in uncoated cups had gained significantly lower scores by 
panelists compared with the samples packed in coated cups. There was a 
significant decrease in the general acceptance of popcorn during storage and 
also the type of coating used in the packaging cup (p < .05). Storage time and 
type of coating showed no significant effect on the moisture content, odor, and 
appearance of popcorn. In sensory evaluation, the coated packaging increased the 
taste, no difference in odor and appearance, and increased the overall 
acceptance of popcorn compared to the sample in uncoated cups. In general, the 
results showed that paper cup coating could be a new approach for barrier 
property improvement in paper-based food packaging and extending the shelf life 
of the products.

Fanconi anemia (FA) is a disease that could be accompanied by multiple 
abnormalities, such as growth retardation, bone marrow abnormalities, and cancer 
susceptibility. Among the FA patients, head and neck squamous cell cancer 
(HNSCC) is the most observed solid cancer. The life expectancy of patients with 
FA has increased with recent medical advances. Furthermore, HNSCC is diagnosed 
in 3% of FA patients, and half of these patients die because of their HNSCC. The 
median age of HNSCC patients with FA is 31, and according to the literature 
HNSCC incidence of FA, patients is more than 700-fold of the normal population. 
Here, we reported the treatment details and challenges we faced during 
hypopharyngeal cancer treatment in a FA patient.

Objectives To compare the outcomes of bladder preservation therapy with early or 
deferred radical cystectomy (RC) in high-grade non-muscle invasive bladder 
cancer. Methods Prospectively collected data were obtained for patients 
undergoing transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) at a tertiary care 
center between 2007 and 2018. Patients with a high-grade tumor (HGT1) were 
divided into three groups, depending on the treatment plan: conservative (GI), 
early RC (GII), or deferred RC (GIII). Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed to 
assess the cancer-specific survival (CSS). Results Seventy-one patients were 
included, and the patients had a median (range) age of 49 (32-72) years. The GI, 
GII, and GIII groups included 34 (47.9%), 14 (19.7%), and 23 (32.4%) patients, 
respectively. A significantly lower number of GII patients underwent >2 TURBTs 
(14.3% vs. 100%, p<0.001). Compared to GIII patients, GII patients had a shorter 
time to RC from the initial diagnosis (5.7 vs. 36.2 months, p=0.03). Ileal 
conduit and orthotropic bladder diversions were comparable between both groups, 
with significantly higher postoperative complications in GIII patients. The 
median (IQR) follow-up times for the groups were 84 (49-102), 82 (52-112), and 
73 (36-89) months, respectively. The five-year and 10-year CSS for GII and GIII 
patients was 79% vs. 75% and 78% vs. 64%, respectively (log rank=0.19). 
Conclusion Early RC should be considered an alternative treatment option in 
selected patients with HGT1 BC with expected longer life expectancy, which may 
significantly decrease postoperative complications and improve the CSS. However, 
selection bias in the current retrospective study may influence these outcomes.

Two aspects of the ageing process in Latin America should be specially taken 
into account in order to evaluate future perspectives of morbidity among the 
elderly in the region: 1) Cohorts who will compose the bulk of the elderly 
population in the 21st century in Latin America survived to old age largely 
because of improvements in medicine and to a much lesser extent to amelioration 
of living standards, as is the case in high income countries; 2) a high 
proportion of the Latin American population still live in poor economic 
conditions and even these vulnerable individuals continue to experience gains in 
(adult and older adult) survival. We aim to evaluate to what an extent recent 
levels of poverty and indigence among young children in Argentina could impact 
future levels of disability and demands for long-term care of older people. Our 
results show that given the levels of poverty and indigence in childhood 
observed between 1988 and 1994 and given the relationship between poor early 
conditions and the risk of being disabled among the elderly in Argentina, life 
expectancy with disability at age 60 old would increase substantially between 
2000 and 2040 both in absolute and relative terms.

OBJECTIVE: To broadly review the modern management of brain metastases.
BACKGROUND: Brain metastases are the commonest neurological manifestation of 
cancer and a major cause of morbidity in cancer patients. Brain metastases are 
increasing in frequency, as a result of longer life expectancy of cancer 
patients, more sensitive methods for brain metastasis detection and an ageing 
population. The proportional incidence of brain metastases according to cancer 
of origin, from greatest to least, is lung cancer, melanoma, renal, breast and 
colorectal cancers. Patients with lung cancer and melanoma are most likely to 
have brain metastases at diagnosis. Brain metastases cause a variety of 
symptoms, depending on their size and location, whether they cause mass effect 
and oedema, compression of the brain parenchyma, or focal neurological deficits. 
The major differential diagnoses of brain metastases include primary tumours and 
vascular/inflammatory lesions. Prognosis is dependent on the site, number and 
volume of lesions, the patients' performance status, age and the activity and 
extent of extracranial disease.
METHODS: English literature articles in PubMed from 1950 to June 2021 were 
reviewed. Article bibliographies provided further references.
CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of brain metastasis patients has moved from considering 
them as a homogenous population of patients, to individualised treatment. In 
those brain metastases patients of satisfactory performance status with a 
solitary lesion, especially one in a non-eloquent/accessible area causing 
significant mass effect and/or raised intracranial pressure or for whom the 
diagnosis is in doubt (histology needed), surgical resection is usually the 
treatment of choice. For multiple brain metastases, radiotherapy with or without 
systemic therapies are usually employed. For relatively fit patients with 
limited numbers of brain metastases (e.g., 4 or less), stereotactic radiosurgery 
is standard of care. Current clinical trials are testing the efficacy of 
stereotactic treatment alone for >4 brain metastases (although it is 
increasingly used for such patients in many centres) as well as integration of 
local therapies with targeted and immunological therapies in appropriately 
selected cases. In certain circumstances, cranial irradiation can be omitted.

enrollment of 100 patients (50 for each arm) with MBM ≥ 5, age ≥ 18 years, 
Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) ≥ 70, life expectancy > 3 months, known 
primary tumor, with controlled or controllable extracranial disease, baseline 
Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score ≥ 20/30, Barthel Activities of Daily 
Living score ≥ 90/100, to be submitted to SBI by LINAC with monoisocentric 
technique and non-coplanar arcs (experimental arm) or to WBI (control arm). The 
primary endpoints are neurocognitive performance, QoL and autonomy in daily-life 
activities variations, the first one assessed by MoCa Score and Hopkins Verbal 
Learning Test-Revised, the second one through the EORTC QLQ-C15-PAL and 
QLQ-BN-20 questionnaires, the third one through the Barthel Index, respectively. 
The secondary endpoints are time to intracranial failure, overall survival, 
retreatment rate, acute and late toxicities, changing of KPS. It will be 
considered significant a statistical difference of at least 30% between the two 
arms (statistical power of 80% with a significance level of 95%).
DISCUSSION: Several studies debate what is the decisive factor accountable for 
the development of neurocognitive decay among patients undergoing brain 
irradiation for MBM: radiation effect on clinically healthy brain tissue or 
intracranial tumor burden? The answer to this question may come from the recent 
technological advancement that allows, in a context of a significant time 
saving, improved patient comfort and minimizing radiation dose to off-target 
brain, a selective treatment of MBM simultaneously, otherwise attackable only by 
WBI. The achievement of a local control rate comparable to that obtained with 
WBI remains the fundamental prerequisite.

BACKGROUND: Cardiac arrest is a life-threatening cessation of activity in the 
heart. Early prediction of cardiac arrest is important, as it allows for the 
necessary measures to be taken to prevent or intervene during the onset. 
Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies and big data have been increasingly 
used to enhance the ability to predict and prepare for the patients at risk.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to explore the use of AI technology in predicting 
cardiac arrest as reported in the literature.
METHODS: A scoping review was conducted in line with the guidelines of the 
PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) 
extension for scoping reviews. Scopus, ScienceDirect, Embase, the Institute of 
Electrical and Electronics Engineers, and Google Scholar were searched to 
identify relevant studies. Backward reference list checks of the included 
studies were also conducted. Study selection and data extraction were 
independently conducted by 2 reviewers. Data extracted from the included studies 
were synthesized narratively.
RESULTS: Out of 697 citations retrieved, 41 studies were included in the review, 
and 6 were added after backward citation checking. The included studies reported 
the use of AI in the prediction of cardiac arrest. Of the 47 studies, we were 
able to classify the approaches taken by the studies into 3 different 
categories: 26 (55%) studies predicted cardiac arrest by analyzing specific 
parameters or variables of the patients, whereas 16 (34%) studies developed an 
AI-based warning system. The remaining 11% (5/47) of studies focused on 
distinguishing patients at high risk of cardiac arrest from patients who were 
not at risk. Two studies focused on the pediatric population, and the rest 
focused on adults (45/47, 96%). Most of the studies used data sets with a size 
of <10,000 samples (32/47, 68%). Machine learning models were the most prominent 
branch of AI used in the prediction of cardiac arrest in the studies (38/47, 
81%), and the most used algorithm was the neural network (23/47, 49%). K-fold 
cross-validation was the most used algorithm evaluation tool reported in the 
studies (24/47, 51%).
CONCLUSIONS: AI is extensively used to predict cardiac arrest in different 
patient settings. Technology is expected to play an integral role in improving 
cardiac medicine. There is a need for more reviews to learn the obstacles to the 
implementation of AI technologies in clinical settings. Moreover, research 
focusing on how to best provide clinicians with support to understand, adapt, 
and implement this technology in their practice is also necessary.

BACKGROUND: The number of deaths among people with coronavirus disease 2019 
(COVID-19) does not show the true impact of the disease on communities. 
Therefore, this study aimed to calculate years of life lost (YLL) due to 
premature death in patients with COVID-19.
METHODS: We performed a descriptive cross-sectional study based on data from one 
of the largest provinces of Iran, in the period 13 February 2020 to 17 May 2021. 
We used WHO proposed guidelines for the calculation of the burden of diseases to 
calculate the YLL among patients with COVID-19, taking into consideration gender 
in different age groups.
RESULTS: Findings showed that 13 628 deaths were due to COVID-19 with associated 
249 309 YLL. The study reported higher mortality among men (1222 cases) in the 
age group over 85 years than in women (840) of the same age group. The minimum 
number of YLL for men was 1749 in the 5-9 years age group and that for women was 
1551 years in the 14-10 years age group.
CONCLUSION: The high number of deaths due to COVID-19 has led to high YLL due to 
premature death. The provision of adequate health care and appropriate policies 
will bring about a decrease in YLL due to COVID-19.

SIRT1 and FOXO3 are both associated with longevity. Molecular biology research 
in many organisms (yeast, nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans, and mice 
mammalian models) shows SIRT1 acts on the FOXO family of forkhead transcription 
factors to respond to oxidative stress better, shifting processes away from cell 
death toward stress resistance. Human population studies need epidemiologic 
evidence. We used an open cohort of 3 166 community-dwelling participants in 
China with follow-up from 2008 to 2018. The mean age at baseline was 84.6 years. 
In 16 375 person-years of follow-up, there were 1 968 mortality events. SIRT1 
and FOXO3 exhibited Mendelian randomization as there was no correlation with 
each other and with baseline study population characteristics. Some SIRT1 and 
FOXO3 single-nucleotide polymorphisms showed protective effects for mortality 
risk. The FOXO3 protective effect was stronger in females, and the SIRT1 
protective effect was stronger in male study participants. We did not see 
evidence of a synergistic effect of being carriers of both SIRT1 and FOXO3 
advantageous alleles.

INTRODUCTION: The purpose was to quantify the health effects of tobacco using 
data from the 2019 Global Burden of Disease study.
AIMS AND METHODS: We collected detailed information on tobacco consumption 
overall as well as its individual aspects (smoking, secondhand smoke, and 
chewing tobacco) for the deaths and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) for 
all-cause disease, cardiovascular disease, neoplasms, and chronic respiratory 
diseases, and their age-standardized rates (ASRs).
RESULTS: Tobacco was responsible for 8.71 million deaths and 229.77 million 
DALYs globally in 2019. The ASRs of all tobacco-related deaths and DALYs 
declined from 1990 to 2019, to 108.55 deaths per 100 000 population and 2791.04 
DALYs per 100 000 population in 2019. During any year the ASRs of all 
tobacco-related deaths and DALYs were higher in males than in females. The ASRs 
of all tobacco-related deaths and DALYs were highest in countries with a 
low-middle sociodemographic index (SDI) and lowest in high-SDI countries in 
2019. Cardiovascular disease, neoplasms, and chronic respiratory diseases were 
the three leading causes of tobacco-related mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: Although the ASRs of deaths and DALYs related to tobacco have 
declined, the absolute number remain high. Tobacco control policies need to be 
strengthened further in order to reduce the heavy health burden of tobacco.
IMPLICATIONS: This study provides a detailed description on the health effects 
of tobacco, including maps of the current global burden of tobacco-related 
disease. Although the ASRs of tobacco-related deaths and DALYs have declined, 
the absolute numbers remain high-tobacco was responsible for 8.71 million deaths 
and 229.77 million DALYs globally in 2019. The findings may have implications 
for tobacco control. Countries where progress has been slower in reducing 
tobacco-related disease burden should study and consider implementing policies 
and strategies that have been applied in countries like Singapore which show the 
greatest declines for recent decades.

OBJECTIVE: Assess cost-effectiveness and -utility associated with posttransplant 
HCC surveillance compared to standard follow-up.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Despite lack of prospective clinical data, expert 
consensus recommends posttransplant surveillance to detect HCC recurrence in a 
latent phase, while it might be amenable to curative-intent therapy.
METHODS: A Markov-based transition model was created to estimate life expectancy 
and quality-of-life among liver transplant patients undergoing HCC surveillance. 
Models were built for 2 cohorts: 1 undergoing HCC surveillance with 
contrast-enhanced computed tomography of chest and abdomen and serum 
alpha-fetoprotein analysis and the other receiving standard posttransplant 
follow-up. Primary model outputs included LY and QALY gains, incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio, and incremental cost-utility ratio. Willingness-to-pay 
for a QALY gain (cost-effectiveness threshold) was used to estimate efficiency.
RESULTS: Surveillance was marginally more effective versus no surveillance, 
resulting in means of 0.069 LYs and 0.026 QALYs gained. Costs for surveillance 
were increased by an average of 988.32€, resulting in incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio 14,410.15€/LY and incremental cost-utility ratio 
37,547.97€/QALY. Surveillance did not seem cost-effective in our setting, 
considering willingness-to-pay threshold of 25,000€/QALY. Probabilistic 
sensitivity analysis indicated surveillance might be cost-effective in 42% of 
cases, but degree of uncertainty in the analysis was high.
CONCLUSIONS: Performing posttransplant HCC surveillance offers marginal clinical 
benefits and increases costs. Although expert consensus supports surveillance, 
results of this decision analysis raise doubt regarding the utility of such 
recommendations and support ongoing need for prospective clinical trials.

INTRODUCTION: Prevalence of chronic hepatitis C (CHC) is higher in patients born 
between 1955-1975. The aim was to perform an economic evaluation of an age-based 
electronic health record (EHR) alert in primary care to detect patients with 
undiagnosed CHC and its treatment in comparison with non-use of the alert 
system, in Valencian Community, Spain.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Decision trees and Markov model were used to evaluate the 
diagnosis and progression of the disease, respectively. CHC was diagnosed by 
serology and viral load in seropositive subjects. Epidemiological data and 
diagnostic costs were extracted from public sources of the Valencian Community. 
Probabilities, utilities and costs of model states were obtained from the 
literature. The impact on mortality and hepatic complications avoided by the 
implementation of the alert were estimated, and efficiency was measured as an 
incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR) based on quality-adjusted life years 
(QALYs) and the costs of both alternatives.
RESULTS: The EHR alert detected 269,548 patients, of whom 1,331 had CHC (vs. 23 
patients with non-alert). Over the patients' lifetime, the alert would prevent 
93% of decompensated cirrhosis cases, 87% of hepatocellular carcinomas, 90% of 
liver transplants, and 89% of liver related deaths compared to non-use of the 
alert system. In addition, it would obtain an additional 3.3 QALY per patient, 
with an incremental cost of €10,880 and an ICUR of €3,321.
CONCLUSIONS: The implementation of an age-based EHR alert in primary care to 
detect patients with CHC reduces hepatic complications and mortality and is an 
efficient strategy.

Cardiovascular diseases remain the leading cause of death worldwide in the last 
decade, accompanied by immense health and economic burdens. Heart failure (HF), 
as the terminal stage of many cardiovascular diseases, is a common, intractable, 
and costly medical condition. Despite significant improvements in pharmacologic 
and device therapies over the years, life expectancy for this disease remains 
poor. Current therapies have not reversed the trends in morbidity and mortality 
as expected. Thus, there is an urgent need for novel potential therapeutic 
agents. Although the pathophysiology of the failing heart is extraordinarily 
complex, targeting mitochondrial dysfunction can be an effective approach for 
potential treatment. Increasing evidence has shown that mitochondrial 
abnormalities, including altered metabolic substrate utilization, impaired 
mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), increased reactive oxygen 
species (ROS) formation, and aberrant mitochondrial dynamics, are closely 
related to HF. Here, we reviewed the findings on the role of mitochondrial 
dysfunction in HF, along with novel mitochondrial therapeutics and their 
pharmacological effects.

Excess mortality in people with schizophrenia has been extensively reported. 
However, little is known about the life expectancy and potential years of life 
lost (PYLL) in western China. This study aimed to estimated life expectancy and 
PYLL for people with schizophrenia in western China. A total of 228,572 people 
with schizophrenia were included from National Information System for Psychosis 
in one province of western China. Life-expectancy was calculated by using 
Chiang's method. One-way ANOVA was used to compare the age-sex standardized PYLL 
for different causes of death among different demographic characteristics 
groups. Life expectancy for men and women with schizophrenia was 52.8 years and 
59.0 years respectively. The overall PYLL of people with schizophrenia was 18.4 
years, and suicide had the largest PYLL (31.2 years) among all causes of 
mortality. The PYLL due to suicide was significantly higher among men, high 
school and above, non-poverty, non-farmer and divorced people with 
schizophrenia. The PYLL due to diseases and medical conditions was higher among 
men, illiteracy, farmer and unmarried people with schizophrenia. Strategies to 
prevent causes of premature death in schizophrenia are urgently required in 
western China, particularly in the promotion of physical health and prevention 
of suicide.
