Nosema ceranae is a new and emerging microsporidian parasite of European honey 
bees, Apis mellifera, that has been implicated in colony losses worldwide. RNA 
interference (RNAi), a posttranscriptional gene silencing mechanism, has emerged 
as a potent and specific strategy for controlling infections of parasites and 
pathogens in honey bees. While previous studies have focused on the silencing of 
parasite/pathogen virulence factors, we explore here the possibility of 
silencing a host factor as a mechanism for reducing parasite load. Specifically, 
we used an RNAi strategy to reduce the expression of a honey bee gene, naked 
cuticle (nkd), which is a negative regulator of host immune function. Our 
studies found that nkd mRNA levels in adult bees were upregulated by N. ceranae 
infection (and thus, the parasite may use this mechanism to suppress host immune 
function) and that ingestion of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) specific to nkd 
efficiently silenced its expression. Furthermore, we found that RNAi-mediated 
knockdown of nkd transcripts in Nosema-infected bees resulted in upregulation of 
the expression of several immune genes (Abaecin, Apidaecin, Defensin-1, and 
PGRP-S2), reduction of Nosema spore loads, and extension of honey bee life span. 
The results of our studies clearly indicate that silencing the host nkd gene can 
activate honey bee immune responses, suppress the reproduction of N. ceranae, 
and improve the overall health of honey bees. This study represents a novel 
host-derived therapeutic for honey bee disease treatment that merits further 
exploration.
IMPORTANCE: Given the critical role of honey bees in the pollination of 
agricultural crops, it is urgent to develop strategies to prevent the colony 
decline induced by the infection of parasites/pathogens. Targeting parasites and 
pathogens directly by RNAi has been proven to be useful for controlling 
infections in honey bees, but little is known about the disease impacts of RNAi 
silencing of host factors. Here, we demonstrate that knocking down the honey bee 
immune repressor-encoding nkd gene can suppress the reproduction of N. ceranae 
and improve the overall health of honey bees, which highlights the potential 
role of host-derived and RNAi-based therapeutics in controlling the infections 
in honey bees. The information obtained from this study will have positive 
implications for honey bee disease management practices.

to local air quality management policy and practice in Wales, UK.

BACKGROUND: Air pollution exposure reduces life expectancy. Air pollution, 
deprivation and poor-health status combinations can create increased and 
disproportionate disease burdens. Problems and solutions are rarely considered 
in a broad public health context, but doing so can add value to air quality 
management efforts by reducing air pollution risks, impacts and inequalities.
METHODS: An ecological study assessed small-area associations between air 
pollution (nitrogen dioxide and particulate matter), deprivation status and 
health outcomes in Wales, UK.
RESULTS: Air pollution concentrations were highest in 'most' deprived areas. 
When considered separately, deprivation-health associations were stronger than 
air pollution-health associations. Considered simultaneously, air pollution 
added to deprivation-health associations; interactions between air pollution and 
deprivation modified and strengthened associations with all-cause and 
respiratory disease mortality, especially in 'most' deprived areas where 
most-vulnerable people lived and where health needs were greatest.
CONCLUSION: There is a need to reduce air pollution-related risks for all. 
However, it is also the case that greater health gains can result from 
considering local air pollution problems and solutions in the context of wider 
health-determinants and acting on a better understanding of relationships. 
Informed and co-ordinated air pollution mitigation and public health action in 
high deprivation and pollution areas can reduce risks and inequalities. To 
achieve this, greater public health integration and collaboration in local air 
quality management policy and practice is needed.

BACKGROUND: To estimate the impact of smoking on quality-adjusted life years 
(QALY) for US adults aged 65 years and older.
METHODS: Using the 2003-08 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 
Linked Mortality File, we estimated the mean QALY throughout the remaining 
lifetime by participants' smoking status as well as smoking intensity and time 
since cessation.
RESULTS: Never, former and current smokers had a mean QALY of 16.1, 12.7 and 7.3 
years, respectively. Among current smokers, those who started smoking before age 
18 had fewer QALYs than those who started at or after age 18 (6.0 and 8.5 years, 
respectively) and those smoking ≥20 cigarettes per day had fewer QALYs than 
those smoking <20 cigarettes per day (6.6 and 8.1 years, respectively). QALYs 
also declined with a longer duration of smoking and a shorter time since 
cessation. The potential gains if a person quit smoking would be 5.4 QALYs, and 
the gains would increase with a longer time since quitting as well as quitting 
at a younger age.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated the dose-response effect of smoking status 
on QALY. The results indicate the health benefits of tobacco cessation at any 
age and sizeable losses for former or current smokers.

Attributes of the built environment can positively influence physical activity 
of urban populations, which results in health and economic benefits. In this 
study, we derived scenarios from the literature for the association built 
environment-physical activity and used a mathematical model to translate 
improvements in physical activity to health-adjusted life years and health care 
costs. We modelled 28 scenarios representing a diverse range of built 
environment attributes including density, diversity of land use, availability of 
destinations, distance to transit, design and neighbourhood walkability. Our 
results indicated potential health gains in 24 of the 28 modelled built 
environment attributes. Health care cost savings due to prevented physical 
activity-related diseases ranged between A$1300 to A$105,355 per 100,000 adults 
per year. On the other hand, additional health care costs of prolonged life 
years attributable to improvements in physical activity were nearly 50% higher 
than the estimated health care costs savings. Our results give an indication of 
the potential health benefits of investing in physical activity-friendly built 
environments.

After the liver and lungs, bones are the third most common sites of cancer 
metastasis. Palliative radiotherapy for secondary bone tumours helps relieve 
pain, improve the quality of life and reduce the risk of fractures. Stereotactic 
body radiotherapy can deliver high radiation doses with very tight margins, 
which has significant advantages when treating tumours close to the spinal cord. 
Strict quality control is essential as dose gradient at the edge of the spinal 
cord is important. Optimal schedule is not defined. A range of 
dose-fractionation schedules have been used. Pain relief and local control are 
seen in over 80%. Toxicity rates are low, although vertebral fracture may occur. 
Ongoing prospective studies will help clarify its role in the management of 
oligometastatic patients.

PURPOSE: The Proximal Ulna Dorsal Angulation (PUDA) is part of the proximal 
ulna's normal anatomy. The importance of restoring ulnar anatomy characteristics 
precisely after olecranon fracture is not known, however, failure to recreate 
the PUDA after surgery may result in poorer functional outcomes. The purpose of 
this study is to evaluate the impact of minimal proximal ulna malunion on elbow 
ROM and function at least one year after olecranon ORIF.
METHOD: A retrospective comparative cohort study took place in three level-1 
trauma centers. Forty-nine adult volunteers who underwent ORIF for olecranon 
fracture were included. Patients were separated into two groups according to 
PUDA malreduction-defined as more than 5° of difference between the fractured 
and the contralateral elbow.
OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Radiographic ROM measurement, demographic data and quality 
of life questionnaires were recorded (PREE, MEPS, Q-DASH, SF12, VAS).
RESULTS: The mean follow up was 3 years and 9 months (1-7 years). There was no 
difference in terms of outcome, quality of reduction or range of motion between 
patients treated with plate or tension band. The mean PUDA on the fracture side 
was different from the normal side (2.20 vs 4.90, p<0.001). Fourteen patients 
(29%) had PUDA malunion. Those patients had decreased elbow flexion (-7°, 
p=0.011), extension (-11.2°, p=0.013) and total ROM (-18.6°, p=0.006) as opposed 
to the control group. Both groups had comparable quality of life questionnaire 
scores. Alcohol consumption was the only risk factor associated with worse 
scores.
CONCLUSION: Incidence of olecranon malunion-as defined by PUDA measurement - was 
29% and it was associated with decreased elbow range of motion. Alcohol 
consumption was correlated with a worse prognosis in our series of patients. 
Tension band and plate fixation can maintain a good reduction in terms of PUDA 
and the choice of fixation method does not influence outcome.
LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: III Therapeutic study.

Increases in life expectancy and cardiovascular adverse events in patients with 
hypertension highlight the need for new risk-reduction strategies to reduce the 
burden of degenerative diseases. Among the environmental factors, high salt 
consumption is currently considered the most important risk factor of 
hypertension. However, while high salt intake significantly raises blood 
pressure in some individuals, others do not show variation or even decrease 
their blood pressure. This heterogeneity is respectively classified as salt 
sensitivity and salt resistance. In this review, we propose salt sensitivity as 
a useful phenotype to unravel the mechanistic complexity of primary 
hypertension. The individual variability in blood pressure modification in 
response to salt intake changes derives from the combination of genetic and 
environmental determinants. This combination of random and non random 
determinants leads to the development of a personal index of sensitivity to 
salt. However, those genes involved in susceptibility to salt are still not 
completely identified, and the triggering mechanisms underlying the following 
development of hypertension still remain uncovered. One reason might be 
represented by the absence of a specific protocol, universally followed, for a 
standard definition of salt sensitivity. Another reason may be linked to the 
absence of common criteria for patient recruitment during clinical studies. 
Thus, the generation of a reliable approach for a proper recognition of this 
personal index of sensitivity to salt, and through it the identification of 
novel therapeutic targets for primary hypertension, should be one of the 
aspirations for the scientific community.

BACKGROUND: Gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (GEP-NET) are often 
slow-growing and patients may live for years with metastasised disease. Hence, 
along with increasing overall and progression-free survival, treatments aim at 
preserving patients' well-being and health-related quality of life (HRQoL). 
However, studies on systematic HRQoL assessment in patients with GEP-NET are 
scarce. Therefore, the purpose of the current review is to systematically 
evaluate the methodological quality of the identified studies.
METHODS: A targeted database search was performed in PubMed, EMBASE, and 
CENTRAL. Data extraction was conducted by two independent researchers according 
to predefined criteria. For study evaluation, the Minimum Standard Checklist for 
Evaluating HRQoL Outcomes in Cancer Clinical Trials and the CONSORT 
Patient-Reported Outcome extension were adapted.
RESULTS: The database search yielded 48 eligible studies. We found the awareness 
for the need of HRQoL measurement to be growing and application of 
cancer-specific instruments gaining acceptance. Overall, studies were too 
heterogeneous in terms of patient characteristics and treatment interventions to 
draw clear conclusions for clinical practice. More importantly, a range of 
methodological shortcomings has been identified which were mainly related to the 
assessment and statistical analysis, as well as the reporting and interpretation 
of HRQoL data.
CONCLUSION: Despite an increasing interest in HRQoL in GEP-NET patients, there 
is still a lack of knowledge on this issue. A transfer of HRQoL results into 
clinical practice is hindered not only by the scarceness of studies, but also by 
the often limited quality of HRQoL processing and reporting.

INTRODUCTION: Lower-income Americans are suffering from declines in income, 
health, and longevity over time. Income and employment policies have been 
proposed as a potential non-medical solution to this problem.
METHODS: An interrupted time series analysis of state-level incremental 
supplements to the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) program was performed using 
data from 1993 to 2010 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System surveys and 
state-level life expectancy. The cost effectiveness of state EITC supplements 
was estimated using a microsimulation model, which was run in 2015.
RESULTS: Supplemental EITC programs increased health-related quality of life and 
longevity among the poor. The program costs about $7,786/quality-adjusted 
life-year gained (95% CI=$4,100, $13,400) for the average recipient. This ratio 
increases with larger family sizes, costing roughly $14,261 (95% CI=$8,735, 
$19,716) for a family of three.
CONCLUSIONS: State supplements to EITC appear to be highly cost effective, but 
randomized trials are needed to confirm these findings.

Aims To explore and describe perceptions and experiences of living with type 1 
Diabetes Mellitus among children/youths in Tajikistan. Methods Qualitative 
methods were employed. Participants were recruited through purposive and 
snowball samplings. Data were collected using a semi-structured interview guide 
with children/youths having diabetes, their parents as well as health 
professionals. Data were analyzed according to Malterud's systematic text 
condensation. Results Children/youths with diabetes (n = 18), their parents 
(n = 19) and endocrinologists (n = 4) were interviewed. Families described 
unique stories in which "emotional stress" and a spiritual "evil eye" were 
perceived as possible causes of diabetes. Life-threatening complications and 
maltreatment preceding diagnosis of diabetes were frequent. From manifestation 
of diabetes onwards, families struggled with systemic and cultural obstacles, 
causing stigma, discrimination, high school-drop-out rates, diabetic coma, 
chronic complications or death of the child/youth with diabetes. Conclusions 
Results of this qualitative study highlight the severity and complexity of 
challenges families living with a child/youth having diabetes in this low-income 
country face. Efforts to improve life expectancy and life quality are strongly 
needed and require addressing both systemic and cultural factors in order to 
accomplish sustainable impact.

The WHO Commission on the Social Determinants of Health set out an impressive 
collection of policy proposals on the social determinants of health. However, a 
serious weakness for securing implementation is the difficulty for policymakers 
in identifying priorities for action. The objective of this study is to 
determine a small set of the most influential determinants using existing data 
and an empirical approach. 45 Indicators from the World Bank's World Development 
Indicators are selected to measure attainment for the determinants proposed by 
the Commission. Panel data models of life expectancy at birth for 54 low-income 
countries over the years 1990-2012 (1188 country-years) are estimated. Each 
determinant is subjected to a robustness test using Extreme Bound Analysis, to 
determine the stability of its estimated impact on life expectancy. For 20 
robust and significant determinants the magnitude of association with life 
expectancy is determined. The largest average increases in life expectancy at 
14.5 months per capita is associated with a one standard deviation reduction in 
HIV prevalence among children, followed by advances in gender equality at 9.4 
months. Improvements in life expectancy between 6 and 9 months are associated 
with agricultural production, political stability, access to clean water and 
sanitation, good governance, and primary school enrolment. Improvements below 6 
months are associated with increases in private health expenditure and overseas 
development assistance, and control of armed conflict and HIV prevalence among 
men. There is no evidence that national income, public spending on healthcare 
and education, secondary schooling, terms of international trade, employment, 
debt service and relief, out-of-pocket expenditures, agricultural ex- or 
imports, lifestock production, foreign investment, urbanization or environmental 
degradation are robustly associated with population health. Results provide 
support for the relevance of some proposed policies. The findings can inform 
priorities for future research and policy action on the social determinants of 
health.

The overall median lifespan of domestic dogs has been estimated to 9-12 years, 
but little is known about risk factors for mortality in aged and a priori 
healthy dogs. The objective of this retrospective cohort study was to determine 
which characteristics are associated with mortality in aged and a priori healthy 
guide dogs, in a retrospective cohort study of 116 guide dogs followed from a 
systematic geriatric examination at the age of 8-10 years old. A geriatric grid 
collected the clinical data and usual biological parameters were measured at the 
time of examination. Univariate (Kaplan-Meier estimates) and multivariable (Cox 
proportional hazard model) survival analyses were used to assess the 
associations with time to all-cause death. The majority of dogs were Golden 
Retrievers (n=48) and Labrador Retrievers (n=27). Median age at geriatric 
examination was 8.9 years. A total of 76 dogs died during follow-up, leading to 
a median survival time from geriatric examination of 4.4 years. After adjustment 
for demographic and biological variables, an increased alanine amionotransferase 
level (adjusted Hazard Ratio (adjusted HR), 6.2; 95% confidence interval 
[95%CI], 2.0-19.0; P<0.01), presenting skin nodules (adjusted HR, 1.9; 95% CI, 
1.0-3.4; P=0.04), and not being a Labrador Retriever (adjusted HR, 3.3; 95%CI, 
1.4-10; P<0.01) were independently associated with a shorter time to death. This 
study documents independent associations of alanine aminotransferase level, skin 
nodules and breed with mortality in aged guide dogs. These results may be useful 
for preventive medical care when conducting a geriatric examination in working 
dogs.

PURPOSE: To investigate the second primary cancers (SPCs) in patients with 
urothelial cancer (UC).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The records of 2,339 patients whose UC was diagnosed 
between January 1974 and December 2012 were reviewed. All data about 
characteristics of patients, of UC and, of SPC was, recorded digitally. We 
investigated the prevalence and the type of second or higher order cancers, and 
the factors associated with SPC.
RESULTS: Total 260 patients (11.1%) had SPC, 14 had a third primary cancer and 
one had a fourth primary cancer. The most common SPC with UC was lung cancer 
(29.6%). Of all 260 with SPC, 64 (24.6%) had synchronous (within the 6 months) 
SPC, 120 (46.2%) had subsequent SPC and, 76 (29.2%) had antecedent SPC. The mean 
duration of SPC was 56 months in patients with subsequent SPC and 75.8 months in 
patients with antecedent SPC. The mean age at the time of diagnosis of UC was 
higher in patients with SPC. The ratio of male gender, body mass index, blood 
type, status of smoking and, occupational risk was similar in both groups. Total 
amount of smoking and the mean follow-up were higher in patients with SPC.
CONCLUSIONS: The majority of the patients with UC have long life expectancy. In 
patients with UC, the risk of having another cancer is quite higher than normal 
population. The physicians managing patients with UC should look for SPC.

BACKGROUND: While infants with trisomy 13 (T13) and trisomy 18 (T18) are known 
to die early, parents want to know more about life expectancy and quality of 
life.
METHODS: 30-year single-center retrospective chart analysis (1980-2010) of 
cytogenetically confirmed T13 and T18 cases. Mothers of infants who had lived 3 
months or longer were approached to judge their infant's quality of life and 
talk about their experiences with medical staff.
RESULTS: Data of 18/20 T13 infants and 18/21 T18 infants could be retrieved. 
Median survival times were 5 d for T13 and 19 d for T18. One T13 and 2T18 
children survived past 1 year. Out of 5 mothers whose infants had survived at 
least 3 months, 4 described their infant as friendly, happy and peaceful. They 
observed some degree of psychomotor development and were in favour of the 
numerous medical and surgical interventions performed. They wished to have had a 
doctor coordinating these interventions and missed an active offer for 
psychological help.
CONCLUSION: While most infants with T13 or T18 die as neonates, mothers of 
infants surviving longer periods of time have positive memories about their 
infants' quality of life.

In China, smoking is the leading preventable cause of deaths by a disease. 
Estimating the disease burden attributable to smoking contributes to an 
evaluation of the adverse impact of smoking. To aid in policy change and 
implementation, this study estimated the population-attributable fractions 
(PAFs) of smoking, the all-cause mortality and the loss of life expectancy 
attributable to smoking in 2014 of Qingdao. PAFs were calculated using the 
smoking impact ratio (SIR) or current smoking rate (P) and relative risk (RR). 
We determined the smoking-attributable mortality by multiplying the 
smoking-attributable fraction by the total mortality. This study used the method 
of an abridged life table to calculate the loss of life expectancy caused by 
smoking. Smoking caused about 8635 deaths (6883 males, 1752 females), and 
accounted for 16% of all deaths; 22% in males and 8% in females. The leading 
causes of deaths attributable to smoking were lung cancer (38%), ischemic heart 
disease (19%) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD, 12%). The PAF for 
all causes was 22%; 30% in males and 10% in females. Tobacco use may cause a 
reduction of about 2.01 years of the loss of life expectancy; 3 years in males 
and 0.87 years in females. The findings highlight the need for taking effective 
measures to prevent initiation and induce cessation.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the histopathological results after radical 
prostatectomy (RP) in patients that had normal preoperative multiparametric 
magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI), in order to determine whether they had 
significant or insignificant disease. Moreover, we evaluated the influence of 
the expertise of the radiologist on the results.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively included patients who underwent RP in 
our centre and who had a preoperative negative mpMRI. The MRIs were considered 
negative when no suspicious lesion was seen or when the Prostate Imaging 
Reporting and Data System version 1 score was <7. We used Pathological 
tumour-node-metastasis staging and Gleason score on pathology reports, and 
whole-mount sections to calculate tumour volume.
RESULTS: We identified 101 patients from 2009 to 2015. Final pathology showed 
that 16.9% had extraprostatic extension, 13.8% had primary Gleason pattern 4 (4 
+ 3 and above), 47.5% had secondary Gleason pattern 4 or 5, and 55.9% and 20.6% 
had a main tumour volume of ≥0.5 and ≥2 mL, respectively. When limiting the 
analysis to expert reading only, the numbers improved: only one patient (3.4%) 
had extraprostatic extension (P < 0.05), one patient (3.4%) had primary Gleason 
pattern 4 (P = 0.05), and 64.7% and 5.9% had a main tumour volume of ≥0.5 and ≥2 
mL, respectively (P = 0.01).
CONCLUSION: A negative MRI does not guarantee the absence of significant 
prostate cancer.

OBJECTIVE: Patients with malignant insulinoma always present with symptoms of 
severe hypoglycemia and have poor life expectancy. In addition, inoperable 
metastatic malignant insulinomas are very difficult to manage. The aim of this 
report is to present our successful experiences in diagnosis and treatment of 
this disease in 6 patients.
PATIENTS/METHODS: Six patients (male 2, female 4) with malignant insulinomas 
were admitted into our hospital. Their clinical histories, including clinical 
presentations, endocrine evaluations, radiological images, pathological 
examination and treatments, were reviewed.
RESULTS: The diagnosis of malignant insulinoma combined with liver metastases 
was confirmed in all patients by endocrine evaluation and radiological images. 
Patients 1-3 underwent surgical management. The primary and metastasized tumors 
were completely resected. After successful surgery, no hypoglycemia recurred. 
Patients 4-6 did not undergo surgery because of systemic disease and poor 
health. Instead, they were administrated with diazoxide 50 mg Three Times a Day 
(TID), with final doses up to 200-300 mg TID. These 3 patients had good 
responses to diazoxide administration. After treatment, the frequency and 
severity of hypoglycemia were improved significantly. All 6 patients had better 
life quality than previously expected.
CONCLUSION: Combination of surgical and medical approaches can improve life 
quality and prolong survival of patients with malignant insulinomas.

AIM: The Integrated Care in Early Psychosis (ACCESS III) Study examined the 
efficacy and cost-effectiveness of a combined intervention consisting of 
strategies to improve early detection and quality of care (integrated care 
including therapeutic assertive community treatment) in adolescents and young 
adults in the early phase of a severe psychotic disorder from 2011 to 2014.
METHODS: This is a prospective, single-centre, 1-year cohort study comparing an 
intervention condition (early detection plus integrated care, n = 120) to the 
historical control condition (standard care, SC, n = 105) for adolescents and 
young adults aged 12-29 years suffering from a severe, early-phase psychotic 
disorder (i.e. within 2 years of treatment).
RESULTS: Primary outcome is the rate of combined symptomatic (i.e. Positive and 
Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) criteria) and functional (i.e. Global Assessment 
of Functioning scale (GAF) ≥ 60 points criterion) remission over at least 
6 months at study endpoint. Secondary outcome comprises the comparison of the 
reduction in the duration of untreated psychosis within the 4-year study 
duration between integrated care and SC, course of psychopathology, functioning, 
quality of life, satisfaction with care, cost and quality-adjusted life years 
(QALYs) in comparison to a historical control group.
CONCLUSION: To the authors' knowledge, this is the first study assessing the 
efficacy and cost-effectiveness of a combined intervention consisting of early 
detection strategies and strategies to improve quality of care in both 
adolescents and young adults with early-phase psychosis. The results will be 
published in 2016.

Mounting evidence suggests that early-life conditions have an enduring effect on 
an individual's mortality risks as an adult. The contribution of improvements in 
early-life conditions to the overall decline in adult mortality, however, 
remains a debated issue. We provide an estimate of the contribution of 
improvements in early-life conditions to mortality decline after age 30 in Dutch 
cohorts born between 1812 and 1921. We used two proxies for early-life 
conditions: median height and early-childhood mortality. We estimate that 
improvements in early-life conditions contributed more than five years or about 
a third to the rise in women's life expectancy at age 30. Improvements in 
early-life conditions contributed almost three years or more than a quarter to 
the rise in men's life expectancy at age 30. Height appears to be the more 
important of the two proxies for early-life conditions.

benefits.

PURPOSE: The use of novel and often expensive drugs offering limited survival 
benefit in advanced disease is controversial. Treatment recommendations are 
influenced by patient characteristics and trial data showing overall response 
rates (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). PFS is 
frequently the primary outcome in licencing studies.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: As part of a longitudinal study Assessing the 'VALue' to 
patients of PROgression Free Survival (AVALPROFS), oncologists completed 
checklists at baseline following consultations with patients. Questions probed 
perceived clinical benefits of the drugs to populations in general. Patients 
completed study-specific interview schedules at baseline, 6 weeks into 
treatment, and at withdrawal due to toxicity or progression. Patients also 
completed tumour- and treatment-specific quality of life questionnaires monthly 
for their time in the study. Only baseline results are reported here.
RESULTS: Thirty-two UK oncologists discussed management options with 90 patients 
with heterogeneous advanced cancers. Oncologists' estimates of medical benefit 
in general from treatment varied between 10 and 80 %. They expected 46/90 (51 %) 
of their patients to derive some clinical benefit from the prescribed treatment 
but were either unsure or expected none for 44/90 (49 %). Predictions of life 
expectancy were variable but 62 % (56/90) of patients were expected to survive 
longer with treatment. A majority of patients 51/90 (57 %) had 'no idea' or were 
'unclear' what PFS meant and 45/90 (50 %) thought extension of life was the 
primary therapeutic aim of treatment.
CONCLUSION: Discussions between doctors and patients with metastatic disease 
about future management plans and likely therapeutic gains are challenging. 
Factors influencing decisions about putative benefits of novel drugs are often 
applied inconsistently can be overly optimistic and may even contradict 
published data.
