The current health care models described in GesEPOC indicate the best way to 
make a correct diagnosis, the categorization of patients, the appropriate 
selection of the therapeutic strategy and the management and prevention of 
exacerbations. In addition, COPD involves several aspects that are crucial in an 
integrated approach to the health care of these patients. The evaluation of 
comorbidities in COPD patients represents a healthcare challenge. As part of a 
comprehensive assessment, the presence of comorbidities related to the clinical 
presentation, to some diagnostic technique or to some COPD-related treatments 
should be studied. Likewise, interventions on healthy lifestyle habits, 
adherence to complex treatments, developing skills to recognize the signs and 
symptoms of exacerbation, knowing what to do to prevent them and treat them 
within the framework of a self-management plan are also necessary. Finally, 
palliative care is one of the pillars in the comprehensive treatment of the COPD 
patient, seeking to prevent or treat the symptoms of a disease, the side effects 
of treatment, and the physical, psychological and social problems of patients 
and their caregivers. Therefore, the main objective of this palliative care is 
not to prolong life expectancy, but to improve its quality. This chapter of 
GesEPOC 2021 presents an update on the most important comorbidities, 
self-management strategies, and palliative care in COPD, and includes a 
recommendation on the use of opioids for the treatment of refractory dyspnea in 
COPD.

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to explore the impact of including broader value 
elements in cost-effectiveness analyses by presenting 2 case studies, one on 
human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and one on early-stage Hodgkin's lymphoma 
(ESHL).
METHODS: We identified broader value elements (eg, patient and caregiver time, 
spillover health effects, productivity) from the Second Panel's Impact Inventory 
and the ISPOR Special Task Force's value flower. We then evaluated the 
cost-effectiveness of HPV vaccination versus no vaccination (case 1) and 
combined modality therapy (CMT) versus chemotherapy alone for treatment of adult 
ESHL (case 2) using published simulation models. For each case study, we 
compared incremental cost-effectiveness ratios considering health sector impacts 
only (the "base-case" scenario) with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios 
incorporating broader value elements.
RESULTS: For vaccination of US girls against HPV before sexual debut versus no 
vaccination, the base-case result was $38 334 per disability-adjusted life-year 
averted. Including each broader value element made cost-effectiveness 
progressively more favorable, with HPV vaccination becoming cost-saving (ie, 
reducing costs and averting more disability-adjusted life-years) when the 
analysis incorporated productivity costs. For CMT versus chemotherapy alone in 
patients with ESHL, the base-case result indicated that CMT was cost-saving. 
Including all elements made this treatment's net monetary benefits (the sum of 
its averted resource costs and the net value of its health impacts) less 
favorable, even as the contribution from CMT's near-term health benefits grew.
CONCLUSIONS: Including broader value elements can substantially influence 
cost-effectiveness ratios, although the direction and the magnitude of their 
impact can differ across interventions and disease context.

BACKGROUND: Changes over time in health state values from a societal perspective 
may be an important reason to consider updating societal value sets for 
preference-based measures of health.
OBJECTIVE: The aim was to examine whether stated health preferences are 
different between 2002 and 2017, controlling for demographic changes in the 
United States.
METHODS: Data from 2002 and 2017 US EQ-5D-3L valuation studies were combined. 
The primary analysis compared valuations of better-than-dead (BTD) states only, 
as both studies used the same time trade-off (TTO) method for these states. For 
worse-than-dead (WTD) states, the 2017 study used the lead-time TTO and the 2002 
study used the conventional TTO, which necessitated transformation. Regression 
models were fitted to BTD values to estimate time-specific differences, 
adjusting for respondent characteristics. Secondary analyses examined models 
that fitted WTD values (using linear and nonlinear transformations of the 2002 
data) and all values.
RESULTS: The adjusted BTD-only model showed mean values were higher for 2017 
compared with 2002 (βY2017=0.05, P<0.001). WTD-only models showed negative 
changes over time but that were dependent on the transformation method (linear 
βY2017=-0.72; nonlinear βY2017=-0.35; both P<0.001). Using all values, 2017 mean 
valuations were lower using a linear transformation (βY2017=-0.11; P<0.001) but 
did not differ with the nonlinear transformation.
CONCLUSIONS: Individuals in 2017 are generally less willing to trade quantity 
for quality of life compared with 2002. This study provides evidence of 
time-specific differences in a society's preferences, suggesting that the era in 
which values were elicited may be an important reason to consider updating 
societal value sets.

Severe viral infections of the skin can occur in patients with inborn errors of 
immunity (IEI). We report an all-in-one whole-transcriptome sequencing-based 
method by RNA-Seq on a single skin biopsy for concomitantly identifying the 
cutaneous virome and the underlying IEI. Skin biopsies were obtained from 
healthy and lesional skin from patients with cutaneous infections suspected to 
be of viral origin. RNA-Seq was utilized as the first-tier strategy for unbiased 
human genome-wide rare variant detection. Reads unaligned to the human genome 
were utilized for the exploration of 926 viruses in a viral genome catalog. In 9 
families studied, the patients carried pathogenic variants in 6 human IEI genes, 
including IL2RG, WAS, CIB1, STK4, GATA2, and DOCK8. Gene expression profiling 
also confirmed pathogenicity of the human variants and permitted genome-wide 
homozygosity mapping, which assisted in identification of candidate genes in 
consanguineous families. This automated, online, all-in-one computational 
pipeline, called VirPy, enables simultaneous detection of the viral triggers and 
the human genetic variants underlying skin lesions in patients with suspected 
IEI and viral dermatosis.

Tralokinumab in Atopic Dermatitis: A Profile of Its Use.

Zealand. demail@springer.com.

Tralokinumab (tralokinumab-ldrm) [Adbry™ (USA); Adtralza® (EU)], a human IgG4 
monoclonal antibody that binds specifically to interleukin (IL)-13, is an 
effective and generally well tolerated treatment option for adult patients with 
moderate to severe atopic dermatitis who are candidates for systemic therapy. In 
pivotal phase III trials, subcutaneous tralokinumab improved the clinical signs 
and symptoms of atopic dermatitis as well as quality of life (QOL). In ECZTRA 1 
and 2, tralokinumab monotherapy was superior to placebo in the first 16 weeks of 
treatment, with improvements in pruritus and sleep scores seen as early as 
week 1. Many patients who met the criteria for clinical response at week 16 
maintained this response at week 52. Tralokinumab was also more effective than 
placebo when used in combination with 'as needed' topical corticosteroids (TCS) 
in ECZTRA 3 and 7; most tralokinumab recipients used no or very little amounts 
of TCS. In an open-label extension trial, tralokinumab provided consistent 
symptom control over the longer term (up to 2 years). The majority of adverse 
events with tralokinumab, including injection-site reactions and conjunctivitis, 
were of mild to moderate severity. The tolerability profile of tralokinumab 
longer term was consistent with that in the phase III trials.

Plain Language Summary: Atopic dermatitis is an ongoing inflammatory skin 
condition that causes dryness, itching and redness. Standard first-line 
treatments include moisturizers and medical ointments that are applied directly 
to the skin. However, topical treatments often fail to adequately control 
symptoms in patients with moderate to severe disease. More recently, biological 
therapies have been developed that target the different inflammatory proteins 
involved in atopic dermatitis. Tralokinumab [Adbry™ (USA); Adtralza® (EU)] is a 
human monoclonal antibody that targets IL-13, a key protein involved in driving 
the signs and symptoms of atopic dermatitis. When given alone or together with 
topical corticosteroids, subcutaneous tralokinumab improves the signs and 
symptoms of atopic dermatitis in adults with moderate to severe disease and 
provides consistent long-term disease control. Patients treated with 
tralokinumab also report improvements in health-related quality of life. Adverse 
events seen with tralokinumab are generally mild or moderate in severity. Thus, 
subcutaneous tralokinumab offers a new effective and generally well-tolerated 
treatment option for adults with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis who 
require systemic therapy.

BACKGROUND: Surgical treatment of knee osteoarthritis (KOA) complicated by 
extra-articular deformity has always been controversial regardless of whether it 
is simultaneous or staged. Simultaneous total knee arthroplasty (TKA) combined 
with supracondylar osteotomy without plate for treatment of KOA complicated by 
femoral varus deformity has not been reported in the literature.
CASE SUMMARY: A 53-year-old Chinese woman complained of left knee pain for 6 
years that worsened for 4 mo during her visit on April 3, 2020, accompanied by 
instability in walking, which seriously affected quality of life. According to 
her medical history and preoperative imaging, the patient was diagnosed with 
left KOA with varus deformity. We used the angular center of rotation principle 
for osteotomy of the femur deformity and placed a poststabilized femur 
prosthesis into the knee joint. At the same time, a 13 mm × 130 mm femur 
extension rod was used instead of a steel plate to fix the end of the femur 
osteotomy, reducing the possible complications caused by steel plate 
implantation and reducing the economic burden on patients. The operation 
successfully solved two major problems of KOA and varus deformity, and the 
clinical and imaging evaluation of postoperative follow-up were satisfactory.
CONCLUSION: TKA and supracondylar femoral osteotomy can be used for simultaneous 
KOA treatment and deformity correction.

Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is seen as a region of mass migration and population 
displacement caused by poverty, violent conflict, and environmental stress. 
However, empirical evidence is inconclusive regarding how SSA's international 
migration progressed and reacted during its march to achieving the Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDGs). This article attempts to study the patterns and 
determinants of SSA's international migration and the cause and effects on 
sustainable development by developing a Sustainability Index and regression 
models. We find that international migration was primarily intra-SSA to 
low-income but high-population-density countries. Along with increased 
sustainability scores, international migration declined, but emigration rose. 
Climate extremes tend to affect migration and emigration but not universally. 
Dry extremes propelled migration, whereas wet extremes had an adverse effect. 
Hot extremes had an increasing effect but were insignificant. SSA's 
international migration was driven by food insecurity, low life expectancy, 
political instability and violence, high economic growth, unemployment, and 
urbanisation rates. The probability of emigration was mainly driven by high 
fertility. SSA's international migration promoted asylum seeking to Europe with 
the diversification of origin countries and a motive for economic wellbeing. 1% 
more migration flow or 1% higher probability of emigration led to a 0.2% 
increase in asylum seekers from SSA to Europe. Large-scale international 
migration and recurrent emigration constrained SSA's sustainable development in 
political stability, food security, and health, requiring adequate governance 
and institutions for better migration management and planning towards the SDGs.

Previous studies have demonstrated a correlation between longevity and brain 
size in a variety of taxa. Little research has been devoted to understanding 
this link in parrots; yet parrots are well-known for both their exceptionally 
long lives and cognitive complexity. We employed a large-scale comparative 
analysis that investigated the influence of brain size and life-history 
variables on longevity in parrots. Specifically, we addressed two hypotheses for 
evolutionary drivers of longevity: the cognitivebuffer hypothesis, which 
proposes that increased cognitive abilities enable longer lifespans, and the 
expensive brain hypothesis, which holds that increases in lifespan are caused by 
prolonged developmental time of, and increased parental investment in, 
large-brained offspring. We estimated life expectancy from detailed zoo records 
for 133 818 individuals across 244 parrot species. Using a principled Bayesian 
approach that addresses data uncertainty and imputation of missing values, we 
found a consistent correlation between relative brain size and life expectancy 
in parrots. This correlation was best explained by a direct effect of relative 
brain size. Notably, we found no effects of developmental time, clutch size or 
age at first reproduction. Our results suggest that selection for enhanced 
cognitive abilities in parrots has in turn promoted longer lifespans.

OBJECTIVE: Chronic liver disease continues to be a significant cause of 
morbidity and mortality yet remains challenging to prognosticate. This has been 
one of the barriers to implementing palliative care, particularly at an early 
stage. The Bristol Prognostic Score (BPS) was developed to identify patients 
with life expectancy less than 12 months and to act as a trigger for referral to 
palliative care services. This study retrospectively evaluated the BPS in a 
cohort of patients admitted to three Scottish hospitals.
METHOD: Routinely collated healthcare data were used to obtain demographics, BPS 
and analyse 1-year mortality for patients with decompensated liver disease 
admitted to three gastroenterology units over two 90-day periods. Statistical 
analysis was undertaken to assess performance of BPS in predicting mortality.
RESULTS: 276 patients were included in the final analysis. Participants tended 
to be late middle-aged men, socioeconomically deprived and have alcohol-related 
liver disease. A similar proportion was BPS+ve (>3) in this study compared with 
the original Bristol cohort though had more hospital admissions, higher ongoing 
alcohol use and poorer performance status. BPS performed poorer in this 
non-Bristol group with sensitivity 54.9% (72.2% in original study), specificity 
58% (83.8%) and positive predictive value (PPV) 43.4% (81.3%).
CONCLUSION: BPS was unable to accurately predict mortality in this Scottish 
cohort. This highlights the ongoing challenge of prognostication in patients 
with chronic liver disease, furthering the call for more work in this field.

INTRODUCTION: Early-onset scoliosis (EOS) may result in disability and a reduced 
life expectancy. The aim of this study was to report the results of primary 
magnetically controlled growing rods (MCGR) in a consecutive group of patients 
with EOS diagnosed and operated at Aalborg University Hospital, Denmark, from 
2009 and onwards and with at least two years of follow-up.
METHODS: Data were extracted from the electronic patient records and the Picture 
Archiving and Communication System. All data were extracted by an unbiased 
observer. Demographics, any complication and the Cobb angles and maximal 
kyphosis angles preoperatively and post-operatively were recorded. Likewise, the 
total expansion of the MCGR and the increase in T1-T12 and T1-S1 heights were 
recorded.
RESULTS: A total of 15 patients (three females) were followed for an average of 
3.75 years. The Cobb angles were corrected on average by 68% and the maximal 
kyphosis angle by 45%. The thoracic height increased significantly with only two 
patients (still undergoing expansions) with a T1-S1 height below 22 cm. Four 
complications were recorded (one deep infection and three non-functioning rods), 
all resulting in rod exchange. The complication rate was 27% or 0.07 per patient 
per year.
CONCLUSIONS: The MCGR may reduce the deformity and support thoracic and 
pulmonary growth without any need for repeated surgeries. The number of 
complications in the present series was low compared with the literature with an 
average of 0.07 complications per year per patient or a total complication rate 
of 27%.

PURPOSE: To evaluate the impact of corneal and conjunctival tumors on the ocular 
surface and quality of life of patients before and after surgical treatment.
METHODS: This prospective study conducted a preoperative and 30- and 90-day 
postoperative assessment of patients diagnosed with conjunctival and corneal 
tumors. Demographic data were collected preoperatively. The 12-Item Short-Form 
Health Survey (SF-12) and Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) questionnaires 
were applied to assess patients' quality of life and perception of their 
vision-related functions. The tear breakup time and Schirmer tests were 
performed for ocular surface evaluation. The tumor extensions were measured 
using ImageJ image analysis software.
RESULTS: Twenty-three patients were enrolled. The mean age at examination was 
52.8 ± 17.3 years (range: 27-9 years). The most common tumor type was squamous 
cell carcinoma (61.5%). The patients' visual acuity improved significantly at 1 
month and 3 months (p=0.018 and p=0.036, respectively). No significant 
differences were found between tear breakup time and Schirmer tests 
preoperatively and at 3 months postoperatively (p=0.150 and p=0.490, 
respectively). The SF-12 scores demonstrated significant differences between the 
preoperative and 30- and 90-day postoperative mental components (p=0.008 and 
p=0.026, respectively). Tumor extension was 868.7 ± 344.9 pixels (range, 
224.6-1481.6 pixels) and were significantly correlated with the preoperative 
(p=0.011), 30-day postoperative (p=0.017), and 90-day postoperative (p=0.012) 
SF-12 mental components, as well as the emotional component at the 30th 
postoperative day (p=0.016).
CONCLUSION: Patients with corneal and conjunctival tumors improved their ocular 
symptoms, visual acuity, and the emotional component of their quality of life 
after surgical excision of the tumor.

Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Antioquia, Medellín, Colombia.

Colombia.

Background: Evidence has demonstrated that adding intermittent inhaled 
corticosteroids (ICS) to treatment with short-acting b2-agonists (SABAs) in 
children 5 years of age and younger who experience intermittent viral-induced 
wheezing (VIW) reduces the risk of severe exacerbations. However, there is 
concern about whether the extra benefit offered by this drug outweighs the 
additional cost. This study aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of 
intermittent ICS in children 5 years of age and younger who experience 
intermittent VIW. Methods: We constructed a probabilistic Markov model to 
estimate the cost and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) of intermittent ICS 
compared with SABA reliever therapy in preschoolers with viral-triggered 
wheezing in Colombia. Multiple sensitivity analyses were conducted. 
Cost-effectiveness was evaluated at a willingness-to-pay value of $5,180. 
Results: In an analysis of the Markov cohort model, we estimated a gain of 0.2 
QALYs per patient per year on intermittent ICS compared with SABA and a 
reduction of cost per patient of USD $37 per year. This position of dominance 
negated the need to calculate an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. 
Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses, our base case results were 
robust to variations of all assumptions and parameters. Conclusion: Adding 
intermittent ICS to treatment with SABAs in children 5 years of age and younger 
who experience intermittent VIW was found to be cost effective. These results 
could improve the use of health care resources, especially in settings with 
limited economic resources.

BACKGROUND: Parkinson's disease is a common, age-related progressive 
neurodegenerative disorder with considerable socioeconomic burdens, although the 
studies in incremental burdens to the disease's rapid growth are incomplete and 
lag behind. We aim to assess global burdens of Parkinson's disease based on a 
public database online.
METHODS: Based on the Global Burden of Disease, Injuries, and Risk Factors 
Study, we screened a range of indicators including prevalence cases, 
disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), age-standardized prevalence rates 
(ASPRs), and age-standardized DALY rate (ASDR). The join point regression was 
used to assess the indicators, wherein the ASPR and the ASDR were referred to 
temporal trends for burdens of Parkinson's disease.
RESULTS: Prevalence cases of global Parkinson's disease were on the rise for 30 
years, with an increase of 155.51% during 1990-2019. Temporal trend of ASDRs was 
on the rise during 1990-2002 but in decline during 2002-2019. The ASPRs had a 
turning point in 2017 and a decline during 2017-2019 (annual percentage change = 
-0.51%, p > 0.05). China, India, the USA, Japan, and Germany shared the five 
highest prevalence cases and DALYs in 2019. The Socio-Demographic Index (SDI) 
was in relation to a significantly positive ASPR (R = 0.61, p < 0.001) but not a 
significantly negative ASDR (R = -0.044, p = 0.53), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study, a range of indicators for global burdens of 
Parkinson's disease were on the rise during 1990-2019. Tremendous efforts should 
be in place to prevent Parkinson's disease, especially among the populations of 
males, with advanced ages, in East Asia, and in regions with high SDI.

OBJECTIVE: To explore possible reasons for the difference in chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease (COPD) incidence/mortality rates between China and high 
socio-demographic index (SDI) countries.
DESIGN: A cross-sectional analysis of summary statistics from the Global Burden 
of Disease Study 2017.
PARTICIPANTS: Data were publicly available and de-identified, and individuals 
were not involved.
MEASUREMENT AND METHODS: We extracted the age-standardised and age-specific 
incidence/mortality rates, and risk factors attributed to COPD in China and high 
SDI countries from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2017. We first described 
differences in COPD patterns (ie, incidence and mortality rates) in China and 
high SDI countries briefly, and then explored possible reasons for driving such 
differences by comparing rankings for six well-established COPD risk factors and 
estimating change points in age-specific incidence and mortality rates for COPD 
and several commonly encountered competing risks using segmented regression 
models.
RESULTS: Differences in age-standardised incidence and mortality rates for COPD 
between China and high SDI countries converged during 1990-2017 but still 
differed, particularly for mortality rates. Smoking was the leading attributable 
risk factor followed by ambient air pollution, with higher rankings for 
occupational risks in China than in high SDI countries. The change point was ~80 
years for age-specific COPD mortality rate in both China and high SDI countries. 
However, the change point for COPD incidence was 5-year later in China (~65 
years) than in high SDI countries (~60 years). The change points for mortality 
rates due to competing risks (eg, ischaemic heart disease) also varied between 
settings.
CONCLUSION: Differences in risk factors largely shaped the differences in COPD 
patterns between China and high SDI countries. Varying patterns of mortality due 
to competing risks might also contribute to the discrepancy in COPD mortality 
rates, by affecting the survival of the underlying population.

Augusta, GA 30912, USA.

BACKGROUND: Clear cell odontogenic carcinoma (CCOC) is a rare malignant 
odontogenic epithelial neoplasm of the jaws. It is composed of irregular nests 
of clear to faintly eosinophilic cells resembling clear cell rests of primitive 
dental lamina and an intermixed hyalinized fibrous stroma. Most cases occur in 
the 5th and 6th decades of life, with a female predominance. The mandible is 
affected more than the maxilla. Clinical features vary from asymptomatic to 
non-specific pain, ill-defined radiolucency, root resorption, and sometimes soft 
tissue extension. Histology varies from bland to high grade. CCOC demonstrated a 
significant tendency to recur. Metastasis typically involves regional lymph 
nodes, which haves been reported in 20-25% of cases. Pulmonary metastasis rarely 
occurs. Differential diagnoses are broad and include odontogenic, salivary, 
melanocytic, and metastatic neoplasia. CCOCs are positive for cytokeratins, 
mainly AE1/AE3 and CK19. Most cases show EWSR1 rearrangement and rarely, the 
BRAFV600E mutation.
DESIGN: Patient charts were reviewed at our institution. A total of three cases 
were found in electronic medical records, which were diagnosed as clear cell 
odontogenic carcinoma over a period of six years (2014-2019). Patient charts 
were reviewed for medical history and radiology data. The pathology slides were 
reviewed by one or more faculty members.
RESULTS: We present three cases of CCOC, ranging in age from 40 to 69 years (two 
women and one man). Two cases involved the maxilla and one involved the 
mandible. Two presented with painful swelling and one with mass recurrence. 
Radiography results show that two had poorly defined radiolucent lesions, and 
one was heterogeneous with a small nodule projecting into the maxillary sinus. 
Histological examination revealed an epithelial neoplasm composed of irregular 
sheets, cords, and nests of polygonal cells with central hyperchromatic, mildly 
pleomorphic nuclei surrounded by clear to pale eosinophilic cytoplasm, with 
occasional mitotic figures. The tumor had infiltrated the bone and soft tissues. 
Two cases were immunopositive for CK5/6 and one case was positive for p63 and 
CK19. Interestingly, the eosinophilic dentinoid matrix interspersed among tumor 
cells in one case was consistent with its odontogenic origin. Histochemical 
staining showed PAS-positive and diastase-labile intracytoplasmic material 
consistent with glycogen.
CONCLUSION: Our study highlights the potential diagnostic significance of 
dentinoid (although reportedly seen in only 7% of cases), along with CK5/6 
immunopositivity, in supporting the histologic diagnosis of CCOC among a variety 
of neoplasia in its differential diagnosis.

Public reimbursement systems face the challenge of balancing provision of needed 
treatments and the reality of limited resources. Canada has a complex system for 
drug approval and public reimbursement, with jurisdiction divided between the 
federal government and the provinces/territories. A pivotal role is that of 
health technology assessment (HTA), which relies primarily on health economic 
principles to analyze the value of drugs on a population health basis and make 
recommendations about public reimbursement. The Canadian Agency for Drugs and 
Technologies in Health (CADTH) provides recommendations to all provinces but 
Quebec. This article provides an overview of Canada's approval and public 
reimbursement pathway, including the role of HTA and the economic principles on 
which it relies. Starting in late 2020, CADTH reduced the cost per 
quality-adjusted life year (QALY) threshold, the metric relied upon in making 
recommendations to public payers. An analysis of all 56 oncology drug final 
recommendations issued from January 2020 to January 2022 was conducted and 
confirms this reduction in the cost per QALY threshold. As a result of this 
threshold reduction, recommendations to the provinces include, in a number of 
cases, substantially greater price reductions. The potential implications for 
successful price negotiation with the pan-Canadian Pharmaceutical Alliance 
(pCPA), the public negotiating body for the provinces, are discussed.

Sedentary behavior contributes to a shortened life expectancy in individuals 
with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders (SSDs), highlighting the need for 
effective interventions to improve health. This study examined whether reduced 
ecological momentary assessment (EMA) measures of sedentary activities were 
observed in individuals with SSDs who participated in a 24-week randomized trial 
of cognitive behavioral social skills training (CBSST) and either intranasal 
oxytocin or placebo (NCT01752712). Participants (n = 57) were prompted with EMA 
surveys seven times per day for seven days during the baseline, 12-week, and 
24-week timepoints to sample sedentary behavior ratings, positive and negative 
affect, interpersonal interactions, and interpersonal interaction appraisals. 
Results revealed that sedentary behavior and social interactions did not 
significantly change over the 24-week clinical trial; however, positive and 
negative affect and defeatist interaction appraisals improved with treatment, 
and oxytocin produced modest additional improvements in these EMA outcomes. 
Greater momentary positive affect was significantly associated with greater 
activity and greater frequency of interactions. Overall, CBSST was effective at 
improving functioning, momentary affect, and defeatist interaction appraisals, 
although it did not reduce sedentary behavior; therefore, targeting these 
factors is not sufficient to reduce sedentary behavior, and adjunct 
interventions are needed.

In recent years, a lack of stability of dairy products with extended shelf life 
(e.g., yoghurt products, UHT desserts) has occurred, with the corresponding 
products liquefying significantly after days or weeks. This project aimed to 
identify the enzymes responsible for the liquefaction of the affected products 
based on differential proteomic analyses. No evidence was found for the presence 
of starch-degrading bacteria in the affected products. With zymography and 
proteome analysis, we detected the cause of liquefaction in a pudding by 
contamination of its aroma component with an engineered amylolytic enzyme, 
cyclomaltodextrin glucanotransferase (CGTase) from Thermoanaerobacterium 
thermosulfurigenes. In addition, we detected contamination with 
Pseudomonas-derived proteolytic ATP-dependent Clp protease in one pudding batch 
and proteases in technically used amylases, which degraded β-caseins in another 
batch. Identification of these agents with liquefying properties in dairy 
products are useful for adjustment of production protocols and/or composition of 
additives, and thus shelf life extension.

The Extension of Foundress Life Span and the Evolution of Eusociality in the 
Hymenoptera.

da Silva J.

AbstractThe evolution of effectively sterile workers in the aculeate Hymenoptera 
(ants, bees, and stinging wasps) requires that a female's life span largely 
overlap that of her daughters. The evolution of long nest foundress life spans 
in eusocial species from the short life spans of solitary species is 
investigated. Analyses that control for phylogeny show for the first time that 
foundress adult life span increases and first-brood offspring development time 
decreases with increasing colony size, resulting in the ratio of foundress adult 
life span to worker total life span increasing with increasing colony size. 
These patterns support the hypothesis that the reproductive division of labor 
increases with increasing colony size, explaining the evolution of effectively 
sterile workers in species with large colonies. However, there is a discrete 
increase in foundress adult life span in the transition from noneusociality to 
eusociality that is independent of colony size. An analysis of life history 
characters suggests that this increase is explained by nests being founded by 
multiple females and progressive feeding of larvae as they develop. A reduced 
rate of senescence of a dominant cofoundress may be selected as a plastic 
response to social status if high-risk tasks performed by subordinate 
cofoundresses reduce the dominant's extrinsic mortality rate. Multiple-foundress 
nests in which one female is responsible for most or all of the reproduction 
(semisociality) and in which foundresses are full sisters are favored by 
haplodiploidy, perhaps explaining why eusociality is so common in the 
Hymenoptera.
