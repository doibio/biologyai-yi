People with mental health conditions have a lower life expectancy and poorer 
physical health outcomes than the general population. Evidence suggests this is 
due to a combination of clinical risk factors, socioeconomic factors, and health 
system factors, notably a lack of integration when care is required across 
service settings. Several recent reports have looked at ways to better integrate 
physical and mental health care for people with severe mental illness (SMI). We 
built on these by conducting a mapping review that looked for the most recent 
evidence and service models in this area. This involved searching the published 
literature and speaking to people involved in providing or using current 
services. Few of the identified service models were described adequately and 
fewer still were evaluated, raising questions about the replicability and 
generalisability of much of the existing evidence. However, some common themes 
did emerge. Efforts to improve the physical health care of people with SMI 
should empower staff and service users and help remove everyday barriers to 
delivering and accessing integrated care. In particular, there is a need for 
improved communication among professionals and better information technology to 
support them, greater clarity about who is responsible and accountable for 
physical health care, and greater awareness of the effects of stigmatisation on 
the wider culture and environment in which services are delivered.

BACKGROUND: Patient-centred care requires evidence of treatment effects across 
many outcomes. Outcomes can be beneficial (e.g. increased survival or cure 
rates) or detrimental (e.g. adverse events, pain associated with treatment, 
treatment costs, time required for treatment). Treatment effects may also be 
heterogeneous across outcomes and across patients. Randomized controlled trials 
are usually insufficient to supply evidence across outcomes. Observational data 
analysis is an alternative, with the caveat that the treatments observed are 
choices. Real-world treatment choice often involves complex assessment of 
expected effects across the array of outcomes. Failure to account for this 
complexity when interpreting treatment effect estimates could lead to clinical 
and policy mistakes.
OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to assess the properties of treatment effect 
estimates based on choice when treatments have heterogeneous effects on both 
beneficial and detrimental outcomes across patients.
METHODS: Simulation methods were used to highlight the sensitivity of treatment 
effect estimates to the distributions of treatment effects across patients 
across outcomes. Scenarios with alternative correlations between benefit and 
detriment treatment effects across patients were used. Regression and 
instrumental variable estimators were applied to the simulated data for both 
outcomes.
RESULTS: True treatment effect parameters are sensitive to the relationships of 
treatment effectiveness across outcomes in each study population. In each 
simulation scenario, treatment effect estimate interpretations for each outcome 
are aligned with results shown previously in single outcome models, but these 
estimates vary across simulated populations with the correlations of treatment 
effects across patients across outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: If estimator assumptions are valid, estimates across outcomes can 
be used to assess the optimality of treatment rates in a study population. 
However, because true treatment effect parameters are sensitive to correlations 
of treatment effects across outcomes, decision makers should be cautious about 
generalizing estimates to other populations.

Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) has been the subject of much controversy since 
the advent of population based breast screening programs. An increasing number 
of asymptomatic women are being diagnosed with this condition and there is 
uncertainty over the best treatment algorithm for this condition if treatment is 
to be considered at all. Different subtypes of DCIS show innate differences in 
developmental pathways and biological behavior. This is not only determined by 
pathological subtypes but there is increasing understanding of molecular 
biomarkers related to DCIS progression. The ultimate management aim is to 
identify a subgroup of patients in whom DCIS will not progress to invasive 
disease such that they can avoid morbidity from surgical and adjuvant therapies. 
This has to be balanced by the potential risk of undertreatment of patients in 
whom DCIS is likely to progress to invasive cancer and hence a reduced life 
expectancy. Results of current ongoing prospective randomized trials assessing 
the safety of omitting surgery for what is considered to be low risk DCIS are 
eagerly awaited for by patients and clinicians. However the definition of what 
is considered to be "low risk" DCIS is still to be ascertained.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Previous research has found diacetylmorphine, delivered 
under supervision, to be cost-effective in the treatment of severe opioid use 
disorder, but diacetylmorphine is not available in many settings. The Study to 
Assess Long-term Opioid Maintenance Effectiveness (SALOME) randomized controlled 
trial provided evidence that injectable hydromorphone is non-inferior to 
diacetylmorphine. The current study aimed to compare the cost-effectiveness of 
hydromorphone directly with diacetylmorphine and indirectly with methadone 
maintenance treatment.
DESIGN: A within-trial analysis was conducted using the patient level data from 
the 6-month, double-blind, non-inferiority SALOME trial. A life-time analysis 
extrapolated costs and outcomes using a decision analytical cohort model. The 
model incorporated data from a previous trial to include an indirect comparison 
to methadone maintenance.
SETTING: A supervised clinic in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.
PARTICIPANTS: A total of 202 long-term street opioid injectors who had at least 
two attempts at treatment, including one with methadone (or other substitution), 
were randomized to hydromorphone (n = 100) or diacetylmorphine (n = 102).
MEASUREMENTS: We measured the utilization of drugs, visits to health 
professionals, hospitalizations, criminal activity, mortality and quality of 
life. This enabled us to estimate incremental costs, quality-adjusted life years 
(QALYs) and cost-effectiveness ratios from a societal perspective. Sensitivity 
analyses considered different sources of evidence, assumptions and perspectives.
FINDINGS: The within-trial analysis found hydromorphone provided similar QALYs 
to diacetylmorphine [0.377, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.361-0.393 versus 
0.375, 95% CI = 0.357-0.391], but accumulated marginally greater costs [$49 830 
($28 401-73 637) versus $34 320 ($21 780-55 998)]. The life-time analysis 
suggested that both diacetylmorphine and hydromorphone provide more benefits 
than methadone [8.4 (7.4-9.5) and 8.3 (7.2-9.5) versus 7.4 (6.5-8.3) QALYs] at 
lower cost [$1.01 million ($0.6-1.59 million) and $1.02 million 
($0.72-1.51 million) versus $1.15 million ($0.71-1.84 million)].
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with severe opioid use disorder enrolled into the 
SALOME trial, injectable hydromorphone provided similar outcomes to injectable 
diacetylmorphine. Modelling outcomes during a patient's life-time suggested that 
injectable hydromorphone might provide greater benefit than methadone alone and 
may be cost-saving, with drug costs being offset by costs saved from reduced 
involvement in criminal activity.

Author information:

Macul, Santiago, Chile.

BACKGROUND: This study was aimed to estimate life expectancy (LE), 
disability-free life expectancy (DFLE) and disabled life expectancy (DLE) among 
older adults from Santiago, Chile, and to determine the existence of differences 
by gender and by body mass index (BMI) categories in these indicators.
METHODS: A sample of 1216 people aged 60 or more, from the Chilean cohort of the 
Study of Health, Ageing and Well-Being was recruited in 2000; two follow-up 
assessments were carried out in a 10-year period. Functional limitation was 
assessed through self-report of difficulties in activities of daily living, 
instrumental activities of daily living and mobility. BMI was determined with 
measured weight and height. Multistate life tables were employed to estimate LE 
and healthy life expectancy (HLE).
RESULTS: At 60 years, women could expect to live on average an additional 20.4 
years (95% CI 19.0-21.6), and men an additional 16.4 years (95% CI 14.9-17.7). 
Total LE was longer among women at all ages, but they had a higher proportion of 
disabled years to be lived compared to men, with a difference of 14% at 60 
years, and 10% at 90 years. There were no significant differences in LE, DFLE 
and DLE between BMI categories.
DISCUSSION: Despite a longer LE, Chilean older women expect to live a higher 
proportion of years with disabilities, compared to men. Public health programs 
should address factors affecting LE of older men, and those associated with 
disability among older women.

OBJECTIVE: Individuals with CP have a lower life expectancy than the general 
population. The objective of the study is to investigate the risk factor of 
mortality in Indonesian children with CP.
METHODS: An observational analytic study was conducted using medical records at 
pediatric ward Dr. Soetomo Hospital, Surabaya, Indonesia, from January 2014 to 
December 2016. Inclusion criteria was all of CP patients in that were 
hospitalized from 6 months to 14 year of age. Mortality information was obtained 
from annual computer and matched against the subjects with CP on the basis of 
name, date of birth, type of disability, degree of disability, nutritional 
status and the outcomes. Risk factors were counted using logistic regression.
RESULT: Fifty five children were enrolled. The outcome revaled 12 patients 
(21.8%) were death. Pneumonia was the most common underlying disease cause of 
death (OR=5.185;95% CI 1.249 to 21.520;Psize 8 < 0.007). Other risk factors of 
mortality that significant were acute kidney injury (AKI) (OR=3.333;95% CI 1.317 
to 8.436;Psize 8 < 0.03). and Gross Motor Functioning Classification System 
(GMFCS) more than level IV (OR=1.480;95% CI 1.184 to 1.850;Psize 8 < 0.006).
CONCLUSION: Pneumonia, AKI and severe GMFCS level were risk factors of death in 
patients with CP. J. Med. Invest. 65:18-20, February, 2018.

Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is characterized as a group of cardiometabolic risk 
factors that raise the risk for heart disease and other health problems, such as 
diabetes mellitus and stroke. Treatment strategies include pharmacologic 
interventions and supplementary (or "alternative") treatments. Nutraceuticals 
are derived from food sources (isolated nutrients, dietary supplements and 
herbal products) that are purported to provide health benefits, in addition to 
providing basic nutritional value. Nutraceuticals are claimed to prevent chronic 
diseases, improve health, delay the aging process, increase life expectancy, and 
support the structure and function of the body. The study of the beneficial 
effects of nutraceuticals in patients with MetS, including product 
standardization, duration of supplementation and definition of optimal dosing, 
could help better define appropriate treatment. This review focuses on widely 
marketed nutraceuticals (namely polyphenols, omega-3 fatty acids, macroelements 
and vitamins) with clinically demonstrated effects on more than one component of 
MetS.

With the increase in life expectancy, the Brazilian elderly population has risen 
considerably. However, longevity is usually accompanied by problems such as the 
loss of functional capacity, cognitive decline, frailty syndrome, and 
deterioration in anthropometric parameters, particularly among those living in 
long-term care facilities. This randomized controlled trial aimed to verify the 
effects of exercise training on biochemical, inflammatory, and anthropometric 
indices and functional performance in institutionalized frail elderly. The 
sample consisted of 37 elderly people of both genders, aged 76.1 ± 7.7 years, 
who were randomly allocated into 2 groups: 13 individuals in the exercise group 
(EG) and 24 in the control group (CG). Anthropometrics, clinical history, 
functional tests, and biochemical evaluation were measured before and after the 
completion of a physical exercise program, which lasted for 12 weeks. The 
12-week exercise program for frail elderly residents in a long-term care 
facility was efficient in improving muscle strength, speed, agility, and 
biochemical variables, with reversal of the frailty condition in a considerable 
number. However, no effects in anthropometric and inflammatory parameters were 
noted.

Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening reduces prostate cancer (PCa) 
mortality; however such screening may lead to harm in terms of overdiagnosis and 
overtreatment. Therefore, upfront shared decision making involving a discussion 
about pros and cons between a physician and a patient is crucial. Total PSA 
remains the most commonly used screening tool and is a strong predictor of 
future life-threatening PCa. Currently there is no strong consensus on the age 
at which to start PSA screening. Most guidelines recommend PSA screening to 
start no later than at age 55 and involve well-informed men in good health and a 
life expectancy of at least 10-15 years. Some suggest to start screening in 
early midlife for men with familial predisposition and men of African-American 
descent. Others suggest starting conversations at age 45 for all men. 
Re-screening intervals can be risk-stratified as guided by the man's age, 
general health and PSA-value; longer intervals for those at lower risk and 
shorter intervals for those at higher risk. Overdiagnosis and unnecessary 
biopsies can be reduced using reflex tests. Magnetic resonance imaging in the 
pre-diagnostic setting holds promise in pilot studies and large-scale 
prospective studies are ongoing.

Mosquito and predatory larvae often share the same habitat. Predators may 
influence mosquito prey populations through both lethal effect and non-lethal 
pathways. A series of experimental manipulations were used to distinguish 
between lethal (density-mediated interaction) and non-lethal (trait-mediated 
interaction) effects in a model system comprised of invasive prey mosquito, 
Aedes aegypti, and a predatory mosquito Toxorhynchites rutilus. Treatments with 
predators present or manipulations mimicking daily mortality (density reduction) 
reduced developmental time and recruitment to the adult stage. Daily records of 
adult survival of A. aegypti showed that exposure to predators during the 
juvenile stage shortened the lifespan of adults. This was also observed in 
treatments, where A. aegypti were replaced at the rate of consumption by T. 
rutilus. In contrast, numerical reductions in A. aegypti that mimicked daily 
rate of predation led to adults with the longest lifespan. These observations 
suggest strong effects of density and trait-mediated interactions in the 
influence of predators on mosquito biology relevant to their ability to transmit 
pathogens. These results have potentially important implications for disease 
control strategies. The primary approach to reduce risk of mosquito-borne 
diseases is through population reduction of the vectors. We show an 
unanticipated benefit of biological control by predation for the control of 
juvenile stages of mosquitoes. Specifically, mosquitoes that are exposed to 
predators but survive to adulthood will have compromised life expectancy, a key 
parameter in determining risk of disease transmission.

As part of its single technology appraisal process, the UK National Institute 
for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) invited the manufacturer of obinutuzumab 
(Roche) to submit evidence on its clinical and cost effectiveness when used in 
combination with bendamustine in patients with follicular lymphoma (FL) 
refractory to rituximab. The Evidence Review Group (ERG), the School of Health 
and Related Research Technology Appraisal Group at the University of Sheffield, 
produced a document summarising the key points from the company submission 
alongside a critical review. Efficacy for progression-free survival (PFS) and 
safety was positively demonstrated in the pivotal GADOLIN trial, which compared 
obinutuzumab in combination with bendamustine followed by obinutuzumab 
maintenance (O-Benda+O) against bendamustine monotherapy. Data on overall 
survival were immature. The company submitted a model-based economic analysis, 
including a patient access scheme. The ERG identified a number of limitations, 
in particular the absence of subgroup analysis and the approach used by the 
company to estimate overall survival (OS), which was more favourable to the 
intervention arm. The key uncertainty was the duration of the treatment effect 
on OS. This uncertainty is expected to be reduced when the final analysis of the 
GADOLIN trial is reported. Consequently, the NICE appraisal committee 
recommended O-Benda+O in the population covered by the marketing authorisation 
within the Cancer Drug Fund until NICE is able to review the guidance following 
publication of the final analysis of GADOLIN.

Assessment of linear and nonlinear/complex heartbeat dynamics in subclinical 
depression (dysphoria).

OBJECTIVE: Depression is one of the leading causes of disability worldwide. Most 
previous studies have focused on major depression, and studies on subclinical 
depression, such as those on so-called dysphoria, have been overlooked. Indeed, 
dysphoria is associated with a high prevalence of somatic disorders, and a 
reduction of quality of life and life expectancy. In current clinical practice, 
dysphoria is assessed using psychometric questionnaires and structured 
interviews only, without taking into account objective pathophysiological 
indices. To address this problem, in this study we investigated heartbeat linear 
and nonlinear dynamics to derive objective autonomic nervous system biomarkers 
of dysphoria.
APPROACH: Sixty undergraduate students participated in the study: according to 
clinical evaluation, 24 of them were dysphoric. Extensive group-wise statistics 
was performed to characterize the pathological and control groups. Moreover, a 
recursive feature elimination algorithm based on a K-NN classifier was carried 
out for the automatic recognition of dysphoria at a single-subject level.
MAIN RESULTS: The results showed that the most significant group-wise 
differences referred to increased heartbeat complexity (particularly for fractal 
dimension, sample entropy and recurrence plot analysis) with regards to the 
healthy controls, confirming dysfunctional nonlinear sympatho-vagal dynamics in 
mood disorders. Furthermore, a balanced accuracy of 79.17% was achieved in 
automatically distinguishing dysphoric patients from controls, with the most 
informative power attributed to nonlinear, spectral and polyspectral quantifiers 
of cardiovascular variability.
SIGNIFICANCE: This study experimentally supports the assessment of dysphoria as 
a defined clinical condition with specific characteristics which are different 
both from healthy, fully euthymic controls and from full-blown major depression.

[Systemic sclerosis in 2017].

[Article in Czech]

Soukup T, Veleta T.

Systemic sclerosis is classed as a diffuse (systemic) disease of connective 
tissue. It is a heterogeneous disease significantly shortening life expectancy. 
Its etiology is unknown. Pathogenetic interplay is assumed to involve a triad of 
pathological autoimmune inflammation, vasculopathy and fibrosis. Clinical 
manifestations can be classed based on the preponderant pathogenetic process. 
Vasculopathy is manifested by secondary Raynauds phenomenon with abnormal 
findings on the nailfold capillaroscopy, skin telangiectasias, gastric antral 
vascular ectasia, life threatening scleroderma renal crisis, digital ulcerations 
and prognostically severe pulmonary arterial hypertension. The treatment of 
vascular manifestations uses medicines with vasodilation effect. The 
manifestation of inflammation is accentuated by pleurisy, pericarditis, 
myositis, synovitis/arthritis and alveolitis. Finally, the manifestation of 
fibrosis predominates in association with dermatosclerosis, interstitial lung 
disease and fibrotic impairment of the gastrointestinal tract. Medicines with 
immunomodulatory or immunosupressive effects are used to affect the inflammation 
and fibrosis. Despite the aforementioned, there is still no universally 
effective treatment available. The pharmacological therapy of this disease is 
organ specific and symptomatic.Key words: capillaroscopy - digital ulcers - 
interstitial lung disease - pulmonary arterial hypertension - scleroderma renal 
crisis - systemic sclerosis.

Continuous time dynamic models are similar to popular discrete time models such 
as autoregressive cross-lagged models, but through use of stochastic 
differential equations can accurately account for differences in time intervals 
between measurements, and more parsimoniously specify complex dynamics. As such 
they offer powerful and flexible approaches to understand ongoing psychological 
processes and interventions, and allow for measurements to be taken a variable 
number of times, and at irregular intervals. However, limited developments have 
taken place regarding the use of continuous time models in a fully hierarchical 
context, in which all model parameters are allowed to vary over individuals. 
This has meant that questions regarding individual differences in parameters 
have had to rely on single-subject time series approaches, which require far 
more measurement occasions per individual. We present a hierarchical Bayesian 
approach to estimating continuous time dynamic models, allowing for individual 
variation in all model parameters. We also describe an extension to the ctsem 
package for R, which interfaces to the Stan software and allows simple 
specification and fitting of such models. To demonstrate the approach, we use a 
subsample from the German socioeconomic panel and relate overall life 
satisfaction and satisfaction with health. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018

Current studies show that, even in the era of antiretroviral therapies, HIV-1 
infection is associated with more severe and frequent refractory chronic 
periodontitis. Areas covered: This review, based on a systematic analysis of the 
literature, intends to provide an update on factors that may be involved in the 
pathogenesis of periodontal disease in HIV-1-infected patients, including local 
immunosuppression, oral microbial factors, systemic inflammation, salivary 
markers, and the role of gingival tissue as a possible reservoir of HIV-1. 
Expert commentary: The therapeutic revolution of ART made HIV-1 infection a 
chronic controllable disease, reduced HIV-1 mortality rate, restored at least 
partially the immune response and dramatically increased life expectancy of 
HIV-1-infected patients. Despite all these positive aspects, chronic 
periodontitis assumes an important role in the HIV-1 infection status for 
activating systemic inflammation favoring viral replication and influencing 
HIV-1 status, and also acting as a possible reservoir of HIV-1. All these issues 
still need to be clarified and validated, but have important clinical 
implications that certainly will benefit the diagnosis and management of chronic 
periodontitis in HIV-1-infected patients, and also contributes to HIV-1 
eradication.

Current antiretroviral therapy allows to achieve and sustain maximal suppression 
of HIV replication in most treated patients. As result, the life expectancy of 
HIV-infected persons has improved dramatically and is nowadays similar to that 
of the HIV-negative population. However, oral antiretrovirals have to be taken 
daily and indefinitely to avoid resumption of HIV replication and selection of 
drug resistance. Unfortunately, drug adherence is often suboptimal and tends to 
decline over time. Areas covered: New drugs, formulations and delivery systems 
are being developed for extended-release of antiretrovirals. At this time, 
intramuscular cabotegravir and rilpivirine, dapivirine vaginal rings and 
tenofovir alafenamide subdermal implants are the products in more advanced 
stages of clinical development. Their pharmacokinetics/dynamics and 
safety/efficacy are reviewed. Expert commentary: In the absence of eradicative 
therapy for individuals with HIV infection and protective vaccines for persons 
at risk, long-term antiretroviral therapy is the best approach for preventing 
disease progression in patients and halting transmissions, either as result of 
'treatment as prevention' for HIV carriers or 'pre-exposure prophylaxis' for 
uninfected individuals at risk. In all these scenarios, the advent of 
long-acting antiretrovirals will expand options for overcoming the challenge of 
suboptimal drug adherence and reduce the burden of HIV infection.

BACKGROUND: Stroke is a major cause of death and disability worldwide. Hypoxia 
is common after stroke and is associated with worse outcomes. Oxygen 
supplementation could prevent hypoxia and secondary brain damage.
OBJECTIVES: (1) To assess whether or not routine low-dose oxygen supplementation 
in patients with acute stroke improves outcome compared with no oxygen; and (2) 
to assess whether or not oxygen given at night only, when oxygen saturation is 
most likely to be low, is more effective than continuous supplementation.
DESIGN: Multicentre, prospective, randomised, open, blinded-end point trial.
SETTING: Secondary care hospitals with acute stroke wards.
PARTICIPANTS: Adult stroke patients within 24 hours of hospital admission and 48 
hours of stroke onset, without definite indications for or contraindications to 
oxygen or a life-threatening condition other than stroke.
INTERVENTIONS: Allocated by web-based minimised randomisation to: (1) continuous 
oxygen: oxygen via nasal cannula continuously (day and night) for 72 hours after 
randomisation at a flow rate of 3 l/minute if baseline oxygen saturation was 
≤ 93% or 2 l/minute if > 93%; (2) nocturnal oxygen: oxygen via nasal cannula 
overnight (21:00-07:00) for three consecutive nights. The flow rate was the same 
as the continuous oxygen group; and (3) control: no routine oxygen 
supplementation unless required for reasons other than stroke.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcome: disability assessed by the modified 
Rankin Scale (mRS) at 3 months by postal questionnaire (participant aware, 
assessor blinded). Secondary outcomes at 7 days: neurological improvement, 
National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), mortality, and the highest 
and lowest oxygen saturations within the first 72 hours. Secondary outcomes at 
3, 6, and 12 months: mortality, independence, current living arrangements, 
Barthel Index, quality of life (European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions, three 
levels) and Nottingham Extended Activities of Daily Living scale by postal 
questionnaire.
RESULTS: In total, 8003 patients were recruited between 24 April 2008 and 17 
June 2013 from 136 hospitals in the UK [continuous, n = 2668; nocturnal, 
n = 2667; control, n = 2668; mean age 72 years (standard deviation 13 years); 
4398 (55%) males]. All prognostic factors and baseline characteristics were well 
matched across the groups. Eighty-two per cent had ischaemic strokes. At 
baseline the median Glasgow Coma Scale score was 15 (interquartile range 15-15) 
and the mean and median NIHSS scores were 7 and 5 (range 0-34), respectively. 
The mean oxygen saturation at randomisation was 96.6% in the continuous and 
nocturnal oxygen groups and 96.7% in the control group. Primary outcome: oxygen 
supplementation did not reduce disability in either the continuous or the 
nocturnal oxygen groups. The unadjusted odds ratio for a better outcome (lower 
mRS) was 0.97 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.89 to 1.05; p = 0.5] for the 
combined oxygen groups (both continuous and nocturnal together) (n = 5152) 
versus the control (n = 2567) and 1.03 (95% CI 0.93 to 1.13; p = 0.6) for 
continuous versus nocturnal oxygen. Secondary outcomes: oxygen supplementation 
significantly increased oxygen saturation, but did not affect any of the other 
secondary outcomes.
LIMITATIONS: Severely hypoxic patients were not included.
CONCLUSIONS: Routine low-dose oxygen supplementation in stroke patients who are 
not severely hypoxic is safe, but does not improve outcome after stroke.
FUTURE WORK: To investigate the causes of hypoxia and develop methods of 
prevention.

PURPOSE: Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is a rare hereditary cancer syndrome 
that reduces life expectancy. We aimed to construct a more valuable 
genotype-phenotype correlation based on alterations in VHL protein (pVHL).
METHODS: VHL patients (n = 339) were recruited and grouped based on mutation 
types: HIF-α binding site missense (HM) mutations, non-HIF-α binding site 
missense (nHM) mutations, and truncating (TR) mutations. Age-related risks of 
VHL-associated tumors and patient survival were compared.
RESULTS: Missense mutations conferred an increased risk of pheochromocytoma 
(HR = 1.854, p = 0.047) compared with truncating mutations. The risk of 
pheochromocytoma was lower in the HM group than in the nHM group (HR = 0.298, 
p = 0.003) but was similar between HM and TR groups (HR = 0.901, p = 0.810). 
Patients in the nHM group had a higher risk of pheochromocytoma (HR = 3.447, 
p < 0.001) and lower risks of central nervous system hemangioblastoma (CHB) 
(HR = 0.700, p = 0.045), renal cell carcinoma (HR = 0.610, p = 0.024), and 
pancreatic tumor (HR = 0.382, p < 0.001) than those in the combined HM and TR 
(HMTR) group. Moreover, nHM mutations were independently associated with better 
overall survival (HR = 0.345, p = 0.005) and CHB-specific survival (HR = 0.129, 
p = 0.005) than HMTR mutations.
CONCLUSION: The modified genotype-phenotype correlation links VHL gene mutation, 
substrate binding site, and phenotypic diversity (penetrance and survival), and 
provides more accurate information for genetic counseling and pathogenesis 
studies.

CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: The spectrum of ASAH1-related disorders ranges from 
Farber disease (FD) to spinal muscular atrophy with progressive myoclonic 
epilepsy (SMA-PME). Classic FD is characterized by onset in the first weeks of 
life of painful, progressive deformity of the major joints; palpable 
subcutaneous nodules of joints and mechanical pressure points; and a hoarse cry 
resulting from granulomas of the larynx and epiglottis. Life expectancy is 
usually less than two years. In the other less common types of FD, onset, 
severity, and primary manifestations vary. SMA-PME is characterized by 
early-childhood-onset progressive lower motor neuron disease manifest typically 
between ages three and seven years as proximal lower-extremity weakness, 
followed by progressive myoclonic and atonic seizures, tremulousness/tremor, and 
sensorineural hearing loss. Myoclonic epilepsy typically begins in late 
childhood after the onset of weakness and can include jerking of the upper 
limbs, action myoclonus, myoclonic status, and eyelid myoclonus. Other findings 
include generalized tremor, and cognitive decline. The time from disease onset 
to death from respiratory complications is usually five to 15 years.
DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The diagnosis of an ASAH1-related disorder is established in 
a proband with suggestive clinical findings by identification of biallelic 
pathogenic variants in ASAH1 and/or decreased activity of the enzyme acid 
ceramidase in peripheral blood leukocytes or cultured skin fibroblasts.
MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations is symptomatic and multidisciplinary. 
For FD: Management may include gastrostomy tube placement, surgical removal of 
oral and airway granulomas, and treatment of seizures as per standard practice. 
Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation may be an option in affected individuals 
who do not have significant neurologic involvement. For SMA-PME: Management may 
include standard treatment for hearing loss, scoliosis, seizures, and tremor. 
Weakness can be mitigated with the use of orthotics, wheelchairs, or other 
assistive devices. Surveillance: For FD: At each visit assess growth with 
emphasis on feeding and nutritional status; airway, joint mobility, and 
developmental milestones. For SMA-PME: At each visit monitor growth with 
emphasis on feeding and nutritional status, pulmonary function, back for 
evidence of scoliosis, strength, seizure control, functional capacity (e.g., 
mobility, communication); assess hearing annually.
GENETIC COUNSELING: ASAH1-related disorders are inherited in an autosomal 
recessive manner. At conception, each sib of an affected individual has a 25% 
chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 
25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Sibs with the same two 
pathogenic variants would be expected to have the same (or very similar) 
phenotype. Once the ASAH1 pathogenic variants have been identified in an 
affected family member, carrier testing for at-risk relatives and prenatal and 
preimplantation genetic testing are possible.

BACKGROUND: Preliminary studies have indicated that training staff in Positive 
Behaviour Support (PBS) may help to reduce challenging behaviour among people 
with intellectual disability (ID).
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether or not such training is clinically effective in 
reducing challenging behaviour in routine care. The study also included 
longer-term follow-up (approximately 36 months).
DESIGN: A multicentre, single-blind, two-arm, parallel-cluster randomised 
controlled trial. The unit of randomisation was the community ID service using 
an independent web-based randomisation system and random permuted blocks on a 
1 : 1 allocation stratified by a staff-to-patient ratio for each cluster.
SETTING: Community ID services in England.
PARTICIPANTS: Adults (aged > 18 years) across the range of ID with challenging 
behaviour [≥ 15 Aberrant Behaviour Checklist - Community total score (ABC-CT)].
INTERVENTIONS: Manual-assisted face-to-face PBS training to therapists and 
treatment as usual (TAU) compared with TAU only in the control arm.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Carer-reported changes in challenging behaviour as 
measured by the ABC-CT over 12 months. Secondary outcomes included 
psychopathology, community participation, family and paid carer burden, family 
carer psychopathology, costs of care and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). 
Data on main outcome, service use and health-related quality of life were 
collected for the 36-month follow-up.
RESULTS: A total of 246 participants were recruited from 23 teams, of whom 109 
were in the intervention arm (11 teams) and 137 were in the control arm (12 
teams). The difference in ABC-CT between the intervention and control arms [mean 
difference -2.14, 95% confidence interval (CI) -8.79 to 4.51; p = 0.528] was not 
statistically significant. No treatment effects were found for any of the 
secondary outcomes. The mean cost per participant in the intervention arm was 
£1201. Over 12 months, there was a difference in QALYs of 0.076 in favour of the 
intervention (95% CI 0.011 to 0.140 QALYs) and a 60% chance that the 
intervention is cost-effective compared with TAU from a health and social care 
cost perspective at the threshold of £20,000 per QALY gained. Twenty-nine 
participants experienced 45 serious adverse events (intervention arm, n = 19; 
control arm, n = 26). PBS plans were available for 33 participants. An 
independent assessment of the quality of these plans found that all were less 
than optimal. Forty-six qualitative interviews were conducted with service 
users, family carers, paid carers and service managers as part of the process 
evaluation. Service users reported that they had learned to manage difficult 
situations and had gained new skills, and carers reported a positive 
relationship with therapists. At 36 months' follow-up (n = 184), the mean ABC-CT 
difference between arms was not significant (-3.70, 95% CI -9.25 to 1.85; 
p = 0.191). The initial cost-effectiveness of the intervention dissipated over 
time.
LIMITATIONS: The main limitations were low treatment fidelity and reach of the 
intervention.
CONCLUSIONS: Findings from the main study and the naturalistic follow-up suggest 
that staff training in PBS as delivered in this study is insufficient to achieve 
significant clinical gains beyond TAU in community ID services. Although there 
is an indication that training in PBS is potentially cost-effective, this is not 
maintained in the longer term. There is increased scope to develop new 
approaches to challenging behaviour as well as optimising the delivery of PBS in 
routine clinical practice.
