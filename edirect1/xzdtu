RESULTS: At 23-42% participation psr., the current NBCSP was predicted to reduce 
lifetime CRC incidence and mortality by 14-24% and 23-39%, respectively, be 
cost-effective (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio <$13,000/life-year saved), 
and be associated with a benefits-and-burden balance of 51-53 
number-needed-to-colonoscope (NNC) per CRC death prevented of . Lowering the 
screening start age to 40(45) would further reduce CRC incidence and CRC 
mortality by 7-11(4-5) percentage points, be cost-effective, and be associated 
with an incremental NNC- of > 95 (> 60).
CONCLUSION: For Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, the current NBCSP 
is cost-effective but participation is limited. Lowering the screening start age 
will further reduce CRC incidence and mortality.
POLICY SUMMARY: These findings highlight a need to increase NBCSP participation 
whilst exploring the feasibility and acceptability of lowering the NBCSP start 
age for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. These findings could 
inform new co-designed, community-led strategies to improve CRC outcomes for 
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples.

Sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase 2b (SERCA2b), a member of the SERCA 
family, is expressed ubiquitously and transports Ca2+ into the sarco/endoplasmic 
reticulum using the energy provided by ATP binding and hydrolysis. The crystal 
structure of SERCA2b in its Ca2+ - and ATP-bound (E1∙2Ca2+ -ATP) state and 
cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of the protein in its E1∙2Ca2+ 
-ATP and Ca2+ -unbound phosphorylated (E2P) states have provided essential 
insights into how the overall conformation and ATPase activity of SERCA2b is 
regulated by the transmembrane helix 11 and the subsequent luminal extension 
loop, both of which are specific to this isoform. More recently, our cryo-EM 
analysis has revealed that SERCA2b likely adopts open and closed conformations 
of the cytosolic domains in the Ca2+ -bound but ATP-free (E1∙2Ca2+ ) state, and 
that the closed conformation represents a state immediately prior to ATP 
binding. This review article summarizes the unique mechanisms underlying the 
conformational and functional regulation of SERCA2b.

Although healthy life expectancy is projected to be increasing among older 
people in Ghana, a high proportion and number of older people will live with 
functional disability, warranting their need for long-term care. We explored the 
expressions used by older people to describe their needs and preference of care 
and support. Using the descriptive qualitative approach, 14 older people were 
engaged via semi-structured interviews, and the data were analysed thematically. 
The study found that older people desired a decent accommodation, preferential 
healthcare, adequate nutrition, and an opportunity to interact with their peers 
at social functions. A provision of sufficient financial assistance, adequate 
healthcare, the periodic organisation of social and group events for older 
people, and the availability of home care and support could help older people 
address these needs. The paper reveals the need for interventional research on 
how a model incorporating social, health and environmental factors even during a 
pandemic can address older people's varying needs.

BACKGROUND: Advances in surgical techniques to tackle critical congenital heart 
diseases (CHD) have enhanced the survival rates and life expectancy of children 
born with heart disease. Studies to better acknowledge their neurodevelopmental 
trajectory have paramount implications.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to examine the nature of brain MRI findings 
in infants born with critical congenital heart diseases needing intervention in 
the first 6 months of life, with the help of an MRI scoring system and 
correlation with long term neurodevelopmental outcomes.
METHODS: Brain MRI scans of eligible infants were extracted from database, 
reexamined to categorize, and score them into three main functional areas: 
cognitive/grey matter, motor/white matter, and visual. The scoring system also 
included stage of myelination and presence of punctate hemorrhages. The 
correlation of individual and total MRI scores with neurodevelopmental 
assessment using Bayley Scales for Infant and Toddler Development- version 3 
(BSID III) were examined via logistic regression models while controlling for 
confounding variables.
RESULT: Median (IQR) MRI score was 6 (4-7) with grey matter score of 2 (1-4). 
Initial BSID III scores were 80 ± 15, 80 ± 18, and 81 ± 19 for cognitive, motor 
and language components, respectively. The MRI cognitive score had direct 
correlation with respiratory index prior to surgery (cc = 0.47, p = 0.03) and 
cross-clamping time (cc = 0.65, p = 0.001). It displayed a significant inverse 
correlation with language scores for BSID III at 9 months (R = -0.42, p = 0.04) 
which lost significance in subsequent visits.
CONCLUSION: This pilot study proved the feasibility of correlating structural 
brain abnormalities in MRI with later brain developmental deficits in infants 
with CHD. We envision establishing a standardized MRI scoring system to be 
performed on a large multi-center cohort that would help better predict and 
measure brain injury in infants with CHDs.

Although they are considered rare disorders, muscular dystrophies have a strong 
impact on people's health. Increased disease severity with age, frequently 
accompanied by the loss of ability to walk in some people, and the lack of 
treatment, have directed the researchers towards the development of more 
effective therapeutic strategies aimed to improve the quality of life and life 
expectancy, slow down the progression, and delay the onset or convert a severe 
phenotype into a milder one. Improved understanding of the complex pathology of 
these diseases together with the tremendous advances in molecular biology 
technologies has led to personalized therapeutic procedures. Different 
approaches that are currently under extensive investigation require more 
efficient, sensitive, and less invasive methods. Due to its remarkable 
analytical sensitivity, droplet digital PCR has become a promising tool for 
accurate measurement of biomarkers that monitor disease progression and 
quantification of various therapeutic efficiency and can be considered a tool 
for non-invasive prenatal diagnosis and newborn screening. Here, we summarize 
the recent applications of droplet digital PCR in muscular dystrophy research 
and discuss the factors that should be considered to get the best performance 
with this technology.

Along with the increase in life expectancy in the populations of developed and 
developing countries resulting from better access and improved health care, the 
number of patients with dementia, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), is 
growing. The disease was first diagnosed and described at the beginning of the 
20th century. However, to this day, there is no effective causal therapy, and 
symptomatic treatment often improves patients' quality of life only for a short 
time. The current pharmacological therapies are based mainly on the oldest 
hypotheses of the disease-cholinergic (drugs affecting the cholinergic system 
are available), the hypothesis of amyloid-β aggregation (an anti-amyloid drug 
was conditionally approved by the FDA in 2020), and one drug is an 
N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonist (memantine). Hypotheses about 
AD pathogenesis focus on the nervous system and the brain. As research 
progresses, it has become known that AD can be caused by diseases that have been 
experienced over the course of a lifetime, which could also affect other organs. 
In this review, we focus on the potential association of AD with the digestive 
system, primarily the gut microbiota. The role of diet quality in preventing and 
alleviating Alzheimer's disease is also discussed. The problem of 
neuroinflammation, which may be the result of microbiota disorders, is also 
described. An important aspect of the work is the chapter on the treatment 
strategies for changing the microbiota, potentially protecting against the 
disease and alleviating its course in the initial stages.

Organ transplantation remains the treatment of last resort in case of failure of 
a vital organ (lung, liver, heart, intestine) or non-vital organ (essentially 
the kidney and pancreas) for which supplementary treatments exist. It remains 
the best alternative both in terms of quality-of-life and life expectancy for 
patients and of public health expenditure. Unfortunately, organ shortage remains 
a widespread issue, as on average only about 25% of patients waiting for an 
organ are transplanted each year. This situation has led to the consideration of 
recent donor populations (deceased by brain death with extended criteria or 
deceased after circulatory arrest). These organs are sensitive to the conditions 
of conservation during the ischemia phase, which have an impact on the graft's 
short- and long-term fate. This evolution necessitates a more adapted management 
of organ donation and the optimization of preservation conditions. In this 
general review, the different aspects of preservation will be considered. 
Initially done by hypothermia with the help of specific solutions, preservation 
is evolving with oxygenated perfusion, in hypothermia or normothermia, aiming at 
maintaining tissue metabolism. Preservation time is also becoming a unique 
evaluation window to predict organ quality, allowing repair and/or optimization 
of recipient choice.

Stress is an inevitable part of life. An organism is exposed to multiple 
stresses and overcomes their negative consequences throughout its entire 
existence. A correlation was established between life expectancy and resistance 
to stress, suggesting a relationship between aging and the ability to respond to 
external adverse effects as well as quickly restore the normal regulation of 
biological processes. To combat stress, cells developed multiple pro-survival 
mechanisms, one of them is the assembly of special stress-induced membraneless 
organelles (MLOs). MLOs are formations that do not possess a lipid membrane but 
rather form as a result of the "liquid-liquid" phase separation (LLPS) of 
biopolymers. Stress-responsive MLOs were found in eukaryotes and prokaryotes, 
they form as a reaction to the acute environmental conditions and are dismantled 
after its termination. These compartments function to prevent damage to the 
genetic and protein material of the cell during stress. In this review, we 
discuss the characteristics of stress-induced MLO-like structures in eukaryotic 
and prokaryotic cells.

With the global increase of the elderly population, the improvement of the 
treatment for various aging-related diseases and the extension of a healthy 
lifespan have become some of the most important current medical issues. In order 
to understand the developmental mechanisms of aging and aging-related disorders, 
animal models are essential to conduct relevant studies. Among them, mice have 
become one of the most prevalently used model animals for aging-related studies 
due to their high similarity to humans in terms of genetic background and 
physiological structure, as well as their short lifespan and ease of 
reproduction. This review will discuss some of the common and emerging mouse 
models of accelerated aging and related chronic diseases in recent years, with 
the aim of serving as a reference for future application in fundamental and 
translational research.

Fermentation of various food stuffs by lactic acid bacteria is one of the oldest 
forms of food biopreservation. Bacterial antagonism has been recognized for over 
a century, but in recent years, this phenomenon has received more scientific 
attention, particularly in the use of various strains of lactic acid bacteria 
(LAB). Certain strains of LAB demonstrated antimicrobial activity against 
foodborne pathogens, including bacteria, yeast and filamentous fungi. 
Furthermore, in recent years, many authors proved that lactic acid bacteria have 
the ability to neutralize mycotoxin produced by the last group. Antimicrobial 
activity of lactic acid bacteria is mainly based on the production of 
metabolites such as lactic acid, organic acids, hydroperoxide and bacteriocins. 
In addition, some research suggests other mechanisms of antimicrobial activity 
of LAB against pathogens as well as their toxic metabolites. These properties 
are very important because of the future possibility to exchange chemical and 
physical methods of preservation with a biological method based on the lactic 
acid bacteria and their metabolites. Biopreservation is defined as the extension 
of shelf life and the increase in food safety by use of controlled 
microorganisms or their metabolites. This biological method may determine the 
alternative for the usage of chemical preservatives. In this study, the 
possibilities of the use of lactic acid bacteria against foodborne pathogens is 
provided. Our aim is to yield knowledge about lactic acid fermentation and the 
activity of lactic acid bacteria against pathogenic microorganisms. In addition, 
we would like to introduce actual information about health aspects associated 
with the consumption of fermented products, including probiotics.

Even though the European Union (EU) is considered one of the best performers in 
the world in fighting corruption, the situation changes when the analysis is 
shifted to the national dimension of its member states, with significant 
differences concerning the effects of corruption on population health. Using the 
theory of New Institutional Economics as a complementary tool that provides 
additional representativeness to this phenomenon, the aim of this paper is to 
empirically investigate the impact of corruption on population health, 
considering also other demographic and socio-economic determinants. Using data 
collected at the EU level registered between 2000-2019, we employ panel date 
models to validate the ongoing effect of perceived corruption on population 
health. Our empirical findings fully validate the institutionalist perspective, 
according to which countries with inclusive institutions better control the 
anomaly of corruption while benefitting from higher life expectancy and reducing 
child mortality rates. Conversely, the EU countries with rather extractive 
institutions suffer in terms of both longevity of population and infant 
mortality. Our study emphasizes that in tackling corruption pressure on 
population health, the most effective way is to improve the quality of 
governance in countries with fragile institutions.

The Human Development Index measures a region's development and is a step for 
development debate beyond the traditional, economic perspective. It can also 
determine the success of a country's response to the COVID-19 pandemic, mainly 
affecting the case fatality rate among severe cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We 
aimed to associate the Human Development Index with the case fatality rate due 
to COVID-19 in each Brazilian state and the Federal District, taking into 
account comorbidities and the need for invasive mechanical ventilation. We also 
evaluated the influence of the GINI index, number of intensive care unit beds, 
and occupied households in subnormal clusters on the case fatality rate. We 
performed an ecological study including two populations: COVID-19 individuals 
that did not require the mechanical ventilation protocol; and COVID-19 
individuals under invasive mechanical ventilation. We performed a Pearson 
correlation test and a univariate linear regression analysis on the relationship 
between Human Development Index, Human Development Index-Education Level, Human 
Development Index-Life Expectancy, and Human Development Index-Gross National 
Income per capita and COVID-19 deaths. The same analyses were performed using 
the other markers. We grouped the patients with COVID-19 according to 
comorbidities and the need for invasive mechanical ventilation. Alpha = 0.05. We 
included 848,501 COVID-19 individuals, out of which 153,710 needed invasive 
mechanical ventilation and 314,164 died, and 280,533 COVID-19 individuals 
without comorbidity, out of which 33,312 needed invasive mechanical ventilation 
and 73,723 died. We observed a low negative Pearson correlation between the 
Human Development Index and death and a moderate negative Pearson correlation 
between the Human Development Index and deaths of individuals on invasive 
mechanical ventilation, with or without comorbidity. The univariate linear 
analysis showed the case fatality rate depends on at least 20-40% of the Human 
Development Index. In Brazil, regions with a low Human Development Index 
demonstrated a higher case fatality rate due to COVID-19, mainly in individuals 
who needed invasive mechanical ventilation, than regions with a higher Human 
Development Index. Although other indexes studied, such as intensive care unit 
beds and GINI, were also associated with the COVID-19 case fatality rate, they 
were not as relevant as the Human Development Index. Brazil is a vast territory 
comprising cultural, social, and economic diversity, which mirrors the diversity 
of the Human Development Index. Brazil is a model nation for the study of the 
Human Development Index's influence on aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic, such as 
its impact on the case fatality rate.

BACKGROUND: Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is the sixth most 
common cancer worldwide with high recurrence, metastasis, and poor treatment 
outcome. Prognostic survival biomarkers can be a valid tool for assessing a 
patient's life expectancy and directing therapy toward specific targets. Recent 
studies have reported microRNA (miR) might play a critical role in regulating 
different types of cancer. The main miR used as a diagnostic and prognostic 
biomarker and reported in the scientific literature for HNSCC is miR-21. Other 
miRs have been investigated to a lesser extent (miR-99a, miR-99b, miR-100, 
miR-143, miR-155, miR-7, miR-424, miR-183), but among these, the one that has 
attracted major interest is the miR-31.
METHODS: The systematic review was conducted following the PRISMA guidelines 
using electronic databases, such as PubMed, Scopus, and the Cochrane Central 
Register of Controlled Trials, with the use of combinations of keywords, such as 
miR-31 AND HNSCC, microRNA AND HNSCC, and miR-31. The meta-analysis was 
performed using the RevMan 5.41 software (Cochrane Collaboration, Copenhagen, 
Denmark).
RESULTS: This search produced 721 records, which, after the elimination of 
duplicates and the application of the inclusion and exclusion criteria, led to 4 
articles. The meta-analysis was conducted by applying fixed-effects models, 
given the low rate of heterogeneity (I2 = 40%). The results of the meta-analysis 
report an aggregate hazard ratio (HR) for the overall survival (OS), between the 
highest and lowest miR-31 expression, of 1.59, with the relative intervals of 
confidence (1.22 2.07). Heterogeneity was evaluated through Chi2 = 5.04 df = 3 
(p = 0.17) and the Higgins index I2 = 40; testing for the overall effect was Z = 
3.44 (p = 0.00006). The forest plot shows us a worsening HR value of OS, in 
relation to the elevated expression of miR-31.
CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, the data resulting from the current meta-analysis 
suggest that miR-31 is associated with the prognosis of patients with HNSCC and 
that elevated miR-31 expression could predict a poor prognosis in patients with 
this type of neoplasm.

BACKGROUND: Long-term exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) may increase 
the risk of neonatal infections. To show the effects of PM2.5 on neonatal 
infections as well as the trends of the effect, we studied the burden measured 
by the age-standardized mortality rate (ASMR) and the age-standardized 
disability-adjusted life years rate (ASDR) and its trends with the 
socio-demographic index in 192 countries and regions from 1990 to 2019.
METHODS: This is a retrospective study that uses the Global Burden of Disease 
Study 2019 database. The age-standardized mortality rate and age-standardized 
disability-adjusted life years rate are used to measure the burden of 
PM2.5-related neonatal infections in different countries and regions. The annual 
percentage changes and the average annual percentage changes are used to reflect 
the trends over the years (1990-2019) and are calculated using a Joinpoint 
model. The relationship of the socio-demographic index with the ASMR and ASDR is 
calculated and described using Gaussian process regression.
RESULTS: With the rapid increase in the global annual average of PM2.5, the 
global burden of PM2.5-related neonatal infections has increased since 1990, 
especially in early neonates, boys, and low-middle SDI regions. Globally, the 
ASMR and ASDR of PM2.5-related neonatal infections in 2019 were 0.21 (95% CI: 
0.14, 0.31) and 19.06 (95% CI: 12.58, 27.52) per 100,000 people, respectively. 
From 1990 to 2019, the ASMR and ASDR increased by 72.58% and 73.30%, and their 
average annual percentage changes were 1.9 (95% CI: 1.3, 2.6) and 2.0 (95% CI: 
1.3, 2.6), respectively. When the socio-demographic index was more than 0.60, it 
was negatively related to the burden of PM2.5-related neonatal infections. 
Surprisingly, the burden in low SDI regions was lower than it was in low-middle 
and middle SDI regions, while high-middle and high-SDI regions showed decreasing 
trends.
INTERPRETATION: Boys bore a higher PM2.5-related neonatal burden, with male 
fetuses being more likely to be affected by prenatal exposure to PM2.5 and 
having less of a biological survival advantage. Poverty was the root cause of 
the burden. Higher SDI countries devoted more resources to improving air 
quality, the coverage of medical services, the accessibility of institutional 
delivery, and timely referral to reduce the disease burden. The burden in low 
SDI regions was lower than that in low-middle and middle SDI regions. One reason 
was that the benefits of medical services were lower than the harm to health 
caused by environmental pollution in low-middle and middle SDI regions. 
Moreover, the underreporting of data is more serious in low SDI countries.
CONCLUSIONS: In the past 30 years, the global burden of PM2.5-related neonatal 
infections has increased, especially in early neonates, boys, and low-middle SDI 
regions. The huge difference compared to higher SDI countries means that lower 
SDI countries have a long way to go to reduce the disease burden. Policy makers 
should appropriately allocate medical resources to boys and early newborns and 
pay more attention to data under-reporting in low SDI countries. In addition, it 
is very necessary to promulgate policies to prevent and control air pollution in 
countries with large and increasing exposure to PM2.5 pollution.

Barriers to smartphone use often exist among older adults, and increasing 
smartphone use is beneficial to increasing older adults' quality of life. 
Studies of older adults' smartphone use intentions have mostly adopted the 
technology acceptance model or unified theory of acceptance and use of 
technology (UTAUT). However, these models have their limitations. A meta-UTAUT 
has been developed, but it has not been extensively verified with older adults. 
This study used the meta-UTAUT model to explore the influences on older adults' 
smartphone use intentions and behaviors. A total of 311 adults aged 60 to 75 
years who had minimal experience with smartphones were recruited. They 
participated in a 16 h smartphone training and then completed a questionnaire. 
The results demonstrated that the meta-UTAUT model can predict older adults' 
smartphone use intentions and behaviors. Performance expectancy (PE) and social 
influence significantly influenced behavioral intention (BI) and attitude toward 
using smartphones (AT). PE was the strongest factor influencing BI. AT also 
affected BI. Although facilitating conditions did not significantly affect BI, 
they had a high influence on AT. To increase smartphone use among older adults, 
training can be implemented to teach smartphone skills and emphasize the 
benefits of using smartphones.

In 2020 COVID-19 caused 41,442 deaths in Poland. We aimed to estimate the burden 
of COVID-19 using years of potential life lost (YPLL) and quality-adjusted years 
of life lost (QALYL). YPLL were calculated by multiplying the number of deaths 
due to COVID-19 in the analyzed age/sex group by the residual life expectancy 
for that group. Standard and country-specific (local) life tables were used to 
calculate SPYLL and LPYLL, respectively. QALYL were calculated adjusting LPYLL 
due to COVID-19 death by age/sex specific utility values. Deaths from COVID-19 
in Poland in 2020 caused loss of 630,027 SPYLL, 436,361 LPYLL, and 270,572 
QALYL. The loss was greater among men and rose with age reaching the maximum 
among men aged 65-69 and among women aged 70-74. Burden of COVID-19 in terms of 
YPLL is proportionate to external-cause deaths and was higher than the burden of 
disease in the respiratory system. Differential effects by sex and age indicate 
important heterogeneities in the mortality effects of COVID-19 and justifies 
policies based not only on age, but also on sex. Comparison with YPLL due to 
other diseases showed that mortality from COVID-19 represents a substantial 
burden on both society and on individuals in Poland.

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common incurable autosomal recessive disease 
affecting the Caucasian population. As the prognosis for life extension of CF 
patients improves, co-morbidities, including kidney disease, become more common. 
Identifying those at the highest risk of kidney injury is therefore extremely 
important. The aim of this study was to evaluate the biomarkers of renal 
function in 50 CF patients using the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 
based on creatinine and cystatin C equation as well as serum creatinine (sCr), 
serum cystatin C (CysC), serum urea and urinary neutrophil gelatinase-associated 
lipocalin (uNGAL) concentrations. sCr, CysC, urea and uNGAL were estimated. eGFR 
was calculated according to the CKD-EPI formula. CysC was significantly 
increased, while eGFR was significantly lower in the CF group than in the 
controls (p < 0.001 and p < 0.01, respectively). There was no significant 
difference in the sCr, urea and uNGAL concentrations between patients with CF 
and healthy subjects. For the purpose of our analysis, in order to assess renal 
function in patients with CF in clinical practice, the concentration of serum 
CysC and eGFRCKD-EPI should be determined. Patients with CF presented with renal 
function impairment pictured by increased serum CysC and decreased eGFR values 
compared to controls. Unchanged uNGAL concentrations suggested preserved tubular 
function despite aminoglycoside treatment. Further prospective studies are 
needed to clarify whether kidney impairment observed in the course of CF 
progresses.

While life expectancy is increasing due to scientific advancement, quality of 
life in aging depends, among other factors, on the nutritional status and 
socioeconomic status of older adults. To determine socioeconomic status and its 
association with nutritional status as a predictor of food insecurity among 
older adults in southern Ecuador, a cross-sectional study of 188 older adults in 
urban areas and 212 in rural areas was conducted. Nutritional status, food 
insecurity, and socioeconomic status were measured. Data were analyzed using 
SPSS v 15.0 for descriptive statistics and bivariate analysis. Of the older 
participants, 59% had malnutrition, the majority women, and 24.7% were in 
poverty. Underweight was associated with low socioeconomic status for adults 
between 65 and 74 years old (OR = 7.710; CI 95% = 1.691-35.147), while obesity 
was associated with low socioeconomic status and non-manual labor (OR = 3.048; 
CI 95% = 1.268-7.326). Over 80% of older adults living in homes without children 
younger than 18 and at low socioeconomic status had food insecurity. The 
prevalence of underweight, overweight, and obesity points to widespread 
nutritional problems, especially in rural areas, that are significantly 
associated with low socioeconomic status. This demonstrates the need for 
multidisciplinary programs and government policies that can contribute to 
reducing food insecurity among the highly vulnerable older population.

People living with mental health conditions experience a significantly reduced 
life expectancy compared to people without, largely linked to health risk 
behaviours and associated chronic disease. Community managed organisations 
(CMOs) represent an important setting in which to address health risk behaviours 
among people with mental health conditions. However, little is known about how 
these behaviours (smoking, poor nutrition, alcohol consumption, inadequate 
physical activity, poor sleep: SNAPS) are being addressed in this setting. 
One-on-one, semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted with a sample of 
12 senior staff, representing 12 CMOs in New South Wales, Australia to: (1) 
explore types of support provided by CMOs to address the SNAPS behaviours of 
consumers living with a mental health condition; and (2) assess perceived 
organisational and staff level barriers and facilitators to providing such 
support. Transcribed interviews were analysed using inductive thematic analysis. 
This study found there was a range of supports offered by CMOs, and these 
differed by health risk behaviour. Findings suggest CMOs are well-placed to 
embed SNAPS supports as a part of their service provision; however, available 
funding, consistency of supports, workplace policies and culture, collaboration 
with other available supports, staff training and education, all impacted 
capacity.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer in the world. Despite 
improvement in standardized screening methods and the development of promising 
therapies, the 5-year survival rates are as low as 10% in the metastatic 
setting. The increasing life expectancy of the general population, higher rates 
of obesity, poor diet, and comorbidities contribute to the increasing trends in 
incidence. Drug repurposing offers an affordable solution to achieve new 
indications for previously approved drugs that could play a protagonist or 
adjuvant role in the treatment of CRC with the advantage of treating underlying 
comorbidities and decreasing chemotherapy toxicity. This review elaborates on 
the current data that supports drug repurposing as a feasible option for 
patients with CRC with a focus on the evidence and mechanism of action promising 
repurposed candidates that are widely used, including but not limited to 
anti-malarial, anti-helminthic, anti-inflammatory, anti-hypertensive, 
anti-hyperlipidemic, and anti-diabetic agents.

Background Malnutrition is a highly prevalent risk factor in hospitalized 
patients with chronic heart failure (CHF). A recent randomized trial found lower 
mortality and improved health outcomes when CHF patients with nutritional risk 
received individualized nutritional treatment. Objective To estimate the 
cost-effectiveness of individualized nutritional support in hospitalized 
patients with CHF. Methods This analysis used data from CHF patients at risk of 
malnutrition (N = 645) who were part of the Effect of Early Nutritional Therapy 
on Frailty, Functional Outcomes and Recovery of Undernourished Medical 
Inpatients Trial (EFFORT). Study patients with CHF were randomized into (i) an 
intervention group (individualized nutritional support to reach energy, protein, 
and micronutrient goals) or (ii) a control group (receiving standard hospital 
food). We used a Markov model with daily cycles (over a 6-month interval) to 
estimate hospital costs and health outcomes in the comparator groups, thus 
modeling cost-effectiveness ratios of nutritional interventions. Results With 
nutritional support, the modeled total additional cost over the 6-month interval 
was 15,159 Swiss Francs (SF). With an additional 5.77 life days, the overall 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for nutritional support vs. no nutritional 
support was 2625 SF per life day gained. In terms of complications, patients 
receiving nutritional support had a cost savings of 6214 SF and an additional 
4.11 life days without complications, yielding an incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio for avoided complications of 1513 SF per life day gained. Conclusions On 
the basis of a Markov model, this economic analysis found that in-hospital 
nutritional support for CHF patients increased life expectancy at an acceptable 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio.
