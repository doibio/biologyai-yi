BACKGROUND: The EuroQol five-dimensional questionnaire is a standardized 
instrument used in the economic evaluation of health care to measure health 
state preferences across disease groups. A time trade-off (TTO) approach is 
commonly used to elicit preferences from the public. However, there are issues 
regarding how best to measure worse-than-dead states; at present, extreme 
valuations are rounded up to more acceptable values. TTO elicitation is also 
cognitively demanding for respondents and is therefore expensive to investigate.
OBJECTIVES: To describe how the analytic hierarchy process approach could be 
used to generate utilities from the ordinal relationships between the health 
states instead of the ordinal relationships between health states, allowing 
potentially useful preference data to be incorporated rather than excluded as 
they are at present. It was applied to the Measurement and Valuation of Health 
study data set, measuring health state preferences for the United Kingdom.
METHODS: The analytic hierarchy process approach was explained. Five approaches 
to structure pairwise comparisons of health state preference were described (two 
concave, two convex, and one linear).
RESULTS: All approaches described predicted the rankings of health states well. 
However, utilities derived followed an unconventional, bunched shape compared 
with the original Measurement and Valuation of Health TTO study. An approach was 
identified by optimizing the parameters, minimizing the sum of squared errors 
between the ordinal "health state ranking" approach and the original TTO-derived 
utilities.
CONCLUSIONS: This approach outlined offers the potential to convert ordinal 
preference data into cardinal utilities. It is simpler than TTO studies to carry 
out and removes the need to directly alter results of the preference ranking 
exercise.

BACKGROUND: Utility values are required for economic evaluation using 
cost-utility analyses. Often, generic measures such as the EuroQol 
five-dimensional questionnaire are used, but this may not appropriately reflect 
the health-related quality of life of patients with cancer including 
myelofibrosis.
OBJECTIVE: To derive a condition-specific preference-based measure for 
myelofibrosis using appropriate existing measures, the Myelofibrosis-Symptom 
Assessment Form and the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of 
Cancer Quality of Life 30 Questionnaire.
METHODS: Data from the Controlled Myelofibrosis Study with Oral JAK Inhibitor 
Treatment trial (n = 309) were used to derive the health state classification 
system. Psychometric and factor analyses were used to determine the dimensions 
of the classification system. Psychometric and Rasch analyses were then used to 
select an item to represent each dimension. Item selection was validated with 
experts. A selection of health states was valued by members of the general 
population using time trade-off. Finally, health state values were modeled using 
regression analysis to produce utility values for every state.
RESULTS: The Myelofibrosis 8 dimensions has eight dimensions: physical 
functioning, emotional functioning, fatigue, itchiness, pain under ribs on the 
left side, abdominal discomfort, bone or muscle pain, and night sweats. 
Regression models were estimated using time trade-off data from 246 members of 
the general population valuing a total of 33 states. The best performing model 
was a random effects maximum likelihood model producing utility values ranging 
from 0.089 to 1.
CONCLUSIONS: The Myelofibrosis 8 dimensions is a condition-specific 
preference-based measure for myelofibrosis. This measure can be used to generate 
utility values for myelofibrosis for any data set containing the 
Myelofibrosis-Symptom Assessment Form and the European Organisation for Research 
and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life 30 Questionnaire data.

BACKGROUND: The key principles regarding what assessments lead to different 
types of guidance about the use of health technologies (Only in Research, 
Approval with Research, Approve, or Reject) provide an explicit and transparent 
framework for technology appraisal.
OBJECTIVE: We aim to demonstrate how these principles and assessments can be 
applied in practice through the use of a seven-point checklist of assessment.
METHODS: The value of access to a technology and the value of additional 
evidence are explored through the application of the checklist to the case 
studies of enhanced external counterpulsation for chronic stable angina and 
clopidogrel for the management of patients with non-ST-segment elevation acute 
coronary syndromes.
RESULTS: The case studies demonstrate the importance of considering 1) the 
expected cost-effectiveness and population net health effects; 2) the need for 
evidence and whether the type of research required can be conducted once a 
technology is approved for widespread use; 3) whether there are sources of 
uncertainty that cannot be resolved by research but only over time; and 4) 
whether there are significant (opportunity) costs that once committed by 
approval cannot be recovered.
CONCLUSIONS: The checklist demonstrates that cost-effectiveness is a necessary 
but not sufficient condition for approval. Only in Research may be appropriate 
when a technology is expected to be cost-effective due to significant 
irrecoverable costs. It is only approval that can be ruled out if a technology 
is not expected to be cost-effective. Lack of cost-effectiveness is not a 
necessary or sufficient condition for rejection.

BACKGROUND: HER2 positive (HER2+) metastatic breast cancer (MBC) is associated 
with high mortality. Trastuzumab was approved for use in 1998, but the 
life-years saved from first-line use are unknown, as are the potential US 
population benefits from adding pertuzumab.
OBJECTIVES: The first aim was to estimate the number of life-years saved by 
using first-line trastuzumab between 1999 and 2013 in HER2+ women with MBC. In 
addition, based on these estimates, the second aim was to project the life-years 
that could be saved by adding pertuzumab to trastuzumab in first-line therapy.
METHODS: We constructed a simulation model accounting for incidence, testing 
rates, therapy utilization, and overall survival. The model was run for 1999 to 
2013 (15 years) to estimate the life-years saved from using trastuzumab plus 
chemotherapy instead of chemotherapy alone. The model was also run from 2013 to 
2027 (15 years) to project the life-years that might be saved by adding 
pertuzumab. Uncertainty was incorporated using Monte-Carlo methods.
RESULTS: The estimated number of women with HER2+ MBC varied over time, with the 
peak of 9700 in 2005 and the low of 7700 in 2018. The cumulative incremental 
life-years saved because of first-line trastuzumab use from 1999 to 2013 was 
estimated to be 156,413 (95% simulation interval 114,840-195,201). The 
projection for pertuzumab from 2013 to 2027 was 137,959 (95% simulation interval 
56,011-225,069). Exploratory analyses of value showed that pertuzumab, 
trastuzumab, and chemotherapy is associated with a $1.10 billion gain compared 
with chemotherapy alone, and adding pertuzumab is associated with a $0.06 
billion gain compared with trastuzumab with chemotherapy.
CONCLUSIONS: This simulation model suggests that substantial progress has been 
made in treating HER2+ women over the past 15 years, and the future may witness 
similar gains with the introduction of pertuzumab.

Hearing loss is the most common sensory deficit in developed societies. Hearing 
impairment in children, particularly of prelingual onset, has been shown to 
negatively affect educational achievement, future employment and earnings, and 
even life expectancy. Sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL), which refers to defects 
within the cochlea or auditory nerve itself, far outweighs conductive causes for 
permanent hearing loss in both children and adults. The causes of SNHL in 
children are heterogeneous, including both congenital and acquired causes. This 
article identifies potential mechanisms of intervention both at the level of the 
hair cell and the spiral ganglion neurons.

BACKGROUND: Elective cataract surgery is the most commonly performed surgical 
procedure in developed countries. However, it is unclear whether cataract 
surgery on the second eye provides enough incremental benefit to be considered 
cost-effective. This study conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis of second-eye 
cataract surgery in the U.K.
DESIGN: A cost-effectiveness analysis.
METHODS: A decision-analytical model was developed to estimate the 
cost-effectiveness of second-eye cataract surgery, based on a comprehensive 
epidemiological and economic review to develop the parameters for the model. The 
model followed the clinical pathway of cohorts of patients receiving second-eye 
cataract surgery and included costs and health benefits associated with 
post-surgical complications.
RESULTS: In the model, second-eye surgery generated 0.68 additional 
quality-adjusted life years (QALY) with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
of £1,964 per QALY gained. In sensitivity analyses, model results were most 
sensitive to changes in the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) gain 
associated with second-eye surgery, but otherwise robust to changes in parameter 
values. The probability that second-eye surgery is cost-effective at willingness 
to pay thresholds of £10,000 and £20,000 was 100%.
CONCLUSION: Second-eye cataract surgery is generally cost-effective based on the 
best available data and under most assumptions. However, there are only a small 
number of clinical trials for second-eye cataract surgery, and these have not 
been conducted in recent years.

[THE MEDICAL DEMOGRAPHIC PROCESSES IN THE SIBERIAN FEDERAL OKRUG].

[Article in Russian]

Zakharenkov VV, Viblaia IV.

The article presents data testifying demographic problems in numerous okrugs of 
the Russian Federation. It is emphasized that in the Siberian federal okrug 
reside 13.48% of population of Russia. In spite of it younger age (by 1.4 years) 
and on the assumption of situation of 2011-2012. The life expectancy of males is 
lower by 2.35±0.01 years as compared with the rest of Russian male population 
and in females is lower by 1.84±0.02 years as compared with the rest of 
Russianfemale population. In Kemerovskaia oblast with numerous population, where 
the coal mining industry is a city-formingfactor males live less by 4.2 years 
than males in whole Russia. The higher levels of mortality of population of 
able-bodied age in the Kemerovskaia oblast as compared with the Siberian federal 
okrug and Russia are presented The results of comparative analysis are used to 
demonstrate that even partial implementation in Novokuznetsk, the largest city 
of the Kemerovskaia oblast, of program activities targeted to prevent 
occupational morbidity ofworkers of coal mining industry of Kuzbass impacted 
alteration of indicator of mortality of population of able-bodied age. It is 
stated that the research institute of complex problems of hygiene and 
occupational diseases of the Russian academy of medical sciences has at its 
disposal experience and scientific base to develop program activities targeted 
to health protection and maintenance of labor potential of population of various 
territorial formations of the Russian Federation. The official permit of 
applying new medical technology to evaluate occupational risks for health of 
workers of industrial enterprises is available.

Management of Ovarian Cancer in Elderly.

Giri SK(1), Nayak B.

Odisha, India- 753007.

As a result of increasing life expectancy, the cancer incidence in older 
population is on the rise. Ovarian cancer (OC) is predominantly the disease of 
elderly women. More than half of all OC occur in women older than 65 years. The 
incidence of the disease increases with the advancing age, peaking during 7(th) 
decade of life and remains elevated until the age of 80 years. With the changing 
demographic scenario the percentage of elderly patients is increasing and 
gynaecologic oncologists need to focus more on these patients and their specific 
needs. Due to their higher risk of morbidity and mortality compared to younger 
patients, elderly patients with advanced ovarian cancer are challenging to treat 
and are often treated less radically. Their outcome is impaired despite no 
consistent prognostic effect of age itself. To offer optimal radical management 
of the elderly women with ovarian cancer and to avoid suboptimal treatment, 
biological age and functional status need to be considered before individualized 
treatment plans are defined. Pretreatment assessment can be achieved by using 
different assessment tools. Patients can tolerate surgery and chemotherapy, as 
long as they are individually assessed for their medical, psychological, and 
functional capabilities before therapeutic intervention is initiated. 
Prospective trials involving elderly women with ovarian cancer are the need of 
the day to offer justified evidenced based optimal treatment for those who will 
be benefited from the treatment.

BACKGROUND: Learning and coping education strategies (LC) was implemented to 
enhance patient attendance in the cardiac rehabilitation programme. This study 
assessed the cost-utility of LC compared to standard education (standard) as 
part of a rehabilitation programme for patients with ischemic heart disease and 
heart failure.
METHODS: The study was conducted alongside a randomised controlled trial with 
825 patients who were allocated to LC or standard rehabilitation and followed 
for 5 months. The LC approach was identical to the standard approach in terms of 
physical training and education, but with the addition of individual interviews 
and weekly team evaluations by professionals. A societal cost perspective 
including the cost of intervention, health care, informal time and productivity 
loss was applied. Cost was based on a micro-costing approach for the 
intervention and national administrative registries for other cost categories. 
Quality adjusted life years (QALY) were based on SF-6D measurements at baseline, 
after intervention and follow-up using British preference weights. Multiple 
imputation was used to handle non-response on the SF-6D. Conventional cost 
effectiveness methodology was employed to estimate the net benefit of the LC and 
to illustrate cost effectiveness acceptability curves. The statistical analysis 
was based on means and bootstrapped standard errors.
RESULTS: An additional cost of DKK 6,043 (95% CI -5,697; 17,783) and a QALY gain 
of 0.005 (95% CI -0.001; 0.012) was estimated for LC. However, better utility 
scores in both arms were due to higher utility while receiving the intervention 
than better health after the intervention. The probability that LC would be 
cost-effective did not exceed 29% for any threshold values of willingness to pay 
per QALY. The alternative scenario analysis was restricted to a health care 
perspective and showed that the probability of cost-effectiveness increased to 
62% over the threshold values.
DISCUSSION: The LC was unlikely to be cost-effective within 5 months of 
follow-up from a societal perspective, but longer-term follow-up should be 
evaluated before a definite conclusion is drawn.
CONCLUSION: Future research should assess the LC strategies' long-term efficacy 
and cost-utility.

Reducing child and maternal mortality in order to meet the health-related 
Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) 4 and 5 remains a major challenge in 
Myanmar. Inadequate care during pregnancy and labour plays an important role in 
the maternal mortality rate in Myanmar. A Maternal and Child Health (MCH) 
Voucher Scheme comprising a subsidization for pregnant women to receive four 
antenatal care (ANC), delivery and postnatal care (PNC) free-of-charge was 
planned to help women overcome financial barriers in addition to raising 
awareness of ANC and delivery with skilled birth attendants (SBA), which can 
reduce the rate of maternal and neonatal death. This study is part of an ex-ante 
evaluation of a feasibility study of the MCH Voucher Scheme. A cost-utility 
analysis was conducted using a decision tree model to assess the cost per 
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) averted from the MCH Voucher Scheme 
compared with the current situation. Most input parameters were obtained from 
Myanmar context. From the base-case analysis, where the financial burden on 
households was fully subsidized, the MCH Voucher Scheme increased utilization 
for ANC from 73% up to 93% and for delivery from SBAs from 51% up to and 71%, 
respectively; hence, it is considered to be very cost-effective with an 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 381 027 kyats per DALY averted (2010, 
price year). From the probabilistic sensitivity analysis, the MCH Voucher Scheme 
had a 52% chance of being a cost-effective option at 1 GDP per capita threshold 
compared to the current situation. Given that the Voucher Scheme is currently 
being implemented in one township in Myanmar as a result of this study, ongoing 
evaluation of the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of this scheme is 
warranted.

While regional mortality inequalities in Germany tend to be relatively stable in 
the short run, over the course of the past century marked changes have occurred 
in the country's regional mortality patterns. These changes include not only the 
re-emergence of stark differences between eastern and western Germany after 
1970, which have almost disappeared again in the decades after the reunification 
of Germany in 1990; but also substantial changes in the disparities between 
northern and southern Germany. At the beginning of the twentieth century, the 
northern regions in Germany had the highest life expectancy levels, while the 
southern regions had the lowest. Today, this mortality pattern is reversed. In 
this paper, we study these long-term trends in spatial mortality disparities in 
Germany since 1910, and link them with theoretical considerations and existing 
research on the possible determinants of these patterns. Our findings support 
the view that the factors which contributed to shape spatial mortality variation 
have changed substantially over time, and suggest that the link between regional 
socioeconomic conditions and recorded mortality levels strengthened over the 
last 100 years.

Publisher: Regionale Unterschiede in der Sterblichkeit in Deutschland erweisen 
sich kurzfristig betrachtet als relativ stabil. Im Laufe des letzten 
Jahrhunderts wurden allerdings deutliche Veränderungen in den regionalen 
Sterblichkeitsmustern verzeichnet. Hierzu zählt nicht nur das Wiederauftreten 
ausgeprägter Ost-West-Unterschiede ab 1970, die in den Jahrzehnten nach der 
deutschen Wiedervereinigung 1990 fast wieder verschwunden sind. Vielmehr haben 
sich auch substanzielle Verschiebungen zwischen Nord- und Süddeutschland 
ergeben. Zu Beginn des 20. Jahrhunderts registrierten die norddeutschen Regionen 
die höchsten Lebenserwartungsniveaus, während die süddeutschen Landesteile die 
niedrigsten verzeichneten. Über die letzten 100 Jahre hat sich dieses räumliche 
Muster weitgehend umgekehrt. In diesem Beitrag analysieren wir die langfristigen 
Entwicklungen der räumlichen Mortalitätsunterschiede in Deutschland seit 1910. 
Die beobachteten Veränderungen setzen wir in Bezug zu theoretischen Überlegungen 
und existierenden Forschungsergebnissen zu möglichen Ursachen für regionale 
Mortalitätstrends. Unsere Ergebnisse zeigen auf, dass sich die Zusammensetzung 
der maßgeblich zur Entwicklung der regionalen Sterblichkeitsmuster beitragenden 
Faktoren über die Zeit erheblich verändert hat. Außerdem scheint sich der 
Zusammenhang zwischen regionalen sozioökonomischen Bedingungen und den 
registrierten Sterblichkeitsniveaus in den letzten 100 Jahren verstärkt zu 
haben.

Impact of Economic Conditions and Crises on Mortality and its Predictability.

Bohk C(1), Rau R(1).

To investigate how economic conditions and crises affect mortality and its 
predictability in industrialized countries, we review the related literature, 
and we forecast mortality developments in Spain, Hungary, and Russia-three 
countries which have recently undergone major transformation processes following 
the introduction of radical economic and political reforms. The results of our 
retrospective mortality forecasts from 1991 to 2009 suggest that our model can 
capture major changes in long-term mortality trends, and that the forecast 
errors it generates are usually smaller than those of other well-accepted 
models, like the Lee-Carter model and its coherent variant. This is because our 
approach is capable of modeling (1) dynamic shifts in survival improvements from 
younger to older ages over time, as well as (2) substantial changes in long-term 
trends by optionally complementing the extrapolated mortality trends in a 
country of interest with those of selected reference countries. However, the 
forecasting performance of our model is limited (like that of every model): 
e.g., if mortality becomes extremely volatile-as was the case in Russia after 
the dissolution of the Soviet Union-generating a precise forecast will depend 
more on luck than on methodology and expert judgment. In general, we conclude 
that, on their own, recent economic changes appear to have minor effects on life 
expectancy in industrialized countries, but that the effects of these changes 
are greater if they occur in conjunction with other major social and political 
changes.

Publisher: Um den Einfluss ökonomischer Bedingungen und Krisen auf die 
Sterblichkeit und ihre Vorhersagbarkeit in industrialisierten Ländern zu 
untersuchen, geben wir einerseits einen Einblick in bisherige 
Forschungsergebnisse und andererseits prognostizieren wir die Sterblichkeit in 
Spanien, Ungarn und Russland, drei Länder, die große Transformationsprozesse 
(inklusive ökonomischer und politischer Reformen) in den vergangenen Jahrzehnten 
erlebt haben. Die retrospektiven Sterblichkeitsprognosen von 1991 bis 2009 
zeigen, dass unser Prognosemodell Veränderungen im Langzeittrend einfangen kann 
und dass die Abweichungen von der tatsächlich eingetroffenen 
Sterblichkeitsentwicklung häufig geringer sind als die anderer weit verbreiteter 
Modelle (wie z. B. das Modell von Lee und Carter). Zwei methodische 
Besonderheiten scheinen dafür (ganz besonders) verantwortlich zu sein: Erstens 
kann unser Modell die dynamische Verschiebung starker 
Sterblichkeitsverbesserungen von jungen zu hohen Altern über die Zeit einfangen 
und zweitens kann es wesentliche Veränderungen im Langzeittrend modellieren, 
indem es optional den extrapolierten Trend in einem Land um extrapolierte Trends 
ausgewählter Referenzländer ergänzt. Gleichwohl kann aber auch die 
Vorhersageleistung unseres Modells unter bestimmten Prognosebedingungen 
limitiert sein: Wenn sich z. B. der Sterblichkeitstrend sehr sprunghaft 
verändert (wie z. B. in Russland in der Zeit nach der Auflösung der 
Sowjetunion), dann scheint eine genaue Vorhersage eher von Zufall als von 
methodischer und demografischer Expertise abzuhängen. Die vorliegende Analyse 
deutet generell darauf hin, dass der alleinige Einfluss ökonomischer 
Veränderungen auf die Lebenserwartung bei Geburt in industrialisierten Ländern 
eher klein zu sein scheint, sich dieser aber erhöhen kann sobald er mit anderen 
sozialen und politischen Transformationsprozessen einhergeht.

OBJECTIVES: The present study aimed to compare the projected long-term clinical 
and cost implications associated with liraglutide, sitagliptin and glimepiride 
in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus failing to achieve glycemic control on 
metformin monotherapy in France.
METHODS: Clinical input data for the modeling analysis were taken from two 
randomized, controlled trials (LIRA-DPP4 and LEAD-2). Long-term (patient 
lifetime) projections of clinical outcomes and direct costs (2013 Euros; €) were 
made using a validated computer simulation model of type 2 diabetes. Costs were 
taken from published France-specific sources. Future costs and clinical benefits 
were discounted at 3% annually. Sensitivity analyses were performed.
RESULTS: Liraglutide was associated with an increase in quality-adjusted life 
expectancy of 0.25 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and an increase in mean 
direct healthcare costs of €2558 per patient compared with sitagliptin. In the 
comparison with glimepiride, liraglutide was associated with an increase in 
quality-adjusted life expectancy of 0.23 QALYs and an increase in direct costs 
of €4695. Based on these estimates, liraglutide was associated with an 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of €10,275 per QALY gained vs 
sitagliptin and €20,709 per QALY gained vs glimepiride in France.
CONCLUSION: Calculated ICERs for both comparisons fell below the commonly quoted 
willingness-to-pay threshold of €30,000 per QALY gained. Therefore, liraglutide 
is likely to be cost-effective vs sitagliptin and glimepiride from a healthcare 
payer perspective in France.

[Arduous working conditions for beginners: when workplace prevention becomes an 
economic risk].

[Article in French]

Latil F.

The French law of 20.01.2014 recently instituted an arduous working conditions 
allowance. This innovated legislation is designed to improve the status of 
workers subject to arduous working conditions either by allowing lighter work 
schedules or job reclassification or early retirement. The impact of arduous 
working conditions on health has been clearly established, but no consensual 
solution has yet been proposed. Life expectancy without disability can differ by 
as much as 9 years between higher executives and manual workers, but the 
proposed solutions comprise a multitude of perverse effects. Workers may benefit 
from maintaining their arduous working conditions in order to preserve their 
right to early retirement. Companies do not necessarily have the desire or the 
resources to invest in prevention, which is the only consensually accepted 
effective measure, if they are also required to finance both training and 
retirement. In particular, management of the arduous working conditions 
allowance is very complex and entirely financed by companies. Consequently, 
company productivity can be impacted, leading to transfers of company 
headquarters, outsourcing to interim workers, replacement of jobs by automation. 
Unemployment could be the big winner of this conflict. Politically, arduous 
working conditions allowance appears to be very difficult to put into practice 
and can be considered to be more a promise by the government to the left and to 
the trade unions.

BACKGROUND: Studies suggest that cervical cancer screening practice in the 
United States is inefficient. The cost and health implications of nonadherence 
in the screening process compared with recommended guidelines are uncertain.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate the benefits, costs, and cost-effectiveness of current 
cervical cancer screening practice and assess the value of screening 
improvements.
DESIGN: Model-based cost-effectiveness analysis.
DATA SOURCES: New Mexico HPV Pap Registry; medical literature.
TARGET POPULATION: Cohort of women eligible for routine screening.
TIME HORIZON: Lifetime.
PERSPECTIVE: Societal.
INTERVENTION: Current cervical cancer screening practice; improved adherence to 
guidelines-based screening interval, triage testing, diagnostic referrals, and 
precancer treatment referrals.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Reductions in lifetime cervical cancer risk, quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs), lifetime costs, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios, and 
incremental net monetary benefits (INMBs).
RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: Current screening practice was associated with 
lower health benefit and was not cost-effective relative to guidelines-based 
strategies. Improvements in the screening process were associated with higher 
QALYs and small changes in costs. Perfect adherence to screening every 3 years 
with cytologic testing and adherence to colposcopy/biopsy referrals were 
associated with the highest INMBs ($759 and $741, respectively, at a 
willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000 per QALY gained); together, the INMB 
increased to $1645.
RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: Current screening practice was inefficient in 
100% of simulations. The rank ordering of screening improvements according to 
INMBs was stable over a range of screening inputs and willingness-to-pay 
thresholds.
LIMITATION: The effect of human papillomavirus vaccination was not considered.
CONCLUSIONS: The added health benefit of improving adherence to guidelines, 
especially the 3-year interval for cytologic screening and diagnostic follow-up, 
may justify additional investments in interventions to improve U.S. cervical 
cancer screening practice.

Ageing population is constantly increasing due to rising life expectancy; 
consequently, the percentage of the elderly patients with asthma is increasing, 
as well. Fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) is a biomarker of lung 
inflammation, and currently it is widely used in clinical practice for asthma 
diagnosis and monitoring. Yet, there are no data about normal values of FeNO in 
patients of more than 65 years of age with normal lung function. The aim of this 
study was to establish adult FeNO reference values for subjects older than 65 
years, according to the international guidelines. FeNO was measured in 303 
healthy, nonsmoking adults more than 65 years of age, with normal spirometry 
values measured using the online single-breath technique. The results were 
analyzed by chemiluminescent detection. The FeNO levels obtained range from 5.00 
to 29.9 ppb, with a mean value of 12.48 ± 2.80 ppb. A significant association of 
FeNO levels with age (p < 0.05) was observed. There was no difference in FeNO 
values between men and women unlike what was observed in younger patients. FeNO 
levels in healthy controls over 65 years of age are influenced by age as in 
younger adults. However, there is no difference in FeNO values in male and 
female seniors, in contrast with what was found in younger adults in other 
studies. These data can be useful for the clinician to interpret the values of 
FeNO assessed during clinical practice.

In this article, we aimed to review the literature on the clinics and management 
of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN). Intraductal papillary 
mucinous neoplasm of the pancreas is a mucin-producing cystic mass originating 
from the pancreatic ductal system. Approximately 25% of the pancreatic neoplasms 
resected surgically and 50% of pancreatic cysts detected incidentally are IPMNs. 
They can be benign or malignant in character, while malignant transformation of 
benign forms can be encountered. It is important to determine IPMNs in the early 
stages, implementation of appropriate treatment approaches, and follow-up to 
provide better prognosis. We reviewed the studies published in the English 
medical literature through PubMed and summarized the clinical features and 
current approaches to the treatment and follow-up of the IPMN. Due to the recent 
advances and widespread implementation of radiological imaging techniques, the 
incidental detection rate of IPMNs has increased significantly. The effective 
treatment of the disease is possible via the detailed diagnosis of the disease, 
determination of the prognostic factors, and a multidisciplinary approach. 
Recent literature also emphasized the molecular profile determination approaches 
for assessment of prognosis of patients with IPMN. Current knowledge on IPMN, a 
clinically important epidemiologic problem, shows that the treatment should be 
personalized considering the prognostic features and life expectancy of the 
patient.

Reconstruction of the right ventricular outflow tract with a homograft is an 
established surgical method in congenital heart disease. Studies from children 
and adolescents suggest that homograft durability is shorter than the life 
expectancy of the patient; therefore, durability in adults is addressed in this 
systematic review. The PubMed database was searched in May 2012 and repeated in 
May 2015 with the terms 'homograft AND pulmonary valve', generating 665 hits. We 
included only studies involving more than 50 patients with a mean or median age 
>18 years. Six studies with a cumulative total of 560 patients were included. 
The long-term mortality rate was 2-8.8% at 8.1-10 years. Reintervention was 
common during patients' life spans, with a 10-year event-free survival rate of 
78-80%. Early postoperative echocardiographic or magnetic resonance imaging 
defects appear to predict rapid homograft degeneration. Further studies on 
various malformations and risk markers for degeneration are needed to make 
qualified and accurate decisions regarding lifetime management.

Longevity can mostly be determined with relative accuracy from birth and death 
registers when available. Aging is a multifactorial process, much more difficult 
to quantitate. Every measurable physiological function declines with specific 
speeds over a wide range. The mechanisms involved are also different, genetic 
factors are of importance for longevity determinations. The best-known genes 
involved are the Sirtuins, active at the genetic and epigenetic level. Aging is 
multifactorial, not "coded" in the genome. There are, however, a number of 
well-studied physical and biological parameters involved in aging, which can be 
determined and quantitated. We shall try to identify parameters affecting 
longevity as well as aging and suggest some reasonable predictions for the 
future.

AIM: To compare the prevalence in residential aged care (RAC) of preventative 
and potentially inappropriate medications (PIMs) in those who died within 12 
months versus those alive after 12 months.
METHODS: Firstly, a cross-sectional survey of 6196 people living in RAC in 
Auckland. Secondly, a research physician searched electronic hospital records in 
one District Health Board for a sub-sample (n = 222) of these residents. Classes 
of medications and dates of death were obtained from the Ministry of Health 
databases. Those who died versus those alive at 12 months were compared.
RESULTS: Over half of the 6196 participants received antihypertensives and/or 
antiplatelet agents. Cardiovascular preventative medications were significantly 
more common in those who died within 12 months. Seventy percent in high-level 
care received psychotropics. PIMs were commonly used.
CONCLUSIONS: Use of preventative medications is common in RAC, especially during 
the last year of life. Psychotropics are very commonly used, despite being 
potentially inappropriate.
