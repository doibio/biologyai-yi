populations; weight-based dosing in obese patients; tailoring prophylaxis; 
accurate diagnosis of acute joint pain; managing chronic arthropathy; providing 
psychosocial support; consistency in definitions and assessment; and 
quantifiable outcome measures. Practice points included increased 
cross-specialty coordination and including psychologists and rheumatologists as 
part of comprehensive care teams; close collaboration between pediatric and 
adult centers to facilitate transition of care; systems such as telehealth that 
ensure continuity of care for remote populations; using pharmacokinetic data to 
tailor therapy; rapid and accurate diagnosis of acute joint pain; using data 
from bleeding registries to assess treatment effects and help with service 
planning; and ensuring consistency through benchmarking and standardization of 
HTCs.
SUMMARY: Achieving treatment equity, optimal outcomes and cost savings may be 
possible through investing in national governance structures, expanding the 
comprehensive model of care and implementing innovative solutions tailored to 
local needs.

PGRP (peptidoglycan recognition protein) is a conserved protein family that 
recognizes the peptidoglycan in bacterial cell wall and causes the activation of 
various innate immune responses. Previous studies have reported that PGRP-SCs in 
Drosophila dampen the activation of Immune Deficiency (Imd) pathway to microbial 
infection, and participate in the lifespan extension of the insects. To 
facilitate understanding the function of PGRP-SCs from an evolutionary angle, we 
identified and functionally characterized the PGRP-SC gene in the housefly Musca 
domestica, a species that has adapted to a septic environment much harsher than 
the natural habitat of Drosophila. The gene designated as MdPGRP-SC was found 
most abundantly expressed in the 3rd instar larvae, and is expressed at this 
developmental stage predominantly in the gut. MdPGRP-SC was virtually unchanged 
in whole larvae after a septic injury at the second larval instar, while two 
antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), diptericin and attacin, were upregulated in the 
first 24h but not later. Through dsRNA microinjection, MdPGRP-SC was knocked 
down by RNA interference (RNAi), and caused the significant increased expression 
of diptericin and attacin. The pupation of MdPGRP-SC-depleted larvae was 
severely suppressed compared to controls. Opposite to the expression trend of 
MdPGRP-SC, a spontaneous active expression of diptericin and attacin was found 
in pre-pupae but not in third instar larvae. Taken together, our study reveals 
that downregulation of MdPGRP-SC leads to the overexpression of the AMPs, and is 
involved in the larvae-to-pupa transition of housefly.

Life expectancy has increased in many countries as a result the world's 
population is aging. The projections indicate that the proportion of the elderly 
in a few decades will increase significantly. Aging carries with it a series of 
physiological changes; one of them is an imbalance in the hemostatic system. 
Thus the levels or activity of various proteins involved, such as most 
coagulation factors, natural anticoagulants and the fibrinolytic system are 
altered so that the hemostatic balance leans toward thrombosis. Also, platelet 
activity suggests a state of abnormal activation (P-selectin, beta 
thromboglobulin and platelet factor). In this review we will systematically 
examine the alterations in the hemostatic components that occur during aging. 
Therefore, understanding these hemostatic changes could contribute to developing 
strategies for the proper management of health in old age.

Genetics and pharmacology of longevity: the road to therapeutics for healthy 
aging.

Aging can be defined as the progressive decline in tissue and organismal 
function and the ability to respond to stress that occurs in association with 
homeostatic failure and the accumulation of molecular damage. Aging is the 
biggest risk factor for human disease and results in a wide range of aging 
pathologies. Although we do not completely understand the underlying molecular 
basis that drives the aging process, we have gained exceptional insights into 
the plasticity of life span and healthspan from the use of model organisms such 
as the worm Caenorhabditis elegans and the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. 
Single-gene mutations in key cellular pathways that regulate environmental 
sensing, and the response to stress, have been identified that prolong life span 
across evolution from yeast to mammals. These genetic manipulations also 
correlate with a delay in the onset of tissue and organismal dysfunction. While 
the molecular genetics of aging will remain a prosperous and attractive area of 
research in biogerontology, we are moving towards an era defined by the search 
for therapeutic drugs that promote healthy aging. Translational biogerontology 
will require incorporation of both therapeutic and pharmacological concepts. The 
use of model organisms will remain central to the quest for drug discovery, but 
as we uncover molecular processes regulated by repurposed drugs and 
polypharmacy, studies of pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics, drug-drug 
interactions, drug toxicity, and therapeutic index will slowly become more 
prevalent in aging research. As we move from genetics to pharmacology and 
therapeutics, studies will not only require demonstration of life span extension 
and an underlying molecular mechanism, but also the translational relevance for 
human health and disease prevention.

    Lancet Oncol. 2015 Sep;16(9):1013-5.

BACKGROUND: Epigenetic alterations have been strongly associated with tumour 
formation and resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs, and epigenetic modifications 
are an attractive target in cancer research. RRx-001 is activated by hypoxia and 
induces the generation of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species that can 
epigenetically modulate DNA methylation, histone deacetylation, and lysine 
demethylation. The aim of this phase 1 study was to assess the safety, 
tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of RRx-001.
METHODS: In this open-label, dose-escalation, phase 1 study, we recruited adult 
patients (aged >18 years) with histologically or cytologically confirmed 
diagnosis of advanced, malignant, incurable solid tumours from University of 
California at San Diego, CA, USA, and Sarah Cannon Research Institute, 
Nashville, TN, USA. Key eligibility criteria included evaluable disease, Eastern 
Cooperative Group performance status of 2 or less, an estimated life expectancy 
of at least 12 weeks, adequate laboratory parameters, discontinuation of all 
previous antineoplastic therapies at least 6 weeks before intervention, and no 
residual side-effects from previous therapies. Patients were assigned to receive 
intravenous infusions of RRx-001 at increasing doses (10 mg/m(2), 16·7 mg/m(2), 
24·6 mg/m(2), 33 mg/m(2), 55 mg/m(2), and 83 mg/m(2)) either once or 
twice-weekly for at least 4 weeks, with at least three patients per dose cohort 
and allowing a 2-week observation period before dose escalation. Samples for 
safety and pharmacokinetics analysis, including standard chemistry and 
haematological panels, were taken on each treatment day. The primary objective 
was to assess safety, tolerability, and dose-limiting toxic effects of RRx-001, 
to determine single-dose pharmacokinetics, and to identify a recommended dose 
for phase 2 trials. All analyses were done per protocol. Accrual is complete and 
follow-up is still on-going. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, 
number NCT01359982.
FINDINGS: Between Oct 10, 2011, and March 18, 2013, we enrolled 25 patients and 
treated six patients in the 10 mg/m(2) cohort, three patients in the 16·7 
mg/m(2) cohort, three patients in the 24·6 mg/m(2) cohort, four patients in the 
33 mg/m(2) cohort, three patients in the 55 mg/m(2), and six patients in the 83 
mg/m(2) cohort. Pain at the injection site, mostly grade 1 and grade 2, was the 
most common adverse event related to treatment, experienced by 21 (84%) 
patients. Other common drug-related adverse events included arm swelling or 
oedema (eight [32%] patients), and vein hardening (seven [28%] patients). No 
dose-limiting toxicities were observed. Time constraints related to management 
of infusion pain from RRx-001 resulted in a maximally feasible dose of 83 
mg/m(2). Of the 21 evaluable patients, one (5%) patient had a partial response, 
14 (67%) patients had stable disease, and six (29%) patients had progressive 
disease; all responses were across a variety of tumour types. Four patients who 
had received RRx-001 were subsequently rechallenged with a treatment that they 
had become refractory to; all four responded to the rechallenge.
INTERPRETATION: RRx-001 is a well-tolerated novel compound without clinically 
significant toxic effects at the tested doses. Preliminary evidence of activity 
is promising and, on the basis of all findings, a dose of 16·7 mg/m(2) was 
recommended as the targeted dose for phase 2 trials.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of screening 50- to 70-year-old 
adults for hearing loss in The Netherlands. We compared no screening, telephone 
screening, Internet screening, screening with a handheld screening device, and 
audiometric screening for various starting ages and a varying number of repeated 
screenings.
METHODS: The costs per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) for no screening and 
for 76 screening strategies were analyzed using a Markov model with cohort 
simulation for the year 2011. Screening was deemed to be cost-effective if the 
costs were less than €20,000/QALY.
RESULTS: Screening with a handheld screening device and audiometric screening 
were generally more costly but less effective than telephone and Internet 
screening. Internet screening strategies were slightly better than telephone 
screening strategies. Internet screening at age 50 years, repeated at ages 55, 
60, 65, and 70 years, was the most cost-effective strategy, costing €3699/QALY. 
At a threshold of €20,000/QALY, this strategy was with 100% certainty 
cost-effective compared with current practice and with 69% certainty the most 
cost-effective strategy among all strategies.
CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that Internet screening at age 50 years, 
repeated at ages 55, 60, 65, and 70 years, is the optimal strategy to screen for 
hearing loss and might be considered for nationwide implementation.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a 
cognitive-behavioral group training compared with a wait-list control for 
patients with unexplained physical symptoms (UPS).
METHODS: A probabilistic decision-analytic Markov model was developed with three 
health states (poor health, average health, and death) based on a cutoff score 
of the Physical Component Summary of the short-form 36 health survey. To assess 
the cost-effectiveness in terms of cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY), a 
societal perspective was adopted. The model consisted of cycles of 3 months and 
a time horizon of 4 years. Data for the model were derived from a randomized 
controlled trial, in which 162 patients with UPS were randomized either to 
cognitive-behavioral group training or to the wait-list control. Data were 
assessed at baseline and after the training of 3 months or after a wait-list 
period of 3 months. In addition, the training group was followed in an 
uncontrolled phase and assessed at 3 months and 1 year after the training.
RESULTS: After 4 years, the group training was in terms of cost-effectiveness 
"dominant" compared with the wait-list control; there was a positive effect of 
0.06 QALYs and a €828 reduction in costs. The cost-effectiveness improved with a 
longer time horizon. A threshold of €30,000/QALY was passed after 18 months. The 
group training was cost saving after 33 months.
CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive-behavioral group training is a cost-effective treatment 
compared with the wait-list control for patients with UPS.

BACKGROUND: Compared with new technologies, the redesign of care processes is 
generally considered less attractive to improve patient outcomes. Nevertheless, 
it might result in better patient outcomes, without further increasing costs. 
Because early initiation of treatment is of vital importance for patients with 
head and neck cancer (HNC), these care processes were redesigned.
OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to assess patient outcomes and cost-effectiveness 
of this redesign.
METHODS: An economic (Markov) model was constructed to evaluate the biopsy 
process of suspicious lesion under local instead of general anesthesia, and 
combining computed tomography and positron emission tomography for diagnostics 
and radiotherapy planning. Patients treated for HNC were included in the model 
stratified by disease location (larynx, oropharynx, hypopharynx, and oral 
cavity) and stage (I-II and III-IV). Probabilistic sensitivity analyses were 
performed.
RESULTS: Waiting time before treatment start reduced from 5 to 22 days for the 
included patient groups, resulting in 0.13 to 0.66 additional quality-adjusted 
life-years. The new workflow was cost-effective for all the included patient 
groups, using a ceiling ratio of €80,000 or €20,000. For patients treated for 
tumors located at the larynx and oral cavity, the new workflow resulted in 
additional quality-adjusted life-years, and costs decreased compared with the 
regular workflow. The health care payer benefited €14.1 million and €91.5 
million, respectively, when individual net monetary benefits were extrapolated 
to an organizational level and a national level.
CONCLUSIONS: The redesigned care process reduced the waiting time for the 
treatment of patients with HNC and proved cost-effective. Because care improved, 
implementation on a wider scale should be considered.

BACKGROUND: Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) therapy is a 
clinically safe, noninvasive, nonsystemic treatment for major depressive 
disorder.
OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of rTMS versus pharmacotherapy 
for the treatment of patients with major depressive disorder who have failed at 
least two adequate courses of antidepressant medications.
METHODS: A 3-year Markov microsimulation model with 2-monthly cycles was used to 
compare the costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) of rTMS and a mix of 
antidepressant medications (including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, 
serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, tricyclics, noradrenergic and 
specific serotonergic antidepressants, and monoamine oxidase inhibitors). The 
model synthesized data sourced from published literature, national cost reports, 
and expert opinions. Incremental cost-utility ratios were calculated, and 
uncertainty of the results was assessed using univariate and multivariate 
probabilistic sensitivity analyses.
RESULTS: Compared with pharmacotherapy, rTMS is a dominant/cost-effective 
alternative for patients with treatment-resistant depressive disorder. The model 
predicted that QALYs gained with rTMS were higher than those gained with 
antidepressant medications (1.25 vs. 1.18 QALYs) while costs were slightly less 
(AU $31,003 vs. AU $31,190). In the Australian context, at the 
willingness-to-pay threshold of AU $50,000 per QALY gain, the probability that 
rTMS was cost-effective was 73%. Sensitivity analyses confirmed the superiority 
of rTMS in terms of value for money compared with antidepressant medications.
CONCLUSIONS: Although both pharmacotherapy and rTMS are clinically effective 
treatments for major depressive disorder, rTMS is shown to outperform 
antidepressants in terms of cost-effectiveness for patients who have failed at 
least two adequate courses of antidepressant medications.

Harborview Medical Center Seattle, Seattle, WA, USA.

OBJECTIVE: To examine the cost-effectiveness of vancomycin versus linezolid in 
the empiric treatment of nosocomial pneumonias incorporating results from a 
recent prospective, double-blind, multicenter, controlled trial in adults with 
suspected methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) nosocomial 
pneumonia.
METHODS: A decision-analytic model examining the cost-effectiveness of linezolid 
versus vancomycin for the empiric treatment of nosocomial pneumonia was created. 
Publicly available cost, efficacy, and utility data populated relevant model 
variables. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis varied parameters in 10,000 
Monte-Carlo simulations, and univariate sensitivity analyses assessed the impact 
of model uncertainties and the robustness of our conclusions.
RESULTS: Results indicated that the cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) 
increased 6% ($22,594 vs. $23,860) by using linezolid versus vancomycin for 
nosocomial pneumonia. The incremental cost per QALY gained by using linezolid 
over vancomycin was $6,089, and the incremental cost per life saved was $68,615 
with the use of linezolid. Vancomycin dominated linezolid in the subset of 
patients with documented MRSA. The incremental cost per QALY gained using 
linezolid if no mortality benefit exists between agents or a 60-day time horizon 
was analyzed was $19,608,688 and $443,662, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Linezolid may be a cost-effective alternative to vancomycin in the 
empiric treatment of patients with suspected MRSA nosocomial pneumonia; however, 
results of our model were highly variable on a number of important variables and 
assumptions including mortality differences and time frame analyzed.

OBJECTIVE: To model the social distribution of quality-adjusted life expectancy 
(QALE) in England by combining survey data on health-related quality of life 
with administrative data on mortality.
METHODS: Health Survey for England data sets for 2010, 2011, and 2012 were 
pooled (n = 35,062) and used to model health-related quality of life as a 
function of sex, age, and socioeconomic status (SES). Office for National 
Statistics mortality rates were used to construct life tables for age-sex-SES 
groups. These quality-of-life and length-of-life estimates were then combined to 
predict QALE as a function of these characteristics. Missing data were imputed, 
and Monte-Carlo simulation was used to estimate standard errors. Sensitivity 
analysis was conducted to explore alternative regression models and measures of 
SES.
RESULTS: Socioeconomic inequality in QALE at birth was estimated at 11.87 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), with a sex difference of 1 QALY. When the 
socioeconomic-sex subgroups are ranked by QALE, a differential of 10.97 QALYs is 
found between the most and least healthy quintile groups. This differential can 
be broken down into a life expectancy difference of 7.28 years and a 
quality-of-life adjustment of 3.69 years.
CONCLUSIONS: The methods proposed in this article refine simple binary 
quality-adjustment measures such as the widely used disability-free life 
expectancy, providing a more accurate picture of overall health inequality in 
society than has hitherto been available. The predictions also lend themselves 
well to the task of evaluating the health inequality impact of interventions in 
the context of cost-effectiveness analysis.

BACKGROUND: Section 114 of the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 
1997 regulates the promotion of health economic information by pharmaceutical 
companies to US health plans. Greater clarity is important given demands by 
payers and other stakeholders for evidence of value.
OBJECTIVES: To develop hypothetical case studies of health economic promotions 
to examine legal and policy implications.
METHODS: We constructed for pedagogical purposes 10 categories of potential 
health economic promotions. We generated hypothetical case studies for each 
category, including questions about whether each might be allowable under 
Section 114. The case studies were developed around the following categories: 1) 
costing out on-label clinical end points; 2) promotion of a costing exercise to 
physicians working in an accountable care organization setting; 3) 
burden-of-illness claims; 4) economic analysis of a formulary restriction 
policy; 5) extrapolations to doses, populations, or settings not covered in 
trials; 6) adherence claims; 7) "utilization of care" as a secondary end point 
in randomized clinical trials; 8) costing out a competitor drug's adverse event; 
9) economic analysis of comparative effectiveness claims using an indirect 
treatment comparison; and 10) extrapolating from surrogate to long-term outcomes 
in an economic model.
DISCUSSION: Most cases seem to fall into a gray zone given haziness around what 
constitutes "competent and reliable evidence" and "directly relate[d]" to an 
approved indication. In practice, it is difficult to know what the section 
allows given the imprecision of the statute and lack of guidance about its 
scope.
CONCLUSION: Ideally, future guidance will provide clarity and flexibility.

BACKGROUND: A recent randomized controlled trial demonstrated the bioequivalence 
between universally applicable and AB0 compatible transfusion plasma in healthy 
volunteers. There was a limited change in coagulation factor levels and 
inhibitors before and after plasmapheresis and subsequent plasma transfusion. 
The aim of this extension trial was to investigate the true capacity of these 
plasma products to restore baseline levels of coagulation factors and inhibitors 
after plasma depletion in comparison to haemodilution induced by infusion of 
albumin solution.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fourteen healthy subjects, who completed both plasma 
transfusion periods, underwent an additional plasmapheresis (600 mL) followed by 
an infusion of 1200 mL albumin (3.125%) in a third period.
RESULTS: The fibrinogen levels, as well as other clotting factors (FII, FV, FVII 
and FXI), decreased by 10% after plasmapheresis, and subsequent infusion of 
albumin solution further aggravated this drop in clotting factors to 
approximately 20-25%. The clotting factors with a long half-life were not even 
restored 24 hours after infusion of albumin solution, whereas those with a short 
half-life were replenished by endogenous synthesis within 24 hours. In contrast, 
transfusion of either plasma product rapidly restored all clotting parameters 
and inhibitors (protein S and plasmin inhibitor) immediately after transfusion.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that albumin solution induces an enhanced 
dilution of clotting factors and inhibitors, whereas both plasma products 
quickly compensated for the experimental loss of these plasma proteins.

Methodological Aspects of Subjective Life Expectancy: Effects of 
Culture-Specific Reporting Heterogeneity Among Older Adults in the United 
States.

OBJECTIVES: Subjective life expectancy (SLE) has been suggested as a predictor 
of mortality and mortality-related behaviors. Although critical for culturally 
diverse societies, these findings do not consider cross-cultural methodological 
comparability. Culture-specific reporting heterogeneity is a well-known 
phenomenon introducing biases, and research on this issue with SLE is not 
established.
METHOD: Using data from the Health and Retirement Study, we examined reporting 
heterogeneity in SLE focusing on item nonresponse, focal points, and reports 
over time for five ethnic-cultural groups: non-Hispanic Whites, non-Hispanic 
Blacks, non-Hispanic other races, English-interviewed Hispanics, and 
Spanish-interviewed Hispanics.
RESULTS: On item nonresponse, Spanish-interviewed Hispanics said, "I don't 
know," to SLE significantly more than any other groups. Nearly half of the 
respondents chose 0, 50, or 100, making them focal points. However, the focal 
points differed: 50 for Whites, 100 for Blacks, and 0 for Spanish-interviewed 
Hispanics. The relationship of SLE measured at two time points was higher for 
Whites than minorities. Moreover, those who said "I don't know" to SLE showed 
higher subsequent mortality than those who gave an answer. SLE was not a 
significant mortality predictor for Hispanics.
DISCUSSION: Overall, SLE is not free from culture-specific reporting 
heterogeneity. This warrants further research about its culture-relevant 
measurement mechanisms.

Increasing life expectancy has made old age-related health problems like 
dementia and cognitive decline more prevalent, and these are rapidly becoming 
important causes of disability and poor quality of life, causing significant 
add-ons to health-care costs worldwide. Hypertension is the most important 
modifiable vascular risk factor for the development and progression of both 
cognitive decline and dementia. In many observational and randomized studies, 
antihypertensive therapies have been shown to be beneficial in slowing cognitive 
decline. However, due to observed discrepancies by these studies, there is a 
lack of consensus on the best antihypertensive strategy for the prevention or 
slowing of cognitive decline. It is also not clear whether the beneficial effect 
of antihypertensive therapy is due to the use of a specific class of agents or 
combination therapy. Thus, we present a comprehensive review of overall 
antihypertensive therapies and cognition and of the individual antihypertensive 
therapy classes with their specific protective mechanisms and available clinical 
evidence behind their effect on cognitive function.

Reduced reproduction has been shown to increase lifespan in many animals, yet 
the mechanisms behind this trade-off are unclear. We addressed this question by 
combining two distinct, direct means of life-extension via reduced reproduction, 
to test whether they were additive. In the lubber grasshopper, Romalea 
microptera, ovariectomized (OVX) individuals had a ~20% increase in lifespan and 
a doubling of storage relative to controls (Sham operated). Similarly, young 
female grasshoppers treated with RNAi against vitellogenin (the precursor to egg 
yolk protein) had increased fat body mass and halted ovarian growth. In this 
study, we compared VgRNAi to two control groups that do not reduce reproduction, 
namely buffer injection (Buffer) and injection with RNAi against a hexameric 
storage protein (Hex90RNAi). Each injection treatment was tested with and 
without ovariectomy. Hence, we tested feeding, storage, and lifespans in six 
groups: OVX and Buffer, OVX and Hex90RNAi, OVX and VgRNAi, Sham and Buffer, Sham 
and Hex90RNAi, and Sham and VgRNAi. Ovariectomized grasshoppers and VgRNAi 
grasshoppers each had similar reductions in feeding (~40%), increases in protein 
storage in the hemolymph (150-300%), and extensions in lifespan (13-21%). 
Ovariectomized grasshoppers had higher vitellogenin protein levels than did 
VgRNAi grasshoppers. Last but not least, when ovariectomy and VgRNAi were 
applied together, there was no greater effect on feeding, protein storage, or 
longevity. Hence, feeding regulation, and protein storage in insects, may be 
conserved components of life-extension via reduced reproduction.

OBJECTIVES: To determine the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in allergic 
rhinitis patients as well as identify contributory factors to patient's 
well-being.
METHODS: Cross-sectional study by multistage sampling. Four-month study duration 
(October 2013 to January 2014). The setting of the study was Kwara State, 
Nigeria, which has 16 local government areas with 3 senatorial districts, total 
land mass of 36,825km(2) with a population of 2,591,555. 132 consenting adults; 
66 of them have allergic rhinitis (AR) using Score for Allergic Rhinitis (SFAR) 
instrument and 66 were age- and gender-matched controls (χ(2)=0, d.f.=1, P=1 and 
χ(2)=1.24, d.f.=2, P=0.54, respectively). Information on HRQoL was obtained 
using the 14-parameter mini-rhinoconjunctivitis quality of life questionnaire 
(mini-RQLQ). Socio-demographic variables possibly contributory to patient's 
well-being were obtained. Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U tests were used to 
compare means.
RESULTS: The overall Total Symptom Score (TSS) was 3.37±0.9, while male and 
female allergic patients and control TSS were 3.61±1.0; 3.16±0.8, and 0.98±0.2; 
0.95±0.2, respectively. Effects of gender, marital status, senatorial districts, 
residential area and duration of symptoms had significant impact on the quality 
of life. The highest correlation with TSS and components of mini-RQOL 
questionnaire existed between nasal problems and other symptoms (r=0.866; 
0.868).
CONCLUSION: AR had appreciable impact on HRQoL of the participants. Gender, 
number of dependents, marital status, senatorial districts, residential area and 
duration of symptoms were major identifiable contributory factors to the 
patient's well-being.

[Cost-effectiveness Analysis of Panitumumab Plus mFOLFOX6 Compared to 
Bevacizumab Plus mFOLFOX6 for First-line Treatment of Patients with Wild-type 
RAS Metastatic Colorectal Cancer--Czech Republic Model Adaptation].

[Article in Czech]

Fínek J, Skoupá J, Jandová P.

BACKGROUND: Pharmacoeconomic assessments are a part of the decision process not 
only during reimbursement setting, but in clinical practice as well. The 
presented cost-effectiveness analysis assesses panitumumab+mFOLFOX6 vs. 
bevacizumab+mFOLFOX6 in 1st line treatment of patients with wildtype RAS 
metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) in the Czech environment.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The adaptation of a Markov model considers the healthcare 
perspective; clinical data (efficacy, healthcare utilization and adverse events) 
are derived from a head-to-head comparison (PEAK study). Health states included 
in the model: progression free on treatment, progression (with/ without active 
treatment), resection of metastases, disease-free after successful resection and 
death. Actual reimbursement levels were used to estimate costs, published 
literature to estimate duration of 2nd line treatment. The analysis assumes a 
lifetime horizon; uncertainty was limited by performing one-way and 
probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Analysis outcomes are life-years gained 
(LYG) and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs).
RESULTS: Panitumumab+mFOLFOX6 is more effective and more costly in 1st line 
patients with wildtype RAS mCRC. Incremental costs per QALY are 837,270 CZK, per 
LYG 615,022 CZK; however, below the willingness-to-pay threshold applied in the 
Czech Republic.
CONCLUSIONS: Panitumumab+mFOLFOX6 is cost-effective in 1st line treatment of 
patients with wildtype RAS mCRC compared to bevacizumab+mFOLFOX6 in the Czech 
setting.

Existing evidence on the association of telomere length with life expectancy and 
the risk of various age related diseases is discordant. This inconsistency in 
the data may be due to methodological factors, e.g., the differences in the 
techniques for measuring telomere length, cell harvesting, DNA isolation, and 
material. One of the general requirements to experiments concerned with the 
measurement of telomere length is the high quality of DNA samples under study. 
The current review considers the most common errors during the measurement of 
telomere length associated with the improper quality of the biological material.

Proteolytic enzymes may serve as promising targets for novel therapeutic 
treatment strategies seeking to impede cancer progression and metastasis. One 
such enzyme is cathepsin L (CTSL), a lysosomal cysteine protease. CTSL 
upregulation, a common occurrence in a variety of human cancers, has been widely 
correlated with metastatic aggressiveness and poor patient prognosis. In 
addition, CTSL has been implicated to contribute to cancer-associated 
osteolysis, a debilitating morbidity affecting both life expectancy and the 
quality of life. In this review, we highlight the mechanisms by which CTSL 
contributes to tumor progression and dissemination and discuss the therapeutic 
utility of CTSL intervention strategies aimed at impeding metastatic progression 
and bone resorption.

Dementia is receiving increasing attention from governments and politicians. 
Epidemiological research based on western European populations done 20 years ago 
provided key initial evidence for dementia policy making, but these estimates 
are now out of date because of changes in life expectancy, living conditions, 
and health profiles. To assess whether dementia occurrence has changed during 
the past 20-30 years, investigators of five different studies done in western 
Europe (Sweden [Stockholm and Gothenburg], the Netherlands [Rotterdam], the UK 
[England], and Spain [Zaragoza]) have compared dementia occurrence using 
consistent research methods between two timepoints in well-defined geographical 
areas. Findings from four of the five studies showed non-significant changes in 
overall dementia occurrence. The only significant reduction in overall 
prevalence was found in the study done in the UK, powered and designed 
explicitly from its outset to detect change across generations (decrease in 
prevalence of 22%; p=0.003). Findings from the study done in Zaragoza (Spain) 
showed a significant reduction in dementia prevalence in men (43%; p=0.0002). 
The studies estimating incidence done in Stockholm and Rotterdam reported 
non-significant reductions. Such reductions could be the outcomes from earlier 
population-level investments such as improved education and living conditions, 
and better prevention and treatment of vascular and chronic conditions. This 
evidence suggests that attention to optimum health early in life might benefit
