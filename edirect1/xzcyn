levels just to meet their daily needs", all of which weakens the immune system. 
Along with mental illness or substance abuse disorders, they are "incredibly 
vulnerable to this virus".
CONCLUSIONS: Health organizations are well aware of the risks involved in mental 
health. A large population of homeless people experience their pain and 
psychological distress intermittently. For low-income patients, the various 
borderline situations related to health/illness involve growing expectations 
regarding the basic needs. This is a serious concern when linked to the 
pandemic.

Cancer Screening in Patients Undergoing Maintenance Dialysis: Who, What, and 
When.

Cancer screening guidelines were developed for the general population with the 
aim of improving health outcomes through early detection. However, these 
screening recommendations are not generalizable to patients undergoing 
maintenance dialysis given that their life expectancy is often less than 5 
years. In addition, the performance characteristics of screening tests in 
patients treated by dialysis may not be the same as in the general population, 
leading to differences in these tests' sensitivity and specificity in detecting 
cancer. Survival benefits in patients receiving dialysis may also be tempered by 
increased risks of curative therapies. Given the uncertainties of cancer 
screening in patients treated by maintenance dialysis, an individualized 
approach to cancer screening is warranted. This approach should balance the 
patient's life expectancy and the potential benefits from screening with its 
potential costs and harm. The special circumstance of renal cell carcinoma in 
patients treated by dialysis is also discussed.

OBJECTIVE: To determine preference-based (utility) assessments of health-related 
quality of life (HRQoL) in kidney stone patients, and evaluate the association 
between these and disease specific, psychometric health status-based HRQoL 
scores (obtained via the Wisconsin Stone Quality of Life [WISQOL]).
METHODS: One hundred four adults with urolithiasis, as well as 78 young healthy 
adults without history of urolithiasis (controls) were consecutively enrolled, 
meeting the predetermined recruitment goal. Each participant completed the SF-36 
v2 (from which SF-6D utility is calculated) and EQ-5D questionnaires, while 
urolithiasis patients additionally completed the WISQOL. Relationship between 
health utility and WISQOL scores was evaluated using Pearson's test and 
multivariable linear regression analysis (MVA). Construct validity of the 
utilities for urolithiasis was assessed by comparing utilities for patients vs 
controls, and for symptomatic vs asymptomatic patients.
RESULTS: Mean (SD) WISQOL standard score, SF-6D, and EQ-5D utilities in stone 
patients respectively were 63 (29.1), 0.68 (0.16), and 0.83 (0.17). SF-6D and 
EQ-5D utilities significantly correlated with WISQOL standard score (Pearson's 
r = 0.87 and 0.58, respectively; each P <.0001). On MVA, WISQOL standard score 
was a significant predictor of SF-6D and EQ-5D utilities, explaining 72.1% and 
33.9% of the respective variances in the utilities. Median SF-6D and EQ-5D 
utility were significantly lower in patients vs controls (each P ≤.0009), and in 
symptomatic vs asymptomatic patients (each P ≤ .0002).
CONCLUSION: SF-6D, more so than EQ-5D utilities in urolithiasis patients are 
strongly associated with disease-specific WISQOL scores, suggesting they are 
optimal for preference-based HRQoL assessment in this population. Construct 
validity of the utilities in stone disease was demonstrated.

This report provides an overview and a comparison of the burden and management 
of fragility fractures in the largest five countries of the European Union plus 
Sweden (EU6). In 2017, new fragility fractures in the EU6 are estimated at 2.7 
million with an associated annual cost of €37.5 billion and a loss of 1.0 
million quality-adjusted life years.
INTRODUCTION: Osteoporosis is characterized by reduced bone mass and strength, 
which increases the risk of fragility fractures, which in turn, represent the 
main consequence of the disease. This report provides an overview and a 
comparison of the burden and management of fragility fractures in the largest 
five EU countries and Sweden (designated the EU6).
METHODS: A series of metrics describing the burden and management of fragility 
fractures were defined by a scientific steering committee. A working group 
performed the data collection and analysis. Data were collected from current 
literature, available retrospective data and public sources. Different methods 
were applied (e.g. standard statistics and health economic modelling), where 
appropriate, to perform the analysis for each metric.
RESULTS: Total fragility fractures in the EU6 are estimated to increase from 2.7 
million in 2017 to 3.3 million in 2030; a 23% increase. The resulting annual 
fracture-related costs (€37.5 billion in 2017) are expected to increase by 27%. 
An estimated 1.0 million quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were lost in 2017 
due to fragility fractures. The current disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) 
per 1000 individuals age 50 years or more were estimated at 21 years, which is 
higher than the estimates for stroke or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. 
The treatment gap (percentage of eligible individuals not receiving treatment 
with osteoporosis drugs) in the EU6 is estimated to be 73% for women and 63% for 
men; an increase of 17% since 2010. If all patients who fracture in the EU6 were 
enrolled into fracture liaison services, at least 19,000 fractures every year 
might be avoided.
CONCLUSIONS: Fracture-related burden is expected to increase over the coming 
decades. Given the substantial treatment gap and proven cost-effectiveness of 
fracture prevention schemes such as fracture liaison services, urgent action is 
needed to ensure that all individuals at high risk of fragility fracture are 
appropriately assessed and treated.

INTRODUCTION: Once-weekly semaglutide 1 mg is a novel glucagon-like peptide-1 
receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) for the treatment of type 2 diabetes that has 
demonstrated significantly greater reductions in glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) 
and body weight than the GLP-1 RA once-daily liraglutide 1.2 mg in the 
SUSTAIN 10 trial. The present analysis aimed to evaluate the long-term 
cost-effectiveness of once-weekly semaglutide 1 mg versus once-daily liraglutide 
1.2 mg from a UK healthcare payer perspective.
METHODS: Long-term outcomes were projected using the IQVIA CORE Diabetes Model 
(version 9.0), with baseline characteristics and treatment effects sourced from 
SUSTAIN 10. Patients were assumed to initiate treatment with GLP-1 RAs and 
continue treatment until HbA1c exceeded 7.5%, at which point GLP-1 RAs were 
discontinued and basal insulin was initiated. Pharmacy costs and costs of 
complications were measured in 2018 pounds sterling (GBP), with future costs and 
outcomes discounted at 3.5% per annum. Utilities were taken from published 
sources.
RESULTS: In the base-case analysis, once-weekly semaglutide 1 mg was associated 
with an increase in discounted life expectancy of 0.21 years and discounted 
quality-adjusted life expectancy of 0.30 quality-adjusted life-years, compared 
with once-daily liraglutide 1.2 mg. Clinical benefits were achieved at reduced 
costs, with lifetime cost savings of GBP 140 per patient with semaglutide versus 
liraglutide, owing to a reduction in diabetes-related complications, in 
particular cardiovascular disease (mean cost saving of GBP 279 per patient). 
Therefore, once-weekly semaglutide 1 mg was dominant compared with once-daily 
liraglutide 1.2 mg. The results of the sensitivity analyses were similar, 
demonstrating the robustness of the base-case analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: Once-weekly semaglutide 1 mg is a cost-effective treatment option 
versus once-daily liraglutide 1.2 mg, based on the SUSTAIN 10 trial, from a UK 
healthcare payer perspective.

INTRODUCTION: This study aimed to evaluate the short-term cost-effectiveness of 
insulin degludec 200 units/mL (degludec) versus insulin glargine 300 units/mL 
(glargine U300) from a Dutch societal perspective.
METHODS: A previously published model estimated costs [2018 euros (EUR)] and 
effectiveness [quality-adjusted life years (QALYs)] with degludec compared with 
glargine U300 over a 1-year time horizon. The model captured hypoglycaemia rates 
and insulin dosing. Clinical outcomes were informed by CONCLUDE (NCT03078478), a 
head-to-head randomised controlled trial in insulin-experienced patients with 
type 2 diabetes.
RESULTS: Treatment with degludec was associated with mean annual cost savings 
(EUR 24.71 per patient) relative to glargine U300, driven by a lower basal 
insulin dose and lower severe hypoglycaemia rate with degludec compared with 
glargine U300. Lower rates of non-severe nocturnal and severe hypoglycaemia 
resulted in improved effectiveness (+ 0.0045 QALYs) with degludec relative to 
glargine U300. In sensitivity analyses, changes to the vast majority of model 
parameters did not materially affect model outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: This short-term analysis, informed by the latest clinical trial 
evidence, demonstrated that degludec was a cost-effective treatment option 
relative to glargine U300. As such, our modelling analysis suggests that 
degludec would represent an efficient use of Dutch public healthcare resources 
in this patient population.

The increased access to effective anti-retroviral treatment (ART) has made HIV 
comparable to chronic disease in terms of life expectancy. The advances in 
scientific knowledge and, in particular, in management of HIV-infected pregnant 
woman have reduced the risk of mother-to-child transmission of HIV. The analysis 
of current research demonstrates that HIV has been a problem in terms of 
sexuality and reproduction. The needs related to sexuality and reproduction are 
crucial ones to overall health and well-being of HIV-infected population. The 
future research is to focus not only on how sexual relations and relationships 
of HIV-positive women are manifested, but also on how health care system is to 
provide adequate support to women in relation with sexuality and reproduction. 
The purpose of study was to apply analysis of current research on sexuality, 
sexual and contraceptive behavior and implementation of reproductive function in 
HIV-infected women and the conditions affecting this realization. The review of 
national and international scientific publications concerning such areas as 
gynecology, reproductive health, sexuality and reproductive behavior of 
HIV-positive women from indexed on-line journals and relevant websites using 
such search engines as PubMed and Google in 1997-2019. The sample included 34 
peer-reviewed qualitative studies, which covered 9523 HIV-positive surveyed 
women. The technique of interpretative meta-synthesis was applied to generalize 
and evaluate how experiences of HIV-positive women in sexuality and reproduction 
behavior have been described in qualitative studies. The effective 
anti-retroviral treatment has made HIV comparable to chronic disease in terms of 
life expectancy. The analysis of current research on this topic established that 
HIV was a problem in terms of sexuality and reproduction. The conditions that 
make the burden of HIV more severe are: HIV is an obstacle for starting and 
continuing relationship, providing sense of fear and loss. At the same time 
motherhood, spiritual beliefs, and supportive relationships made the burden of 
HIV easier. The HIV-positive test in women makes their sexual and reproductive 
health more complicated because of HIV status. Therefore, women face such unique 
challenges as problems in partnerships, sexual satisfaction and childbearing. 
The study results are important for developing optimal medical care to alleviate 
the burden of HIV infection. In addition to medical care, health care workers 
should consider social and psychological needs to support HIV-positive patients 
in improving their health and their sexual and reproductive health as well.

BACKGROUND: The risk/benefit ratio of using statins for primary prevention of 
cardiovascular (CV) events in elderly people has not been established. The main 
objectives of the present study are to assess the cost-effectiveness of statin 
cessation and to examine the non-inferiority of statin cessation in terms of 
mortality in patients aged 75 years and over, treated with statins for primary 
prevention of CV events.
METHODS: The "Statins in the elderly" (SITE) study is an ongoing 3-year 
follow-up, open-label comparative multi-centre, randomized clinical trial that 
is being conducted in two parallel groups in outpatient primary care offices. 
Participants meeting the following criteria are included: people aged 75 years 
and older being treated with statins as primary prevention for CV events, who 
provide informed consent. After randomization, patients in the statin-cessation 
strategy are instructed to withdraw their treatment. In the comparison strategy, 
patients continue their statin treatment at the usual dosage. The 
cost-effectiveness of the statin-cessation strategy compared to continuing 
statins will be estimated through the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life 
years (QALYs) gained at 36 months, from the perspective of the French healthcare 
system. Overall mortality will be the primary clinical endpoint. We assumed that 
the mortality rate at 3 years will be 15%. The sample size was computed to 
achieve 90% power in showing the non-inferiority of statin cessation, assuming a 
non-inferiority margin of 5% of the between-group difference in overall 
mortality. In total, the SITE study will include 2430 individuals.
DISCUSSION: There is some debate on the value of statins in people over 75 years 
old, especially for primary prevention of CV events, due to a lack of evidence 
of their efficacy in this population, potential compliance-related events, 
drug-drug interactions and side effects that could impair quality of life. Data 
from clinical trials guide the initiation of medication therapy for primary or 
secondary prevention of CV disease but do not define the timing, safety, or 
risks of discontinuing the agents. The SITE study is one of the first to examine 
whether treatment cessation is a cost-effective and a safe strategy in people of 
75 years and over, formerly treated with statins.

Oral frailty is defined as a decrease in oral function accompanied by a decrease 
in mental and physical functions. Studies showing that people with oral frailty 
are at high risk of physical frailty, sarcopenia, severe conditions requiring 
nursing care and death have been reported in Japan. An increase in life 
expectancy and maintenance of teeth result in a decrease in the effect of the 
number of teeth. In contrast, a decrease in oral function as a result of aging 
has been suggested to have major effects on dysfunction and mortality risk. The 
present report is a narrative review of major clinical studies on the 
relationships of the number of teeth, dentures, occlusion and oral function with 
longevity, with the aim of providing information for future studies centered on 
oral function in Japan or overseas. This review clearly shows the relationships 
of the number of teeth, dentures, and occlusion with health and longevity. 
Recent studies have shown that, besides maintenance of the number of teeth, 
attempting to maintain or increase oral function, having a good diet and 
maintaining nutritional status are all linked to general health. Decreased oral 
function is a major risk factor for developing malnutrition and sarcopenia. Oral 
frailty, a new concept that has been recently introduced in Japan, is considered 
to have major effects on dental and oral health policies in Japan, in the 
old-age group, and is expected to be reflected in the dental and oral health 
policies of various countries, as they also predict increased life expectancies.

A kind of wearable exoskeleton soft rehabilitation glove is proposed for the 
dementia in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients with loss of hand function, 
limited range of motion, and insufficient finger muscle strength to carry out 
rehabilitation exercise training in a passive or auxiliary way. A novel soft 
joint structure based on composite fabric material is introduced for the design 
of the soft glove with bionic method, and experiments are conducted to verify 
the effeteness of the proposed soft rehabilitation glove. The test results 
showed that when the fluid pressure was 0.42 MPa, the joint angle of MCP, PIP 
and DIP could be up to 81°, 98°, 72°, and produce output torque of 1.18Nm, 
1.44Nm and 1.82Nm respectively, which meets the requirements of the hand 
rehabilitation. A dynamic rehabilitation-training test of the rehabilitation 
glove was also carried out, and the results showed that the movement frequency 
of soft fingers could reach 30 times/min, which is sufficient for repetitive 
flexion/extension exercise. In order to verify the grasping characteristics of 
the soft glove for irregular objects, experiments were carried out. The 
experimental results showed that the bionic soft glove was dexterous in 
grasping, which conforms to the universal grasping characteristics of human 
hands, has the function of assisting daily life (ADL), and meets the 
requirements of rehabilitation.

BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate the health status of the 
Iranians following the sustainable development goals' (SDGs) introduction and 
the recent health reform implementation in Iran and to compare with those of the 
Middle East and North Africa region (MENA) and global average.
METHODS: This comparative study used secondary data to investigate 
socio-demographic and health status indicators. The sources included census, 
population-based surveys and death registries. Global and regional health status 
indicators were obtained from international databases including WHO, the World 
Bank and the Institute for Health Metric and Evaluation (IHME).
RESULTS: Life expectancy and human development index improved following the 
reform implementation. Among causes of death, 74.6% were attributed to 
non-communicable diseases (NCDs). There was an increasing trend in risk factors 
for NCDs in Iran, while at the same time neonatal, infant and under-5 mortality 
rates reduced. Compared to the MENA, Iran has a lower maternal mortality ratio, 
neonatal, infant, and under-5 mortality rates, and a higher life expectancy. 
NCDs and road traffic injuries accounted for a larger portion of 
disability-adjusted life years in Iran compared to the MENA and worldwide.
CONCLUSION: Actions against communicable diseases and road traffic injuries are 
required together with continued efforts to address NCDs. Although based on the 
results, Iran has relatively high rankings, there is a need to develop a roadmap 
to accelerate achieving global health goals and SDGs targets.

The average human life expectancy has increased globally, and continues to rise, 
owing to the substantive progress made in healthcare, medicine, sanitation, 
housing and education. This ultimately enriches society with a greater 
proportion of elderly people. Sustaining a healthy aged population is key to 
diminish the societal and economic impact of age-related infirmities. This is 
especially challenging because tissue function, and thus wellbeing, naturally 
progressively decline as humans age. With age increasing the risk of developing 
diseases, one of the therapeutic options is to interfere with the molecular and 
cellular pathways involved in age-related tissue dysfunction, which is in part 
caused by the accumulation of senescent cells. One strategy to prevent this 
could be using drugs that selectively kill these cells (senolytics). In 
parallel, some compounds have been identified that prevent or slow down the 
progression of senescence or some of its features (senostatics). Senolytic and 
senostatic therapies have been shown to be efficient in vivo, but they also have 
unwanted dose-dependent side effects, including toxicity. Important advances 
might be made using bioactive compounds from plants and foods (nutraceuticals) 
if, as is proposed, they offer similar effectiveness with fewer side effects. 
The focus of this review is on the use of nutraceuticals in interfering with 
cellular senescence.

IMPORTANCE: Guidelines recommend that women 75 years and older be informed of 
the benefits and harms of mammography before screening.
OBJECTIVE: To test the effects of receipt of a paper-based mammography screening 
decision aid (DA) for women 75 years and older on their screening decisions.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A cluster randomized clinical trial with 
clinician as the unit of randomization. All analyses were completed on an 
intent-to-treat basis. The setting was 11 primary care practices in 
Massachusetts or North Carolina. Of 1247 eligible women reached, 546 aged 75 to 
89 years without breast cancer or dementia who had a mammogram within 24 months 
but not within 6 months and saw 1 of 137 clinicians (herein referred to as PCPs) 
from November 3, 2014, to January 26, 2017, participated. A research assistant 
(RA) administered a previsit questionnaire on each participant's health, breast 
cancer risk factors, sociodemographic characteristics, and screening intentions. 
After the visit, the RA administered a postvisit questionnaire on screening 
intentions and knowledge.
INTERVENTIONS: Receipt of the DA (DA arm) or a home safety (HS) pamphlet 
(control arm) before a PCP visit.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Participants were followed up for 18 months for 
receipt of mammography screening (primary outcome). To examine the effects of 
the DA, marginal logistic regression models were fit using generalized 
estimating equations to allow for clustering by PCP. Adjusted probabilities and 
risk differences were estimated to account for clustering by PCP.
RESULTS: Of 546 women in the study, 283 (51.8%) received the DA. Patients in 
each arm were well matched; their mean (SD) age was 79.8 (3.7) years, 428 
(78.4%) were non-Hispanic white, 321 (of 543 [59.1%]) had completed college, and 
192 (35.2%) had less than a 10-year life expectancy. After 18 months, 9.1% (95% 
CI, 1.2%-16.9%) fewer women in the DA arm than in the control arm had undergone 
mammography screening (51.3% vs 60.4%; adjusted risk ratio, 0.84; 95% CI, 
0.75-0.95; P = .006). Women in the DA arm were more likely than those in the 
control arm to rate their screening intentions lower from previsit to postvisit 
(69 of 283 [adjusted %, 24.5%] vs 47 of 263 [adjusted %, 15.3%]), to be more 
knowledgeable about the benefits and harms of screening (86 [adjusted %, 25.5%] 
vs 32 [adjusted %, 11.7%]), and to have a documented discussion about 
mammography with their PCP (146 [adjusted %, 47.4%] vs 111 [adjusted %, 38.9%]). 
Almost all women in the DA arm (94.9%) would recommend the DA.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Providing women 75 years and older with a mammography 
screening DA before a PCP visit helps them make more informed screening 
decisions and leads to fewer women choosing to be screened, suggesting that the 
DA may help reduce overscreening.

Organ transplantation is the removal of an organ from one person (the donor), 
and placement into another (the recipient). Transplantation is performed in 
patients with end-stage organ failure and can increase life expectancy while 
also improving the patient's quality of life. The most commonly transplanted 
solid organ is the kidney, followed by the liver, heart, and lungs. Pancreatic 
and intestinal transplants are performed as well but are less common. More 
recently, vascularized composite allografts (VCAs, e.g., face, hand, penis) have 
been performed for reconstructive procedures. Non-vital tissues, such as bones, 
corneas, and tendons, may also be transplanted. Organ donations can arise from 
living or deceased donors, but deceased donors are more common. Deceased 
patients are the major contributor to donor organs, and the most common causes 
of death are cerebrovascular accidents followed closely by traumatic brain 
injuries. In recent years, opioid overdoses have become another significant 
source of deceased organ donation. The dead donor rule holds that patients must 
be declared dead before the harvesting of donor organs. Donations can arise from 
patients who have suffered brain death or circulatory death. Brain death is a 
clinical diagnosis, defined as the permanent loss of brain function. This 
condition requires an irreversible loss of consciousness, absence of brain stem 
reflexes, and a lack of spontaneous respiration. The diagnosis of brain death 
must be made before organ harvesting occurs. The definition of circulatory death 
is the irreversible loss of cardiopulmonary function. Donation after circulatory 
death has been increasing in attempts to address the demand/supply mismatch of 
donor organs worldwide. This process involves the withdrawal of life-sustaining 
treatment, followed by a declaration of death after permanent cessation of 
circulation. To avoid any conflicts of interest, the decision to withdraw care 
must take place before any discussion of organ donation, and members of the 
organ procurement/transplant teams should not be involved in the process of care 
withdrawal or the declaration of death. Living donations are less common but 
still serve to increase the existing donor pool. Over 7300 living donations were 
performed in the United States in 2019, saving patients from a potentially 
long-wait on the transplant list. The most frequently donated organ is a kidney, 
but portions of the liver or lung are transplanted as well. More recently, 
living donations of VCAs have been explored. There are three types of living 
donations, the most common being directed donation. In directed donations, the 
donor designates to whom their organ will be given - most frequently a family 
member or close social acquaintance. In non-directed donation, also-known-as 
altruistic donation, the donor does not specify a recipient, and the organ is 
matched to a patient in need. Paired donations are more complicated, but 
generally involved two (or more) patients with a willing donor who is not a 
match for them. The pairs are then grouped, and the organs are 'traded' to 
ensure that all patients receive a compatible transplant. Living donations are 
considered safe, as donation has shown limited harmful outcomes, but patients 
must be closely followed to assess for medical and psychological harm. Long-term 
studies have suggested no adverse psychological outcomes with a living donation, 
and high levels of overall life satisfaction, both for directed and non-directed 
donation. Non-donors - potential donors who were unable to donate due to a 
negative match or withdrawal from consideration - were found to have lower 
levels of life satisfaction than living donors. The number of patients awaiting 
organ transplantation far outstrips the availability of donor organs. In the 
United States, estimates are that a new patient is added to the transplant list 
every ten minutes, and twenty patients die every day while awaiting transplant. 
In 2019, surgeons performed nearly 40,000 transplants, but at the end of the 
year, over 110,000 patients remained on the waiting list. While there are 
multiple ways to consent to organ donation (including a signed donor 
designation, designation on a driver's license, or signed consent from the 
deceased's next-of-kin), the estimate is that only 30 to 40% of potential donors 
in the United States become actual organ donors. Approximately 80% of Americans 
support organ donation, but only 40% have an appropriate designation in place to 
donate their organs after death. This disconnect can be attributed, in part, to 
how the question of donation is presented. The United States operates under an 
opt-in system, where the default is not to be an organ donor, and an active 
action is necessary to become an organ donor. In an alternative strategy, 
the presumed consent system, citizens are designated as organ donors unless they 
elect to opt-out. This strategy, commonly used in retirement savings, has shown 
mixed results in practice, with increased organ donation in countries with very 
low rates, but no significant increase in others. Critics of this strategy argue 
that the policy is unethical, as failing to object is not equivalent to informed 
consent. Others have shown that increasing the pool of potential donors will not 
increase the number of transplants performed if the proper infrastructure is not 
in place.

945. Femoral Shaft Fractures.

Fractures of the femoral shaft are one of the most common injuries treated by 
orthopedic surgeons. These fractures are often associated with polytrauma and 
can be life-threatening. They commonly result from high-energy mechanisms such 
as motor vehicle collisions (MVC) with sequelae of limb shortening and 
deformities if not treated appropriately. Femoral shaft fractures (FSF) 
typically occur in a bimodal distribution, high-energy trauma in the young 
population, and lower energy trauma in the elderly population. FSFs are also 
associated with other comorbidities necessitating a thorough advanced trauma 
life support (ATLS) assessment and interdisciplinary care. Intramedullary 
nailing (IMN) is the most common treatment for physiologically stable patients. 
The goal of fixation is early healing and long-term functional recovery. 
Treatment of modern-day femoral shaft fractures results in excellent outcomes. 
Anatomy Proximally, the femur is composed of a specialized metaphyseal region 
consisting of the head, neck, and greater and lesser trochanters. Distally, the 
femur comprises the metaphyseal flare, which continues into the medial and 
lateral femoral condyles, separated by the intercondylar notch. The shaft, or 
diaphysis, is the segment inferior to the lesser and ending at the metaphyseal 
flair and condyles. Classically the first 5 cm distal to the lesser trochanter 
is termed the subtrochanteric region and is considered a separate fracture 
pattern. These fractures are challenging to manage secondary to the muscular 
deforming forces. They will not be discussed in this article. According to 
the Arbeitsgemeinschaft für Osteosynthesefragen (AO) classification of 
fractures, the femoral shaft begins at the inferior border of the lesser 
trochanter. It ends proximal to the condyles at a distance equal to the greatest 
width of the femoral condyles.  The diaphysis is a smooth cylinder with 
differences in cortical thickness throughout its length, which may help assess 
intraoperative femoral rotation. The femur is bowed anteriorly with an average 
radius of curvature 120 cm (+/- 36 cm); the shorter the radius, the greater the 
bow. The linea aspera is the major cortical thickening along the posterior 
aspect of the femur and is an attachment site for muscles and the medial and 
lateral intermuscular septa and acts as a compressive cortical strut.  Three 
abundant muscular compartments envelop the femur. The anterior or extensor 
compartment is responsible for knee extension and houses the femoral nerve. The 
posterior or flexor compartment is responsible for knee flexion and houses the 
sciatic nerve. The medial compartment houses the adductor muscles. In FSF, the 
sciatic nerve and specifically the peroneal division are at the highest risk of 
injury because they lay close to the femoral shaft. The adductor compartment 
houses the obturator nerve. The gluteal muscles also surround and attach to the 
proximal femur and shaft; they include the gluteus maximus, medius, and minimus 
and cover the superior and inferior gluteal nerves. In FSF, the muscles are 
deforming forces on the fracture fragments depending on the location of the 
fracture. Generally, the proximal segment is flexed, abducted, and externally 
rotated by the iliopsoas and hip abductors. The distal segment is pulled 
proximally (shortened) by the quadriceps and hamstrings and adducted by the 
adductor muscles.  The main blood supply to the femur derives from the femoral 
artery, a continuation of the external iliac artery. The femoral artery passes 
under the mid-portion of the inguinal ligament and divides into the superficial 
femoral artery (SFA) and deep femoral artery (DFA), also known as the profunda 
femoris. The SFA supplies the tissues below the knee, and the DFA supplies the 
femoral shaft and the surrounding soft tissues. Multiple branches arise from the 
DFA, most notably the perforating arteries that encircle the femur. One or 
multiple nutrient arteries arise from the DFA or its branches to supply the 
inner 2/3 of the cortex and bone marrow. They anastomose with the 
metaphyseal-epiphyseal system. The periosteal blood supply supplies the outer 
one-third of the cortex.

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive (AR) disorder that commonly 
affects the White population with an annual incidence of approximately 1 in 
3,500 live births. This multisystem disorder is characterized by genetic 
mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene 
on chromosome 7, which encrypts a protein essential for the regulation of 
transmembrane chloride reabsorption. CFTR, a chloride channel, is expressed in 
secretory epithelial cells lining the airways, digestive system, reproductive 
system, and the skin. Homozygous mutations in the CFTR gene impairs the 
transport of chloride ions and the movement of water into and out of cells 
resulting in the inspissation of secretions leading to organ dysfunction. 
Although CF commonly affects the airways, approximately 10% to 15% of patients 
with CF demonstrate Cystic fibrosis-associated liver disease (CFLD). The 
improvement in the diagnostic modalities and management of CF that has had a 
positive impact on the life expectancy of patients with CF. Consequently, there 
has been a significant emergence of liver dysfunction in CF complicating the 
clinical course of the disease. CFTR dysfunction has a significant effect on 
cholangiocyte function causing an alteration in the final bile composition that 
causes chronic damage to the biliary epithelium resulting in the development of 
a broad spectrum of hepatobiliary complications ranging from cholestasis, 
progressive periportal fibrosis, biliary obstruction causing focal biliary 
cirrhosis which may progress to multinodular cirrhosis, portal hypertension, and 
hepatic decompensation.

Erikson’s Stages of Psychosocial Development is a theory introduced in the 1950s 
by the psychologist and psychoanalyst Erik Erikson. It built upon Freud’s theory 
of psychosexual development by drawing parallels in childhood stages while 
expanding it to include the influence of social dynamics as well as the 
extension of psychosocial development into adulthood. It posits eight sequential 
stages of individual human development influenced by biological, psychological, 
and social factors throughout the lifespan. This bio-psychosocial approach has 
influenced several fields of study, including gerontology, personality 
development, identity formation, life cycle development, and more.

OBJECTIVE: Schizophrenia is associated with excess medical mortality: patients 
have an average life expectancy one to two decades shorter than the general 
population. This study investigates the relationship between aberrant 
hippocampal resting-state functional connectivity in schizophrenia and 
cumulative subclinical effects of chronic stress on metabolic, cardiovascular, 
and immune function using the allostatic load index.
METHODS: Cumulative stress was estimated using allostatic load total score 
(range, 0-13) in 46 patients with schizophrenia and 31 controls matched for age 
and sex (patients: age = 36.1 [13.7] years, sex = 32/14 male/female; controls: 
age = 35.5 [14.1], sex = 21/10 male/female). Hippocampal functional connectivity 
was assessed using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging; 
hippocampal structural connectivity was assessed using fornix fractional 
anisotropy. Linear regression analysis was used a) to test the hypothesis that 
aberrant hippocampal resting-state functional connectivity in schizophrenia 
(identified in analysis of schizophrenia - control differences) is associated 
with elevated allostatic load scores in patients and b) to determine the 
association between fornix fractional anisotropy with allostatic load.
RESULTS: In patients, higher allostatic load was significantly associated with 
reduced resting functional connectivity between the left hippocampus and right 
cingulate cortex and left precentral gyrus, but higher connectivity between the 
right hippocampus and left cerebellum lobe VI (corrected p values <. 05). In 
controls, reductions in both hippocampal structural connectivity and 
hippocampal-cingulate functional connectivity were associated with higher 
allostatic load scores.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings support basic neuroscience evidence that cumulative 
stress and hippocampal function are closely connected and suggest that abnormal 
hippocampal functional communication in schizophrenia may be related to elevated 
multisystem subclinical medical issues in patients as indexed by allostatic 
load.

African Conceptions of Age-Based Moral Standing: Anchoring Values to Regional 
Realities.

Jecker NS.

Is age discrimination ethically objectionable? One puzzle is that we sometimes 
assume that the target of both age discrimination and ageism must be older 
people, yet in poorer nations, older people are generally shown more respect. 
This article explores the ethical question. It looks first at ethical arguments 
favoring age discrimination toward younger people in low-income, less 
industrialized countries of the global South, using sub-Saharan Africa as an
