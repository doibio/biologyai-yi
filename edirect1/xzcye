Ministry of Health and Social Affairs. Several interviews with community and 
church leaders as well as with members of catholic missions were carried out to 
better understand the local situation. Following this, a nationwide 
cross-sectional survey of a sample of 2064 students will be carried out. This 
will include a questionnaire on socio-demographic characteristics, lifestyles, 
health behaviors/attitudes, alcohol and illicit substances consumption. Finally, 
based on the overall diagnosis obtained, some edutainment health communication 
preventive interventions will be tested in the primary schools of three 
districts (EDUCA_TURTLE) and on the radio journalists (EDUCA_PRESS). These were 
evaluated by primary school teachers and by radio journalists.

Publisher: Introdução: São Tomé e Príncipe é um País Africano de Língua Oficial 
Portuguesa, de rendimento baixo-médio, onde a extrema pobreza potencia grandes 
desigualdades em saúde. Pouco se sabe sobre o consumo de álcool e substâncias 
ilícitas, além dos indicadores de importação e distribuição pela população. Não 
existem estudos realizados sobre este tema em crianças e adolescentes e são 
desconhecidas quaisquer medidas preventivas. Além disso, as bases de dados 
manuais apresentam limitações significativas, perante a inexistência de causas 
associadas às taxas de mortalidade (0 - 5 anos e > 5), e incapacidade de 
estabelecer uma relação causa-efeito entre doenças e morte e esperança média de 
vida. Inexistência de dados relativo às causas de mortalidade nos relatórios do 
Centro Nacional de Endemias ou nos relatórios da organização não-governamental 
Instituto Marquês de Valle Flor, entidade facilitadora de cuidados de saúde em 
especialidades clínicas selecionadas em regime de voluntariado de médicos de 
hospitais Portugueses. Propusemos assim realizar o primeiro diagnóstico de 
situação familiar e condições de habitação, e sobretudo, sobre o consumo 
de álcool e de substâncias ilícitas nos jovens. Neste sentido, foi desenvolvido 
o Inquérito Nacional sobre o Consumo de Álcool e Drogas em Meio Escolar em São 
Tomé e Príncipe para melhor caraterização da situação na população escolar, e 
para testar estratégias de comunicação em saúde e intervenções preventivas 
adaptadas às realidades socioculturais das populações-alvo. Foram considerados o 
dialeto, as famílias monoparentais, (estrutura matriarcal) a poligamia 
(sobretudo nos homens) num país e com governos liderados por homens (estrutura 
patriarcal), onde o papel da mulher, como refere a Organização das Nações Unidas 
para a Alimentação e a Agricultura, continua esquecido. Posteriormente 
procederemos à recolha de amostras de álcoois tradicionais, nas duas 
principais ilhas, para análise (pelo Laboratório de Estudos Farmacêuticos e 
Laboratório Nacional de Engenharia Civil) e determinar os metais pesados no 
processo de produção e impacto na esperança média de vida.Material e Métodos: 
Revisão da literatura nas bases de dados eletrónicas da Organização Mundial da 
Saúde, Organização Mundial da Saúde África, Organização das Nações Unidas, 
SCOPUS, MEDLINE, The Lancet e Lancet Global Health. Também considerámos 
e analisámos os dados disponíveis no Instituto Nacional de Estatística, 
Ministério das Finanças, Estatísticas da Educação, Ministério da Educação, 
Cultura e Formação, Estatística da Saúde, Ministério da Saúde e Assuntos Sociais 
do XV Governo de Iniciativa Presidencial 2013-14. Serão realizadas algumas 
entrevistas qualitativas aos líderes de todas as comunidades, à igreja e missões 
católicas com intervenção humanitária e apoio aos mais desfavorecidos. 
Posteriormente, aplicação de um questionário biográfico, demográfico 
e socioeconómico sobre o uso de substâncias lícitas e ilícitas a uma amostra de 
2064 estudantes. Foram consideradas as caraterísticasdemográficas, sociais e 
culturais. Após resultados e conclusões, iremos ensaiar algumas intervenções 
preventivas de comunicação em saúde como o edutainment nas escolas primárias de 
três distritos (EDUCA_TARTARUGA) e com os jornalistas de rádio (EDUCA_PRESS), as 
quais serão avaliadas pelos professores primários e pelos jornalistas de rádio.

BACKGROUND: Given uncertainty surrounding benefits and harms, shifts in patient 
health status, and changing patient goals and preferences, statin deprescribing 
may be considered in some older people. This decision should be carefully 
discussed between GPs and patients.
AIM: To explore how GPs discuss deprescribing of statins with their older 
patients.
DESIGN & SETTING: A qualitative study was undertaken using face-to-face, 
semi-structured interviews with Danish GPs from the regions of Southern Demark 
and Zealand.
METHOD: The GP participants belonged to group practices and were identified from 
personal networks and snowballing. The interviews lasted approximately 30 
minutes and were conducted in English. They were analysed using systematic text 
condensation.
RESULTS: A total of 11 GPs were interviewed and three themes were identified. 
(1) Reason for initiating a discussion: statin deprescribing mainly came up when 
GPs reviewed medication lists. There were differences between GPs regarding when 
or if they brought up deprescribing. (2) Discussion topics: GPs often discussed 
their interpretation of evidence surrounding statin use in older people. There 
were differences in how and if GPs discussed patient preferences. GPs viewed 
uncertainty and life expectancy as difficult to discuss. (3) Depth of 
discussion: the perceived level of patient engagement, and clinical context, 
could influence the extent of discussion.
CONCLUSION: GPs identified a range of topics that could be discussed with 
patients surrounding statin deprescribing. The depth and content of discussions 
varied according to the situation, and between GPs. Challenges may exist in 
communicating around certain topics, such as uncertainty and life expectancy. 
Further understanding of how to best communicate around challenging topics, and 
development of structured frameworks, may help facilitate statin deprescribing 
discussions. Identifying what patients think is important to discuss would 
provide necessary insight to promote quality discussions and shared 
understanding of the decision.

BACKGROUND: To date, the burden of injury in Mexico has not been comprehensively 
assessed using recent advances in population health research, including those in 
the Global Burden of Disease Study 2017 (GBD 2017).
METHODS: We used GBD 2017 for burden of unintentional injury estimates, 
including transport injuries, for Mexico and each state in Mexico from 1990 to 
2017. We examined subnational variation, age patterns, sex differences and time 
trends for all injury burden metrics.
RESULTS: Unintentional injury deaths in Mexico decreased from 45 363 deaths (44 
662 to 46 038) in 1990 to 42 702 (41 439 to 43 745) in 2017, while 
age-standardised mortality rates decreased from 65.2 (64.4 to 66.1) in 1990 to 
35.1 (34.1 to 36.0) per 100 000 in 2017. In terms of non-fatal outcomes, there 
were 3 120 211 (2 879 993 to 3 377 945) new injury cases in 1990, which 
increased to 5 234 214 (4 812 615 to 5 701 669) new cases of injury in 2017. We 
estimated 2 761 957 (2 676 267 to 2 859 777) disability-adjusted life years 
(DALYs) due to injuries in Mexico in 1990 compared with 2 376 952 (2 224 588 to 
2 551 004) DALYs in 2017. We found subnational variation in health loss across 
Mexico's states, including concentrated burden in Tabasco, Chihuahua and 
Zacatecas.
CONCLUSIONS: In Mexico, from 1990 to 2017, mortality due to unintentional 
injuries has decreased, while non-fatal incident cases have increased. However, 
unintentional injuries continue to cause considerable mortality and morbidity, 
with patterns that vary by state, age, sex and year. Future research should 
focus on targeted interventions to decrease injury burden in high-risk 
populations.

Community-based screening and treatment of women aged 70-85 years at high 
fracture risk reduced fractures; moreover, the screening programme was 
cost-saving. The results support a case for a screening programme of fracture 
risk in older women in the UK.
INTRODUCTION: The SCOOP (screening for prevention of fractures in older women) 
randomized controlled trial investigated whether community-based screening could 
reduce fractures in women aged 70-85 years. The objective of this study was to 
estimate the long-term cost-effectiveness of screening for fracture risk in a UK 
primary care setting compared with usual management, based on the SCOOP study.
METHODS: A health economic Markov model was used to predict the life-time 
consequences in terms of costs and quality of life of the screening programme 
compared with the control arm. The model was populated with costs related to 
drugs, administration and screening intervention derived from the SCOOP study. 
Fracture risk reduction in the screening arm compared with the usual management 
arm was derived from SCOOP. Modelled fracture risk corresponded to the risk 
observed in SCOOP.
RESULTS: Screening of 1000 patients saved 9 hip fractures and 20 non-hip 
fractures over the remaining lifetime (mean 14 years) compared with usual 
management. In total, the screening arm saved costs (£286) and gained 0.015 
QALYs/patient in comparison with usual management arm.
CONCLUSIONS: This analysis suggests that a screening programme of fracture risk 
in older women in the UK would gain quality of life and life years, and reduce 
fracture costs to more than offset the cost of running the programme.

OBJECTIVES: Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are commonly treated with 
renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors (RAASi) in order to delay 
progression of renal disease. However, research has shown that RAASi in CKD 
patients increases hyperkalaemia (HK) prevalence, which leads to RAASi 
discontinuation or dose reduction with the loss of benefits on the kidney. 
Patiromer is a novel therapy for HK treatment and may enable patients to remain 
on their RAASi regimen. This study aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of 
patiromer from a Swedish healthcare perspective.
METHODS: A Markov model was developed to evaluate the economic outcomes of 
patiromer versus no patiromer in HK patients with stage 3-4 CKD taking RAASi. 
The model consisted of six health states reflecting disease progression and 
hospitalisations. The analysis mainly considered clinical data from the OPAL-HK 
trial and national costs. The main outcomes of interest were incremental costs 
(euro [EUR] 2016) and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), discounted at 3%, and 
the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Extensive uncertainty analyses 
were performed.
RESULTS: In comparison to no patiromer, a patiromer patient gained 0.14 QALYs 
and an incremental cost of EUR 6109 (Swedish krona [SEK] 57,850), yielding an 
ICER of EUR 43,307 (SEK 410,072)/QALY gained. The results were robust to a range 
of sensitivity analyses. At a willingness-to-pay threshold of EUR 52,804 (SEK 
500,000)/QALY, patiromer had a 50% chance of being cost-effective.
CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that patiromer may demonstrate value for money 
in Swedish patients with stage 3-4 CKD, by enabling RAASi treatment. However, 
there is a considerable degree of uncertainty.

OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: Recent American Thyroid Association Guidelines recommend 
either near-total/total thyroidectomy or lobectomy for patients with a thyroid 
nodule suspicious for papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) on fine-needle aspiration 
(FNA) biopsy (Bethesda V). In this analysis, we aim to assess the 
cost-effectiveness of lobectomy in comparison to total thyroidectomy.
STUDY DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis.
METHODS: A Markov model cost-effectiveness analysis was performed for a base 
case followed for 20 years postoperatively. Cost and probabilities data were 
retrieved from the current literature. Effectiveness was represented by 
quality-adjusted life year (QALY).
RESULTS: Total thyroidectomy protocol produced an incremental cost of $2,681.36 
and incremental effectiveness of -0.24 QALY as compared to lobectomy protocol 
(incremental cost-effectiveness ratio [ICER] = -$11,188.85/QALY). Sensitivity 
analysis demonstrated that total thyroidectomy becomes a cost-effective strategy 
only if the risk of stages III and IV PTC is 82.4% among patients with 
suspicious PTC on preoperative FNA. Lobectomy is cost effective and preferred 
over total thyroidectomy as long as lobectomy complications are less than 50%.
CONCLUSIONS: Total thyroidectomy is not just cost prohibitive but also 
associated with a lower effectiveness compared to lobectomy.

The extension of the working life of industrial metallic surfaces is possible 
through the use of efficient inhibitors. Chitosan is a component with high 
potentials for the active protection of metals in various corrosive media. 
Chitosan gives the possibility of vast functionalization and composite formation 
to improve its inhibition performance. Based on the applicability of this 
polymer for corrosion elimination, a large number of papers has been published 
on the use of chitosan and relative components for protection purposes. This 
work attempts to provide a comprehensive review of the chitosan-based inhibiting 
systems used for steel alloys. The reviewed articles are classified into three 
groups as pure chitosan, chitosan functionalized derivatives, and chitosan 
composites. The main results of each article obtained from electrochemical and 
weight loss measurements, as well as a brief description of the experimental 
conditions, are reported.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of treat-to-target strategies 
among recently diagnosed patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) using 
methotrexate (MTX) and a step-down glucocorticoid (GC) scheme (COBRA Slim) 
compared with (1) this combination with either sulphasalazine (COBRA Classic) or 
leflunomide (COBRA Avant-Garde) in high-risk patients and (2) MTX without GCs 
(Tight-Step-Up, TSU) in low-risk patients.
METHODS: The incremental cost-utility was calculated from a healthcare 
perspective in the intention-to-treat population (n=379) of the 2-year 
open-label pragmatic randomised controlled Care in early RA trial. Healthcare 
costs were collected prospectively through electronic trial records. 
Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were estimated using mapping algorithms for 
EuroQoL-5 Dimension. Multiple imputation was used to handle missing data and 
bootstrapping to calculate CIs. Robustness was tested with biological 
disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs at biosimilar prices.
RESULTS: In the high-risk group, Classic (∆k€1.464, 95% CI -0.198 to 3.127) and 
Avant-Garde (∆k€0.636, 95% CI -0.987 to 2.258) were more expensive compared with 
Slim and QALYs were slightly worse for Classic (∆-0.002, 95% CI -0.086 to 0.082) 
and Avant-Garde (∆-0.009, 95% CI -0.102 to 0.084). This resulted in the 
domination of Classic and Avant-Garde by Slim. In the low-risk group, Slim was 
cheaper (∆k€-0.617, 95% CI -2.799 to 1.566) and QALYs were higher (∆0.141, 
95% CI 0.008 to 0.274) compared with TSU, indicating Slim dominated. Results 
were robust against the price of biosimilars.
CONCLUSIONS: The combination of MTX with a GC bridging scheme is less expensive 
with comparable health utility than more intensive step-down combination 
strategies or a conventional step-up approach 2 years after initial treatment.

The design of modular protein logic for regulating protein function at the 
posttranscriptional level is a challenge for synthetic biology. Here, we 
describe the design of two-input AND, OR, NAND, NOR, XNOR, and NOT gates built 
from de novo-designed proteins. These gates regulate the association of 
arbitrary protein units ranging from split enzymes to transcriptional machinery 
in vitro, in yeast and in primary human T cells, where they control the 
expression of the TIM3 gene related to T cell exhaustion. Designed binding 
interaction cooperativity, confirmed by native mass spectrometry, makes the 
gates largely insensitive to stoichiometric imbalances in the inputs, and the 
modularity of the approach enables ready extension to three-input OR, AND, and 
disjunctive normal form gates. The modularity and cooperativity of the control 
elements, coupled with the ability to de novo design an essentially unlimited 
number of protein components, should enable the design of sophisticated 
posttranslational control logic over a wide range of biological functions.

Candidemia is associated with a high mortality rate, and initial adequate 
antifungal therapy results in a significant decrease in the crude mortality. We 
herein report a rapid method that can identify eight Candida species in 
candidemia using imperfect match quenching probes (IM Q-probes) within three and 
a half hours of whole blood sample collection. Furthermore, employing the D 
value, which reflects the difference between the Tm signature from a clinical 
isolate and that registered in the database, it is possible to quickly identify 
samples suitable for IM Q-probe identification. We first evaluated the method 
using 34 Candida colonies collected from different patients, and 100% (34/34) of 
the identification results matched the preidentified Candida species. We then 
performed blind tests using eight whole blood samples artificially mixed with 
eight different Candida species respectively, and all identification results 
correctly matched the preidentified Candida species. Finally, using 16 whole 
blood samples collected from candidemia patients, we compared the IM Q-probe 
method with the culture/sequencing method. Of a total of 16 patient samples, 
100% (16/16) matched the culture and sequencing results. The IM Q-probe method 
is expected to contribute not only to the life expectancy of candidemia patients 
but also to antifungal stewardship.

BACKGROUND: While the average human life expectancy has increased remarkably, 
the length of life with chronic conditions has also increased. To limit the 
occurrence of chronic conditions and comorbidities, it is important to adopt a 
healthy lifestyle. Within the European project "Council of Coaches," a 
personalized coaching platform was developed that supports developing and 
maintaining a healthy lifestyle.
OBJECTIVE: The primary aim of this study is to assess the user experience with 
and the use and potential health effects of a fully working Council of Coaches 
system implemented in a real-world setting among the target population, 
specifically older adults or adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus or chronic 
pain.
METHODS: An observational cohort study with a pretest-posttest design will be 
conducted. The study population will be a dynamic cohort consisting of older 
adults, aged ≥55 years, as well as adults aged ≥18 years with type 2 diabetes 
mellitus or chronic pain. Each participant will interact in a fully automated 
manner with Council of Coaches for 5 to 9 weeks. The primary outcomes are user 
experience, use of the program, and potential effects (health-related factors). 
Secondary outcomes include demographics, applicability of the virtual coaches, 
and user interaction with the virtual coaches.
RESULTS: Recruitment started in December 2019 and is conducted through mass 
mailing, snowball sampling, and advertisements in newspapers and social media. 
This study is expected to conclude in August 2020.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study will either confirm or reject the 
hypothesis that a group of virtual embodied conversational coaches can keep 
users engaged over several weeks of interaction and contribute to positive 
health outcomes.

Everolimus is an mTOR inhibitor, approved as a treatment for cancer and as an 
immunosuppressant agent in solid organ transplantation; it frequently produces 
toxic metabolic effects, particularly of the most severe kind. Its use can cause 
hyperglycemia, hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia; thus, metabolic 
values should be monitored regularly to prevent these adverse events. We present 
the case of a woman with an intestinal neuroendocrine tumor who developed two 
episodes of acute pancreatitis, secondary to severe hypertriglyceridemia caused 
by everolimus. After treatment with fibrates and omega-3, triglyceride levels 
returned to baseline, without developing new metabolic or digestive 
complications. Targeted levels of triglyceride for cancer patients treated with 
everolimus, should be below 500 or 300 mg/dL, depending on whether life 
expectancy is less or longer than one year, respectively.

The aim of the study was to assess the epidemiology of clinical variants of 
ischemic stroke in the different countries of the world. The depth of 
information search is 15 years, it was performed in the databases EMBASE, 
PubMed, OVID, EBSCOhost, ProQuest, Google Scholar, IRBIS, РИНЦ (RISC). 30 
articles were selected for further analysis. There was found that at the 
beginning of 2019, there were 847 RCTs in the world dedicated to the diagnosis 
and treatment of acute stroke, most of which were performed in Europe, the USA 
and China. 90 % of all cases of stroke in the world are associated with 
modifiable risk factors. The highest incidence rates of ischemic stroke are 
registered in the developing nations and post-Soviet countries. The frequency of 
recurrent strokes is determined by the clinical variants of the primary stroke: 
for POCI, the frequency of repeated strokes is 20-25%, for TACI and PACI - 17%, 
for LACI - 9%, and in most cases of recurrent strokes they occur in the same 
cerebral artery as the primary ones. Global trends in the clinical epidemiology 
of ischemic stroke are associated with the aging of the population, increasing 
role of comorbid pathology and the progress of medical diagnosticand treatment 
technologies. The observed regional differences could be explained by the 
various levels of socio-economic development and the resource base of national 
health systems, differences in the compliance of the applied secondary 
prevention, as well as by the availability of national registers and large 
epidemiological studies.

Aim -to calculate and estimate the number of years of potential life lost (YPLL) 
due to premature mortality from cerebrovascular diseases in Ukraine, and its 
share in the array of losses from all diseases of the circulatory system. The 
information base of the study was official data of the State Statistics Service 
of Ukraine on the distribution of the deceased by gender, age groups and causes 
of death in 2018. A comparative analysis of mortality from cerebrovascular 
diseases in selected countries was carried out using the European database of 
mortality (MDB) and the database of the Global Study of Disease Burden, Injuries 
and Risk Factors. The method of potential demography was used to estimate 
demographic losses due to premature mortality from cerebrovascular diseases. The 
number of lost years of potential life due to premature mortality from 
cerebrovascular diseases in 2018 reached 116,563 thousand man-years (104,355 
thousand in 2013), which accounted for more than 18% of similar losses as a 
result of death from all cardiovascular diseases in Ukraine. Revealed a 
significant disproportion of losses depending on gender - more than two thirds 
(69.1%) of the absolute number of lost years accounted for men. Ukraine is 
losing more significant amounts of potential years of life due to high premature 
mortality from cerebrovascular diseases compared to the developed countries of 
the world. Assessing real and potential losses due to premature death from 
cerebrovascular disease is a useful tool to support management decision making. 
We can recommend a methodology for arguing the development of strategies and 
programs aimed at combating cerebrovascular diseases, assessing the dynamics of 
changes in the process of their implementation, and as an indicator of 
effectiveness.

BACKGROUND: The intensity of premature deaths in the Łódź region in 2014 
amounted to 40 per 10 000, and was the highest in the country (the average rate 
for Poland was 32). Excess mortality of men aged <65 continues to be a major 
medical and social problem. The aim of the study is to analyze time trends of 
excess male mortality in the working age population in the Łódź region, both in 
general and due to the most important causes of deaths.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The research material consists of information on 144 589 
deaths of the Łódź region inhabitants aged 20-64 in 1999-2014. Crude and 
standardized mortality rates were calculated, as well as excess male mortality 
rates both in general and by cause of death. Standardization was carried out 
using the direct method according to the standard European population. A study 
of time trends was performed with the use of the joinpoint regression analysis. 
Average annual percentage rates of changes were estimated.
RESULTS: The excess mortality rate of men at the productive age decreased from 
2.9 to 2.8 in the Łódź region in 1999-2014. The most important causes of death 
among men aged 20-64 in 2014 were (rates per 10 000): cardiovascular diseases 
(19.1), malignant neoplasms (16.6) and external causes of death (12.3). Among 
women, the most significant were malignant neoplasms (11.1), cardiovascular 
diseases (5.1) and diseases of the digestive system (2.1). The excess mortality 
rate of men aged 20-64 in the analyzed period reached the highest values due to 
external causes of death (5.1-7.3) and cardiovascular diseases (3.0-3.7). The 
highest rate of the decline in excess male mortality in 1999-2014 was recorded 
due to malignant neoplasms, on average 1.4% per year (p < 0.05). Meanwhile, the 
fastest growth concerned external causes of death, on average 1.0% per year (p < 
0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Despite the decline in the mortality rates among both sexes, excess 
male mortality due to external causes of death and cardiovascular diseases 
increased. Med Pr. 2020;71(3):325-35.

Publisher: WSTĘP: W 2014 r. natężenie przedwczesnych zgonów w województwie 
łódzkim wynosiło 40 na 10 000 osób i było najwyższe w kraju (średnia dla Polski: 
32). Nadumieralność mężczyzn przed 65 r.ż. pozostaje poważnym problemem 
medycznym i społecznym. Celem pracy była analiza trendów czasowych 
nadumieralności mężczyzn w wieku produkcyjnym w województwie łódzkim ogółem i 
według najważniejszych przyczyn zgonów. Celem pracy jest analiza trendów 
czasowych nadumieralności mężczyzn w wieku produkcyjnym w województwie łódzkim 
ogółem i według najważniejszych przyczyn zgonów.
MATERIAŁ I METODY: Materiał badawczy stanowią dane o 144 589 zgonach mieszkańców 
województwa łódzkiego w wieku 20–64 lat w latach 1999–2014. Obliczono 
rzeczywiste i standaryzowane współczynniki umieralności, a także wskaźniki 
nadumieralności mężczyzn ogółem i według przyczyn. Do standaryzacji posłużyła 
metoda bezpośrednia według standardowej populacji europejskiej. Badanie trendów 
czasowych przeprowadzono za pomocą analizy regresji joinpoint. Oszacowano 
średnioroczne procentowe tempa zmian.
WYNIKI: W latach 1999–2014 w województwie łódzkim wskaźnik nadumieralności 
mężczyzn w wieku produkcyjnym zmniejszył się z 2,9 do 2,8. W 2014 r. głównymi 
przyczynami zgonów mężczyzn w wieku 20–64 lat były choroby układu krążenia (19,1 
na 10 000 osób), nowotwory złośliwe (16,6) i przyczyny zewnętrzne (12,3). U 
kobiet były nimi nowotwory złośliwe (11,1), choroby układu krążenia (5,1) i 
choroby układu trawiennego (2,1). W badanym okresie wskaźnik nadumieralności 
mężczyzn w wieku 20–64 lat osiągał najwyższe wartości z powodu zewnętrznych 
przyczyn zgonu (5,1–7,3) i chorób układu krążenia (3,0–3,7). Największe tempo 
spadku wskaźnika nadumieralności w latach 1999–2014 odnotowano w przypadku 
nowotworów złośliwych, średnio 1,4% rocznie (p < 0,05). Najszybszy wzrost 
dotyczył natomiast zewnętrznych przyczyn zgonu, średnio 1,0% rocznie (p < 0,05).

IMPORTANCE: The Elder-Friendly Approaches to the Surgical Environment (EASE) 
initiative is a novel approach to acute surgical care for elderly patients.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the cost-effectiveness of EASE.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: An economic evaluation from the perspective 
of the health care system was conducted as part of the controlled 
before-and-after EASE study at 2 tertiary care centers, the University of 
Alberta Hospital and Foothills Medical Centre. Participants included elderly 
adults (aged ≥65 years) admitted for emergency abdominal surgery between 2014 
and 2017. Data were analyzed from April 2018 to February 2019.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Data were captured at both control and intervention 
sites before and after implementation of the EASE intervention. Resource use was 
captured over 6 months of follow-up and was converted to costs. Utility was 
measured with the EuroQol Five-Dimensions Three-Levels instrument at 6 weeks and 
6 months of follow-up. The differences-in-differences method was used to 
estimate the association of the intervention with cost and quality-adjusted 
life-years. For a subset of participants, self-reported out-of-pocket health 
care costs were collected using the Resource Use Inventory at 6 months.
RESULTS: A total of 675 participants were included (mean [SD] age, 75.3 [7.9] 
years; 333 women [49.3%]), 289 in the intervention group and 386 in the control 
group. The mean (SD) cost per control participant was $36 995 ($44 169) before 
EASE and $35 032 ($43 611) after EASE (all costs are shown in 2018 Canadian 
dollars). The mean (SD) cost per intervention participant was $56 143 ($74 039) 
before EASE and $39 001 ($59 854) after EASE. Controlling for age, sex, and 
Clinical Frailty Score, the EASE intervention was associated with a mean (SE) 
cost reduction of 23.5% (12.5%) (P = .02). The change in quality-adjusted 
life-years observed associated with the intervention was not statistically 
significant (mean [SE], 0.00001 [0.0001] quality-adjusted life-year; P = .72). 
The Resource Use Inventory was collected for 331 participants. The mean (SE) 
odds ratio for having 0 out-of-pocket expenses because of the intervention, 
compared with having expenses greater than 0, was 15.77 (3.37) (P = .02). Among 
participants with Resource Use Inventory costs greater than 0, EASE was not 
associated with a change in spending (mean [SE] reduction associated with EASE, 
19.1% [45.2%]; P = .57).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study suggests that the EASE intervention was 
associated with a reduction in costs and no change in quality-adjusted 
life-years. In locations that lack capacity to implement this intervention, 
costs to increase capacity should be weighed against the estimated costs 
avoided.

OBJECTIVES: To investigate the clinical course of Japanese patients with early 
diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis (dcSSc) and early SSc with interstitial 
lung disease (ILD).
METHODS: We prospectively analyzed the clinical features of 207 Japanese 
patients with early dcSSc (n = 150) and limited cutaneous SSc (lcSSc) with ILD 
(n = 57) in 10 medical centers every year for 7 consecutive years.
RESULTS: Mean modified Rodnan total skin thickness score (mRSS) was 18.3 and 
67.4% of the cohort had ILD. Most patients started immunosuppressive therapy and 
vasodilators during 7 years (83.4% and 87.9%, respectively). Mean value of mRSS 
of total patients was significantly reduced from the initial registration after 
the first year. However, other parameters for physical function associated with 
skin sclerosis including fist closure, hand extension, and oral aperture were 
not so ameliorated during the study period. Health Assessment 
Questionnaire-disability index and serum KL-6 levels were constant throughout 
the course. Percent vital capacity and the presence of ILD, clinically suspected 
pulmonary arterial hypertension, and digital ulcers were gradually exacerbated 
during the period.
CONCLUSION: In Japanese early dcSSc patients and SSc patients with ILD, mRSS was 
continuously reduced during 7 years of follow-up, but there was little 
improvement of physical disability and organ involvement.

BACKGROUND: Because of a lack of preference-based health-related quality of life 
(HRQoL) instruments suitable for infants aged 0-12 months, we previously 
developed the Infant QoL Instrument (IQI). The present study aimed to generate 
an algorithm to estimate utilities for the IQI.
METHODS: Via an online survey, respondents from the general population and 
primary caregivers from China-Hong Kong, the UK, and the USA were presented 10 
discrete choice scenarios based on the IQI classification system. An additional 
sample of respondents from the general population were also asked if they 
considered the examined health states to be worse than death. Coefficients for 
the IQI item levels were obtained with a conditional logit model based on the
