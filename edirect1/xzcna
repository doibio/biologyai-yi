increasing over the last years due to longer life expectancy, also resulting in 
a significant impact upon healthcare resources. The coronary sinus Reducer is a 
novel technology designed to improve the quality of life of these patients. The 
aim of this paper is to provide an overview of the available data regarding this 
new technology, along with the experience of the three centers that have 
performed the highest number of implants in Italy, focusing our attention on the 
clinical presentation of these complex patients and their follow-up.

Stroke is a serious threat to human health that often leads to severe 
complications, and currently ranks first as leading cause of death in China. 
However, reliable data on stroke burden in China in the 21st century are 
lacking. We used the data from NESS-China (National Epidemiological Survey of 
Stroke in China) for assessing the adverse health effects of stroke in Chinese 
population. We carried out inter-regional comparative study in order to obtain 
regular burden related characteristics of stroke in China, as measured by YLLs 
(years of life lost due to premature mortality), YLDs (years lived with 
disability) and DALYs (disability adjusted life years). Amongst the nationwide 
population of 596,536 individuals of all ages in 2013, the YLLs for stroke was 
1748, the YLDs was 262, and the DALYs was 2010(per 100,000). The gender subtype 
analysis of DALYs was 2171(male) and 1848(female). The YLLs, YLDs and DALYs in 
rural areas were higher compared to urban areas. Among the 18 age groups, the 
highest YLLs was observed in ≥ 80 years old group. The impact of stroke on 
Chinese population is more severe compared to the global average levels. Stroke 
results as the main cause of YLLs in China, while there is no significant 
difference for the YLDs. Nevertheless, DALYs caused by stroke rank 3th in global 
epidemiologic study territories, 1st in China.

INTRODUCTION: Sacrococcygealteratoma is very rare in adults with only few cases 
reported in literature. It is a slow growing benign cystic tumor with 1-2% 
chance for malignant transformation and may attain a huge size causing pressure 
effect on pelvic and intra-abdominal organs. When grows caudally, it causes 
discomfort, skin excoriation and cosmetic disfigurement.
PRESENTATION OF CASE: We present a giant, long standing Sacrococcygeal teratoma 
in an adult female patient which caused her significant obstructing lower 
gastrointestinal and urinary symptoms besides the discomfort and disfigurement 
of the sacral region.
DISCUSSION: Sacrococcygeal teratomas are commonly present early in life but are 
very rare to be seen in adults with such a huge size in such a place where it 
interfered with patient sitting and sleeping. Diagnosis of our case was 
suspected by clinical examination, ultrasound and MRI while histopathology 
confirmed the diagnosis. It was completely excised along with the coccyx with 
primary wound closure and had a good postoperative recovery. Up till now, 18 
months follow-up using clinical, biochemical and radiological assessment 
revealed no evidence of recurrence.
CONCLUSION: Sacococcygeal teratoma should be considered in the differential 
diagnosis of large pelvic masses in adults. In the presence of an extra-corporal 
and deep intra pelvic extension, we recommend the posterior perineal approach 
for excision as it has convenient control over the mass during surgery and good 
cosmetic results.

BACKGROUND: Multiple sclerosis (MS), a chronic progressive, demyelinating, 
inflammatory disease, affects 2.5 million people worldwide. Approximately 63% of 
cases are classified as relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) at the time of diagnosis. 
The aim of this cost-utility analysis is to evaluate alemtuzumab vs interferon 
beta (intramuscular [IM] interferon beta-1a, subcutaneous [SC] interferon 
beta-1a, SC interferon beta-1b, and SC pegylated interferon beta-1a) in 
previously treated, and vs SC interferon beta-1a, fingolimod, and natalizumab in 
untreated RRMS patients to determine the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
among the treatment alternatives as prices, the route, and the frequency of 
administration of considered products vary significantly.
METHODS: The primary outcome was the modeled incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio (ICER; €/quality-adjusted life-year [QALY] gained). Markov modeling with a 
10-year time horizon was carried out. During each 3-month cycle, patients 
maintained the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score or experienced 
progression, developed secondary progressive MS (SPMS), or showed EDSS 
progression in SPMS; experienced relapses; suffered from an adverse event (AE); 
changed treatment; or died. A published network meta-analysis (NMA) was used for 
indirect comparison. The possibility of a therapy switch was considered. 
Clinical input data and resource utilization data were derived from the 
literature. Costs were extracted from price lists published in Austria and were 
calculated from the payer's perspective.
RESULTS: In treatment naïve patients, alemtuzumab is associated with costs of 
€132,663 and 5.25 QALYs in a 10-year time horizon. Costs for SC interferon beta 
amount to €164,159 and generate 4.85 QALYs. Also, in the pre-treated patients, 
alemtuzumab dominated comparators by accumulating higher total QALYs (4.88) and 
lower total costs (€137.409) compared to interferon beta-1a (€200.133), 
fingolimod (€240.903), and natalizumab (€247.758).
CONCLUSION: The analysis shows that alemtuzumab is a cost-saving alternative to 
treat RRMS in pre-treated and therapy naïve patients. From the patient 
perspective, alemtuzumab improves quality-of-life.

BACKGROUND: Physical activity programs (PAP) in patients with cardiovascular 
disease require evidence of cost-utility. To assess improvement in 
health-related quality of life (QoL) and reduction of health care consumption of 
patients following PAP, a randomized trial was used.
METHODS: Patients from a health insurance company who had experienced coronary 
artery disease or moderate heart failure were invited to participate (N = 1891). 
Positive responders (N = 50) were randomly assigned to a progressively 
autonomous physical activity (PAPA) program or to a standard supervised physical 
activity (SPA) program. The SPA group had two supervised sessions per week over 
5 months. PAPA group had one session per week and support to aid habit formation 
(written tips, exercise program, phone call). To measure health-related quality 
of life EQ-5D utility score were used, before intervention, 6 months (T6) and 1 
year later. Health care costs were provided from reimbursement databases.
RESULTS: Mobility, usual activities and discomfort improved significantly in 
both group (T6). One year later, EQ-5D utility score was improved in the PAPA 
group only. Total health care consumption in the intervention group decreased, 
from a mean of 4097 euros per year before intervention to 2877 euros per year 
after (p = 0.05), compared to a health care consumption of 4087 euros and 4180 
euros per year, in the total population of patients (N = 1891) from the health 
insurance company. The incremental cost effectiveness ratio was 10,928 euros per 
QALYs.
CONCLUSION: A physical activity program is cost-effective in providing a better 
quality of life and reducing health care consumption in cardiovascular patients.

BACKGROUND: Currently, the number of children living with HIV is the highest 
ever. This has led to an increased focus on a healthy life expectancy in this 
population. Improving oral health status may contribute to improved immunity, 
which could in turn lead to greater overall health in this population. This 
study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of an oral health intervention in 
improving oral health and immune status among children living with HIV in 
Cambodia.
METHODS: A randomized controlled trial will be conducted in Phnom Penh from May 
2018 to April 2020. Among 520 dyads of children living with their respective 
caregivers, half will be randomly allocated to the intervention group and the 
other half to the control group. Children aged 3-15 years who are currently 
receiving antiretroviral therapy at the National Pediatric Hospital will be 
recruited. In addition, 260 HIV-uninfected children (age-matched to the 
intervention group) will be recruited from the communities. They, together with 
their caregivers, will comprise the second control group. The main components of 
the intervention will include oral health education sessions for the children, 
as well as daily oral self-care under the supervision of their caregivers. The 
primary study outcome will be the change in oral health status including the 
number of decayed, missing, or filled permanent teeth, and the secondary outcome 
will be CD4 count. The effects of the intervention will be assessed by comparing 
outcome indicators between the children in the intervention and those in the 
control groups.
DISCUSSION: This trial will investigate the effects of an oral health 
intervention on the improvement of oral health and immune status among children 
living with HIV and determine the differences compared with the control groups. 
This intervention would encourage the promotion of oral health interventions 
among children living with HIV and thus contribute to delaying the onset of 
AIDS.

Recurrent pleural effusion is a symptom of several end-stage diseases and is 
associated with limited life expectancy. Patients with this condition have 
disabling symptoms resulting in reduced quality of life and often receive 
inconsistent treatment due to delayed recognition of pleural effusion, repeat 
procedures, and lengthy hospitalizations. Placement of a tunneled pleural 
catheter allows the patient to manage his or her symptoms at home, yet this 
treatment remains underused because of provider misconceptions and unfamiliarity 
with the intervention. This article provides an overview of the indications for 
placement of a tunneled pleural catheter, possible complications, and management 
strategies, and introduces evidence-based clinical decision support tools to 
enhance provider knowledge. In addition, the article describes the 
implementation and evaluation of a performance improvement initiative on the use 
of tunneled pleural catheters in a multifaceted health care system.

OBJECTIVE: Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is an autosomal dominant 
form of diabetes, with multiple causative genes. Some MODY subtypes can be 
treated with sulfonylureas instead of insulin, improving glycemic control, 
complication rates, quality of life (QoL), and costs. Using massively parallel 
sequencing (MPS), we recently determined the prevalence of pathogenic/likely 
pathogenic MODY variants in an Australian pediatric diabetes cohort. Here, these 
data are used to estimate cost-effectiveness of using MPS for MODY in all 
pediatric diabetes cases compared with standard practice (sequencing limited to 
individuals with specific clinical features).
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A Markov decision model was developed to estimate 
incremental costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) of MPS screening, 
modeled over 30 years. We used our observed prevalence of 2.14% compared with 
0.7% for standard practice, based on published data. The probabilities and 
utility weightings of long-term diabetes complications were based on HbA1c and 
estimated from published data. A series of one-way sensitivity analyses were 
performed using the net monetary benefit framework.
RESULTS: Routine MPS screening for MODY was more effective and less costly than 
standard care screening, with 26 QALYs gained and 1,016,000 AUD (782,000 USD) 
saved per 1,000 patients. Cost of screening was fully offset within 10 years. 
Routine MPS screening remained dominant until MODY prevalence fell to <1.1%.
CONCLUSIONS: Routine MPS screening for MODY in the pediatric population with 
diabetes could reduce health system costs and improve patient QoL. Our results 
make a compelling argument for routine genetic screening in all children with 
presumed type 1 diabetes mellitus.

Liver diseases that are caused by the hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C 
virus (HCV), including cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), have become 
increasingly important in patients infected with the human immunodeficiency 
virus (HIV) as their life expectancy is getting longer with successful anti-HIV 
therapy. Due to their shared transmission routes, dual infection by HIV and HBV 
or HIV and HCV, and triple infection by all three viruses are fairly common and 
affect millions of people worldwide. Whereas the immunodeficiency caused by HIV 
enhances the likelihood of HBV and HCV persistence, hepatotoxicity associated 
with anti-HIV therapy can worsen the liver diseases associated with HBV or HCV 
persistence. Evidence suggests HIV infection increases the risk of HBV- or 
HCV-associated HCC risk although the precise mechanisms of enhanced 
hepatocarcinogenesis remain to be fully elucidated. Recent success in curing HCV 
infection, and the availability of therapeutic options effective in long-term 
suppression of both HIV and HBV replication, bring hope, fortunately, to those 
who are coinfected but also highlight the need for judicious selection of 
antiviral therapies.

AIMS: The objective of this (trial based) economic evaluation was to assess, 
from a societal perspective, the cost-effectiveness of perioperative enteral 
nutrition compared with standard care in patients undergoing colorectal surgery.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Alongside the SANICS II randomized controlled trial, 
global quality-of-life, utilities (measured by EQ-5D-5L), healthcare costs, 
production losses, and patient and family costs were assessed at baseline, 
3 months, and 6 months. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) (i.e. cost 
per increased global quality-of-life score or quality-adjusted life year [QALY] 
gained) and cost effectiveness acceptability curves were visualized.
RESULTS: In total, 265 patients were included in the original trial (n = 132 in 
the perioperative enteral nutrition group and n = 133 in the standard care 
group). At 6 months, global quality-of-life (83 vs 83, p = .357) did not differ 
significantly between the groups. The mean total societal costs for the 
intervention and standard care groups were €14,673 and €11,974, respectively, 
but did not reach statistical significance (p = .109). The intervention resulted 
in an ICER of -€6,276 per point increase in the global quality of life score. 
The gain in QALY was marginal (0.003), with an additional cost of €2,941, and 
the ICUR (Incremental cost utility ratio) was estimated at €980,333.
LIMITATIONS: The cost elements for all the participating centers reflect the 
reference prices from the Netherlands. Patient-reported questionnaires may have 
resulted in recall bias. Sample size was limited by exclusion of patients who 
did not complete questionnaires for at least at two time points. A power 
analysis based on costs and health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL) was not 
performed. The economic impact could not be analyzed at 1 month post-operatively 
where the effects could potentially be higher.
CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that perioperative nutrition is not beneficial 
for the patients in terms of quality-of-life and is not cost-effective.

Increasing life expectancy within cystic fibrosis (CF) raises challenges around 
previously neglected topics such as sexual and reproductive health (SRH). The 
study aimed to gather retrospective experiences of service provision around SRH 
to consider the role of the CF service, age of information provision and unmet 
needs highlighting possible improvements to provision. A mixed-methods 
retrospective survey-based design was employed. An Adult CF team participated in 
a consultation session generating survey questions around SRH. A 20-item online 
survey was constructed and disseminated to adult CF patients. Unmet needs were 
found in SRH provision in pediatric and adult CF services, with further 
information required by patients on topics including parenthood and fertility. 
Results support previous research findings highlighting the need for 
standardized provision around SRH. Age of SRH provision suggested individual 
differences in need within the pediatric service. Further research could explore 
format and specific age of SRH information provision.

PURPOSE: This study aimed at investigating whether association between physical 
activity, and bone density and muscle strength depends on daily activity 
pattern.
METHODS: Loading dose of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) was 
measured using accelerometer on 54 men (M age = 54.1 years) and 59 women (M 
age = 52.1 years). Pattern of MVPA was quantified as number and length of MVPA 
bouts, and the length of break bouts between MVPA bouts. Knee extension torque 
(KET) and broadband ultrasound attenuation (BUA) of the calcaneus were also 
measured. Regression analysis was employed to examine the moderation effect of 
MVPA pattern.
RESULTS: Loading dose had a larger effect on BUA (b = .002, p = .035) and KET 
(b = .004, p = .01) with the increase of median length of MVPA bout, but had a 
smaller effect on KET with the increase of maximal length of break bout 
(b = - .015, p = .024).
CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that pattern of physical activity can influence 
its efficacy on muscle and bone health.

Common health problems of the elderly in the near future will become even more 
common with aging of the population and longer average life expectancy. The 
elderly tend to have multiple disorders at one time, some of which may aggravate 
the course of others. One of the most common diseases, diabetes – “the epidemics 
of XXI century”, treatment of which costs approximately 11% of world health care 
budget – is the leading reason of chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal 
disease. Diabetic nephropathy can be a complication of both diabetes mellitus 
type 1 and 2. The most numerous group of patients with recently-made diagnosis 
are these above 60 years of age. Albuminuria, which, depending on its intensity, 
is one of the diagnostic criteria, can appear even in the process of aging 
itself. Overlapping of structural and functional changes that develop with age 
and those caused by diabetes is therefore a challenge, both diagnostic and 
clinical. There are certain methods of early diagnosis and prevention of 
progression of diabetic kidney disease. There is, however, no targeted treatment 
and existing therapies are generally based on glycemia and blood pressure 
control. Some patients in the advanced stage undergo dialyses just like in other 
kidney failure cases. The course of the disease is influenced by modifiable 
factors, such as protein and salt intake or cigarette smoking. In the light of 
the fact that this problem will concern an increasing number of patients, 
diagnostics and treatment can and should be introduced in the early stages of 
the disease. This all fits within the recently popular “healthy aging” ideology. 
Its popularization and implementation can bring measurable benefits of social 
and economic character.

School Absenteeism in Children and Adolescents.

Frequent school absenteeism has immediate and long-term negative effects on 
academic performance, social functioning, high school and college graduation 
rates, adult income, health, and life expectancy. Previous research focused on 
distinguishing between truancy and anxiety-driven school refusal, but current 
policy has shifted to reducing absenteeism for any reason. Chronic absenteeism 
appears to be driven by overlapping medical, individual, family, and social 
factors, including chronic illness, mental health conditions, bullying, 
perceived lack of safety, health problems or needs of other family members, 
inconsistent parenting, poor school climate, economic disadvantage, and 
unreliable transportation. Family physicians are well positioned to identify 
patients with frequent absences, intervene early, and tailor treatment plans to 
the patient's medical and social needs. Informing parents of the link between 
school attendance and achievement can be effective in reducing absences. If 
absenteeism is caused by chronic illness, management should include clear 
expectations about school attendance and care coordination with school 
personnel. Mental health conditions that interfere with school attendance can 
often be treated with cognitive behavior therapy and/or pharmacotherapy. When 
assessing a child with frequent absences, physicians should inquire about 
bullying, even if the patient is not known to identify with a vulnerable group. 
Families and schools are key collaborators in interventions via parent 
education, parental mental health treatment, and school-based intervention 
programs.

Radiation oncologists play an important role in the palliative care of advanced 
cancer patients. The article discusses the various clinical indications of 
palliative radiation therapy, which include the control of bone pain, acute 
treatment of cord compression, the control of thoracic and gastrointestinal 
symptoms. The importance of survival estimates for individualization of 
radiation therapy regime is elaborated. Besides prescription of radiation 
treatment, radiation oncologists should also function as primary palliative care 
providers by assessing and initial management of symptoms and other sources of 
distress, making prompt referrals to specialists for complex symptom management 
and contributing to the multidisciplinary palliative care team. Additionally, 
communication skills, including prognostic disclosure and goals of care 
discussions, should also be a core competency of radiation oncologists.

Primary immunodeficiencies (PID) are rare, congenital disorders, often 
associated with genetic defects in the immune system. According to our current 
knowlegde, about 350 genes are involved in distinct immunodeficiency disorders. 
In PIDs at least one, and often more, immune component is impaired, missing, or 
has an inappropriate function. The prevalence of PID has been increasing. Due to 
advances in the treatment of PID, especially immunoglobulin replacement therapy 
and stem cell transplantation, the life expectancy of patients is longer. As 
patients with PID live longer, malignancies are diagnosed more commonly. 
Patients with PID are at an increased risk of malignancy compared with the 
normal population. Malignancy is the second most common cause of death in these 
patients after infections. The aim of this article is to review the malignancies 
and their clinical relevance in patients with PID. Orv Hetil. 2018; 159(49);

AIMS: Peripheral artery disease affects 1.2% of the population globally and is 
associated with an increased risk of atherothrombotic cardiovascular events, 
major adverse limb events and mortality. The Cardiovascular Outcomes for People 
Using Anti-coagulation Strategies (COMPASS) trial demonstrated positive results 
of rivaroxaban plus aspirin therapy compared to aspirin therapy alone in those 
with peripheral artery disease or carotid artery disease. We sought to estimate 
the cost-effectiveness from the Australian healthcare system perspective.
METHODS AND RESULTS: A Markov model was developed to simulate the experiences of 
a hypothetical population of 1000 individuals with peripheral artery disease or 
carotid artery disease, profiled on the COMPASS trial, treated with rivaroxaban 
plus aspirin therapy versus aspirin therapy alone. With each annual cycle, 
individuals were at risk of having non-fatal cardiovascular disease events, 
major adverse limb events, or dying. Individuals were also at risk of non-fatal 
major bleeding. The model had a lifetime time horizon. Costs and utilities were 
sourced from the literature and discounted at 5.0% annually. Rivaroxaban plus 
aspirin therapy prevented 143 non-fatal cardiovascular disease events, 118 major 
adverse limb events and 10 deaths compared to aspirin therapy alone. Conversely, 
156 additional major non-fatal bleeds were accrued. With an additional 256 
quality-adjusted life years gained, at an additional cost of AUD$6,858,103, the 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was AUD$26,769 (discounted) per 
quality-adjusted life year gained, which is below Australia's arbitrary 
willingness to pay threshold of AUD$50,000.
CONCLUSION: In those with peripheral artery disease or carotid artery disease, 
rivaroxaban plus aspirin therapy is effective and cost-effective in the 
prevention of recurrent cardiovascular disease compared to aspirin therapy 
alone.

Hyperactive Child Syndrome and Estimated Life Expectancy at Young Adult 
Follow-Up: The Role of ADHD Persistence and Other Potential Predictors.

OBJECTIVE: We examined if ADHD Combined Type or Presentation (ADHD-C) reduced 
estimated life expectancy (ELE) at young adulthood and if the persistence of 
ADHD to adulthood further adversely affected ELE.
METHOD: A young adult follow-up of 131 hyperactive and 71 control cases was used 
to derive 14 variables that were entered into a life expectancy calculator to 
generate ELE scores. Both ratings of executive function (EF) in everyday life 
and tests of EF and IQ were measured along with comorbid psychopathologies.
RESULTS: Childhood ADHD-C was associated with a 9.5-year reduction in healthy 
ELE, and a 8.4-year reduction in total ELE relative to control children by 
adulthood. The persistence of ADHD to adulthood was linked to a 12.7-year 
reduction in ELE. Several background traits accounted for more than 39% of 
variation in ELE.
CONCLUSION: Childhood ADHD-C predicts a significantly reduced ELE by adulthood, 
which is further reduced by the persistence of ADHD to adult follow-up.

Medical Sciences Building, Adelaide, SA 5000, Australia. Email:.

The Australian health system performs well compared with other developed 
countries, but there is potential for improved health outcomes through the 
consideration of the opportunity costs of funding new health services. The 
opportunity costs of funding a new health service are the benefits forgone from 
the activities that would be funded if the new health service was not funded. 
When the forgone activity cannot be observed directly, the expected opportunity 
costs have been estimated as the expected gain in quality-adjusted life years 
(QALYs) associated with marginal increases in government expenditure on health. 
We have previously estimated that a gain of 1 QALY is expected for every 
additional A$28033 of government expenditure on health. This paper discusses the 
relevance and proposed use of this estimate of opportunity costs to inform 
decisions around the public funding of new health services in Australia.

INTRODUCTION: The natural history of small renal masses has been well defined, 
leading to the recommendation of active surveillance in some patients with 
limited life expectancy. However, this information is less clear for large renal 
masses (LRM), leading to ambiguity for management in the older, comorbid 
patient. The objective of this study was to define the natural history, 
including the growth rate and metastatic risk, of LRM in order to better counsel 
patients regarding active surveillance.
METHODS: This was a retrospective review of patients with solid renal masses 
&gt;4 cm that had repeated imaging identified from an institutional imaging 
database. Patient comorbidities and outcomes were obtained through retrospective 
chart analysis. Outcomes assessed included tumour growth and metastatic rates, 
as well as cancer-specific (CSS) and overall survival (OS) usimg Kaplan-Meier 
methodology.
RESULTS: We identified 69 patients between 2005 and 2016 who met the inclusion 
criteria. Mean age at study entry was 75.5 years; mean tumour maximal dimension 
at study entry was 5.6 cm. CSS was 83% and OS 63% for patients presenting 
without metastasis, with a mean followup of 57.5 months. The mean growth rate of 
those that developed metastasis during followup (n=15) was 0.98 cm/year (95% 
confidence interval [CI] 0.33-1.63) as compared to those that did not develop 
metastasis (n=46), with a growth rate of 0.67 cm/year (95% CI 0.34-1) 
(non-significant). Seven patients had evidence of metastasis at the baseline 
imaging of their LRM and had subsequent growth rate of 1.47 cm/year (95% CI 
0.37-2.57) (non-significant) CONCLUSIONS: Compared to small renal masses, LRM 
are associated with higher metastasis rates and lower CSS and more rapid growth 
rates. Selection criteria for recommending observation of LRM in older, comorbid 
patients should be more conservative than for small renal masses.

Colorectal cancer commonly metastasizes. The liver is the most frequent site of 
metastases and dominates the length of survival for this disease. As surgical 
and systemic therapies have become accepted and now are proven to be potentially 
curative, other sites of metastases have become more clinically relevant in 
terms of clinical symptoms and influence on survival. Treatment of extrahepatic 
metastases by surgical and ablative procedures is increasingly accepted and is 
proving to be effective at palliating symptoms, as well as life prolonging. In 
this review, we will first summarize key issues with metastatic colorectal 
cancer to the liver and available treatments. We will then discuss surgical and 
ablative treatments of other sites of disease including lung, lymph nodes, 
peritoneum, bone, and brain. Best available evidence for treatment strategies 
will be presented as well as potential new directions.

Colorectal cancer commonly metastasizes. Most commonly this occurs by five 
means: direct extension, lymphatic spread, portal venous spread to liver, 
peritoneal dissemination, and vascular spread to distant organs including lung, 
bone, and brain. The liver is the most frequent site of metastases and dominates 
the length of survival for this disease. Nearly one-half of patients diagnosed 
with colorectal cancer will be found to have liver metastases at some point 
during their disease. When untreated, patients with liver metastases have a 
median survival of 6–9 months. Even with the best chemotherapy, median survival 
of unresectable disease is 13–18 months. In the last three decades, treatment of 
extrahepatic metastases by surgical and ablative procedures has proven to be 
effective. It is increasingly accepted and is effective at palliating symptoms, 
prolongs life, and can be potentially curative. The fact that liver resection is 
affecting outcome is also highlighted by the fact that over 70% of patients with 
unresectable liver metastases die of their liver metastases. In patients treated 
by hepatectomy, approximately 30% ultimately die of liver metastases. The median 
survival of patients after hepatectomy for stage IV metastatic colorectal cancer 
in the liver is over forty months. Consequently, other sites of metastases are 
not only more likely to become apparent, but also more likely to cause symptoms 
and influence survival. Thus, management of liver metastases has made enough 
progress so that other sites of metastases have become more clinically relevant. 
In this review, we will first summarize the natural history of colorectal cancer 
metastases. We then will address key issues with metastatic colorectal cancer to 
the liver and available treatments. This is followed by a discussion of surgical 
and ablative treatments of other sites of disease including lung, peritoneum, 
bone, lymph nodes and brain. Best available evidence for treatment strategies 
will be presented as well as potential new directions. At presentation, 20–25% 
of patients will have distant metastases, most to the liver. Another 20–25% will 
later develop liver metastases. Of patients who succumb to the disease, 49% will 
have liver dominant disease, and 83% will have some liver involvement. Disease 
specific survival is also significantly shorter for those who die of liver 
metastasis, compared to patients who die from other metastatic sites. Thus, 
addressing liver metastases initially is the most clinically relevant, since 
this is the most life limiting. Currently, patients who do not undergo surgical 
treatment of liver metastases typically live less than 18 months, with no 5-year 
survivors. By comparison, those who are resected but recur have a median 
survival of 40 months, and have a 17% 5-year survival. As such, liver directed 
therapies shift the cause of death to other sites at a later time point. For 
this reason, having metastases at other sites does not change survival for 
patients with liver metastases, as long as they are candidates for surgery. 
Understanding patient prognosis after treatment of liver metastases goes beyond 
American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging due to patient heterogeneity. 
Clinical risk scores have been developed to facilitate this, and show that 
survival is based on primary cancer metastases to lymph nodes, length of disease 
free interval (if liver disease was not identified at diagnosis), number of 
metastases within the liver, and serum carcinoembryonic antigen level. Most 
major centers report operative mortality of <5% for those undergoing hepatectomy 
for colorectal cancer liver metastases. Indications for surgery are expanding, 
which is no longer limited to younger patients without comorbidities. Number of 
liver metastases is less important for determining resectability than is the 
existence of adequate vascular inflow and outflow of the remaining liver 
remnant. Smaller lesions within the planned liver remnant can be treated with 
microwave ablation or irreversible electroporation. The post-operative 
functional liver remnant must, however, be 20–40% of the pre-operative liver 
volume depending on hepatocyte functionality. This is dependent on exposure to 
previous chemotherapy and pre-existing cirrhosis. If the functional liver 
remnant is insufficient at presentation, it can be augmented by pre-operative 
portal venous embolization. Expanding on this concept, some surgeons perform a 
two-staged procedure that begins with liver partition and portal vein ligation 
to promote growth of the functional liver remnant, which can initially be as 
small as a single liver segment. If metastatic disease is limited to the liver, 
but is too extensive to resect, a hepatic artery infusion pump that delivers 
floxuridine directly and only to the liver may also be considered. Patients who
