PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The prediction of all-cause mortality is an important 
component of shared decision-making across the cancer care continuum, 
particularly in older adults with limited life expectancy, for whom there is an 
increased risk of over-diagnosis and treatment.
RECENT FINDINGS: Currently, several international societies recommend the use of 
all-cause mortality risk prediction tools when making decisions regarding 
screening and treatment in geriatric oncology. Here, we review some practical 
aspects of the utilization of those tools and dissect the characteristics of 
those most employed in geriatric oncology, highlighting both their advantages 
and their limitations.

Polyamines (putrescine, spermidine, and spermine) are compounds with amino 
groups at both ends of a hydrocarbon. Polyamines produced by intestinal bacteria 
suppress chronic inflammation and enhance the intestinal barrier in the colon, 
and are also transferred into the blood via the colonic epithelium, resulting in 
significant improvement of host cognitive performance and life extension in 
mice. Upregulation of polyamine production by gut microbes can help compensate 
for the aging-associated decrease in polyamine content through the uptake of 
intestinal luminal polyamine, thereby extending the healthy life expectancy of 
the host. This review summarizes recent advances in the study of polyamine 
metabolism and transport in gut microbes, with particular reference to 
Escherichia coli and the most predominant species of the gut microbiota. 
Furthermore, we describe polyamine production by a novel hybrid system comprised 
of multiple gut microbes, as well as from high-polyamine-producing lactic acid 
bacteria derived from fermented foods.

Molecular diagnostics devoted to discover and monitor new biomarkers is gaining 
increasing attention in clinical diagnosis. In this work, a programmable 
DNA-fueled electrochemical analysis strategy is designed for the determination 
of an emerging biomarker in lung cancer, PD-L1-expressing exosomes. 
Specifically, PD-L1-expressing exosomes are first enriched onto magnetic beads 
functionalized with PD-L1 antibody and are able to interact with 
cholesterol-modified hairpin templates. Then, programmable DNA synthesis starts 
from the hairpin template-triggered primer exchange reaction and generates a 
large number of extension products to activate the trans-cleavage activity of 
CRISPR-Cas12a. After that, CRISPR-Cas12a-catalyzed random cleavage boosts the 
degradation of methylene blue-labeled signaling strands, so electro-active 
methylene blue molecules can be enriched onto a cucurbit[7]uril-modified 
electrode for quantitative determination. Our method demonstrates high 
sensitivity and specificity toward electrochemical analysis of PD-L1-expressing 
exosomes in the range from 103 to 109 particles mL-1 with a low detection limit 
of 708 particles mL-1. When applied to clinical samples, our method reveals an 
elevated level of circulating PD-L1-expressing exosomes in lung cancer patients, 
especially for those at the advanced stages. Therefore, our method may provide 
new insight into liquid biopsy for better implementation of immunotherapy in 
lung cancer in the future.

BACKGROUND: There are limited data on structural heart disease among people 
living with HIV in southern Africa, where the success of antiretroviral therapy 
(ART) has drastically improved life expectancy and where risk factors for 
cardiovascular disease are prevalent.
METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study of screening echocardiography 
among adults (≥18 years) with HIV in Malawi presenting for routine ART care. We 
used univariable and multivariable logistic regression to evaluate correlates of 
abnormal echocardiogram.
RESULTS: A total of 202 individuals were enrolled with a median age of 45 years 
(IQR 39-52); 52% were female, and 27.7% were on antihypertensive medication. The 
most common clinically significant abnormality was left ventricular hypertrophy 
(LVH) (12.9%, n=26), and other serious structural heart lesions were rare (<2% 
with ejection fraction less than 40%, moderate-severe valve lesions or 
moderate-severe pericardial effusion). Characteristics associated with abnormal 
echocardiogram included older age (OR 1.04, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.08), higher body 
mass index (OR 1.09, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.17), higher mean systolic blood pressure 
(OR 1.03, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.05) and higher mean diastolic blood pressure (OR 
1.03, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.05). In a multivariable model including age, duration on 
ART, body mass index, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure, only mean body 
mass index (adjusted OR 1.10, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.19), systolic blood pressure (aOR 
1.05, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.08) and diastolic blood pressure (aOR 0.96, 95% CI 0.92 
to 1.00) remained associated with abnormal echocardiogram.
CONCLUSIONS: LVH was common in this population of adults on ART presenting for 
routine care and was associated with elevated blood pressure. Further research 
is needed to characterise the relationship between chronic hypertension, LVH and 
downstream consequences, such as diastolic dysfunction and heart failure in 
people living with HIV.

The marketing approval, about ten years ago, of the first disease modulator for 
patients with cystic fibrosis harboring specific CFTR genotypes (~5% of all 
patients) brought new hope for their treatment. To date, several therapeutic 
strategies have been approved and the number of CFTR mutations targeted by 
therapeutic agents is increasing. Although these drugs do not reverse the 
existing disease, they help to increase the median life expectancy. However, on 
the basis of their CFTR genotype, ~10% of patients presently do not qualify for 
any of the currently available CFTR modulator therapies, particularly patients 
with splicing mutations (~12% of the reported CFTR mutations). Efforts are 
currently made to develop therapeutic agents that target disease-causing CFTR 
variants that affect splicing. This highlights the need to fully identify them 
by scanning non-coding regions and systematically determine their functional 
consequences. In this review, we present some examples of CFTR alterations that 
affect splicing events and the different therapeutic options that are currently 
developed and tested for splice switching.

Adopting and maintaining a healthy lifestyle in low SES families: How the 
experience of motherhood shapes responses to dietary and physical activity 
public health guidance.

BACKGROUND: Public health guidance and associated interventions seek to bring 
about change in diet and physical activity behaviours to improve life expectancy 
and healthy life expectancy in the population. Low socioeconomic status (SES) 
groups suffer from reduced life/healthy life expectancy compared with the 
population as a whole. This in-depth qualitative study, investigates the lives 
and experiences of mothers with young children living in a low SES area in a 
London (UK) borough, to understand the context in which current public health 
guidance on diet and physical activity is received and viewed, and how this 
understanding could be used to inform the development of public health guidance 
and interventions for this group.
METHODS: The mothers (n = 20), were recruited from a Surestart Centre, 
Children's Centres and through the local branch of a national charity. The 
mothers took part in a series of three in depth interviews over two years 
(2016-2017). Thematic analysis was used to generate an iterative set of codes 
informing an understanding of motherhood, diet and physical activity.
RESULTS: Motherhood was found to be a major factor for understanding and 
interpreting how women in low SES areas respond to public health guidance on 
diet and physical activity. The mothers were well informed about dietary 
guidance, considered that provision of healthy food was critical to the 
mothering role, but found it difficult to implement the guidance in their own 
lives. In contrast, physical activity was not seen as integral to the mothering 
role, although it was acknowledged that it played a part in ensuring that the 
mothers remained healthy enough to fulfil all their duties. Constrained by the 
ethic of care, and a lack of material and time resources, the mothers 
prioritised their family's health above their own. This study, enabled the 
mothers to articulate ideas for interventions that would be supportive of a 
healthy lifestyle and of practical application in their busy lives.
CONCLUSIONS: Mothers from this low SES area responded differently to the public 
health guidance on diet and on physical activity. Whilst providing and modelling 
a healthy diet was seen as an essential part of the mother's role, participating 
in leisure based physical activity was problematic, and unless carefully framed, 
could be perceived as selfish behaviour, inappropriate for the "good" mother.

BACKGROUND: Fibrodysplasia Ossificans Progressiva (FOP) is a genetic, 
progressive and devastating disease characterized by severe heterotopic 
ossification (HO), loss of mobility and early death. There are no FDA approved 
medications. The STOPFOP team identified AZD0530 (saracatinib) as a potent 
inhibitor of the ALK2/ACVR1-kinase which is the causative gene for this rare 
bone disease. AZD0530 was proven to prevent HO formation in FOP mouse models. 
The STOPFOP trial investigates the repositioning of AZD0530, originally 
developed for ovarian cancer treatment, to treat patients with FOP.
METHODS: The STOPFOP trial is a phase 2a study. It is designed as a European, 
multicentre, 6-month double blind randomized controlled trial of AZD0530 versus 
placebo, followed by a 12-month trial comparing open-label extended AZD0530 
treatment with natural history data as a control. Enrollment will include 20 FOP 
patients, aged 18-65 years, with the classic FOP mutation (ALK2 R206H). The 
primary endpoint is objective change in heterotopic bone volume measured by 
low-dose whole-body computer tomography (CT) in the RCT phase. Secondary 
endpoints include 18F NaF PET activity and patient reported outcome measures.
DISCUSSION: Clinical trials in rare diseases with limited study populations pose 
unique challenges. An ideal solution for limiting risks in early clinical 
studies is drug repositioning - using existing clinical molecules for new 
disease indications. Using existing assets may also allow a more fluid 
transition into clinical practice. With positive study outcome, AZD0530 may 
provide a therapy for FOP that can be rapidly progressed due to the availability 
of existing safety data from 28 registered clinical trials with AZD0530 
involving over 600 patients.

BACKGROUND: TB continues to impose a significant healthcare burden despite 
advancement in diagnostics and increased availability of effective 
antimicrobials. Recent years have seen a resurgence of the disease in 
association with increasing life expectancy and use of immunosuppressive 
therapy. Mortality remains high in TB patients requiring admission to critical 
care units.METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study in two public hospitals 
to determine factors associated with mortality in patients with TB requiring 
critical care admission. All patients aged ≥21 years with a diagnosis of active 
TB involving any organ system at the time of a critical care admission were 
eligible. The primary outcome measure was 30-day mortality.RESULTS: Over the 
study period of 4 years, 148 patients were identified. Overall 30-day mortality 
was 36.5%. Based on multivariate analysis, factors which independently 
correlated with 30-day mortality include higher APACHE II (Acute Physiology and 
Chronic Health Evaluation II) score, acid-fast bacilli smear positivity, 
initiation of anti-TB treatment prior to critical care admission and need for 
renal replacement therapy.CONCLUSION: TB in critically ill patients continues to 
be associated with significant mortality. The factors identified to be 
associated with poor survival outcomes in our study were largely related to 
greater disease burden and potential for suboptimal treatment.

A novel water-soluble mannogalactan (SSPS1) with an average molecular weight of 
2.04 × 104 Da was obtained from the fruiting bodies of the Sanghuangporus 
sanghuang. It revealed that SSPS1 was composed of d-galactose, d-mannose, 
l-fucose, 3-O-methylgalactose and d-glucose in a ratio of 6.2:3.9:3.1:2.1:1.0. 
The structural elucidation of SSPS1 consisted of 1, 6-linked α-D-Galp, 1, 
6-linked α-D-Manp and 1, 6-linked 3-O-methyl-α-D-Galp backbone with branching at 
O-2 of 1, 6-α-D-mannosyl residues by α-L-Fucp and α-D-Glcp units. The 
conformational parameters suggested that a flexible chain conformation of SSPS1 
in solution based on light scattering and atomic force microscopy imaging. 
Intriguingly, it presented potent anticancer activity on HepG2 cell with Rq and 
Ra values increased dramatically up to 73.93 nm and 53.92 nm compared with the 
control. The analysis of flow cytometry indicated SSPS1 could induce the 
apoptosis of HepG2 cells and arrest them via S phase. Western blot assay further 
uncovered that apoptosis process was triggered by SSPS1 via a 
mitochondria-mediated signaling pathway, which was evidenced by an increased 
ratio of Bax/Bcl-2, the release of cytochrome c and the strong activation of 
caspase-3 and 9. Taken together, these results suggested that SSPS1 might be 
applied in functional food as an anticancer agent.

INTRODUCTION: The recent POLDER trial investigated the effects of external beam 
radiotherapy (EBRT) on dysphagia caused by incurable oesophageal cancer. An 
estimated life expectancy of minimally three months was required for inclusion. 
However, nearly one-third of the included patients died within three months. The 
aim of this study was to investigate if the use of prediction models could have 
improved the physician's estimation of the patient's survival.
METHODS: Data from the POLDER trial (N = 110) were linked to the Netherlands 
Cancer Registry to retrieve patient, tumour, and treatment characteristics. Two 
published prediction models (the SOURCE model and Steyerberg model) were used to 
predict three-month survival for all patients included in the POLDER trial. 
Predicted survival probabilities were dichotomised and the accuracy, 
sensitivity, specificity, and the area under the curve (AUC) were used to 
evaluate the predictive performance.
RESULTS: The SOURCE and Steyerberg model had an accuracy of 79% and 64%, and an 
AUC of 0.76 and 0.60 (p = .017), respectively. The SOURCE model had higher 
specificity across survival cut-off probabilities, the Steyerberg model had a 
higher sensitivity beyond the survival probability cut-off of 0.7. Using optimal 
cut-off probabilities, SOURCE would have wrongfully included 16/110 patients 
into the POLDER and Steyerberg 34/110.
CONCLUSION: The SOURCE model was found to be a more useful decision aid than the 
Steyerberg model. Results showed that the SOURCE model could be used for 
three-month survival predictions for patients that are considered for palliative 
treatment of dysphagia caused by oesophageal cancer in addition to clinicians' 
judgement.

BACKGROUND: The purpose of the present work is to provide a fresh, simple, and 
accessible document for all surgeons who treat traumatic hemorrhage from the 
head and neck.
METHODS: This article arose from the work of a consortium of experienced trauma 
surgeons who collaborated to produce a first-of-its-kind surgical course for 
multifocal hemorrhage control. The "Bloody Simple Hemorrhage control masterclass 
course" has been offered at national and international venues since 2019 and has 
been both well received by participants and well regarded in academic trauma 
surgical circles. This paper-and the series of articles which accompany it-was 
meant to be a literature companion to or extension of the Bloody Simple course, 
a way to distill and digest the hemorrhage control strategies espoused therein 
but in the form of a journal article.
RESULTS: The result of this work is a succinct and experience-based set of 
principles for conquering life-threatening, traumatic bleeding from a variety of

Évaluation neuropsychologique des adultes porteurs d’une trisomie 21 en 
Consultation mémoire : quels outils ? Une revue de la littérature.

[Article in French]

Coquelet A, Besozzi A, Roussel M, Lemetayer F.

Résumé L'augmentation de l'espérance de vie des personnes porteuses d'une 
trisomie 21 (PPT21) s'accompagne de nouvelles problématiques telles que le 
déclin cognitif lié au vieillissement et le dépistage/diagnostic de la maladie 
d'Alzheimer (MA). À travers une revue de la littérature, cet article recense les 
principaux outils existants pour l'évaluation neuropsychologique de cette 
population. À partir des bases de données PsycINFO, PubMed, Web of Science, 
Wiley et le moteur de recherches Google Scholar, ont été inclus dans l'étude les 
articles publiés de juillet à décembre 2020, concernant les PPT21 d'âge 
supérieur ou égal à 18 ans et contenant des échelles d'évaluation cognitive. 
Quatre-vingt-cinq articles ont été sélectionnés qui comprenaient 186 outils 
d'évaluation. La quasi-totalité de ces épreuves n'a toutefois pas fait l'objet 
de validation en langue française et moins d'un tiers étaient spécifiquement 
conc¸us pour une évaluation diagnostique de la MA chez des PPT21. L'objectif de 
cette revue est de souligner la nécessité de développer des outils 
neuropsychologiques spécifiques pour le diagnostic de MA chez les PPT21, validés 
en langue française. Abstract Improvement of life expectancy in people with Down 
syndrome (DS) is associated with new problems such as cognitive decline 
associated with aging and screening/diagnosis for Alzheimer's disease (AD) in 
this population. The aim of this review is to identify the main tools used in 
the literature for the cognitive evaluation in this population. Research was 
conducted on PsycINFO, PubMed, Web of Science and Wiley databases and Google 
Scholar from July to November 2020, concerning persons with DS, aged of 18 years 
or more, and evaluated with cognitive assessment scales.196 assessment tools 
were identified among the 85 articles included. However, most tools had not been 
validated in French, and only one third were specifically designed for a 
diagnosis of AD in people with DS. These results underline the need to develop 
specific tools for the diagnosis of AD in people with DS and validated in 
French.

BACKGROUND: Valvular heart disease (VHD) is a prominent problem in healthcare 
today with mitral regurgitation (MR) being the leading cause of VHD in the 
elderly population. While mitral valve repair (MVr) surgery is one of the only 
options for the end-stage disease, octogenarians are often denied MVr due to 
concerns with operative mortality and postoperative morbidity. To provide 
information on this underrepresented group of surgical patients, a systematic 
approach was taken to review the mortality and morbidity rates of octogenarians 
who received MVr.
METHODS: Pubmed and Medline were searched for articles containing outcomes of 
octogenarians receiving surgical mitral valve repair (SMVr) or transcatheter 
mitral valve repair (TMVr) published after 2000. Ten articles met the inclusion 
criteria for a total of 7968 patients included in the analysis using Microsoft 
Excel, Version 2105.
RESULTS: Short-term mortality rates for SMVr and TMVr were 2.6% and 1.4% for 
in-hospital, and 7.8% and 3.3% for 30 days, respectively. The average incidence 
of stroke, acute kidney injury, infection, and major bleeding for SMVr were 
3.2%, 11.2%, 7.7%, and 24%, respectively, and 0.3%, 6.7%, 2.7%, and 7.9% for 
TMVr, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Octogenarians receiving SMVr or TMVr experienced similar rates of 
short-term mortality and morbidity as younger populations, and when considering 
life expectancy, midterm mortality was also similar. With these results, denying 
octogenarians MVr operations based on age alone should be reconsidered. 
Depending on risk factors and comorbidities, either SMVr or TMVr is a viable and 
relatively safe option for octogenarians with severe MR.

BACKGROUND: Length of stay can have a large impact on overall surgical costs. 
Several studies have demonstrated that a shortened length of stay is safe and 
effective after microvascular breast reconstruction. The optimal length of stay 
from a cost-utility perspective is not known.
METHODS: The authors used a decision tree model to evaluate the cost-utility, 
from the perspective of the hospital, of a variety of length-of-stay strategies. 
Health state probabilities were estimated from an institutional chart review. 
Expected costs and quality-adjusted life-years were assessed using Monte Carlo 
simulation and sensitivity analyses.
RESULTS: Over a 10-year period, the authors' overall flap loss and take-back 
rates were 1.6 percent and 4.9 percent, respectively. After rollback, a 3-day 
length of stay was identified as the most cost-effective strategy, with an 
expected cost of $41,680.19 and an expected health utility of 25.68 
quality-adjusted life-years. Monte Carlo sensitivity analysis confirmed that 
discharge on postoperative day 3 was the most cost-effective strategy in the 
majority of simulations when the willingness-to-pay threshold varied from 
$50,000 to $130,000 per quality-adjusted life-year gained.
CONCLUSION: This cost-utility analysis suggests that a 3-day length of stay is 
the most cost-effective strategy after microvascular breast reconstruction.

Endometriosis is a gynecological disease affecting about 10% of the female 
population. The multifactorial hormonal, inflammatory, genetic, mental and 
behavior pathogenesis can result in chronic pelvic pain, blooding disorders and 
infertility causing disruption of quality of life. Correct diagnosis of the 
extension and topography is substantial in defining the adequate therapeutic 
strategy. In an increasing proportion of the cases, endometriosis is being 
managed medically and para-medically; diagnostic or therapeutic surgery can 
often be avoided or delayed. Transvaginal sonography is considered being the 
first-line imaging method in the diagnosis of pelvic endometriosis. The paradigm 
shift from the belief that endometriosis only affects women of reproductive age 
has drawn attention to endometriosis in both premenarchal and postmenopausal 
patients. This review resumes the actually recommended ultrasound signs in the 
case of patients in menstrual age. Specific diagnostic approaches in adolescent 
and menopausal patients are highlighted.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: No consensus exists on adequate surveillance of 
conservatively managed unruptured intracranial aneurysms (UIAs). We aimed to 
determine optimal MRI surveillance strategies for the growth of UIAs using 
cost-effectiveness analysis. A secondary aim was to develop a clinical tool for 
personalizing UIA surveillance.
METHODS: We designed a microsimulation model from a health care perspective 
simulating 100,000 55-year-old women to estimate costs and quality-adjusted life 
years (QALYs) over a lifetime horizon in the United States, the United Kingdom, 
and the Netherlands, using literature-derived model parameters. Country-specific 
costs and willingness-to-pay thresholds ($100,000/QALY for the United States, 
£30,000/QALY for the United Kingdom, and €80,000/QALY for the Netherlands) were 
used. Lifetime costs and QALYs were annually discounted at 3% for the United 
States, 3.5% for the United Kingdom, or 4% (costs) and 1.5% (QALYs) for the 
Netherlands. Strategies were no follow-up surveillance, follow-up with MRI in 
the first and fifth year after UIA discovery, every 5 years, every 2 years, or 
annually, or immediate intervention (i.e., clipping or coiling). Using the 
microsimulation model, we developed a tool for personalizing UIA surveillance 
for men and women, with different ages and varying aneurysm characteristics. 
Uncertainty in the input parameters was modeled with probabilistic sensitivity 
analysis.
RESULTS: Among 55-year-old women, 2,222 individuals in the United States, 1,910 
in the United Kingdom, and 2,040 in the Netherlands needed to undergo an annual 
MRI scan to prevent 1 case of subarachnoid hemorrhage per year. No surveillance 
MRI was most cost-effective in the United States (in 47% of the simulations) and 
United Kingdom (in 54% of simulations), whereas annual MRI was most 
cost-effective in the Netherlands (in 53% of simulations). In the United States 
and United Kingdom, annual surveillance or surveillance in the first and fifth 
year after discovery was cost-effective in patients <60 years and at increased 
risk of aneurysm growth. The optimal, personalized, surveillance strategies were 
summarized in a look-up table for use in clinical practice.
DISCUSSION: Generally, the US and UK physicians should refrain from assigning 
patients, particularly older patients and those with few risk factors for 
aneurysm growth or rupture, to frequent MRI surveillance. In the Netherlands, 
annual follow-up is generally most cost-effective.

Population aging is a global phenomenon and with it, the number of bone 
fractures increases due to higher incidences of osteoporosis. Bone fractures in 
the elderly increase the risk of bedridden status and mortality. Therefore, the 
control of osteoporosis and bone fracture is important for healthy life 
expectancy, and the fundamental understanding of its pathogenesis and its 
application in treatment is of great social significance. To solve these 
clinical problems, it is necessary to integrate clinical medicine and basic 
research. Bone regeneration after a fracture is an essential function of the 
living body. The prevailing view is that a small number of resident skeletal 
stem cells are solely responsible for regenerative capacity. Although these 
cells have long been considered to be in the bone marrow, it has been shown that 
they are also present in the growth plate and periosteum. More recently, 
distinct types of cells in the bone marrow, including bone marrow stromal cells, 
osteoblast progenitor cells, and osteoblasts, have been shown to participate in 
bone regeneration. Interestingly, the cellular plasticity of differentiated 
cells, rather than active recruitment of resident stem cell populations, may 
largely account for regeneration of bone tissues; terminally differentiated 
cells de-differentiate into a stem cell-like state, and then re-differentiate 
into regenerating bone. In this review, we discuss the clinical risk and 
preventive therapy of bone fractures and the current concept of bone 
regeneration in basic mechanical insights, which may prove useful to both 
clinicians and researchers.

Reduced intensity conditionings (RIC) before after allogeneic hematopoietic stem 
cell transplantation (HSCT) allow older or unfit patients of being transplanted, 
but survival expectancy and burden of late complications are poorly described in 
this setting. All patients (N = 456) who were alive and relapse-free 2 years 
after HSCT following RIC were included. Cumulative incidences (CI), standardized 
incidence, or mortality, ratio (SIR or SMR), and competing risk models were 
used. The 10-year CIs of relapse and non-relapse mortality incidences were 13.9 
and 13.4%, respectively. Seventy-eight patients died, late relapse being the 
most frequent cause of death leading to a SMR of 6.38 (95% CI, 5.1-8.0; 
p < 0.001). Among non-relapsing patients (n = 412), 30 died (SMR 4.38; 95% CI, 
3.3-5.8: p < 0.001). A total of 37 patients developed 41 SM leading to a 10-year 
cumulative incidence of 12.9%, and a significant SIR relative to the general 
population (1.4). Finally, we found high CI of cardiovascular (CVC) and venous 
thromboembolic complications (VTE) (10-year CI; 15.1% and 11.7%, respectively). 
Older age was the only significant risk factor for CVC and VTE in multivariable 
analysis. In conclusion, with life expectancy rate of 70%, late survivors after 
RIC warrants long-term follow-up and active intervention on averting 
cardiovascular disease and screening cancers.

Pistachio is one of the valuable, very nutritious, and high-energy fruits that 
is mainly dried and used as a snack due to problems with storage. Therefore, to 
investigate on how to extend clustered fresh pistachios' shelf-life, the effects 
of various packaging and storage conditions on the pistachios are presented in 
this study. Thus, clustered in-hull fresh pistachios were packaged in: (a) 
Polyethylene film, 45 µm in thickness; (b) 
polypropylene/polyethylene/polyamide/polyethylene/aluminum foil multilayer film, 
90 µm in thickness; (c) both films with alcoholic paper; in air, and under two 
gas mixtures of 88%N2 + 10%CO2 + 2%O2 and 83%N2 + 15%CO2 + 2%O2 . Samples were 
refrigerated at 5 ± 1°C for 3 months. Quality factors such as moisture content, 
weight loss, respiration rate, pH, texture, and appearance of the samples were 
monitored for fresh pistachio kernels and clustered pistachios. Data were 
analyzed in a completely randomized design using one-way analysis of variance. 
The results showed that the shelf-life of MAP samples drastically increased 
compared to the control (packages without gaseous and alcoholic paper). A 
comparison of means among the groups suggests that the multilayer bags of fresh 
clustered pistachios with a mixture of 83%N2 + 15%CO2 + 2%O2 for a 3-month 
storage period is a particularly effective treatment. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: It 
is the first time that fresh pistachio is packaged in clusters (bundle). It 
seems that the packaging of fresh pistachio clusters, in addition to the 
benefits mentioned in this paper has a psychological effect on the consumer in 
terms of the naturalness of this product and has added value due to being 
considered an organic, luxurious, and delicacy food product. Therefore, in this 
study, the active MAP method that includes the technique of injecting carbon 
dioxide, nitrogen, and oxygen into the packaging was used to investigate its 
effects on the properties and shelf-life of raw clustered pistachios for fresh 
consumption.

AIM: Percutaneous endoscopic colostomy (PEC) represents an important 
intervention in specific patients. Limited data currently exist. We present the 
largest recorded study of patients undergoing PEC.
METHODS: Retrospective analysis of consultant logbooks highlighted all patients 
from 1997 to 2020. Two independent reviewers assessed records. Parameters 
measured were age, sex, indication, number of sites, complications, mortality 
and survival. Three subgroups were identified: recurrent sigmoid volvulus (RSV), 
pseudo-obstruction and neurogenic. ANOVA, chi-squared and Fischer's exact tests 
were utilized; Kaplan-Meier curves estimated survival and the log-rank test was 
applied. A p value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant.
RESULTS: Ninety-six PEC insertions were done on 91 patients (five reinsertions). 
There were 66 men (69%) and the mean age was 73.1 years (interquartile range 
23). The indications were RSV n = 72, pseudo-obstruction n = 13, neurogenic 
n = 11. The 30-day complication rate was overall n = 27 (28%), RSV n = 23, 
pseudo-obstruction n = 4. Nine patients leaked (9.9%) (eight RSV, one 
pseudo-obstruction), of whom five died. 90-day mortality was 14.6% (14 
patients), 18.5% (13/72) for RSV, 7.7% (1/13) for pseudo-obstruction. Overall 
recurrence following PEC was 10.4%. The median follow-up was 25 months 
(interquartile range 4.6-62.2 months). At 3, 5 and 10 years survival was 46%, 
34% and 26% for RSV, 70%, 55% and 15% for pseudo-obstruction and 91%, 91% and 
81% for neurogenic respectively.
CONCLUSION: Recurrent sigmoid volvulus and pseudo-obstruction patients 
undergoing PEC compared to neurogenic patients have poorer outcomes with higher 
complication rates and shorter life expectancy. We advocate that high volume 
specialist units undertake PEC. The significant associated risks of PEC require 
careful consideration when determining patient suitability. Utilizing risk 
stratification scores may help guide shared decision making between patients, 
relatives and clinicians.

BACKGROUND/AIMS: The treatment of superficial esophageal neoplasms (SENs) in 
cirrhotic patients is challenging and rarely investigated. We evaluated the 
outcomes of endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) to determine the efficacy and 
safety of treating SENs in patients with liver cirrhosis.
METHODS: The baseline characteristics and treatment outcomes of patients who 
underwent ESD for SENs between November 2005 and December 2017 were 
retrospectively reviewed.
RESULTS: ESD was performed in 437 patients with 481 SENs, including 15 cirrhotic 
patients with 17 SENs. En bloc resection (88.2% vs. 97.0%) and curative 
resection (64.7% vs. 78.9%) rates were not different between the cirrhosis and 
non-cirrhosis groups (p=0.105 and p=0.224, respectively). Bleeding was more 
common in cirrhotic patients (p=0.054), and all cases were successfully 
controlled endoscopically. The median procedure and hospitalization duration did 
not differ between the groups. Overall survival was lower in cirrhotic patients 
(p=0.003), while disease-specific survival did not differ between the groups 
(p=0.85).
CONCLUSION: ESD could be a safe and effective treatment option for SENs in 
patients with cirrhosis. Detailed preprocedural assessments are needed, 
including determination of liver function, esophageal varix status, and 
remaining life expectancy, to identify patients who will obtain the greatest 
benefit.
