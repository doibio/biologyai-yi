tomography scan of the neck prior to transfer revealed a large anterior cervical 
osteophyte causing significant airway narrowing. Fiberoptic evaluation confirmed 
the radiologic finding of near-complete airway obstruction. The patient's 
respiratory status rapidly deteriorated and he subsequently underwent an 
emergent awake tracheostomy to secure his airway.
CONCLUSION: Given the rarity of DISH and the increase in life expectancy, 
clinicians should be aware of this disease entity and its potential for acute 
life-threatening respiratory presentation.

Argentina.

Larvae of the robber fly Mallophora ruficauda are ectoparasitoids of white grubs 
and adults are an important apiculture pest in Argentina. Females oviposit on 
tall grasses and the second instar larva actively searches and locates hosts. 
There are nine potential hosts in the distribution area of this parasitoid and 
Cyclocephala signaticollis (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae) is the most parasitized in 
the field. However, M. ruficauda has a certain degree of behavioural flexibility 
towards different host species, and not being a strict specialist. The 
conditions under which the parasitoid orientates and accepts different hosts' 
species are unknown. We studied the host specificity of M. ruficauda towards 
three species of Cyclocephala genus and we determined whether this specificity 
depends on larval age. We also evaluated whether larva orientation towards 
Cyclocephala species changes with chemical cue concentration. We assessed host 
specificity measuring the orientation and acceptance behaviours towards 
kairomones extracts and live individuals of Cyclocephala species using M. 
ruficauda larvae of low and high life expectancy (i.e., young and aged second 
instar larvae). We observed that young larvae orientated only towards C. 
signaticollis chemical stimulus, whereas aged larvae orientated also towards C. 
modesta, and the same was observed with increasing stimuli's concentration. Both 
young and aged M. ruficauda larvae orientate towards live C. signaticollis and 
C. putrida species and rejected C. modesta. Also, we found that larvae accepted 
all Cyclocephala hosts. In conclusion, our results indicate that specificity in 
the laboratory, observed through host orientation and host acceptance 
behaviours, depends not only on the availability of host species, but also on 
the nature of the host's stimuli combined with parasitoid age.

Improvements in cancer survival and life expectancy have placed a focus on 
long-term risks following a primary cancer, including that of developing other 
primary malignancies. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the risk, in 
patients with respiratory tract cancers, of developing a second primary 
malignancy.
METHODS: Standardized incidence ratios (SIR) of observed to expected cases were 
calculated for residents of Umbria diagnosed with laryngeal and lung cancer 
between 1994 and 2008. Significance and 95% confidence intervals were determined 
assuming a Poisson distribution.
RESULTS: In total, 189 and 340 cases of second primary cancers were observed 
respectively among laryngeal and lung cancer patients. Male laryngeal cancer 
patients were found to have a significantly increased risk of lung cancer 
(SIR=4.10), non-melanoma skin cancer (SIR=2.10), bladder cancer (SIR=2.25) and 
pancreatic cancer (SIR=3.85). In females, a significantly increased risk was 
observed only when all sites combined were considered. Male lung cancer patients 
were found to have a significantly increased risk for laryngeal cancer 
(SIR=4.36), esophageal cancer (SIR=3.97), kidney cancer (SIR=3.40), multiple 
myeloma and malignant plasma cell neoplasm (SIR=2.97), bladder cancer (SIR=2.20) 
and non-melanoma skin cancer (SIR=1.55). In females, the risk of developing a 
second cancer was higher but was not significant for non-melanoma skin cancers, 
colon and breast cancer.
CONCLUSIONS: Study results show an excess risk of other primary malignancies in 
respiratory tract cancer patients, particularly males. This may be due to shared 
risk factors, genetic susceptibility, effect of first cancer treatments and 
increased diagnostic surveillance.

[Completeness of mortality statistics in Navarra, Spain].

[Article in Spanish]

Moreno-Iribas C, Guevara M, Díaz-González J, Álvarez-Arruti N, Casado I, 
Delfrade J, Larumbe E, Aguirre J, Floristán Y.

BACKGROUND: Women in the region of Navarra, Spain, have one of the highest life 
expectancies at birth in Europe. The aim of this study is to assess the 
completeness of the official mortality statistics of Navarra in 2009 and the 
impact of the under-registration of deaths on life expectancy estimates.
METHODS: Comparison of the number of deaths in Navarra using the official 
statistics from the Instituto Nacional de Estadística (INE) and the data derived 
from a multiple-source case-finding: the electronic health record, Instituto 
Navarro de Medicina Legal and INE including data that they received late.
RESULTS: 5,249 deaths were identified, of which 103 were not included in the 
official mortality statistics. Taking into account only deaths that occurred in 
Spain, which are the only ones considered for the official statistics, the 
completeness was 98.4%. Estimated life expectancy at birth in 2009 descended 
from 86.6 years to 86.4 in women and from 80.0 to 79.6 years in men, after 
correcting for undercount.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study ruled out the existence of significant 
under-registration of the official mortality statistics, confirming the 
exceptional longevity of women in Navarra, who are in the top position in Europe 
with a life expectancy at birth of 86.4 years.

Marginal semiparametric multivariate accelerated failure time model with 
generalized estimating equations.

Author information:
(1)Department of Mathematics and Statistics, University of Minnesota, Duluth, 
Duluth, MN, USA.

The semiparametric accelerated failure time (AFT) model is not as widely used as 
the Cox relative risk model due to computational difficulties. Recent 
developments in least squares estimation and induced smoothing estimating 
equations for censored data provide promising tools to make the AFT models more 
attractive in practice. For multivariate AFT models, we propose a generalized 
estimating equations (GEE) approach, extending the GEE to censored data. The 
consistency of the regression coefficient estimator is robust to 
misspecification of working covariance, and the efficiency is higher when the 
working covariance structure is closer to the truth. The marginal error 
distributions and regression coefficients are allowed to be unique for each 
margin or partially shared across margins as needed. The initial estimator is a 
rank-based estimator with Gehan's weight, but obtained from an induced smoothing 
approach with computational ease. The resulting estimator is consistent and 
asymptotically normal, with variance estimated through a multiplier resampling 
method. In a large scale simulation study, our estimator was up to three times 
as efficient as the estimateor that ignores the within-cluster dependence, 
especially when the within-cluster dependence was strong. The methods were 
applied to the bivariate failure times data from a diabetic retinopathy study.

A GLP-1 receptor agonist conjugated to an albumin-binding domain for extended 
half-life.

Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and related peptide agonists have been 
extensively investigated for glycaemic control in Type 2 diabetes, and may also 
have therapeutic applications for other diseases. Due to the short half-life 
(t1/2  < 2 min) of the endogenous peptide, caused by proteolytic degradation and 
renal clearance, different strategies for half-life extension and sustained 
release have been explored. In the present study, conjugates between a GLP-1 
analogue and a 5 kDa albumin-binding domain (ABD) derived from streptococcal 
protein G have been chemically synthesized and evaluated. ABD binds with high 
affinity to human serum albumin, which is highly abundant in plasma and 
functions as a drug carrier in the circulation. Three different GLP-1-ABD 
conjugates, with the two peptides connected by linkers of two, four, and six PEG 
units, respectively, were synthesized and tested in mouse pancreatic islets at 
high (11 mM) and low (3 mM) glucose concentration. Insulin release upon 
stimulation was shown to be glucose-dependent, showing no significant difference 
between the three different GLP-1-ABD conjugates and unconjugated GLP-1 
analogue. The biological activity, in combination with the high affinity binding 
to albumin, make the GLP-1-ABD conjugates promising GLP-1 receptor agonists 
expected to show extended in vivo half-life.

The global burden of musculoskeletal conditions for 2010: an overview of 
methods.

The objective of this paper is to provide an overview of methods used for 
estimating the burden from musculoskeletal (MSK) conditions in the Global Burden 
of Diseases 2010 study. It should be read in conjunction with the 
disease-specific MSK papers published in Annals of Rheumatic Diseases. Burden 
estimates (disability-adjusted life years (DALYs)) were made for five specific 
MSK conditions: hip and/or knee osteoarthritis (OA), low back pain (LBP), 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA), gout and neck pain, and an 'other MSK conditions' 
category. For each condition, the main disabling sequelae were identified and 
disability weights (DW) were derived based on short lay descriptions. Mortality 
(years of life lost (YLLs)) was estimated for RA and the rest category of 'other 
MSK', which includes a wide range of conditions such as systemic lupus 
erythematosus, other autoimmune diseases and osteomyelitis. A series of 
systematic reviews were conducted to determine the prevalence, incidence, 
remission, duration and mortality risk of each condition. A Bayesian 
meta-regression method was used to pool available data and to predict prevalence 
values for regions with no or scarce data. The DWs were applied to prevalence 
values for 1990, 2005 and 2010 to derive years lived with disability. These were 
added to YLLs to quantify overall burden (DALYs) for each condition. To estimate 
the burden of MSK disease arising from risk factors, population attributable 
fractions were determined for bone mineral density as a risk factor for 
fractures, the occupational risk of LBP and elevated body mass index as a risk 
factor for LBP and OA. Burden of Disease studies provide pivotal guidance for 
governments when determining health priority areas and allocating resources. 
Rigorous methods were used to derive the increasing global burden of MSK 
conditions.

OBJECTIVES: To estimate the global burden of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), as part 
of the Global Burden of Disease 2010 study of 291 conditions and how the burden 
of RA compares with other conditions.
METHODS: The optimum case definition of RA for the study was the American 
College of Rheumatology 1987 criteria. A series of systematic reviews were 
conducted to gather age-sex-specific epidemiological data for RA prevalence, 
incidence and mortality. Cause-specific mortality data were also included. Data 
were entered into DisMod-MR, a tool to pool available data, making use of 
study-level covariates to adjust for country, region and super-region random 
effects to estimate prevalence for every country and over time. The 
epidemiological data, in addition to disability weights, were used to calculate 
years of life lived with disability (YLDs). YLDs were added to the years of life 
lost due to premature mortality to estimate the overall burden 
(disability-adjusted life years (DALYs)) for RA for the years 1990, 2005 and 
2010.
RESULTS: The global prevalence of RA was 0.24% (95% CI 0.23% to 0.25%), with no 
discernible change from 1990 to 2010. DALYs increased from 3.3 million (M) (95% 
CI 2.6 M to 4.1 M) in 1990 to 4.8 M (95% CI 3.7 M to 6.1 M) in 2010. This 
increase was due to a growth in population and increase in aging. Globally, of 
the 291 conditions studied, RA was ranked as the 42nd highest contributor to 
global disability, just below malaria and just above iodine deficiency (measured 
in YLDs).
CONCLUSIONS: RA continues to cause modest global disability, with severe 
consequences in the individuals affected.

The potential effects of tobacco control in China: projections from the China 
SimSmoke simulation model.

Oncology, Georgetown University, Washington, DC 20007, USA.

OBJECTIVE: To use a computer simulation model to project the potential impact in 
China of tobacco control measures on smoking, as recommended by the World Health 
Organization Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC), being fully 
implemented.
DESIGN: Modelling study.
SETTING: China.
POPULATION: Males and females aged 15-74 years.
INTERVENTION: Incremental impact of more complete implementation of WHO FCTC 
policies simulated using SimSmoke, a Markov computer simulation model of tobacco 
smoking prevalence, smoking attributable deaths, and the impact of tobacco 
control policies. Data on China's adult population, current and former smoking 
prevalence, initiation and cessation rates, and past policy levels were entered 
into SimSmoke in order to predict past smoking rates and to project future 
status quo rates. The model was validated by comparing predicted smoking 
prevalence with smoking prevalence measured in tobacco surveys from 1996-2010.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Projected future smoking prevalence and smoking 
attributable deaths from 2013-50.
RESULTS: Status quo tobacco policy simulations projected a decline in smoking 
prevalence from 51.3% in 2015 to 46.5% by 2050 in males and from 2.1% to 1.3% in 
females. Of the individual FCTC recommended tobacco control policies, increasing 
the tobacco excise tax to 75% of the retail price was projected to be the most 
effective, incrementally reducing current smoking compared with the status quo 
by 12.9% by 2050. Complete and simultaneous implementation of all FCTC policies 
was projected to incrementally reduce smoking by about 40% relative to the 2050 
status quo levels and to prevent approximately 12.8 million smoking attributable 
deaths and 154 million life years lost by 2050.
CONCLUSIONS: Complete implementation of WHO FCTC recommended policies would 
prevent more than 12.8 million smoking attributable deaths in China by 2050. 
Implementation of FCTC policies would alleviate a substantial portion of the 
tobacco related health burden that threatens to slow China's extraordinary gains 
in life expectancy and prosperity.

Environmental influences such as perinatal stress have been shown to program the 
developing organism to adapt brain and behavioral functions to cope with daily 
life challenges. Evidence is now accumulating that the specific and individual 
effects of early life adversity on the functional development of brain and 
behavior emerge as a function of the type, intensity, timing and the duration of 
the adverse environment, and that early life stress (ELS) is a major risk factor 
for developing behavioral dysfunctions and mental disorders. Results from 
clinical as well as experimental studies in animal models support the hypothesis 
that ELS can induce functional "scars" in prefrontal and limbic brain areas, 
regions that are essential for emotional control, learning and memory functions. 
On the other hand, the concept of "stress inoculation" is emerging from more 
recent research, which revealed positive functional adaptations in response to 
ELS resulting in resilience against stress and other adversities later in life. 
Moreover, recent studies indicate that early life experiences and the resulting 
behavioral consequences can be transmitted to the next generation, leading to a 
transgenerational cycle of adverse or positive adaptations of brain function and 
behavior. In this review we propose a unifying view of stress vulnerability and 
resilience by connecting genetic predisposition and programming sensitivity to 
the context of experience-expectancy and transgenerational epigenetic traits. 
The adaptive maturation of stress responsive neural and endocrine systems 
requires environmental challenges to optimize their functions. Repeated 
environmental challenges can be viewed within the framework of the 
match/mismatch hypothesis, the outcome, psychopathology or resilience, depends 
on the respective predisposition and on the context later in life.

Taste plays a crucial role in the life of honey bees as their survival depends 
on the collection and intake of nectar and pollen, and other natural products. 
Here we studied the tarsal taste of honey bees through a series of behavioral 
and electrophysiological analyses. We characterized responsiveness to various 
sweet, salty and bitter tastants delivered to gustatory sensilla of the fore 
tarsi. Behavioral experiments showed that stimulation of opposite fore tarsi 
with sucrose and bitter substances or water yielded different outcomes depending 
on the stimulation sequence. When sucrose was applied first, thereby eliciting 
proboscis extension, no bitter substance could induce proboscis retraction, thus 
suggesting that the primacy of sucrose stimulation induced a central excitatory 
state. When bitter substances or water were applied first, sucrose stimulation 
could still elicit proboscis extension but to a lower level, thus suggesting 
central inhibition based on contradictory gustatory input on opposite tarsi. 
Electrophysiological experiments showed that receptor cells in the gustatory 
sensilla of the tarsomeres are highly sensitive to saline solutions at low 
concentrations. No evidence for receptors responding specifically to sucrose or 
to bitter substances was found in these sensilla. Receptor cells in the 
gustatory sensilla of the claws are highly sensitive to sucrose. Although bees 
do not possess dedicated bitter-taste receptors in the tarsi, indirect bitter 
detection is possible because bitter tastes inhibit sucrose receptor cells of 
the claws when mixed with sucrose solution. By combining behavioral and 
electrophysiological approaches, these results provide the first integrative 
study on tarsal taste detection in the honey bee.

OBJECTIVE: We assessed the change over time in the contribution of maternal 
mortality to a life expectancy calculated between ages 15 and 49, or 
Reproductive-Aged Life Expectancy (RALE). Our goal was to estimate the increase 
in RALE in developed countries over the twentieth century and the hypothetical 
gains in African countries today by eliminating maternal mortality.
METHODS: Analogous to life expectancy, RALE is calculated from a life table of 
ages 15 to 49. Specifically, RALE is the average number of years that women at 
age 15 would be expected to live between 15 and 49 with current mortality rates. 
Associated single decrement life tables of causes of death other than maternal 
mortality are explored to assess the possible gains in RALE by reducing or 
eliminating maternal mortality. We used population-based data from the Human 
Mortality Database and the Demographic and Health Surveys.
FINDINGS: In developed countries, five years in RALE were gained over the 
twentieth century, of which approximately 10%, or half a year, was attributable 
to reductions in maternal mortality. In sub-Saharan African countries, the 
possible achievable gains fluctuate between 0.24 and 1.47 years, or 6% and 44% 
of potential gains in RALE.
CONCLUSIONS: Maternal mortality is a rare event, yet it is still a very 
important component of RALE. Averting the burden of maternal deaths could return 
a significant increase in the most productive ages of human life.

Organization, Geneva, Switzerland.

BACKGROUND: The WHO has established the disability-adjusted life year (DALY) as 
a metric for measuring the burden of human disease and injury globally. However, 
most DALY estimates have been calculated as national totals. We mapped spatial 
variation in the burden of human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) in Uganda for the 
years 2000-2009. This represents the first geographically delimited estimation 
of HAT disease burden at the sub-country scale.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) totals for 
HAT were estimated based on modelled age and mortality distributions, mapped 
using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) software, and summarised by parish 
and district. While the national total burden of HAT is low relative to other 
conditions, high-impact districts in Uganda had DALY rates comparable to the 
national burden rates for major infectious diseases. The calculated average 
national DALY rate for 2000-2009 was 486.3 DALYs/100 000 persons/year, whereas 
three districts afflicted by rhodesiense HAT in southeastern Uganda had burden 
rates above 5000 DALYs/100 000 persons/year, comparable to national GBD 2004 
average burden rates for malaria and HIV/AIDS.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These results provide updated and improved estimates 
of HAT burden across Uganda, taking into account sensitivity to under-reporting. 
Our results highlight the critical importance of spatial scale in disease burden 
analyses. National aggregations of disease burden have resulted in an implied 
bias against highly focal diseases for which geographically targeted 
interventions may be feasible and cost-effective. This has significant 
implications for the use of DALY estimates to prioritize disease interventions 
and inform cost-benefit analyses.

This paper describes our approach for fostering and facilitating communication 
among patients and caregivers in the context of shared decision making, i.e., 
when decisions must be taken not only on the basis of scientific evidence but 
also of the patient's preferences and context. This happens because clinical 
practice guidelines cannot provide recommendations for every possible situation, 
and cannot foresee every change in a patient's context, which might imply the 
deviation from a previously acknowledged recommendation. Within the EU-funded 
project MobiGuide (www.mobiguide-project.eu), supporting remote patient 
management, we propose decision theory as a methodological framework for a tool 
that, during face to face encounters, is used to tailor pre-defined, generic 
decision models to the individual patient, by involving the patient himself in 
the customization of the model parameters. Although this approach is not 
appropriate for all patients, it leads, in well-chosen cases, to a more informed 
choice, with potentially better treatment compliance.

Environmental exposure in indigenous communities: an international perspective.

Carpenter DO.

There are more than 7000 spoken languages in the world today and many others 
that have already disappeared. The number of languages in relation to the number 
of countries (192 members of the United Nations) gives some indication of the 
number of indigenous communities there are in the world. Many of these 
communities are at various stages of integration into more dominant cultures, 
but many others struggle to maintain a traditional lifestyle. Many are 
subsistence communities that depend upon local sources of food and whose way of 
life is threatened by encroachment of more dominant cultures. There are, of 
course, different environmental threats in the various communities, but they 
fall into several categories that are common to many of them. There is often 
lack of access to medical care and disease-protective actions like 
immunizations. There is greater vulnerability than in more conventional 
societies to inclement weather, and this will become more serious with climate 
change. There is often contamination of local traditional animal and plant foods 
by chemicals because of long-range transport of contaminants by air or water or 
because of industries located in geographic areas close to indigenous 
communities where there is little governmental regulation. Life expectancy in 
many indigenous communities is much less than in more developed mainstream 
societies. However, these problems, which are widely viewed as being caused by 
poverty and lack of education, are balanced by the value to these communities of 
maintaining a traditional lifestyle that would otherwise simply disappear into 
the mainstream cultures of the various countries.

Among the several prognostic factors of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), age 
is the most prominent. It is well known that elderly PTC patients have poorer 
prognoses. Here we investigated the prognostic impact of young age in univariate 
and multivariate analyses. We retrospectively analyzed 5,733 PTC patients 
without distant metastasis at presentation, who underwent initial surgery at 
Kuma Hospital. The median follow-up period was 150 months. We classified the 
patients into three groups: young (< 30 years), middle-aged (30-59), and older 
patients (≥ 60 years). The tumor size was larger and clinical node positivity 
was higher in the young patients, and significant extrathyroid extension was 
higher in the older patients compared to the other two groups. In the univariate 
analysis, the young patients showed poorer extrathyroidal locoregional and 
distant recurrence rates than the middle-aged patients, but not cause-specific 
survival rates. In the multivariate analysis, age < 30 years was an independent 
or marginal predictor of extrathyroidal locoregional and distant recurrence, but 
not of carcinoma-related death. Age ≥ 60 years independently affected PTC 
recurrence and death. Taken together, we should carefully treat young PTC 
patients because of the likeliness of extrathyroidal locoregional and distant 
recurrence, which may not be life-threatening.

[Part I. End-stage chronic organ failures: a position paper on shared care 
planning. The Integrated Care Pathway].

[Article in Italian]

Gristina GR, Orsi L, Carlucci A, Causarano IR, Formica M, Romanò M; Gruppo di 
Lavoro Insufficienze Croniche d'Organo.

In Italy the birth rate decrease together with the continuous improvement of 
living conditions on one hand, and the health care progress on the other hand, 
led in recent years to an increasing number of patients with chronic mono- or 
multi-organ failures and in an extension of their life expectancy. However, the 
natural history of chronic failures has not changed and the inescapable 
disease's worsening at the end makes more rare remissions, increasing hospital 
admissions rate and length of stay. Thus, when the "end-stage" get close 
clinicians have to engage the patient and his relatives in an advance care 
planning aimed to share a decision making process regarding all future 
treatments and related ethical choices such as patient's best interests, rights, 
values, and priorities. A right approach to the chronic organ failures end-stage 
patients consists therefore of a careful balance between the new powers of 
intervention provided by the biotechnology and pharmacology (intensive care), 
both with the quality of remaining life supplied by physicians to these patients 
(proportionality and beneficence) and the effective resources rationing and 
allocation (distributive justice). However, uncertainty still marks the criteria 
used by doctors to assess prognosis of these patients in order to make decisions 
concerning intensive or palliative care. The integrated care pathway suggested 
in this position paper shared by nine Italian medical societies, has to be 
intended as a guide focused to identify end-stage patients and choosing for them 
the best care option between intensive treatments and palliative care.

OBJECTIVE: To estimate the global burden of hip and knee osteoarthritis (OA) as 
part of the Global Burden of Disease 2010 study and to explore how the burden of 
hip and knee OA compares with other conditions.
METHODS: Systematic reviews were conducted to source age-specific and 
sex-specific epidemiological data for hip and knee OA prevalence, incidence and 
mortality risk. The prevalence and incidence of symptomatic, radiographic and 
self-reported hip or knee OA were included. Three levels of severity were 
defined to derive disability weights (DWs) and severity distribution (proportion 
with mild, moderate and severe OA). The prevalence by country and region was 
multiplied by the severity distribution and the appropriate disability weight to 
calculate years of life lived with disability (YLDs). As there are no deaths 
directly attributed to OA, YLDs equate disability-adjusted life years (DALYs).
RESULTS: Globally, of the 291 conditions, hip and knee OA was ranked as the 11th 
highest contributor to global disability and 38th highest in DALYs. The global 
age-standardised prevalence of knee OA was 3.8% (95% uncertainty interval (UI) 
3.6% to 4.1%) and hip OA was 0.85% (95% UI 0.74% to 1.02%), with no discernible 
change from 1990 to 2010. Prevalence was higher in females than males. YLDs for 
hip and knee OA increased from 10.5 million in 1990 (0.42% of total DALYs) to 
17.1 million in 2010 (0.69% of total DALYs).
CONCLUSIONS: Hip and knee OA is one of the leading causes of global disability. 
Methodological issues within this study make it highly likely that the real 
burden of OA has been underestimated. With the aging and increasing obesity of 
the world's population, health professions need to prepare for a large increase 
in the demand for health services to treat hip and knee OA.

IMPORTANCE: No highly effective interventions to prevent delirium have been 
identified.
OBJECTIVE: To examine whether ramelteon, a melatonin agonist, is effective for 
the prevention of delirium.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A multicenter, rater-blinded, randomized 
placebo-controlled trial was performed in intensive care units and regular acute 
wards of 4 university hospitals and 1 general hospital. Eligible patients were 
65 to 89 years old, newly admitted due to serious medical problems, and able to 
take medicine orally. Patients were excluded from the study if they had an 
expected stay or life expectancy of less than 48 hours.
INTERVENTIONS: Sixty-seven patients were randomly assigned using the sealed 
envelope method to receive ramelteon (8 mg/d; 33 patients) or placebo (34 
patients) every night for 7 days.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Incidence of delirium, as defined by the Diagnostic 
and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fourth Edition).
RESULTS: Ramelteon was associated with a lower risk of delirium (3% vs 32%; P 
= .003), with a relative risk of 0.09 (95% CI, 0.01-0.69). Even after risk 
factors were controlled for, ramelteon was still associated with a lower 
incidence of delirium (P = .01; odds ratio, 0.07 [95% CI, 0.008-0.54]). The 
Kaplan-Meier estimates of time to development of delirium were 6.94 (95% CI, 
6.82-7.06) days for ramelteon and 5.74 (5.05-6.42) days for placebo. Comparison 
by log-rank test showed that the frequency of delirium was significantly lower 
in patients taking ramelteon than in those taking placebo (χ(2) = 9.83; P 
= .002).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Ramelteon administered nightly to elderly patients 
admitted for acute care may provide protection against delirium. This finding 
supports a possible pathogenic role of melatonin neurotransmission in delirium.

Outcome of dialysis patients aged seventy years or above--a retrospective 
analysis.

Basel, Switzerland;

OBJECTIVE: Due to increased life expectancy, there is a growing number of older 
patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring renal replacement therapy 
(RRT). However, there is a lack of data with regard to clinical outcomes of 
these patients.
METHODS: In this single-centre study, we retrospectively analysed two groups of 
patients on chronic haemodialysis, stratified by age. A group of patients ≥70 
years of age ("seniors"; n = 69) was compared with a control group of patients 
60 to 69 years of age ("elderly"; n = 39). The major outcomes that we 
investigated were: patient survival, causes of death, and type and frequency of 
complications.
RESULTS: Kaplan-Meier curves revealed only a trend towards better survival in 
the elderly (p = 0.06). During the observation time, about half of the patients 
died: 38/69 in the senior group and 14/39 in the elderly group (p = 0.07). The 
cause of death was mostly unknown. Both groups were affected equally by 
complications during haemodialysis therapy (p = 0.62). For the severity of 
complications, the only significant difference was a higher frequency of 
complications with outpatient treatment in seniors (p = 0.04). However, there 
were not more severe complications leading to hospitalisation in seniors (p = 
0.64).
CONCLUSION: Age is not a good predictor for the outcome of patients of 70 years 
of age or older with ESRD requiring RRT and thus age alone should never guide us 
in the decision-making process as to whether to start dialysis or not in these 
patients.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to assess the cost effectiveness of 
commonly used antidepressants as first-line treatment of major depressive 
disorder (MDD) in Belgium.
METHODS: The model structure was based on a decision tree developed by the 
Swedish TLV (Tandvårds- och läkemedelsförmånsverket) and adapted to the Belgium 
healthcare setting, using primary local data on the patterns of treatment and 
following KCE [Federal Knowledge Center (Federaal Kenniscentrum voor de 
Gezondheidszorg)] recommendations. Comparators were escitalopram, citalopram, 
fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline, duloxetine, venlafaxine, and mirtazapine. In 
the model, patients not achieving remission or relapsing after remission on the 
assessed treatment moved to a second therapeutic step (titration, switch, 
add-on, or transfer to a specialist). In case of failure in the second step or 
following a suicide attempt, patients were assumed to be referred to secondary 
care. The time horizon was 1 year and the analysis was conducted from the 
National Institute for Health and Disability Insurance (NIHDI; national health 
insurance) and societal perspectives. Remission rates were obtained from the TLV 
network meta-analysis and risk of relapse, efficacy following therapeutic 
change, risk of suicide attempts and related death, utilities, costs (2012), and 
resources were derived from the published literature and expert opinion. The 
effect of uncertainty in model parameters was estimated through scenario 
analyses and a probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA).
RESULTS: In the base-case analysis, escitalopram was identified as the optimal 
strategy: it dominated all other treatments except venlafaxine from the NIHDI 
perspective, against which it was cost effective with an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio of <euro>6,352 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). 
Escitalopram also dominated all other treatments from the societal perspective. 
At a threshold of <euro>30,000 per QALY and from the NIHDI perspective, the PSA 
showed that the probability of escitalopram being identified as the optimal 
strategy ranged from 61 % (vs. venlafaxine) to 100 % (vs. fluoxetine).
CONCLUSION: Escitalopram was associated with the highest probability of being 
the optimal treatment from the NIHDI and societal perspectives. This analysis, 
based on new Belgian clinical practice data and following KCE requirements, 
provides additional information that may be used to guide the choice of 
treatments in the management of MDD in Belgium.

The Contribution of Health Care and Other Interventions to Black-White 
Disparities in Life Expectancy, 1980-2007.

Black-white mortality disparities remain sizable in the United States. In this 
study, we use the concept of avoidable/amenable mortality to estimate 
cause-of-death contributions to the difference in life expectancy between whites 
and blacks by gender in the United States in 1980, 1993, and 2007. We begin with 
a review of the concept of "avoidable mortality" and results of prior studies 
using this cause-of-death classification. We then present the results of our 
empirical analyses. We classified causes of death as amenable to medical care, 
sensitive to public health policies and health behaviors, ischemic heart 
disease, suicide, HIV/AIDS, and all other causes combined. We used vital 
statistics data on deaths and Census Bureau population estimates and standard 
demographic decomposition techniques. In 2007, causes of death amenable to 
medical care continued to account for close to 2 years of the racial difference 
in life expectancy among men (2.08) and women (1.85). Causes amenable to public 
health interventions made a larger contribution to the racial difference in life 
expectancy among men (1.17 years) than women (0.08 years). The contribution of 
HIV/AIDS substantially widened the racial difference among both men (1.08 years) 
and women (0.42 years) in 1993, but its contribution declined over time. Despite 
progress observed over the time period studied, a substantial portion of 
black-white disparities in mortality could be reduced given more equitable
