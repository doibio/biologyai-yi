Methods to Adjust Willingness-to-Pay Measures for Severity of Illness.

OBJECTIVES: Both private sector organizations and governmental health agencies 
increasingly use illness severity measures to adjust willingness-to-pay 
thresholds. Three widely discussed methods-absolute shortfall (AS), proportional 
shortfall (PS), and fair innings (FI)-all use ad hoc adjustments to 
cost-effectiveness analysis methods and "stair-step" brackets to link illness 
severity with willingness-to-pay adjustments. We assess how these methods 
compare with microeconomic expected utility theory-based methods to value health 
gains.
METHODS: We describe standard cost-effectiveness analysis methods, the basis 
from which AS, PS, and FI make severity adjustments. We then develop how the 
Generalized Risk Adjusted Cost Effectiveness (GRACE) model assesses value for 
differing illness and disability severity. We compare AS, PS, and FI against 
value as defined by GRACE.
RESULTS: AS, PS, and FI have major and unresolved differences between them in 
how they value various medical interventions. Compared with GRACE, they fail to 
properly incorporate illness severity or disability. They conflate gains in 
health-related quality of life and life expectancy incorrectly and confuse the 
magnitude of treatment gains with value per quality-adjusted life-year. 
Stair-step methods also introduce important ethical concerns.
CONCLUSIONS: AS, PS, and FI disagree with each other in major ways, 
demonstrating that at most, one correctly describes patients' preferences. GRACE 
offers a coherent alternative, based on neoclassical expected utility 
microeconomic theory, and can be readily implemented in future analyses. Other 
approaches that depend on ad hoc ethical statements have yet to be justified 
using sound axiomatic approaches.

BACKGROUND: There is a dearth of evidence on the cost-effectiveness of a 
combination of population-based primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention and 
control strategies for rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease. The present 
analysis evaluated the cost-effectiveness and distributional effect of primary, 
secondary, and tertiary interventions and their combinations for the prevention 
and control of rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease in India.
METHODS: A Markov model was constructed to estimate the lifetime costs and 
consequences among a hypothetical cohort of 5-year-old healthy children. Both 
health system costs and out-of-pocket expenditure (OOPE) were included. OOPE and 
health-related quality-of-life were assessed by interviewing 702 patients 
enrolled in a population-based rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease 
registry in India. Health consequences were measured in terms of life-years and 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) gained. Furthermore, an extended 
cost-effectiveness analysis was undertaken to assess the costs and outcomes 
across different wealth quartiles. All future costs and consequences were 
discounted at an annual rate of 3%.
FINDINGS: A combination of secondary and tertiary prevention strategies, which 
had an incremental cost of ₹23 051 (US$30) per QALY gained, was the most 
cost-effective strategy for the prevention and control of rheumatic fever and 
rheumatic heart disease in India. The number of rheumatic heart disease cases 
prevented among the population belonging to the poorest quartile (four cases per 
1000) was four times higher than the richest quartile (one per 1000). Similarly, 
the reduction in OOPE after the intervention was higher among the poorest income 
group (29·8%) than among the richest income group (27·0%).
INTERPRETATION: The combined secondary and tertiary prevention and control 
strategy is the most cost-effective option for the management of rheumatic fever 
and rheumatic heart disease in India, and the benefits of public spending are 
likely to be accrued much more by those in the lowest income groups. The 
quantification of non-health gains provides strong evidence for informing policy 
decisions by efficient resource allocation on rheumatic fever and rheumatic 
heart disease prevention and control in India.

INTRODUCTION: To ensure that the evidence generated by health technology 
assessment (HTA) is translated to policy, it is important to generate a 
threshold value against which the outcomes of HTA studies can be compared. In 
this context, the present study delineates the methods that will be deployed to 
estimate such a value for India.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The proposed study will deploy a multistage sampling 
approach considering economic and health status for selection of states, 
followed by selection of districts based on Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) 
and identification of primary sampling units (PSUs) using the 30-cluster 
approach. Further, households within PSU will be identified using systematic 
random sampling and block randomisation based on gender will be done to select 
respondent from the household. A total of 5410 respondents will be interviewed 
for the study. The interview schedule will comprise of three sections including 
background questionnaire to elicit socioeconomic and demographic 
characteristics, followed by assessment of health gains, and willingness to pay 
(WTP). To assess the health gains and corresponding WTP, the respondent will be 
presented with hypothetical health states. Using time trade off method, the 
respondent will indicate the amount of time he/she is willing to give up at the 
end of life to avoid morbidities in the hypothetical health condition. Further, 
respondents will be interviewed about their WTP for treatment of respective 
hypothetical conditions using contingent valuation technique. These estimates of 
health gains and corresponding WTP will then be combined to ascertain the value 
of WTP per quality-adjusted life year.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The ethical approval has been obtained from the 
Institutional Ethics Committee (IEC) of Postgraduate Institute of Medical 
Education and Research, Chandigarh, India. The study outcomes will be made 
available for general use and interpretation of HTA studies commissioned by 
India's central HTA Agency.

Globally, gender-neutral Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination programmes are 
gaining traction. Although cervical cancer remains the most prevalent, other 
HPV-related cancers are increasingly recognised as important, especially among 
men who have sex with men. We assessed if including adolescent boys in 
Singapore's school-based HPV vaccination programme is cost-effective from the 
healthcare perspective. We adapted a World Health Organization-supported model, 
Papillomavirus Rapid Interface for Modelling and Economics, and modelled the 
cost and quality-adjusted life years (QALY) associated with vaccinating 
13-year-olds with the HPV vaccine. Cancer incidence and mortality rates were 
obtained from local sources and adjusted based on the expected direct and 
indirect vaccine protection for various population subgroups at an 80 % vaccine 
coverage. Moving to a gender-neutral vaccination programme with a bivalent or 
nonavalent vaccine could avert 30 (95 % uncertainty interval [UI]: 20-44) and 34 
(95 % UI: 24-49) HPV-related cancers per birth cohort, respectively. At a 3 % 
discount rate, a gender-neutral vaccination programme is not cost-effective. 
However, with a 1.5 % discount rate, which puts more value on long-term health 
gains from vaccination, moving to a gender-neutral vaccination programme with 
the bivalent vaccine is likely cost-effective, with an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio of SGD$19 007 (95 % UI: 10 164-30 633) per QALY gained. 
The findings suggest the need to engage experts to examine, in detail, the 
cost-effectiveness of gender-neutral vaccination programmes in Singapore. Issues 
of drug licensing, feasibility, gender equity, global vaccine supplies, and the 
global trend towards disease elimination/eradication should also be considered. 
This model provides a simplified method for resource-strapped countries to gain 
a preliminary estimate of the cost-effectiveness of a gender-neutral HPV 
vaccination programme before investing resources for further research.

Pre-eclampsia is a life-threatening disease of pregnancy unique to humans and a 
leading cause of maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality. Women who 
survive pre-eclampsia have reduced life expectancy, with increased risks of 
stroke, cardiovascular disease and diabetes, while babies from a pre-eclamptic 
pregnancy have increased risks of preterm birth, perinatal death and 
neurodevelopmental disability and cardiovascular and metabolic disease later in 
life. Pre-eclampsia is a complex multisystem disease, diagnosed by sudden-onset 
hypertension (>20 weeks of gestation) and at least one other associated 
complication, including proteinuria, maternal organ dysfunction or 
uteroplacental dysfunction. Pre-eclampsia is found only when a placenta is or 
was recently present and is classified as preterm (delivery <37 weeks of 
gestation), term (delivery ≥37 weeks of gestation) and postpartum pre-eclampsia. 
The maternal syndrome of pre-eclampsia is driven by a dysfunctional placenta, 
which releases factors into maternal blood causing systemic inflammation and 
widespread maternal endothelial dysfunction. Available treatments target 
maternal hypertension and seizures, but the only 'cure' for pre-eclampsia is 
delivery of the dysfunctional placenta and baby, often prematurely. Despite 
decades of research, the aetiology of pre-eclampsia, particularly of term and 
postpartum pre-eclampsia, remains poorly defined. Significant advances have been 
made in the prediction and prevention of preterm pre-eclampsia, which is 
predicted in early pregnancy through combined screening and is prevented with 
daily low-dose aspirin, starting before 16 weeks of gestation. By contrast, the 
prediction of term and postpartum pre-eclampsia is limited and there are no 
preventive treatments. Future research must investigate the pathogenesis of 
pre-eclampsia, in particular of term and postpartum pre-eclampsia, and evaluate 
new prognostic tests and treatments in adequately powered clinical trials.

BACKGROUND: Before the COVID-19 pandemic, many long-term care (LTC) homes 
experienced difficulties in providing residents with access to primary care, 
typically delivered by community-based family physicians or nurse practitioners 
(NPs). During the pandemic, legislative changes in Ontario, Canada enabled NPs 
to act in the role of Medical Directors thereby empowering NPs to work to their 
full scope of practice. Emerging from this new context, it remains unclear how 
NPs and physicians will best work together as primary care providers. 
NP/physician collaborative models appear key to achieving optimal resident 
outcomes. This scoping review aims to map available evidence on existing 
collaborative models of care between NPs and physicians within LTC homes.
METHODS: The review will be guided by the research question, "What are the 
structures, processes and outcomes of collaborative models of care involving NPs 
and Physicians in LTC homes?" This scoping review will be conducted according to 
the methods framework for scoping reviews outlined by Arksey and O'Malley and 
refined by Levac et al., Colquhoun et al., and Daudt et al., as well as the 
Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for 
Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) Statement. Electronic databases (MEDLINE, 
Embase + Embase Classic, APA PsycInfo, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled 
Trials, AMED, CINAHL, Ageline, and Scopus), grey literature, and reference lists 
of included articles will be searched. English language studies that describe NP 
and physician collaborative models within the LTC setting will be included.
DISCUSSION: This scoping review will consolidate what is known about existing 
NP/physician collaborative models of care in LTC homes. Results will be used to 
inform the development of a collaborative practice framework for long-term care 
clinical leadership.

BACKGROUND: According to the European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy 
guidelines, self-expandable metal stents (SEMSs) are preferable to plastic 
stents (PSs) in the management of pancreatic cancer, regardless of cancer stage. 
The aim of this study was to compare the therapeutic efficacy and treatment 
costs of SEMS and PS in the management of malignant biliary obstruction.
METHODS: One hundred and thirty-five patients who underwent endoscopic stent 
placement were retrospectively enrolled and divided into PS (41 patients), 
primary SEMS (39 patients) and secondary SEMS (55 patients) groups. We 
determined the technical and functional success rate, stent patency, and 
cumulative treatment cost.
RESULTS: A total of 111 SEMSs and 153 PSs were placed with similar technical 
(100% vs. 98.69%) and functional success rate (90.10% vs. 86.27%) but with 
different stent patency (10.28 vs. 22.16 weeks; p < 0.001). Multiple PS 
implantations and larger stent diameter increased the length of stent patency 
compared to 7-Fr PSs (10.88 vs. 10.55 vs. 7.63 weeks, respectively). The 
cumulative treatment cost of patients with different survival times did not 
differ significantly between groups, however, among patients surviving 
2-4 months it was higher in PS group than primary SEMS and secondary SEMS groups 
(2888€ vs. 2258€ vs. 2144€, respectively, p = 0.3369) due to increased number of 
biliary reintervention (2.08 ± 1.04 vs. 1.20 ± 0.42 vs. 1.50 ± 0.53; p < 0.0274) 
and longer hospital stay (15.77 ± 10.14 vs. 8.70 ± 7.70 vs. 8.50 ± 6.17 days, 
p = 0.0527).
CONCLUSIONS: In view of treatment costs, the consequences of illness, and the 
processes of the health care system, SEMS implantation is recommended regardless 
of patients' life expectancy.

A growing number of geroprotectors have demonstrated healthspan extension in 
young animals, but the effectiveness of these therapies when commenced in 
midlife or later has been under-studied. We and others have shown that much like 
calorie restriction (CR), restriction of specific nutrients, including total 
protein, the three branched-chain amino acids leucine, isoleucine, and valine, 
or isoleucine alone, can promote lifespan and metabolic health. While CR is less 
efficacious when starting in late life, the effects of interventions restricting 
amino acids in late life on healthy aging is unknown. Here, we investigate the 
metabolic, molecular, and physiological effects of consuming diets with a 67% 
reduction of either all amino acids (Low AA) or of isoleucine alone (Low Ile) in 
male and female C57BL/6J.Nia mice starting at 20 months of age. We find that 
both diets reduce adiposity in aged mice; however, these diets decreased lean 
mass, and did not show significant improvements in frailty or fitness. The 
glucose tolerance of both male and female mice consuming Low Ile and Low AA 
diets were improved. We also observed a moderate increase in energy expenditure 
and respiratory exchange ratio induced by the two dietary interventions. In the 
hearts of aged female mice, Low Ile reversed age-associated changes in heart 
rate and stroke volume, returning cardiac function to similar levels as observed 
in young mice. We found that both Low AA and Low Ile diets promoted a more 
youthful molecular cardiac profile, preventing age-dependent increases in 
phosphatidylglycerols. These results demonstrate that Low AA and Low Ile diets 
can improve aspects of metabolic health in aged mice of both sexes, and has 
positive effects on cardiac health in aged females, suggesting that these 
dietary interventions are translationally promising for promoting healthy aging 
even in older people.

Background: Local muscle fatigue may have an adverse effect on the biomechanics 
of the lunge movement and athletic performance. This study analyzed the 
biomechanical indicators of the forward lunge in badminton players before and 
after fatigue of the ankle dorsiflexors. Methods: Using the isometric muscular 
strength testing system, 15 badminton players underwent an ankle dorsiflexor 
fatigue test. Before and after the fatigue experiment, five lunges were done in 
both the forehand forward (FH) and backhand forward (BH) directions, five in 
each direction. A Vicon motion capture system and an AMTI force measuring 
station were used to record lower limb kinematic and ground reaction force 
(GRF). Pre-fatigue and post-fatigue variability were determined using 
paired-samples t-tests, Wilcoxon signed rank test, and Statistical 
Non-parametric Mapping (SNPM). Result: The results showed that after fatigue, 
the peak angle of ankle dorsiflexion was significantly reduced (p = 0.034), the 
range of motion (ROM) of the ankle sagittal plane (p = 0.000) and peak angle of 
ankle plantarflexion (p = 0.001) was significantly increased after forehand 
landing. After fatigue, ankle inversion was significantly increased after 
forehand and backhand landings (FH: p = 0.033; BH: p = 0.015). After fatigue, 
peak knee flexion angles increased significantly (FH: Max: p = 0.000, Min: p = 
0.000; BH: Max: p = 0.017, Min: p = 0.037) during forehand and backhand landings 
and ROM in knee flexion and extension increased (p = 0.009) during forehand 
landings. Knee inversion range of motion was significantly increased after 
fatigue (p = 0.024) during forehand landings. Peak hip flexion angle (p = 0.000) 
and range of motion (p = 0.000) were significantly reduced in forehand landings 
after fatigue. The mean loading rate (p = 0.005) and the maximum loading rate (p 
= 0.001) increased significantly during backhand landings after fatigue. 
Post-fatigue, the center of pressure (COP) frontal offset increased 
significantly (FH: p = 0.000; BH: p = 0.000) in the forehand and backhand 
landings. Conclusion: These results indicate that when the ankle dorsiflexors 
are fatigued, the performance of the forehand is significantly negatively 
affected, and the impact force of the backhand is greater.

OBJECTIVE: This study was undertaken to evaluate the long-term clinical efficacy 
of epoetin alfa and darbepoetin alfa in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome 
(MDS) in a real-life setting.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 204 patients with low-risk or 
intermediate-1-risk MDS who received epoetin alfa or darbepoetin alfa were 
included. Hemoglobin levels and transfusion needs were recorded before treatment 
and at 12 months, 24 months, 36 months, and 48 months of treatment.
RESULTS: At the 36-month (p=0.025) and 48-month (p=0.022) visits, epoetin alfa 
yielded significantly higher hemoglobin levels compared to darbepoetin alfa. 
Transfusion needs were also significantly lower with epoetin alfa compared to 
darbepoetin alfa at 24 months (p=0.012) and in the low-risk group compared to 
the intermediate-risk group at 24 months (p=0.018), 36 months (p=0.025), and 48 
months (p<0.001). Treatment response rates at the 24-month, 36-month, and 
48-month visits in the epoetin alfa (43.0%, 33.6%, and 27.1%), darbepoetin alfa 
(29.9%, 22.7%, and 16.5%), low-risk (39.3%, 30.0%, and 26.0%), and 
intermediate-risk (29.6%, 24.1%, and 11.1%) groups were lower than those 
obtained at 12 months, and the values differed significantly for the 36-month 
and 48-month visits with values ranging from p<0.05 to p<0.001.
CONCLUSION: This real-life long-term ESA extension study investigated the 
clinical efficacy of epoetin alfa and darbepoetin alfa for up to 48 months, 
revealing that treatment efficacy reached a plateau starting from the 24th month 
of therapy with a continuing decrease in treatment response rates regardless of 
treatment type, risk status, or gender. Nonetheless, significantly higher 
hemoglobin levels and marked improvement in transfusion needs were evident in 
epoetin-treated patients compared to darbepoetin-treated patients and in the 
low-risk group compared to the intermediate-risk group.

There have been many population-based genomic studies on human-managed honeybees 
(Apis mellifera and Apis cerana), but there has been a notable lack of analysis 
with regard to wild honeybees, particularly in relation to their evolutionary 
history. Nevertheless, giant honeybees have been found to occupy distinct 
habitats and display remarkable characteristics, which are attracting an 
increased amount of attention. In this study, we de novo sequenced and then 
assembled the draft genome sequence of the Himalayan giant honeybee, Apis 
laboriosa. Phylogenetic analysis based on genomic information indicated that A. 
laboriosa and its tropical sister species Apis dorsata diverged ∼2.61 Ma, which 
supports the speciation hypothesis that links A. laboriosa to geological changes 
throughout history. Furthermore, we re-sequenced A. laboriosa and A. dorsata 
samples from five and six regions, respectively, across their population ranges 
in China. These analyses highlighted major genetic differences for Tibetan A. 
laboriosa as well as the Hainan Island A. dorsata. The demographic history of 
most giant honeybee populations has mirrored glacial cycles. More importantly, 
contrary to what has occurred among human-managed honeybees, the demographic 
history of these two wild honeybee species indicates a rapid decline in 
effective population size in the recent past, reflecting their differences in 
evolutionary histories. Several genes were found to be subject to selection, 
which may help giant honeybees to adapt to specific local conditions. In 
summary, our study sheds light on the evolutionary and adaptational 
characteristics of two wild giant honeybee species, which was useful for giant 
honeybee conservation.

BACKGROUND: This study develops a new concept, dual functionality, that 
integrates physical and cognitive function. We use the concept to define a 
measure of dual-function life expectancy (2FLE) and assess racial-ethnic 
inequalities in aging.
METHODS: Drawing on data from the National Health Interview Survey Linked 
Mortality Files and the Health and Retirement Study, we define dual 
functionality as having no limitations in activities of daily living and being 
free of dementia. We use this measure and Sullivan life tables to estimate 
age-50 total life expectancy and age-50 2FLE for women and men across 4 
racial-ethnic and nativity groups.
RESULTS: At ages 50-54, between 79.0% (95% CI: 73.5, 84.5) and 87.6% (95% CI: 
84.0, 91.2) of (non-Hispanic) Black, foreign-born Hispanic, and U.S.-born 
Hispanic women and men remain dual functional as compared with 90.4% (95% CI: 
89.3, 91.4) and 91.4% (95% CI: 90.2, 92.5) of (non-Hispanic) White women and 
men, respectively. These and corresponding racial-ethnic disparities in dual 
functionality through ages 85 and older translate into substantial inequalities 
in 2FLE. For instance, the Black-White gap in age-50 2FLE is 6.9 years (95% CI: 
-7.5, -6.4) for women and 6.0 years (95% CI: -6.6, -5.4) for men.
CONCLUSIONS: Black, foreign-born Hispanic, and U.S.-born Hispanic older adults 
are estimated to live a smaller percentage of their remaining years with dual 
functionality than White older adults. These results reveal stark racial-ethnic 
inequalities in aging that have significant implications for quality of life, 
caregiving, and health needs.

Counting young birds: A simple tool for the determination of avian population 
parameters.

Population parameters are usually determined from mark-recapture experiments 
requiring laborious field work. Here, we present a model-based approach that can 
be applied for the determination of avian population parameters such as average 
individual life expectancy, average age in the population, and generation length 
from age-differentiated bird counts. Moreover, the method presented can also 
create age-specific results from lifetime averages using a deterministic 
exponential function for the calculation of parameters of interest such as 
age-dependent mortality and age distribution in the population. The major 
prerequisites for application of this method are that young and adult birds are 
easily distinguishable in the field as well as the existence of sufficiently 
large data sets for error minimization. Large data sets are nowadays often 
available through the existence of so-called "citizen science" databases. 
Examples for the determination of population parameters are given for 
long-living migratory birds which travel as families in large groups such as the 
Common Crane and the Whooper Swan. Other examples include long-living partially 
migratory birds staying together in large flocks which do not travel as families 
such as the Black-headed Gull, and also short-living songbirds where at least 
from one sex young and adult birds are easily differentiable such as the male 
Black Redstart.

The PII superfamily consists of widespread signal transduction proteins found in 
all domains of life. In addition to canonical PII proteins involved in C/N 
sensing, structurally similar PII-like proteins evolved to fulfill diverse, yet 
poorly understood cellular functions. In cyanobacteria, the bicarbonate 
transporter SbtA is co-transcribed with the conserved PII-like protein, SbtB, to 
augment intracellular inorganic carbon levels for efficient CO2 fixation. We 
identified SbtB as a sensor of various adenine nucleotides including the second 
messenger nucleotides cyclic AMP (cAMP) and c-di-AMP. Moreover, many SbtB 
proteins possess a C-terminal extension with a disulfide bridge of potential 
redox-regulatory function, which we call R-loop. Here, we reveal an unusual 
ATP/ADP apyrase (diphosphohydrolase) activity of SbtB that is controlled by the 
R-loop. We followed the sequence of hydrolysis reactions from ATP over ADP to 
AMP in crystallographic snapshots and unravel the structural mechanism by which 
changes of the R-loop redox state modulate apyrase activity. We further gathered 
evidence that this redox state is controlled by thioredoxin, suggesting that it 
is generally linked to cellular metabolism, which is supported by physiological 
alterations in site-specific mutants of the SbtB protein. Finally, we present a 
refined model of how SbtB regulates SbtA activity, in which both the apyrase 
activity and its redox regulation play a central role. This highlights SbtB as a 
central switch point in cyanobacterial cell physiology, integrating not only 
signals from the energy state (adenyl-nucleotide binding) and the carbon supply 
via cAMP binding but also from the day/night status reported by the C-terminal 
redox switch.

INTRODUCTION: Integrative and complementary health practices (ICHP) question the 
hegemony of the biomedical, technical and hospital paradigm, as they are an 
important axis in the process of redefining the health care model. Understanding 
how ICHP are offered to the elderly population can help to improve the 
production of changes in care and in the daily life of health services.
OBJECTIVE: To identify and summarize the scientific evidence on the provision of 
ICHP for the elderly in health services.
METHODS: This is a research protocol for a scoping review following the 
recommendations of the Extension for Scoping Reviews method proposed by the 
Joanna Briggs Institute. Studies will be collected in the following databases, 
Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature, Web of Science, Scopus, 
Scielo, Online System for Searching and Analyzing Medical Literature (MEDLINE), 
Embase, Virtual Library in Health and gray literature. Two independent reviewers 
will perform screening, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment using the 
Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Assessment Checklist. For the quality of 
evidence, the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation 
analysis will be used.
RESULTS: This review will provide information on the provision of ICHP for the 
elderly population in health services.
CONCLUSIONS: This scoping review will provide evidence to help health 
professionals, managers and users to recognize more effective therapeutic 
inventions for promoting, preventing and protecting comprehensive health at 
different levels of care.
