proximal femur depends on multiple parameters, life expectancy and fracture risk 
being the most important ones. If survival is estimated to be less than 6 weeks, 
surgery is generally not indicated. Beyond 6 weeks, surgical indication 
essentially depends on location of the metastases on the proximal femur and the 
presence of a fracture.

Publisher: L’augmentation de l’espérance de vie s’accompagne d’une croissance de 
l’incidence des cancers et des métastases osseuses. Le fémur proximal est un des 
sites les plus fréquents de métastases osseuses. Une fracture pathologique dans 
cette localisation a un impact majeur sur la qualité de vie et potentiellement 
sur la survie du patient. Un traitement chirurgical prophylactique est ainsi 
recommandé en cas de risque de fracture imminente. La prise en charge des 
métastases fémorales proximales se décide en fonction de multiples paramètres, 
dont la survie théorique et le risque de fracture sont les plus importants. Si 
la survie est estimée à moins de 6 semaines, une chirurgie n’est en général pas 
indiquée. Au-delà, l’indication chirurgicale dépend essentiellement de la 
localisation des lésions et de la présence d’une fracture associée.

The global number of people over the age of 60 years is expected to increase 
from 970 million to 2.1 billion in 2050 and 3.1 billion in 2100. About 80% of 
the aging population will be in the developing countries. Aging population may 
suffer from various physical, cognitive, and social problems, due to aging 
process such as impairment of physical related functions (decreased mobility and 
walking speed, falls, frailty, decreased walking speed, difficulties in basic, 
and instrumental activities of daily living), cognitive related functions 
(memory-related issues), sensory functions (hearing loss, cataracts and 
refractive errors, presbyopia, decreased vestibular function), behavioural and 
psychological disorders, social isolation issues, and poor quality of life. Over 
the period of the last few decades, emerging technologies such as internet of 
things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), sensors, cloud computing, wireless 
communication technologies, and assistive robotics have given the vision to 
develop various ambient or active assisted living (AAL) approaches for 
supporting an elderly people to live safely and independently in their living 
environment and participate in their daily and community activities, as well as 
supporting them to maintain their physical, mental health, and quality of their 
life. The aim of this paper is to review the use of Ambient or Active Assisted 
Living for older adults with physical, cognitive impairments, and their social 
participation.

Attacks.

BACKGROUND: Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare C1-inhibitor (C1-INH) 
deficiency disease. Low levels of functional C1-INH can lead to recurrent 
attacks of severe swelling occurring in areas such as the limbs, face, 
gastrointestinal tract, and throat. These attacks are both painful and disabling 
and, if not treated promptly and effectively, can result in hospitalization or 
death. Agents targeting the specific physiologic pathway of HAE attacks can 
offer improved outcomes with limited side effects compared with nonspecific 
therapies. However, these treatments display varying efficacy in HAE patients, 
including the need to redose or seek additional care if the treatment does not 
resolve symptoms effectively.
OBJECTIVE: To analyze the expected cost and utility per HAE attack when treated 
on-demand with HAE therapies indicated for the treatment of acute attacks.
METHODS: A decision-tree model was developed using TreeAge Pro software. Four 
on-demand HAE treatments were included: ecallantide, icatibant, plasma-derived 
(pd)C1-INH, and recombinant human (rh)C1-INH. The model uses probabilities for 
redosing, self-administration versus health care provider administration, and 
risk of hospitalization. Costs within the model consisted of the HAE treatments 
and associated health care system expenses. Nonattack baseline utility and 
attack utility were implemented for effectiveness calculations; time to attack 
resolution was considered as well. Effectiveness and overall costs per attack 
were calculated and used to estimate cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). 
Variability and ranges in cost-effectiveness were determined using probabilistic 
sensitivity analyses. Finally, a budget impact model for a health plan with 1 
million covered lives was also developed.
RESULTS: The base case model outputs show costs and calculated effectiveness per 
attack at $12,905 and 0.806 for rhC1-INH, $14,806 and 0.765 for icatibant, 
$14,668 and 0.769 for pdC1-INH, and $21,068 and 0.792 for ecallantide, 
respectively. Cost per QALY was calculated using 26.9 attacks per person-year, 
leading to results of $420,941 for rhC1-INH, $488,349 for icatibant, $483,892 
for pdC1-INH, and $689,773 for ecallantide. Sensitivity analyses demonstrate 
that redose rates (from 3% for rhC1-INH to 44% for icatibant) are a primary 
driver of variability in cost-effectiveness. Annual health plan costs from the 
budget impact model are calculated as $6.94 million for rhC1-INH, $7.97 million 
for icatibant, $7.90 million for pdC1-INH, and $11.33 million for ecallantide.
CONCLUSIONS: Accounting for patient well-being and additional cost components of 
HAE attacks generates a better estimation of cost-effectiveness than drug cost 
alone. Results from this model indicate that rhC1-INH is the dominant treatment 
option with lower expected costs and higher calculated effectiveness than 
comparators. Further analyses reinforce the idea that low redose rates 
contribute to improved cost-effectiveness.

BACKGROUND: The effectiveness of breast cancer screening is still under debate. 
Our objective was to systematically review studies assessing personalized breast 
cancer screening strategies based on women's individual risk and to conduct a 
risk of bias assessment.
METHODS: We followed the standard methods of The Cochrane Collaboration and 
PRISMA declaration and searched the MEDLINE, EMBASE and Clinical Trials 
databases for studies published in English. The quality of the studies was 
assessed using the ISPOR-AMCP-NPC Questionnaire and The Cochrane Risk of Bias 
Tool. Two independent reviewers screened full texts and evaluated the risk of 
bias.
RESULTS: Out of the 1533 initially retrieved citations, we included 13 studies. 
Three studies were randomized controlled trials, while nine were mathematical 
modeling studies, and one was an observational pilot study. The trials are in 
the recruitment phase and have not yet reported their results. All three trials 
used breast density and age to define risk groups, and two of them included 
family history, previous biopsies, and genetic information. Among the 
mathematical modeling studies, the main risk factors used to define risk groups 
were breast density, age, family history, and previous biopsies. Six studies 
used genetic information to define risk groups. The most common outcome measures 
were the gain in quality-adjusted life years (QALY), absolute costs, and 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), while the main outcome in the 
observational study was the detection rate. In all models, personalized 
screening strategies were shown to be effective. The randomized trials were of 
good quality. The modeling studies showed moderate risk of bias but there was 
wide variability across studies. The observational study showed a low risk of 
bias but its utility was moderate due to its pilot design and its relatively 
small scale.
CONCLUSIONS: There is some evidence of the effectiveness of screening 
personalization in terms of QUALYs and ICER from the modeling studies and the 
observational study. However, evidence is lacking on feasibility and acceptance 
by the target population.

As oceans continue to warm under climate change, understanding the differential 
growth responses of corals is increasingly important. Scleractinian corals 
exhibit a broad range of life-history strategies, yet few studies have explored 
interspecific variation in long-term growth rates under a changing climate. Here 
we studied growth records of two coral species with different growth forms, 
namely branching Isopora palifera and massive Porites spp. at an offshore reef 
(Myrmidon Reef) of the central Great Barrier Reef (GBR), Australia. Skeletal 
growth chronologies were constructed using a combination of X-radiographs, gamma 
densitometry, and trace element (Sr/Ca) analysis. General additive mixed-effect 
models (GAMMs) revealed that skeletal density of I. palifera declined linearly 
and significantly at a rate of 1.2% yr-1 between 2002 and 2012. Calcification 
was stable between 2002 and 2009, yet declined significantly at a rate of 12% 
yr-1 between 2009 and 2012 following anomalously high sea surface temperatures 
(SST). Skeletal density of massive Porites exhibited a significant non-linear 
response over the 11-year study period (2002-2012) in that density was 
temporarily reduced during the 2009-2010 anomalously hot years, while linear 
extension and calcification showed no significant trends. Linear extension, 
density and calcification rates of I. palifera increased to maximum growth of 
26.7-26.9 °C, beyond which they declined. In contrast, calcification and linear 
extension of Porites exhibited no response to SST, but exhibited a significant 
linear decline in skeletal density with increasing SST. Our results reveal 
significant differences in coral growth patterns among coral growth forms, and 
highlight both the resistant nature of massive Porites and sensitivity of 
branching I. palifera. Future research should target a broad range of coral taxa 
within similar environments to provide a community-level response of ocean 
warming on coral reef communities.

Dysfunctions of androgen/TGF-β signaling play important roles in prostate 
tumorigenesis. Prostate Transmembrane Protein Androgen Induced 1 (PMEPA1) 
inhibits androgen and TGF-β signaling via a negative feedback loop. The loss of 
PMEPA1 confers resistance to androgen signaling inhibitors and promotes bone 
metastasis. Conflicting reports on the expression and biological functions of 
PMEPA1 in prostate and other cancers propelled us to investigate isoform 
specific functions in prostate cancer (PCa). One hundred and twenty laser 
capture micro-dissection matched normal prostate and prostate tumor tissues were 
analyzed for correlations between quantitative expression of PMEPA1 isoforms and 
clinical outcomes with Q-RT-PCR, and further validated with a The Cancer Genome 
Atlas (TCGA) RNA-Seq dataset of 499 PCa. Cell proliferation was assessed with 
cell counting, plating efficiency and soft agar assay in androgen responsive 
LNCaP and TGF-β responsive PC3 cells. TGF-β signaling was measured by SMAD 
dual-luciferase reporter assay. Higher PMEPA1-a mRNA levels indicated 
biochemical recurrence (p = 0.0183) and lower PMEPA1-b expression associated 
with metastasis (p = 0.0173). Further, lower PMEPA1-b and a higher ratio of 
PMEPA1-a vs. -b were correlated to higher Gleason scores and lower progression 
free survival rate (p < 0.01). TGF-β-responsive PMEPA1-a promoted PCa cell 
growth, and androgen-responsive PMEPA1-b inhibited cancer cell proliferation. 
PMEPA1 isoforms -a and -b were shown to be promising candidate biomarkers 
indicating PCa aggressiveness including earlier biochemical relapse and lower 
disease specific life expectancy via interrupting androgen/TGF-β signaling.

Resting Blood Pressure and Quality of Life in Young Adults? A Randomized 
Controlled Trial.

University Cologne, 50933 Köln, Germany.

The present study examined the effects of a functional high-intensity suspension 
training (FunctionalHIIT) on resting blood pressure, psychological well-being as 
well as on upper body and core strength and cardiorespiratory fitness in 
moderately trained participants. Twenty healthy, moderately trained adults (10 
males and 10 females; age: 36.2 ± 11.1 years, BMI: 23.9 ± 3.7) were randomly 
assigned to a FunctionalHIIT training group or passive control group (CON). 
FunctionalHIIT performed 16 sessions (2× week for eight weeks, 30 min per 
session), whereas CON maintained their habitual lifestyle using a physical 
activity log. Before and after FunctionalHIIT intervention, resting blood 
pressure and quality of life (short version of the WHO Quality of Life 
questionnaire (WHOQOL-BREF)) were assessed. Furthermore, maximum-repetition (leg 
press, chest press, pulldown, back extension) and trunk muscle strength (Bourban 
test) as well as cardiorespiratory fitness (Vameval test), were measured before 
and after the intervention. Both systolic and diastolic blood pressure and 
WHOQOL-BREF did not change significantly but both showed moderate 
training-induced effects (0.62 < standardized mean difference (SMD) < 0.82). 
Significant improvements in the FunctionalHIIT group were evident on leg press 
(p < 0.01), chest press (p < 0.05), and left side Bourban test (p < 0.05). 
Cardiorespiratory fitness did not reveal any time effects or time × group 
interactions. The present study revealed that eight weeks of FunctionalHIIT 
represents a potent stimulus to improve health-related parameters in young 
adults, whereas FunctionalHIIT was not sufficient to improve cardiorespiratory 
fitness.

The measurement of an airborne concentration in Amosite fibers above 5035 F/m3 
in a school prompted a retrospective quantitative health risk assessment. Dose 
estimates were built using air measurements, laboratory experiments, previous 
exposure data, and interviews. A dose response model was adapted for 
amosite-only exposure and adjusted for the life expectancy and lung cancer 
incidence in the Swiss population. The average yearly concentrations found were 
52-320 F/m3. The high concentration previously observed was not representative 
of the average exposure in the building. Overall, the risk estimates for the 
different populations of the school were low and in the range of 2 × 10-6 to 3 × 
10-5 for mesothelioma and 4 × 10-7 to 8 × 10-6 for lung cancer. The results 
evidenced however that children have to be considered at higher risk when 
exposed to asbestos, and that the current reference method and target values are 
of limited use for amphibole-only exposures. This study confirmed that 
quantitative health risk assessments and participatory approaches are powerful 
tools to support public decisions and build constructive communication between 
exposed people, experts, and policy-makers.

China.

BACKGROUND: Only a small number of patients have utilized the home-based 
end-of-life care service in Shanghai that has been offered since 2012. This 
study explores how home-based end-of-life care is delivered in community health 
service centers in Shanghai and examines the difficulties in the delivery of 
the care.
METHODS: This was a qualitative study in which data were collected from 
interviews and analyzed using qualitative content analysis. Nineteen health care 
providers with experience in delivering home-based end-of-life care in 12 
community health service centers were recruited. The interviews were conducted 
between August 2018 and February 2019.
RESULTS: Four themes emerged from the interviews: (i) Patients under home-based 
end-of-life care: Patients receiving the care were cancer patients with less 
than 1 year of life expectancy. The criteria for patients were broad. (ii) 
Service structure: The service was delivered regularly by the physicians and 
nurses using the approaches of home visits and/or telephone follow-ups. (iii) 
Service process: The service consisted of multiple components, including 
monitoring the patient's condition, managing the patient's symptoms, giving 
daily care instructions, performing nursing procedures, and giving psychological 
support. However, most of the care focused on monitoring the patients and 
managing their physical discomfort. (iv) Difficulties in delivering care: Being 
unable to provide the service and feeling powerless when facing psycho-spiritual 
problems were the two major difficulties. Three factors contributed to the 
suspension of the service: The gap between the service and the needs of the 
patients, a lack of patients, and low work motivation. The demand that the truth 
be concealed from the families and their attitude of avoiding talking about 
death were the key factors of the failure of psycho-spiritual care.
CONCLUSIONS: Several issues should be addressed before the service can be 
further developed, including fully understanding the needs and preferences of 
local patients and their families, securing more financial support and a better 
supply of drugs, delivering better training for staff, and ensuring greater 
rewards for individuals and institutions providing the service.

BACKGROUND: The spinal epidural space, covering the dural sac, is located along 
the posterior longitudinal ligament anteriorly, the ligamentum flavum and the 
periosteum of laminae posteriorly, and the pedicles of the spinal column by the 
intervertebral foramina containing their neural elements laterally. It could be 
affected variably by different types of diseases, either as primary lesions or 
as an extension from a disease process in the nearby tissues and organs.
AIM: We aimed to present clinically and surgically patients with spinal epidural 
masses operated in the Neurosurgery Department of Cairo University Hospitals, 
Cairo, Egypt, along a time interval of one year.
METHODS: In this prospective cohort study, we analysed motor deficits, sensory 
deficits, and bowel and bladder dysfunction. We have performed decompressive 
laminectomy on 19 patients with spinal epidural masses together with mass 
excision as long as the tumour was accessible, with or without fixation.
RESULTS: All patients were radiologically assessed by MRI over the affected side 
of the spine. D10 was the commonest site in our study to be affected in 10 cases 
of our participants (23%), followed by D5, D7, and D12 each of them was affected 
in 6 cases (14%), in another word spinal segments by order of frequency to be 
affected were dorsal followed by lumbar spine. All patients included in this 
study (100%) showed an obvious improvement as regard pain and tenderness.
CONCLUSION: Surgical interventions have improved the quality of life for our 
patients with spinal epidural masses.

Crimson snapper is an important marine economy fish, and its scales are rich in 
collagen. Crimson snapper scale peptides (CSSPs) obtained from crimson snapper 
scales by enzymatic hydrolysis exhibited significantly antioxidant activities to 
DPPH, ABTS and hydroxyl radicals in vitro. In vivo antioxidant and anti-aging 
effects of CSSPs on the Drosophila melanogaster aging model constructed by lard 
were investigated in this study. The results showed that CSSPs could prolong the 
mean lifespan, 50% survival days and the maximum lifespan of Drosophila, and 
especially when the concentration of CSSPs was increased to 6 mg mL-1, the mean 
lifespan of male and female Drosophila increased by 21.2% and 26.2%, 
respectively, indicating the effective life extension effect of CSSPs. 
Meanwhile, the addition of CSSPs effectively reduced the contents of 
malondialdehyde (MDA) and protein carbonylation (PCO) and increased the levels 
of total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD) and catalase (CAT) in Drosophila, which 
showed a significant dose dependence. Besides, the antioxidant-related genes 
SOD1, SOD2 and CAT were up-regulated in Drosophila when fed with diets 
containing CSSPs. In conclusion, CSSPs played an antioxidant and anti-aging role 
by reducing the accumulation of peroxide products and improving the activity of 
antioxidant enzymes, as well as by up-regulating the expression of 
antioxidant-related genes. The results suggest that CSSPs have potential to be 
used in the food and healthcare industries as potential food-borne antioxidant 
and anti-aging agents.

BACKGROUND: Recently, United States life expectancy has stagnated or declined 
for the poor and working class and risen for the middle and upper classes. 
Declining labor-union density-the percent of workers who are unionized-has 
precipitated burgeoning income inequity. We examined whether it has also 
exacerbated racial and educational mortality inequities.
METHODS: From CDC, we obtained state-level all-cause and overdose/suicide 
mortality overall and by gender, gender-race, and gender-education from 
1986-2016. State-level union density and demographic and economic confounders 
came from the Current Population Survey. State-level policy confounders included 
the minimum wage, the generosity of Aid to Families with Dependent Children 
or Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, and the generosity of 
unemployment insurance. To model the exposure-outcome relationship, we used 
marginal structural modeling. Using state-level 
inverse-probability-of-treatment-weighted Poisson models with state and year 
fixed effects, we estimated 3-year moving average union density's effects on the 
following year's mortality rates. Then, we tested for gender, gender-race, and 
gender-education effect-modification. Finally, we estimated how racial and 
educational all-cause mortality inequities would change if union density 
increased to 1985 or 1988 levels, respectively.
RESULTS: Overall, a 10% increase in union density was associated with a 17% 
relative decrease in overdose/suicide mortality (95% confidence interval [CI]: 
0.70, 0.98), or 5.7 lives saved per 100 000 person-years (95% CI: -10.7, -0.7). 
Union density's absolute (lives-saved) effects on overdose/suicide mortality 
were stronger for men than women, but its relative effects were similar across 
genders. Union density had little effect on all-cause mortality overall or 
across subgroups, and modeling suggested union-density increases would not 
affect mortality inequities.
CONCLUSIONS: Declining union density (as operationalized in this study) may not 
explain all-cause mortality inequities, although increases in union density may 
reduce overdose/suicide mortality.

OBJECTIVES: Advanced nasal malignancies may require rhinectomy, which can have 
profound psychosocial impacts. Rhinectomy defects can be rehabilitated through 
surgery or prosthetics. We seek to understand the health utility of the 
rhinectomy defect, surgical, and prosthetic reconstruction, which have not been 
previously studied.
STUDY DESIGN: Prospective clinical study METHODS: Adult naïve observers (n = 
273) ranked the utility of five randomized health states (monocular blindness, 
binocular blindness, post-rhinectomy nasal defect, postsurgical reconstruction, 
and post-prosthetic rehabilitation). Health utilities were measured using visual 
analogue scale (VAS), standard gamble (SG), and time trade-off (TTO). One-way 
analysis of variance (ANOVA) with post hoc Scheffe's test and the independent 
samples T-test for a priori comparisons were performed. Multiple linear 
regression was performed using participant demographics as independent 
predictors of utility scores.
RESULTS: Health utilities (VAS, SG, TTO) were reported as follows (mean ± SD): 
monocular blindness (0.71 ± 0.21, 0.84 ± 0.20, 0.85 ± 0.19), binocular blindness 
(0.48 ± 0.25, 0.68 ± 0.28, 0.63 ± 0.28), post-rhinectomy nasal defect 
(0.59 ± 0.24, 0.74 ± 0.24, 0.74 ± 0.24), postsurgical reconstruction 
(0.88 ± 0.16, 0.90 ± 0.18, 0.89 ± 0.13), and post-prosthetic rehabilitation 
(0.67 ± 0.22, 0.80 ± 0.23, 0.82 ± 0.20). Both surgical reconstruction (P < .001) 
and prosthetic rehabilitation (P < .001) significantly improved health utility. 
SG and TTO utility scores were inversely associated with observer age (P < .001) 
and participants who identified themselves as non-Caucasians (P < .05) in 
post-rhinectomy nasal defect, post-nasal surgical reconstruction, and post-nasal 
prosthetic rehabilitation health states, while higher levels of education were 
directly associated with SG scores (P < .05), respectively.
CONCLUSION: This is the first study to demonstrate the significant negative 
impact of the rhinectomy nasal defect on health utility. Rehabilitation by 
surgical or prosthetic techniques significantly increases health utility as 
rated by naïve observers. Laryngoscope, 130:1674-1679, 2020.

Social determinants of health in relation to firearm-related homicides in the 
United States: A nationwide multilevel cross-sectional study.

University, Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America.

BACKGROUND: Gun violence has shortened the average life expectancy of Americans, 
and better knowledge about the root causes of gun violence is crucial to its 
prevention. While some empirical evidence exists regarding the impacts of social 
and economic factors on violence and firearm homicide rates, to the author's 
knowledge, there has yet to be a comprehensive and comparative lagged, 
multilevel investigation of major social determinants of health in relation to 
firearm homicides and mass shootings.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: This study used negative binomial regression models and 
geolocated gun homicide incident data from January 1, 2015, to December 31, 
2015, to explore and compare the independent associations of key state-, 
county-, and neighborhood-level social determinants of health-social mobility, 
social capital, income inequality, racial and economic segregation, and social 
spending-with neighborhood firearm-related homicides and mass shootings in the 
United States, accounting for relevant state firearm laws and a variety of 
state, county, and neighborhood (census tract [CT]) characteristics. Latitude 
and longitude coordinates on firearm-related deaths were previously collected by 
the Gun Violence Archive, and then linked by the British newspaper The Guardian 
to CTs according to 2010 Census geographies. The study population consisted of 
all 74,134 CTs as defined for the 2010 Census in the 48 states of the contiguous 
US. The final sample spanned 70,579 CTs, containing an estimated 314,247,908 
individuals, or 98% of the total US population in 2015. The analyses were based 
on 13,060 firearm-related deaths in 2015, with 11,244 non-mass shootings taking 
place in 8,673 CTs and 141 mass shootings occurring in 138 CTs. For area-level 
social determinants, lag periods of 3 to 17 years were examined based on 
existing theory, empirical evidence, and data availability. County-level 
institutional social capital (levels of trust in institutions), social mobility, 
income inequality, and public welfare spending exhibited robust relationships 
with CT-level gun homicide rates and the total numbers of combined non-mass and 
mass shooting homicide incidents and non-mass shooting homicide incidents alone. 
A 1-standard deviation (SD) increase in institutional social capital was linked 
to a 19% reduction in the homicide rate (incidence rate ratio [IRR] = 0.81, 95% 
CI 0.73-0.91, p < 0.001) and a 17% decrease in the number of firearm homicide 
incidents (IRR = 0.83, 95% CI 0.73-0.95, p = 0.01). Upward social mobility was 
related to a 25% reduction in the gun homicide rate (IRR = 0.75, 95% CI 
0.66-0.86, p < 0.001) and a 24% decrease in the number of homicide incidents 
(IRR = 0.76, 95% CI 0.67-0.87, p < 0.001). Meanwhile, 1-SD increases in the 
neighborhood percentages of residents in poverty and males living alone were 
associated with 26%-27% and 12% higher homicide rates, respectively. Study 
limitations include possible residual confounding by factors at the 
individual/household level, and lack of disaggregation of gun homicide data by 
gender and race/ethnicity.
CONCLUSIONS: This study finds that the rich-poor gap, level of citizens' trust 
in institutions, economic opportunity, and public welfare spending are all 
related to firearm homicide rates in the US. Further establishing the causal 
nature of these associations and modifying these social determinants may help to 
address the growing gun violence epidemic and reverse recent life expectancy 
declines among Americans.

The problem of an aging society is becoming increasingly acute. Diseases related 
to aging also come with it. There are some diseases that people can't treat 
fundamentally. Therefore, people try to find a natural ingredient from natural 
medicine to treat these diseases and improve the quality of life of the elderly. 
With the screening of a large number of traditional Chinese medicines, we found 
that polysaccharides from Rehmannia glutinous (PRG) can prolong the lifespan of 
Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans). Neutral polysaccharide is the main 
component of PRG. In the present study, we used a C. elegans model to illustrate 
the stress resistance and lifespan extension effect and mechanism of two kinds 
of neutral polysaccharide fractions from Rehmannia glutinosa (NPRG), 
respectively called NPRRP and NPRR. Our data showed that two kinds of neutral 
polysaccharides fractions could extend the lifespan and delay senescence of 
wild-type worms. Moreover, the mechanism study revealed that NPRG was able to 
promote the nuclear localization of DAF-16 resulting in the activation of 
antioxidant enzymatic systems under oxidative stress. We also observed that NPRG 
didn't increase the lifespan of mutants with daf-16 portion loss of function, 
suggesting NPRG prolonging the lifespan partially required the daf-16 gene on 
the insulin/IGF-1 signaling pathway (IIS). NPRG was found to have no effect on 
Escherichia coli OP50 (E.coli OP50) growth and pharyngeal pump movement of 
nematodes, indicating that the anti‑aging effect of NPRG is not realized by the 
caloric restriction. However, mRNA levels of daf-2 were remarkably decreased 
after NPRG treatment. Thus daf-2 lost its inhibitory effect on the expression of 
daf-16 and had a continuous stimulation effect on the IIS, then prolonged the 
life of nematodes. Overall, our results illustrated the potential utilization of 
NPRG as a functional pharmaceutical ingredient to increase stress resistance and 
extend the life of C. elegans via the IIS, which could be developed as a natural 
supplement agent.

Background: The first successful bilateral pediatric hand transplant was 
performed in 2015. Previous hand transplant decision analysis models have 
focused on the adult population. This model principally aimed to determine 
whether adverse outcomes associated with immunosuppression outweigh the benefits 
of performing bilateral hand transplant surgery in a pediatric candidate. The 
model also conceptualized the valuation of losing years of life and sought to 
determine the impact of that valuation on the surgical decision. Methods: A 
decision model compared undergoing bilateral hand transplant surgery with using 
prosthetics for an 8-year-old patient. The outcome measure used was quality 
adjusted life years (QALYs), and sensitivity analysis was performed on the 
immunosuppressive risks associated with the surgical decision, as well as the 
perceived valuation of aversion to life years lost. Results: The decision to 
perform surgery was marginally optimal compared to the prosthetic decision 
(50.11 QALY vs. 47.95 QALY). A Monte Carlo simulation revealed that this 
difference may be too marginal to detect an optimal decision (50.14 ± 8.28 QALY 
vs. 47.95 ± 2.12 QALY). Sensitivity analysis identified decision thresholds 
related to immunosuppression risks (P = 29% vs. P = 33% modeled), and a trend of 
increasing risk as a patient is more averse to losing life years. Conclusions: 
The marginally optimal treatment strategy currently is bilateral hand 
transplant, compared to prosthetics for pediatric patients. Key determinants of 
the future optimal strategy will be whether immunosuppressive regimens become 
safer, with a reduced risk of losing life years due to immunosuppressive 
complications, and whether prosthetics become more acceptable and enable higher 
functioning.

BACKGROUND: Physicians who receive a request for euthanasia or assisted suicide 
may experience a conflict of duties: the duty to preserve life on the one hand 
and the duty to relieve suffering on the other hand. Little is known about 
experiences of physicians with receiving and granting a request for euthanasia 
or assisted suicide. This study, therefore, aimed to explore the concerns, 
feelings and pressure experienced by physicians who receive requests for 
euthanasia or assisted suicide.
METHODS: In 2016, a cross-sectional study was conducted. Questionnaires were 
sent to a random sample of 3000 Dutch physicians. Physicians who had been 
working in adult patient care in the Netherlands for the last year were included 
in the sample (n = 2657). Half of the physicians were asked about the most 
recent case in which they refused a request for euthanasia or assisted suicide, 
and half about the most recent case in which they granted a request for 
euthanasia or assisted suicide.
RESULTS: Of the 2657 eligible physicians, 1374 (52%) responded. The most 
reported reason not to participate was lack of time. Of the respondents, 248 
answered questions about a refused euthanasia or assisted suicide request and 
245 about a granted EAS request. Concerns about specific aspects of the 
euthanasia and assisted suicide process, such as the emotional burden of 
preparing and performing euthanasia or assisted suicide were commonly reported 
by physicians who refused and who granted a request. Pressure to grant a request 
was mostly experienced by physicians who refused a request, especially if the 
patient was ≥80 years, had a life-expectancy of ≥6 months and did not have 
cancer. The large majority of physicians reported contradictory emotions after 
having performed euthanasia or assisted suicide.
CONCLUSIONS: Society should be aware of the impact of euthanasia and assisted 
suicide requests on physicians. The tension physicians experience may decrease 
their willingness to perform euthanasia and assisted suicide. On the other hand, 
physicians should not be forced to cross their own moral boundaries or be 
tempted to perform euthanasia and assisted suicide in cases that may not meet 
the due care criteria.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of the seven-step two-lobe 
holmium laser enucleation of the prostate (HoLEP) technique with low power laser 
device, and to introduce the detailed operating procedures, key points, 
short-term outcomes of this modified HoLEP technique.
METHODS: From March 2016 to November 2017, 90 patients underwent HoLEP in Peking 
University Third Hospital. The patients were divided into two groups: high-power 
group (32 patients) were performed with traditional Gilling's three-lobe 
enucleation using high power (90 W) laser; Low-power group (58 patients) were 
performed with seven-step two-lobe enucleation using low power (40 W) laser. The 
main steps of the low power seven-step two-lobe HoLEP phase included: (1) The 
identification of the correct plane between adenoma and capsule at 5 and 7 
o'clock laterally to the veru montanum; (2) The connection of the bilateral 
plane by making a adenoma incision at the proximal point of veru montanum; (3) 
The extension of the dorsal plane under the whole three lobes between adenoma 
and capsule towards the bladder neck; (4) The separation of the middle lobe from 
two lateral lobes by making two retrograde incisions separately from apex 5 and 
7 o'clock towards the bladder neck; (5) The enucleation of the middle lobe 
adenoma by extending the dorsal plane through into the bladder; (6) The 
prevention of the apex mucosa by making a circle incision at the apex of the 
prostate; (7) The en-bloc enucleation of the two lateral lobe adenomas by 
extending the lateral and ventral plane between adenoma and capsule from 5 and 7 
o'clock to 12 o'clock conjunction and through into the bladder.
RESULTS: The mean patient age was (66.25±5.37) years vs. (68.00±5.18) years; The 
mean body mass indexes were (24.13±4.06) kg/m2 vs. (24.57±3.50) kg/m2; The mean 
prostate specific antigen values were (3.23±2.47) μg/L vs. (6.00±6.09) μg/L; The 
average prostatic volumes evaluated by ultrasound was (49.03±20.63) mL vs. 
(67.55±36.97) mL. There was no significant difference between the two groups. 
Furthermore, there were no significant differences in terms of perioperative and 
follow up data, including operative time; enucleation efficiencies; hemoglobin 
decrease; blood sodium and potassiumthe change postoperatively; catheterization 
duration and hospital stay; the international prostate symptom scores and 
quality of life scores pre- and post-operatively. There was 1 transurethral 
resection of the prostate (TURP) conversion in high-power group and 1 
transfusion in low-power group during the operations. The follow-up one month 
after operation showed no severe stress incontinence in both the groups, whereas 
3 cases ejaculatory dysfunctions in high-power group versus 1 case in low-power 
group were observed; Other surgeryrelated complications included: 2 cases 
postoperative hemorrhage (Clavien II and Clavien IIIb) in high-power group, 2 
cases postoperative temperature more than 38 °C (Clavien I) and 1 case dysuria 
following catheter removal (Clavien I) in low-power group.
CONCLUSION: Low power laser device can be applied safe and effectively for HoLEP 
procedure using the seven-step two-lobe HoLEP technique. The outcomes comparable 
with high power laser HoLEP can be achieved.

目的: 探讨采用低功率钬激光“七步两叶法”行前列腺剜除术的可行性,介绍“七步两叶法”的具体步骤及近期疗效。
方法: 
回顾2016年3月至2017年11月间90例于北京大学第三医院接受经尿道钬激光前列腺剜除术的患者资料,按手术使用钬激光设备不同分为两组,高功率组32例,手术使用高功率钬激光,功率设置为90 
W;低功率组58例,手术使用低功率钬激光,功率设置为40 
W。手术方法前者采用“三叶法”,即先在5、7点纵行切开腺体至包膜,然后完整剥离中叶,再在12点纵行切开至包膜,先后剥离左右叶,最后离断尖部连接腺体的黏膜,使左右叶腺体完全游离;后者则采用“七步两叶法”,其具体步骤包括:(1)在精阜两侧5、7点找到正确的包膜平面;(2)于精阜近端横行切开使两侧包膜平面相连;(3)向膀胱颈方向扇形剥离腺体与背侧包膜;(4)于尖部5、7点逆行向膀胱颈部分割中叶与左、右叶;(5)完全剥离中叶;(6)于前列腺尖部环行切断尿路黏膜;(7)分别从尖部两侧向腹侧及膀胱颈方向剥离左、右叶并最终于12点汇合使两侧叶完整剥离。
结果: 高功率组与低功率组患者的平均年龄分别为(66.25±5.37)岁和(68.00±5.18)岁;体重指数平均值分别为(24.13±4.06) kg/m 
2和(24.57±3.50) kg/m 2;前列腺特异性抗原平均值分别为(3.23±2.47) μg/L和(6.00±6.09) 
μg/L;B超测量前列腺体积平均值分别为(49.03±20.63) mL和(67.55±36.97) 
mL,组间差异均无统计学意义。两组患者的围手术期数据及随访数据,包括手术时间、剜除效率、术后血红蛋白下降程度、术后血钠、血钾变化程度、尿管留置时间、术后住院天数、术前、术后国际前列腺症状评分及生活质量评分等组间差异均无统计学意义。高功率组1例术中中转经尿道前列腺电切术;低功率组1例术中输血。术后1个月随访显示:两组均无明显尿失禁,射精功能障碍高功率组3例,低功率组1例。其他手术相关并发症包括高功率组2例术后活动性出血 
(Clavien Ⅱ 及 Clavien Ⅲb);低功率组2例术后发热超过38 ℃ (Clavien Ⅰ), 1例拔尿管后排尿困难 (Clavien Ⅰ)。
结论: 采用低功率钬激光及“七步两叶法”可安全开展钬激光前列腺剜除术,并取得与高功率钬激光前列腺剜除术相似的疗效。

PURPOSE: Patients with relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) are 
living longer due in part to changing treatment patterns. It is important to 
understand how changing treatment patterns affect patients' lives beyond 
extending survival. Research suggests that direct patient report is the best way 
to capture information on how patients feel and function in response to their 
disease and its treatment. Therefore, the purpose of this review is to summarize 
evidence of patients' experience collected through patient-reported outcomes 
(PRO) in RRMM patients, and to explore PRO reporting quality.
METHODS: We conducted a systematic search to identify manuscripts reporting PROs 
in RRMM and summarized available evidence. We assessed PRO reporting quality 
using the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) PRO Extension 
checklist.
