cost-effectiveness ratios of US$ 1,400 to US$ 6,000 per DQALY (discounted 
quality-adjusted life-year) for patients with genotype 1. In genotype 1, 48 
weeks compared to 24 weeks of combination therapy prolonged quality adjusted 
life expectancy by 0.6 years at a marginal cost-effectiveness ratio of $US 9,800 
per DQALY. For patients with genotype non-1, combination therapy for 24 or 48 
weeks, compared to interferon alone, prolonged quality adjusted life expectancy 
by 2.3 years, with combination therapy for 24 weeks being money-saving. The 
results were robust in sensitivity analyses.
CONCLUSION: Combination therapy with interferon and ribavirin increased 
quality-adjusted life expectancy and was cost-effective for patients with 
chronic hepatitis C.

The progress of science and technology at the end of the XIXth and first half of 
the XXth century paved the way to start space exploration by humanity. The 
flight of Yu. A. Gagarin on April 12, 1961 was one of the history watersheds 
that had a great many of social implications. Piloted missions to space 
demonstrated the possibility for humans to adapt to the spaceflight factors 
which, nonetheless, can provoke various unfavorable reactions, particularly on 
return to Earth. Step-by-step extension of mission length paralleled enhancement 
of the methods of monitoring of crew health, life support systems, and 
development of modalities to maintain crew health and performance. The paper 
contains brief discussion of data acquired in short- and long-term missions 
including the 438-d mission of cosmonaut-physician V.V. Polyakov. The final 
section is devoted to the mainstream problems of future piloted space programs.

Health insurance in the Philippines: bold policies and socio-economic realities.

Hindle D(1), Acuin L, Valera M.

South Wales.

In 1995, the Philippines government legislated to create an income-rated and 
predominantly employment-based universal health insurance program over a 15-year 
period. The program was intended to provide more and better health care than was 
available through a combination of existing insurance schemes that covered less 
than half of the population, and partially subsidized services provided by 
government facilities and funded from general taxation. The legislation was well 
intentioned, and the program has some skillful and imaginative staff. However, 
there are significant barriers to success including low average and widely 
dispersed incomes, improving but still unsatisfactory health status, weak 
government health care services, and the sometimes negative impact of for-profit 
agencies. We review progress to date and conclude that, although membership 
numbers and benefit rates have increased, access is still inadequate and 
copayments are high. We argue that strong and innovative steps are needed if the 
Program's goals are to be realised. In particular, we suggest that the focus 
should be on more formal and explicit rationing that takes account of cost per 
quality-adjusted life-year; and radical adjustment of financial incentives for 
care providers including capitation and per case payment based on costed 
clinical pathways for high-volume case types. Finally, we comment briefly on 
lessons that might be learned by both The Philippines and Australia.

Over the last years the reality surrounding HIV-infection has undergone a 
considerable change with regard to the life expectancy of patients, and the 
plans they can make for their lives. Because the majority of the HIV positive 
population is of reproductive age, one of these plans might be to have children, 
often as an expression of a fulfilled partnership. The need for medical support 
to realize this wish, however, is often confronted with ethical, medical or 
forensic restraints. For this reason, interdisciplinary recommendations have now 
been developed--for the first time on a global basis--which aim to provide 
guidelines for practitioners in this complicated area.

Bergen, Norway. hkfl@haukeland.no

OBJECTIVES: To study the long-term (12 year) survival and quality of life (QOL) 
in former ICU patients.
SETTING: Two hundred and thirty-six ICU admissions from a total of 219 patients 
treated in a Norwegian University Hospital in 1987.
DESIGN AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis of the ICU stays and a prospective 
observation of survival using available information from the Norwegian Peoples 
Registry. QOL was studied in survivors in 2000 using the Short Form-36 (SF-36) 
questionnaire. Survival was compared with available statistics for the general 
Norwegian population (gender- and age-matched), and QOL was compared with 
published data from a Norwegian reference population.
INTERVENTIONS: None.
RESULTS: A total of 106 (48.4 %) patients survived the first 12 years after ICU. 
Of the non-survivors (113) 66.4 % died within the first year. Two years after 
discharge the further survival of former ICU patients was 0.763 compared to 
0.826 in the general population (difference 0.063 with 95 % CI from -0.007 to 
0.134). QOL was significantly less than in the reference population in six of 
the eight scales of SF-36 (average 82.5%).
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that the long-term outcome after ICU is good, 
with an acceptable QOL and a life expectancy comparable with the general 
population in survivors 2 years after the ICU stay.

Low-molecular-weight heparin versus warfarin for secondary prophylaxis of venous 
thromboembolism: a cost-effectiveness analysis.

PURPOSE: To compare the cost effectiveness of low-molecular-weight heparin with 
that of oral anticoagulants in preventing recurrences after an episode of venous 
thromboembolism.
METHODS: A decision tree was used to assess the cost and the expected 
quality-adjusted years of life (QALY) after treatment with either 
low-molecular-weight heparin or warfarin, based on pooled data from six 
published trials. Preferences were elicited with a modified time trade-off 
method in a sample of patients attending an anticoagulation clinic.
RESULTS: Compared with warfarin, low-molecular-weight heparin significantly 
decreased the rate of minor bleeding (odds ratio [OR] = 0.24; 95% confidence 
interval [CI]: 0.14 to 0.43) but not recurrent deep vein thromboses (OR = 0.77; 
95% CI: 0.43 to 1.35). Patients' preference for warfarin (0.988, on a 0 to 1 
scale) was lower than that for low-molecular-weight heparin (0.992), but the 
difference was not statistically significant. A Monte Carlo analysis estimated 
that low-molecular-weight heparin saved an average of 13 quality-adjusted days 
compared with warfarin, at a cost of $6,583 per QALY (95% CI: $5,525 to $7,625) 
based on costs in Italy and $28,231 per QALY (95% CI: $20,872 to $36,773) based 
on costs in the United States. When we included rebound recurrences after 
interruption of therapy, which were more common with low-molecular-weight 
heparin, treatment with low-molecular-weight heparin cost $53,166 per QALY in 
Italy and $177,166 per QALY in the United States.
CONCLUSIONS: Low-molecular-weight heparin might be a cost-effective drug for 
secondary prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism, especially in patients at high 
risk of recurrence and where the drug's cost is lower. The apparent increase in 
recurrence after interruption of therapy needs to be investigated more 
thoroughly before low-molecular-weight heparin can be recommended routinely.

Cost effectiveness of human papillomavirus testing to augment cervical cancer 
screening in women infected with the human immunodeficiency virus.

PURPOSE: To determine the cost effectiveness of incorporating molecular testing 
for high-risk types of human papillomavirus into a cervical cancer screening 
program for women infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We developed a Markov model to simulate the natural 
history of cervical cancer precursor lesions in HIV-infected women. 
Probabilities of progression and regression of cervical lesions were conditional 
on transient or persistent infection with human papillomavirus, as well as stage 
of HIV and effectiveness of antiretroviral therapy. Incorporating data from 
prospective cohort studies, national databases, and published literature, the 
model was used to calculate quality-adjusted life expectancy, life expectancy, 
lifetime costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for two main 
strategies: targeted screening-human papillomavirus testing is added to the 
initial two cervical cytology smears obtained after an HIV diagnosis and 
subsequent screening intervals are modified based on the test results; and 
universal screening-no testing for human papillomavirus is performed, and a 
single cytology screening interval is applied to all women.
RESULTS: In HIV-infected women on anti-retroviral therapy, a targeted screening 
strategy in which cervical cytology screening was conducted every 6 months for 
women with detected human papillomavirus DNA, and annually for all others, cost 
$10,000 to $14,000 per quality-adjusted life year gained compared with no 
screening. A universal screening strategy consisting of annual cervical cytology 
for all women was 15% less effective and had a less attractive 
cost-effectiveness ratio. Targeted screening remained economically attractive in 
multiple sensitivity analyses, although when the overall incidence of cervical 
cancer precursor lesions was lowered by 75%, the screening interval for women 
with detected human papillomavirus DNA could be widened to 1 year.
CONCLUSIONS: Adding human papillomavirus testing to the two cervical cytology 
smears obtained in the year after an HIV diagnosis, and modifying subsequent 
cytology screening intervals based on the results, appears to be an effective 
and cost-effective modification to current recommendations for annual cytology 
screening in HIV-infected women.

Polychemotherapy for early breast cancer: an overview of the randomised clinical 
trials with quality-adjusted survival analysis.

BACKGROUND: Overview analysis involving 18000 women with breast cancer in 47 
randomised trials showed that prolonged chemotherapy significantly reduces the 
risk of relapse and death compared with no chemotherapy. Here we express the 
size of the benefit in terms of quality-adjusted survival time gained.
METHODS: We used the Q-TWiST method (Quality-adjusted Time Without Symptoms of 
disease and Toxicity of treatment) to provide treatment comparisons within 10 
years' follow-up, incorporating differences in quality of life associated with 
times patients spend with chemotherapy toxic effects, after relapse, and without 
symptoms of relapse or toxicity.
FINDINGS: Within 10 years' follow-up the benefit of increased relapse-free and 
overall survival for younger women (<50 years old) who received polychemotherapy 
balanced the burdens in terms of acute toxic side-effects, especially among 
women enrolled in trials that did not include tamoxifen. Overall, 
chemotherapy-treated younger women gained an average of 10.3 months of 
relapse-free survival and 5.4 months of overall survival within 10 years 
(p<0.0001 for both) compared with the no-chemotherapy group. Polychemotherapy 
provided more quality-adjusted time than control across nearly all values of 
utility weights for time spent undergoing chemotherapy and time after relapse. 
The range of benefit was from -0.6 to 10.3 months. For older women (50-69 years) 
overall, polychemotherapy also provided significant benefit compared with no 
chemotherapy but, compared with younger women, the size of benefit was less and 
the range of utility-weight values favouring polychemotherapy was smaller. 
Average gains for older women treated with polychemotherapy (with or without 
tamoxifen) were 6.8 months of relapse-free survival (p<0.0001) and 2.9 months of 
overall survival (p=0.0001) within 10 years. The range of quality-adjusted 
benefit was -3.1 to 6.8 months. For older women with oestrogen-receptor-poor 
tumours who did not receive tamoxifen (9% of the total), the benefit of 
polychemotherapy was significant and similar to that observed for younger women.
INTERPRETATION: The benefits of adjuvant chemotherapy within 10 years outweigh 
the burdens especially for younger women (<50 years old) and among older women 
(50-69 years) to a lesser degree. Additional studies to compare the 
quality-adjusted survival of chemotherapy plus endocrine therapy versus 
endocrine therapy alone are required for younger patients with tumours that 
express steroid-hormone receptors.

OBJECTIVE: To improve the evidence base for health policy by devising a method 
to measure and monitor the performance of health systems.
DESIGN: Estimation of the relation between levels of population health and the 
inputs used to produce health.
SETTING: 191 countries.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Health system efficiency (performance).
RESULTS: Estimated efficiency varied from nearly fully efficient to nearly fully 
inefficient. Countries with a history of civil conflict or high prevalence of 
HIV and AIDS were less efficient. Performance increased with health expenditure 
per capita.
CONCLUSIONS: Increasing the resources for health systems is critical to 
improving health in poor countries, but important gains can be made in most 
countries by using existing resources more efficiently.

Cystic fibrosis.

Although mutation detection rates have not universally reached the 95% detection 
level recommended by the American Society of Human Genetics and are not likely 
to exceed 90% for many populations in the foreseeable future, CF carrier 
screening will probably be offered routinely in the near future. Although CF 
carrier information will be of benefit to some individuals and couples, the 
inability of conventional prenatal diagnosis to provide definitive diagnostic 
outcomes to some couples, specifically those couples in which only one partner 
has a detectable mutation, will make for considerable anguish and concern for 
some. Because genetic screening and counseling is meant to provide information 
and alleviate concerns and fears, the potential for CF screening to result in 
such a contradictory effect is of a continuing concern to those who provide 
obstetric and genetic services. In a National Institute of Health-sponsored 
workshop, Menutti and colleagues recommended that those populations to which 
carrier screening should be offered might include individuals and couples in 
high-risk groups (e.g., Ashkenazi Jews, central or northern Europeans, one 
partner with CF, and individuals with a family history of CF) who seek 
preconception counseling, infertility care, or prenatal care. The workshop 
participants concluded, however, that before screening can be offered 
systematically to these individuals or couples, practice guidelines, educational 
materials for providers and patients, informed-consent protocols, and laboratory 
standards for testing must be developed. Further advances in DNA and protein 
analytic capabilities, such as microchip analytic systems and protein truncation 
assays, may make CF screening and diagnosis more accurate and less likely to 
result in equivocal outcomes. In addition, it is hoped that continuing 
improvements in CF therapies will increase the life expectancy and improve the 
quality of life for individuals affected with CF. Expanding our current 
knowledge of genotype-phenotype correlations will not only allow us better to 
predict clinical outcomes but also may improve our treatments for individuals 
with CF because more targeted therapies may be developed for CF caused by 
specific mutations. Nonetheless, educational and counseling issues will, for the 
foreseeable future, remain of critical importance to ensure appropriate clinical 
care to low- and high-risk individuals.

Methylphenidate in children with hyperactivity: review and cost-utility 
analysis.

anna.gilmore@lshtm.ac.uk

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of 
methylphenidate in the treatment of children with hyperkinetic disorder as 
defined using ICD-10 criteria.
DESIGN: Comprehensive literature review and cost utility analysis comparing 
methylphenidate treatment with placebo. Costs and effects were estimated from a 
NHS perspective according to the methodology developed by the previous South and 
West Development and Evaluation Committee. The number of Quality Adjusted Life 
Years (QALYs) gained was estimated by using the Index of Health Related Quality 
of Life to model treatment effects.
RESULTS: Evidence from good and medium quality randomized controlled trials 
shows benefits of methylphenidate over weeks and months respectively. Evidence 
beyond 6 months is poorer and it is uncertain whether effects of methylphenidate 
persist into adolescence and adulthood. Methylphenidate is of reasonable 
cost-effectiveness when considering short- and medium- term benefits with an 
estimated cost per QALY of 7 pounds 400 to 9 pounds 200 at 1997 prices.
CONCLUSIONS: Short-term treatment of hyperkinetic children with methylphenidate 
is effective and cost effective.

The number of umbilical cord blood transplants (UCBT) is increasing worldwide, 
and the purpose of Eurocord is to evaluate the results and compare the outcome 
of UCBT with allogeneic bone marrow transplants (BMT). Data have been reported 
to Eurocord by many transplant centers. Close links have been established with 
cord blood banks through Netcord. BMT data have been provided by transplant 
centers and also by the European Blood and Marrow Transplant (EBMT) and 
International Bone Marrow Transplant Registries (IBMTR). Eurocord has analyzed 
the outcome of unrelated UCBT from 121 transplant centers and 29 countries. The 
results have shown that survival with unrelated mismatched UCBT was comparable 
to that with unrelated BMT. Engraftment with cord blood was delayed, resulting 
in an increased incidence of early transplant complications. The incidence of 
acute and chronic graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) was reduced with cord blood 
grafts even in HLA mismatched transplants and in adults. In patients with 
leukemia, the rate of relapse was similar to that after BMT. The overall 
event-free survival with UCBT was not statistically different when compared to 
BMT. In conclusion, this large registry study confirms the potential benefit of 
using umbilical cord blood hematopoietic stem cells for allogeneic transplants.

Tsukuba, Tennodai, Tsukuba, 305--8575 Japan.

The knee is probably the most frequent site for MR imaging of the extremities in 
most institutions, and it has significantly changed the practice of knee 
surgery, including arthroscopy. The following commentary by a radiologist 
discusses the growing number of MR units, which facilitates increases in the 
number of MR examinations of the knee in Japan. This easy access to MRI includes 
elderly patients with degenerative knee disorders, as well as younger patients 
with traumatic injuries. With prolonged life expectancy, indication for MRI of 
the knee will be expanded, despite its high cost. Precise evaluation of 
articular cartilage in the early stages of regeneration is still a challenge; 
proper use of MR imaging for this disorder must be considered.

Cancer epidemiology in the elderly.

Franceschi S(1), La Vecchia C.

Author information:
(1)Servizio di Epidemiologia, Centro di Riferimento Oncologico, Aviano (PN), 
Italy.

Although age per se is not an important determinant of cancer risk, but rather a 
surrogate of prolonged carcinogen exposure, the increased life expectancy over 
the last few decades in most areas of the world has greatly increased cancer 
burden in the elderly. Trends in mortality for most common cancer sites in the 
elderly tended systematically to increase up to the early 1990s, but declined 
thereafter in North America and Western Europe in both sexes, and in Japanese 
females. Most trends remain unfavourable for elderly population of both sexes in 
eastern Europe, mainly reflecting patterns in smoking. Trends of incidence in 
elderly populations are more difficult to interpret, on account of changed 
diagnosis and certification for several cancer sites, including prostate cancer, 
brain tumours and multiple myeloma. Screening and early diagnosis for cancer in 
the elderly should be critically considered for prostate, but also for 
colorectal, breast and other selected neoplasms.

Current literature indicates that elevated IL-6 serum levels are associated with 
diseases, disability and mortality in the elderly. In this paper, we studied the 
IL-6 promoter genetic variability at -174 C/G locus and its effect on IL-6 serum 
levels in a total of 700 people from 60 to 110 years of age, including 323 
centenarians. We found that the proportion of homozygotes for the G allele at 
-174 locus decreases in centenarian males, but not in centenarian females. 
Moreover, we found that, only among males, homozygotes for the G allele at -174 
locus have higher IL-6 serum levels in comparison with carriers of the C allele. 
On the whole, our data suggest that those individuals who are genetically 
predisposed to produce high levels of IL-6 during aging, i.e. -174 locus GG 
homozygous men, are disadvantaged for longevity.

Effect of linear alkylbenzene sulfonate on population growth of Daphnia galeata: 
a life table evaluation.

University, Tokiwadai 79-7, Hodogaya, Yokohama, Kanagawa 240-8501, Japan.

The chronic effect of linear alkylbenzene sulfonate (LAS12) on a daphnid species 
(Daphnia galeata) was examined by the life table experiment. The estimated 
responses in the intrinsic rate of population growth r were analyzed with two 
alternate concentration-response functions, i.e., the power function and the 
quadratic function. Based on the best-fit power function model with biases 
corrected by the jackknife procedure, the population-level EC50, which is 
defined as the concentration of chemicals that reduces the population growth 
rate (the intrinsic rate of natural increase) by 50%, was estimated as 2.5 mg/L. 
The 48-h acute immobility test yielded EC50 of 4.6 mg/L. The population-level 
effect of LAS12 on this test species is considerably more sensitive than the 
acute lethal effects to neonates.

BACKGROUND: In Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS), mental retardation and compulsive 
hyperphagia cause early obesity, the co-morbidities of which lead to short 
life-expectancy, with death usually occurring in their 20s. Long-term weight 
loss is mandatory to lengthen the survival; therefore, the lack of compliance in 
voluntary food restriction requires a surgical malabsorptive approach.
METHODS: 15 PWS subjects were submitted to biliopancreatic diversion (BPD) and 
followed (100%) for a mean period of 8.5 (4-13) years. BPD consists of a distal 
gastrectomy with a long Roux-en-Y reconstruction which, by delaying the meeting 
between food and biliopancreatic juices, causes an intestinal malabsorption. 
Indication for BPD was BMI > 40 or > 35 with metabolic complications. 
Preoperative mean age was 21 +/- 5 years, mean weight 127 +/- 26 kg, and mean 
Body Mass Index (BMI, kg/m2) 53 +/- 10. According to Holm's criteria, all of the 
subjects had a total score > or = 8. IQ assessment was performed in each 
subject, with a mean score of 72 +/- 10. An arbitrary lifestyle score was given 
to each subject.
RESULTS: No perioperative complications were observed. Percent excess weight 
loss (%EWL) was 59 +/- 15 at 2 years and 56 +/- 16 at 3 years, and then 
progressive regain occurred; at 5 years %EWL was 46 +/- 22 and at 10 years 40 
+/- 27. Spearman rank test failed to demonstrate any correlation between weight 
loss at 5 years and patient data, except with lifestyle score (Spearman r = 
0.8548, p < .0001). Current mean age is 31 +/- 7 years.
CONCLUSION: BPD has to be considered for its value in prolonging and 
qualitatively improving the PWS patient's life.

Alzheimer movement re-examined 25 years later: is it a "disease" or a senile 
condition in medical nature?

Dementia in the elderly used to be rare, but why has it become a major social 
threat today? There can be many potential answers, but an ultimate one is clear: 
the longer life expectancy today. This knowledge indicates that "advanced aging" 
is a primary suspect in the origin of senile dementia. If so, then why can many 
elderly remain healthy at the same old age? We know, for example, that elderly 
people commonly have a certain degree of atherosclerosis and osteoporosis, but 
only some of them develop severe clinical symptoms at the same age. These 
different outcomes generally can be explained by "risk factors" in life 
(exercise, diet, individual background, etc). It thus appears to be a general 
pattern that advanced aging (after age 80) will set the stage for various senile 
disorders, but risk factors largely determine the onset age as well as 
individual specificity of their clinical manifestations. In this context, senile 
disorders including senile dementia would differ fundamentally from the 
pathogen-caused conventional diseases (AIDS, polio, cancer, Down's, etc.) by 
origin, incidence, and intervention strategy. This view would call into question 
the current definition of senile dementia as a conventional "disease" 
(Alzheimer's). The term "Alzheimer's disease" originally referred to "midlife" 
dementia, but it is defined today to be the same medical entity as senile 
dementia on the basis that they both display the same hallmarks and symptoms 
despite their onset age difference. Now, after in-depth scrutiny, we finally 
come to realize that they are not the same disease, but as different as heart 
failure at midlife versus the "same" failure at advanced age (i.e., a 
conventional disease versus a senile condition). Thus, by eliminating the age 
difference, the new definition has converted a senile condition into a 
conventional "disease", thereby changing the course of its scientific inquiry to 
miss the main targets. This may be why after extensive studies for 25 years, the 
origin of senile dementia has remained an enigma.

In the Western world, a sharp increase in the incidence of both Crohn's disease 
and ulcerative colitis was observed during the sixties and seventies, after 
which it reached a plateau at around 7 and 12 new cases per 100,000 inhabitants 
per year, respectively. Both chronic inflammatory bowel diseases usually 
commence between 15 and 30 years of age. Most patients have a normal life 
expectancy. A multifactorial model has been proposed to explain the 
pathogenesis, in which there seems to be an interaction between genetic 
predisposition, environmental factors and an altered immune response (occurring 
either after or because of the disease). Smoking is a clear risk factor in the 
development of Crohn's disease and it also negatively influences the clinical 
outcome. On the other hand, stopping smoking is a risk factor in the development 
of ulcerative colitis.

A multicentre observational study was conducted by the Italian Association of 
Nuclear Medicine between 1996 and 1998. Twenty-nine Nuclear Medicine Departments 
participated. The aims of the study were to systematically evaluate the 
efficacy, toxicity and repeatability of radionuclide therapy of painful bone 
metastases (RTBM) in a large number of patients and to assess its incidence in 
patients with prostate cancer. Out of 818 treatments performed with a single 
i.v. dose of 148 MBq of strontium-89 chloride or 1,295 MBq of rhenium-186 
hydroxyethylidene diphosphonate (HEDP), 610 could be evaluated (527 with 89Sr 
and 83 with 186Re-HEDP). Eighty-one patients received multiple (up to five) 
RTBM. The total number of retreatments was 100. Patients were followed up for a 
period of 3-24 months. Results, assessed according to pain relief and 
consumption of analgesic drugs, were expressed at four levels: 1, no response; 
2, mild response; 3, good response; 4, excellent response. Responses were: level 
1 in 19%, level 2 in 21.3%, level 3 in 33.3% and level 4 in 26.4% of cases. 
Retreatments showed significantly (P<0.01) worse responses (48% levels 3+4), in 
comparison to first RTBM. Duration of palliation was 5.0+/-3.5 months, and was 
longer in cases of excellent response, in first RTBM, in patients with limited 
metastases and when 89Sr was used. Better responses were found in cases of 
limited skeletal disease, under good clinical conditions, when life expectancy 
exceeded 3 months, and in radiologically osteoblastic or mixed bone lesions. The 
only statistically significant predictive factor was life expectancy (P<0.001). 
Flare phenomenon (14.1% of cases) did not correlate with the response. 
Haematological toxicity (mild to moderate in most cases) mainly affected 
platelets, and was observed in 25.5% of cases overall and in 38.9% of 
retreatments. RTBM did not seem to prolong life, though in some cases 
scintigraphic regression of bone metastases was observed. The two 
radiopharmaceuticals did not show any statistically significant differences in 
palliative efficacy and toxicity, either in first RTBM or in retreatments.

The Carvedilol and ACE-Inhibitor Remodelling Mild Heart Failure EvaluatioN trial 
(CARMEN)--rationale and design.

Remme WJ; CARMEN Steering Committee and Investigators.

Comment in
    Cardiovasc Drugs Ther. 2001 Jan;15(1):9-10.

Inhibition or reversal of ventricular remodelling in heart failure patients is 
regarded as of prime importance in the treatment of heart failure and in 
determining long term outcome. Recent studies have demonstrated that the 
addition of carvedilol to Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and 
other routine heart failure therapy results in a valuable improvement in the 
clinical status and life expectancy of mild, moderate and severe heart failure 
patients. ACE inhibitors have become the cornerstone of heart failure therapy. 
Also, carvedilol in combination with standard therapy (including ACE inhibitors) 
has demonstrable beneficial effects on left ventricular remodelling. Each new 
treatment has to be added, this quickly leads to polypharmacy, which may not be 
necessary and even unwanted in the individual patient, as the pharmacological 
profile of carvedilol compares favourably to ACE inhibitors, this suggests that 
it could challenge ACE inhibitors as first-line treatment for heart failure. The 
CARMEN trial (Carvedilol and ACE-Inhibitor Remodelling Mild Heart Failure 
EvaluatioN) was designed to compare the effects of carvedilol alone and of 
carvedilol plus an ACE inhibitor (enalapril) with the effect of an ACE inhibitor 
alone on different parameters of left ventricular remodelling as well as 
morbidity and mortality in patients with chronic mild heart failure, thereby 
allowing conclusions on whether combination therapy may be replaced by the 
multiple action adrenergic inhibitor carvedilol in the future.

This study investigates the relationship between the clinical features of 
lymphoma in the ocular adnexal region and the revised European and American 
lymphoma (REAL) classification. Specimens from 41 patients with ocular adnexal 
lymphoproliferative disease were reassessed pathologically using the REAL 
classification. Thirty-two patients with primary non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL) 
were included in the study, almost all of them having been treated with 
radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy. Seven of the 32 patients with NHL 
showed distant recurrence after treatment: 3 out of 26 with extranodal marginal 
zone B-cell lymphoma, and 4 with other types of NHL. Although the three patients 
with recurrent marginal zone B-cell lymphomas all survived, other patients with 
recurrent lymphomas died of disease. The REAL classification provides a good 
indication of tumor control probability and survival of patients with ocular 
adnexal NHL. Radiation therapy is an effective treatment modality for extranodal 
marginal zone B-cell lymphoma of the ocular adnexa.

The prognostic value of histopathological response to preoperative radiotherapy 
(50 Gy) in radically resected oral carcinomas was studied in 39 consecutive 
patients. Microvessel density (MVD) was evaluated for relation to radioresponse 
and outcome. Resected tumour tissue was examined histopathologically and 
response to radiotherapy was scored according to induced morphological changes. 
Pretreatment biopsies were stained with antibodies to von Willebrand factor to 
evaluate MVD in hot-spot regions, in stromal tissue and in tumour epithelial 
tissue. Histopathological response to radiotherapy was highly prognostic of 
local failures and survival (p = 0.002), though microscopic surgical radicality 
was obtained. In good responders to preoperative radiotherapy, the 5-year 
survival rate was 68% compared with 24% in poor responders. In 12 patients with 
local recurrence after radical surgery, 11 had poor histopathological 
radiotherapy responses. In univariate analysis, a high MVD score in tumour 
epithelium was associated with poor clinical outcome but MVD did not correlate 
with histopathological radiotherapy response.

Cyclin D1 overexpression versus response to induction chemotherapy in squamous 
cell carcinoma of the head and neck--preliminary report.

Lund, Sweden. akervall@umich.edu

The aim of this study was to investigate whether there is an association between 
overexpression of cyclin D1 and response to therapy. Immunohistochemical 
overexpression of cyclin D1 was determined in paraffin-embedded specimens from 
diagnostic biopsies of 89 primary cases of squamous cell carcinoma of the head 
and neck (SCCHN), using a polyclonal antiserum. The tumor response rates were 
estimated after curative treatment (i.e. surgery and/or radiotherapy and/or 
chemotherapy). Patients whose tumors were overexpressing cyclin D1 showed 
complete or partial response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy with cisplatin/5-FU. In 
addition, a majority of cyclin D1 negative tumors did not respond at all to this 
treatment (p = 0.02, Fisher's exact test). This study indicates that 
immunohistochemical assessment of cyclin D1 expression in SCCHN could be a new 
predictive marker to select a subgroup of patients that will benefit from 
neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

Serum lactate dehydrogenase isoenzyme 1 catalytic concentration (S-LD-1) was 
measured at the time of orchiectomy in 104 patients with nonseminomatous 
testicular germ cell tumors (NSTGCT) clinical stage I who participated in a 
randomized study comparing surveillance after orchiectomy (group I) and 
radiotherapy (group II). For 68 patients, S-LD-1 was measured in a serum sample 
before or on the day of the orchiectomy. Twenty-seven patients (40%) had 
elevated S-LD-1; median 102 U/L (range 41-335). For the remaining 36 patients. 
S-LD-1 was measured in a serum sample after orchiectomy: 8 of these patients 
(22%) had elevated S-LD-1. S-LD-1 was normalized shortly after surgery in most 
patients with a preorchiectomy elevated S-LD-1. Fifteen of the 68 patients 
relapsed: 9 out of 27 with an elevated S-LD-1 and 6 out of 41 patients with 
normal S-LD-1 (p = 0.13, Fisher's exact test). In group 1, those with a 
preoperatively elevated S-LD-1 had a lower 8-years' relapse-free survival than 
those with a normal S-LD-1 (40% vs. 80%, p = 0.003, log-rank test). The role of 
S-LD-1 in the staging, prognostication and monitoring of patients with NSGCT 
clinical stage I should be further explored in a large, prospective study.

AIM: The study aim was to determine whether the Jass classification is superior 
to that of Astler-Coller (modification of Dukes' stage) in determining prognosis 
of patients treated for colorectal carcinoma.
STUDY DESIGN: The authors used Jass' classification to restage 263 patients who 
had undergone radical colorectal surgery and classified according to 
Astler-Coller.
RESULTS: The results revealed that: 1) Astler-Coller's classification enables 
more accurate selection of patient groups where life expectancy can be 
predicted; 2) Jass' classification enables statistically significant (P <0.05) 
improved prognostic discrimination of Astler-Coller's B2 patients, for which the 
probability of nonrecurrence of the disease is around 60%.
CONCLUSIONS: Although Astler-Coller's classification is still valid, Jass' 
classification is useful for the prognostic discrimination of Astler-Coller's B2 
patients.

Buonocore memorial lecture. Adhesive dentistry applied to the treatment of 
traumatic dental injuries.

Andreasen JO(1).

Author information:
(1)Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Rigshopitalet, Copenhagen, 
Denmark.

Dental adhesive techniques have led to a significant simplification of the 
immediate and definitive treatment of traumatic dental injuries. Composite 
restoration of fractured teeth, bonding of tooth fragments, the use of laminate 
veneers or porcelain onlays and resin retained bridges are some of the ways 
adhesive techniques are used to treat fractured teeth. Furthermore, splinting of 
luxated teeth almost entirely relies on the combination of adhesion and a 
flexible resin which simulates the mobility of a normal periodontal ligament 
during the healing period. The internal strengthening of immature root-filled 
teeth with composite using an adhesive technique may possibly prevent late root 
fractures caused by weakening of the tooth structure resulting from endodontic 
procedures. Finally, the adhesive principle using a retro-seal with composite 
after apicoectomy significantly increases the healing rate and healing mode.

BACKGROUND: Pancreatic carcinoma is considered among the most chemoresistant of 
human malignancies. The most commonly used cytotoxic single agents, 
5-fluorouracil and 2'-deoxy-2',2'-difluorocytidine (gemcitabine), have objective 
response rates of less than 10% in large studies. Hypothesizing noncross 
resistance and a synergistic interaction between gemcitabine and cisplatin, 
early clinical studies have demonstrated significant activity with this 
combination in patients with several types of malignant disease. A Phase II 
study was undertaken to determine the efficacy of gemcitabine in combination 
with cisplatin in patients with locally advanced and metastatic pancreatic 
carcinoma based on these considerations.
METHODS: The eligibility criteria included histologically confirmed, locally 
advanced, unresectable or metastatic exocrine carcinoma of the pancreas with no 
prior gemcitabine therapy; prior adjuvant therapy was allowed provided the last 
day of therapy was at least 6 months prior to starting treatment; clinically 
measurable or evaluable disease; a Southwest Oncology Group scale performance 
status of 0-2; a life expectancy of > 12 weeks; and adequate bone marrow, 
hepatic, and renal function. A total of 42 patients, 4 patients with locally 
advanced, unresectable disease and 38 patients with metastatic disease, were 
treated and received a total of 211 cycles of therapy between May 1997 to March 
1999. The median age of patients was 61.5 years. The patients were treated in 
the outpatient setting with a combination of gemcitabine 1,000 mg/M(2) 
intravenously over 30 minutes administered on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each cycle 
and cisplatin 50 mg/M(2) intravenously administered after gemcitabine infusion 
on Days 1 and 15 with adequate prehydration accompanied by adequate urinary 
output. Cycles were repeated every 28 days. Response and toxicity were assessed 
according to World Health Organization and standard criteria.
RESULTS: The complete and partial response rate among all 42 registered patients 
was 11 of 42 patients (26%; 95% confidence interval, 0.14-0.42). Stabilization 
of disease was seen in 15 patients (38%). Two additional patients with 
metastatic disease who achieved major responses to chemotherapy were rendered 
free of disease surgically, achieving a complete response status. The median 
overall survival was 7.1 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 6.3-9.1 months), 
with 64% of patients alive at 6 months and 19% of patients alive at 12 months. 
The median time to disease progression was 5.4 months (range, 0.9-20.8 months). 
Major toxicities were neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, with one episode of 
neutropenic fever.
CONCLUSIONS: The combination of gemcitabine and cisplatin appeared to have 
significantly greater activity than single-agent gemcitabine in this Phase II 
study, with tolerable toxicity. The antitumor activity of this combination needs 
to be confirmed in multi-institutional or comparative trials.
