annual cost of treatment was US$834,879 (Int$2,590,845). The cost of BL 
treatment fell well within WHO-CHOICE cost-effectiveness thresholds. The ratio 
of cost per DALY averted to per capita gross domestic product was 0.14, 
reflecting a very cost-effective intervention.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that treating BL with locally tailored 
protocols is very cost-effective by international standards. Studies of this 
kind will furnish crucial evidence to help policymakers prioritize the 
allocation of LMIC health system resources among noncommunicable diseases, 
including childhood cancer.

Current provision of services for the care of chronic wounds in Australia is 
disjointed and costly. There is large variability in the way that services are 
provided, and little evidence regarding the cost-effectiveness of a specialist 
model of care for treatment and management. A decision-analytic model to 
evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a specialist wound care clinic as compared to 
usual care for chronic wounds is presented. We use retrospective and prospective 
data from a cohort of patients as well as information from administrative 
databases and published literature. Our results show specialist wound clinics 
are cost-effective for the management of chronic wounds. On average, specialist 
clinics were $3,947 cheaper than usual clinics and resulted in a quality 
adjusted life year gain of 0.04 per patient, per year. Specialist clinics were 
the best option under multiple scenarios including a different cost perspective 
and when the cost of a hospital admission was reduced. Current models of care 
are inefficient and represent low value care, and specialist wound clinics 
represent a good investment compared to current approaches for the management of 
chronic wounds in Australia.

The increase in life expectancy has boosted the incidence of age-related 
pathologies beyond social and economic sustainability. Consequently, there is an 
urgent need for interventions that revert or at least prevent the pathogenic 
age-associated deterioration. The permanent or periodic reduction of calorie 
intake without malnutrition (caloric restriction and fasting) is the only 
strategy that reliably extends healthspan in mammals including non-human 
primates. However, the strict and life-long compliance with these regimens is 
difficult, which has promoted the emergence of caloric restriction mimetics 
(CRMs). We define CRMs as compounds that ignite the protective pathways of 
caloric restriction by promoting autophagy, a cytoplasmic recycling mechanism, 
via a reduction in protein acetylation. Here, we describe the current knowledge 
on molecular, cellular, and organismal effects of known and putative CRMs in 
mice and humans. We anticipate that CRMs will become part of the pharmacological 
armamentarium against aging and age-related cardiovascular, neurodegenerative, 
and malignant diseases.

In vitro activity of azoxystrobin, dimethomorph, and fluazinam on growth, 
sporulation, and zoospore cyst germination of Phytophthora capsici, P. 
citrophthora, and P. parasitica was compared to that of fosetyl-Al and 
metalaxyl. The 50% effective concentration (EC50) values for)inhibition of 
mycelial growth of the three pathogens usually were lowest for dimethomorph and 
(metalaxyl, ranging from <0.1 to 0.38 μg/ml. However, the 90% effective 
concentration (EC90) levels for dimethomorph always were lower than the other 
four tested compounds, with values ranging from 0.32 to 1.6 μg/ml. Mycelial 
growth of P. capsici, P. citrophthora, and P. parasitica was least affected by 
azoxystrobin and fluazinam, with estimated (EC90) values >3,000 μg/ml. Reduction 
of sporangium formation by P. capsici, P. citrophthora, and P. parasitica in the 
presence of dimethomorph at 1 μg/ml was significantly greater than that recorded 
for the same concentration of azoxystrobin, fluazinam, and fosetyl-Al. For the 
three species of Phytophthora, zoospore motility was most sensitive to fluazinam 
(EC50 and EC90 values of <0.001 μg/ml) and (least sensitive to fosetyl-Al, with 
(EC50 and EC90 values ranging from 299 to 334 and 518 to 680 μg/ml, 
respectively). Germination of encysted zoospores of P. capsici, P. citrophthora, 
and P. parasitica was most sensitive to dimethomorph (EC50 and EC90 values 
ranging from 3.3 to 7.2 and 5.6 to 21 μg/ml, respectively), intermediate in 
sensitivity to fluazinam (EC50 and EC90 from 18 to 108 and 67 to >1,000 μg/ml, 
respectively) and metalaxyl (EC50 and EC90 from 32 to 280 and 49 to 529 μg/ml, 
respectively), and lowest in sensitivity to azoxystrobin and fosetyl-Al (EC50 
and EC90 from 256 to >1,000 μg/ml). The activity of azoxystrobin, dimethomorph, 
and fluazinam on one or more stages of the life cycle of P. capsici, P. 
citrophthora, and P. parasitica suggests that these compounds potentially could 
provide Phytophthora spp. disease control comparable to that of the established 
fungicides fosetyl-Al and metalaxyl.

Objective: To analyze the attributable burden of smoking on the deaths of 
cardio-cerebral vascular diseases (CCVD) in inhabitants aged 30 years and above 
in Jiangsu Province. Methods: Comparative risk assessment approach in Global 
Burden of Disease (GBD) was used with the data from Jiangsu Non-communicable 
Disease and Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System and Death Monitoring 
Surveillance System in 2013, and population attributable fraction (PAF), years 
of life lost (YLL), work of potential years of life lost, index of life lost and 
life loss attributed to smoking were calculated. Results: In 2013, there were 
162 158 CCVD deaths aged 30 years and above in the surveillance areas of Jiangsu 
Province, of which 25 102 deaths were attributed to smoking (PAF: 15.48%, 
attributed mortality rate: 55.13/100 000). The YLL, work of potential years of 
life lost and index of life lost were 532 494 person years, 78 024 person years 
and 9.15 years respectively. The decline of life expectancy was 0.58 years. The 
PAF of CCVD attributed to smoking in male and female were 27.97% and 3.18%, 
respectively, and the mortality rate of cardio-cerebral diseases attributed to 
smoking in male and female were 100.13/100 000 and 11.27/100 000, respectively. 
The burden of ischemic heart disease and hemorrhagic stroke were most severe, 
with standardized YLL rate were 3.65‰ and 3.20‰, respectively. Conclusion: 
Smoking caused a great burden of cardio-cerebral disease deaths in inhabitants 
in Jiangsu province.

Preference-based measures of health-related quality-of-life including, but not 
limited to, the EQ-5D, HUI2 and the SF-6D have been increasingly used in 
calculations of quality-adjusted life years for cost effectiveness analyses. 
However, the uncertainty around the measures' value sets is commonly ignored in 
economic evaluation. There are several types of uncertainties, including 
methodological, structural, and parameter uncertainties, with the latter being 
the focus of this review paper. The objective is to highlight the gap in the 
literature regarding the existence of uncertainty in the value sets, focusing 
mainly on the EQ-5D and SF-6D. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is 
the first systematic review revolving around uncertainty. After searching 
extensively for studies involving uncertainties in all preference-based 
measures, the results showed that uncertainty has been approached through 
different means, while parameter uncertainty has been ignored in most, if not 
all, cases. These findings suggest that uncertainty should be accounted for when 
using preference-based measures in economic evaluations. Ignoring this 
additional information could impact misleadingly on policy decisions.

OBJECTIVES: With the increase in the life expectancy of older adults, the 
scoring diagnosis of osteoporosis has been highly reported hence rising the 
incidence of fragility fractures due to decrease in bone mineral density (BMD), 
thereby significantly impacting the quality of life and health status of elderly 
population. The aim of this study is to identify the impact of different 
exercise regimes in improving the BMD among osteoporotic females.
METHODOLOGY: A trial was conducted on 93 diagnosed postmenopausal osteoporotic 
females aged 50-75 years screened on the basis of physical activity 
readiness-questionnaire and YOU form randomly divided equally into three 
groups', that is, aerobic, anaerobic, and osteoanabolic exercises using an 
envelope method. The intervention was given on the basis of American College of 
Sports Medicine (ACSM), frequency, intensity, time, and type protocol for the 
period of 12 weeks. The pre- and post-BMD was determined to find out the 
improvements on the t-value of the participants. The outcome measure was 
calculated using a peripheral dual X-ray absorptiometry scan (bone 
densitometer).
RESULTS: At 95% of confidence interval, the pre- and post-median difference 
observed within the osteoanabolic group was 0.4 followed by 0.3 and 0.1 in the 
aerobic and anaerobic groups, respectively. The level of significance was 
determined by applying the Friedman test revealing a statistically significant 
difference P < 0.001 between the groups. Further, post hoc analysis shows that 
osteoanabolic exercises were more significant in comparison with aerobic and 
anaerobic exercises.
CONCLUSION: Structured physical exercises based on ACSM protocol show 
improvement among the osteoporotic females; however, the impact of osteoanabolic 
exercises significantly increased the BMD, thus reducing the t-value. However, 
larger scale studies in different clinical settings are recommended for more 
accurate results.

BACKGROUND: The World Health Organization estimated that 90% of the infected 
people need to be diagnosed and 80% need to be treated to reach the aim of 
hepatitis C virus (HCV) elimination by 2030. For this reason, all possible 
strategies to detect and treat HCV-infected people need to be carefully 
evaluated to implement the best one.
AIM: To review and synthesise the economic evaluations of HCV screening programs 
conducted in the era of direct-acting antiviral agents regimens.
METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted until April 2018 to 
provide information on the costs and effectiveness of HCV screenings in 
direct-acting antiviral agents era. A critical assessment of the quality of 
economic evaluations retrieved was conducted.
RESULTS: The literature search identified 716 references; 17 of them assessed 
cost and effectiveness of screening programs and antiviral treatments in 
different populations: general population (n = 7), drug users (n = 5), high-risk 
populations (n = 4) and other populations (n = 3). The HCV screening and 
direct-acting antiviral agents treatment appear to be good value for money, both 
in general and high-risk populations, if a cost per quality adjusted life years 
of $50 000 is set as willingness to pay threshold. Some studies showed the value 
of including lower stage of fibrosis in the treatment selection criteria.
CONCLUSIONS: Several HCV screening strategies plus direct-acting antiviral 
agents treatments resulted cost-effectiveness in different populations. However, 
there is still need of country and population-specific evaluations within the 
different HCV screening and treatment strategies available, in order to assess 
their cost-effectiveness and sustainability and fully support an 
evidence-informed policy for HCV elimination.

Although a proven and effective preventive health measure, childhood 
immunization programs remain vulnerable to budgetary pressures. Sustainable 
financing of immunization programs is an important issue that presents a 
challenge for middle-income countries (MIC) in particular, in part due to 
technological advances meaning more vaccines are available. This study aimed to 
analyse trends in immunization program investment across 15 MIC selected based 
on availability of data, income level classification, and regional 
representativeness. We assessed investment trends in relation to vaccine 
coverage, vaccine access, and broader health indicators. Immunization and 
expenditure data were obtained from the World Health Organisation (WHO) database 
and the WHO UNICEF Joint Reporting Form and WHO Vaccine Product, Price and 
Procurement from 2006-2016. We calculated a weighted average index of vaccine 
commitment (WAIVC) based on vaccine coverage, vaccine scope, and weighted by 
vaccine innovation measured by approximating vaccine expenditure. Correlation 
analyses were conducted between immunization expenditure per-capita and each 
WAIVC, infant mortality and life expectancy. Correlation analyses at a global 
and individual country level indicate an improvement in immunization access, 
vaccination commitment measured by WAIVC, and scope of available vaccines in 
countries with sustained increases in vaccination funding. Increases in national 
immunization expenditure were correlated with reduced infant mortality and 
increased life expectancy. Vaccine expenditure comprises a small proportion 
(less than 2%) of total healthcare spending and has not uniformly increased in 
accordance with the scope of available vaccines. The present analysis supports 
the premise that countries with consistent increases in vaccine expenditure have 
increased vaccine coverage and commitment measured by WAIVC and improved broader 
health outcomes, indicating the value of sustained investment in vaccination for 
improved population health. The benefits of vaccine expenditure in this holistic 
fashion are critical to inform policy decisions on national budget allocation 
for vaccine funding.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the addition of chemotherapy or 
abiraterone to androgen deprivation.
METHODS: We developed an analytical model to determine the cost-effectiveness of 
the addition of docetaxel or abiraterone versus androgen deprivation therapy 
alone. Direct and indirect costs were included in the model. The effects were 
expressed in Quality-Adjusted Life Years adjusted for side effects.
RESULTS: Compared to androgen deprivation therapy alone, the addition of 
chemotherapy and of abiraterone generated 0.492 and 0.999, respectively, in 
Quality-Adjusted Life Years. Abiraterone led to a Quality-Adjusted Life Years 
gain of 0.506 compared to docetaxel. The incremental costs per Quality-Adjusted 
Life Years were R$ 133.649,22 for docetaxel, R$ 330.828,70 for abiraterone and 
R$ 571.379,42 for abiraterone compared to docetaxel, respectively.
CONCLUSION: The addition of chemotherapy to androgen deprivation therapy is more 
cost-effective than the addition of abiraterone to androgen deprivation therapy. 
However, discounts on abiraterone cost might improve cost-effectiveness.

OBJETIVO: Avaliar a relação custo-efetividade da adição de quimioterapia ou 
abiraterona à terapia de privação hormonal.
MÉTODOS: Um modelo analítico foi desenvolvido para determinar a relação 
custo-efetividade da adição de docetaxel ou abiraterona comparada à terapia de 
privação hormonal isolada. Custos diretos e indiretos foram incluídos no modelo. 
Os efeitos foram expressos em Anos de Vida Ajustados para Qualidade corrigidos 
pelos efeitos colaterais de cada terapia.
RESULTADOS: A adição de quimioterapia e de abiraterona à terapia de privação 
hormonal aumentou os Anos de Vida Ajustados para Qualidade em 0,492 e 0,999, 
respectivamente, em comparação à terapia de privação hormonal isolada. A 
abiraterona promoveu ganho de Anos de Vida Ajustados para Qualidade de 0,506 em 
relação ao docetaxel. O custo incremental por Anos de Vida Ajustados para 
Qualidade foi R$ 133.649,22 para o docetaxel, R$ 330.828,70 para a abiraterona e 
R$ 571.379,42 para a abiraterona comparada ao docetaxel.
CONCLUSÃO: A adição de quimioterapia à terapia de privação hormonal é mais 
custo-efetiva que a adição de abiraterona à terapia de privação hormonal. 
Contudo, descontos no custo da abiraterona poderiam tornar esse tratamento mais 
custo-efetivo.

Although not without controversy, as a general trend, the human sperm count is 
declining world-wide. One major reason for such a decline is an increase in the 
human life-span.  According to the life history tradeoff theory, fecundity is 
inversely related to the lifespan; the longer the lifespan, the lower the 
fecundity. This is essential to the maintainance of diversity and balance of 
different species. Such a corrleation validated by experimental data that show 
that the extension of life in Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila and Rodents is  
associated with reduction in fecundity. The demographic data from a public data 
source, shows that the total fertility rate is positively correlated with the 
infant death rate, it is inversely correlated with the life expectancy. We 
postulate that the fall in spermatogenesis might be regulated by the 
neuroendocrine system that underlie human longevity.

OBJECTIVE: To report the mortality data and life expectancy of geriatric hip 
fracture patients who underwent nonoperative management and compare that with a 
matched operative cohort.
DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.
SETTING: Level 1 trauma center.
PATIENTS: Geriatric (65 years of age and older) femoral neck or 
intertrochanteric fracture (OTA/AO 31A and 31B) patients.
INTERVENTION: Operative treatment with either arthroplasty, cannulated screws, 
sliding hip screw device, or cephalomedullary nail compared with nonoperative 
cohort.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: In-hospital, 30-day, and 1-year mortality.
RESULTS: Two hundred thirty-one patients, comprising 154 operative and 77 
nonoperative patients, were compared. There were no significant differences 
among age, sex, fracture location, Charlson Comorbidity Index, preinjury living 
location, dementia, and history of cardiac arrhythmia between the 2 cohorts. 
Nonoperatively managed patients were found to have a significantly higher 
percent in-hospital (28.6 vs. 3.9; P < 0.0001), 30-day (63.6 vs. 11.0; <0.0001), 
and 1-year (84.4 vs. 36.4; P < 0.0001) mortality. The mean life expectancy after 
a hip fracture for the nonoperative cohort was significantly shorter than the 
operative group (221 vs. 1024 days; P < 0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: Nonoperatively treated hip fracture patients had an 84.4% 1-year 
mortality that was significantly higher than a matched operative cohort. Our 
results demonstrate the bleak overall prognosis for nonoperatively treated 
geriatric hip fractures as well as the associated reduction in mortality with 
surgical treatment. Our findings offer helpful information by providing updated 
mortality data when discussing nonoperative hip fracture management with 
patients and their family.

BACKGROUND: Completing mortality data by information on possible socioeconomic 
inequalities in mortality is crucial for policy planning. The aim of this study 
was to build deprivation-specific life tables using the Portuguese version of 
the European Deprivation Index (EDI) as a measure of area-level socioeconomic 
deprivation, and to evaluate mortality trends between the periods 2000-2002 and 
2010-2012.
METHODS: Statistics Portugal provided the counts of deaths and population by 
sex, age group, calendar year and area of residence (parish). A socioeconomic 
deprivation level was assigned to each parish according to the quintile of their 
national EDI distribution. Death counts were modelled within the generalised 
linear model framework as a function of age, deprivation level and calendar 
period. Mortality Rate Ratios (MRR) were estimated to evaluate variations in 
mortality between deprivation groups and periods.
RESULTS: Life expectancy at birth increased from 74.0 and 80.9 years in 
2000-2002, for men and women, respectively, and to 77.6 and 83.8 years in 
2010-2012. Yet, life expectancy at birth differed by deprivation, with, compared 
to least deprived population, a deficit of about 2 (men) and 1 (women) years 
among most deprived in the whole study period. The higher mortality experienced 
by most deprived groups at birth (in 2010-2012, mortality rate ratios of 1.74 
and 1.29 in men and women, respectively) progressively disappeared with 
increasing age.
CONCLUSIONS: Persistent differences in mortality and life expectancy were 
observed according to ecological socioeconomic deprivation. These differences 
were larger among men and mostly marked at birth for both sexes.

BACKGROUND: Post-stroke disability is common, costly, and projected to increase. 
Acute stroke treatments can substantially reduce post-stroke disability, but few 
patients take advantage of these cost-effective treatments. Practical, 
cost-efficient, and sustainable interventions to address underutilized acute 
stroke treatments are currently lacking. In this context, we present the Stroke 
Ready project, a stepped wedge design, multi-level intervention that combines 
implementation science and community-based participatory research approaches to 
increase acute stroke treatments in the predominately African American community 
of Flint, Michigan, USA.
METHODS: Guided by the Tailored Implementation of Chronic Disease (TICD) 
framework, we begin with optimization of acute stroke care in emergency 
departments, with particular attention given to our safety-net hospital 
partners. Then, we move to a community-wide, multi-faceted, stroke preparedness 
intervention, with workshops led by peer educators, over 2 years. Measures of 
engagement of the safety-net hospital and the feasibility and sustainability of 
the implementation strategy as well as community intervention reach, dose 
delivered, and satisfaction will be collected. The primary outcome is acute 
stroke treatment rates, which includes both intravenous tissue plasminogen 
activator, and endovascular treatment. The co-secondary outcomes are intravenous 
tissue plasminogen activator treatment rates and the proportion of stroke 
patients who arrive by ambulance.
DISCUSSION: If successful, Stroke Ready will increase acute stroke treatment 
rates through emergency department and community level interventions. The 
stepped wedge design and process evaluation will provide insight into how Stroke 
Ready works and where it might work best. By exploring the relative 
effectiveness of the emergency department optimization and the community 
intervention, we will inform hospitals and communities as they determine how 
best to use their resources to optimize acute stroke care.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the present study is to describe the clinical 
characteristics and outcomes of patients diagnosed and treated for conjunctival 
melanoma in the Ocular Oncology Unit of the University Hospital Clinic of 
Valladolid.
METHODS: A retrospective observational case series study was conducted on 
patients diagnosed with conjunctival melanoma in the Ocular Oncology Unit of 
University Hospital Clinic of Valladolid, from January 1992 to December 2017. 
Demographic information and tumour features were recorded in a Microsoft Access 
database.
RESULTS: Among a total of 462 consecutive patients, the tumour was classified as 
melanocytic in 252 cases (54.5%), with 27 patients having the pathological 
diagnosis of conjunctival melanoma. The mean age at diagnosis was 59.2years 
(16-88), and there were 41% males and 59% females, with a mean follow-up of 
6.1±6.8years. As regards the origin of conjunctival melanoma, 16 cases (59%) 
arose from primary acquired melanosis, 26% from nevus, and 15% developed de 
novo. The treatment performed was incisional or excisional biopsy in all 
patients, local adjuvant chemotherapy in 15 cases (56%) and brachytherapy in 5 
patients (18%). The median survival was 18years and the probability of survival 
at 5 and 10years was 89% and 69%, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Conjunctival melanoma is a rare disease, usually undervalued by the 
patient as well as being underdiagnosed, leading to insufficient and delayed 
treatment. Early diagnosis and treatment are essential to prevent recurrences 
and systemic extension, as well as to preserve vision and life.

Results of mechanical versus tissue AVR: caution in young patients with tissue 
AVR.

Briffa NP.

The first aortic valve prosthesis, implanted more than 50 years ago, was a 
mechanical prosthesis (ball-and-cage design). Over the ensuing decades, tissue 
prostheses and new mechanical designs were introduced to mitigate the need for 
anticoagulation with its associated side effects. Tissue and mechanical heart 
valve prostheses were compared in two head-to-head randomised control trials. 
Both of these confirmed that mechanical prostheses were durable but patients 
suffered anticoagulant-related bleeds. Patients who received a tissue prosthesis 
were more likely to suffer prosthetic dysfunction and require reoperation. This 
trend was stronger in younger patients. Since the publication of those two 
trials, several large retrospective studies using data from meta-analyses of 
published papers or registries have failed to show a survival advantage of 
either prostheses when implanted in the aortic position in younger patients. 
This equipoise has been reflected in the heart valve disease guidelines 
published by European and US societies. In recent years, the primacy of patient 
choice, the rapid increase in life expectancy of populations, the increased 
incidence of atrial fibrillation with requirement for anticoagulation, the 
advent of transcatheter techniques to treat degenerating tissue valves as well 
as advances in anticoagulant therapy and in new tissue and to a lesser extent 
mechanical prosthetic design continue to influence choice of aortic valve 
prosthesis in younger patients undergoing aortic valve replacement.

Cervical Artificial Disc Replacement Versus Fusion for Cervical Degenerative 
Disc Disease: A Health Technology Assessment.

Health Quality Ontario.

Collaborators: Pron G, Zivaripiran H, Wells D, Walter M.

BACKGROUND: Cervical degenerative disc disease is a multifactorial condition 
that begins with deterioration of the intervertebral disc and results in further 
degeneration within the spine involving the facet joints and ligaments. This 
health technology assessment examined the effectiveness, safety, durability, and 
cost-effectiveness of cervical artificial disc replacement (C-ADR) versus fusion 
for treating cervical degenerative disc disease.
METHODS: We performed a systematic literature search of the clinical evidence 
comparing C-ADR with fusion. We assessed the risk of bias in each study and the 
quality of the body of evidence according to the Grading of Recommendations 
Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) Working Group criteria. We 
performed a systematic review of the economic literature and assessed the 
cost-effectiveness of C-ADR compared with fusion. We also estimated the budget 
impact of publicly funding C-ADR in Ontario over the next 5 years. To 
contextualize the potential value of C-ADR, we spoke with people with cervical 
degenerative disc disease.
RESULTS: Eight studies of C-ADR for one-level cervical degenerative disc disease 
and two studies of C-ADR for two-level disease satisfied the criterion of 
statistical noninferiority compared with fusion on the primary outcome of 2-year 
overall treatment success (GRADE: Moderate). In two studies of C-ADR for 
two-level disease, C-ADR was statistically superior to fusion surgery for the 
same primary outcome (GRADE: Moderate). C-ADR was also noninferior to fusion for 
perioperative outcomes (e.g., operative time, blood loss), patient satisfaction, 
and health-related quality of life (GRADE: Moderate). C-ADR was superior to 
fusion for recovery and return to work, had higher technical success, and had 
lower rates of re-operation at the index site (GRADE: Moderate). C-ADR also 
maintained motion at the index-treated cervical level (GRADE: Moderate), but 
evidence was insufficient to determine if adjacent-level surgery rates differed 
between C-ADR and fusion. Current evidence is also insufficient to determine the 
long-term durability of C-ADR.The primary economic analysis shows that C-ADR is 
likely to be cost-effective compared with fusion for both one-level 
($11,607/quality-adjusted life-year [QALY]) and two-level ($16,782/QALY) 
degeneration. Various sensitivity and scenario analyses confirm the robustness 
of the results. The current uptake for one-level and two-level C-ADR in Ontario 
is about 8% of the total eligible. For one-level involvement, the estimated net 
budget impact increases from $7,243 (18 procedures) in the first year to 
$395,623 (196 procedures) in the fifth year following public funding, for a 
total budget impact over 5 years of $916,326. For two-level involvement, the 
corresponding values are $5,460 (7 procedures) in the first year and $283,689 
(76 procedures) in the fifth year, for an estimated total budget impact of 
$705,628 over 5 years.People with cervical degenerative disc disease reported 
that symptoms of pain and numbness can have a negative impact on their quality 
of life. People with whom we spoke had tried a variety of treatments with minor 
success; surgery was perceived as the most effective and permanent solution. 
Those who had undergone C-ADR spoke positively of its impact on their quality of 
life and ability to move their neck after surgery. The limited availability of 
C-ADR in Ontario was viewed as a barrier to receiving this treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: For carefully selected patients with cervical degenerative disc 
disease, C-ADR provides patient-important and statistically significant 
reductions in pain and disability. Further, unlike fusion, C-ADR allows people 
to maintain relatively normal cervical spine motion.Compared with fusion, C-ADR 
appears to represent good value for money for adults with one-level cervical 
degenerative disc disease ($11,607/QALY) and for adults with two-level disease 
($16,782/QALY). In Ontario, publicly funding C-ADR could result in total 
additional costs of $916,326 for one-level procedures and $705,628 for two-level 
procedures over the next 5 years.People with whom we spoke who had undergone 
C-ADR surgery spoke positively of its impact on their quality of life and 
ability to move their neck after surgery. The limited availability of C-ADR in 
Ontario was viewed as a barrier to receiving this treatment.

Mango is a tropical fruit which is sensitive to chilling injury. The present 
work investigated the potential of edible coatings of chitosan and polyamine 
spermidine in increasing shelf life and quality of mango. The control fruits 
(treated with distilled water) and the mango fruits treated with different 
concentrations of chitosan (0.5%, 1.0%, and 2.0%) and spermidine (0.5, 1.0, and 
2.0 mM) were studied to improve postharvest characteristics and quality 
maintenance during cold storage. Parameters such as firmness, weight loss, 
fungal contamination, total phenol, antioxidant activity, vitamin C, pH, total 
soluble solids (TSS), titratable acidity (TA), flavor index, color index, and 
ethylene production were measured after at harvest (0), 8, 16, and 24 days of 
storage at 15 ± 2°C and relative humidity of 85%-90%. Chitosan and spermidine 
delayed water loss, firmness, and fungal contamination. Application of chitosan 
containing ascorbic acid significantly increased phenolic content and 
antioxidant activity compared to the control plants. It also changed soluble 
solid content, TA, pH of pulp, and sugar content and decreased ethylene 
production. The obtained results suggested that chitosan (2%) and spermidine 
(2 mM) had potential to improve firmness and delay deterioration processes of 
"Langra" mango after harvest.

Recession: the Portuguese case.

Although winter mortality and morbidity are phenomena common to most European 
countries, their magnitude varies significantly from country to country. The 
geographical disparities among regions with similar climates are the result of 
several social, economic, demographic, and biological conditions that influence 
an individual's vulnerability to winter conditions. The impact of poor 
socioeconomic conditions may be of such magnitude that an economic recession may 
aggravate the seasonal mortality pattern. This paper aims to measure the 
seasonal winter mortality, morbidity, and their related costs during the Great 
Recession (2009-2012) in mainland Portugal and its Regional Health 
Administrations (RHAs) and to compare it with the periods preceding and 
following it. Monthly mortality and morbidity data were collected and clustered 
into three periods: Great Recession (2009-2012), Pre-Recession (2005-2008), and 
Post-Recession (2013-2016). The impact of seasonal winter mortality and 
morbidity during the Great Recession in Portugal and its Regional Health 
Administrations was measured through the assessment of age-standardized excess 
winter (EW) death and hospital admissions rate and index, expected life 
expectancy gains without EW deaths, EW rate of potential years of life lost, and 
EW rate of emergency hospital admission costs. Important increases of winter 
deaths and hospital admissions were identified, resulting in an important number 
of potential years of life lost (87 years of life lost per 100,000 inhabitants 
in 2009-2012), life expectancy loss (1 year in 2009-2012), and National Health 
Service costs with explicit temporal and spatial variations. These human and 
economic costs have decreased consistently during the analyzed periods, while no 
significant increase was found during the Great Recession. Despite its 
reduction, the winter excess morbidity and mortality highlight that Portugal 
still faces substantial challenges related to a highly vulnerable population, 
calling for investments in better social and health protection.

PURPOSE: To determine motives and attitudes towards life-sustaining treatments 
(LSTs) by clinical and preclinical medical students.
METHODS: This was a scenario-based questionnaire that presented patients with a 
limited life expectancy. The survey was distributed among 455 medical students 
in preclinical and clinical years. Students were asked to rate their willingness 
to perform LSTs and rank the motives for doing so. The effect of medical 
education was then investigated after adjustment for age, gender, religion, 
religiosity, country of origin, and marital status.
RESULTS: Preclinical students had a significantly higher willingness to perform 
LSTs in all cases. This was observed in all treatments offered in cases of a 
metastatic oncologic patient and an otherwise healthy man after a traumatic 
brain injury (TBI). In the case of an elderly woman on long-term care, 
preclinical students had higher willingness to supply vasopressors but not 
perform an intubation, feed with a nasogastric tube, or treat with a continuous 
positive air-pressure ventilator. Both preclinical and clinical students had 
high willingness to perform resuscitation on a twelve-year-old boy with a TBI. 
Differences in motivation factors were also seen.
DISCUSSION: Preclinical students had a greater willingness to treat compared to 
clinical students in all cases and with most medical treatments offered. This is 
attributed mainly to changes along the medical curriculum. Changes in reasons 
for supplying LSTs were also documented.

BACKGROUND: Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) is a separation of 
neurosensory retina from the underlying retinal pigment epithelium. It is caused 
by retinal tears, which let fluid pass from the vitreous cavity to the 
subretinal space. Pars plana vitrectomy (PPV), scleral buckling surgery and 
pneumatic retinopexy are three accepted management strategies whose efficacy 
remains controversial. Pneumatic retinopexy is considered in a separate Cochrane
