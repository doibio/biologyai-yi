Reef-building scleractinian (stony) corals are among the most efficient 
bio-mineralizing organisms in nature. The calcification rate of scleractinian 
corals oscillates under ambient light conditions, with a cyclic, diurnal 
pattern. A fundamental question is whether this cyclic pattern is controlled by 
exogenous signals or by an endogenous 'biological-clock' mechanism, or both. To 
address this problem, we have studied calcification patterns of the Red Sea 
scleractinian coral Acropora eurystoma with frequent measurements of total 
alkalinity (AT) under different light conditions. Additionally, skeletal 
extension and ultra-structure of newly deposited calcium carbonate were 
elucidated with (86)Sr isotope labeling analysis, combined with NanoSIMS ion 
microprobe and scanning electron microscope imaging. Our results show that the 
calcification process persists with its cyclic pattern under constant light 
conditions while dissolution takes place within one day of constant dark 
conditions, indicating that an intrinsic, light-entrained mechanism may be 
involved in controlling the calcification process in photosymbiotic corals.

Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a major health problem worldwide. The average 
life expectancy during the 20th century has increased in many parts of the 
world, and therefore the opportunities to examine elderly HCC patients have 
significantly increased worldwide. Many elderly patients develop HCC with 
intermediate to advanced stages of disease at the initial diagnosis, and have 
more comorbidities and compromised liver regeneration compared with younger 
patients. These circumstances show that elderly patients with HCC are poorer 
candidates for surgical resection or transplantation. The aim of the present 
review was to focus on the clinical features and prognosis of elderly HCC 
patients not indicated for surgical resection including multimodal treatment. 
Although the chronological age of 60 or 65 years as the definition of an elderly 
person is accepted in most countries, many studies in our review article define 
elderly as those aged 75 years or older. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2017; 17: 189-201.

In the United States the prevalence of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) reached 
epidemic proportions in 2012 with over 600,000 patients being treated. The rates 
of ESRD among the elderly are disproportionally high. Consequently, as life 
expectancy increases and the baby-boom generation reaches retirement age, the 
already heavy burden imposed by ESRD on the US health care system is set to 
increase dramatically. ESRD represents the terminal stage of chronic kidney 
disease (CKD). A large body of evidence indicating that CKD is driven by renal 
tissue hypoxia has led to the development of therapeutic strategies that 
increase kidney oxygenation and the contention that chronic hypoxia is the final 
common pathway to end-stage renal failure. Numerous studies have demonstrated 
that one of the most potent means by which hypoxic conditions within the kidney 
produce CKD is by inducing a sustained inflammatory attack by infiltrating 
leukocytes. Indispensable to this attack is the acquisition by leukocytes of an 
adhesive phenotype. It was thought that this process resulted exclusively from 
leukocytes responding to cytokines released from ischemic renal endothelium. 
However, recently it has been demonstrated that leukocytes also become activated 
independent of the hypoxic response of endothelial cells. It was found that this 
endothelium-independent mechanism involves leukocytes directly sensing hypoxia 
and responding by transcriptional induction of the genes that encode the 
β2-integrin family of adhesion molecules. This induction likely maintains the 
long-term inflammation by which hypoxia drives the pathogenesis of CKD. 
Consequently, targeting these transcriptional mechanisms would appear to 
represent a promising new therapeutic strategy.

Platelets play a vital role in hemostasis and thrombosis, and their demand and 
usage has multiplied many folds over the years. However, due to the short life 
span and storage constraints on platelets, it is allowed to store them for up to 
7 days at room temperature (RT); thus, there is a need for an alternative 
storage strategy for extension of shelf life. Current investigation involves the 
addition of 50 mM N acetylcysteine (NAC) in refrigerated concentrates. 
Investigation results revealed that addition of NAC to refrigerated concentrates 
prevented platelet activation and reduced the sialidase activity upon rewarming 
as well as on prolonged storage. Refrigerated concentrates with 50 mM NAC 
expressed a 23.91 ± 6.23% of CD62P (P-Selectin) and 22.33 ± 3.42% of 
phosphotidylserine (PS), whereas RT-stored platelets showed a 46.87 ± 5.23% of 
CD62P and 25.9 ± 6.48% of phosphotidylserine (PS) after 5 days of storage. 
Further, key metabolic parameters such as glucose and lactate accumulation 
indicated reduced metabolic activity. Taken together, investigation and 
observations indicate that addition of NAC potentially protects refrigerated 
concentrates by preventing platelet activation, stabilizing sialidase activity, 
and further reducing the metabolic activity. Hence, we believe that NAC can be a 
good candidate for an additive solution to retain platelet characteristics 
during cold storage and may pave the way for extension of storage shelf life.

PURPOSE: Umeclidinium/vilanterol (UMEC/VI) is a novel fixed dose combination of 
a long-acting muscarinic receptor antagonist (LAMA) and a long-acting beta 2 
receptor antagonist (LABA) agent. This analysis evaluated the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of UMEC/VI compared with tiotropium (TIO), from 
the Spanish National Health System (NHS) perspective.
METHODS: A previously published linked equations cohort model based on the 
epidemiological longitudinal study ECLIPSE (Evaluation of COPD Longitudinally to 
Identify Predictive Surrogate End-points) was used. Patients included were COPD 
patients with a post-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) 
≤70% and the presence of respiratory symptoms measured with the modified Medical 
Research Council dyspnea scale (modified Medical Research Council ≥2). Treatment 
effect, expressed as change in FEV1 from baseline, was estimated from a 24-week 
head-to-head phase III clinical trial comparing once-daily UMEC/VI with 
once-daily TIO and was assumed to last 52 weeks following treatment initiation 
(maximum duration of UMEC/VI clinical trials). Spanish utility values were 
derived from a published local observational study. Unitary health care costs 
(€2015) were obtained from local sources. A 3-year time horizon was selected, 
and 3% discount was applied to effects and costs. Results were expressed as 
cost/quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Univariate and probabilistic 
sensitivity analysis (PSA) was performed.
RESULTS: UMEC/VI produced additional 0.03 QALY and €590 vs TIO, leading to an 
ICER of €21,475/QALY. According to PSA, the probability of UMEC/VI being 
cost-effective was 80.3% at a willingness-to-pay of €30,000/QALY.
CONCLUSION: UMEC/VI could be considered as a cost-effective treatment 
alternative compared with TIO in symptomatic COPD patients from the Spanish NHS 
perspective.

We evaluated temporal trends in survival of Swedish acute myeloid leukemia (AML) 
patients diagnosed between 1973 and 2011 using relative survival ratios (RSRs) 
and a measure called the loss in expectation of life (LEL). RSRs increased most 
for patients <60 years at diagnosis during the first calendar periods, but 
between 1997-2005 and 2006-2011 the most pronounced increase was for those aged 
61-70 years at diagnosis; RSR changed from 0.16 (95% confidence interval (CI): 
0.13-0.19) to 0.28 (95% CI: 0.23-0.33), respectively. The LEL for males aged 35 
years at diagnosis was 41.0 (95% CI: 40.1-41.8) years in 1975 and 19.5 (95% CI: 
16.4-22.5) years in 2011. For males aged 65 years, the corresponding figures 
were 13.8 (95% CI: 13.7-14.0) and 12.0 (95% CI: 11.3-12.8). Conditional LEL 
estimates suggested that patients who survive 5 years postdiagnosis have shorter 
remaining lifespan than the general population. The proportion of expected life 
lost (PELL) suggested that male 65-year-old patients lost 75% of their life 
expectancy in 2005 and 66% if they were diagnosed in 2011. Survival continued to 
increase to 2011, with larger improvements in those aged 61-70 years at 
diagnosis. The LEL and PELL are intuitive measures that may be useful in 
communicating survival statistics to patients, clinicians and health-care 
providers.

This 9-month randomised controlled workplace physical activity trial 
investigated the effects of soccer and Zumba exercise, respectively, on muscle 
strength, maximal jump height, sit-and-reach flexibility and postural sway among 
female workers. A total of 107 female hospital employees aged 25-63 were 
cluster-randomised to a soccer group, a Zumba group or a control group. Training 
was conducted outside working hours as two to three 1-h weekly sessions the 
first 3 months and once a week the last 6 months. Tests were conducted at 
baseline, after 3 and 9 months. The soccer group improved maximal neck extension 
strength both after 3 (1.2 kg; P < 0.05) and 9 months (1.7 kg; P < 0.01) 
compared to the control group. The Zumba group improved maximal trunk extension 
strength (3.1 kg; P = 0.04) after 3 months, with improvements in postural sway 
velocity moment (-9.2 mm(2)/s; P < 0.05) and lower limb lean mass (0.4 kg; 
P < 0.05) after 9 months. No significant intervention effects were revealed in 
vertical jump height or sit-and-reach flexibility. The present study indicates 
that workplace-initiated soccer and Zumba exercise may be beneficial for 
improvement of the neck and trunk strength, which may have preventive effects 
with regard to future perceived muscle pain in the respective body regions. 
Furthermore, the Zumba group revealed positive effects on lower limb lean mass 
and postural sway compared to the control group.

BACKGROUND: Surgical treatment of long-bone metastases requires a comprehensive 
approach. The indications for surgery are based on the patient's general 
condition, type and stage of cancer, and survival time expectancy. Tumor modular 
endoprostheses have been increasingly used. Surgery should provide pain relief 
and improve the quality of life.
METHODS: Between 2010 and 2013, 67 patients with malignant metastases were 
surgically treated with resection prostheses. We performed a retrospective 
analysis of the indications for the surgery, its course, the type of the 
prostheses used, and the implantation techniques applied. We evaluated the most 
important clinical parameters influencing the postoperative quality of life of 
the patients.
RESULTS: Breast, prostate, and lung cancers are the most common primary tumors 
that metastasize to bones. The most common site of the lesions is the proximal 
femur; sporadically, they do occur in bones distal to the knee and elbow. After 
the surgery, all the patients could walk, most of them without crutches. The 
pain, rated on a VAS scale, decreased significantly, and the Karnofsky score 
improved. We observed that joint mobility and the strength of the muscles in the 
limbs allowed for normal functioning. Postoperative complications including 
infections and local tumor recurrences were rarely observed.
CONCLUSIONS: The use of modular prostheses is an adequate method of treatment in 
patients with bone metastases. A radical resection of the tumor, which prevents 
local recurrences and loosening of implants, gives good outcomes. Reduced joint 
mobility resulting from muscle attachment cutting is well tolerated and concerns 
mainly patients that underwent operations on the humerus.

The aim of this study was to estimate the mapping model for EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D) 
utility values using the health assessment questionnaire disability index 
(HAQ-DI), pain visual analog scale (VAS), and disease activity score in 28 
joints (DAS28) in a large, nationwide cohort of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) 
patients in Korea. The KORean Observational study Network for Arthritis (KORONA) 
registry data on 3557 patients with RA were used. Data were randomly divided 
into a modeling set (80 % of the data) and a validation set (20 % of the data). 
The ordinary least squares (OLS), Tobit, and two-part model methods were 
employed to construct a model to map to the EQ-5D index. Using a combination of 
HAQ-DI, pain VAS, and DAS28, four model versions were examined. To evaluate the 
predictive accuracy of the models, the root-mean-square error (RMSE) and mean 
absolute error (MAE) were calculated using the validation dataset. A model that 
included HAQ-DI, pain VAS, and DAS28 produced the highest adjusted R (2) as well 
as the lowest Akaike information criterion, RMSE, and MAE, regardless of the 
statistical methods used in modeling set. The mapping equation of the OLS method 
is given as EQ-5D = 0.95-0.21 × HAQ-DI-0.24 × pain VAS/100-0.01 × DAS28 
(adjusted R (2) = 57.6 %, RMSE = 0.1654 and MAE = 0.1222). Also in the 
validation set, the RMSE and MAE were shown to be the smallest. The model with 
HAQ-DI, pain VAS, and DAS28 showed the best performance, and this mapping model 
enabled the estimation of an EQ-5D value for RA patients in whom utility values 
have not been measured.

Background Lung cancer is the most common type of cancer in the world and is 
associated with significant mortality. Nivolumab demonstrated statistically 
significant improvements in progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival 
(OS) for patients with advanced squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who 
were previously treated. The cost-effectiveness of nivolumab has not been 
assessed in Canada. A contentious component of projecting long-term cost and 
outcomes in cancer relates to the modeling approach adopted, with the two most 
common approaches being partitioned survival (PS) and Markov models. The 
objectives of this analysis were to estimate the cost-utility of nivolumab and 
to compare the results using these alternative modeling approaches. Methods Both 
PS and Markov models were developed using docetaxel and erlotinib as 
comparators. A three-health state model was used consisting of progression-free, 
progressed disease, and death. Disease progression and time to progression were 
estimated by identifying best-fitting survival curves from the clinical trial 
data for PFS and OS. Expected costs and health outcomes were calculated by 
combining health-state occupancy with medical resource use and quality-of-life 
assigned to each of the three health states. The health outcomes included in the 
model were survival and quality-adjusted-life-years (QALYs). Results Nivolumab 
was found to have the highest expected per-patient cost, but also improved 
per-patient life years (LYs) and QALYs. Nivolumab cost an additional $151,560 
and $140,601 per QALY gained compared to docetaxel and erlotinib, respectively, 
using a PS model approach. The cost-utility estimates using a Markov model were 
very similar ($152,229 and $141,838, respectively, per QALY gained). Conclusions 
Nivolumab was found to involve a trade-off between improved patient survival and 
QALYs, and increased cost. It was found that the use of a PS or Markov model 
produced very similar estimates of expected cost, outcomes, and incremental 
cost-utility.

OBJECTIVE: To analyze the disease burden caused by low body weight in children 
under 5 years old in China from 1990 to 2010.
METHODS: The analysis was conducted on the low body weight related deaths, years 
lived with disability (YLD), years of life lost (YLL) and disability-adjusted 
life years (DALY) in children aged <5 years in China from 1990 to 2010 by using 
the data for the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 
2010 (GBD2010). The annual low body weight related deaths, YLL, YLD and DALY 
from 1990 to 2010 were compared.
RESULTS: Among the children aged <5 years, 2 271 deaths and 295 300 person-years 
DALY were attributable to low body weight in 2010. Compared with 1990, the 
number of deaths and DALY attributed to low body weight decreased by 96.75% and 
95.46% respectively. In 2010, the YLD and YLL attributable to low body weight in 
the children aged <5 years were 101 500 person-years and 193 800 person-years 
respectively. Compared with 1990, the YLD and YLL caused by low body weight in 
the children aged <5 years declined by 444 800 and 5.76 million person-years 
respectively.
CONCLUSION: Compared with 1990, the death and DALY, YLD and YLL attributable to 
low body weight in the children aged <5 years significantly declined in 2010. 
Considering the serious impact of death to loss of life in young age group, the 
effects and burden of disease caused by low body weight in the children aged <5 
years should not be neglected in China.

Soil flooding is a common stress factor affecting plants. To sustain root 
function in the hypoxic environment, flooding-tolerant plants may form new, 
aerenchymatous adventitious roots (ARs), originating from preformed, dormant 
primordia on the stem. We investigated the signaling pathway behind AR 
primordium reactivation in the dicot species Solanum dulcamara Transcriptome 
analysis indicated that flooding imposes a state of quiescence on the stem 
tissue, while increasing cellular activity in the AR primordia. Flooding led to 
ethylene accumulation in the lower stem region and subsequently to a drop in 
abscisic acid (ABA) level in both stem and AR primordia tissue. Whereas ABA 
treatment prevented activation of AR primordia by flooding, inhibition of ABA 
synthesis was sufficient to activate them in absence of flooding. Together, this 
reveals that there is a highly tissue-specific response to reduced ABA levels. 
The central role for ABA in the response differentiates the pathway identified 
here from the AR emergence pathway known from rice (Oryza sativa). Flooding and 
ethylene treatment also induced expression of the polar auxin transporter PIN2, 
and silencing of this gene or chemical inhibition of auxin transport inhibited 
primordium activation, even though ABA levels were reduced. Auxin treatment, 
however, was not sufficient for AR emergence, indicating that the auxin pathway 
acts in parallel with the requirement for ABA reduction. In conclusion, 
adaptation of S. dulcamara to wet habitats involved co-option of a hormonal 
signaling cascade well known to regulate shoot growth responses, to direct a 
root developmental program upon soil flooding.

Objective Considering the increasing number of treatment options for metastatic 
breast cancer (MBC), it is important to develop high-quality methods to assess 
the cost-effectiveness of new anti-cancer drugs. This study aims to develop a 
global economic model that could be used as a benchmark for the economic 
evaluation of new therapies for MBC. Methods The Global Pharmacoeconomics of 
Metastatic Breast Cancer (GPMBC) model is a Markov model that was constructed to 
estimate the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life years (QALY) of new 
treatments for MBC from a Canadian healthcare system perspective over a lifetime 
horizon. Specific parameters included in the model are cost of drug treatment, 
survival outcomes, and incidence of treatment-related adverse events (AEs). 
Global parameters are patient characteristics, health states utilities, 
disutilities, and costs associated with treatment-related AEs, as well as costs 
associated with drug administration, medical follow-up, and end-of-life care. 
The GPMBC model was tested and validated in a specific context, by assessing the 
cost-effectiveness of lapatinib plus letrozole compared with other widely used 
first-line therapies for post-menopausal women with hormone receptor-positive 
(HR+) and epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive (HER2+) MBC. Results When 
tested, the GPMBC model led to incremental cost-utility ratios of CA$131 811 per 
QALY, CA$56 211 per QALY, and CA$102 477 per QALY for the comparison of 
lapatinib plus letrozole vs letrozole alone, trastuzumab plus anastrozole, and 
anastrozole alone, respectively. Results of the model testing were quite similar 
to those obtained by Delea et al., who also assessed the cost-effectiveness of 
lapatinib in combination with letrozole in HR+/HER2 + MBC in Canada, thus 
suggesting that the GPMBC model can replicate results of well-conducted economic 
evaluations. Conclusions The GPMBC model can be very valuable as it allows a 
quick and valid assessment of the cost-effectiveness of any new treatments for 
MBC in a Canadian context.

AIMS: A pragmatic multicentre randomised controlled trial (PROFHER) was 
conducted in United Kingdom National Health Service (NHS) hospitals to evaluate 
the clinical effectiveness and cost effectiveness of surgery compared with 
non-surgical treatment for displaced fractures of the proximal humerus involving 
the surgical neck in adults.
METHODS: A cost utility analysis from the NHS perspective was performed. 
Differences between surgical and non-surgical treatment groups in costs and 
quality adjusted life years (QALYs) at two years were used to derive an estimate 
of the cost effectiveness of surgery using regression methods.
RESULTS: Patients randomised to receive surgical intervention accumulated mean 
greater costs and marginally lower QALYs than patients randomised to 
non-surgery. The surgical intervention cost a mean of £1758 more per patient 
(95% confidence intervals (CI) £1126 to £2389). Total QALYs for the surgical 
group were smaller than those for non-surgery -0.0101 (95% CI -0.13 to 0.11). 
The probability of surgery being cost effective was less than 10% given the 
current NICE willingness to pay at a threshold of £20 000 for an additional 
QALY. The results were robust to sensitivity analyses.
DISCUSSION: The results suggest that current surgical treatment is not cost 
effective for the majority of displaced fractures of the proximal humerus 
involving the surgical neck in the United Kingdom's NHS.
TAKE HOME MESSAGE: The results of this trial do not support the trend of 
increased surgical treatment for patients with displaced fractures of the 
proximal humerus involving the surgical neck within the United Kingdom NHS.

The ageing population and an increase in both the incidence and prevalence of 
cancer pose a healthcare challenge, some of which is borne by the orthopaedic 
community in the form of osteoporotic fractures and metastatic bone disease. In 
recent years there has been an increasing understanding of the pathways involved 
in bone metabolism relevant to osteoporosis and metastases in bone. Newer 
therapies may aid the management of these problems. One group of drugs, the 
antibody mediated anti-resorptive therapies (AMARTs) use antibodies to block 
bone resorption pathways. This review seeks to present a synopsis of the 
guidelines, pharmacology and potential pathophysiology of AMARTs and other new 
anti-resorptive drugs. We evaluate the literature relating to AMARTs and new 
anti-resorptives with special attention on those approved for use in clinical 
practice. Denosumab, a monoclonal antibody against Receptor Activator for 
Nuclear Factor Kappa-B Ligand. It is the first AMART approved by the National 
Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence and the US Food and Drug 
Administration. Other novel anti-resorptives awaiting approval for clinical use 
include Odanacatib. Denosumab is indicated for the treatment of osteoporosis and 
prevention of the complications of bone metastases. Recent evidence suggests, 
however, that denosumab may have an adverse event profile similar to 
bisphosphonates, including atypical femoral fractures. It is, therefore, 
essential that orthopaedic surgeons are conversant with these medications and 
their safe usage.
TAKE HOME MESSAGE: Denosumab has important orthopaedic indications and has been 
shown to significantly reduce patient morbidity in osteoporosis and metastatic 
bone disease.

Health systems worldwide struggle to meet increasing demands for health care, 
and Norway is no exception. This paper discusses the new, comprehensive 
framework for priority setting recently laid out by the third Norwegian 
Committee on Priority Setting in the Health Sector. The framework posits that 
priority setting should pursue the goal of "the greatest number of healthy life 
years for all, fairly distributed" and centres on three criteria: 1) The 
health-benefit criterion: The priority of an intervention increases with the 
expected health benefit (and other relevant welfare benefits) from the 
intervention; 2) The resource criterion: The priority of an intervention 
increases, the less resources it requires; and 3) The health-loss criterion: The 
priority of an intervention increases with the expected lifetime health loss of 
the beneficiary in the absence of such an intervention. Cost-effectiveness plays 
a central role in this framework, but only alongside the health-loss criterion 
which incorporates a special concern for the worse off and promotes fairness. In 
line with this, cost-effectiveness thresholds are differentiated according to 
health loss. Concrete implementation tools and open processes with user 
participation complement the three criteria. Informed by the proposal, the 
Ministry of Health and Care Services is preparing a report to the Parliament, 
with the aim of reaching political consensus on a new priority-setting framework 
for Norway.

BACKGROUND: While antiretroviral therapies have improved life expectancy and 
reduced viral loads in HIV-1-positive individuals, the cessation of treatment 
results in a rebound of viral replication. This suggests that a reservoir of 
latently-infected cells remains within these patients, the identity of which is 
ill-defined and therefore difficult to target therapeutically. Current 
strategies are aimed at using drugs such as histone deacetylase (HDAC) 
inhibitors to induce the expression of latent HIV-1 proviruses in order to 
activate and ultimately eradicate this reservoir of infected cells. One concern 
with the use of HDAC inhibitors is that they could up-regulate human endogenous 
retroviruses (HERVs), as well as HIV-1, with potentially pathophysiological 
consequences.
RESULTS: In this study, we analysed the transcription of HERV genes in HIV-1 
latency T cell (J-LAT 8.4) and monocyte (U1) models following treatment with the 
HDAC inhibitors, vorinostat, panobinostat and romidepsin. We examined the 
expression of HERV-K (HML-2) env and pol, as well as the co-opted genes HERV-W 
env (syncytin-1), HERV-FRD env (syncytin-2), in these cell lines. Finally, we 
investigated HERV expression in primary human T cells.
CONCLUSIONS: We show that HDAC inhibitors did not substantially increase the 
transcription of the analysed HERV env or pol genes, suggesting that histone 
acetylation is not crucial for controlling HERV expression in these experimental 
models and in ex vivo primary human T cells. Importantly, this indicates that 
unwanted HERV expression does not appear to be a barrier to the use of HDAC 
inhibitors in HIV-1 cure strategies.

Hexokinase is a key regulator of energy metabolism and ROS activity in insect 
lifespan extension.

University, Guangzhou 510006, China.

Developmental arrest (diapause) is a 'non-aging' state that is similar to the 
Caenorhabditis elegans dauer stage and Drosophila lifespan extension. Diapause 
results in low metabolic activity and a profound extension of insect lifespan. 
Here, we cloned the Helicoverpa armigera Hexokinase (HK) gene, a gene that is 
critical for the developmental arrest of this species. HK expression and 
activity levels were significantly increased in nondiapause-destined pupae 
compared with those of diapause-destined pupae. Downregulation of HK activity 
reduced cell viability and delayed pupal development by reducing metabolic 
activity and increasing ROS activity, which suggests that HK is a key regulator 
of insect development. We then identified the transcription factors Har-CREB, 
-c-Myc, and -POU as specifically binding the Har-HK promoter and regulating its 
activity. Intriguingly, Har-POU and -c-Myc are specific transcription factors 
for HK expression, whereas Har-CREB is nonspecific. Furthermore, Har-POU and 
-c-Myc could respond to ecdysone, which is an upstream hormone. Therefore, low 
ecdysone levels in diapause-destined individuals lead to low Har-POU and -c-Myc 
expression levels, ultimately repressing Har-HK expression and inducing entry 
into diapause or lifespan extension.

It is generally recognized that a distinguishing feature of life is its peculiar 
capability to avoid equilibration. The origin of this capability and its 
evolution along the timeline of abiogenesis is not yet understood. We propose to 
study an analog of this phenomenon that could emerge in non-biological systems. 
To this end, we introduce the concept of sustainability of transient kinetic 
regimes. This concept is illustrated via investigation of cooperative effects in 
an extended system of compartmentalized chemical oscillators under batch and 
semi-batch conditions. The computational study of a model system shows robust 
enhancement of lifetimes of the decaying oscillations which translates into the 
evolution of the survival function of the transient non-equilibrium regime. This 
model does not rely on any form of replication. Rather, it explores the role of 
a structured effective environment as a contributor to the system-bath 
interactions that define non-equilibrium regimes. We implicate the noise 
produced by the effective environment of a compartmentalized oscillator as the 
cause of the lifetime extension.

Meningococcus B is the most prevalent Neisseria meningitidis serogroup isolated 
in Hungary. Bexsero is one of the vaccines developed against it, which has been 
available in Hungary since the summer of 2014. The authors summarize the most 
important issues and open questions concerning the disease and the vaccine based 
on literature review. Based on immunological evidence, it is expected that 
Bexsero provides protection against this rare but very serious infection. 
However, the vaccine is extremely expensive, the clinical effectiveness has not 
yet been proven and it frequently causes fever, especially in infants where the 
vaccine is most needed. According to the opinion of the authors, the formulation 
of a Hungarian guideline concerning the application of Bexsero should be 
postponed until the accumulating international experience makes it possible to 
better judge the vaccine's benefits, risks and cost-effectiveness. For patients 
with asplenia, complement defect or other immunological defect, or in case of 
markedly increased individual risk of contracting the disease, the vaccination 
is already justified.

INTRODUCTION: Self-expandable metal and plastic stents can be applied in the 
palliative endoscopic treatment of patients with unresectable malignant biliary 
obstruction. The use of metal stentsis recommended if the patient's life 
expectancy is more than four months.
AIM: To compare the therapeutic efficacy and cost-effectiveness of metal and 
plastic stents in the treatment of malignant biliary obstruction.
METHOD: The authors retrospectively enrolled patients who received metal (37 
patients) or plastic stent (37 patients). The complication rate, stent patency 
and cumulative cost of treatment were assessed in the two groups.
RESULTS: The complication rate of metal stents was lower (37.84% vs. 56.76%), 
but the stent patency was higher compared with plastic stents (19.11 vs. 8.29 
weeks; p = 0.0041). In the plastic stent group the frequency of hospitalization 
of patients in context with stent complications (1.18 vs. 2.32; p = 0.05) and 
the necessity of reintervention for stent dysfunction (17 vs. 27; p = 0.033) 
were substantially higher. In this group multiple stent implantation raised the 
stent patency from 7.68 to 10.75 weeks. There was no difference in the total 
cost of treatment of malignant biliary obstruction between the two groups (p = 
0.848).

authors recommend self-expandable metal sten timplantation if the life 
expectancy of patients is more than two months. In short survival cases multiple 
plastic stent implantation is recommended.
