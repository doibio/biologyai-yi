be lowered by correcting the effects of a subset of common low effect gene 
variants. In this paper, simulations show that if such gene therapy were to 
become technically possible; and if the incidences of the treated diseases 
follow the proportional hazards model with a multiplicative genetic architecture 
composed of a sufficient number of common small effect gene variants, then: (a) 
late-onset diseases with the highest familial heritability will have the largest 
number of variants available for editing; (b) diseases that currently have the 
highest lifetime risk, particularly those with the highest incidence rate 
continuing into older ages, will prove the most challenging cases in lowering 
lifetime risk and delaying the age of onset at a population-wide level; (c) 
diseases that are characterized by the lowest lifetime risk will show the 
strongest and longest-lasting response to such therapies; and (d) longer life 
expectancy is associated with a higher lifetime risk of these diseases, and this 
tendency, while delayed, will continue after therapy.

BACKGROUND: The life expectancy of cancer patients, and the loss in expectation 
of life as compared to the life expectancy without cancer, is a useful measure 
of cancer patient survival and complement the more commonly reported 5-year 
survival. The estimation of life expectancy and loss in expectation of life 
generally requires extrapolation of the survival function, since the follow-up 
is not long enough for the survival function to reach 0. We have previously 
shown that the survival of the cancer patients can be extrapolated by breaking 
down the all-cause survival into two component parts, the expected survival and 
the relative survival, and make assumptions for extrapolation of these functions 
independently. When extrapolating survival from a model including covariates 
such as calendar year, age at diagnosis and deprivation status, care has to be 
taken regarding the assumptions underlying the extrapolation. There are often 
different alternative ways for modelling covariate effects or for assumptions 
regarding the extrapolation.
METHODS: In this paper we describe and discuss different alternative approaches 
for extrapolation of survival when estimating life expectancy and loss in 
expectation of life for cancer patients. Flexible parametric models within a 
relative survival setting are used, and examples are presented using data on 
colon cancer in England.
RESULTS: Generally, the different modelling assumptions and approaches give 
small differences in the estimates of loss in expectation of life, however, the 
results can differ for younger ages and for conditional estimates.
CONCLUSION: Sensitivity analyses should be performed to evaluate the effect of 
the assumptions made when modelling and extrapolating survival to estimate the 
loss in expectation of life.

BACKGROUND: Early start of palliative care improves the quality of life of 
eligible patients and their relatives. However, in hospital, patients who could 
benefit from palliative care are often not identified timely. The aim of this 
study is to assess how hospital-based nurses and physicians define the 
palliative phase, how they identify the palliative phase and what difficulties 
they face.
METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were held with ten nurses and 18 physicians 
working at seven hospitals in the Netherlands. Data was analysed using thematic 
analysis.
RESULTS: Nurses and physicians feel insecure about how to define the palliative 
phase and differentiate between an acute and extended phase. Great variation 
existed in what life expectancy is attributed to each phase. A variety of ways 
to identify the palliative phase were described: 1) Prognostication. 2) 
Treatment trade-off. 3) Assessment of patients' preferences and needs. 4) 
Interprofessional collaboration. Professionals base prognostication on their 
experience but also search for clinical indicators. When benefits of treatment 
no longer outweigh the negatives, this was considered an, albeit late, 
identification point. To start a conversation on a patients' palliative care 
needs was found to be difficult. Therefore, some respondents wait for patients 
to vocalize preferences themselves. Many professionals rely on interprofessional 
collaboration for identification, however uncertainty exist about 
responsibilities. Difficulties in identification occurred because of variance in 
definitions, unpredictability of non-oncological diseases, focus on treatment 
and difficulties in communication and collaboration.
CONCLUSION: These results provide insight into the challenges and difficulties 
hospital-based professionals experience in timely identification of patients 
with palliative care needs.

Cost utility analysis of pharmacist counseling care for breast cancer 
chemotherapy outpatients.

Tanaka K, Tachi T, Hori A, Osawa T, Nagaya K, Makino T, Inoue S, Yasuda M, Mizui 
T, Nakada T, Goto C, Teramachi H.

Chemotherapy for cancer is increasingly implemented in the outpatient setting. 
Pharmacists contribute to cancer treatment by conducting counseling during 
outpatient chemotherapy visits. They provide guidance on drug treatment, side 
effects, and side effect countermeasures on every visit. However, there have 
been few economic evaluations of pharmacist involvement in outpatient 
chemotherapy. Therefore, we performed a cost utility analysis. We assigned usual 
care (control) and pharmacist counseling to two groups of 19 patients receiving 
outpatient chemotherapy for breast cancer at Gifu Municipal hospital. Quality of 
life was measured at three timepoints before and during chemotherapy treatment 
using the EuroQol 5 dimension instrument (EQ-5D). EQ-5D values across the 
timepoints were 0.831, 0.757, and 0.791 for the control group, and 0.882, 0.883, 
and 0.921 for the pharmacist counseling group. The additional cost in the 
pharmacist counseling group was 2,227 yen per counseling session. The change in 
quality-adjusted life years (QALY) was a maximum of -0.021±0.186 in the control 
group and 0.007±0.199 in the pharmacist counseling group. The maximum cost for 
one QALY was 1,360,558 yen (≈12,460 US dollars). Pharmacists' counseling in 
outpatient cancer chemotherapy for breast cancer patients had an acceptable 
incremental cost-effect ratio, contributing to improved patient quality of life 
without significant additional expenditure to healthcare.

As the life expectancy of patients with cystic fibrosis has increased, greater 
attention has been paid towards the diagnosis and management of the longer term 
consequences of the condition. A recognised but rare complication of the disease 
is the development of secondary amyloidosis. Whilst deposition of amyloid 
protein has been reported in a high proportion of patients with cystic fibrosis 
at post-mortem [1] and Serum Amyloid A protein has been shown to correlate with 
disease activity and response to antibiotics [2], the manifestation of clinical 
disease remains extremely uncommon. The prognosis for patients with amyloid 
secondary to cystic fibrosis in published reports has been historically bleak 
[3-6], however there may be novel approaches in the era of biological therapies. 
The theoretical potential for an increase in the incidence of secondary amyloid 
amongst the population of cystic fibrosis patients who are experiencing much 
longer lifespans means that it is worthwhile to consider the condition and its 
possible treatments in more detail. We report a case and a review of the 
literature.

Outcomes following early parenteral nutrition use in preterm neonates: protocol 
for an observational study.

Author information:
(1)Section of Neonatal Medicine, Imperial College London, London, UK.

INTRODUCTION: Preterm babies are among the highest users of parenteral nutrition 
(PN) of any patient group, but there is wide variation in commencement, 
duration, and composition of PN and uncertainty around which groups will benefit 
from early introduction. Recent studies in critically unwell adults and children 
suggest that harms, specifically increased rates of nosocomial infection, 
outweigh the benefits of early administration of PN. In this study, we will 
describe early PN use in neonatal units in England, Wales and Scotland. We will 
also evaluate if this is associated with differences in important neonatal 
outcomes in neonates born between 30+0 and 32+6 weeks+days gestation.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will use routinely collected data from all neonatal 
units in England, Wales and Scotland, available in the National Neonatal 
Research Database (NNRD). We will describe clinical practice in relation to any 
use of PN during the first 7 postnatal days among neonates admitted to neonatal 
care between 1 January 2012 and 31 December 2017. We will compare outcomes in 
neonates born between 30+0 and 32+6 weeks+days gestation who did or did not 
receive PN in the first week after birth using a propensity score-matched 
approach. The primary outcome will be survival to discharge home. Secondary 
outcomes will include components of the neonatal core outcome set: outcomes 
identified as important by former patients, parents, clinicians and researchers.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: We have obtained UK National Research Ethics Committee 
approval for this study (Ref: 18/NI/0214). The results of this study will be 
presented at academic conferences; the UK charity Bliss will aid dissemination 
to former patients and parents.

Dimorphic plant and human mycopathogens require a switch from the usual yeast 
growth to filamentous growth for host tissue penetration, and the switch is 
controlled by multiple signaling systems other than the central developmental 
pathway. Unlike these fungi, dimorphic insect mycopathogens usually grow by 
hyphal extension, infect the host by hyphal penetration through the insect 
cuticle, and switch to unicellular blastospores from the penetrating hyphae only 
after entry into the host hemocoel, where blastospore propagation by yeast-like 
budding accelerates host mummification. Here, we report a dependence of the 
virulence-required dimorphic transition on the central pathway activators BrlA 
and AbaA in Beauveria bassiana Deletion of brlA or abaA abolished both aerial 
conidiation and submerged blastospore formation in vitro despite no negative 
impact on hyphal growth in various media, including a broth mimic of insect 
hemolymph. The hyphae of either deletion mutant lost insect pathogenicity 
through normal cuticle penetration, contrasting with a high infectivity of 
wild-type hyphae. The mutant hyphae injected into the host hemocoel failed to 
form blastospores, resulting in slower lethal action. Uncovered by 
transcriptomic analysis, several genes involved in host adhesion and cuticle 
degradation were sharply repressed in both deletion mutants versus wild type. 
However, almost all signaling genes homologous to those acting in the dimorphic 
switch of other fungi were not differentially expressed at a significant level 
and hence unlikely to be involved in shutting down the dimorphic switch of each 
deletion mutant. Therefore, like aerial conidiation, the submerged dimorphic 
switch in vitro and in vivo is a process of asexual development governed by the 
two central pathway activators in B. bassiana IMPORTANCE Dimorphic insect 
mycopathogens infect the host by hyphal penetration through the host cuticle and 
switch from the penetrating hyphae to unicellular blastospores after entry into 
the host hemocoel, where blastospore propagation by yeast-like budding 
accelerates host mummification to death. The fungal virulence-required dimorphic 
switch is confirmed as a process of asexual development directly regulated by 
BrlA and AbaA, two key activators of the central developmental pathway in an 
insect mycopathogen. This finding unveils a novel mechanism distinct from the 
control of the dimorphic switch by multiple signaling systems other than the 
central developmental pathway in dimorphic plant and human mycopathogens, which 
switch from the usual yeast growth to filamentous growth required for 
pathogenicity through host tissue penetration.

BACKGROUND: Herpes zoster (HZ) develops in up to 50% of unvaccinated 
individuals, accounting for >1 million cases annually in the United States. A 
live attenuated HZ vaccine (LAV) is Food and Drug Administration approved for 
those age 50 years or older, though Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices 
recommendations are only for those age 60 years or older. LAV efficacy is ~70% 
for persons 50-59 years of age, with lower efficacy in older adults. A new 
2-dose adjuvanted subunit vaccine (SUV) has >95% efficacy in persons 50-69 years 
of age and remains ~90% efficacious in persons vaccinated at age 70 years.
METHODS: To estimate the relative cost-effectiveness of SUV, LAV, and no 
vaccination (NoV) strategies, a Markov model was developed based on published 
data on vaccine efficacy, durability of protection, quality of life, resource 
utilization, costs, and disease epidemiology. The perspective was US societal, 
and the cycle length was 1 year with a lifelong time horizon. SUV efficacy was 
estimated to wane at the same rate as LAV. Outcomes evaluated included lifetime 
costs, discounted life expectancy, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios 
(ICERs).
RESULTS: For individuals vaccinated at age 50 years, the ICER for LAV vs NoV was 
$118 535 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY); at age 60 years, the ICER 
dropped to $42 712/QALY. SUV was more expensive but had better ICERs than LAV. 
At age 50, the ICER was $91 156/QALY, and it dropped to $19 300/QALY at age 60.
CONCLUSIONS: Vaccination with SUV was more cost-effective than LAV in all age 
groups studied. Vaccination with SUV at age 50 years appears cost-effective, 
with an ICER <$100 000/QALY.

In recent years, the accumulation of synthetic plastics has led to the 
development of a serious environmental problem. Nowadays, biodegradable films 
and coatings have been identified as a new approach to solve this problem by 
preparing renewable, abundant, low-cost materials. Gums are considered a large 
group of polysaccharides and polysaccharide derivatives that can easily form 
viscous solutions at low concentrations. Gums are mainly soluble in water and 
are composed of sugars like glucose, fructose, and mannose. These compounds are 
categorized into three groups: plant-origin gums, seaweed-based gums, and 
microbial gums. Microbial gums are listed as generally recognized as safe (GRAS) 
by the Food and Drug Administration and have a broad range of physicochemical 
properties suitable for various pharmacy, medicine, and food applications. In 
the food industry, they can be used as gelling, viscous, stabilizing, and 
thickening agents. Among the various materials that can potentially improve the 
properties of biodegradable packaging films, microbial gums such as gellan, 
xanthan, pullulan, bacterial cellulose, and curdlan have been the subject of 
numerous studies. These gums can be extruded into films and coatings with 
considerable barrier properties against the transport of moisture and oxygen. 
Microbial gums, due to their microbiological stability, adhesion, cohesion, 
wettability, solubility, transparency, and mechanical properties, can be used as 
edible films or coatings. Also, these gums can be applied in combination with 
bioactive compounds that induce the shelf-life extension of highly perishable 
products. This review focuses on the properties of films and coatings consisting 
of xanthan, curdlan, pullulan, gellan, and bacterial cellulose.

Association Between Subjective Well-being and Living Longer Without Disability 
or Illness.

Zaninotto P(1), Steptoe A(1).

London, United Kingdom.

IMPORTANCE: Subjective well-being is associated with reduced mortality, but it 
is not clear whether additional time is spent in good health or with chronic 
disease and disability.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the associations between affective well-being, total life 
expectancy, and life expectancy free of disability and chronic disease.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This survey study used data on 9761 
participants from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing who were followed up 
for a maximum of 10 years (mean [SD] follow-up, 6 [3.7] years). Discrete-time 
multistate life table models were used to estimate total life expectancy and 
life expectancy free of disability or chronic disease. Data were collected 
between March 2002 and March 2013 and analyzed from December 2018 to April 2019. 
Analyses were adjusted for wealth and cohabiting status.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The main outcome was life expectancy free of 
disability and chronic disease. Affective well-being was assessed at baseline as 
a combination of enjoyment of life and the lack of significant depressive 
symptoms. Disability was measured in terms of impaired activities of daily 
living and instrumental activities of daily living, and chronic disease as the 
occurrence of 6 serious illnesses.
RESULTS: Data were analyzed from 9761 participants (5297 [54%] female; mean [SD] 
age at baseline, 64 [9.9] years). High affective well-being was associated with 
longer life expectancy and with longer disability-free and chronic disease-free 
life expectancies. For example, a woman aged 50 years who reported high 
affective well-being could expect to live 6 years longer than a woman of similar 
age with low well-being; 31.4 of her remaining years (95% CI, 30.5-31.9 years) 
would be likely to be free of disability, compared with 20.8 years (95% CI, 
20.1-22.1 years) for a woman with low affective well-being. A man aged 50 years 
with high affective well-being could expect to live 20.8 years (95% CI, 
18.7-22.4 years) without chronic disease, compared with 11.4 years (95% CI, 
8.5-14.6 years) for a man reporting low well-being. Similar patterns were 
observed at the ages of 60, 70, and 80 years.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study suggests that people who report high 
levels of subjective well-being live longer and also healthier lives than those 
with lower well-being. These findings add weight to endeavors to promote the 
subjective well-being of older people.

BACKGROUND: Taenia solium cysticercosis is a public health and agricultural 
problem in many low and middle-income countries where health education, 
sanitation, pig management practices and meat inspection infrastructure are 
insufficient. Cysticercosis affects both human and animal health and has 
important economic consequences. Very few studies have been conducted to 
evaluate the monetary burden of cysticercosis. This study aimed at estimating 
the 2015 costs associated with cysticercosis in humans and pigs in Mexico.
METHODS: The monetary burden of human cysticercosis was estimated based on costs 
incurred by living with and treating epilepsy and severe chronic headaches 
associated with neurocysticercosis (NCC). The estimated cost of porcine 
cysticercosis took into consideration losses due to the reduction in the price 
of cysticercosis-infected animals. Epidemiologic and economic data were obtained 
from the published literature, government reports, and setting-specific 
questionnaires. Latin hypercube sampling methods were employed to sample the 
distributions of uncertain parameters and to estimate 95% credible regions (95% 
CRs). All results are reported in 2015 U.S.$.
FINDINGS: The overall monetary burden associated with NCC morbidity was 
estimated at U.S.$215,775,056 (95% CR U.S.$109,309,560 -U.S.$361,924,224), with 
U.S.$436 (95% CR: U.S.$296 -U.S.$604) lost per patient. If loss of future years 
of income and productivity due to NCC-associated deaths was included, this value 
increased by U.S.$54.26 million, assuming that these individuals earned Mexico's 
median wage salary. An additional U.S.$19,507,171 (95% CR U.S.$5,734,782 
-U.S.$35,913,487) was estimated to be lost due to porcine cysticercosis.
CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that T. solium cysticercosis results in 
considerable monetary losses to Mexico.

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is one of the most common genetic disorders among the White 
population. The disease has a progressive course and leads to a reduction in the 
quality of life and of life expectancy. Standard diagnostic procedures used in 
the monitoring of CF patients include methods which expose patients to ionizing 
radiation. With increasing life expectancy in CF the cumulative dose of ionising 
radiation increases, prompting clinicians' search for safer imaging studies. 
Despite its safety and availability lung ultrasound (LUS) is not routinely used 
in the diagnostic evaluation of CF patients. The aim of the study was to 
evaluate the diagnostic value of LUS in children with CF compared to a chest 
X-ray, and to assess the diagnostic value of the recently developed LUS 
score-CF-USS (Cystic Fibrosis Ultrasound Score). LUS was performed in 48 CF 
children and adolescents aged from 5 to 18 years (24 girls and 24 boys). LUS 
consisted of the assessment of the pleura, lung sliding, A-line and B-line 
artefacts, "lung rockets", alveolar consolidations, air bronchogram and pleural 
effusion. Chest radiography was performed in all patients and analyzed according 
to the modified Chrispin-Norman score. LUS was analyzed according to CF-USS. The 
correlation between the CF-USS and the modified Chrispin-Norman scores was 
moderate (R = 0.52, p = 0.0002) and strong in control studies. In 75% of 
patients undergoing LUS, small areas of subpleural consolidations were observed, 
which were not visible on x-rays. At the same time, LUS was not sensitive enough 
to visualize bronchial pathology, which plays an important role in assessing the 
progression of the disease. Conclusions: LUS constitutes an invaluable tool for 
the diagnosis of subpleural consolidations. CF-USS results correlate with the 
conventional x-ray modified Chrispin-Norman score. LUS should be considered a 
supplementary radiographic examination in the monitoring of CF patients, and 
CF-USS may provide clinicians with valuable information concerning the 
progression of the disease.

BACKGROUND: Childhood obesity is a serious public health challenge and schools 
have been identified as an ideal place to implement prevention interventions. 
The aim of this study was to measure the cost-effectiveness of a multi-faceted 
school-based obesity prevention intervention targeting children aged 6-7 years 
when compared to 'usual activities'.
METHODS: A cluster randomised controlled trial in 54 schools across the West 
Midlands (UK) was conducted. The 12-month intervention aimed to increase 
physical activity by 30 minutes per day and encourage healthy eating. Costs were 
captured from a public sector perspective and utility-based health related 
outcomes measured using the CHU-9D. Multiple imputation using chained equations 
was used to address missing data. The cost effectiveness was measured at 30 
months from baseline using a hierarchical net-benefit regression framework, that 
controlled for clustering and prespecified covariates. Any uncertainty in the 
results was characterised using cost-effectiveness acceptability curves.
RESULTS: At 30 months, the total adjusted incremental mean cost of the 
intervention was £155 (95% confidence interval [CI]: £139, £171), and the 
incremental mean QALYs gained was 0.006 (95% CI: -0.024, 0.036), per child. The 
incremental cost-effectiveness at 30 months was £26,815 per QALY and using a 
standard willingness to pay threshold of £30,000 per QALY, there was a 52% 
chance that the intervention was cost-effective.
CONCLUSIONS: The cost-effectiveness of the school-based WAVES intervention was 
subject to substantial uncertainty. We therefore recommend more research to 
explore obesity prevention within schools as part of a wider systems approach to 
obesity prevention.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: This paper uses data collected by the WAVES trial:

INTRODUCTION: Increased life expectancy results in a rapid increase of 
nonagenarian patients presenting with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) caused by 
large vessel occlusion (LVO). We conducted this study to assess the efficacy and 
safety of endovascular thrombectomy (ET) in this age group with use of 
imaging-based selection.
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed clinical and imaging data from 2 different 
comprehensive stroke centers and compared the outcomes of ET versus intravenous 
thrombolysis (IVT) alone among eligible nonagenarians with LVO in anterior 
circulation and evidence of salvageable tissue on brain magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI).
RESULTS: A total of 617 patients of AIS had been treated with IVT or ET, 
including 23 eligible nonagenarians. Among these, 9 patients were treated with 
IVT alone (IVT group) and 14 patients received ET group. Notably, the 
symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage rates were significantly lower after ET than 
after IVT (European-Australasian Acute Stroke Study II criteria, 0 vs. 33.3%; p 
= 0.047; National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke criteria, 7.1 
vs. 66.7%; p = 0.005). Moreover, although there were no statistically 
significant differences between the 2 groups on efficacy, ET tended to lead to 
greater early neurologic recovery at discharge (71.4 vs. 33.3%, p = 0.102) and 
improve functional outcome at 90 days (71.4 vs. 44.4%, p = 0.383), respectively.
CONCLUSION: By using MRI-based selection, ET in nonagenarians with AIS caused by 
LVO within anterior circulation was safe and may lead to improve early 
neurologic recovery and functional independence at 90 days, as compared with IVT 
alone. Randomized trial in larger sample size testing efficacy of ET using 
diffusion-weighted imaging-fluid attenuated inversion recovery mismatch 
selection in this age group appears feasible.

Cancer Personalized Medicine, Nanjing, China.

PURPOSE: Diabetes mellitus (DM) is associated with elevated cancer risk and poor 
survival outcome in malignancies. The objective of this study was to evaluate 
the prognostic value of preexisting DM in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Six hundred and thirty-three subjects with 
newly-diagnosed CLL between 2007 and 2016 were recruited. Propensity 
score-matched method was performed to balance baseline characteristics and 
eliminate possible bias. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses 
screened the independent risk indicators for time-to-first-treatment (TTFT) and 
cancer-specific survival (CSS) of CLL. Receiver operator characteristic curves 
and the corresponding areas under the curve assessed the predictive accuracy of 
CLL-International Prognostic Index (IPI) together with DM.
RESULTS: The results showed that 111 patients had pre-existing DM. In the 
propensity-matched cohort, DM was correlated with inferior TTFT and CSS in CLL 
patients, and it was an independent prognostic factor for both CSS and TTFT. 
Pre-diabetics also shared undesirable prognostic outcome compared with patients 
with no diabetic tendency, and a positive association between longer diabetic 
duration and poorer prognosis of CLL was identified. DM as one additional point 
to CLL-IPI had larger area under the curve compared with CLL-IPI alone in CSS 
prediction and could improve the prognostic capacity of CLL-IPI.
CONCLUSION: Pre-existing DM was found to be a valuable prognostic predictor and 
could help predict life expectancy and build refined prognostication models for 
CLL.

BACKGROUND: With life expectancy continuing to rise in the United Kingdom there 
is an increasing public health focus on the maintenance of physical independence 
among all older adults. Identifying interventions that improve physical outcomes 
in pre-frail and frail older adults is imperative.
METHODS: A systematic review of the literature 2000 to 2017 following PRISMA 
guidelines and registered with PROSPERO (no. CRD42016045325).
RESULTS: Ten RCT trials fulfilled selection criteria and quality appraisal. The 
study quality was moderate to good. Interventions included physical activity; 
nutrition, physical activity combined with nutrition. Interventions that 
incorporated one or more physical activity components significantly improved 
physical outcomes in pre-frail and/or frail older adults.
CONCLUSIONS: Physical activity interventions are key to maintaining independence 
in pre-frail and frail older adults. A lack of consensus regarding the 
definition of frailty, and an absence of core measures to assess this means any 
attempt to create an optimal intervention will be impeded. This absence may 
ultimately impact on the ability of older and frail adults to live well and for 
longer in the community.

OBJECTIVES: The cost-effectiveness of molecular pathology testing is highly 
context dependent. The field is fast-moving, and national health technology 
assessment may not be relevant or timely for local decision makers. This study 
illustrates a method of context-specific economic evaluation that can be carried 
out in a limited timescale without extensive resources.
METHODS: We established a multi-disciplinary group including an oncologist, 
pathologists and a health economist. We set out diagnostic and treatment 
pathways and costs using registry data, health technology assessments, 
guidelines, audit data, and estimates from the group. Sensitivity analysis 
varied input parameters across plausible ranges. The evaluation setting was the 
West of Scotland and UK NHS perspective was adopted. The evaluation was assessed 
against the AdHopHTA checklist for hospital-based health technology assessment.
RESULTS: A context-specific economic evaluation could be carried out on a timely 
basis using limited resources. The evaluation met all relevant criteria in the 
AdHopHTA checklist. Health outcomes were expected to be at least equal to the 
current strategy. Annual cost savings of £637,000 were estimated resulting 
primarily from a reduction in the proportion of patients receiving intravenous 
infusional chemotherapy regimens. The result was not sensitive to any parameter. 
The data driving the main cost saving came from a small clinical audit. We 
recommended this finding was confirmed in a larger population.
CONCLUSIONS: The method could be used to evaluate testing changes elsewhere. The 
results of the case study may be transferable to other jurisdictions where the 
organization of cancer services is fragmented.

The lysosome plays a crucial role in the regulation of longevity. Lysosomal 
degradation is tightly coupled with autophagy that is induced by many longevity 
paradigms and required for lifespan extension. The lysosome also serves as a hub 
for signal transduction and regulates longevity via affecting nuclear 
transcription. One lysosome-to-nucleus retrograde signaling pathway is mediated 
by a lysosome-associated fatty acid binding protein LBP-8 in Caenorhabditis 
elegans. LBP-8 shuttles lysosomal lipids into the nucleus to activate lipid 
regulated nuclear receptors NHR-49 and NHR-80 and consequently promote 
longevity. However, the structural basis of LBP-8 action remains unclear. Here, 
we determined the first 1.3 Å high-resolution structure of this life-extending 
protein LBP-8, which allowed us to identify a structurally conserved nuclear 
localization signal and amino acids involved in lipid binding. Additionally, we 
described the range of fatty acids LBP-8 is capable of binding and show that it 
binds to life-extending ligands in worms such as oleic acid and 
oleoylethanolamide with high affinity.

OBJECTIVES: Aortic valve (AV) insufficiency with normal root and ascending aorta 
is most frequently treated by valve replacement with significant 
prosthetic-related complications and reduced life expectancy. We compared the 
outcomes of a new standardized isolated AV repair approach using an external 
aortic annuloplasty ring at the subvalvular level (single ring annuloplasty) and 
the role of an additional supravalvular ring at the sinotubular junction (double 
ring annuloplasty).
METHODS: Single centre data were collected from the Aortic Valve Insufficiency 
and ascending aorta Aneurysm InternATiOnal Registry (AVIATOR) between 2003 and 
2017. A total of 93 patients (56 single ring and 37 double ring) underwent 
isolated AV repair.
RESULTS: The overall 30-day mortality rate and the need for a permanent 
pacemaker were 1% and 2%, respectively. The overall survival rate at 6 years was 
similar for sex- and age-matched members of the general population (89% vs 95%; 
P = 0.1) and did not differ between the double and single ring groups (82% vs 
93%; P = 0.4) at 6 years. There were no thromboembolic or bleeding events in the 
entire cohort. However, at 6 years, the cumulative incidence of valve-related 
reintervention was 26% in the single ring annuloplasty group compared to 3% in 
the double ring annuloplasty (P = 0.02) group. Similarly, at 6 years, the 
cumulative incidence of moderate-to-severe (>2) aortic insufficiency was 30% in 
the single ring annuloplasty group compared to 0% in the double ring 
annuloplasty group (P = 0.007).
CONCLUSIONS: Standardized AV repair with external ring annuloplasty has a 
survival rate similar to that of the general population. The additional 
stabilization of the sinotubular junction with a second supravalvular ring 
(double ring annuloplasty) is associated with better outcomes compared to single 
subvalvular annuloplasty. It can be considered as a first line intervention for 
patients with isolated aortic insufficiency and pliable leaflets.
