The morbidity and mortality of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a subject 
of intense relevance in the literature, yet descriptions of prolonged and 
sustained remissions or even cure are barely reported. In recent decades the 
life expectancy in SLE patients has improved, but the quality of life seems to 
be poor compared with other chronic diseases and with the general population. 
The immunopathogenesis of SLE is complex and not fully understood, so patients 
have been treated with nonspecific immunosuppressive therapies. But in recent 
years, because of advances in basic science, targeted therapies have been 
developed. Despite the progress made in treating SLE, currently a cure in SLE 
seems to be a myth. SLE it seems, remains incurable. A specific treatment has 
not emerged to directly abrogate a disease-specific autoimmune response. 
Relapsing manifestations and complications of treatment still remain important 
markers of morbidity.

OBJECTIVE: To examine the cost-effectiveness of Be Active Eat Well (BAEW), a 
large, multifaceted, community-based capacity-building demonstration program 
that promoted healthy eating and physical activity for Australian children aged 
4-12 years between 2003 and 2006.
DESIGN AND METHODS: A quasi-experimental, longitudinal design was used with 
anthropometric data collected at baseline (1001 children-intervention; 
1183-comparator) and follow-up. A societal perspective was employed, with 
intervention resource use measured retrospectively based on process evaluation 
reports, school newsletters, reports, and key stakeholder interviews, and valued 
in 2006 Australian dollars (AUD). Outcomes were measured as Body Mass Index 
(BMI) units saved and Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) averted over the 
predicted cohort lifetime, and reported as incremental cost-effectiveness ratios 
(with 95% uncertainty intervals).
RESULTS: The intervention cost AUD0.34M ($0.31M; $0.38M) annually, and resulted 
in savings of 547 (-104; 1209) BMI units and 10.2 (-0.19; 21.6) DALYs. This 
translated to modest cost offsets of AUD27 311 (-$1803; $58 242) and a net cost 
per DALY saved of AUD29 798 (dominated; $0.26M).
CONCLUSIONS: BAEW was affordable and cost-effective, and generated substantial 
spin-offs in terms of activity beyond funding levels. Elements fundamental to 
its success and any potential cost efficiencies associated with scaling-up now 
require identification.

The introduction of self-management in Type 2 Diabetes care: A narrative review.

Baghbanian A(1), Tol A.

University of Medical Sciences, Zahedan, Iran.

Type 2 diabetes is one of the most life-threatening public health challenges in 
the world. It causes a high disease burden including increased disability, 
reduced life expectancy and ever-increasing costs of care in almost every 
country. The growing burden of diabetes along with rapid cultural changes, aging 
population, increasing urbanization, changes in nutritional habits, reduced 
physical activity, and improper lifestyle and behavior patterns would inexorably 
drive increased health care costs and demands. Several models of education have 
been proposed to reduce the complications of chronic diseases including 
diabetes. However, it is widely known and acknowledged that adopting self-care 
and self-management behaviors play a fundamental role in diabetes control and 
treatment. A non-systematic (narrative) search strategy was used to collect 
necessary data. Several models of diabetes care such as compliance-based or 
curative models exist. Neither the curative model nor the compliance/adherence 
model is rigorously effective in diabetes care. The model of self-empowerment - 
based on the three fundamental aspects of chronic illness care: choices, 
control, and consequences - is much more applicable in the management of 
diabetes. This point to an approach which recognizes that patients are 
responsible for their diabetes care. Self-empowerment model has the potential to 
place diabetes care into context - a context which is based on active 
involvement of patients and informed, proactive healthcare professionals in the 
process of care.

Impact of influenza on health-related quality of life among confirmed (H1N1)2009 
patients.

Hollmann M(1), Garin O, Galante M, Ferrer M, Dominguez A, Alonso J.

d'Investigacions Mèdiques, Barcelona, Spain.

BACKGROUND: We aimed to assess the changes in health-related quality of life 
(HRQL) in patients with confirmed diagnosis of influenza (H1N1)2009, and to 
estimate the individual and societal loss of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) 
caused by the pandemic.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Longitudinal study of patients recruited at major hospitals 
and primary care centers in Spain. Patients reported their HRQL (EQ-5D) during 
their influenza episode and seven days prior to it. A subsample was monitored to 
evaluate HRQL after recovery. HRQL loss was estimated as the difference between 
EQ-5D prior to the influenza episode and during it. Individual QALY loss 
(disutility multiplied by the duration of the influenza episode in days) for 
confirmed cases was calculated and used to estimate the societal loss in Spain 
(with the official estimations). A total of 432 inpatients and 563 outpatients 
were included, of whom 145 and 184, respectively, were followed up. Baseline 
mean HRQL loss was 0.58 (95% CI, 0.53-0.63) for inpatients and 0.43 (95% CI, 
0.40-0.46) for outpatients. The majority of the 145 inpatients and 184 
outpatients who were followed up regained initial HRQL levels, presenting a mean 
difference of 0.01 between the EQ-5D score prior to and after the influenza 
episode. Individual QALY losses for inpatients (0.031, 95% CI, 0.025-0.037) were 
higher than for outpatients (0.009, 95% CI, 0.007-0.011), while societal QALY 
losses were reversed: 94 years for inpatients and 6,778 years for outpatients. 
For fatal cases (an official number of 318), we estimated a QALY loss of 11,981.
CONCLUSIONS: The influenza (H1N1)2009 pandemic had a significant but temporary 
impact on the HRQL of the majority of confirmed in- and outpatients. The 
societal impact of the influenza pandemic in Spain was estimated to be higher 
than other acute conditions. These results provide useful data for future 
cost-utility analyses.

Congenital erythropoietic porphyria (CEP), or Günther's disease, is an inborn 
error of metabolism produced by a deficiency of uroporphyrinogen III synthase 
(UROS), the fourth enzyme of the heme biosynthesis pathway. This enzymatic 
defect induces the accumulation of isomer I porphyrins in erythrocytes, skin, 
and tissues, producing various clinical manifestations. Severe cases are 
characterized by extreme photosensitivity, causing scarring and mutilations, and 
by hemolytic anemia, reducing life expectancy. CEP is caused by mutations in the 
UROS gene, and one of the most severe forms of the disease is associated with a 
cysteine to arginine substitution at residue 73 of the protein (C73R). CEP has 
been successfully treated only by the transplantation of hematopoietic 
precursors. We report the case of a male infant with severe postdelivery 
symptoms diagnosed with CEP and found to be homozygous for the C73R mutation. He 
underwent successful allogeneic bone marrow transplantation from a matched 
unrelated donor at 7 months of age. The hemolytic anemia was corrected and the 
porphyrin overproduction was significantly reduced. The patient remained 
asymptomatic after 1 year. This new case confirms that patients with severe CEP 
can benefit from early postnatal hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

Economic evaluation of a lifestyle intervention in primary care to prevent type 
2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular diseases: a randomized controlled trial.

van Wier MF, Lakerveld J, Bot SD, Chinapaw MJ, Nijpels G, van Tulder MW.

BACKGROUND: Cost-effectiveness studies of lifestyle interventions in people at 
risk for lifestyle-related diseases, addressing 'real-world' implementation, are 
needed. This study examines the cost-effectiveness of a primary care 
intervention from a societal perspective, compared with provision of health 
brochures, alongside a randomized controlled trial.
METHODS: Adults aged 30-50 years, at risk of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and/or 
cardiovascular disease (CVD), were recruited from twelve general practices in 
The Netherlands. They were randomized to the intervention (n = 314) or control 
group (n = 308). The intervention consisted of up to six face-to-face counseling 
sessions with a trained practice nurse, followed by three-monthly sessions by 
phone. Costs were collected using three-monthly retrospective questionnaires. 
Quality of life was measured with the EuroQol-5D-3L, at baseline, 6, 12 and 
24 months. Nine-year risk of developing T2DM and ten-year risk of CVD mortality 
were estimated using the ARIC and SCORE formulae, respectively, based on 
measurements at baseline and 24 months while applying a fixed age of 60 years at 
both time points.
RESULTS: Small, statistically non-significant differences in effects were found 
between the intervention and control group with regard to risk scores and 
Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) gained. The mean difference in costs between 
the intervention and control group was €-866 (95% confidence interval -2372; 
370). The probability that the intervention was cost-effective varied from 93% 
at €8000/QALY to 88% at €80,000/QALY.
CONCLUSION: A primary care lifestyle intervention aimed at adults at increased 
risk of T2DM and/or CVD could result in cost savings over a two-year period. 
However, due to methodological uncertainty no advice can be given regarding the 
implementation of the intervention in Dutch general practices.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The wrist is one of the most affected joints in 
rheumatoid arthritis. The purpose of this retrospective study was to assess 
clinical, functional and radiographic results of radio-lunate arthrodesis. Two 
different operation and fixation techniques are compared and detailed outcome 
after this intervention is presented.
METHODS: Twenty-seven patients with long-standing rheumatoid arthritis were 
operated on, either by stabilisation of the arthrodesis with Shapiro staples 
(n = 14) or by Herbert screw (n = 13) and followed for a mean of 5.4 years.
RESULTS: Radio-lunate arthrodesis resulted in high overall and subjective 
satisfaction concerning function, grip and return to work. Grip strength was 
35 kPa for the dominant and 26 kPa for the non-dominant hand. No revision, 
pseudoarthrosis or hardware failure was observed; only two conservatively 
treated wound healing problems were reported. The procedure resulted in a mean 
flexion of 26° and a mean extension of 24°; a clear improvement was also seen in 
activities of daily life. No difference between both groups was observed for 
pain, complication rate or functional outcome.
INTERPRETATION: Due to high patient satisfaction and functional outcome, 
radio-lunate wrist arthrodesis can be recommended independent of fixation 
method.

OBJECTIVES: Cochlear implantation (CI) has become the mainstay of treatment for 
children with severe-to-profound sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL). Yet, despite 
mounting evidence of the clinical benefits of early implantation, little data 
are available on the long-term societal benefits and comparative effectiveness 
of this procedure across various ages of implantation-a choice parameter for 
parents and clinicians with high prognostic value for clinical outcome. As such, 
the aim of the present study is to evaluate a model of the consequences of the 
timing of this intervention from a societal economic perspective. Average cost 
utility of pediatric CI by age at intervention will be analyzed.
DESIGN: Prospective, longitudinal assessment of health utility and educational 
placement outcomes in 175 children recruited from six U.S. centers between 
November 2002 and December 2004, who had severe-to-profound SNHL onset within 1 
year of age, underwent CI before 5 years of age, and had up to 6 years of 
postimplant follow-up that ended in November 2008 to December 2011. Costs of 
care were collected retrospectively and stratified by preoperative, operative, 
and postoperative expenditures. Incremental costs and benefits of implantation 
were compared among the three age groups and relative to a nonimplantation 
baseline.
RESULTS: Children implanted at <18 months of age gained an average of 10.7 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) over their projected lifetime as compared 
with 9.0 and 8.4 QALYs for those implanted between 18 and 36 months and at >36 
months of age, respectively. Medical and surgical complication rates were not 
significantly different among the three age groups. In addition, mean lifetime 
costs of implantation were similar among the three groups, at approximately 
$2000/child/year (77.5-year life expectancy), yielding costs of $14,996, 
$17,849, and $19,173 per QALY for the youngest, middle, and oldest implant age 
groups, respectively. Full mainstream classroom integration rate was 
significantly higher in the youngest group at 81% as compared with 57 and 63% 
for the middle and oldest groups, respectively (p < 0.05) after 6 years of 
follow-up. After incorporating lifetime educational cost savings, CI led to net 
societal savings of $31,252, $10,217, and $6,680 for the youngest, middle, and 
oldest groups at CI, respectively, over the child's projected lifetime.
CONCLUSIONS: Even without considering improvements in lifetime earnings, the 
overall cost-utility results indicate highly favorable ratios. Early (<18 
months) intervention with CI was associated with greater and longer 
quality-of-life improvements, similar direct costs of implantation, and 
economically valuable improved classroom placement, without a greater incidence 
of medical and surgical complications when compared to CI at older ages.

BACKGROUND: Patients with pain from advanced cancer often have limited life 
expectancy. Undergoing an epidural trial for placement of an intrathecal pump in 
these selected patients can exhaust limited days of life. We sought to analyze 
historical data at our cancer center to develop an algorithm to predict initial 
intrathecal pump dosing based on the starting preimplant systemic opioid 
regimen, thus averting an epidural trial and minimizing hospital stay.
METHODS: We used data pre- and postpump from 46 cancer patients receiving 
systemic opioids undergoing intrathecal pump placement in the last 6 years, all 
of whom had undergone an epidural trial before pump placement.
RESULTS: By analyzing intrathecal opioid dosage on discharge (in IV morphine 
equivalents) to age, type of pain, cancer type, preimplant opioid dose, and 
preimplant pain score using multiple regression, we created an algorithm that 
predicts, for cancer patients, an appropriate initial dose for an intrathecal 
pump based on the prepump systemic opioid dose, thus avoiding an epidural trial. 
The predicted value does have a broad 95% prediction interval (-122.7% to 
147.6%) pointing to the value of a trial when feasible.
CONCLUSIONS: When an epidural trial is not feasible and an intrathecal pump is 
required in a cancer patient, it is possible to predict an initial dose for the 
intrathecal pump based on the systemic opioid usage. This minimizes delays in 
achieving satisfactory analgesia and discharge to home.

This study assesses the effect of having informal support available at home on 
inpatient care use in Switzerland. The main contributions are to consider the 
availability of care regardless of its source, measured by multiple-adult living 
arrangements, and to examine this effect by type of inpatient care and source of 
potential support. A two-part model with region and time fixed effects is 
estimated to determine the impact of informal care availability on the 
likelihood of hospitalisation and length of stay, conditional on 
hospitalisation. The analysis is conducted on a sample of individuals aged 18+ 
from four waves of the Swiss Household Panel survey (2004-2007). Overall, 
availability of informal care has no impact on the likelihood of hospitalisation 
but does significantly reduce length of stay by 1.9 days. Available support has 
no effect on the shortest stays (up to 10 days), but has a significant impact on 
acute care stays up to 30 days and longer stays. Additionally, the effect does 
not significantly vary whether the source of informal support is a spouse only, 
a spouse and other adults, or other adults only. These results indicate that 
social changes leading to an expansion in the proportion of one-person 
households may increase future inpatient care use.

Canadians' support for radical life extension resulting from advances in 
regenerative medicine.

University Dr. N.W., Calgary, AB, Canada. ndragojl@ucalgary.ca

This paper explores Canadian public perceptions of a hypothetical scenario in 
which a radical increase in life expectancy results from advances in 
regenerative medicine. A national sample of 1231 adults completed an online 
questionnaire on stem cell research and regenerative medicine, including three 
items relating to the possibility of Canadians' average life expectancy 
increasing to 120 years by 2050. Overall, Canadians are strongly supportive of 
the prospect of extended lifespans, with 59% of the sample indicating a desire 
to live to 120 if scientific advances made it possible, and 47% of respondents 
agreeing that such increases in life expectancy are possible by 2050. The 
strongest predictors of support for radical life extension are individuals' 
general orientation towards science and technology and their evaluation of its 
plausibility. These results contrast with previous research, which has suggested 
public ambivalence for biomedical life extension, and point to the need for more 
research in this area. They suggest, moreover, that efforts to increase public 
awareness about anti-aging research are likely to increase support for the 
life-extending consequences of that research program.

Turkey.

OBJECTIVE: The present study aimed to evaluate the effects of Pilates exercise 
program on pain, functional status and quality of life in women with 
postmenopausal osteoporosis.
DESIGN: The study was performed as a randomized, prospective, controlled and 
single-blind trial. PARTICIPATIONS: Seventy women (age range, 45-65 years) with 
the diagnosis of postmenopausal osteoporosis were included.
METHODS AND INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomly allocated into two groups 
(home and Pilates exercise groups). Patients in the Pilates exercise group 
underwent a supervised Pilates exercise program twice a week for one year. 
Patients in the home exercise group were asked to perform a home exercise 
program consisting of thoracic extension exercises. Patients were evaluated at 
baseline and after one year of participation in the exercise programs.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Visual Analog Scale for pain, six-minute walking and 
sit-to-stand tests for functional status, and the Qualeffo-41 Questionnaire and 
the Short Form-36 (SF-36) for quality of life. Patients were also asked to 
report the number of falls during the intervention.
RESULTS: At the end of the study, the results of 60 patients were analyzed. A 
significant improvement was noted in all evaluation parameters at the end of the 
exercise program in the Pilates exercise group. Except for Qualeffo- Leisure 
Time Activities, SF-36 physical role limitation and emotional role limitation 
subscales, a significant improvement was noted in all other evaluation 
parameters at the end of the exercise program in the home exercise group. 
Improvement was significantly greater in the Pilates exercise group compared to 
the home exercise group in all parameters.
CONCLUSION: Pilates exercises may be a safe and an effective treatment 
alternative for the quality of life in patients with postmenopausal 
osteoporosis.

BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy and safety of pancreatin 
(pancrelipase) enteric-coated minimicrospheres (MMS) over a one-year period in 
patients with pancreatic exocrine insufficiency (PEI) due to chronic 
pancreatitis (CP).
METHODS: This was a 51-week, open-label extension (OLE) of a one-week, 
multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial in India that 
enrolled patients ≥18 years of age with confirmed PEI due to CP. Patients 
received pancreatin (Creon(®) 40000 MMS™) at a dose of 80,000 Ph. Eur. lipase 
units with each of three main meals/day and 40,000 with each of up to three 
snacks/day.
RESULTS: Of 61 patients entering the OLE, 48 completed treatment (nine were lost 
to follow up, two withdrew consent, one discontinued due to adverse event [acute 
exacerbation of CP], one protocol violation). There were significant 
improvements from baseline to end of OLE in mean ± SD coefficient of fat 
absorption (CFA: 22.7 ± 12.2%), coefficient of nitrogen absorption (CNA: 6.5 ± 
7.9%), body weight (4.9 ± 4.9 kg), BMI (1.9 ± 1.9 kg/m(2)), and most nutritional 
laboratory parameters tested (p ≤ 0.001). Mean daily stool frequency was reduced 
from 2.8 to 1.6 (p < 0.001). Improvements in clinical symptoms, clinical global 
impression of disease symptoms, and quality of life were also observed. 
Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were observed in 64% of patients 
overall. Only 13% of patients experienced TEAEs judged treatment related.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with PEI due to CP, treatment with pancreatin for one 
year was associated with significant improvements in fat absorption, nitrogen 
absorption, and nutritional parameters, improvements in clinical symptoms, and a 
favorable safety and tolerability profile.

Osteoporosis is a polygenetic, environmentally modifiable disease, which 
precipitates into fragility fractures of vertebrae, hip and radius and also 
confers a high risk of fractures in accidents and trauma. Aging and the genetic 
molecular background of osteoporosis cause delayed healing and impair 
regeneration. The worldwide burden of disease is huge and steadily increasing 
while the average life expectancy is also on the rise. The clinical need for 
bone regeneration applications, systemic or in situ guided bone regeneration and 
bone tissue engineering, will increase and become a challenge for health care 
systems. Apart from in situ guided tissue regeneration classical ex vivo tissue 
engineering of bone has not yet reached the level of routine clinical 
application although a wealth of scaffolds and growth factors has been 
developed. Engineering of complex bone constructs in vitro requires scaffolds, 
growth and differentiation factors, precursor cells for angiogenesis and 
osteogenesis and suitable bioreactors in various combinations. The development 
of applications for ex vivo tissue engineering of bone faces technical 
challenges concerning rapid vascularization for the survival of constructs in 
vivo. Recent new ideas and developments in the fields of bone biology, materials 
science and bioreactor technology will enable us to develop standard operating 
procedures for ex vivo tissue engineering of bone in the near future. Once 
prototyped such applications will rapidly be tailored for compromised conditions 
like vitamin D and sex hormone deficiencies, cellular deficits and high 
production of regeneration inhibitors, as they are prevalent in osteoporosis and 
in higher age.

Ceramide in cystic fibrosis.

Grassmé H(1), Riethmüller J, Gulbins E.

Germany.

Cystic fibrosis is caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane 
conductance regulator (CFTR) molecule; these mutations result in a defect in 
chloride secretion in epithelial cell layers. The disease is characterized by 
severe gastrointestinal and pulmonary symptoms, but it is the pulmonary symptoms 
that dominate the clinical course of the disease and determine patients' life 
expectancy. These pulmonary symptoms include reduced mucociliary clearance, 
chronic inflammation, and recurrent and chronic pulmonary infections with 
Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Burkholderia cepacia, and 
Haemophilus influenzae. Recent studies have shown that sphingolipids, especially 
ceramide, play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of cystic fibrosis. These 
studies have demonstrated that ceramide accumulates in the lungs of cystic 
fibrosis patients and mice, causing inflammation and high susceptibility to 
bacterial infections. The results of initial clinical studies suggest that 
interfering with sphingolipids may be a novel treatment strategy for cystic 
fibrosis.

This article presents a history of the study of motivation from approximately 
1900-1975, focusing on achievement strivings and containing little-known and 
often surprising facts about the main contributors to this field. Four theorists 
are highlighted: David McClelland, Kurt Lewin, John Atkinson, and Fritz Heider, 
each associated with a different theoretical approach (respectively and in order 
of historical emergence: trait, Gestalt, expectancy/value, and attribution 
theory). A fifth conception, drive theory, is also represented. In addition, a 
number of individuals who influenced these theorists and others who followed 
them are discussed. The article emphasizes the interrelations between the 
theorists and the interaction between personal and scientific life.

PURPOSE: To measure quality of life (QOL) and utilities for prostate cancer (PC) 
patients and determine their predictors.
METHODS: A population-based, community-dwelling, geographically diverse sample 
of long-term PC survivors in Ontario, Canada, was identified from the Ontario 
Cancer Registry and contacted through their referring physician. Consenting 
patients completed questionnaires by mail: Health Utilities Index (HUI 2/3), 
Patient Oriented Prostate Utility Scale PORPUS-U (utility), PORPUS-P (health 
profile), Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Prostate (FACT-P), and 
Prostate Cancer Index (PCI). Clinical data were obtained from chart reviews. 
Regression models determined the effects of a series of variables on QOL and 
utility.
RESULTS: We received questionnaires and reviewed charts for 585 patients (mean 
age 72.6, 2-13 years postdiagnosis). Mean utility scores were as follows: 
PORPUS-U = 0.92, HUI2 = 0.85, and HUI3 = 0.78. Mean health profile scores were 
as follows: PORPUS-P = 71.7, PCI sexual, urinary, and bowel function = 23.7, 
79.1, and 84.6, respectively (0 = worst, 100 = best), and FACT-P = 125.1 
(0 = worst, 156 = best). In multiple regression analyses, comorbidity and PCI 
urinary, sexual, and bowel function were significant predictors of other QOL 
measures. With all variables, 32-50 % of the variance in utilities was 
explained.
CONCLUSIONS: Many variables affect global QOL of PC survivors; only prostate 
symptoms and comorbidity have independent effects. Our model allows estimation 
of the effects of multiple factors on utilities. These utilities for long-term 
outcomes of PC and its treatment are valuable for decision/cost-effectiveness 
models of PC treatment.

Deriving time discounting correction factors for TTO tariffs.

Attema AE(1), Brouwer WB.

Author information:

The Time Trade-off (TTO) method is a popular method for valuing health state 
utilities and is frequently used in economic evaluations. However, this method 
produces utilities that are distorted by several biases. One important bias 
entails the failure to incorporate time discounting. This paper aims to measure 
time discounting for health outcomes in a sample representative for the general 
population. In particular, we estimate TTO scores alongside time discounting in 
order to derive a set of correction factors that can be employed to correct raw 
TTO scores for the downward bias caused by time discounting. We find substantial 
positive correction factors, which are increasing with the severity of the 
health state. Furthermore, higher discounting is found when using more severe 
health states in the discounting elicitation task. More research is needed to 
further develop discount rate elicitation procedures and test their validity, 
especially in general public samples. Moreover, future research should 
investigate the correction of TTO values for other biases as well, such as loss 
aversion, and to develop a criterion to test the external validity of TTO 
scores.

Lethality of reduced-risk insecticides against plum curculio (Coleoptera: 
Curculionidae) in blueberries, with emphasis on their curative activity.

Rutgers University, Chatsworth, NJ, USA.

BACKGROUND: Historically, management of plum curculio, Conotrachelus nenuphar 
(Herbst), in highbush blueberries has focused on post-bloom broad-spectrum 
insecticide applications targeting the adults. Here, the efficacy of different 
classes of insecticides against various stages of C. nenuphar was compared, and 
a prebloom treatment with the chitin synthesis inhibitor novaluron in 
combination with a post-bloom insecticide application was tested.
RESULTS: Novaluron decreased the number of oviposition scars and eggs on fruit 
and reduced larval emergence by >60% when applied prebloom. Post-bloom 
applications of the oxadiazine indoxacarb and the organophosphate phosmet, but 
not the neonicotinoid acetamiprid, showed significant adulticidal activity. The 
neonicotinoids acetamiprid and thiamethoxam and phosmet showed significant 
curative activity on C. nenuphar larvae when applied topically to infested 
fruit, whereas the pyrethroid fenpropathrin, indoxacarb and novaluron were 
weaker curative agents. Residue profiles showed that acetamiprid and phosmet 
residues had the highest levels while fenpropathrin and novaluron had the lowest 
levels of fruit penetration.
CONCLUSIONS: In blueberries, novaluron showed anti-ovipositional/ovicidal 
activity, indoxacarb and phosmet showed adulticidal activity, while the 
neonicotinoids and phosmet showed best curative (larvicidal) control on C. 
nenuphar. A prebloom novaluron application in combination with a post-bloom 
treatment with an adulticidal/larvicidal insecticide is recommended for optimal 
multi-life-stage management of C. nenuphar. © 2013 Society of Chemical Industry.

The corpulent phenotype-how the brain maximizes survival in stressful 
environments.

Diabetes, University of Luebeck Luebeck, Germany.

The reactivity of the stress system may change during the life course. In 
many-but not all-humans the stress reactivity decreases, once the individual is 
chronically exposed to a stressful and unsafe environment (e.g., poverty, work 
with high demands, unhappy martial relationship). Such an adaptation is referred 
to as habituation. Stress habituation allows alleviating the burden of chronic 
stress, particularly cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Interestingly, two 
recent experiments demonstrated low stress reactivity during a mental or 
psychosocial challenge in subjects with a high body mass. In this focused review 
we attempt to integrate these experimental findings in a larger context. Are 
these data compatible with data sets showing a prolonged life expectancy in 
corpulent people? From the perspective of neuroenergetics, we here raise the 
question whether "obesity" is unhealthy at all. Is the corpulent phenotype 
possibly the result of "adaptive phenotypic plasticity" allowing optimized 
survival in stressful environments?

Obesity is a relatively new and serious world-wide epidemic. Obesity is a 
stronger predictor in mortality than either poverty or smoking, and obesity is 
also now more prevalent than malnutrition. The prevalence of obesity continues 
to increase, ironically, the rate of increase of obesity is highest amongst the 
morbidly obesity. Obesity is the result of many factors resulting in concert, 
including poor dietary habits, reduced physical activity and genetic 
predisposition. With the rapid increase in obesity there has been a pronounced 
increase in obesity-related metabolic disorders including type 2 diabetes, 
hyperlipidemia, hypertension and many others. These co-morbidities are 
responsible for more than 2.5 million deaths, worldwide. The loss of life 
expectancy due to obesity is profound. In comparison to a normal weight 
individual Caucasian, a 25-year-old morbidly obese man has a 22% reduction in 
the expected remaining life span, representing an approximate loss of 12 years 
of life.

Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1.

Thakker RV(1).

Author information:

and Metabolism, University of Oxford, Headington, Oxford, OX3 7LJ, UK.

Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) is characterized by the occurrence of 
parathyroid, pancreatic islet and anterior pituitary tumors. Some patients may 
also develop carcinoid tumors, adrenocortical tumors, facial angiofibromas, 
collagenomas, and lipomas. MEN1 is an autosomal-dominant disorder, due to 
mutations in the tumor suppressor gene MEN1, which encodes a 610 amino acid 
protein, menin. Thus, the finding of MEN1 in a patient has important 
implications for family members because first-degree relatives have a 50% risk 
of developing the disease and can often be identified by MEN1 mutational 
analysis. Patients with MEN1 have a decreased life-expectancy and the outcomes 
of current treatments, which are generally similar to that for the respective 
tumors occurring in non-MEN1 patients, are not as successful because of multiple 
tumors, which may be larger, more aggressive, and resistant to treatment, and 
the concurrence of metastases. The prognosis for MEN1 patients might be improved 
by pre-symptomatic tumor detection and undertaking treatment specific for 
MEN1-tumors. Thus, it is recommended that MEN1 patients and their families 
should be cared for by multi-disciplinary teams comprising relevant specialists 
with experience in the diagnosis and treatment of patients with endocrine 
tumors.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the cost-effective operative strategy for coronary 
artery bypass surgery in patients above 70 years.
DESIGN: Randomized, controlled trial of 900 patients above 70 years of age 
subjected to coronary artery bypass surgery. Patients were randomized to either 
on-pump or off-pump coronary artery bypass surgery. Data on direct and indirect 
costs were prospectively collected. Preoperatively and six months 
postoperatively, quality of life was assessed using EuroQol-5D questionnaires. 
Perioperative in-hospital costs and costs of re-intervention were included.
RESULTS: The Summary Score of EuroQol-5D increased in both groups between 
preoperatively and postoperatively. In the on-pump group, it increased from 0.75 
(0.16) (mean (SD)) to 0.84 (0.17), while the increase in the off-pump group was 
from 0.75 (0.15) to 0.84 (0.18). The difference between the groups was 0.0016 
QALY and not significantly different. The mean costs were 148.940 D.Kr (CI, 
130.623 D.Kr-167.252 D.Kr) for an on-pump patient and 138.693 D.Kr (CI, 123.167 
D.Kr-154.220 D.Kr) for an off-pump patient. The ICER base-case point estimate 
was 6,829,999 D.Kr/QALY. The cost-effectiveness acceptability curve showed 89% 
probability of off-pump being cost-effective at a threshold value of 269,400 
D.Kr/QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: Off-pump surgery tends to be more cost-effective than on-pump 
surgery. Long-term comparisons are warranted.

The availability of new topical preparations for the treatment of left sided 
ulcerative colitis offers a therapy optimization for many patients. Rectal 
application of steroids and 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) is associated with 
fewer side effects and has a higher therapeutic efficacy in left-sided colitis 
as compared to a systemic therapy. Therefore, we were interested in the use of 
topical therapy in patients with ulcerative colitis. The key question was 
whether topical treatment is more frequently used than oral therapy in patients 
with proctitis and left sided colitis. Data of 800 patients of the Swiss IBD 
cohort study were analyzed. Sixteen percent of patients of the cohort had 
proctitis, 21% proctosigmoiditis and 41% pancolitis. Topical therapy with 5-ASA 
or corticosteroids was given in 26% of patients with proctitis, a combined 
systemic and topical treatment was given in 13%, whereas systemic treatment with 
5-ASA without topical treatment was given in 29%. Proportion of topical drug use 
decreased with respect to disease extension from 39% for proctitis to 13.1% for 
pancolitis (P=0.001). Patients with severe colitis received a significantly 
higher dose of topical 5-ASA than patients in remission. Side effects of topical 
or systemic 5-ASA or budesonide treatment were less frequently seen compared to 
other medications. Topical treatment was frequently stopped over time. The 
quality of life was the same in patients with limited disease compared to 
patients with pancolitis. Topical treatment in proctitis patients was underused 
in Switzerland. Since topical treatment is safe and effective it should be used 
to a larger extend.
