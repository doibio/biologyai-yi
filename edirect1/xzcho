according to the ECOG scale.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective, descriptive and observational study 
conducted between March 1, 2013 and June 30, 2015. Thirty-two patients were 
studied with a diagnosis of metastatic bone disease and who had undergone some 
type of orthopaedic surgical treatment for pathological fracture or impending 
fracture.
RESULTS: 28 cases (87.5%) presented pathological fracture and 4 cases (12.5%) 
impending fracture according to the Mirels score. Fifteen cases (46.875%) were 
treated by placing a central medullary nail + spacer in the long bone diaphysis, 
15 cases (46.875%) with modular arthroplasties and 2 patients (6.25%) with 
forequarter amputation. Eleven patients (34.375%) died during the course of this 
study, all with a Katagiri greater than or equal to 4.
DISCUSSION: The presence of a fracture in previously damaged territory is a 
catastrophic complication for most cancer patients. A clear understanding of the 
life expectancy of patients with bone metastases is of great help to prevent 
errors and failures in treatment.

Sperm malformation is one of the main reasons for male infertility, but the 
precise mechanisms of this process remain undiscovered. The major process of 
spermiogenesis is sperm head shaping. Cytoskeleton is a crucial unit in this 
process, as the acroplaxome and manchette are two kinds of momentous structures 
cooperated with various functional proteins to insure the formation of acrosome 
and nucleus. One is primarily formed by filamentous actin (F-actin) and 
responsible for transverse acrosome extension and concentration, another plays 
as the mainstay of nuclear deformation through circular arrangement of 
microtubules (MTs). We suspect that the acroplaxome alone cannot maintain such a 
spatial framework of the acrosome. Previous studies have also revealed that a 
nucleus without acrosome could not induce the formation of ectoplasmic 
specialization. In this review, we integrated most of the key proteins that have 
been proven to participate in the essential developmental steps of post-meiosis. 
We also propose that the ambient MTs of the acrosome might be emanated from the 
Golgi apparatus. They form a novel cytoskeleton termed acroframosome (AFS) to 
transport vesicles and proteins during acrosome biogenesis. The hypothesis of 
the acroframosome-acroplaxome-manchette (AAM) cytoskeletal system is likely to 
be the axis of head-to-tail spermiogenesis.

The fruit of Chinese jujube (Ziziphus jujuba Mill.) is immensely popular 
worldwide, while its fleshy fruit has a very short shelf life and suffers 
serious postharvest damage. The fruit has been controversially classified as 
non-climacteric, though the mechanisms underlying its ripening behavior, 
particularly the role of ethylene, have remained unclear. In this study, low and 
stable ethylene production was detected during ripening of Z. jujuba 'Dongzao' 
fruit, with production increasing at the full maturity stage. To determine 
potential ripening behavior, the fruit of five cultivars were harvested at the 
white mature stage, and all exhibited a first decreasing and then moderately 
increasing respiration rate without concomitant climacteric-like ethylene 
production during shelf storage. Treatment with 1.0 μL L-1 1-methylcyclopropene 
(1-MCP) inhibited respiration and ethylene production in white mature fruit, 
though the effects of 100 μL L-1 exogenous ethylene were not significant. The 
transcript levels of genes involved in ethylene biosynthesis, perception, and 
signal transduction were not elevated during fruit-ripening onset but 
substantially increased at the full-red ripening stage. Moreover, expression of 
genes controlling ethylene biosynthesis and perception mainly occurred in an 
auto-inhibited System-1-like manner, but signaling pathway genes were minimally 
affected by exogenous ethylene or 1-MCP. These results show that the ripening of 
Chinese jujube is non-climacteric. The basal level of ethylene likely plays a 
minor role in ripening regulation but is necessary to maintain normal ripening. 
This study elucidates the effects of ethylene on jujube fruit ripening, 
characterizing the ripening of this fruit as non-climacteric, and also provides 
strategies for the improvement and maintenance of fruit quality and the 
extension of shelf life during postharvest storage.

Should Primary Prevention ICDs Still Be Placed in Patients with Non-ischemic 
Cardiomyopathy? A Review of the Evidence.

St., Boston, MA, 02114, USA. kheist@partners.org.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Recent evidence has suggested that implantable defibrillator 
(ICD) in non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (NICM) may not offer mortality benefit in 
the presence of guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) and cardiac 
resynchronization therapy (CRT).
RECENT FINDINGS: Despite significant benefits of GDMT and CRT, current evidence 
is derived from ICD trials that rely predominantly on reduced left ventricular 
ejection fraction alone (LVEF). The majority of patients with sudden cardiac 
death (SCD) have LVEF > 30% indicating that LVEF by itself is an inadequate 
predictor of SCD. The Danish study to assess the efficacy of ICD in patients 
with non-ischemic systolic heart failure on mortality (DANISH) highlights the 
importance of better risk stratifying NICM patients for ICD implantation. 
Assessment of life expectancy, comorbidities, presence of advanced heart 
failure, etiology of NICM, and the presence of myocardial fibrosis can help risk 
stratify ICD beyond LVEF. Genetics and biomarkers can be of further assistance 
in risk stratification.

BACKGROUND: Specific immunotherapy is the only causal treatment in respiratory 
allergy. Due to high treatment cost and possible severe side effects 
subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) is not indicated in all patients. 
Nevertheless, reported treatment rates seem to be low. This study aims to 
analyze the effects of increasing treatment rates of SCIT in respiratory allergy 
in terms of costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs).
METHODS: A state-transition Markov model simulates the course of disease of 
patients with allergic rhinitis, allergic asthma and both diseases over 10 years 
including a symptom-free state and death. Treatment comprises symptomatic 
pharmacotherapy alone or combined with SCIT. The model compares two strategies 
of increased and status quo treatment rates. Transition probabilities are based 
on routine data. Costs are calculated from the societal perspective applying 
German unit costs to literature-derived resource consumption. QALYs are 
determined by translating the mean change in non-preference-based quality of 
life scores to a change in utility. Key parameters are subjected to 
deterministic sensitivity analyses.
RESULTS: Increasing treatment rates is a cost-effective strategy with an 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of 3484€/QALY compared to the status 
quo. The most influential parameters are SCIT discontinuation rates, treatment 
effects on the transition probabilities and cost of SCIT. Across all parameter 
variations, the best case leads to dominance of increased treatment rates while 
the worst case ICER is 34,315€/QALY. Excluding indirect cost leads to a twofold 
increase in the ICER.
CONCLUSIONS: Measures to increase SCIT initiation rates should be implemented 
and also address improving adherence.

PURPOSE: Composite disease burden measures such as disability-adjusted 
life-years (DALY) have been widely used to quantify the population-level health 
impact of disease or injury, but application has been limited for the estimation 
of the burden of adverse events following immunization. Our objective was to 
assess the feasibility of adapting the DALY approach for estimating adverse 
event burden.
METHODS: We developed a practical methodological framework, explicitly 
describing all steps involved: acquisition of relative or absolute risks and 
background event incidence rates, selection of disability weights and durations, 
and computation of the years lived with disability (YLD) measure, with 
appropriate estimation of uncertainty. We present a worked example, in which YLD 
is computed for 3 recognized adverse reactions following 3 childhood vaccination 
types, based on background incidence rates and relative/absolute risks retrieved 
from the literature.
RESULTS: YLD provided extra insight into the health impact of an adverse event 
over presentation of incidence rates only, as severity and duration are 
additionally incorporated. As well as providing guidance for the deployment of 
DALY methodology in the context of adverse events associated with vaccination, 
we also identified where data limitations potentially occur.
CONCLUSIONS: Burden of disease methodology can be applied to estimate the health 
burden of adverse events following vaccination in a systematic way. As with all 
burden of disease studies, interpretation of the estimates must consider the 
quality and accuracy of the data sources contributing to the DALY computation.

BACKGROUND: Pompe disease is a rare metabolic disorder caused by a deficiency of 
the lysosomal enzyme acid α-glucosidase. Glycogen accumulation damages skeletal, 
cardiac, and smooth muscles, causing a progressive and debilitating muscle 
weakness and cardiomyopathy. As life expectancy has much improved since the 
introduction of enzyme replacement therapy an increasing number of patients are 
referred for surgical procedures. Due to the potential cardiopulmonary 
complications, these patients form a high-risk group for the anesthesiologist.
AIMS: In this study, we investigated the incidence of perioperative 
complications in children with Pompe disease treated in our hospital since the 
introduction of enzyme replacement therapy.
METHODS: Anesthetic and perioperative data of children with Pompe disease 
treated between 1999 and 2015 in the Erasmus MC-Sophia Children's Hospital, 
University Medical Centre, Rotterdam, The Netherlands, were collected, 
retrospectively.
RESULTS: Of the 65 children with Pompe disease, 34 patients underwent in total 
77, mostly low-risk, surgical procedures. Twenty-one children had the classic 
infantile form and 13 had a nonclassic presentation of Pompe disease. In 13 
(16.8%) procedures, 1 or more perioperative complications occurred. 
Perioperative desaturation was the main complication (12.9%), followed by 
arrhythmia (3.8%) and heart failure requiring diuretic treatment (2.6%). One 
child died 2 days postoperatively, but this was considered unrelated to the 
procedure.
CONCLUSION: Despite the potentially high anesthetic risk for children with Pompe 
disease under enzyme replacement therapy, the incidence of perioperative 
complications in our study was relatively low. Our data suggest that with proper 
precautionary measures and a critical choice of timing of the operation, general 
anesthesia in children with Pompe disease could be relatively safe nowadays.

Dietary restriction is arguably the most promising nonpharmacological 
intervention to extend human life and health span. Yet, only few genetic 
regulators mediating the cellular response to dietary restriction are known, and 
the question remains which other regulatory factors are involved. Here, we 
measured at the genomewide level the chronological lifespan of Saccharomyces 
cerevisiae gene deletion strains under two nitrogen source regimens, glutamine 
(nonrestricted) and γ-aminobutyric acid (restricted). We identified 473 mutants 
with diminished or enhanced extension of lifespan. Functional analysis of such 
dietary restriction genes revealed novel processes underlying longevity by the 
nitrogen source quality, which also allowed us to generate a prioritized 
catalogue of transcription factors orchestrating the dietary restriction 
response. Importantly, deletions of transcription factors Msn2, Msn4, Snf6, 
Tec1, and Ste12 resulted in diminished lifespan extension and defects in cell 
cycle arrest upon nutrient starvation, suggesting that regulation of the cell 
cycle is a major mechanism of chronological longevity. We further show that 
STE12 overexpression is enough to extend lifespan, linking the 
pheromone/invasive growth pathway with cell survivorship. Our global picture of 
the genetic players of longevity by dietary restriction highlights intricate 
regulatory cross-talks in aging cells.

OBJECTIVE: Screening mammography is associated with reduced breast 
cancer-specific mortality; however, among older women, evidence suggests that 
the potential harms of screening may outweigh the benefits. We used a 
qualitative approach to examine the willingness of older women from different 
racial/ethnic groups to discontinue breast cancer screening.
METHODS: Women ≥70 years of age who reported having a screening mammogram in the 
past 3 years and/or reported that they intended to continue screening in the 
future were recruited for in-depth interviews. Participants who intended to 
continue screening were asked to describe how the following hypothetical 
scenarios would impact a decision to discontinue screening: health concerns or 
limited life expectancy, a physician's recommendation to discontinue, reluctance 
to undergo treatment, and recommendations from experts or governmental panels to 
stop screening. Semi-structured, face-to-face interviews were audio-recorded. 
Data coding and analysis followed inductive and deductive approaches.
RESULTS: Regardless of the scenario, participants (n = 29) expressed a strong 
intention to continue screening. Based on the hypothetical physician 
recommendations, intentions to continue screening appeared to remain strong. 
They did not envision a change in their health status that would lead them to 
discontinue screening and were skeptical of expert/government recommendations. 
There were no differences observed according to age, race/ethnicity, or 
education.
CONCLUSIONS: Among older women who planned to continue screening, intentions to 
continue breast cancer screening appear to be highly resilient and resistant to 
recommendations from physicians or expert/government panels.

BACKGROUND: Immune-modulating drugs have recently been introduced to the 
second-line setting of advanced bladder cancer. Pembrolizumab increases overall 
survival and is associated with less toxicity compared with chemotherapy in this 
setting based on the Keynote 045 study. The high cost of immunotherapy 
necessitates an assessment of its value by considering both efficacy and cost.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of pembrolizumab for the 
second-line treatment of advanced bladder cancer from the perspective of payers 
in multiple countries.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We developed a Markov model to compare the 
cost and effectiveness of pembrolizumab with those of chemotherapy in the 
second-line treatment of advanced bladder cancer based on the Keynote 045 study. 
Drug costs were acquired for the United States (US), United Kingdom (UK), 
Canada, and Australia. All costs were converted from local currency to US 
dollars at the exchange rates in September 2017.
OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Health outcomes were measured in 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs).
RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Pembrolizumab generated a gain of 0.36-0.37 QALYs 
compared with chemotherapy. Our analysis established the following incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for pembrolizumab versus chemotherapy in 
second-line advanced bladder cancer treatment: US $122 557/QALY; UK $91 
995/QALY; Canada $90 099/QALY; and Australia $99 966/QALY. The 
willingness-to-pay (WTP) thresholds per QALY are considered to be around 100 
000-150 000 US dollars for the US, 20 000-50 000 pounds for the UK (US$25 000-65 
000), 20 000-100 000 CAD for Canada (US$16 000-80 000), and 40 000-75 000 AUD 
for Australia (US$32 000-60 000).
CONCLUSIONS: Cost-effectiveness and WTP thresholds vary between countries. 
Compared with the other countries examined, US drug prices were found to be the 
highest, leading to the highest ICER. With standard WTP thresholds, 
pembrolizumab may be considered cost-effective in the US but not in the other 
countries examined.
PATIENT SUMMARY: This article assessed the cost-effectiveness of pembrolizumab 
for the treatment of patients with metastatic bladder cancer who had previously 
failed one treatment regimen. It would cost $122 557 in the United States, $91 
995 in the United Kingdom, $90 099 in Canada, and $99 966 in Australia to gain 
one quality-adjusted life-year with pembrolizumab versus chemotherapy in these 
patients, which may be considered cost-effective only in the United States 
because of the differences in willingness-to-pay thresholds.

PURPOSE: Residential exposure to radon is considered as the second leading cause 
of lung cancer after smoking. The purpose of this study was to conduct a 
cost-effectiveness analysis of reducing the indoor radon levels in Sweden from 
the current reference level of 200 Bq/m3 to the WHO suggested reference level of 
maximum 100 Bq/m3.
METHODS: We constructed a decision-analytic cost-effectiveness model using input 
data from published literature and administrative records. The model compared 
the increase in economic costs to the health benefits of lower indoor 
radon-levels in a Swedish policy context. We estimated the cost per life-year 
and quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained and assessed the robustness of the 
results using both deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analysis.
RESULTS: Including (excluding) costs of added life years the cost per QALY for 
existing homes was €130,000 (€99,000). For new homes the cost per QALY including 
(excluding) costs of added life years was €39,000 (€25,000).
CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that it is not cost-effective to reduce indoor 
radon levels from 200 Bq/m3 to a maximum of 100 Bq/m3 in existing homes, whereas 
it is cost-effective for new homes.

G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the largest family of cell signaling 
transmembrane proteins that can be modulated by a plethora of chemical 
compounds. Systematic cheminformatics analysis of structurally and 
pharmacologically characterized GPCR ligands shows that cocrystallized GPCR 
ligands cover a significant part of chemical ligand space, despite their limited 
number. Many GPCR ligands and substructures interact with multiple receptors, 
providing a basis for polypharmacological ligand design. Experimentally 
determined GPCR structures represent a variety of binding sites and 
receptor-ligand interactions that can be translated to chemically similar 
ligands for which structural data are lacking. This integration of structural, 
pharmacological, and chemical information on GPCR-ligand interactions enables 
the extension of the structural GPCR-ligand interactome and the structure-based 
design of novel modulators of GPCR function.

Primary Prevention with a Capital P.

Olshansky SJ, Carnes BA.

The survival of large segments of human populations to advanced ages is a 
crowning achievement of improvements in public health and medicine, but in the 
21st century, our continued desire to extend life brings forth a unique dilemma. 
The risk of death from chronic fatal diseases has declined, but even if it 
continues to do so in the future, the resulting longevity benefits are likely to 
diminish. It is even possible that unhealthy life expectancy could rise in the 
future as major fatal diseases wane. The reason for this is that the longer we 
live, the greater the influence of biological aging on the expression of fatal 
and disabling diseases. Research in gerontology has already demonstrated that 
aging is inherently modifiable, and that a therapeutic intervention that slows 
aging in people is a plausible target for science and public health. Given the 
speed with which population aging is progressing and chronic fatal and disabling 
conditions are challenging health-care costs across the globe, the case is now 
being made that delayed aging could be one of the most efficient and promising 
ways to combat disease, extend healthy life, compress morbidity, and reduce 
health-care costs.

High life expectancy and reversed socioeconomic gradients of elderly people in 
Mexico and Costa Rica.

Rosero-Bixby L(1).

Author information:

BACKGROUND: Some existing estimates suggest, controversially, that life 
expectancy at age 60 (LE60) of Latin American males is exceptionally high. 
Knowledge of adult mortality in Latin America is often based on unreliable 
statistics or indirect demographic methods.
OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to gather direct estimates of mortality at older 
ages in two Latin American countries (Mexico and Costa Rica) using recent 
longitudinal surveys and to determine the socioeconomic status (SES) gradients 
for LE60.
METHODS: Data were collected from independent panels of approximately 7,000 
older adults followed over more than a decade-the MHAS and CRELES surveys. The 
age-specific death rates were modeled with Gompertz regression, and thousands of 
life tables were simulated to estimate LE60 and its confidence interval.
RESULTS: LE60 estimates obtained from MHAS and CRELES are similar to those 
obtained from traditional statistics, confirming the exceptionally high LE60 of 
men in the two countries. The expected gradients of higher LE60 with higher SES 
are not present, especially among males, who even show reverse gradients (some 
exaggerated by data issues).
CONCLUSIONS: Vital statistics correctly estimate elderly mortality in Mexico and 
Costa Rica. The higher-than-expected LE60 among Latin American males in general, 
and particularly among low-SES individuals, seems to be real; their determinants 
should be thoroughly investigated.
CONTRIBUTION: This study shows with hard, reliable data, independent of 
traditional statistics, that elderly males in tropical Latin America enjoy an 
exceptionally high life expectancy and that SES gradients are absent or even 
reverse.

BACKGROUND:  We aim to measure the quality of life and clinical and functional 
outcomes of a patient who had undergone ligament reconstruction of the forearm 
interosseous membrane, using brachioradialis tendon more ulna distraction 
osteogenesis in treatment with multiple cartilaginous exostosis.
CASE DESCRIPTION:  We present a 11-year-old boy with congenital deformity in his 
right, dominant forearm,Type IIb by Masada classification. Distraction of the 
ulna, resection of exostosis, and reconstruction of the distal part of the 
interosseous membrane was performed. One year later, the patient experienced 
good evaluation. Wrist flexion was 70 degrees, extension was 60 degrees, radial 
deviation was 20 degrees, and ulnar deviation was 30 degrees. Forearm pronation 
was 60 degrees and supination was 90 degrees. Elbow flexion was 120 degrees, 
extension was -5 degrees, and digit motion was full. DASH score of 5, VAS of 0, 
and grip strength of 92% compared to the unaffected side were obtained. Forearm 
radiographic aspects showed healing of the distraction, articular congruency, 
the distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ), and radiocapitellum joint. The distraction 
distance was 28 mm, the distraction period was 67 days, the consolidation period 
was 96 days, and the period of fixator treatment was 92 days. The distraction 
speed was 0.5 mm/day. Good stability and joint congruency of the DRUJ and elbow 
were obtained. Good radiographic, clinical, and functional results were obtained 
improving the life quality of that patient.
LITERATURE REVIEW:  The treatment of forearm deformities is difficult and 
complicated. There is no consensus to the overall management. As there is still 
a lack of long-term results, the indications for surgery, various surgical 
options, and the timing of the intervention have been a matter of controversy in 
the literature. Would DRUJ be stable when ulnar lengthening is combined with 
excision of exostosis? Is it possible to reduce the radial head with this 
technique?
CLINICAL RELEVANCE:  We would like to suggest an interosseous membrane (distal 
oblique band) reconstruction to improve this treatment. We believe this 
suggestion could maintain DRUJ and elbow more stable and functional. We agree 
that the best time to perform the corrections is early and gradually. We prefer 
to correct the ulna, radius, DRUJ and elbow in many steps than in only one 
procedure.

Some of the recombinant protein therapeutics with short half-life requires high 
frequent dose or injection, which results in poor patient compliance. This 
challenge has prompted the development of long-acting recombinant proteins in 
recent years. Four strategies and methods, including chemical modification, 
protein engineering, fusion proteins and protein glycosylation are used to 
modify protein molecule and finally obtain improved pharmacokinetics (PK) 
properties. This article reviews the four strategies of half-life extension and 
presents a detailed list of long-acting therapeutics on US, EU and China 
markets.

Mechanical forces acting on the ribosome can alter the speed of protein 
synthesis, indicating that mechanochemistry can contribute to translation 
control of gene expression. The naturally occurring sources of these mechanical 
forces, the mechanism by which they are transmitted 10 nm to the ribosome's 
catalytic core, and how they influence peptide bond formation rates are largely 
unknown. Here, we identify a new source of mechanical force acting on the 
ribosome by using in situ experimental measurements of changes in nascent-chain 
extension in the exit tunnel in conjunction with all-atom and coarse-grained 
computer simulations. We demonstrate that when the number of residues composing 
a nascent chain increases, its unstructured segments outside the ribosome exit 
tunnel generate piconewtons of force that are fully transmitted to the 
ribosome's P-site. The route of force transmission is shown to be through the 
nascent polypetide's backbone, not through the wall of the ribosome's exit 
tunnel. Utilizing quantum mechanical calculations we find that a consequence of 
such a pulling force is to decrease the transition state free energy barrier to 
peptide bond formation, indicating that the elongation of a nascent chain can 
accelerate translation. Since nascent protein segments can start out as largely 
unfolded structural ensembles, these results suggest a pulling force is present 
during protein synthesis that can modulate translation speed. The mechanism of 
force transmission we have identified and its consequences for peptide bond 
formation should be relevant regardless of the source of the pulling force.

Studies of longevity among centenarians examine biological, psychological, and 
social factors, yet few consider these components concurrently. This study 
explores such factors individually and collectively, as they are related to days 
lived past the age of 100 years. Data from 268 family members of centenarians 
identified in the State of Utah between 2008 and 2015 were used in negative 
binomial models predicting number of days lived among the centenarians. Findings 
suggested that sleep latency (biological), life satisfaction (psychological), 
and attachment closeness (social) were predictive factors of more days lived 
within individual models. When considered together, sleep latency and life 
satisfaction remained significant predictors of days lived. Although biological 
factors are commonly considered in relation to longevity, this study further 
indicates that psychological and social factors may play important roles in life 
expectancy. Further examination is needed to explore how these factors link 
additionally to active life expectancy.

STUDY QUESTION: Is HIV associated with increased time to pregnancy (TTP)?
SUMMARY ANSWER: HIV-positive women who discontinue a contraceptive method to 
become pregnant have increased TTP, particularly among those who likely do not 
know their status.
WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: HIV-positive women have fewer children on average than 
their HIV-negative counterparts due to both behavioral and biological factors. 
There is a need to better describe and quantify fecundity patterns associated 
with HIV in the general population.
STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: This cross-sectional study was based on data from 
12 Demographic and Health Surveys (DHSs) conducted between 2003 and 2013 in 11 
African countries. All studies collected dried blood spot samples for HIV 
testing and included a retrospective calendar module that recorded women's 
monthly reproductive status in the 5 years preceding the survey. TTP was 
measured among 3181 women discontinuing a contraceptive method within 2 years of 
the survey in order to become pregnant.
PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: We use Cox proportional hazard models 
for discrete survival data to model TTP and estimate fecundability odds ratios 
(FOR) and 95% CIs for the 12-month period following contraceptive 
discontinuation. In addition to employing a binary measure of HIV status, we 
also develop an additional explanatory measure that combines HIV status with 
information on whether respondents had ever been tested for HIV and received 
their results (which proxies for knowledge of HIV status) to reduce the threat 
of confounding from behavioral changes following an HIV diagnosis.
MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: In our sample, 10.3% of women were 
HIV-positive, and a little more than half (51.8%) of women received test results 
and likely knew their status. Over a 12-month observation period, HIV-positive 
women had a 25% average reduction in fecundity compared to HIV-negative women 
[adjusted FOR (aFOR) = 0.75 (0.62-0.92)] after adjusting for confounders. The 
12-month fecundity patterns differed by women's likely knowledge of their status 
such that results were primarily driven by HIV-positive women who likely did not 
know their status. Moreover, reductions in fecundity attributable to HIV were 
not uniform over time. Among women who were still trying for pregnancy after 3 
unsuccessful months, HIV-positive women had half the odds of becoming pregnant 
compared to HIV-negative women [aFOR = 0.50 (0.35-0.71)]. Conversely, there were 
no significant differences in FORs between HIV-negative and HIV-positive women 
in the first 3 months.
LIMITATIONS REASONS FOR CAUTION: Because dried blood spot samples for HIV 
testing were collected at the time of the survey but reproductive calendar data 
were collected retrospectively, it is possible that we introduced 
misclassification bias, as we have no knowledge if the acquisition of HIV 
occurred before or after pregnancy attempt.
WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: As life expectancy and quality health status 
improve due to earlier initiation of antiretroviral (ARV) treatment in 
HIV-positive women, there has been growing awareness that services should also 
address the fertility desires of HIV-positive women who want children. These 
findings indicate that if a pregnancy does not occur after 3 months of 
attempting pregnancy, HIV-positive women and HIV-discordant couples should 
request access to HIV and reproductive pre-pregnancy counseling and health 
assessments.

TARS and TARS2 encode cytoplasmic and mitochondrial threonyl-tRNA synthetases 
(ThrRSs) in mammals, respectively. Interestingly, in higher eukaryotes, a third 
gene, TARSL2, encodes a ThrRS-like protein (ThrRS-L), which is highly homologous 
to cytoplasmic ThrRS but with a different N-terminal extension (N-extension). 
Whether ThrRS-L has canonical functions is unknown. In this work, we studied the 
organ expression pattern, cellular localization, canonical aminoacylation and 
editing activities of mouse ThrRS-L (mThrRS-L). Tarsl2 is ubiquitously but 
unevenly expressed in mouse tissues. Different from mouse cytoplasmic ThrRS 
(mThrRS), mThrRS-L is located in both the cytoplasm and nucleus; the nuclear 
distribution is mediated via a nuclear localization sequence at its C-terminus. 
Native mThrRS-L enriched from HEK293T cells was active in aminoacylation and 
editing. To investigate the in vitro catalytic properties of mThrRS-L 
accurately, we replaced the N-extension of mThrRS-L with that of mThrRS. The 
chimeric protein (mThrRS-L-NT) has amino acid activation, aminoacylation and 
editing activities. We compared the activities and cross-species tRNA 
recognition between mThrRS-L-NT and mThrRS. Despite having a similar 
aminoacylation activity, mThrRS-L-NT and mThrRS exhibit differences in tRNA 
recognition and editing capacity. Our results provided the first analysis of the 
aminoacylation and editing activities of ThrRS-L, and improved our understanding 
of Tarsl2.

The rising cost of health care in the United States has been the focus of 
intense debate within the medical, legal, and legislative arenas, with the cost 
of cancer care representing an important component. Cost effectiveness is not 
always easy to define, and there is no standard metric in assessing this measure 
related to cancer therapies. Significant controversy surrounds exactly what is 
the appropriate cost per added year of life. This review examines cost, 
effectiveness, and comparative cost effectiveness of novel systemic therapies 
for patients with urologic malignancies. Cancer 2018;124:2897-905. © 2018
