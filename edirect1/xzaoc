The objective of the present study was to describe a new model of the 
cost-effectiveness of treatment of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and its 
application to a comparison of pregabalin versus venlafaxine extended-release 
(XR) from a Spanish healthcare perspective. Microsimulation techniques, 
including Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM-A) score, number of weeks with minimal or 
no anxiety (HAM-A <or= 9), and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), were used to 
predict treatment outcomes for patients with moderate-to-severe GAD who would be 
treated with pregabalin vs venlafaxine XR. Expected levels of healthcare 
utilization and unit cost of care are derived from Spanish published sources. We 
express cost-effectiveness alternatively in terms of incremental cost per 
additional week with minimal or no anxiety, and incremental cost per QALY gained 
[in 2007 Euros (euro)]. Considering costs of drug treatment only, the 
incremental cost [mean (95% confidence interval)] of pregabalin (vs venlafaxine 
XR) would be euro96 (euro86, euro107) per additional week with minimal or no 
anxiety, and euro32,832 (euro29,656, euro36,308) per QALY gained. When other 
medical care costs are considered, cost-effectiveness ratios decline to euro70 
(euro61, euro80) per additional week with no or minimal anxiety, and euro23,909 
(euro20,820, euro27,006) per QALY gained. We conclude that, using a new 
microsimulation model of the treatment of GAD, pregabalin appears to be 
cost-effective vs venlafaxine XR in a Spanish healthcare setting.

persons with advanced illness.

BACKGROUND: Clinicians' discussions about hospice with patients and families are 
important as a means of communicating end-of-life options.
OBJECTIVE: To identify determinants of clinicians' hospice discussions and the 
impact of such discussions on hospice use.
DESIGN: We interviewed 215 patients age > or = 60 years with advanced cancer, 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), or heart failure (HF) at least 
every 4 months for up to 2 years. Participants provided information about their 
health status and treatment preferences. Clinicians completed a questionnaire 
every 6 months about their estimates of patient life expectancy and their 
communication with the patient and family about hospice.
RESULTS: In their final survey, clinicians reported discussing hospice with 46% 
of patients with cancer, compared to 10% with COPD and 7% with HF. Apart from 
diagnosis of cancer, the factors most strongly associated with hospice 
discussion were clinicians' estimate of and certainty about patient life 
expectancy (P < 0.001). However, clinicians were unable to anticipate the deaths 
of a considerable portion of patients (40%). Although patient unwillingness to 
undergo minor medical interventions was associated with hospice discussion (P < 
0.05), a sizeable portion of clinicians (40%) whose patients reported this 
characteristic did not have the discussion. Clinicians' discussion of hospice 
independently increased the likelihood of hospice use (OR = 5.3, 95% CI = 
2.3-13).
CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians' discussion of hospice for patients with advanced 
illness, and, ultimately, patients' use of hospice, relies largely on clinician 
estimates of patient life expectancy and the predictability of disease course. 
Many clinicians whose patients might benefit from learning about hospice are not 
having these discussions.

Street, 2 Donner Building, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA. lin@xrt.upenn.edu

The incidence of cancer among older patients continues to rise. The use of 
combined modality therapy has improved survival in a variety of malignancies, 
including rectal, head and neck, and lung cancer; however, the addition of 
chemotherapy increases substantially the toxicities of treatment. Elderly 
patients have generally been excluded from prospective clinical trials and as 
such, there is a lack of evidence-based data with regards to the most 
appropriate treatment. Age itself should not be used as a criterion for 
foregoing combined modality therapy in elderly patients. Due to the increased 
toxicity of therapy, patients must be carefully selected. Any medical 
intervention should account for life expectancy, performance status, tolerance 
to therapy, and presence of medical or social conditions that may impact 
therapy. We encourage a comprehensive geriatric assessment to evaluate 
functional status, comorbidities, mental status, psychological state, social 
support, nutritional status, polypharmacy, and geriatric conditions in order to 
improve a patient's overall functional status during the course of therapy. Fit 
elderly patients should be considered candidates for combined modality therapy, 
however, because they are potentially more vulnerable to therapy, careful 
attention should be paid to hydration and nutritional status with early 
intervention when necessary. Investigators should be encouraged to expand 
eligibility to include elderly patients on non age-related clinical trials. 
Additionally, therapy-related clinical trials directed at the elderly should be 
developed.

AIMS: This study examined the effect of microbial cell-free meat extract (CFME) 
derived from spoiled meat, in which quorum sensing (QS) compounds were present, 
on the growth kinetics (lag phase, and growth rate) of two spoilage bacteria, 
Pseudomonas fluorescens and Serratia marcescens.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Aliquots of CFME from spoiled meat were transferred to 
Brain Heart Infusion broth inoculated with 10(3) CFU ml(-1) of 18 h cultures of 
Ps. fluorescens or Ser. marcescens, both fresh meat isolates; CFME derived from 
unspoiled fresh meat ('clean' meat) served as a control. Changes in impedance 
measurements were monitored for 48 h, and the detection time (Tdet) was 
recorded. It was found that in the absence of CFME containing QS compounds the 
Tdet was shorter (P < 0.05) than that in broth samples with added CFME from 
spoiled meat. The rate of growth of Ps. fluorescens, recorded as the maximum 
slope rate of conductance changes (MSrCC), after Tdet, was higher (P < 0.05) in 
samples with CFME containing QS compounds compared to samples without CFME or 
CFME derived from 'clean' meat. Similar results in MSrCC of impedance changes 
were obtained for Ser. marcescens.
CONCLUSIONS: The study indicated that the growth rate (expressed in MSrCC units) 
of meat spoilage bacteria in vitro was enhanced in samples supplemented with 
CFME containing QS compounds compared to control samples (i.e., without CFME or 
with CFME from 'clean' meat). This behaviour may explain the dominant role of 
these two bacteria in the spoilage of meat.
SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: These results illustrate the potential 
effect of signalling compounds released during storage of meat on the behaviour 
of meat spoilage bacteria. Understanding such interactions may assist in the 
control of fresh meat quality and the extension of its shelf life.

application of methods.

BACKGROUND: The characterization of uncertainty is critical in 
cost-effectiveness analysis, particularly when considering whether additional 
evidence is needed. In addition to parameter and methodological uncertainty, 
there are other sources of uncertainty which include simplifications and 
scientific judgments that have to be made when constructing and interpreting a 
model of any sort. These have been classified in a number of different ways but 
can be referred to collectively as structural uncertainties.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Separate reviews were undertaken to identify what forms 
these other sources of uncertainty take and what other forms of potential 
methods to explicitly characterize these types of uncertainties in decision 
analytic models. These methods were demonstrated through application to four 
decision models each representing one of the four types of uncertainty.
RESULTS: These sources of uncertainty fall into four general themes: 1) 
inclusion of relevant comparators; 2) inclusion of relevant events; 3) 
alternative statistical estimation methods; and 4) clinical uncertainty.Two 
methods to explicitly characterize such uncertainties were identified: model 
selection and model averaging. In addition, an alternative approach, adding 
uncertain parameters to represent the source of uncertainty was also 
considered.The applications demonstrate that cost-effectiveness may be sensitive 
to these uncertainties and the methods used to characterize them. The value of 
research was particularly sensitive to these uncertainties and the methods used 
to characterize it. It is therefore important, for decision-making purposes, to 
incorporate such uncertainties into the modeling process.
CONCLUSION: Only parameterizing the uncertainty directly in the model can inform 
the decision to conduct further research to resolve this source of uncertainty.

Development and validation of a Markov microsimulation model for the economic 
evaluation of treatments in osteoporosis.

OBJECTIVE: Markov models are increasingly used in economic evaluations of 
treatments for osteoporosis. Most of the existing evaluations are cohort-based 
Markov models missing comprehensive memory management and versatility. In this 
article, we describe and validate an original Markov microsimulation model to 
accurately assess the cost-effectiveness of prevention and treatment of 
osteoporosis.
METHODS: We developed a Markov microsimulation model with a lifetime horizon and 
a direct health-care cost perspective. The patient history was recorded and was 
used in calculations of transition probabilities, utilities, and costs. To test 
the internal consistency of the model, we carried out an example calculation for 
alendronate therapy. Then, external consistency was investigated by comparing 
absolute lifetime risk of fracture estimates with epidemiologic data.
RESULTS: For women at age 70 years, with a twofold increase in the fracture risk 
of the average population, the costs per quality-adjusted life-year gained for 
alendronate therapy versus no treatment were estimated at €9105 and €15,325, 
respectively, under full and realistic adherence assumptions. All the 
sensitivity analyses in terms of model parameters and modeling assumptions were 
coherent with expected conclusions and absolute lifetime risk of fracture 
estimates were within the range of previous estimates, which confirmed both 
internal and external consistency of the model.
CONCLUSION: Microsimulation models present some major advantages over 
cohort-based models, increasing the reliability of the results and being largely 
compatible with the existing state of the art, evidence-based literature. The 
developed model appears to be a valid model for use in economic evaluations in 
osteoporosis.

OBJECTIVES: Clinical trial data indicate that posaconazole is superior to 
fluconazole (FLU) or itraconazole (ITRA) in preventing invasive fungal 
infections (IFIs) among neutropenic patients. Our objective was to assess the 
cost-effectiveness of posaconazole versus FLU or ITRA for prevention of IFIs 
among neutropenic patients.
METHODS: We used modeling techniques to assess the cost-effectiveness of 
posaconazole versus FLU or ITRA in the prevention of IFIs among patients with 
acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and 
chemotherapy-induced neutropenia. The probabilities of experiencing an IFI, 
IFI-related death, and death from other causes over 100 days of follow-up were 
estimated from clinical trial data. Long-term mortality, drug costs, and IFI 
treatment costs were obtained from secondary sources.
RESULTS: Posaconazole is associated with fewer IFIs per patient (0.05 vs. 0.11) 
relative to FLU or ITRA over 100 days of follow-up, and lower discounted costs 
($3900 vs. $4500) and increased life-years (2.50 vs. 2.43 discounted) over a 
lifetime horizon. Results from a probabilistic sensitivity analysis indicate 
that there is a 73% probability that posaconazole is cost saving versus FLU or 
ITRA and a 96% probability that the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for 
posaconazole is at or below $50,000 per life-year saved.
CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that posaconazole is very likely to be a cost-effective 
alternative to FLU or ITRA in the prevention of IFIs among neutropenic patients 
with AML and MDS, and may result in cost savings.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of disease-modifying therapies 
(DMTs) for the management of multiple sclerosis (MS) compared to best supportive 
care in the United States.
METHODS: Cost-effectiveness analysis was undertaken using a state transition 
model of disease natural history and the impact of DMTs for the representative 
Medicare beneficiary with MS. Costs and outcomes were evaluated from the 
health-care payer perspective using a 50-year time horizon. Natural history data 
were drawn from a longitudinal cohort study. The effectiveness of the DMTs was 
evaluated through a systematic review. Utility data were taken from a study of 
patients with clinically definite MS in Nova Scotia. Resource use and cost data 
were derived from the Sonya Slifka database and associated literature.
RESULTS: When based on placebo-controlled evidence, the marginal 
cost-effectiveness of interferon beta (IFNβ) and glatiramer acetate compared to 
best supportive care is expected to be in excess of $100,000 per 
quality-adjusted life-year gained. When evidence from head-to-head trials is 
incorporated into the model, the cost-effectiveness of 6 MIU IFNβ-1a is expected 
to be considerably less favorable. Treatment discontinuation upon progression to 
Expanded Disability Status Scale 7.0 is expected to improve the 
cost-effectiveness of all DMTs.
CONCLUSIONS: Further research is required to examine the long-term clinical 
effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of these therapies. There is no definitive 
guidance in the United States concerning discontinuation of DMTs; this study 
suggests that the prudent use of a treatment discontinuation rule may 
considerably improve the cost-effectiveness of DMTs.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the cost-utility of eprosartan versus enalapril 
(primary prevention) and versus nitrendipine (secondary prevention) on the basis 
of head-to-head evidence from randomized controlled trials.
METHODS: The HEALTH model (Health Economic Assessment of Life with Teveten for 
Hypertension) is an object-oriented probabilistic Monte Carlo simulation model. 
It combines a Framingham-based risk calculation with a systolic blood pressure 
approach to estimate the relative risk reduction of cardiovascular and 
cerebrovascular events based on recent meta-analyses. In secondary prevention, 
an additional risk reduction is modeled for eprosartan according to the results 
of the MOSES study ("Morbidity and Mortality after Stroke--Eprosartan Compared 
to Nitrendipine for Secondary Prevention"). Costs and utilities were derived 
from published estimates considering European country-specific health-care payer 
perspectives.
RESULTS: Comparing eprosartan to enalapril in a primary prevention setting the 
mean costs per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained were highest in Germany 
(Euro 24,036) followed by Belgium (Euro 17,863), the UK (Euro 16,364), Norway 
(Euro 13,834), Sweden (Euro 11,691) and Spain (Euro 7918). In a secondary 
prevention setting (eprosartan vs. nitrendipine) the highest costs per QALY 
gained have been observed in Germany (Euro 9136) followed by the UK (Euro 6008), 
Norway (Euro 1695), Sweden (Euro 907), Spain (Euro -2054) and Belgium (Euro 
-5767).
CONCLUSIONS: Considering a Euro 30,000 willingness-to-pay threshold per QALY 
gained, eprosartan is cost-effective as compared to enalapril in primary 
prevention (patients >or=50 years old and a systolic blood pressure >or=160 mm 
Hg) and cost-effective as compared to nitrendipine in secondary prevention (all 
investigated patients).

Avenue, San Diego, CA 92103, USA. eroeland@sdhospice.org

Malignant bowel obstruction (MBO) is a challenging complication of advanced 
cancer. Several pathophysiologic mechanisms are responsible for the syndrome, 
including mechanical compression, motility disorders, gastrointestinal secretion 
accumulation, decreased gastrointestinal absorption, and inflammation. The 
treatment of related symptoms requires a collaborative approach of surgical, 
interventional, and medical specialists. The surgical approach proves beneficial 
in selected patients with operable lesions, life expectancy greater than 2 
months, and good performance status. Interventionalists place self-expanding 
metallic stents as a minimally invasive palliative method either as a definitive 
treatment or as a bridge to surgery. However, most patients with MBO are not 
candidates for surgery or stent placement. Medical management with opioids, 
antispasmodics, antiemetics, antisecretory agents, and corticosteroids is 
effective in controlling the symptoms associated with MBO. This article 
discusses the current understanding of MBO pathophysiology and emphasizes 
current MBO management concepts; it then reviews surgical, interventional, and 
medical approaches.

Life-table calculations of excess risk for incidence versus mortality: ethylene 
oxide case study.

Bryan, TX 77802, USA. SielkenAssoc@aol.com

In US EPA's evaluation of ethylene oxide (EO) in 2006, the calculation of the 
excess risk of lymphohematopoietic (LH) cancer incidence was flawed. The 
calculation was inappropriately based on an exposure-response model for LH 
mortality instead of LH incidence. This is especially inappropriate for EO 
because EO exposure may not increase LH incidence except at high doses. The 
observed increases in LH mortality with EO exposure in males in the NIOSH 
epidemiology study, although not statistically significant, can be explained at 
all but the highest doses by exposure-dependent changes in the survival time 
between LH onset and LH mortality without any changes in LH incidence. 
Furthermore, EPA's life-table calculations of excess risk of incidence used 
formulas that are only appropriate for mortality. All of these concerns strongly 
suggest that EPA should limit their excess risk calculations to mortality unless 
they have data from an epidemiology study of incidence from which to derive an 
exposure-response model. What excess risks are calculated and how they are 
calculated is important for a scientifically-defensible regulatory assessment of 
EO and other substances.

OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of primary angioplasty compared 
with thrombolysis for acute ST elevation myocardial infarction. Design Cost 
analysis of UK observational database, incorporated into decision analytical 
model.
METHODS: Patients receiving treatment within a comprehensive angioplasty service 
were compared with control patients receiving thrombolysis-based care. The 
treatment costs and delays to treatment of thrombolysis and angioplasty were 
estimated. These estimates were then incorporated into an existing model of 
cost-effectiveness that synthesises evidence from 22 randomised trials to 
estimate health outcomes measured by quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Main 
outcome measures Costs from a health service perspective and outcomes measured 
as quality adjusted.
RESULTS: The mean cost of the initial treatment was 3509 pounds for thrombolysis 
at control sites, 5176 pounds for angioplasty in usual working hours at National 
Infarct Angioplasty Project sites and an additional 245 pounds if undertaken out 
of hours. Angioplasty-based care had an incremental cost of 4520 pounds per QALY 
gained and 0.9 probability of being cost-effective at a threshold of 20,000 
pounds per QALY gained. This probability was >0.95 if patients were directly 
admitted to the cardiac catheter laboratory, 0.75 if admitted via the emergency 
department or coronary care unit and 0.38 if transferred to the angioplasty 
centre from another hospital.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, primary angioplasty-based care is highly likely to be 
cost-effective at an assumed threshold of 20,000 pounds per QALY gained. It is 
more likely to be cost-effective if patients are admitted directly to the 
cardiac catheter laboratory rather than via other hospital departments, or if 
transferred from another hospital.

Targeting DNA methylation.

Issa JP(1), Kantarjian HM.

MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030, USA. jissa@mdanderson.org

Two nucleoside inhibitors of DNA methylation, azacitidine and decitabine, are 
now standard of care for the treatment of the myelodysplastic syndrome, a deadly 
form of leukemia. These old drugs, developed as cytotoxic agents and nearly 
abandoned decades ago were resurrected by the renewed interest in DNA 
methylation. They have now provided proof of principle for epigenetic therapy, 
the final chapter in the long saga to provide legitimacy to the field of 
epigenetics in cancer. But challenges remain; we don't understand precisely how 
or why the drugs work or stop working after an initial response. Extending these 
promising findings to solid tumors faces substantial hurdles from drug uptake to 
clinical trial design. We do not know yet how to select patients for this 
therapy and how to move it from life extension to cure. The epigenetic potential 
of DNA methylation inhibitors may be limited by other epigenetic mechanisms that 
are also worth exploring as therapeutic targets. But the idea of stably changing 
gene expression in vivo has transformative potential in cancer therapy and 
beyond.

OBJECTIVE: This study assesses the long-term cost-effectiveness of a 
comprehensive model of mental health care for first-episode psychosis. The study 
is an extension of a previous economic evaluation of the Early Psychosis 
Prevention and Intervention Centre (EPPIC) that assessed the first-year costs 
and outcomes of treatment.
METHOD: The current study used a matched, historical control group design with a 
follow-up of approximately 8 years. Complete follow-up data were available for 
65 of the original 102 participants. Direct public mental health service costs 
incurred subsequent to the first year of treatment and symptomatic and 
functional outcomes of 32 participants initially treated for up to 2 years at 
EPPIC were compared with a matched cohort of 33 participants initially treated 
by generic mental health services. Treatment-related resource use was measured 
and valued using Australian published prices.
RESULTS: Almost 8 years after initial treatment, EPPIC subjects displayed lower 
levels of positive psychotic symptoms (P = .007), were more likely to be in 
remission (P = .008), and had a more favorable course of illness (P = .011) than 
the controls. Fifty-six percent of the EPPIC cohort were in paid employment over 
the last 2 years compared with 33% of controls (P = .083). Each EPPIC patient 
costs on average A$3445 per annum to treat compared with controls, who each 
costs A$9503 per annum.
CONCLUSIONS: Specialized early psychosis programs can deliver a higher recovery 
rate at one-third the cost of standard public mental health services. Residual 
methodological limitations and limited sample size indicate that further 
research is required to verify this finding.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The purpose of this review is to improve the basis upon which 
advice on pregnancy is given to renal transplant recipients in the reproductive 
age group. The review attempts to impart up-to-date evidence-based information 
on the predictable outcome and the risk of pregnancy after kidney 
transplantation.
RECENT FINDINGS: A current change in the consensus opinion of American Society 
of Transplantation regarding timing of pregnancy after transplantation. There 
are conflicting data regarding the utility of drug monitoring and dose 
adjustments of immunosuppressive medications during pregnancy and breast 
feeding. There is a recent change in the U.S. Food and Drug Administration 
category of mycophenolate mofetil from pregnancy Class C to D based on recent 
adverse fetal and neonatal outcome.
SUMMARY: Counseling regarding pregnancy should be an integral part of caring for 
the kidney transplant patient in the reproductive age group. Ethical concerns 
exist about advising pregnancy and fertility treatment for a woman whose life 
expectancy may be affected by outcome of pregnancy. Toxic effects of newer 
immunosuppressive medications exposed in utero and during breast feeding and its 
long-term effects in the offspring have to be clearly defined. The need for 
longitudinal studies and multicenter observational studies cannot be over 
emphasized to help answer our considerable gaps in this area.

The cost-effectiveness of strontium ranelate was compared to no treatment in UK 
women using the FRAX algorithm for fracture risk assessment. At a 
willingness-to-pay of pound 30,000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY), 
strontium ranelate was generally cost-effective in women with prior fracture at 
the threshold of osteoporosis from an age of 65 years.
INTRODUCTION: The objectives of the study were to estimate the 
cost-effectiveness of strontium ranelate in the UK for the treatment of 
osteoporosis and to establish intervention thresholds for treatment using the 
FRAX tool.
METHODS: The cost-effectiveness of strontium ranelate was compared to no 
treatment in postmenopausal women with clinical risk factors for fracture using 
a lifetime simulation model based on Markov cohort methodology that incorporated 
the features of FRAX.
RESULTS: At a threshold of pound 30,000 per QALY, strontium ranelate was 
generally cost-effective in women from an age of 65 years with prior fracture at 
the threshold of osteoporosis (i.e., a T-score of -2.5 SD) and in women with a 
prior fracture (and no information on bone mineral density) from the age of 65 
years. At a threshold of pound 20,000, strontium ranelate became cost-effective 
at a 10-year fracture probability of 25.7% and at 16.9% with a threshold of 
pound 30,000 for a QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: Strontium ranelate is a cost-effective agent for the treatment of 
established osteoporosis in women over the age of 65 years. Cost-effective 
scenarios were also found for the prevention and treatment of fractures 
associated with osteoporosis, in younger women with additional clinical risk 
factors.

Mitochondrial matters of the heart: a plethora of regulatory modes to maintain 
function for a long lifetime.

The human/animal heart, comprised of cells called "myocytes" is an incredible 
organ that to remain beating must be fueled constantly via the hydrolysis of 
adenosine tri-phosphate (ATP). Deriving most of its ATP from mitochondrial 
oxidative phosphorylation (ox phos), and a smaller amount from "glycolysis", 
i.e., glucose conversion to pyruvate or lactate, the heart helps in the delivery 
of oxygen (via hemoglobin) to every organ/tissue in our body. Then, the empty 
(deoxy) hemoglobin returns to load more oxygen and the journey to tissues is 
repeated 24 h a day, year after year, until "death do us part". To support this 
essential "pumping" process the heart must work constantly, i.e., 70-80 years 
(life expectancy in the U.S.). This is a remarkable feat when compared with one 
of our most costly people-made technologies, i.e., automobiles (cars). In the 
past century, it was rare to see the family car survive more than 10-15 years 
unless it had been subjected to motor replacement surgery. Most were laid to 
rest at a much earlier age. Now, in this new millennium should a brilliant car 
manufacturer succeed in constructing a car engine as efficient as the human 
heart, each family member requiring a car would need only one per life time. 
With this in mind, one of the major future "matters of the heart" is to keep it 
pumping, not only for the current 70-80 year life span but much longer. To do 
this depends on, among other matters, the two processes noted above, i.e., 
oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis. The former is strictly a mitochondrial 
process that works only in the presence of oxygen whereas glycolysis, dependent 
on mitochondrial bound hexokinase 2 (MB-HK-2), works either in the presence or 
absence of oxygen. In addition, the MB-HK 2 is anti-apoptotic and helps with 
other factors to retard cell death. Current estimates reveal that the human 
heart of an individual living 70-80 years will have undergone 2.5-3.0 billion 
beats, a feat that is energetically feasible only due to the heart cells' 
(cardiomyocytes) large population of mitochondria with bound HK-2.

Health care for older persons in Colombia: a country profile.

Gómez F(1), Curcio CL, Duque G.

Manizales, Colombia. josefergomez@une.net.co

Colombia is a country of approximately 42 million inhabitants, with some 2.5 
million being aged 65 and older. Currently, life expectancy in Colombia is 72.3. 
By 2025, the population life expectancy at birth will be 77.6 for women and 69.8 
for men. The quality of care that people receive as they age in Colombia varies 
according to where they live. Individuals living in the highly urbanized areas 
of Colombia receive high-quality care, whereas elderly subjects living in rural 
areas and in the southern and northern regions are exposed to unemployment, low 
income, inequity of access to health care, drug trafficking, and armed conflict. 
In spite of these problems, characteristics of aging of older people in terms of 
functionality and healthcare access are similar to those of people living in 
developing countries around the world. This article reviews the particular 
characteristics of the elderly population in Colombia, especially the 
significant changes that have happened in recent years, when social instability 
and conflict have determined that health resources be redirected to other budget 
priorities such as defense and security.

Although repeatedly reported in the literature, the extracranial involvement by 
giant-cell arteritis has been considered anecdotal until recent years. The 
emergence of new or improved imaging techniques along with a closer follow-up of 
these patients and their increase in life expectancy are beginning to underline 
that the clinical impact of extracranial involvement by GCA may be more relevant 
than previously thought. This review focuses on the extent of vascular 
involvement in GCA as reported by pathology and imaging studies as well as the 
clinical consequences of imperfect vascular remodelling in various vascular 
territories.

BACKGROUND: Traffic injuries can cause physical, psychological, and economical 
impairment, and affected individuals may also experience shortcomings in their 
post-accident care and treatment. In an earlier randomised controlled study of 
nursing intervention via telephone follow-up, self-ratings of health-related 
quality of life were generally higher in the intervention group than in the 
control group.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of nursing intervention via 
telephone follow-up by examining costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs).
METHODS: A randomised controlled study was conducted between April 2003 and 
April 2005. Car occupants, cyclists, and pedestrians aged between 18 and 70 
years and attending the Emergency Department of Umeå University Hospital in 
Sweden after an injury event in the traffic environment were randomly assigned 
to an intervention (n = 288) or control group (n = 280). The intervention group 
received routine care supplemented by nursing via telephone follow-up during 
half a year, while the control group received routine care only. Data were 
collected from a mail survey using the non-disease-specific health-related 
quality of life instrument EQ5D, and a cost-effectiveness analysis was performed 
including the costs of the intervention and the QALYs gained.
RESULTS: Overall, the intervention group gained 2.60 QALYs (260 individuals with 
an average gain of 0.01 QALYs). The car occupants gained 1.54 QALYs (76 
individuals, average of 0.02). Thus, the cost per QALY gained was 16 000 Swedish 
Crown (SEK) overall and 8 500 SEK for car occupants.
CONCLUSION: Nursing intervention by telephone follow-up after an injury event, 
is a cost effective method giving improved QALY to a very low cost, especially 
for those with minor injuries.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial registration number is: ISRCTN11746866.

Tetraplegia, paralysis of all 4 limbs, is usually the result of cervical spinal 
cord injury. Recovery of independence is the primary goal of people with 
tetraplegia; this requires reconstruction of upper extremity function. Active 
elbow extension, necessary for a wide range of activities of daily living, is 
usually surgically reconstructible. The posterior deltoid-to-triceps tendon 
transfer was developed to restore active elbow extension; good functional 
results and high levels of patient satisfaction have been reported for this 
operation.

American College of Sports Medicine position stand. Exercise and physical 
activity for older adults.

American College of Sports Medicine; Chodzko-Zajko WJ, Proctor DN, Fiatarone 
Singh MA, Minson CT, Nigg CR, Salem GJ, Skinner JS.

The purpose of this Position Stand is to provide an overview of issues critical 
to understanding the importance of exercise and physical activity in older adult 
populations. The Position Stand is divided into three sections: Section 1 
briefly reviews the structural and functional changes that characterize normal 
human aging, Section 2 considers the extent to which exercise and physical 
activity can influence the aging process, and Section 3 summarizes the benefits 
of both long-term exercise and physical activity and shorter-duration exercise 
programs on health and functional capacity. Although no amount of physical 
activity can stop the biological aging process, there is evidence that regular 
exercise can minimize the physiological effects of an otherwise sedentary 
lifestyle and increase active life expectancy by limiting the development and 
progression of chronic disease and disabling conditions. There is also emerging 
evidence for significant psychological and cognitive benefits accruing from 
regular exercise participation by older adults. Ideally, exercise prescription 
for older adults should include aerobic exercise, muscle strengthening 
exercises, and flexibility exercises. The evidence reviewed in this Position 
Stand is generally consistent with prior American College of Sports Medicine 
statements on the types and amounts of physical activity recommended for older 
adults as well as the recently published 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for 
Americans. All older adults should engage in regular physical activity and avoid 
an inactive lifestyle.

Cost effectiveness of pharmacogenetic testing for uridine diphosphate 
glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 before irinotecan administration for metastatic 
colorectal cancer.

USA. heg2001@med.cornell.edu

BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to examine the cost effectiveness of 
using a pharmacogenetic test for uridine diphosphate glycosyltransferase 1A1*28 
(UGT1A1*28) variant homozygosity before administering irinotecan to patients 
with metastatic colorectal cancer.
METHODS: A decision-analytic model from the Medicare payer perspective followed 
hypothetical patients who were treated with combined 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, 
and irinotecan. Under usual care, patients received a full dose of irinotecan. 
With genetic testing, irinotecan dosage was reduced 25% in homozygotes with the 
UGT1A1*28 variant allele. Test performance, chemotherapy toxicity, and 
quality-of-life weights were derived from clinical literature and product 
labels, and costs were derived from 2007 Medicare fee schedules. Chemotherapy 
efficacy after dose reduction, adverse event risk, and other parameters were 
varied in 1-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. The authors also 
calculated the value of investing in further studies of chemotherapy efficacy 
after homozygote dose reductions.
RESULTS: Pretreatment genetic testing costs less ($272 savings per patient 
tested) and yields slightly improved quality-adjusted life expectancy (0.1 
quality-adjusted day per patient tested; approximately 2 quality-adjusted 
hours). Results depended on treatment efficacy but not adverse event risk 
assumptions. The results indicated that testing would avoid 84 cases of severe 
neutropenia, including 4.4 deaths. At a threshold of $100,000 per 
quality-adjusted life year, the therapeutic efficacy of irinotecan in 
homozygotes after dose reduction had to be > or =98.4% of full-dose efficacy for 
genetic testing to remain preferred. Future studies to determine whether this 
efficacy level can be achieved have an economic value of $22 million.
CONCLUSIONS: The current results indicated that pharmacogenetic testing for 
UGT1A1*28 variant homozygosity may be cost effective, but only if irinotecan 
dose reduction in homozygotes does not reduce efficacy. Future studies to 
evaluate reduced-dose efficacy in homozygotes should be considered.

Dissecting insulin signaling pathways: individualised therapeutic targets for 
diagnosis and treatment of insulin resistant states.

School, Dundee, Scotland, DD1 9SY, UK.

Life expectancy in the developed world is increasing, but this comes with a 
simultaneous explosion in 'age-related' as well as 'lifestyle-related' diseases, 
resulting in a decline in quality of life. Three such diseases are Type 2 
diabetes mellitus (T2DM), Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS) and non-alcoholic 
fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which all share a common reduced cellular response 
to the hormone insulin (termed insulin resistance). In T2DM, insulin resistance 
is clearly a contributing factor to disease progression, and is associated with 
obesity, the single greatest risk factor for all three conditions. Current 
research is focused on identifying the initial molecular lesion that results in 
reduced sensitivity to insulin, as improving insulin sensitivity would be 
beneficial to the prognosis of these conditions. However, the bulk of evidence 
suggests that more than one molecular defect in the insulin signalling pathway 
can lead to an insulin resistant phenotype. This raises the possibility that 
individuals with the same clinical phenotype may have distinct molecular reasons 
for the presence of the syndrome, and that the specific lesion influences the 
rate and direction of progression to the associated disease. Clearly the same 
insulin sensitiser could be of equal benefit in each disorder, if it reversed 
multiple signalling problems, however we suggest that appropriate molecular 
diagnosis of the defect may lead to a more targeted and effective therapeutic 
approach. This review discusses the molecular pathology of insulin resistance in 
relation to T2DM, PCOS and NASH. We highlight the shortcomings of current 
therapies, and suggest potential novel drug targets for each disorder.

Moving kidney allocation forward: the ASTS perspective.

(1)Tufts Medical Center, Boston, MA, USA. rfreeman@tuftsmedicalcenter.org

In 2008, the United Network for Organ Sharing issued a request for information 
regarding a proposed revision to kidney allocation policy. This plan described 
combining dialysis time, donor characteristics and the estimated life years from 
transplant (LYFT) each candidate would gain in an allocation score that would 
rank waiting candidates. Though there were some advantages of this plan, the 
inclusion of LYFT raised many questions. Foremost, there was no clear agreement 
that LYFT should be the main criterion by which patients should be ranked. 
Moreover, to rank waiting candidates with this metric, long-term survival models 
were required in which there was no incorporation of patient preference or 
discounting for long survival times and for which the predictive accuracy did 
not achieve accepted standards. The American Society of Transplant Surgeons was 
pleased to participate in the evaluation of the proposal. Ultimately, the 
membership did not favor this proposal, because we felt that it was too 
complicated and that the projected slight increase in overall utility was not 
justified by the compromise in individual justice that was required. We offer 
alternative policy options to address some of the unmet needs and issues that 
were brought to light during this interesting process.

Hepatic resection versus radiofrequency ablation for hepatocellular carcinoma in 
cirrhotic individuals not candidates for liver transplantation: a Markov model 
decision analysis.

University, Rm 6-254 Victoria Building, Victoria General Hospital, Halifax, NS, 
Canada. michele.molinari@cdha.nshealth.ca

BACKGROUND: Several observational studies have suggested that radiofrequency 
ablation (RFA) may have survival benefits similar to hepatic resection (HR) in 
cirrhotic patients affected by hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are not candidates 
for liver transplantation. A small randomized controlled trial confirmed these 
findings, although underpowered to detect a significant difference at 5-year 
interval.
METHODS: A Markov model was created to simulate a randomized trial comparing the 
quality of life-adjusted survival for individuals undergoing HR versus RFA for 
HCCs less than 5 cm in diameter.
RESULTS: HR was the best therapeutic option with 5.33 (standard deviation 
+/-.42) versus 3.91 (standard deviation +/-.38) quality-adjusted life years 
except for in individuals older than 75 years of age (P = .02, log rank test). 
One-way sensitivity analysis showed that RFA was the preferred strategy if the 
perioperative mortality of HR was more than 30%, if the percentage of patients 
with negative margins was less than 60%, and if RFA could be performed at least 
60% of the time for recurrent disease after a previous ablation. The quality of 
life associated with both procedures did not influence the results of this 
model.
CONCLUSIONS: HR provided better quality of life-adjusted survival as ablation 
therapy was associated with increased risk of local recurrent disease requiring 
multiple sessions. For older individuals, RFA appears to be the best therapeutic 
option. If the probability of ablation for recurrent disease is equal in the 2 
arms, survival benefits of RFA is similar to HR.
