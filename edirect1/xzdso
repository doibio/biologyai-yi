BACKGROUND: There is a need to know how changes in health expectancy differ for 
population subgroups globally. The aim of this study was to estimate 10-year 
trends in health expectancies by individual markers of socioeconomic position 
from three points over the lifecourse, evaluating how compression and expansion 
of morbidity have varied within a national population.
METHODS: We analysed data from two cohorts of the Household Income and Labour 
Dynamics in Australia survey. The cohorts were followed annually from 2001 to 
2007 (n=4720; baseline age range 50-100 years) and 2011 to 2017 (n=6632; 
baseline age range 50-99 years). Health expectancies were estimated at age 65 
years for four outcomes reflecting activity limitations, disability, perceived 
health, and mental health. Cohort differences were compared by gender, age left 
school, occupational prestige, and housing tenure.
FINDINGS: Women with low socioeconomic position were the only group with no 
improvements in life expectancy across the two cohorts. Among men with low 
education and all women gains in life expectancy comprised entirely of years 
lived with global activity limitations. Compression of years lived with 
severe-disability, poor self-rated health, and poor mental health was most 
consistently observed for men and women with high education and home ownership. 
Occupational prestige did not greatly differentiate cohort differences in health 
expectancies.
INTERPRETATION: Over the past two decades in Australia, social disparities in 
health expectancies have at least been maintained, and have increased for some 
outcomes. Equitable gains in health expectancies should be a major public health 
goal, and will help support sustainable health and social care systems.

BACKGROUND: Globally, cancer is a leading cause of death and source of 
resistance to increasing life expectancy. In 2019, the World Health Organisation 
estimated cancer as the first or second leading cause of death before the age of 
70 in 112 countries and third or fourth in 23 other countries. Despite the fact 
that cancer has been recognized as a public health problem, there is paucity of 
data on cancer mortality in Nigeria. The aim of this study is to determine the 
pattern of cancer mortality at the University of Port Harcourt Teaching 
Hospital.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a 5 year retrospective study of all cancer 
related deaths at the University of Port Harcourt Teaching Hospital from 1st 
January, 2014 to 31st December, 2018. Relevant data were extracted and analyzed 
using Statistical Package for Social Sciences version 24.
RESULTS: There were 4449 deaths during the period under review, of which 293 
were cancer related deaths, giving a mortality rate of 6.59%. There were 114 
males and 179 females giving a male to female ratio of 1:1.6. Cancer of the 
breast was the most common cause of cancer death and accounted for 61 (20.8%) 
deaths within the study period.
CONCLUSION: Cancer is a major cause of mortality in Nigeria. Cancer of the 
breast is the leading cause of cancer mortality in females and overall while 
cancer of the prostate remains the commonest in men.

Publisher: CONTEXTE: Dans le monde entier, le cancer est l’une des principales 
causes de décès et une source de résistance à l’augmentation de l’espérance de 
vie. En 2019, l’Organisation mondiale de la santé estime que le cancer sera la 
première ou la deuxième cause de décès avant l’âge de 70 ans dans 112 pays et la 
troisième ou quatrième dans 23 autres pays. Malgré le fait que le cancer ait été 
reconnu comme un problème de santé publique, il y a peu de données sur la 
mortalité par cancer au Nigeria. L’objectif de cette étude est de déterminer le 
profil de la mortalité par cancer au l’hôpital universitaire de Port Harcourt.
MATÉRIEL ET MÉTHODES: Il s’agit d’une étude rétrospective sur 5 ans de tous les 
décès liés au cancer à l’hôpital universitaire de Port Harcourt du 1er janvier 
2014 au 31 décembre 2018. Les données pertinentes ont été extraites et analysées 
à l’aide du progiciel de statistiques pour les sciences sociales version 24.
RÉSULTATS: Il y a eu 4449 décès au cours de la période examinée, dont 293 
étaient liés au cancer, soit un taux de mortalité de 6,59 %. Il y avait 114 
hommes et 179 femmes soit un rapport homme/femme de 1:1,6. Le cancer du sein 
était la cause la plus fréquente de décès par cancer et représentait 61 (20,8 %) 
des décès dans la région. (20,8 %) des décès survenus pendant la période 
d’étude.
CONCLUSION: Le cancer est une cause majeure de mortalité au Nigeria. Le cancer 
du sein est la principale cause de mortalité par cancer chez les femmes et dans 
l’ensemble du pays, tandis que le cancer de la prostate reste le plus fréquent 
chez les hommes.

BACKGROUND: Due to the steadily increasing life expectancy of the population, 
the need for medical aids to maintain the previous quality of life is growing. 
The basis for independent mobility is a functional locomotor system. The hip 
joint can be so badly damaged by everyday wear or accelerated by illness that 
reconstruction by means of endoprostheses is necessary.
RESULTS: In order to ensure a high quality of life for the patient after this 
procedure as well as a long service life of the prosthesis, a high-quality 
design is required, so that many different aspects have to be taken into account 
when developing prostheses. Long-term medical studies show that the service life 
and operational safety of a hip prosthesis by best possible adaptation of the 
stiffness to that of the bone can be increased. The use of additive 
manufacturing processes enables to specifically change the stiffness of implant 
structures.
CONCLUSIONS: Reduced implant stiffness leads to an increase in stress in the 
surrounding bone and thus to a reduction in bone resorption. Numerical methods 
are used to demonstrate this fact in the hip implant developed. The safety of 
use is nevertheless ensured by evaluating and taking into account the stresses 
that occur for critical load cases. These results are a promising basis to 
enable longer service life of prostheses in the future.

BACKGROUND: To assess the spatiotemporal variation in female breast cancer 
attributable to low physical activity (LPA) at a global scale from 1990 to 2019, 
which is essential to promote physical activity, as well as prevent and control 
breast cancer.
METHODS: The number of deaths and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), and 
the corresponding age-standardized rates (ASMR and ASDR) of LPA-related breast 
cancer in 204 countries and territories from 1990 to 2019 were retrieved from 
the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019 to measure the related breast cancer 
burden by age and region. The estimated annual percentage change (EAPC) was 
calculated to quantify the secular trend in breast cancer burden rates.
RESULTS: From 1990 to 2019, globally, both breast cancer deaths and DALYs 
attributable to LPA nearly doubled, although the corresponding ASMR and ASDR 
decreased slightly, with EAPC of -0.46 (95% confidence interval: -0.52, -0.40) 
and -0.44 (95% confidence interval: -0.49, -0.39), respectively. The LPA-related 
breast cancer burden varied considerably across the world, with the 
highest-burden rates in Oceania, Tropical Latin America and Caribbean, and the 
fastest growth in North Africa and Middle East. The ASMR and ASDR showed a 
logarithmic association with the Socio-demographic Index, and a temporally 
upward trend in most of 204 countries regardless of the Socio-demographic Index 
or the ASMR in 1990.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite a decline in LPA-related breast cancer burden achieved in 
many countries during the last 3 decades like Bermuda, Myanmar, USA and China, 
an increase still occurred in most of 204 countries and territories, such as 
Solomon Islands, Equatorial Guinea, Japan and India. The findings can bring 
greater awareness to the importance of promoting physical activity for the local 
government to control the attributable breast cancer burden.

Ambient air pollution is among the most pressing environmental problems in our 
contemporary world that poses significant risks to global ecological and public 
health. This study analyzes cross-national heterogeneities in trajectories of 
death rates attributable to ambient air pollution. Compiling panel data from the 
Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study, the Direction of Trade Statistics (DOTS), 
and the World Development Indicators, we create a dataset that tracks 169 
countries from 1991 to 2017. Using growth curve models (GCMs), we estimate 
country-specific trajectories of death rates attributable to air pollution, and 
condition them on time-invariant and time-varying independent variables. The 
results suggest that while the global death rate attributable to air pollution 
has been continuously decreasing, there are heterogeneities in countries' death 
rate trajectories based on their geographic location and position in the world 
economy. High-income countries of the global North have perpetually witnessed 
lower death rates attributable to air pollution compared to middle- and 
low-income countries of the global South. Moreover, our results indicate that 
increased export to high-income countries, as a proxy for ecologically unequal 
exchange, leads to higher death rates from air pollution in middle- and 
low-income countries.

OBJECTIVE: The long-term survival differences between endovascular repair (EVAR) 
and open repair for abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) and specifically the 
impact of age on these differences remain a topic of debate. Therefore, we 
compared the long-term mortality between EVARand open abdominal aneurysm repair 
for patients of different ages.
METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of prospectively collected data 
from patients undergoing elective EVAR or open repair for infrarenal AAAs within 
the Vascular Quality Initiative multinational clinical registry (2003-2021). The 
primary outcome was long-term all-cause mortality comparing EVAR and open repair 
for patients aged less than 65 years, between 65 and 79 years, and those aged 80 
and older. In addition, we investigated the interaction between repair modality 
and 10-year hazard of mortality for sex, aneurysm diameter, and several 
preoperative comorbid conditions within each age category. To account for the 
nonrandom assignment of treatment, we used propensity scores and inverse 
probability weighted Cox proportional hazard analysis.
RESULTS: We identified 48,074 patients undergoing elective infrarenal abdominal 
aneurysm repair (89% EVAR) within the study period, including 7940 patients aged 
less than 65, 29,555 aged between 65 and 79, and 10,579 aged 80 years or more. 
EVAR was associated with a higher propensity score-adjusted long-term hazard of 
mortality compared with open repair in the cohort aged less than 65 years 
(hazard ratio [HR], 1.39; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.04-1.86; P = .026). 
The mortality was similar in the age cohort between 65 and 79 (HR, 0.94; 95% CI, 
0.79-1.10; P = .43), whereas EVAR was associated with a lower hazard of 
mortality in the cohort aged 80 years or more (HR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.46-0.86; P = 
.004). In patients aged less than 65 years, the hazard of mortality was higher 
with EVAR compared with open repair in those with female sex (HR, 4.40; 95% CI, 
1.75-11.0), an aneurysm diameter of more than 65 mm (HR, 2.19; 95% CI, 
1.11-4.34), and an absence of coronary artery disease (HR, 1.26; 95% CI, 
0.83-1.91), congestive heart failure (HR, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.03-1.92), and renal 
dysfunction (HR, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.04-2.05). In the patient cohort aged 80 and 
older, a lower hazard of mortality for EVAR versus open repair was observed for 
male patients or those with small aneurysms or certain comorbidities.
CONCLUSIONS: In a selected group of young patients with a substantial life 
expectancy, the long-term mortality is higher with EVAR compared with open 
repair for infrarenal AAAs. Long-term mortality with EVAR is similar in the 
middle cohort and lower in the elderly cohort compared with open repair.

The mitochondrial enzyme SIRT3 is an NAD+-dependent deacetylase important in 
cell metabolism, and a decline in its protein expression or activity has been 
linked with insulin resistance in obesity, ageing and type 2 diabetes. While 
studies in SIRT3 knockout mice have dramatically improved our understanding of 
the function of SIRT3, the impact of increasing SIRT3 levels remains 
under-examined. In this study we investigated the effects of liver-specific 
SIRT3 overexpression in mice on mitochondrial function and metabolic profile in 
both isolated hepatocytes and in vivo. Primary hepatocytes overexpressing SIRT3 
displayed increased oxygen consumption and a reduction in triglyceride 
accumulation. In mice with hepatic SIRT3 overexpression, increased fasting 
β-hydroxybutyrate levels were observed, coupled with an increase in oxygen 
consumption in isolated mitochondria and increased substrate utilization in 
liver homogenates. However, metabolic profiling of mice exposed to either chow 
or high-fat diet revealed no effect of hepatic SIRT3 overexpression on glucose 
tolerance, body composition or tissue triglyceride accumulation. These findings 
suggest limited whole-body benefit of increasing hepatic SIRT3 during the 
development of diet-induced insulin resistance.

INTRODUCTION: Patients with multiple chronic diseases suffer from reduced life 
expectancy. Care for these patients is often divided over multiple healthcare 
professionals. eHealth might help to integrate care for these patients and 
create a continuum. It is the primary purpose of this paper to describe an 
intervention that integrates first, second, and third line care in patients with 
multiple chronic conditions using remote monitoring, remote therapy and data 
automatization, all integrated in a virtual care center (VCC).
METHODS: Patients diagnosed with three or more chronic conditions are included 
and given smartphone compatible devices for remote monitoring and a tablet for 
video consultations. Patients will be followed-up by the VCC, consisting of 
nurses who will coordinate care, supervised by general practitioners and medical 
specialists. Data is reviewed on a daily basis and patients are contacted on a 
weekly basis. Review of data is automated by computer algorithms. Patients are 
contacted in case of outcome abnormalities in the data. Patients can contact the 
VCC at any time. Follow-up of the study is 1 year.
RESULTS: The primary outcome of this study is the median number of nights 
admitted to the hospital per patient compared to the hospitalization data 12 
months before enrolment. Secondary outcomes include all-cause mortality, event 
free survival, quality of life and satisfaction with technology and care.
CONCLUSION: This study presents the concept of a VCC that integrates first, 
second, and third line care into a virtual ward using remote monitoring and 
video consultation.

Potential Role of Ginger (Zingiber officinale Roscoe) in the Prevention of 
Neurodegenerative Diseases.

Ginger is composed of multiple bioactive compounds, including 6-gingerol, 
6-shogaol, 10-gingerol, gingerdiones, gingerdiols, paradols, 6-dehydrogingerols, 
5-acetoxy-6-gingerol, 3,5-diacetoxy-6-gingerdiol, and 12-gingerol, that 
contribute to its recognized biological activities. Among them, the major active 
compounds are 6-shogaol and 6-gingerol. Scientific evidence supports the 
beneficial properties of ginger, including antioxidant and anti-inflammatory 
capacities and in contrast, a specific and less studied bioactivity is the 
possible neuroprotective effect. The increase in life expectancy has raised the 
incidence of neurodegenerative diseases (NDs), which present common 
neuropathological features as increased oxidative stress, neuroinflammation and 
protein misfolding. The structure-activity relationships of ginger 
phytochemicals show that ginger can be a candidate to treat NDs by targeting 
different ligand sites. Its bioactive compounds may improve neurological 
symptoms and pathological conditions by modulating cell death or cell survival 
signaling molecules. The cognitive enhancing effects of ginger might be partly 
explained via alteration of both the monoamine and the cholinergic systems in 
various brain areas. Moreover, ginger decreases the production of inflammatory 
related factors. The aim of the present review is to summarize the effects of 
ginger in the prevention of major neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's 
disease, Parkinson's disease and multiple sclerosis.

BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer is a major public health problem in Latin America. 
Cost-effectiveness studies help stakeholders with decisions regarding human 
papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination programs, one of the main prevention measures. 
Our objective was to synthesize the results of cost-effectiveness studies of HPV 
vaccination in girls, to understand factors influencing cost-effectiveness in 
the region.
METHODS: We systematically searched databases as well as repositories from 
conferences, Ministries of Health and Health Technology Assessment offices. 
Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were extracted, with data 
converted to international dollars (I$) and inflated to 2019 values. We used the 
gross domestic product per capita as threshold for judging the 
cost-effectiveness of vaccination. We calculated the geometric mean ICER by type 
of vaccine, whether screening (cytology or HPV test) was used as comparator, 
effectiveness measure, perspective, source of funding, year of cost, and 
country.
RESULTS: We found 24 studies. Despite the methodological differences, most 
studies concluded that HPV vaccination of girls in Latin American countries was 
either cost-saving or cost-effective. The mean ICER was I$ 3,804 for the 
bivalent vaccine, I$ 640 for the quadrivalent and I$ 358 for a generic HPV-16/18 
vaccine. The mean ICER was lower in the studies that used HPV DNA test instead 
of cytology (I$ 122 vs I$ 1,841) as comparator; used the societal perspective 
(I$ 235 vs. I$ 1,986); were funded by non-profit sources instead of by 
pharmaceutical industry (I$ 421 vs. I$ 2,676); and used costs obtained prior to 
2008 (I$ 365 vs I$ 1,415). We observed great variation in the mean ICERs by 
effectiveness measure (I$ 402 for per disability adjusted life years, I$ 461 for 
life year saved, and I$ 1,795 for quality adjusted life years).
CONCLUSIONS: Most studies concluded that HPV vaccination of girls in Latin 
America countries was cost-saving or cost-effective, despite heterogeneity 
between models.

Experiencing Racism in Health Care: Stories from Health Care Professionals.

Wilder GA.

This symposium includes twelve personal narratives from individuals who have 
experienced racism in the workplace or during training. Racial minority health 
care professionals face discrimination in their clinical roles by patients, 
colleagues, supervisors, and instructors. Some of this behavior is overt and 
reveals conscious racial discrimination and structural historic racist policies. 
Other times, it is more subtle, supported by the unconscious bias of 
individuals, individual or systemic microaggressions or by institutional 
policies that may have been written to address more egregious acts. The problem 
of racism in health care has far-reaching implications for health care 
professionals, their patients, and society. Racism, bias, microaggressions, 
tokenism, and other forms of oppressive behaviors cut like a razor to the fabric 
that holds societies together. When unchallenged in healthcare, these acts fuel 
infant and maternal mortality, decrease life expectancy in communities of color, 
and result in a myriad of health disparities while limiting the pool of 
qualified minority (or other) providers allowed to serve.

Faced with the global crisis of COVID-19 and the strong increase in customer 
demands, competition is becoming more intense between companies, on the one 
hand, and supply chains on the other. This competition has led to the 
development of new strategies to manage demand and increase market share. Among 
these strategies are the growing interest in sustainable manufacturing and the 
need for customizable products that create an increasingly complex manufacturing 
environment. Sustainable manufacturing and the need for customizable products 
create an environment of increased competition and constant change. Indeed, 
companies are trying to establish more flexible and agile manufacturing systems 
through several systems of reconfiguration. Reconfiguration contributes to an 
extension of the manufacturing system's life cycle by modifying its physical, 
organizational and IT characteristics according to the changing market 
conditions. Due to the rapid development of new information technology (such as 
IoT, Big Data analytics, cyber-physical systems, cloud computing and artificial 
intelligence), digital twins have become intensively used in smart 
manufacturing. This paper proposes a digital twin design and simulation model 
for reconfigurable manufacturing systems (RMSs).

Postharvest deterioration of ginger rhizome caused by microorganisms or wound 
infections causes significant economic losses. Fusarium solani is one of the 
important causal agents of prevalent ginger disease soft rot across the world. 
The massive and continuous use of chemical fungicides in postharvest 
preservation pose risks to human health and produce environmental contamination. 
Hence, new alternative tools are required to reduce postharvest deterioration 
and extend the postharvest life of ginger. In this study, the use of silicon 
nanoparticles (SiNPs) on the storability of ginger rhizomes during postharvest 
storage and their resistance to Fusarium solani was investigated. The results 
showed that 50, 100, and 150 mg L-1 of SiNPs increased the firmness of the 
ginger rhizome during storage but decreased the decay severity, water loss, 
total color difference, and the reactive oxygen species (ROS; H2O2 and 
superoxide anion) accumulation. Specifically, 100 mg L-1 (SiNP100) demonstrated 
the best effect in the extension of postharvest life and improved the quality of 
the ginger rhizomes. SiNP100 application increased the activities of antioxidant 
enzymes (SOD and CAT) and the total phenolics and flavonoid contents, thereby 
reducing the ROS accumulation and malondialdehyde (MDA) content. Meanwhile, 
SiNP100 treatment negatively impacts the peroxidase (POD) and polyphenol oxidase 
(PPO) activities, which may have contributed to the lower level of lignin and 
decreased total color difference. SiNP100 likely decreased water loss and the 
transfer of water by altering the expression of aquaporin genes. Moreover, 
SiNP100 modulated the expression of lignin synthesis and phytopathogenic 
responses genes including MYB and LysM genes. Furthermore, SiNP100 inhibited 
Fusarium solani by preventing the penetration of hyphae into cells, thus 
decreasing the severity of postharvest pathogenic decay. In summary, this study 
revealed the physiology and molecular mechanisms of SiNPs-induced tolerance to 
postharvest deterioration and resistance to disease, which provides a foundation 
for using SiNPs resources as a promising alternative tool to maintain ginger 
quality and control postharvest diseases.

BACKGROUND: Myelofibrosis (MF) is a blood cancer associated with splenomegaly, 
blood count abnormalities, reduced life expectancy and high prevalence of 
disease-associated symptoms. Current treatment options for MF are diverse, with 
limited data on management strategies in real-world practice in the United 
Kingdom.
METHODS: The REALISM UK study was a multi-center, retrospective, 
non-interventional study, which documented the early management of patients with 
MF. The primary endpoint was the time from diagnosis to active treatment.
DISCUSSION: Two hundred patients were included (63% [n = 126/200] with primary 
MF; 37% [n = 74/200] with secondary MF). Symptoms and prognostic scores at 
diagnosis were poorly documented, with infrequent use of patient reported 
outcome measures. 'Watch and wait' was the first management strategy for 53.5% 
(n = 107/200) of patients, while the most commonly used active treatments were 
hydroxycarbamide and ruxolitinib. Only 5% of patients proceeded to allogeneic 
transplant. The median (IQR) time to first active treatment was 46 days (0-350); 
patients with higher risk disease were prescribed active treatment sooner.
CONCLUSION: These results provide insight into real-world clinical practice for 
patients with MF in the United Kingdom. Despite the known high prevalence of 
disease-associated symptoms in MF, symptoms were poorly documented. Most 
patients were initially observed or received hydroxycarbamide, and ruxolitinib 
was used as first-line management strategy in only a minority of patients.
PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY: Background: Myelofibrosis is a rare blood cancer 
associated with symptoms that can seriously affect a patient's daily life, such 
as enlarged spleen and decreased white and red blood cells. Although several 
treatments are available for patients with myelofibrosis, it is not clear which 
ones clinicians use most frequently.Methods: We aimed to review which treatments 
are usually given to patients with myelofibrosis in the UK, by collecting 
information from the medical records of 200 patients with myelofibrosis treated 
in different centres across the UK.Results: The results showed that the symptoms 
patients experienced were not always written down in the medical records. 
Similarly, clinical scores based on patient characteristics (which clinicians 
use to try to predict if a patient will respond to treatment well or not) were 
also missing from the medical records. Clinicians also rarely asked patients to 
complete questionnaires that try to measure the impact of myelofibrosis and its 
treatment on their health. The most common approach for patients with 
myelofibrosis in the UK was 'watch and wait', which over half of patients 
received. The most common drugs used for treatment were hydroxycarbamide and 
ruxolitinib; only a very small proportion of patients received a bone marrow 
transplant. On average, patients waited for 46 days before receiving a 
treatment, although patients considered to have a more aggressive type of 
disease received treatment sooner.Conclusion: The results of this study suggest 
that medical records can be missing key information, which is needed to decide 
which is the best way to treat a patient with myelofibrosis. They also suggest 
that clinicians in the UK prefer observation to treatment for a large number of 
patients with myelofibrosis. This could mean that the approach used for many 
patients with myelofibrosis does not help them to control symptoms that have an 
impact on their daily lives.

Risk for subsequent hypertension and cardiovascular disease after living kidney 
donation: is it clinically relevant?

Ferro CJ(1), Townend JN(1).

UK.

The first successful live donor kidney transplant was performed in 1954. 
Receiving a kidney transplant from a live kidney donor remains the best option 
for increasing both life expectancy and quality of life in patients with 
end-stage kidney disease. However, ever since 1954, there have been multiple 
questions raised on the ethics of live kidney donation in terms of negative 
impacts on donor life expectancy. Given the close relationship between reduced 
kidney function in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and hypertension, 
cardiovascular disease and cardiovascular mortality, information on the impact 
of kidney donation on these is particularly relevant. In this article, we review 
the existing evidence, focusing on the more recent studies on the impact of 
kidney donation on all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, cardiovascular 
disease and hypertension, as well as markers of cardiovascular damage including 
arterial stiffness and uraemic cardiomyopathy. We also discuss the similarities 
and differences between the pathological reduction in renal function that occurs 
in CKD, and the reduction in renal function that occurs because of a donor 
nephrectomy. Kidney donors perform an altruistic act that benefits individual 
patients as well as the wider society. They deserve to have high-quality 
evidence on which to make informed decisions.

Trends in coordination of rhenium organometallic complexes in the Protein Data 
Bank.

Radiopharmaceutical development has similar overall characteristics to any 
biomedical drug development requiring a compound's stability, aqueous solubility 
and selectivity to a specific disease site. However, organometallic complexes 
containing 188/186Re or 99mTc involve a d-block transition-metal radioactive 
isotope and therefore bring additional factors such as metal oxidation states, 
isotope purity and half life into play. This topical review is focused on the 
development of radiopharmaceuticals containing the radioisotopes of rhenium and 
technetium and, therefore, on the occurrence of these organometallic complexes 
in protein structures in the Worldwide Protein Data Bank (wwPDB). The purpose of 
incorporating the group 7 transition metals of rhenium/technetium in the protein 
and the reasons for study by protein crystallography are described, as certain 
PDB studies were not aimed at drug development. Technetium is used as a medical 
diagnostic agent and involves the 99mTc isotope which decays to release gamma 
radiation, thereby employed for its use in gamma imaging. Due to the periodic 
relationship among group 7 transition metals, the coordination chemistry of 
rhenium is similar (but not identical) to that of technetium. The types of 
reactions the potential model radiopharmaceutical would prefer to partake in, 
and by extension knowing which proteins and biomolecules the compound would 
react with in vivo, are needed. Crystallography studies, both small molecule and 
macromolecular, are a key aspect in understanding chemical coordination. 
Analyses of bonding modes, coordination to particular residues and 
crystallization conditions are presented. In our Forward look as a concluding 
summary of this topical review, the question we ask is: what is the best way for 
this field to progress?

OBJECTIVE: To extend life expectancy after surgery, patients with hip fractures 
need to improve their mobility quickly through postoperative rehabilitation. 
Voluntary hip joint motion supported by the hybrid assistive limb (HAL) lumbar 
type, an exoskeleton robot suit characterized by its ability to detect the 
wearer's intentions through the bioelectrical signals and assist hip extension 
motions at an optimal timing, may be effective to improve mobility in patients 
with hip joint dysfunction after surgery. We aimed to introduce rehabilitation 
using the HAL lumbar type in the early period after hip fracture surgery.
METHODS: Patients who underwent internal fixation for hip fracture at a single 
institution were prospectively enrolled. They received early postoperative 
rehabilitation (forward and backward bending of the lumbar spine, pelvic tilt 
forward and backward, standing up, and squatting) using the HAL lumbar type (six 
times a week for 15 min per session). Five-times-sit-to-stand (FTSS) and 
timed-up-and-go (TUG) tests were conducted at baseline before HAL rehabilitation 
(pre-HAL) and after the HAL rehabilitation (post-HAL) intervention.
RESULTS: We enrolled 14 patients (one man, 13 women) in this study. There were 
no adverse events, and all patients were able to complete the entire 
rehabilitation program. Post-HAL FTSS showed significant improvement compared 
with pre-HAL and had a large effect size of 1.81 (95% CI = 0.93 to 2.66) and 
sufficient power.
CONCLUSIONS: Robotic rehabilitation with HAL lumbar type could be introduced 
without adverse events, even in the early postoperative period following surgery 
for hip fracture. Further study is needed to develop an appropriate 
rehabilitation protocol using the HAL lumbar type.

Necrotizing fasciitis is a life-threatening infection that can be rapidly fatal. 
Early identification and emergent surgical management are essential to minimize 
morbidity and mortality. This case report describes a 25-year-old male who 
presented to the emergency department with a three-day history of worsening left 
lower dental infection and new-onset neck pain and swelling. He received 
broad-spectrum antibiotics and intravenous fluid resuscitation and underwent 
computed tomography of the neck and chest. Following intensive care unit 
admission, he underwent tooth extraction where intraoperative evaluation 
revealed subcutaneous crepitus. Immediate debridement was performed, revealing 
copious foul-smelling purulent discharge and necrotic tissue extending over the 
anterior chest wall and neck. During his hospital course, he underwent multiple 
debridements to manage the expanding infection. The final tissue defect was 
substantial, with deep dissection to muscle extending over the entire anterior 
surface of the rib cage to just inferior to the clavicles. This significant 
tissue defect was managed with skin grafts, and he was discharged home in stable 
condition. The patient is doing well almost a year after discharge. The key to 
our patient's survival was the early identification and debridement of the 
affected tissue. Our study reinforces the tenants of wound care and aggressive 
management required to bolster patient odds of survival in the setting of 
necrotizing fasciitis and underscores the importance of maintaining vigilance in 
patients presenting with dental infections. This study is unique in that our 
patient was young, with a past medical history significant for polydrug use, and 
the area of debridement was substantial.
