may explain the lack of significant gout-disease effects on gut microbial 
diversity at the population level. The lack of statistically significant 
difference between the gout patients and healthy controls at host population 
(cohort) level is different from the previous findings at individual level in 
the existing literature.

Access to care services in remote areas is challenging. The use of telemedicine 
technology in these areas facilitates access to health care. This study aimed to 
summarize the current research on telemedicine in remote areas such as mountains 
and forests. A systematic search was conducted in databases including Medline 
(through PubMed), Scopus, IEEE Xplore Digital Library, and ISI Web of Science to 
identify relevant studies published until May 12, 2021. Screening of retrieved 
articles for selection and inclusion in the study was performed based on the 
Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyzes extension for 
Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) checklist. A total of 807 articles were identified 
after removing duplicates, from which 20 studies meeting our inclusion criteria 
were selected. Challenges, opportunities, and equipment required to use 
telemedicine in remote areas were extracted from the selected studies. The 
results revealed that telemedicine implementation in remote areas had many 
challenges, including harsh weather conditions, Internet connectivity problems, 
difficult equipment transportation, and ethical issues. Telemedicine also has 
many benefits, such as cost and time savings for patients, improving patients' 
quality of life, and improving patient satisfaction. Telemedicine for 
inhabitants of forested and mountainous areas facilitates rapid access to health 
care and enhances patient satisfaction. Distinguishing advantages and barriers 
as well as reducing restrictions will have an essential role in accelerating the 
use of this technology.

STUDY QUESTION: What is the global, regional and national burden of polycystic 
ovary syndrome (PCOS), by age and socio-demographic index (SDI), over the period 
1990-2019?
SUMMARY ANSWER: In 2019, the global age-standardized point prevalence, incidence 
and years lived with disability (YLD) of PCOS were 30.4, 29.5 and 29.9 per 
100 000 population, respectively.
WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Data from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study 2017 
showed that the global age-standardized PCOS incidence rate increased 1.45% over 
the period 1990-2017.
STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: A systematic analysis of the PCOS prevalence, 
incidence and YLDs across 204 countries and territories was performed.
PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Data on the point prevalence, annual 
incidence and YLDs due to PCOS were retrieved from the GBD study 2019 for 204 
countries and territories from 1990 to 2019. The counts and age-standardized 
rates (per 100 000) are presented, along with their corresponding 95% 
uncertainty intervals (UIs).
MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: In 2019, the global age-standardized point 
prevalence and annual incidence rates for PCOS were 1677.8 (95% UI: 1166.0 to 
2192.4) and 59.8 (95% UI: 41.7 to 78.9) per 100 000, which represents a 30.4% 
and 29.5% increase since 1990, respectively. Moreover, the global 
age-standardized YLD rate in 2019 was 14.7 (6.3-29.5), an increase of 29.9% 
since 1990. In 2019, Italy (7897.0), Japan (6298.7) and New Zealand (5419.1) had 
the highest estimated age-standardized point prevalences of PCOS. Globally, the 
number of prevalent cases and the point prevalence of PCOS peaked in the 
25-29 years and 40-44 years age groups, respectively. Positive associations were 
found between the burden of PCOS and the SDI at the regional and national 
levels.
LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Variations in how PCOS was defined is a major 
limitation that prevents valid comparisons between different regions.
WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Globally, the burden of PCOS has increased 
at an alarming rate, making it a major public health concern. Increasing public 
awareness about this common condition, improving management options and 
increasing support to reduce factors which lead to further complications, need 
to be public health priorities.

OBJECTIVE: An increase in life expectancy has been attributed to better access 
to health care and viable treatment options for diseases where there were none 
before. However, a multiple-drug regimen increases the risk of inappropriate 
prescription and drug-related problems. This study aimed to investigate 
polypharmacy and inappropriate prescription among elderly patients in the Qassim 
region of Saudi Arabia.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective study wherein the electronic 
files of patients aged ≥ 60 years were reviewed and investigated for 
polypharmacy and inappropriate drug prescription using Beer's criteria 2019.
RESULTS: The 1123 patients who met the eligibility criteria were between 60-102 
years of age (mean age: 71.9 years). 387 patients (34.46%) used five 
medications, while the remaining patients used more than five medications. The 
prevalence of potentially inappropriate medications (PIMs) was 66.25%. The most 
commonly prescribed PIMs were non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, baclofen, 
proton pump inhibitors, diuretics, and aspirin (11.3%, 10.6%, 10.1%, 8.46%, and 
5.6%, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: This study showed a high prevalence of polypharmacy, which 
consequently led to a high prevalence of PIMs. This is a serious health problem 
in the elderly population and should be prevented or tackled with caution.

AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: The study aims to quantify the global trend of the disease 
burden of type 2 diabetes caused by various risks factors by country income 
tiers.
METHODS: Data on type 2 diabetes, including mortality and disability-adjusted 
life years (DALYs) during 1990-2019, were obtained from the Global Burden of 
Disease Study 2019. We analysed mortality and DALY rates and the population 
attributable fraction (PAF) in various risk factors of type 2 diabetes by 
country income tiers.
RESULTS: Globally, the age-standardised death rate (ASDR) attributable to type 2 
diabetes increased from 16.7 (15.7, 17.5)/100,000 person-years in 1990 to 18.5 
(17.2, 19.7)/100,000 person-years in 2019. Similarly, age-standardised DALY 
rates increased from 628.3 (537.2, 730.9)/100,000 person-years to 801.5 (670.6, 
954.4)/100,000 person-years during 1990-2019. Lower-middle-income countries 
reported the largest increase in the average annual growth of ASDR (1.3%) and an 
age-standardised DALY rate (1.6%) of type 2 diabetes. The key PAF attributing to 
type 2 diabetes deaths/DALYs was high BMI in countries of all income tiers. With 
the exception of BMI, while in low- and lower-middle-income countries, risk 
factors attributable to type 2 diabetes-related deaths and DALYs are mostly 
environment-related, the risk factors in high-income countries are mostly 
lifestyle-related.
CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Type 2 diabetes disease burden increased globally, 
but low- and middle-income countries showed the highest growth rate. A high BMI 
level remained the key contributing factor in all income tiers, but 
environmental and lifestyle-related factors contributed differently across 
income tiers.

BACKGROUND: Economic evidence for comparing low fraction with ultra-hypo 
fractionated (UHF) radiation therapy in the treatment of 
intermediate-to-high-risk prostate cancer (PC) is lacking, especially in Europe. 
This study presents an economic evaluation performed alongside an ongoing 
clinical trial.
AIM: To investigate up to 6 years' follow-up whether conventional fractionation 
(CF, 78.0 Gy in 39 fractions, 5 days per week for 8 weeks) is more 
cost-effective than UHF (42.7 Gy in 7 fractions, 3 days per week for 2.5 weeks 
inclusive of 2 weekends) radiotherapy in treatment for patients with 
intermediate-to-high-risk PC.
METHOD: HYPO-RT-PC trial is an open-label, randomized, multicenter (10 in 
Sweden; 2 in Denmark) phase-3 trial. Patients from Sweden (CF 434; UHF 445) were 
included in this study. The trial database was linked to the National Patient 
Registry (NPR). Costs for inpatient/non-primary outpatient care for each episode 
were retrieved. For calculating Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), the EORTC 
QLQ-C30 questionnaire was mapped to the EQ-5D-3L index. Multivariable regression 
analyses were used to compare the difference in costs and QALYs, adjusting for 
age and baseline costs, and health status. The confidence interval for the 
difference in costs, QALYs and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
effectiveness ratio (ICER) was estimated by the bootstrap percentile method.
RESULTS: No significant differences were found in ICER between the two arms 
after 6 years of follow-up.
CONCLUSION: The current study did not support that the ultra-hypo-fractionated 
treatment was more cost-effective than the conventional fraction treatment up to 
the sixth year of the trial.

Herein, we propose a new strategy to tune the magnitude of the mechanoresponsive 
shift of the maximum emission wavelength (Δλem). The Δλem of 
thienylbenzothiadiazole crystals has been extended to 69 nm by doping with a 
trace amount of dithienylbenzothiadiazole, whereas the pure crystal of 
thienylbenzothiadiazole exhibited a Δλem of 10 nm. This doping strategy should 
accelerate the development of advanced mechanosensing materials composed of 
organic crystals.

PURPOSE: Intrathecal (IT) idursulfase-IT for the treatment of cognitive 
impairment is being investigated in pediatric patients with neuronopathic 
mucopolysaccharidosis II (MPS II) in addition to intravenous idursulfase. In 
this article, we report the findings for 54 months of idursulfase-IT treatment 
in an ongoing phase I/II extension trial (NCT01506141).
METHODS: A total of 15 male participants with neuronopathic MPS II (aged 3-11 
years at enrollment) who were previously treated with intravenous idursulfase 
entered the extension study. Idursulfase-IT 10 mg or 30 mg was administered 
monthly via an IT drug delivery device or lumbar puncture, if indicated. The 
primary endpoint was safety and tolerability; secondary endpoints included 
pharmacokinetics, cerebrospinal fluid glycosaminoglycan levels, and cognitive 
function.
RESULTS: In total, 15 participants received a median (range) of 50 (18-55) 
idursulfase-IT doses. Idursulfase-IT was generally well tolerated; there were no 
life-threatening adverse events (AEs) or deaths. Most serious AEs were related 
to the IT drug delivery device; only 2 serious AEs were related solely to 
idursulfase-IT. After treatment with idursulfase-IT, cerebrospinal fluid 
glycosaminoglycans were decreased in all participants; these decreases were 
maintained. Cognitive function was stabilized in 3 of 4 testable participants at 
month 55.
CONCLUSION: These long-term results support the clinical development of 
idursulfase-IT for patients with MPS II with cognitive impairment.

BACKGROUND: The available data to determine the chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease (COPD) burden in Saudi Arabia are scarce. Therefore, this study closely 
examines and tracks the trends of the COPD burden in Saudi Arabia from 1990 to 
2019 using the dataset of the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2019.
METHODS: This study used the GBD 2019 dataset to analyse the COPD prevalence, 
incidence, morbidity and mortality rates in the Saudi Arabian population from 
1990 to 2019, stratified by sex and age. The age-standardised rate was used to 
determine the prevalence, incidence, years of life lost (YLLs), years lived with 
disability (YLDs), disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and deaths.
RESULTS: In 2019, an estimated 434,560.64 people (95% Uncertainty Interval (UI) 
396,011.72-473,596.71) had COPD in Saudi Arabia, corresponding to an increase of 
329.82% compared with the number of diagnosed people in 1990 [101,104.05 (95% UI 
91,334.4-111,223.91)]. The prevalence rate of COPD increased by 49%, from 
1,381.26 (1,285.35-1,484.96) cases per 100,000 in 1990 to 2,053.04 
(1918.06-2194.29) cases per 100,000 in 2019, and this trend was higher in males 
than females. The incidence rate of COPD in 2019 was 145.06 (136.62-154.76) new 
cases per 100,000, representing an increase of 43.4% from the 1990 incidence 
rate [101.18 (95.27-107.86)]. In 2019, the DALYs rate was 508.15 (95% UI 
434.85-581.58) per 100,000 population. This was higher in males than females, 
with a 14.12% increase among males. In 2019, YLLs contributed to 63.6% of DALYs 
due to COPD. The death rate due to COPD was 19.6 (95% UI 15.94-23.39) deaths per 
100 000 in 2019, indicating a decrease of 41.44% compared with the death rate in 
1990 [33.55 deaths per 100 000 (95% UI 25.13-47.69)]. In 2019, COPD deaths 
accounted for 1.65% (1.39-1.88) of the total of deaths in Saudi Arabia and 57% 
of all deaths caused by chronic respiratory diseases.
CONCLUSION: Over the period 1990-2019, the prevalence and incidence of COPD in 
Saudi Arabia have been steadily rising. Even though COPD morbidity and death 
rates have been decreasing, they remain higher in men and older age. The 
holistic assessment and interventions with careful attention to optimising the 
community-based primary care management, such as screening for early diagnosis, 
smoking cessation programs and pulmonary rehabilitation, are likely to be the 
most successful strategies to reduce the burden of COPD in Saudi Arabia.

In recent years, advances in the treatment and management of patients with 
systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) have improved their life expectancy and 
quality of life. However, lupus nephritis (LN) still represents a major 
life-threatening complication of the disease. Belimumab (BEL), a fully human 
monoclonal IgG1λ antibody neutralizing soluble B cell activating factor, was 
approved more than ten years ago as add-on therapy in adults and pediatric 
patients with a highly active, autoantibody-positive disease despite standard of 
care (SoC). Recently, the superiority of the addition of BEL to SoC was also 
demonstrated in LN. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the 
study landscape, available therapeutic options for SLE (focusing on BEL in renal 
and non-renal SLE), and new perspectives in the treatment field of this disease. 
A personalized treatment approach will likely become available with the advent 
of novel therapeutic agents for SLE and LN.

BACKGROUND: Treatment options for malignant pleural mesothelioma are scarce. 
Tazemetostat, a selective oral enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) inhibitor, has 
shown antitumour activity in several haematological cancers and solid tumours. 
We aimed to evaluate the anti-tumour activity and safety of tazemetostat in 
patients with measurable relapsed or refractory malignant pleural mesothelioma.
METHODS: We conducted an open-label, single-arm phase 2 study at 16 hospitals in 
France, the UK, and the USA. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older with 
malignant pleural mesothelioma of any histology that was relapsed or refractory 
after treatment with at least one pemetrexed-containing regimen, an Eastern 
Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1, and a life expectancy 
of greater than 3 months. In part 1 of the study, participants received oral 
tazemetostat 800 mg once on day 1 and then twice daily from day 2 onwards. In 
part 2, participants received oral tazemetostat 800 mg twice daily starting on 
day 1 of cycle 1, using a two-stage Green-Dahlberg design. Tazemetostat was 
administered in 21-day cycles for approximately 17 cycles. The primary endpoint 
of part 1 was the pharmacokinetics of tazemetostat and its metabolite at day 15 
after administration of 800 mg tazemetostat, as measured by maximum serum 
concentration (Cmax), time to Cmax (Tmax), area under the concentration-time 
curve (AUC) to day 15 (AUC0-t), area under the curve from time 0 extrapolated to 
infinity (AUC0-∞), and the half-life (t1/2) of tazemetostat, assessed in all 
patients enrolled in part 1. The primary endpoint of part 2 was the disease 
control rate (the proportion of patients with a complete response, partial 
response, or stable disease) at week 12 in patients with malignant pleural 
mesothelioma per protocol with BAP1 inactivation determined by 
immunohistochemistry. The safety population included all the patients who had at 
least one post-dose safety assessment. This trial is now complete and is 
registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02860286.
FINDINGS: Between July 29, 2016, and June 2, 2017, 74 patients were enrolled (13 
in part 1 and 61 in part 2) and received tazemetostat, 73 (99%) of whom had 
BAP1-inactivated tumours. In part 1, following repeat dosing of tazemetostat at 
steady state, on day 15 of cycle 1, the mean Cmax was 829 ng/mL (coefficient of 
variation 56·3%), median Tmax was 2 h (range 1-4), mean AUC0-twas 3310 h·ng/mL 
(coefficient of variation 50·4%), mean AUC0-∞ was 3180 h·ng/mL (46·6%), and the 
geometric mean t1/2 was 3·1 h (13·9%). After a median follow-up of 35·9 weeks 
(IQR 20·6-85·9), the disease control rate in part 2 in patients with 
BAP1-inactivated malignant pleural mesothelioma was 54% (95% CI 42-67; 33 of 61 
patients) at week 12. No patients had a confirmed complete response. Two 
patients had a confirmed partial response: one had an ongoing partial response 
with a duration of 18 weeks and the other had a duration of 42 weeks. The most 
common grade 3-4 treatment-emergent adverse events were hyperglycaemia (five 
[7%] patients), hyponatraemia (five [7%]), and anaemia (four [5%]); serious 
adverse events were reported in 25 (34%) of 74 patients. Five (7%) of 74 
patients died while on study; no treatment-related deaths occurred.
INTERPRETATION: Further refinement of biomarkers for tazemetostat activity in 
malignant pleural mesothelioma beyond BAP1 inactivation could help identify a 
subset of tumours that are most likely to derive prolonged benefit or shrinkage 
from this therapy.

L-type Ca2+ (CaV1) channels transduce channel activities into nuclear signals 
critical to neuritogenesis. Also, standalone peptides encoded by CaV1 DCT 
(distal carboxyl-terminus) act as nuclear transcription factors reportedly 
promoting neuritogenesis. Here, by focusing on exemplary CaV1.3 and cortical 
neurons under basal conditions, we discover that cytosolic DCT peptides 
downregulate neurite outgrowth by the interactions with CaV1's apo-calmodulin 
binding motif. Distinct from nuclear DCT, various cytosolic peptides exert a 
gradient of inhibitory effects on Ca2+ influx via CaV1 channels and neurite 
extension and arborization, and also the intermediate events including CREB 
activation and c-Fos expression. The inhibition efficacies of DCT are 
quantitatively correlated with its binding affinities. Meanwhile, cytosolic 
inhibition tends to facilitate neuritogenesis indirectly by favoring 
Ca2+-sensitive nuclear retention of DCT. In summary, DCT peptides as a class of 
CaV1 inhibitors specifically regulate the channel activity-neuritogenesis 
coupling in a variant-, affinity-, and localization-dependent manner.

OBJECTIVE: Two EQ-5D-3L (3L) value sets (developed in 2014 and 2018) co-exist in 
China. The study examined the level of agreement between index scores for all 
the 243 health states derived from them at both absolute and relative levels and 
compared the responsiveness of the two indices.
METHODS: Intraclass correlations coefficient (ICC) and Bland-Altman plot were 
adopted to assess the degree of agreement between the two indices at the 
absolute level. Health gains for 29,403 possible transitions between pairs of 3L 
health states were calculated to assess the agreement at the relative level. 
Their responsiveness for the transitions was assessed using Cohen effect size.
RESULTS: The mean (SD) value was 0.427 (0.206) and 0.649 (0.189) for the 3L2014 
and 3L2018 index scores, respectively. Although the ICC value showed good 
agreement (i.e., 0.896), 88.9% (216/243) of the points were beyond the minimum 
important difference limit according to the Bland-Altman plot. The mean health 
gains for the 29,403 health transitions was 0.234 (3L2014 index score) and 0.216 
(3L2018 index score). The two indices predicted consistent transitions in 23,720 
(80.7%) of 29,403 pairs. For the consistent pairs, Cohen effective size value 
was 1.05 (3L2014 index score) or 1.06 (3L2018 index score); and the 3L2014 index 
score only yielded 0.007 more utility gains. However, the results based on the 
two measures varied substantially according to the direction and magnitude of 
health change.
CONCLUSION: The 3L2014 and 3L2018 index scores are not interchangeable. The 
choice between them is likely to influence QALYs estimations.

When Is Mass Prophylaxis Cost-Effective for Epidemic Control? A Comparison of 
Decision Approaches.

Malloy GSP(1), Brandeau ML(1).

Author information:
(1)Department of Management Science and Engineering, Stanford University, 
Stanford, CA, USA.

BACKGROUND: For certain communicable disease outbreaks, mass prophylaxis of 
uninfected individuals can curtail new infections. When an outbreak emerges, 
decision makers could benefit from methods to quickly determine whether mass 
prophylaxis is cost-effective. We consider 2 approaches: a simple decision model 
and machine learning meta-models. The motivating example is plague in 
Madagascar.
METHODS: We use a susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed (SEIR) epidemic model 
to derive a decision rule based on the fraction of the population infected, 
effective reproduction ratio, infection fatality rate, quality-adjusted 
life-year loss associated with death, prophylaxis effectiveness and cost, time 
horizon, and willingness-to-pay threshold. We also develop machine learning 
meta-models of a detailed model of plague in Madagascar using logistic 
regression, random forest, and neural network models. In numerical experiments, 
we compare results using the decision rule and the meta-models to results 
obtained using the simulation model. We vary the initial fraction of the 
population infected, the effective reproduction ratio, the intervention start 
date and duration, and the cost of prophylaxis.
LIMITATIONS: We assume homogeneous mixing and no negative side effects due to 
antibiotic prophylaxis.
RESULTS: The simple decision rule matched the SEIR model outcome in 85.4% of 
scenarios. Using data for a 2017 plague outbreak in Madagascar, the decision 
rule correctly indicated that mass prophylaxis was not cost-effective. The 
meta-models were significantly more accurate, with an accuracy of 92.8% for 
logistic regression, 95.8% for the neural network model, and 96.9% for the 
random forest model.
CONCLUSIONS: A simple decision rule using minimal information about an outbreak 
can accurately evaluate the cost-effectiveness of mass prophylaxis for outbreak 
mitigation. Meta-models of a complex disease simulation can achieve higher 
accuracy but with greater computational and data requirements and less 
interpretability.
HIGHLIGHTS: We use a susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed model and net 
monetary benefit to derive a simple decision rule to evaluate the 
cost-effectiveness of mass prophylaxis.We use the example of plague in 
Madagascar to compare the performance of the analytically derived decision rule 
to that of machine learning meta-models trained on a stochastic dynamic 
transmission model.We assess the accuracy of each approach for different 
combinations of disease dynamics and intervention scenarios.The machine learning 
meta-models are more accurate predictors of mass prophylaxis cost-effectiveness. 
However, the simple decision rule is also accurate and may be a preferred 
substitute in low-resource settings.

Molecular Testing for Thyroid Nodules of Indeterminate Cytology: A Health 
Technology Assessment.

Ontario Health (Quality).

Collaborators: Vandersluis S, Holubowich C, Li C, Xie X, Wells D.

BACKGROUND: The thyroid is a gland in the lower neck that is responsible for 
secreting hormones related to growth and metabolism. A cancer growth in the 
thyroid can spread to other parts of the body, but most thyroid nodules 
(growths) are benign, and some types of thyroid cancer are nonaggressive and can 
be managed with active surveillance only. We conducted a health technology 
assessment of molecular testing in people with thyroid nodules of indeterminate 
cytology, which included an evaluation of diagnostic accuracy, clinical utility, 
cost-effectiveness, the budget impact of publicly funding molecular testing, and 
patient preferences and values.
METHODS: We performed a systematic literature search of the clinical evidence. 
We assessed the risk of bias of each included study using the Risk of Bias Among 
Systematic Review (ROBIS) tool for systematic reviews, the Quality Assessment of 
Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 (QUADAS-2) assessment for primary studies that 
evaluated diagnostic accuracy, and the Risk of Bias tool for Non-randomized 
Studies (RoBANS) for primary studies that evaluated clinical utility. We 
evaluated the quality of the body of evidence according to the Grading of 
Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) Working Group 
criteria. We performed a systematic economic literature review and conducted 
cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses with a 5-year time horizon from the 
Ontario Ministry of Health perspective. We also analyzed the budget impact of 
publicly funding molecular testing in people with thyroid nodules of 
indeterminate cytology in Ontario. To contextualize the potential value of 
molecular testing in people with thyroid nodules of indeterminate cytology, we 
spoke to people with thyroid nodules.
RESULTS: In the clinical evidence review, we included one systematic review, 
which contained eight relevant primary studies. Using molecular testing to 
support the rule-out of cancer in thyroid nodules of indeterminate significance 
may reduce the number of unnecessary surgeries. For diagnostic accuracy, 
molecular testing for a diagnosis of malignancy in a nodule of indeterminate 
significance had a sensitivity of 91% to 94% and a specificity of 68% to 82% 
(GRADE: Low). As well, lower rates of surgical resections were reported in 
nodules of indeterminate cytology (GRADE: Very Low). Compared to diagnostic 
lobectomy, we found that molecular testing would increase the probability of 
predicting a correct diagnosis, reduce the probability of unnecessary surgery, 
and lead to a slight improvement in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), but it 
would increase costs. The resulting incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was 
$220,572 to $298,653 per QALY gained. At the commonly used willingness-to-pay 
values of $50,000 and $100,000 per QALY gained, molecular testing was unlikely 
to be cost-effective (probability of molecular testing being cost-effective was 
less than 50%). Publicly funding molecular testing in Ontario over the next 5 
years would lead to an additional cost of $6.24 million. People with thyroid 
nodules of indeterminate cytology reported on the benefits and drawbacks of 
molecular testing, as well as barriers to accessing and choosing to undergo 
molecular testing.
CONCLUSIONS: For thyroid nodules of indeterminate cytology, molecular testing 
may have diagnostic accuracy as a rule-out test, and it may result in fewer 
nodule resections than usual care (no molecular testing). For people with 
thyroid nodules of indeterminate cytology, molecular testing at the current list 
price is unlikely to be cost-effective compared to diagnostic lobectomy. 
Publicly funding molecular testing in Ontario would cost about $6.24 million 
over the next 5 years. People with thyroid nodules of indeterminate cytology 
valued the information that could be provided by molecular testing, but they 
expressed concern about the time required to obtain results, especially if the 
findings were not conclusive or useful for treatment decision-making.

While great progress has been made in transplantation medicine, long-term graft 
failure and serious side effects still pose a challenge in kidney 
transplantation. Effective and safe long-term treatments are needed. Therefore, 
evidence of the lasting benefit-risk of novel therapies is required. 
Demonstrating superiority of novel therapies is unlikely via conventional 
randomized controlled trials, as long-term follow-up in large sample sizes pose 
statistical and operational challenges. Furthermore, endpoints generally 
accepted in short-term clinical trials need to be translated to real-world (RW) 
care settings, enabling robust assessments of novel treatments. Hence, there is 
an evidence gap that calls for innovative clinical trial designs, with RW 
evidence (RWE) providing an opportunity to facilitate longitudinal transplant 
research with timely translation to clinical practice. Nonetheless, the current 
RWE landscape shows considerable heterogeneity, with few registries capturing 
detailed data to support the establishment of new endpoints. The main 
recommendations by leading scientists in the field are increased collaboration 
between registries for data harmonization and leveraging the development of 
technology innovations for data sharing under high privacy standards. This will 
aid the development of clinically meaningful endpoints and data models, enabling 
future long-term research and ultimately establish optimal long-term outcomes 
for transplant patients.
