METHODS: We used pooled data from the SURGENE, GENEDIAB, and GENESIS prospective 
cohorts. Data were divided into: 1/absence of CVD (myocardial infarction and/or 
stroke) nor LLA, 2/history of CVD alone without LLA, 3/LLA alone without CVD or 
4/both conditions at baseline. Participants with baseline history of peripheral 
artery disease were excluded from groups 1 and 2. The study endpoint was any 
death occurring during follow-up, regardless of the causes.
RESULTS: Among 1169 participants (male 55%, age 40 ± 13 years, diabetes duration 
23 ± 11 years), CVD, LLA or both were present at baseline in 49 (4.2%), 62 
(5.3%) and 20 (1.7%) subjects, respectively. All-cause death occurred in 304 
(26%) participants during 17-year follow-up, corresponding to 18,426 
person-years and an incidence rate of 16 (95%CI, 15-18) per 1000 person-years. 
The risk of death increased in individuals with baseline history of CVD 
(adjusted HR 2.00 [95% CI 1.34-3.01], p = 0.0008) or LLA (2.26 [1.56-3.28], 
p < 0.0001), versus no condition, with an additive effect in people with both 
conditions (5.32 [3.14-9.00], p < 0.0001). No incremental risk of death was 
observed in people with CVD versus LLA (0.87 [0.54-1.41]). Compared with no 
condition, CVD and LLA were similarly associated with reduced life expectancy 
during follow-up: 2.79 (95% CI 1.26-4.32) and 3.38 (1.87-4.88) years, 
respectively. Combined conditions expose to 7.04 (4.76-9.31) less years of life 
expectancy (all p < 0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: CVD and LLA conferred a similar burden regarding mortality in type 
1 diabetes population. Our findings encourage a careful consideration of people 
with type 1 diabetes and LLA as usually recommended for those with CVD, in terms 
of management of risk factors, treatments and prevention.

The study of the mortality differences between groups has traditionally focused 
on metrics that describe average levels of mortality, for example life 
expectancy and standardized mortality rates. Additional insights can be gained 
by using statistical distance metrics to examine differences in lifespan 
distributions between groups. Here, we use a distance metric, the non-overlap 
index, to capture the sociological concept of stratification, which emphasizes 
the emergence of unique, hierarchically layered social strata. We show an 
application using Finnish registration data that cover the entire population 
over the period from 1996 to 2017. The results indicate that lifespan 
stratification and life-expectancy differences between income groups both 
increased substantially from 1996 to 2008; subsequently, life-expectancy 
differences declined, whereas stratification stagnated for men and increased for 
women. We conclude that the non-overlap index uncovers a unique domain of 
inequalities in mortality and helps to capture important between-group 
differences that conventional approaches miss.

BACKGROUND: Populations around the world are rapidly ageing. The profile of skin 
diseases in the elderly is likely to present unique demands on the healthcare 
system.
OBJECTIVES: To provide current data on the burden of skin diseases in 
Singaporean patients and identify differences in the pattern of skin diseases 
between elderly patients and the rest of the population.
METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of 858 117 patients who attended 
the National Skin Centre between 2004 and 2018. Prevalence was calculated by 
grouping International Classification of Diseases codes into different 
categories of skin conditions based on Global Burden of Disease and American 
Academy of Dermatology classifications. Years lost to disability (YLDs) and 
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) were calculated to report the morbidity 
and mortality of skin diseases. Differences of each skin condition between age 
groups were compared.
RESULTS: The three most prevalent dermatoses across all age groups were 
dermatitis (33.3%), acne vulgaris (8.3%) and viral skin diseases (7.5%). The top 
three most common skin conditions among the elderly were dermatitis (37.7%), 
viral skin diseases (6.2%) and fungal skin diseases (4.3%). Decubitus ulcers, 
keratinocyte carcinomas and scabies represented a significant proportion of YLD 
per 100 000 in the elderly (P < 0.001). Malignant melanomas, keratinocyte 
carcinomas, cellulitis, pyoderma and decubitus ulcers contributed to high DALYs 
in patients aged 70-80 years.
CONCLUSION: Aligning health systems with specific healthcare needs will reduce 
the disproportionately high burden of skin disease observed in the elderly.

AIMS: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition, with 
symptoms appearing in the early developmental period. Little is known about its 
current burden at the global, regional and national levels. This systematic 
analysis aims to summarise the latest magnitudes and temporal trends of ASD 
burden, which is essential to facilitate more detailed development of prevention 
and intervention strategies.
METHODS: The data on ASD incidence, prevalence, disability-adjusted life years 
(DALYs) in 204 countries and territories between 1990 and 2019 came from the 
Global Burden of Disease Study 2019. The average annual percentage change was 
calculated to quantify the secular trends in age-standardised rates (ASRs) of 
ASD burden by region, sex and age.
RESULTS: In 2019, there were an estimated 60.38 × 104 [95% uncertainty interval 
(UI) 50.17-72.01] incident cases of ASD, 283.25 × 105 (95% UI 235.01-338.11) 
prevalent cases and 43.07 × 105 (95% UI 28.22-62.32) DALYs globally. The ASR of 
incidence slightly increased by around 0.06% annually over the past three 
decades, while the ASRs of prevalence and DALYs both remained stable over the 
past three decades. In 2019, the highest burden of ASD was observed in 
high-income regions, especially in high-income North America, high-income Asia 
Pacific and Western Europe, where a significant growth in ASRs was also 
observed. The ASR of ASD burden in males was around three times that of females, 
but the gender difference was shrunk with the pronounced increase among females. 
Of note, among the population aged over 65 years, the burden of ASD presented 
increasing trends globally.
CONCLUSIONS: The global burden of ASD continues to increase and remains a major 
mental health concern. These substantial heterogeneities in ASD burden worldwide 
highlight the need for making suitable mental-related policies and providing 
special social and health services.

In extension of Single-RunKing to analyze multiple correlated traits, mvRunKing 
not only enlarged number of the analyzed phenotypes with canonical 
transformation, but also improved statistical power to detect pleiotropic QTNs 
through joint association analysis. Based on genomic variance-covariance 
matrices, we simplified multivariate mixed model association analysis to 
multiple univariate ones by using canonical transformation, and then 
individually implemented univariate association tests in the Single-RunKing. 
which enlarged number of the analyzed phenotypes. With canonical transformation 
back to the original scale, the association results would be biologically 
interpretable. Especially, we rapidly estimated genomic variance-covariance 
matrices with multivariate GEMMA and optimized separately the polygenic 
variances (or heritabilities) for only the markers that had large effects or 
higher significance levels in univariate mixed models, greatly improving 
computing efficiency for multiple univariate association tests. Beyond one test 
at once, joint association analysis for quantitative trait nucleotide (QTN) 
candidates can significantly increase statistical powers to detect QTNs. A 
user-friendly mvRunKing software was developed to efficiently implement 
multivariate mixed model association analyses.

Despite increased life expectancy due to health care quality improvements 
globally, pyogenic vertebral osteomyelitis (PVO) treatment with a spinal 
epidural abscess (SEA) remains challenging in patients older than 80 years. We 
aimed to assess octogenarians for PVO prevalence with SEA and compare 
after-surgery clinical outcomes of decompression and decompression and 
instrumentation. A retrospective review of electronic medical records at a 
single institution was conducted between September 2005 and December 2020. 
Patient demographics, surgical characteristics, complications, hospital course, 
and 90-day mortality were collected. Comorbidities were assessed using the 
age-adjusted Charlson comorbidity index (CCI). Over 16 years, 35 patients aged 
≥80 years with PVO and SEA were identified. Eighteen patients underwent surgical 
decompression ("decompression group"), and 17 underwent surgical decompression 
with instrumentation ("instrumentation group"). Both groups had a CCI >6 
(mean±SD, 8.9±2.1 vs. 9.6±2.7, respectively; p=0.065). Instrumentation group 
patients had a significantly longer hospital stay but no ICU stay. In-hospital 
and 90-days mortality rates were similar in both groups. The mean follow-up was 
26.6±12.4 months. No further surgeries were performed. Infection levels and 
neurological status were improved in both groups at discharge. At the 
second-stage analysis, significant improvements in the blood infection 
parameters and the neurological status were detected in the decompression group. 
Octogenarians with PVO and SEA have a high adverse events risk after surgical 
procedures. Surgical decompression might contribute to earlier clinical recovery 
in older patients. Thus, the surgical approach should be discussed with patients 
and their relatives and be carefully weighed.

IMPORTANCE: The cost-effectiveness of the Self-Help Plus (SH+) program, a 
group-based, guided, self-help psychological intervention developed by the World 
Health Organization for people affected by adversity, is unclear.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the cost-utility of providing the SH+ intervention 
combined with enhanced usual care vs enhanced usual care alone for Syrian 
refugees or asylum seekers hosted in Turkey.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This economic evaluation was performed as a 
prespecified part of an assessor-blinded randomized clinical trial conducted 
between October 1, 2018, and November 30, 2019, with 6-month follow-up. A total 
of 627 adults with psychological distress but no diagnosed psychiatric disorder 
were randomly assigned to the intervention group or the enhanced usual care 
group.
INTERVENTIONS: The SH+ program was a 5-session (2 hours each), group-based, 
stress management course in which participants learned self-help skills for 
managing stress by listening to audio sessions. The SH+ sessions were 
facilitated by briefly trained, nonspecialist individuals, and an illustrated 
book was provided to group members. Th intervention group received the SH+ 
intervention plus enhanced usual care; the control group received only enhanced 
usual care from the local health care system. Enhanced usual care included 
access to free health care services provided by primary and secondary 
institutions plus details on nongovernmental organizations and freely available 
mental health services, social services, and community networks for people under 
temporary protection of Turkey and refugees.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome measure was incremental cost per 
quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained from the perspective of the Turkish 
health care system. An intention-to-treat analysis was used including all 
participants who were randomized and for whom baseline data on costs and QALYs 
were available. Data were analyzed September 30, 2020, to July 30, 2021.
RESULTS: Of 627 participants (mean [SD] age, 31.3 [9.0] years; 393 [62.9%] 
women), 313 were included in the analysis for the SH+ group and 314 in the 
analysis for the enhanced usual care group. An incremental cost-utility ratio 
estimate of T£6068 ($1147) per QALY gained was found when the SH+ intervention 
was provided to groups of 10 Syrian refugees. At a willingness to pay per QALY 
gained of T£14 831 ($2802), the SH+ intervention had a 97.5% chance of being 
cost-effective compared with enhanced usual care alone.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This economic evaluation suggests that implementation 
of the SH+ intervention compared with enhanced usual care alone for adult Syrian 
refugees or asylum seekers hosted in Turkey is cost-effective from the 
perspective of the Turkish health care system when both international and 
country-specific willingness-to-pay thresholds were applied.

OBJECTIVES: To characterise gaps in antihypertensive treatment in people with 
hypertension and statin treatment in people with cardiovascular diseases (CVD) 
in a large urban population and quantify the health and economic impacts of 
their optimisation.
DESIGN: A cross-sectional population study and a long-term CVD decision model.
SETTING: Primary care, UK.
PARTICIPANTS: All adults with diagnosed hypertension or CVD in a population of 
about 1 million people, served by 123 primary care practices in London, UK in 
2019.
INTERVENTIONS: Following UK clinical guidelines, all adults with diagnosed 
hypertension were categorised into optimal, suboptimal and untreated groups with 
respect to their antihypertensive treatment, and all adults with diagnosed CVD 
were categorised in the same manner with respect to their statin treatment.
OUTCOMES: Proportion of patients suboptimally treated or untreated. Projected 
cardiovascular events avoided, years and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) 
gained and healthcare costs saved with optimised treatments.
RESULTS: 21 954 of the 91 828 adults with hypertension (24%; mean age 59 years; 
49% women) and 9062 of the 23 723 adults with CVD (38%; mean age 69 years; 43% 
women) were not optimally treated with antihypertensive or statin treatment, 
respectively. Per 1000 additional patients optimised over 5 years, hypertension 
treatment is projected to prevent 25 (95% CI 16 to 32) major vascular events 
(MVEs) and 7 (3 to 10) vascular deaths, statin treatment, 28 (22 to 33) MVEs and 
6 (4 to 7) vascular deaths. Over their lifespan, a patient with uncontrolled 
hypertension aged 60-69 years is projected to gain 0.64 (95% CI 0.36 to 0.87) 
QALYs with optimised hypertension treatment, and a similarly aged patient with 
previous CVD not optimally treated with statin is projected to gain 0.3 (0.24 to 
0.37) QALYs with optimised statin treatment. In both cases, the hospital cost 
savings minus extra medication costs were about £1100 per person over remaining 
lifespan.
CONCLUSIONS: Optimising cardiovascular treatments can cost-effectively reduce 
cardiovascular risk and improve life expectancy.

As the global elderly population grows, it is socioeconomically and medically 
critical to provide diverse and effective means of mitigating the impact of 
aging on human health. Previous studies showed that the adeno-associated virus 
(AAV) vector induced overexpression of certain proteins, which can suppress or 
reverse the effects of aging in animal models. In our study, we sought to 
determine whether the high-capacity cytomegalovirus vector (CMV) can be an 
effective and safe gene delivery method for two such protective factors: 
telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) and follistatin (FST). We found that the 
mouse cytomegalovirus (MCMV) carrying exogenous TERT or FST (MCMVTERT or 
MCMVFST) extended median lifespan by 41.4% and 32.5%, respectively. We report 
CMV being used successfully as both an intranasal and injectable gene therapy 
system to extend longevity. Specifically, this treatment significantly improved 
glucose tolerance, physical performance, as well as preventing body mass loss 
and alopecia. Further, telomere shortening associated with aging was ameliorated 
by TERT and mitochondrial structure deterioration was halted in both treatments. 
Intranasal and injectable preparations performed equally well in safely and 
efficiently delivering gene therapy to multiple organs, with long-lasting 
benefits and without carcinogenicity or unwanted side effects. Translating this 
research to humans could have significant benefits associated with quality of 
life and an increased health span.

AIMS: We aimed to report the burden of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) in the 
North Africa and Middle East region and its 21 countries from 1990 to 2019.
METHODS: Information related to incidence, prevalence, mortality, 
disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), and years lived with disability (YLDs) 
of T1DM was acquired from the 2019 Global Burden of Disease study. The burden 
was estimated by sex, age groups, and socio-demographic index (SDI) in 21 
countries.
RESULTS: Over the past 30 years, regional incidence, prevalence, mortality, and 
DALYs of T1DM increase by 188.7%, 304.8%, 43.7%, and 71.6%, respectively. While 
the age-standardized incidence and prevalence rates increased by 84% and 91%, 
the mortality and DALYs rates decreased by 34% and 13%. During these years, the 
contribution of YLDs to total DALYs increased considerably (from 17% to 42%). 
The highest increase in the incidence and prevalence rates occurred in high SDI 
countries. Moreover, the Mortality to Incidence Ratio (MIR) decreased in the 
region countries.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite progress made in diabetes care, there is a persistently 
increasing burden of T1DM in the region countries. This indicates that T1DM is 
still one of the major health challenges in the region countries, especially in 
high SDI Arab countries.

With the rapid revolution of therapies, hemopoietic stem cell transplantation 
(HSCT) has become a widely promoted treatment for hematological malignancies. 
High-dose chemotherapy (HDCT) followed by autologous blood cell (ABC) 
transplantation is a standard procedure for patients with primary relapse B-cell 
non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and multiple myeloma (MM), and allogeneic HSCT is one 
of the few treatments for patients with acute leukemia. However, refractory and 
recurrent disease has a negative impact on disease-free survival (DFS) for 
patients after HSCT. Furthermore, complications such as GVHD and infection 
significantly impair the quality of life and life expectancy of patients who 
receive allogeneic HSCT. The promising efficacy of chimeric antigen receptor T 
(CAR-T) cell therapy for relapsed or refractory B-cell acute lymphoblast 
leukemia (ALL) has offered hope for patients with R/R hematological 
malignancies. However, the long-term survival of patients after CAR-T cell 
therapy is also threatened by recurrent disease, and relapse occurs in half of 
patients who achieve remission. In addition, the rapid proliferation of CAR-T 
cells will cause damage to the balance of the immune system, leading to cytokine 
release syndrome (CRS) and CAR-T cell-related encephalopathy syndrome (CRES). 
Although therapeutic regimens such as IL-6 pathway blockers have obvious impacts 
on the side effects related to CAR-T cell therapy, there are still reports of 
patient deaths in past clinical trials. Based on the characteristics of HSCT and 
CAR-T cell therapy, it is unclear whether there is a better combination of 
cutting-edge immune cell therapy and traditional transplantation to improve the 
prognosis of patients. This review focuses on the possible ways to take full 
advantage of each therapy in the treatment of hematological malignancies.

INTRODUCTION: This study examined disparities in years of potential life lost 
(YPLL) related to opioid use among racial and ethnic groups adjusting for 
individual- and neighborhood-level characteristics.
METHODS: The study obtained data on 5265 geocoded death records associated with 
opioid use from the Washington State Department of Health. Death certificates 
included information on race and ethnicity, sex, marital status, and educational 
attainment. We linked these records to neighborhood-level indicators of 
rurality, area deprivation, and access to opioid treatment programs. Generalized 
linear mixed models tested associations between racial and ethnic identity and 
YPLL controlling for other individual and neighborhood characteristics.
RESULTS: Among all decedents from opioid-related causes, the study found that 
racial and ethnic minorities-including Black, American Indian/Alaska Native, 
Asian, Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander-multiracial, or Hispanic adults 
died at younger ages than did White adults (33 to 44 vs 45). In the fully 
adjusted models, the estimated mean for YPLL was higher for Asian or Native 
Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, multiracial, and Hispanic adults compared to 
White adults. Accounting for educational attainment and marital status 
substantially reduced YPLL differences between groups, by as much as 40% in some 
cases.
CONCLUSIONS: The study observed striking differences in YPLL related to opioid 
causes among racial and ethnic minorities. Accounting for social determinants of 
health greatly reduced YPLL across all groups but racial and ethnic disparities 
in YPLL remained significant. Understanding and alleviating additional causes of 
disparities in YPLL is warranted to abate the epidemic of opioid related deaths 
in the United States.

OBJECTIVES: Several chemoimmunotherapy and targeted treatment regimens are 
approved as front-line therapies in chronic lymphocytic leukemia. We estimated 
for the 10-year cost-effectiveness of these treatment regimens and the economic 
burden of following the estimated risk-stratified 21 040 patients with chronic 
lymphocytic leukemia diagnosed in 2020 for 10 years.
METHODS: A Markov model with 7 exclusive health states was specified over a 
10-year time horizon. Treatment effectiveness inputs were obtained from a novel 
network meta-analysis on the progression-free survival, overall survival curves, 
and time to next treatment. Costs and utilities inputs were included for each 
health state for each treatment and discounted at 3.0%/year. Life-years (LYs) 
and quality-adjusted LYs (QALYs) for each treatment were determined. Using the 
lowest cost regimen as reference, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
(ICER) and incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR) were estimated. The 10-year 
per-patient cost was determined by risk status and by initial treatment.
RESULTS: Venetoclax-plus-obinutuzumab was the lowest cost regimen, hence the 
reference. Superior in effectiveness to all chemoimmunotherapies, it was cost 
saving. With the highest effectiveness gains at 6.26 LYs and 5.01 QALYs and 
despite being the most expensive regimen ($1 298 638 per patient), 
acalabrutinib-plus-obinutuzumab yielded the best ICER ($409 343/LY gained) and 
ICUR ($501 236/QALY gained). The remaining ICERs of targeted therapies ranged 
from $512 101/LY gained to $793 236/LY gained and the ICURs from $579 737/QALY 
gained to $869 300/QALY gained. The 10-year postdiagnosis low/high 
(venetoclax-plus-obinutuzumab/acalabrutinib-plus-obinutuzumab) economic burden 
ranges were $42 690 to $98 665 for low-risk, $141 339 to $326 660 for 
intermediate-risk, and $273 650 to $632 453 for high-risk patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Compared with venetoclax-plus-obinutuzumab, chemoimmunotherapies 
are associated with less health benefits at higher cost. The targeted therapies 
achieve greater benefits at higher cost.

BACKGROUND: With advancements in cancer treatment, the life expectancy of 
oncology patients has improved. Thus, transcatheter aortic valve replacement 
(TAVR) may be considered as a feasible option for oncology patients with severe 
symptomatic aortic stenosis (AS). We aim to evaluate the difference in short- 
and long-term all-cause mortality in cancer and non-cancer patients treated with 
TAVR for severe AS.
METHODS: Medline, PubMed, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials 
were searched for relevant studies. Patients with cancer who underwent treatment 
with TAVR for severe AS were included and compared to an identical population 
without cancer. The primary endpoints were short- and long-term all-cause 
mortality.
RESULTS: Of 899 studies included, 8 met inclusion criteria. Cancer patients had 
significantly higher long-term all-cause mortality after TAVR when compared to 
patients without cancer (risk ratio [RR] 1.43; 95% confidence interval (CI) 
1.26-1.62; P < 0.01). Four studies evaluated short-term mortality after TAVR and 
demonstrated no difference in it in patients with and without cancer (RR 0.72; 
95% CI 0.47-1.08; P = 0.11).
CONCLUSION: Patients with cancer and severe AS have higher long-term all-cause 
mortality after TAVR. However, we found no difference in short-term all-cause 
mortality when comparing patients with and without cancer. The decision to 
perform TAVR in cancer patients should be individualized based on life 
expectancy and existing co-morbidities.

BACKGROUND: Mucopolysaccharidosis IVA (MPS IVA), or Morquio A syndrome, is a 
rare inherited metabolic disorder caused by deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme 
N-acetylgalactosamine-6-sulfatase. A progressive systemic skeletal 
chondrodysplasia, leading to significant morbidity and reduced life expectancy 
is the main clinical feature of this multisystemic disease. Although enzyme 
replacement therapy with elosulfase alfa is established in Europe, the rarity of 
disease and other factors still set hurdles in having patients treated in some 
countries. Aim of this statement is to provide evidence-based guidance for the 
enzyme replacement treatment of Morquio A patients, harmonizing recommendations 
from published guidelines with the real-life clinical practice in the Central 
and South-Eastern European region.
PARTICIPANTS: The Consensus Group, convened by 8 Steering Committee (SC) members 
from 7 Central and South-Eastern European countries, consisted of a 
multidisciplinary group of 17 experts in the management of MPS in Central and 
South-Eastern Europe.
CONSENSUS PROCESS: The SC met in a first virtual meeting with an external 
scientific coordinator, to discuss on clinical issues to be analyzed in guidance 
statements. Statements were developed by the scientific coordinator, evaluated 
by the SC members in a first modified-Delphi voting and adapted accordingly, to 
be submitted to the widest audience in the Consensus Conference. Following 
discussion and further modifications, all participants contributed to a second 
round of modified-Delphi voting.
RESULTS: Nine of ten statements, concerning general guidelines for management of 
MPS IVA patients and specific recommendations for treatment, received final 
consensus.
CONCLUSIONS: European guidelines and evidence-based recommendations for Morquio 
A patients should be considered in the real life of Central and South-Eastern 
European countries and adapted to unique clinical practice approaches and 
criteria for patients' access to treatment and reimbursement in the region.

Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.

AIMS: Japan is known as a country with low self-rated health despite high life 
expectancy. We compared socioeconomic inequalities in self-rated health in Japan 
with those in 32 European countries and the US using nationally representative 
samples.
METHODS: We analysed individual data from the Comprehensive Survey of Living 
Conditions (Japan), the European Union Statistics on Income and Living 
Conditions, and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (US) in 2016. We 
used ordered logistic regression models with four ordinal categories of 
self-rated health as an outcome, and educational level or occupational class as 
independent variables, controlling for age.
RESULTS: In Japan, about half the population perceived their health as 'fair', 
which was much higher than in Europe (≈20-40%). The odds ratios of lower 
self-rated health among less educated men compared with more educated were 1.72 
(95% confidence interval (CI) 1.61-1.85) in Japan, and ranged from 1.67 to 4.74 
in Europe (pooled; 2.10 (95% CI 2.01-2.20)), and 6.65 (95% CI 6.22-7.12) in the 
US. The odds ratios of lower self-rated health among less educated women were 
1.79 (95% CI 1.65-1.95) in Japan, and ranged from 1.89 to 5.30 in Europe 
(pooled; 2.43 (95% CI 2.33-2.54)), and 8.82 (95% CI 8.29-9.38) in the US. 
Socioeconomic inequalities were large when self-rated health was low for 
European countries, but Japan and the US did not follow the pattern.
CONCLUSIONS: Japan has similar socioeconomic gradient patterns to European 
countries for self-rated health, and our findings revealed smaller socioeconomic 
inequalities in self-rated health in Japan compared with those in western 
countries.

Thanks to the advent of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), people living 
with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (PLWH) experienced a marked increase in 
life expectancy but are now at higher risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD), the 
current leading cause of death in PLWH on cART. Although HIV preponderantly 
affects men over women, manifestations of HIV-related CVD differ by sex with 
women experiencing greater risks than men. Despite extensive investigation, the 
etiopathology of CVD, notably the respective contribution of viral infection and 
cART, remain ill-defined. However, both viral infection and cART have been 
reported to contribute to endothelial dysfunction, the precursor and major cause 
of atherosclerosis-associated CVD, through mechanisms involving endothelial cell 
activation, inflammation, and oxidative stress, all leading to reduced nitric 
oxide bioavailability. Therefore, preserving endothelial function in PLWH on 
cART should be a main target to reduce CVD morbidity and mortality, notably in 
females.

The development of a sustainable methodology for catalytic transformation of 
biomass-derived compounds to value-added chemicals is highly challenging. Most 
of the transitions are dominated by the use of additives, complicated reaction 
steps and large volumes of organic solvents. Compared to traditional organic 
solvents, alternative reaction media, which could be an ideal candidate for a 
viable extension of biomass-related reactions are rarely explored. Here, we 
elucidate a selective and efficient transformation of a biomass-derived aldehyde 
(furfural) to the corresponding alcohol, promoted in compressed CO2 using a 
Pt/Al2O3 catalyst. Furfural contains a furan ring with C[double bond, length as 
m-dash]C and an aldehyde group, and is extremely reactive in a hydrogen 
atmosphere, resulting in several by-products and a threat to alcohol selectivity 
as well as catalyst life. The process described has a very high reaction rate 
(6000 h-1) with an excellent selectivity/yield (99%) of alcohol, without any 
organic solvents or metal additives. This strategy has several key features over 
existing methodologies, such as reduced waste, and facile product separation and 
purification (reduced energy consumption). Combining the throughput of 
experimental observation and molecular dynamics simulation, indeed the high 
diffusivity of compressed CO2 controls the mobility of the compound, and 
eventually maintains the activity of the catalyst. Results are also compared for 
different solvents and solvent-less conditions. In particular, combination of an 
effective Pt catalyst with compressed CO2 provides an encouraging alternative 
solution for upgradation of biomass related platform molecules.
