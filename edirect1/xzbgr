First evidence of cases of haemophilia dates from ancient Egypt, but it was when 
Queen Victoria from England in the 19th century transmitted this illness to her 
descendants, when it became known as the "royal disease". Last decades of the 
20th century account for major discoveries that improved the life expectancy and 
quality of life of these patients. The history and evolution of haemophilia 
healthcare counts ups and downs. The introduction of prophylactic schemes during 
the 1970s have proved to be more effective that the classic on-demand 
replacement of clotting factors, nevertheless many patients managed with 
frequent plasma transfusions or derived products became infected with the Human 
Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and Hepatitis C virus during the 1980s and 1990s. 
Recombinant factor VIII inception has decreased the risk of blood borne 
infections and restored back longer life expectancies. Main concerns for 
haemophilia healthcare are shifting from the pure clinical aspects to the 
economic considerations of long-term replacement therapy. Nowadays researchers' 
attention has been placed on the future costs and cost-effectiveness of costly 
long-term treatment. Equity considerations are relevant as well, and alternative 
options for less affluent countries are under the scope of further research. The 
aim of this review was to assess the evidence of different treatment options for 
haemophilia type A over the past four decades, focusing on the most important 
technological advances that have influenced the natural course of this "royal 
disease".

Isfahan, Isfahan, Iran.

BACKGROUND: Pain and limited range of motion (ROM) are the crucial subsequent 
results of joint hemorrhages in individuals with bleeding disorders and 
hemophilia. Exercise interventions are particularly recommended in treatment of 
such patients. The purpose of this study was to detect the influences of 
conventional exercise therapy and hydrotherapy on the knee joint complications 
in patients with hemophilia.
METHODS: A total of 40 patients engaging hemophilia A were randomized into one 
of three groups: Therapeutic exercise (N = 13), hydrotherapy (N = 14) or control 
(N = 13). While the first two groups followed their specific programs for 4 
weeks, routine life-style was maintained by subjects in the control group in 
this period. To evaluate the pain level and knee ROM the visual analog scale and 
standard goniometer were utilized, respectively. The outcome was measured at 
baseline and after completing the prescribed protocols. Data analysis was 
performed using one-way analysis of variance and Scheffe statistical tests (P < 
0.05).
RESULTS: Both experimental groups experienced more significant decreasing in 
pain level (P < 0.001) and knee flexion and extension ROM (P < 0.001) in 
comparison to the control group. Although the pain was significantly (P < 0.01) 
more alleviated in participants treated through hydrotherapy in comparison to 
exercise therapy, the difference in ROM improvement was not statistically 
significant (P > 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Using hydrotherapy in addition to usual rehabilitation training can 
result in beneficial effect in terms of pain and knee joint ROM. However, it 
appears that hydrotherapy is more effective in reducing pain.

BACKGROUND: Homeless people are known to suffer disproportionately with health 
problems that reduce physical functioning and quality of life, and shorten life 
expectancy. They suffer from a wide range of diseases that are known to be 
painful, but little information is available about the nature and prevalence of 
chronic pain in this vulnerable group. This study aimed to estimate the 
prevalence of chronic pain among homeless people, and to examine its location, 
effect on activities of daily living, and relationship with alcohol and drugs.
METHODS: We conducted face-to-face interviews with users of homeless shelters in 
four major cities in the United Kingdom, in the winters of 2009-11. Participants 
completed the Brief Pain Inventory, Short Form McGill Pain questionnaire, Leeds 
Assessment of Neuropathic Symptoms and Signs, and detailed their intake of 
prescribed and unprescribed medications and alcohol. We also recorded each 
participant's reasons for homelessness, and whether they slept rough or in 
shelters.
FINDINGS: Of 168 shelter users approached, 150 (89.3%) participated: 93 
participants (63%) reported experiencing pain lasting longer than three months; 
the mean duration of pain experienced was 82.2 months. The lower limbs were most 
frequently affected. Opioids appeared to afford a degree of analgesia for some, 
but whilst many reported symptoms suggestive of neuropathic pain, very few were 
taking anti-neuropathic drugs.
INTERPRETATION: The prevalence of chronic pain in the homeless appears to be 
substantially higher than the general population, is poorly controlled, and 
adversely affects general activity, walking and sleeping. It is hard to discern 
whether chronic pain is a cause or effect of homelessness, or both. Pain is a 
symptom, but in this challenging group it might not always be possible to treat 
the underlying cause. Exploring the diagnosis and treatment of neuropathic pain 
may offer a means of improving the quality of these vulnerable people's lives.

The effect and process evaluations of the national quality improvement programme 
for palliative care: the study protocol.

BACKGROUND: The nationwide integration of palliative care best practices into 
general care settings is challenging but important in improving the quality of 
palliative care. This is why the Dutch National Quality Improvement Programme 
for Palliative Care has recently been launched. This four-year programme 
consists of about 70 implementation trajectories of best practices. A large 
evaluation study has been set up to evaluate this national programme and 
separate implementation trajectories.
METHODS/DESIGN: This paper presents the protocol of the evaluation study 
consisting of a quantitative effect evaluation and a qualitative process 
evaluation. The effect evaluation has a pre-test post-test design, with 
measurements before implementation (month 0) and after implementation (month 9) 
of a best practice. Patients are eligible if they have a life expectancy of less 
than six months and/or if they are undergoing palliative treatment and provided 
they are physically and mentally capable of responding to questionnaires. 
Bereaved relatives are eligible if they have been involved in the care of a 
deceased patient who died after a sickbed between six weeks and six months ago. 
Three types of measurement instruments are used: (1) numerical rating scales for 
six symptoms (pain, fatigue, breathlessness, obstipation, sadness and anxiety), 
(2) the Consumer Quality Index Palliative Care - patient version and (3) the 
version for bereaved relatives.The process evaluation consists of analysing 
implementation plans and reports of the implementation, and individual and group 
interviews with healthcare professionals. This will be done nine to eleven 
months after the start of the implementation of a best practice.
DISCUSSION: This mixed-method evaluation study gives more insight into the 
effects of the total programme and the separate implementation trajectories. 
However, evaluation of large quality improvement programmes is complicated due 
to changing, non-controlled environments. Therefore, it is important that an 
effect evaluation is combined with a process evaluation.

BACKGROUND: The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2010 Study has published 
disability-adjusted life year (DALY) data at both regional and country levels 
from 1990 to 2010. Concurrently, the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation 
(IHME) has published estimates of development assistance for health (DAH) at the 
country-disease level for this same period of time.
FINDINGS: We use disease burden data from the GBD 2010 study and financing data 
from IHME to calculate ratios of DAH to DALYs across regions and diseases. We 
examine the magnitude of these ratios and how they have varied over time. We 
hypothesize that the variation in this ratio across regions would be relatively 
small. However, from 2006 to 2010, we find there was considerable variation in 
the levels of DAH per DALY across regions. For total funding, the relative 
standard deviation (standard deviation as a percentage of the mean) across 
regions was 50%. For DAH specific to HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis, the 
relative standard deviations were 50%, 200% and 60%, respectively. While these 
deviations are high, with the exception of malaria, they have decreased since 
the 1990s.
CONCLUSIONS: There are no evident explanations for so much variation in funding 
across regions, especially holding the purpose of the funding constant. This 
suggests donors' allocation processes have not been particularly sensitive to 
disease burdens. To maximize health gains, donors should explicitly incorporate 
new disease burden data along with the relative costs and efficacy of 
interventions into their allocation process.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to estimate life expectancies of 
HIV-positive patients conditional on response to antiretroviral therapy (ART).
METHODS: Patients aged more than 20 years who started ART during 2000-2010 
(excluding IDU) in HIV clinics contributing to the UK CHIC Study were followed 
for mortality until 2012. We determined the latest CD4 cell count and viral load 
before ART and in each of years 1-5 of ART. For each duration of ART, life 
tables based on estimated mortality rates by sex, age, latest CD4 cell count and 
viral suppression (HIV-1 RNA <400 copies/ml), were used to estimate expected age 
at death for ages 20-85 years.
RESULTS: Of 21 388 patients who started ART, 961 (4.5%) died during 110 697 
person-years. At start of ART, expected age at death [95% confidence interval 
(CI)] of 35-year-old men with CD4 cell count less than 200, 200-349, at least 
350 cells/μl was 71 (68-73), 78 (74-82) and 77 (72-81) years, respectively, 
compared with 78 years for men in the general UK population. 
Thirty-five-year-old men who increased their CD4 cell count in the first year of 
ART from less than 200 to 200-349 or at least 350 cells/μl and achieved viral 
suppression gained 7 and 10 years, respectively. After 5 years on ART, expected 
age at death of 35-year-old men varied from 54 (48-61) (CD4 cell count 
<200 cells/μl and no viral suppression) to 80 (76-83) years (CD4 cell count 
≥350 cells/μl and viral suppression).
CONCLUSION: Successfully treated HIV-positive individuals have a normal life 
expectancy. Patients who started ART with a low CD4 cell count significantly 
improve their life expectancy if they have a good CD4 cell count response and 
undetectable viral load.

Target of Rapamycin (TOR) is involved in cellular and organismal aging. 
Rapamycin extends lifespan and delays cancer in mice. It is important to 
determine the minimum effective dose and frequency of its administration that 
still extends lifespan and prevents cancer. Previously we tested 1.5 mg/kg of 
rapamycin given subcutaneously 6 times per two weeks followed by a two-week 
break (1.5 × 6/bi-weekly schedule: total of 6 injections during a 4-week 
period). This intermittent treatment prolonged lifespan and delayed cancer in 
cancer-prone female FVB/N HER-2/neu mice. Here, the dose was decreased from 1.5 
mg/kg to 0.45 mg/kg per injection. This treatment was started at the age of 2 
months (group Rap-2), 4 months (Rap-4), and 5 months (Rap-5). Three control 
groups received the solvent from the same ages. Rapamycin significantly delayed 
cancer and decreased tumor burden in Rap-2 and Rap-5 groups, increased mean 
lifespan in Rap-4 and Rap-5 groups, and increased maximal lifespan in Rap-2 and 
Rap-5 groups. In Rap-4 group, mean lifespan extension was achieved without 
significant cancer prevention. The complex relationship between life-extension 
and cancer-prevention depends on both the direct effect of rapamycin on cancer 
cells and its anti-aging effect on the organism, which in turn prevents cancer 
indirectly. We conclude that total doses of rapamycin that are an order of 
magnitude lower than standard total doses can detectably extend life span in 
cancer-prone mice.

Lifestyle factors related to mortality and survival: a mini-review.

Society, Karolinska Institutet and Stockholm University, Stockholm, Sweden.

As the world's population ages, elderly people are becoming an increasingly 
important group that merits special attention with regard to health and social 
issues. Lifestyles affect health and survival at all ages, but the consequences 
of poor lifestyle behaviors may be different for elderly people than for younger 
adults. They can also be heavily dependent on exposure earlier in life. Our 
current state of knowledge is based predominantly on studies conducted among 
middle-aged adults or young elderly people. Moreover, studies are sparse 
throughout the entire older age spectrum, from 65 to 90 years. This article 
summarizes the evidence regarding the impact of lifestyle behaviors on mortality 
among elderly people. It focuses on behaviors modifiable by individual actions 
and public health interventions, such as smoking, obesity and sedentary 
behavior, which predispose numerous people to diseases that rank among the 
leading causes of death, including heart disease, cancer, stroke, diabetes and 
dementia. These factors not only shorten life but, when they occur together, 
also have a major impact on survival beyond that associated with each single 
lifestyle factor. We propose an integrated life course model to guide research 
on longevity to answer questions that remain open and to find new strategies to 
ensure a longer and healthier life for future generations.

PURPOSE: Long-lasting low back pain is an increasing problem, and for some 
patients surgery is the final option for improvement. Several techniques for 
spinal fusion are available and the optimal technique remains uncertain. The 
objective of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of 
transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF) compared to posterolateral 
instrumented fusion (PLF) from the societal perspective.
METHODS: 100 Patients were randomized to TLIF or PLF (51/49) and followed for 
2 years. Cost data were acquired from national registers, and outcomes were 
measured using the Oswestry Disability Index and SF-6D questionnaires. 
Conventional cost-effectiveness methodology was employed to estimate net benefit 
and to illustrate cost-effectiveness acceptability curves. The statistical 
analysis was based on means and bootstrapped confidence intervals.
RESULTS: Results showed no statistically significant difference in either cost 
or effects although a tendency for the TLIF regimen being more costly on bed 
days (<euro>2,554) and production loss (<euro>1,915) was observed. The 
probability that TLIF would be cost-effective did not exceed 30 % for any 
threshold of willingness to pay per quality-adjusted life year. Sensitivity 
analysis was conducted and supported the statistical model for handling of 
missing data.
CONCLUSION: TLIF does not seem to be a relevant alternative to PLF from a 
socioeconomic, societal point of view.

Mortality in primary open-angle glaucoma and exfoliative glaucoma.

Tarkkanen AH(1), Kivelä TT.

Author information:
(1)Department of Ophthalmology, Helsinki University Central Hospital, Helsinki - 
Finland.

PURPOSE: To study mortality among unselected Finnish patients with either 
primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) or exfoliative glaucoma (EG) after a minimum 
follow-up of 7 years after enrollment.
METHODS: A total of 344 patients with POAG and 155 patients with EG had received 
free medication for the treatment of glaucoma from the Finnish National Social 
Insurance Institution (FSII). The FSII operates national health insurance, which 
is compulsory for all Finnish citizens. To be granted free medication, the 
patient has to file an application with a certificate from an ophthalmologist. 
If the predefined criteria for glaucoma specified by the Finnish Parliament are 
met, full reimbursement for glaucoma medications is granted and the patient is 
listed in the registry of FSII. We reviewed the records of 519 consecutive 
patients who had been diagnosed with glaucoma and to whom free medication had 
been granted between June 2004 and December 2005. Patients with acute glaucoma 
or secondary glaucoma were excluded. Those with open angles were classified into 
POAG or EG. The quality of the ophthalmologists' records was high. The Finnish 
Population Registry, a governmental institute, provided information on those 
patients who had died before January 2013.
RESULTS: At enrollment, the groups with POAG and EG were comparable as regards 
sex: 66% female with POAG and 68% with EG. The patients with POAG were younger 
(median 68 years) than those with EG (median 74 years). By January 2013, 59 
patients with POAG and 48 with EG had died. At death, the patients with POAG 
were younger (median 81.8 years) than those with EG (87.9 years). In both 
groups, the women lived longer than the men, but among patients with POAG, women 
and men died at a younger age than those with EG.
CONCLUSIONS: As has been reported previously, life expectancy of patients with 
EG was longer when compared to those with POAG. Higher death rate among patients 
with EG is explained by higher median age at baseline.

Medical management of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors has recently been 
improved by new molecules of which the mTOR inhibitor everolimus. If digestive 
neuroendocrine tumors are rare, the incidence is in constant increase and the 
prevalence in digestive cancers put them right behind colorectal cancers. 
Everolimus has demonstrated efficacy in unresectable and progressive pancreatic 
neuroendocrine tumors, by doubling the median progression free survival (11 
versus 4.6 months), with a median time of exposure to everolimus of nine months. 
Everolimus is generally maintained until progression or intolerance and some 
patients are treated during several years. Potential metabolic disorders induced 
by everolimus (dyslipidemia, hyperglycemia) in patients with life expectancy of 
several years, justify monitoring of these parameters and accurate treatment 
management algorithm. These will avoid worsening patient's prognostic, but also 
prematurely discontinue potentially effective treatment or contraindicate other 
therapeutic weapons, in a pathology in which there are multiple therapeutic 
options in metastatic phase. We propose a standard practice in terms of initial 
assessment, monitoring, care threshold, and therapeutic objectives to manage 
metabolic disorders, fitted to our patients with advanced pancreatic 
neuroendocrine tumors.

London, Ontario, Canada, N6A 5A5.

Update in
    Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2018 Apr 01;4:CD010410.

BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease is a transmural, relapsing inflammatory condition 
afflicting the digestive tract. Opioid signalling, long known to affect 
secretion and motility in the gut, has been implicated in the inflammatory 
cascade of Crohn's disease. Low dose naltrexone, an opioid antagonist, has 
garnered interest as a potential therapy.
OBJECTIVES: The primary objective was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of low 
dose naltrexone for induction of remission in Crohn's disease.
SEARCH METHODS: A systematic search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, and the 
Cochrane Inflammatory Bowel Disease and Functional Bowel Disorders Review Group 
Specialized Register was performed from inception to February 2013 to identify 
relevant studies. Abstracts from major gastroenterology conferences including 
Digestive Disease Week and United European Gastroenterology Week and reference 
lists from retrieved articles were also reviewed.
SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized controlled trials of low dose naltrexone (LDN) 
for treatment of active Crohn's disease were included.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data were analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis 
using Review Manager (RevMan 5.2). The primary outcome was induction of clinical 
remission defined by a Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI) of < 150 or a 
pediatric Crohn's disease activity index (PCDAI) of < 10. Secondary outcomes 
included clinical response (70- or 100-point decrease in CDAI from baseline), 
endoscopic remission or response, quality of life, and adverse events as defined 
by the included studies. Risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were 
calculated for dichotomous outcomes. The methodological quality of included 
studies was evaluated using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. The overall quality 
of the evidence supporting the primary outcome and selected secondary outcomes 
was assessed using the GRADE criteria.
MAIN RESULTS: Two studies were identified (46 participants). One study assessed 
the efficacy and safety of 12 weeks of LDN (4.5 mg/day) treatment compared to 
placebo in adult patients (N = 34). The other study assessed eight weeks of LDN 
(0.1 mg/kg, maximum 4.5 mg/day) treatment compared to placebo in pediatric 
patients (N = 12). The primary purpose of the pediatric study was to assess 
safety and tolerability. Both studies were rated as having a low risk of bias. 
The study in adult patients reported that 30% (5/18) of LDN treated patients 
achieved clinical remission at 12 weeks compared to 18% (3/16) of placebo 
patients, a difference that was not statistically significant (RR 1.48, 95% CI 
0.42 to 5.24). The study in children reported that 25% of LDN treated patients 
achieved clinical remission (PCDAI < 10) compared to none of the patients in the 
placebo group, although it was unclear if this result was for the randomized 
placebo-controlled trial or for the open label extension study. In the adult 
study 70-point clinical response rates were significantly higher in those 
treated with LDN than placebo. Eighty-three per cent (15/18) of LDN patients had 
a 70-point clinical response at week 12 compared to 38% (6/16) of placebo 
patients (RR 2.22, 95% CI 1.14 to 4.32). The effect of LDN on the proportion of 
adult patients who achieved a 100-point clinical response was uncertain. 
Sixty-one per cent (11/18) of LDN patients achieved a 100-point clinical 
response compared to 31% (5/16) of placebo patients (RR 1.96, 95% CI 0.87 to 
4.42). The proportion of patients who achieved endoscopic response (CDEIS 
decline > 5 from baseline) was significantly higher in the LDN group compared to 
placebo. Seventy-two per cent (13/18) of LDN patients achieved an endoscopic 
response compared to 25% (4/16) of placebo patients (RR 2.89; 95% CI 1.18 to 
7.08). However, there was no statistically significant difference in the 
proportion of patients who achieved endoscopic remission. Endoscopic remission 
(CDEIS < 3) was achieved in 22% (4/18) of the LDN group compared to 0% (0/16) of 
the placebo group (RR 8.05; 95% CI 0.47 to 138.87). Pooled data from both 
studies show no statistically significant differences in withdrawals due to 
adverse events or specific adverse events including sleep disturbance, unusual 
dreams, headache, decreased appetite, nausea and fatigue. No serious adverse 
events were reported in either study. GRADE analyses rated the overall quality 
of the evidence for the primary and secondary outcomes (i.e. clinical remission, 
clinical response, endoscopic response, and adverse events) as low due to 
serious imprecision (sparse data).
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Currently, there is insufficient evidence to allow any 
firm conclusions regarding the efficacy and safety of LDN used to treat patients 
with active Crohn's disease. Data from one small study suggests that LDN may 
provide a benefit in terms of clinical and endoscopic response in adult patients 
with active Crohn's disease. Data from two small studies suggest that LDN does 
not increase the rate of specific adverse events relative to placebo. However, 
these results need to be interpreted with caution as they are based on very 
small numbers of patients and the overall quality of the evidence was rated as 
low due to serious imprecision. Further randomized controlled trials are 
required to assess the efficacy and safety of LDN therapy in active Crohn's 
disease in both adults and children. One study is currently ongoing 
(NCT01810185).

BACKGROUND: Intelligence is a life-long trait that has strong influences on 
lifestyle, adult morbidity and life expectancy. Hence, lower cognitive abilities 
are therefore of public health interest. Our primary aim was to examine if 
prenatal bereavement measured as exposure to death of a close family member is 
associated with the intelligence quotient (IQ) scores at 18-years of age of 
adult Danish males completing a military cognitive screening examination.
METHODS: We extracted records for the Danish military screening test and found 
kinship links with biological parents, siblings, and maternal grandparents using 
the Danish Civil Registration System (N = 167,900). The prenatal exposure period 
was defined as 12 months before conception until birth of the child. We 
categorized children as exposed in utero to severe stress (bereavement) during 
prenatal life if their mothers lost an elder child, husband, parent or sibling 
during the prenatal period; the remaining children were included in the 
unexposed cohort. Mean score estimates were adjusted for maternal and paternal 
age at birth, residence, income, maternal education, gestational age at birth 
and birth weight.
RESULTS: When exposure was due to death of a father the offsprings' mean IQ 
scores were lower among men completing the military recruitment exam compared to 
their unexposed counterparts, adjusted difference of 6.5 standard IQ points 
(p-value = 0.01). We did not observe a clinically significant association 
between exposure to prenatal maternal bereavement caused by death of a sibling, 
maternal uncle/aunt or maternal grandparent even after stratifying deaths only 
due to traumatic events.
CONCLUSION: We found maternal bereavement to be adversely associated with IQ in 
male offspring, which could be related to prenatal stress exposure though more 
likely is due to changes in family conditions after death of the father. This 
finding supports other literature on maternal adversity during fetal life and 
cognitive development in the offspring.

Evolution of aging through reduced demographic stochasticity - an extension of 
the pleiotropy theory to finite populations.

Institute for Demographic Research Konrad Zuse Strasse 1, 18057, Rostock, 
Germany.

In finite populations, there is selection against demographic stochasticity. In 
this study, it is shown that an increase in the rate of aging, here defined as 
an increase in early-life survival at the expense of later survival, may reduce 
this form of stochasticity. In particular, a trade-off between juvenile and 
adult survival is highly efficient in reducing demographic stochasticity. 
Therefore, aging may evolve as a response to selective pressure for reduced 
demographic stochasticity.

[Technology and notion of human life].

[Article in French]

Kakimoto Y.

This article aims to examine the rules of robotics whose sense is modified in 
society and which change the notion of human body. Asimov proposed three rules 
of robotics in his novel of science fiction, which become the basis of the rules 
concerning the study of the development of robotics. These rules are created in 
order to avoid harming human beings and to mitigate the variant difficulties of 
being human being. As for latter, robotics has functioned as a meaning of 
extension of the physical faculty. Thus, technology develops in the direction of 
the enhancement of the capability of human body beyond the necessities of life. 
Robotics doesn't only suggest a rethinking of the notion of a human being but 
also changes our understanding of the human body.

Fabry disease (Anderson-Fabry disease) is one of the most common lysosomal 
storage diseases (after Gaucher disease) caused by deficient activity of the 
alpha-galactosidase A (alpha-Gal A) enzyme, which leads to progressive 
accumulation of globotriaosylceramide in various cells, predominantly in 
endothelium and vascular smooth muscles, with multisystem clinical 
manifestations. Estimates of the incidence range from one per 40,000 to 60,000 
in males, and 1:117,000 in the general population. Pain is usually the first 
symptom and is present in 60%-80% of affected children, as well as 
gastrointestinal disturbances, ophthalmologic abnormalities and hearing loss. 
Renal failure, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, or stroke as the presenting symptom 
may also be found even as isolated symptoms of the disease. Life expectancy is 
reduced by approximately 20 years in males and 10-15 years in females, therefore 
enzyme replacement therapy should be introduced in patients of any age and 
either sex, who meet treatment criteria for Anderson-Fabry disease.

The "e" in cost-effectiveness analyses. A case study of omalizumab efficacy and 
effectiveness for cost-effectiveness analysis evidence.

Campbell JD(1), McQueen RB, Briggs A.

Author information:
(1)1 University of Colorado, Aurora, Colorado; and.

This article is a call for increased use of real-world evidence in health 
technology assessment and related policy and decision making. There is currently 
a disconnect between evidence used to guide regulatory approval of therapies and 
evidence used to inform therapeutic coverage and reimbursement decisions. Public 
and private payers need to understand not only whether an intervention works but 
also whether it offers good value compared with licensed alternatives (not 
placebo) as they are used in the real-world practice and population (not in a 
controlled trial environment). Addressing such concerns requires evidence to be 
drawn from a wide range of study designs, but with consideration and weighting 
given to their relative strengths and weaknesses, as well as their position on 
the pragmatic-explanatory (i.e., effectiveness-efficacy) continuum. The 
potential impact of using different types of evidence to inform 
cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) is discussed for omalizumab, comparing and 
contrasting a CEA model informed by an omalizumab efficacy trial to a CEA model 
drawing primarily on evidence from effectiveness observational studies of 
omalizumab. There was reasonable agreement between the two omalizumab CEA 
models, although the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio generated by the 
effectiveness observational study-driven model was more favorable for 
omalizumab. Health technology assessment bodies and payers must use their 
judgment to determine which components of efficacy-based and effectiveness-based 
CEA evidence are most closely aligned with their goals. For each CEA evidence 
component, perhaps the two E's form bounds of the truth as well as a fuller 
picture of the uncertainty surrounding the truth.

The more patients you treat, the more you cure: managing cardiotoxicity in the 
treatment of aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

Athracycline-based regimens remain the gold standard for the treatment of 
lymphomas, even if their use can be limited by associated cardiac toxicity, 
especially in elderly patients. Although most patients with aggressive 
non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) are elderly, they may envisage long-term life 
expectancy. Thus, there is a need for therapeutic strategies that can overcome 
the impact of anthracycline cardiotoxicity. A better understanding of its 
pathogenetic mechanisms, the identification of risk factors of cardiac 
dysfunction, and appropriate therapy should prove useful in this setting. A 
comparable efficacy and reduced cardiotoxicity even in frail and elderly 
patients have been shown with the use of non-pegylated liposomal doxorubicin, 
when substituted for conventional doxorubicin in standard chemotherapy regimens 
for NHL. In the coming years, the goal will be to apply these advancements to 
the treatment of patients with NHL, to ensure adequate therapy in patients 
currently denied conventional intensive chemotherapy because of age or 
comorbidities.

Ranolazine has been shown to decrease angina pectoris frequency and 
nitroglycerin consumption. We assessed the cost-effectiveness of ranolazine when 
added to standard-of-care (SoC) antianginals compared with SoC alone in patients 
with stable coronary disease experiencing ≥3 attacks/week. A Markov model 
utilizing a societal perspective, a 1-month cycle length, and a 1-year time 
horizon was developed to estimate costs (2013 US$) and quality-adjusted life 
years (QALYs) for patients receiving and not receiving ranolazine. Patients 
entered the model in 1 of the 4 angina frequency health states based upon 
Seattle Angina Questionnaire angina frequency (SAQAF) scores (100=no; 61 to 
99=monthly; 31 to 60=weekly; and 0 to 30=daily angina) and were allowed to 
transition between states or to death based upon probabilities derived from the 
Efficacy of Ranolazine in Chronic Angina and other studies. Patients not 
responding to ranolazine in month 1 (not improving ≥1 SAQAF health state) were 
assumed to discontinue ranolazine and behave like SoC patients. Ranolazine 
patients lived a mean of 0.700 QALYs at a cost of $15,661. Those not receiving 
ranolazine lived 0.659 QALYs and at a cost of $14,321. The incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for the addition of ranolazine was $32,682/QALY. 
The ICER was most sensitive to ranolazine cost but only exceeded $50,000/QALY 
when the cost of ranolazine increased >32% above base case. The ICER remained 
<$50,000/QALY when indirect costs were excluded, and mortality rates were 
assumed equivalent between SAQAF health states. Monte Carlo simulation found 
ranolazine cost-effective in 97% of 10,000 iterations at a $50,000/QALY 
willingness-to-pay threshold. In conclusion, ranolazine added to SoC is 
cost-effective in patients with weekly or daily angina.

This paper presents an overview of Gavin Mooney's contributions to broadening 
the evaluative space in health economics. It outlines how Mooney's ideas have 
encouraged many, including ourselves, to expand the conventional QALYs/health 
gain approach and look more broadly at what it is that is of value from health 
services. We reflect on Mooney's contributions to debates around 
cost-effectiveness analysis, Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) and 
cost-utility analysis as well as his contribution to the development and 
application of contingent valuation and discrete choice experiments in health 
economics. We conclude by suggesting important avenues for future research to 
take forward Mooney's work.

BACKGROUND: Women experience poorer health than men despite their longer life 
expectancy, due to a higher prevalence of non-fatal chronic illnesses. This 
paper aims to explore whether the unequal gender distribution of roles and 
resources can account for inequalities in general self-rated health (SRH) by 
gender, across social classes, in a Southern European population.
METHODS: Cross-sectional study of residents in Catalonia aged 25-64, using data 
from the 2006 population living conditions survey (n=5,817). Poisson regression 
models were used to calculate the fair/poor SRH prevalence ratio (PR) by gender 
and to estimate the contribution of variables assessing several dimensions of 
living conditions as the reduction in the PR after their inclusion in the model. 
Analyses were stratified by social class (non-manual and manual).
RESULTS: SRH was poorer for women among both non-manual (PR 1.39, 95% CI 
1.09-1.76) and manual social classes (PR 1.36, 95% CI 1.20-1.56). Adjustment for 
individual income alone eliminated the association between sex and SRH, 
especially among manual classes (PR 1.01, 95% CI 0.85-1.19; among non-manual 
1.19, 0.92-1.54). The association was also reduced when adjusting by employment 
conditions among manual classes, and household material and economic situation, 
time in household chores and residential environment among non-manual classes.
DISCUSSION: Gender inequalities in individual income appear to contribute 
largely to women's poorer health. Individual income may indicate the 
availability of economic resources, but also the history of access to the labour 
market and potentially the degree of independence and power within the 
household. Policies to facilitate women's labour market participation, to close 
the gender pay gap, or to raise non-contributory pensions may be helpful to 
improve women's health.

INTRODUCTION: Since the end of the 1990s, globalization has become a common 
term, facilitated by the social media of today and the growing public awareness 
of life-threatening problems common to all people, such as global warming, 
global security and global divides.
REVIEW: For the main parameters of health like the burden of disease, life 
expectancy and healthy life expectancy, extreme discrepancies are observed 
across the world. Infant mortality, malnutrition and high fertility go hand in 
hand. Civil society, as an indispensable activator of public health development, 
mainly represented by non-governmental organisations (NGOs), is characterised by 
a high degree of fragmentation and lack of public accountability. The World 
Federation of Public Health Associations is used as an example of an NGO with a 
global mission and fostering regional cooperation as an indispensable 
intermediate level.The lack of a globally valid terminology of basic public 
health functions is prohibitive for coordinated global and regional efforts. 
Attempts to harmonise essential public health functions, services and operations 
are under way to facilitate communication and mutual understanding.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 1) Given the limited effects of the Millennium Development Goal 
agenda, the Post-2015 Development Goals should focus on integrated regional 
development. 2) A code of conduct for NGOs should be urgently developed for the 
health sector, and NGOs should be registered and accredited. 3) The 
harmonisation of the basic terminology for global public health essentials 
should be enhanced.
