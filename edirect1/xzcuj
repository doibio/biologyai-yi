RESULTS: The incremental costs and QALYs that pembrolizumab yielded, compared 
with chemotherapy, were $86164.87 and 0.63, $74562.25 and 0.46 and $70886.65 and 
0.39 for the populations with a PD-L1 TPS ≥ 50%, TPS ≥ 20% and TPS ≥ 1%, leading 
an incremental cost-effective ratio (ICER) of $136,228.82, $160,625.98 and 
$179,530.17 per QALY, respectively.
CONCLUSION: First-line treatment with pembrolizumab is a cost-effective strategy 
compared with platinum-based chemotherapy when the value of WTP was $150,000 per 
QALY in locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC patients with PD-L1 TPS ≥ 50% and 
without epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and anaplastic lymphoma kinase 
(ALK) mutations, but not in the TPS ≥ 20% and 1% populations.

BACKGROUND: Quality-adjusted life year is widely applied nowadays, which 
consider both survival and quality of life (QoL). When most diseases are 
becoming chronic, it is imperative to quantify the overall health impact of a 
disease in lifetime perspective.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to introduce methods for estimating 
quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE) and loss of QALE in patients with a 
disease or specific conditions.
METHODS: The QALE of an index cohort can be represented as the integration of 
the product of lifetime survival function and mean QoL function. We introduce a 
robust extrapolation approach for estimating lifetime survival function and 
propose an approach for estimating lifetime mean QoL function for studies with 
limited follow-up. The best part of the proposed method is that the survival 
data and QoL data can be collected separately. A cohort of patients with a 
specific condition can be identified by databases that regularly collect data 
for the control of diseases, and their survival status is verified by linking to 
a mortality registry. Although nationwide QoL data are not available, 
researchers can implement a relative short-term follow-up interview on a random 
sample of patients to collect QoL data. For demonstration, we applied the 
proposed methods to estimate QALE and loss of QALE of oral cancer patients.
RESULTS: The estimates (95% confidence interval) of QALE for oral cancer 
patients were 11.0 (10.5-11.6) and 14.2 (12.7-15.5) quality-adjusted life years 
(QALYs) for men and women, respectively. The estimates of loss of QALE for the 
male and female patients with oral cancer were 14.4 (13.8-14.9) and 7.5 
(6.2-9.0) QALYs, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The methods for estimating QALE and loss of QALE can be applied to 
economic evaluation of cancer control, including screening.

BACKGROUND: Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) and stereotactic body radiotherapy 
(SBRT) are well established local treatment approaches in several cancer 
settings. Although SBRT is still under investigation for spinal metastases, 
promising results in terms of a high effectiveness and optimal tolerability have 
been recently published on this topic. For spinal SBRT, one of the most relevant 
issues is represented by the inter-observer variability in target definition. 
Recently, several technological innovations, including specific tools such as 
multimodality-imaging (computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET-CT), automated volumes contouring 
and planning, could allow clinicians to minimize the uncertainties related to 
spinal SBRT workflow. Aim of this study is to report the feasibility of the 
clinical application of a dedicated software (Element®, Brainlab™ Germany) for 
spinal metastases SBRT.
MATERIAL AND METHOD: The patient selection criteria for SBRT in spinal 
metastases were the following: age > 18 years, diagnosis of spinal metastases 
(n ≤ 3), life expectancy > 3 months, controlled primary tumor or synchronous 
diagnosis and Spinal Instability Neoplastic Score (SINS) ≤ 12 points. All 
radiation target volumes were defined and planned with the support of the 
dedicated software Elements® (Brainlab™ Germany). Different dose prescription 
have been used: 12 Gy in single fraction, 12 Gy, 18 Gy, 21 Gy and 24 Gy in 3 
fractions. Toxicity was assessed according to the Common Terminology Criteria 
for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.0. SPSS version 20 was used for statistical 
analysis.
RESULTS: From April 2018 to April 2019, 54 spinal metastases in 32 recruited 
patients were treated with Linac-based SBRT. With a median follow-up of 6 months 
(range 3-12), local control rates at 6 months and 9 months were 86 and 86%, 
respectively. No adverse events ≥3 grade were observed.
CONCLUSIONS: This preliminary experience shows that with respect to acute 
toxicity and early clinical response, linac-based using Elements® Spine SRS is a 
feasible and effective approach.

Severe obesity among youth is an "epidemic within an epidemic" and portends a 
shortened life expectancy for today's children compared with those of their 
parents' generation. Severe obesity has outpaced less severe forms of childhood 
obesity in prevalence, and it disproportionately affects adolescents. Emerging 
evidence has linked severe obesity to the development and progression of 
multiple comorbid states, including increased cardiometabolic risk resulting in 
end-organ damage in adulthood. Lifestyle modification treatment has achieved 
moderate short-term success among young children and those with less severe 
forms of obesity, but no studies to date demonstrate significant and durable 
weight loss among youth with severe obesity. Metabolic and bariatric surgery has 
emerged as an important treatment for adults with severe obesity and, more 
recently, has been shown to be a safe and effective strategy for groups of youth 
with severe obesity. However, current data suggest that youth with severe 
obesity may not have adequate access to metabolic and bariatric surgery, 
especially among underserved populations. This report outlines the current 
evidence regarding adolescent bariatric surgery, provides recommendations for 
practitioners and policy makers, and serves as a companion to an accompanying 
technical report, "Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery for Pediatric Patients With 
Severe Obesity," which provides details and supporting evidence.

This paper deals with the analysis of the under-5 mortality rate series in the 
G7 countries by using fractional integration techniques, including structural 
breaks and potential nonlinearities in the data. Several features were detected 
in the results: Firstly, we observed that for the neonatal data, the order of 
integration is equal to or higher than one in all cases, contrary to what 
happens for the remaining cases (< 1- < 5 years) where mean reversion is found 
in many cases, especially as we increase the age of death. Thus, shocks 
affecting the neonatal (< 1 month from delivery) mortality rates will have 
permanent effects requiring special attention to recover the original trends. As 
expected, all the time trend coefficients were significantly negative and the 
highest reduction in the mortality rates was obtained in Japan, which might be 
related with the 17-year increase in life expectancy for the country. Due to the 
sensitivity of the methodological approaches, the use of robust time series 
approaches when analyzing child mortality rates is highly recommended.

lipodystrophy-associated cardiovascular disease and potential effects of leptin 
therapy on cardiovascular function.

Lipodystrophy is a disease characterized by a partial or total absence of 
adipose tissue leading to severe metabolic derangements including marked insulin 
resistance, type 2 diabetes, hypertriglyceridemia, and steatohepatitis. 
Lipodystrophy is also a source of major cardiovascular disorders which, in 
addition to hepatic failure and infection, contribute to a significant reduction 
in life expectancy. Metreleptin, the synthetic analog of the adipocyte-derived 
hormone leptin and current therapy of choice for patients with lipodystrophy, 
successfully improves metabolic function. However, while leptin has been 
associated with hypertension, vascular diseases, and inflammation in the context 
of obesity, it remains unknown whether its daily administration could further 
impair cardiovascular function in patients with lipodystrophy. The goal of this 
short review is to describe the cardiovascular phenotype of patients with 
lipodystrophy, speculate on the etiology of the disorders, and discuss how the 
use of murine models of lipodystrophy could be beneficial to address the 
question of the contribution of leptin to lipodystrophy-associated 
cardiovascular disease.

Elevated branched chain amino acids (BCAAs) are associated with obesity and 
insulin resistance. How long-term dietary BCAAs impact late-life health and 
lifespan is unknown. Here, we show that when dietary BCAAs are varied against a 
fixed, isocaloric macronutrient background, long-term exposure to high BCAA 
diets leads to hyperphagia, obesity and reduced lifespan. These effects are not 
due to elevated BCAA per se or hepatic mTOR activation, but rather due to a 
shift in the relative quantity of dietary BCAAs and other AAs, notably 
tryptophan and threonine. Increasing the ratio of BCAAs to these AAs resulted in 
hyperphagia and is associated with central serotonin depletion. Preventing 
hyperphagia by calorie restriction or pair-feeding averts the health costs of a 
high BCAA diet. Our data highlight a role for amino acid quality in energy 
balance and show that health costs of chronic high BCAA intakes need not be due 
to intrinsic toxicity but, rather, a consequence of hyperphagia driven by AA 
imbalance.

The global prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) points to endemic levels, 
especially considering the increase of average life expectancy worldwide. AD 
diagnosis based on early biomarkers and better knowledge of related 
pathophysiology are both crucial in the search for medical interventions that 
are able to modify AD progression. In this study we used unsupervised spectral 
unmixing statistical techniques to identify the vibrational spectral signature 
of amyloid β aggregation in neural tissues, as early biomarkers of AD in an 
animal model. We analyzed spectral images composed of a total of 55 051 Raman 
spectra obtained from the frontal cortex and hippocampus of five bitransgenic 
APPswePS1ΔE9 mice, and colocalized amyloid β plaques by other fluorescence 
techniques. The Raman signatures provided a multifrequency fingerprint 
consistent with the results of synthesized amyloid β fibrils. The fingerprint 
obtained from unmixed analysis in neural tissues is shown to provide a detailed 
image of amyloid plaques in the brain, with the potential to be used as 
biomarkers for non-invasive early diagnosis and pathophysiology studies in AD on 
the retina.

Alzheimer's disease is a devastating pathology affecting an increasing number of 
individuals following the general rise in life expectancy. Amyloid peptide 
Aβ1-42 has been identified as one of the main culprits of the disease. The 
peptide has been shown to have major effects on lipid membranes, including 
membrane fragmentation. The membrane composition has been identified as a factor 
that plays a pivotal role in regulating peptide/membrane interactions and 
several results suggest that lipid domains, or rafts, can promote 
peptide-induced membrane damage. In this work, we examined the effects of lipid 
segregation on the membrane-perturbing ability of Aβ1-42 and an oligomeric 
mutant (G37C), a peptide that shares common features with the suspected toxic 
intermediates involved in the neurodegeneration process. Atomic force microscopy 
(AFM) was used to determine the impact of these peptides on the supported lipid 
bilayers of various compositions. In 
1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine/1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine/cholesterol 
(DOPC/DPPC/cholesterol) and DOPC/sphingomyelin/cholesterol ternary mixtures, two 
systems exhibiting liquid-liquid phase separations, it was shown that Aβ1-42 and 
G37C exclusively aggregated on liquid-disordered-phase domains, creating large 
deposits and even causing membrane fragmentation for the latter composition. 
Cholesterol and ganglioside GM1, the two most documented lipids in the context 
of Alzheimer's disease, are also considered to play a crucial role in promoting 
detrimental interactions with amyloid peptides. We show that, in model 
1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) membranes, the presence 
of either cholesterol or GM1 in a proportion of 10 mol%, a content supposed to 
lead to domain formation, favoured the association of both Aβ1-42 and G37C, 
leading to a harmful membrane fragmentation. The AFM results established that 
the presence of domains favoured membrane perturbations induced by the amyloid 
peptides. It is proposed that lipid packing defects at the domain interface 
could act as adsorption and nucleation sites for the amyloid peptides. The more 
extensive bilayer perturbations induced by G37C compared to Aβ1-42 supported 
this hypothesis, indicating that oligomers that cannot mature to the fibril 
state can present considerable toxicity.

With the aim of creating a new artificial model of a biomembrane for the nuclear 
envelope, perforated vesicles were prepared employing an amphiphilic diblock 
copolymer of poly(methacrylic acid)-block-poly(methyl 
methacrylate-random-methacrylic acid-random-2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-4-piperidyl 
methacrylate), PMAA-b-P(MMA-r-MAA-r-TPMA), by polymerization-induced 
self-assembly through photo nitroxide-mediated controlled/living radical 
polymerization (photo NMP). The photo NMP in an aqueous methanol solution 
produced spherical vesicles perforated with various holes and pores in the 
surface. The perforation of the vesicles was prevented by trifluoroacetic acid 
based on the disturbance of the MAA-TPMA interaction in the hydrophobic block 
chain. The investigation of the morphology changes by the polymerization 
progress revealed that the perforated spherical vesicles were produced within 
the membrane of contorted huge vesicles that were formed during the early stage 
of the polymerization due to the extension of the hydrophobic block chain. The 
perforated vesicles were found to show a reversible thermo-responsive behavior 
in the range of 25-50 °C based on dynamic light scattering and transmittance 
measurements. The vesicles were fused and divided into much smaller vesicles at 
high temperature, but were restored by cooling. However, the restored vesicles 
only had a few holes and no pores in the surface. The rearrangement of the 
MAA-TPMA interaction at high temperature produced more morphologically stable 
non-perforated vesicles.

INTRODUCTION: The first documents describing techniques and procedures to 
improve the cognitive functioning of people with brain injuries date back to the 
17th century. Yet, governments show little interest in it and allocate scarce 
economic, personal and material resources, possibly because of the high 
mortality rate associated with brain injuries and the limited life expectancy of 
those who survive. It was not until the 20th century that neuropsychological 
rehabilitation, as it is conceived today, took its first steps.
DEVELOPMENT: The evolution of neuropsychological rehabilitation over the last 
century can be structured in three periods: establishment, expansion and 
consolidation. The first two are closely related to the procedures developed in 
times of war (mainly the First and Second World Wars), and the period of 
consolidation is linked with the transfer of the advances made in the military 
field to the civilian population and the advent of digital technologies in 
cognitive rehabilitation.
CONCLUSIONS: The history of neuropsychological rehabilitation in the 20th 
century shows two major conceptual changes, linked to profound modifications in 
the welfare policies deployed by various Western governments. The first took 
place during the First World War, when, in response to the growing number of 
veterans with brain injuries, governments decided to set up neurorehabilitation 
centres. And the second occurred in the 60s and 70s, when different governments 
transferred and generalised the advances achieved in the military sphere to the 
civilian population.

Publisher: TITLE: La rehabilitación neuropsicológica en el siglo XX.
Introducción. Los primeros documentos que describen técnicas y procedimientos 
para mejorar el funcionamiento cognitivo de las personas con lesiones cerebrales 
datan del siglo XVII. Sin embargo, los gobiernos apenas muestran interés y 
destinan escasos recursos económicos, personales y materiales, posiblemente por 
la elevada tasa de mortalidad asociada a las lesiones cerebrales y la limitada 
esperanza de vida de quienes sobreviven. No es hasta el siglo XX cuando la 
rehabilitación neuropsicológica, como se concibe actualmente, da sus primeros 
pasos. Desarrollo. La evolución de la rehabilitación neuropsicológica en el 
transcurso del pasado siglo puede estructurarse en tres períodos: período 
constitutivo, período de expansión y período de consolidación. Los dos primeros 
se relacionan estrechamente con las intervenciones desarrolladas en tiempos de 
guerra (Primera y Segunda Guerra Mundial, principalmente), y el período de 
consolidación, con la transferencia de los avances logrados en el ámbito militar 
a la población civil y la irrupción de las tecnologías digitales en 
rehabilitación cognitiva. Conclusiones. La historia de la rehabilitación 
neuropsicológica del siglo XX muestra dos grandes cambios conceptuales, ligados 
a profundos cambios en las políticas asistenciales desplegadas por diversos 
gobiernos occidentales. El primero tiene lugar durante la Primera Guerra 
Mundial, cuando, en respuesta al creciente número de veteranos con lesiones 
cerebrales, los gobiernos optan por crear centros de neurorrehabilitación. Y el 
segundo, en las décadas de los años sesenta y setenta, cuando distintos 
gobiernos transfieren y generalizan a la población civil los avances logrados en 
la esfera militar.

In an era which marks an exceptional phase of growth in science and technology, 
the acute disparities in access to healthcare still persist. So where on one 
hand scientific advancement in medicine aims at increasing life expectancy, on 
the other hand there are millions who are denied access to existing medicines. 
Patents on medicines also pose a significant barrier to access new drugs, 
especially in low and middle income countries which already suffer from poor 
health financing mechanisms. The patent laws were built on the assumption of 
incentivizing the innovators by rewarding them with the exclusive right to 
produce, sell or market the innovation. The basic premise for granting patents 
was based on the thought that it would increase investment in research and 
development promoting dynamic gains through newer innovations. However, evidence 
found to support this justification is meager. So in a situation where the drug 
gap still persists and we aim to achieve sustainable development goals by 2030, 
this paper attempts to focus on understanding how compulsory licensing has been 
used in selected cases to alleviate the major legal and political barriers to 
access medicines. The methodology comprises of cross-country comparison of 
patent framework and compulsory licensing cases. The sample selected for study 
includes both developed as well as developing countries. The aim is to evaluate 
the policy approaches used by selected countries to grant compulsory licenses 
and to identify the best practices for evidence-based policy making on 
international issues related to pharmaceutical patents. In each case, a driving 
factor has been the international extension of patent laws through trade 
agreements; first bilaterally (US-Canada) and subsequently internationally (1995 
Uruguay round, under which low- and middle-income countries were granted a grace 
period until 2005 to comply).

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The purpose of this review is to summarize the current 
standards of care for both HIV treatment and HIV prevention in 2019.
RECENT FINDINGS: Current HIV treatment is started as soon as feasible in a 
person with HIV infection and consists of a three-drug oral daily antiretroviral 
regimen, consisting of two nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors 
combined with a third drug, either an integrase inhibitor, a non-nucleoside 
reverse transcriptase inhibitor, or a protease inhibitor. Present treatment 
regimens are potent, convenient, generally well tolerated and durable, and lead 
to a normal life expectancy. Present antiretroviral-based HIV prevention 
strategies focus on treating people with HIV infection with antiretrovirals as 
soon as feasible to reduce their risk of transmitting to others, and providing 
two-drug pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and three-drug post-exposure 
prophylaxis (PEP) to those HIV-uninfected individuals who are at risk for HIV 
infection. PrEP is highly effective when used correctly. Further data on early 
antiretroviral therapy and PrEP are needed to demonstrate any impact on HIV 
epidemic control.
SUMMARY: HIV treatment and HIV prevention have improved markedly in recent years 
due to the development of oral antiretrovirals that are potent, convenient, and 
generally well tolerated, and lead to virologic suppression and decreased HIV 
transmission.

OBJECTIVE: Use of poly-L-lactic acid-based bioresorbable scaffolds (BRS) has 
been associated with increased risk of device thrombosis during the first 3 
years after implantation as compared to metallic everolimus-eluting stents 
(EES). The long-term performance of BRS relative to EES remains unknown.
METHODS: We used a Markov decision analysis model to evaluate the effectiveness 
of BRS vs. EES over a lifetime horizon. In addition to one-way sensitivity 
analyses of key variables, we evaluated the impact of optimal implantation 
technique and limiting procedures to larger vessels (>2.6 mm in diameter) on 
model results.
RESULTS: Assuming no risk of target lesion revascularization for BRS after 3 
years, we found a small increment in quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE) of 
0.02 with the use of BRS relative to EES, with benefit being observed after 21.8 
years. Optimal implantation technique and limiting to larger vessels resulted in 
larger gains in QALE (0.08 and 0.06, respectively) with BRS and shorter times to 
equipoise (6.7 and 8.3 years, respectively). Model results were highly sensitive 
to variations in the relative risk of stent thrombosis (BRS vs. EES).
CONCLUSIONS: Based on currently available data, it would take approximately 21.8 
years for the presumed late benefits of current BRS relative to EES to overcome 
the early hazard associated with their use under favorable assumptions. Optimal 
implantation technique and limiting procedures to larger vessels improved BRS 
performance and reduced time to equipoise. Eliminating the higher BRS thrombosis 
risk is necessary in developing future generations of BRS as an acceptable 
alternative to EES.

BACKGROUND: News of cancer progression is critical to setting accurate 
prognostic understanding, which guides patients' treatment decision making. This 
study examines whether religious belief in miracles modifies the effect of 
receiving news of cancer progression on change in prognostic understanding.
METHODS: In a multisite, prospective cohort study, 158 patients with advanced 
cancer, whom oncologists expected to die within 6 months, were assessed before 
and after the visit at which scan results were discussed. Before the visit, 
religious belief in miracles was assessed; after the visit, patients indicated 
what scan results they had received (cancer was worse vs cancer was stable, 
better, or other). Before and after the visit, prognostic understanding was 
assessed, and a change score was computed.
RESULTS: Approximately 78% of the participants (n = 123) reported at least some 
belief in miracles, with almost half (n = 73) endorsing the strongest possible 
belief. A significant interaction effect emerged between receiving news of 
cancer progression and belief in miracles in predicting change in prognostic 
understanding (b = -0.18, P = .04). Receiving news of cancer progression was 
associated with improvement in the accuracy of prognostic understanding among 
patients with weak belief in miracles (b = 0.67, P = .007); however, among 
patients with moderate to strong belief in miracles, news of cancer progression 
was unrelated to change in prognostic understanding (b = 0.08, P = .64).
CONCLUSIONS: Religious belief in miracles was highly prevalent and diminished 
the impact of receiving news of cancer progression on prognostic understanding. 
Assessing patients' beliefs in miracles may help to optimize the effectiveness 
of "bad news" scan result discussions.

The production of positron emitters with millisecond half-life during helium 
beam radiotherapy.

Therapy with helium ions is currently receiving significantly increasing 
interest because helium ions have a sharper penumbra than protons and undergo 
less fragmentation than carbon ions and thus require less complicated dose 
calculations. For any ion of interest in hadron therapy, the accuracy of dose 
delivery is limited by range uncertainties. This has led to efforts by several 
groups to develop in vivo verification techniques, including positron emission 
tomography (PET), for monitoring of the dose delivery. Beam-on PET monitoring 
during proton therapy through the detection of short-lived positron emitters 
such as 12N (T 1/2  =  11 ms), an emerging PET technique, provides an attractive 
option given the achievable range accuracy, minimal susceptibility to biological 
washout and provision of near prompt feedback. Extension of this approach to 
helium ions requires information on the production yield of relevant short-lived 
positron emitters. This study presents the first measurements of the production 
of short-lived positron emitters in water, graphite, calcium and phosphorus 
targets irradiated with 59 MeV/u 3He and 50 MeV/u 4He beams. For these targets, 
the most produced short-lived nuclides are 13O/12N (T 1/2  =  8.6/11 ms) on 
water, 13O/12N on graphite, 43Ti/41Sc/42Sc (T 1/2  =  509-680 ms) on calcium, 
28P (T 1/2  =  268 ms) on phosphorus. A translation of the results from 
elemental targets to PMMA and representative tissues such as adipose tissue, 
muscle, compact and cortical bone, shows the dominance of 13O/12N in at least 
the first 20 s of an irradiation with 4He and somewhat longer with 3He. As the 
production of 13O/12N in a 3He irradiation is 3-4 times higher than in a 4He 
irradiation, from a statistical point of view, range verification using 13O/12N 
PET imaging will be about 2 times more precise for a 3He irradiation compared to 
a 4He irradiation.

BACKGROUND: Most guidelines for major depressive disorder recommend initial 
treatment with either a second-generation antidepressant (SGA) or cognitive 
behavioral therapy (CBT). Although most trials suggest that these treatments 
have similar efficacy, their health economic implications are uncertain.
OBJECTIVE: To quantify the cost-effectiveness of CBT versus SGA for initial 
treatment of depression.
DESIGN: Decision analytic model.
DATA SOURCES: Relative effectiveness data from a meta-analysis of randomized 
controlled trials; additional clinical and economic data from other 
publications.
TARGET POPULATION: Adults with newly diagnosed major depressive disorder in the 
United States.
TIME HORIZON: 1 to 5 years.
PERSPECTIVES: Health care sector and societal.
INTERVENTION: Initial treatment with either an SGA or group and individual CBT.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Costs in 2014 U.S. dollars, quality-adjusted life-years 
(QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios.
RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: In model projections, CBT produced higher QALYs 
(3 days more at 1 year and 20 days more at 5 years) with higher costs at 1 year 
(health care sector, $900; societal, $1500) but lower costs at 5 years (health 
care sector, -$1800; societal, -$2500).
RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: In probabilistic sensitivity analyses, SGA had 
a 64% to 77% likelihood of having an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 
$100 000 or less per QALY at 1 year; CBT had a 73% to 77% likelihood at 5 years. 
Uncertainty in the relative risk for relapse of depression contributed the most 
to overall uncertainty in the optimal treatment.
LIMITATION: Long-term trials comparing CBT and SGA are lacking.
CONCLUSION: Neither SGAs nor CBT provides consistently superior 
cost-effectiveness relative to the other. Given many patients' preference for 
psychotherapy over pharmacotherapy, increasing patient access to CBT may be 
warranted.

Objective: To evaluate the burden and to describe the characteristics of spatial 
distribution caused by malignant tumors among different administrative areas in 
Guangzhou from 2010- 2013. Methods: Based on data from the Cancer Registry 
system and population in Guangzhou in 2010- 2013, disability-adjusted life year 
(DALY) was assessed on the disease burden of cancer, in accordance with the 
method used in the Global Burden of Disease study. Results: The crude incidence 
rates of cancer appeared as 256.22/10(5) in 2010-2011 and 270.04/10(5) in 
2012-2013, with the crude mortality rates as 143.17/10(5) and 148.01/10(5), 
respectively, in Guangzhou. Cancers caused 606 238.95 DALYs in 2010-2011 and 623 
763.80 DALYs in 2012-2013 for both sexes and 37.63 and 37.81 person year per 1 
000 persons, with the standardized DALY rates as 34.51‰, 34.00‰ respectively. 
Three administrative districts (Yuexiu, Haizhu and Liwan) were with the largest 
disease burden of cancers that accounted for 45% of the DALYs for the whole 
Conghua district, with liver cancer was the leading cancer on DALYs, and 
tracheal, bronchus and lung cancer ranked the first in the other districts. 
Conclusions: In Guangzhou, disease burden caused by cancers was both prominently 
seen in the newly developed urban area and the old districts. It remains an 
arduous task to continue programs on control and prevention of cancers in this 
city.

Future Preventive Gene Therapy of Polygenic Diseases from a Population Genetics 
Perspective.

With the accumulation of scientific knowledge of the genetic causes of common 
diseases and continuous advancement of gene-editing technologies, gene therapies 
to prevent polygenic diseases may soon become possible. This study endeavored to 
assess population genetics consequences of such therapies. Computer simulations 
were used to evaluate the heterogeneity in causal alleles for polygenic diseases 
that could exist among geographically distinct populations. The results show 
that although heterogeneity would not be easily detectable by epidemiological 
studies following population admixture, even significant heterogeneity would not 
impede the outcomes of preventive gene therapies. Preventive gene therapies 
designed to correct causal alleles to a naturally-occurring neutral state of 
nucleotides would lower the prevalence of polygenic early- to middle-age-onset 
diseases in proportion to the decreased population relative risk attributable to 
the edited alleles. The outcome would manifest differently for late-onset 
diseases, for which the therapies would result in a delayed disease onset and 
decreased lifetime risk; however, the lifetime risk would increase again with 
prolonging population life expectancy, which is a likely consequence of such 
therapies. If the preventive heritable gene therapies were to be applied on a 
large scale, the decreasing frequency of risk alleles in populations would 
reduce the disease risk or delay the age of onset, even with a fraction of the 
population receiving such therapies. With ongoing population admixture, all 
groups would benefit over generations.

INTRODUCTION: Imminent fracture risk, or fractures within 2 years of an initial 
fracture, is a pressing issue worldwide. Hong Kong is a city with one of the 
longest life expectancies. The concern of fragility fractures and the imminent 
risk of a subsequent fracture is becoming a top priority. The objective of this 
study was to present the epidemiology of incident fragility fractures of all 
public acute hospitals and the imminent risk of a subsequent fracture in Hong 
Kong.
METHODOLOGY: This was a retrospective population-based analysis. Patient records 
from all acute hospitals in Hong Kong from 1 January 2004 to 31 December 2018 
were retrieved for patients ≥ 50 years of age with hip, distal radius, or 
proximal humerus fractures. Secondary fractures and falls were identified in the 
subsequent 5 years. Post hoc analysis in recent 2013-2018 period was performed. 
Overall survival (re-fracture incidence) on age subgroups using Kaplan survival 
analysis and variables was compared using the log-rank test. Cox proportional 
hazard regressions, obtaining the hazard ratios (HR) and their respective 95% 
confidence intervals (CI), were used.
RESULTS: There is an overall increasing trend of fragility fractures (hip, 
distal radius, proximal humerus) from 5596 in 2004 to 8465 in 2018. The average 
cumulative imminent risk of fractures from recent 5 years is 3.87% at 1 year and 
6.50% at 2 years. 49.5% of the patients with a secondary fracture occurred 
within 2 years since the initial major fragility fracture. Post hoc analysis in 
recent 2013-2018 period (N = 7039) showed male patients were 1.21 times more 
likely to have further fractures with time (HR = 1.21 (1.02, 1.45), p = 0.03) 
compared with female patients. Patients over age 95 were 2.01 times higher than 
patients of age under 75 to have further fracture over time.
CONCLUSIONS: Following an initial fracture, prompt treatment strategies should 
be adopted to avoid imminent risk of fractures. This window of opportunity in 
the first 2 years is a golden period to treat osteoporosis and prevent falls. 
Our post hoc analysis has shown that male patients and patients older than 95 
are at even higher risk. Clinicians and allied healthcare professionals should 
be alert on these patients.

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a multiorgan disease, and gastrointestinal (GI) 
manifestations can contribute to significant morbidity and mortality for 
individuals with CF. Up to 85% of patients with CF experience GI symptoms, thus 
addressing the GI aspects of this disease is paramount. With the advent of 
highly effective CF transmembrane conductance regulator modulators that are 
increasingly available, many individuals with CF now have significantly improved 
life expectancy. With these advances, GI manifestations that can be a detriment 
to quality of life such as gastroesophageal reflux disease, dysbiosis, and 
chronic abdominal pain have become a priority for patients and caregivers. In 
addition, as individuals have increased longevity, it has become essential for 
care providers to be aware of topics such as hepatobiliary disease and 
colorectal cancer screening. An understanding of the wide scope of GI 
manifestations in CF can enable providers to optimize the overall health and 
well-being of their patients. In this review, we aim to provide an up-to-date 
overview of key aspects of GI and hepatic disease in CF.

Cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease is characterized by the development of 
progressive bronchiectasis and impaired lung function with severe airflow 
obstruction. CF patients suffer from shortened life expectancy, primarily driven 
by respiratory failure. The mechanism by which CF lung disease develops is the 
result of an interplay of multiple intrinsic and extrinsic factors including 
genotype, abnormalities in mucus composition and movement, chronic inflammation, 
and chronic airway infection. Although all CF patients are at increased risk for 
pulmonary complications including hemoptysis, pneumothorax, pulmonary 
hypertension, and chronic hypoxic and hypercapnic respiratory failure, the risk 
of developing these complications increases with progression of lung disease. 
The focus of this article is to summarize the pathophysiology, epidemiology, and 
management of these key pulmonary complications.
