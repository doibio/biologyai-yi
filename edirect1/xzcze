OBJECTIVE: In most European countries, political reforms gradually increase the 
statutory retirement age to counter the economic costs of a growing elderly 
population. However, working to a high age may be difficult for people with hard 
physical labour. We aim to study the impact of high physical work demands on 
working life expectancy (WLE).
METHODS: We combined physical work demands assessed by job exposure matrix (JEM) 
and longitudinal high-quality national registers (outcome) in 1.6 million Danish 
workers to estimate WLE and years of sickness absence, unemployment and 
disability pension. The JEM value for physical work demand is a summarised score 
of eight ergonomic exposures for 317 occupations groups, sex and age. The WLE 
was estimated using a multistate proportional hazards model in a 4-year 
follow-up period.
RESULTS: Individuals with high physical work demands had a significantly lower 
WLE, than those with low physical work demands, with largest differences seen 
among women. At age 30 years, women with high physical work demands can expect 
3.1 years less working, 11 months more of sickness absence and 16 months more of 
unemployment than low-exposed women. For 30-year-old men, the corresponding 
results were 2.0 years, 12 months and 8 months, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Our findings show that high physical work demands are a marked risk 
factor for a shortened working life and increased years of sickness absence and 
unemployment. The results are important when selecting high-risk occupations, 
and expand the knowledge base for informed political decision making concerning 
statutory retirement age.

OBJECTIVES: There are established methods for occupational epidemiological 
cohort analysis, such as proportional hazards regression, that are well suited 
to aetiological research and yield parameter estimates that allow for succinct 
communication among academics. However, these methods are not necessarily well 
suited for evaluation of health impacts of policy choices and communication to 
decision makers. An informed decision about a policy that impacts health and 
safety requires a valid estimate of the policy's potential impact.
METHODS: We propose methods for data summarisation that may facilitate 
communication with managers, workers and their advocates. We calculate measures 
of effect in a framework for competing events, graphically display potential 
impacts on cause-specific mortality under policy alternatives and contrast these 
results to estimates obtained using standard Poisson regression methods. Methods 
are illustrated using a cohort mortality study of 28 546 Ontario uranium miners 
hired between 1950 and 1996 and followed through 2007.
RESULTS: A standard regression analysis yields a positive association between 
cumulative radon progeny exposure and all-cause mortality (log(RR per 100 
WLM)=0.09; SE=0.02). The proposed method yields an estimate of the expected gain 
in life expectancy (approximately 6 months per worker) and reduction of 261 lung 
cancer deaths under a policy that eliminated occupational radon progeny 
exposure.
CONCLUSIONS: The proposed method shifts attention from covariate-adjusted risk 
ratios or rate ratios to estimates of deaths that are avoided or delayed under a 
potential policy. The approach may help inform decision-making and strengthen 
the connection of epidemiological approaches to data analysis with developments 
in decision theory and systems engineering to improve health and safety.

BACKGROUND: Nonoperative management of rectal cancer was introduced for patients 
with clinical complete response after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy to avoid 
short- and long-term surgical morbidity related to radical resection.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine the expected life-years 
and quality-adjusted life-years for nonoperative management and radical 
resection of locally advanced rectal cancer after clinical complete response 
following neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy.
DESIGN: Markov modeling was used to simulate nonoperative management and radical 
surgery for a base case scenario over a 10-year time horizon. Estimates for 
various clinical variables were obtained after extensive literature search. 
Outcome was expressed in both life-years and quality-adjusted life-years. 
Deterministic sensitivity analyses were completed to assess the impact of 
variation in key parameters.
SETTING: A decision model using a Markov model was designed.
PATIENTS: The base case was a 65-year-old man with a distal rectal tumor who had 
achieved clinical complete response after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Life-years and quality-adjusted life-years were measured.
RESULTS: Quality-adjusted life-years (5.79 for nonoperative management vs 5.62 
for radical surgery) and life-years (6.92 for nonoperative management vs 6.96 
for radical surgery) were similar between nonoperative management and radical 
surgery. The preferred treatment strategy changed with variations in the 
probability of local regrowth in nonoperative management, the probability of 
salvage surgery for regrowth in nonoperative management, utilities associated 
with nonoperative management and low anterior resection, and the utility of low 
anterior resection syndrome. The model was not sensitive to (dis)utilities 
associated with stoma, chemotherapy, or postoperative morbidity and mortality.
LIMITATIONS: The study was limited by assumptions inherent to modeling studies.
CONCLUSIONS: Nonoperative management and radical surgery resulted in similar 
(quality-adjusted) life-years. Nonoperative management should therefore be 
considered as a reasonable treatment option. See Video Abstract at

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of screw fixation versus 
hemiarthroplasty for nondisplaced femoral neck fractures in low-demand elderly 
patients.
METHODS: We constructed a Markov decision model using a low-demand, 80-year-old 
patient as the base case. Costs, health-state utilities, mortality rates, and 
transition probabilities were obtained from published literature. The simulation 
model was cycled until all patients were deceased to estimate lifetime costs and 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). The primary outcome was the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio with a willingness-to-pay threshold set at $100,000 per 
QALY. We performed sensitivity analyses to assess our parameter assumptions.
RESULTS: For the base case, hemiarthroplasty was associated with greater quality 
of life (2.96 QALYs) compared with screw fixation (2.73 QALYs) with lower cost 
($23,467 vs. $25,356). Cost per QALY for hemiarthroplasty was $7925 compared 
with $9303 in screw fixation. Hemiarthroplasty provided better outcomes at lower 
cost, indicating dominance over screw fixation.
CONCLUSIONS: Hemiarthroplasty is a cost-effective option compared with screw 
fixation for the treatment of nondisplaced femoral neck fractures in the 
low-demand elderly. Medical comorbidities and other factors that impact 
perioperative mortality should also be considered in the treatment decision.

PURPOSE: This study aimed to perform a systematic review to analyse the seasonal 
concentration and ecological risk assessment of heavy metals (HMs) in seawater 
and sediment samples collected from the coastline of Jam city in Bushehr, Iran.
METHODS: A total of 96 sediment and seawater samples were collected from 16 
sampling stations during the spring, summer, autumn, and winter of 2017. Then, 
the concentrations of Pb, Ni, Cd, Cr, Cu, Zn, and Fe were determined. Finally, 
the pollution load index (PLI), ecological risk (Er), and environmental risk 
(RI) were calculated to assess the HM ecological risk.
RESULTS: The results showed that the mean concentrations of HMs were lower than 
the maximum acceptable concentration by SQG and NOAA. In addition, the PLI 
assessed a low pollution load level in the region. The ER and RI results also 
showed that the region was at low risk, and the metal risk was classified as 
Cd > Cu > Pb > Ni > Zn > Cr. In some samples, the mean concentrations of HM were 
found to be higher with a statistically significant difference (P˂0.05). The 
results also showed that sediments were engaging in a moderate Er by Cd.
CONCLUSIONS: Generally, the rapid growth of urbanization, as well as industrial 
and human activities, along this coastline and area has increased the pollutants 
dumped into the seawater and sediments. Thus, it is necessary to take regular 
monitoring programs and develop better management strategies to minimize the 
amount of HMs entering into this coastal area.

BACKGROUND: Economic modeling is widely used in estimating cost-effectiveness in 
type 2 diabetes mellitus. Because type 2 diabetes is complex and patients 
are heterogenous, the cohort modeling approach may generate biased estimates of 
costeffectiveness. The IHE Diabetes Cohort Model (IHE-DCM) was constructed using 
the cohort approach as an alternative for stakeholders with limited resources, 
some of whom have voiced reasonable concerns about a lack of transparency with 
type 2 diabetes micro-simulation models and long run times.
OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to inform decision makers by 
investigating the direction and magnitude of bias of IHE-DCM cost-effectiveness 
estimates that can be attributed to the cohort modeling approach.
METHODS: Simulation scenarios inspired by the 9th Mount Hood Diabetes Challenge 
were simulated with IHE-DCM and with a micro-simulation model, the Economic and 
Health Outcomes Model of T2DM (ECHO-T2DM), and key metrics (absolute and 
incremental costs and quality-adjusted life-years, event rates, and 
cost-effectiveness) were compared for evidence of systematic differences. The 
models were harmonized to the extent possible to ensure that differences were 
driven primarily by the unit of observation and not by other model differences.
RESULTS: IHE-DCM run times were faster and IHE-DCM produced uniformly larger 
estimates of absolute life-years, quality-adjusted life-years, and costs than 
ECHO-T2DM but smaller between-arm (incremental) differences. Estimated 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratios and net monetary benefits varied similarly 
and predictably across the scenarios. On average, IHE-DCM estimates of 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratios and net monetary benefits were CAN$269 
(3%) and CAN$2935 (10%) smaller, respectively, than ECHO-T2DM.
CONCLUSIONS: There was little evidence that estimated cost-effectiveness 
metrics, the outcomes that matter most to stakeholders, differed systematically.

Background: Blood flow restriction (BFR) applied during low intensity resistance 
training (LIRT) exercise produces hypertrophy and strength gains equivalent to 
traditional training. The effectiveness of BFR-LIRT on persons with Parkinson 
Disease (PD) has not been investigated.Objective: To determine the effects of 
BFR-LIRT on a recreationally active person with PD in regards to function, 
strength, Restless Leg Syndrome (RLS) and safety. Methods: A single subject, 
A-B-A design was utilized. Each phase lasted 6 weeks. Outcome measures included: 
30-second sit-to-stand; Timed Up and Go (TUG); RLS Questionnaire; 3-RM of Cybex 
Leg Press (LP); Leg Curl (LC); and Leg Extension (LE) measured every 3 weeks for 
18 weeks. The intervention phase (B, weeks 6-12) included four lower extremity 
resistance exercises (LP, LC, LE, calf presses on the LP) with the addition of 
BFR. The two standard deviation band method was used to determine 
significance.Results: All outcome measures except the TUG improved significantly 
by the end of intervention phase.Conclusion: The combination of BFR with LIRT 
safely lead to an increase in lower extremity strength and function in a person 
with PD, while decreasing their RLS (improvement from moderate to mild symptoms) 
resulting in a better quality of life for the participant.

IMPORTANCE: Clinical and economic consequences of statin treatment guidelines 
supplemented by targeted coronary artery calcium (CAC) assessment have not been 
evaluated in African American individuals, who are at increased risk for 
atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and less likely than non-African American 
individuals to receive statin therapy.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the 2013 American College of 
Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guideline without a 
recommendation for CAC assessment vs the 2018 ACC/AHA guideline recommendation 
for use of a non-0 CAC score measured on one occasion to target 
generic-formulation, moderate-intensity statin treatment in African American 
individuals at risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A microsimulation model was designed to 
estimate life expectancy, quality of life, costs, and health outcomes over a 
lifetime horizon. African American-specific data from 472 participants in the 
Jackson Heart Study (JHS) at intermediate risk for atherosclerotic 
cardiovascular disease and other US population-specific data on individuals from 
published sources were used. Data analysis was conducted from November 11, 2018, 
to November 1, 2019.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life-years 
(QALYs), discounted at 3% annually.
RESULTS: In a model-based economic evaluation informed in part by follow-up 
data, the analysis was focused on 472 individuals in the JHS at intermediate 
risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease; mean (SD) age was 63 (6.7) 
years. The sample included 243 women (51.5%) and 229 men (48.5%). Of these, 178 
of 304 participants (58.6%) who underwent CAC assessment had a non-0 CAC score. 
In the base-case scenario, implementation of 2013 ACC/AHA guidelines without CAC 
assessment provided a greater quality-adjusted life expectancy (0.0027 QALY) at 
a higher cost ($428.97) compared with the 2018 ACC/AHA guideline strategy with 
CAC assessment, yielding an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 
$158 325/QALY, which is considered to represent low-value care by the ACC/AHA 
definition. The 2018 ACC/AHA guideline strategy with CAC assessment provided 
greater quality-adjusted life expectancy at a lower cost compared with the 2013 
ACC/AHA guidelines without CAC assessment when there was a strong patient 
preference to avoid use of daily medication therapy. In probability sensitivity 
analyses, the 2018 ACC/AHA guideline strategy with CAC assessment was 
cost-effective compared with the 2013 ACC/AHA guidelines without CAC assessment 
in 76% of simulations at a willingness-to-pay value of $100 000/QALY when there 
was a preference to lose 2 weeks of perfect health to avoid 1 decade of daily 
therapy.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: A CAC assessment-guided strategy for statin therapy 
appears to be cost-effective compared with initiating statin therapy in all 
African American individuals at intermediate risk for atherosclerotic 
cardiovascular disease and may provide greater quality-adjusted life expectancy 
at a lower cost than a non-CAC assessment-guided strategy when there is a strong 
patient preference to avoid the need for daily medication. Coronary artery 
calcium testing may play a role in shared decision-making regarding statin use.

OBJECTIVE: The Program of Active Consumer Engagement in Self-Management in 
Epilepsy (PACES) is an evidenced-based self-management intervention for adults 
with epilepsy. Prior randomized controlled trial (RCT) data show that PACES 
reduces depression and improves self-management, self-efficacy, and quality of 
life for 6 months postprogram. The objective of this study was to replicate a 
PACES RCT with key extensions: more diverse patient pool from community-based 
epilepsy centers; option for telephone-based participation; and longer follow-up 
(12 months with booster support for intervention group), to examine duration of 
impact and inform dissemination and implementation.
METHODS: Participants were adults with chronic epilepsy (n = 101) without 
serious mental illness or substantive intellectual impairment, recruited from 
three epilepsy centers. Participants were randomly assigned to intervention or 
waitlist control groups. Outcomes included the Epilepsy Self-Management Scale 
(ESMS), Epilepsy Self-Efficacy Scale (ESES), Quality of Life in Epilepsy-31, 
Patient Health Questionnaire-9, and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, administered 
at baseline, postintervention (8 weeks), and 6 and 12 months postintervention. 
Intervention was an 8-week group of five to eight adults co-led by a 
psychologist and trained peer with epilepsy that met once per week by 
teleconference or in person at a hospital for 60-75 minutes. Topics included 
medical, psychosocial, cognitive, and self-management aspects of epilepsy, as 
well as community integration and epilepsy-related communication. Treatment 
group provided program evaluation.
RESULTS: PACES participants (n = 49) improved relative to controls (n = 52) on 
the ESES (P < .022) and overall distress composite (P = .008). At 6 months, 
PACES participants remained improved on the ESES (P = .008) and composite 
(P = .001), and were improved on the ESMS (P = .005). At 12 months, PACES 
participants remained improved on the ESMS (P = .006) and were improved on an 
overall distress composite of combined measures (P = .018). Attrition was low 
(<6% in each group), and all program satisfaction ratings exceeded 4.0/5.0.
SIGNIFICANCE: A consumer-generated epilepsy self-management program with broad 
psychosocial and medical emphasis can be effectively delivered by telephone or 
in person and facilitates long-term epilepsy self-management, adjustment, and 
coping up to 1 year after treatment.

Therapeutic Potential of Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors against Neurodegeneration: 
The Perspective of the Medicinal Chemist.

Increasing human life expectancy prompts the development of novel remedies for 
cognitive decline: 44 million people worldwide are affected by dementia, and 
this number is predicted to triple by 2050. Acetylcholinesterase and 
N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors represent the targets of currently available 
drugs for Alzheimer's disease, which are characterized by limited efficacy. 
Thus, the search for therapeutic agents with alternative or combined mechanisms 
of action is wide open. Since variations in 3',5'-cyclic adenosine 
monophosphate, 3',5'-cyclic guanosine monophosphate, and/or nitric oxide levels 
interfere with downstream pathways involved in memory processes, evidence 
supporting the potential of phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors in contrasting 
neurodegeneration should be critically considered. For the preparation of this 
Review, more than 140 scientific papers were retrieved by searching PubMed and 
Scopus databases. A systematic approach was adopted when overviewing the 
different PDE isoforms, taking into account details on brain localization, 
downstream molecular mechanisms, and inhibitors currently under study, according 
to available in vitro and in vivo data. In the context of drug repurposing, a 
section focusing on PDE5 was introduced. Original computational studies were 
performed to rationalize the emerging evidence that suggests the role of PDE5 
inhibitors as multi-target agents against neurodegeneration. Moreover, since 
such compounds must cross the blood-brain barrier and reach inhibitory 
concentrations in the central nervous system to exert their therapeutic 
activity, physicochemical parameters were analyzed and discussed. Taken 
together, literature and computational data suggest that some PDE5 inhibitors, 
such as tadalafil, represent promising candidates.

OBJECTIVE: This paper introduces a novel method to evaluate the local impact of 
behavioral scenarios on disease prevalence and burden with representative 
individual level data while ensuring that the model is in agreement with the 
qualitative patterns of global relative risk (RR) estimates. The method is used 
to estimate the impact of behavioral scenarios on the burden of disease due to 
ischemic heart disease (IHD) and diabetes in the Turkish adult population.
METHODS: Disease specific Hierarchical Bayes (HB) models estimate the individual 
disease probability as a function of behaviors, demographics, socio-economics 
and other controls, where constraints are specified based on the global RR 
estimates. The simulator combines the counterfactual disease probability 
estimates with disability adjusted life year (DALY)-per-prevalent-case estimates 
and rolls up to the targeted population level, thus reflecting the local joint 
distribution of exposures. The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2016 study 
meta-analysis results guide the analysis of the Turkish National Health Surveys 
(2008 to 2016) that contain more than 90 thousand observations.
FINDINGS: The proposed Qualitative Informative HB models do not sacrifice 
predictive accuracy versus benchmarks (logistic regression and HB models with 
non-informative and numerical informative priors) while agreeing with the global 
patterns. In the Turkish adult population, Increasing Physical Activity reduces 
the DALYs substantially for both IHD by 8.6% (6.4% 11.2%), and Diabetes by 8.1% 
(5.8% 10.6%), (90% uncertainty intervals). Eliminating Smoking and Second-hand 
Smoke predominantly decreases the IHD burden 13.1% (10.4% 15.8%) versus Diabetes 
2.8% (1.1% 4.6%). Increasing Fruit and Vegetable Consumption, on the other hand, 
reduces IHD DALYs by 4.1% (2.8% 5.4%) while not improving the Diabetes burden 
0.1% (0% 0.1%).
CONCLUSION: While the national RR estimates are in qualitative agreement with 
the global patterns, the scenario impact estimates are markedly different than 
the attributable risk estimates from the GBD analysis and allow evaluation of 
practical scenarios with multiple behaviors.

Optimizing barley (hordeum vulgare L.) production in Idaho and other parts of 
the Pacific Northwest (PNW) should focus on farm resource management. The effect 
of post-harvest residue management on barley residue decomposition has not been 
adequately studied. Thus, the objective of this study was to determine the 
effect of residue placement (surface vs. incorporated), residue size (chopped 
vs. ground-sieved) and soil type (sand and sandy loam) on barley residue 
decomposition. A 50-day(d) laboratory incubation experiment was conducted at a 
temperature of 25°C at the Aberdeen Research and Extension Center, Aberdeen, 
Idaho, USA. Following the study, a Markov-Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) modeling 
approach was applied to investigate the first-order decay kinetics of barley 
residue. An accelerated initial flush of residue carbon(C)-mineralization was 
measured for the sieved (Day 1) compared to chopped (Day 3 to 5) residues for 
both surface incorporated applications. The highest evolution of carbon dioxide 
(CO2)-C of 8.3 g kg-1 dry residue was observed on Day 1 from the 
incorporated-sieved application for both soils. The highest and lowest amount of 
cumulative CO2-C released and percentage residue decomposed over 50-d was 
observed for surface-chopped (107 g kg-1 dry residue and 27%, respectively) and 
incorporated-sieved (69 g kg-1 dry residue and 18%, respectively) residues, 
respectively. There were no significant differences in C-mineralization from 
barley residue based on soil type or its interactions with residue placement and 
size (p >0.05). The largest decay constant k of 0.0083 d-1 was calculated for 
surface-chopped residue where the predicted half-life was 80 d, which did not 
differ from surface sieved or incorporated chopped. In contrast, 
incorporated-sieved treatments only resulted in a k of 0.0054 d-1 and would need 
an additional 48 d to decompose 50% of the residue. Future residue decomposition 
studies under field conditions are warranted to verify the residue 
C-mineralization and its impact on residue management.

INTRODUCTION: In Brazil, little is known about the trends of chronic respiratory 
diseases, which was estimated as the third leading cause of deaths in 2017 
worldwide.
METHODS: We analyzed Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2017 estimates for 
prevalence, incidence, mortality, disability-adjusted life years (DALY), a 
summary measure of years of life lost (YLLs) and years lived with disability 
(YLDs), and risk factors attributable to chronic respiratory diseases in Brazil 
from 1990 to 2017.
RESULTS: The overall estimates have decreased for all ages and both sexes, and 
for age-standardized rates. For age-adjusted prevalence, there was a 21% 
reduction, and nearly 16% reduction for incidence. There was a 42% reduction in 
mortality for both sexes, though the rate of deaths for men was 30% greater than 
the rate in women. The increase in the number of DALY was essentially due to the 
population growth and population ageing. We observed a 34% increase in the 
absolute number of DALY in Brazil over the study period. The majority of the 
DALY rates were due to Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). For all 
ages and both sexes, smoking was the main attributable risk factor.
CONCLUSION: In Brazil, although mortality, prevalence and incidence for chronic 
respiratory diseases have decreased over the years, attention should be taken to 
the DALYs increase. Smoking remained as the main risk factor, despite the 
significant decrease of tobacco use, reinforcing the need for maintenance of 
policies and programs directed at its cessation.

Malignant pleural effusion frequently complicates both solid and hematologic 
malignancies and is associated with high morbidity, mortality, and health care 
costs. Although no pleura-specific therapy is known to impact survival, both 
pleurodesis and indwelling pleural catheter (IPC) placement can significantly 
alleviate symptoms and improve quality of life. The optimal choice of therapy in 
terms of efficacy and particularly cost-effectiveness depends on patient 
preferences and individual characteristics, including lung expansion and life 
expectancy. Attempting chemical pleurodesis through an IPC in the outpatient 
setting appears to be a particularly promising approach in the absence of a 
nonexpandable lung.

OBJECTIVES: To analyze the cost-effectiveness of prostate cancer screening among 
Chinese men.
METHODS: A cost-effectiveness analysis was performed from a societal perspective 
using a Markov model to compare 2 strategies: the population-based screening 
strategy and the current clinical diagnostic strategy. Relevant parameters were 
retrieved from published literature data and surveys, and univariate sensitivity 
analysis was used to assess the robustness of the model. We simulated the health 
outcomes for the next 25 years for 100 000 men and calculated the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER).
RESULTS: This study found that the population-based screening strategy, compared 
with the clinical diagnostic strategy, could save 756.61 quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs) for the hypothetical population. The ICER for the 
population-based screening strategy was ¥14 747.11/QALY, and this value was less 
than the willingness-to-pay threshold of ¥64 520. With life-year gains (LYGs) as 
the model output, the population-based screening strategy yielded an ICER of ¥16 
470.45/LYG. The univariate sensitivity analyses showed that the ICER was 
sensitive to the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test fee, the proportion 
diagnosed with low-grade prostate cancer (PC) in the population-based strategy, 
and the proportion diagnosed with intermediate-grade PC in the population-based 
strategy.
CONCLUSIONS: Prostate cancer screening based on PSA test results appears to be 
cost-effective for Chinese men who are in good health and have a life expectancy 
of more than 10 years. Nevertheless, this finding needs to be further studied 
with more treatment cost parameters (treatment costs related to impotence and 
urinary incontinence) and using local utility value information.

OBJECTIVES: Periodontal disease (PD) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are chronic 
immuno-inflammatory conditions with osteolysis being a hallmark feature. The 
influence of PD on RA's systemic inflammatory status and disease activity 
remains unclear. The objective of this study was to assess the systemic 
inflammation and disease activity of RA under the influence of PD.
METHODS: In this case-control study, 38 RA patients (19 with PD and 19 without 
PD) were compared to 38 non-RA patients and 12 healthy controls. Periodontal 
parameters (bleeding on probing (BOP), probing pocket depth (PPD), PPD Total, 
PPD Disease and marginal bone loss (MBL) were determined. Serological analyses 
included quantification of 92 inflammatory biomarkers using a multiplex 
proximity extension assay, anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPA), 
rheumatoid factor (IgM-RF) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). RA disease 
activity was determined using Disease Activity Score for 28 joints (DAS28). All 
RA patients were on medication.
RESULTS: IgM-RF was higher in RA patients with PD. PD conditions were more 
severe in the non-RA group. Inflammatory biomarkers (IL-10RB, IL-18, CSF-1, 
NT-3, TRAIL, PD-L1, LIF-R, SLAMF1, FGF-19, TRANCE, CST5, STAMPB, SIRT2, TWEAK, 
CX3CL1, CXCL5, MCP-1) were significantly higher in RA patients with PD than RA 
without PD. DAS28 associated with twice as many inflammatory biomarkers in RA 
patients with PD whereas IgM-RF and ACPA associated more frequently with 
biomarkers in the RA without PD group. IgM-RF correlated inversely with BOP.
CONCLUSION: Periodontal disease augments systemic inflammation in RA. A profound 
influence exists independent of autoimmune status.

Nerve growth factor (NGF), a typical neurotrophin, has been characterized by the 
regulation of neuronal cell differentiation and survival involved in learning 
and memory functions. NGF has a main role in neurite extension and synapse 
formation by activating the cyclic adenosine 
monophosphate-response-element-binding protein (CREB) in the hippocampus. The 
purpose of this study was to determine whether a mixture of Gotu Kola, Cnidium 
fruit, and Goji berry (KYJ) enhances memory function by inducing NGF-mediated 
actions both in vitro and in vivo. The KYJ combination increased NGF 
concentration and neurite length in C6 glioma and N2a neuronal cells, 
respectively. Additionally, we discovered memory-enhancing effects of KYJ 
through increased NGF-mediated synapse maturation, CREB phosphorylation, and 
cell differentiation in the mouse hippocampus. These findings suggest that this 
combination may be a potential nootropic cognitive enhancer via the induction of 
NGF and NGF-dependent activities.

Photoelectronic memory based on nitride multiple quantum wells and the hybrid of 
graphene nanoflakes and a-IGZO film.

Liou YR, Lin HY, Cai SY, Liao YM, Lin TY, Chen YF.

Optical memories are vitally important for the future development of high speed 
and low cost information technologies. Current optical memory devices still 
suffer from difficulties such as scaling-down of size, short-life expectancy, 
and non-volatility without the control of a gate electrode. To resolve these 
obstacles, a robust photoelectronic memory device is designed and demonstrated 
based on the integration of amorphous InGaZnO (a-IGZO), GNSs, and nitride 
multiple-quantum-wells light-emitting diode (MQWs LED). Utilizing the inherent 
nature of the band alignment between a-IGZO and graphene nanosheets (GNSs), 
electrons can transfer from a-IGZO to GNSs causing a persistent 
photoconductivity (PPC). With the long-lasting lifetime of PPC, the signal can 
be written optically and the encoded signal can be read both electrically and 
optically. The read and write processes reveal little current degradation for 
more than 10,000 sec, even repeated for more than hundred times. The device can 
convert invisible information to visible signal, and the encoded information can 
be simply erased under a reversed bias without a gate electrode. In addition, 
the memory device possesses a simple vertically stacked structure for 3D 
integration, and it is compatible with established technologies.
