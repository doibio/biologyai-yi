BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Although it has become clear that aneurysmal and occlusive 
arterial disease represent two distinct etiologic entities, it is still unknown 
whether the two vascular pathologies are prognostically different. We aim to 
assess the long-term vital prognosis of patients with abdominal aortic 
aneurysmal disease (AAA) or peripheral artery disease (PAD), focusing on 
possible differences in survival, prognostic risk profiles and causes of death.
METHODS: Patients undergoing elective surgery for isolated AAA or PAD between 
2003 and 2011 were retrospectively included. Differences in postoperative 
survival were determined using Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analysis. 
Prognostic risk profiles were also established with Cox regression analysis.
RESULTS: 429 and 338 patients were included in the AAA and PAD groups, 
respectively. AAA patients were older (71.7 vs. 63.3 years, p < 0.001), yet 
overall survival following surgery did not differ (HR: 1.16, 95% CI: 0.87-1.54). 
Neither was type of vascular disease associated with postoperative 
cardiovascular nor cancer-related death. However, in comparison with age- and 
gender-matched general populations, cardiovascular mortality was higher in PAD 
than AAA patients (48.3% vs. 17.3%). Survival of AAA and PAD patients was 
negatively affected by age, history of cancer and renal insufficiency. 
Additional determinants in the PAD group were diabetes and ischemic heart 
disease.
CONCLUSIONS: Long-term survival after surgery for PAD and AAA is similar. 
However, overall life expectancy is significantly worse among PAD patients. The 
contribution of cardiovascular disease towards mortality in PAD patients 
warrants more aggressive secondary prevention to reduce cardiovascular mortality 
and improve longevity.

[Acute Kidney Injury: the nephrology plus value and competence and a good 
organization can ameliorate the prognosis].

[Article in Italian]

Fagugli RM, Guastoni CM, Battistoni S, Patera F, Quintaliani G.

Epidemiology of Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) has changed radically in the past 15 
years: we have observed an exponential increase of cases with high mortality and 
residual disability, particularly in those patients who need dialysis treatment. 
Those who survive AKI have an increased risk of requiring dialysis after 
hospital discharge over the short term as well as long term. They have an 
increased risk of deteriorating residual kidney function and cardiovascular 
events as well as a shorter life expectancy. Given the severe prognosis, 
difficulties of treatment, high level of resources needed, increased workload 
and consequently costs, several aspects of AKI have not been sufficiently 
investigated. Any national register of AKI has not been developed and its 
absence has an impact on provisional strategies. Specific training should be 
planned beginning with University, which should include practical training in 
Intensive Care Units. A definition of the organizational characteristics and 
requirements for the care of AKI is needed. Treatment of AKI is not based 
exclusively on dialysis efficiency or technology, but also on professional 
skills, volume of activity, clinical experience, model of healthcare 
organizations, continuity of processes and medical activities to guarantee such 
as a closed-staff system. Progress in knowledge and technology has only 
partially modified the outcome and prognosis of AKI patients; consequently, new 
strategies based on increased awareness, on the implementation of professional 
skills, and on revision, definition and updating of resources for the 
organization of AKI management are needed and expected over the short term.

PURPOSE: To determine the cost-effectiveness of implementing a point-of-care 
(POC) Lactate Program in the emergency department (ED) for patients with 
suspected sepsis to identify patients who can benefit from early resuscitation.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We constructed a cost-effectiveness model to examine an 
ED with 30 000 patients annually. We evaluated a POC lactate program screening 
patients with suspected sepsis for an elevated lactate ≥4 mmol/L. Those with 
elevated lactate levels are resuscitated and their lactate clearance is 
evaluated by serial POC lactate measurements. The POC Lactate Program was 
compared with a Usual Care Strategy in which all patients with sepsis and an 
elevated lactate are admitted to the intensive care unit. Costs were estimated 
from the 2014 Medicare Inpatient and National Physician Fee schedules, and 
hospital and industry estimates.
RESULTS: In the base-case, the POC Lactate Program cost $39.53/patient whereas 
the Usual Care Strategy cost $33.20/patient. The screened patients in the POC 
arm resulted in 1.07 quality-adjusted life years for an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio of $31 590 per quality-adjusted life year gained, well 
below accepted willingness-to-pay-thresholds.
CONCLUSIONS: Implementing a POC Lactate Program for screening ED patients with 
suspected sepsis is a cost-effective intervention to identify patients 
responsive to early resuscitation.

There are 4 general economic analyses used in health care: cost minimization, 
cost-benefit, cost-effectiveness, and cost utility. In this review, we provide 
an overview of each of these analyses and examine their appropriateness and 
effectiveness in assessing critical care costs. In the intensive care unit 
setting, it is particularly important to consider the patients' quality of life 
following the treatment of critical illness and to adopt a societal perspective 
when conducting economic analyses. Therefore, of the 4 economic analyses we 
cover, we recommend the use of cost-effectiveness and cost utility analyses.

Female fecundity traits in wild populations of African annual fish: the role of 
the aridity gradient.

The evolution of life history is shaped by life expectancy. Life-history traits 
coevolve, and optimal states for particular traits are constrained by trade-offs 
with other life-history traits. Life histories contrast among species, but may 
also diverge intraspecifically, at the level of populations. We studied the 
evolution of female reproductive allocation strategy, using natural populations 
of two sympatric species of African annual fishes, Nothobranchius furzeri and 
Nothobranchius orthonotus. These species inhabit pools in the Mozambican savanna 
that are formed in the rainy season and persist for only 2-10 months. Using 207 
female N. furzeri from 11 populations and 243 female N. orthonotus from 14 
populations, we tested the effects of genetic background (intraspecific lineage) 
and life expectancy (position on the aridity gradient determining maximum 
duration of their temporary habitat) on female fecundity traits. First, we found 
that variation in female body mass was small within populations, but varied 
considerably among populations. Second, we found that fecundity was largely 
defined by female body mass and that females spawned most of their eggs in the 
morning. Third, we found that the trade-off between egg size and egg number 
varied among lineages of N. furzeri and this outcome has been confirmed by data 
from two separate years. Overall, we demonstrate that local conditions were 
important determinants for Nothobranchius growth and fecundity and that eggs 
size in arid region was less limited by female fecundity than in humid region.

Yokkaichi asthma was one of the most common environmental pollution diseases in 
Japan in the 1960s and 1970s. The problem of air pollution in Yokkaichi was 
solved in the 1970s. However, mortality and life expectancy were still affected 
by the late effects of air pollution in patients with Yokkaichi asthma even in 
the 2000s. In this case report, we described the experience of successful 
treatment of a patient with severe asthmatic status due to Yokkaichi asthma. A 
40s-year-old man, who was officially certified as a patient with Yokkaichi 
asthma from his infancy, was admitted to hospital due to acute exacerbation of 
asthma. Mechanical ventilation, intravenous administration of aminophylline and 
dexamethasone, enteral administration of montelukast, and a transdermal patch of 
tulobuterol were started. However, because of the lack of improvement in 
clinical status, inhalation of procaterol using vibrating mesh nebulizer systems 
was started. Inhalation of procaterol was used three times a day. After using 
the vibrating mesh nebulizer, respiratory system compliance and hypercapnia 
rapidly improved. Bilateral expiratory wheezing was diminished. Weaning from 
mechanical ventilation was initiated, and on the eighth day of mechanical 
ventilation, the patient was extubated. Although intractable respiratory failure 
with decreased respiratory system compliance resulting from the late effects of 
air pollution and a long-time asthmatic inflammatory condition was observed, the 
use of a vibrating mesh nebulizer for the inhaled administration of procaterol 
was useful to relieve severe bronchospasm due to Yokkaichi asthma.

Replicating and extending a model of effects of universal preventive 
intervention during early adolescence on young adult substance misuse.

(1)Partnerships in Prevention Science Institute.

OBJECTIVE: This brief report summarizes a replication and extension of a 
developmental outcome modeling study, by examining whether delayed substance 
initiation during adolescence, resulting from universal middle school preventive 
interventions, reduces problematic use in young adults Ages 25 and 27, up to 
14.5 years after baseline.
METHOD: Participants were middle school students from 36 Iowa schools randomly 
assigned to the Strengthening Families Program plus Life Skills Training (SFP 
10-14 + LST), LST-only, or a control condition. Self-report questionnaires 
originally were collected at 11 time points, through Age 22. A subsequent grant 
allowed for assessments at Ages 25 and 27, including measures of drunkenness, 
alcohol-related problems, cigarette use, illicit drug use (lifetime and 
frequency), marijuana use and prescription drug misuse. These outcomes were 
modeled as variables influenced by growth factors describing substance 
initiation during adolescence. Models included the effects of baseline risk, 
intervention condition assignment, and their interaction; risk-related 
moderation effects were examined and relative reduction rates were calculated 
for dichotomous variables.
RESULTS: Model fits were good. Analyses showed significant or marginally 
significant indirect intervention effects on all outcomes, through effects on 
adolescent substance initiation growth factors. Intervention × Risk interaction 
effects favored the higher risk subsample, replicating earlier findings. 
Additional direct effects on young adult use were observed only for cigarette 
frequency. Relative reduction rates were larger for the higher risk subsamples, 
ranging from 3.9% to 36.2%.
CONCLUSIONS: Universal preventive interventions implemented during early 
adolescence have the potential to decrease the rates of substance misuse and 
associated problems into young adulthood. (PsycINFO Database Record

Viperfav(TM) is a commercial F(ab')₂ antivenom prepared against European vipers 
venom. It is safe and effective for treating envenomation caused by Vipera aspis 
and Vipera berus. Therapeutic efficacy for treating Vipera ammodytes ammodytes 
(V. a. ammodytes) envenoming has not been yet described, although protective 
efficacy has been demonstrated in preclinical studies. We report on a 
32-year-old man bitten by V. a. ammodytes who was treated with Viperfav™. 
Viperfav™ promptly reduced local extension and improved systemic pathological 
signs, but 24 h after the incident a recurrence of thrombocytopenia occurred 
despite a favorable pharmacokinetic profile with systemic clearance (1.64 
(mL·h(-1))·kg(-1)) and elimination half-life (97 h) among the highest ever 
reported. The recommended dose of Viperfav™ for V. aspis and V. berus bites may 
be inadequate for serious V. a. ammodytes envenomations. Following V. a. 
ammodytes bite, serial blood counts and coagulation profiles should be performed 
to help guide Viperfav™ treatment, along with supplemental administration as 
indicated.

BACKGROUND: Biennial screening is generally recommended for average-risk women 
aged 50 to 74 years, but tailored screening may provide greater benefits.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate outcomes for various screening intervals after age 50 
years based on breast density and risk for breast cancer.
DESIGN: Collaborative simulation modeling using national incidence, breast 
density, and screening performance data.
SETTING: United States.
PATIENTS: Women aged 50 years or older with various combinations of breast 
density and relative risk (RR) of 1.0, 1.3, 2.0, or 4.0.
INTERVENTION: Annual, biennial, or triennial digital mammography screening from 
ages 50 to 74 years (vs. no screening) and ages 65 to 74 years (vs. biennial 
digital mammography from ages 50 to 64 years).
MEASUREMENTS: Lifetime breast cancer deaths, life expectancy and 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), false-positive mammograms, benign biopsy 
results, overdiagnosis, cost-effectiveness, and ratio of false-positive results 
to breast cancer deaths averted.
RESULTS: Screening benefits and overdiagnosis increase with breast density and 
RR. False-positive mammograms and benign results on biopsy decrease with 
increasing risk. Among women with fatty breasts or scattered fibroglandular 
density and an RR of 1.0 or 1.3, breast cancer deaths averted were similar for 
triennial versus biennial screening for both age groups (50 to 74 years, median 
of 3.4 to 5.1 vs. 4.1 to 6.5 deaths averted; 65 to 74 years, median of 1.5 to 
2.1 vs. 1.8 to 2.6 deaths averted). Breast cancer deaths averted increased with 
annual versus biennial screening for women aged 50 to 74 years at all levels of 
breast density and an RR of 4.0, and those aged 65 to 74 years with 
heterogeneously or extremely dense breasts and an RR of 4.0. However, harms were 
almost 2-fold higher. Triennial screening for the average-risk subgroup and 
annual screening for the highest-risk subgroup cost less than $100 000 per QALY 
gained.
LIMITATION: Models did not consider women younger than 50 years, those with an 
RR less than 1, or other imaging methods.
CONCLUSION: Average-risk women with low breast density undergoing triennial 
screening and higher-risk women with high breast density receiving annual 
screening will maintain a similar or better balance of benefits and harms than 
average-risk women receiving biennial screening.

The FDA approved drug rapamycin increases lifespan in rodents and delays 
age-related dysfunction in rodents and humans. Nevertheless, important questions 
remain regarding the optimal dose, duration, and mechanisms of action in the 
context of healthy aging. Here we show that 3 months of rapamycin treatment is 
sufficient to increase life expectancy by up to 60% and improve measures of 
healthspan in middle-aged mice. This transient treatment is also associated with 
a remodeling of the microbiome, including dramatically increased prevalence of 
segmented filamentous bacteria in the small intestine. We also define a dose in 
female mice that does not extend lifespan, but is associated with a striking 
shift in cancer prevalence toward aggressive hematopoietic cancers and away from 
non-hematopoietic malignancies. These data suggest that a short-term rapamycin 
treatment late in life has persistent effects that can robustly delay aging, 
influence cancer prevalence, and modulate the microbiome.

Center, Shenzhen Second People's Hospital, First Affiliated Hospital of Shenzhen 
University, Shenzhen, China.

AIM: To investigate whether a nurse-led care was more beneficial for 
implementing chronic kidney disease guidelines and improved multiple risk 
factors compared with the usual care.
BACKGROUND: Several independent clinical trials have been carried out to 
demonstrate the efficiency of a nurse-led care to improve the outcomes for 
patients with chronic kidney disease and address the risk factors for renal 
function decline. However, their results and conclusions were inconsistent.
METHODS: A meta-analysis was carried out on September 2015 based on previous 
studies that evaluated the efficiency of nurse-led care model for patients with 
chronic kidney disease. Following quality appraisal, four randomised clinical 
trials that allocated patients with chronic kidney disease to usual care and 
nurse-coordinated care were included. Primary outcomes, such as kidney failure 
and cardiovascular events, were analysed.
RESULTS: Compared with the usual care group, a nurse-coordinated care model 
reduced the risks of composite death, decreased the occurrence rate of end-stage 
renal disease and doubled serum creatinine. On the contrary, a slight propulsive 
effect of nurse-led interventional care occurred on acute myocardial infarction 
and heart failure.
LIMITATIONS: Only five studies were included and conducted nonstandard 
evaluating endpoints, causing fewer studies were categorised in each outcome 
events in this meta-analysis, subsequently leading to heterogeneity and less 
persuasive.
CONCLUSIONS: Intensive interventions delivered by nurse coordinators are 
expected to benefit patients to attain longer life expectancy and higher life 
quality as well as to improve controlling risk factors implicated in chronic 
kidney disease progression.
RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: More government and hospitals should modify the 
traditional nursing routine based on this study, providing a more intensive 
nurse-coaching care model for patients with chronic kidney disease, even aged or 
other chronic diseases, which shall further help to better control the risk 
factors and delay disease progression.

BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer, a preventable disease, is the third leading cause 
of cancer morbidity and mortality in the Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao 
PDR). Since many cervical cancers are linked to human papilloma virus (HPV) 
infection, vaccination against this virus may lead to a reduction in these types 
of cancer. The study described here is the first to compare the 
cost-effectiveness of different HPV vaccination options in Lao PDR.
METHODS: A dynamic compartment model was created. The model included routine 
screening activities already in place, as well as theoretical interventions that 
included a 10-year old girl-only vaccination programme combined with/without a 
10-year old boy vaccination programme and/or a catch-up component. The 
simulation was run over 100 years. In base case analyses, we assumed 70 % 
vaccination coverage with lifelong protection and 100 % efficacy against HPV 
types 16/18. The outcomes of interest were the incremental cost per 
Disability-Adjusted Life Year (DALY) averted.
RESULTS: In base case analyses, according to the WHO definition of 
cost-effectiveness thresholds, vaccinating 10-year-old girls was very 
cost-effective. Adding a catch-up vaccination element for females aged 
11-25 years was also very cost-effective, costing 1559 international dollars 
(I$) per DALY averted. Increasing the age limit of the catch-up vaccination 
component to 75 years old showed that this remained a cost-effective option (I$ 
5840 per DALY averted). Adding a vaccination programme for 10-year-old boys was 
not found to be cost-effective unless a short time simulation (30 years or less) 
was considered, along with a catch-up vaccination component for both males and 
females.
CONCLUSIONS: Adding a catch-up female vaccination component is more attractive 
than adding a 10-year-old boy vaccination component.

Asian Indians have a high prevalence of type 2 diabetes in the U.S. (17.4-29 %). 
This study examined the relationship between dietary acculturation of Asian 
Indians in the U.S. and their future risk for type 2 diabetes. A validated Asian 
Indian Dietary Acculturation Measure (AIDAM) and the Finnish Diabetes Risk Score 
(FINDRISC) were completed by 153 Asian Indians in the U.S. via a cross-sectional 
web-survey. Correlations and relative risk ratios were used to examine the 
association between AIDAM and FINDRISC. A significantly larger proportion of 
Non-Indian Oriented participants (44.7 %) had higher FINDRISC scores (scores 
7-26) compared to the Asian Indian Oriented group (27.9 %) (p = .024), and also 
had increased relative predictive risk for type 2 diabetes (relative risk 
ratio = 1.6). A positive association between dietary acculturation and diabetes 
risk was evident in our sample, which highlights the importance of assessing 
dietary acculturation in non-native groups when investigating type 2 diabetes 
risk factors.

Purpose Recently, a large randomized trial found a survival advantage among 
patients who received elective neck dissection in conjunction with primary 
surgery for clinically node-negative oral cavity cancer compared with those 
receiving primary surgery alone. However, elective neck dissection comes with 
greater upfront cost and patient morbidity. We present a cost-effectiveness 
analysis of elective neck dissection for the initial surgical management of 
early-stage oral cavity cancer. Methods We constructed a Markov model to 
simulate primary, adjuvant, and salvage therapy; disease recurrence; and 
survival in patients with T1/T2 clinically node-negative oral cavity squamous 
cell carcinoma. Transition probabilities were derived from clinical trial data; 
costs (in 2015 US dollars) and health utilities were estimated from the 
literature. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios, expressed as dollar per 
quality-adjusted life-year (QALY), were calculated with incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios less than $100,000/QALY considered cost effective. We 
conducted one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses to examine model 
uncertainty. Results Our base-case model found that over a lifetime the addition 
of elective neck dissection to primary surgery reduced overall costs by $6,000 
and improved effectiveness by 0.42 QALYs compared with primary surgery alone. 
The decrease in overall cost despite the added neck dissection was a result of 
less use of salvage therapy. On one-way sensitivity analysis, the model was most 
sensitive to assumptions about disease recurrence, survival, and the health 
utility reduction from a neck dissection. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis 
found that treatment with elective neck dissection was cost effective 76% of the 
time at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000/QALY. Conclusion Our study 
found that the addition of elective neck dissection reduces costs and improves 
health outcomes, making this a cost-effective treatment strategy for patients 
with early-stage oral cavity cancer.

PURPOSE:  Estimating the cost-effectiveness of whole-brain radiation therapy 
(WBRT) and stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), including Gamma Knife radiosurgery 
(GKRS), requires the quantitative measurement of patients' health states after 
treatment. We sought to quantify individuals' preferences for the relevant 
health states after WBRT or GKRS for brain metastases on a 0 to 1 scale, where 1 
is perfect health and 0 is death.
METHODS:  We prospectively measured utilities in patients with brain metastases 
evaluated at Yale for consideration of WBRT and/or GKRS, as well as oncology 
nurses who had cared for patients with brain metastases before and after WBRT or 
GKRS, using the Standard Gamble (SG) technique. Demographic information was also 
collected. Nonparametric tests were used to compare potential differences in 
utility values and for subgroups based on demographic characteristics.
RESULTS:  There were 24 patients and 31 nurses who completed the study between 
December 2013 and May 2015. Median utilities ranged from 0.85 for the 
status-post (S/P) GKRS state to 0.25 (for neurologic dying). The median utility 
of being S/P WBRT was 0.70 compared to 0.85 S/P GKRS (p < 0.001). The cognitive 
decline from WBRT was associated with a notably low utility score of 0.30. There 
were no statistically significant differences between patients' and nurses' 
median utility scores.
CONCLUSIONS:  These SG utilities provide unique insights into brain 
metastases-related health states from the patient and provider perspective. As 
perceived by individuals with direct knowledge of the health states in question, 
WBRT has a significantly lower utility compared to GKRS. Cognitive decline 
following WBRT is associated with significant perceived reduction in quality of 
life. Differences in the relative importance of overall survival and quality of 
life with treatment existed between patients with different stages of disease. 
These utilities can be used to calculate quality-adjusted life expectancy in 
cost-effectiveness evaluations of SRS and WBRT.

Familial Mediterranean fever - an important disease in a globalised world 
Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is characterized by recurrent febrile attacks 
during 1/2-3 days associated with peritonitis, pleuritis and arthritis. FMF is 
the most common monogenic autoinflammatory disease in the world, with over 100 
000 affected individuals. It is particularly common in individuals with an 
origin in the eastern Mediterranean Basin, where the disease has a prevalence of 
100-200 per 100 000. The gene for FMF (MEFV) was identified in 1997 with an 
autosomal recessive inheritance; however, a significant proportion (≈25%) of 
clinical patients lack two mutations. MEFV codes for the protein pyrin, whose 
exact function still needs to be defined. The most serious complication of FMF 
is amyloid A amyloidosis, in particular renal amyloidosis. FMF is efficiently 
treated with daily doses of colchicine resulting in an almost normal life 
expectancy and amyloidosis confined to non-compliant patients. In today's 
globalized world we need to adapt to a new context that includes inherited 
conditions, which have historically been uncommon in our part of the world. One 
of these conditions is FMF, that should primarily be suspected in individuals 
with an origin in the eastern Mediterranean Basin and recurrent attacks of 
fever.

Transactional sex through so-called compensated dating in adolescent girls is a 
problem in need of public concern. Compensated dating typically involves the use 
of information communication technology to advertise, search, bargain, and 
eventually arrange for transactional sex. The technology enables the sexual 
partners to maintain privacy and secrecy in transactional sex. Such secrecy 
necessitates the girls' disclosure about their life experiences in order to 
address the concern. The disclosure is the focus of the present qualitative 
study of 27 girls practicing the dating in Hong Kong, China. Based on the 
disclosure, the study presents a grounded theory that epitomizes engagement in 
compensated dating by referential choice. Such a referential choice theory 
unravels that choice with reference to the family push and social norms sustains 
the engagement. Meanwhile, the choice rests on expectancy and reinforcement from 
experiential learning about compensated dating. The theory thus implies ways to 
undercut the engagement through diverting the referential choice of the dating.

R(+)limonene (LMN) is the major aromatic compound in essential oils obtained 
from oranges, grapefruits, and lemons. The improvement of preservation 
techniques to reduce the growth and activity of spoilage microorganisms in foods 
is crucial to increase their shelf life and to reduce the losses due to 
spoilage. The aim of this work is to evaluate the effect of LMN on the shelf 
life of fish fillets. Its effectiveness was preliminarily investigated in vitro 
against 60 strains of Specific Spoilage Organisms (SSOs) and then on gilt-head 
sea bream fillets stored at 2±0.5°C for 15days under vacuum. LMN showed a good 
inhibitory effect against tested SSOs strains. On gilt-head sea bream fillets, 
LMN inhibited the growth SSOs effectively, and its use resulted in a shelf-life 
extension of ca. 6-9days of treated fillets, compared to the control samples. 
The LMN addition in Sparus aurata fillets giving a distinctive smell and 
like-lemon taste to fish fillets that resulted pleasant to panellists. Its use 
contributed to a considerable reduction of fish spoilage given that the fillets 
treated with LMN were still sensory acceptable after 15days of storage. LMN may 
be used as an effective antimicrobial system to reduce the microbial growth and 
to improve the shelf life of fresh gilt-head sea bream fillets.

A Highly Reactive Imidazolium-Bridged Dinucleotide Intermediate in Nonenzymatic 
RNA Primer Extension.

for Computational and Integrative Biology, Massachusetts General Hospital ,

Because of its importance for the origin of life, the nonenzymatic copying of 
RNA templates has been the subject of intense study for several decades. 
Previous characterizations of template-directed primer extension using 
5'-phosphoryl-2-methylimidazole-activated nucleotides (2-MeImpNs) as substrates 
have assumed a classical in-line nucleophilic substitution mechanism, in which 
the 3'-hydroxyl of the primer attacks the phosphate of the incoming monomer, 
displacing the 2-methylimidazole leaving group. However, we have found that the 
initial rate of primer extension depends on the pH and concentration at which 
the activated monomer is maintained prior to the primer extension reaction. 
These and other results suggest an alternative mechanism, in which two monomers 
react with each other to form an imidazolium-bridged dinucleotide intermediate, 
which then binds to the template. Subsequent attack of the 3'-hydroxyl of the 
primer displaces an activated nucleotide as the leaving group and results in 
extension of the primer by one nucleotide. Analysis of monomer solutions by NMR 
indicates formation of the proposed imidazolium-bridged dinucleotide in the 
expected pH-dependent manner. We have used synthetic methods to prepare material 
that is enriched in this proposed intermediate and show that it is a highly 
reactive substrate for primer extension. The formation of an imidazolium-bridged 
dinucleotide intermediate provides a mechanistic interpretation of previously 
observed catalysis by an activated nucleotide located downstream from the site 
of primer extension.

BACKGROUND: Mitral regurgitation (MR) is a common valvular heart disorder 
requiring intervention once it becomes severe. Transcatheter mitral repair with 
the MitraClip device is a safe and effective therapy for selected patients 
denied surgery. The authors sought to evaluate the clinical outcomes and 
economic impact of this therapy compared to medical management in heart-failure 
patients with symptomatic mitral regurgitation.
METHODS AND RESULTS: The study was comprised of two phases; an observational 
study of patients with heart failure and mitral regurgitation treated with 
either medical therapy or the MitraClip, and an economic model. Results of the 
observational study were used to estimate parameters for the decision model, 
which estimated costs, and benefits in a hypothetical cohort of patients with 
heart failure and moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation treated with either 
standard medical therapy or MitraClip. The cohort of patients treated with the 
MitraClip was propensity matched to a population of heart failure patients, and 
their outcomes compared. At a mean follow-up of 22 months, all-cause mortality 
was 21% in the MitraClip cohort and 42% in the medical management cohort 
(p = .007). The decision model demonstrated that MitraClip increased life 
expectancy from 1.87-3.60 years and quality-adjusted life years (QALY) from 
1.13-2.76 years. The incremental cost was $52,500 Canadian dollars, 
corresponding to an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $32,300.00 
per QALY gained. Results were sensitive to the survival benefit.
CONCLUSION: In heart failure patients with symptomatic moderate-severe mitral 
regurgitation, therapy with the MitraClip is associated with superior survival 
and is cost-effective compared to medical therapy.

BACKGROUND: Few studies have investigated the relationship between physician and 
patient-assessed performance status (PS) in blood cancers.
METHODS: Retrospective analysis among 1418 patients with haematologic 
malignancies seen at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute between 2007 and 2014. We 
analysed physician-patient agreement of Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group PS 
using weighted κ-statistics and survival analysis.
RESULTS: Mean age was 58.6 years and average follow-up was 38 months. Agreement 
in PS was fair/moderate (weighted κ=0.41, 95% CI 0.37-0.44). Physicians assigned 
a better functional status (lower score) than patients (mean 0.60 vs 0.81), 
particularly when patients were young and the disease was aggressive. Both 
scores independently predicted survival, but physician scores were more 
accurate. Disagreements in score were associated with poorer survival when 
physicians rated PS better than patients, and were modified by age, sex and 
severity of disease.
CONCLUSIONS: Physician-patient disagreements in PS score are common and have 
prognostic significance.

Mediterranean diet and life expectancy; beyond olive oil, fruits, and 
vegetables.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The recent relevant evidence of the effects of the 
Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) and lifestyle on health (2015 and first months of 
2016).
RECENT FINDINGS: Large observational prospective epidemiological studies with 
adequate control of confounding and two large randomized trials support the 
benefits of the Mediterranean dietary pattern to increase life expectancy, 
reduce the risk of major chronic disease, and improve quality of life and 
well-being. Recently, 19 new studies from large prospective studies showed - 
with nearly perfect consistency - strong benefits of the MedDiet to reduce the 
risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, total mortality, heart failure, and 
disability. Interestingly, two large and well conducted cohorts reported 
significant cardiovascular benefits after using repeated measurements of diet 
during a long follow-up period. In addition, Prevención con Dieta Mediterránea, 
the largest randomized trial with MedDiet, recently reported benefits of this 
dietary pattern to prevent cognitive decline and breast cancer.
SUMMARY: In the era of evidence-based medicine, the MedDiet represents the gold 
standard in preventive medicine, probably because of the harmonic combination of 
many elements with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, which overwhelm 
any single nutrient or food item. The whole seems more important than the sum of 
its parts.
