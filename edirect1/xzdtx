December 2020 were selected (n = 11,633). For each report, the Portable Document 
Format form containing free-text information filled by the patient, and the 
corresponding encodings of adverse event symptoms (in Medical Dictionary for 
Regulatory Activities Preferred Terms) and seriousness were obtained. This 
encoding by experts was used as the reference to train and evaluate models, 
which contained input data processing and machine-learning natural language 
processing to learn and predict encodings. We developed and compared different 
approaches for data processing and classifiers. Performance was evaluated using 
receiver operating characteristic area under the curve (AUC), F-measure, 
sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value. We used data from 26 
Pharmacovigilance Centres for training and internal validation. External 
validation was performed using data from the remaining Pharmacovigilance Centres 
during the same period.
RESULTS: Internal validation: for adverse drug reaction identification, Term 
Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) + Light Gradient Boosted Machine 
(LGBM) achieved an AUC of 0.97 and an F-measure of 0.80. The Cross-lingual 
Language Model (XLM) [transformer] obtained an AUC of 0.97 and an F-measure of 
0.78. For seriousness assessment, FastText + LGBM achieved an AUC of 0.85 and an 
F-measure of 0.63. CamemBERT (transformer) + Light Gradient Boosted Machine 
obtained an AUC of 0.84 and an F-measure of 0.63. External validation for both 
adverse drug reaction identification and seriousness assessment tasks yielded 
consistent and robust results.
CONCLUSIONS: Our artificial intelligence models showed promising performance to 
automatically code patient adverse drug reaction reports, with very similar 
results across approaches. Our system has been deployed by national health 
authorities in France since January 2021 to facilitate pharmacovigilance of 
COVID-19 vaccines. Further studies will be needed to validate the performance of 
the tool in real-life settings.

BACKGROUND: Hepatobiliary disease currently serves as an urgent health issue in 
public due to health-modulating factors such as extension of life expectancy, 
increasingly sedentary lifestyles and over-nutrition. A definite treatment 
remains lacking owing to different stages of the disease itself and its 
intricate pathogenesis. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has been gradually 
popularized in clinic with the satisfactory efficacy and good safety. Curcumae 
Rhizoma (called E Zhu, EZ in Chinese) is a representative herb, which has been 
used to treat hepatobiliary disease for thousands of years.
PURPOSE: To systematically summarize the recent research advances on the 
pharmacological activities of EZ and its constituents, explain the underlying 
mechanisms of preventing and treating hepatobiliary diseases, and assess the 
shortcomings of existing work. Besides, ethnopharmacology, phytochemicals, and 
toxicology of EZ have been researched.
METHODS: The information about EZ was collected from various sources including 
classic books about Chinese herbal medicine, and scientific databases including 
Web of Science, PubMed, ScienceDirect, Springer, ACS, SCOPUS, CNKI, CSTJ, and 
WANFANG using keywords given below and terms like pharmacological and 
phytochemical details of this plant.
RESULTS: The chemical constituents isolated and identified from EZ, such as 
terpenoids including β-elemene, furanodiene, germacrone, etc. and curcuminoids 
including curcumin, demethoxycurcumin, bisdemethoxycurcumin, etc. prove to have 
hepatoprotective effect, anti-liver fibrotic effect, anti-fatty liver effect, 
anti-liver neoplastic effect, and cholagogic effect through TGF-β1/Smad, 
JNK1/2-ROS, NF-κB and other anti-inflammatory and antioxidant signaling 
pathways. Also, EZ is often combined with other Chinese herbs in the treatment 
of hepatobiliary diseases with good clinical efficacy and no obvious adverse 
reactions.
CONCLUSION: It provides a preclinical basis for the efficacy of EZ as an 
effective therapeutic agent for the prevention and treatment of hepatobiliary 
diseases. Even so, the further studies still needed to alleviate hepatotoxicity 
and expand clinical application.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Previous randomized trials, including the Transluminal 
Endoscopic Step-Up Approach Versus Minimally Invasive Surgical Step-Up Approach 
in Patients With Infected Pancreatic Necrosis (TENSION) trial, demonstrated that 
the endoscopic step-up approach might be preferred over the surgical step-up 
approach in patients with infected necrotizing pancreatitis based on favorable 
short-term outcomes. We compared long-term clinical outcomes of both step-up 
approaches after a period of at least 5 years.
METHODS: In this long-term follow-up study, we reevaluated all clinical data on 
83 patients (of the originally 98 included patients) from the TENSION trial who 
were still alive after the initial 6-month follow-up. The primary end point, 
similar to the TENSION trial, was a composite of death and major complications. 
Secondary end points included individual major complications, 
pancreaticocutaneous fistula, reinterventions, pancreatic insufficiency, and 
quality of life.
RESULTS: After a mean follow-up period of 7 years, the primary end point 
occurred in 27 patients (53%) in the endoscopy group and in 27 patients (57%) in 
the surgery group (risk ratio [RR], 0.93; 95% confidence interval [CI], 
0.65-1.32; P = .688). Fewer pancreaticocutaneous fistulas were identified in the 
endoscopy group (8% vs 34%; RR, 0.23; 95% CI, 0.08-0.83). After the initial 
6-month follow-up, the endoscopy group needed fewer reinterventions than the 
surgery group (7% vs 24%; RR, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.09-0.99). Pancreatic insufficiency 
and quality of life did not differ between groups.
CONCLUSIONS: At long-term follow-up, the endoscopic step-up approach was not 
superior to the surgical step-up approach in reducing death or major 
complications in patients with infected necrotizing pancreatitis. However, 
patients assigned to the endoscopic approach developed overall fewer 
pancreaticocutaneous fistulas and needed fewer reinterventions after the initial 
6-month follow-up. Netherlands Trial Register no: NL8571.

Chemokines play important roles in early embryogenesis, including morphogenesis 
and cell differentiation, before the immune system is established. We 
characterized Xenopus laevis CC-type chemokine receptor 7 S (ccr7.S) to clarify 
its role during early development. ccr7 transcripts were detected ubiquitously 
in early embryos. Dorsal overexpression of ccr7.S inhibited gastrulation, and 
ccr7.S mRNA-injected embryos had short axes and widely opened neural folds. 
Because the Keller sandwich explants of the injected embryos elongated well, 
ccr7.S might affect cell migration, but not convergent extension movements. 
Ventral ccr7.S overexpression induced secondary axes and chrd.1 upregulation in 
gastrula-stage embryos. Animal cap assays showed increased expression of neural 
and cement gland marker genes at later stages. Ccr7.S knockdown reduced chrd.1 
expression and inhibited gastrulation at the dorsal side. Our findings suggest 
that ccr7.S plays important roles in morphogenetic movement and cell 
differentiation.

To improve cancer care in Indiana, a telementoring program using the Extension 
for Community Healthcare Outcomes (ECHO) model was introduced in September 2019 
to promote best-practice cancer prevention, screening, and survivorship care by 
primary care providers (PCPs). The aim of this study was to evaluate the 
program's educational outcomes in its pilot year, using Moore's Evaluation 
Framework for Continuing Medical Education and focusing on the program's impact 
on participants' knowledge, confidence, and professional practice. We collected 
data in 22 semi-structured interviews (13 PCPs and 9 non-PCPs) and 30 anonymous 
one-time surveys (14 PCPs and 16 non-PCPs) from the program participants (hub 
and spoke site members), as well as from members of the target audience who did 
not participate. In the first year, average attendance at each session was 2.5 
PCPs and 12 non-PCP professionals. In spite of a relatively low PCP 
participation, the program received very positive satisfaction scores, and 
participants reported improvements in knowledge, confidence, and practice. Both 
program participants and target audience respondents particularly valued three 
features of the program: its conversational format, the real-life experiences 
gained, and the support received from a professional interdisciplinary 
community. PCPs reported preferring case discussions over didactics. Our results 
suggest that the Cancer ECHO program has benefits over other PCP-targetted 
cancer control interventions and could be an effective educational means of 
improving cancer control capacity among PCPs and others. Further study is 
warranted to explain the discrepancies among study participants' perceptions of 
the program's strengths and the relatively low PCP participation before 
undertaking a full-scale effectiveness study.

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is an indolent lymphoproliferative disorder 
commonly seen in the elderly. Its diagnosis is often incidental. Treatment is 
not always required, and a clinical and biological follow-up may be sufficient. 
However, progressive CLL may result in shortened life expectancy and significant 
complications. It is therefore critical to precisely stratify CLL prognosis to 
guide therapeutic choices accordingly. Therapeutic options have largely evolved 
in the past years and current molecular biomarkers allow a better risk 
stratification, leading to a significant improvement of survival. We summarize 
herein modern diagnostic and therapeutic management of CLL.

Publisher: La leucémie lymphoïde chronique (LLC) est une maladie 
lymphoproliférative indolente fréquente, affectant surtout le sujet âgé. Souvent 
diagnostiquée fortuitement, elle ne nécessite pas toujours de traitement, une 
surveillance simple pouvant suffire. Néanmoins, les formes évolutives de la 
maladie sont responsables d’une diminution de l’espérance de vie et de 
complications significatives. Il est essentiel d’évaluer précisément le risque 
évolutif pour orienter au mieux la prise en charge. Ces dernières années, la 
panoplie de thérapies disponibles s’est étoffée et la découverte de biomarqueurs 
pronostiques a permis de mieux identifier les patients à risque, améliorant 
ainsi significativement leur survie. Nous souhaitons revoir, ici, les principaux 
aspects de la prise en charge diagnostique et thérapeutique de la LLC.

Early disease detection is a prerequisite for enacting effective interventions 
for disease control. Strains of the bacterial plant pathogen Xylella fastidiosa 
have recurrently spread to new crops in new countries causing devastating 
outbreaks. So far, investigation of outbreak strains and highly resolved 
phylogenetic reconstruction have required whole-genome sequencing of pure 
bacterial cultures, which are challenging to obtain due to the fastidious nature 
of X. fastidiosa. Here, we show that culture-independent metagenomic sequencing, 
using the Oxford Nanopore Technologies MinION long-read sequencer, can 
sensitively and specifically detect the causative agent of Pierce's disease of 
grapevine, X. fastidiosa subspecies fastidiosa. Using a DNA sample from a 
grapevine in Virginia, USA, it was possible to obtain a metagenome-assembled 
genome (MAG) of sufficient quality for phylogenetic reconstruction with SNP 
resolution. The analysis placed the MAG in a clade with isolates from Georgia, 
USA, suggesting introduction of X. fastidiosa subspecies fastidiosa to Virginia 
from the south-eastern USA. This proof of concept study, thus, revealed that 
metagenomic sequencing can replace culture-dependent genome sequencing for 
reconstructing transmission routes of bacterial plant pathogens.

BACKGROUND: Complementary foods are defined as any solid or liquid foods other 
than breast milk offered to children. Timely initiation of complementary foods 
during infancy is necessary for growth and development. The first two years of 
life are important period for rapid physical, cognitive and social development 
that requires optimal nutrition. Currently, there is no study done in this rural 
community about timely initiation of complementary feeding.
OBJECTIVE: The main aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of timely 
initiation of complementary feeding among mothers having children aged 6-24 
months in Farta district, rural Ethiopia.
METHODS: A community-based cross-sectional study was employed from December 2020 
to February 2021 among 570 mothers by using multi-stage sampling techniques. 
Data were collected using a structured interviewer-administered questionnaire 
and entered into Epi Data 4.6 then transferred to Statistical Package for Social 
Science version 25 for analysis. Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression 
analysis with a 95% confidence interval carried out to determine the association 
between explanatory and the outcome variables. A P-value of < 0.05 was 
considered statistically significant.
RESULTS: The prevalence of timely initiation of complementary feeding among 
mothers having children aged 6-24 months was 51.9%. Institutionaldelivery [(AOR 
= 2.10, 95% CI: (1.31-3.32)],Keeping livestock [(AOR = 2.21, 95% CI: (1.35, 
3.65)], Postnatal follow up [(AOR = 0.60, 95% CI:(0.36, 0.77)],merchants [(AOR = 
4.58; 95% CI:1.99, 10.55)], and daily labourer [(AOR = 2.88, 95% CI:(1.50-5.51)] 
were statistically associated with timely initiation of complementary feeding.
CONCLUSION: This finding revealed that the prevalence of timely initiation of 
complementary feeding is still low. Factors affecting timely initiations of 
complementary feeding were home delivery, unable to attend postnatal care 
follow-up, being housewife and farmers. All health professionals including 
health extension workers should give special attention to advising and 
counseling for mothers and their husbands about timely initiation of 
complementary feeding.

Evidence exists that tree mortality is accelerating in some regions of the 
tropics1,2, with profound consequences for the future of the tropical carbon 
sink and the global anthropogenic carbon budget left to limit peak global 
warming below 2 °C. However, the mechanisms that may be driving such mortality 
changes and whether particular species are especially vulnerable remain 
unclear3-8. Here we analyse a 49-year record of tree dynamics from 24 old-growth 
forest plots encompassing a broad climatic gradient across the Australian moist 
tropics and find that annual tree mortality risk has, on average, doubled across 
all plots and species over the last 35 years, indicating a potential halving in 
life expectancy and carbon residence time. Associated losses in biomass were not 
offset by gains from growth and recruitment. Plots in less moist local climates 
presented higher average mortality risk, but local mean climate did not predict 
the pace of temporal increase in mortality risk. Species varied in the 
trajectories of their mortality risk, with the highest average risk found nearer 
to the upper end of the atmospheric vapour pressure deficit niches of species. A 
long-term increase in vapour pressure deficit was evident across the region, 
suggesting that thresholds involving atmospheric water stress, driven by global 
warming, may be a primary cause of increasing tree mortality in moist tropical 
forests.

Aging is the result of the accumulation of a wide variety of molecular and 
cellular damage over time. This has been associated with a number of features 
termed hallmarks of aging, including genomic instability, loss of proteostasis, 
telomere attrition, dysregulated nutrient sensing, mitochondrial dysfunction, 
cellular senescence, stem cell exhaustion, and impaired intercellular 
communication. On the other hand, sirtuins are enzymes with an important role in 
aging and life extension, of which humans have seven paralogs (SIRT1 to SIRT7). 
SIRT7 is the least studied sirtuin to date, but it has been reported to serve 
important functions, such as promoting ribosomal RNA expression, aiding in DNA 
damage repair, and regulating chromatin compaction. Several studies have 
established a close relationship between SIRT7 and age-related processes, but 
knowledge in this area is still scarce. Therefore, the purpose of this review 
was to analyze how SIRT7 is associated with each of the hallmarks of aging, as 
well as with some of age-associated diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases, 
obesity, osteoporosis, and cancer.

The 'good' of extending fertility: ontology and moral reasoning in a biotemporal 
regime of reproduction.

nolwenn.buhler@unil.ch.

Since the emergence of in-vitro fertilization (IVF), a specific set of 
technologies has been developed to address the problem of the 'biological 
clock'. The medical extension of fertility time is accompanied by promissory 
narratives to help women synchronize conflicting biological and social 
temporalities. This possibility also has a transgressive potential by blurring 
one of the biological landmarks - the menopause - by which reproductive lives 
are organized and governed. These new ways of managing, measuring and 
controlling reproductive time have renewed debates on the age limits of 
motherhood and the moral legitimacy of medical intervention into age-related 
fertility decline. Building on Amir's feminist concept of biotemporality, this 
paper questions what happens when the ontological foundations of age-limited 
motherhood are disrupted by technologies which allow fertility to be extended. 
It discusses the reconfigurations of the ontological boundaries of the facts of 
life in the light of literature on reproductive technologies and temporality. 
Through the Swiss experience, the paper shows how medical experts are drawn into 
negotiating the ontological boundaries of age-limited motherhood along the 
binaries of the normal/pathological and the biological/social. Questioning the 
purpose of medical interventions in what are seen as facts of life, they produce 
different configurations of moral reasoning where what is natural undergoes 
shifts which both reinforce the normative order and subvert it.

BACKGROUND: We assessed the role of missing and murdered indigenous relatives 
(MMIR) relevant causes of death in the life expectancy gap between the American 
Indian and Alaska Native (AIAN) and non-Hispanic White populations.
METHODS: Using 2010-2019 National Center for Health Statistics Detailed 
Mortality files, we created multidecrement life tables and used the 
age-incidence decomposition method to identify (1) the causes of death that 
contribute to the gap in life expectancy between White and AIAN, and (2) the 
mechanisms through which these causes operate.
RESULTS: Causes of death relevant to MMIR constituted 4.0% of all AIAN deaths, 
but accounted for almost one-tenth (9.6%; 0.74 of 8.21 years) of the overall 
AIAN-White life expectancy gap. MMIR-relevant causes accounted for 6.6% of the 
AIAN-White life expectancy gap for women and 11.9% of the for men.
CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests a critical agenda for research on racial 
inequities in mortality, with a focus on MMIR.

OBJECTIVES: As life expectancy is prolonged, older people may face increased 
burdens related to supporting multi-generational family members. This study is 
aimed toward examining the effects of such an emerging type of informal care on 
the well-being of caregivers.
METHODS: Participants aged 50 and over from the Taiwan Longitudinal Study on 
Aging (1996-2007, n = 4,217) were analyzed. We categorized caregiving status 
according to different care recipients: 1) older adults only, 2) grandchildren 
only, 3) both older adults and grandchildren (dual caregiving), and 4) 
non-caregivers. Well-being was measured based on depressive symptoms and degree 
of life satisfaction. Generalized Estimation Equation models were used to 
examine the association between types of caregiving and the caregivers' state of 
well-being.
RESULTS: After adjusting for all covariates, caregivers of older adults had 
significantly more depressive symptoms and less life satisfaction than 
non-caregivers, especially when caregiving for adults with ADL problems. In 
contrast, caregivers of grandchildren were not significantly affect either 
depression or life satisfaction as compared with non-caregivers. Interestingly, 
caregiving for both older adults and grandchildren had no significant effect on 
depression but positively affected the degree of life satisfaction.
CONCLUSION: Our findings highlight that simultaneously taking care of both older 
adults and grandchildren can buffer negative feelings in caregivers or even 
improve their mental health.

The world's population is ageing at an accelerated pace. Ageing is a natural, 
physiological but highly complex and multifactorial process that all species in 
the Tree of Life experience over time. Physical and mental disabilities, and 
age-related diseases, would increase along with the increasing life expectancy. 
Ginger (Zingiber officinale) is a plant that belongs to the Zingiberaceae 
family, native to Southeast Asia. For hundreds of years, ginger has been 
consumed in various ways by the natives of Asian countries, both as culinary and 
medicinal herb for the treatment of many diseases. Mounting evidence suggests 
that ginger can promote healthy ageing, reduce morbidity, and prolong healthy 
lifespan. Ginger, a well-known natural product, has been demonstrated to possess 
antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, and antimicrobial properties, as 
well as an outstanding antiviral activity due to a high concentration of 
antiviral compounds. In this review, the current evidence on the potential role 
of ginger and its active compounds in the prevention of ageing is discussed.

situation and trends.

Social differences in mortality and life expectancy are a clear demonstration of 
the social and health-related inequalities that exist within a particular 
population. According to data from the Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) for the 
period ranging from 1992 to 2016, 13% of women and 27% of men in the lowest 
income group died before the age of 65; the same can be said for just 8% of 
women and 14% of men in the highest income group. The difference between mean 
life expectancy at birth among the lowest and highest income groups is 4.4 years 
for women and 8.6 years for men. Substantial differences also exist between 
income groups regarding further life expectancy at the age of 65: women in the 
lowest income group have a 3.7-year shorter life expectancy than women in the 
highest income group. Similarly, men in the lowest income group have a 6.6-year 
shorter life expectancy than men in the highest income group. Finally, results 
from the trend analyses suggest that social differences in life expectancy have 
remained relatively stable over the last 25 years.

30 years after the fall of the Berlin Wall: Regional health differences in 
Germany.

Monitoring.

Following the fall of the Berlin Wall in November 1989, considerable effort was 
made to bring the living conditions and levels of social participation in the 
former East German federal states into line with the former West German federal 
states. As a result, differences in health between the East and the West 
diminished significantly, in many cases as early as the 1990s, examples being 
life expectancy and cardiovascular mortality. In regard to health behaviour, the 
overall tendency has also clearly been one of convergence. Thus, only very small 
differences can be observed today, for example in the use of tobacco or in the 
prevalence of obesity. Yet the results also highlight the insufficiency of 
regarding the remaining differences as a simple comparison between East and 
West. Instead, the focus should shift towards smaller-scale approaches that take 
regional differences in living conditions into account.

BACKGROUND: Due to extended life expectancy and recent improvements in surgical 
techniques, limb salvage has replaced amputation as the gold standard and is now 
performed in 90-95% of upper extremity malignancies. However, many of these 
salvage procedures are associated with significant postsurgical complications. 
In particular, the clavicula pro humero (CPH) procedure is associated with high 
rates of nonunion. We present our experience with upper extremity salvage using 
the free vascularized fibular flap (VFF) after failure or nonunion of the 
original CPH procedure in the pediatric population.
METHODS: Five patients under the age of 18 diagnosed with upper extremity 
sarcoma who underwent tumor resection with immediate CPH reconstruction 
complicated with nonunion, and subsequent revision with free VFF were included. 
Data on patient demographics, oncologic characteristics, surgical procedures, 
intraoperative details, postoperative complications, and time to graft union 
were recorded.
RESULTS: Five patients (average age = 8.4 years; range = 5-10 years at surgery 
date) underwent secondary limb salvage procedure with free VFF reconstruction 
following failed CPH reconstruction for proximal humeral osteosarcoma (n = 4) or 
Ewing sarcoma (n = 1). The mean follow-up was 3.7 years. Complications occurred 
in five patients (100%), with three patients requiring reoperation (60%). Four 
patients achieved graft union (average union time = 3.7 months) and successful 
limb reconstruction. Four patients were alive with no local recurrence of the 
disease. One patient did not achieve union and was lost to follow-up.
CONCLUSION: Primary bone tumors in the pediatric population require wide 
surgical resection, and reconstruction often has high complication rates that 
can warrant further procedures. A free VFF is a viable option for upper 
extremity salvage after previously failed reconstructions because it provides 
vascularized tissue to a scarred tissue bed and allows for the replacement or 
augmentation of large bony defects.

As food intake patterns become less structured, different methods of dietary 
assessment may be required to capture frequently omitted snacks, smaller meals, 
and the time of day when they are consumed. Incorporating sensors that passively 
and objectively detect eating behavior may assist in capturing these eating 
occasions into dietary assessment methods. The aim of this study was to identify 
and collate sensor-based technologies that are feasible for dietitians to use to 
assist with performing dietary assessments in real-world practice settings. A 
scoping review was conducted using the PRISMA extension for scoping reviews 
(PRISMA-ScR) framework. Studies were included if they were published between 
January 2016 and December 2021 and evaluated the performance of sensor-based 
devices for identifying and recording the time of food intake. Devices from 
included studies were further evaluated against a set of feasibility criteria to 
determine whether they could potentially be used to assist dietitians in 
conducting dietary assessments. The feasibility criteria were, in brief, 
consisting of an accuracy ≥80%; tested in settings where subjects were free to 
choose their own foods and activities; social acceptability and comfort; a long 
battery life; and a relatively rapid detection of an eating episode. Fifty-four 
studies describing 53 unique devices and 4 device combinations worn on the wrist 
(n = 18), head (n = 16), neck (n = 9), and other locations (n = 14) were 
included. Whilst none of the devices strictly met all feasibility criteria 
currently, continuous refinement and testing of device software and hardware are 
likely given the rapidly changing nature of this emerging field. The main 
reasons devices failed to meet the feasibility criteria were: an insufficient or 
lack of reporting on battery life (91%), the use of a limited number of foods 
and behaviors to evaluate device performance (63%), and the device being 
socially unacceptable or uncomfortable to wear for long durations (46%). Until 
sensor-based dietary assessment tools have been designed into more inconspicuous 
prototypes and are able to detect most food and beverage consumption throughout 
the day, their use will not be feasible for dietitians in practice settings.

Gout is a prevalent chronic inflammatory disease that affects the life of tens 
of millions of people worldwide, and it typically presents as gout arthritis, 
gout stone, or even kidney damage. Research has revealed its connection with the 
gut microbiome, although exact mechanism is still unclear. Studies have shown 
the decline of microbiome diversity in gout patients and change of microbiome 
compositions between the gout patients and healthy controls. Nevertheless, how 
diversity changes across host individuals at a cohort (population) level has not 
been investigated to the best of our knowledge. Here we apply the diversity-area 
relationship (DAR), which is an extension to the classic SAR (species-area 
relationship) and establishes the power-function model between microbiome 
diversity and the number of individuals within cohort, to comparatively 
investigate diversity scaling (changes) of gut microbiome in gout patients and 
healthy controls. The DAR modeling with a study involving 83 subjects (41 gout 
patients) revealed that the potential number of microbial species in gout 
patients is only 70% of that in the healthy control (2790 vs 3900) although the 
difference may not be statistically significant. The other DAR parameters 
including diversity scaling and similarity parameters did not show statistically 
significant differences. We postulate that the high resilience of gut microbiome
