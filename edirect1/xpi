Methods of meta-analysis, decision analysis, and cost-effectiveness analysis 
were applied to the adrenal incidentaloma dilemma. It was shown that the life 
expectancy of patients with adrenal incidentalomas is decreased by a mean of 
about 1 year if left undiagnosed and untreated--more in cases of larger 
incidentalomas. Overall, selective analysis of adrenomedullary hormonal function 
(by urinary metanephrines) is the most cost-effective strategy. Other 
strategies, such as more extensive hormonal testing, imaging, and fine needle 
aspiration cytology may provide better cost-effectiveness in subgroups of 
patients, identified by signs, symptoms, and incidentaloma morphology. Full 
adrenal hormonal analysis is indicated in patients with larger (> or = 6 cm) 
incidentalomas and if the combination of hypertension and hypokalemia suggests 
Conn's disease. Small or medium-sized adrenal incidentalomas may be ignored if 
MR imaging or other tests suggest benign pheochromocytoma disorder, or patients 
are elderly, or both.

BACKGROUND: With the increase in life expectancy, prevalence of impairments and 
disabilities are expected to increase in India. However, there have been very 
few studies to estimate the magnitude of the problem in rural India. This is 
essential, if appropriate rehabilitation services are to be planned in the 
country.
METHODS: The study was done in the rural field practice area of the All India 
Institute of Medical Sciences at Ballabgarh, Haryana. The survey was conducted 
by successive batches of interns posted at Ballabgarh as a part of their 
compulsory rotating internship programme. The diagnostic criteria were based on 
history and simple clinical examination done at the domiciliary level.
RESULTS: A total population of 25,509 in twelve villages were screened. The 
total impairment rate was 5.4% with no significant men/women difference. The 
prevalence of physical impairment was 4.7 per 1000 population. The prevalence of 
corneal opacity in children below 15 years of age was 4.7 per 1000. Prevalence 
of cataract was almost 35% in the population over 60 years of age and 15% in the 
population between 45 to 60 years. Auditory impairment was 19.6 per 1000 as 
ascertained by history. Three-fourths of this was conductive deafness and was 
found mainly in people above 60 years of age.
CONCLUSION: Utilizing the rural field practice areas of medical colleges for 
collection of data on issues of national health importance would not only 
strengthen the health system in the country but also improve medical education. 
There is a need for a comprehensive preventive, promotive, curative and 
rehabilitative approach to disabilities in India.

BACKGROUND: The presence of pericardial calcification on a plain radiograph 
strongly suggests constrictive pericarditis in patients with heart failure. 
However, calcific constrictive pericarditis is considered rare in the United 
States since tuberculosis incidence has decreased, and doubt has therefore been 
raised about the importance of this radiologic finding in modern cardiovascular 
practice.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the clinical and prognostic significance of pericardial 
calcification on radiography in patients with constrictive pericarditis.
DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.
SETTING: Tertiary referral center.
PATIENTS: A consecutive series of 135 patients (mean age +/- SD, 56 +/- 16 
years) who from 1985 through 1995 had constrictive pericarditis confirmed 
surgically (n = 133) or by autopsy (n = 2). Patients were divided into two 
groups: those with pericardial calcification on chest radiography (group I) and 
those without (group II).
MEASUREMENTS: Clinical and diagnostic findings were compared in both groups, and 
outcome was compared in 132 patients who had pericardiectomy.
RESULTS: Pericardial calcification was seen in 36 patients (27%). The cause of 
constrictive pericardial disease was indeterminate in 67% of patients in group I 
and in 21% of patients in group II (P < 0.001). Patients in group I had had 
symptoms for a longer period and were more likely to have pericardial knock, 
larger atrial size, and atrial arrhythmia. Significantly more perioperative 
deaths were seen in group I, but incidence of late survival and incidence of 
noncalcific disease were similar in both groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Pericardial calcification is a common finding in patients with 
constrictive pericarditis. It is often associated with idiopathic disease and 
other markers of disease chronicity and is an independent predictor of increased 
perioperative mortality rates.

Primary liver resection and salvage transplantation or primary liver 
transplantation in patients with single, small hepatocellular carcinoma and 
preserved liver function: an outcome-oriented decision analysis.

Two treatments are accepted for patients with solitary hepatocellular carcinoma 
</=5 cm in size and with preserved hepatic function: (1) liver resection, which 
can be performed without delay but has a high recurrence rate, and (2) liver 
transplantation, which has a better long-term survival, but is not easily 
available because grafts are scarce. A third possibility is to offer liver 
resection first and liver transplantation for tumor recurrence or deteriorating 
liver function ("salvage" transplantation). We investigated the implications of 
such a strategy with a Markov-based decision analytic model. In a scenario 
assuming intermediate values for 4 main variables (12-month waiting list; tumor 
progression outside transplantation criteria: 4% per month; recurrence after 
resection: 20% per year; recurrences eligible for transplantation: 60%), the 
life expectancy was 8.8 years for primary transplantation versus 7.8 years for 
primary resection and salvage transplantation, with a calculated use of grafts 
at 5 years of 52% for primary transplantation versus 23% for salvage 
transplantation. This study estimates of the survival and graft-saving of a 
strategy of primary resection and salvage transplantation according to variables 
that are to some extent predictable. This strategy may be a rational way to cope 
with lengthening waiting lists, especially for patients with tumors close to the 
limit for transplantation criteria, if the results of liver resection are good, 
if patients with the lowest risks of recurrence can be selected, and if a strict 
follow-up can detect recurrences when the patients are still transplantable.

OBJECTIVE: Lung transplantation is a viable option for patients with cystic 
fibrosis. The current strategy of selection, based on spirometry and 
deterioration of quality of life, results in a high mortality on the waiting 
list. We reviewed the case histories of patients with cystic fibrosis accepted 
for lung transplantation to ascertain whether pulmonary hemodynamics could 
contribute to predict life expectancy.
METHODS: Forty-five patients with cystic fibrosis were accepted: 11 died on the 
waiting list (group I), 24 underwent transplantation (group II), and 10 are 
still waiting (group III). During evaluation we recorded spirometry, oxygen 
requirement, ratio of arterial oxygen tension to inspired oxygen fraction (PaO 
(2)/FIO (2)), arterial carbon dioxide tension (PaCO (2)), 6-minute walk test 
results, right ventricular ejection fraction, echocardiography, and pulmonary 
hemodynamics. We compared data from group I, II, and III patients. A comparison 
was also made within group II between the data collected at the time of 
evaluation and at the time of transplantation to quantify the deterioration 
during the waiting time.
RESULTS: The waiting time, spirometry, 6-minute walk test results, and right 
ventricular ejection fraction did not differ among the three groups. A 
statistically significant difference was found for PaO (2)/FIO (2), PaCO (2), 
mean pulmonary artery pressure, cardiac index, pulmonary arterial wedge 
pressure, and intrapulmonary shunt between groups I and II. Groups I and III 
showed statistically significant differences for mean pulmonary artery pressure, 
PaO (2)/FIO (2), and systemic vascular resistance indexed. No differences were 
observed between groups II and III. The comparison within group II showed a 
significant deterioration of pulmonary hemodynamics during the waiting time.
CONCLUSIONS: Pulmonary hemodynamics are worst in patients dying on the waiting 
list and deteriorate significantly during the waiting time. They may thus 
contribute to establish priority for lung transplantation in patients with 
cystic fibrosis.

PURPOSE: To determine the potential economic implications resulting from oral 
temozolomide (TEM) compared with intravenous (IV) dacarbazine (DTIC) for 
metastatic melanoma.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a cost-effectiveness (CE) analysis using 
hazard ratios (HRs) from the phase III (Schering I95-018) trial comparing TEM 
200 mg/m(2)/d orally for 5 days every 28 days with DTIC 250 mg/m(2)/d IV for 5 
days every 21 days. Sensitivity analyses assessed a range of TEM's efficacy and 
costs, direct nonmedical costs, and the DTIC schedule.
RESULTS: The trial found an overall survival trend favoring TEM; median survival 
times of patients treated with DTIC and TEM were 6.4 and 7.7 months, 
respectively (HR = 1.18; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.92 to 1.52; intention 
to treat, P =.20). The mean increase in survival of TEM over DTIC was 1.1 
months. The projected average costs per patient were greater with TEM than DTIC 
($6,902 v $3,697, respectively). The incremental CE ratio using TEM was $36,990 
per life-year or $101 per day of life gained. The CE ratio's 95% CI ranged from 
-$65,180 (DTIC is more effective) to $18, 670 per year of life gained. The CE 
ratios decreased 50% if direct nonmedical costs were included and increased 50% 
if DTIC's efficacy was unchanged if given as a single daily dosage. Sixty 
percent of simulations found TEM with a CE threshold of less than $50,000 per 
life-year gained.
CONCLUSION: Although the base-case efficacy of TEM compared with DTIC was not 
statistically significant, its associated incremental CE would be comparable 
with many interventions. TEM for metastatic melanoma illustrates the tension 
confronting providers choosing between similar agents that markedly differ in 
convenience and costs.

Making capitated Medicare work for women: policy and research challenges.

Bierman AS(1), Clancy CM.

Author information:

Research and Quality, Rockville, Maryland, USA.

Growth in capitated Medicare has special ramifications for older women who 
comprise the majority of Medicare beneficiaries. Older women are more likely 
than men to have chronic conditions that lead to illness and disability, and 
they often have fewer financial and social resources to cope with these 
problems. Gender differences in health status have a number of important 
implications for the financing and delivery of care for older women under both 
traditional fee-for-service Medicare and capitation. The utilization of 
effective preventive interventions, new therapeutic interventions for the 
management of common chronic disorders, and more cost-effective models of 
chronic disease management could potentially extend the active life expectancy 
of older women. However, there are financial and delivery system barriers to 
achieving these objectives. Traditional FFS Medicare has gaps in coverage of 
care for chronic illness and disability that disproportionately impact women. 
Managed care potentially offers flexibility to allocate resources creatively, to 
develop new models of care, and offer enhanced benefits with lower out-of-pocket 
costs. However, challenges to realizing this potential under Medicare managed 
care with unique implications for older women include: possible gender bias in 
capitation payments, risk selection, inadequacy of risk adjustment models, 
benefit and market instability, and disenrollment patterns.

Benign thyroid nodules is a significant clinical problem since it involves more 
than 90% of all thyroid surgery. This has led the authors to perform a 
retrospective study of 190 patients suffering from this pathology out of 299 
patients who underwent surgery from 1979 to 1995. 89 total thyroidectomies and 
101 radical hemithyroidectomies were performed in patients suffering from benign 
thyroid nodules. Two cases of recurrent monolateral paralysis were found as well 
as 3 cases of permanent hypoparathyroidism in those patients who underwent total 
thyroidectomies. The results of numerous authors as well as the present case 
review indicate that more radical surgery does not significantly affect the 
degree of permanent complications. For this reason the authors are convinced 
that such radical surgery should be the treatment of choice, particularly in 
young patients whose life expectancy is long and where the likelihood of 
recurrence is greater.

Vessel wall alterations in patients with renal failure.

Cardiovascular complications are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in 
patients with renal failure. Death due to myocardial infarction and to stroke is 
more frequent in hemodialysis patients than in the total population. These 
cardiovascular diseases are mainly the consequence of atherosclerosis and cause 
decreased life expectancy in patients with renal failure. Ultrasound techniques 
now make it possible to measure atherosclerotic lesions in big and medium-sized 
arteries. Thickening of the intima-media-complex is an early sign of 
atherosclerosis in these vessels. It reduces the distensibility of the arteries 
during systole. The distensibility of big and medium-sized arteries can be 
determined using ultrasound-doppler-techniques. In our studies, the 
intima-media-thickness of the carotid artery was significantly (p< 0.01) 
increased in patients with chronic renal failure (1.32+/-0.49 mm, n=28) as 
compared with aged-matched healthy control subjects (0.75 +/- 0.20, n= 29). The 
distensibility coefficient was higher (p< 0.05) in healthy controls (26 +/- 1.8 
10(-3)/kPa, n= 12) than in patients with renal insufficiency (19 +/- 1.7 
10(-3)/kPa, n = 12). This demonstrates increased stiffness of the vessel wall 
resulting in loss of Windkessel function and increased work load of the heart.

BACKGROUND: Although opioid analgesics have well-defined efficacy and safety in 
treatment of chronic cancer pain, further research is needed to define their 
role in treatment of chronic noncancer pain.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of controlled-release oxycodone (OxyContin 
tablets) treatment on pain and function and its safety vs placebo and in 
long-term use in patients with moderate to severe osteoarthritis pain.
METHODS: One hundred thirty-three patients experiencing persistent 
osteoarthritis-related pain for at least 1 month were randomized to double-blind 
treatment with placebo (n = 45) or 10 mg (n = 44) or 20 mg (n = 44) of 
controlled-release oxycodone every 12 hours for 14 days. One hundred six 
patients enrolled in an open-label, 6-month extension trial; treatment for an 
additional 12 months was optional.
RESULTS: Use of controlled-release oxycodone, 20 mg, was superior (P<.05) to 
placebo in reducing pain intensity and the interference of pain with mood, 
sleep, and enjoyment of life. During long-term treatment, the mean dose remained 
stable at approximately 40 mg/d after titration, and pain intensity was stable. 
Fifty-eight patients completed 6 months of treatment, 41 completed 12 months, 
and 15 completed 18 months. Common opioid side effects were reported, several of 
which decreased in duration as therapy continued.
CONCLUSIONS: Around-the-clock controlled-release oxycodone therapy seemed to be 
effective and safe for patients with chronic, moderate to severe, 
osteo-arthritis-related pain. Effective analgesia was accompanied by a reduction 
in the interference of pain with mood, sleep, and enjoyment of life. Analgesia 
was maintained during long-term treatment, and the daily dose remained stable 
after titration. Typical opioid side effects were reported during short- and 
long-term therapy.

Rare benign tumors: laryngeal and hypopharyngeal lipomata.

Author information:
(1)Department of Otorhinolaryngology, University of Cologne, Germany.

Lipomata of the larynx and the hypopharynx are very rare benign lesions; as they 
look macroscopically like retention cysts, their diagnosis is usually made after 
surgery. Sometimes, lipomata of the hypopharynx become very large and 
life-threatening. Plain fluoroscopy and fluoroscopy aided with barium often fail 
to depict the lesion if it is localized subepiglottically; standard barium 
swallow examination and computed tomography allow an accurate diagnosis to be 
made in many cases, although magnetic resonance imaging is still more accurate 
and allows not only a more specific diagnosis of the lesion, but also a better 
depiction of the origin of the frequently pedunculated tumor and its extension 
into the parapharyngeal space. This paper adds 6 cases of hypopharyngeal and 1 
case of laryngeal lipoma to the literature and discusses modern diagnostic and 
therapeutic strategies.

Israel. rund@cc.huji.ac.il

Thalassemia is the world's most common hereditary disease, and is a paradigm of 
monogenic genetic diseases. Because of increased population mobility, the 
disease is found today throughout the world, even in places far from the 
tropical areas in which it arose. Therapy of thalassemia has in the past been 
confined to transfusion and chelation. Recently, novel modes of therapy have 
been developed for thalassemia, based on the pathophysiology and molecular 
pathology of the disease, both of which have been extensively studied. This 
review will discuss the therapeutic modalities currently in use for the 
supportive treatment of thalassemia, both those that are standard therapy and 
those that are in clinical trials. We will include transfusion, chelation 
(intravenous and oral), antioxidants and various inducers of fetal hemoglobin 
(hydroxyurea, erythropoietin, butyrates, hemin). Most of the newer therapies are 
suitable primarily for thalassemia intermedia patients. In addition, the 
treatment modalities currently in use for the curative treatment of thalassemia 
major will be discussed, including bone marrow transplantation in its various 
forms. Experimental therapeutic methods, such as intrauterine bone marrow 
transplantation and gene therapy, are included. Physicians caring for 
thalassemia patients have an increasing variety of treatment options available. 
Future clinical studies will determine the place of newer agents and modalities 
in improving the quality of life as well as the life expectancy of thalassemia 
patients.

Human tumor growth is inhibited by a vaccinia virus carrying the E2 gene of 
bovine papillomavirus.

BACKGROUND: Papillomavirus is the etiologic agent associated with cervical 
carcinoma. The papilloma E2 protein is able to regulate negatively the 
expression of E6 and E7 papilloma oncoproteins. Therefore, a new, highly 
attenuated vaccinia virus known as modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA), which 
carries the papillomavirus E2 gene, was used for the treatment of tumors 
associated with human papillomavirus.
METHODS: Analysis of expression of the E2 gene from the recombinant vaccinia 
virus was performed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction of RNA 
isolated from infected cells. Detection of the E2 protein was done by 
immunoprecipitation from proteins labeled with [(35)S]-methionine, isolated from 
infected cells. The therapeutic effect of the MVA E2 recombinant virus over 
human tumors was tested in nude mice bearing tumors generated by inoculation of 
HeLa cells. Series of 10 nude mice with tumors of different sizes were injected 
with MVA, MVA E2, or phosphate-buffered saline. Tumor size was monitored every 
week to assess growth.
RESULTS: The MVA E2 recombinant virus efficiently expressed the E2 protein in 
BS-C-1 cells. This protein was able to repress, in vivo, the papillomavirus P105 
promoter, which controls the expression of the E6 and E7 oncoproteins. In nude 
mice the MVA E2 virus reduced tumor growth very efficiently. In contrast, tumors 
continued to grow in mice treated with MVA or PBS. The life expectancy of MVA 
E2-treated mice was also increased three- to fourfold compared with that of 
animals that received MVA or PBS.
CONCLUSIONS: The growth of human tumors was efficiently inhibited by the MVA E2 
recombinant vaccinia virus. The absence of side effects in treated animals 
suggested that the MVA E2 virus is a safe biologic agent that could in the 
future be used in humans for the treatment of cervical carcinoma.

In Morquio's disease and in hereditary spondylo-epiphyseal dysplasia of longer 
duration, malalignment, instability and unfavourable anatomy are generally the 
main surgical problems, but as these patients nowadays do not have a reduced 
life expectancy, it is worthwhile giving them a functional replacement for their 
severely deformed and painful knees. We report three patients with inherited 
dwarfism, in whom a replacement of the knee was performed.

The incidence of cancer will continue to increase more rapidly than the 
population in both industrialized and developing countries. The number of older 
patients will rise. Cancer will be a major health challenge in the future. 
Patients will become more and more involved in decisions relating to their care 
and their quality of life, behaving in a more adult way than hitherto. Specific 
treatments will continue to develop, leading to more cures and to longer 
survival for patients who are not cured. The fight against cancer could be 
organized in such a way as to make it possible to provide global care of

increasingly take the form of continuous care covering every step in the fight 
against cancer, starting with prevention and screening.

AIMS: The aim of the present analysis was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of 
intense insulin treatment after acute myocardial infarction in patients with 
diabetes mellitus based on the results of the Diabetes Mellitus Insulin Glucose 
Infusion in Acute Myocardial Infarction (DIGAMI) study. In this study 620 
patients with diabetes mellitus and acute myocardial infarction were randomized 
to intense insulin treatment (insulin group) or to serve as controls given 
standard antidiabetic therapy. Mortality was significantly reduced in the 
insulin group.
METHODS AND RESULTS: The cost-effectiveness ratio was estimated as the 
incremental cost per life-year and quality-adjusted life-year gained of intense 
insulin treatment. The incremental costs were estimated as the difference in 
health care costs and indirect costs (labour production) during the first year 
of follow-up plus the future costs of increased survival. The life-years gained 
were based on the 5-year long-term follow-up experience and an assumed annual 
20% mortality risk for all patients thereafter. The health care costs were Euro 
975 higher in the insulin group during the first year of follow-up, mainly due 
to a longer period of initial hospitalization related to the institution of 
multidose insulin. The estimated discounted gain in life-years of the insulin 
treatment was 0.94 years without and 0.66 with quality of life adjustment, 
respectively. The cost per life-year gained by intense insulin treatment was 
Euro 16 900 and the cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained was Euro 24 100. 
Thus the estimated cost-effectiveness ratios were relatively low.
CONCLUSION: The results of the DIGAMI study indicate that intense insulin 
treatment after an acute myocardial infarction in patients with diabetes 
mellitus has an acceptable level of cost-effectiveness.

The effectiveness of therapy for a chronic disease can be assessed by evaluating 
the length of time that a patient survives after receiving treatment. We used a 
novel means for measuring the effectiveness of renal replacement therapy for 
patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD): the ratio of observed life span 
divided by expected life span. This ratio incorporated observed life span for 
patients from the time of ESRD and expected life span based on state-specific 
life-table analyses. A total of 3,782 individuals with ESRD were analyzed 
(average follow-up, 14.2 +/- 4.9 years); 3, 192 patients in that group received 
a kidney transplant at some point during their course of ESRD. For each patient, 
we determined a curve of observed/expected life span. Separate patient groups 
were analyzed to determine the median population observed/expected life span or 
the percentage of patients who reached 0.5 observed/expected life span. Younger 
transplant recipients (<21 years) had a median observed/expected life span of 
67%, significantly greater than the median observed/expected life span for those 
aged 21 to 40 years (49%; P = 0.01) and 41 to 60 years (47%; P = 0.01). 
Surprisingly, 57% of the patients aged older than 60 years reached their median 
observed/expected life span (P = 0.02 versus <21 years; P = not significant 
against all others). A Cox proportional hazards model identified era of 
immunosuppression (hazards ratio, 0.32) and atherosclerotic vascular 
disease-related ESRD (hazards ratio, 2.07) as significant variables influencing 
patient survival and observed/expected life span. This simple ratio is easy to 
use and may be a helpful tool for assessing the survival benefits of risk-factor 
modifications and therapeutic advances in transplantation and ESRD care.

and secondary pulmonary hypertension.

BACKGROUND: Plasma von Willebrand factor antigen (vWF:Ag) has been used as a 
marker of endothelial perturbation in a number of vascular disorders. In this 
study, vWF:Ag was determined as an attempt to evaluate the severity of 
endothelial cell dysfunction in primary pulmonary hypertension (PPH) and 
congenital heart disease-associated pulmonary hypertension (CHD-PH) 
comparatively and to determine its impact on short-term survival.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Clinical, hemodynamic, and biochemical data were obtained 
from 11 patients with PPH and 24 with CHD-PH. Patient groups were similar in 
terms of age and pulmonary artery pressure. vWF:Ag was measured by 
electroimmunodiffusion. Patients were followed up for 1 year and at that time, 
data collected at the beginning of the study were subjected to univariate and 
multivariate analyses. vWF:Ag was increased in patients (normal reference value 
87% +/- 23% activity, mean +/- SD), with higher levels in the PPH group (231% 
+/- 89%) in comparison with the CHD-PH group (127% +/- 68%) (P <.001). 
Multivariate analysis showed that survival was influenced by the underlying 
cause of pulmonary hypertension and vWF:Ag levels but not by patient age, sex, 
or pulmonary artery pressure. Seven of 10 nonsurvivors but only 4 of 25 
survivors had PPH (P =.007). vWF:Ag was 255% +/- 90% in the nonsurvivor group 
and 121% +/- 54% in the survivors (P <.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that short-term survival is related to the 
severity of endothelial cell dysfunction in pulmonary hypertension. In addition, 
exceedingly high vWF:Ag levels in PPH might reflect a particular pattern of 
endothelial cell dysfunction that could be associated with decreased short-term 
life expectancy in this disorder compared with secondary forms of pulmonary 
hypertension.

[Organ shortage in transplant centers--approaches to a solution from the 
economic viewpoint].

[Article in German]

Volkswirtschaftslehre.

In the article the regulations of the German transplantation law, which came 
into force on 1 December 1997, are considered from an economic perspective. 
First, the essential regulations of the law are described and then analyzed with 
respect to economic aspects. The law regulates in particular the administration 
of the demand surplus for organs. This could be reduced by rationing the demand 
or by increasing the supply. Apart from the medical features economic attributes 
such as cost effectiveness are also applicable as criteria for rationing. In 
addition, the method of the quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) is introduced 
and described on the basis of the results of a study about costs and benefits of 
liver transplantation. To increase the organ supply the authorities in Germany 
have so far established information campaigns and made appeals to the public. In 
contrast, an organ donation club the allocation of donors is made considering if 
and when the recipient declared his readiness to organ donation. In this way the 
willingness to donate his own organs could be sanctioned positively and an 
additional incentive for supply could be set.

It was recently shown that there are significant differences between the 
frequencies of antibodies against pancreatic islet cell antigens (ICA, GADA) in 
the first degree relatives of IDDM patients in different regions of Poland. 
There are however no published studies concerning their predictive value in the 
development of IDDM in the Polish population. The aim of the present study was 
to evaluate the PPV (positive predictive value) of ICA and GADA antibodies and 
to analyse diabetes-free survival in association with titre, antibodies 
co-existence and relatives age in the Polish population. The study was performed 
in 225 first degree relatives of IDDM patients with ICA and/or GADA and 100 
relatives without antibodies, in whom ICA and/or GADA were performed in 
1993-1994. We have observed significantly lower percentages of diabetes-free 
survival in subjects with ICA > 20 JDF in comparison to relatives without ICA or 
with ICA < 20 JDF. The highest predictive value for diabetes type 1 development 
was associated with the ICA > 80 JDF and with the co-existence of ICA--20-79 JDF 
and GADA (+). There was also a statistically lower diabetes-free survival in 
first degree relatives (with ICA > 20 JDF) older than 20 years of age in 
comparison to the younger subjects. Detection of 2 antibodies: ICA and GADA made 
it possible to identify 80% of first degree relatives who have developed 
diabetes type 1 in the following 5-6 years, this suggests that the combined 
measurement of ICA and GADA could be a useful marker in screening for diabetes 
type 1 in first degree relatives of IDDM subjects in the Polish population. For 
the diabetes type 1 risk assessment in relatives with ICA > 20 JDF the age of 
the studied subjects should be taken into consideration.

[Menopause and hormone replacement therapy].

[Article in Hungarian]

Due to the improving life expectancy of women spend third of their active life 
after the menopause. Estrogen deficiency can be caused by both natural and 
artificial menopause. The lack of estrogen can directly worsen the quality of 
life and epidemiological evidence suggests association with development of 
certain diseased states. Hormone replacement with natural estrogens has been 
proven to be successful for various indications: it reduces the menopausal 
vasomotor and psychological symptoms thus improving quality of life. It can also 
be used to prevent harmful effects of estrogen deficiency in various organs. 
Literature review supports the role of estrogen in atherosclerosis and 
osteoporosis prevention. Further evidence required establishing the role of 
estrogens in secondary prevention of coronary artery disease. Also needs to be 
explained why the beneficial effects of estrogen therapy in osteoporosis seem to 
disappear soon after cessation of therapy. Currently the relative risk increase 
of breast cancer during long-term hormone replacement therapy cannot be exactly 
measured. Nevertheless, substantial reduction of mortality in estrogen receptor 
positive breast cancer can also be seen with women on hormone replacement as 
compared to controls. Some data support the negative correlation of residual but 
still detectable, endogen estrogen and atherosclerosis and similarly to 
osteoporosis. The same residual estrogen levels seem to correlate positively 
with breast cancer. The recognition (and further acceptance) of the role of the 
residual estrogens might have influence on the indication, choice and dosage of 
preparation and duration of hormone replacement therapy. Overall evidence is in 
favor of the need medical attention for menopause: which ranges from preventive 
screening to long term hormone replacement therapy. The decision to treat 
requires the risks and benefits taken into consideration. This highly 
specialized care is provided in menopause clinics in Hungary. New oestrogen like 
agents are being developed like the selective estrogen receptor modulators, the 
tibolone and the phyto-estrogens. They provide tissue-specific effect acting as 
estrogen agonistics, sustaining the beneficial preventive and therapeutic 
effects of the estrogens, but in the breast and endometrial tissue they behave 
like estrogen antagonists avoiding the side effects of the current used 
oestrogens. They might play a significant role in the treatment of menopause in 
the future.

The authors studied life perspectives of patients in a nephrology department 
using up Kaplan and Meier's analysis. Data of 51 of the patients included in the 
chronic hemodialysis programme between 1991 and 1997 were studied. The patients 
were under treatment for 19 months on average, 18% received renal allograft. The 
three-year life expectation for dialysed patients was 55%, without the 
transplant patients it was only 40%. The causes of deaths were infection and 
cardiovascular diseases in 40-40%. The patients life perspectives were better 
not only in primary renal diseases, but in vascular renal failure also, than in 
diabetic nephropathy. The authors made comparison between theirs and the 
national data, and discuss the necessary works to improve their results.

Hospital, Hong Kong, China.

This is a prospective cohort comparison study aiming to determine the mortality 
of patients with peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAOD) and identify the 
risk factors affecting their survival. Data regarding demographic and 
biochemical risk factors, and lower limb disease severity classified by vascular 
laboratory criteria were collected prospectively from 665 consecutive patients 
presenting with symptoms of peripheral arterial occlusive disease. The effect of 
patient and disease risk factors on survival was analyzed by the life-table 
method and independent significant variables examined by a multivariate Cox 
regression model. The cumulative survival for all patients at 1, 3, and 5 years 
were 86.1, 71.2, and 55.8%, respectively, with a median survival of 72.2 months. 
Female sex, age, smoking, heart disease, renal disease, respiratory disease, 
stroke, critical ischemia, lowest anklebrachial index, no vascular 
reconstruction, and major amputation were associated with higher mortality. 
Lipid and biochemical variables were not significant determinants. Using 
multivariate Cox regression, age (>70), disease severity, anklebrachial index 
(<0.5), no vascular reconstruction, diabetes mellitus, and renal and 
cardiorespiratory diseases were identified as independent risk factors affecting 
patient survival. The survival of patients with PAOD is poor compared with the 
general population. Significant patient-related variables were largely 
coexisting diseases and advanced age, whereas the other risk factors for 
atherosclerosis are less influential. Disease severity may bear a direct 
relationship to mortality, and patients with critical ischemia have the worst 
prognosis. Early disease detection and timely vascular reconstruction may lead 
to an improvement in overall survival.

Has the impact of hormone replacement therapy on health-related quality of life 
been undervalued?

Previous economic evaluations of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) have 
restricted positive effects to alleviation of postmenopausal symptoms and 
negative effects to drug side effects. We studied the association between HRT 
use and postmenopausal women's valuation of both health-related quality of life 
and potential treatment side effects. Postmenopausal women with either a 
documented first vertebral fracture within the past 5 years or no history of 
osteoporotic fractures were recruited from Olmsted County, Minnesota, and from 
Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in New Hampshire to participate in a study to 
assess quality of life and women's attitudes toward osteoporosis prevention. 
Women's valuations of their current health and potential HRT-related side 
effects were quantified as quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) assessed by an 
automated utility assessment instrument (U-Titer) and the time tradeoff 
technique, by a vertical rating scale, and by estimated quality of well-being 
(QWB) scores. Health status was measured using the Medical Outcomes Study SF-36. 
Regression methods were used to assess the impact of current HRT use on 
health-related quality of life and valuation of side effects. There were 106 
women with vertebral fracture and 180 with no history of hip, wrist, or 
vertebral fractures. Altogether, 116 (40.6%) women were currently taking HRT, 64 
(22.2%) had taken HRT in the past, and 106 (37.1%) women had never taken HRT. 
Current HRT users had higher time tradeoff QALYs than never and past HRT users, 
with gains ranging from 15.0 to 83.7 days per year for current users relative to 
the others. Benefits were largest for women with a vertebral fracture and 
limitations in activities. The secondary QALY measures also showed significantly 
higher values for current HRT users compared with other women, as did SF-36 
subscales for general health, physical function, role-emotional function, and 
vitality. There was substantial variability in women's perceptions of HRT side 
effects. Overall, the proportion of women willing to trade time to avoid 
bleeding was largest, at 95.5%, followed by breast tenderness, weight gain, and 
endometrial biopsy at 90.4%, 87.4%, and 82.7%, respectively. Current HRT users 
had higher health-related quality of life than past or never users according to 
all measures studied. Women's perceptions of potential side effects were highly 
variable and should be considered by physicians when prescribing an HRT regimen. 
If, as our results suggest, postmenopausal therapy has positive effects beyond 
the immediate postmenopausal years, previous economic studies may have 
underestimated the value of HRT.

Japan.

OBJECTIVE: To clarify the social issues and problems associated with burn care 
in Japan, based on a cost analysis of acute burn care.
METHODS: A retrospective review was undertaken of 71 patients admitted with 
burns at Nippon Medical School between January 1 and December 31, 1997. A cost 
analysis was performed for three major burn patients with a burn surface area 
(BSA) of 70% to 80% and three minor burn patients with a BSA of 20% to 30%. A 
questionnaire was administered to both burn patients and medical providers in 
all 127 emergency centers to help improve long-term quality of life (QOL).
RESULTS: 80% of burn patients were under age 70. In the major burn cases, the 
amount of reimbursement according to the government-regulated fee schedule was 
much less than the cost of treatment. The ratio of the cost of both medication 
and materials to total cost of treatment was higher for patients with major 
burns. Patients responding to the survey acknowledged being generally happy 
despite suffering from psychological and financial problems. A total of 413 
medical providers from 63 institutions responded to the survey regarding 
improving long-term QOL.
CONCLUSIONS: Acute burn care is a costly service. The goal of burn care should 
shift from saving lives to allowing for a productive return to society. Quality 
improvement, outcome measurement, and technology assessment combined with health 
economics research for burn care should be carried out in Japan.
