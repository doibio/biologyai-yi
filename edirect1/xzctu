Dimension instrument (15D); Health Utilities Index (HUI); EuroQol EQ-5D; Short 
Form-6 Dimension (SF-6D), and the Assessment of Quality of Life (AQoL) were 
interviewed in 2012-2013.
PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We identified key factors involved in shaping each 
instrument, and the rationale for similarities and differences across measures. 
While HSUIs have a common purpose, they are distinctly discrete constructs. 
Developers recalled complex developmental processes, grounded in unique 
histories, and these backgrounds help to explain different pathways taken at key 
decision points during the HSUI development. The basis for the HSUIs was 
commonly not equivalent conceptually: differently valued concepts and goals 
drove instrument design and development, according to each HSUI's defined 
purpose. Developers drew from different sources of knowledge to develop their 
measure depending on their conceptualisation of HRQoL.
MAJOR CONCLUSIONS/CONTRIBUTION TO KNOWLEDGE: We generated and analysed 
first-hand accounts of the development of the HSUIs to provide insight, beyond 
face value, about how and why such instruments differ. Findings enhance our 
understanding of why the six instruments developed the way they did, from the 
perspective of key developers of those instruments. Importantly, we provide 
additional, original explanation for why a QALY is not a QALY is not a QALY.

The aim of this article is to investigate the potential cytotoxic and antitumor 
effects of the resonant electromagnetic fields (rEMFs) derived from the 1H NMR 
spectrum of the Ph3Sn(Mercaptonicotinic)SnPh3 complex (SnMNA). The ability of 
the complex's rEMFs to induce leiomyosarcoma (LMS) cell death and to recess 
tumor (leiomyosarcoma) development in Wistar rats was evaluated. The effects of 
the simultaneous administration of the SnMNA complex at extremely low 
concentrations and exposure to its rEMFs was also investigated. The emission of 
the 1H NMR spectrum of the complex alone or in a combination with low 
ineffective doses of the complex decreased LMS cell viability mainly through 
apoptosis. Moreover, the results from the in vivo experiments showed a 
significant prolongation of life expectancy in tumor-bearing rats exposed to the 
rEMFs alongside a deceleration in tumor growth rate. We speculate that the rEMFs 
of a biologically active substance could exert similar biological effects as the 
substance itself, mainly when is combined with extremely low ineffective 
concentrations of the substance.

OBJECTIVES: This article explains how to optimize Bayesian D-efficient discrete 
choice experiment (DCE) designs for the estimation of quality-adjusted life year 
(QALY) tariffs that are unconfounded by respondents' time preferences.
METHODS: The calculation of Bayesian D-errors is explained for DCE designs that 
allow for the disentanglement of respondents' time and health-state preferences. 
Time preferences are modelled via an exponential, hyperbolic, or power discount 
function and the performance of the proposed DCE designs is compared with that 
of several conventional DCE designs that do not take nonlinear time preferences 
into account.
RESULTS: Based on the achieved D-error, asymptotic standard error, and estimated 
sample size to obtain statistically significant estimates of the discount rate 
parameters, the proposed designs outperform the conventional DCE designs.
CONCLUSIONS: We recommend that applied researchers use appropriately optimized 
DCE designs for the estimation of QALY tariffs that are corrected for time 
preferences. The TPC-QALY software package that accompanies this article makes 
the recommended designs easily accessible for health-state valuation 
researchers.

OBJECTIVE: To examine socioeconomic inequalities in health in the older 
population in Spain.
METHOD: A systematic search and review of the literature published between 2000 
and 2017 in English and Spanish was conducted in Social Science Citation Index, 
Sociology Database, Scopus, PubMed and Embase. Primary and secondary studies 
analysing these inequalities in Spain were included. Two researchers were 
responsible for the selection of the studies and the extraction of the 
information (first author, year of publication, region, design, 
population/sample, socioeconomic and health indicators used, and main results).
RESULTS: A total of 89 articles were included, corresponding to 87 studies. Of 
the studies, 81.6% were cross-sectional, 88.5% included only 
non-institutionalised population and 35.6% were carried out at a national level. 
The studies analysed social inequalities in the following health indicators: 
functional status (n=29), morbidity (n=19), self-perceived health (n=18), mental 
and emotional health (n=10), cognitive status (n=7), quality of life (n=9), 
mortality (n=15) and life expectancy (n=2). Socioeconomic inequalities were 
detected in all of them, although the magnitude varied depending on the 
socioeconomic and health indicator used. The educational level and the 
ecological indexes were the indicators that detected more inequalities in 
health. The impact of inequalities by sex was different in functional status, 
morbidity, self-perceived health, mental and emotional health and mortality.
CONCLUSION: There are socioeconomic inequalities in health among the elderly 
population and their magnitude varies by sex in some of the health indicators. 
The increase in educational level and the maintenance of sufficient pensions can 
be key policies that contribute to the reduction of inequalities in this 
population group.

BACKGROUND: Patients with back-related leg pain exhibit nociceptive and 
neuropathic characteristics. Few studies have investigated the combination of 
interventions considering these characteristics.
OBJECTIVES: To investigate if the addition of neurodynamic exercises (EEN) to 
extension-oriented exercises (EE) promotes additional benefits in individuals 
with back-related leg pain and a directional preference.
METHODS: Patients will be randomized to either EE or EEN. Patients from both 
groups will receive 7 sessions over 3 weeks. Low back and leg pain, function, 
quality of life, disability, and global perceived effect will be evaluated at 
baseline, 3 weeks after randomization and 1-month follow-up. A linear mixed 
model will be used for outcomes analysis.

Increases in joint range-of-motion may be beneficial for improving performance 
and reducing injury risk. This study investigated the effects of different 
self-massage volumes and modalities on passive hip range-of-motion. Twenty-five 
recreationally resistance-trained men performed four experimental protocols 
using a counterbalanced, randomized, and within-subjects design; foam rolling 
(FR) or roller massage (RM) for 60 or 120-s. Passive hip flexion and extension 
range-of-motion were measured in a counterbalanced and randomized order via 
manual goniometry before self-massage (baseline) and immediately, 10-, 20-, and 
30-min following each self-massage intervention. Following FR or RM of 
quadriceps, there was an increase in hip flexion range-of-motion at Post-0 (FR: 
Δ = 19.28°; RM: Δ = 14.96°), Post-10 (FR: Δ = 13.03°; RM: Δ = 10.40°), and 
Post-20 (FR: Δ = 6.00°; RM: Δ = 4.64°) for all protocols, but these did not 
exceed the minimum detectable change at Post-10 for RM60 and RM120, and Post-20 
for FR60, FR120, RM60, and RM120. Similarly, hip extension range-of-motion 
increased at Post-0 (FR: Δ = 8.56°; RM: Δ = 6.56°), Post-10 (FR: Δ = 4.64°; RM: 
Δ = 3.92°), and Post-20 (FR: Δ = 2.80°; RM: Δ = 1.92°), but did not exceed the 
minimum detectable change at Post-10 for FR60, RM60, and RM120, and Post-20 for 
FR60, FR120, RM60, and RM120. In conclusion, both FR and RM increased hip 
range-of-motion but larger volumes (120- vs. 60-second) and FR produced the 
greatest increases. These findings have implications for self-massage 
prescription and implementation, in both rehabilitation and athletic 
populations.

BACKGROUND: The prevalence of dialysis-dependent chronic renal failure (DD-CRF) 
is growing worldwide. Such patients are exposed to a higher cardiovascular risk 
because of severe calcification and congestive heart failure caused by volume 
overload, with poor outcomes. This study aimed to evaluate outcomes of patients 
with DD-CRF who were undergoing cardiac surgery in a single institution (West 
German Heart and Vascular Centre Essen, University Hospital Essen, Essen, 
Germany).
METHODS: A retrospective evaluation of 241 consecutive patients who presented 
with DD-CRF and were undergoing cardiac-surgery between January 2000 and 
December 2017 was conducted. End points were major adverse cardiac and 
cerebrovascular events and long-term survival. Additionally, Cox regression 
multivariate analysis was performed to detect independent predictors of 
mortality. Follow-up was 98.3% complete through August 2018.
RESULTS: The mean age of the study cohort was 63 ± 12.2 years, and 65.1% of 
these patients were male. Congestive heart failure (CHF) was present in 41.5% of 
patients, 30.7% had a previous myocardial infarction, 9.1% had previous cardiac 
surgery, and 22.4% needed urgent or emergency surgery. These patients underwent 
isolated coronary artery bypass grafting (44.8%), isolated procedures other than 
coronary artery bypass grafting (17.8%), or concomitant procedures (37.3%). 
Early outcomes reported in-hospital mortality in 10.4%, low cardiac output 
syndrome in 7.1%, and stroke in 2.1% of patients, respectively. Overall 
mortality was recorded in 61% of patients at last follow-up. Cox regression 
multivariate analysis reported age 60 years or older (hazard ratio [HR], 2.36; 
95% confidence interval [CI], 1.62 to 3.45; P < .001) and CHF (HR, 1.95; 95% CI, 
1.37 to 2.78; P < .001) as positive predictors of death and subsequent kidney 
transplantation (HR, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.20 to 0.59; P < .001) as a negative 
predictor of death.
CONCLUSIONS: Cardiac surgery in patients with DD-CRF is associated with high 
morbidity and mortality. Interestingly, overall mortality was mainly not cardiac 
related, and older patients or those who presented with CHF had the worst life 
expectancy. However, subsequent kidney transplantation positively affected 
long-term survival in these patients.

BACKGROUND: Conventional treatment of displaced midshaft clavicular fractures is 
nonoperative. Recent studies have implied that operative treatment might result 
in a faster return to work, resulting in a decreased productivity loss for 
society. The cost utility of plate fixation vs. nonoperative treatment of 
displaced midshaft clavicular fractures has not previously been investigated 
using a societal perspective.
METHODS: Decision analytical modeling of incremental costs and quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs) was performed. Data on utility, hospitalization, and 
productivity costs were retrieved from a Danish randomized controlled trial. 
Supplementary data were taken from randomized controlled trials identified in 
the literature. A 1-year time horizon was applied, and all prices were reported 
with respect to a 2016 level.
RESULTS: Operative treatment was associated with a larger QALY gain in patients 
and a higher cost compared with nonoperative treatment. The incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was estimated in Danish currency (Danish krone 
[kr]) at kr1,360,000 (€182,306) per QALY from a health-sector perspective and 
kr1,388,738 (€186,158) per QALY from a societal perspective. Considering a 
subgroup analysis of patients with a high-load shoulder profession, operative 
treatment was dominated by nonoperative treatment from a health-sector 
perspective. Considering a societal perspective, the ICER was estimated at 
-kr889,091 (-€119,181) per reduction of 1 QALY. One-way and probabilistic 
sensitivity analyses showed that the results were subject to uncertainty.
CONCLUSION: Operative treatment is not cost-effective when considering a 
threshold of €34,000/QALY. However, for a subgroup of patients with a high-load 
shoulder profession, operative treatment might be cost-effective compared with 
nonoperative treatment.

Urban stormwater is a major source of chemical pollution to receiving waters. 
Anthropogenic materials in the built environment can be an important source of 
chemicals to stormwater runoff. Roofing materials can leach significant amounts 
of metals, which vary over the life of the roof. We report concentrations of 
three metals (As, Cu, Zn) leaching into runoff from experimental panels of 14 
roofing materials over 4.5 years of weathering. Ten roofing materials leached 
metals. Several leached >10 ppb during one or more study periods. The most 
common correlate with metal concentration was panel age, followed by 
precipitation amount. Extrapolating from these observations, we estimated the 
loading of metals from each roofing material during the first 10 years following 
installation. Eight materials were predicted to leach metals above background at 
the end of the 10 years. In combination with information on the prevalence of 
different roofing materials in the Puget Sound region of the Pacific Northwest, 
we estimated the relative amount of metals contributed from roofing materials in 
this basin. Most arsenic and copper was estimated to be contributed by 
residential roofing; nearly all arsenic from wood shakes manufactured with 
copper chromated arsenic, and copper contributed mainly from treated wood shakes 
followed by copper granule-containing asphalt shingles. Most zinc was estimated 
to be contributed by commercial roofs, including Zincalume and painted metal 
roofs. Overall our data shows that roofing materials can be an important 
long-term source of As, Cu, and Zn to stormwater runoff. Compared with 
atmospheric deposition, roof materials were a significant source, particularly 
of As and Cu. To get a complete picture of metals sourced from buildings, there 
is a need to study whole roof systems, including gutters, downspouts, and HVAC 
systems, as well as metals contributed from homeowner-applied treatments to 
their roofs.

BACKGROUND: The COAPT trial (Cardiovascular Outcomes Assessment of the MitraClip 
Percutaneous Therapy for Heart Failure Patients With Functional Mitral 
Regurgitation) demonstrated that edge-to-edge transcatheter mitral valve repair 
(TMVr) with the MitraClip resulted in reduced mortality and heart failure 
hospitalizations and improved quality of life compared with maximally tolerated 
guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) in patients with heart failure and 3 
to 4+ secondary mitral regurgitation. Whether TMVr is cost-effective compared 
with GDMT in this population is unknown.
METHODS: We used data from the COAPT trial to perform a formal patient-level 
economic analysis of TMVr+GDMT versus GDMT alone for patients with heart failure 
and 3 to 4+ secondary mitral regurgitation from the perspective of the US 
healthcare system. Costs for the index TMVr hospitalization were assessed using 
a combination of resource-based accounting and hospital billing data (when 
available). Follow-up medical care costs were estimated on the basis of medical 
resource use collected during the COAPT trial. Health utilities were estimated 
for all patients at baseline and 1, 6, 12, and 24 months with the Short Form 
Six-Dimension Health Survey.
RESULTS: Initial costs for the TMVr procedure and index hospitalization were 
$35 755 and $48 198, respectively. Although follow-up costs were significantly 
lower with TMVr compared with GDMT ($26 654 versus $38 345; P=0.018), cumulative 
2-year costs remained higher with TMVr because of the upfront cost of the index 
procedure ($73 416 versus $38 345; P<0.001). When in-trial survival, health 
utilities, and costs were modeled over a lifetime horizon, TMVr was projected to 
increase life expectancy by 1.13 years and quality-adjusted life-years by 0.82 
years at a cost of $45 648, yielding a lifetime incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio of $40 361 per life-year gained and $55 600 per quality-adjusted life-year 
gained.
CONCLUSIONS: For symptomatic patients with heart failure and 3 to 4+ secondary 
mitral regurgitation, TMVr increases life expectancy and quality-adjusted life 
expectancy compared with GDMT at an incremental cost per quality-adjusted 
life-year gained that represents acceptable economic value according to current 
US thresholds.

INTRODUCTION: Processed meats are associated with increased risk of colorectal 
and stomach cancers, but health and economic impacts of policies to discourage 
processed meats are not well established. This paper aims to evaluate the cost 
effectiveness of implementing tax and warning labels on processed meats.
METHODS: A probabilistic cohort-state transition model was developed in 2018, 
including lifetime and short-term horizons, healthcare, and societal 
perspectives, and 3% discount rates for costs and health outcomes. The model 
simulated 32 subgroups by age, gender, and race/ethnicity from the U.S. adult 
population and integrated nationally representative 2011-2014 data on processed 
meat consumption, with etiologic effects of processed meat consumption on cancer 
incidence, medical and indirect societal costs, and policy costs.
RESULTS: Over a lifetime, the 10% excise tax would prevent 77,000 cases of 
colorectal cancer (95% uncertainty interval=56,800, 107,000) and 12,500 cases of 
stomach cancer (95% uncertainty interval=6,880, 23,900), add 593,000 
quality-adjusted life years (95% uncertainty interval=419,000, 827,000), and 
generate net savings of $2.7 billion from a societal perspective, including $1.1 
billion healthcare costs saved. The warning label policy would avert 85,400 
cases of colorectal cancer (95% uncertainty interval=56,600, 141,000) and 15,000 
cases of stomach cancer (95% uncertainty interval=6,860, 34,500), and add 
660,000 quality-adjusted life years (95% uncertainty interval=418,000, 
1,070,000), with net savings of $4.5 billion from a societal perspective, 
including $1.3 billion healthcare costs saved. In subgroup analyses, greater 
health and economic benefits accrued to (1) younger subpopulations, (2) 
subpopulations with greater cancer risk, and (3) those with higher baseline 
processed meat consumption.
CONCLUSIONS: The model shows that implementing tax or warning labels on 
processed meats would be a cost-saving strategy with substantial health and 
economic benefits. The findings should encourage policy makers to consider 
nutrition-related policies to reduce cancer burden.

BACKGROUND: Primary health care (PHC) is a driving force for advancing towards 
universal health coverage (UHC). PHC-oriented health systems bring enormous 
benefits but require substantial financial investments. Here, we aim to present 
measures for PHC investments and project the associated resource needs.
METHODS: This modelling study analysed data from 67 low-income and middle-income 
countries (LMICs). Recognising the variation in PHC services among countries, we 
propose three measures for PHC, with different scope for included interventions 
and system strengthening. Measure 1 is centred on public health interventions 
and outpatient care; measure 2 adds general inpatient care; and measure 3 
further adds cross-sectoral activities. Cost components included in each measure 
were based on the Declaration of Astana, informed by work delineating PHC within 
health accounts, and finalised through an expert and country validation meeting. 
We extracted the subset of PHC costs for each measure from WHO's Sustainable 
Development Goal (SDG) price tag for the 67 LMICs, and projected the associated 
health impact. Estimates of financial resource need, health workforce, and 
outpatient visits are presented as PHC investment guide posts for LMICs.
FINDINGS: An estimated additional US$200-328 billion per year is required for 
the various measures of PHC from 2020 to 2030. For measure 1, an additional $32 
is needed per capita across the countries. Needs are greatest in low-income 
countries where PHC spending per capita needs to increase from $25 to $65. 
Overall health workforces would need to increase from 5·6 workers per 1000 
population to 6·7 per 1000 population, delivering an average of 5·9 outpatient 
visits per capita per year. Increasing coverage of PHC interventions would avert 
an estimated 60·1 million deaths and increase average life expectancy by 3·7 
years. By 2030, these incremental PHC costs would be about 3·3% of projected 
gross domestic product (GDP; median 1·7%, range 0·1-20·2). In a 
business-as-usual financing scenario, 25 of 67 countries will have funding gaps 
in 2030. If funding for PHC was increased by 1-2% of GDP across all countries, 
as few as 16 countries would see a funding gap by 2030.
INTERPRETATION: The resources required to strengthen PHC vary across countries, 
depending on demographic trends, disease burden, and health system capacity. The 
proposed PHC investment guide posts advance discussions around the budgetary 
implications of strengthening PHC, including relevant system investment needs 
and achievable health outcomes. Preliminary findings suggest that low-income and 
lower-middle-income countries would need to at least double current spending on 
PHC to strengthen their systems and universally provide essential PHC services. 
Investing in PHC will bring substantial health benefits and build human capital. 
At country level, PHC interventions need to be explicitly identified, and plans 
should be made for how to most appropriately reorient the health system towards 
PHC as a key lever towards achieving UHC and the health-related SDGs.

INTRODUCTION: With increasing life expectancy and ever-improving quality of life 
in industrialized countries, functional demand and sports levels are increasing 
in older subjects, who are thus exposed to central pivot lesions almost as much 
as younger ones. While non-operative treatment provides acceptable results, it 
entails significant reduction in sports level. The aim of the present study was 
to analyze medium-term clinical, functional and radiological results of anterior 
cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction in over-50-year-olds, in order to 
identify factors for failure.
HYPOTHESIS: The study hypothesis was that surgical management provides good 
results if patient selection is rigorous.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A multicenter retrospective study included 398 patients 
undergoing ACL reconstruction between April 1, 2009 and December 6, 2016. 
Inclusion criteria comprised: age≥50 years, with proven ACL tear. 
Preoperatively, clinical work-up was supplemented by measurement of differential 
anterior laxity and radiologic assessment of cartilage status. Functional level 
was assessed on the objective IKDC score. Intraoperative data comprised type of 
graft and meniscal and cartilage status. The same parameters were assessed 
postoperatively. Functional results were assessed on objective IKDS, KOOS and 
ACL-RSI scores.
RESULTS: The mean follow-up was 42.2 months. The mean improvement in 
differential anterior laxity was 4.2mm. Pivot-shift showed improvement, with 97% 
absent or glide (p<0.001). Objective IKDC score showed significant improvement 
(p<0.0001). 23% of patients had poor clinical results: IKDC C or D. Preoperative 
explosive pivot-shift (p<0.0001), medial tibiofemoral osteoarthritis (p<0.0001) 
and medial meniscus lesion (p<0.002) emerged as risk factors for poor functional 
outcome.
CONCLUSION: ACL reconstruction in over-50-year-olds provided satisfactory 
clinical and functional results. Rigorous patient selection is mandatory, as 
radiologic signs of medial tibiofemoral osteoarthritis indicate a risk of poor 
outcome. Surgery may be proposed in patients with high functional and athletic 
demand, before medial meniscal lesions can set in. In case of explosive pivot 
shift, associated anterolateral reconstruction should be considered.

BACKGROUND: In general, the majority of diabetic patients suffering from a lack 
of capability in controlling different aspects of self-care have likely been 
prone to cardiovascular disease. To reduce the economic burden in societies and 
the rate of death on one hand, and improve life expectancy, on the other hand, 
it seems necessary to emphasize self-care training in diabetic patients. The 
purpose of this study was to determine comparison of self-care in cardiac and 
non-cardiac diabetic patients.
METHODS: This descriptive-analytic study was carried out with 136 diabetic 
participants selected using random sampling and divided into two groups of 68 
non-cardiac diabetic patients. Data were collected using a demographic and 
diabetic patient's self-management questionnaire (DSMQ). For the analysis of the 
data, SPSS16 was employed to check the significance test at the level of P<0.05.
RESULTS: In this study, twenty-eight (41.2%) and forty (58.8%) of the 
participants in each group were male and female, respectively. Their ages 
spanned from (61.35±13.34) in non-cardiac diabetic group to (65.94±8.74) in 
cardiac diabetic participants. There were significant differences between two 
groups, specifically in patients with cardiac diabetic disease in different 
aspects, for instance, including glucose monitoring (F=4.977, P=0.027, 
η2=0.036), diet control (F=9.125, P=0.003, η2=0.064), physical activity 
(F=22.954, P=0.0001, η2=0.146) and health care awareness (F=31.366, P=0.0001, 
η2=0.19).
CONCLUSION: According to DSMQ questionnaire in the present study, glucose 
monitoring, diet control, physical activity, and health care awareness in 
diabetic patients with heart disease were significantly reported to have been 
better than the other group with no cardiac problem. Due to insufficient 
self-care in diabetic patients and some consequences such as poor health, heart 
disease as one of the complications of diabetes, hospital re-admission and heavy 
costs, the therapeutic team should be alerted to self-care training.

Bilothorax is an uncommon cause of exudative pleural effusion; the majority of 
reported cases are right-sided while a bilateral presentation is extremely rare. 
The majority of cases are secondary to biliary obstruction, an extension of 
hepatic infections, and iatrogenic complications following percutaneous 
procedures or surgical interventions. Imaging studies and a diagnostic pleural 
tap can confirm the diagnosis. Early recognition and complete drainage are 
important to prevent life-threatening complications, including empyema 
formation. We present a case of a 71-year-old female who developed bilateral 
bilothorax as a complication of gallstone pancreatitis.

Due to the rapid aging of Japan's population, clinical research focusing on 
older patients with cancer is urgently needed. The Japan Clinical Oncology Group 
(JCOG) has conducted several such clinical trials, but there has been no formal 
policy for geriatric research. We have therefore established a JCOG policy for 
geriatric cancer research. We defined the patient selection policy based on 
treatment tolerance and chronological age. Older patients are categorized into 
three conceptual groups: 'fit patients' who can undergo the same standard 
treatment given to younger patients, 'frail patients' for whom best supportive 
or palliative care is indicated and 'vulnerable patients' who fall between the 
fit and frail categories. Unmet needs often exist for vulnerable patients. The 
policy recommends that study endpoints include not only survival but also other 
endpoints such as physical and cognitive function because the objective of 
therapy in older patients is not only extended life expectancy but also 
maintenance of the patient's general condition. In this viewpoint, co-primary or 
composite endpoints that incorporate geriatric assessment in the study design 
are often applicable. Study design will differ depending on the study 
population, clinical question, and treatment. Even for older patients, a 
randomized clinical trial is still the gold standard when the clinical question 
asks which treatment is better. An observational study of a broader population 
is applicable for investigating actual conditions of older patients. This JCOG 
Geriatric Research Policy includes several practical solutions for various 
issues in geriatric research. We plan to revise this policy periodically to 
guide future geriatric research.

Pelvic organ disorders affect up to one in four women in the United States. The 
prevalence of pelvic organ prolapse (POP) is increasing with each year, 
particularly in the setting of prolonged life expectancy and an aging 
population. Current treatment approaches, including polypropylene monofilaments 
are associated with numerous painful and worrisome side-effects. Therefore, 
scientists are looking for new solutions. A promising alternative to the current 
treatment is tissue engineering, which can be utilized to re-create support to 
the vagina and pelvic organs. Tissue engineering requires the use of 
three-dimensional scaffolds, derived from biocompatible materials. Chitosan is a 
natural polymer, obtained from shellfish exoskeletons. It is known for its 
biodegradability, lack of cytotoxicity and non-pyrogenicity. Due to the presence 
of free hydroxyl and amino groups, it may undergo various modifications. In this 
paper, we describe a new type of chitosan-based biomaterials, which can be used 
as a new alternative scaffold that may provide support to prolapse organs. The 
chitosan scaffold was obtained under microwave radiation using multifunctional 
amino and organic acids. We discuss the scaffold's characteristics, with an 
emphasis on its chemical structure and morphology. Fourier transform infrared 
spectroscopy (FT-IR) analysis confirmed cross-linking processes with 
preservation of free amino groups. Moreover, mechanical durability, the 
stability and swelling ability of the scaffolds in a simulated body fluid were 
investigated. All of the prepared scaffolds demonstrated very good antioxidant 
activity and biodegradability. Importantly, the biocompatibility of chitosan 
scaffolds was examined on human vaginal VK2/E6E7 cell line. No evidence of 
toxicity was documented, and the cells maintained their presence on the studied 
materials. These results allude to the lack of toxicity of the scaffolds, and 
indicate that chitosan-based scaffold should be further investigated in in vivo 
studies as they may be a promising alternative treatment to pelvic organ 
prolapse.

BACKGROUND: Risk-prediction models have been proposed to select individuals for 
lung cancer screening. However, their long-term effects are uncertain. This 
study evaluates long-term benefits and harms of risk-based screening compared 
with current United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) 
recommendations.
METHODS: Four independent natural history models were used to perform a 
comparative modeling study evaluating long-term benefits and harms of selecting 
individuals for lung cancer screening through risk-prediction models. In total, 
363 risk-based screening strategies varying by screening starting and stopping 
age, risk-prediction model used for eligibility (Bach, PLCOm2012, or Lung Cancer 
Death Risk Assessment Tool [LCDRAT]), and risk threshold were evaluated for a 
1950 US birth cohort. Among the evaluated outcomes were percentage of 
individuals ever screened, screens required, lung cancer deaths averted, 
life-years gained, and overdiagnosis.
RESULTS: Risk-based screening strategies requiring similar screens among 
individuals ages 55-80 years as the USPSTF criteria (corresponding risk 
thresholds: Bach = 2.8%; PLCOm2012 = 1.7%; LCDRAT = 1.7%) averted considerably 
more lung cancer deaths (Bach = 693; PLCOm2012 = 698; LCDRAT = 696; USPSTF = 
613). However, life-years gained were only modestly higher (Bach = 8660; 
PLCOm2012 = 8862; LCDRAT = 8631; USPSTF = 8590), and risk-based strategies had 
more overdiagnosed cases (Bach = 149; PLCOm2012 = 147; LCDRAT = 150; USPSTF = 
115). Sensitivity analyses suggest excluding individuals with limited life 
expectancies (<5 years) from screening retains the life-years gained by 
risk-based screening, while reducing overdiagnosis by more than 65.3%.
CONCLUSIONS: Risk-based lung cancer screening strategies prevent considerably 
more lung cancer deaths than current recommendations do. However, they yield 
modest additional life-years and increased overdiagnosis because of 
predominantly selecting older individuals. Efficient implementation of 
risk-based lung cancer screening requires careful consideration of life 
expectancy for determining optimal individual stopping ages.

Introduction: Hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis (ATTRv; v for 
variant) is a rare, progressive, fatal multi-systemic disease, autosomal 
dominantly inherited with heterogeneous clinical phenotype caused by mutations 
in the TTR gene. Mutations promoting proteolytic remodeling and tetramer 
dissociation result in fragmented and full-length TTR monomers that misfold, 
aggregate and deposit at multiple sites (mainly nerves and heart) causing 
peripheral neuropathy and/or cardiomyopathy.Areas covered: The authors discuss
