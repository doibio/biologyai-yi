The purpose was to analyse the association of muscular strength, muscle pain and 
reduced mobility in daily life with mental wellbeing among older Inuit men and 
women in Greenland. Data (N = 846) was collected as part of a countrywide 
cross-sectional health survey in 2018. Hand grip strength and 30-seconds chair 
stand test were measured according to established protocols. Mobility in daily 
life was assessed by five questions about the ability to perform specific 
activities of daily living. Mental wellbeing was assessed by questions about 
self-rated health, life satisfaction and Goldberg's General Health 
Questionnaire. In binary multivariate logistic regression models adjusted for 
age and social position, muscular strength (OR 0.87-0.94) and muscle pain (OR 
1.53-1.79) were associated with reduced mobility. In fully adjusted models, 
muscle pain (OR 0.68-0.83) and reduced mobility (OR 0.51-0.55) but were 
associated with mental wellbeing. Chair stand score was associated with life 
satisfaction (OR 1.05). With an increasingly sedentary lifestyle, increasing 
prevalence of obesity and increasing life expectancy the health consequences of 
musculoskeletal dysfunction are expected to grow. Prevention and clinical 
handling of poor mental health among older adults need to consider reduced 
muscle strength, muscle pain and reduced mobility as important determinants.

Flexible transition timing in discrete-time multistate life tables using Markov 
chains with rewards.

Discrete-time multistate life tables are attractive because they are easier to 
understand and apply in comparison with their continuous-time counterparts. 
While such models are based on a discrete time grid, it is often useful to 
calculate derived magnitudes (e.g. state occupation times), under assumptions 
which posit that transitions take place at other times, such as mid-period. 
Unfortunately, currently available models allow very few choices about 
transition timing. We propose the use of Markov chains with rewards as a general 
way of incorporating information on the timing of transitions into the model. We 
illustrate the usefulness of rewards-based multistate life tables by estimating 
working life expectancies using different retirement transition timings. We also 
demonstrate that for the single-state case, the rewards approach matches 
traditional life-table methods exactly. Finally, we provide code to replicate 
all results from the paper plus R and Stata packages for general use of the 
method proposed.

Competitive, multi-objective, and compartmented Flux Balance Analysis for 
addressing tissue-specific inborn errors of metabolism.

The inborn error of metabolism phenylketonuria (PKU, OMIM 261600) is most often 
due to inactivation of phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH), which converts 
phenylalanine (Phe) into tyrosine (Tyr). The reduced PAH activity increases 
blood concentration of phenylalanine and urine levels of phenylpyruvate. Flux 
balance analysis (FBA) of a single-compartment model of PKU predicts that 
maximum growth rate should be reduced unless Tyr is supplemented. However, the 
PKU phenotype is lack of development of brain function specifically, and Phe 
reduction rather than Tyr supplementation cures the disease. Phe and Tyr cross 
the blood-brain barrier (BBB) through the aromatic amino acid transporter 
implying that the two transport reactions interact. However, FBA does not 
accommodate such competitive interactions. We here report on an extension to FBA 
that enables it to deal with such interactions. We built a three-compartment 
model, made the common transport across the BBB explicit, and included dopamine 
and serotonin synthesis as parts of the brain function to be delivered by FBA. 
With these ramifications, FBA of the genome-scale metabolic model extended to 
three compartments does explain that (i) the disease is brain specific, (ii) 
phenylpyruvate in urine is a biomarker, (iii) excess of blood-phenylalanine 
rather than shortage of blood-tyrosine causes brain pathology, and (iv) Phe 
deprivation is the better therapy. The new approach also suggests (v) 
explanations for differences in pathology between individuals with the same PAH 
inactivation, and (vi) interference of disease and therapy with the functioning 
of other neurotransmitters.

BACKGROUND: The Phase 3 CT-P6 3.2 study demonstrated equivalent efficacy and 
comparable safety between CT-P6 and reference trastuzumab in patients with human 
epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2)-positive early breast cancer after up 
to 3 years' follow-up.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate long-term survival with CT-P6 and reference 
trastuzumab.
METHODS: In the CT-P6 3.2 study, patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer 
were randomised to neoadjuvant chemotherapy with CT-P6 or reference trastuzumab, 
surgery, and adjuvant CT-P6 or reference trastuzumab before a 3-year 
post-treatment follow-up. Patients who completed the study could enter a 3-year 
extension (CT-P6 4.2 study). Data were collected every 6 months to assess 
overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), and progression-free 
survival (PFS).
RESULTS: Of 549 patients enrolled in the CT-P6 3.2 study, 216 (39.3%) patients 
continued in the CT-P6 4.2 study (CT-P6, 107; reference trastuzumab, 109) 
(intention-to-treat extension set). Median follow-up was 76.4 months for both 
groups. Medians were not reached for time-to-event parameters; estimated hazard 
ratios (95% confidence intervals) for CT-P6 versus reference trastuzumab were 
0.59 (0.17-2.02) for OS, 1.07 (0.50-2.32) for DFS, and 1.08 (0.50-2.34) for PFS. 
Corresponding 6-year survival rates in the CT-P6 and reference trastuzumab 
groups, respectively, were 0.96 (0.90-0.99) and 0.94 (0.87-0.97), 0.87 
(0.78-0.92) and 0.89 (0.81-0.94), and 0.87 (0.78-0.92) and 0.89 (0.82-0.94).
CONCLUSIONS: Data from this extended follow-up of the CT-P6 3.2 study 
demonstrate the comparable long-term efficacy of CT-P6 and reference trastuzumab 
up to 6 years.

BACKGROUND: With increasing life expectancy, there is an increasing proportion 
of nonagenarians undergoing both elective and emergency surgical procedures. The 
decision as to whom will benefit from surgical procedures is however difficult 
to ascertain and still remains a challenge to clinicians. This study is aimed to 
evaluate the clinical outcomes of colonoscopy in the nonagenarian population, 
and to determine if the outcomes are acceptable for us to continue to offer such 
interventions.
METHODS: Retrospective study of patients of Dr. G.R (Gastroenterologist) and Dr. 
W.B (Colorectal Surgeon) between 1 January 2018 and 31 November 2022. All 
patients who were ≥90 years old and had a colonoscopy was included in the study. 
Exclusion criteria were patients who were less than 90 years old, had a flexible 
sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy as part of their surgical procedure.
PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: post-colonoscopy complications and length of stay.
SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: reasons for colonoscopy, significant colonoscopy 
findings, 30-day morbidity and mortality.
RESULTS: Sixty patients were included in the study. Median age was 91 (90-100) 
years old. 33.3% of the patients were males. Seventy percent of the patients 
were ASA 3. Median length of hospital stay was 1 day. 11.7% of patients were 
found to have colorectal malignancy. There were no complications after the 
colonoscopy. There were no 30-day re-admission, morbidity or mortality.
CONCLUSION: Colonoscopy can be performed safely in carefully selected 
nonagenarian patients with acceptable low complication rates.

BACKGROUND: Mortality data from Europe and North America show a shorter life 
expectancy for people with multiple sclerosis (MS). It is not known if a similar 
mortality risk exists in the southern hemisphere. We analysed the mortality 
outcomes of a comprehensive New Zealand (NZ) MS cohort, 15 years 
postrecruitment.
METHODS: All participants of the nationwide 2006 NZ MS prevalence study were 
included and mortality outcomes were compared with life table data from the NZ 
population using classic survival analyses, standardised mortality ratios (SMRs) 
and excess death rates (EDRs).
RESULTS: Of 2909 MS participants, 844 (29%) were deceased at the end of the 
15-year study period. Median survival age for the MS cohort was 79.4 years 
(78.5, 80.3), compared with 86.6 years (85.5, 87.7) for the age-matched and 
sex-matched NZ population. The overall SMR was 1.9 (1.8, 2.1)). Symptom onset 
between 21 and 30 years corresponded to an SMR of 2.8 and a median survival age 
9.8 years lower than the NZ population. Progressive-onset disease was associated 
with a survival gap of 9 years compared with 5.7 years for relapsing onset. The 
EDR for those diagnosed in 1997-2006 was 3.2 (2.6, 3.9) compared with 7.8 (5.8, 
10.3) for those diagnosed between 1967 and 1976.
CONCLUSIONS: New Zealanders with MS have a median survival age 7.2 years lower 
than the general population and twice the mortality risk. The survival gap was 
greater for progressive-onset disease and for those with an early age of onset.

Reported herein is the identification of a novel class of 
4-aminoquinoline-trifluormethyltriazoline compounds as possible antiplasmodial 
agents. The compounds were accessed through a silver-catalyzed three-component 
reaction of trifluorodiazoethane with in situ generated Schiff base from 
corresponding quinolinylamine and aldehydes. While attempting to incorporate a 
sulfonyl moiety, the triazoline formed underwent spontaneous oxidative 
aromatization to afford triazole derivatives. All synthesized compounds were 
tested for their antimalarial potential in vitro and in vivo. Out of 32 
compounds, four showed the most promising antimalarial activity with IC50 values 
ranging from 4 to 20 nM against Pf3D7 (chloroquine-sensitive) and from 120 to 
450 nM against PfK1 (chloroquine-resistant) strains. One of these compounds was 
also found to be effective in animal studies; it showed a 99.9 % decrease in 
parasitic load on day 7 post-infection along with a 40 % cure rate and longest 
host life span.

AIMS: To assess the cost-effectiveness of adjuvant atezolizumab in the treatment 
of early-stage NSCLC patients (stage II-IIIA) with expression PD-L1 ≥ 50% 
without mutations in EGFR or ALK rearrangements in Spain.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A 5-states Markov model (DFS, locoregional recurrence, 
1 L-metastatic recurrence, 2 L-metastatic recurrence, and death states) was 
adapted to the Spanish setting. Demographic characteristics of the hypothetical 
cohort, transition probabilities from the DFS state, and safety parameters were 
obtained from IMpower010 study (GO29527). Transition probabilities from 
locoregional and metastatic health states were obtained from the literature. The 
usual clinical practice in Spain (use of health resources, management of the 
disease, etc.) was obtained from a previous analysis carried out by the authors 
of this study. A societal perspective was considered so both direct and indirect 
costs were included (expressed in € of 2021). A lifetime horizon was used, so 
costs and health outcomes were discounted at 3% per year. Sensitivity analyses 
were performed to evaluate uncertainty.
RESULTS: Over a lifetime horizon, treatment with adjuvant atezolizumab provided 
greater effectiveness (+2.61 life years [LY] and +1.95 quality-adjusted life 
years [QALY]) and higher cost (€+22,538) than BSC. The incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) and incremental cost-utility ratios (ICUR) of 
the analysis were €8,625/LY gained and €11,583/QALY gained, respectively. 
Robustness of these base-case results was confirmed by the sensitivity analyses 
performed. In the probabilistic sensitivity analysis, 90% of the simulations 
performed showed that adjuvant atezolizumab is cost-effective versus BSC, 
considering a threshold of €30,000/QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed that adjuvant treatment with atezolizumab in 
patients with early-stage resected NSCLC with overexpression of PD-L1 and 
without EGFR and ALK mutations is cost-effective versus BSC as the ICERs and 
ICURs obtained are below the cost-effectiveness thresholds commonly considered 
in Spain, thus offering a new treatment alternative for these patients.

As trypanocide, several side effects have been reported in the use of 
Isometamidium chloride. This study was therefore, designed to evaluate its 
ability to induce oxidative stress and DNA damage using D. melanogaster as a 
model organism. The LC50 of the drug was determined by exposing the flies 
(1-3 days old of both genders) to six different concentrations (1 mg, 10 mg, 
20 mg, 40 mg, 50 mg and 100 mg per 10 g of diet) of the drug for a period of 
seven days. The effect of the drug on survival (28 days), climbing behavior, 
redox status, oxidative DNA lesion, expression of p53 and PARP1 (Poly-ADP-Ribose 
Polymerase-1) genes after five days exposure of flies to 4.49 mg, 8.97 mg, 
17.94 mg and 35.88 mg per 10 g diet was evaluated. The interaction of the drug 
in silico with p53 and PARP1 proteins was also evaluated. The result showed the 
LC50 of isometamidium chloride to be 35.88 mg per 10 g diet for seven days. 
Twenty-eight (28) days of exposure to isometamidium chloride showed a decreased 
percentage survival in a time and concentration-dependent manner. Isometamidium 
chloride significantly (p < 0.05) reduced climbing ability, total thiol level, 
Glutathione-S-transferase, and Catalase activity. The level of H2O2 was 
significantly (p < 0.05) increased. The result also showed significant 
(p < 0.05) reduction in the relative mRNA levels of p53 and PARP1 genes. The in 
silico molecular docking of isometamidium with p53 and PARP1 proteins showed 
high binding energy of -9.4 Kcal/mol and -9.2 Kcal/mol respectively. The results 
suggest that isometamidium chloride could be cytotoxic and a potential inhibitor 
of p53 and PARP1 proteins.

OBJECTIVE: Tofacitinib is an oral Janus kinase inhibitor approved for the 
treatment of ulcerative colitis (UC). The objective of this study was to 
evaluate the long-term cost-effectiveness of tofacitinib versus current 
biologics, considering combinations of first-line (1L) and second-line (2L) 
therapies, from a Japanese payer's perspective in patients with 
moderate-to-severe active UC following an inadequate response to conventional 
therapy and in those who were naïve to biologics.
METHODS: A cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted during the time horizon 
specified in the Markov model, which considers a patient's lifetime as 60 years 
and an annual discount rate of 2% on costs and effects. The model compared 
tofacitinib with vedolizumab, infliximab, adalimumab, golimumab, and 
ustekinumab. The time of active treatment was divided into induction and 
maintenance phases. Patients not responding to their biologic treatment after 
induction or during the maintenance phase were switched to a subsequent line of 
therapy. Treatment response and remission probabilities (for induction and 
maintenance phases) were obtained through a systematic literature review and a 
network meta-analysis that employed a multinomial analysis with fixed effects. 
Patient characteristics were sourced from the OCTAVE Induction trials. Mean 
utilities associated with UC health states and adverse events (AEs) were 
obtained from published sources. Direct medical costs related to drug 
acquisition, administration, surgery, patient management, and AEs were derived 
from the JMDC database analysis, which corresponded with the medical procedure 
fees from 2021. The drug prices were adjusted to April 2021. Further validation 
through all processes by clinical experts in Japan was conducted to fit the 
costs to real-world practices. Scenario and sensitivity analyses were also 
performed to confirm the accuracy and robustness of the base-case results.
RESULTS: In the base-case, the treatment pattern including 1L tofacitinib was 
more cost-effective than vedolizumab, infliximab, golimumab, and ustekinumab for 
1L therapies in terms of cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained 
(based on the Japanese threshold of 5,000,000 yen/QALY [38,023 United States 
dollars {USD}/QALY]). The base-case results demonstrated that the incremental 
costs would be reduced for all biologics, and decreases in incremental QALYs 
were observed for all biologics other than adalimumab. The incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was found to be dominant for adalimumab; for the 
other biologics, it was found to be less costly and less efficacious. The 
efficiency frontier on the cost-effectiveness plane indicated that 
tofacitinib-infliximab and infliximab-tofacitinib were more cost-effective than 
the other treatment patterns. When infliximab-tofacitinib was compared with 
tofacitinib-infliximab, the ICER was 282,609,856 yen/QALY (2,149,157 USD/QALY) 
and the net monetary benefit (NMB) was -12,741,342 yen (-96,894 USD) with a 
threshold of 5,000,000 yen (38,023 USD) in Japan. Therefore, 
infliximab-tofacitinib was not acceptable by this threshold, and 
tofacitinib-infliximab was the cost-effective treatment pattern.
CONCLUSION: The current analysis suggests that the treatment pattern including 
1L tofacitinib is a cost-effective alternative to the biologics for patients 
with moderate-to-severe UC from a Japanese payer's perspective.

Identifying modifiable determinants of behavior is essential for developing 
effective strategies to promote health behaviors among older adults. Although 
social networks are potentially modifiable determinants of health behaviors, 
their longitudinal associations have not been established in previous studies. 
The present study examined whether a larger social network is associated with 
higher dietary variety, longer time spent exercising and shorter time spent 
viewing TV among older adults. This is a longitudinal study. The data of 908 
Japanese older adults were obtained through a three-wave questionnaire survey 
(Wave 1, December 2017 to January 2018; Wave 2, after 1 year; Wave 3, after 3 
years) and analyzed. In each wave of the survey, dietary variety (dietary 
variety score), exercise time (hours per day), TV viewing time (hours per day) 
and social network (family and friend subscales of the Japanese version of the 
abbreviated Lubben Social Network Scale) were measured. The present study used 
latent growth, cross-lagged and simultaneous effect models to investigate the 
longitudinal associations of family and friend social networks with dietary 
variety, exercise time and TV viewing time. However, these models did not show 
clear and robust associations. Whether social networks are determinants of 
health behaviors among older adults remains inconclusive.

Plain Language Summary: The importance of promoting health behaviors among older 
adults is obvious. Identifying the modifiable determinants of health behaviors 
is essential for developing effective strategies to promote health behaviors. 
Although social networks are potentially modifiable determinants of health 
behaviors, their longitudinal associations have not been established in previous 
studies. This study examined the longitudinal associations between social 
networks and health behaviors among older adults. To address this issue, we 
conducted a three-wave questionnaire. However, we failed to find clear and 
robust associations between social networks and health behaviors. Whether social 
networks are determinants of health behaviors among older adults remains 
inconclusive.

The N-terminal extension of Arabidopsis ARGONAUTE 1 is essential for microRNA 
activities.

microRNAs (miRNAs) regulate target gene expression through their ARGONAUTE (AGO) 
effector protein, mainly AGO1 in Arabidopsis thaliana. In addition to the highly 
conserved N, PAZ, MID and PIWI domains with known roles in RNA silencing, AGO1 
contains a long, unstructured N-terminal extension (NTE) of little-known 
function. Here, we show that the NTE is indispensable for the functions of 
Arabidopsis AGO1, as a lack of the NTE leads to seedling lethality. Within the 
NTE, the region containing amino acids (a.a.) 91 to 189 is essential for 
rescuing an ago1 null mutant. Through global analyses of small RNAs, 
AGO1-associated small RNAs, and miRNA target gene expression, we show that the 
region containing a.a. 91-189 is required for the loading of miRNAs into AGO1. 
Moreover, we show that reduced nuclear partitioning of AGO1 did not affect its 
profiles of miRNA and ta-siRNA association. Furthermore, we show that the 
1-to-90a.a. and 91-to-189a.a. regions of the NTE redundantly promote the 
activities of AGO1 in the biogenesis of trans-acting siRNAs. Together, we report 
novel roles of the NTE of Arabidopsis AGO1.

OBJECTIVE: Asthma is one of the 4 leading causes of death worldwide. Severe 
asthma is associated with poor quality of life, decreased life expectancy, and 
higher health resources consumption such as the use of oral corticosteroids 
(OCSs). This study aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of mepolizumab as an 
add-on compared with the standard care of the Chilean public health system 
(combined inhaled corticosteroid therapy and a long-acting beta-agonist, 
short-acting beta-agonist, and OCS).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A Markov model was adapted to represent the day-to-day of 
patients with severe asthma over a lifetime horizon. Deterministic and 
probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to account for the 
second-order uncertainty of the model. In addition, a risk subgroup analysis was 
conducted to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of mepolizumab across different 
risk populations.
RESULTS: Mepolizumab produces more benefits than standard of care alone (1 
additional quality-adjusted life-year, a decrease of OCS usage, an approximated 
11 avoided exacerbations) but it cannot be considered cost-effective in the 
light of the Chilean threshold (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio: US dollars 
[USD] 105 967/quality-adjusted life-year vs USD 14 896). Despite this, 
cost-effectiveness increases in specific subgroups, with an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio of USD 44 819 in patients with eosinophil count ≥ 300 
cell/mcL and exacerbation history of at least 4 exacerbations in the past year.
CONCLUSION: Mepolizumab cannot be considered a cost-effective strategy for the 
Chilean health system. Nevertheless, price discount in specific subgroups 
improves its cost-effectiveness profile significantly and may offer 
opportunities for access to specific subgroups.

Global estimates of prevalence, deaths, and disability-adjusted life years 
(DALYs) from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 
2019 were examined for metabolic diseases (type 2 diabetes mellitus [T2DM], 
hypertension, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease [NAFLD]). For metabolic risk 
factors (hyperlipidemia and obesity), estimates were limited to mortality and 
DALYs. From 2000 to 2019, prevalence rates increased for all metabolic diseases, 
with the greatest increase in high socio-demographic index (SDI) countries. 
Mortality rates decreased over time in hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and NAFLD, 
but not in T2DM and obesity. The highest mortality was found in the World Health 
Organization Eastern Mediterranean region, and low to low-middle SDI countries. 
The global prevalence of metabolic diseases has risen over the past two decades 
regardless of SDI. Urgent attention is needed to address the unchanging 
mortality rates attributed to metabolic disease and the entrenched 
sex-regional-socioeconomic disparities in mortality.

Post-transcriptional RNA modifications have been recognized as key regulators of 
neuronal differentiation and synapse development in the mammalian brain. While 
distinct sets of 5-methylcytosine (m5C) modified mRNAs have been detected in 
neuronal cells and brain tissues, no study has been performed to characterize 
methylated mRNA profiles in the developing brain. Here, together with regular 
RNA-seq, we performed transcriptome-wide bisulfite sequencing to compare RNA 
cytosine methylation patterns in neural stem cells (NSCs), cortical neuronal 
cultures, and brain tissues at three postnatal stages. Among 501 m5C sites 
identified, approximately 6% are consistently methylated across all five 
conditions. Compared to m5C sites identified in NSCs, 96% of them were 
hypermethylated in neurons and enriched for genes involved in positive 
transcriptional regulation and axon extension. In addition, brains at the early 
postnatal stage demonstrated substantial changes in both RNA cytosine 
methylation and gene expression of RNA cytosine methylation readers, writers, 
and erasers. Furthermore, differentially methylated transcripts were 
significantly enriched for genes regulating synaptic plasticity. Altogether, 
this study provides a brain epitranscriptomic dataset as a new resource and lays 
the foundation for further investigations into the role of RNA cytosine 
methylation during brain development.

INTRODUCTION: Despite the significant burden of childhood and adolescent 
cancers, no specific studies recently discussed the burden of cancer in this 
group in the North Africa and the Middle East (NAME) region. Therefore, we aimed 
to study the burden of cancers in this group in this region.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrieved the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) data for 
children and adolescent cancers (0-19 years old) in the NAME region from 1990 to 
2019. 21 types of neoplasms were grouped as "neoplasms", comprising 19 specific 
cancer groups as well as "other malignant neoplasms" and "other neoplasms". 
Three significant parameters of incidence, deaths, and Disability-Adjusted Life 
Years (DALYs) were studied. The data are presented with 95% uncertainty 
intervals (UI), and reported rates per 100,000.
RESULTS: In 2019, almost 6 million (95% UI: 4.166 M-8.405 M) new cases and 
11,560(9770-13,578) deaths due to neoplasms occurred in the NAME region. 
Incidence was higher in females (3.4 M), while deaths (6226 of overall 11,560) 
and DALYs (501,118 of overall 933,885) were estimated as higher in males. 
Incidence rates did not significantly change since 1990, while deaths and DALYs 
rates declined significantly. After excluding "other malignant neoplasms" and 
"other neoplasms", leukemia was responsible for the highest number of incidence 
and deaths (incidence: 10,629(8237-13,081), deaths: 4053(3135-5013), followed by 
brain and central nervous system cancers (incidence: 5897(4192-7134), deaths: 
2446(1761-2960)), and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (incidence: 2741 (2237-3392), deaths: 
790(645-962)). Incidence rates of neoplasms were similar for most countries, but 
countries varied more in terms of death rates. Afghanistan 8.9(6.5-11.9), Sudan 
6.4(4.5-8.6), and the Syrian Arab Republic 5.6(4.3-8.3) had the highest overall 
death rates.
CONCLUSION: The NAME region is observing relatively constant incidence rates and 
a decreasing pattern in the deaths and DALYs. Despite this success, several 
countries are lagging behind in development. Different issues such as economic 
problems, armed conflicts and political instabilities, lack of equipment or 
experienced staff or poor distribution, stigmatization and disbelief in the 
healthcare systems account for unfavorable numbers in some countries. Such 
problems require urgent solutions as new sophisticated and personalized cares 
raise the alarm for even more inequalities between high and low-income 
countries.
