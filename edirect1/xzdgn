while the TE group had scores of ≤3. Five-year disease-specific survival (DSS), 
5-yrs overall survival (OS) and relapse-free survival (RFS) were considered as 
criteria of treatment.
RESULTS: The 5-yr DSS in the RFA group was 97.4% vs. 95.7% in the TE group (p 
>0.05), while 5-yr OS was 74.4% vs. 80.9% (p <0.05) and RFS - 94.9% vs. 93.6% (p 
>0.05) respectively. Functioning of the operated kidneys did not deteriorate at 
the 6th and 12th month after RFA/TE as assessed by radioisotope renography.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients over 70 years of age, percutaneous RFA might be 
considered as an effective option for the successful treatment of T1aN0M0 RCC, 
as it preserves the functioning of the treated kidney and has oncological 
outcomes similar to TE.

COVID-19 has affected all countries globally. We explore associations between 
the change in new COVID-19 registered cases per million population and various 
macroeconomic and well-being indicators in 38 European countries over a 2-month 
period (1st April-31st May 2020). A statistically significant (p = 0.002) 
negative association was estimated between the change in new COVID-19 cases and 
GDP per capita, after controlling for key health determinants including public 
expenditure on health, life expectancy, smoking tobacco and sanitation. The 
country with the highest GDP per capita in Europe (i.e., Luxemburg) was found to 
experience the lowest change in new COVID-19 cases within the time period whilst 
the opposite was found for countries with lower GDP per capita (i.e., Ukraine, 
Bulgaria, and Romania). The outcomes of this study indicate that, in the first 
wave of the pandemic in Europe, a country's GDP per capita might be associated 
with a lower rate of new COVID-19 cases. The study concludes by suggesting that 
in European regions a country's economic performance should be a critical health 
priority for policy makers.

Enabling on-farm entrepreneurship is an important step to enhance the 
contribution of smallholder agriculture to rural employment and poverty 
reduction in South Africa. Using attributes derived from positive psychological 
capital as proxies for entrepreneurship and data collected from 458 smallholders 
in and around irrigation schemes in KwaZulu-Natal, the study empirically 
examines factors affecting smallholder engagement in entrepreneurship 
activities. Findings show that access to extension and information from scheme 
committees, being a male farmer, having more earned income, membership to a 
cooperative and access to markets have a positive effect on farmers' 
entrepreneurial behaviour. Factors inhibiting entrepreneurship in the context of 
smallholder farming include land tenure insecurity, access to land without the 
necessary complementary resources, consumption credit and staying far away from 
irrigation schemes. The study recommends addressing gender bias regarding access 
to resources and information. Promoting interactive learning through networking 
will also result in positive entrepreneurial behaviour. There is also a need for 
the provision of demand-driven extension services, facilitation of market 
linkages and enhancing access to finance for would-be entrepreneurs. Access to 
credit should be directly linked to agricultural production through input 
vouchers and value chain financing. Addressing land tenure issues along with 
access to other complementary resources, inputs and services will also enhance 
on-farm entrepreneurship in the smallholder agriculture sector.

BACKGROUND: The American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) 8th 
tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) classification for colorectal cancer (CRC) has 
limited ability to predict prognosis.
METHODS: We included 45 379 eligible stage I-III CRC patients from the 
Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program. Patients were randomly 
assigned individually to a training (n = 31 772) or an internal validation 
cohort (n = 13 607). External validation was performed in 10 902 additional 
patients. Patients were divided according to T and N stage permutations. 
Survival analyses were conducted by a Cox proportional hazard model and 
Kaplan-Meier analysis, with T1N0 as the reference. Area under receiver operating 
characteristic curve and Akaike information criteria were applied for prognostic 
discrimination and model fitting, respectively. Clinical benefits were further 
assessed by decision curve analyses.
RESULTS: We created a modified TNM (mTNM) classification: stages I (T1-2N0-1a); 
IIA (T1N1b, T2N1b, T3N0); IIB (T1-2N2a-2b, T3N1a-1b, T4aN0); IIC (T3N2a, 
T4aN1a-2a, T4bN0); IIIA (T3N2b, T4bN1a); IIIB (T4aN2b, T4bN1b); and IIIC 
(T4bN2a-2b). In the internal validation cohort, compared with the AJCC 8th TNM 
classification, the mTNM classification showed superior prognostic 
discrimination (area under receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.675 vs 
0.667, respectively; 2-sided P < .001) and better model fitting (Akaike 
information criteria = 70 937 vs 71 238, respectively). Similar findings were 
obtained in the external validation cohort. Decision curve analyses revealed 
that the mTNM had superior net benefits over the AJCC 8th TNM classification in 
the internal and external validation cohorts.
CONCLUSIONS: The mTNM classification provides better prognostic discrimination 
than AJCC 8th TNM classification, with good applicability in various populations 
and settings, to help better stratify stage I-III CRC patients into prognostic 
groups.

Reef fish represent one of the most diverse vertebrate groups on Earth, with 
over 7,000 species distributed around the globe. This richness is not evenly 
distributed geographically. The Atlantic (AT) and the Eastern Pacific (EP) 
encompass 30% of the global fish fauna. These areas have been considered the 
most isolated from the marine biodiversity hotspot in the Indo-Pacific due to 
distinct physical barriers, such as the Tethyan closure and the distance between 
the EP and the western Pacific. Despite their comparatively lower species 
richness, these realms host unique fish assemblages characterized by a 
remarkable proportion of regional endemics and species with large body size. 
Here, we present the largest database of life-history traits and biogeographical 
and conservation aspects presently available for the reef fish fauna of the AT 
and the EP realms. The database includes 21 traits distributed into behavioral 
(home range, diel activity, group size, level in the water column, three 
measures of preferred temperature), morphological (maximum body size, size 
class, body shape, aspect ratio, caudal fin, mouth position), and ecological 
(trophic level, diet, spawning strategy, depth of occurrence, two allometric 
constants, pelagic larval duration, and life span), as well as biogeographical 
(geographic range index, range extension, species distribution in 20 marine 
provinces, latitude north and south of occurrence, total number of provinces 
where species occur, occurrence in the AT and EP), and conservation aspects 
(IUCN status, vulnerability and global market price). We compiled these data 
through a careful review of 104 local checklists published between 1982 and 
2020, online repositories, local reports, books, and monographs on specific 
families or genera. We limited our database to localities situated between 
latitudes 51°N and 45°S that including shallow and upper mesophotic biogenic 
and/or rocky reefs habitats. Our database covers 2,198 species belonging to 146 
families and 655 reef fish genera distributed in two marine realms (1,458 in the 
AT, 829 in the EP, and 89 in both realms) and 20 marine provinces. This database 
of reef fish offers the opportunity to explore novel ecological and evolutionary 
questions at different scales and provides tools for species conservation based 
on these traits. There are no copyright or proprietary restrictions for research 
or teaching purposes.

Alzheimer's disease (AD), the main cause of dementia worldwide, is characterized 
by a complex and multifactorial etiology. In large part, excitatory 
neurotransmission in the central nervous system is mediated by glutamate and its 
receptors are involved in synaptic plasticity. The N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) 
receptors, which require the agonist glutamate and a coagonist such as glycine 
or the D-enantiomer of serine for activation, play a main role here. A second 
D-amino acid, D-aspartate, acts as agonist of NMDA receptors. D-amino acids, 
present in low amounts in nature and long considered to be of bacterial origin, 
have distinctive functions in mammals. In recent years, alterations in 
physiological levels of various D-amino acids have been linked to various 
pathological states, ranging from chronic kidney disease to neurological 
disorders. Actually, the level of NMDA receptor signaling must be balanced to 
promote neuronal survival and prevent neurodegeneration: this signaling in AD is 
affected mainly by glutamate availability and modulation of the receptor's 
functions. Here, we report the experimental findings linking D-serine and 
D-aspartate, through NMDA receptor modulation, to AD and cognitive functions. 
Interestingly, AD progression has been also associated with the enzymes related 
to D-amino acid metabolism as well as with glucose and serine metabolism. 
Furthermore, the D-serine and D-/total serine ratio in serum have been recently 
proposed as biomarkers of AD progression. A greater understanding of the role of 
D-amino acids in excitotoxicity related to the pathogenesis of AD will 
facilitate novel therapeutic treatments to cure the disease and improve life 
expectancy.

PURPOSE: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common primary 
cancers worldwide. HCC has unique characteristics such as co-existing chronic 
liver damage and a high recurrence rate. A negative impact on the surgical 
outcome due to these backgrounds could be expected. We aimed to evaluate the 
clinical outcomes of cardiac surgery in these patients.
METHODS: Between January 2000 and December 2019, 16 patients with remitted 
cancer and 5 patients with active HCC who underwent open heart surgery were 
studied. The clinical data were retrospectively evaluated from hospital records. 
Follow-up information was collected via telephone interviews.
RESULTS: The major cause of HCC was viral hepatitis. Eighteen patients (86%) 
were classified as having Child-Pugh class A cirrhosis. The mean model of 
end-stage liver disease (MELD) score was 7.2 ± 5.2. There was no 30-day 
mortality. During follow-up, 11 patients died due to HCC. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year 
survival rates were 80.0, 42.5, and 22.3%, respectively. A univariate analysis 
identified a higher preoperative MELD score and lower serum cholinesterase 
levels as prognostic factors for long-term survival.
CONCLUSION: We could safely perform cardiac surgery in selected patients with 
remitted and active HCC. The postoperative life expectancy of these patients was 
limited but acceptable.

BACKGROUND: Technologies used in the processing of whole blood and blood 
component products, including pathogen reduction, are continuously being adopted 
into blood transfusion workflows to improve process efficiencies. However, the 
economic implications of these technologies are not well understood. With the 
advent of these new technologies and regulatory guidance on bacterial 
risk-control strategies, an updated systematic literature review on this topic 
was warranted.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this systematic literature review was to summarize 
the current literature on the economic analyses of pathogen-reduction 
technologies (PRTs).
METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted using the PRISMA 
(Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis) guidelines 
to identify newly published articles in PubMed, MEDLINE Complete, and EconLit 
from 1 January 2000 to 17 July 2019 related to economic evaluations of PRTs. 
Only full-text studies in humans published in English were included in the 
review. Both budget-impact and cost-effectiveness studies were included; common 
outcomes included cost, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs).
RESULTS: The initial searches identified 433 original abstracts, of which 16 
articles were included in the final data extraction and reporting. Seven 
articles presented cost-effectiveness analyses and nine assessed budget impact. 
The introduction of PRT increased overall costs, and ICER values ranged widely 
across cost-effectiveness studies, from below $US150,000/QALY to upwards of 
$US20,000,000/QALY. This wide range of results was due to a multitude of 
factors, including comparator selection, target patient population, and scenario 
analyses included.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the results of economic evaluations of bacterial 
risk-control strategies, regardless of mechanism, were highly dependent on the 
current screening protocols in place. The optimization of blood transfusion 
safety may not result in decisions made at the willingness-to-pay thresholds 
commonly seen in pharmaceutical evaluations. Given the critical public health 
role of blood products, and the potential safety benefits introduced by 
advancements, it is important to continue building this body of evidence with 
more transparency and data source heterogeneity. This updated literature review 
provides global context when making local decisions for the coverage of new and 
emerging bacterial risk-control strategies.

In this study, spinach plants exposed to fresh/unweathered (UW) or weathered (W) 
copper compounds in soil were analyzed for growth and nutritional composition. 
Plants were exposed for 45 days to freshly prepared or soil-aged (35 days) 
nanoparticulate CuO (nCuO), bulk-scale CuO (bCuO), or CuSO4 at 0 (control), 400, 
400, and 40 mg/kg of soil, respectively. Foliar health, gas exchange, pigment 
content (chlorophyll and carotenoid), catalase and ascorbate peroxidase enzymes, 
gene expression, and Cu bioaccumulation were evaluated along with SEM imagery 
for select samples. Foliar biomass was higher in UW control (84%) and in UW 
ionic treatment (87%), compared to the corresponding W treatments (p ≤ 0.1). 
Root catalase activity was increased by 110% in UW bCuO treatment as compared to 
the W counterpart; the value for the W ionic treatment was increased by 2167% 
compared to the UW counterpart (p ≤ 0.05). At 20 days post-transplantation, W 
nCuO-exposed plants had ∼56% lower carotenoid content compared to both W control 
and the UW counterpart (p ≤ 0.05). The findings indicate that over the full life 
cycle of spinach plant the weathering process significantly deteriorates leaf 
pigment production under CuO exposure in particular and foliar health in 
general.

BACKGROUND: The burden of diabetes is considerable not only globally but also 
nationally within Korea. The Global Burden of Disease study derived the 
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) of diabetes depending on its 
complications as individual severity using prevalence-based approach from 2017. 
Conversely, the Korean National Burden of Disease study based on an 
incidence-based approach does not incorporate the severity of diseases. This 
study aimed to simulate incidence-based DALYs of type 2 diabetes mellitus 
(T2DM), given diabetic complications as disease severity using a Markov model.
METHODS: We developed a model with six Markov states, including incident and 
existing prevalent cases of diabetes and its complications and death. We assumed 
that diabetes and its complications would not be cured. The cycle length was one 
year, and the endpoint of the simulation was 100 years. A 5% discount rate was 
adopted in the analysis. Transition cases were counted by 5-year age groups 
above 30 years of age. Age- and sex-specific transition probabilities were 
calculated based on the incident rate.
RESULTS: The total DALY estimates of T2DM were 5,417 and 3,934 per 100,000 
population in men and women, respectively. The years of life lost in men were 
relatively higher than those in women in most age groups except the 80-84 age 
group. The distribution of years lived with disability by gender and age group 
showed a bell shape, peaking in the 55-59 age group in men and 65-69 age group 
in women.
CONCLUSIONS: The burden of T2DM considering its complications was larger 
compared to the outcomes from previous studies, with more precise morbid 
duration using the Markov model.

analysis of Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare data.
TARGET POPULATION: Women aged 40 years or older.
TIME HORIZON: Lifetime.
PERSPECTIVE: Societal.
INTERVENTION: No screening; biennial or triennial mammography from age 50 to 75 
years; annual mammography from age 50 to 75 years for women with dense breasts 
at age 50 years and biennial or triennial mammography from age 50 to 75 years 
for those without dense breasts at age 50 years; and annual mammography at age 
40 to 75 years for women with dense breasts at age 40 years and biennial or 
triennial mammography at age 50 to 75 years for those without dense breasts at 
age 40 years.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), 
discounted at 3% annually.
RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: Baseline screening at age 40 years followed by 
annual screening at age 40 to 75 years for women with dense breasts and biennial 
screening at age 50 to 75 years for women without dense breasts was effective 
and cost-effective, yielding an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $36 200 
per QALY versus the biennial strategy at age 50 to 75 years.
RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: At a societal willingness-to-pay threshold of 
$100 000 per QALY, the probability that the density-stratified strategy at age 
40 years was optimal was 56% compared with 6 other strategies.
LIMITATION: Findings may not be generalizable outside the United States.
CONCLUSION: The study findings advocate for breast density-stratified screening 
with baseline mammography at age 40 years.

OBJECTIVES: Cost-effectiveness of endovascular therapy (EVT) is a key 
consideration for broad use of this approach for emergent large vessel occlusion 
stroke. We evaluated the evidence on cost-effectiveness of EVT in comparison 
with best medical management from a global perspective.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This systematic review of studies published between 
January 2010 and May 2020 evaluated the cost effectiveness of EVT for patients 
with large vessel occlusion acute ischemic stroke. The gain in quality adjusted 
life year (QALY) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), expressed as 
cost per QALY resulting from EVT, were recorded. The study setting (country, 
economic perspective), decision model, and data sources used in economic models 
of EVT cost-effectiveness were recorded.
RESULTS: Twenty-five original studies from 12 different countries were included 
in our review. Five of these studies were reported from a societal perspective; 
18 were reported from a healthcare system perspective. Two studies used 
real-world data. The time horizon varied from 1 year to a lifetime; however, 18 
studies reported a time horizon of >10 years. Twenty studies reported using 
outcome data from randomized, controlled clinical trials for their models. 
Nineteen studies reported using a Markov model. Incremental QALYs ranged from 
0.09-3.5. All studies but 1 reported that EVT was cost-effective.
CONCLUSIONS: Evidence from different countries and economic perspectives 
suggests that EVT for stroke treatment is cost-effective. Most 
cost-effectiveness studies are based on outcome data from randomized clinical 
trials. However, there is a need to study the cost-effectiveness of EVT based 
solely on real-world outcome data.

BACKGROUND: Patients with schizophrenia have a reduced life expectancy, but the 
association between antipsychotic usage and cause of death is uncertain.
METHODS: The authors observed associations of antipsychotic usage with the 
mortality rate and cause of death in a population-based cohort of the Korean 
National Health Insurance Service database from 2003 to 2017. A total of 86,923 
patients with schizophrenia were categorized by the total duration of 
antipsychotic prescription after schizophrenia diagnosis into treated 
(n = 77,139) and untreated (n = 9784) groups. The main outcome was all-cause 
mortality; causes of death included cardiovascular disease, pulmonary disease, 
diabetes, cancer, accident, suicide and homicide.
RESULTS: The numbers of all-cause deaths and deaths from individual causes were 
significantly lower in the antipsychotic-treated group than in the untreated 
group (all cases, p < 10-4). When adjusted for covariates (age, sex, income, 
body mass index, alcohol consumption, hypertension, cancer and cerebral stroke), 
mortality rates due to ischemic heart disease (hazard ratio, HR, 0.38 [95% CI, 
0.18-0.77]) and stroke (HR, 0.39 [95% CI, 0.19-0.80]) were significantly lower 
in the antipsychotic-treated group. Among 4 atypical antipsychotics (olanzapine, 
risperidone, aripiprazole and quetiapine), only aripiprazole was associated with 
a decreased mortality risk relative to olanzapine (HR, 0.55 [95% CI, 
0.32-0.96]).
CONCLUSIONS: Schizophrenia patients constantly prescribed antipsychotics had 
significantly lower rates of death from certain cardiovascular illnesses than 
untreated patients. Aripiprazole-treated schizophrenia was associated with a 
decreased risk of death compared with olanzapine-treated disease.

INTRODUCTION: Colonic diverticulosis increases with age, leading to a higher 
risk of colonic diverticular bleeding (CDB) in the elderly. As life expectancy 
continues to increase, the need for endoscopic hemostasis for CDB in the elderly 
can also be expected to increase. However, there have been no reports to date on 
the feasibility of endoscopic hemostasis for elderly CDB patients. Several 
recent studies have addressed the effectiveness of endoscopic band ligation 
(EBL) for CDB. In this study, we evaluate the safety and effectiveness of EBL in 
elderly CDB patients compared to younger CDB patients.
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the medical records of consecutive patients 
treated with EBL for the first time at a tertiary referral center between March 
2011 and November 2017. Patients were grouped according to age into those at 
least 75 years old (the Elderly) and those <75 years old (the Nonelderly). 
Patient characteristics, technical success, and complications were compared 
between the two groups.
RESULTS: EBL was performed in 153 patients during the study period (49 Elderly 
patients and 104 Nonelderly patients). Elderly patients were less likely to be 
male (p < 0.001) and had lower hemoglobin levels on admission (p < 0.001). 
Bleeding on the right side of the splenic flexure was observed more frequently 
in the Nonelderly (p = 0.002). Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) and use of 
antithrombotic agents were significantly higher in the Elderly (p < 0.001 and p 
< 0.001, respectively). Active bleeding tended to be observed more frequently in 
the Elderly (p = 0.054), while the difference was not significant. There were no 
significant differences in the shock index, procedure time, or units of packed 
red blood cells transfused between the 2 groups. No significant differences in 
the technical success rate (97.1 vs. 98%, p = 0.76), early rebleeding rate (10.2 
vs. 14.4%, p = 0.47), or other complications (2 vs. 1%, p = 0.58) were observed. 
Perforation and abscess formation were not observed in either group. Female 
gender, left-sidedness, higher CCI, and lower hemoglobin level were all 
significantly more frequently observed in the Elderly on multiple logistic 
regression analysis.
DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: EBL may be similarly safe and effective for the treatment 
of CDB in the elderly as in the nonelderly.

Obesity, an epidemiological disorder, is related to various complications in 
both the developed and developing world. It epitomizes a crucial risk factor for 
health, decreasing productivity and life expectancy while increasing health care 
costs worldwide. Conventional therapies with synthetic drugs or bariatric 
surgery, associated with numerous side effects, recurrence, and surgical 
complexity, have been restricted in their use. Lifestyle changes and dietary 
restrictions are the proven methods for successful weight loss, although 
maintaining a strict lifestyle is a challenge. Multiple natural products have 
been explored for weight management with varied efficacy. The current review 
explores less explored natural herbs, their active constituents, and their 
mechanisms of action against obesity.

Future Approaches for Treating Chronic Myeloid Leukemia: CRISPR Therapy.

The constitutively active tyrosine-kinase BCR/ABL1 oncogene plays a key role in 
human chronic myeloid leukemia development and disease maintenance, and 
determines most of the features of this leukemia. For this reason, 
tyrosine-kinase inhibitors are the first-line treatment, offering most patients 
a life expectancy like that of an equivalent healthy person. However, since the 
oncogene stays intact, lifelong oral medication is essential, even though this 
triggers adverse effects in many patients. Furthermore, leukemic stem cells 
remain quiescent and resistance is observed in approximately 25% of patients. 
Thus, new therapeutic alternatives are still needed. In this scenario, the 
interruption/deletion of the oncogenic sequence might be an effective 
therapeutic option. The emergence of CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced 
short palindromic repeats) technology can offer a definitive treatment based on 
its capacity to induce a specific DNA double strand break. Besides, it has the 
advantage of providing complete and permanent oncogene knockout, while tyrosine 
kinase inhibitors (TKIs) only ensure that BCR-ABL1 oncoprotein is inactivated 
during treatment. CRISPR/Cas9 cuts DNA in a sequence-specific manner making it 
possible to turn oncogenes off in a way that was not previously feasible in 
humans. This review describes chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) disease and the 
main advances in the genome-editing field by which it may be treated in the 
future.

The aim of this case is to clarify the need to maintain the terminally ill 
oncological patients who have had a thrombotic event in the course of their 
underlying disease under antithrombotic therapy. This case addresses a 
63-year-old man with stage IV gastric antrum adenocarcinoma, completely 
bed-ridden and anticoagulated with subcutaneous enoxaparin for more than a year, 
following deep venous thrombosis of the left lower limb. After reviewing the 
literature, it was found that, for end-of-life patients, anticoagulation seems 
to have little benefit as the main objective is not the extension of life 
itself, but rather the preservation of the best quality of life through 
practices that are well established in the relief of suffering.

Publisher: O presente caso pretende clarificar qual a verdadeira necessidade de 
manter sob terapêutica anti-trombótica os doentes oncológicos terminais que 
tiveram um evento trombótico no decorrer da evolução da sua doença de base. O 
caso em questão aborda um doente de 63 anos com uma neoplasia do antro gástrico 
em estadio IV, totalmente acamado, hipocoagulado com enoxaparina subcutânea há 
mais de um ano, no seguimento de uma trombose venosa profunda no membro inferior 
esquerdo. Após revisão da literatura, constatou-se que em doentes em fim de 
vida, a anticoagulação parece ter pouco benefício, visto que o principal 
objetivo não é o prolongamento da vida, mas sim a preservação da melhor 
qualidade de vida possível através de práticas cuja evidência no alívio do 
sofrimento está bem documentada.

Breathlessness is among the most common and deteriorating symptoms in patients 
with advanced cancer, which may worsen towards the end of life. Breathlessness 
in patients with estimated life expectancy of weeks to days has unique clinical 
features: it tends to worsen rapidly over days to hours as death approaches 
often despite current symptom control measures. Breathlessness in patients 
during the last weeks to days of life can be called 'terminal breathlessness'. 
While evidence has accumulated for the management of breathlessness in patients 
with cancer who are not dying, such evidence may not be fully applied to 
terminal breathlessness. Only a few studies have investigated the best practice 
of terminal breathlessness in patients with cancer. In this paper, we summarise 
the current evidence for the management of terminal breathlessness, and propose 
future directions of clinical research.

PURPOSE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of endocrine therapy (ET), radiation 
therapy (XRT), and combination ET + XRT as post-surgical treatment for older 
women with early-stage breast cancer from the societal perspective.
METHODS: We constructed a Markov state-transition model consisting of three 
mutually exclusive health-states: Disease-Free, Recurrence, or Death. 
Osteoporotic fracture, radiation-induced breast fibrosis, and radiation 
pneumonitis were modeled as treatment-related adverse events (AEs). Cancer 
registry-linked-Medicare data were used to assess probability of recurrence and 
total costs, after propensity adjustment to account for treatment selection, 
among women aged >65 years diagnosed with estrogen receptor positive or 
progesterone receptor positive (ER+/PR+) breast cancer receiving ET, XRT, or 
ET + XRT in 2007-2011. Following randomized controlled trials, overall survival 
was assumed equivalent, but locoregional recurrence varied. Indirect costs and 
health-state utilities were literature-driven and varied in sensitivity 
analyses. Costs and outcomes were discounted at 3% annually.
RESULTS: In a cohort of 10,000 women over ten years, we estimated 1620 total 
recurrences in the ET-only group, 1296 in the XRT-only group, and 1076 with 
ET + XRT. Compared to ET-only, the base-case incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio (ICER) was $10,826 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY)-gained for 
XRT-only and $26,834/QALY-gained for ET + XRT. Similarities in cost and 
effectiveness between treatments led to highly sensitive results. We also 
present clinically-relevant patient preference scenarios for recurrence 
risk-averse patients and near-term AE risk-averse patients.
CONCLUSIONS: The cost-effectiveness of regimens including ET and/or XRT in older 
women with early-stage breast cancer is sensitive to small differences in costs, 
as well as risk of, and utilities associated with, locoregional recurrence, 
suggesting that patient preferences concerning treatment benefits and risks 
should be considered by physicians.
