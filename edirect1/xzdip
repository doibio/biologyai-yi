model simulated lifetime costs and outcomes for participants in breast cancer 
screening who were aged 40-74 years between 2012 and 2017. We analyzed rates of 
health care resource utilization, health state costs and estimated incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), to measure incremental cost differences per 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained from the addition of DBT to DM-based 
screening, from the government payer's perspective.
RESULTS: The model simulated economic outcomes for 112 249 screening 
participants. We found that the ICER was highly sensitive to recall rate 
reductions and insensitive to parameters related to cancer detection. If DBT 
plus DM can reduce absolute recall rates by more than 2.1%, the base-case 
scenario had an ICER of $17 149 per QALY. At a willingness-to-pay threshold of 
$100 000 per QALY, more than 95% of the probabilistic simulations favoured the 
adoption of DBT plus DM versus DM alone. The ICER depended heavily on the 
ability of DBT plus DM to reduce recall rates.
INTERPRETATION: The addition of DBT to DM would be considered cost-effective 
owing to the low positive predictive value of screening with DM alone. 
Reductions in false-positive recall rates should be monitored closely.

Striving to be faithful to the moral core of medicine and to spiritual, moral, 
and social teaching of the church, Catholic physicians see their role as an 
extension of the healing ministry of Jesus. When faced with a situation in which 
a large number of gravely ill people are seeking care, but optimal treatment 
such as ventilation in intensive care unit cannot be offered to all because of 
scarcity of resources, Catholic physicians recognize the need to consider the 
common good and to assign a priority to patients for whom such treatments would 
be most probably lifesaving. Making these evaluations, physicians will use only 
objective medical criteria regarding the benefits and risks to patients and will 
be mindful that all persons deserve equal respect for their dignity. 
Discrimination or prejudicial treatment against patients based on factors such 
as age, disability, race, gender, quality of life, and possible long-term 
survival cannot be morally justified. Triage process should incorporate respect 
for autonomy of both the patient and the professional and opportunity for an 
appeal of a triage decision. Other principles and values that will affect how a 
triage protocol is developed and applied are proportionality, equity, 
reciprocity, solidarity, subsidiarity, and transparency. The current coronavirus 
pandemic can provide valuable lessons and stimulus for reforms and renewal.
SUMMARY: Catholic physicians strive to continue the healing ministry of Jesus 
Christ and be faithful to the moral core of medicine. In situations such as 
pandemic, the scarcity of personnel and technological resources create serious 
challenges and even moral distress. Church teachings on dignity, the common good 
and protection of the vulnerable help guide decisions based on public medical 
criteria and shared decision-making.

This article reports test-retest reliability data of laboratory- and field-based 
performance tests as well as body composition analyses of younger and older 
Kosovan adults. In total, 57 healthy young (18-35 years) and 61 older (>60 
years) participants took part in two identical test sessions, with a median 
[25th - 75th percentile] of 14 [13-21] days in between. Functional performance 
tests included 30-s chair stand test (CST), 30-s arm curl test (ACT), 
six-minutes walking test (6MWT), sit and reach test, timed up and go test (TUG), 
as well as the assessment of gait speed (GS) at normal and fast pace. Isometric 
handgrip strength (HGS) was used to estimate strength of the dominant hand. 
Isokinetic peak torque (PT) and average power (AvgP) for knee extension and 
flexion were determined at velocities of 60°/s and 120°/s. Body composition 
assessments included body fat percentage, skeletal muscle mass (SMM) and index 
(SMI) as well as appendicular skeletal muscle mass (ASMM) and index. Secondary 
endpoints included self-perceived health status and potential co-morbidities. 
All performance test outcomes as well as body fat percentage, SMM, ASMM, and 
self-perceived health were significantly better in young as compared to older 
participants (p < 0.001). Improvements from test to retest were observed for CST 
(p < 0.001), PTflexion (60°/s: p = 0.001, 120°/s: p = 0.041), AvgPflexion 
(60°/s: p < 0.001, 120°/s: p < 0.001), AvgPextension (120°/s: p = 0.050), but 
also for SMM (p = 0.021) and SMI (p = 0.021). Only for CST and HGS a time x age 
group interaction was detected (p < 0.05). Acceptable reliability (ICC > 0.7) 
was observed for all parameters in both age groups, except for some of the 
measures from the isokinetic dynamometry, where ICCs were generally lower in 
older participants, but fell below 0.7 for AvgPflexion at 60°/s (ICC = 0.6) and 
at 120°/s (ICC = 0.67) as well as for PTflexion at 120°/s (ICC = 0.69). These 
data's importance lay upon their potential use in epidemiological studies 
observing muscle strength, peak torque, power, physical performance and body 
composition over various age groups, either in the same or similar populations, 
or for comparison to other populations.

STUDY OBJECTIVE: People with intellectual disabilities have a lower life 
expectancy and more frequent comorbidities than the general population and have 
unmet health needs. Insufficient medical care is suspected to be one reason, for 
which little data is available in Germany. The study therefore focuses on the 
question of how people with intellectual disabilities make use of medical care, 
including screening and preventive measures.
METHOD: In a cross-sectional study in 3 workshops for people with intellectual 
disabilities, the use of health care was surveyed by means of questionnaires 
from their relatives. The evaluation was carried out descriptively and by means 
of inferential statistics comparing participants with the general population as 
well as within the group of participants for socio-demographic differences.
RESULTS: Almost all 181 participants (participation rate 19.3%) had a family 
doctor. In comparison to the general population, the participants made more 
frequent use of the services of general practitioners and the care provided by 
numerous other specialist areas. They made less frequent use of screening for 
colon, breast, cervix and prostate and more frequent use for skin cancer and 
general check-up. Dental check-ups and preventive measures showed no difference. 
Participants living in institutional settings made more use of the regular 
services than those living with relatives or alone. Participants with a 
migration background were less aware of care services.
CONCLUSIONS: The results do not show any indications of a general undersupply of 
health care. Participation in cancer screening with more complex examinations 
should be encouraged, especially for people with mental disabilities living 
alone or with relatives. Those with a migration background and their families 
should be specifically informed.

Publisher: ZIEL DER STUDIE: Menschen mit geistiger Behinderung weisen eine 
geringere Lebenserwartung und häufigere Komorbidität als die 
Allgemeinbevölkerung sowie ungedeckte Gesundheitsbedarfe auf. Als ein Grund wird 
eine unzureichende medizinische Versorgung vermutet, wozu in Deutschland wenige 
Daten vorliegen. Die Studie widmet sich deshalb der Frage, wie Menschen mit 
geistiger Behinderung die medizinische Versorgung einschließlich Vorsorge und 
präventive Angebote in Anspruch nehmen.
METHODIK: Querschnittstudie in 3 Werkstätten für Menschen mit geistiger 
Behinderung. Von Angehörigen wurde die Inanspruchnahme der Gesundheitsversorgung 
per Fragebogen erhoben. Die Auswertung erfolgte deskriptiv und 
inferenzstatistisch im Vergleich zur Allgemeinbevölkerung sowie innerhalb der 
Teilnehmenden auf soziodemografische Unterschiede.
ERGEBNISSE: Fast alle 181 Teilnehmer (Teilnahmequote 19,3%) haben einen 
Hausarzt. Im Vergleich zur Allgemeinbevölkerung nehmen die Teilnehmer die 
hausärztliche und die Versorgung durch zahlreiche andere Facharztgebiete 
häufiger in Anspruch. Die Krebsvorsorge für Dickdarm, Brust, Gebärmutterhals und 
Prostata nehmen sie seltener, für Haut und den Check-up öfter in Anspruch. Bei 
Zahnarztkontrollen und Maßnahmen der Gesundheitsförderung zeigt sich kein 
Unterschied. Teilnehmer aus Wohnheimen nehmen die Regelangebote mehr in Anspruch 
als die bei Angehörigen oder alleine Lebenden. Teilnehmer mit 
Migrationshintergrund kennen die Versorgungsangebote weniger gut.
SCHLUSSFOLGERUNG: Hinweise auf eine generelle gesundheitliche Unterversorgung 
zeigen die Ergebnisse nicht. Die Teilnahme an der Krebsvorsorge mit 
aufwändigeren Untersuchungen sollte gefördert werden, insbesondere für die 
allein oder bei Angehörigen lebenden Menschen mit geistiger Behinderung; 
Menschen mit Migrationshintergrund und ihre Angehörigen sollten gezielt 
informiert werden.

BACKGROUND: Many older adults with severe dementia receive potentially 
life-extending treatments even when caregivers do not wish to prolong their life 
inappropriately.
OBJECTIVE: Explore factors that influence caregiver preferences for potentially 
life-extending treatments for older adults with severe dementia, and reasons for 
discordance between overall end-of-life care goal and treatment preferences.
DESIGN: Semi-structured in-depth interviews asking caregivers their overall 
end-of-life care goal for older adults and preferences for intravenous (IV) 
antibiotics, tube feeding and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).
PARTICIPANTS: A total of 26 caregivers of community-dwelling older adults with 
severe dementia in Singapore.
APPROACH: Reflexive thematic analysis.
RESULTS: Most caregivers' (77%) overall end-of-life care goal was 'no life 
extension'. Yet, 80% preferred IV antibiotics for a life-threatening infection, 
60% preferred tube feeding and 45% preferred CPR. Caregivers preferred these 
treatments because they (1) perceived letting go by withholding treatments as 
unethical, (2) felt they had no choice as they deferred to the health care 
provider, (3) wanted to alleviate suffering rather than extend life and (4) 
desired trying minimally invasive treatments that had the potential to be 
withdrawn. Themes explaining discordance were (1) feared regret about making the 
'wrong' decision, (2) considered treatments to address immediate needs even when 
long-term goal did not match providing that treatment and (3) anticipated 
disagreement with other family members on overall goal of care.
CONCLUSION: To reduce discordance between caregivers' overall end-of-life care 
goal and preferences for life-extending treatments, clinicians can use a shared 
decision-making approach involving discussions of both their overall end-of-life 
care goal and treatment preferences.

BACKGROUND: Increased incidence and life expectancy have resulted in a growing 
population of patients with metastatic breast cancer, and these patients 
experience high rates of morbidity and premature mortality. Increased physical 
activity (PA) is consistently associated with improved health and disease 
outcomes among early-stage survivors. However, there is a paucity of research on 
PA in patients with metastatic breast cancer, and existing PA interventions have 
exhibited low feasibility because of their focus on intense PA and/or 
requirement of on-site visits. Mobile health (mHealth)-based PA interventions 
may be particularly useful for patients with metastatic breast cancer because 
they allow for remote monitoring, which facilitates individual tailoring of PA 
recommendations to patients' abilities and may minimize participant burden. 
However, no studies have examined mHealth PA interventions in patients with 
metastatic breast cancer.
OBJECTIVE: We aim to address these critical research gaps by testing a highly 
tailored technology-based intervention to promote PA of any intensity (ie, 
light, moderate, or vigorous) by increasing daily steps in patients with 
metastatic breast cancer. The primary aim of this study is to test the 
feasibility and acceptability of the Fit2ThriveMB intervention. We will also 
examine outcome patterns suggesting the efficacy of Fit2ThriveMB on symptom 
burden, quality of life, and functional performance.
METHODS: The Fit2ThriveMB trial is a two-arm pilot randomized controlled trial 
that will compare the effects of a smartphone-delivered, home-based PA 
intervention and an attention-control education condition on PA and quality of 
life in low-active female patients with metastatic breast cancer. A subsample 
(n=25) will also complete functional performance measures. This innovative trial 
will recruit 50 participants who will be randomized into the study's 
intervention or control arm. The intervention will last 12 weeks. The 
Fit2ThriveMB intervention consists of a Fitbit, coaching calls, and the 
Fit2ThriveMB smartphone app that provides self-monitoring, a tailored 
goal-setting tool, real-time tailored feedback, app notifications, and a group 
message board. Assessments will occur at baseline and post intervention.
RESULTS: The Fit2ThriveMB study is ongoing. Data collection ended in February 
2021.
CONCLUSIONS: Data from this study will provide the preliminary effect sizes 
needed to assemble an intervention that is to be evaluated in a fully powered 
trial. In addition, these data will provide essential evidence to support the 
feasibility and acceptability of using a technology-based PA promotion 
intervention, a scalable strategy that could be easily integrated into care, 
among patients with metastatic breast cancer.

High-temperature events can influence insect population dynamics and could be 
especially important for predicting the potential spread and establishment of 
invasive insects. The interaction between temperature and environmental humidity 
on insect populations is not well understood but can be a key factor that 
determines habitat range and population size. The brown marmorated stink bug, 
Halyomorpha halys (Stål), is an invasive agricultural pest in the United States 
and Europe, which causes serious economic damage to a wide range of crops. This 
insect's range continues to expand. It has recently invaded the Central Valley 
of California, which has a hotter and drier climate compared with the Eastern 
United States where this insect is established. We investigated how 
high-temperature events and relative humidity would impact the survival and 
reproduction of H. halys. Using incubators and humidity chambers, we evaluated 
the impact of humidity and short-term (2 d) high-temperature exposure on the 
survival and development of H. halys eggs, nymphs, and adults. We found that 
high temperatures significantly reduced H. halys survival. The impact of 
humidity on H. halys survival was dependent on temperature and life stage. Low 
humidity decreased first-instar survival but not third- to fourth-instar 
survival. High humidity increased first instar survival but decreased third- to 
fourth-instar survival. Humidity did not influence adult or egg survival. We 
also found that high temperatures decreased H. halys reproduction. Our findings 
have important implications for understanding the invasive ecology of H. halys 
and may be used to improve models predicting H. halys range expansion.

BACKGROUND: There are few data on life expectancy gains among people living with 
HIV in low-income and middle-income settings where antiretroviral therapy (ART) 
is increasingly available. We aimed to analyse life expectancy trends from 2003 
to 2017 among people with HIV beginning treatment with ART within the Caribbean, 
central America, and South America.
METHODS: We did a multisite retrospective cohort study and included people with 
HIV who had started treatment with ART and were aged 16 years or older between 
Jan 1, 2003, and Dec 31, 2017, from Caribbean, Central and South America network 
for HIV epidemiology (CCASAnet) sites in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Haiti, 
Honduras, Mexico, and Peru, who contributed person-time data from the age of 20 
years until date of death, last contact, database closure, or Dec 31, 2017. We 
used the Chiang method of abridged life tables to estimate life expectancy at 
age 20 years for three eras (2003-08, 2009-12, and 2013-17) overall and by 
demographic and clinical characteristics at ART initiation. We used Poisson 
regression models to weight mortality rates to account for informative 
censoring.
FINDINGS: 30 688 people with HIV were included in the study; 17 491 (57·0%) were 
from the Haiti site and 13 197 (43·0%) were from all other sites. There were 
2637 deaths during the study period: 1470 in Haiti and 1167 in other sites. 
Crude and weighted mortality rates decreased among all age groups over calendar 
eras. From 2003-08 to 2013-17, overall life expectancy for people with HIV at 
age 20 years increased from 13·9 years (95% CI 12·5-15·2) to 61·2 years 
(59·0-63·4) in Haiti and from 31·0 years (29·3-32·8) to 69·5 years (67·2-71·8) 
in other sites. Life expectancies at the end of the study period were within 10 
years of those of the general population (69·9 years in Haiti and 78·0 years in 
all other sites in 2018). Disparities in life expectancy among people with HIV 
by sex or HIV transmission risk factor, CD4 cell count, level of education, and 
history of tuberculosis at or before ART initiation persisted across calendar 
eras.
INTERPRETATION: Life expectancy among people with HIV receiving ART has 
significantly improved in Latin America and the Caribbean. Persistent 
disparities in life expectancy among people with HIV by demographic and clinical 
factors at ART initiation highlight vulnerable populations in the region.

It is known that coordination between joint movements is crucial for the 
achievement of motor tasks and has been studied extensively. Especially, in 
sports biomechanics, researchers are interested in determining which joint 
movements are coordinated to achieve a motor task. However, this issue cannot be 
easily addressed with the methods employed in previous studies. Therefore, we 
aimed to propose a method for identifying joint coordination. Subsequently, we 
examined which joint movements were coordinated using accurate overhead 
throwing, which required reduction in vertical hand velocity variability. 
Fourteen baseball players participated by attempting throwing using a motion 
capture system. The index of coordination for each joint movement and the effect 
of deviation of one joint movement on vertical hand velocity were quantified. 
Our results showed that the shoulder internal/external rotation angle (θ1-IE) 
and the other joint movements or the shoulder horizontal flexion/extension 
angular velocity (ω1-FE) and the other joint movements were coordinated. These 
results could be explained by the fact that the effects of the deviation of the 
shoulder internal rotation angle (θ1-I) and shoulder horizontal flexion angular 
velocity (ω1-F) on vertical hand velocity were larger than those of the other 
joint movements. This meant that it was necessary to cancel the deviations of 
θ1-IE and ω1-FE by the other joint movements. These findings indicate that the 
method proposed in this study enables the identification of which joint 
movements are coordinated in multiple degrees of freedom.

BACKGROUND: The extent of pancreatic resection for intraductal papillary 
mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) remains an unresolved issue. The study aims at 
analyzing the prognostic impact of conservative surgery (CS) i.e. of 
pancreatoduodenectomy or distal pancreatectomy, versus total pancreatectomy 
(TP), for pancreatic IPMNs.
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed and compared data of patients who had 
undergone pancreatic resection for IPMNs at our center between November 2007 and 
April 2019. Patients were divided into two main groups based on the extent of 
surgery: TP-group and CS-group. Subsequently, the perioperative and the 
long-term outcomes were compared. Moreover, a sub-group analysis of patients 
with IPMN alone and patients with malignant IPMN, based on preoperative 
indications to surgery and post-operative histopathological findings, was also 
performed.
RESULTS: Fifty-three patients were included in the TP-group and 73 in the 
CS-group. In 50 (39.7%) cases the frozen section changed the pre-operative 
surgical planning, with an extension of the pancreatic resection, in 43 (34.1%) 
cases up to a total pancreatectomy. Twenty-six patients (20.6%) with low-grade 
dysplasia at the frozen section underwent CS, while twenty (15.8%) underwent TP. 
Comparing these two sub-groups no differences were found in surgical IPMN 
recurrence, nor progression. The rate of overall postoperative complications was 
56.6% in the TP-group and 57.5% in the CS-group (p = 0.940). Fifteen patients 
(20.5%) developed diabetes in the CS-group. None of the patients treated with CS 
developed a surgical IPMN recurrence or progression during the follow-up period. 
Comparing OS and DFS of the two groups, we did not find any statistically 
significant difference (p = 0.619 and 0.315).
CONCLUSION: A timely CS can be considered an appropriate and valid strategy in 
the surgical treatment of the majority of pancreatic IPMNs, as it can avoid the 
serious long-term metabolic consequences of TP in patients with a long-life 
expectancy. On the contrary, TP remains mandatory in case of PDAC or high-risk 
features involving the entire gland.

BACKGROUND: Multiple studies over the past 4 decades have shown the significant 
benefit of breast cancer screening (BCS) in reducing mortality rates from breast 
cancer (BC). However, significant debate exists about the role of BCS in this 
regard, with some studies also showing no benefit in terms of mortality along 
with issues such as overdiagnosis, health care utilisation costs, psychological 
distress or overtreatment. To date, no BCS study has focused on disability. 
Hence the aim of this study is to evaluate the relative contribution of BCS 
approaches to age-standardized mortality and disability-adjusted life years 
(DALYs) rates along with other related risk factors, from a country-level 
perspective.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study created a country-dataset by merging 
information from the Global Burden of Disease study regarding female 
age-standardized BC mortality, DALYs rates and other risk factors with the BCS 
programme availability at the national or regional level (versus no or only 
pilot such programme), BCS type (mammography, digital screening, breast 
self-examination and clinical breast examination) and other BCS-related 
information among 130 countries. Mixed-effect multilevel regression models were 
run to examine the associations of interest.
RESULTS: The most important factor predictive of lower mortality was the more 
advanced type of BCS programme availability [mammography: -4.16, 95% CI -6.76 to 
-1.55; digital mammography/ultrasound: -3.64, 95% CI -6.59 to -0.70] when 
compared with self- or clinical breast examinations. High levels of low-density 
lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) and smoking were also related to higher 
mortality and DALYs from BC. In terms of BC DALYs, BCS had a 21.9 to 22.3-fold 
increase in the magnitude of effect compared with that in terms of mortality. 
Data on mortality and DALYs in relation to BCS programmes were also calculated 
for high-, middle- and low-income countries.
CONCLUSIONS: These data further support the positive effects of BCS in relation 
to age-standardized BC mortality rates, and for the first time show the impact 
of BCS on DALYs too. Additional factors, such as diabetes, high levels of LDL-c 
or smoking seemed to be related to BC mortality and disability, and could be 
considered as additional components of possible interventions to be used 
alongside BCS to optimize the BCS benefit on patients.

OBJECTIVE: The rarity of colloid cysts in children makes it difficult to 
characterize this entity and offer meaningful advice on treatment. Infrequent 
case reports exist, but to date there has been no age-specific assessment. The 
purpose of this study was to define any differences between children and adults 
who are evaluated and treated for colloid cysts of the third ventricle.
METHODS: Patients with colloid cysts were reviewed and stratified by age. 
Individuals ≤ 18 years of age were defined as pediatric patients and those > 18 
years of age as adults. Clinical and radiographic data, treatment, and 
postoperative outcomes were compared between both groups. Bivariate analysis was 
conducted using the Fisher exact test for categorical variables and Mann-Whitney 
U-test for continuous variables.
RESULTS: Of 132 endoscopic resections (121 primary, 10 secondary, and 1 
tertiary) of a colloid cyst, 9 (6.8%) were performed in pediatric patients (mean 
age 14.1 years, range 9-18 years) and 123 (93.2%) were performed in adult 
patients (mean age 43.8 years, range 19-73 years). Cases were found incidentally 
more commonly in pediatric than adult patients (66.7% vs 37.4%, p > 0.05), and 
pediatric patients had lower rates of hydrocephalus than adult patients (11.1% 
vs 63.4%, p < 0.05). Acute decompensation at presentation was found in 8 adults 
(6.5%) but no children. Complete cyst removal (88.9% vs 90.2%, p > 0.05) and 
length of stay (1.6 days vs 2.9 days, p > 0.05) were not significantly different 
between the groups. Postoperative complications (6.5% in adults, 0% in children) 
and recurrence (2.4% in adults, 0% in children) were rare in both groups, and 
there were no treatment-related deaths. The mean postoperative radiological 
follow-up was longer in pediatric patients (45 months, range 4-89 months) than 
adults (44.1 months, range 1-171 months).
CONCLUSIONS: While differences exist between children and adults regarding 
colloid cyst presentation, these are in keeping with the predicted evolution of 
a slow-growing lesion. Consistent with this observation, children had lower 
rates of hydrocephalus and a smaller mean maximal cyst diameter. Contrary to the 
published literature, however, sudden deterioration was not observed in 
pediatric patients but occurred in adult patients. In this limited pediatric 
sample size, the authors have not recorded any postoperative complications or 
recurrences to date. These encouraging results with endoscopic removal may 
positively impact future decisions related to children given their protracted 
life expectancy and projected rates of progression.

BACKGROUND: This study aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a breast 
cancer screening programme that incorporates genetic testing using breast cancer 
associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), against the current biennial 
mammogram-only screening programme to aid in its implementation into the current 
programme in Singapore.
METHODS: A Markov model was used to compare the costs and health outcomes of the 
current screening programme, against a polygenic risk-tailored screening 
programme, which can advise a long-term screening strategy depending on the 
individual's polygenic risk. The model took the perspective of the healthcare 
system, with a time horizon of 40 years, following women from the age of 35 to 
74. Epidemiological and cost data were taken from Asian studies, and an annual 
discount rate of 3% was used. The model outcome was the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), calculated from the difference in costs per 
quality-adjusted life year (QALY). Scenarios with varying risk thresholds for 
each polygenic risk group were examined. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity 
analyses were performed to assess parameter uncertainty.
RESULTS: The ICER for a polygenic risk-tailored breast cancer screening 
programme, compared with the current biennial mammogram-only screening 
programme, was - 3713.80 SGD/QALY, with incremental costs < 0 and incremental 
effects > 0. The scenario analysis of different polygenic risk cutoffs showed 
that the ICERs remain negative, with all ICERs falling within the south-east 
quadrant of the cost-effectiveness plane, indicating that tailored screening is 
more cost effective than mammogram-only screening, with lower costs and higher 
QALYs to be gained. This suggests that a polygenic risk-tailored breast cancer 
screening programme is cost effective, entailing lower cost than the current 
mammogram-only programme, while causing no additional harm to women.
CONCLUSION: Results from this cost-effectiveness analysis show that polygenic 
risk-tailored screening is cost effective with an ICER of - 3713.80 SGD/QALY. 
Tailored screening remains cost effective even across varying percentile cutoffs 
for each risk group. While the results look promising for incorporating 
polygenic risk into the current breast cancer screening programme, further 
studies should be conducted to address various limitations.

BACKGROUND: Disability weights (DWs) are weight factors that reflect the 
severity of health states for estimates of disability-adjusted life years. A new 
set of global DWs was published for the Global Burden of Diseases and Injuries 
(GBD) 2013 study, which relied on sampling from various world regions, but 
included little data for countries in East Asia. This study aimed to measure DWs 
in Japan using comparable methods, and compare the results with previous 
estimates from the GBD 2013 DW study.
METHODS: We conducted a web-based survey in 2019 to estimate DWs for 231 health 
states for the Japanese population. The survey included five new health states 
but otherwise followed the method of the GBD DW measurement study. The survey 
consisted of 15 paired comparison (PC) questions and 3 population health 
equivalence questions (PHE) per respondent. We analyzed PC data using probit 
regression and rescaled results to DW units between 0 (equivalent to full 
health) and 1 (equivalent to death).
FINDINGS: We considered 37,318 nationally representative respondents. The values 
of the resulting DWs ranged from 0.707 (95% uncertainty interval (UI) 
0.527-0.842) for spinal cord injury at neck level (untreated) to 0.004 (UI 
0.001-0.009) for mild anemia. High correlation between Japanese DW and GBD 2013 
DW was observed, but there was considerable disagreement. Out of 226 comparable 
health states, 55 (24.3%) showed more than a factor-of-two difference, of which 
41 (74.6%) had a higher value in Japanese DW. Many of the health states with 
higher DW in the Japan study were injuries, including amputation and fracture, 
and hearing and vision loss, while mental, behavioral, and substance use 
disorders generally tended to be lower.
CONCLUSIONS: This study has created an empirical basis for assessment of 
Japanese DWs of health status. The findings from this study based on the 
Japanese population suggest that there might be contextual differences in rating 
the severity of health states compared to previous surveys conducted elsewhere.

INTRODUCTION: This study compared the outcome of knee arthrodesis versus hinged 
total knee arthroplasty (TKA) in patients suffering from periprosthetic joint 
infection (PJI).
METHODS: 104 patients with PJI were treated using a two-stage exchange of failed 
TKA. In case of non reconstructable bone loss or loss of extension mechanism, a 
modular intramedullary arthrodesis nail was used for reimplantation [Knee 
Arthrodesis Module (KAM); n = 52]. The control group was retrospectively matched 
treated using a hinged revision TKA [Rotating Hinge Knee (RHK); n = 52]. PJI 
remission rates, functional outcome (WOMAC; KSS) and quality of life (SF-12), as 
well as comorbidities and pain were evaluated.
RESULTS: Mean age was 72.5 years. Charlson Comorbidity Index was higher in the 
KAM group (3.3 vs. 2.8). PJI remission rate was 89.4% (88.5% vs. 90.4%, 
respectively). In case of reinfection, implant retention was mostly possible in 
the RHK group (7.7%), whereas amputations were mostly performed in the KAM group 
(9.6%). Significant pain reduction (VAS 7.9-2.8) was achieved in both groups. 
Walking distance was significantly reduced in the KAM groups versus the RHK 
group (504 vs. 1064 m). WOMAC and KSS function scores were significantly reduced 
in the KAM group (25 vs. 40 and 35 vs. 64). Only moderate reduction in quality 
of life in the KAM group was observed (SF-12 physical: 34 vs. 40; SF-12 mental: 
51 vs. 56) respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Arthrodesis using a modular intramedullary nail is an alternative 
for limb salvage, pain reduction, and preservation of quality of life and 
everyday mobility, when revision TKA is not an option. This study presents the 
largest number of case, comparing the outcome after performing an arthrodesis 
versus hinged TKA after septic failed TKA.

Nematodes of the genus Physaloptera are globally distributed and infect a 
multitude of hosts. Their life cycle involves orthopterans and coleopterans as 
intermediate hosts. The morphological characters alone are inadequate to detect 
and differentiate Physaloptera spp. from its congeners. Moreover, molecular 
studies are limited to compare them precisely. The present communication reports 
the first molecular phylogenetic characterization of feline Physaloptera spp. 
from India based on mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (COX1) and 
small subunit ribosomal DNA (18S rDNA). The nematodes were first isolated from 
the stomach of adult stray cats during necropsy examination. Based on the gross 
and microscopic characters, the worms were identified as P. praeputialis. 
Morphological identification was further confirmed through PCR targeting the 
barcode region of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (MT-COI) 
gene, using nematode-specific primers cocktail followed by species specific 
primers targeting partial COX1 and 18S rRNA genes. Generated sequences were 
submitted in NCBI GenBank (MW517846, MW410927, MW411349), and phylogenetic trees 
were constructed using the maximum likelihood method. When compared with other 
sequences of Physaloptera species across the globe, the present isolates showed 
85.6-97.7% and 97.3-99% nucleotide homology based on COX1 and 18S rRNA gene, 
respectively. BLASTn analysis revealed a strong identity to other Physaloptera 
spp., and the phylogenetic tree placed all Physaloptera spp. in the same 
cluster. This study again indicates the usefulness of molecular techniques to 
substantiate the identity of species that may lack adequate descriptions and 
impart new insight for the potentially overlooked significance of P. 
praeputialis infections in felines.
