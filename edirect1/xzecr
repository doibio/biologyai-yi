account for differences between males and females in cause-specific mortality 
rates. In urban areas with high levels of segregation, reducing inequities in 
ALE may be possible by dramatically reducing mortality rates from some causes.
CONTRIBUTION: This paper illustrates the state of inequities in ALE between NH 
Blacks and NH Whites in Chicago for the period just prior to the onset of the 
COVID-19 pandemic, using a well-established method of decomposing mortality 
differentials for sub-populations.

BACKGROUND: The scenario of the patient with neuropathies, which are related to 
urinary disorders, impacts the quality of life. Symptoms can lead to social 
isolation, impair activities of daily living, and shorten life expectancy. This 
study aims to make a practical and integrative review of current recommendations 
for the urogynecological approach of patients with neuropathy and urinary 
dysfunction.
METHODS: The authors searched for data on combinations of the terms "lower 
urinary tract symptoms" AND "neurogenic voiding dysfunction" from January 2012 
to January 2022 in the following scientific databases: PUBMED, MEDLINE, EMBASE, 
and The Cochrane Library.
INCLUSION CRITERIA: randomized clinical trials, protocols from specialized 
societies and articles before that period, and according to clinical relevance.
EXCLUSION CRITERIA: case series or reports, expert opinions not endorsed by 
medical societies in the area.
RESULTS: From the 25 studies mentioned, 09 studies were selected according to 
pre-established criteria and qualitative analysis of relevance. The authors add 
2 references for relevance in the area of ​​urogynecology and neurological 
diseases. According to the selected scientific references, the main neuropathies 
that can cause urinary dysfunction are CNS injuries such as stroke, spinal cord 
injury, meningomyelocele, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Ten steps below 
were compiled to facilitate the gynecological approach, according to the 
researched literature.
CONCLUSION: It is important for the medical assistant to pay close attention to 
careful anamnesis and post-emptying urinary residual volume. The treatment in 
general addresses greater fluid intake, maneuvers to favor bladder emptying, 
medications, and/or intermittent self-catheterization. The approach of a 
multidisciplinary team can make a difference in the patient's prognosis and 
quality of life.

PURPOSE: Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) and cardiac conduction disorders are 
pathologies with a rising prevalence due to increased life expectancy. Upper 
airway patency is affected by environmental factors that may be associated with 
seasonal periods. The ability to record the degree of nocturnal apnoea on a 
daily basis may provide a more accurate picture of seasonal variability.
METHODS: This study used an observational, cross-sectional design recruiting 
consecutive patients with Sorin/Livanova/Microport® pacemakers. The study 
assessed the seasonal influence on the daily degree of nocturnal apnoea over a 
minimum period of 180 days. The respiratory events were recorded using a 
pacemaker-integrated detection algorithm based on transthoracic impedance 
variation. A generalised linear repeated measure mixed model was used to study 
the seasonal effect.
RESULTS: A sample of 101 subjects with a mean of 227 valid nights was compiled. 
Summer was associated with higher RDI (respiratory disturbance index) values and 
winter with lower values. The mean daily RDI ratio in summer was 1.099 times 
higher than in winter.
CONCLUSIONS: Slight seasonal influences on the degree of nocturnal apnoea were 
detected through the daily observation of an unselected sample of pacemaker 
wearers. The degree of apnoea is higher in warmer months and lower in colder 
months.

OBJECTIVE: To analysize the temporal trends in the disease burden of major human 
parasitic diseases in China from 1990 to 2019, so as to provide the evidence for 
improving the parasitic disease control strategy in China.
METHODS: The disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) of malaria, intestinal 
nematode infections, schistosomiasis, food-borne trematodiases, cysticercosis 
and echinococcosis in China from 1990 to 2019 were captured from the Global 
Burden of Disease Study 2019 (GBD 2019), and age- and gender-specific DALYs of 
parasitic diseases were estimated. The temporal trends in DALYs of malaria, 
intestinal nematode infections, schistosomiasis, food-borne trematodiases, 
cysticercosis and echinococcosis were evaluated in China from 1990 to 2019 using 
average annual percent change (AAPC) with Joinpoint regression analysis.
RESULTS: The DALYs were 643 836.42 person-years due to food-borne trematodiases, 
156 853.03 person-years due to cysticercosis, 79 764.62 person-years due to 
schistosomiasis, 70 989.73 person-years due to intestinal nematode infections, 4 
258.61 person-years due to echinococcosis and 264.86 person-years due to malaria 
in China in 2019, respectively. The overall DALYs of six parasitic diseases were 
higher among men (546 441.93 person-years) than among women (409 525.33 
person-years), and were greater among adults at ages of 14 to 65 years (684 
780.84 person-years) than among children at 14 years and lower (35 437.38 
person-years) and the elderly at ages of 65 years and older (235 749.04 
person-years). During the period from 1990 to 2019, food-borne trematodiases 
were the leading cause of DALYs among the six parasitic diseases, and 
cysticercosis shifted from the fourth leading cause in 1990 to the second 
leading cause of DALYs in China in 2019, while intestinal nematode infections 
shifted from the second leading cause in 1990 to the fourth leading cause of 
DALYs in 2019. The DALYs of major human parasitic diseases appeared an overall 
tendency towards a decline in China from 1990 to 2019, with the fastest drop 
seen in DALYs due to malaria (AAPC = -19.6%, P = 0.003), followed by due to 
intestinal nematode infections (AAPC = -8.2%, P < 0.001) and schistosomiasis 
(AAPC = -3.1%, P < 0.001), and a slow decline was seen in the DALYs of 
food-borne trematodiases (AAPC = -1.0%, P < 0.001), while there were no 
significant decrease in the DALYs of echinococcosis (AAPC = -0.5%, P = 0.264) 
and the DALYs of cysticercosis appeared a tendency towards a rise (AAPC = 0.7%, 
P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: The disease burden of major human parasitic diseases appeared an 
overall tendency towards a decline in China from 1990 to 2019, with a high 
disease burden seen due to food-borne parasitic diseases, no remarkable 
reduction seen in echinococcosis, and a tendency towards a rise seen in 
cysticercosis. It is recommended to focus on echinococcosis control, and 
continue to consolidate the control achievements of other major human parasitic 
diseases in China; meanwhile, the surveillance and prevention of food-borne 
parasitic diseases should be reinforced.

The current increase of life expectancy is associated with the presence of 
endocrine diseases in the elderly. The management of hypopituitarism in this 
group of patients is a challenging task. A correct diagnosis, which represents 
an essential requisite for an appropriate medical treatment, can be difficult 
because of the physiological changes occurring in pituitary function with aging, 
which may lead to challenges in the interpretation of laboratory results. 
Furthermore, the treatment requires several careful considerations: the need to 
restore the hormonal physiology with replacement therapies must be balanced with 
the need to avoid the risks of the over-replacement, especially in the presence 
of concomitant cardiovascular and metabolic disease. Interactions with other 
drugs able to modify the absorption and/or the metabolism of hormonal 
replacement therapies should be considered, in particular for the treatment of 
hypoadrenalism and hypothyroidism. The most important challenges stem from the 
lack of specific studies focused on the management of hypopituitarism in older 
people.

Gerontologists have long shown interest in both longevity and quality of life 
during later life, but considerable debate has ensued as scholars sought to 
integrate the two. Drawing from research on the topics of exceptional longevity, 
successful aging, and active life expectancy, we propose the concept of dual 
functionality to examine how humans reach advanced ages while maintaining 
physical and cognitive function. Dual functionality refers to being free of both 
physical and cognitive impairment. The loss of dual functionality challenges 
social networks to respond to the functional loss and is a harbinger of 
additional losses. Evidence of change in the percent of the older population 
maintaining dual functionality would be helpful for evaluating public health 
policies to aid quality of life during later life. This article is based on the 
first author's Robert W. Kleemeier Award Lecture at The Gerontological Society 
of America 2022 Annual Scientific Meeting.

OBJECTIVES: To map the scope, methodological rigor, quality, and direction of 
associations between social determinants of health (SDoH) and extracorporeal 
membrane oxygenation (ECMO) utilization or outcomes.
DATA SOURCES: PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases 
were systematically searched for citations from January 2000 to January 2023, 
examining socioeconomic status (SES), race, ethnicity, hospital and ECMO program 
characteristics, transport, and geographic location (context) with utilization 
and outcomes (concept) in ECMO patients (population).
STUDY SELECTION: Methodology followed Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic 
Reviews and Meta-Analyses scoping review extension. Two reviewers independently 
evaluated abstracts and full text of identified publications. Exclusion criteria 
included non-English, unavailable, less than 40 patients, and periprocedural or 
mixed mechanical support.
DATA EXTRACTION: Content analysis used a standardized data extraction tool and 
inductive thematic analysis for author-proposed mediators of disparities. Risk 
of bias was assessed using the Quality in Prognosis Studies tool.
DATA SYNTHESIS: Of 8,214 citations screened, 219 studies were identified. 
Primary analysis focuses on 148 (68%) including race/ethnicity/SES/payer 
variables including investigation of ECMO outcomes 114 (77%) and utilization 43 
(29%). SDoH were the primary predictor in 15 (10%). Overall quality and 
methodologic rigor was poor with advanced statistics in 7%. Direction of 
associations between ECMO outcomes or utilization according to race, ethnicity, 
SES, or payer varied. In 38% adverse outcomes or lower use was reported in 
underrepresented, under-resourced or diverse populations, while improved 
outcomes or greater use were observed in these populations in 7%, and 55% had no 
statistically significant result. Only 26 studies (18%) discussed mechanistic 
drivers of disparities, primarily focusing on individual- and hospital-level 
rather than systemic/structural factors.
CONCLUSIONS: Associations between ECMO utilization and outcomes with SDoH are 
inconsistent, complicated by population heterogeneity and analytic shortcomings 
with limited consideration of systemic contributors. Findings and research gaps 
have implications for measuring, analyzing, and interpreting SDoH in ECMO 
research and healthcare.

BACKGROUND: Intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) is a therapeutic de-escalation 
option in older women with low-risk early breast cancer (EBC). A qualitative 
study was implemented to describe EBC physicians' points of view on IORT as a 
de-escalation option.
METHODS: Recorded face-to-face and telephone semi-structured interviews were 
conducted among diverse physicians from seven French comprehensive cancer 
centers. Interview transcripts were grouped as corpus to construct a typology. 
Thematic analysis was performed.
RESULTS: Positions toward IORT were contrasted between the 16 participating 
physicians. Five fully supported IORT as a de-escalation option, four were not 
in favor, and seven had a more reserved or neutral opinion. Points of divergence 
concerned treatment efficacy, treatment duration, side effects and sequelae, 
psychological impact, compliance with adjuvant endocrine therapy, logistical 
constraints, financial cost, and availability of other techniques of partial 
breast irradiation. Physicians in favor of IORT emphasized direct benefits for 
the patient, and those against pointed the lack of specific guidelines, risk of 
lost opportunity in older women with long life expectancy, and challenges of 
shared decision making.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite national policies to preserve cancer patients' quality of 
life and increase their participation in medical decision making, therapeutic 
de-escalation using IORT is not consensual among physicians. Further efforts are 
needed to promote patient-centered care.

Brown marmorated stink bug, Halyomorpha halys (Stål) (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae), 
is a generalist pest that causes serious injury to a variety of crops around the 
world. After the first detection in the USA, H. halys became a serious threat to 
growers resulting in significant crop damage. Understanding the effect of 
temperature on H. halys development will help to achieve successful control by 
predicting the phenological timing of the pest. Here, life table parameters 
(survival, development, reproduction, and daily mortality) of H. halys were 
evaluated for New Jersey and Oregon populations in the US. Parameters were 
determined from field-collected and laboratory-reared individuals. The results 
indicated that New Jersey populations had higher levels of egg-laying than 
Oregon populations and exhibited higher and earlier fecundity peaks. Survival 
levels were similar between populations. Linear and nonlinear fit were used to 
estimate the minimum (14.3 °C), optimal (27.8 °C), and maximum (35.9 °C) 
temperatures where development of H. halys can take place. An age-specific 
fecundity peak (Mx = 36.63) was recorded at 936 degree days for New Jersey 
populations, while maximum fecundity (Mx = 11.85) occurred at 1145 degree days 
in Oregon. No oviposition was recorded at the lowest (15 °C) or highest (35 °C) 
trialed temperatures. Developmental periods increased at temperatures above 30 
°C, indicating that such higher temperatures are suboptimal for H. halys 
development. Altogether the most optimal temperatures for population increase 
(rm) ranged from 25 to 30 °C. Survival rates of H. halys at suboptimal low 
temperatures of 8 °C (i.e., 61%) is comparable to previous reports. The present 
paper provides additional data and context from a range of experimental 
conditions and populations. Such temperature-related H. halys life table 
parameters can be used to provide determine the risk to susceptible crops.

The expansion of augmented reality across society, its availability in mobile 
platforms and the novelty character it embodies by appearing in a growing number 
of areas, have raised new questions related to people's predisposition to use 
this technology in their daily life. Acceptance models, which have been updated 
following technological breakthroughs and society changes, are known to be great 
tools for predicting the intention to use a new technological system. This paper 
proposes a new acceptance model aiming to ascertain the intention to use 
augmented reality technology in heritage sites-the Augmented Reality Acceptance 
Model (ARAM). ARAM relies on the use of the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use 
of Technology model (UTAUT) model's constructs, namely performance expectancy, 
effort expectancy, social influence, and facilitating conditions, to which the 
new and adapted constructs of trust expectancy, technological innovation, 
computer anxiety and hedonic motivation are added. This model was validated with 
data gathered from 528 participants. Results confirm ARAM as a reliable tool to 
determine the acceptance of augmented reality technology for usage in cultural 
heritage sites. The direct impact of performance expectancy, facilitating 
conditions and hedonic motivation is validated as having a positive influence on 
behavioural intention. Trust expectancy and technological innovation are 
demonstrated to have a positive influence on performance expectancy whereas 
hedonic motivation is negatively influenced by effort expectancy and by computer 
anxiety. The research, thus, supports ARAM as a suitable model to ascertain the 
behavioural intention to use augmented reality in new areas of activity.

Vision under natural conditions could be studied by combining 
electroencephalogram (EEG) and eye tracking as well as using saccades as 
triggers for the onset of the fixation-related potentials (FRPs) and for the 
oculomotor inhibition (OMI) that follows every saccade. The result of this 
analysis is thought to be equivalent to the event-related response following a 
peripheral preview. Previous studies that measured responses to visual deviants 
in a sequence of flashed stimuli found an increased negativity in the occipital 
N1 component (visual mismatch negativity [vMMN]), and prolonged saccadic 
inhibition for unexpected events. The aim of the current study was to develop an 
oddball paradigm in constrained natural-viewing and determine whether a similar 
mismatched FRP and prolonged OMI for deviance could be found. To this end, we 
developed a visual oddball paradigm on a static display to generate expectancy 
and surprise across successive saccades. Observers (n = 26) inspected, one after 
the other, seven small patterns of E and an inverted E arranged on the screen 
along a horizontal path, with one frequent (standard) and one rare (deviant), 
looking for a superimposed tiny dot target in each 5-second trial. Our results 
show a significantly larger FRP-N1 negativity for the deviant, compared with the 
standard and prolonged OMI of the following saccade, as previously found for 
transient oddballs. Our results show, for the first time, prolonged OMI and 
stronger fixation-related N1 to a task-irrelevant visual mismatch (vMMN) in 
natural, but task-guided viewing. These two signals combined could serve as 
markers of prediction error in free viewing.

PURPOSE: With prolonged life expectancy and advancements in prosthetic designs, 
the proportion of patients belonging to diverse age groups undergoing total hip 
arthroplasty (THA) has progressively increased. In this context, the details 
regarding risk factors associated with mortality after THA, and its prevalence 
need to be clearly understood. This study sought to identify the possible 
co-morbidities associated with post-THA mortality.
METHODS: Based on Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) database, patients 
undergoing THA from 2016 to 2019 (using ICD-10CMP) were identified. The included 
cohort was stratified into two groups: "early mortality" and "no mortality" 
groups. The data regarding patients' demographics, co-morbidities, and 
associated complications were compared between the groups.
RESULTS: Overall, 337,249 patients underwent THA, among whom, 332 (0.1%) died 
during their hospital admission ("early mortality" group). The remaining 
patients were included under "no mortality" group (336,917 patients). There was 
significantly higher mortality in the patients, who underwent emergent THA (as 
compared with elective THA: odd's ratio 0.075; p < 0.001). Based on multivariate 
analysis, presence of liver cirrhosis, chronic kidney disease (CKD) and previous 
history of organ transplant increased the odds of mortality {odds ratio [Exp 
(B)]} after THA by 4.66- (p < 0.001), 2.37-fold (p < 0.001) and 1.91-fold 
(p = 0.04), respectively. Among post-THA complications, acute renal failure 
(ARF), pulmonary embolism (PE), pneumonia, myocardial infarction (MI), and 
prosthetic dislocation increased the odds of post-THA mortality by 20.64-fold 
(p < 0.001), 19.35-fold (p < 0.001), 8.21-fold (p < 0.001), 2.71-fold (p = 0.05) 
and 2.54-fold (p < 0.001), respectively.
CONCLUSION: THA is a safe surgery with low mortality rate during early 
post-operative period. Cirrhosis, CKD, and previous history of organ transplant 
were the most common co-morbidities associated with post-THA mortality. Among 
post-operative complications, ARF, PE, pneumonia, MI, and prosthetic dislocation 
substantially enhanced the odds of post-THA mortality.

BACKGROUND: Transportation is essential for people of all ages and backgrounds 
to live a fulfilling and satisfying life. Public transport (PT) can facilitate 
access to the community and improve social participation. However, people with 
disabilities may encounter barriers or facilitators in the whole travel chain 
that can lead to negative or positive perceptions in terms of self-efficacy or 
satisfaction. These barriers may be perceived depending on the nature of the 
disability. Few studies have identified PT barriers and facilitators experienced 
by people with disabilities. However, findings were focused mainly on specific 
disabilities. Access requires broader considerations of barriers and 
facilitators for various types of disabilities.
OBJECTIVE: This scoping review aims to describe the barriers and facilitators to 
the use of PT experienced by people with various disabilities in the whole 
travel chain and to explore perceived experiences, self-efficacy, and 
satisfaction when using PT.
METHODS: A scoping review will be conducted using Arksey and O'Malley's 
framework and the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews 
and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews) checklist. The literature 
search will be conducted using the electronic databases MEDLINE, Transport 
Database, and PsycINFO via Ovid platform, Embase, and Web of Science from 1995 
to 2022. Two reviewers will independently identify studies based on inclusion 
(published in English or French, outcomes on PT accessibility for people with 
disabilities, peer-reviewed or guideline reports or editorials) and exclusion 
(no full text, focused on a technology system, outcome validation study, study 
on no-fixed route PT accessibility, etc) criteria and extract the data. When a 
study has addressed the accessibility of multiple modes of PT, including 
fixed-route PT, it will be retained. However, only data on fixed-route PT will 
be extracted. Any related systematic reviews identified through the search will 
be retained, and the reference lists will be hand-searched and screened for 
inclusion criteria.
RESULTS: The search we performed on July 21, 2022, in the databases mentioned 
above allowed us to retrieve 6399 citations. Of these citations, 31 articles 
were identified, and data extraction was performed. As of March 11, 2023, we 
have started data analysis. The findings will be synthesized narratively to 
summarize the barriers and facilitators to PT, perceived experiences with PT, 
self-efficacy for using PT, and satisfaction with PT according to the Human 
Development Model-Disability Creation Process conceptual framework.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of this scoping review could lead to a better 
understanding of the potential barriers and facilitators to the use of PT by 
people with various types of disabilities and how negative or positive 
experiences throughout the travel may influence their self-efficacy and 
satisfaction. The results may be used to provide recommendations to PT providers 
and policy makers to work together to make PT accessible, usable, and inclusive 
for all people with disabilities.

OBJECTIVES: We aimed to provide the most updated estimates on the global burden 
of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) to improve management strategies.
DESIGN: We extracted data from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2019 database 
to evaluate IBD burden with different measures in 204 countries and territories 
from 1990 to 2019.
SETTING: Studies from the GBD 2019 database generated by 
population-representative data sources identified through a literature review 
and research collaborations were included.
PARTICIPANTS: Patients with an IBD diagnosis.
OUTCOMES: Total numbers, age-standardised rates of prevalence, mortality and 
disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), and their estimated annual percentage 
changes (EAPCs) were the main outcomes.
RESULTS: In 2019, there were approximately 4.9 million cases of IBD worldwide, 
with China and the USA having the highest number of cases (911 405 and 762 890 
(66.9 and 245.3 cases per 100 000 people, respectively)). Between 1990 and 2019, 
the global age-standardised rates of prevalence, deaths and DALYs decreased 
(EAPCs=-0.66,-0.69 and -1.04, respectively). However, the age-standardised 
prevalence rate increased in 13 out of 21 GBD regions. A total of 147 out of 204 
countries or territories experienced an increase in the age-standardised 
prevalence rate. From 1990 to 2019, IBD prevalent cases, deaths and DALYs were 
higher among females than among males. A higher Socio-demographic Index was 
associated with higher age-standardised prevalence rates.
CONCLUSIONS: IBD will continue to be a major public health burden due to 
increasing numbers of prevalent cases, deaths and DALYs. The epidemiological 
trends and disease burden of IBD have changed dramatically at the regional and 
national levels, so understanding these changes would be beneficial for policy 
makers to tackle IBD.

Vaccination is one of the most effective, broad-reach, and cost-effective public 
health initiatives to fight against infectious diseases. From the perspective of 
population medicine, this article systematically elaborates on the value of 
vaccines in preventing infections, reducing disease incidence, decreasing 
disability and severe cases, lowering mortality rates, improving population 
health and life expectancy, reducing antibiotic use and resistance, as well as 
promoting fairness in public health services. Based on the current situation, 
the following recommendations are proposed: first, strengthen scientific 
research to provide a solid foundation for related policy-making; second, 
increase the coverage rate of non-national immunization program vaccines; third, 
promote the inclusion of more appropriate vaccines in the national immunization 
program; fourth, strengthen the research and development of new vaccines; and 
fifth, increase talent training in the field of vaccinology.

PURPOSE: Spiritual well-being is a critical element of individuals' quality of 
life and is overestimated by healthcare providers. A body of evidence is 
conducted on the spiritual well-being of cancer patients, but few on 
gastrointestinal (GI) cancer patients, which constitute a great proportion of 
the cancer burden. This study aimed to investigate the spiritual well-being of 
GI cancer patients and its association with hope and meaning in life.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted. A total of 237 GI cancer 
patients were recruited in this study by convenience sampling in 2022. All the 
participants completed the sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, 
Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Spiritual Wellbeing, Herth Hope 
Index, and Meaning in Life Questionnaire. Multiple linear regression analysis 
was conducted to explore the associated factors with spiritual well-being.
RESULTS: The GI cancer patients experience a relatively low level of spiritual 
well-being (mean = 31.54, SD = 9.84). The presence of meaning (B = 0.847, 95% CI 
[0.640, 1.054], p < 0.001), inner positive readiness and expectancy (B = 1.033, 
95% CI [0.548, 1.518], p < 0.001), residence (B = 2.828, 95% CI [1.045, 4.612], 
p = 0.002), and search for meaning (B = 0.247, 95% CI [0.072, 0.422], p = 0.006) 
were associated with the spiritual well-being of GI cancer patients. These four 
associated variables accounted for 57.8% of the variance in spiritual well-being 
(F = 81.969, p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: The spiritual well-being of GI cancer patients was relatively low 
and associated with the presence of meaning, inner positive readiness and 
expectancy, residence, and search for meaning. Healthcare professionals may 
consider improving GI patients' spiritual well-being by enhancing their sense of 
meaning in life and inner positive readiness and expectancy.

INTRODUCTION: For effective preventive strategies against GORD 
(gastro-esophageal reflux disease), we assessed the GORD burden from 1990 to 
2019.
METHODS: The burden of GORD between 1990 and 2019 was evaluated globally, 
regionally, and nationally. Using ASIR (age-standardized incidence), ASYLDs 
(age-standardized years lived with disabilitys), we compared them to the GBD 
world population per 100,000. The estimates were based on 95% uncertainty 
intervals (UIs). The AAPC (average annual percent change) in incidence, YLDs, 
along with prevalence rates with associated 95% CIs were estimated.
RESULTS: Data to estimate the burden of GORD are scarce till now. The global 
ASIR of GORD in 2019 was 3792.79 per 100,000, an increase AAPC of 0.112% from 
1990. The prevalence of GORD increased with a AAPC of 0.096% to 9574.45 per 
100,000. Global ASYLDs in 2019 was 73.63, an increase AAPC of 0.105% from 1990. 
The GORD burden varies greatly depending on the development level and 
geographical location. USA demonstrated the most obvious decreasing trend in 
burden of GORD, while Sweden had an increasing trend. That the increase in GORD 
YLDs was mediated primarily by the growth and aging of population, was revealed 
by decomposition analyses. There was an inverse relationship between SDI 
(socio-demographic index) and GORD-burden. Frontier analyses revealed 
significant scope of improvement in the status of development at all levels.
CONCLUSION: GORD is a public health challenge, especially in Latin America. Some 
SDI quintiles had declining rates, while some countries experienced increased 
rates. Thus, resources should be allocated for preventative measures based on 
country-specific estimates.

BACKGROUND: South Africa had an estimated 7.5 million people living with HIV 
(PLHIV), accounting for approximately 20% of the 38.4 million PLHIV globally in 
2021. In 2015, the World Health Organization recommended the universal test and 
treat (UTT) intervention which was implemented in South Africa in September 
2016. Evidence shows that UTT implementation faces challenges in terms of human 
resources capacity or infrastructure. We aim to explore healthcare providers 
(HCPs)' perspectives on the implementation of the UTT strategy in uThukela 
District Municipality in KwaZulu-Natal province.
METHODS: A qualitative study was conducted with one hundred and sixty-one (161) 
healthcare providers (HCPs) within 18 healthcare facilities in three 
subdistricts, comprising of Managers, Nurses, and Lay workers. HCPs were 
interviewed using an open ended-survey questions to explore their perceptions 
providing HIV care under the UTT strategy. All interviews were thematically 
analysed using both inductive and deductive approaches.
RESULTS: Of the 161 participants (142 female and 19 male), 158 (98%) worked at 
the facility level, of which 82 (51%) were nurses, and 20 (12.5%) were managers 
(facility managers and PHC manager/supervisors). Despite a general acceptance of 
the UTT policy implementation, HCPs expressed challenges such as increased 
patient defaulter rates, increased work overload, caused by the increased number 
of service users, and physiological and psychological impacts. The surge in the 
workload under conditions of inadequate systems' capacity and human resources, 
gave rise to a greater burden on HCPs in this study. However, increased life 
expectancy, good quality of life, and immediate treatment initiation were 
identified as perceived positive outcomes of UTT on service users. Perceived 
influence of UTT on the health system included, increased number of patients 
initiated, decreased burden on the system, meeting the 90-90-90 targets, and 
financial aspects.
CONCLUSION: Health system strengthening such as providing more systems' capacity 
for expected increase in workload, proper training and retraining of HCPs with 
new policies in the management of patient readiness for lifelong ART journey, 
and ensuring availability of medicines, may reduce strain on HCPs, thus 
improving the delivery of the comprehensive UTT services to PLHIV.

BACKGROUND: A preponderance of evidence suggests that higher income inequality 
is associated with poorer population health, yet recent research suggests that 
this association may vary based on other social determinants, such as 
socioeconomic status (SES) and other geographic factors, such as rural-urban 
status. The objective of this empirical study was to assess the potential for 
SES and rural-urban status to moderate the association between income inequality 
and life expectancy (LE) at the census-tract level.
METHODS: Census-tract LE values for 2010-2015 were abstracted from the US 
Small-area Life Expectancy Estimates Project and linked by census tract to Gini 
index, a summary measure of income inequality, median household income, and 
population density for all US census tracts with non-zero populations 
(n = 66,857). Partial correlation and multivariable linear regression modeling 
was used to examine the association between Gini index and LE using 
stratification by median household income and interaction terms to assess 
statistical significance.
RESULTS: In the four lowest quintiles of income in the four most rural quintiles 
of census tracts, the associations between LE and Gini index were significant 
and negative (p between < 0.001 and 0.021). In contrast, the associations 
between LE and Gini index were significant and positive for the census tracts in 
the highest income quintiles, regardless of rural-urban status.
CONCLUSION: The magnitude and direction of the association between income 
inequality and population health depend upon area-level income and, to a lesser 
extent, on rural-urban status. The rationale behind these unexpected findings 
remains unclear. Further research is needed to understand the mechanisms driving 
these patterns.
