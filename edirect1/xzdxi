BACKGROUND: Although the short-term benefit of primary percutaneous coronary 
intervention (PCI) in elderly patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction 
(STEMI) has been demonstrated, the final long-term survival benefit is as yet 
unknown.
AIM: To assess the final survival benefit of primary PCI as compared to 
thrombolytic therapy in patients over 75 years of age.
METHODS: Patients > 75 years with STEMI were randomised to either primary PCI or 
thrombolysis. Long-term data on survival were available for all patients.
RESULTS: A total of 46 patients were randomised to primary PCI, 41 to 
thrombolysis. There were no significant differences in baseline variables. After 
a maximum of 20 years' follow-up, all patients had passed away. The patients 
randomised to thrombolysis died after a mean follow-up duration of 5.2 years (SD 
4.9) compared to 6.7 years (SD 4.8) in patients randomised to primary PCI 
(p = 0.15). Thus, the mean final survival benefit of primary PCI was 1.5 years.
CONCLUSION: The final survival benefit of primary PCI as compared to 
thrombolysis in elderly patients with STEMI is 1.5 years and their life 
expectancy increases by 28.8%.

As college science educators, we must prepare all future college graduates to be 
engaged, science-literate citizens. Yet data suggest that most college biology 
classes as currently taught do little to make science truly useful for students' 
lives and provide few opportunities for students to practice skills needed to be 
key decision makers in their communities. This is especially important for our 
non-science majors, as they represent the vast majority (82%) of college 
students. In this essay, we identify three critical aspects of useful college 
science education to prepare science literate non-science majors: prioritize 
local socioscientific issues; highlight communal opportunities in science that 
impact students' communities; and provide students with opportunities to 
practice skills necessary to engage with science beyond the classroom.

Manual scavenging and the right to health in India - social and medicolegal 
perspectives.

Manual scavenging in India refers to the manual removal of human excreta from 
private dwellings and facilities maintained by municipal authorities. Human 
waste is collected from public streets and pit latrines, sewers and gutters, and 
septic tanks with bare hands, brooms or metal scrapers, placed into woven 
baskets or buckets, and then carried to disposal sites. The work is generally 
restricted to those occupying the lowest levels of the Indian caste system. 
Manual scavengers suffer from considerable societal disadvantages in addition to 
increased morbidity and mortality, associated with drowning in sewage, and to 
exposure to asphyxiating gases and to a wide variety of local and systemic 
infectious diseases. Life expectancy is shortened. Despite the passage of 
various national laws and periodic intervention by the courts, the 
'dehumanising' practice of manual scavenging continues. In 2021 the National 
Human Rights Commission stated that claims that there are no manual scavengers 
in particular states in India are simply untrue.

Does Democracy Matter for Public Health?

Author information:
(1)Department of Economics, 34949Hannam University, Daejeon, Republic of Korea.

This study examines the effect of democracy on public health by using panel data 
of 188 countries over the period 1972-2019. We use various regression methods, 
such as pooled ordinary least squares, fixed effects, dynamic generalized method 
of moments (GMM), a split-sample method, and a quadratic model to address 
econometric issues. The pooled regression supports the positive effect on 
health, but it does not exist in low-income countries, which can be explained by 
the threshold effect. The fixed effects regression confirms the positive impact 
on infant mortality but not on life expectancy, which illustrates the historical 
and cumulative effect of democracy on life expectancy. The non-linear regression 
finds a U-shaped relationship between democracy and infant mortality, which is 
consistent with the fixed effects regression result of the positive effect on 
mortality in the low-income group. The dynamic GMM regression shows the expected 
strong relationship between previous health and current health status. Overall, 
the regression analysis supports the positive effect of democracy on public 
health.

BACKGROUND: Metamodels can address some of the limitations of complex simulation 
models by formulating a mathematical relationship between input parameters and 
simulation model outcomes. Our objective was to develop and compare the 
performance of a machine learning (ML)-based metamodel against a conventional 
metamodeling approach in replicating the findings of a complex simulation model.
METHODS: We constructed 3 ML-based metamodels using random forest, support 
vector regression, and artificial neural networks and a linear regression-based 
metamodel from a previously validated microsimulation model of the natural 
history hepatitis C virus (HCV) consisting of 40 input parameters. Outcomes of 
interest included societal costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), the 
incremental cost-effectiveness (ICER) of HCV treatment versus no treatment, 
cost-effectiveness analysis curve (CEAC), and expected value of perfect 
information (EVPI). We evaluated metamodel performance using root mean squared 
error (RMSE) and Pearson's R2 on the normalized data.
RESULTS: The R2 values for the linear regression metamodel for QALYs without 
treatment, QALYs with treatment, societal cost without treatment, societal cost 
with treatment, and ICER were 0.92, 0.98, 0.85, 0.92, and 0.60, respectively. 
The corresponding R2 values for our ML-based metamodels were 0.96, 0.97, 0.90, 
0.95, and 0.49 for support vector regression; 0.99, 0.83, 0.99, 0.99, and 0.82 
for artificial neural network; and 0.99, 0.99, 0.99, 0.99, and 0.98 for random 
forest. Similar trends were observed for RMSE. The CEAC and EVPI curves produced 
by the random forest metamodel matched the results of the simulation output more 
closely than the linear regression metamodel.
CONCLUSIONS: ML-based metamodels generally outperformed traditional linear 
regression metamodels at replicating results from complex simulation models, 
with random forest metamodels performing best.
HIGHLIGHTS: Decision-analytic models are frequently used by policy makers and 
other stakeholders to assess the impact of new medical technologies and 
interventions. However, complex models can impose limitations on conducting 
probabilistic sensitivity analysis and value-of-information analysis, and may 
not be suitable for developing online decision-support tools.Metamodels, which 
accurately formulate a mathematical relationship between input parameters and 
model outcomes, can replicate complex simulation models and address the above 
limitation.The machine learning-based random forest model can outperform linear 
regression in replicating the findings of a complex simulation model. Such a 
metamodel can be used for conducting cost-effectiveness and value-of-information 
analyses or developing online decision support tools.

Comment in
    Lancet Diabetes Endocrinol. 2022 Oct;10(10):688-689.

BACKGROUND: Accurate data on type 1 diabetes prevalence, incidence, associated 
mortality and life expectancy are crucial to inform public health policy, but 
these data are scarce. We therefore developed a model based on available data to 
estimate these values for 201 countries for the year 2021 and estimate the 
projected prevalent cases in 2040.
METHODS: We fitted a discrete-time illness-death model (Markov model) to data on 
type 1 diabetes incidence and type 1 diabetes-associated mortality to produce 
type 1 diabetes prevalence, incidence, associated mortality and life expectancy 
in all countries. Type 1 diabetes incidence and mortality data were available 
from 97 and 37 countries respectively. Diagnosis rates were estimated using data 
from an expert survey. Mortality was modelled using random-forest regression of 
published type 1 diabetes mortality data, and life expectancy was calculated 
accordingly using life tables. Estimates were validated against observed 
prevalence data for 15 countries. We also estimated missing prevalence (the 
number of additional people who would be alive with type 1 diabetes if their 
mortality matched general population rates).
FINDINGS: In 2021, there were about 8·4 (95% uncertainty interval 8·1-8·8) 
million individuals worldwide with type 1 diabetes: of these 1·5 million (18%) 
were younger than 20 years, 5·4 million (64%) were aged 20-59 years, and 1·6 
million (19%) were aged 60 years or older. In that year there were 0·5 million 
new cases diagnosed (median age of onset 39 years), about 35 000 non-diagnosed 
individuals died within 12 months of symptomatic onset. One fifth (1·8 million) 
of individuals with type 1 diabetes were in low-income and lower-middle-income 
countries. Remaining life expectancy of a 10-year-old diagnosed with type 1 
diabetes in 2021 ranged from a mean of 13 years in low-income countries to 65 
years in high-income countries. Missing prevalent cases in 2021 were estimated 
at 3·7 million. In 2040, we predict an increase in prevalent cases to 13·5-17·4 
million (60-107% higher than in 2021) with the largest relative increase versus 
2021 in low-income and lower-middle-income countries.
INTERPRETATION: The burden of type 1 diabetes in 2021 is vast and is expected to 
increase rapidly, especially in resource-limited countries. Most incident and 
prevalent cases are adults. The substantial missing prevalence highlights the 
premature mortality of type 1 diabetes and an opportunity to save and extend 
lives of people with type 1 diabetes. Our new model, which will be made publicly 
available as the Type 1 Diabetes Index model, will be an important tool to 
support health delivery, advocacy, and funding decisions for type 1 diabetes.

BACKGROUND: Driven by the increasing life expectancy, China and India, the two 
most populous countries in the world are experiencing a rising burden of 
multimorbidity. This study aims to explore community prevalence and dyad 
patterns of multimorbidity in China and India.
METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of five English and Chinese electronic 
databases. Studies involving adults 18 years or older at a community level, 
which reported multimorbidity prevalence and/or patterns were included. A 
modified Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used for quality assessment. Despite large 
heterogeneity among reported studies, a systematic synthesis of the results was 
conducted to report the findings.
RESULTS: From 13 996 studies retrieved, 59 studies met the inclusion criteria 
(46 in China, 9 in India and 4 in both). The median prevalence of multimorbidity 
was 30.7% (IQR 17.1, 49.4), ranging from 1.5% to 90.5%. There was a large 
difference in multimorbidity prevalence between China and India, with median 
prevalence being 36.1% (IQR 19.6, 48.8) and 28.3% (IQR 8.9, 56.8), respectively. 
Among 27 studies that reported age-specific prevalence, 19 studies found 
multimorbidity prevalence increased with age, while 8 studies observed a 
paradoxical reduction in the oldest age group. Of the 34 studies that reported 
sex-specific prevalence, 86% (n=32) observed a higher prevalence in females. The 
most common multimorbidity patterns from 14 studies included hypertensive 
diseases combined with diabetes mellitus, arthropathies, heart diseases and 
metabolic disorders. All included studies were rated as fair or poor quality.
CONCLUSION: Multimorbidity is highly prevalent in China and India with 
hypertensive diseases and other comorbidities being the most observed patterns. 
The overall quality of the studies was low and there was a lack of 
representative samples in most studies. Large epidemiology studies, using a 
common definition of multimorbidity and national representative samples, with 
sex disaggregation are needed in both countries.

Dilated cardiomyopathy associated with lamin A/C (LMNA) gene variants 
(LMNA-related dilated cardiomyopathy [DCM]) is a life-threatening condition with 
a high unmet need, accounting for approximately 6% of idiopathic DCM cases. 
Currently, no disease-specific treatments target the underlying disease 
mechanism. ARRY-371797 (PF-07265803), a potent, selective, oral, small-molecule 
inhibitor of the p38α mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, improved 
6-minute walk test (6MWT) distance in 12 patients with symptomatic LMNA-related 
DCM in a 48-week, open-label, phase 2 study. This long-term extension study 
examined the safety and efficacy of ARRY-371797 in patients from the phase 2 
study. 6MWT, N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide concentration, and 
12-item Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire score were assessed at weeks 
48, 72, 96, 120, and 144 from phase 2 study baseline. Eight patients enrolled 
(mean [SD] age, 51 [10] years, 4 male). Mean 6MWT increased by >30 m (>10%) from 
phase 2 study baseline up to week 120. The decrease in N-terminal pro-B-type 
natriuretic peptide observed in the phase 2 study was maintained throughout the 
present study. Twelve-item Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire Physical 
Limitation increased from baseline at all visits except week 96 (range: -0.8 
[week 96] to 13.8 [week 120]); results for other domains were variable. 
Treatment was generally well tolerated; 2 patients discontinued because of 
causes not considered treatment-related. There were no deaths. ARRY-371797 was 
generally well tolerated over median (range) 155.7 (61 to 327)-week exposure; 
evidence suggested preserved exercise capacity over the study period. The 
ongoing, pivotal, phase 3, randomized, placebo-controlled study REALM-DCM 
investigates the efficacy and safety of ARRY-371797 (PF-07265803) in 
LMNA-related DCM. (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02351856).

BACKGROUND: Safety and efficacy data for dupilumab beyond 1 year are lacking for 
patients from Japan with moderate-to-severe asthma.
METHODS: The TRAVERSE open-label extension (OLE) study (NCT02134028) assessed 
the safety and efficacy of dupilumab 300 mg every 2 weeks up to 96 weeks in 2282 
patients who completed a previous dupilumab asthma study. The primary endpoint 
was incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs). Secondary endpoints 
included annualized severe exacerbation rate and change from parent study 
baseline in pre-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), 
asthma control, quality of life, and blood eosinophil levels. Anti-drug 
antibodies (ADA) were evaluated. We report results in 160 (7.8% of exposed 
population) patients recruited from Japanese centers with non-oral 
corticosteroid (OCS)-dependent asthma rolled over from two parent studies, and 
in subgroups with a type 2 inflammatory phenotype.
RESULTS: TEAEs were consistent with the parent studies and the known safety 
profile of dupilumab. One patient permanently discontinued treatment due to 
TEAEs. Exacerbation rates remained low and were sustained to Week 96, as were 
improvements in pre-bronchodilator FEV1. Rapid, sustained improvements were 
observed in dupilumab-treated patients who previously received placebo in a 
parent study, while further improvements in exacerbation rates, asthma control, 
and asthma-related quality of life were observed in those continuing dupilumab. 
Blood eosinophil levels decreased progressively while on treatment. 
Treatment-emergent ADA responses were highest in patients who had previously 
received placebo. Efficacy results were consistent in patients with a type 2 
phenotype.
CONCLUSIONS: Long-term dupilumab treatment was well tolerated and efficacious in 
patients with non-OCS-dependent, moderate-to-severe asthma recruited from Japan.

Life tables summarise a population's mortality experience during a time period. 
Sex- and age-specific life tables are needed to compute various cancer survival 
measures. However, mortality rates vary according to socioeconomic status. We 
present sex- and age-specific life tables based on socioeconomic status at the 
census tract level in Spain during 2011-2013 that will allow estimating cancer 
relative survival estimates and life expectancy measures by socioeconomic 
status. Population and mortality data were obtained from the Spanish Statistical 
Office. Socioeconomic level was measured using the Spanish Deprivation Index by 
census tract. We produced sex- and age-specific life expectancies at birth by 
quintiles of deprivation, and life tables by census tract and province. Life 
expectancy at birth was higher among women than among men. Women and men in the 
most deprived census tracts in Spain lived 3.2 and 3.8 years less than their 
counterparts in the least deprived areas. A higher life expectancy in the 
northern regions of Spain was discovered. Life expectancy was higher in 
provincial capitals than in rural areas. We found a significant life expectancy 
gap and geographical variation by sex and socioeconomic status in Spain. The gap 
was more pronounced among men than among women. Understanding the association 
between life expectancy and socioeconomic status could help in developing 
appropriate public health programs. Furthermore, the life tables we produced are 
needed to estimate cancer specific survival measures by socioeconomic status. 
Therefore, they are important for cancer control in Spain.

BACKGROUND: Ovarian malignant mesoderm mixed tumor (OMMMT) is a rare clinical 
entity. To provide reference for the treatment and prognosis of OMMMT, we 
analyzed the clinical features, pathology and molecular biology characteristic 
of published cases.
METHODS: The English and Chinese reported cases of OMMMT were selected from 
PubMed, Clinical Trials.gov and CNKI database from 2000 to December 15th, 2021 
following the PRISMA guidelines.
RESULTS: A total of 63 literatures including 199 OMMMT cases were included. The 
average age of patients at diagnosis was 56.46 years, the highest incidence age 
was 60-65 years, and 82% of them were menopausal women. Most patients were 
diagnosed in FIGO III stage (59.64%). The most common symptom of OMMMT was 
abdominal pain (60.5%). 61.6% of patients were accompanied by ascites, while 
ascites was not associated with metastatic tumor and local recurrence. The CA125 
of 88.68% patients increased. The most common reported carcinomatous component 
and sarcomatous component were serous adenocarcinoma (44.96%) and chondrosarcoma 
(24.81%), respectively. Initial treatment included surgery (94.97%) and 
taxanes-based (55.10%) or platinum-based (85.71%) chemotherapy regimens. The 
median survival time of patients was 20 months. Heterologous sarcoma component 
did not shorten life expectancy. The optimal ovarian tumor cell debulking 
surgery (OOTCDS), radiotherapy and chemotherapy could significantly prolong the 
median survival time of patients. Furthermore, platinum drugs could 
significantly prolong the survival time after comparing various chemotherapy 
schemes. Besides, the combination of platinum and taxanes was therapeutically 
superior to the combination of platinum and biological alkylating agents.
CONCLUSION: The OOTCDS and platinum-based chemotherapy regimen can improve the 
prognosis of OMMMT. Targeted therapy might become a new research direction in 
the future. Since the elderly patients are the majority, the toxicity of new 
drugs on the elderly patients is more noteworthy.

Drugs, clocks and exercise in ageing: hype and hope, fact and fiction.

Furrer R(1), Handschin C(1).

Ageing is a biological process that is linked to a functional decline, 
ultimately resulting in death. Large interindividual differences exist in terms 
of life- and healthspan, representing life expectancy and the number of years 
spent in the absence of major diseases, respectively. The genetic and molecular 
mechanisms that are involved in the regulation of the ageing process, and those 
that render age the main risk factor for many diseases are still poorly 
understood. Nevertheless, a growing number of compounds have been put forward to 
affect this process. However, for scientists and laypeople alike, it is 
difficult to separate fact from fiction, and hype from hope. In this review, we 
discuss the currently pursued pharmacological anti-ageing approaches. These are 
compared to non-pharmacological interventions, some of which confer powerful 
effects on health and well-being, in particular an active lifestyle and 
exercise. Moreover, functional parameters and biological clocks as well as other 
molecular marks are compared in terms of predictive power of morbidity and 
mortality. Then, conceptual aspects and roadblocks in the development of 
anti-ageing drugs are outlined. Finally, an overview on current and future 
strategies to mitigate age-related pathologies and the extension of life- and 
healthspan is provided.

AIMS: Once-weekly semaglutide and dulaglutide represent two highly efficacious 
treatment options for type 2 diabetes. A recent indirect treatment comparison 
(ITC) has associated semaglutide 1 mg with similar and greater improvements in 
glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) and body weight, respectively, vs. dulaglutide 3 mg 
and 4.5 mg. The present study aimed to evaluate the long-term cost-effectiveness 
of semaglutide 1 mg vs. dulaglutide 3 mg and 4.5 mg in the UK.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The IQVIA CORE Diabetes Model (v9.0) was used to project 
outcomes over patients' lifetimes. Baseline cohort characteristics were sourced 
from SUSTAIN 7, with changes in HbA1c and body mass index applied as per the 
ITC. Modelled patients received semaglutide or dulaglutide for 3 years, after 
which treatment was intensified to basal insulin. Costs (expressed in 2020 
pounds sterling [GBP]) were accounted from a healthcare payer perspective.
RESULTS: Semaglutide 1 mg was associated with improvements in quality-adjusted 
life expectancy of 0.05 and 0.04 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) vs. 
dulaglutide 3 mg and 4.5 mg, respectively, due to a reduced incidence of 
diabetes-related complications with semaglutide. Direct costs were estimated to 
be GBP 76 lower and GBP 8 higher in the comparisons with dulaglutide 3 mg and 
4.5 mg, respectively. Overall outcomes were similar, but favoured semaglutide, 
and based on modelled mean outcomes it was considered dominant vs. dulaglutide 
3 mg and associated with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of GBP 228 per 
QALY gained vs. dulaglutide 4.5 mg.
CONCLUSIONS: Semaglutide 1 mg represents a cost-effective treatment vs. 
dulaglutide 3 mg and 4.5 mg for type 2 diabetes from a healthcare payer 
perspective in the UK.

Foreign direct investment (FDI) is an important driver of the increasing 
globalization of the word economy, and despite being a widely studied 
phenomenon, studies on the effects of FDI on host countries' social welfare are 
scarce. So, this work aims to analyze the impact of FDI on welfare measured 
through the human development index and its three dimensions (education, life 
expectancy, and income). Based on a sample of 146 countries for the period 
2002-2019, the results obtained by two-staged least squares-instrumental 
variable estimation suggest that FDI impact on social welfare depends on the 
countries' human capital which reflects countries' absorptive capacity. Results 
also highlight the role of government expenses in consumption, political 
stability, and quality of technological infrastructures. Therefore, the results 
suggest that, in order to improve social welfare, countries should focus and 
gear their policies towards fostering the improvement of their human resources, 
political stability, and technological infrastructures.

BACKGROUND: This study aimed to estimate healthy life expectancy (HLE) regarding 
anxiety, depression and their comorbidity among rural older adults.
METHODS: A total of 12,851 subjects (5790 men and 7061 women) enrolled from the 
Henan Rural Cohort Study were used to evaluate healthy status expectancy (HSE), 
and 10,096 (4475 men and 5621 women) of them were used to estimate 
health-adjusted life expectancy (HALE). The life expectancy was calculated using 
period life table, and HSE and HALE indicators were calculated via the Sullivan 
method.
RESULTS: For participants aged 60, the depression-free life expectancy (DFLE), 
anxiety-free life expectancy (AFLE), and depression- and anxiety-free life 
expectancy (DAFLE) were 23.0993, 23.3314, and 22.7206 years, respectively. The 
quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE) of those with neither anxiety nor 
depression, with anxiety, with depression, and with comorbidity was 22.0727, 
20.8751, 18.1484, and 17.0823 years, respectively. The ratio of DFLE (AFLE) to 
LE increased with age among both genders, while the DAFLE/LE showed a decreasing 
trend. Regardless of HSE or HALE indicators, women tended to have higher HLE, 
while HLE/LE was lower than men. Furthermore, all HLE indicators associated with 
anxiety were the largest in both genders compared to indicators regarding 
depression.
LIMITATIONS: The HLE may be overestimated ignoring institutional population in 
the study.
CONCLUSION: Anxiety and depression played essential roles in the quality of life 
among rural older adults, especially depression. Comorbidity would intensify the 
adverse effect in rural areas, especially for older men. More attention should 
be paid to the psychological problems among rural older population.

Disease Control, Shenzhen 518020, China.

Objective: From a screening-focused perspective, to analyze the 30-year changes 
in disability adjusted life years (DALYs) caused by colorectal cancer (CRC) in 
China and in some other selected populations, to inform extent of burden of CRC 
and future related prevention and control in populations in China. Methods: 
Based on the data of Global Burden of Disease 2019 (GBD 2019), the DALYs, world 
standardized DALY rate, and the composition of different subgroups in China were 
collected. Joinpoint regression model was used to analyze the trend during 
1990-2019, and comparison was made with the international data and population 
screening situation. The trend of DALY burden caused by CRC in China was 
predicted. Results: In 2019, the DALYs due to CRC in China was 6.395 million 
person-years, accounting for 26.3% of the global burden and 9.5% of all cancers 
burden in China; the DALYs in men accounted for 65.2%, in those aged ≥65 years 
old accounted for 44.8%, in the age group recommended by local screening 
guidelines (40-75 years) accounted for 73.7%. The years lived with disability 
accounted for 4.8%. Compared with 1990, the CRC-caused DALYs in China increased 
by 181.5% in 2019. Factors with the largest increase in the attributable 
percentage were high Body Mass Index (151.1%), diet high in red meat (86.4%) and 
diet high in processed meat (78.8%), etc. For DALY rate, it was 245.6/100 000 in 
1990 and 320.6/100 000 in 2019, an increase of 30.5%. For reference, Australia 
(began in 2006), the UK (2006), and Japan (1992), where CRC population-wide 
screening has been conducted, had decreases in DALY rate of 36.0%, 28.6%, and 
17.8%, respectively. The predication of DALYs suggested that without continued 
expansion of population-based screening, the DALYs in China would reach 7.7 
million person-year-9.1 million person-year by 2030, an increase of 19.9%-41.8% 
compared with 2019. Conclusions: The burden of CRC-caused DALYs in China 
increased over the past 30 years, and would become more serious because of 
population aging and the concomitant disability problem. The age range 
recommended by the current local screening guideline could theoretically include 
70% of the population from which the DALYs burden originates, however, the 
real-world population screening coverage is still limited. The observed decline 
in CRC-related DALY rate in selected countries was substantially due to the 
implementation of mass screening, indicating the importance of speedily 
expanding the population coverage of CRC screening in China.

基于筛查干预视角，分析中国人群结直肠癌所致伤残调整寿命年（DALY）负担的现况、既往与未来，并行国际比较，为中国人群结直肠癌疾病负担及其筛查干预提供参考。 
方法： 
基于全球疾病负担研究（GBD）平台摘录数据，描述中国2019年结直肠癌所致DALY数、世标率及不同亚组值；通过Joinpoint回归模型，分析1990-2019年变化趋势，结合人群筛查情况行国际比较。进一步预测中国结直肠癌所致DALY负担未来变化趋势。 
结果： 
中国2019年结直肠癌所致DALY总数为639.5万人年，占全球结直肠癌负担的26.3%，占中国全部癌种负担的9.5%；其中男性DALY数占65.2%，≥65岁者占44.8%，与本土结直肠癌筛查指南推荐接近的年龄段（40~74岁）人群占73.7%，伤残损失寿命年（YLD）数占4.8%。相比1990年，2019年中国结直肠癌所致DALY总数增长了181.5%，有明确归因占比上升幅度最大的因素是高BMI、红肉摄入过量和加工肉制品摄入过量等（增幅依次为151.1%、86.4%和78.8%）。就结直肠癌所致DALY率，中国1990年为245.6/10万，2019年为320.6/10万，增幅达30.5%；作为参照，已开展全人群结直肠癌筛查的澳大利亚（2006年启动）、英国（2006年）和日本（1992年），DALY率降幅分别为36.0%、28.6%和17.8%。预测提示，若无继续扩大范围的人群筛查，2030年中国结直肠癌所致DALY总数将达766.6万人年~906.6万人年，较2019年将增加19.9%~41.8%。 
结论： 
中国结直肠癌所致DALY负担近30年持续增加，人口老龄化及伴随失能会使负担更重。目前本土推荐筛查年龄可覆盖七成DALY负担来源人群，但人群的实际筛查覆盖有限。其他国家结直肠癌所致DALY负担的下降与筛查开展密不可分，提示尽快扩大本土结直肠癌有效筛查覆盖率的重要性。.

Objective: To analyze the spatiotemporal distribution of life expectancy (LE) 
and health-adjusted life expectancy (HALE) in Guangzhou from 2010 to 2019, and 
quantize the comprehensive impact of different causes and sequelae on health. 
Methods: The LE, HALE, and cause-excluded health adjusted life expectancy 
(CEHALE) were estimated using cause-of-death surveillance datasets from 
Guangzhou Municipal Center for Disease Control and Prevention from 2010 to 2019 
and open data from the Global Burden of Disease Study. Joinpoint log-linear 
regression model was used to analyze the temporal trend and described spatial 
distribution. Results: In 2019, the LE in residents in Guangzhou was 82.9 years 
(80.1 years in men and 85.9 years in women), and the HALE was 75.6 years (74.0 
years in men and 77.3 years in women). Compared with the urban fringe, the 
central urban area had higher LE and HALE, and the differences between LE and 
HALE were small. The LE and HALE in Guangzhou showed an increasing trend from 
2010 to 2019. The LE increased by 2.8 years (AAPC=0.4, 95%CI: 0.3-0.4), with the 
increase of 2.8 years in men and 2.9 years in women. The HALE increased by 2.4 
years (AAPC=0.3, 95%CI: 0.3-0.4), with the increase of 2.5 years in men and 2.2 
years in women. The median healthy life lost due to communicable, maternal, 
neonatal, and nutritional diseases was 6.2 years (AAPC=-4.2, 95%CI: -5.3--3.1), 
while the median healthy life lost due to non-communicable diseases was 14.7 
years (AAPC=1.6, 95%CI: 0.9-2.3), the median healthy life expectancy reduced by 
injury was 6.3 years (AAPC=-3.5, 95%CI: -4.5--2.6). Musculoskeletal disorders, 
skin and subcutaneous diseases, cardiovascular diseases, nutritional 
deficiencies, diabetes and kidney diseases were the top five diseases causing 
healthy life expectancy loss. Conclusion: The LE and HALE in residents in 
Guangzhou increased steadily from 2010 to 2019, but the quality of life in the 
urban fringe was lower than that of the central urban area. Non-communicable 
diseases were the leading causes of healthy life expectancy loss. Health 
policies and prevention measures should be developed according to area specific 
characteristics, and social medical resources should be rationally allocated to 
key diseases to reduce their disease burden.

Publisher: 目的： 分析2010-2019年广州市期望寿命和健康调整期望寿命（HALE）的时空分布，量化不同病因及其后遗症对健康的综合影响。 方法： 
利用2010-2019年广州市CDC的死因监测数据和全球疾病负担研究公开数据，基于寿命表法和沙利文法分别估算期望寿命和HALE，以伤残损失寿命年折合法计算去病因健康调整期望寿命。使用Joinpoint对数线性回归分析时间趋势，并描述空间分布。 
结果： 
2019年，广州市居民期望寿命为82.9岁（男性80.1岁，女性85.9岁），HALE为75.6岁（男性74.0岁，女性77.3岁）。中心城区相对城区边缘有更高的期望寿命和HALE，且期望寿命与HALE的差值更小。2010-2019年，广州市居民期望寿命和HALE整体呈上升趋势。全市期望寿命增加2.8岁［平均年度变化百分比（AAPC）=0.4，95%CI：0.3~0.4］，其中，男性和女性分别增加2.8岁和2.9岁；全市HALE增加2.4岁（AAPC=0.3，95%CI：0.3~0.4），其中，男性和女性分别增加2.5岁和2.2岁。因传染性疾病、孕产妇疾病、新生儿疾病和营养疾病失去的平均健康寿命中位数为6.2年（AAPC=-4.2，95%CI：-5.3~-3.1），因非传染性疾病失去的平均健康寿命中位数为14.7年（AAPC=1.6，95%CI：0.9~2.3），因伤害失去的平均健康寿命中位数为6.3年（AAPC=-3.5，95%CI：-4.5~-2.6）。其中，因肌肉骨骼疾病、皮肤和皮下疾病、心血管疾病、营养不良、糖尿病和肾脏病失去的平均健康寿命中位数高居前5位。 
结论：

The 20th and 21st centuries have witnessed a substantial increase in human life 
expectancy and in the number of men and women aged 60 years and older. Aging is 
associated with a large number of health conditions, including sarcopenia, which 
has been the subject of important research in the past 30 years. Sarcopenia is 
characterized by an age-related loss of muscle mass, weakness, and impaired 
physical performance. The condition can be diagnosed with a combination of 
measurements of these three elements. The precise definition of sarcopenia and 
the selection of optimal assessment methods have changed significantly in the 
past 20 years; nonetheless, the prevalence of sarcopenia in the general older 
population is in the range of 5-15%. Molecular and cellular events at the muscle 
cell level impact the size and quality of muscles (force adjusted for size). The 
active and passive mechanical properties of single muscle fibers are altered by 
changes in the structure and function of various cellular elements. Systemic 
factors such as inflammation, loss of hormonal influence, and deleterious 
lifestyle choices also contribute to sarcopenia. The consequences of sarcopenia 
include many adverse effects such as impairments in activities of daily living, 
falls, loss of independence, and increased mortality. Several rehabilitative 
interventions have been tested, and the safest and most effective is the use of 
progressive resistance exercise. An increase in dietary protein intake has 
synergistic effects. Future research should focus on a consensus definition of 
sarcopenia, identification of the best assessment methods, understanding of 
biological mechanisms, and testing of innovative interventions.
