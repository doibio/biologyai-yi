BACKGROUND: Synovitis (inflamed joint synovial lining) in rheumatoid arthritis 
(RA) can be assessed by clinical examination (CE) or ultrasound (US).
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the added value of US, compared with CE alone, in RA 
synovitis in terms of clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness.
DATA SOURCES: Electronic databases including MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane 
databases were searched from inception to October 2015.
REVIEW METHODS: A systematic review sought RA studies that compared additional 
US with CE. Heterogeneity of the studies with regard to interventions, 
comparators and outcomes precluded meta-analyses. Systematic searches for 
studies of cost-effectiveness and US and treatment-tapering studies (not 
necessarily including US) were undertaken.
MATHEMATICAL MODEL: A model was constructed that estimated, for patients in whom 
drug tapering was considered, the reduction in costs of disease-modifying 
anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and serious infections at which the addition of US 
had a cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained of £20,000 and £30,000. 
Furthermore, the reduction in the costs of DMARDs at which US becomes cost 
neutral was also estimated. For patients in whom dose escalation was being 
considered, the reduction in number of patients escalating treatment and in 
serious infections at which the addition of US had a cost per QALY gained of 
£20,000 and £30,000 was estimated. The reduction in number of patients 
escalating treatment for US to become cost neutral was also estimated.
RESULTS: Fifty-eight studies were included. Two randomised controlled trials 
compared adding US to a Disease Activity Score (DAS)-based treat-to-target 
strategy for early RA patients. The addition of power Doppler ultrasound (PDUS) 
to a Disease Activity Score 28 joints-based treat-to-target strategy in the 
Targeting Synovitis in Early Rheumatoid Arthritis (TaSER) trial resulted in no 
significant between-group difference for change in Disease Activity Score 44 
joints (DAS44). This study found that significantly more patients in the PDUS 
group attained DAS44 remission (p = 0.03). The Aiming for Remission in 
Rheumatoid Arthritis (ARCTIC) trial found that the addition of PDUS and 
grey-scale ultrasound (GSUS) to a DAS-based strategy did not produce a 
significant between-group difference in the primary end point: composite DAS of 
< 1.6, no swollen joints and no progression in van der Heijde-modified total 
Sharp score (vdHSS). The ARCTIC trial did find that the erosion score of the 
vdHS had a significant advantage for the US group (p = 0.04). In the TaSER trial 
there was no significant group difference for erosion. Other studies suggested 
that PDUS was significantly associated with radiographic progression and that US 
had added value for wrist and hand joints rather than foot and ankle joints. 
Heterogeneity between trials made conclusions uncertain. No studies were 
identified that reported the cost-effectiveness of US in monitoring synovitis. 
The model estimated that an average reduction of 2.5% in the costs of biological 
DMARDs would be sufficient to offset the costs of 3-monthly US. The money could 
not be recouped if oral methotrexate was the only drug used.
LIMITATIONS: Heterogeneity of the trials precluded meta-analysis. Therefore, no 
summary estimates of effect were available. Additional costs and health-related 
quality of life decrements, relating to a flare following tapering or disease 
progression, have not been included. The feasibility of increased US monitoring 
has not been assessed.
CONCLUSION: Limited evidence suggests that US monitoring of synovitis could 
provide a cost-effective approach to selecting RA patients for treatment 
tapering or escalation avoidance. Considerable uncertainty exists for all 
conclusions. Future research priorities include evaluating US monitoring of RA 
synovitis in longitudinal clinical studies.

BACKGROUND: Americans have a shorter life expectancy compared with residents of 
almost all other high-income countries. We aim to estimate the impact of 
lifestyle factors on premature mortality and life expectancy in the US 
population.
METHODS: Using data from the Nurses' Health Study (1980-2014; n=78 865) and the 
Health Professionals Follow-up Study (1986-2014, n=44 354), we defined 5 
low-risk lifestyle factors as never smoking, body mass index of 18.5 to 24.9 
kg/m2, ≥30 min/d of moderate to vigorous physical activity, moderate alcohol 
intake, and a high diet quality score (upper 40%), and estimated hazard ratios 
for the association of total lifestyle score (0-5 scale) with mortality. We used 
data from the NHANES (National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys; 
2013-2014) to estimate the distribution of the lifestyle score and the US 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention WONDER database to derive the 
age-specific death rates of Americans. We applied the life table method to 
estimate life expectancy by levels of the lifestyle score.
RESULTS: During up to 34 years of follow-up, we documented 42 167 deaths. The 
multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios for mortality in adults with 5 compared 
with zero low-risk factors were 0.26 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.22-0.31) 
for all-cause mortality, 0.35 (95% CI, 0.27-0.45) for cancer mortality, and 0.18 
(95% CI, 0.12-0.26) for cardiovascular disease mortality. The 
population-attributable risk of nonadherence to 5 low-risk factors was 60.7% 
(95% CI, 53.6-66.7) for all-cause mortality, 51.7% (95% CI, 37.1-62.9) for 
cancer mortality, and 71.7% (95% CI, 58.1-81.0) for cardiovascular disease 
mortality. We estimated that the life expectancy at age 50 years was 29.0 years 
(95% CI, 28.3-29.8) for women and 25.5 years (95% CI, 24.7-26.2) for men who 
adopted zero low-risk lifestyle factors. In contrast, for those who adopted all 
5 low-risk factors, we projected a life expectancy at age 50 years of 43.1 years 
(95% CI, 41.3-44.9) for women and 37.6 years (95% CI, 35.8-39.4) for men. The 
projected life expectancy at age 50 years was on average 14.0 years (95% CI, 
11.8-16.2) longer among female Americans with 5 low-risk factors compared with 
those with zero low-risk factors; for men, the difference was 12.2 years (95% 
CI, 10.1-14.2).
CONCLUSIONS: Adopting a healthy lifestyle could substantially reduce premature 
mortality and prolong life expectancy in US adults.

The evaluation of patients diagnosed with impaired systolic function heart 
failure represents a great challenge, in both the general and elderly 
population. We consider that elderly patients are the most severely affected by 
this disease that represents the final impact of cardiovascular disease 
continuum. Cardiovascular diseases are associated with serious morbidity and 
mortality, and considerable health care costs related to diagnosis and 
treatment. In this report we discuss some controversies regarding methods of 
heart failure evaluation as well as therapeutic steps and devices, including: 
reparatory therapeutic steps and initiation of therapy with loop diuretics, 
inconsistent dose titration for angiotensin-converting enzyme 
inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blocker and beta blockers, as well as novel 
therapies, such as angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor and treatments that 
directly improve cardiomyocyte function. We conclude that, beyond technical 
progress, which is raising the cost of therapy for patients with heart failure, 
more careful monitoring of patient progress through clinical and paraclinical 
control visits, both at medical facilities and at home, would have greater 
impact and be more cost-effective. Physical therapy and promoting emotional and 
psychological wellbeing, to maintain a positive state of mind, contribute 
substantially to the quality of life and life expectancy, and are most important 
in elderly people who are most affected by dramatic reductions in wellbeing. 
Unfortunately, for many patients with severe impairment of left ventricular 
ejection fraction, these goals and therapeutic procedures are often lacking in 
current health care systems.

BACKGROUND: Despite extensive publication of clinical guidelines on how to 
manage musculoskeletal pain and back pain in particular, these efforts have not 
significantly translated into decreases in work disability due to 
musculoskeletal pain. Previous studies have indicated a potential for better 
outcomes by formalized, early referral to allied healthcare providers familiar 
with occupational health issues. Instances where allied healthcare providers of 
comparable professional characteristics, but with differing practice parameters, 
can highlight important social and organisational strategies useful for 
informing policy and practice. Currently, Norwegian chiropractors have 
legislated sickness certification rights, whereas their Danish and Swedish 
counterparts do not. Against the backdrop of legislative variation, we 
described, compared and contrasted the views and experiences of Scandinavian 
chiropractors engaging in work disability prevention and sickness absence 
management.
METHODS: This study was embedded in a two-phased, sequential exploratory 
mixed-methods design. In a comparative qualitative case study design, we 
explored the experience of chiropractors regarding sickness absence management 
drawn from face-to-face, semi-structured interviews. We subsequently coded and 
thematically restructured their experiences and perceptions.
RESULTS: Twelve interviews were conducted. Thematically, chiropractors' capacity 
to support patients in sickness absence management revolved around four key 
issues: issues of legislation and politics; the rationale for being a sickness 
absence management partner; whether an integrated sickness absence management 
pathway existed/could be created; and finally, the barriers to service provision 
for sickness absence management.
CONCLUSION: Allied health providers, in this instance chiropractors, with 
patient management expertise can fulfil a key role in sickness absence 
management and by extension work disability prevention when these practices are 
legislatively supported. In cases where these practices occur informally, 
however, practitioners face systemic-related issues and professional self-image 
challenges that tend to hamper them in fulfilling a more integrated role as 
providers of work disability prevention practices.

Many studies have found that health outcomes decline when health professionals 
leave the country, but do such results remain consistent in gender- and 
income-disaggregated skilled migration? To help uncover explanations for such a 
pro-migration nature of health outcomes, the present study revisits this topic 
but allows for associations of skilled migration with mortality and life 
expectancy to differ between male and female, and between low- and high-income 
countries. Using a panel of 133 developing countries as source and 20 OECD 
countries as destination from 1980 to 2010 allowing the coefficient on 
emigration across different education levels to differ, the study finds the 
negative effect of high-skilled emigration on health outcomes. Such effect is 
more pronounced for high-skilled female migration than those for male and for 
low-income countries than for middle-and high-income countries. Results also 
show that such adverse effect is larger for African countries than non-African 
ones. However, the low-skilled migration appears to be insignificant to affect 
health outcomes in developing countries. Thus, skilled migration is detrimental 
to longevity in developing countries but unskilled migration is not.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The goal of this review is to summarize current understanding 
of pharmacogenetics and pharmacogenomics in chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity.
RECENT FINDINGS: Most of the studies rely on in vitro cytotoxic assays. There 
have been several smaller scale candidate gene approaches and a handful of 
genome-wide studies linking genetic variation to susceptibility to 
chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity. Currently, pharmacogenomic testing of all 
childhood cancer patients with an indication for doxorubicin or daunorubicin 
therapy for RARG rs2229774, SLC28A3 rs7853758, and UGT1A6*4 rs17863783 variants 
is recommended. There is no recommendation regarding testing in adults. There is 
clear evidence pointing to the role of pharmacogenetics and pharmacogenomics in 
cardiotoxicity susceptibility to chemotherapeutic agents. Larger scale studies 
are needed to further identify susceptibility markers and to develop 
pharmacogenomics-based risk profiling to improve quality of life and life 
expectancy in cancer survivors.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The economic outcomes of dual antiplatelet therapy in 
East Asian patients are still unclear. We aimed to evaluate the economic 
outcomes of ticagrelor versus clopidogrel for patients with acute coronary 
syndrome (ACS) in China, Japan, Korea, Taiwan and Hong Kong.
METHODS: A two-phase model consisting of a 1-year decision tree and a lifetime 
Markov model was used to estimate the economic outcomes. The data from the East 
Asian subgroup of Platelet Inhibition and Patient Outcomes (PLATO) and PHILO 
studies were used for the calculation of the events rate for ticagrelor and 
clopidogrel in the first 12 months, whereas the costs were obtained from East 
Asian sources and utility from the published literature. Sensitivity analyses 
were conducted to test model robustness.
RESULTS: Ticagrelor showed the marginal lifetime quality-adjusted life-year 
(QALY) of 0.0050, 0.0091, 0.0107, 0.0050, and 0.0050 in China, Japan, Korea, 
Taiwan, and Hong Kong compared with clopidogrel, with marginal healthcare costs 
of (all values in US dollars) $562, $595, $975, $611, and $672, respectively. 
The marginal cost per QALY gained with ticagrelor was $112,051, $65,692, 
$91,207, $121,838, and $133,953 from a public healthcare system perspective of 
China, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Hong Kong, respectively. The sensitivity 
analysis showed consistent results.
CONCLUSION: Treatment of ACS for 12 months with ticagrelor is not a 
cost-effective option for the prevention of thrombotic events in East Asia.

INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to evaluate the short-term cost-utility 
of insulin degludec (degludec) versus insulin glargine 100 units/mL (glargine 
U100) for the treatment of type 2 diabetes in the basal-bolus subgroup of the 
head-to-head cardiovascular (CV) outcome trial, DEVOTE.
METHODS: A cost-utility analysis was conducted over a 2-year time horizon using 
a decision analytic model to compare costs in patients receiving once daily 
degludec or glargine U100, both as part of a basal-bolus regimen, in addition to 
standard care. Clinical outcomes and patient characteristics were taken 
exclusively from DEVOTE, whilst health-related quality of life utilities and 
UK-specific costs (expressed in 2016 GBP) were obtained from the literature. The 
analysis was conducted from the perspective of the National Health Service.
RESULTS: Degludec was associated with mean cost savings of GBP 28.78 per patient 
relative to glargine U100 in patients with type 2 diabetes at high CV risk. Cost 
savings were driven by the reduction in risk of diabetes-related complications 
with degludec, which offset the higher treatment costs relative to glargine 
U100. Degludec was associated with a mean improvement of 0.0064 quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs) compared with glargine U100, with improvements driven 
predominantly by lower rates of severe hypoglycemia with degludec versus 
glargine U100. Improvements in quality-adjusted life expectancy combined with 
cost neutrality resulted in degludec being dominant over glargine U100. 
Sensitivity analyses demonstrated that the incremental cost-utility ratio was 
stable to variations in the majority of model inputs.
CONCLUSION: The present short-term modeling analysis found that for the 
basal-bolus subgroup of patients in DEVOTE, with a high risk of CV events, 
degludec was cost neutral (no additional costs) compared with glargine U100 over 
a 2-year time horizon in the UK setting. Furthermore, there were QALY gains with 
degludec, particularly due to the reduction in the risk of severe hypoglycemia.

Evaluation and Characterization of Health Economics and Outcomes Research in 
SAARC Nations.

Mehta M(1), Nerurkar R(1).

Hospital, Mumbai Central, Mumbai, India.

OBJECTIVE: To identify, evaluate, and characterize the variety, quality, and 
intent of the health economics and outcomes research studies being conducted in 
SAARC (South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation) nations.
METHODS: Studies published in English language between 1990 and 2015 were 
retrieved from Medline databases using relevant search strategies. Studies were 
independently reviewed as per Cochrane methodology and information on the type 
of research and outcomes were extracted. Quality of reporting was assessed.
RESULTS: Of the 2638 studies screened from eight SAARC nations, a total of 179 
were included for review (India = 140; Bangladesh = 12; Sri Lanka = 8; Pakistan 
= 7; Afghanistan = 5; Nepal = 4; Bhutan = 2; Maldives = 1). The broad study 
categories were cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs = 76 studies), cost analyses 
(35 studies), and burden of illness (BOI=26 studies). The outcomes evaluated 
were direct costs, indirect costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
(ICER), quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and disability-adjusted life-years 
(DALYs). Cost of medicines, consultation and hospital charges, and monitoring 
costs were assessed as direct medical costs along with non-direct medical costs 
such as travel and food for patients and caregivers. The components of indirect 
costs were loss of income of patients and caregivers and loss of productivity. 
Quality of life (QoL) was assessed in 48 studies. The most commonly used 
instrument for assessing QoL was the WHO-Quality of Life BREF (WHOQOL-BREF) 
questionnaire (76%). The Quality of Health Economic Studies (QHES) score was 
used for quality assessment of full economic studies (44 studies). The mean QHES 
score was 43.76.
CONCLUSION: This review identifies various patterns of health economic studies 
in eight SAARC nations. The quality of economic evaluation studies for health 
care in India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Nepal, Bhutan, and 
Maldives needs improvement. There is a need to generate the capacity of 
researchers to undertake quality economic evaluations as well as an orientation 
of the policy makers so that there is a demand for such studies as well as a 
scope for its use in policy making.

Medicare covers annual wellness visits that are scheduled separately from 
regular medical appointments. These visits focus on prevention and health 
maintenance to help patients achieve successful aging, which is defined as 
living to old age without disability while also maintaining high physical and 
psychological levels of functioning and social engagement. To achieve these 
goals, most adults should perform at least 150 min/week of moderate-intensity 
exercise and maintain an optimal body mass index (ie, 23 to 32 kg/m2). Healthy 
diets for most older adults include 1 to 1.2 g/kg/day of protein, with more for 
individuals with serious acute or chronic conditions. A varied vitamin-rich diet 
should be consumed. In the absence of deficiencies, vitamin supplements are 
unnecessary. Neither testosterone nor growth hormone supplementation is 
recommended. When patients have difficulty sleeping, physicians should assess 
for conditions affecting sleep and promote good sleep hygiene rather than 
prescribe hypnotics. Screening for depression and assessing driving safety are 
important. Smoking cessation and limiting alcohol ingestion to small amounts 
have benefits even in older age. Cancer screening should be offered only to 
patients with life expectancy of at least 10 years and who understand the risks 
and benefits.

BACKGROUND: Burden of disease studies intend to improve public health 
decision-making and to measure social and economic impact in population. The 
objective of this study was to describe the burden of acute respiratory 
infections (ARI) in Ecuador between 2011 and 2015.
METHODS: Five-year period morbidity and mortality data available from national 
agencies of statistics was analyzed to estimate the burden of disease 
attributable to acute respiratory infections. Cases and deaths registered were 
grouped according to their ICD-10 code into three diagnostic groups: Acute upper 
respiratory infections (J00-J06), Influenza and pneumonia (J09-J18), and 
Bronchitis and other acute lower respiratory infections (J20-J22, J85, J86). 
Disability-adjusted life years stratified by diagnostic and age group were 
calculated using the "DALY" package for R. The productivity loss in monetary 
terms was estimated using the human capital method.
RESULTS: Over the 5-year period studied there were a total of 14.84 million 
cases of acute respiratory infections, with 17 757 deaths reported (0.12%). The 
yearly burden of disease ranged between 98 944 to 118 651 disability-adjusted 
life years, with an estimated average loss of productivity of US$152.16 million 
(±19.6) per year. Approximately 99% of the burden can be attributed to years 
life lost due to premature mortality in population under 5 years old and over 60 
years-old.
CONCLUSIONS: The burden of acute respiratory infections remained steady during 
the analyzed period. Evidence-based prevention and control policies to tackle 
acute respiratory infections in Ecuador should focus on the population at 
extreme ages of life.

BACKGROUND: The clinical utility of the existing apps for people with eating 
disorders (EDs) is not clear. The TCApp has been specifically developed for 
people with EDs, is based on the principles of Cognitive Behavioural Treatment 
(CBT) and allows a bidirectional link between the patient and the therapist. The 
objectives of the study are, first, to assess the clinical efficacy of a 
combined intervention for Eating Disorders (EDs) that includes an online 
intervention through the TCApp plus standard face-to-face CBT in comparison to 
standard face-to-face CBT alone, and second, to examine the cost-effectiveness 
of the TCApp and identify potential predicting, moderating and mediating 
variables that promote or hinder the implementation of the TCApp in ED units in 
Spain.
METHODS: The study methodology is that of a randomised controlled trial 
combining qualitative and quantitative methods, with a 6-month follow-up. 
Approximately 250 patients over 12 years old with a diagnosis of an ED from 
several ED units in Spain will be randomised to one of two different conditions. 
Participants, their caregivers, healthcare professionals and technical staff 
involved in the development and maintenance of the application will be assessed 
at baseline (T0), post-intervention (T1) and at 6 months follow-up (T2). Primary 
outcome measures will include ED symptomatology while secondary measures will 
include general psychopathology and quality of life for patients, quality of 
life and caregiving experience for family caregivers and adoption-related 
variables for all participants involved, such as perceived usability, user's 
satisfaction and technology acceptance. For the cost-effectiveness analysis, we 
will assess quality-adjusted life years (QALYs); total societal cost will be 
estimated using costs to patients and the health plan, and other related costs.
DISCUSSION: The study will provide an important advance in the treatment of EDs; 
in the long term, it is expected to improve the quality of patient care and the 
treatment efficacy and to reduce waiting lists as well as direct and indirect 
costs associated with the treatment of EDs in Spain.

BACKGROUND: As forest is the preferred environment for ticks, forestry workers 
are exposed to tick bites and tick-borne diseases. We assessed the 
seroprevalence of anti-Borrelia burgdorferi (Bb) antibodies and investigated, 
using an integrated landscape approach, the individual and environmental factors 
associated with the seroprevalence of Bb in Belgian forestry workers, a 
high-risk group in Belgium.
METHODS: A group of 310 Belgian forest workers was examined to assess the 
seroprevalence of anti-Borrelia IgG antibodies. Using principal component 
analysis and binary logistic regression, the joint effects of individual 
characteristics and environmental characteristics were examined.
RESULTS: Sixty-seven of the 310 workers were seropositive for Lyme disease (LD), 
leading to a seroprevalence of 21.6%. The seroprevalence was higher among forest 
workers visiting forests more frequently (P = 0.003) or who reported over 100 
tick bites (P-value < 0.001). The intensity of tick bites and the use of 
protection measures against tick bites have a positive impact on LD 
seroprevalence while the quantity of shadow from trees at ground level had a 
negative one.
CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that forest workers are a population at risk for 
LD and, by extension, at risk for various tick-borne diseases. In addition to 
the role of the environment, our results also showed the importance of 
considering exposure when predicting the risk of infection by Bb.

Four decades ago, U.S. life expectancy was within the same range as other 
high-income peer countries. However, during the past decades, the United States 
has fared worse in many key health domains resulting in shorter life expectancy 
and poorer health-a health disadvantage. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood 
Institute convened a panel of national and international health experts and 
stakeholders for a Think Tank meeting to explore the U.S. health disadvantage 
and to seek specific recommendations for implementation research opportunities 
for heart, lung, blood, and sleep disorders. Recommendations for National Heart, 
Lung, and Blood Institute consideration were made in several areas including 
understanding the drivers of the disadvantage, identifying potential solutions, 
creating strategic partnerships with common goals, and finally enhancing and 
fostering a research workforce for implementation research. Key recommendations 
included exploring why the United States is doing better for health indicators 
in a few areas compared with peer countries; targeting populations across the 
entire socioeconomic spectrum with interventions at all levels in order to 
prevent missing a substantial proportion of the disadvantage; assuring 
partnership have high-level goals that can create systemic change through 
collective impact; and finally, increasing opportunities for implementation 
research training to meet the current needs. Connecting with the research 
community at large and building on ongoing research efforts will be an important 
strategy. Broad partnerships and collaboration across the social, political, 
economic, and private sectors and all civil society will be critical-not only 
for implementation research but also for implementing the findings to have the 
desired population impact. Developing the relevant knowledge to tackle the U.S. 
health disadvantage is the necessary first step to improve U.S. health outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Epilepsy is a common neurological condition resulting in recurrent 
seizures. Research evidence in long-term conditions suggests that patients 
benefit from self-management education and that this may improve quality of life 
(QoL). Epilepsy self-management education has yet to be tested in a UK setting.
OBJECTIVES: To determine the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of 
Self-Management education for people with poorly controlled epILEpsy [SMILE 
(UK)].
DESIGN: A parallel pragmatic randomised controlled trial.
SETTING: Participants were recruited from eight hospitals in London and 
south-east England.
PARTICIPANTS: Adults aged ≥ 16 years with epilepsy and two or more epileptic 
seizures in the past year, who were currently being prescribed antiepileptic 
drugs.
INTERVENTION: A 2-day group self-management course alongside treatment as usual 
(TAU). The control group received TAU.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome is QoL in people with epilepsy at 
12-month follow-up using the Quality Of Life In Epilepsy 31-P (QOLIE-31-P) 
scale. Other outcomes were seizure control, impact of epilepsy, medication 
adverse effects, psychological distress, perceived stigma, self-mastery and 
medication adherence. Cost-effectiveness analyses and a process evaluation were 
undertaken.
RANDOMISATION: A 1 : 1 ratio between trial arms using fixed block sizes of two.
BLINDING: Participants were not blinded to their group allocation because of the 
nature of the study. Researchers involved in data collection and analysis 
remained blinded throughout.
RESULTS: The trial completed successfully. A total of 404 participants were 
enrolled in the study [SMILE (UK), n = 205; TAU, n = 199] with 331 completing 
the final follow-up at 12 months [SMILE (UK), n = 163; TAU, n = 168]. In the 
intervention group, 61.5% completed all sessions of the course. No adverse 
events were found to be related to the intervention. At baseline, participants 
had a mean age of 41.7 years [standard deviation (SD) 14.1 years], and had 
epilepsy for a median of 18 years. The mean QOLIE-31-P score for the whole group 
at baseline was 66.0 out of 100.0 (SD 14.2). Clinically relevant levels of 
anxiety symptoms were reported in 53.6% of the group and depression symptoms in 
28.0%. The results following an intention-to-treat analysis showed no change in 
any measures at the 12-month follow-up [QOLIE-31-P: SMILE (UK) mean: 67.4, SD 
13.5; TAU mean: 69.5, SD 14.8]. The cost-effectiveness study showed that SMILE 
(UK) was possibly cost-effective but was also associated with lower QoL. The 
process evaluation with 20 participants revealed that a group course increased 
confidence by sharing with others and improved self-management behaviours.
CONCLUSIONS: For people with epilepsy and persistent seizures, a 2-day 
self-management education course is cost-saving, but does not improve QoL after 
12-months or reduce anxiety or depression symptoms. A psychological intervention 
may help with anxiety and depression. Interviewed participants reported 
attending a group course increased their confidence and helped them improve 
their self-management.
FUTURE WORK: More research is needed on self-management courses, with 
psychological components and integration with routine monitoring.

As a class of emerging multifunctional soft materials, gallium-based liquid 
metal (LM) amalgams, metal/nonmetal particles dispersed in an LM environment, 
suggest a combination of intriguing properties. In this article, Mg particles in 
gallium-indium alloy for making new conceptual biomedical materials, which can 
adapt to any irregular skin surface, are introduced, and superior photothermal 
effect with a 61.5% photothermal conversion (PTC) increase with respect to that 
of the LM is realized. The formation of a new intermetallic phase Mg2 Ga5 and 
adjustable surface roughness, which guarantees a rapid temperature increase when 
illuminated by laser, are found to be responsible for the photothermal effect 
enhancement. The obtained soft metallic mixtures also possess excellent thermal 
conductivity, favorable formability, together with benign biocompatibility. The 
potential use of the currently produced LM mixtures for conformable photothermal 
therapy (PTT) of skin tumors, which is hard to precisely heat otherwise via 
conventional ways, is explored. The soft Mg-GaIn mixtures can adapt to irregular 
tumor shapes to achieve conformable and minimal invasive tumor treatment. In 
vivo experiments on skin-tumor-bearing mice show obvious tumor growth 
suppression and life span extension after PTT treatment. As a novel functional 
PTC material, the Mg-GaIn mixtures exhibit promising potentials in the coming 
clinical cancer theranostics.
