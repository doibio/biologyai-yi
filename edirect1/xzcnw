Enterobacteriaceae are the predominant pathogens in acute and chronic bacterial 
prostatitis, but an increasing role of Enterococci has been reported. Many 
strains of these uropathogens exhibit the ability to form biofilm and multidrug- 
resistance. Sexually Transmitted Infections (STI) agents, in particular 
Chlamydia trachomatis and Mycoplasma genitalium, have been also considered as 
causative pathogens of chronic bacterial prostatitis. On the contrary the 
effective role in genital diseases of other "genital mycoplasmas" is still a 
much debated issue. Sexually Transmitted Infections agents should be 
investigated by molecular methods in both patient and sexual partner. "Next 
generation" investigations, such as cytokine analysis, cytological typing of 
immune cells could help stratifying the immune response. Epigenetic 
dysregulation of inflammatory factors should be investigated according to 
systemic and compartment-specific signals. The search for biomarkers should also 
include evaluation of hormonal pathways, as measurement of estrogen levels in 
semen. Antimicrobials are the first line agents for the treatment of bacterial 
prostatitis. The success of antimicrobial treatment depends on the antibacterial 
activity and the pharmacokinetic characteristics of the drug which must reach 
high concentrations in prostate secretion and prostate tissue. Acute bacterial 
prostatitis can be a serious infection with a potential risk for urosepsis For 
iInitial treatment of severely ill patients, intravenous administration of high 
doses of bactericidal antimicrobials, such as broad-spectrum penicillins, 
third-generation cephalosporins or fluoroquinolones, is recommended in 
combination with an aminoglycoside. Use of piperacillin-tazobactam and meropenem 
is justified in presence of multiresistant gramnegative pathogens. The 
antibiotic treatment of chronic prostatitis is currently based on the use of 
fluoroquinolones that, given for 2 to 4 weeks, cured about 70% of men with 
chronic bacterial prostatitis. For the treatment of Chlamydial prostatitis 
macrolides were shown to be more effective than fluoroquinolones, whereas no 
differences were observed in microbiological and clinical efficacy between 
macrolides and tetracyclines for the treatment of infections caused by 
intracellular pathogens. Aminoglycosides and fosfomycin could be considered as a 
therapeutic alternative for the treatment of quinolone resistant prostatitis. 
Use of alpha-blockers in CP/CPPS patients with urinary symptoms and analgesics 
+/- non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID), in presence of pain 
demonstrated a reduction of symptoms reduction and an improvement of quality of 
life, although long term use of NSAID is limited by side effect profile. 
However, the multimodal therapeutic regimen by contemporary use of 
alphablockers, antibiotics and anti-inflammatory showed a better control of 
prostatitis symptoms than single drug treatment. Novel therapeutic substances 
for the treatment of pain, such as the cannabinoid anandamide would be highly 
interesting to test. An alternative for the treatment of chronic 
prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome is phytotherapy, as primary therapy or 
in association with other drugs. Quercetin, pollen extract, extract of Serenoa 
repens and other mixtures of herbal extracts showed a positive effect on 
symptoms and quality of life without side effects. The association of CP/CPPS 
with alterations of intestinal function has been described. Diet has its effects 
on inflammation by regulation of the composition of intestinal flora and direct 
action on the intestinal cells (sterile inflammation). Intestinal bacteria 
(microbiota) interacts with food influencing the metabolic, immune and 
inflammatory response of the organism. The intestinal microbiota has protective 
function against pathogenic bacteria, metabolic function by synthesis of 
vitamins, decomposition of bile acids and production of trophic factors 
(butyrate), and modulation of the intestinal immune system. The alteration of 
the microbiota is called "dysbiosis" causing invasive intestinal diseases 
pathologies (leaky gut syndrome and food intolerances, irritable bowel syndrome 
or chronic inflammatory bowel diseases) and correlating with numerous systemic 
diseases including acute and chronic prostatitis. Administration of live 
probiotics bacteria can be used to regulate the balance if intestinal flora. 
Sessions of hydrocolontherapy can represent an integration to this therapeutic 
approach. Finally, microbiological examination of sexual partners can offer 
supplementary information for treatment.

[Cardiovascular comorbidities in rheumatoid arthritis].

Approximately 80% of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) suffer from 
comorbidities including more than 50% from cardiovascular (CV) diseases. 
Inflammatory activity is the main factor connecting RA with atherosclerosis, 
coronary heart disease, stroke, thromboembolic events and heart failure. 
Altogether these affect RA patients twice as frequently as the general 
population and CV events are the major cause of death in RA. Besides 
inflammatory activity, which can be reduced or eliminated by optimal treatment 
and controlling the RA activity, traditional CV risk factors also contribute to 
the total CV risk. These risk factors, such as hypertension, diabetes and 
hyperlipidemia can also be found more frequently in RA patients but often remain 
undetected and untreated for a long time. Reducing this deficit means 
improvement of the life expectancy for RA patients, which has been demonstrated 
in studies by treatment of hyperlipoproteinemia. Among the drugs used for RA 
treatment non-steroidal antirheumatic drugs and glucocorticoids increase the CV 
risk if used in the long term. Hydroxychloroquine, methotrexate and biologics on 
the other hand are able to dramatically reduce the risk. Elevated CV risks of 
inflammatory rheumatic diseases are widely unknown in primary care. Therefore, 
the rheumatologist should be responsible for assessment of risk factors but in 
real life motivation to do so is relatively low. Some studies could demonstrate 
that using nursing-based standardized assessment is an excellent opportunity to 
reduce these deficits. Depending on the individual risk reassessment should take 
place every 1-5 years.

BACKGROUND: Cocaine and methamphetamine have similar withdrawal symptoms and 
many individuals concurrently use both substances; however, no measures 
concurrently assess withdrawal from multiple stimulants.
OBJECTIVES: This study's aim was to explore the Stimulant Selective Severity 
Assessment (SSSA), a modified version of the Cocaine Selective Severity 
Assessment (CSSA), in a sample of stimulant users to determine if it can assess 
withdrawal symptoms in users of one or more stimulants.
METHODS: Baseline data were analyzed from the STimulant Reduction Intervention 
using Dosed Exercise trial, a multisite randomized clinical trial that evaluated 
exercise versus health education on drug use outcomes in individuals with 
stimulant use disorders. Data were analyzed for internal consistency, construct 
validity, and scale dimensionality.
RESULTS: Internal consistency for the full sample was good (α = 0.81; N = 302), 
with similar alphas in Cocaine (0.81; n = 177) and Cocaine/Other Stimulant 
(0.82; n = 92) groups, but with much lower alpha for the group without cocaine 
use (Other Stimulant, i.e., primarily methamphetamine, α = 0.66; n = 32). 
Support for construct validity was evidenced by significant positive 
correlations (r = 0.17 to 0.67) with measures of stimulant craving, depressive 
symptoms, and pain. Four factors were revealed. Conclusions/Importance: The 
Stimulant Selective Severity Assessment is a new measure that can be used to 
assess withdrawal symptoms in users of cocaine or cocaine plus methamphetamine, 
but it should not be administered to users of methamphetamine only.

Towards a mission-oriented approach to cancer in Europe: an unmet need in cancer 
research policy.

Today, cancer is a significant challenge for society, healthcare systems and the 
growing number of affected patients and their families. This article argues that 
new paradigms and conditions for responsible science and innovation policy 
across the European Union (EU) require (i) the collective action of Research & 
Development institutions, (ii) a system approach to health systems, higher 
education and patient organizations, and (iii) new initiatives to encourage 
international cooperation across an enlarged Europe; no single country can 
successfully fight the disease(s) on its own. Recently, a cancer mission was 
proposed (Celis and Pavalski, ), the origins of which are rooted in the 
continuous efforts of the research community, cancer patient organizations, 
member states and the European Commission during nearly two decades to address 
the fragmentation and lack of coordination of European cancer research; these 
efforts led to the creation of Cancer Core Europe and Cancer Prevention Europe, 
consortia aimed at linking therapeutic and prevention geometries. Ultimately, 
the platform/infrastructure will be composed of networks of Comprehensive Cancer 
Centres and cancer research centres across Europe to reach the critical mass of 
expertise, patients and collaborative portfolio of projects that are necessary 
to promote science-driven and social innovations in the era of personalized 
(precision) cancer medicine. Employing a mission-oriented approach to achieve 
the goal of ensuring a long life expectancy for three out of four cancer 
patients by 2030 is likely to have a particularly positive impact on the way 
European citizens' value science and knowledge. It will change the lives of many 
families across Europe and beyond and should be oriented to ensure that Europe 
is at the forefront when it comes to quality of life. It is our collective 
responsibility to ensure that not a single person or region in Europe is left 
behind.

Drosophila suzukii Matsumura is an invasive species affecting berry crops and 
cherries throughout North America, South America, and Europe. Previous research 
suggests that in temperate climates, the overwintering success of D. suzukii is 
likely dependent on access to food, shelter, and adequate cold hardening. We 
performed a multi-state study under field conditions for two winters to 
determine whether D. suzukii sex, phenotype (summer-morphotype, 
winter-morphotype), and life stage (adults, pupae) affected survival over time 
while recording naturally-occurring spatial and temporal variation in 
temperature. Access to food was provided and the flies were buried under leaf 
litter. Baited traps were deployed to determine whether local populations of D. 
suzukii were active throughout the winter season. The duration of exposure, mean 
daily temperature, and cumulative time below freezing significantly affected 
survival. Below freezing, D. suzukii survival was significantly reduced, 
particularly in northern locations. In contrast, we observed sustained survival 
up to 10 wk in southern locations among adults and pupae. Biotic factors also 
significantly affected survival outcomes: female survival was greater than male 
survival, winter-morphotype survival was greater than summer-morphotype 
survival, and adult survival was greater than pupal survival. In the north, wild 
D. suzukii were captured only in early winter, while in the south they were 
found throughout the winter. These data suggest that although adult D. suzukii 
may overwinter in sheltered microclimates, this ability may be limited in 
regions where the ground temperature, or site of overwintering, falls below 
freezing for extended durations.

INTRODUCTION: Persons with schizophrenia experience high rates of cardio 
metabolic disorders and have a 20-25% shorter life expectancy than the general 
population. Health professionals led life style modification behavior programs 
have shown improvements, in managing aspects of metabolic problems. This study 
sought to identify the life style modification by exploring (1) facilitators 
that help persons with schizophrenia to adopt the lifestyle modification 
behaviors and (2) factors that help to adhere to life style modification 
behaviors.
METHODS: A qualitative study utilizing face to face interviews was conducted for 
five persons (n = 5) diagnosed as schizophrenia (ICD 10) and their caregivers 
(n = 13) receiving inpatient mental health services in a tertiary level 
psychiatry centre, in South India. Qualitative data was collected, organized and 
analyzed with thematic analysis using ATLAS.ti software.
RESULTS: The study results identified four major themes as facilitators. (1) 
Factors of increased self- confidence, and personal development. (2) The need 
for social support and conducive environment; (3) level of self motivation (4) 
encouragement from health professional and availability of health services. 
Participants believed that engaging with programs of physical activity, dietary 
modification, and illness support from family would motivate them to live more 
healthily.
CONCLUSION: Individuals with serious mental illnesses such as schizophrenia 
encounter physical health related problems, facilitators of lifestyle change 
behavior help them to adhere to change in their routine life. Lifestyle change 
interventions also motivate individuals to eat healthy diet and exercise 
regularly to prevent premature mortality.

Background: Rising life expectancy in Western societies is accompanied by a 
rising incidence of care dependency (CD) among older people. Objective: The aim 
of the study was to examine which health-related and social determinants were 
associated with CD. Method: We used cross-sectional data from the first 
follow-up (N = 1,699) of a prospective, population-based cohort study of older 
participants (≥70 years). CD was assessed if participants required substantial 
assistance in at least two activities of daily living for 90+ minutes daily. 
Multivariate logistic regressions were applied. Results: Participants' mean age 
was 82 years; 18.9% were care-dependent. CD was significantly associated with 
older age, urinary incontinence, stroke, falls, cancer, diabetes, education 
level, having no partner, limited mobility, and limited physical activity. 
Discussion: Our research highlights the importance of promoting mobility, even 
in care-dependent people. Further research should investigate the role of 
partnership in terms of the prevention and delay of CD.

BACKGROUND: Stepped care has been promoted for the management of mental 
disorders; however, there is no empirical evidence to support the 
cost-effectiveness of this approach for the treatment of anxiety disorders in 
youth.
METHOD: This economic evaluation was conducted within a randomised controlled 
trial comparing stepped care to a validated, manualised treatment in 281 young 
people, aged 7-17, with a diagnosed anxiety disorder. Intervention costs were 
determined from therapist records. Administrative data on medication and medical 
service use were used to determine additional health care costs during the study 
period. Parents also completed a resource use questionnaire to collect 
medications, services not captured in administrative data and parental lost 
productivity. Outcomes included participant-completed quality of life, Child 
Health Utility - nine-dimension and parent-completed Assessment of Quality of 
Life - eight-dimension to calculate quality-adjusted life years. Mean costs and 
quality-adjusted life years were compared between groups at 12-month follow-up.
RESULTS: Intervention delivery costs were significantly less for stepped care 
from the societal perspective (mean difference -$198, 95% confidence interval 
-$353 to -$19). Total combined costs were less for stepped care from both 
societal (-$1334, 95% confidence interval -$2386 to $510) and health sector 
(-$563, 95% confidence interval -$1353 to $643) perspectives but did not differ 
significantly from the manualised treatment. Youth and parental quality-adjusted 
life years were not significantly different between groups. Sensitivity analysis 
indicated that the results were robust.
CONCLUSION: For youth with anxiety, this three-step model provided comparable 
outcomes and total health sector costs to a validated face-to-face programme. 
However, it was less costly to deliver from a societal perspective, making it an 
attractive option for some parents. Future economic evaluations comparing 
various models of stepped care to treatment as usual are recommended.

BACKGROUND: To estimate the potential gains in health-adjusted life expectancy 
(HALE) after hypothetical elimination of four non-communicable diseases (NCDs) 
among Chinese elderly from 1990 to 2016, including cardiovascular diseases 
(CVD), cancers, chronic respiratory diseases (CRD) and diabetes mellitus (DM).
METHODS: Based on data from Global Burden of Disease 2016, we generated life 
table by gender using Sullivan method to calculate HALE. Disease-deleted method 
was used to calculate cause-elimination HALE, after hypothetical elimination of 
specific diseases.
RESULTS: From 1990 to 2016, HALE increased for all age groups. After hypothetic 
eliminating the four main NCDs, potential gain in HALE by CVD, DM and cancers 
increased while by CRD decreased from 1990 to 2016 for both genders. Among four 
main NCDs, potential gain in HALE after eliminating CVD was largest and 
increased most for both genders. Although elimination of DM led to the smallest 
gain in HALE, the increasing speed of gain in HALE by DM was faster than that by 
CVD and cancers from 1990 to 2016.
CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the potential gains in HALE of NCDs among 
Chinese elderly from 1990 to 2016. HALE of Chinese elderly could further 
increase from the reduction of NCDs. Control measures and targeted prevention 
should be carried out.

BACKGROUND: The selection of radiation therapy dose fractionation schedules for 
bone metastases is often based on the estimation of life expectancy. Therefore, 
accurate prognosis prediction is an important issue. It is reported that the 
Katagiri scoring system can be used to predict the survival of patients with 
bone metastases. We aimed to assess prognostic factors and validate the Katagiri 
scoring system in patients who were treated with radiation therapy for bone 
metastases.
MATERIALS/METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed data of all patients who were 
treated with radiation therapy for bone metastases between 2004 and 2013. Age, 
sex, Karnofsky performance status (KPS), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 
performance status (ECOG PS), primary site (lesions and characteristics), 
visceral metastases, laboratory data, previous chemotherapy, and multiple bone 
metastases were analyzed for associations with overall survival (OS). Katagiri 
scores were calculated for each patient and were used to compare OS.
RESULTS: Out of the 616 patients included in this analysis, 574 had died and 42 
remained alive. The median follow-up time for survivors was 42 months. 
Univariate analysis revealed that age (P = 0.604) and multiple bone metastases 
(P = 0.691) were not significantly associated with OS. Multivariate analysis 
revealed that sex, ECOG PS, KPS, primary characteristics, visceral metastases, 
laboratory data, and previous chemotherapy were significantly associated with 
OS. The survival rates at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months, categorized by Katagiri 
score, were as follows: score 0-3, 94.4, 77.8, and 61.1%, respectively; score 
4-6, 67.7, 48.7, and 31.2%, respectively; and score 7-10, 39.1, 22.1, and 9.0%, 
respectively (P < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Sex, ECOG PS, KPS, primary characteristics, visceral metastases, 
laboratory data, and previous chemotherapy were significant predictors of 
survival in patients with bone metastases. The Katagiri scoring system was

BACKGROUND: Increased-dose bleomycin, etoposide, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, 
vincristine, procarbazine, and prednisone (BEACOPPescalated) improves 
progression-free survival in patients with advanced Hodgkin lymphoma compared 
with doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine (ABVD), but is 
associated with increased risks of haematological toxicity, secondary 
myelodysplasia or leukaemia, and infertility. We investigated whether PET 
monitoring during treatment could allow dose de-escalation by switching regimen 
(BEACOPPescalated to ABVD) in early responders without loss of disease control 
compared with standard treatment without PET monitoring.
METHODS: AHL2011 is a randomised, non-inferiority, phase 3 study done in 90 
centres across Belgium and France. Eligible patients were aged 16-60 years and 
had newly diagnosed Hodgkin lymphoma, excluding nodular lymphocyte predominant 
subtype, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status score less 
than 3, a life expectancy of at least 3 months, an Ann Arbor disease stage III, 
IV, or IIB with mediastinum-to-thorax ratio of 0·33 or greater than or 
extranodal localisation, and had received no previous treatment for Hodgkin 
lymphoma. Randomisation was unmasked and done centrally by the permuted block 
method. Patients were randomly assigned to standard treatment (BEACOPPescalated 
given every 21 days for six cycles) or PET-driven treatment. All patients 
received two cycles of upfront BEACOPPescalated, after which PET assessment was 
done (PET2). In the standard treatment group, PET2 patients completed two 
additional cycles of BEACOPPescalated induction therapy irrespective of PET2 
findings. In the PET-driven treatment group, patients with positive PET2 scans 
received the further two cycles of BEACOPPescalated and those with a negative 
PET2 scan switched to two cycles of ABVD for the remaining induction therapy. In 
both treatment groups, PET at the end of induction therapy was used to decide 
whether to continue with consolidation therapy in those with negative scans or 
start salvage therapy in patients with positive scans (either two cycles of ABVD 
in PET2-negative patients in the PET-driven arm or two cycles of 
BEACOPPescalated). BEACOPPescalated consisted of bleomycin 10 mg/m2 and 
vincristine 1·4 mg/m2 intravenously on day 8, etoposide 200 mg/m2 intravenously 
on days 1-3, doxorubicin 35 mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide 1250 mg/m2 intravenously 
on day 1, 100 mg/m2 oral procarbazine on days 1-7, and 40 mg/m2 oral prednisone 
on days 1-14. ABVD was given every 28 days (doxorubicin 25 mg/m2, bleomycin 10 
mg/m2, vinblastine 6 mg/m2, and dacarbazine 375 mg/m2 intravenously on days 1 
and 15). The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed progression-free 
survival. Non-inferiority analyses were done by intention to treat and per 
protocol. The study had a non-inferiority margin of 10%, to show non-inferiority 
of PET-guided treatment versus standard care with 80% power and an alpha of 2·5% 
(one-sided). This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number 
NCT01358747.
FINDINGS: From May 19, 2011, to April 29, 2014, 823 patients were enrolled-413 
in the standard care group and 410 in the PET-driven group. 346 (84%) of 410 
patients in the PET-driven treatment group were assigned to receive ABVD and 51 
(12%) to continue receiving BEACOPPescalated after PET2. With a median follow-up 
of 50·4 months (IQR 42·9-59·3), 5-year progression-free survival by intention to 
treat was 86·2%, 95% CI 81·6-89·8 in the standard treatment group versus 85·7%, 
81·4-89·1 in the PET-driven treatment group (hazard ratio [HR] 1·084, 95% CI 
0·737-1·596; p=0·65) and per protocol the values were 86·7%, 95% CI 81·9-90·3 
and 85·4%, 80·7-89·0, respectively (HR 1·144, 0·758-1·726; p=0·74). The most 
common grade 3-4 adverse events were leucopenia (381 [92%] in the standard 
treatment group and 387 [95%] in the PET-driven treatment group), neutropenia 
(359 [87%] and 366 [90%]), anaemia (286 [69%] vs 114 [28%]), thrombocytopenia 
(271 [66%] and 163 [40%]), febrile neutropenia (145 [35%] and 93 [23%]), 
infections (88 [22%] and 47 [11%]), and gastrointestinal disorders (49 [11%] and 
48 [11%]). Serious adverse events related to treatment were reported in 192 
(47%) patients in the standard treatment group and 114 (28%) in the PET-driven 
treatment group, including infections (84 [20%] of 412 vs 50 [12%] of 407) and 
febrile neutropenia (21 [5%] vs 23 [6%]). Six (1%) patients in the standard care 
group died from treatment-related causes (two from septic shock, two from 
pneumopathy, one from heart failure, and one from acute myeloblastic leukaemia), 
as did two (<1%) in the PET-driven treatment group (one from septic shock and 
one from acute myeloblastic leukaemia).
INTERPRETATION: PET after two cycles of induction BEACOPPescalated chemotherapy 
safely guided treatment in patients with advanced Hodgkin lymphoma and allowed 
the use of ABVD in early responders without impairing disease control and 
reduced toxicities. PET staging allowed accurate monitoring of treatment in this 
trial and could be considered as a strategy for the routine management of 
patients with advanced Hodgkin lymphoma.

Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is the most common genetic obesity syndrome, with 
associated learning difficulties, neuroendocrine deficits, and behavioural and 
psychiatric problems. As the life expectancy of individuals with PWS increases, 
there is concern that alterations in brain structure associated with the 
syndrome, as a direct result of absent expression of PWS genes, and its 
metabolic complications and hormonal deficits, might cause early onset of 
physiological and brain aging. In this study, a machine learning approach was 
used to predict brain age based on grey matter (GM) and white matter (WM) maps 
derived from structural neuroimaging data using T1-weighted magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI) scans. Brain-predicted age difference (brain-PAD) scores, 
calculated as the difference between chronological age and brain-predicted age, 
are designed to reflect deviations from healthy brain aging, with higher 
brain-PAD scores indicating premature aging. Two separate adult cohorts 
underwent brain-predicted age calculation. The main cohort consisted of adults 
with PWS (n = 20; age mean 23.1 years, range 19.8-27.7; 70.0% male; body mass 
index (BMI) mean 30.1 kg/m2, 21.5-47.7; n = 19 paternal chromosome 15q11-13 
deletion) and age- and sex-matched controls (n = 40; age 22.9 years, 19.6-29.0; 
65.0% male; BMI 24.1 kg/m2, 19.2-34.2) adults (BMI PWS vs. control P = .002). 
Brain-PAD was significantly greater in PWS than controls (effect size mean ± SEM 
+7.24 ± 2.20 years [95% CI 2.83, 11.63], P = .002). Brain-PAD remained 
significantly greater in PWS than controls when restricting analysis to a 
sub-cohort matched for BMI consisting of n = 15 with PWS with BMI range 
21.5-33.7 kg/m2, and n = 29 controls with BMI 21.7-34.2 kg/m2 (effect size 
+5.51 ± 2.56 years [95% CI 3.44, 10.38], P = .037). In the PWS group, brain-PAD 
scores were not associated with intelligence quotient (IQ), use of hormonal and 
psychotropic medications, nor severity of repetitive or disruptive behaviours. A 
24.5 year old man (BMI 36.9 kg/m2) with PWS from a SNORD116 microdeletion also 
had increased brain PAD of 12.87 years, compared to 0.84 ± 6.52 years in a 
second control adult cohort (n = 95; age mean 34.0 years, range 19.9-55.5; 38.9% 
male; BMI 28.7 kg/m2, 19.1-43.1). This increase in brain-PAD in adults with PWS 
indicates abnormal brain structure that may reflect premature brain aging or 
abnormal brain development. The similar finding in a rare patient with a 
SNORD116 microdeletion implicates a potential causative role for this PWS region 
gene cluster in the structural brain abnormalities associated primarily with the 
syndrome and/or its complications. Further longitudinal neuroimaging studies are 
needed to clarify the natural history of this increase in brain age in PWS, its 
relationship with obesity, and whether similar findings are seen in those with 
PWS from maternal uniparental disomy.

OBJECTIVES: Low/middle-income countries, particularly Small Island Developing 
States, face many challenges including providing good palliative care and choice 
in place of care and death, but evidence of the circumstances of dying to inform 
policy is often lacking. This study explores where people die in Trinidad and 
Tobago and examines and describes the factors associated with place of death.
METHODS: A population-level analysis of routinely collected death certificate 
and supplementary health data where the unit of analysis was the recorded death. 
We followed the Reporting of Studies Conducted Using Observational Routinely 
Collected Health Data reporting guidelines, an extension of Strengthening the 
Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology, on a deidentified data set 
on decedents (n=10 221) extracted from International Statistical Classification 
of Diseases version 10 coded death records for the most recent available year, 
2010.
RESULTS: Of all deaths, 55.4% occurred in a government hospital and 29.7% in a 
private home; 65.3% occurred in people aged 60 years and older. Cardiovascular 
disease (23.6%), malignancies (15.5%) and diabetes mellitus (14.7%) accounted 
for over half of all deaths. Dying at home becomes more likely with increasing 
age (70-89 years (OR 1.91, 95% CI 1.73 to 2.10) and 90-highest (OR 3.63, 95% CI 
3.08 to 4.27)), and less likely for people with malignancies (OR 0.85, 95% CI 
0.74 to 0.97), cerebrovascular disease (OR 0.61, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.72) and 
respiratory disease (OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.91).
CONCLUSION: Place of death is influenced by age, sex, race/ethnicity, underlying 
cause of death and urbanisation. There is inequality between ethnic groups 
regarding place of care and death; availability, affordability and access to 
end-of-life care in different settings require attention.

Incorporating Tumor Characteristics to Maximize 21-Gene Assay Utility: A 
Cost-Effectiveness Analysis.

Wang SY, Chen T, Dang W, Mougalian SS, Evans SB, Gross CP.

Background: Literature suggests that Oncotype DX (ODX) is cost-effective. These 
studies, however, tend to ignore clinical characteristics and have not 
incorporated population-based data regarding the distribution of ODX results 
across different clinical risk groups. Accordingly, this study assessed the 
cost-effectiveness of ODX across strata of clinical risk groups using 
population-based ODX data. Methods: We created state-transition models to 
calculate costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained over the lifetime 
for women with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive, HER2-negative, lymph 
node-negative breast cancer from a US payer perspective. Using the Connecticut 
Tumor Registry, we classified the 2,245 patients diagnosed in 2011 through 2013 
into 3 clinical risk groups according to the PREDICT model, a risk calculator 
developed by the National Health Service in the United Kingdom. Within each risk 
group, we then determined the recurrence score (RS) distributions (<18, 18-30, 
and ≥31). Other input parameters were derived from the literature. Uncertainty 
was assessed using deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. 
Results: Approximately 82.5%, 11.9%, and 5.6% of our sample were in the PREDICT 
low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups, respectively. When combining these 3 
groups, ODX had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $62,200 per 
QALY for patients aged 60 years. The ICERs, however, differed across clinical 
risk groups, ranging from $124,600 per QALY in the low-risk group, to $28,700 
per QALY in the intermediate-risk group, to $15,700 per QALY in the high-risk 
group. Results were sensitive to patient age: the ICER for patients aged 45 to 
75 years ranged from $77,100 to $344,600 per QALY in the PREDICT low-risk group, 
and was lower than $100,000 per QALY in the intermediate- and high-risk groups. 
Conclusions: ODX is not cost-effective for women with clinical low-risk breast 
cancer, which constitutes most patients with ER-positive disease.

A Cohort Comparison of Lifespan After Age 100 in Denmark and Sweden: Are Only 
the Oldest Getting Older?

Although Denmark and Sweden have close cultural and historical ties, lifespans 
for Danes have generally been lower than those of Swedes. Recent improvements in 
Danish mortality after a period of stagnation have led to the suspicion that 
there may be positive trends at the very high ages at death within that 
population and that these trends could be quite different from those observed in 
Sweden. Although the mean ages at death for Danish and Swedish centenarians have 
been relatively constant at about 102 years for the cohorts born 1870-1904, the 
oldest-old in Denmark have been getting older, but no evidence has suggested any 
increase in lifespan for Swedes. Using quantile regression, we show that Danish 
centenarian lifespans in the 90th percentile have been lengthening, with those 
in 94th percentile (6 % longest-lived individuals) having a trend that is 
statistically significant at the 5 % level. We demonstrate that the increase 
observed is not due to the increasing sizes of birth cohorts and thus must be 
due to improving survival among this select top tier. We postulate that this 
super-select group in Denmark is best able to take advantage of the factors 
driving mortality reduction, whereas the majority of centenarians are not.

AIMS: To project the number of people with Type 2 diabetes in Germany between 
2015 and 2040.
METHODS: Based on data from 65 million insurees of the German statutory health 
insurance, we projected the age-specific prevalence of diabetes using 
mathematical relations between prevalence, incidence rate and mortality. We 
compared several scenarios regarding temporal trends in the incidence and 
mortality rate. The projected age-specific prevalence was applied to the 
projected age structure of the German population between 2015 and 2040 to 
calculate the number of people with Type 2 diabetes.
RESULTS: Application of current age-specific prevalence estimates to the 
projected age structure in 2040, although ignoring temporal trends in incidence 
and mortality, yielded an increase in the number of Type 2 diabetes cases from 
6.9 million in 2015 to 8.3 million (+21%) in 2040. More realistic scenarios that 
account for decreasing mortality rates and different trends in the incidence 
rates project between 10.7 million (+54%) and 12.3 million (+77%) Type 2 
diabetes cases in 2040.
CONCLUSIONS: For the first time, we projected the number of future Type 2 
diabetes cases for the whole adult population in Germany. The results indicate a 
relative increase in the number of Type 2 diabetes cases of between 54% and 77% 
from 2015 to 2040. Temporal trends in the incidence rate are the main drivers of 
this increase. Simply applying current age-specific prevalence to the future age 
structure probably underestimates the future number of Type 2 diabetes cases.
