However, because LGG patients live longer, they must be cognitively and 
affectively able to make long-term projects. Preservation of higher-order 
functions should be considered systematically in LGG surgery by means of awake 
cognitive/emotional mapping and monitoring.Expert opinion: The aim is to 
incorporate recent advances in neurosciences, which proposed revisited models of 
cerebral processing relying on a meta-network perspective, into the pre-, intra- 
and postoperative procedure. In this connectomal approach, brain functions 
result from complex interactions within and between neural networks. This 
improved understanding of a constant instability of the neural system allows a 
better cognitive/emotional assessment before and after each treatment over 
years, in order to preserve personality and adaptive behavior for each LGG 
patient, based on his/her own definition of quality of life. It is time to 
create oncological neurosciences.

Sexual activity and/or reproduction are associated with a doubling of life 
expectancy in the long-lived rodent genus Fukomys. To investigate the molecular 
mechanisms underlying this phenomenon, we analyzed 636 RNA-seq samples across 15 
tissues. This analysis suggests that changes in the regulation of the 
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal stress axis play a key role regarding the 
extended life expectancy of reproductive vs. non-reproductive mole-rats. This is 
substantiated by a corpus of independent evidence. In accordance with previous 
studies, the up-regulation of the proteasome and so-called 'anti-aging 
molecules', for example, dehydroepiandrosterone, is linked with enhanced 
lifespan. On the other hand, several of our results are not consistent with 
knowledge about aging of short-lived model organisms. For example, we found the 
up-regulation of the insulin-like growth factor 1/growth hormone axis and 
several other anabolic processes to be compatible with a considerable lifespan 
prolongation. These contradictions question the extent to which findings from 
short-lived species can be transferred to longer-lived ones.

INTRODUCTION: BAY 94-9027 (damoctocog alfa pegol; an extended half-life 
PEGylated recombinant factor VIII [FVIII]) demonstrated efficacy and safety in 
previously treated paediatric patients (PTPs) aged <12 years with severe 
haemophilia A in the PROTECT VIII Kids study (NCT01775618).
AIM: To evaluate the long-term safety of BAY 94-9027 in PTPs aged <12 years at 
enrolment.
METHODS: In the PROTECT VIII Kids study, boys <12 years with severe haemophilia 
A were enrolled in two age cohorts (6-<12 years and <6 years) and treated 
prophylactically twice weekly, every 5 days or every 7 days, with BAY 94-9027 
for ≥50 exposure days (EDs). Patients who had completed ≥50 EDs and ≥6 months in 
the main study or 12-week safety expansion study were eligible to participate in 
the extension. Primary safety variable was frequency of inhibitor development; 
main efficacy variable was annualised bleeding rate (ABR).
RESULTS: Of 73 PTPs from the main/expansion studies, 59 (81%) entered the 
extension phase for a median (range) duration of 5.0 (0.4-5.9) years. Overall, 
39 patients completed ≥5 years of treatment. No patients developed FVIII 
inhibitors/anti-PEG antibodies, and two patients aged <6 years discontinued. 
Median ABR for total bleeds was 1.5 (<6 years) and 1.9 (6-<12 years). Total ABR 
improved in the extension vs. the main study. In the last 12 months of 
treatment, median spontaneous ABR was 0.0 in both age groups.
CONCLUSIONS: BAY 94-9027 showed long-term safety and efficacy for the prevention 
and treatment of bleeds in younger and older paediatric patients with severe 
haemophilia A.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the 1-year cost-effectiveness between three different 
initial treatment strategies in autoantibody-negative RA patients, according to 
2010 criteria.
METHODS: For this analysis we selected all RA patients within the intermediate 
probability stratum of the treatment in the Rotterdam Early Arthritis Cohort 
(tREACH) trial. The tREACH had a treat-to-target approach, aiming for low DAS 
<2.4, and treatment adjustments could occur every 3 months. Initial treatment 
strategies consisted of MTX 25 mg/week (initial MTX, iMTX), iHCQ 400 mg/day or 
an oral glucocorticoids tapering scheme without DMARDs (iGCs). Data on 
quality-adjusted life-years, measured with the European Quality of Life 
5-Dimensions 3 Levels (EQ-5D-3L), healthcare and productivity costs were used.
RESULTS: Average quality-adjusted life-years (s.d.), for iMTX, iHCQ and iGCs 
were respectively 0.71 (0.14), 0.73 (0.14) and 0.71 (0.15). The average total 
costs (s.d.) for iMTX, iHCQ and iGCs were, respectively, €10 832 (14.763), 
€11 208 (12.801) and €10 502 (11.973). Healthcare costs were mainly determined 
by biological costs, which were significantly lower in the iHCQ group compared 
with iGCs (P < 0.05). However, costs due to presenteeism were the highest in the 
iHCQ group (55%) followed by iMTX (27%) and iGCs (18%). The incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios did not differ between treatment strategies. At a 
willingness-to-pay level of €50 000, the Dutch threshold for reimbursement of 
medical care, iHCQ had the highest probability (38.7%) of being cost-effective, 
followed by iGCs (31.1%) and iMTX (30.2%).
CONCLUSION: iHCQ had the lowest healthcare and highest productivity costs, 
resulting in a non-significant incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. However, 
iHCQ had the highest chance of being cost-effective at the Dutch 
willingness-to-pay threshold for healthcare reimbursement. Therefore, we believe 
that iHCQ is a good alternative to iMTX in autoantibody-negative RA patients, 
but validation is needed.

BACKGROUND: Early hypercapnia is common in patients with acute respiratory 
distress syndrome (ARDS) and is associated with increased mortality. 
Fluctuations of carbon dioxide have been associated with adverse neurological 
outcome in patients with severe respiratory failure requiring extracorporeal 
organ support. The aim of this study was to investigate whether early 
hypercapnia is associated with impaired cerebrovascular autoregulation during 
the acute phase of ARDS.
METHODS: Between December 2018 and November 2019, patients who fulfilled the 
Berlin criteria for ARDS, were enrolled. Patients with a history of central 
nervous system disorders, cerebrovascular disease, chronic hypercapnia, or a 
life expectancy of less than 24 h were excluded from study participation. During 
the acute phase of ARDS, cerebrovascular autoregulation was measured over two 
time periods for at least 60 min. Based on the values of mean arterial blood 
pressure and near-infrared spectroscopy, a cerebral autoregulation index (COx) 
was calculated. The time with impaired cerebral autoregulation was calculated 
for each measurement and was compared between patients with and without early 
hypercapnia [defined as an arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide 
(PaCO2) ≥ 50 mmHg with a corresponding arterial pH < 7.35 within the first 24 h 
of ARDS diagnosis].
RESULTS: Of 66 patients included, 117 monitoring episodes were available. The 
mean age of the study population was 58.5 ± 16 years. 10 patients (15.2%) had 
mild, 28 (42.4%) moderate, and 28 (42.4%) severe ARDS. Nineteen patients (28.8%) 
required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Early hypercapnia was present in 
39 patients (59.1%). Multivariable analysis did not show a significant 
association between early hypercapnia and impaired cerebrovascular 
autoregulation (B = 0.023 [95% CI - 0.054; 0.100], p = 0.556). Hypocapnia during 
the monitoring period was significantly associated with impaired cerebrovascular 
autoregulation [B = 0.155 (95% CI 0.014; 0.296), p = 0.032].
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that moderate permissive hypercapnia during the 
acute phase of ARDS has no adverse effect on cerebrovascular autoregulation and 
may be tolerated to a certain extent to achieve low tidal volumes. In contrast, 
episodes of hypocapnia may compromise cerebral blood flow regulation. Trial

BACKGROUND: Rivaroxaban is a selective inhibitor of coagulation factor Xa and 
its combination with aspirin showed better outcomes in the prevention of 
recurrent cardiovascular disease than aspirin alone.
OBJECTIVE: This analysis aimed to economically compare the cost effectiveness of 
rivaroxaban (2.5 mg twice daily) plus aspirin (100 mg once daily) with aspirin 
alone in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) or peripheral artery 
disease (PAD) and related subgroups.
METHODS: The analysis simulates the perspective of the Italian National 
Healthcare Service and used a state-transition decision Markov model. Clinical 
efficacy data and health events risks were gathered from the COMPASS trial. 
Health outcomes and costs (in Euros) were evaluated over a lifetime horizon and 
were discounted at 3.5% per annum. Direct healthcare costs entered the analysis. 
Results were expressed in terms of incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), 
defined as cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. One-way 
deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed.
RESULTS: For the CAD or PAD population, rivaroxaban plus aspirin was more 
effective and costly compared with aspirin alone. Incremental costs and efficacy 
produced an ICER of €16,522 per QALY gained. Analyses found similar trends for 
the PAD and CAD groups, with respective ICERs of €8003 and €18,599, while ICERs 
for the other groups were lower than €13,000 per QALY. Sensitivity analyses 
confirmed these findings.
CONCLUSION: Compared with aspirin alone, rivaroxaban plus aspirin is cost 
effective in preventing recurrent cardiovascular events in all patients with CAD 
or PAD, from the Italian perspective. These results could help clinicians and 
decision makers to develop improved strategies for cardiovascular disease 
prevention.

Healthcare costs have increased in developing countries over the last few 
decades, mostly due to the escalation in average life expectancy and the 
concomitant increase in age-related disorders. To address this issue, widespread 
research is now being undertaken across the globe with the aim of finding a way 
of increasing healthy aging. A number of potential interventions have already 
shown promise, including lifestyle changes and the use of natural products or 
pharmaceuticals that may delay the onset of diseases associated with the aging 
process. In parallel, a number of potential biomarkers have already been 
identified that can be used for assessing risk of developing age-associated 
disorders and for monitoring response to therapeutic interventions. This review 
describes the most recent advances towards the goal of achieving healthier aging 
with fewer disabilities that may lead to enhanced quality of life and reduced 
healthcare costs around the world.

INTRODUCTION: Total knee replacement (TKR) is a surgical procedure that is being 
increasingly performed as a result of population aging and the increased average 
human life expectancy in South Korea. Consistent with the growing number of TKR 
procedures, the number of patients seeking acupuncture for relief from adverse 
effects, effective pain management, and the enhancement of rehabilitative 
therapy effects and bodily function after TKR has also been increasing. Thus, an 
objective examination of the evidence regarding the safety and efficacy of 
acupuncture treatments is essential. The aim of this study is to verify the 
hypothesis that the concurrent use of acupuncture treatment and usual care after 
TKR is more effective, safe, and cost-effective for the relief of TKR symptoms 
than usual care therapy alone.
METHODS/DESIGN: This is an open-label, parallel, assessor-blinded randomized 
controlled trial that includes 50 patients with TKR. After screening the 
patients and receiving informed consent, the patients are divided into two 
groups (usual care + acupuncture group and usual care group); the patients will 
then undergo TKR surgery and will be hospitalized for 2 weeks. The patients will 
receive a total of 8 acupuncture treatments over 2 weeks after surgery and will 
be followed up at 3, 4, and 12 weeks after the end of the intervention. The 
primary outcome is assessed using the Korean version of the Western Ontario and 
McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (K-WOMAC), and the secondary outcome is 
measured using the Numerical Rating Scale (NRS), Risk of Fall, and Range of 
Motion (ROM). Moreover, the cost per quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) is 
adopted as a primary economic outcome for economic evaluation, and the cost per 
NRS is adopted as a secondary economic outcome.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This trial has received complete ethical approval from 
the Ethics Committee of Catholic Kwandong University International St. Mary's 
Hospital (IS17ENSS0063). We intend to submit the results to a peer-reviewed 
journal and/or conferences.

BACKGROUND: Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) affects millions of people and 
compromises quality of life. Critical limb ischemia (CLI), which is the most 
advanced stage of PAD, can cause nonhealing ulcers and strong chronic pain, and 
it shortens the patients' life expectancy. Cell-based angiogenic therapies are 
becoming a real therapeutic approach to treat CLI. Pericytes are cells that 
surround vascular endothelial cells to reinforce vessel integrity and regulate 
local blood pressure and metabolism. In the past decade, researchers also found 
that pericytes may function as stem or progenitor cells in the body, showing the 
potential to differentiate into several cell types. We investigated the gene 
expression profiles of pericytes during the early stages of limb ischemia, as 
well as the alterations in pericyte subpopulations to better understand the 
behavior of pericytes under ischemic conditions.
METHODS: In this study, we used a hindlimb ischemia model to mimic CLI in 
C57/BL6 mice and explore the role of pericytes in regeneration. To this end, 
muscle pericytes were isolated at different time points after the induction of 
ischemia. The phenotypes and transcriptomic profiles of the pericytes isolated 
at these discrete time points were assessed using flow cytometry and RNA 
sequencing.
RESULTS: Ischemia triggered proliferation and migration and upregulated the 
expression of myogenesis-related transcripts in pericytes. Furthermore, the 
transcriptomic analysis also revealed that pericytes induce or upregulate the 
expression of a number of cytokines with effects on endothelial cells, leukocyte 
chemoattraction, or the activation of inflammatory cells.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide a database that will improve our understanding 
of skeletal muscle pericyte biology under ischemic conditions, which may be 
useful for the development of novel pericyte-based cell and gene therapies.

Single-agent alemtuzumab remains the first line of therapy for the 
treatment-naive and relapsed/refractory patients. Prospective clinical trials 
are difficult to conduct given that these patients have a short life expectancy 
after the initial diagnosis. As a result, researchers are implementing the use 
of targeted therapies in vitro and ex vivo followed by in vivo trials on a small 
subset of patients which are reviewed here. Newer approaches in the treatment of 
T-PLL are developing based on recognizing the cytogenetic phenotype of each 
patient and targeting the identified defective genes that are usually involved 
in the cell cycle regulation such as protooncogenes, tumor suppressors, and 
deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) repair genes. These could potentially redirect the 
management in the near future and improve the overall survival (OS) and the 
progression-free survival (PFS) for these patients.

Mucopolysaccharidosis type IVA (MPS IVA) is an autosomal recessive lysosomal 
storage disorder caused by mutations in the GALNS gene, which leads to deficient 
activity of N-acetylglucosamine-6-sulfate sulfatase. MPS IVA patients usually 
present skeletal dysplasia, coarse features, short stature, airway obstruction, 
cervical spinal cord compression, dental abnormalities, and cardiac valvular 
alterations. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with elosulfase alfa is the only 
disease-specific treatment available for MPS IVA patients and has been shown to 
improve important clinical and biochemical parameters; however, little is known 
about the effects of ERT interruption on these patients. In this article, we 
report the impact of different periods of treatment interruption on clinical 
outcomes of 18 MPS IVA patients. All MPS IVA patients included in this case 
series were treated and followed up in Latin American centers and had been 
receiving elosulfase alfa intravenously for at least 8 months before ERT was 
interrupted. Different clinical parameters and assessments were evaluated at 
variable timepoints following therapy interruption. Altogether, our report 
indicates that some beneficial ERT effects in MPS IVA patients may last after 
different periods of treatment interruption, as cardiac and respiratory function 
improvements. However, worsening of important disease parameters after ERT 
interruption, such as the increase in uGAGs, pain, joint and skeletal aspects, 
and surgery indications suggests that treatment discontinuation should be 
avoided in order to maintain the disease as stable as possible, aiming to 
optimize these patients' life expectancy and quality of life.

BACKGROUND: This study aimed to estimate the cost-utility of stereotactic body 
radiotherapy (SBRT) plus cetuximab for patients with previously irradiated 
recurrent squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.
METHODS: We constructed a Markov health-state transition model to simulate costs 
and clinical outcomes of recurrent squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. 
Model parameters were derived from the published literature and the National 
Health Insurance Administration reimbursement price list. Incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio and the net monetary benefit were calculated from a 
health payer perspective. The impact of uncertainty was modeled with one-way and 
probabilistic sensitivity analyses.
RESULTS: In the base-case, SBRT plus cetuximab compared to SBRT alone resulted 
in an ICER of NT$ 840,455 per QALY gained. In the one-way sensitivity analysis, 
the utility of progression-free state for patients treated with SBRT plus 
cetuximab or SBRT alone and the cost of progression-free survival for SBRT+Cet 
were the most sensitive parameters in the model. Probabilistic sensitivity 
analysis showed that the probability of cost-effectiveness at a 
willingness-to-pay threshold of NT$ 2,252,340 per QALY was 100% for SBRT plus 
cetuximab but 0% for SBRT alone.
CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that SBRT+Cet was cost-effective and benefited 
patients with previously irradiated rSCCHN.

BACKGROUND: Multiligament knee injuries, though rare, can be profoundly 
disabling. Surgeons disagree about when to initiate rehabilitation after 
surgical reconstruction due to the conflicting priorities of postoperative 
stability and motion.
QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: (1) Does early or late initiation of physical therapy after 
multiligament knee surgery result in fewer postoperative manipulations? (2) Does 
early versus late physical therapy compromise stability postoperatively? (3) 
Does early initiation of physical therapy result in improved patient-reported 
outcomes, as measured by the Multi-ligament Quality of Life (ML-QOL) score?
METHODS: Between 2011 and 2016, 36 adults undergoing multiligament repair or 
reconstruction were prospectively enrolled in a randomized controlled trial and 
randomized 1:1 to either early rehabilitation or late rehabilitation after 
surgery. Eligibility included those with an injury to the posterior cruciate 
ligament (PCL) and at least one other ligament, as well as the ability to 
participate in early rehabilitation. Patients who were obtunded or unable to 
adhere to the protocols for other reasons were excluded. Early rehabilitation 
consisted of initiating a standardized physical therapy protocol on 
postoperative day 1 involving removal of the extension splint for quadriceps 
activation and ROM exercises. Late rehabilitation consisted of full-time 
immobilization in an extension splint for 3 weeks. Following this 3-week period, 
both groups engaged in the same standardized physical therapy protocol. All 
surgical reconstructions were performed at a single center by one of two 
fellowship-trained sports orthopaedic surgeons, and all involved allograft 
Achilles tendon PCL reconstruction. When possible, hamstring autograft was used 
for ACL and medial collateral ligament reconstructions, whereas lateral 
collateral ligament and posterolateral reconstruction was performed primarily 
with allograft. The primary outcome was the number of patients undergoing 
manipulation during the first 6 months. Additional outcomes added after trial 
registration were patient-reported quality of life scores (ML-QOL) at 1 year and 
an objective assessment of laxity through a physical examination and stress 
radiographs at 1 year. One patient from each group was not assessed for laxity 
or ROM at 1 year, and one patient from each group did not complete the ML-QOL 
questionnaires. No patient crossover was observed.
RESULTS: With the numbers available, there was no difference in the use of knee 
manipulation during the first 6 months between the rehabilitation groups: 1 of 
18 patients in the early group and 4 of 18 patients in the late group (p = 
0.34). Similarly, there were no differences in knee ROM, stability, or 
patient-reported quality of life (ML-QOL) between the groups at 1 year.
CONCLUSION: With the numbers available in this study, we were unable to 
demonstrate a difference between early and late knee rehabilitation with regard 
to knee stiffness, laxity, or patient-reported quality of life outcomes. The 
results of this small, randomized pilot study suggest a potential role for early 
rehabilitation after multiligament reconstruction for knee dislocation, which 
should be further explored in larger multi-institutional studies.
LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level II, therapeutic study.

BACKGROUND: Anthropogenic climate change is a phenomenon that is becoming 
increasingly important in many areas such as economics and politics, but it also 
has great scientific relevance due to the important effects it has on people's 
health, the relationship between climate change and Health has caused an 
increase in the production of scientific knowledge about this topic and 
therefore the objective of this article was to provide an updated review of the 
open access scientific evidence, in the last five years, related to the effects 
of anthropogenic climate change in Public Health.
METHODS: A systematic review was conducted, in Spanish and English, in four 
non-subscription databases; using online thesaurus terms, the inclusion and 
exclusion criteria, an evaluation with the STROBE checklist were applied.
RESULTS: Finally, 18 publications were analyzed. These showed: the relationship 
between extreme events, such as heat and cold waves, with the increase in 
mortality from various causes, especially from heart attacks; the alteration of 
the rainy and drought periods as a determinant of various infectious diseases; 
air pollution from emissions derived from the use of fossil fuels with the 
reduction of 2.9 years in world life expectancy. In addition, other authors 
reported predictions from climate alterations in health risks; and perceptions 
of the population, and decision-makers about the impacts of climate change on 
Public Health.
CONCLUSIONS: The studies, regardless of the region or country, showing the 
relationships and impacts, local and global, of climatic variations on the 
health of populations.

Publisher: OBJETIVO: El cambio climático antropogénico es un fenómeno que 
adquiere cada vez más importancia en muchos ámbitos como la economía y la 
política, pero además tiene gran relevancia científica debido a los importantes 
efectos que tiene en la salud de las personas. La relación del cambio climático 
con la salud ha provocado un aumento de la producción de conocimiento científico 
acerca de este tema y por ello el objetivo de este artículo fue proporcionar una 
revisión actualizada de la evidencia científica de acceso abierto, en los 
últimos cinco años, relacionada con los efectos del cambio climático 
antropogénico en la Salud Pública.
METODOS: Se realizó una revisión sistemática de la literatura, en español e 
inglés, en cuatro bases de datos sin subscripción, a partir de términos de 
tesauros en línea; se aplicaron criterios de inclusión y exclusión, y una 
evaluación con la estrategia STROBE.
RESULTADOS: Se analizaron finalmente 18 publicaciones evidenciando la relación 
entre los eventos extremos, como olas de calor y frío, con el aumento de la 
mortalidad por diversas causas, especialmente por infartos; la alteración de los 
periodos de lluvias y sequía como un determinante de diversas enfermedades 
infecciosas; la contaminación del aire por las emisiones derivadas del uso de 
combustibles fósiles con la reducción de 2,9 años de la expectativa de vida 
mundial. Además, otros autores reportaron predicciones a partir de alteraciones 
del clima en riesgos a la salud; y las percepciones de la población y de los 
responsables de políticas públicas sobre los impactos del cambio climático en la 
salud.
CONCLUSIONES: Los estudios, sin importar la región o país, se conectan entre sí, 
mostrando las relaciones e impactos, locales y globales, de las variaciones 
climáticas sobre la salud de las poblaciones.

AIM: To evaluate the economic and clinical burden associated with poor glycaemic 
control in Sweden, in people with type 2 diabetes (T2D) initiating first-line 
glucose-lowering therapy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Population data were obtained from Swedish national 
registers. Immediate glycaemic control was compared with delays in achieving 
control of 1 and 3 years, with outcomes projected over 3, 10 and 50 years in the 
validated IQVIA CORE Diabetes Model. Glycaemic control was defined as glycated 
haemoglobin (HbA1c) targets of 52, 48 and 42 mmol/mol, as recommended in Swedish 
guidelines, according to age and disease duration. Costs (expressed in 2019 
Swedish krona [SEK]) were accounted from a Swedish societal perspective.
RESULTS: Immediate glycaemic control was associated with population-level cost 
savings of up to SEK 279 million and SEK 673 million versus delays of 1 and 
3 years, respectively, as well as small population-level life expectancy 
benefits of up to 1305 and 2590 life years gained. Reduced levels of burden were 
a result of lower incidence and delayed time to onset of diabetes-related 
complications.
CONCLUSIONS: Even in people with T2D initiating first-line glucose-lowering 
therapy, the economic burden of poor glycaemic control in Sweden is substantial, 
but could be reduced by early and effective treatment to achieve glycaemic 
targets.

INTRODUCTION: Subjective life expectancy is a good predictor of health and could 
therefore be a relevant factor in the informal caregiving context. However, no 
research has been conducted on the perception of life expectancy by informal 
caregivers. This is the first study that examines the association between 
transitioning into, and out of, informal caregiving, and subjective life 
expectancy, and the relevance of employment status and gender for these 
associations.
METHODS: A longitudinal study was conducted with data from the German Ageing 
Survey (waves 2008, 2011, 2014, and 2017). Up to 20,774 observations pooled over 
all waves were included in the main models. In total, 1,219 transitions into and 
1,198 transitions out of informal caregiving were observed. Fixed effects (FE) 
regression analysis was used. Moderator and stratified analyses were conducted 
with gender and employment status used as moderator variables and to stratify 
the sample. Sociodemographic information, health, and lifestyle factors were 
controlled for.
RESULTS: Results of adjusted FE regression analyses indicated a significant 
reduction of subjective life expectancy when transitioning into informal 
caregiving. No significant change was found when transitioning out of informal 
caregiving. Subjective life expectancy was significantly decreased when employed 
individuals transitioned into informal caregiving and significantly increased 
when they transitioned out of caregiving. Findings for women transitioning into 
informal caregiving indicated a significant decrease in subjective life 
expectancy, while no significant change was found among men.
CONCLUSION: The study's findings indicate that informal caregivers, female and 
employed caregivers in particular, perceive informal care provision as dangerous 
for their longevity and expect to die earlier when transitioning into informal 
caregiving. Thus, supportive interventions for informal caregivers, particularly 
employed and female informal caregivers, are recommended.

End-of-life cost trajectories and the trade-off between treatment costs and 
life-extension: Findings from the Cost and Medical Care of Patients with 
Advanced Serious Illness (COMPASS) cohort study.

Singapore.

BACKGROUND: Few studies have assessed how patient preferences influence 
end-of-life costs.
AIM: To estimate mean monthly healthcare costs in 2019 Singapore Dollars (SGD) 
at five time points within the last year of life and identify how patients' 
preferences for the trade-off between treatment cost containment and 
life-extension and other factors affect these costs.
DESIGN: Mean monthly costs were quantified in the last 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12-months 
before death. Univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted.
SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Billing records for 286 deceased participants in the Cost 
and Medical Care of Patients with Advanced Serious Illness (COMPASS) cancer 
cohort study in Singapore.
RESULTS: Mean monthly costs were $5140 (95% CI: $4750; $5520) in the 12-months 
before death and rose to $8350 (95% CI: $7110; $9590) 1-month before death. 
Participants preferring higher cost containment/less life-extension defied the 
trend of increasing costs closer to death (mean monthly costs of $4630 (95% CI: 
$3690; $ 5580) and $4850 (95% CI: $2850; $6850) (12-months and 1-month before 
death respectively). Participants preferring lower cost containment/more 
life-extension had costs that were $1050 (95% CI: $49; $2051) and $5220 (95% CI: 
$2320; $8130) higher than those preferring lower costs/less life-extension 
12-months and 1-month before death respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: On average, cancer patients in Singapore can expect to spend 
$61,680 in the last year of life. Of broader relevance is that patient 
preferences and other observable factors clearly influence these costs, 
suggesting that policymakers and patients can better predict and budget for 
end-of-life costs by considering these factors.

AIM: Since 20 February 2020, Lombardy has been one of the most affected areas 
worldwide by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The aim of this 
study is to evaluate work and psychological impact of COVID-19 on Lombardy 
radiation therapy (RT) residents in the first 3 months of the outbreak (first 
lockdown).
METHODS: An online questionnaire (22 multiple choice questions) via Microsoft 
Forms was administered on 30 May 2020 to RT residents.
RESULTS: Nineteen Lombardy RT residents responded to the survey. Nineteen 
percent of residents underwent a nasal swab and 11% were quarantined. Seventeen 
residents (89%) reported an increase in workload. Twelve residents (63%) did not 
find any difference in terms of work distress; worsening was highlighted in 5 
cases (26%). The majority has never considered the possibility of stopping work 
due to excessive stress (89%). Almost all the residents experienced self- or 
relative-referred apprehension (95%). Ninety-five percent reported having missed 
extra-work social relationships. Most of the sample noted worsening sleep 
quality and difficulty concentrating (69%). No residents requested psychological 
support, even if provided by the hospital.
CONCLUSION: Overall, the residents adapted to the new workplace scenario, 
although some health risks and well-being challenges have been reported. An 
extension of the survey to all Italian RT residents endorsed by Italian 
Association of Radiotherapy and Clinical Oncology "Young AIRO" will allow an 
evaluation of COVID-19 impact on a national level. A second survey is planned to 
underline differences between the first lockdown and the current situation of 
the pandemic.
