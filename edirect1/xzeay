increased the protective VBS width to 32 m. In current agricultural practice, 
however, 26% of the water stretches investigated do not comply with the 
prescribed 5 m VBS. An extension of the VBS area to 18 m would demand 3.8% of 
agricultural land within the catchments. A 50% reduction in pesticide use, as 
required by the European green deal, would still result in 39% (RAC) and 68% 
(ACfield) of event-related samples being exceeded. Consequently, we see the 
extension of the VBS width as the most efficient mearsure to sustainably reduce 
pesticide concentrations in small streams.

Nitric oxide (NO), a small signaling gas molecule, participates in several 
growth and developmental processes in plants. However, how NO regulates cell 
wall biosynthesis remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate a positive effect of NO 
on cellulose content that may be related to S-nitrosylation of cellulose 
synthase 1 (CESA1) and CESA9. Two S-nitrosylated cysteine (Cys) residues, Cys562 
and Cys641, which are exposed on the surface of CESA1 and CESA9 and located in 
the cellulose synthase catalytic domain, were identified to be S-nitrosylated. 
Meanwhile, Cys641 was located on the binding surface of CESA1 and CESA9, and 
Cys562 was very close to the binding surface. Cellulose synthase complexes 
(CSCs) dynamics are closely associated with cellulose content. S-nitrosylation 
of CESA1 and CESA9 improved particles mobility and thus increased the 
accumulation of cellulose in Arabidopsis hypocotyl cells. An increase in 
hemicellulose content as well as an alteration in pectin content facilitated 
cell wall extension and contributed to cell growth, finally promoting elongation 
of Arabidopsis hypocotyls. Overall, our work provides a path to investigate the 
way NO affects the cellulose content of plants.

BACKGROUND: Adult patients with adrenoleukodystrophy have a poor prognosis owing 
to development of adrenomyeloneuropathy. Additionally, a large proportion of 
patients with adrenomyeloneuropathy develop life-threatening progressive 
cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy. Leriglitazone is a novel selective peroxisome 
proliferator-activated receptor gamma agonist that regulates expression of key 
genes that contribute to neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative processes 
implicated in adrenoleukodystrophy disease progression. We aimed to assess the 
effect of leriglitazone on clinical, imaging, and biochemical markers of disease 
progression in adults with adrenomyeloneuropathy.
METHODS: ADVANCE was a 96-week, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
phase 2-3 trial done at ten hospitals in France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, the 
Netherlands, Spain, the UK, and the USA. Ambulatory men aged 18-65 years with 
adrenomyeloneuropathy without gadolinium enhancing lesions suggestive of 
progressive cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy were randomly assigned (2:1 without 
stratification) to receive daily oral suspensions of leriglitazone (150 mg 
starting dose; between baseline and week 12, doses were increased or decreased 
to achieve plasma concentrations of 200 μg·h/mL [SD 20%]) or placebo by means of 
an interactive response system and a computer-generated sequence. Investigators 
and patients were masked to group assignment. The primary efficacy endpoint was 
change from baseline in the Six-Minute Walk Test distance at week 96, analysed 
in the full-analysis set by means of a mixed model for repeated measures with 
restricted maximum likelihood and baseline value as a covariate. Adverse events 
were also assessed in the full-analysis set. This study was registered with 
ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03231878; the primary study is complete; patients had the 
option to continue treatment in an open-label extension, which is ongoing.
FINDINGS: Between Dec 8, 2017, and Oct 16, 2018, of 136 patients screened, 116 
were randomly assigned; 62 [81%] of 77 patients receiving leriglitazone and 34 
[87%] of 39 receiving placebo completed treatment. There was no between-group 
difference in the primary endpoint (mean [SD] change from baseline 
leriglitazone: -27·7 [41·4] m; placebo: -30·3 [60·5] m; least-squares mean 
difference -1·2 m; 95% CI -22·6 to 20·2; p=0·91). The most common treatment 
emergent adverse events in both the leriglitazone and placebo groups were weight 
gain (54 [70%] of 77 vs nine [23%] of 39 patients, respectively) and peripheral 
oedema (49 [64%] of 77 vs seven [18%] of 39). There were no deaths. Serious 
treatment-emergent adverse events occurred in 14 (18%) of 77 patients receiving 
leriglitazone and ten (26%) of 39 patients receiving placebo. The most common 
serious treatment emergent adverse event, clinically progressive cerebral 
adrenoleukodystrophy, occurred in six [5%] of 116 patients, all of whom were in 
the placebo group.
INTERPRETATION: The primary endpoint was not met, but leriglitazone was 
generally well tolerated and rates of adverse events were in line with the 
expected safety profile for this drug class. The finding that cerebral 
adrenoleukodystrophy, a life-threatening event for patients with 
adrenomyeloneuropathy, occurred only in patients in the placebo group supports 
further investigation of whether leriglitazone might slow the progression of 
cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy.

Historically, invasive procedures and surgeries were deferred in patients with 
haematological malignancies including advanced stage chronic lymphocytic 
leukaemia (CLL) because of limited life expectancy. However, novel, and often 
continuous, treatments have markedly improved outcomes in CLL. Some patients may 
expect years of treatment response and disease control, overcoming the short 
life expectancy that deters interventionalists. Such patients now often undergo 
various invasive procedures including major surgery. To inform peri-operative 
management, we summarize the relevant side effects and drug interactions of 
continuous CLL therapies, highlight potential surgical risks, and provide 
recommendations on withholding specific CLL drugs around invasive procedures.

AIM: Our study aimed to survey the burden of disease attributed to metabolic 
risks (MRs) and secondary MR from 1990 to 2019.
METHODS: Using methodological framework of the Global Burden of Disease Study 
2019, we reported the global number, age-standardized rate and population 
attributable fraction of deaths and disability adjusted life years related to 
MRs and secondary MR. Furthermore, we analyzed the global burden caused by MRs 
and secondary MR in detail by gender, age, region, country, disease and 
Socio-demographic Index level.
RESULTS: The number (million) of deaths and DALYs caused by MRs was 18.6 and 
462.8 in 2019, with an increase of 43.6 % and 75.0 % since 1990. However, the 
ASR of deaths and DALYs attributed to MRs had a decrease of 23.3 % and 17.0 % 
since 1990. The burden caused by MRs and secondary MR raised with age, and the 
burden was the heaviest in low - and middle-income countries, especially in 
Middle East & North Africa. For diseases, the heaviest burden attributed to MRs 
was observed in ischemic heart disease, followed by stroke.
CONCLUSION: The burden of disease attributed to MRs has continued to rise in the 
past 30 years, particularly for men and low-middle SDI regions. Therefore, the 
government should take corresponding actions to reduce the impact of MRs on 
population health.

PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to update the life expectancy of patients 
with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in an exhaustive nationwide population 
according to the upfront treatment performed.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: From the French Program for the Medicalization of 
Information System database, all patients older than 18 years diagnosed with a 
de novo HCC from January 2011 to December 2018 were retrospectively selected. 
Five-year survival rates (95% confidence intervals [CI]) were computed according 
to the first surgical or interventional radiology procedures performed.
RESULTS: A total of 63,996 patients (80% men) with a median age of 68 years (Q1, 
Q3: 61, 77) were selected, including 24,007 patients who underwent at least one 
procedure (5-year survival of 45.5%; (95% CI: 44.8-46.2), and 39,989 with none 
(5-year survival, 9.6%; (95% CI: 9.3-10.0). Only 20.5% (13,101/63,996) of 
patients could undergo an upfront curative procedure. Liver transplantation 
achieved the best outcome, whether performed upfront (n = 791; 5-year survival, 
79.0% [95% CI: 76.1-82.1]) or during subsequent steps (n = 2217; 5-year survival 
80.9% [95% CI: 79.2-82.7]). Tumor ablation (n = 5306), open resection 
(n = 5171), and minimally-invasive resection (n = 1833) achieved 5-year survival 
rates of 53.8% (95% CI: 52.3-55.4), 54.1% (95% CI: 52.6-55.6), and 66.2% (95% 
CI: 63.7-68.7), respectively, with more patients with cirrhosis and subsequent 
procedures in the tumor ablation group. Patients with upfront transarterial 
(chemo)embolization (n = 10,247) and selective internal radiation therapy 
(n = 659) had 5-year survival rates of 31.3% (95% CI: 30.3-32.4) and 18.5% (95% 
CI: 15.2-22.5).
CONCLUSION: While HCC remains mostly diagnosed at an advanced stage associated 
with a poor prognosis, all the curative options provide 5-year survival rates 
above 50%.

BACKGROUND: Low back pain (LBP) is the most common musculoskeletal disorder 
globally. Providing region- and national-specific information on the burden of 
low back pain is critical for local healthcare policy makers. The present study 
aimed to report, compare, and contextualize the prevalence, incidence and years 
lived with disability (YLDs) of low back pain in the Middle East and North 
Africa (MENA) region by age, sex and sociodemographic index (SDI), from 1990 to 
2019.
METHODS: Publicly available data were obtained from the Global Burden of Disease 
(GBD) study 2019. The burden of LBP was reported for the 21 countries located in 
the MENA region, from 1990 to 2019. All estimates were reported as counts and 
age-standardised rates per 100,000 population, together with their corresponding 
95% uncertainty intervals (UIs).
RESULTS: In 2019, the age-standardised point prevalence and incidence rate per 
100,000 in MENA were 7668.2 (95% UI 6798.0 to 8363.3) and 3215.9 (95%CI 2838.8 
to 3638.3), which were 5.8% (4.3 to 7.4) and 4.4% (3.4 to 5.5) lower than in 
1990, respectively. Furthermore, the regional age-standardised YLD rate in 2019 
was 862.0 (605.5 to 1153.3) per 100,000, which was 6.0% (4.2 to 7.7) lower than 
in 1990. In 2019, Turkey [953.6 (671.3 to 1283.5)] and Lebanon [727.2 (511.5 to 
966.0)] had the highest and lowest age-standardised YLD rates, respectively. 
There was no country in the MENA region that showed increases in the 
age-standardised prevalence, incidence or YLD rates of LBP over the measurement 
period. Furthermore, in 2019 the number of prevalent cases were highest in the 
35-39 age group, with males having a higher number of cases in all age groups. 
In addition, the age-standardised YLD rates for males in the MENA region were 
higher than the global estimates in almost all age groups, in both 1990 and 
2019. Furthermore, the burden of LBP was not associated with the level of 
socio-economic development during the measurement period.
CONCLUSION: The burden attributable to LBP in the MENA region decreased slightly 
from 1990 to 2019. Furthermore, the burden among males was higher than the 
global average. Consequently, more integrated healthcare interventions are 
needed to more effectively alleviate the burden of low back pain in this region.

Increased human life expectancy, due in part to improvements in infant and 
childhood survival, more active lifestyles, in combination with higher patient 
expectations for better health outcomes, is leading to an extensive change in 
the number, type and manner in which health conditions are treated. Over the 
next decades as the global population rapidly progresses toward a super-aging 
society, meeting the long-term quality of care needs is forecast to present a 
major healthcare challenge. The goal is to ensure longer periods of good health, 
a sustained sense of well-being, with extended periods of activity, social 
engagement, and productivity. To accomplish these goals, multifunctionalized 
interfaces are an indispensable component of next generation medical 
technologies. The development of more sophisticated materials and devices as 
well as an improved understanding of human disease is forecast to revolutionize 
the diagnosis and treatment of conditions ranging from osteoarthritis to

BACKGROUND: Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) is a rare malignant tumor with a 
short life expectancy. It is important to identify patients at high risk so that 
doctors can adopt more aggressive regimens to treat their condition. Machine 
learning has the advantage of processing complicated data. To date, there is no 
research that tries to use machine learning algorithms and big data to construct 
prognostic models for ACC patients.
METHODS: Clinical data of patients with ACC were obtained from the Surveillance, 
Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. These records were screened 
according to preset inclusion and exclusion criteria. The remaining data were 
applied to univariate survival analysis to select meaningful outcome-related 
candidates. Backpropagation artificial neural network (BP-ANN), random forest 
(RF), support vector machine (SVM), and naive Bayes classifier (NBC) were chosen 
as alternative algorithms. The acquired cases were grouped into a training set 
and a test set at a ratio of 8:2, and a 10-fold cross-validation method repeated 
10 times was performed. Area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) 
curves were used as indices of efficiency.
RESULTS: The calculated 1-, 3-, 5-, and 10-year overall survival rates were 
62.3%, 42.0%, 34.9%, and 26.1%, respectively. A total of 825 patients were 
included in the study. In the training set, the AUCs of BP-ANN, RF, SVM, and NBC 
for predicting 1-year survival status were 0.921, 0.885, 0.865, and 0.854; those 
for predicting 3-year survival status were 0.859, 0.865, 0.837, and 0.831; and 
those for 5-year survival status were 0.888, 0.872, 0.852, and 0.841, 
respectively. In the test set, AUCs of these four models for 1-year survival 
status were 0.899, 0.875, 0.886, and 0.862; those for 3-year survival status 
were 0.871, 0.858, 0.853, and 0.869; and those for 5-year survival status were 
0.841, 0.783, 0.836, and 0.867, respectively. The consequences of the 10-fold 
cross-validation method repeated 10 times indicated that the mean values of 1-, 
3-, and 5-year AUROCs of BP-ANN were 0.890, 0.847, and 0.854, respectively, 
which were better than those of other classifiers (P < 0.008).
CONCLUSION: The model combined with BP-ANN and big data can precisely predict 
the survival status of ACC patients and has the potential for clinical 
application.

Evolution led humans to bipedal stance and movement. However, we live in a 
sedentary society that strongly challenges our willingness to be physically 
active. We (mis)understand that being at least a Sunday runner could protect us 
from sedentary-related diseases, but what if this compromises the healthier life 
expectancy anyway? Citing Paul Gauguin, we know where we come from and what we 
are, the question arises about where we are going. And also, how.

among older Chinese adults: A scoping review.

The aging Chinese population is growing fast, and the proportion of the 
population aged 60 years old is projected to reach 28% by 2040, estimated 402 
million. With increased life expectancy, the aging population tends to suffer 
from health risks and diseases, which create a burden on public health policy. 
Hence, it is essential to promote healthy and active aging, which includes 
improving older adults' physical and mental capacities and advocating for the 
achievement of a healthy life expectancy. Despite the rapidly growing aging 
population in China, there have been no reviews investigating the effect of 
physical activity on physical and mental health among older Chinese adults. 
Therefore, the current study aimed to review studies from the past 15 years that 
illustrate the effect of physical activity on physical and mental health among 
Chinese older adults. Based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic 
Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) extension for scoping reviews (PRISMA-ScR), 
this review addresses the associations between physical activity, physical 
health and mental health among older Chinese adults. A total of 371 studies were 
included in the scoping review, which covered the relationships between physical 
activity, physical health and mental health variables. The scoping review also 
revealed the impact of various kinds of physical activity affecting older 
adults' physical health, such as functional fitness, body composition, fall risk 
and balance, and mental health issues, such as depression, anxiety, cognitive 
function and quality of life. Moreover, studies have identified innovative forms 
of physical activity as emerging trends in physical activity interventions for 
older adults. To conclude, this scoping review captured the common effects 
between physical activity and overall wellbeing, including physical, mental, and 
cognitive health. Additionally, diverse forms of physical activity intervention, 
such as group-based and supervised individual interventions, should be 
supported, and cross-cultural exercise comparisons should be made in future 
explorations.

Healthy life expectancy (HLE) is an indicator that measures the number of years 
individuals at a given age are expected to live free of disease or disability. 
HLE forecasting is essential for planning the provision of health care to 
elderly populations and appropriately pricing Long Term Care insurance products. 
In this paper, we propose a methodology that simultaneously forecasts HLE for 
groups of countries and allows for investigating similarities in their HLE 
patterns. We firstly apply a functional data clustering to the multivariate time 
series of HLE at birth of different countries for the years 1990-2019 provided 
by the Global Burden of Disease Study. Three clusters are identified for both 
genders. Then, we carry out the HLE simultaneous forecasting of the populations 
within each cluster by a multivariate random walk with drift. Numerical results 
and the statistical significance of the parameters of the identified 
multivariate processes are shown. Demographic evidences on the different 
evolution of HLE between countries are commented.

Background: Ageing is associated with alterations to skeletal muscle oxidative 
metabolism that may be influenced by physical activity status, although the 
mechanisms underlying these changes have not been unraveled. Similarly, the 
effect of resistance exercise training (RET) on skeletal muscle mitochondrial 
regulation is unclear. Methods: Seven endurance-trained masters athletes ([MA], 
74 ± 3 years) and seven untrained older adults ([OC]. 69 ± 6 years) completed a 
single session of knee extension RET (6 x 12 repetitions, 75% 1-RM, 120-s 
intra-set recovery). Vastus lateralis muscle biopsies were collected pre-RET, 
1 h post-RET, and 48h post-RET. Skeletal muscle biopsies were analyzed for 
citrate synthase (CS) enzyme activity, mitochondrial content, and markers of 
mitochondrial quality control via immunoblotting. Results: Pre-RET CS activity 
and protein content were ∼45% (p < .001) and ∼74% greater in MA compared with OC 
(p = .006). There was a significant reduction (∼18%) in CS activity 48 h 
post-RET (p < .05) in OC, but not MA. Pre-RET abundance of individual and 
combined mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) complexes I-V were 
significantly greater in MA compared with OC, as were markers of mitochondrial 
fission and fusion dynamics (p-DRP-1Ser616, p-MFFSer146, OPA-1 & FIS-1, p < .05 
for all). Moreover, MA displayed greater expression of p-AMPKThr172, PGC1α, 
TFAM, and SIRT-3 (p < .05 for all). Notably, RET did not alter the expression of 
any marker of mitochondrial content, biogenesis, or quality control in both OC 
and MA. Conclusion: The present data suggest that long-term aerobic exercise 
training supports superior skeletal muscle mitochondrial density and protein 
content into later life, which may be regulated by greater mitochondrial quality 
control mechanisms and supported via superior fission-fusion dynamics. However, 
a single session of RET is unable to induce mitochondrial remodelling in the 
acute (1h post-RET) and delayed (48 h post-RET) recovery period in OC and MA.

Life-LCA: case study of the life cycle impacts of an infant.

17. Juni 135, 10623 Berlin, Germany.

PURPOSE: The recently published first Life-LCA case study of a human being 
(0-49 years) did not use primary data for the "childhood and youth stage" 
(0-17 years). Consumption was assumed to contribute 50% of the calculated 48th 
baseline year. This led to uncertainties as consumer behavior changes from birth 
to adulthood. Furthermore, transport emissions and environmental impacts before 
birth were neglected. Therefore, this paper analyzes the prenatal and infancy 
phase (0-3 years) to develop the Life-LCA method and database further and 
evaluate generic assumptions.
METHODS: The Life-LCA method sets the reporting unit to newly defined prenatal 
and infancy phases. The reporting flow describes the range of all consumed 
products attributable to an infant. Primary data was collected with a sample of 
three study objects-a pregnant mother, a newborn baby, and a 3-year-old 
infant-living in Germany. The following environmental impact assessment 
categories are considered: climate change (GWP), acidification (AP), 
eutrophication (EP), and photochemical ozone creation (POCP).
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Prenatal and infancy phase burdens account for a GWP of 
4,011 kg CO2-eq., an AP of 22.3 kg SO2-eq., an EP of 10.7 kg PO4-eq., and a POCP 
of 1.7 kg C2H4-eq. The share of the prenatal phase is around 15-20% for all 
impact categories. Transport is a hotspot for GWP (30-60%) and POCP (45-70%) in 
both phases. AP (50%) and EP (45-50%) are dominated by food products, mainly 
meat (45%) and dairy products (35%). For the prenatal phase, energy and water 
consumption at birth rank third in GWP (8%). Diapers account for 6% (GWP) of the 
environmental burden in the infancy phase. Assumptions made in the first 
Life-LCA study connect closely with the values calculated for the first three 
years of infancy. A remaining challenge is allocating the impacts between 
infants and parents and developing a methodology for assessing data quality.
CONCLUSION: Focusing on two new life phases has led to the subdivision of the 
"childhood and youth stage" and an extension of the system boundaries. The 
results' uncertainty was reduced by developing a new set of specific datasets 
focusing on several study objects. The case study results show the importance of 
primary data collection for evaluating generic assumptions. Additional studies 
on childhood and adolescence from 3 to 17 years are suggested for a robust 
assessment of the complete "childhood and youth stage."

PURPOSE: Despite the global efforts to improve organ donation, there is a 
demand-supply gap for organs in India. The only solution to meet this disparity 
is to improve deceased donor transplants in the country through victims of road 
accidents. The government has instituted several initiatives to achieve this 
goal. However, challenges and barriers continue to affect the organ donation 
process. The present study aims to document the motivating factors and obstacles 
in the decision of families to donate organs in Ahmedabad, Gujarat and their 
suggestions to improve the processes involved in organ donation.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A qualitative exploratory study (in-depth interview) of 
ten relatives of deceased organ donors was conducted from Oct 2021 to Feb 2022. 
Interviews were audio recorded, and detailed notes were taken during the 
interview. Thematic analysis was done using ATLAS.ti version 8 software.
RESULTS: The significant motivators identified were family members' belief or 
conviction that it would help save the lives of others; a sense of moral 
obligation to do so as bodies of brain-dead persons can contribute to this noble 
goal, no use of the body after death, an extension of life, and being a role 
model for others. The challenges were mistrusting the organ donation process, 
fear of being responsible for any mishappening, and feeling of shock. The 
suggestions to improve organ donation included awareness creation, simplifying 
the legal process for accidental deaths, providing benefits to the donor family, 
and a system for identifying potential donors and their counselling.
CONCLUSION: The present study reflects the need for a more comprehensive 
awareness campaign to generate awareness and remove the misconception about 
organ donation in India. The findings of the study can be helpful for 
policymakers to amend the current organ donation process in India and improve 
the disequilibrium of demand and supply of deceased donations in India.

Comparing absorbed doses and radiation risk of the α-emitting bone-seekers 
[(223)Ra]RaCl(2) and [(224)Ra]RaCl(2).

[223Ra]RaCl2 and [224Ra]RaCl2 are bone seekers, emitting high LET, and short 
range (< 100 μm) alpha-particles. Both radionuclides show similar decay 
properties; the total alpha energies are comparable (223Ra: ≈28 MeV, 224Ra: ≈26 
MeV). [224Ra]RaCl2 has been used from the mid-1940s until 1990 for treating 
different bone and joint diseases with activities of up to approximately 50 MBq 
[224Ra]RaCl2. In 2013 [223Ra]RaCl2 obtained marketing authorization by the FDA 
and by the European Union for the treatment of metastatic prostate cancer with 
an activity to administer of 0.055 MBq per kg body weight for six cycles. For 
intravenous injections in humans a model calculation using the biokinetic model 
of ICRP67 shows a ratio of organ absorbed dose coefficients (224Ra:223Ra) 
between 0.37 (liver) and 0.97 except for the kidneys (2.27) and blood (1.57). 
For the red marrow as primary organ-at-risk, the ratio is 0.57. The differences 
are mainly caused be the differing half-lives of the decay products of both 
radium isotopes. Both radionuclides show comparable DNA damage patterns in 
peripheral blood mononuclear cells after internal ex-vivo irradiation. Data on 
the long-term radiation-associated side effects are only available for treatment 
with [224Ra]RaCl2. Two epidemiological studies followed two patient groups 
treated with [224Ra]RaCl2 for more than 25 years. One of them was the "Spiess 
study", a cohort of 899 juvenile patients who received several injections of 
[224Ra]RaCl2 with a mean specific activity of 0.66 MBq/kg. Another patient group 
of ankylosing spondylitis patients was treated with 10 repeated intravenous 
injections of [224Ra]RaCl2, 1 MBq each, 1 week apart. In total 1,471 of these 
patients were followed-up in the "Wick study". In both studies, an increased 
cancer mortality by leukemia and solid cancers was observed. Similar 
considerations on long-term effects likely apply to [223Ra]RaCl2 as well since 
the biokinetics are similar and the absorbed doses in the same range. However, 
this increased risk will most likely not be observed due to the much shorter 
life expectancy of prostate cancer patients treated with [223Ra]RaCl2.

Some enzymes can catalyze more than one chemical conversion for which they are 
physiologically specialized. This secondary function, which is called 
underground, promiscuous, metabolism, or cross activity, is recognized as a 
valuable feature and has received much attention for developing new catalytic 
functions in industrial applications. In this study, a novel bifunctional 
xylanase/β-glucosidase metagenomic-derived enzyme, PersiBGLXyn1, with 
underground β-glucosidase activity was mined by in-silico screening. Then, the 
corresponding gene was cloned, expressed and purified. The PersiBGLXyn1 improved 
the degradation efficiency of organic solvent pretreated coffee residue waste 
(CRW), and subsequently the production of bioethanol during a separate enzymatic 
hydrolysis and fermentation (SHF) process. After characterization, the enzyme 
was immobilized on a nanocellulose (NC) carrier generated from sugar beet pulp 
(SBP), which remarkably improved the underground activity of the enzyme up to 
four-fold at 80°C and up to two-fold at pH 4.0 compared to the free one. The 
immobilized PersiBGLXyn1 demonstrated 12 to 13-fold rise in half-life at 70 and 
80°C for its underground activity. The amount of reducing sugar produced from 
enzymatic saccharification of the CRW was also enhanced from 12.97 g/l to 
19.69 g/l by immobilization of the enzyme. Bioethanol production was 29.31 g/l 
for free enzyme after 72 h fermentation, while the immobilized PersiBGLXyn1 
showed 51.47 g/l production titre. Overall, this study presented a 
cost-effective in-silico metagenomic approach to identify novel bifunctional 
xylanase/β-glucosidase enzyme with underground β-glucosidase activity. It also 
demonstrated the improved efficacy of the underground activities of the 
bifunctional enzyme as a promising alternative for fermentable sugars production 
and subsequent value-added products.

OBJECTIVES: Women with Turner syndrome (TS) have an increased risk of aortic 
disease, reducing life-expectancy. This study aimed to systematically review the 
prevalence of thoracic aortic dilatation, aortic dimensions and growth, and the 
incidence of aortic dissection.
METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted up to July 2022. 
Observational studies with an adult TS population were included, and studies 
including children aged <15 years old or specific TS populations were excluded.
RESULTS: In total 21 studies were included. The pooled prevalence of ascending 
aortic dilatation was 23% (95% CI 19-26) at a mean pooled age of 29 years (95% 
CI 26-32), while the incidence of aortic dissection was 164 per 100.000 
patient-years (95% CI 95-284). Three reporting studies showed aortic growth over 
time to be limited. Risk factors for aortic dilation or dissection were older 
age, bicuspid aortic valve, aortic coarctation, and hypertension.
CONCLUSION: In adult TS women, ascending aortic dilatation is common and the 
hazard of aortic dissection increased compared to the general population, 
whereas aortic growth is limited. Conventional risk markers do not explain all 
aortic dissection cases; therefore, new imaging parameters and blood biomarkers 
are needed to improve prediction, allowing for patient-tailored follow-up and 
surgical decision-making.
