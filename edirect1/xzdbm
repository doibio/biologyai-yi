the development, survival, and fecundity from C. chinensis individuals reared on 
the four cultivars. The age-stage, two-sex life table theory was used in order 
to enable the inclusion of males in the analysis as well as a means of 
identifying the variation in developmental durations among individuals. Results 
indicated that C. chinensis can successfully develop and reproduce on all four 
pear cultivars. However, based on the lower preadult survival rate, longer 
preadult duration, longer total preoviposition period (TPOP), and lower 
fecundity that occurred on both cultivars of P. communis, these two cultivars 
are less favorable hosts for C. chinensis than the P. bretschneideri cultivars. 
The lower intrinsic rate of increase (r), finite rate of increase (λ), and net 
reproduction rate (R0) on CB and CRB pears showed these two introduced cultivars 
are more resistant to C. chinensis than the endemic BHXS and BSL pears. These 
resistant cultivars would be appropriate candidates for managing C. chinensis. 
We used the bootstrap technique to estimate the uncertainty of the population 
parameters (r, λ, R0, etc.), while also demonstrating that it can be used for 
estimating the 0.025 and 0.975 percentile confidence intervals of the age of 
survival rate.

IMPORTANCE: Sacubitril-valsartan use reduces mortality and hospitalizations 
compared with enalapril among patients with chronic heart failure with reduced 
ejection fraction (HFrEF); however, the cost-effectiveness of these treatments 
when initiated during hospitalization for HF is unknown.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of inpatient initiation of 
sacubitril-valsartan vs enalapril compared with no initiation or 
posthospitalization initiation of sacubitril-valsartan among stabilized patients 
with HFrEF.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This economic evaluation included data on US 
patients with HFrEF who were eligible for sacubitril-valsartan treatment from 
December 8, 2009, to May 15, 2018.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: A 5-state Markov model with all-cause mortality, HF, 
and non-HF hospitalization probabilities was used. Quality of life was estimated 
using Euro-QoL EQ-5D scores. Hospitalization, long-term care, and medication 
costs for sacubitril-valsartan and enalapril were modeled with a discount rate 
of 3%. The base-case analysis included a lifetime horizon from a health care and 
societal perspective.
RESULTS: Modeled patients were a mean (SD) age of 63.8 (11.5) years. Inpatient 
treatment with sacubitril-valsartan ($5628 per year) was associated with 62 
fewer HF-related admissions per 1000 patients compared with outpatient 
initiation or 116 fewer HF-related admissions compared with continuation of 
enalapril treatment. From a health care system perspective, initiation of 
sacubitril-valsartan during hospitalization saved $452 per year compared with 
continuing enalapril and $811 per year compared with initiation at 2 months 
after hospitalization and was associated with an incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio of $21 532 per quality-adjusted life-year compared with continued 
enalapril treatment over a lifetime. From a societal perspective, inpatient 
initiation was estimated to save $460 per year per patient compared with no 
initiation of sacubitril-valsartan and $813 per year per patient compared with 
initiation after hospitalization. In a budget analysis, inpatient initiation of 
sacubitril-valsartan was estimated to save up to $449 per person for 1 year or 
$2550 per person over 5 years compared with continuation of enalapril.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The findings suggest that, for patients with HFrEF, 
initiation of sacubitril-valsartan during hospitalization may be associated with 
reduced hospitalizations, increased quality-adjusted life expectancy, and cost 
savings compared with no initiation or initiation after hospitalization.

BACKGROUND: Infections are common and are a major cause of morbidity and 
mortality during treatment of childhood leukemia. We evaluated the cost 
effectiveness of levofloxacin antibiotic prophylaxis, compared to no 
prophylaxis, in children receiving chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) 
or relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).
PROCEDURES: A cost-utility analysis was conducted from the perspective of the 
single-payer health care system using a lifetime horizon. A comprehensive 
literature review identified available evidence for effectiveness, safety, costs 
of antibiotic prophylaxis in children with leukemia, and health utilities 
associated with the relevant health states. The effects of levofloxacin 
prophylaxis on health outcomes, quality-adjusted life-years (QALY), and direct 
health costs were derived from a combined decision tree and state-transition 
model. One-way deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were 
performed to test the sensitivity of results to parameter uncertainty.
RESULTS: The literature review revealed one randomized controlled trial on 
levofloxacin prophylaxis in childhood AML and relapsed ALL, by Alexander et al, 
that showed a significant reduction in rates of fever and neutropenia (71.2% vs 
82.1%) and bacteremia (21.9% vs 43.4%) with levofloxacin compared to no 
prophylaxis. In our cost-utility analysis, levofloxacin prophylaxis was dominant 
over no prophylaxis, resulting in cost savings of $542.44 and increased survival 
of 0.13 QALY. In probabilistic sensitivity analysis, levofloxacin prophylaxis 
was dominant in 98.8% of iterations.
CONCLUSIONS: The present analysis suggests that levofloxacin prophylaxis, 
compared to no prophylaxis, is cost saving in children receiving intensive 
chemotherapy for AML or relapsed ALL.

BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Geriatric guidelines recommend against statin use in 
older adults with limited life expectancy (LLE) or advanced dementia (AD). This 
study examined resident and facility factors predicting statin discontinuation 
after nursing home (NH) admission in veterans with LLE/AD taking statins for 
secondary prevention.
DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study of Veterans Affairs (VA) bar code medication 
administration records, Minimum Data Set (MDS) assessments, and utilization 
records linked to Medicare claims.
SETTING: VA NHs, known as community living centers (CLCs).
PARTICIPANTS: Veterans aged 65 and older with coronary artery disease, stroke, 
or diabetes mellitus, type II, admitted in fiscal years 2009 to 2015, who met 
criteria for LLE/AD on their admission MDS and received statins in the week 
after admission (n = 13,110).
MEASUREMENTS: Residents were followed until statin discontinuation (ie, gap in 
statin use ≥14 days), death, or censoring due to discharge, day 91 of the stay, 
or end of the study period. Competing risk models assessed cumulative incidence 
and predictors of discontinuation, stratified by whether the resident had their 
end-of-life (EOL) status designated or used hospice at admission.
RESULTS: Overall cumulative incidence of statin discontinuation was 31% (95% 
confidence interval [CI] = 30%-32%) by day 91, and it was markedly higher in 
those with (52%; 95% CI = 50%-55%) vs without (25%; 95% CI = 24%-26%) EOL 
designation/hospice. In patients with EOL designation/hospice (n = 2,374), 
obesity, congestive heart failure, and admission from nonhospital settings 
predicted decreased likelihood of discontinuation; AD, dependency in activities 
of daily living, greater number of medications, and geographic region predicted 
increased likelihood of discontinuation. In patients without EOL 
designation/hospice (n = 10,736), older age and several specific markers of poor 
prognosis predicted greater discontinuation, whereas obesity/overweight 
predicted decreased discontinuation.
CONCLUSION: Most veterans with LLE/AD taking statins for secondary prevention do 
not discontinue statins following CLC admission. Designating residents as EOL 
status, hospice use, and individual clinical factors indicating poor prognosis 
may prompt deprescribing.

BACKGROUND: Tumour extension beyond the mesorectal plane (ymrT4) occurs in 5-10 
per cent of patients with rectal cancer and 10 per cent of patients develop 
locally recurrent rectal cancer (LRRC) after primary surgery. There is global 
variation in healthcare delivery for these conditions.
METHODS: An international benchmark trial of the management of ymrT4 tumours and 
LRRC was undertaken in France and Australia between 2015 and 2017. Heterogeneity 
in management and operative decision-making were analysed by comparison of 
surgical resection rates, blinded intercountry reading of pelvic MRI, 
quality-of-life assessment and qualitative evaluations.
RESULTS: Among 154 patients (97 in France and 57 in Australia), 31·8 per cent 
had ymrT4 disease and 68·2 per cent LRRC. The surgical resection rates were 88 
and 79 per cent in France and Australia respectively (P = 0·112). The 
concordance in operative planning was low (κ = 0·314); the rate of pelvic 
exenteration was lower in France than Australia both in clinical practice (36 of 
78 versus 34 of 40; P < 0·001) and in theoretical conditions (10 of 25 versus 50 
of 57; P = 0·002). The R0 resection rate was lower in France than Australia for 
LRRC (25 of 49 versus 18 of 21; P = 0·007) but not for ymrT4 tumours (21 of 26 
versus 15 of 15; P = 0·139). Morbidity rates were similar. Patients who 
underwent non-exenterative procedures had higher scores on the mental 
functioning subscale at 12 months (P = 0·047), and a lower level of distress at 
6 months (P = 0·049). Qualitative analysis highlighted five categories of 
psychosocial factors influencing treatment decisions: patient, strategy, 
specialist, organization and culture.
CONCLUSION: This international benchmark trial has highlighted the differences 
in worldwide treatment of locally advanced and LRRC. Standardized care should 
improve outcomes for these patients.

Publisher: ANTECEDENTES: La extensión del tumor más allá del plano del 
meso-rrecto (ymrT4) ocurre en el 5-10% de los pacientes con cáncer de recto y el 
10% de los pacientes desarrollan recidiva local del cáncer de recto (locally 
recurrent rectal cáncer, LRRC) después de una cirugía primaria. Existe una 
variación global en la prestación de la asistencia sanitaria para esta 
pato-logía. MÉTODOS: Se realizó un ensayo de referencia internacional sobre el 
manejo de ymrT4 y LRRC en Francia y Australia entre 2015 y 2017. La 
heterogeneidad en el manejo y la toma de decisiones quirúrgicas se analizaron 
mediante la comparación de las tasas de resección quirúrgica, la lectura a 
ciegas de la resonancia magnética (RM) pélvica entre países, la evaluación de la 
calidad de vida y las evaluaciones cualitativas.
RESULTADOS: De 154 pacientes (97 en Francia versus 57 en Australia), el 32% 
tenía ymrT4 y el 68% tenía cáncer de recto con recidiva local. Las tasas de 
resección quirúrgica fueron del 87,6% versus 77,8% (P = 0,112). La tasa de 
concordancia en la decisión quirúrgica fue baja (coeficiente kappa = 0,314) con 
una tasa más baja de exenteración pélvica en Francia, tanto en la práctica 
clínica (46% versus 85%; P < 0,0001) como en condiciones teóricas (40% versus 
88%; P = 0,002). La tasa de resección R0 fue menor en Francia para la LRRC (51% 
versus 86%, P = 0,007) pero no para el ymrT4 (81% versus 100%, P = 0,139). Las 
tasas de morbilidad fueron similares. Los pacientes que se sometieron a 
procedimientos no exenterativos tuvieron una subescala de funcionamiento mental 
más alta a los 12 meses (P = 0,04) y un nivel de angustia más bajo a los 6 meses 
(P = 0,04). El análisis cualitativo destacó 5 categorías de factores 
psicosociales que afectaron a la decisión del tratamiento: paciente, estrategia, 
especialista, organización y cultura. CONCLUSIÓN: Este ensayo de referencia 
internacional destaca las diferencias en el tratamiento mundial del cáncer de 
recto localmente avanzado y de la LRR. La aten-ción estandarizada debería 
mejorar los resultados para estos pacientes.

BACKGROUND: At the end of patients' lives, physicians sometimes provide 
medication with the explicit intention to hasten death. Physicians' assessment 
of such acts varies. We studied which characteristics are associated with 
physicians' classification of these acts.
METHODS: This study concerns a secondary analysis of a nationwide study on the 
practice of medical decision-making at the end of life. In 2015, attending 
physicians of a sample of deceased people (n=9,351) received a questionnaire 
about end-of-life care and decision-making. The response rate was 78%. We 
studied 851 cases in which physicians reported that the patient had died as a 
result of medication they had provided with the explicit intention to hasten 
death. Chi-square tests and logistic regression analyses were performed.
RESULTS: If medication had been provided with the explicit intention to hasten 
death at the explicit request of the patient, physicians considered 
"euthanasia", "assisted suicide" or "ending of life" the most appropriate term 
for their course of action in 82% of all cases, while 17% of physicians chose 
the term "palliative or terminal sedation". Physicians' classification of their 
act as "euthanasia", "assisted suicide" or "ending of life" was less likely when 
patients had a short (1-7 days) or very short (max. 24 hours) life expectancy. 
Furthermore, such classification was less likely when their act had involved the 
use of other medication than muscle relaxants. The limited number of cases in 
which patients had been provided with medication without an explicit patient 
request were never classified as "euthanasia", "assisted suicide" or "ending of 
life".
CONCLUSIONS: Physicians rarely classify the provision of medication with the 
explicit intention of hastening death as "euthanasia", "assisted suicide" or 
"ending of life" when patients are in the dying phase and when they provide 
other medication than muscle relaxants. In these cases, acts are mostly 
classified as "palliative or terminal sedation". This suggests that the legal 
distinction between euthanasia and palliative care may not always be clear in 
clinical practice.

BACKGROUND: Long life expectancy in people living with human immunodeficiency 
virus (PLWH) caused an increase in comorbidities and co-medications. We aimed to 
analyse comedications and drug-drug interactions (DDIs) in antiretroviral 
therapy (ART)-naive PLWH in the era of integrase inhibitors.
METHODS: A retrospective observational study was conducted between January 
2016-August 2019. Patients' characteristics and chronic co-medications were 
recorded. The University of Liverpool HIV drug interaction database was used for 
DDIs.
RESULTS: Among 745 patients, the chronic co-medication rate was 30.9%. Older age 
(p<0.001, OR:6.66, 95% CI: 3.86-11.49) and female gender (p=002, OR:2.25, 
95%:1.14-4.44) were independently associated with co-medication. Cardiovascular 
system (CVS) and central nervous system (CNS) drugs were the most common 
co-medications. Older age patients (p<0.001, OR:12.04, 95% CI:4.63-36.71), 
having heterosexual (HS) contact (p=0.003, OR:3.8, 95% CI:1.57-9.22) were 
independently associated with CVS drugs use, while being men who have sex with 
men (MSM) (p=0.03, OR:2.59, 95% CI:1.11-6.03) were associated with CNS drugs 
use. DDIs were seen in 37.4% of patients with co-medications. Antidiabetics 
(23.3%), CNS (22.1%) and CVS drugs (19.8%) most commonly had DDIs. 
Contraindication was most commonly seen between inhaled corticosteroids and 
elvitegravir/cobicistat. A number of non-ART drugs, elvitegravir/cobicistat, 
antidiabetics, vitamins were independently associated with the presence of DDIs.
CONCLUSION: Results suggested the need for attention about co-medication in PLWH 
regardless of whether they are young or older. CNS drugs should be questioned 
more detailed in MSM, as well as CVS drugs in older HS patients. 
Elvitegravir/cobicistat is significantly associated with DDIs and switching to 
an unboosted INSTI should be considered in patients with multiple comorbidities.

BACKGROUND: Migraine is a common and incapacitating condition, with severe 
impact on the quality of life (QoL) of the afflicted and their families, and 
negative economic consequences through decreased workforce participation, 
reduced functional ability and elevated healthcare costs. This study aimed to 
describe the economic consequences of migraine in Sweden using cost of illness 
survey data and, based on this data, assess the cost-effectiveness of 
onabotulinumtoxinA (Botox) for the treatment of chronic migraine in Sweden and 
Norway.
METHODS: A survey study was conducted in Swedish migraine patients, with 
questions on patient characteristics, headache frequency and severity, effect on 
daily activities and work, QoL, health resource utilization, and medication use. 
Resulting costs were estimated as annual averages over subgroups of average 
monthly headache days. Some results were used to inform a Markov 
cost-effectiveness chronic migraine model. The model was adapted to Sweden and 
Norway using local data. The analysis perspective was semi-societal. Results' 
robustness was tested using one-way, structural, and probabilistic sensitivity 
analyses.
RESULTS: Results from the cost of illness analysis (n = 454) indicated a clear 
correlation between decreased QoL and increased costs with increasing monthly 
headache days. Total annual costs ranged from EUR 6221 in patients with 0-4 
headache days per month, to EUR 57,832 in patients with 25-31. Indirect costs 
made up the majority of costs, ranging from 82% of total costs in the 0-4 
headache days group, to 91% in 25-31 headache days. The cost-effectiveness 
analyses indicated that in Sweden, Botox was associated with 0.223 additional 
QALYs at an additional cost of EUR 4126 compared to placebo, resulting in an 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of EUR 18,506. In Norway, Botox was 
associated with 0.216 additional QALYs at an additional cost of EUR 4301 
compared to placebo, resulting in an ICER of EUR 19,954.
CONCLUSIONS: In people with migraine, an increase in monthly headache days is 
clearly related to lower QoL and higher costs, indicating considerable potential 
costs-savings in reducing the number of headache days. The main cost driver for 
migraine is indirect costs. Botox reduces headache days and is a cost-effective 
treatment for chronic migraine in Sweden and Norway.

Extremely preterm birth reflects global disruption of the third trimester 
environment. Young adults born preterm have an adverse cardiovascular and 
metabolic health profile, together with molecular evidence of accelerated ageing 
and a reduced life expectancy. The underlying mechanism for these observations 
is unknown. This review summarises recent evidence of the lifetime effects of 
preterm birth and highlights the risks survivors face.

Insulin is necessary but not sufficient: changing the therapeutic paradigm in 
type 1 diabetes.

Despite the clear evidence that type 1 diabetes (T1D) begins well before 
hyperglycemia is evident, there are no clinically available disease-modifying 
therapies for early-stage disease. However, following the exciting results of 
the Teplizumab Prevention Study, the first study to demonstrate that overt T1D 
can be delayed with immunotherapy, there is renewed optimism that in the future, 
T1D will be treated before hyperglycemia develops. A different treatment 
paradigm is needed, as a majority of people with T1D do not meet the glycemic 
targets that are associated with a lower risk of T1D complications and therefore 
remain vulnerable to complications and shortened life expectancy. The following 
review will outline the history and current status of immunotherapy for T1D and 
highlight some challenges and ideas for the future. Although such efforts have 
been worldwide, we will focus particularly on the activities of Diabetes 
TrialNet, a National Institutes of Health consortium launched in 2004.

Preseptal cellulitis is an infection of ocular tissue that is often unilateral 
and caused by extension of sinonasal disease. In rare instances it can lead to 
life-threatening necrotizing fasciitis. We present here a unique case of 
bilateral preseptal cellulitis incited by local conjunctivitis caused by 
prescription eye drops. The patient was immunosuppressed, which allowed her 
local inflammation to progress to severe infection and, ultimately, to 
necrotizing fasciitis. This necessitated serial debridement by ophthalmology and 
otolaryngology teams and a prolonged course of intravenous antibiotics monitored 
by an infectious disease team. Despite these interventions, the patient's vision 
did not return to baseline and she had persistent cosmetic and functional 
deformity. This case is unique due to the inciting incident of new prescription 
eye drops, the patient's immunosuppressed state leading to severity of 
infection, and the severe bilateral disease burden.

Mild mitochondrial stress experienced early in life can have beneficial effects 
on the life span of organisms through epigenetic regulations. Here, we report 
that acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA) represents a critical mitochondrial signal to 
regulate aging through the chromatin remodeling and histone deacetylase complex 
(NuRD) in Caenorhabditis elegans. Upon mitochondrial stress, the impaired 
tricarboxylic acid cycle results in a decreased level of citrate, which accounts 
for reduced production of acetyl-CoA and consequently induces nuclear 
accumulation of the NuRD and a homeodomain-containing transcription factor 
DVE-1, thereby enabling decreased histone acetylation and chromatin 
reorganization. The metabolic stress response is thus established during early 
life and propagated into adulthood to allow transcriptional regulation for 
life-span extension. Furthermore, adding nutrients to restore acetyl-CoA 
production is sufficient to counteract the chromatin changes and diminish the 
longevity upon mitochondrial stress. Our findings uncover the molecular 
mechanism of the metabolite-mediated epigenome for the regulation of organismal 
aging.

of Health and Welfare, Takasaki, Gunma, Japan.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate (1) the concurrent validity of the Nursing Home 
Life-Space Diameter (NHLSD) and the Home-based Life-Space Assessment (Hb-LSA), 
(2) the correlated factors of life-space, and (3) the factors that affected the 
NHLSD score for the elderly in a geriatric health service facility, or Roken.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 32 participants in a Roken. Staff 
members, who had received essential guidance for assessment, examined the 
cognitive function, physical function, mood, communication ability, objective 
quality of life, vitality, and daily behavior of the participants. Correlation 
analysis between NHLSD and other measurements and multiple regression analysis 
with NHLSD as a dependent variable were conducted.
RESULTS: NHLSD and Hb-LSA were significantly correlated (r=0.710, P<0.01). NHLSD 
was significantly correlated with more measurements than Hb-LSA was; i.e., NHLSD 
was significantly correlated with communication ability, independence of daily 
living (Barthel Index; BI), maximum knee extension strength, grip strength, 
function in daily living, and three QOL measurements: positive affects, ability 
to communicate, and spontaneity and activity. A stepwise multiple regression 
analysis indicated that the BI total score, the maximum knee extension strength, 
and spontaneity and activity (one of the QOL items) were significantly 
correlated with the NHLSD score.
CONCLUSIONS: NHLSD can measure the mobility levels of elderly persons in Roken. 
In addition to physical conditions and dependence of ADLs, spontaneity (or low 
levels of apathy) may be an important factor for promoting physical activity in 
Roken.

IMPORTANCE: Clostridioides difficile infection is the most common 
hospital-acquired infection in the United States, yet few studies have evaluated 
the cost-effectiveness of infection control initiatives targeting C difficile.
OBJECTIVE: To compare the cost-effectiveness of 9 C difficile single 
intervention strategies and 8 multi-intervention bundles.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This economic evaluation was conducted in a 
simulated 200-bed tertiary, acute care, adult hospital. The study relied on 
clinical outcomes from a published agent-based simulation model of C difficile 
transmission. The model included 4 agent types (ie, patients, nurses, 
physicians, and visitors). Cost and utility estimates were derived from the 
literature.
INTERVENTIONS: Daily sporicidal cleaning, terminal sporicidal cleaning, health 
care worker hand hygiene, patient hand hygiene, visitor hand hygiene, health 
care worker contact precautions, visitor contact precautions, C difficile 
screening at admission, and reduced intrahospital patient transfers.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Cost-effectiveness was evaluated from the hospital 
perspective and defined by 2 measures: cost per hospital-onset C difficile 
infection averted and cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY).
RESULTS: In this agent-based model of a simulated 200-bed tertiary, acute care, 
adult hospital, 5 of 9 single intervention strategies were dominant, reducing 
cost, increasing QALYs, and averting hospital-onset C difficile infection 
compared with baseline standard hospital practices. They were daily cleaning 
(most cost-effective, saving $358 268 and 36.8 QALYs annually), health care 
worker hand hygiene, patient hand hygiene, terminal cleaning, and reducing 
intrahospital patient transfers. Screening at admission cost $1283/QALY, while 
health care worker contact precautions and visitor hand hygiene interventions 
cost $123 264/QALY and $5 730 987/QALY, respectively. Visitor contact 
precautions was dominated, with increased cost and decreased QALYs. Adding 
screening, health care worker hand hygiene, and patient hand hygiene 
sequentially to the daily cleaning intervention formed 2-pronged, 3-pronged, and 
4-pronged multi-intervention bundles that cost an additional $29 616/QALY, 
$50 196/QALY, and $146 792/QALY, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The findings of this study suggest that institutions 
should seek to streamline their infection control initiatives and prioritize a 
smaller number of highly cost-effective interventions. Daily sporicidal cleaning 
was among several cost-saving strategies that could be prioritized over 
minimally effective, costly strategies, such as visitor contact precautions.

Coptera haywardi (Ogloblin) is a pupal endoparasitoid of tephritid flies with 
great potential as a biological control agent worldwide as it does not attack 
other Diptera. To reach its full potential, its mass rearing needs to be 
enhanced lowering costs. Here, we focused on the use of irradiated pupae of 
Ceratitis capitata (Wiedemann) stemming from the temperature-sensitive lethal 
(tsl) Vienna-8 genetic sexing strain (= CcVienna-8), which is mass-produced in 
the San Juan Medfly and Parasitoid Mass Rearing Facility in Argentina. Exposure 
of 1- to 2-d-old CcVienna-8 pupae irradiated at 90 Gy to 6- to 8-d-old C. 
haywardi females at a 10:1 host/parasitoid ratio for 24 h turned out to be 
highly successful for the rearing of this parasitoid. High radiation doses 
(90-100 Gy) did not adversely influence fitness parameters of C. haywardi 
offspring F1, namely lifetime reproductive rates, adult life expectancy, and 
survival time. Demographic parameters in C. haywardi F1 from irradiated 
CcVienna-8 young pupae were improved compared to those values recorded from 
parasitoid originated from nonirradiated CcVienna-8 pupae. These findings will 
help to enhance parasitoid mass rearing for augmentative releases against medfly 
in Argentinean fruit-producing regions.

PURPOSE: Pararenal abdominal aortic aneurysms (PRAAAs) are a life-threatening 
disease, and hemodynamic analysis may provide greater insight into the 
effectiveness and long-term outcomes of endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR). 
However, the lack of patient-specific boundary conditions on the periphery 
compromises the accuracy. Windkessel (WK) boundary conditions coupled to 
hemodynamic follow-up models of a PRAAA patient, aims to provide insights into 
the link between hemodynamics and poor prognosis.
METHOD: One PRAAA patient underwent EVAR and reintervention after one branch of 
stent-graft (SG) had migrated. Totally five computational follow-up models were 
studied. Patient-specific flow data acquired via ultrasound were used to define 
the boundary conditions in the ascending aorta and the following three branches. 
Coupled zero-dimensional WK models representing the distal vasculature were used 
to define the outlet boundary conditions under the abdomen.
RESULTS: Flow divisions of the main SG branches were 40.7% and 24.7%, 
respectively. Time-averaged wall shear stress and oscillatory shear index (OSI) 
increased at the junction connected the SG branch and the stent leading to the 
right common iliac artery (RCIA) where the stent migrated. The OSI and relative 
residence time (RRT) value in superior mesenteric artery increased notably after 
the migration, the RRT continuously increased following the reintervention.
CONCLUSION: Unbalanced flow, resulting in locally high-speed flow, high WSS and 
OSI might significantly affect stent stability. Results suggest that diameters 
and interconnection design of stents in complex cases should take the flow 
division into consideration and computational simulations might be considered as 
a tool for intervention protocol design.

Analytical Challenges in Development of Chemoresistance Predictors for Precision 
Oncology.

Chemoresistance, i.e., tumor insensitivity to chemotherapy, shortens life 
expectancy of cancer patients. Despite the availability of new treatment 
options, initial systemic regimens for solid tumors are dominated by a set of 
standard chemotherapy drugs, and alternative therapies are used only when a 
patient has demonstrated chemoresistance clinically. Chemoresistance predictors 
use laboratory parameters measured on tissue samples to predict the patient's 
response to chemotherapy and help to avoid application of chemotherapy to 
chemoresistant patients. Despite thousands of publications on putative 
chemoresistance predictors, there are only about a dozen predictors that are 
sufficiently accurate for precision oncology. One of the major reasons for 
inaccuracy of predictors is inaccuracy of analytical methods utilized to measure 
their laboratory parameters: an inaccurate method leads to an inaccurate 
predictor. The goal of this study was to identify analytical challenges in 
chemoresistance-predictor development and suggest ways to overcome them. Here we 
describe principles of chemoresistance predictor development via correlating a 
clinical parameter, which manifests disease state, with a laboratory parameter. 
We further classify predictors based on the nature of laboratory parameters and 
analyze advantages and limitations of different predictors using the reliability 
of analytical methods utilized for measuring laboratory parameters as a 
criterion. Our eventual focus is on predictors with known mechanisms of 
reactions involved in drug resistance (drug extrusion, drug degradation, and DNA 
damage repair) and using rate constants of these reactions to establish accurate 
and robust laboratory parameters. Many aspects and conclusions of our analysis 
are applicable to all types of disease biomarkers built upon the correlation of 
clinical and laboratory parameters.

Metallic surfaces that are in contact with solutions are commonly used in 
numerous applications where these surfaces can be damaged by shock wave induced 
bubble collapse. Use of polymer films that coat such surfaces to prevent them 
from damage requires a better understanding of how much harm collapsing bubbles 
produce in the films. In this study, we report the results from coarse-grained 
molecular dynamics simulations to study the damage to polystyrene (PS) films 
coating a hard surface. The damage was caused by a collapsing nanobubble located 
in the proximity of the film and interacting with an impinging shock wave. This 
collapse produces a high-speed water jet that impacts the PS film with a greater 
force than the shock front and creates cavities/pits in the PS film. We observed 
that polymer molecules located in the jet vicinity undergo conformational 
extension in the direction perpendicular to the jet motion, while chain 
molecules in the rest of the film undergo compression. We also observed that 
damage to the film is sensitive to the strength of the shock wave.

INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic has transformed lives across the world. In 
the UK, a public health driven policy of population "lockdown" has had enormous 
personal and economic impact.
METHODS: We compare UK response and outcomes with European countries of similar 
income and healthcare resources. We calibrate estimates of the economic costs as
