Cold expansion technology is a cold-forming process widely used in aeronautics 
to extend the fatigue life of riveted and bolted holes. During this process, an 
oversized mandrel is pushed through the hole in order to yield it and generate 
compressive residual stresses contributing to the fatigue life extension of the 
hole. In this paper, a parametric analysis of the mandrel geometrical data 
(inlet angle straight zone length and diametric interference) and their 
influence on the residual stresses was carried out using a finite element method 
(FEM). The obtained results were compared with the conclusions presented in a 
previous parametric FEM analysis on the influence of the swage geometry in a 
swaging cold-forming process of gun barrels. This process could be considered, 
in a simplified way, as a scale-up of the cold expansion process of small holes, 
and this investigation demonstrated the influence of the diameter ratio (K) on 
the relation between the mandrel or swage geometry and the residual stresses 
obtained after the cold-forming process.

BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was use surface EMG activity to assess changes 
in co-activation of knee flexors and extensors muscle groups during elastic-band 
exercise after 5 weeks of high-velocity elastic-band training in basketball 
players.
METHODS: College male basketball players (N.=18) were randomly divided into one 
of two groups: 1) the elastic-band training group performed low-load and 
high-velocity - lying prone - hamstring curls training three times per week; 2) 
the control group did not do any training. Pre- and post- training assessment 
included concentric knee extension and flexion at 60°/s and 240°/s, and the 
frequency of knee flexion and extension with elastic bands in the prone 
position. The EMG of the rectus femoris, semitendinosus muscles and the long 
head of the biceps femoris were assessed during these activities, and 30-m 
sprint running speed was measured from a stationary start and a running start.
RESULTS: It was shown that high-velocity elastic-band training was 1) feasible, 
2) increased movement velocity and 3) muscle strength, 4) altered neural control 
such that excessive lengthening of the hamstring muscle, and hence 
strain-injuries, may be prevented and 5) improved sprint performance in 
basketball players.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that high-velocity elastic-band training may 
be a tool to prevent hamstring strain-injuries in basketball players.

Depression, anxiety in ovarian cancer patient.

[Article in English]

Halada P, Doničová V, Práznovec I, Pidrman V, Špaček J.

OBJECTIVE: A summary article, which is concluding available data about the 
psychological alterations, especially depression and anxiety, in ovarian cancer 
patients.
DESIGN: Revue article.
SETTING: Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, University Hospital in Hradec 
Králove.
DISCUSSION: Depressive symptoms could arise as a consequence of the stress, 
which is the response to oncological diagnosis, treatment or relapse of the 
oncological disease. This depressive condition is raising concerns in patients, 
family and health care professionals because it is significantly contributing to 
morbidity and at the same time is leading to the increase of the health care 
costs. In general the alteration of the physical and mental functions is 
reducing the average life expectancy. The patients with serious gynecological 
cancer diagnosis are requiring psychological support, which is not always 
satisfactory from their family. It would therefore be desirable to establish 
professional centers or clinics providing counseling and psychotherapy.
CONCLUSION: The summary of the available research data about depression in a 
women with gynaecological cancer has pointed out not only connection between 
depression and ovarian cancer, but has also underlined the importance of this 
problematic for daily praxis and further intensive research.

Purpose: To study the impact of sociodemographic and socioeconomic factors on 
the cataract burden in Caribbean small island developing states (SIDS) using 
disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs).Methods: National and regional age and 
sex specific cataract DALY numbers and rates from 1990 to 2016 for Caribbean 
SIDS, were extracted from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2016. The human 
development index (HDI), healthcare access and quality (HAQ) index, and the 
World Bank's classification of economies were used as socioeconomic status 
indicators. The Gini coefficient, Atkinson, Theil and concentration indices were 
used to measure health inequality. Paired Wilcoxon signed rank test, Pearson 
correlation, and linear regression analyses were performed to evaluate the 
sociodemographic and socioeconomic factors associated with differences in 
cataract burden.Results: Men had higher age-standardized DALY rates than women 
(P < .001) with median rates of 90.72 (Interquartile range [IQR], 87.8-94.2) and 
83.94(IQR, 80.9-86.5), respectively. The burden of cataract increased with age. 
Upper-middle income countries had higher age-standardized DALY rates than high 
income countries (P < .001), with median rates of 90.1 (IQR, 86.8-93.4) and 79.8 
(IQR, 77.5-81.8), respectively. Age-standardized DALY rates were inversely 
correlated with HDI (r = - 0.61, β = - 51.56 [P < .05]) and HAQ (r = - 0.68, β = 
- 0.46 [P < .01). Between-country inequality was negligible, and the burden of 
cataract is greater among the poor.Conclusion: Global trends of socioeconomic 
factors were confirmed. Significantly, men had higher age-standardized DALY 
rates than women. This is an area for further research.

Interleukin-1 (IL-1) is a key mediator of inflammation and immunity. 
Naturally-occurring IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) binds and blocks the IL-1 
receptor-1 (IL-1R1), preventing signaling. Anakinra, a recombinant form of 
IL-1Ra, is used to treat a spectrum of inflammatory diseases. However, anakinra 
is rapidly cleared from the body and requires daily administration. To create a 
longer-lasting alternative, PASylated IL-1Ra (PAS-IL-1Ra) has been generated by 
in-frame fusion of a long, defined-length, N-terminal Pro/Ala/Ser (PAS) 
random-coil polypeptide with IL-1Ra. Here, we compared the efficacy of two 
PAS-IL-1Ra molecules, PAS600-IL-1Ra and PAS800-IL-1Ra (carrying 600 and 800 PAS 
residues, respectively), with that of anakinra in mice. PAS600-IL-1Ra displayed 
markedly extended blood plasma levels 3 days post-administration, whereas 
anakinra was undetectable after 24 h. We also studied PAS600-IL-1Ra and 
PAS800-IL-1Ra for efficacy in monosodium urate (MSU) crystal-induced 
peritonitis. 5 days post-administration, PAS800-IL-1Ra significantly reduced 
leukocyte influx and inflammatory markers in MSU-induced peritonitis, whereas 
equimolar anakinra administered 24 h before MSU challenge was ineffective. The 
6-h pretreatment with equimolar anakinra or PAS800-IL-1Ra before MSU challenge 
similarly reduced inflammatory markers. In cultured A549 lung carcinoma cells, 
anakinra, PAS600-IL-1Ra, and PAS800-IL-Ra reduced IL-1α-induced IL-6 and IL-8 
levels with comparable potency. In human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, 
these molecules suppressed Candida albicans-induced production of the 
cancer-promoting cytokine IL-22. Surface plasmon resonance analyses revealed 
significant binding between PAS-IL-1Ra and IL-1R1, although with a slightly 
lower affinity than anakinra. These results validate PAS-IL-1Ra as an active 
IL-1 antagonist with marked in vivo potency and a significantly extended 
half-life compared with anakinra.

Congenital heart defects can decrease the quality of life and life expectancy in 
affected individuals, and constitute a major burden for the health care systems. 
Endocardial cushion defects are among the most prevalent heart malformations in 
the general population, and are extremely frequent (approximately a 100-fold 
higher prevalence) in children with Down syndrome. Several genes have been 
proposed to be involved in the pathogenesis of these malformations, but no 
common pathogenic DNA variants have been identified so far. Here, we focussed on 
constitutive, epigenetic alterations of function of selected genes, potentially 
important for endocardial cushion development. We used two types of microarrays, 
dedicated for assessment of gene promoter methylation and whole genome 
expression. First, we compared the gene promoter methylation profiles between 
two groups of Down syndrome patients, with and without heart defects of 
endocardial cushion-type. Then, to determine the functional role of the detected 
methylation alterations, we assessed the expression of the genes of interest. We 
detected significant hypermethylation of the NRG1 gene promoter region in 
children with heart defects. NRG1 is a key factor in maturation of endocardial 
cushions. Supplementary gene expression assessment revealed significantly 
decreased activity of the ERBB3, SHC3 and SHC4 genes in children with heart 
defects. The above three genes are closely related to the NRG1 gene and are 
crucial elements of the NRG/ErbB pathway. The results of this pilot study show 
that hypermethylation of the NRG1 gene promoter can reflect the functional 
genome alteration contributing to development of congenital heart defects of 
endocardial cushion-type.

BACKGROUND: We assessed the cost-effectiveness of single-inhaler fluticasone 
furoate (FF)/umeclidinium (UMEC)/vilanterol (VI) versus FF/VI or UMEC/VI from a 
Canadian public healthcare perspective, incorporating data from the IMPACT trial 
in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (NCT02164513).
METHODS: Baseline inputs and treatment effects from IMPACT were populated into 
the validated GALAXY-COPD disease progression model. Canadian unit costs and 
drug costs (Canadian dollars [C$], 2017) were applied to healthcare resource 
utilization and treatments. Future costs and health outcomes were discounted at 
1.5% annually. Analyses were probabilistic, and outputs included exacerbation 
rates, costs, and life years (LYs) and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) 
gained.
RESULTS: Compared with FF/VI and UMEC/VI over a lifetime horizon, the analyses 
predicted that treatment with FF/UMEC/VI resulted in fewer moderate and severe 
exacerbations, more LYs and more QALYs gained, with a small incremental cost. 
The base-case incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) per QALY gained was 
C$18,989 (95% confidence interval [CI]: C$14,665, C$25,753) versus FF/VI and 
C$13,776 (95% CI: C$9787, C$19,448) versus UMEC/VI. FF/UMEC/VI remained 
cost-effective versus both FF/VI and UMEC/VI in all sensitivity analyses, 
including in scenario analyses that considered different intervention and 
comparator discontinuation rates, and treatment effects for subsequent therapy.
CONCLUSION: Treatment with FF/UMEC/VI was predicted to improve outcomes and be a 
cost-effective treatment option for patients with symptomatic COPD and a history 
of exacerbations compared with FF/VI or UMEC/VI, in Canada.

OBJECTIVE: This study analyzes the cost-effectiveness of culture-based treatment 
(CBT) versus empirical treatment (ET) as a guide to antibiotic selection and use 
in hospitalized patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A model was developed from the individual patient data of 
adults with CAP hospitalized at an academic hospital in Indonesia between 2014 
and 2017 (ICD-10 J.18x). The directed antibiotic was assessed based on 
microbiological culture results in terms of the impact on hospital costs and 
life expectancy (LE). We conducted subgroup analyses for implementing CBT and ET 
in adults under 60 years, elderly patients (≥ 60 years), moderate-severe CAP 
(PSI class III-V) cases, and ICU patients. The model was designed with a 
lifetime horizon and adjusted patients' ages to the average LE of the Indonesian 
population with a 3% discount each for cost and LE. We applied a sensitivity 
analyses on 1,000 simulation cohorts to examine the economic acceptability of 
CBT in practice. Willingness to pay (WTP) was defined as 1 or 3 times the 
Indonesian GDP per capita (US$ 3,570).
RESULTS: CBT would effectively increase the patients' LE and be cost-saving 
(dominant) as well. The ET group's hospitalization cost had the greatest 
influence on economic outcomes. Subgroup analyses showed that CBT's dominance 
remained for Indonesian patients aged under 60 years or older, patients with 
moderate-severe CAP, and patients in the ICU. Acceptability rates of CBT over ET 
were 74.9% for 1xWTP and 82.8% for 3xWTP in the base case.
CONCLUSION: Both sputum and blood cultures provide advantages for cost-saving 
and LE gains for hospitalized patients with CAP. CBT is cost-effective in 
patients all ages, PSI class III or above patients, and ICU patients.

Anthocyanin and proanthocyanidin biosynthesis pathways are believed to overlap. 
This study examined proanthocyanidin accumulation in seed coats of morning 
glories (Ipomoea nil and I. purpurea) carrying mutations in CHS-D, CHI, and ANS 
genes encoding chalcone synthase, chalcone isomerase, and anthocyanidin 
synthase, respectively. Chemical staining revealed that mutants accumulate 
proanthocyanidin normally. Thus, the tested genes are not essential to 
proanthocyanidin biosynthesis, but are essential to anthocyanin biosynthesis in 
flowers and stems. Based on the results and the I. nil draft genome sequence, 
the genes involved in proanthocyanidin biosynthesis, including a new copy of the 
flavanone 3-hydroxylase gene could be predicted. Moreover, the genome has no 
homologs for known enzymes involved in producing flavan-3-ols, the starter and 
extension units of proanthocyanidin. These results suggested that I. nil 
produces flavan-3-ols through an undiscovered biosynthesis pathway. To 
characterize proanthocyanidin pigmentation further, we conducted mutant 
screening using a large I. nil population. We discovered that the brown mutant 
lines (exhibiting brown seeds and normal anthocyanin pigmentation) do not 
accumulate proanthocyanidin in their seed coats. Thus, the brown mutation should 
be useful for further investigations into the various mechanisms controlling 
anthocyanin and proanthocyanidin pathways.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate costs and quality-adjusted life years of 
rehabilitation combined with abobotulinumtoxinA (aboBoNT-A) (rehab/aboBoNT-A) vs 
rehabilitation alone (rehab) in post-stroke spasticity in Italy.
DESIGN: Based on both Italian National Health Service and societal perspectives, 
a 2-year cost-utility analysis model was performed. Subject/patients: The 
cost-utility analysis model considered hypothetical patients.
METHODS: The cost-utility analysis model was populated with data concerning 
demographics, disease severity, healthcare and non-healthcare resource 
consumption. Data were collected via a questionnaire administered to 3 highly 
experienced Italian physiatrists (864 out of 930 post-stroke spasticity patients 
on rehab/aboBoNT-A in total). Costs are expressed in Euro (€) based on the year 
2018.
RESULTS: The cost to society (rounded to the nearest whole €) was €22,959 
(rehab/aboBoNT-A) vs €11,866 (rehab). Italian National Health Service-funded 
cost was €7,593 (rehab/aboBoNT-A) vs €1,793 (rehab). Over a period of 2 years 
rehab/aboBoNT-A outperforms rehab in terms of quality-adjusted life years gained 
(1.620 vs 1.150). The incremental cost-utility ratio was €12,341 (Italian 
National Health Service viewpoint) and €23,601 (societal viewpoint). Sensitivity 
analyses confirmed the robustness of the baseline results.
CONCLUSION: Despite some limitations, the higher number of quality-adjusted life

PURPOSE: To assess the global burden of glaucoma by year, age, sex, regions, 
socioeconomic development, and mean years of schooling (MYS) by using 
disability-adjusted life year (DALY), then to explore the health inequality with 
socioeconomic status in glaucoma.
METHODS: Global, national, and regional DALY data of glaucoma by year, age, and 
sex were extracted from the Global Health Data Exchange. Human development index 
(HDI) and national MYS in 2015 were obtained from the Human Development Report 
(HDR) 2016. Mann-Whitney U test was performed to explore the sexual difference 
in global DALYs. Kruskal-Wallis tests were performed to explore the difference 
of age-standardized DALY rates across WHO regions and HDI-related country 
groups. Linear regression analyses were performed to explore the association 
between age-standardized DALY rates with HDI and MYS. Health-related Gini 
coefficients and concentration indexes were calculated to evaluate the trends in 
health inequality of glaucoma since 1990.
RESULTS: DALY numbers, crude DALY rates, and age-standardized DALY rates 
increased by 118.0%, 55.22%, and 12.12%, respectively, since 1990. Global DALY 
numbers and crude DALY rates increased with age, and Mann-Whitney U test 
revealed no significant sex difference in global DALY numbers (P = 0.807) and 
global crude DALYs rates (P = 0.976) for each age group in 2016. Africa and 
Eastern Mediterranean had higher age-standardized DALY rates than the global one 
in 2016. Kruskal-Wallis test indicated significant difference in 
age-standardized DALY rates across WHO regions (χ2 = 94.227, P < 0.001). Linear 
regression analysis indicated that HDI (adjusted R2 = 0.079; F = 16.722, 
P < 0.001) and MYS (adjusted R2 = 0.108; F = 23.048, P < 0.001) had a 
significant effect on age-standardized DALY rates. Gini coefficients rose from 
0.290 in 1990 to 0.292 in 2015 with a peak value 0.299 in 2005, concentration 
index declined from 1990 (- 0.099) to 2000 (- 0.077) with reaching a low peak 
value, then rapidly increased to - 0.097 in 2015.
CONCLUSIONS: With population growth and aging, global burden of glaucoma is 
increasing and older age, lower socioeconomic status, and lower MYS are 
associated with higher glaucoma burden. Our results help to gain a better 
understanding of glaucoma and guide future health policies tailored for public.

The study empirically examines the effects of socio-economic (human capital), 
macroeconomic (per capita GDP), demographic (fertility rate, urbanization), and 
environmental variables (carbon emissions) on child mortality in South Asia. For 
empirical analysis, panel cointegration technique is used by using data for five 
South Asian countries for the period 1973 to 2015. First, it is found that the 
variables have unit roots at levels but are stationary at first differences, 
which indicates the possibility of cointegration. Cointegration test results 
show that long-run cointegrating relationship holds among variables. Fully 
Modified OLS (FMOLS) and Dynamic OLS (DOLS) methods are applied to find the 
parameter estimates. The results of long-run estimates show that human capital, 
per capita income, and urbanization reduce child mortality while high fertility 
rate and environmental degradation increase child mortality in the region. It is 
also found that trade openness, immunization, food security, and high life 
expectancy also decrease child mortality and that population density increases 
child mortality.

BACKGROUND: Crizotinib, ceritinib, and alectinib improved survival in patients 
with anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) arrangement non-small-cell lung cancer 
(NSCLC); however, the long-term economic outcomes of using ceritinib and 
alectinib versus crizotinib are still unclear.
OBJECTIVE: This analysis aimed to evaluate the cost effectiveness of ceritinib 
and alectinib versus crizotinib in the Chinese healthcare setting.
METHODS: A Markov model was developed to project the economic and health 
outcomes for the treatment of advanced NSCLC with ceritinib, alectinib or 
crizotinib. A network meta-analysis was performed to calculate the hazard ratios 
of ceritinib and alectinib versus crizotinib by pooling published trials. Cost 
and utility values were obtained from the literature, and one-way and 
probabilistic sensitivity analyses were carried out to determine the robustness 
of the model outcomes. The primary outputs included total cost, life-years 
(LYs), quality-adjusted LYs (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
(ICER).
RESULTS: Treatment with alectinib and ceritinib yielded an additional 1.00 and 
1.09 QALYs and incremental costs of $62,232 and $15,165, resulting in an ICER of 
$62,231 and $13,905 per QALY compared with crizotinib, respectively. Parameters 
related to drug costs and progression-free survival were the main drivers of the 
model outcomes. From the probabilistic sensitivity analysis, ceritinib and 
alectinib had a 99.9% and 0% probability of being cost effective, respectively, 
at a willingness-to-pay threshold of US$28,410/QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that compared with crizotinib and alectinib, 
ceritinib is a cost-effective option for treatment-naïve patients with 
ALK-positive advanced NSCLC.

Mortality effects of exposure to air pollution and other environmental hazards 
are often described by the estimated number of "premature" or "attributable" 
deaths and the economic value of a reduction in exposure as the product of an 
estimate of "statistical lives saved" and a "value per statistical life." These 
terms can be misleading because the number of deaths advanced by exposure cannot 
be determined from mortality data alone, whether from epidemiology or randomized 
trials (it is not statistically identified). The fraction of deaths "attributed" 
to exposure is conventionally derived as the hazard fraction (R - 1)/R, where R 
is the relative risk of mortality between high and low exposure levels. The 
fraction of deaths advanced by exposure (the "etiologic" fraction) can be 
substantially larger or smaller: it can be as large as one and as small as 1/e 
(≈0.37) times the hazard fraction (if the association is causal and zero 
otherwise). Recent literature reveals misunderstanding about these concepts. 
Total life years lost in a population due to exposure can be estimated but 
cannot be disaggregated by age or cause of death. Economic valuation of a change 
in exposure-related mortality risk to a population is not affected by inability 
to know the fraction of deaths that are etiologic. When individuals facing 
larger or smaller changes in mortality risk cannot be identified, the mean 
change in population hazard is sufficient for valuation; otherwise, the economic 
value can depend on the distribution of risk reductions.

447. Working at Older Ages: Why it’s important, how it affects health, and the
policy  options to support health capacity for work [Internet].

Increasing statutory retirement ages and limiting routes to early retirement are 
frequent policy responses to population ageing, but this is unlikely to have the 
desired impact if poor health is a barrier to people working at older ages. 
Increasing the pension age, without addressing the constraints older workers 
face when participating in the workforce, can have serious negative health 
consequences for this group of people. Pension ages have been increased in 
response to improvements in life expectancy, but these improvements have not 
always been accompanied by reduced disability rates, as people are living longer 
but not necessarily in better health. Poor mental health is a major source of 
disability, so improving the mental health of working populations remains a 
critical policy goal if we want future populations to reach older age in good 
health and to continue working. A strategy to improve the health capacity of 
older workers would need to combine three different types of policy and 
intervention: –. workplace-based health and wellness interventions are promising 
and often underutilized strategies to promote health and increase the work 
capacity of older workers – not only to reduce health care expenses and 
injuries, but also to help workers maintain engagement and increase productivity 
in older age. –. employer accommodation practices have an important role to play 
in helping older workers with health problems to stay in work. –. The social 
protection system might be critical to ensuring that older workers who 
experience functional problems do not leave the labour force, for example, by 
ensuring that disability insurance/benefits policies support the integration of 
older people into the workforce. Prejudices and misconceptions about the 
productivity of older workers result in reduced investment in the older 
workforce, even though they have enormous potential to contribute to the 
economy. Interventions can support older workers to benefit from workplace 
programmes and policies to maintain productivity, while at the same time 
promoting their physical and mental health.

Background Management of abdominal branches associated with Stanford type B 
aortic dissection is controversial without definite criteria for therapy after 
thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR). This is in part due to lack of data 
on natural history related to branch vessels and their relationship with the 
dissection flap, true lumen, and false lumen. Purpose To investigate the natural 
history of abdominal branches after TEVAR for type B aortic dissection and the 
relationship between renal artery anatomy and renal volume as a surrogate 
measure of perfusion. Materials and Methods This study included patients who 
underwent TEVAR for complicated type B dissection from January 2012 to March 
2017 at 20 centers. Abdominal aortic branches were classified with following 
features: patency, branch vessel origin, and presence of extension of the aortic 
dissection into a branch (pattern 1, supplied by the true lumen without branch 
dissection; pattern 2, supplied by the true lumen with branch dissection, etc). 
The branch artery patterns before TEVAR were compared with those of the last 
follow-up CT (mean interval, 19.7 months) for spontaneous healing. Patients with 
one kidney supplied by pattern 1 and the other kidney by a different pattern 
were identified, and kidney volumes over the course were compared by using a 
simple linear regression model. Results Two hundred nine patients (mean age ± 
standard deviation, 66 years ± 13; 165 men and 44 women; median follow-up, 18 
months) were included. Four hundred fifty-nine abdominal branches at the last 
follow-up were evaluable. Spontaneous healing of the dissected branch occurred 
in 63% (64 of 102) of pattern 2 branches. Regarding the other patterns, 6.5% 
(six of 93) of branches achieved spontaneous healing. In 79 patients, renal 
volumes decreased in kidneys with pattern 2 branches with more than 50% stenosis 
and branches supplied by the aortic false lumen (patterns 3 and 4) compared with 
contralateral kidneys supplied by pattern 1 (pattern 2 vs pattern 1: -16% ± 16 
vs 0.10% ± 11, P = .002; patterns 3 and 4 vs pattern 1: -13% ± 14 vs 8.5% ± 14, 
P = .004). Conclusion Spontaneous healing occurs more frequently in dissected 
branches arising from the true lumen than in other branch patterns. Renal artery 
branches supplied by the aortic false lumen or a persistently dissected artery 
with greater than 50% stenosis are associated with significantly greater kidney 
volume loss. © RSNA, 2019 Online supplemental material is available for this

Feasibility and Acceptability of a Lifestyle Intervention For Individuals With 
Bipolar Disorder.

Sylvia LG, Janos JA, Pegg SL, Dufour SC, Chang WC, Bernstein EE, Davis B, Ellard 
KK, Deckersbach T, Nierenberg AA.

Individuals with bipolar disorder are at greater risk for cardiovascular disease 
and are less likely to adhere to lifestyle interventions than the general 
population. To decrease cardiovascular risk and improve adherence to lifestyle 
interventions, we developed the Nutrition Exercise and Wellness Treatment (NEW 
Tx). NEW Tx is an 18-session, 20-week cognitive behavioral therapy-based 
treatment comprising 3 modules: Nutrition, Exercise, and Wellness. To evaluate 
the feasibility and acceptability of this intervention as well as predictors of 
treatment satisfaction and expectations, 38 adult outpatients with bipolar 
disorder were randomized to either NEW Tx or a waitlist control condition. There 
was no statistically significant difference in dropout rates between the groups 
(26.3% in NEW Tx, 31.6% in the control condition). In the NEW Tx condition, 
participants attended a mean of 66.7% of sessions and reported moderate to high 
satisfaction. There were no study-related adverse events. We also found that 
expectations, but not perceived credibility (or believability), of NEW Tx (as 
measured by the Credibility/Expectancy Questionnaire) at baseline predicted 
treatment satisfaction (as measured by the Care Satisfaction Questionnaire) 
posttreatment. Manic symptoms at baseline predicted treatment satisfaction, and 
marital status predicted one's expectations of lifestyle interventions. Data 
suggest that NEW Tx is a feasible and acceptable intervention for individuals 
with bipolar disorder and that further research is warranted to explore 
potential moderators of treatment expectations and credibility in this clinical 
population.

BACKGROUND AND AIM OF THE WORK: Reverse shoulder arthroplasty (RSA) is becoming 
treatment of choice in glenohumeral arthropathies with massive lesion of the 
rotator cuff, due to a gradual extension of indications and new designs that 
provide better outcome. In this study we compared two different reverse shoulder 
prosthesis designs, defined as Inlay (or typical Grammont type) and a relatively 
new model defined as Onlay (that preserves tuberosity bone stock). We analyzed 
clinical, biomechanical and radiological outcomes, as well as complications of 
RSA in these two groups.
METHODS: We performed a prospective study on a population of 42 patients 
undergoing Reverse Shoulder Replacement by a single expert surgeon. We consider 
21 patients (group A) who underwent to reverse shoulder replacement with a 
curved onlay steam with 145° inclination (Ascend Flex group, Wright medical, 
Memphis, TN, USA)  and 21 patients who underwent to reverse shoulder replacement 
with a traditional Inlay Grammont steam (Modular Shoulder System SMR, Systema 
Multiplana Randelli; Lima-LTO, San Daniele del Friuli, Italy) between August 
2010 and October 2018. We studied the following items: active range of motion 
(AROM), radiological parameters (lateralization shoulder angle LSA, 
Distalization Shoulder Angle DSA), functional scale (Constant-Murley Score), 
post-operative complications (infection, aseptical implant mobilitazion, 
residual pain, scapular notching, fractures, tuberosity reabsorbtion, 
dislocation, bleedings, nerve palsy, pulmonary embolus).
RESULTS: A significant improvement in ROM and functional score (Constant 
Shoulder Score) were observed in both groups. Group A (Onlay design 145°, medial 
tray) provides improvement in adduction, extension and external rotation 
compared to group B. No significant differences were found in abduction, 
external rotation and forward flexion. At 6 months follow-up, pain relief was 
detected in all patients. Although complications occur in a high percentage of 
patients in literature, no postoperative complications were observed in our 
cases series.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed how RSA is a real solution to improve quality of 
life and to restore pain-free shoulder ROM in patients where cuff tear 
arthropathy occurs. Onlay design 145° may provides better active external 
rotation, extension, adduction: it is necessary to continue follow up and 
include more cases to prove these data.

Formal axioms in biomedical ontologies improve analysis and interpretation of 
associated data.

MOTIVATION: Over the past years, significant resources have been invested into 
formalizing biomedical ontologies. Formal axioms in ontologies have been 
developed and used to detect and ensure ontology consistency, find unsatisfiable 
classes, improve interoperability, guide ontology extension through the 
application of axiom-based design patterns and encode domain background 
knowledge. The domain knowledge of biomedical ontologies may have also the 
potential to provide background knowledge for machine learning and predictive 
modelling.
RESULTS: We use ontology-based machine learning methods to evaluate the 
contribution of formal axioms and ontology meta-data to the prediction of 
protein-protein interactions and gene-disease associations. We find that the 
background knowledge provided by the Gene Ontology and other ontologies 
significantly improves the performance of ontology-based prediction models 
through provision of domain-specific background knowledge. Furthermore, we find 
that the labels, synonyms and definitions in ontologies can also provide 
background knowledge that may be exploited for prediction. The axioms and 
meta-data of different ontologies contribute to improving data analysis in a 
context-specific manner. Our results have implications on the further 
development of formal knowledge bases and ontologies in the life sciences, in 
particular as machine learning methods are more frequently being applied. Our 
findings motivate the need for further development, and the systematic, 
application-driven evaluation and improvement, of formal axioms in ontologies.

BACKGROUND: The Global Burden of Disease study has generated a wealth of data on 
death and disability in Europe. At a time of change for the European Union and 
European Region of WHO, with a new Health Commissioner and Regional Director, 
respectively, a review of health trends can contribute to identify outstanding 
needs and gaps. This paper reports a summary of the burden of disease in the 
European Union (EU) in 2017 (compared with 2007).
METHODS: For the whole EU and each country, mortality by causes of death, 
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and life expectancies are reported.
RESULTS: In 2017, the age-standardized mortality and DALY rates were of 452.6 
and 19 663.3 per 100 000 inhabitants, respectively. The diseases contributing 
most to mortality were ischaemic heart disease (IHD), dementias and stroke, 
while low back pain and IHD accounted for the highest burden of DALYs.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, there was an improvement in the state of health in the EU
