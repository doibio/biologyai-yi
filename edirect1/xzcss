BACKGROUND & AIMS: Cirrhosis is often complicated by reduced muscle mass and 
strength, which limits the ability to perform daily activities and affects 
quality of life. Resistance training can increase muscle strength and mass in 
elderly and chronically ill patients. We performed a randomized controlled trial 
to investigate whether resistance training increases muscle strength and size in 
patients with compensated cirrhosis.
METHODS: We performed a prospective study of 39 patients with cirrhosis 
(Child-Pugh class A or B) seen at an outpatient clinic in Denmark from January 
2015 through March 2017. Participants protein intake and activity levels were 
registered daily. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to a group that 
performed 36 1-hour sessions of physical exercise (supervised progressive 
resistance training for 1 hour, 3 times weekly for 12 weeks) or a control group 
(no change in daily activity level). Maximal muscle strength was measured as the 
peak torque in isokinetic knee extension and muscle size was measured as the 
cross-sectional area of the quadriceps muscle, assessed by magnetic resonance 
imaging of the thigh.
RESULTS: The exercise group increased their muscle strength by 13% (from a mean 
119 Nm to 134 Nm)-an 11 Nm greater gain in mean strength than that of the 
control group (P = .05). The exercise group increased their quadriceps 
cross-sectional area by 10% (from a mean 58.5 cm2 to 64.6 cm2)-a 4.4 cm2 greater 
gain than that of the control group (P < .01). The exercise group had 
significant increases in whole-body lean mass and body cell mass, and 
significant increases in 6-minute walking distance and the mental component 
summary of the short form-36 questionnaire. Adverse events were minor and equal 
between groups.
CONCLUSIONS: In a randomized trial of patients with compensated cirrhosis, we 
found that 12 weeks of supervised progressive resistance training increased 
muscle strength and size and had beneficial effects on general performance 
measures, compared with patients who did not change their daily activity routine 
(control subjects). ClinicalTrials.gov no: NCT02343653.

In recent decades, longer life expectancy, the consequent greater number of 
patients with often concurrent diseases, and the need of healthcare institutions 
to reduce the costs of services, have engendered changes in all European 
healthcare systems. On one side, healthcare systems increasingly rely on the 
self-management skills of patients, who undertake a growing amount of 'sickness 
work' from which they are relieved only in the case of severe illness. On the 
other, the inability of public healthcare systems to satisfy the increased 
demand for care has led to the growth of private healthcare organizations as 
well as cooperatives of health professionals who offer their services privately. 
The care of citizens, therefore, is increasingly distributed across networks of 
actors with very different objectives, logics of action and professional 
backgrounds (public and private healthcare organizations, community medical 
services, voluntary organizations). Despite the attention devoted by social 
studies of medicine to the work done by citizens in supporting the work of 
clinicians and nurses, the work performed in connection to the management of 
care networks have been only marginally investigated. Drawing on a qualitative 
research carried out in the Province of Trento (Italy) and focused on the 
different ways in which elderly people with chronic conditions manage their 
conditions outside the healthcare and welfare institutions, in this paper we are 
interested in deepening the understanding of the invisible work citizens perform 
in connection to the management of care services and professionals. That is, the 
work needed in order to activate, mend and coordinate complex networks of care.

Observational designs in clinical multiple sclerosis research: Particulars, 
practices and potentialities.

Observational studies investigate a wide range of topics in multiple sclerosis 
research. This paper presents an overview of the various observational designs 
and their applications in clinical studies. Observational studies are well 
suited for making discoveries and assessing new explanations of phenomena, but 
less so for establishing causal relationships, due to confounding by indication 
(selection bias), co-morbidity, socio-economic or other factors. Whether 
observational findings are demonstrative, indicative or only suggestive, depends 
on the research question, whether and how the design fits this question, 
analytical techniques, and the quality of data. Observational studies may be 
cross-sectional vs. longitudinal, and prospective vs. retrospective. The term 
'retrograde' is proposed to explicate that cross-sectional studies may obtain 
data that cover (long) preceding periods. Case reports and case series are 
usually based on accidental observations or routinely collected data. 
Cross-sectional studies, by simultaneously assessing clinical phenomena and 
external factors, enable the discovery and quantification of associations. In 
ecological studies the unit of analysis is population or group, and 
relationships on patient level cannot be established. A cohort study is a 
longitudinal study that investigates patients with a defining characteristic, 
e.g. diagnosis or specific treatment, by analyzing data acquired at various 
intervals. Prospective cohort studies use (some) data that are not yet available 
at the time the research is conceived, whereas in retrospective studies the data 
already exist. In a case-control study a representative group of patients with a 
specific clinical feature is compared with controls, and the frequencies at 
which an external factor, e.g. infection, has occurred in each group is 
compared; in a nested case-control study controls are drawn from a fully known 
cohort. Randomized controlled trial (RCT)-extension studies are informative 
because, due to RCT randomization, they are free from confounding by indication. 
Patient or disease registries are organised systems for the long-term collection 
of uniform data on a population that is defined by a particular disease, 
condition or exposure, with the purpose to study changes over time. In 
pharmacotherapeutic research, accidental observations of unexpected beneficial 
effects may lead to further research into a drug's efficacy in other conditions. 
Uncontrolled phase 1 studies investigate safety and dosing aspects. 
Observational studies are alternatives to RCTs when these are not feasible for 
ethical or practical reasons. Phase 4 observational studies play a crucial role 
in the evaluation of the effectiveness of treatments in daily practice, the 
validation of RCT-based side effect profiles, and the discovery of late 
occurring or rare, potentially life-threatening side effects. Combinations of 
multidisciplinary longitudinal data bases into large data sets enable the 
development of algorithms for personalized treatments. To improve the reporting 
of observational findings on treatment effectiveness, it is proposed that 
abstracts define the research question(s) the study was meant to answer, study 
design and analytical methods, and identify and quantify the patient population, 
treatment of interest, relevant outcomes and the study's strengths and 
limitations. The development of guidelines for Strengthening the Reporting of 
Observational Studies in Effectiveness Research (STROBER), as an extension of 
the guidelines used in epidemiology, is wanted.

Neurodegenerative diseases are among the leading causes of disability and death 
worldwide. The disease-related socioeconomic burden is expected to increase with 
the steadily increasing life expectancy. In spite of decades of clinical and 
basic research, most strategies designed to manage degenerative brain diseases 
are palliative. This is not surprising as neurodegeneration progresses 
"silently" for decades before symptoms are noticed. Importantly, conceptual 
models with heuristic value used to study neurodegeneration have been 
constructed retrospectively, based on signs and symptoms already present in 
affected patients; a circumstance that may confound causes and consequences. 
Hence, innovative, paradigm-shifting views of the etiology of these diseases are 
necessary to enable their timely prevention and treatment. Here, we outline four 
alternative views, not mutually exclusive, on different etiological paths toward 
neurodegeneration. First, we propose neurodegeneration as being a secondary 
outcome of a primary cardiovascular cause with vascular pathology disrupting the 
vital homeostatic interactions between the vasculature and the brain, resulting 
in cognitive impairment, dementia, and cerebrovascular events such as stroke. 
Second, we suggest that the persistence of senescent cells in neuronal circuits 
may favor, together with systemic metabolic diseases, neurodegeneration to 
occur. Third, we argue that neurodegeneration may start in response to altered 
body and brain trophic interactions established via the hardwire that connects 
peripheral targets with central neuronal structures or by means of extracellular 
vesicle (EV)-mediated communication. Lastly, we elaborate on how lifespan body 
dysbiosis may be linked to the origin of neurodegeneration. We highlight the 
existence of bacterial products that modulate the gut-brain axis causing 
neuroinflammation and neuronal dysfunction. As a concluding section, we end by 
recommending research avenues to investigate these etiological paths in the 
future. We think that this requires an integrated, interdisciplinary conceptual 
research approach based on the investigation of the multimodal aspects of 
physiology and pathophysiology. It involves utilizing proper conceptual models, 
experimental animal units, and identifying currently unused opportunities 
derived from human data. Overall, the proposed etiological paths and 
experimental recommendations will be important guidelines for future 
cross-discipline research to overcome the translational roadblock and to develop 
causative treatments for neurodegenerative diseases.

Longer life expectancy has led to an increase in the prevalence of age-related 
cognitive decline and dementia worldwide. Due to the current lack of effective 
treatment for these conditions, preventive strategies represent a research 
priority. A large body of evidence suggests that nutrition is involved in the 
pathogenesis of age-related cognitive decline, but also that it may play a 
critical role in slowing down its progression. At a population level, healthy 
dietary patterns interventions, such as the Mediterranean and the MIND diets, 
have been associated with improved cognitive performance and a decreased risk of 
neurodegenerative disease development. In the era of evidence-based medicine and 
patient-centered healthcare, personalized nutritional recommendations would 
offer a considerable opportunity in preventing cognitive decline progression. 
N-of-1 clinical trials have emerged as a fundamental design in evidence-based 
medicine. They consider each individual as the only unit of observation and 
intervention. The aggregation of series of N-of-1 clinical trials also enables 
population-level conclusions. This review provides a general view of the current 
scientific evidence regarding nutrition and cognitive decline, and critically 
states its limitations when translating results into the clinical practice. 
Furthermore, we suggest methodological strategies to develop N-of-1 clinical 
trials focused on nutrition and cognition in an older population. Finally, we 
evaluate the potential challenges that researchers may face when performing 
studies in precision nutrition and cognition.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disease 
affecting multiple organ systems that runs an unpredictable course and may 
present with a wide variety of clinical manifestations. Advances in treatment 
over the last decades, such as use of corticosteroids and conventional 
immunosuppressive drugs, have improved life expectancy of SLE sufferers. 
Unfortunately, in many cases effective management of SLE is still related to 
severe drug-induced toxicity and contributes to organ function deterioration and 
infective complications, particularly among patients with refractory disease 
and/or lupus nephritis. Consequently, there is an unmet need for drugs with a 
better efficacy and safety profile. A range of different biologic agents have 
been proposed and subjected to clinical trials, particularly dedicated to this 
subset of patients whose disease is inadequately controlled by conventional 
treatment regimes. Unfortunately, most of these trials have given unsatisfactory 
results, with belimumab being the only targeted therapy approved for the 
treatment of SLE so far. Despite these pitfalls, several novel biologic agents 
targeting B cells, T cells, or cytokines are constantly being evaluated in 
clinical trials. It seems that they may enhance the therapeutic efficacy when 
combined with standard therapies. These efforts raise the hope that novel drugs 
for patients with refractory SLE may be available in the near future. This 
article reviews the current biological therapies being tested in the treatment 
of SLE.

BACKGROUND: Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) can be treated using a 
vonoprazan-first strategy (first-line treatment with vonoprazan), or 
esomeprazole-first/rabeprazole-first strategies (first-line treatment with 
proton-pump inhibitors [PPIs], esomeprazole/rabeprazole, followed by a switch to 
vonoprazan). This cost-utility analysis used long-term simulation modeling to 
evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a vonoprazan-first strategy compared with the 
esomeprazole-first and rabeprazole-first strategies.
METHODS: A Markov simulation model was developed to evaluate the 
cost-effectiveness of vonoprazan-first, esomeprazole-first, and 
rabeprazole-first strategies, comprising healing and maintenance therapies, over 
5 years (4-week cycles). Healing therapy began with the administration of a 
normal dose of drug per real-world practice. If patients were not healed 
endoscopically, either a longer duration of healing therapy was provided 
(vonoprazan), the dose was increased (rabeprazole), or patients were switched to 
vonoprazan (immediately for esomeprazole, and after dose-escalation for 
rabeprazole, respectively). Healed patients received maintenance (lower/same 
dose as healing therapy). Recurrence resulted in re-challenge with healing 
therapy. Transition probabilities were derived from the results of indirect 
comparisons (network meta-analysis) and costs calculated from the Japanese payer 
perspective. Outcomes were defined as quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), with 
utilities based on published values.
RESULTS: Expected costs of the vonoprazan-, esomeprazole-, and rabeprazole-first 
strategies were ¥36,194, ¥76,719, and ¥41,105, respectively, over 5 years. QALY 
gains for vonoprazan-first strategy versus the esomeprazole- and 
rabeprazole-first strategies were 0.014 and 0.003, respectively. Both estimated 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were dominant and robust to two 
sensitivity analyses.
CONCLUSIONS: Vonoprazan-first strategy increased QALYs and appeared to be 
cost-effective for GERD patients compared with the esomeprazole- or 
rabeprazole-first strategies.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of bariatric 
surgery (BS) compared to non-surgical treatment (NST) in Korean people with 
morbid obesity according to comorbidities and body mass index (BMI) severity.
METHODS: The target cohort was people with morbid obesity, defined as BMI of 
≥ 35 kg/m2, or obese people with BMI of 30-34.9 kg/m2 having obesity-related 
comorbidities. A decision-tree model for 1-year obesity treatment and Markov 
model for the rest of life were used. In the decision-tree model, the 
comorbidity remission rate and BMI change after 1-year treatment were decided 
based on a prospective clinical trial. In the Markov model, the transition 
probabilities were calculated considering the BMI level and age. The starting 
age of 20 years, a cycle length of 1 year, a time horizon of 80 years, and a 5% 
discount rate were applied for the base case from the healthcare system 
perspective.
RESULTS: In the base case, BS improved quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and 
was the cost-effective option in total cohort (incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio of BS vs. NST was 674 USD/QALY). It was shown to be cost-effective in all 
subgroup analyses based on BMI level. In particular, BS was a dominant 
alternative for the subgroup with basal BMI of 35.0-37.4 kg/m2. Various 
sensitivity analyses showed the robustness of results indicating the 
cost-effectiveness of BS.
CONCLUSION: BS at BMI of > 30 kg/m2 was more effective than NST for a reduction 
in BMI and remission of obesity-related comorbidities and was cost-effective in 
Korea.

Indirect costs associated with deaths of children aged 0-14 years from measles 
in a weak health system and conflict and fragile zone: the case of Somalia.

This study recognises periodic outbreaks of measles continue to affect conflict 
and fragile zones in the least developed countries. This study set out to 
provide evidence for the indirect costs or economic loss associated with 
measles-related deaths among children aged 0-14 years in Somalia. Using 
epidemiologic and economic data, the indirect cost was calculated based on the 
framework of the World Health Organisation guide of identifying the economic 
consequences of disease and injury. The baseline indirect cost was computed as 
the product of discounted future productive years of life lost (PYLL), 
non-health gross domestic product per capita (NHGDPPC) and the estimated total 
measles deaths (ETMD). The model was adjusted for conflict and fragility 
conditions and further extension considered a finite and stable upper limit 
growth of the instability-adjusted NHGDPPC. To discount future costs, a rate of 
3% was applied. Using a ±20% variability assumption of the epidemiologic and 
economic factor inputs, a sensitivity analysis was conducted to account for 
uncertainty. In 2015 values, the ETMD of 3723 measles deaths of children aged 
0-14 years could decrease non-health GDP of the country by $23.46 million, a 
potential loss of $6303 per death over the discounted PYLL. The loss would 
increase by 5.3% when adjusted for conflict and fragility conditions. Assuming 
growth, the future adjusted loss is expected to be $35.91 million in 2015 
values. Girl-child deaths accounted for 51.2% of the burden. Results are robust 
to the variations in the model inputs, although sensitivity analyses suggest the 
proportion of total measles deaths and the discount rate accounted for greater 
uncertainty of the loss than do the proportion of growth and instability 
assumption. Conflict and fragility accounted for the least uncertainty, perhaps 
confirming their relative perpetuity in Somalia. Results show significant 
indirect cost related to measles deaths of children, exacerbated by conflict and 
fragility. This is an economic burden, but one which the health system, 
policy-makers, government and other stakeholders should be prepared to 
colossally discount by collectively taking measles surveillance and security 
measures now to reduce further deaths in the future.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: There have been numerous studies of oral health status 
of school children and young population; however, similar studies in elderly 
population in India are lacking. With advances in medical science and consequent 
increase in life expectancy, elderly population is on the rise and is a subject 
of growing concern for public health policy. Hence, an attempt was made to study 
factors influencing decayed, missing, and filled teeth (DMFT) index, oral health 
awareness, and dental treatment-seeking behavior of elderly population.
METHODS: A cross-sectional community-based survey was conducted between 
September 2014 and December 2014 in villages in rural Maharashtra. 
Sociodemographic and health-related information were collected from 352 
participants 60 years of age and above in 10 villages.
RESULTS: Prevalence of dental caries was 76.4% in a study population with median 
DMFT score of 12 with interquartile range of 7-22. The majority of the 
participants cleaned their teeth with fingers using charcoal and mishri. Only 
17.2% participants used toothbrush. About 39% participants had experienced 
dental pain, of which majority did not visit dentist. The median DMFT index who 
used toothbrush and toothpaste was significantly less when compared with 
participants who did not use tooth brush and tooth paste. The majority of the 
participants had one or more missing teeth, but only 2.2% were using dentures.
CONCLUSION: There is an urgent need for comprehensive oral health educational 
programs, and accessible and affordable oral health services to be provided to 
rural community.

OBJECTIVE: Introduction: The right to health is exercised through a complex 
system of state and social measures of legal, economic, social, scientific, 
cultural, educational, organizational, technical, sanitary and hygienic nature, 
aimed at preserving and improving the health of people , lengthening the life 
expectancy and working capacity, creating good living and working conditions, 
providing physical and mental development for children and young people, and 
preventing and managing illnesses and their treatment. The aim: Investigate the 
international legal and constitutional legal regulation of the right to health 
care in the countries of the European Union.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Materials and methods: The article analyzes the 
Constitution of the European Union, a number of international legal acts and 
judgments of the European Court of Human Rights.
RESULTS: Review: Each country defines the conditions for realizing the right to 
health care, according to which people should be healthy, the state itself 
assumes the obligations of the controller and the protection of this right. 
These provisions should primarily be enshrined in the Basic Laws - the 
constitutions. The main direction of state policy in reforming social relations 
is the achievement of European international legal standards in all spheres of 
public life. These standards fix the principles, guarantees of norms that 
determine the scope of human rights, in particular the right to health care.
CONCLUSION: Conclusions: The main problem of ensuring and realizing the right to 
health in the European Union, as in many countries, is the financing of this 
industry, because in general, it is impossible to talk about free medical care 
in the European Union. There are also problems in the field of investment in 
health care. The urgent issues of primary health care and public health and the 
elderly dependence period.

Twin consequences of rising U.S. death rates among young adults: Lower life 
expectancy and greater lifespan variability.

The current study is an original investigation of the U.S. mortality pattern 
from 2000 to 2017. Previous research has shown that the unusual post-2014 
decline in life expectancy is related to the increase in death rates for ages 
25-44, mostly due to rising prevalence in drug poisoning and suicide deaths. Our 
investigation reveals that such increase in younger-age mortality has had an 
impact not only on life expectancy (or mean age at death), but also, and to a 
larger extent, on lifespan variability (the dispersion around the mean age at 
death). Even though lifespan variability is a key component of mortality change, 
as well as a measure of human well-being, with social, economic, and 
psychological implications, it has received much less attention than life 
expectancy has.

PURPOSE: People with epilepsy (PWE) from underserved populations face 
significant barriers to epilepsy management and therefore may lack knowledge 
about epilepsy and self-management (SM) of epilepsy. This paper evaluates SM 
practices, self-efficacy, outcome expectancy, quality of life, and personal 
impact of epilepsy in PWE from underserved populations as compared with all PWE.
METHODS: Recruitment for the Managing Epilepsy Well (MEW) Network PAUSE to Learn 
Your Epilepsy study occurred from October 2015 to March 2019. Participants were 
assessed at baseline; after SM education intervention; and 6-, 9-, and 15-month 
postbaseline assessment. Baseline data from 112 PWE were analyzed for this 
report.
RESULTS: Study population was diverse: 63% were women, 47.3% were non-Hispanic 
black, 24.1% were Hispanic, and 57.4% had public healthcare coverage. 
Participants on average had epilepsy for 14 years, and 49.1% reported at least 
one seizure within the past month, but only 27% reported having used a seizure 
diary or calendar for seizure tracking. Self-management practices & behaviors 
were significantly lower among PWE from underserved populations than all PWE, 
though self-efficacy among PWE from underserved populations was significantly 
higher.
CONCLUSION: This study identifies the unique epilepsy SM needs of PWE from 
underserved populations. We discuss the need for a personalized approach for 
developing SM skills and behaviors among these PWE.

Although many studies have previously examined medicalisation, we add a new 
dimension to the concept as we explore how contemporary oncological medicine 
shapes the dying self as predominantly medical. Through an analysis of multiple 
case studies collected within a comprehensive cancer centre in Ontario, Canada, 
we examine how people with late-stage cancer and their healthcare providers 
enacted the process of medicalisation through engaging in the search for 
oncological treatments, such as experimental drug trials, despite the 
incurability of their disease. The seven cases included 20 interviews with 
patients, family, physicians and nurses, the analysis of 30 documents and 5 hr 
of field observation. A poststructural perspective informed our study. We 
propose that searching for life extension enacts medicalisation by shaping the 
dying person afflicted with terminal cancer into new medical subjectivities that 
are knowledgeable, active, entrepreneurial and curative. Participants initially 
took up medical thinking from the formal oncology system, but then began to 
apply and internalise medical rationalities to alter their personhood, thereby 
generating new curative possibilities for themselves. For people seeking life 
extension, the embodied and day-to-day experiences of suffering and being close 
to death became expressed and moderated in fundamentally medicalised terms.

BACKGROUND: Ethiopia was among the 15 countries that, together accounted for 64% 
of the world's severe episodes of pneumonia among children below the age of 5 in 
2011. To reduce this burden, the 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV 
10) was introduced into the general childhood national immunization program in 
Ethiopia in 2011. However, there is little evidence on its cost-effectiveness, 
and the aim of this study was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of the 
introduction of PCV 10 vaccination in the Ethiopian setting.
METHODS: The cost-effectiveness analysis was carried out based on a 
quasi-experimental evaluation of implementing PCV 10 at the Butajira rural 
health program site in Ethiopia. The intervention and the control groups 
consisted 876 and 1010 children, respectively. Using data from program site's 
surveillance system database as a framework, health outcome and vaccination data 
were collected from medical records, immunization registration books and 
reports. Disability- Adjusted Life Year (DALY) was a main health outcome metric 
complimented by incidence of acute lower respiratory infection/1000-person 
years. Vaccination and treatment costs were collected by document review and 
cross-sectional household survey.
RESULTS: In the intervention cohort, 626 of 876 (71.5%) children received PCV 10 
vaccination. Until the first year of life, the incidence of acute lower 
respiratory infection was higher in the intervention group. After the first year 
of life, the incidence rate was 35.2 per 1000-person years in the intervention 
group compared to 60.4 per 1000-person years in the control group. The 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) per averted DALY for the 
intervention group during the total follow-up period was (2013 US$) 394.3 
(undiscounted) and 413.8 (discounted). The ICER per averted DALY excluding the 
first year of life was (2013 US$) 225 (undiscounted) and 292.7 (discounted).
CONCLUSION: Compared to the WHO's suggested cost-effectiveness threshold value, 
the results indicate that the general childhood PCV 10 vaccination was a 
cost-effective intervention in the Butajira rural health program site.

BACKGROUND: Post-orthodontic white-spot lesions (WSL) in esthetically relevant 
incisor and canine areas impair dentofacial esthetics, and preventive dentistry 
treatment is definitely required in case of enamel cavitations. The incidence of 
lingual post-orthodontic WSL and cavitation following lingual MB treatment has 
been reported to be distinctively decreased compared to labial MB treatment. 
Moreover, lingual WSL do not impair dentofacial esthetics. It was the objective 
of this study to calculate consequential costs of preventive dental care 
necessary to recover labial or lingual post-orthodontic cavitations as well as 
esthetically relevant WSL following either labial or lingual MB interventions.
METHODS: MB treatments (labial / lingual) were simulated in 1,000,000 patients 
between the ages of 12-18Y, with a median residual life time expectancy of 58Y 
based on local mortality tables. Range of MB Tx duration was 9-45 mo. 
Frequencies of post-orthodontic (labial / lingual) enamel damages were derived 
from large-scale WSL incidence studies. Anterior composite survival rates were 
based on a systematic review on the subject. Within the context of the German 
dental fee system (GOZ 2.3 and 3.5 fee increments), simulation of costs for 
enamel damage treatment and re-treatment (maximum: 5x) were based on 
single-surface composite restorations for lingual or labial cavitations and 
labial WSL treatment; and lingual WSL fluoridation.
RESULTS: Overall mean total costs for Tx and re-Tx of both WSLs and cavitations 
may sum up to 1718.91 Eur in the high-cost (GOZ 3.5) scenario for conventional 
MB cases, versus 19.94 Eur for lingually treated cases, given that renewal of 
simulated single-surface restorations takes place at 15-year intervals. When 
focussing on patients diagnosed with least of one WSL, and/or cavitation, these 
mean costs increase up to 2332.35 Eur for conventionally treated MB patients, or 
65.03 Eur for lingual MB patients.
CONCLUSION: Costs for repeated treatment of post-orthodontic enamel damages 
produced by conventional vestibular fixed appliances may easily exceed the 
initially higher costs associated with lingual orthodontic treatment. Judged 
economically in the long term, lingual MB Tx may be considered as a more 
cost-effective solution for a correction of malocclusion.

Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is a photosynthetic unicellular model algae with 
multiple biotechnological advantages, and its fatty acids can be used to produce 
biofuels. Numerous studies suggest that acetyl-coA carboxylase (ACCa) catalyzes 
the first committed and rate-limiting step of fatty acid biosynthesis, thereby 
playing a central role in oil accumulation. Here, we cloned and overexpressed 
ACCa in C. reinhardtii to directly evaluate its effect on fatty acid synthesis. 
GC-MS analysis found that the unsaturated FAs contents of the CW15-24 and 
CW15-85 strains were 55.45% and 56.15%, which were significantly enriched 
compared to the wild type CW15 (48.39%). Under the optimized conditions, the 
content of lipid by overexpressed the ACCa gene in the mutant CW15-85 (0.46 g/l) 
was 1.16-fold greater than control through optimization of N and P sources. 
Altogether, our data clearly demonstrate that ACCa overexpression in C. 
reinhardtii can directly increase the synthesis of fatty acids.

Internet-Based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Among Psychologists in a Medical 
Setting: A Survey on Implementation.

Behavioural Sciences, Leiden University, Leiden, Netherlands.

BACKGROUND: Internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) is an effective 
treatment for patients with a chronic somatic illness to improve self-management 
skills and to learn to adjust to their chronic disease and its impact on daily 
life. However, the implementation of iCBT in clinical practice is challenging.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine the current degree of implementation of 
iCBT among psychologists in a medical setting and discover determinants 
influencing the implementation of iCBT among nonusers.
METHODS: A Web-based survey, based on the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use 
of Technology (UTAUT), was distributed among psychologists in a medical setting. 
The survey included questions regarding the current use of iCBT, intention to 
use iCBT in the future, and operationalized concepts of the UTAUT constructs, 
that is, performance expectancy (PE), effort expectancy (EE), social influence 
(SI), and facilitating conditions (FC).
RESULTS: In total, 107 (24.8%) psychologists completed the survey. Of them, 
16.8% have access to iCBT, 15.9% currently use iCBT, and 21.5% are expected to 
use iCBT within the next year. The constructs PE, EE, and SI together 
significantly influenced behavioral intention (BI; mean 3.9 [SD=0.8]) among 
nonusers (R2=0.490; F4.85=20.405; P<.001).
CONCLUSIONS: In spite of an average to high BI, the current implementation of 
iCBT is rather low among psychologists in a medical setting. Further research 
should focus on reducing the gap between intention to use and actual use by 
focusing on influencing the predictive UTAUT constructs.

BACKGROUND: While riluzole has been investigated for the treatment of 
depression, little is known about its longer-term efficacy and optimal treatment 
duration in treatment-resistant depression (TRD). The objective of this study is 
to characterize the longer-term outcome of adjunctive riluzole therapy for TRD 
in an open-label extension of an 8-week acute treatment trial.
METHODS: The data from 66 patients with TRD who received adjunctive riluzole in 
a 12-week open-label extension phase were analyzed. Response rates (⩾50% 
reduction in the Mongomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale [MADRS] score), 
relapse rates (a MADRS score of ⩾22 in patients who had previously achieved 
response), and adverse events were examined in patients who had achieved 
response at the end of the acute phase and those who had not.
RESULTS: Among acute phase responders, the maintained response rate was 66.7% 
(8/12) and the relapse rate was 8.3% (1/12). In acute phase non-responders, the 
response rate was 24.1% (13/54). The most commonly reported adverse event was 
fatigue (9.1%). Three cases were considered serious adverse events; vomiting 
(n = 1), shortness of breath (n = 1), and aborted suicide attempt (n = 1).
LIMITATIONS: This longer-term study was open-label and uncontrolled. The sample 
size was relatively small.
CONCLUSIONS: Longer-term adjunctive riluzole appears relatively well tolerated 
and beneficial for maintaining previous response. Additionally, approximately 
one fourth of patients who did not respond to 8-week antidepressant treatment 
might respond if treated with riluzole for 12 weeks. Those findings warrant 
further investigation because adjunctive riluzole could represent an option for 
treatment of depression when standard antidepressants have failed.
