education on health and mortality using a structural equation model suggested by 
Conti et al. (2010). We extend their model by allowing for a duration dependent 
variable (mortality), and an ordinal educational variable. Data come from a 
Dutch cohort born between 1937 and 1941, including detailed measures of 
cognitive ability and family background in the final grade of primary school. 
The data are linked to the mortality register 1995-2011, such that we observe 
mortality between ages 55 and 75. The results suggest that at least half of the 
unconditional survival differences between educational groups are due to a 
'selection effect', primarily on the basis of cognitive ability. Conditional 
survival differences across those having finished just primary school and those 
entering secondary education are still substantial, and amount to a 4 years gain 
in life expectancy, on average.

BACKGROUND: The life expectancy of non-severe hemophilia A (HA) patients equals 
the life expectancy of the non-hemophilic population. However, data on the 
effect of inhibitor development on mortality and on hemophilia-related causes of 
death are scarce. The development of neutralizing factor VIII antibodies in 
non-severe HA patients may dramatically change their clinical outcome due to 
severe bleeding complications.
OBJECTIVES: We assessed the association between the occurrence of inhibitors and 
mortality in patients with non-severe HA.
METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, clinical data and vital status were 
collected for 2709 non-severe HA patients (107 with inhibitors) who were treated 
between 1980 and 2011 in 34 European and Australian centers. Mortality rates for 
patients with and without inhibitors were compared.
RESULTS: During 64,200 patient-years of follow-up, 148 patients died (mortality 
rate, 2.30 per 1000 person-years; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.96-2.70) at a 
median age of 64 years (interquartile range [IQR], 49-76). In 62 patients (42%) 
the cause of death was hemophilia related. Sixteen inhibitor patients died at a 
median age of 71 years (IQR, 60-81). In ten patients the inhibitor was present 
at time of death; seven of them died of severe bleeding complications. The 
all-cause mortality rate in inhibitor patients was > 5 times increased compared 
with that for those without inhibitors (age-adjusted mortality rate ratio, 5.6).
CONCLUSION: Inhibitor development in non-severe hemophilia is associated with 
increased mortality. High rates of hemophilia-related mortality in this study 
indicate that non-severe hemophilia is not mild at all and stress the importance 
of close follow-up for these patients.

Revisiting weight reduction and management in the diabetic patient: Novel 
therapies provide new strategies.

Schwartz S(1), Herman M.

Author information:
(1)Main Line Health System, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia,, PA , USA.

Weight gain has been so synonymous with diabetes care that overweight/obesity is 
considered an intractable aspect of diabetes and its management. A healthy body 
mass index (BMI) is paramount, however, in preserving the cardiometabolic 
profile, slowing the course of the disease and extending the life expectancy of 
patients. It is also key to fostering a healthy and productive society at large. 
Two trends in care press us to challenge our assumptions about weight control in 
this population by reconsidering traditional approaches to the management of 
diabetes. First, new anti-diabetes drug classes have emerged that are more 
"weight-friendly" than previously available treatments and "gentler" on the 
faltering β cell. Second, novel anti-obesity agents are proving efficacious in 
patients with diabetes. This paper presents the composite of newer and older 
anti-obesity and anti-diabetic drugs. It makes recommendations for anti-diabetic 
regimens and processes of care that engender weight loss, or neutralize or 
minimize weight gain, while getting many patients to their glycated hemoglobin 
(HbA1c) goal. Anti-obesity agents that can be safely and effectively 
incorporated into these regimens for the patient needing supplemental support 
are reviewed in detail.

BACKGROUND: The use of narrow-diameter implants (NDIs; <3.75 mm) constitutes an 
alternative to bone augmentation procedure. Long-term evaluation of NDIs with a 
diameter <3.0 mm is still lacking.
PURPOSE: Analyze the long-term outcomes of 2.5-mm NDIs splinted to regular-sized 
implants for supporting partial and complete fixed prostheses.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients charts were retrospectively analyzed to select 
patients treated by the insertion of at least one 2.5-mm two-piece implant 
before July 2005. The study was based on the available charts (no patient was 
recalled). Patient's demographic data were described. The known implant length 
was used as a reference to calibrate the linear measurements of marginal bone 
loss on digital periapical radiograph. Implant details, survival and prosthetic 
complications were analyzed.
RESULTS: Thirty-seven 2.5-mm implants placed in 20 patients (mean age at 
surgery: 54.05 ± 9.7 years) in maxilla and mandible were included and evaluated. 
The implants' mean follow-up time since insertion was 6.5 ± 3.2 years (range 0 
to 9.7 years). The follow-up time was more than 7 years for 22 implants. One 
implant failed due to lack of osseointegration. Two prosthetic complications 
(connector and porcelain fracture) occurred. The survival rate was 97.3% for 
implants and 92.0% for prostheses. The mean marginal bone loss at the mesial and 
distal aspect was 0.70 ± 0.55 and 0.72 ± 0.56 mm, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: When dental implants of 2.5 mm in diameter are splinted by a fixed 
prosthesis, long-term favorable outcomes could be obtained.

INTRODUCTION: In patients with myasthenia gravis (MG), muscle strength is 
expected to decrease gradually during the day due to physical activities.
METHODS: Isometric muscle strength at the shoulder, knee, and ankle was 
determined in 10 MG patients (MGFA class II-IV) who were receiving usual medical 
treatment and in 10 control subjects. To determine diurnal and day-to-day 
variation, muscle strength was measured 4 times during day 1 and once at day 2.
RESULTS: Knee extension strength decreased during the day in both patients and 
controls. Neither diurnal nor day-to-day variation of muscle strength was higher 
in patients compared with controls.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with mild to moderate MG did not have increased variation 
of isometric muscle strength during the day or from day-to-day compared with 
controls. This suggests that isometric muscle performance can be determined with 
high reproducibility in similar groups of MG patients without regard to time of 
day.

We comparatively examined the trunk musculature and prezygapophyseal angle of 
mid-trunk vertebra in eight urodele species with different locomotive modes 
(aquatic Siren intermedia, Amphiuma tridactylum, Necturus maculosus and Andrias 
japonicus; semi-aquatic Cynops pyrrhogaster, Cynops ensicauda; and terrestrial 
Hynobius nigrescens, Hynobius lichenatus and Ambystoma tigrinum). We found that 
the more terrestrial species were characterized by larger dorsal and abdominal 
muscle weight ratios compared with those of the more aquatic species, whereas 
muscle ratios of the lateral hypaxial musculature were larger in the more 
aquatic species. The lateral hypaxial muscles were thicker in the more aquatic 
species, whereas the M. rectus abdominis was more differentiated in the more 
terrestrial species. Our results suggest that larger lateral hypaxial muscles 
function for lateral bending during underwater locomotion in aquatic species. 
Larger dorsalis and abdominal muscles facilitate resistance against sagittal 
extension of the trunk, stabilization and support of the ventral contour line 
against gravity in terrestrial species. The more aquatic species possessed a 
more horizontal prezygapophyseal angle for more flexible lateral locomotion. In 
contrast, the more terrestrial species have an increasingly vertical 
prezygapophyseal angle to provide stronger column support against gravity. Thus, 
we conclude trunk structure in urodeles differs clearly according to their 
locomotive modes.

Role of Hox genes in stem cell differentiation.

Hox genes are an evolutionary highly conserved gene family. They determine the 
anterior-posterior body axis in bilateral organisms and influence the 
developmental fate of cells. Embryonic stem cells are usually devoid of any Hox 
gene expression, but these transcription factors are activated in varying 
spatial and temporal patterns defining the development of various body regions. 
In the adult body, Hox genes are among others responsible for driving the 
differentiation of tissue stem cells towards their respective lineages in order 
to repair and maintain the correct function of tissues and organs. Due to their 
involvement in the embryonic and adult body, they have been suggested to be 
useable for improving stem cell differentiations in vitro and in vivo. In many 
studies Hox genes have been found as driving factors in stem cell 
differentiation towards adipogenesis, in lineages involved in bone and joint 
formation, mainly chondrogenesis and osteogenesis, in cardiovascular lineages 
including endothelial and smooth muscle cell differentiations, and in 
neurogenesis. As life expectancy is rising, the demand for tissue reconstruction 
continues to increase. Stem cells have become an increasingly popular choice for 
creating therapies in regenerative medicine due to their self-renewal and 
differentiation potential. Especially mesenchymal stem cells are used more and 
more frequently due to their easy handling and accessibility, combined with a 
low tumorgenicity and little ethical concerns. This review therefore intends to 
summarize to date known correlations between natural Hox gene expression 
patterns in body tissues and during the differentiation of various stem cells 
towards their respective lineages with a major focus on mesenchymal stem cell 
differentiations. This overview shall help to understand the complex 
interactions of Hox genes and differentiation processes all over the body as 
well as in vitro for further improvement of stem cell treatments in future 
regenerative medicine approaches.

The development of simple, accurate, rapid and cost-effective technologies for 
mutation detection is crucial to the early diagnosis and prevention of numerous 
genetic diseases, pharmacogenetics, and drug resistance. Proofreading PCR 
(PR-PCR) was developed for mutation detection in 1998 but is rarely applied due 
to its low efficiency in allele discrimination. Here we developed a modified 
PR-PCR method using a ddNTP-blocked primer and a mixture of DNA polymerases with 
and without the 3'-5' proofreading function. The ddNTP-blocked primer exhibited 
the best blocking efficiency to avoid nonspecific primer extension while the 
mixture of a tiny amount of high-fidelity DNA polymerase with a routine amount 
of Taq DNA polymerase provided the best discrimination and amplification 
effects. The modified PR-PCR method is quite capable of detecting various 
mutation types, including point mutations and insertions/deletions (indels), and 
allows discrimination amplification when the mismatch is located within the last 
eight nucleotides from the 3'-end of the ddNTP-blocked primer. The modified 
PR-PCR has a sensitivity of 1-5 × 102 copies and a selectivity of 5 × 10-5 
mutant among 107 copies of wild-type DNA. It showed a 100% accuracy rate in the 
detection of P72R germ-line mutation in the TP53 gene among 60 clinical blood 
samples, and a high potential to detect rifampin-resistant mutations at low 
frequency in Mycobacterium tuberculosis using an adaptor and a fusion-blocked 
primer. These results suggest that the modified PR-PCR technique is effective in 
detection of various mutations or polymorphisms as a simple, sensitive and 
promising approach.

Body height of mummified pharaohs supports historical suggestions of sibling 
marriages.

Body height is an important factor in reconstructing health conditions and it 
serves as an indicator of socio-economic status. Researchers rely on ancient 
data to analyze evolutionary aspects of human health and its interrelation with 
environmental influences. This study presents body height estimates from all 
periods of ancient Egyptian history and compares the general population with the 
existing mummies of the members of royal families. A sample of 259 adult 
Egyptian mummies originating from various collections and published sources with 
body lengths (long bone measures or/and overall measurements, CT data) were 
analyzed, and royal mummies were scored with respect to the level of 
consanguinity. Male royals were taller than males in the general ancient 
Egyptian population, while female royals were shorter than females in the 
general population. The body height variation of the royals is significantly 
reduced when compared with a pool of non-royal mummies. This provides evidence 
for inbreeding resulting from consanguineous marriages. However, there appears 
to be no correlation between the level of inbreeding and individual body height. 
The random sample of general population does not show signs of inbreeding. Due 
to the present lack of larger, technically and ethically challenging genetic 
studies, the selected non-invasive approach of body height is the most reliable 
indicator of sibling marriages of pharaohs based on direct physical evidence.

Modelling the Age Dynamics of Chronic Health Conditions: Life-Table-Consistent 
Transition Probabilities and their Application.

Denton FT(1), Spencer BG(1).

Author information:
(1)Department of Economics,McMaster University.

Surveys of chronic health conditions provide information about prevalence but 
not incidence and the process of change within the population. Our study shows 
how "age dynamics" of chronic conditions – the probabilities of contracting 
conditions at different ages, of moving from one chronic condition state to 
another, and of dying – can be inferred from prevalence data for those 
conditions that can be viewed as irreversible. Transition probability matrices 
are constructed for successive age groups, with the sequence representing the 
age dynamics of the health conditions for a stationary population. We simulate 
the life path of a cohort under the initial probabilities, and again under 
altered probabilities, to explore the effects of reducing the incidence or 
mortality rate associated with a particular condition. We show that such surveys 
of chronic conditions can be made even more valuable by allowing the calculation 
of the transition probabilities that define the chronic conditions aging 
process.

Although Spain is the European country with the highest Chagas disease burden, 
the country does not have a national control program of the disease. The purpose 
of this study is to evaluate the efficiency of several strategies for Chagas 
disease screening among Latin American residents living in Spain. The following 
screening strategies were evaluated: (1) non-screening; (2) screening of the 
Latin American pregnant women and their newborns; (3) screening also the 
relatives of the positive pregnant women; (4) screening also the relatives of 
the negative pregnant women. A cost-utility analysis was carried out to compare 
the four strategies from two perspectives, the societal and the Spanish National 
Health System (SNHS). A decision tree representing the clinical evolution of 
Chagas disease throughout patient's life was built. The strategies were compared 
through the incremental cost-utility ratio, using euros as cost measurement and 
quality-adjusted life years as utility measurement. A sensitivity analysis was 
performed to test the model parameters and their influence on the results. We 
found the "Non-screening" as the most expensive and less effective of the 
evaluated strategies, from both the societal and the SNHS perspectives. Among 
the screening evaluated strategies the most efficient was, from both 
perspectives, to extent the antenatal screening of the Latin American pregnant 
women and their newborns up to the relatives of the positive women. Several 
parameters influenced significantly on the sensitivity analyses, particularly 
the chronic treatment efficacy or the prevalence of Chagas disease. In 
conclusion, for the general Latin American immigrants living in Spain the most 
efficient would be to screen the Latin American mothers, their newborns and the 
close relatives of the mothers with a positive serology. However for higher 
prevalence immigrant population the most efficient intervention would be to 
extend the program to the close relatives of the negative mothers.

PURPOSE: In patients with a high life expectancy at the time of surgery for 
colorectal cancer (CRC), the long-term outcome may be influenced by factors 
other than their cancer. We aimed to investigate the long-term outcome and cause 
of death beyond a 5-year surveillance programme.
METHODS: We evaluated the overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival 
(CSS) of a population-based cohort of stage I-III CRC patients <75 years old who 
completed a systematic surveillance programme.
RESULTS: In total, 161 patients <75 years old, 111 (69 %) of whom were node 
negative (pN0), were included. The median follow-up time was 12.1 years. The OS 
was 54 % at 15 years and differed significantly between the pN0 and pN+ patients 
(65 vs. 30 %; P < 0.001); CSS (72 %) also differed between the pN0 and pN+ 
patients (85 vs. 44 %; P < 0.001). For the 5-year survivors (n = 119), 14 (12 %) 
died of CRC during additional long-term follow-up (7 each for pN0 and pN+), and 
6 patients (5 %; all pN0) died of other cancers. Patients aged <65 years 
exhibited better long-term survival (81 %), but most of the deaths were due to 
CRC (10/12 deaths). Only two of the 14 cancer-related deaths involved 
microsatellite instable (MSI) CRC. Females exhibited better OS and CSS beyond 5 
years of surveillance.
CONCLUSIONS: The long-term survival beyond 5-year survivorship for stage I-III 
CRC is very good. Nonetheless, cancer-related deaths are encountered in 
one-third of patients and occur most frequently in patients who are <65 years 
old at disease onset-pointing to a still persistent risk several years after 
surgery.

The high price of obesity in nursing homes.

Marihart CL, Brunt AR, Geraci AA.

This article provides a commentary on the costs of obese nursing home patients. 
We conducted a comprehensive literature search, which found 46 relevant articles 
on obesity in older adults and effects on nursing home facilities. This review 
indicated obesity is increasing globally for all age groups and older adults are 
facing increased challenges with chronic diseases associated with obesity more 
than ever before. With medical advances comes greater life expectancy, but obese 
adults often experience more disabilities, which require nursing home care. In 
the United States, the prevalence of obesity in adults aged 60 years and older 
increased from 9.9 million (23.6%) to 22.2 million (37.0%) in 2010. Obese older 
adults are twice as likely to be admitted to a nursing home. Many obese adults 
have comorbidities such as Type 2 diabetes; patients with diabetes incurred 1 in 
every 4 nursing home days. Besides the costs of early entrance into nursing 
facilities, caring for obese residents is different than caring for nonobese 
residents. Obese residents have more care needs for additional equipment, 
supplies, and staff costs. Unlike emergency rooms and hospitals, nursing homes 
do not have federal requirements that require them to serve all patients. 
Currently, some nursing homes are not prepared to deal with very obese patients. 
This is a public health concern because there are more obese people than ever in 
history before and the future appears to have even a heavier generation moving 
forward. Policymakers need to become aware of this serious gap in nursing home 
care.

While Amazonian forests are extraordinarily diverse, the abundance of trees is 
skewed strongly towards relatively few 'hyperdominant' species. In addition to 
their diversity, Amazonian trees are a key component of the global carbon cycle, 
assimilating and storing more carbon than any other ecosystem on Earth. Here we 
ask, using a unique data set of 530 forest plots, if the functions of storing 
and producing woody carbon are concentrated in a small number of tree species, 
whether the most abundant species also dominate carbon cycling, and whether 
dominant species are characterized by specific functional traits. We find that 
dominance of forest function is even more concentrated in a few species than is 
dominance of tree abundance, with only ≈1% of Amazon tree species responsible 
for 50% of carbon storage and productivity. Although those species that 
contribute most to biomass and productivity are often abundant, species maximum 
size is also influential, while the identity and ranking of dominant species 
varies by function and by region.

Patients with metastatic bone cancer report life-altering pain. Nerve growth 
factor is involved in pain signaling. Tanezumab, a nerve growth factor 
monoclonal antibody, has demonstrated efficacy in chronic pain. 
Placebo-controlled parent (NCT00545129; study 1003) and noncontrolled open-label 
extension (NCT00830180; study 1029) studies evaluated efficacy and safety of 
tanezumab in patients with painful bone metastases taking daily opioids. 
Patients in study 1003 received a single intravenous injection of 10 mg 
tanezumab or placebo and were followed up to 16 weeks. Efficacy analyses 
included change from baseline in daily average and worst pain at week 6 on an 
11-point numeric rating scale. At week 8, patients could enroll in study 1029 
and receive 4 infusions of 10 mg tanezumab at 8-week intervals with follow-up to 
40 weeks. Safety assessments included adverse events and physical and neurologic 
examinations. Overall, 59 patients were randomized and treated (placebo, n = 30; 
tanezumab, n = 29). At the primary endpoint of study 1003, least squares mean 
(SE) difference in change from baseline in daily average pain vs placebo was 
-0.26 (0.45; P = 0.569). Post hoc analyses suggested that tanezumab had greater 
efficacy in patients with lower baseline opioid use and/or higher baseline pain. 
Mean (SE) pain scores in study 1029 were reduced through week 40 compared with 
study 1029 or 1003 baselines (-0.21 [0.76] and -1.27 [0.68], respectively). 
Adverse event incidence of study 1003 was similar between groups. Although the 
primary endpoint was not achieved, tanezumab may provide additional sustained 
analgesia in patients with metastatic bone pain taking daily opioids. Additional 
larger studies are warranted.

BACKGROUND: In Japan, the number of dementia patients admitted to hospitals and 
other care facilities has been increasing and their hospital stays prolonged. 
Until now, there has been no study examining the differences between patients in 
psychiatric hospitals and other care facilities. Here we attempt a comparative 
analysis of characteristics of dementia patients in psychiatric hospitals and 
other types of facilities based on a nationwide survey.
METHOD: A nationwide, cross-sectional survey was conducted in 2009-2011. 
Questionnaires were sent to randomly selected facilities and asked about each 
facility's status as of September 2009 and about individuals with dementia 
residing in each facility during the 2008 fiscal year. The portion about 
individuals consisted of items to assess eligibility for the Long-Term Care 
Insurance programme. Based on data from 6121 patients residing in seven 
different types of facilities, features of dementia patients in psychiatric 
hospitals and differences among facilities were analyzed.
RESULTS: There was a significant difference in average age, activities of daily 
living level, and dementia severity level among the seven types of facilities. 
The average age in all types of facilities, except for psychiatric hospitals, 
was higher than the national average life expectancy of 82.59 years. The results 
of the study revealed that in psychiatric hospitals the proportion of men, those 
aged <75 years, demented patients with severe behavioural and psychological 
symptoms of dementia, and those with frontotemporal dementia was significantly 
greater than in other types of facilities. In other Long-Term Care Insurance 
care facilities, dementia patients >80 years and women accounted for 80% of all 
patients.
CONCLUSION: Result showed that dementia patients in psychiatric hospitals had a 
higher proportion of men, younger age groups, and severe dementia than other 
types of facilities. These features contrast markedly with status of dementia 
patients in other Long-Term Care Insurance care facilities. In order to 
facilitate dementia patients' early discharge from psychiatric hospitals to 
other care facilities or to home, further fulfillment care services 
corresponding to severe dementia and early-onset dementia may be needed.

Geriatrics and palliative care often overlap. This article focuses on 2 areas 
where the disciplines may differ in their approach. The first is planning for 
extreme illness and death, with explicit acknowledgment that limiting therapy 
might be a good idea. This situation is likely to have a different impact in the 
course of a routine geriatrics visit than in a palliative care context. The 
second is pain management, especially chronic pain. In patients with sharply 
limited life expectancy, the risk/benefit equation tilts easily toward narcotic 
use. In frail elders working to remain independent, the calculus may be quite 
different.

Palliative care is a public health concern, because the problems faced by 
patients and their families represent a substantial burden of illness and cost 
to the society that is likely to increase markedly in the future as the world's 
population continues to age. There are also inequities in access to palliative 
care and continued unmet need. There is evidence to support palliative care 
services, but not yet enough information on the cost-effectiveness of many 
specific treatments/interventions.

Manual therapy (MT) and exercise therapy techniques are commonly utilised, 
guideline recommended treatment strategies in the management of non-specific low 
back pain (LBP). Preliminary evidence on asymptomatic participants indicates 
that two manual therapy techniques; repeated lumbar extension in lying exercise 
(EIL); and segmental rotational grade V manipulation (manipulation), have 
significant effects on the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) as detectable with 
skin conductance (SC) responses. However, it is not known if these responses 
occur in patients with LBP. A randomised, independent group's design was 
utilised to investigate the immediate SC responses in 50 patients with LBP of 
less than 12 weeks duration. Patients received either the manipulation technique 
(n = 25) or the EIL exercise (n = 25) and SC activity was recorded, in a single 
treatment session, pre-, peri- and post-treatment. Both treatments resulted in a 
sympatho-excitatory response during the intervention period with the 
manipulation technique having a 255% increase (p < 0.005), and the EIL technique 
a 94% increase (p = 0.019) with both treatments having responses that were 
sustained into the final rest period (p < 0.005). Between-group comparisons 
indicate that the manipulation technique had a significantly greater magnitude 
of effect (p < 0.001). The results support the sympatho-excitatory responses 
seen in normative studies but challenge the assumption that normative and 
patient populations are analogous with respect to the magnitude of effect 
observed and suggest that SC responses may be a feasible, proxy method of 
detecting dorsal horn sensitisation and neuro-plastic adaptations occurring in 
the presence of LBP.

BACKGROUND: Skin biopsy is the method to assist clinicians to make definite 
dermatological diagnosis which further helps in holistic management. Skin 
cancers are relatively rare clinical diagnosis in developing countries like 
Nepal, but the prevalence is on rise.
OBJECTIVES: To investigate the profile of skin biopsies and frequencies and 
pattern of skin cancers in a tertiary care centre of Western Nepal.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The materials consisted of 434 biopsies (1.37%) out of 
31,450 OPD visits performed in the Department of Dermatology, Manipal Teaching 
Hospital, Pokhara, Nepal, during the period of Dec 2011-Nov 2014. Data were 
collected and analyzed using SPSS-16 with reference to incidence, age, sex, race 
and clinical and histopathological features.
RESULTS: The commonest disorders observed in biopsies were papulosquamous 
lesions, skin tuberculosis of different types, benign skin tumors, leprosy, 
collagen and fungal diseases. Viral diseases were rarely seen, probably due to 
straight forward clinical diagnosis. Dermatological malignancies accounted for 
55/434 (12.67%) of biopsies. Skin disorders in general were commoner in females 
280/434 (64%), including malignancies 32/55(58.2%). Mean age of patients with 
skin cancer was 54.5 years. Facilities for proper laboratory investigation of 
dermatological disorders will improve the quality of life.
CONCLUSIONS: The most prevalent lesion in skin biopsies was papulosquamous 
disorders followed by skin tuberculosis of different types. Dermatological 
malignancy constituted 55/434 (12.67%) cases. The prevalence of skin malignancy 
is on rise in Nepalese society probably due to increase in life expectancy and 
better diagnostic services.
