Life expectancy and chronic disease rates both rose dramatically in the United 
States during the first third of the twentieth century. As a result of this 
concurrence, Americans in this era increasingly thought about things they could 
do to extend their own lives, especially eating less, exercising more, and 
limiting stress, all factors thought to reduce chronic disease. New recognition 
of the correlation between daily physical habits and long lives made longevity 
look like a sign of virtue. At the same time, amidst discussions about the 
relationship between individual longevity and national vitality, this 
correlation also contributed to Americans' moralization of diet, exercise, and 
emotional self-control.

BACKGROUND: Back pain remains a challenge for primary care internationally. One 
model that has not been tested is stratification of the management according to 
the patient's prognosis (low, medium, or high risk). We compared the clinical 
effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of stratified primary care (intervention) 
with non-stratified current best practice (control).
METHODS: 1573 adults (aged ≥18 years) with back pain (with or without 
radiculopathy) consultations at ten general practices in England responded to 
invitations to attend an assessment clinic. Eligible participants were randomly 
assigned by use of computer-generated stratified blocks with a 2:1 ratio to 
intervention or control group. Primary outcome was the effect of treatment on 
the Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ) score at 12 months. In the 
economic evaluation, we focused on estimating incremental quality-adjusted life 
years (QALYs) and health-care costs related to back pain. Analysis was by 
intention to treat. This study is registered, number ISRCTN37113406.
FINDINGS: 851 patients were assigned to the intervention (n=568) and control 
groups (n=283). Overall, adjusted mean changes in RMDQ scores were significantly 
higher in the intervention group than in the control group at 4 months (4·7 [SD 
5·9] vs 3·0 [5·9], between-group difference 1·81 [95% CI 1·06-2·57]) and at 12 
months (4·3 [6·4] vs 3·3 [6·2], 1·06 [0·25-1·86]), equating to effect sizes of 
0·32 (0·19-0·45) and 0·19 (0·04-0·33), respectively. At 12 months, stratified 
care was associated with a mean increase in generic health benefit (0·039 
additional QALYs) and cost savings (£240·01 vs £274·40) compared with the 
control group.
INTERPRETATION: The results show that a stratified approach, by use of 
prognostic screening with matched pathways, will have important implications for 
the future management of back pain in primary care.

[The evolution of kidney transplantation over the last 20 years].

Kidney transplantation is an efficient treatment of end stage renal disease, 
decreasing patient mortality by comparison with mortality in dialysis and 
improving patient quality of life. The number of patients living in France with 
a functioning transplant is almost as high as the number of patients on dialysis 
(33,000 versus 37,500 in 2009). The constant progress in immunosuppressive 
treatments has made graft survival improve. According to the "Agence de 
biomédecine", the national institution in charge of transplantation regulation 
and management, overall graft survival is 68% at 10 years but 80% for living 
donor transplantation. Transplantation indications have been extended with time 
to more difficult patients: retransplanted patients and elderly patients, to the 
point that age per se is no more a contraindication to transplantation. Increase 
in transplant activity has followed increase in kidney harvesting in marginal 
donors, called "extended criteria donors": older, hypertensive, having 
atherosclerotic pathologies. Kidney from these donors are attributed to 
recipients of similar age. With organ shortage, new sources of donors are 
proposed, non heart beating donors and living donors. Living donor 
transplantation is the best transplantation with the best results but it is 
insufficiently developed in France (8-10% of the total annual number of renal 
transplantations versus 30-50% in the Scandinavian and Anglo-Saxon countries). 
Extension of the definition of the living donor through the successive revisions 
of the Law of Bioethics should hopefully improved this situation.

PrcR, a PucR-type transcriptional activator, is essential for proline 
utilization and mediates proline-responsive expression of the proline 
utilization operon putBCP in Bacillus subtilis.

The soil bacterium Bacillus subtilis can utilize exogenous proline as a sole 
nitrogen or carbon source. The proline-inducible putBCP (formerly ycgMNO) operon 
encodes proteins responsible for proline uptake and two-step oxidation of 
proline to glutamate. We now report that a gene (formerly ycgP, now designated 
prcR) located downstream of the putBCP operon is essential for B. subtilis cells 
to utilize proline as a sole nitrogen or carbon source. Disruption of the prcR 
gene also abolished proline induction of putB transcription. prcR expression is 
not subject to autoregulation and proline induction. The PrcR protein shows no 
significant amino acid sequence similarity to the known transcriptional 
activators for proline utilization genes of other bacteria, but it does show 
partial amino acid sequence similarity to the transcriptional regulator PucR for 
the purine degradation genes of B. subtilis. PrcR orthologues of unknown 
function are present in some other Bacillus species. Primer-extension analysis 
suggests that both putB and prcR are transcribed by a σ(A)-dependent promoter. 
Deletion and mutation analysis revealed that an inverted repeat 
(5'-TTGTGG-N5-CCACAA-3') centred at position -76 relative to the transcriptional 
initiation site of putB is essential for putB expression. Electrophoretic 
mobility shift assays showed that the purified His-tagged PrcR was capable of 
binding specifically to this inverted repeat. Altogether, these results suggest 
that PrcR is a PucR-type transcriptional activator that mediates expression of 
the B. subtilis putBCP operon in response to proline availability.

Due to the recent widespread availability of highly active antiretroviral 
therapy (HAART) in middle-income countries, there has been an increase in life 
expectancy for women on HAART, but no corresponding decrease in cervical cancer 
incidence. This study evaluates the optimal cervical cancer screening strategy 
for HIV-infected women in a middle-income country. We developed a mathematical 
model, which simulates the natural history of the HPV infection, as well as the 
HIV-mediated immunosupression among women in Brazil. Our model was calibrated 
using data from the IPEC/FIOCRUZ Women's HIV-infected cohort. The model compares 
the lifetime effects, costs and cost-effectiveness of strategies combining 
cytology, HPV DNA test and colposcopy at different screening intervals for 
different CD4 count strata (27 strategies in total). We found that the strategy 
with the best cost-effectiveness profile (cost-effectiveness ratio-U$4,911/year 
of life saved [YLS] and probability of being cost-effective-86%) was HPV testing 
followed by cytology triage every year for all HIV infected women, considering a 
very cost-effective threshold given by Brazil's GDP per capita (US$8,625/YLS). 
The results were robust to changes in the input parameters as demonstrated in 
one-way, scenario, threshold and probabilistic sensitivity analysis. Our study 
indicates that annual HPV testing followed by cytology triage for all 
HIV-infected women is likely to be very cost-effective in a middle-income 
country like Brazil. The results reflect the synergic effect of using a highly 
sensitive screening test (HPV DNA test) in sequence with a highly specific test 
(cytology).

Essential thrombocythaemia (ET) is a myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized 
by elevated platelet counts and increased incidence of thrombosis and 
haemorrhage. Median age at diagnosis is 65-70 years. Life expectancy is similar 
to that of the healthy population. Symptoms and complications may affect quality 
of life (QoL); in particular, in elderly patients ET may represent an additional 
burden. We performed a survey in 494 elderly ET patients to evaluate 
patient-reported outcomes (PROs). Comorbidities were present in 305 (62%) 
patients. Factorial analysis based on survey items representing psychological 
aspects of daily life identified an "attitude domain" with four clusters of 
patients: (A) very pessimistic (n = 99), (B) pessimistic (n = 101), (C) 
optimistic (n = 90), and (D) very optimistic (n = 107). Patients in cluster A 
had more comorbidities (p = 0.003) while patients in cluster D required fewer 
medical visits and were less disturbed by medications (p < 0.0001). Independent 
factors predicting Short-Form Health Survey, version 2 physical QoL were grade 
of optimism (p < 0.0001), gender (p = 0.007), and Charlson comorbidity index (p 
< 0.0001)). Grade of optimism and disturbances related to medication predicted 
mental QOL (p < 0.0001). In conclusion, physicians should take into 
consideration PROs, as "attitude" is associated with physical and mental QoL. 
Treatment should be tailored to patients' needs according to comorbidities, 
lifestyle, and psychological conditions.

BACKGROUND: We describe changes in prostate cancer incidence, survival and 
mortality and the resulting impact in additional diagnoses and avoided deaths in 
European areas and the United States.
METHODS: Using data from 12 European cancer registries and the Surveillance, 
Epidemiology and End Results program, we describe changes in prostate cancer 
epidemiology between the beginning of the PSA era (USA: 1985-1989, Europe: 
1990-1994) and 2002-2006 among patients aged 40-64, 65-74, and 75+. 
Additionally, we examine changes in yearly numbers of diagnoses and deaths and 
variation in male life expectancy.
RESULTS: Incidence and survival, particularly among patients aged <75, increased 
dramatically, yet both remain (with few exceptions in incidence) lower in Europe 
than in the United States. Mortality reductions, ongoing since the mid/late 1990 
s, were more consistent in the United States, had a distressingly small absolute 
impact among patients aged 40-64 and the largest absolute impact among those 
aged 75+. Overall ratios of additional diagnoses/avoided deaths varied between 
3.6 and 27.6, suggesting large differences in the actual impact of prostate 
cancer incidence and mortality changes. Ten years of remaining life expectancy 
was reached between 68 and 76 years.
CONCLUSION: Policies reflecting variation in population life expectancy, testing 
preferences, decision aids and guidelines for surveillance-based management are 
urgently needed.

Cost-effectiveness of total hip and knee replacements for the Australian 
population with osteoarthritis: discrete-event simulation model.

BACKGROUND: Osteoarthritis constitutes a major musculoskeletal burden for the 
aged Australians. Hip and knee replacement surgeries are effective interventions 
once all conservative therapies to manage the symptoms have been exhausted. This 
study aims to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of hip and knee replacements in 
Australia. To our best knowledge, the study is the first attempt to account for 
the dual nature of hip and knee osteoarthritis in modelling the severities of 
right and left joints separately.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We developed a discrete-event simulation model 
that follows up the individuals with osteoarthritis over their lifetimes. The 
model defines separate attributes for right and left joints and accounts for 
several repeat replacements. The Australian population with osteoarthritis who 
were 40 years of age or older in 2003 were followed up until extinct. 
Intervention effects were modelled by means of disability-adjusted life-years 
(DALYs) averted. Both hip and knee replacements are highly cost effective (AUD 
5,000 per DALY and AUD 12,000 per DALY respectively) under an AUD 50,000/DALY 
threshold level. The exclusion of cost offsets, and inclusion of future 
unrelated health care costs in extended years of life, did not change the 
findings that the interventions are cost-effective (AUD 17,000 per DALY and AUD 
26,000 per DALY respectively). However, there was a substantial difference 
between hip and knee replacements where surgeries administered for hips were 
more cost-effective than for knees.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Both hip and knee replacements are cost-effective 
interventions to improve the quality of life of people with osteoarthritis. It 
was also shown that the dual nature of hip and knee OA should be taken into 
account to provide more accurate estimation on the cost-effectiveness of hip and 
knee replacements.

Why Are Native Hawaiians Underrepresented in Hawai'i's Older Adult Population? 
Exploring Social and Behavioral Factors of Longevity.

Native Hawaiians comprise 24.3% of Hawai'i's population, but only 12.6% of the 
state's older adults. Few published studies have compared health indicators 
across ethnicities for the state's older adult population or focused on 
disparities of Native Hawaiian elders. The current study examines data from two 
state surveillance programs, with attention to cause of death and 
social-behavioral factors relevant to elders. Findings reveal that Native 
Hawaiians have the largest years of productive life lost and the lowest life 
expectancy, when compared to the state's other major ethnic groups. Heart 
disease and cancer are leading causes of premature mortality. Native Hawaiian 
elders are more likely to report behavioral health risks such as smoking and 
obesity, live within/below 100-199% of the poverty level, and find cost a 
barrier to seeking care. Indicated is the need for affordable care across the 
lifespan and health services continuum. Future research might explain behavioral 
factors as influenced by social determinants, including historical trauma on 
Native Hawaiian longevity.

The evolution of postreproductive life span as an insurance against 
indeterminacy.

Postreproductive life span remains a puzzle for evolutionary biologists. The 
explanation of increased inclusive fitness through parental care after 
reproduction that applies for humans is unrealistic for many species. We propose 
a new selective mechanism, independent of parental care, which relies on the 
hypothesis that postreproductive life span can evolve as an insurance against 
indeterminacy: longer life expectancy reduces the risk of dying by chance before 
the cessation of reproductive activity. We demonstrate numerically that the 
duration of evolved postreproductive life span is indeed expected to increase 
with variability in life span duration. An unprecedented assay of 11 strains of 
the collembola Folsomia candida shows the existence of (1) postreproductive life 
span in the absence of parental care; (2) genetic variability in mean 
postreproductive life span and postreproductive life span variability itself; 
(3) strong genetic correlation between latter traits. This new explanation 
brings along the novel idea that loose canalization of a trait (here, somatic 
life span) can itself act as a selective pressure on other traits.

ACTH-induced cortisol release is related to the copy number of the C4B gene 
encoding the fourth component of complement in patients with non-functional 
adrenal incidentaloma.

Hungary.

OBJECTIVE: According to our previous findings, carriers of the C4B*Q0 genotype, 
which means zero or one copy of the C4B gene, which is located in the RCCX copy 
number variation region on chromosome 6, have a significantly shorter 
life-expectancy and higher risk of cardiovascular disease than non-carriers. We 
have postulated that the C4B*Q0 genotype is linked to variant(s) of the 
neighboring CYP21A2 gene encoding a steroid 21-hydroxylase with altered 
function.
DESIGN: Single-center, observational, retrospective study.
PATIENTS: Seventy-six patients with non-functional, benign adrenal 
incidentaloma.
MEASUREMENTS: Serum cortisol, aldosterone, 17-hydroxyprogesterone, 
corticosterone and ACTH levels basally and after ACTH-stimulation, metyrapone or 
dexamethasone tests were determined. C4B gene copy number was quantified.
RESULTS: The ratio of ACTH-stimulated and baseline cortisol concentrations was 
significantly higher (P = 0·001) in the group of patients carrying the C4B*Q0 
genotype compared to the rest of the patients. This difference remained 
significant (P = 0·004) after adjustment for sex and age, as well as for tumor 
size. A significant (P = 0·018), adjusted difference between carriers and 
non-carriers was found also for ACTH-induced/basal aldosterone ratio. In C4B*Q0 
carriers, metyrapone hardly reduced the serum cortisol level, while in 
non-carriers it induced a highly significant (P = 0·002) decrease.
CONCLUSIONS: The C4B*Q0 genotype may be associated with hyperreactivity of the 
HPA axis (manifested as an increased responsiveness to ACTH-stimulation), 
probably through enhanced function of steroid 21-hydroxylase. Since 
hyperreactivity of the HPA axis is known to be associated with an increased risk 
of cardiovascular disease, our present findings may explain the increased 
cardiovascular morbidity and mortality of C4B*Q0 carriers.

    J Urol. 2012 Dec;188(6):2311-2.

PURPOSE: A prospective randomized controlled trial was performed in elderly 
patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) to evaluate the clinical 
effectiveness of channel transurethral resection of the prostate (C-TURP) 
combined with an interstitial laser coagulation (ILC) technique during a 4-year 
follow-up period.
METHODS: A total of 150 consecutive BPH patients were randomized to an 
ILC+C-TURP group (n = 50), an ILC group (n = 50) and a TURP group (n = 50). 
Urinary tract infection, acute urinary retention and retrograde ejaculation were 
monitored, and the retreatment rate, international prostate symptom score (IPSS) 
and maximum flow rate (Q(max)) were measured.
RESULTS: A total of 142 patients completed the follow-up and were recruited for 
further analysis. At 1 month, the proportion of patients with urinary tract 
infection was similar between the C-TURP+ILC group and the TURP group (8.5 and 
6.5%, p > 0.05), but significantly higher than that in the ILC group (51%, p < 
0.001). Acute urinary retention was found in 30.6% of patients in the ILC group, 
but was not observed in the C-TURP+ILC and TURP groups. In the TURP group, the 
rate of retrograde ejaculation was significantly higher than that in the other 2 
groups (p < 0.001). The retreatment rate was 8.5, 36.7 and 2.2% in the 
C-TURP+ILC, ILC and TURP groups, respectively (p < 0.001). When compared with 
baseline, the IPSS in the C-TURP+ILC, ILC and TURP groups was decreased by 70.6, 
45.4, and 81.0%, respectively (ILC vs. C-TURP+ILC or TURP, p < 0.01) at the 
48-month follow-up. One month after surgery, the Q(max) was significantly 
increased in the C-TURP+ILC group and the TURP group when compared with that at 
baseline (p < 0.01). The TURP group had the highest and the ILC group had the 
lowest increase in the Q(max) at the 12-, 24-, and 48-month follow-ups (p < 
0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: C-TURP+ILC is a safe and effective modality for the treatment of 
BPH, and exhibits favorable short-term clinical response and long-term 
durability. It is relatively reasonable and acceptable for treatment of 
high-risk elderly patients or those with a limited life expectancy.

BACKGROUND: The prevalence of "risky-behaviour" including alcohol and illicit 
drug use, smoking and unprotected sexual intercourse, of adults with cystic 
fibrosis (CF) is unknown. We conducted this prospective questionnaire-based 
study to further explore this issue.
METHODS: An anonymous 71-point questionnaire was sent to all adult patients aged 
≥18 years attending the Royal Brompton CF Unit. Results were compared to 
national (non-CF) data.
RESULTS: 83% (n=151) drink alcohol and 13% (n=23) drink more than recommended by 
national guidelines. 46% (n=84) have tried smoking and 3% (n=5) continue to 
smoke regularly. 35% (n=64) have tried illicit drugs and 3% (n=6) continue to 
use them. 86% (n=154) are sexually active; 60% use contraception (males 46%, 
females 62%). Compared with the general (non-CF) UK population, less CF patients 
drink heavily (13 vs. 23%; p<0.001), smoke (3 vs. 21%; p<0.001), have tried 
illicit drugs (35 vs. 37%; p<0.001) and are sexually active (86 vs. 97%; 
p<0.001).The same proportion use contraception (60 vs. 61%; p=0.8).
CONCLUSION: Participation in risky behaviour was modest. With improved life 
expectancy this may increase. Awareness of this is important so that health 
promotion measures can be introduced early.

Cohort differences and chronic disease profiles of differential disability 
trajectories.

State University, Tallahassee, FL 32306, USA. mtaylor3@fsu.edu

OBJECTIVES: Research shows declining disability rates, but little is known about 
whether cohort differences are due to delayed onset, increased recovery, or 
reduced severity of impairment. Furthermore, disease is considered the proximate 
cause of disability yet chronic conditions rates are increasing, making it 
unclear whether the conditions predicting specific disability trajectories are 
changing.
METHODS: We use a latent class analysis of disability trajectories and 
corresponding mortality with three birth cohorts of the National Long-Term Care 
Survey to determine how long-term experiences of disablement differ by cohort 
and chronic conditions.
RESULTS: More recent cohorts were more likely to experience a decade free of 
disablement compared with all other disability trajectories. Sensory problems 
and hypertension correspond to trajectories of non-disablement, whereas hip 
fracture, stroke, arthritis, and diabetes predict more disabled experiences.
DISCUSSION: Later life disability is measured nonparametrically to distinguish 
patterns among long-term trajectories. Findings suggest that more recent cohorts 
are more likely to forego or delay disability over a decade rather than 
experience prolonged periods of mild to severe disablement. Serious health 
events such as stroke, along with diabetes, characterize trajectories of high 
impairment, warranting future research.

Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India. gupta_v20032000@yahoo.com

PURPOSE: To evaluate the quality of life (QOL) of juvenile-onset primary 
open-angle glaucoma (JOAG) patients by using a utility-based assessment.
METHODS: QOL using time-tradeoff utility values was analyzed in 70 JOAG patients 
and compared with 108 adult-onset POAG patients. The relationships of utility 
values to parameters like age at diagnosis, visual acuity, mean deviation, 
number of medications and surgery, duration of the disease, level of education, 
and socioeconomic status were assessed.
RESULTS: The mean age at diagnosis of JOAG patients was 26 ± 9.8 years, whereas 
that of the adult onset POAG patients was 62 ± 11.2 years. Overall, there was a 
decrease in utility values with increasing age (r = -0.3; P < 0.001). The mean 
utility score among JOAG patients was (0.80 ± 0.18) significantly greater than 
among adult POAG patients (0.64 ± 0.28; P < 0.001). The differences in utility 
scores between JOAG and adult POAG patients were significant when adjusted for 
differences in better eye visual acuity, mean deviation, and the presence of 
systemic comorbidity among adults (P = 0.02). Among JOAG patients, those needing 
topical antiglaucoma medications and those with visual acuity worse than 6/12 in 
the better eye had lower utility values (P = 0.008 and P = 0.002, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: Utility values among glaucoma patients in the juvenile age group 
are better than those of adult POAG patients. Decreasing vision in the better 
eye and having to use medication decrease the utility scores among young 
patients with glaucoma.

Cost-effectiveness of second-line antihyperglycemic therapy in patients with 
type 2 diabetes mellitus inadequately controlled on metformin.

BACKGROUND: Metformin is widely accepted as first-line pharmacotherapy for 
patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus when glycemic control cannot be achieved 
by lifestyle interventions alone. However, uncertainty exists regarding the 
optimal second-line therapy for patients whose diabetes is inadequately 
controlled by metformin monotherapy. Increased use of newer, more costly agents, 
along with the rising incidence of type 2 diabetes, carries significant 
budgetary implications for health care systems. We conducted this analysis to 
determine the relative costs, benefits and cost-effectiveness of options for 
second-line treatment of type 2 diabetes.
METHODS: We used the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study Outcomes Model to 
forecast diabetes-related complications, quality-adjusted life-years and costs 
of alternative second-line therapies available in Canada for adults with type 2 
diabetes inadequately controlled by metformin. We obtained clinical data from a 
systematic review and mixed treatment comparison meta-analysis, and we obtained 
information on costs and utilities from published sources. We performed 
extensive sensitivity analyses to test the robustness of results to variation in 
inputs and assumptions.
RESULTS: Sulphonylureas, when added to metformin, were associated with the most 
favourable cost-effectiveness estimate, with an incremental cost of $12 757 per 
quality-adjusted life-year gained, relative to continued metformin monotherapy. 
Treatment with other agents, including thiazolidinediones and dipeptidyl 
peptidase-4 inhibitors, had unfavourable cost-effectiveness estimates compared 
with sulphonylureas. These results were robust to extensive sensitivity 
analyses.
INTERPRETATION: For most patients with type 2 diabetes that is inadequately 
controlled with metformin monotherapy, the addition of a sulphonylurea 
represents the most cost-effective second-line therapy.

PURPOSE: The disease outcome for patients with cancer is typically described in 
terms of estimated survival from diagnosis. Conditional probability offers more 
relevant information regarding survival for patients once they have survived for 
some time. We report conditional survival probabilities on the basis of 498 
patients with glioblastoma multiforme receiving radiation and chemotherapy. For 
1-year survivors, we evaluated variables that may inform subsequent survival. 
Motivated by the trend in data, we also evaluated the assumption of constant 
hazard.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients enrolled onto seven phase II protocols between 
1975 and 2007 were included. Conditional survival probabilities and 95% CIs were 
calculated. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to evaluate prognostic 
values of age, Karnofsky performance score (KPS), and prior progression 1-year 
post diagnosis. To assess the constant hazard assumption, we used a 
likelihood-ratio test to compare the Weibull and exponential distributions.
RESULTS: The probabilities of surviving an additional year given survival to 1, 
2, 3, and 4 years were 35%, 49%, 69%, and 93%, respectively. For patients who 
survived for 1 year, lower KPS and progression were significantly predictive of 
shorter survival (both P < .001), but age was not (hazard ratio, 1.22 for a 
10-year increase; P = .25). The Weibull distribution fits the data significantly 
better than exponential (P = .02), suggesting nonconstant hazard.
CONCLUSION: Conditional probabilities provide encouraging information regarding 
life expectancy to survivors of glioblastoma multiforme. Our data also showed 
that the constant hazard assumption may be violated in modern brain tumor 
trials. For single-arm trials, we advise using individual patient data from 
historical data sets for efficacy comparisons.

Case series of fertility treatment in HIV-discordant couples (male positive, 
female negative): the Ontario experience.

The success of combination antiretroviral therapies for the treatment of human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has resulted in prolonged life expectancy (over 40 
years from diagnosis) and an improved quality of life for people living with 
HIV. The risk of vertical HIV transmission during pregnancy has been reduced to 
less than 1%. As a result of these breakthroughs and as many of these 
individuals are of reproductive age, fertility issues are becoming increasingly 
important for this population. One population in which conception planning and 
reduction of horizontal HIV transmission warrants further research is 
HIV-discordant couples where the male partner is HIV-positive and the female 
partner is HIV-negative. Sperm washing is a technique carried out in a fertility 
clinic that separates HIV from the seminal fluid. Although sperm washing 
followed by intrauterine insemination significantly reduces the risk of 
horizontal HIV transmission, there has been limited access to the procedure in 
North America. Furthermore, little is known about the conception decision-making 
experiences of HIV-discordant couples who might benefit from sperm washing. 
Chart reviews and semi-structured interviews were completed with 12 
HIV-discordant couples in Ontario, Canada. Couples were recruited through HIV 
clinics and one fertility clinic that offered sperm washing. Participants 
identified a number of factors that affected their decision-making around 
pregnancy planning. Access to sperm washing and other fertility services was an 
issue (cost, travel and few clinics). Participants identified a lack of 
information on the procedure (availability, safety). Sources of support (social 
networks, healthcare providers) were unevenly distributed, especially among 
those who did not disclose their HIV status to friends and family. Finally, the 
stigmatisation of HIV continues to have a negative affect on HIV-discordant 
couples and their intentions to conceive. Access to sperm washing and fertility 
service is significantly limited for this population and is accompanied with a 
number of challenges.

A cluster-randomized controlled trial to reduce sedentary behavior and promote 
physical activity and health of 8-9 year olds: the Transform-Us! study.

BACKGROUND: Physical activity (PA) is associated with positive cardio-metabolic 
health and emerging evidence suggests sedentary behavior (SB) may be detrimental 
to children's health independent of PA. The primary aim of the Transform-Us! 
study is to determine whether an 18-month, behavioral and environmental 
intervention in the school and family settings results in higher levels of PA 
and lower rates of SB among 8-9 year old children compared with usual practice 
(post-intervention and 12-months follow-up). The secondary aims are to determine 
the independent and combined effects of PA and SB on children's cardio-metabolic 
health risk factors; identify the factors that mediate the success of the 
intervention; and determine whether the intervention is cost-effective.
METHODS/DESIGN: A four-arm cluster-randomized controlled trial (RCT) with a 2 × 
2 factorial design, with schools as the unit of randomization. Twenty schools 
will be allocated to one of four intervention groups, sedentary behavior (SB-I), 
physical activity (PA-I), combined SB and PA (SB+PA-I) or current practice 
control (C), which will be evaluated among approximately 600 children aged 8-9 
years in school year 3 living in Melbourne, Australia. All children in year 3 at 
intervention schools in 2010 (8-9 years) will receive the intervention over an 
18-month period with a maintenance 'booster' delivered in 2012 and children at 
all schools will be invited to participate in the evaluation assessments. To 
maximize the sample and to capture new students arriving at intervention and 
control schools, recruitment will be on-going up to the post-intervention time 
point. Primary outcomes are time spent sitting and in PA assessed via 
accelerometers and inclinometers and survey.
DISCUSSION: To our knowledge, Transform-Us! is the first RCT to examine the 
effectiveness of intervention strategies for reducing children's overall 
sedentary time, promoting PA and optimizing health outcomes. The integration of 
consistent strategies and messages to children from teachers and parents in both 
school and family settings is a critical component of this study, and if shown 
to be effective, may have a significant impact on educational policies as well 
as on pedagogical and parenting practices.

Comment in
    Climacteric. 2012 Apr;15(2):201-2.

BACKGROUND: The relationship between menopausal characteristics and later life 
mortality is unclear. We tested the hypotheses that women with surgical 
menopause would have increased all-cause and cardiovascular mortality compared 
with women with natural menopause, and that women with earlier ages at natural 
or surgical menopause would have greater all-cause and cardiovascular mortality 
than women with later ages at menopause.
METHODS: Women who participated in the Iowa cohort of the Established 
Populations for the Epidemiologic Study of the Elderly (n=1684) reported 
menopausal characteristics and potential confounding variables at baseline and 
were followed up for up to 24 years. Participants were aged 65 years or older at 
baseline and lived in rural areas. We used survival analysis to examine the 
relationships between menopausal characteristics and all-cause and 
cardiovascular mortality.
RESULTS: A total of 1477 women (87.7% of respondents) died during the study 
interval. Women with an age at natural menopause ≥55 years had increased 
all-cause and cardiovascular disease mortality compared with women who had 
natural menopause at younger ages. Type of menopause and age at surgical 
menopause were not related to mortality. These patterns persisted after 
adjustment for potential confounding variables.
CONCLUSIONS: Among an older group of women from a rural area of the United 
States, later age at natural menopause was related to increased all-cause and 
cardiovascular mortality. Monitoring the cardiovascular health of this group of 
older women may contribute to improved survival times.

Multimodal drugs and their future for Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease.

Van der Schyf CJ(1), Geldenhuys WJ.

Author information:

Medical University, Rootstown, Ohio, USA.

This chapter discusses the rationale for developing multimodal or 
multifunctional drugs (also called designed multiple ligands or DMLs) aimed at 
disease-modifying treatment strategies for the most common neurodegenerative 
diseases Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease (AD and PD). Both the prevalence 
and incidence of AD and PD have seen consistent and dramatic increases, a 
disconcerting phenomenon which, ironically, has been attributed to extended life 
expectancy brought about by better health care globally. In spite of these 
statistics, the development and introduction to the clinic of new therapies 
proven to prevent or delay the onset of AD and PD have been disappointing. 
Evidence has accumulated to suggest that the etiopathology of these diseases is 
extremely complex, with an array of potential drug targets located within a 
number of deleterious biochemical pathways. Therefore, in these diseases, it is 
unlikely that the complex pathoetiological cascade leading to disease initiation 
or progression will be mitigated by any one drug acting on a single pathway or 
target. The pursuit of novel DMLs may offer far better outcomes. Although 
certainly not the only, and perhaps not even the best, approach but farthest 
along the drug development pipeline in the DML paradigm are drugs that combine 
inhibition of monoamine oxidase with associated etiological targets unique to 
either AD or PD. These compounds will constitute the major focus of this 
chapter, which will also explore radically new paradigms that seek to combine 
cognitive enhancers with proneurogenesis compounds.

[Article in Portuguese]

Portugal.

Chronic wounds of the lower limbs are a major public healthcare problem 
affecting 1 percent of the adult population and 3 to 5 percent of people older 
than 65 years. These numbers are rising in the western population as a result of 
increased life expectancy and increased risk factors for atherosclerotic 
occlusion, such as smoking, obesity, and diabetes mellitus. This very 
debilitating condition, which reduces significantly the quality of life, causes 
social discomfort and generates considerable cost, not only to the patient but 
also to the society. Treating chronic leg ulcers is always a challenge. Over the 
last years, the treatment of this condition has been given more attention 
because of the frequent ineffectiveness of the methods used, the awareness of 
the psychological and social impact, and the recognition of the risks of 
malignancy in these wounds. Determining the etiology is an essential factor for 
directed and more effective wound care. Although 90 percent of ulcers are of 
vascular origin, the list of other possible causes responsible for the other 10 
percent is extremely long. In this review, the authors focus on the differential 
diagnosis of chronic leg ulcers and the impact of directed treatment in the 
prognosis of this condition.

BACKGROUND: Antiretroviral therapy has dramatically increased life expectancy in 
patients with HIV/AIDS although atherosclerosis has been associated with 
long-standing therapy.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the prevalence of atherosclerosis in patients with 
AIDS undergoing antiretroviral therapy and the influence of different schemes 
and duration of treatment.
METHODS: HIV/AIDS patients were approached during routine consultations. Those 
who had been on antiretroviral therapy for at least two years had their blood 
collected for analysis of lipid profile and fasting glycemia and underwent 
cardiac CT for quantification of calcium score within six days at the most. 
Atherosclerosis was defined as calcium score greater than zero (CAC > 0). 
Traditional risk factors, metabolic syndrome and Framingham score were analyzed.
RESULTS: Fifty-three patients performed cardiac CT. Twenty-seven (50.94%) were 
male, mean age 43.4 years; 20.00% had hypertension, 3.77% diabetes, 67.92% 
hypercholesterolemia, 37.74% hypertriglyceridemia and 47.17% low HDL. Thirteen 
(24.53%) met criteria for metabolic syndrome and 96.23% were classified in 
Framingham score as "low risk." Ten patients (18.87%) were smokers. Mean 
duration of antiretroviral treatment was 58.98 months. Coronary atherosclerosis 
occurred in 11 (20.75%) patients. Duration of antiretroviral therapy was not 
related to atherosclerosis (p = 0.41) and there were no significant differences 
between different antiretroviral regimens (p = 0.71). Among traditional risk 
factors, smoking (OR = 27.20; p = 0.023) and age (OR = 20.59; p = 0.033) were 
significant in the presence of atherosclerosis. There was a trend towards a 
positive association of atherosclerosis with hypercholesterolemia (OR = 8.30; p 
= 0.0668).
CONCLUSION: Factors associated with atherosclerosis were age, smoking and 
hypercholesterolemia. Duration and type of antiretroviral therapy had no 
influence on the prevalence of atherosclerosis.

Symptomatic metastases to the pituitary from renal cell carcinoma are rare. We 
present a case of pituitary metastases from renal cell carcinoma showing 
panhypopituitarism. A 50-year-old man who had renal cell carcinoma with distant 
metastases in skin, bone and lymph nodes was referred to our department. 
Clinically he showed severe cognitive function disorder. Endocrinological 
evaluation revealed central adrenal and gonadal insufficiencies. Brain magnetic 
resonance imaging demonstrated a hemorrhagic mass in left frontal lobe and a 
sellar mass with supra sellar cistern extension. After hormonal replacement and 
surgical removal of the frontal tumor, he immediately recovered from his 
cognitive function disorder. Subsequently, whole brain radiotherapy for 
metastatic pituitary tumor was performed. At present, he is being treated with 
molecular targeting drugs for other distant metastases and he presents no 
neurological deficit. Palliative therapy for CNS metastases from renal cell 
carcinoma may result in better quality of life for patients with advanced stage 
of renal cell carcinoma.
