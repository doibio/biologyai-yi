imatinib 800 mg/day. The incremental societal cost amounts to EUR 4 250 during 
the lifetime period, or EUR6880 per QALY gained.
CONCLUSION: The results indicate that dasatinib is a cost-effective treatment 
among imatinib-resistant CML patients in Sweden in comparison to imatinib 800 
mg/daily.

BACKGROUND: As the prevalence of heart failure (HF) rises sharply, the costs 
related to the care of these patients increases in parallel. Considering the 
already limited resources and manpower, in the future the demand for care may 
exceed the supply. Therefore, health care systems are encouraged to develop 
innovative strategies to deal with the burden of HF to improve the quality of 
care in order to medical outcomes and patients' quality of life. For that reason 
new management systems - such as telemonitoring - have to be explored.
OBJECTIVES: This paper outlines the study protocol of a tailor-made 
telemonitoring program in ambulant patients with HF.
DESIGN AND METHODS: A prospective randomised controlled trial is carried out at 
3 hospitals in the South-Limburg area in the Netherlands. Primary outcome 
measures are hospital admissions and cost-effectiveness. Secondary outcomes are 
effects on therapy compliance, level of disease specific knowledge and quality 
of life. Also determinants are studied of most and less benefited patients in 
the intervention group. POWER CALCULATION: It is estimated that 390 patients 
have to be included in the study, with 185 in each arm.
RESULTS: Inclusion started in September 2007 with a follow-up time of 12 months. 
First results are expected at the end of 2010.

PURPOSE: While new strategies for the treatment of invasive breast cancer (BC) 
are emerging, radiotherapy (RT) modalities are still under debate. The French 
expert review board of Nice-Saint-Paul de Vence was asked firstly to conduct a 
qualitative evidence-based systematic review and then to establish clinical 
practice guidelines for the use of post operative RT in invasive BC.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: A search to identify eligible studies was undertaken 
using the Medline® database. All phase III randomized trials and systematic 
reviews evaluating the role and modalities of RT in invasive BC were included, 
together with some noncontrolled studies if no randomized trials were 
identified. The quality and clinical relevance of the studies were evaluated to 
determine the level of evidence.
RESULTS: The maximum delay between surgery and RT should ≤8 weeks when 
chemotherapy (CT) is not indicated. This should not exceed 24 weeks when 
adjuvant CT is administered. Whole breast RT delivering 50 Gy in 25 fractions 
followed by a boost of 10-16 Gy remains the standard of care after conservative 
surgery (CS). In the elderly population, for certain cases presenting 
comorbidities associated with a limited life expectancy, RT indication (even 
hypofractioned) and boost delivery may be unnecessary in the light of an 
unfavourable risk/benefit ratio. RT technique and indications should not vary in 
case of neoadjuvant CT followed by CS. After total mastectomy, RT should be 
indicated in N+ and in N- patients with high risk of local recurrence. The 
experts recommend to initiate tamoxifen at the end of RT, while aromatase 
inhibitors could be administered either concomitantly or sequentially with RT. 
There is no consistent data to delay (or suspend) trastuzumab administration 
during RT. As for all patients, in case of concurrent RT-trastuzumab 
administration, reduction of cardiac tissues exposure is highly recommended. 
After breast reconstruction, RT should be delivered as after standard CS without 
boost.
CONCLUSION: Due to significant variations in practice in the treatment of 
patients with BC, our group aimed to provide guidelines for clinical practice. 
The systematic review of the literature formed the basis of our evidence-based 
recommendations; however expert agreements were necessary on those subjects that 
are still under debate. Our group will update these guidelines every 4 years, 
taking in consideration new advances in technology, new drugs administration, 
biologic tools and innovative therapeutic options.

To assess whether the pattern of presentation and the outcome of monoclonal 
gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) have changed over the last 3 
decades, we evaluated 1400 patients, divided into 3 groups: group I (1975-1987), 
group II (1988-1997), and group III (1998-2007). We observed a significant 
increase in age (p = 0.001), IgM and biclonal MGUS (p = 0.003), hemoglobin (p < 
0.0001), and albumin (p = 0.0001), and a significant reduction of monoclonal 
(M)-protein concentration (p < 0.0001), percentage of bone marrow plasma cells 
(p < 0.0001), and beta2-microglobulin (p = 0.0001) over the 3 decades. The 
proportion of patients with M-protein <1.5 g/dL was significantly higher in 
group III (66%) than in group II (44%) and group I (26%) (p < 0.0001). By 
Kaplan-Meier analysis, group III had a significantly lower 5-year probability of 
transformation (5%) compared to group II (12%) and group I (22%) (p = 0.003). 
Patients with M-protein <1.5 g/dL had the same life expectancy as the general 
population (standardized mortality ratio 1.09; p = 0.41). In conclusion, we 
found that the pattern of presentation of MGUS has changed over time and now 
includes a higher proportion of patients with more favorable presenting features 
and probably a better outcome compared to patients presenting in the past. This 
changing scenario calls for revising the current concepts of the clinical 
significance of MGUS and the management of patients.

The Journal recently incorrectly ascribed cost-effectiveness thresholds to New 
Zealand, alongside other countries. New Zealand has no such thresholds when 
deciding the funding of pharmaceuticals. As we fund pharmaceuticals within a 
fixed budget, and cost-effectiveness is only one of nine decision criteria used 
to inform decisions, thresholds cannot be inferred or calculated. Thresholds 
inadequately account for opportunity cost and affordability, and are 
incompatible with budgets and maximising health gains. In New Zealand, 
pharmaceutical investments can only be considered 'cost-effective' when 
prioritised against other proposals at the time, and threshold levels must 
inevitably vary with available funds and the other criteria.

Cost-effectiveness of an intervention to reduce HIV/STI incidence and promote 
condom use among female sex workers in the Mexico-US border region.

California San Diego, La Jolla, California, United States of America.

BACKGROUND: Previous research demonstrated efficacy of a brief behavioral 
intervention to reduce incidence of HIV and sexually transmitted infections 
(STIs) among female sex workers (FSWs) in Tijuana and Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, 
cities on Mexico's border with the US. We assessed this intervention's 
cost-effectiveness.
METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A life-time Markov model was developed to 
estimate HIV cases prevented, changes in quality-adjusted life expectancy 
(QALE), and costs per additional quality-adjusted life year gained (QALY), 
comparing (in US$2,009) no intervention to a once-only and annual intervention. 
Future costs and health benefits were discounted annually at 3%. Sensitivity 
analyses evaluated model robustness. We found that for a hypothetical 1,000 FSWs 
receiving the once-only intervention, there were 33 HIV cases prevented and 5.7 
months of QALE gained compared to no intervention. The additional cost per QALY 
gained was US$183. For FSWs receiving the intervention annually, there were 29 
additional HIV cases prevented and 4.5 additional months of QALE compared to the 
once-only intervention. The additional cost per QALY was US$1,075. When highly 
active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) was included in the model, the annual 
intervention strategy resulted in net savings and dominated both once-only and 
no intervention strategies, and remained robust across extensive sensitivity 
analyses. Even when considering clinical benefits from HAART, ignoring added 
costs, the cost per QALY gained remained below three times the Mexican GDP per 
capita, and below established cost-effectiveness thresholds.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This brief intervention was shown to be cost-effective 
among FSWs in two Mexico-US border cities and may have application for FSWs in 
other resource-limited settings.

BACKGROUND: The United States and international agencies have signaled their 
commitment to containing the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) epidemic via 
early case identification and linkage to antiretroviral therapy (ART) 
immediately at diagnosis. We forecast outcomes of this approach if implemented 
in Washington DC.
METHODS: Using a mathematical model of HIV case detection and treatment, we 
evaluated combinations of HIV screening and ART initiation strategies. We define 
current practice as no regular screening program and ART at CD4 counts < or = 
350 cells/microL, and we define test and treat as annual screening and 
administration of ART at diagnosis. Outcomes include life expectancy of 
HIV-infected persons and changes in the population time with transmissible HIV 
RNA levels. Data, largely from Washington DC, include undiagnosed HIV prevalence 
of 0.6%, annual incidence of 0.13%, 31% rate of test offer, 60% rate of 
acceptance, and 50% linkage to care. Input parameters, including optimized ART 
efficacy, are varied in sensitivity analyses.
RESULTS: Projected life expectancies, from an initial mean age of 41 years, are 
23.9, 25.0, and 25.6 years for current practice, test and treat, and test and 
treat with optimized ART, respectively. Compared with current practice, test and 
treat leads to a 14.7% reduction in time spent with transmissible HIV RNA level 
in the next 5 years; test and treat with optimized ART results in a 27.3% 
reduction.
CONCLUSIONS: An expanded HIV test and treat program in Washington DC will 
increase life expectancy of HIV-infected patients but will have a modest impact 
on HIV transmission over the next 5 years and is unlikely to halt the HIV 
epidemic.

Cost-effectiveness of Weight Watchers and the Lighten Up to a Healthy Lifestyle 
program.

Australia. l.cobiac@uq.edu.au

OBJECTIVE: Intensive weight loss programs that incorporate dietary counselling 
and exercise advice are popular and are supported by evidence of immediate 
weight loss benefits. We evaluate the cost-effectiveness of two weight loss 
programs, Lighten Up to a Healthy Lifestyle and Weight Watchers.
METHODS: Health gains from prevention of chronic disease are modelled over the 
lifetime of the Australian population. These results are combined with estimates 
of intervention costs and cost offsets (due to reduced rates of 
lifestyle-related diseases) to determine the dollars per disability-adjusted 
life year (DALY) averted by each intervention program, from an Australian health 
sector perspective.
RESULTS: Both weight loss programs produced small improvements in population 
health compared to current practice. The time and travel associated with 
attending group-counselling sessions, however, was costly for patients, and 
overall the cost-effectiveness ratios for Lighten Up ($130,000/DALY) and Weight 
Watchers ($140,000/DALY) were high.
CONCLUSION: Based on current evidence, these intensive behavioural counselling 
interventions are not very cost-effective strategies for reducing obesity, and 
the potential benefits for population health are small.
IMPLICATIONS: It will be critical to consider other strategies (e.g. changing 
the 'obesogenic' environment) or explore alternative methods of intervention 
delivery (e.g. Internet) to see if they offer a more cost-effective approach by 
effectively reaching a high number of people at a low cost.

OBJECTIVE: To compare the burden of alcohol-related harm and underlying factors 
of this harm, by age and sex, for Indigenous and general population Australians.
METHODS: Population attributable fractions are used to estimate the disability 
adjusted life years (DALYs) for alcohol-related disease and injury. The DALYs 
were converted to rates per 1,000 by age and sex for the Indigenous and general 
populations.
RESULTS: Homicide and violence rates were much higher for Indigenous males: 
greatest population difference was for 30-44 years, Indigenous rate 8.9 times 
higher. Rates of suicide were also greater: the largest population difference 
was for 15-29 years, Indigenous rate 3.9 times higher. Similarly, for Indigenous 
females, homicide and violence rates were much higher: greatest population 
difference was for 30-44 years, Indigenous rate 18.1 times higher. Rates of 
suicide were also greater: the largest population difference was for 15-29 
years, Indigenous rate 5.0 times higher.
CONCLUSIONS: Alcohol consumption and associated harms are of great concern for 
Indigenous Australians across all ages. Violent alcohol-related harms have been 
highlighted as a major concern.
IMPLICATIONS: To reduce the disproportionate burden of alcohol-related harm 
experienced by Indigenous Australians, targeted interventions should include the 
impact on families and communities and not just the individual.

Living longer with a greater health burden--changes in the burden of disease and 
injury in the Northern Territory Indigenous population between 1994-1998 and 
1999-2003.

OBJECTIVE: To measure changes over time in the burden of disease for Northern 
Territory (NT) Indigenous and non-Indigenous population.
METHODS: The numbers, and crude and age-adjusted rates of disability adjusted 
life years (DALY) were calculated for periods 1994-1998 and 1999-2003. A measure 
of information bias was developed to adjust for the tendency of years lost to 
disability (a component of DALY) to increase over time because of increasing 
data availability. The jackknife method was used for DALY uncertainty 
assessment.
RESULTS: The all-cause DALY rate was stable for the non-Indigenous population, 
but increased for the Indigenous population. For both populations, the burden of 
premature death decreased while the burden of disability increased. For the 
Indigenous population, there were substantial increases in DALY rates for type 2 
diabetes, depression, nephritis/nephrosis, suicide and sense organ disorders.
CONCLUSIONS: The burden of disease for Indigenous people increased over the 
study periods, with improvement in the burden of fatal outcomes more than offset 
by substantial increase in the prevalence and severity of non-fatal conditions.
IMPLICATIONS: The paradoxical shift of living longer with a greater health 
burden has not been previously reported for Indigenous Australians, and 
highlights the critical importance of prevention for sustaining life expectancy 
improvement and managing escalation of health costs. This study also 
demonstrated the usefulness of the DALY to monitor population health.

Life events involvement in psoriasis onset/recurrence.

Manolache L(1), Petrescu-Seceleanu D, Benea V.

Author information:
(1)Cetatea Histria Polyclinic, Bucharest, Romania. lianamanolache@yahoo.com

BACKGROUND: The purpose of the study was to evaluate the possible role of stress 
before the onset/extension/recurrence of psoriasis.
PATIENTS AND METHOD: One hundred and sixty-nine outpatients with psoriasis and 
169 age and gender matched controls were enrolled. The design was a case-control 
study (controls had skin diseases with low psychosomatic component). Stressful 
life events were evaluated using Holmes and Rahe's Social Readjustment Rating 
Scale.
RESULTS: In the psoriatic group, there was a female predominance (66%) and a 
median age 47.55 years (SD = 20.32). In all, 10.65% of patients had family 
history of psoriasis. More than 54% of cases experienced at least one stressful 
event (47.36% for onset, 63.51% for recurrence/extension), compared with 19.52% 
of controls (chi(2) = 42.71, P < 0.0001). The odds ratio was 4.92. There was a 
significant difference in the mean number of stressful events between patients 
and controls (P < 0.0001). Women with psoriasis vulgaris and men with guttate 
psoriasis seemed to be more sensitive to stressful events. We divided the events 
described by Holmes and Rahe into three categories: family, personal, and 
job/financial problems. Family matters were mentioned by 42.7% of psoriatic 
patients, statistically significant compared with controls (P < 0.0001). In 35% 
of psoriatic cases, "the stressful event" was represented by the illness/death 
of someone dear. Both "personal" (25.6%; P = 0.02) and "job/financial problems" 
(31.6%; P < 0.0001) were significantly different compared with controls.
CONCLUSIONS: Stressful events could be highly related to psoriasis (especially 
in recurrences/extensions). Problems related to family are the most often 
involved with counseling being suggested.

Pemphigus vulgaris is the most common autoimmune bullous disease in Northwestern 
Romania.

Romania.

BACKGROUND: Autoimmune bullous diseases are organ-specific diseases 
characterized by autoreactive T and B cells specific for structural proteins of 
the skin. The incidence and prevalence of autoimmune blistering diseases vary in 
different countries and their epidemiology has not yet been addressed in 
Romania.
METHODS: In this study between 2001 and 2007, we prospectively investigated a 
total of 116 patients with autoimmune blistering diseases from the Northwestern 
region of Romania. The diagnosis was based on the clinical, histo- and 
immunohistological as well as serological findings.
RESULTS: Pemphigus was the most common disease representing 58.6% of the case 
(68 cases); 40 cases (34.5%) were diagnosed with bullous pemphigoid (BP) and 
eight cases (6.9%) with other autoimmune sub-epidermal diseases. The incidence 
and prevalence of pemphigus diseases were four patients/1,000,000 
inhabitants/year and 0.00248%, respectively. BP occurred in 2.5/1,000,000 
inhabitants/year and its prevalence was 0.00146%. While the average onset age 
for pemphigus vulgaris was 53 years, BP patients were first diagnosed at a mean 
age of 73.6 years.
CONCLUSION: The genetic background of the local population may explain why 
pemphigus occurs more commonly than BP in Northwestern Romania compared with the 
population of Western Europe. In addition, the shorter life expectancy in 
Romania (71.3 years) compared with Western Europe (>80 years) may contribute to 
this phenomenon.

Oslo, Norway. erlre@online.no

BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: A high risk of new mucosal malignancies of the upper 
aerodigestive tract (UADT) is seen in patients successfully treated for oral 
cancer. The prognosis is unclear for these patients. A typical failure may be 
located at the site of the first tumor i.e. a local recurrence; or separately as 
a second primary tumor (SPT). It is unknown whether these two types of local 
failures have different prognosis.
STUDY DESIGN: Longitudinal observational cohort study employing prospectively 
collected data over 25 years.
METHODS: The rate of local recurrences and UADT SPTs was analyzed in 151 
patients previously treated for T1N0M0 oral squamous cell carcinoma. Survival 
after failure was compared between patients with local recurrence and local SPT.
RESULTS: All patients had a 5-year cancer specific survival of 86.3%. Of the 151 
patients, 20 had a local recurrence, and 16 had an UADT SPT. After a local 
failure, survival was median 17.2 months for local recurrence and 18.9 for UADT 
SPT (cancer specific). Time from primary tumor treatment to local recurrence was 
median 42 and months vs. 125 months for UADT SPTs. A similar linear pattern of 
presentation over time was seen for both tumor types.
CONCLUSION: Outcome was poor after the date of the local failure. No difference 
in survival was seen whether the failure was a local recurrence or a second 
primary tumor. The similarity in survival and pattern of presentation suggests 
that these two entities may be biologically analogous.

Osteoarthritis (OA) is a widespread degenerative disease of skeletal joints and 
is often associated with senescence in vertebrates. OA commonly results from 
excessive or abnormal mechanical loading of weight-bearing joints 
('wear-and-tear'), arising from heavy long-term use or specific injuries; yet, 
in the absence of injury, the aetiology of OA remains obscure. We show that poor 
nutritional conditions experienced by moose (Alces alces) early in life are 
linked to greater prevalence of OA during senescence as well as reduced life 
expectancy. Moreover, we also found a negative relationship between kill rate by 
wolves (Canis lupus) and prevalence of OA, suggesting a potential connection 
between senescence of prey and the population ecology of predator-prey systems. 
This association between OA and early malnutrition also provides a basis for 
explaining the observation in anthropology that OA became more prevalent in 
native Americans as their diet become poorer - the result of relying more on 
corn and agriculture and less on hunting and gathering.

Center, Evelyn H. Lauder Breast Center, New York, NY 10065, USA.

BACKGROUND: Older women are less likely to receive standard of care treatment 
for breast cancer.
METHODS: We examined variables that affected the outcome of elderly patients ≥70 
years old among 1,470 patients with invasive cancer with positive sentinel lymph 
nodes (SLNs).
RESULTS: Elderly patients were less likely to undergo mastectomy, completion 
axillary node dissection (ALND), adjuvant chemotherapy, and radiotherapy (RT) 
following breast-conserving therapy (BCT) compared with patients <70 years old. 
The 5-year risk of disease progression and cumulative incidence of breast 
cancer-specific deaths were not significantly different for both groups. On 
multivariate analysis, hormone receptor-negative status, number of metastatic 
lymph nodes, high nuclear grade, and tumor size were the factors independently 
associated with increased risk of disease progression.
CONCLUSIONS: Tumor factors were the primary determinants of breast cancer 
outcomes in our cohort. Elderly patients are less likely to receive aggressive 
surgical interventions and adjuvant therapy because of perceived life 
expectancy.

ischemia.

OBJECTIVE: The efficacy of tibial artery endovascular intervention (TAEI) for 
critical limb ischemia (CLI) and particularly for wound healing is not fully 
defined. The purpose of this study is to determine predictors of failure and 
success for TAEI in the setting of CLI.
METHODS: All TAEI for tissue loss or rest pain (Rutherford classes 4, 5, and 6) 
from 2004 to 2008 were retrospectively reviewed. Clinical outcomes and patency 
rates were analyzed by multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression and 
life table analysis.
RESULTS: One hundred twenty-three limbs in 111 patients (62% male, mean age 74) 
were treated. Sixty-seven percent of patients were diabetics, 55% had renal 
insufficiency, and 21% required hemodialysis. One hundred two limbs (83%) 
exhibited tissue loss; all others had ischemic rest pain. All patients underwent 
tibial angioplasty (PTA). Tibial excimer laser atherectomy was performed in 14% 
of the patients. Interventions were performed on multiple tibial vessels in 20% 
of limbs. Isolated tibial procedures were performed on 50 limbs (41%), while 73 
patients had concurrent ipsilateral superficial femoral artery or popliteal 
interventions. The mean distal popliteal and tibial runoff score improved from 
11.8 ± 3.6 to 6.7 ± 1.6 (P < .001), and the mean ankle-brachial index increased 
from 0.61 ± 0.26 to 0.85 ± 0.22 (P < .001). Surgical bypass was required in 
seven patients (6%). The mean follow up was 6.8 ± 6.6 months, while the 1-year 
primary, primary-assisted, and secondary patency rates were 33%, 50%, and 56% 
respectively. Limb salvage rate at 1 year was 75%. Factors found to be 
associated with impaired limb salvage included renal insufficiency (hazard ratio 
[HR] = 5.7; P = .03) and the need for pedal intervention (HR = 13.75; P = .04). 
TAEI in an isolated peroneal artery (odds ratio = 7.80; P = .01) was associated 
with impaired wound healing, whereas multilevel intervention (HR = 2.1; P = 
.009) and tibial laser atherectomy (HR = 3.1; P = .01) were predictors of wound 
healing. In patients with tissue loss, 41% achieved complete closure (mean time 
to healing, 10.7 ± 7.4 months), and 39% exhibited partial wound healing (mean 
follow up, 4.4 ± 4.8 months) at last follow up. Diabetes, smoking, statin 
therapy, and revascularization of > 1 tibial vessel had no impact on limb 
salvage or wound healing. Re-intervention rate was 50% at 1 year.
CONCLUSIONS: TAEI is an effective treatment for CLI with acceptable limb salvage 
and wound healing rates, but requires a high rate of reintervention. Patients 
with renal failure, pedal disease, or isolated peroneal runoff have poor 
outcomes with TAEI and should be considered for surgical bypass.

Radon is a naturally occurring inert radioactive gas found in soils and rocks 
that can accumulate in dwellings, and is associated with an increased risk of 
lung cancer. This study aims to analyze the cost effectiveness of different 
intervention strategies to reduce radon concentrations in existing German 
dwellings. The cost effectiveness analysis (CEA) was conducted as a scenario 
analysis, where each scenario represents a specific regulatory regime. A 
decision theoretic model was developed, which reflects accepted recommendations 
for radon screening and mitigation and uses most up-to-date data on radon 
distribution and relative risks. The model was programmed to account for 
compliance with respect to the single steps of radon intervention, as well as 
data on the sensitivity/specificity of radon tests. A societal perspective was 
adopted to calculate costs and effects. All scenarios were calculated for 
different action levels. Cost effectiveness was measured in costs per averted 
case of lung cancer, costs per life year gained and costs per quality adjusted 
life year (QALY) gained. Univariate and multivariate deterministic and 
probabilistic sensitivity analyses (SA) were performed. Probabilistic 
sensitivity analyses were based on Monte Carlo simulations with 5000 model runs. 
The results show that legal regulations with mandatory screening and mitigation 
for indoor radon levels >100 Bq/m(3) are most cost effective. Incremental cost 
effectiveness compared to the no mitigation base case is 25,181 euro (95% CI: 
7371 euro-90,593 euro) per QALY gained. Other intervention strategies focussing 
primarily on the personal responsibility for screening and/or mitigative actions 
show considerably worse cost effectiveness ratios. However, targeting radon 
intervention to radon-prone areas is significantly more cost effective. Most of 
the uncertainty that surrounds the results can be ascribed to the relative risk 
of radon exposure. It can be concluded that in the light of international 
experience a legal regulation requiring radon screening and, if necessary, 
mitigation is justifiable under the terms of CEA.

Study Group of Northern New England.

BACKGROUND: Level I evidence shows conventional carotid endarterectomy (CEA) 
with patch angioplasty results in lower rates of restenosis. However, whether 
this information has affected practice patterns and outcomes in real-world 
vascular surgery settings is unclear.
METHODS: Within the Vascular Study Group of New England (VSGNE), we studied 2981 
patients undergoing 2981 first-time CEAs between January 1, 2003, and June 31, 
2008. Rates of restenosis (defined by duplex ultrasound imaging at the 1-year 
follow-up) were estimated using life-table analysis. Cox proportional hazards 
models were used to identify multivariable predictors of postoperative 
restenosis ≤ 1 year.
RESULTS: Across 58 surgeons and 11 hospitals, we studied 2611 conventional CEAs 
(88% of all CEAs) and 370 eversion CEAs (12% of all CEAs). Median follow-up was 
12.8 months (range, 1-35 months). The proportion of conventional CEAs performed 
with patching increased from 87% to 96% (P < .001) between 2003 and 2008, 
whereas eversion CEA declined from 18% to 5% (P < .001). Restenosis occurred in 
303 patients (10%); by life-table analysis, the restenosis rate at 1 year was 
6.2% (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.7%-6.8%). Restenoses were most commonly 
noncritical: 50%-79% restenosis in 7.9%, 80%-99% restenosis in 1.7%, and 
occlusion in 0.5%. Univariate analyses showed significant differences in 80% to 
100% restenosis by procedure type (2% in conventional CEA, 6% in eversion CEA, P 
< .002), the year of procedure (3.2% in 2003, 0% in 2008; P < .03), and use of 
patching in conventional CEA (2.9% no patch, 1% with patch; P < .008). By 
multivariable analysis, absence of patching (hazard ratio [HR], 3.2; 95% CI, 
1.5-7.0), contralateral internal carotid artery stenosis > 80% (HR, 4.1; 95% CI, 
1.4-11.5), and dialysis dependence (HR, 3.5; 95% CI, 1.2-9.8) were independently 
associated with a higher risk of an 80% to 100% restenosis. Of the 51 patients 
with 80% to 99% restenosis, 14 underwent reintervention ≤ 1 year, comprising 4 
reoperations and 10 carotid artery stent procedures. Of the 15 patients with a 
carotid occlusion ≤ 1 year, transient ischemic attacks occurred in 2 and a 
disabling stroke in 1.
CONCLUSIONS: In our region, restenosis after CEA, especially clinically 
significant restenosis ≤ 1 year after surgery, decreased slightly over time. 
This improvement in outcome was associated with several factors, including an 
increase in patching after conventional CEA, a process of care that was studied 
and encouraged within our vascular study group. These results highlight the 
utility of regional quality-improvement efforts in improving outcomes in 
vascular surgery.

The need for routine physical health care in schizophrenia.

Montejo AL(1).

Salamanca, Spain. amontejo@usal.es

When managing their patients with schizophrenia, psychiatrists are increasingly 
concerned about physical disorders, including weight gain, obesity, metabolic 
abnormalities (in particular, diabetes and the metabolic syndrome), prolactin 
increase, sexual dysfunction and cardiovascular disease. Other common 
health-related problems in these patients include recreational drug use, 
sedation/physical inactivity, adverse drug effects and poor self-care. Each of 
these can have an impact on patient well-being, adherence to therapy and life 
expectancy. Collectively they can pose substantial barriers to optimal outcomes. 
However, the widespread acknowledgement of the importance of the physical health 
of patients with schizophrenia does not always result in consistent monitoring 
and management of physical health risks in the clinic. Urgent action is needed 
to ensure that psychiatrists prioritise physical healthcare alongside mental 
healthcare as a way to improve the longterm outcomes of treatment in all 
patients with schizophrenia.

Physical health in schizophrenia: a challenge for antipsychotic therapy.

Heald A(1).

UK. adrian.heald@manchester.ac.uk

In the management of schizophrenia, mental health outcomes are the principal 
focus of treatment. The objective is to control the psychotic symptoms while 
minimising negative features of the illness, to achieve an overall improvement 
in the societal functioning of patients. Physical health is also important 
because if it is compromised, many of the benefits of improved mental health 
will be offset. Compared with the general population, schizophrenia patients are 
at increased risk of weight gain, abdominal obesity, diabetes, metabolic 
syndrome, and cardiovascular disease. These physical health problems can 
contribute to the decreased quality of life, lowered self-esteem and reduced 
life expectancy commonly reported in schizophrenia. For these reasons there is a 
pressing need to improve both the monitoring and the management of physical 
health in patients with schizophrenia as a part of their overall care. A 
consensus for metabolic monitoring of patients receiving treatment with 
antipsychotic drugs is available. However, the practicing clinician requires 
guidance about management of physical health in routine clinical practice. This 
should include recommendations for measurements that have strong predictive 
value about physical health risks yet are easy to make, and about the use of 
medications that have the least effect on physical health parameters. This 
article will review the gravity of the physical health risks facing 
schizophrenia patients.

[Chemotherapy in early stage of hormone-resistant metastatic prostate cancer: 
what are the indications?].

[Article in French]

Treatment of hormone-refractory prostate cancer remains a source of debate. 
Since 2004, docétaxel-based chemotherapy has become the standard treatment as it 
has demonstrated efficacy on overall survival in two randomized studies. In some 
studies, chemotherapy seems to be also effective on pain relief. The adverse 
effects occur more frequently than with others chemotherapy (mitoxantrone) but 
are moderated and aren't responsible of specific mortality. These facts 
encourage to begin the chemotherapy as earlier as possible even before 
metastases appear. Some studies have even raised the issue of an initiation of 
chemotherapy before the onset of hormone independence. However these arguments 
might be use with caution. The treated patients have a limited life expectancy 
and a 2 months gain of survival may be of limited value. Furthermore, even low 
side effects can generate a morbidity on these fragile patients especially when 
they are initially asymptomatic. Thus, an early initiation of chemotherapy must 
be discussed case by case, on an individual basis. The prognosis factors and 
alternative therapeutic options based on new molecules used in metastatic cancer 
might also be considered for the therapeutic decision.

CONTEXT: Estimating life expectancy is challenging in advanced dementia.
OBJECTIVES: To create a risk score to estimate survival in nursing home (NH) 
residents with advanced dementia.
METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study performed in the setting of all 
licensed U.S. NHs. Residents with advanced dementia living in U.S. NHs in 2002 
were identified using Minimum Data Set (MDS) assessments. Mortality data from 
Medicare files were used to determine 12-month survival. Independent variables 
were selected from the MDS. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to 
model survival. The accuracy of the final model was assessed using the area 
under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). To develop a risk 
score, points were assigned to variables in the final model based on parameter 
estimates. Residents meeting hospice eligibility guidelines for dementia, based 
on MDS data, were identified. The AUROC assessed the accuracy of hospice 
guidelines to predict six-month survival.
RESULTS: Over 12 months, 40.6% of residents with advanced dementia (n=22,405) 
died. Twelve variables best predicted survival: length of stay, age, male, 
dyspnea, pressure ulcers, total functional dependence, bedfast, insufficient 
intake, bowel incontinence, body mass index, weight loss, and congestive heart 
failure. The AUROC for the final model was 0.68. The risk score ranged from 1 to 
32.5 points (higher scores indicate worse survival). Only 15.9% of residents met 
hospice eligibility guidelines for which the AUROC predicting six-month survival 
was 0.53.
CONCLUSION: A mortality risk score derived from MDS data predicted six-month 
survival in advanced dementia with moderate accuracy. The predictive ability of 
hospice guidelines, simulated with MDS data, was poor.

OBJECTIVE: The effects of fish oil including ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids on 
aging and lifespan are not well understood. In this study, the influence of 
long-term ingestion of fish oil on lifespan was examined in 
senescence-accelerated (SAMP8) mice.
METHODS: We investigated the effects of dietary fish oil on lifespan and on 
lipid composition and oxidative stress in plasma and liver in SAMP8 mice. Male 
mice were fed a fish oil diet (5% fish oil and 5% safflower oil) or a safflower 
oil diet (10% safflower oil) from 12 wk of age.
RESULTS: The SAMP8 mice fed fish oil did not have a longer maximum lifespan and 
had a shorter average lifespan than mice fed safflower oil. To examine the 
mechanism underlying these results, the effects on oxidative stress of long-term 
ingestion of fish oil were also examined. SAMP8 mice fed fish oil for 28 wk 
showed strong oxidative stress that caused hyperoxidation of membrane 
phospholipids and a diminished antioxidant defense system due to a decrease in 
tocopherol compared with mice fed safflower oil.
CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that intake of fish oil increases oxidative 
stress, decreases cellular function, and causes organ dysfunction in SAMP8 mice, 
thereby promoting aging and shortening the lifespan of the mice.
