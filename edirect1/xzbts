which averaged 18.8 USD (median = 0 USD), excluding cost of medications.
DISCUSSION: Forced displacement presents major challenges to those with NCDs, 
which have the potential to seriously impact both the quality of life and life 
expectancy amongst refugees. NCD patterns among Syrian refugees indicate the 
importance of continuing support to public sector services in Jordan to 
adequately meet expanding needs and ensure appropriate prevention and control of 
priority NCDs.

Health care spending in the United States continues to rise with cancer care 
consuming a disproportionate amount of that spending. As the US population ages 
and cancer treatment options become more complex, cost containment strategies 
have become essential in oncology. Patient-centered decision-making will help to 
contain costs but requires a well-informed patient who is able to reconcile 
potential treatment choices with their beliefs and values. J. Surg. Oncol.

Bilateral vestibular schwannomata and meningiomata are the tumours most commonly 
associated with neurofibromatosis type II (NF2). These tumours may also be seen 
in patients with schwannomatosis and familial meningioma, but these phenotypes 
are usually easy to distinguish. The main diagnostic challenge when managing 
these tumours is distinguishing between sporadic disease which carries low risk 
of subsequent tumours or NF2 with its associated morbidities and reduced life 
expectancy. This chapter outlines some of the diagnostic and management 
considerations along with associated evidence.

AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: The aim of this work was to estimate the life expectancy (LE) 
and disability-free life expectancy (DFLE) for adults with and without diabetes.
METHODS: The Chiang method and the adapted Sullivan method were used to estimate 
LE and DFLE by age and sex. Mortality data in 2011 were available from the 
National Diabetes Services Scheme for diabetes and from standard national 
mortality datasets for the general population. Data on prevalence of disability 
and severe or profound core activity limitation were derived from the 2012 
Australian Survey of Disability, Ageing and Carers (SDAC). The definitions of 
disability used in the SDAC followed the International Classification of 
Functioning, Disability and Health. Data on diabetes prevalence were derived 
from the Australian Diabetes, Obesity and Lifestyle study.
RESULTS: The estimated LE and DFLE (with 95% uncertainty interval [UI]) at age 
50 years were 30.2 (30.0, 30.4) and 12.7 (11.5, 13.7) years, respectively, for 
men with diabetes, and the estimates were 33.9 (33.6, 34.1) and 13.1 (12.3, 
13.9) years, respectively, for women with diabetes. The estimated loss of LE 
associated with diabetes at age 50 years was 3.2 (3.0, 3.4) years for men and 
3.1 (2.9, 3.4) years for women, as compared with their counterparts without 
diabetes. The corresponding estimated loss of DFLE was 8.2 (6.7, 9.7) years for 
men and 9.1 (7.9, 10.4) years for women. Women with diabetes spent a greater 
number of absolute years and a greater proportion of their life with disability 
as compared with men with diabetes and women without diabetes. The gains in LE 
and DFLE across the whole population at age 50 years after hypothetically 
eliminating diagnosed diabetes were 0.6 (0.5, 0.6) years and 1.8 (1.0, 2.8) 
years.
CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: In adults, diabetes results in a modest reduction in 
LE and a substantial reduction in DFLE. Efforts to identify the specific causes 
of disability and effective interventions are needed.

Hypopituitarism reduces life expectancy and increases the risk of cardiovascular 
and cerebrovascular diseases, as well as death. Abnormalities in the 
cardiovascular system may be independently related to GH deficiency (GHD). The 
aim of this study was to prospectively investigate coronary flow reserve and 
diastolic function in GHD adult patients at diagnosis and after 1 year of GH 
replacement therapy. As control group, an age- and sex-matched population was 
chosen. All patients and controls were non-smokers, non-diabetic, and 
normotensive, with no history of vascular disease. 14 patients with adult-onset 
GHD and 17 controls represent the two study groups. Anthropometric data, blood 
pressure, lipid profile, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and IGF-I plasma 
levels, coronary flow reserve (CFR), and LV diastolic function (evaluated by 
E/A) were collected in all subjects before and after 12 months of GH replacement 
therapy. Compared with controls, systolic and diastolic blood pressure and LDL 
cholesterol levels were significantly higher at baseline and return, comparable 
to controls after 1 year of GH replacement (GHRT). GHD patients showed a blunted 
CFR at baseline (P < 0.001) and a significant improvement after GHRT, returning 
to values comparable with those recorded in the control group. In addition, 
after therapy a significant (P < 0.001) improvement in E/A was recorded. One 
year of GH therapy improves CFR and E/A in the patient population analyzed, 
thereby encouraging the early start of GHRT.

BACKGROUND: little is known about the oldest-olds' views on ageing.
OBJECTIVE: to investigate older people's desire and the reasons they give for 
wanting to live to 100.
DESIGN: a postal questionnaire, analysed both quantitatively and qualitatively.
SETTING: population based in Helsinki, Finland.
SUBJECTS: a random sample (response rate 64%; N = 1,405) of community-dwelling 
older people (aged 75-96).
METHODS: a structured self-completed questionnaire with an open-ended question 
on the reasons why/why not participants wished/did not wish to live to 100.
RESULTS: one-third (32.9%) of home-dwelling older people wanted to live to be 
100. Those who did were older, more often male and self-rated their health 
better than those who did not. Often the desire for long life was conditional: 
'Yes, if I stay healthy'. Among the reasons is that many were curious to see 
what would happen. Many stated that they loved life, they had twinkle in their 
eye or significant life roles. Those who did not want to live extremely long 
lives gave various rationales: they would become disabled, life would be 
meaningless, they were reluctant to become a burden to others or they feared 
loss of autonomy or suffering pain or loneliness. Some people also shared the 
view that they should not intervene in destiny or they felt that they had 
accomplished what they wanted in life.
CONCLUSIONS: one-third of the oldest-old participants wanted to live to 100. 
Identifying what motivated them to desire long life could be a resource in their 
care plans.

Bronchiectasis and asthma are common respiratory diseases worldwide. However, 
the influence of asthma on bronchiectasis remains unclear. The objective of this 
study is to analyse the effects of asthma on bronchiectasis exacerbation.Data 
from inpatients diagnosed with bronchiectasis with or without asthma at Shanghai 
Pulmonary Hospital (Shanghai, China) between January 2013 and December 2014 were 
retrospectively collected and analysed. 249 patients with only bronchiectasis 
and 214 patients with both bronchiectasis and asthma were included in the study. 
Follow-up records were used to evaluate the effect of asthma on bronchiectasis 
exacerbation.The variables found to be independently associated with 
bronchiectasis exacerbations were age (OR 1.07, 95% CI 1.03-1.11; p<0.001), 
duration of symptoms (OR 1.06, 95% CI 1.03-1.09; p<0.001), the presence of 
asthma (OR 2.6, 95% CI 1.15-5.88; p=0.021), forced expiratory volume in 1 s <50% 
predicted (OR 4.03, 95% CI 1.75-9.26; p=0.001), isolation of Pseudomonas 
aeruginosa in sputum (OR 2.41, 95% CI 1.00-5.79; p=0.05) and lung lesion 
extension to more than two lobes (OR 2.73, 95% CI 1.16-6.45; p=0.022).The 
existence of asthma was associated with an independent increase in risk of 
bronchiectasis exacerbation.

OBJECTIVE: To review functional outcomes of arthroscopic elbow synovectomy in 
patients with rheumatoid arthritis.
METHODS: Between May 1999 and December 2005, 15 patients were submitted to elbow 
synovectomy using an arthroscopic approach. Three cases were bilateral, totaling 
18 elbows. There were two male and 13 female patients. The mean age was 44 years 
and five months. The mean time of previous diagnosis was six years and eight 
months. All patients reported preoperative pain, and on seven elbows, 
instability was present. The mean preoperative values for joint motion were: 
flexion, 118°; extension, -24°, supine, 80°, and; prone, 71°.
RESULT: The mean postoperative follow-up time was 39 months. The mean 
postoperative joint motion was 133° for flexion, -20° for extension, 84° supine, 
and 78° prone. On nine elbows (50%) an improved postoperative range of motion 
was reported, reaching functional levels. Twelve cases (66.6%) showed pain 
resolution or improvement to a level not interfering on the activities of daily 
life. According to Bruce's assessment method, the results were as follows: seven 
excellent, three good, two fair and six poor results, with an average of 85.5 
points. Synovitis recurrence was found in six cases (33.3%), and evolution to 
osteoarthrosis was found in four (22.2%).
CONCLUSION: Arthroscopic elbow synovectomy in patients with rheumatoid arthritis 
leads to pain improvement in 66.6% of the cases; however, it does not cause a 
significant range of motion improvement.

OBJECTIVES: To examine changes over 40 years (1970-2010) in life expectancy, 
life expectancy with disability, and disability-free life expectancy for 
American men and women of all ages.
METHODS: We used mortality rates from US Vital Statistics and data on disability 
prevalence in the community-dwelling population from the National Health 
Interview Survey; for the institutional population, we computed disability 
prevalence from the US Census. We used the Sullivan method to estimate disabled 
and disability-free life expectancy for 1970, 1980, 1990, 2000, and 2010.
RESULTS: Over the 40 years, there was a steady increase in both disability-free 
life expectancy and disabled life expectancy. At birth, increases in disabled 
life and nondisabled life were equal for men (4.5 years); for women, at birth 
the increase in life with disability (3.6 years) exceeded the increase in life 
free of disability (2.7 years). At age 65 years, the increase in disability-free 
life was greater than the increase in disabled life.
CONCLUSIONS: Across the life cycle, there was no compression of morbidity, but 
at age 65 years some compression occurred.

OBJECTIVES: Ischemic heart disease (IHD) is a large public health problem and is 
associated with a number of modifiable risk factors. The aim of this study was 
to estimate the IHD burden and attributable to risk factors in Fujian, China 
during 1990 to 2013.
METHODS: IHD deaths, disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and attributable to 
risk factors were estimated as part of the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2013 
Study. Statistical models were employed to produce comprehensive results of IHD 
deaths, DALYs and attributable to risk. Means and 95% uncertainty intervals 
(UIs) were calculated for mortality and DALYs. The median of the percent change 
and 95% UI were determined for the period between 1990 and 2013.
RESULTS: The age-standardized IHD deaths rate increased by 15.3% from 1990 [74.7 
(95% UI 62.9-99.1) per 100,000] to 2013 [82.7 (56.5-95.5) per 100,000]. The 
age-standardized IHD DALYs has slightly decreased 8.8% from 1990 to 2013[from 
1356.2 (1134.3-1732.1) to 1202.7 (879.6-1404.6) per 100,000]. All risks combined 
account for 94.7% (92.9%- 96.0%) of IHD DALYs for all ages in 2013. The five 
leading risk factors for all ages IHD DALYs were high systolic blood pressure, 
high total cholesterol, smoking, diet high in sodium, and high fasting plasma 
glucose.
CONCLUSION: Despite decreased age-standardized IHD deaths and DALY rate since 
1990, population growth and aging led to a higher global burden of IHD in 2013. 
Behavioral, environmental, and metabolic risks can explain most of the IHD DALYs 
providing many opportunities for prevention.

Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (pNETs) are usually well-to-moderately 
differentiated neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) that most often metastasize to the 
liver and lymph nodes with other locations being uncommon. We present a case of 
intradural pNET metastasis and conduct a review of the literature. Forty-five 
cases, including the case presently reported, of spinal cord compression due to 
well-differentiated NETs were found: carcinoid (80%), pNET (13.3%), and NETs of 
unknown primary (6.7%). Seventy-eight percent of cases consisted of extradural 
compressions from vertebral bone metastases, whereas there were only 5 cases of 
intradural extramedullary spinal cord compression. Most cases were managed with 
surgery and/or radiotherapy with a good clinical outcome in the majority. We 
report the first case of a pNET intradural extramedullary metastasis and conduct 
the largest review to date of an infrequent complication of well-differentiated 
NETs such as malignant spinal cord compression. Aggressive local treatment is 
warranted in most cases because it usually achieves neurologic improvement and 
symptomatic relief in patients who may still have a long life expectancy.

Severity of resting functional impairment only partially predicts the increased 
risk of death in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Increased 
ventilation during exercise is associated with markers of disease progression 
and poor prognosis, including emphysema extension and pulmonary vascular 
impairment. Whether excess exercise ventilation would add to resting lung 
function in predicting mortality in COPD, however, is currently unknown. After 
an incremental cardiopulmonary exercise test, 288 patients (forced expiratory 
volume in one second ranging from 18% to 148% predicted) were followed for a 
median (interquartile range) of 57 (47) months. Increases in the lowest (nadir) 
ventilation to CO2 output (VCO2) ratio determined excess exercise ventilation. 
Seventy-seven patients (26.7%) died during follow-up: 30/77 (38.9%) deaths were 
due to respiratory causes. Deceased patients were older, leaner, had a greater 
co-morbidity burden (Charlson Index) and reported more daily life dyspnea. 
Moreover, they had poorer lung function and exercise tolerance (p < 0.05). A 
logistic regression analysis revealed that ventilation/VCO2 nadir was the only 
exercise variable that added to age, body mass index, Charlson Index and resting 
inspiratory capacity (IC)/total lung capacity (TLC) ratio to predict all-cause 
and respiratory mortality (p < 0.001). Kaplan-Meier analyses showed that 
survival time was particularly reduced when ventilation/VCO2 nadir > 34 was 
associated with IC/TLC ≤ 0.34 or IC/TLC ≤ 0.31 for all-cause and respiratory 
mortality, respectively (p < 0.001). Excess exercise ventilation is an 
independent prognostic marker across the spectrum of COPD severity. 
Physiological abnormalities beyond traditional airway dysfunction and lung 
mechanics are relevant in determining the course of the disease.

BACKGROUND: Palliative sedation (pS) is indicated in the presence of end-stage 
disease with treatment-refractory symptoms not tolerable for the patient. We 
investigated the practice of pS at a university palliative care unit.
METHODS: Before starting pS the following data were documented: indication and 
decision making, type of sedation, life expectancy evaluated by the physician 
using the palliative prognostic index. Over the time of pS communication skills, 
depth of sedation, relief in symptoms, substitution of fluid and nutrition and 
used medications were collected.
RESULTS: During evaluation time 99 patients died. 34 patients received pS (34 
%). All patients suffered from cancer. Indications for palliative sedation were: 
terminal restlessness (56 %), dyspnea (39 %), pain (32 %), psychological 
distress (15 %), agitated delir (9 %), vomiting (3 %) and bleeding (3 %) 
(multiple nominations possible). In 31 cases (91 %) nurses were included for 
decision making. In 33 cases continuous sedation were initiated immediately 
(median duration 27.5 hours). The most applied medication was midazolam (94 %), 
sometimes combined with neuroleptics (44 %) and propofol (15 %). 91 % of the 
patients additionally received opioids. Artificial fluid was substituted in two 
cases. Palliative sedation started in the median 27.5 hours before death. The 
final physician assessment revealed complete symptom relief in 12 patients (35 
%), very strong symptom relief in 20 patients (59 %) and moderate symptom relief 
in 2 patients (6 %).
CONCLUSIONS: pS was successfully used as last resort for relief of 
treatment-refractory symptoms in one third of decedents at the investigated 
palliative care unit.

OBJECTIVE: To determine if the 10-year rule should apply to men with high-grade, 
clincially localized prostate cancer, we characterized the survival benefits of 
aggressive (surgery, radiation, brachytherapy) over nonaggressive treatment 
(watchful waiting, active surveillance) among older men with differing 
comorbidity at diagnosis.
METHODS: We sampled 44,521 men older than 65 with cT1-2, poorly differentiated 
prostate cancer diagnosed in 1991-2007 from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and 
End Results-Medicare database. We used propensity-adjusted, competing-risks 
regression to calculate 5- and 10-year cancer mortality among those treated 
aggressively and nonaggressively across comorbidity subgroups. We determined 5- 
and 10-year absolute risk reduction in cancer mortality and numbers needed to 
treat to prevent one cancer death at 10 years.
RESULTS: In propensity-adjusted, competing-risks regression analysis, aggressive 
treatment was associated with significantly lower risk of cancer mortality for 
those with Charlson scores of 0 (sub-hazard ratio (SHR) 0.43, 95% confidence 
interval [CI] 0.39-0.47), 1 (SHR 0.48, 95% CI 0.40-0.58), and 2 (SHR 0.46, 95% 
CI 0.34-0.62) but not 3+ (SHR 0.68, 95% CI 0.44-1.07). Absolute reductions in 
cancer mortality between those treated aggressively and nonaggressively were 7%, 
5.5%, 6.9%, and 2.5% at 5 years, and 11.3%, 7.9%, 8.6%, and 2.8% at 10 years for 
men with Charlson scores of 0, 1, 2, and 3+ , respectively; numbers needed to 
treat to prevent 1 cancer death at 10 years were 9, 13, 12, and 36 men.
CONCLUSION: The 10-year rule may not apply to men with high-grade, clinically 
localized disease. Older men with Charlson scores ≤2 should consider aggressive 
treatment of such disease due to its substantial short-term cancer survival 
benefits.

There is growing interest for economic evaluation in oncology to illustrate the 
value of multiple new diagnostic and therapeutic interventions. As these 
analyses have started to move from specialist publications into mainstream 
medical literature, the wider medical audience consuming this information may 
need additional education to evaluate it appropriately. Here we review standard 
practices in economic evaluation, illustrating the different methods with 
thoracic oncology examples where possible. When interpreting and conducting 
health economic studies, it is important to appraise the method, perspective, 
time horizon, modeling technique, discount rate, and sensitivity analysis. 
Guidance on how to do this is provided. To provide a method to evaluate this 
literature, a literature search was conducted in spring 2015 to identify 
economic evaluations published in the Journal of Thoracic Oncology. Articles 
were reviewed for their study design, and areas for improvement were noted. 
Suggested improvements include using more rigorous sensitivity 
analyses, adopting a standard approach to reporting results, and conducting 
complete economic evaluations. Researchers should design high-quality studies to 
ensure the validity of the results, and consumers of this research should 
interpret these studies critically on the basis of a full understanding of the 
methodologies used before considering any of the conclusions. As advancements 
occur on both the research and consumer sides, this literature can be further 
developed to promote the best use of resources for this field.

Knowledge Gaps in Cardiovascular Care of the Older Adult Population: A 
Scientific Statement From the American Heart Association, American College of 
Cardiology, and American Geriatrics Society.

Rich MW, Chyun DA, Skolnick AH, Alexander KP, Forman DE, Kitzman DW, Maurer MS, 
McClurken JB, Resnick BM, Shen WK, Tirschwell DL; American Heart Association 
Older Populations Committee of the Council on Clinical Cardiology, Council on 
Cardiovascular and Stroke Nursing, Council on Cardiovascular Surgery and 
Anesthesia, and Stroke Council; American College of Cardiology; and American 
Geriatrics Society.

The incidence and prevalence of most cardiovascular disorders increase with age, 
and cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death and major disability in 
adults ≥75 years of age; however, despite the large impact of cardiovascular 
disease on quality of life, morbidity, and mortality in older adults, patients 
aged ≥75 years have been markedly underrepresented in most major cardiovascular 
trials, and virtually all trials have excluded older patients with complex 
comorbidities, significant physical or cognitive disabilities, frailty, or 
residence in a nursing home or assisted living facility. As a result, current 
guidelines are unable to provide evidence-based recommendations for diagnosis 
and treatment of older patients typical of those encountered in routine clinical 
practice. The objectives of this scientific statement are to summarize current 
guideline recommendations as they apply to older adults, identify critical gaps 
in knowledge that preclude informed evidence-based decision making, and 
recommend future research to close existing knowledge gaps. To achieve these 
objectives, we conducted a detailed review of current American College of 
Cardiology/American Heart Association and American Stroke Association guidelines 
to identify content and recommendations that explicitly targeted older patients. 
We found that there is a pervasive lack of evidence to guide clinical decision 
making in older patients with cardiovascular disease, as well as a paucity of 
data on the impact of diagnostic and therapeutic interventions on key outcomes 
that are particularly important to older patients, such as quality of life, 
physical function, and maintenance of independence. Accordingly, there is a 
critical need for a multitude of large population-based studies and clinical 
trials that include a broad spectrum of older patients representative of those 
seen in clinical practice and that incorporate relevant outcomes important to 
older patients in the study design. The results of these studies will provide 
the foundation for future evidence-based guidelines applicable to older 
patients, thereby enhancing patient-centered evidence-based care of older people 
with cardiovascular disease in the United States and around the world.

BACKGROUND: Adolescents in South Africa are at high risk of acquiring HIV. The 
HIV vaccination of adolescents could reduce HIV incidence and mortality. The 
potential impact and cost-effectiveness of a national school-based HIV 
vaccination program among adolescents was determined.
METHOD: The national HIV disease and cost burden was compared with 
(intervention) and without HIV vaccination (comparator) given to school-going 
adolescents using a semi-Markov model. Life table analysis was conducted to 
determine the impact of the intervention on life expectancy. Model inputs 
included measures of disease and cost burden and hypothetical assumptions of 
vaccine characteristics. The base-case HIV vaccine modelled cost at US$ 12 per 
dose; vaccine efficacy of 50 %; duration of protection of 10 years achieved at a 
coverage rate of 60 % and required annual boosters. Incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) were calculated using life years gained (LYG) 
serving as the outcome measure. Sensitivity analyses were conducted on the 
vaccine characteristics to assess parameter uncertainty.
RESULTS: The HIV vaccination model yielded an ICER of US$ 5 per LYG (95 % CI ZAR 
2.77-11.61) compared with the comparator, which is considerably less than the 
national willingness-to-pay threshold of cost-effectiveness. This translated to 
an 11 % increase in per capita costs from US$ 80 to US$ 89. National 
implementation of this intervention could potentially result in an estimated 
cumulative gain of 23.6 million years of life (95 % CI 8.48-34.3 million years) 
among adolescents age 10-19 years that were vaccinated. The 10 year absolute 
risk reduction projected by vaccine implementation was 0.42 % for HIV incidence 
and 0.41 % for HIV mortality, with an increase in life expectancy noted across 
all age groups. The ICER was sensitive to the vaccine efficacy, coverage and 
vaccine pricing in the sensitivity analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: A national HIV vaccination program would be cost-effective and 
would avert new HIV infections and decrease the mortality and morbidity 
associated with HIV disease. Decision makers would have to discern how these 
findings, derived from local data and reflective of the South African epidemic, 
can be integrated into the national long term health planning should a HIV 
vaccine become available.

BACKGROUND: Intradermal (ID) injection is an alternative route for influenza 
vaccine administration in elderly with potential improvement of vaccine 
coverage. This study aimed to investigate the cost-effectiveness of an influenza 
vaccination program offering ID vaccine to elderly who had declined 
intramuscular (IM) vaccine from the perspective of Hong Kong public healthcare 
provider.
METHODS: A decision analytic model was used to simulate outcomes of two 
programs: IM vaccine alone (IM program), and IM or ID vaccine (IM/ID program) in 
a hypothetic cohort of elderly aged 65 years. Outcome measures included 
influenza-related direct medical cost, infection rate, mortality rate, 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) loss, and incremental cost per QALY saved 
(ICER). Model inputs were derived from literature. Sensitivity analyses 
evaluated the impact of uncertainty of model variables.
RESULTS: In base-case analysis, the IM/ID program was more costly (USD52.82 
versus USD47.59 per individual to whom vaccine was offered) with lower influenza 
infection rate (8.71% versus 9.65%), mortality rate (0.021% versus 0.024%) and 
QALYs loss (0.00336 versus 0.00372) than the IM program. ICER of IM/ID program 
was USD14,528 per QALY saved. One-way sensitivity analysis found ICER of IM/ID 
program to exceed willingness-to-pay threshold (USD39,933) when probability of 
influenza infection in unvaccinated elderly decreased from 10.6% to 5.4%. In 
10,000 Monte Carlo simulations of elderly populations of Hong Kong, the IM/ID 
program was the preferred option in 94.7% of time.
CONCLUSIONS: An influenza vaccination program offering ID vaccine to elderly who 
had declined IM vaccine appears to be a highly cost-effective option.

AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To examine the cost-effectiveness of semi-rigid ankle brace 
to facilitate return to work following first-time acute ankle sprains.
DESIGN: Economic evaluation based on cost-utility analysis.
BACKGROUND: Ankle sprains are a source of morbidity and absenteeism from work, 
accounting for 15-20% of all sports injuries. Semi-rigid ankle brace and taping 
are functional treatment interventions used by Musculoskeletal Physiotherapists 
and Nurses to facilitate return to work following acute ankle sprains.
METHODS: A decision model analysis, based on cost-utility analysis from the 
perspective of National Health Service was used. The primary outcomes measure 
was incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, based on quality-adjusted life years. 
Costs and quality of life data were derived from published literature, while 
model clinical probabilities were sourced from Musculoskeletal Physiotherapists.
RESULTS: The cost and quality adjusted life years gained using semi-rigid ankle 
brace was £184 and 0.72 respectively. However, the cost and quality adjusted 
life years gained following taping was £155 and 0.61 respectively. The 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for the semi-rigid brace was £263 per 
quality adjusted life year. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that ankle 
brace provided the highest net-benefit, hence the preferred option.
CONCLUSION: Taping is a cheaper intervention compared with ankle brace to 
facilitate return to work following first-time ankle sprains. However, the 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio observed for ankle brace was less than the 
National Institute for Health and Care Excellence threshold and the intervention 
had a higher net-benefit, suggesting that it is a cost-effective intervention. 
Decision-makers may be willing to pay £263 for an additional gain in quality 
adjusted life year.
RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: The findings of this economic evaluation provide 
justification for the use of semi-rigid ankle brace by Musculoskeletal 
Physiotherapists and Nurses to facilitate return to work in individuals with 
first-time ankle sprains.

The cost-effectiveness of delayed-release dimethyl fumarate for the treatment of 
relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis in Canada.

BACKGROUND: Multiple sclerosis (MS) causes significant disability and diminished 
quality-of-life. Delayed-release dimethyl fumarate (DMF; also known as 
gastro-resistant DMF) is a new oral treatment for relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) 
approved in the US, Australia, Canada, and Europe.
OBJECTIVES: A cost-effectiveness model was developed to compare the health 
economic impact of DMF against other disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) as 
first-line RRMS treatment from a Canadian Ministry of Health perspective.
METHODS: A Markov cohort model was developed to simulate patients' progression 
through health states based on the Kurtzke Expanded Disability Status Scale 
(EDSS) over a life-time horizon. Patients entered the model based on a 
distribution of baseline EDSS scores, from which they could progress to higher 
or regress to lower EDSS state, or remain in the same state. Relapses could 
occur at any EDSS score. Results from a mixed-treatment comparison were used to 
inform model inputs for disease progression and relapse rates per treatment. 
Costs included direct medical costs stratified by EDSS score. Utilities were 
accrued based on time spent in each EDSS state.
RESULTS: Compared with glatiramer acetate, DMF yielded 0.528 incremental 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) at an incremental cost of $23 338 Canadian 
dollars (CAD), resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of 
CAD $44 118/QALY. The ICER for DMF compared with Rebif 44 mcg was CAD $10 672. 
Results were consistent across a wide range of one-way and probabilistic 
sensitivity analyses.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on traditional cost-effectiveness thresholds in Canada (CAD 
$50 000-60 000), DMF can be considered a cost-effective option compared to other 
first-line DMTs.

Several tests exist for diagnosing coronary artery disease, with varying 
accuracy and cost. We sought to provide cost-effectiveness information to aid 
physicians and decision-makers in selecting the most appropriate testing 
strategy. We used the state-transitions (Markov) model from the Brazilian public 
health system perspective with a lifetime horizon. Diagnostic strategies were 
based on exercise electrocardiography (Ex-ECG), stress echocardiography (ECHO), 
single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), computed tomography coronary 
angiography (CTA), or stress cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (C-MRI) as the 
initial test. Systematic review provided input data for test accuracy and 
long-term prognosis. Cost data were derived from the Brazilian public health 
system. Diagnostic test strategy had a small but measurable impact in 
quality-adjusted life-years gained. Switching from Ex-ECG to CTA-based 
strategies improved outcomes at an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 3100 
international dollars per quality-adjusted life-year. ECHO-based strategies 
resulted in cost and effectiveness almost identical to CTA, and SPECT-based 
strategies were dominated because of their much higher cost. Strategies based on 
stress C-MRI were most effective, but the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
vs CTA was higher than the proposed willingness-to-pay threshold. Invasive 
strategies were dominant in the high pretest probability setting. Sensitivity 
analysis showed that results were sensitive to costs of CTA, ECHO, and C-MRI. 
Coronary CT is cost-effective for the diagnosis of coronary artery disease and 
should be included in the Brazilian public health system. Stress ECHO has a 
similar performance and is an acceptable alternative for most patients, but 
invasive strategies should be reserved for patients at high risk.

INTRODUCTION: Long-term exposure to calcineurin inhibitor-based 
immunosuppressant (IS) therapy in liver transplant (LT) recipients is associated 
with renal complications. In the randomized trial H2304, 
everolimus + reduced-dose tacrolimus (EVR + rTAC) demonstrated equivalent 
efficacy and superior renal function compared to standard-dose tacrolimus.
METHODS: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of EVR + rTAC vs TAC, in de novo LT 
patients, a Markov model simulating both liver and kidney function was developed 
and estimated the long-term outcomes of IS following LT. The analysis used the 
Italian healthcare payer perspective.
RESULTS: Patients treated with EVR + rTAC gained on average 1.92 years and 1.62 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios 
(ICER) were €35,851 and €42,567 for LY gained and QALY gained, respectively. For 
the hepatitis-c sub-population, the ICERs decreased to €22,519 and €30,658, 
respectively.
CONCLUSION: EVR + rTAC improves survival and quality-of-life and is a 
cost-effective alternative to calcineurin-inhibitor monotherapy for patients 
requiring LT.

We Offer Renal Replacement Therapy to Patients Who Are Not Benefitted by It.

Holley JL(1).

Author information:
(1)Urbana-Champaign and Carle Physician Group, Department of Medicine, 
University of Illinois, Urbana, Illinois.

Nephrologists offer renal replacement therapy (RRT) to patients who are unlikely 
to benefit in part because of our discomfort discussing goals of care in the 
setting of an uncertain prognosis for a given individual. Permanent neurological 
impairment, terminal illness (life expectancy <6 months), medical conditions 
precluding the safe delivery of dialysis, elderly patients with poor prognosis, 
and those who begin "early" RRT are categories of patients for whom dialysis may 
not be beneficial. Successful use of time-limited trials of dialysis may reduce 
the number of patients who are started on RRT without significant benefit. 
However, clear achievable milestones and goals need to be incorporated into 
plans for time-limited trials to ensure that continuing RRT beyond the trial 
period is appropriate. The lack of information on outcomes and symptom 
management using a "palliative approach" to dialysis suggests this should not be 
a clinical option until additional study is done and efficacy data available. 
Clinical practice guidelines are available to assist nephrologists in the
