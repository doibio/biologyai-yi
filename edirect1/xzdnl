postmenopausal osteoporosis in Taiwan, using real-world fracture reduction 
effectiveness and cost data. Outcomes indicate that continued denosumab 
treatment produces an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of USD $16,743 per 
QALY.
PURPOSE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of continued denosumab use versus 
discontinuation after one dose, for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis 
in Taiwan, using real-world fracture reduction effectiveness and cost data.
METHODS: A Markov cohort model was used to evaluate the lifetime costs and QALYs 
associated with continued denosumab treatment versus discontinuation of 
treatment after one dose. The evaluation was conducted from the perspective of 
Taiwan's healthcare system and used a discount rate of 3% per annum. The patient 
population consisted of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis with a mean age 
of 77 years who initiated denosumab treatment. Fracture reduction effectiveness 
data, baseline fracture rates, mortality data, and costs of fracture were 
informed by Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database.
RESULTS: Model outcomes showed that continued treatment with denosumab produced 
an expected gain of 0.042 QALYs and an incremental cost of USD $704, compared 
with discontinuation of denosumab after one dose. This corresponds to an 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of USD $16,743 per QALY gained. 
Probabilistic and scenario analysis showed that results are stable to variations 
in model assumptions and parameters.
CONCLUSION: In a real-world setting, at a cost per QALY threshold equivalent to 
gross domestic product per capita in 2020 in Taiwan (USD $30,038), continued 
treatment with denosumab in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis is 
cost-effective compared with treatment discontinuation.

BACKGROUND: Randomized controlled trials evaluating acute sciatica have not 
demonstrated prolonged improvements in terms of patient-reported pain and 
function. For chronic sciatica, however, microdiscectomy has been found to be 
superior at 1 year. Whether this effect persists during the second year is not 
known. The purpose of the present study was to report the 2-year outcomes 
following lumbar microdiscectomy as compared with standardized nonoperative care 
for the treatment of chronic sciatica resulting from a lumbar disc herniation.
METHODS: The present study is a secondary analysis of a previously reported 
randomized controlled trial with extension to 2 years of follow-up. Patients 
with radiculopathy for 4 to 12 months resulting from an L4-L5 or L5-S1 disc 
herniation were randomized to microdiscectomy or 6 months of nonoperative care 
followed by surgery if needed. Intention-to-treat analysis was performed at 2 
years for the primary outcome (the intensity of leg pain) (range of possible 
scores, 0 [no pain] to 10 [worst pain]) as well as for secondary outcomes 
(including the Oswestry Disability Index score, the intensity of back pain, and 
quality of life).
RESULTS: One hundred and twenty-eight patients were randomized in the present 
study. Twenty-four (38%) of the 64 patients who had been randomized to 
nonoperative care crossed over to surgical treatment by 2 years following 
enrollment. At the 2-year time point, the follow-up rate was approximately 70%. 
At 2 years, the operative group had less leg pain than the nonoperative group 
(mean, 2.8 ± 0.4 compared with 4.2 ± 0.4; treatment effect, 1.3 [95% confidence 
interval, 0.3 to 2.4]). The treatment effect favored surgery for all secondary 
outcome measures at 6 months and 1 year and for back pain intensity and physical 
function at 2 years.
CONCLUSIONS: At 2 years, the present study showed that microdiscectomy was 
superior to nonoperative care for the treatment of chronic sciatica resulting 
from an L4-L5 or L5-S1 disc herniation. However, the difference between the 
groups did not surpass the minimal clinically important difference at 2 years as 
was reached at earlier follow-up points, likely as the result of patients 
crossing over from nonoperative to operative treatment.

Cost-effectiveness analysis is a way to understand the value of a health care 
intervention in terms of assessing the money spent to produce beneficial 
outcomes. Cost-effectiveness analyses are used by various stakeholders for such 
purposes because health care resources and financing may be scarce, depending on 
the economy, and certain interventions may be costly to produce such outcomes 
compared with other options. These analyses are built on well-researched and 
robust inputs for costs and outcomes and may be modeled using a technique called 
Markov chain models, which allow transitions among various health states (eg, 
alive, dead, outgrow allergy, allergy relapses) relative to the condition of 
interest to reflect a base-case scenario. Then, the margins of the inputs are 
explored for a sensitivity analysis of potential findings. These analyses should 
be investigated from multiple perspectives (eg, society, health care payer). 
Limitations of the analysis should be clearly stated. Although such models are 
an informative way to explore a situation and can be performed without 
additional direct patient intervention, a weakness of the approach is that this 
may overlook individual patient nuances. Cost-effectiveness analyses are 
important policy tools to show, on average, an optimal way to improve value in 
population health.

Despite continued increases in human life expectancy, the factors determining 
the rate of human biological aging remain unknown. Without understanding the 
molecular mechanisms underlying aging, efforts to prevent aging are unlikely to 
succeed. The tumor suppression theory of aging introduced here proposes somatic 
mutation as the proximal cause of aging, but postulates that oncogenic 
transformation and clonal expansion, not functional impairment, are the relevant 
consequences of somatic mutation. Obesity and caloric restriction accelerate and 
decelerate aging due to their effect on cell proliferation, during which most 
mutations arise. Most phenotypes of aging are merely tumor-suppressive 
mechanisms that evolved to limit malignant growth, the dominant age-related 
cause of death in early and middle life. Cancer limits life span for most 
long-lived mammals, a phenomenon known as Peto's paradox. Its conservation 
across species demonstrates that mutation is a fundamental but hard limit on 
mammalian longevity. Cell senescence and apoptosis and differentiation induced 
by oncogenes, telomere shortening or DNA damage evolved as a second line of 
defense to limit the tumorigenic potential of clonally expanding cells, but 
accumulating senescent cells, senescence-associated secretory phenotypes and 
stem cell exhaustion eventually cause tissue dysfunction and the majority, if 
not most, phenotypes of aging.

Senescent cells play an important role in mammalian ageing and in the etiology 
of age-related diseases. Treatment of mice with senolytics - drugs that 
selectively remove senescent cells - causes an extension of median lifespan but 
has little effect on maximum lifespan. Postponement of some mortality to later 
ages, without a corresponding increase in maximum mortality, can be termed 
'compression of mortality'. When we fit the standard Gompertz mortality model to 
the survival data following senolytic treatment, we find an increase in the 
slope parameter, commonly described as the 'actuarial ageing rate'. These 
observations raise important questions about the actions of senolytic treatments 
and their effects on health and survival, which are not yet sufficiently 
understood. To explore how the survival data from senolytics experiments might 
be explained, we combine a recent exploration of the evolutionary basis of 
cellular senescence with theoretical consideration of the molecular processes 
that might be involved. We perform numerical simulations of senescent cell 
accumulation and senolytic treatment in an ageing population. The simulations 
suggest that while senolytics diminish the burden of senescent cells, they may 
also impair the general repair capacity of the organism, leading to a faster 
accumulation post-treatment of new senescent cells. Our results suggest a 
framework to address the benefits and possible side effects of senolytic 
therapies, with the potential to aid in the design of optimal treatment 
regimens.

Temporal Alignment but not Complexity of Audiovisual Stimuli Influences 
Crossmodal Duration Percepts.

Reliable duration perception is an integral aspect of daily life that impacts 
everyday perception, motor coordination, and subjective passage of time. The 
Scalar Expectancy Theory (SET) is a common model that explains how an internal 
pacemaker, gated by an external stimulus-driven switch, accumulates pulses 
during sensory events and compares these accumulated pulses to a reference 
memory duration for subsequent duration estimation. Second-order mechanisms, 
such as multisensory integration (MSI) and attention, can influence this model 
and affect duration perception. For instance, diverting attention away from 
temporal features could delay the switch closure or temporarily open the 
accumulator, altering pulse accumulation and distorting duration perception. In 
crossmodal duration perception, auditory signals of unequal duration can induce 
perceptual compression and expansion of durations of visual stimuli, presumably 
via auditory influence on the visual clock. The current project aimed to 
investigate the role of temporal (stimulus alignment) and nontemporal (stimulus 
complexity) features on crossmodal, specifically auditory over visual, duration 
perception. While temporal alignment revealed a larger impact on the strength of 
crossmodal duration percepts compared to stimulus complexity, both features 
showcase auditory dominance in processing visual duration.

Immunoproteasome is a noncanonical form of proteasome with enzymological 
properties optimized for the generation of antigenic peptides presented in 
complex with class I MHC molecules. This enzymatic property makes the modulation 
of its activity a promising area of research. Nevertheless, immunotherapy has 
emerged as a front-line treatment of advanced/metastatic tumors providing 
outstanding improvement of life expectancy, even though not all patients achieve 
a long-lasting clinical benefit. To enhance the efficacy of the currently 
available immunotherapies and enable the development of new strategies, a 
broader knowledge of the dynamics of antigen repertoire processing by cancer 
cells is needed. Therefore, a better understanding of the role of 
immunoproteasome in antigen processing and of the therapeutic implication of its 
modulation is mandatory. Studies on the potential crosstalk between proteasome 
modulators and immune checkpoint inhibitors could provide novel perspectives and 
an unexplored treatment option for a variety of cancers.

Proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR), neovascular age-related macular 
degeneration (nvAMD), retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) and other eye diseases 
are characterized by retinal and/or choroidal neovascularization, ultimately 
causing vision loss in millions of people worldwide. nvAMD and PDR are 
associated with aging and the number of those affected is expected to increase 
as the global median age and life expectancy continue to rise. With this 
increase in prevalence, the development of novel, orally bioavailable therapies 
for neovascular eye diseases that target multiple pathways is critical, since 
current anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) treatments, delivered by 
intravitreal injection, are accompanied with tachyphylaxis, a high treatment 
burden and risk of complications. One potential target is apurinic/apyrimidinic 
endonuclease 1/reduction-oxidation factor 1 (APE1/Ref-1). The multifunctional 
protein APE1/Ref-1 may be targeted via inhibitors of its redox-regulating 
transcription factor activation activity to modulate angiogenesis, inflammation, 
oxidative stress response and cell cycle in neovascular eye disease; these 
inhibitors also have neuroprotective effects in other tissues. An APE1/Ref-1 
small molecule inhibitor is already in clinical trials for cancer, PDR and 
diabetic macular edema. Efforts to develop further inhibitors are underway. 
APE1/Ref-1 is a novel candidate for therapeutically targeting neovascular eye 
diseases and alleviating the burden associated with anti-VEGF intravitreal 
injections.

Neurotrophins (NTs) and their signal-transducing Trk receptors play a crucial 
role in the development and maintenance of specific neuronal subpopulations in 
nervous and sensory systems. NTs are supposed to regulate two sensory systems in 
fish, the inner ear and the lateral line system (LLS). The latter is one of the 
major mechanosensory systems in fish. Considering that annual fishes of the 
genus Nothobranchius, with their short life expectancy, have become a suitable 
model for aging studies and that the occurrence and distribution of neurotrophin 
Trk receptors have never been investigated in the inner ear and LLS of killifish 
(Nothobranchius guentheri), our study aimed to investigate the localization of 
neurotrophin-specific Trk receptors in mechanosensory systems of N. guentheri. 
For histological and immunohistochemical analysis, adult specimens of N. 
guentheri were processed using antibodies against Trk receptors and S100 
protein. An intense immunoreaction for TrkA and TrkC was found in the sensory 
cells of the inner ear as well as in the hair cells of LLS. Moreover, also the 
neurons localized in the acoustic ganglia displayed a specific immunoreaction 
for all Trk receptors (TrkA, B, and C) analyzed. Taken together, our results 
demonstrate, for the first time, that neurotrophins and their specific receptors 
could play a pivotal role in the biology of the sensory cells of the inner ear 
and LLS of N. guentheri and might also be involved in the hair cells 
regeneration process in normal and aged conditions.

Projected life expectancy continues to grow worldwide owing to the advancement 
of new treatments and technologies leading to rapid growth of geriatric 
population. Thus, age-associated diseases especially in the musculoskeletal 
system are becoming more common. Loss of bone (osteoporosis) and muscle 
(sarcopenia) mass are conditions whose prevalence is increasing because of the 
change in population distribution in the world towards an older mean age. The 
deterioration in the bone and muscle functions can cause severe disability and 
seriously affects the patients' quality of life. Currently, there is no 
treatment to prevent and reverse age-related musculoskeletal frailty. Existing 
interventions are mainly to slow down and control the signs and symptoms. 
Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) transplantation is a promising approach to attenuate 
age-related musculoskeletal frailty. This review compiles the present knowledge 
of the causes and changes of the musculoskeletal frailty and the potential of 
MSC transplantation as a regenerative therapy for age-related musculoskeletal 
frailty.

Various lifestyle behaviors have been known to affect health-related quality of 
life (HRQL) and life expectancy. However, the impact on quality-adjusted life 
years (QALYs), which can be used for health economics, has not been clarified. 
The purpose of this study was to estimate the impact of lifestyle behaviors on 
lifetime QALYs. We first examined the relationship between lifestyle behaviors 
and HRQL as measured by the EQ-5D-5L among 4000 participants via a web-based 
survey. The results of multiple regression analysis showed that physical 
activity and sleep were significantly related to HRQL. Therefore, we used 
microsimulation to estimate QALYs from physical activity and sleep, which were 
determined to be significant in the regression analysis. The results showed that 
there was a difference of 3.6 QALYs between the recommended lifestyle scenario 
(23.4 QALYs; 95%CI 3.6 to 35.1) and the non-recommended lifestyle scenario (19.8 
QALYs; 95%CI 3.1 to 31.6). This difference was greater in the younger age group 
than in the older age group. The results also indicated a large difference in 
QALYs between physical activity and sleep. These findings may provide a 
significant suggestion for future health promotion measures.

This is the first cost-effectiveness analysis of Chuna manual therapy (CMT) plus 
usual Korean traditional medicine for traffic accident victims using a 
randomized controlled trial. A total of 132 participants were equally allocated 
to the intervention group receiving 6-11 sessions of CMT plus usual Korean 
traditional medicine care for three weeks or usual care including acupuncture, 
cupping, herbal medicine, moxibustion, and traditional physiotherapy at three 
hospitals. At 12 weeks, from a healthcare perspective, the intervention group 
had significantly higher costs (mean (SD), $778 (435) vs. $618 (318); 
difference, $160; 95% CI, $15 to $289; p = 0.005). From a societal perspective, 
total costs were insignificantly lower in the intervention group (mean (SD), 
$1077 (1081) vs. $1146 (1485); difference, $-69; 95% CI, $-568 to $377; p = 
0.761). The intervention group dominated, with significantly higher QALYs gained 
at lower overall cost with a 72% chance of being cost-effective. From a societal 
perspective, the intervention was cost-saving for individuals who had neck pain 
after car accidents, although it was not cost-effective from the healthcare 
perspective ($40,038 per QALY gained). Findings support use of CMT as an 
integrated care treatment for whiplash from a societal perspective. Further 
studies with larger sample sizes are needed to determine cost-effectiveness in 
other cultural contexts.

Despite significant developments in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health 
information over the last 25 years, many challenges remain. There are still 
uncertainties about the accuracy of estimates of the summary measure of life 
expectancy, and methods to estimate changes in life expectancy over time are 
unreliable because of changing patterns of identification. Far too little use is 
made of the wealth of information that is available, and formal systems for 
systematically using that information are often vestigial to non-existent. 
Available information has focussed largely on traditional biomedical topics and 
too little on access to, expenditure on, and availability of services required 
to improve health outcomes, and on the underpinning issues of social and 
emotional wellbeing. It is of concern that statistical artefacts may have been 
misrepresented as indicating real progress in key health indices. Challenges and 
opportunities for the future include improving the accuracy of estimation of 
life expectancy, provision of community level data, information on the 
availability and effectiveness of health services, measurement of the 
underpinning issues of racism, culture and social and emotional wellbeing 
(SEWB), enhancing the interoperability of data systems, and capacity building 
and mechanisms for Indigenous data governance. There is little point in having 
information unless it is used, and formal mechanisms for making full use of 
information in a proper policy/planning cycle are urgently required.

The airframe structures of most fighter aircraft in the Royal Malaysian Airforce 
have been in service for 10 to 20 years. The effect of fatigue loading, 
operating conditions, and environmental degradation has led to the structural 
integrity of the airframe being assessed for its airworthiness. Various NDT 
methods were used to determine the current condition of the aircraft structure 
after operation of beyond 10 years, and their outcomes are summarized. In 
addition, although there are six critical locations, the wing root was chosen 
since it has the highest possibility of fatigue failure. It was further analyzed 
using simulation analysis for fatigue life. This contributes to the development 
of the maintenance task card and ultimately assists in extending the service 
life of the fighter aircraft. Using the concept of either safe life or damage 
tolerance as its fatigue design philosophy, the RMAF has adopted the Aircraft 
Structural Integrity Program (ASIP) to monitor the structural integrity of its 
fighter aircraft. With the current budget constraints and structural life 
extension requirements, the RMAF has embarked on the non-destructive testing 
method and engineering analysis. The research outcome will enhance the ASIP for 
other aircraft platforms in the RMAF fleet for its structure life assessment or 
service life extension program.

The demand for composite materials in high-voltage electrical insulation is 
escalating over the last decades. In the power system, the composite 
glass-fiber-reinforced polymer has been used as an alternative to wood and steel 
crossarm structures due to its superior properties. As a composite, the material 
is susceptible to multi-aging factors, one of which is the electrical stress 
caused by continuous and temporary overvoltage. In order to achieve a better 
insulation performance and higher life expectancy, the distribution of the 
stresses should firstly be studied and understood. This paper focuses on the 
simulation work to better understand the stress distribution of the polyurethane 
foam-filled glass-fiber-reinforced polymer crossarm due to the lightning 
transient injection. A finite-element-based simulation was carried out to 
investigate the behavior of the electric field and voltage distribution across 
the sample using an Ansys Maxwell 3D. Electrical stresses at both outer and 
inner surfaces of the crossarm during the peak of lightning were analyzed. 
Analyses on the electric field and potential distribution were performed at 
different parts of the crossarm and correlated to the physical characteristics 
and common discharge location observed during the experiment. The results of the 
electric field on the crossarm indicate that both the outer and internal parts 
of the crossarm were prone to high field stress.

Heart failure (HF) has been a hot topic in diabetology in the last few years, 
mainly due to the central role of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors 
(iSGLT2) in the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease and heart 
failure. It is well known that HF is a common complication in diabetes. However, 
most of the knowledge about it and the evidence of cardiovascular safety trials 
with antidiabetic drugs refer to type 2 diabetes (T2D). The epidemiology, 
etiology, and pathophysiology of HF in type 1 diabetes (T1D) is still not well 
studied, though there are emerging data about it since life expectancy for T1D 
has increased in the last decades and there are more elderly patients with T1D. 
The association of T1D and HF confers a worse prognosis than in T2D, thus it is 
important to investigate the characteristics, risk factors, and pathophysiology 
of this disease in order to effectively design prevention strategies and 
therapeutic tools.

Due to pathologies or age-related problems, in some disabled people, motor 
impairment is associated with cognitive and/or visual impairments. This 
combination of limitations unfortunately leads to an inability to move around 
independently. Indeed, their situation does not allow them to use a conventional 
electric wheelchair, for safety reasons, and for the moment there is no other 
technological solution providing safe movement capacity. This lack of access to 
an autonomous travel solution has the consequence of weakening the intellectual, 
personal, social, cultural and moral development, as well as the life 
expectancy, of the people concerned. In this context, our team is working on the 
development of an optoelectronic system that secures the displacement of 
electric wheelchairs. This is a large project that requires the development of 
several functionalities such as: the anti-collision of the wheelchair with its 
environment, the prevention of falls from the wheelchair on uneven levels, and 
the adaptation of the system mechanically and electronically to the majority of 
commercially available electric wheelchair models, among others. In this 
article, we introduce our solution for detecting dangerous height differences, 
also called "negative obstacles", through the creation of a dedicated sensor. 
This sensor works by optical triangulation and can embed several laser beams in 
order to extend its detection zone. It has the particularity of being robust in 
direct sunlight and rain and has a sufficiently high measurement rate to be 
suitable for the displacement of electric wheelchairs. We develop an adapted 
algorithm, and point out compromises, in particular between the orientation of 
the laser beams and the maximal speed of the wheelchair.

Global demand for minimally processed fruits and vegetables is increasing due to 
the tendency to acquire a healthy lifestyle. Losses of these foods during the 
chain supply reach as much as 30%; reducing them represents a challenge for the 
industry and scientific sectors. The use of edible packaging based on 
biopolymers is an alternative to mitigate the negative impact of conventional 
films and coatings on environmental and human health. Moreover, it has been 
demonstrated that natural coatings added with functional compounds reduce the 
post-harvest losses of fruits and vegetables without altering their sensorial 
and nutritive properties. Furthermore, the enhancement of their mechanical, 
structural, and barrier properties can be achieved through mixing two or more 
biopolymers to form composite coatings and adding plasticizers and/or 
cross-linking agents. This review shows the latest updates, tendencies, and 
challenges in the food industry to develop eco-friendly food packaging from 
diverse natural sources, added with bioactive compounds, and their effect on 
perishable foods. Moreover, the methods used in the food industry and the new 
techniques used to coat foods such as electrospinning and electrospraying are 
also discussed. Finally, the tendency and challenges in the development of 
edible films and coatings for fresh foods are reviewed.

The aim of extending shelf-life and maintaining quality is one of the major 
issues regarding mango fruit preservation. The quality of mango fruits is 
greatly affected by postharvest factors, especially temperature and fruit 
treatment. In this study, the effect of coating and storage temperature on the 
characteristics of mango fruits was investigated. The mango fruits were immersed 
in different concentrations (1.5%, 2.0%, and 2.5%) of pectin/nanochitosan 
dispersion (with ratios of pectin:nanochitosan 50:50), and (0.75%, 1% and 1.25%) 
of nanochitosan dispersion and stored at 17, 25, and 32 °C for 24 days. Changes 
in fruit, including weight loss, firmness, color, chemical composition (such as 
the total soluble solids concentration (TSS)), total sugar, reducing sugar, 
titratable acidity (TA), and vitamin C were periodically recorded. The results 
indicated that the pectin/nanochitosan coating significantly prevented 
reductions in the fruit weight, firmness, TSS, TA, and vitamin C content. 
Additionally, pectin/nanochitosan at a low temperature (17 °C) had a greater 
positive effect on fruit shelf-life and weight maintenance than 25 and 32 °C. 
The coated mango fruits maintained good quality for 24 days at 17 °C, while 
coated fruits stored at 25 °C and 32 °C, as well as uncoated ones stored at 17 
°C, were destroyed after two weeks. At the maximum storage time evaluated, the 
coating formulations containing pectin and nanochitosan exhibited microbial 
counts below the storage life limit of 106 CFU/g of fruit. In general, the 
results showed that the pectin/nanochitosan coating (2%) with a storage 
temperature of 17 °C is the most effective strategy for improving quality and 
extending the shelf-life of mango fruits.

Carbonic anhydrase (CA) is an ultrafast enzyme that catalyzes the reversible 
conversion of carbon dioxide (CO2) to bicarbonate. CA is considered to be a 
green catalyst for enzyme-based CO2 capture and utilization. In particular, the 
CA of Thermovibrio ammonificans (taCA) has attracted increasing attention as a 
highly stable enzyme. However, the poor solubility and the low expression level 
in Escherichia coli have hampered further utilization of taCA. In a recent 
study, these limitations were partly resolved by using a small 
solubility-enhancing fusion tag named NEXT, which originates from the N-terminal 
extension of Hydrogenovibrio marinus CA. In this study, the NEXT tag was 
engineered by adding small peptides to the N terminus to further increase the 
production yield of NEXT-tagged taCA. The addition of ng3 peptide (His-Gly-Asn) 
originating from the N-terminal sequence of Neisseria gonorrhoeae CA improved 
the expression of NEXT-taCA, while the previously developed 
translation-enhancing element (TEE) and Ser-Lys-Ile-Lys (SKIK) tag were not 
effective. The expression test with all 16 codon combinations for the ng3 
sequence revealed that the change in translation initiation rate brought about 
by the change in nucleotide sequence was not the primary determinant for the 
change in expression level. The modified ng3-NEXT tag may be applied to increase 
the production yields of various recombinant proteins.

The appearance of antibiotic drugs revolutionized the possibilities for 
treatment of diseases with high mortality such as pneumonia, sepsis, plaque, 
diphtheria, tetanus, typhoid fever, and tuberculosis. Today fewer than 1% of 
mortalities in high income countries are caused by diseases caused by bacteria. 
However, it should be recalled that the antibiotics were introduced in parallel 
with sanitation including sewerage, piped drinking water, high standard of 
living and improved understanding of the connection between food and health. 
Development of salvarsan, sulfonamides, and β-lactams into efficient drugs is 
described. The effects on life expectancy and life quality of these new drugs 
are indicated.

An animal's ability to recognize another individual by matching their image to 
their voice suggests they form internal representations of other individuals. To 
what extent this ability, termed cross-modal individual recognition, extends to 
birds other than corvids is unknown. Here, we used an expectancy violation 
paradigm to determine whether a monogamous territorial seabird (Spheniscus 
demersus) can cross-modally recognize familiar conspecifics (partners or 
colony-mates). After pairs of penguins spent time together in an isolated area, 
one of the penguins was released from the area leaving the focal penguin alone. 
Subsequently, we played contact calls of the released penguin (congruent 
condition) or a different penguin (incongruent condition). After being paired 
with a colony-mate, focal penguins' response latency to the auditory stimulus 
was faster in the incongruent compared to congruent condition, indicating the 
mismatch violated their expectations. This behavioural pattern was not observed 
in focal penguins after being paired with their partner. We discuss these 
different results in the light of penguins' natural behaviour and the evolution 
of social communication strategies. Our results suggest that cross-modal 
individual recognition extends to penguins and reveals, in contrast with 
previously thought, that social communication between members of this endangered 
species can also use visual cues.

BACKGROUND: The United Nations (UN) created the Multiple Indicator Cluster 
Surveys (MICS) to monitor progress toward achieving goals of the World 
Declaration on the Survival, Protection, and Development of Children and its 
plan of action. The MICS is nationally representative and internationally 
comparable.
METHODS: In this study, we use MICS data from 51 low- and middle-income 
countries on 159 959 children between 36 and 59 months of age. To index national 
development, we used the 2013 UN Human Development Index (HDI), which provides 
data on country-level life expectancy, education, and income. To index child 
development, we used the Early Childhood Development Index (ECDI), which 
assesses literacy and numeracy, socioemotional development, physical health, and 
approaches to learning.
RESULTS: Children's literacy and numeracy, socioemotional development, and 
approaches to learning all increase linearly as national development on the HDI 
(especially education) increases. Overall, the HDI revealed a positive 
association (r = 0.40) with the ECDI: the HDI explained 16% of variance in 
children's ECDI scores and was the most influential predictor of ECDI scores 
examined. HDI-ECDI relations are robust, even when we control for multiple 
demographic aspects of children (age, sex), mothers (age, education), and 
households (size variables) as covariates. No family demographic variable was a 
stronger predictor of child development than national development.
CONCLUSIONS: To promote child development, low- and middle-income countries need
