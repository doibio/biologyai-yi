free-swimming sperm decreased to 10%, and that of sperm bound to immobilized 
laminin decreased to about 50%, whereas viability of sperm bound to immobilized 
suLeA was highest throughout the incubation and 60% at 96 h. These results 
indicate that bovine sperm binding to oviduct suLeA retains sperm for reservoir 
formation and extends sperm lifespan.

Chromosome segregation typically occurs after replication has finished in 
eukaryotes but during replication in bacteria. Here, we show that the 
alphaproteobacterium Hyphomonas neptunium, which proliferates by bud formation 
at the tip of a stalk-like cellular extension, segregates its chromosomes in a 
unique two-step process. First, the two sister origin regions are targeted to 
opposite poles of the mother cell, driven by the ParABS partitioning system. 
Subsequently, once the bulk of chromosomal DNA has been replicated and the bud 
exceeds a certain threshold size, the cell initiates a second segregation step 
during which it transfers the stalk-proximal origin region through the stalk 
into the nascent bud compartment. Thus, while chromosome replication and 
segregation usually proceed concurrently in bacteria, the two processes are 
largely uncoupled in H. neptunium, reminiscent of eukaryotic mitosis. These 
results indicate that stalked budding bacteria have evolved specific mechanisms 
to adjust chromosome segregation to their unusual life cycle.

Physical and sexual abuse in childhood is a worldwide phenomenon with 
potentially dramatic consequences of both a psychological and physical nature. 
Measures of primary prevention have been developed in some countries. In the 
USA, child protection services reports and research surveys indicate that child 
sexual abuse has been on the decline in recent decades. Results are less clear 
for physical and overall abuse. The aim of this study was to describe how 
childhood abuse has changed over the years in Canada through an analysis of the 
2012 Canadian Community Health Survey: Mental Health Edition data. The sample 
comprised 22,775 respondents ages 20 and over who completed a child abuse 
questionnaire. Respondents born from 1983 to 1992 reported significantly less 
overall abuse, physical abuse, and sexual abuse than did older generations, with 
the exception of people born in 1942 or earlier. The decrease was observed among 
men and women and across all the regions of Canada.Conclusion: The results are 
encouraging in that they may have an impact on life expectancy, severity of 
various chronic disorders, and suicide in the population. They also support 
policies that have focused on improving the childhood environment in the 1990s. 
Results also underline the importance of using different kinds of data sources 
for evaluating child abuse. What is Known: • Physical and sexual abuse in 
childhood has been associated with lower life expectancy in connection with an 
array of chronic diseases, including mental disorders, and with suicide. • 
Measures of primary prevention have been developed in some countries, such as 
the USA and Canada. What is New: • Canadians born from 1983 to 1992 report 
significantly less overall abuse, physical abuse, and sexual abuse than older 
generations do. • These encouraging results support policies implemented in the 
1990s focused on improving the childhood environment.

OBJECTIVES: To find whether Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery 
was cost effective compared to conventional medical management (CMM) in Chinese 
patients with type 2 Diabetes(T2D) and obesity with a body mass index (BMI) 
≥27.5 kg/m2 in four years.
METHODS: A total of 106 obese T2D individuals who underwent RYGB and 106 T2D 
patients treated with CMM were enrolled from three academic medical centers. 
Total health related costs, Glycated Hemoglobin A1c (A1C) and BMI was recorded. 
Cost-Utility Analysis (CUA) was used. Utility values according to results of A1c 
were obtained from published studies.
RESULTS: Improvements were observed in A1C (8.6% at baseline to 6.2% in the 
first year, p < 0.001) and BMI (30.7 kg/m2 at baseline to 24.3 kg/m2 in the 
first year, p < 0.001), and the effect lasted for 4 years after RYGB. In the CMM 
group, A1C fluctuated in four years. The health utility for RYGB group scores 
3.756, whereas CMM group scores 3.594 in four years. The total healthcare costs 
decreased sharply from the second year after RYGB ($8,483 [¥52,596] in the first 
year to $672[¥4,164] in the second year, p < 0.001) and maintained for 3 years. 
In the CMM group, the total healthcare costs changed without significance. RYGB 
costs US$19,359 (¥125,836) per quality-adjusted life years (QALY) gained 
(incremental cost-utility ratio [ICUR]) compared to CMM, which was lower than a 
willingness-to-pay (WTP) of $20,277/QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: Compared to CMM, RYGB is cost-effective for Chinese patients with 
type 2 diabetes and obesity 4 years after operation.

PGE(2) mediates cytoskeletal rearrangement of hemocytes via Cdc42, a small G 
protein, to activate actin-remodeling factors in Spodoptera exigua (Lepidoptera: 
Noctuidae).

University, Andong, Korea.

Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2 ) mediates cellular immune responses in insects by 
stimulating hemocyte-spreading behavior that is driven by actin remodeling to 
form filopodial or lamellipodial cytoplasmic extensions. In Spodoptera exigua 
(Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), Cdc42, a small G protein, played a crucial role in 
mediating PGE2 signal on hemocyte-spreading behavior. Hemocyte-spreading 
behavior requires actin cytoskeletal rearrangement. A plethora of actin-related 
proteins have been predicted to have functional links with Cdc42. Here, we 
selected four actin-associated genes (Actin-related protein 2 [Arp2], Profilin, 
Cofilin, and Fascin) and evaluated their influences on cytoskeletal 
rearrangement in S. exigua. Bioinformatic analysis confirmed their gene 
identities. Transcript analysis using reverse-transcription polymerase chain 
reaction indicated that all four actin-associated genes were expressed in most 
developmental stages, showing high expression levels in larval hemocytes. RNA 
interference (RNAi) against these genes was performed by injecting 
double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) to hemocoel. Under RNAi condition, the 
hemocyte-spreading behavior was significantly impaired except for dsRNA 
treatment against Cofilin, an actin-depolymerizing factor. Alteration of 
cytoskeletal rearrangement appeared to vary after different RNAi treatments. 
RNAi against Arp2 markedly suppressed lamellipodial extension while RNAi against 
Profilin or Fascin adversely influenced filopodial extension. RNAi of these 
actin-associated factors prevented cellular immune responses measured by nodule 
formation against bacterial challenge. Under RNAi conditions, addition of PGE2 
did not well induce hemocyte-spreading behavior, suggesting that these 
actin-associated factors might act downstream of the hormone signaling pathway. 
These results suggest that PGE2 can mediate hemocyte-spreading behavior via 
Cdc42 to activate downstream actin polymerization/branching/bundling factors, 
thus inducing actin cytoskeletal rearrangement.

Territory.

OBJECTIVES: To assess whether progress is being made towards reducing Aboriginal 
and Torres Strait Islander inequality in life expectancy and under-five 
mortality in the Northern Territory.
METHODS: Life tables for five-year periods from 1966-71 to 2011-16 were 
calculated using standard abridged life table methods with Aboriginal and Torres 
Strait Islander deaths and population estimates as inputs. The latter were 
calculated using reverse cohort survival.
RESULTS: In 2011-16, life expectancy at birth for the Aboriginal and Torres 
Strait Islander population was 68.2 years for females and 64.9 years for males. 
Limited progress in under-five mortality rates has been made in recent years.
CONCLUSIONS: Although Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander life expectancy has 
increased in the long run, the gap with all-Australian life expectancy has not 
narrowed. The gap in under-five mortality rates is much lower than it was in the 
1960s and 1970s, but progress has been limited over the past decade. 
Implications for public health: The 'Closing the Gap' target of halving the gap 
in under-five mortality by 2018 will not be met in the Northern Territory, and 
there is no evidence yet of progress on the target to eliminate the gap in life 
expectancy by 2031.

OBJECTIVES: To use the estimates from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2016 to 
describe patterns of suicide mortality globally, regionally, and for 195 
countries and territories by age, sex, and Socio-demographic index, and to 
describe temporal trends between 1990 and 2016.
DESIGN: Systematic analysis.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Crude and age standardised rates from suicide mortality 
and years of life lost were compared across regions and countries, and by age, 
sex, and Socio-demographic index (a composite measure of fertility, income, and 
education).
RESULTS: The total number of deaths from suicide increased by 6.7% (95% 
uncertainty interval 0.4% to 15.6%) globally over the 27 year study period to 
817 000 (762 000 to 884 000) deaths in 2016. However, the age standardised 
mortality rate for suicide decreased by 32.7% (27.2% to 36.6%) worldwide between 
1990 and 2016, similar to the decline in the global age standardised mortality 
rate of 30.6%. Suicide was the leading cause of age standardised years of life 
lost in the Global Burden of Disease region of high income Asia Pacific and was 
among the top 10 leading causes in eastern Europe, central Europe, western 
Europe, central Asia, Australasia, southern Latin America, and high income North 
America. Rates for men were higher than for women across regions, countries, and 
age groups, except for the 15 to 19 age group. There was variation in the female 
to male ratio, with higher ratios at lower levels of Socio-demographic index. 
Women experienced greater decreases in mortality rates (49.0%, 95% uncertainty 
interval 42.6% to 54.6%) than men (23.8%, 15.6% to 32.7%).
CONCLUSIONS: Age standardised mortality rates for suicide have greatly reduced 
since 1990, but suicide remains an important contributor to mortality worldwide. 
Suicide mortality was variable across locations, between sexes, and between age 
groups. Suicide prevention strategies can be targeted towards vulnerable 
populations if they are informed by variations in mortality rates.

OBJECTIVES: Disutility allows to identify how much population values 
intervention-related harms contributing to knowledge on the benefits/harms ratio 
of cancer screening programs. This systematic review evaluates disutility 
related to cancer screening applying a utility theory framework.
METHODS: Using a predefined protocol, Embase, Medline Ovid, Web of Science, 
Cochrane, Google scholar and supplementary sources were systematically searched. 
The framework grouped disutilities associated with breast, cervical, lung, 
colorectal, and prostate cancer screening programs into the screening, 
diagnostic work up, and treatment phases. We assessed the quality of included 
studies according to the relevance to target population, risk of bias, 
appropriateness of measure and the time frame.
RESULTS: Out of 2840 hits, we included 38 studies, of which 27 measured (and 
others estimated) disutilities. Around 70% of studies had medium to high-level 
quality. Measured disutilities and Quality Adjusted Life Years loss were 0-0.03 
and 0-0.0013 respectively in screening phases. Both disutilities and Quality 
Adjusted Life Years loss had similar ranges in diagnostic work up (0-0.26), and 
treatment (0.09-0.27) phases. We found no measured disutilities available for 
lung cancer screening and-little evidence for disutilities in treatment phase. 
Almost 40% of the estimated disutility values were above the range of measured 
ones.
CONCLUSIONS: Cancer screening programs led to low disutities related to 
screening phase, and low to moderate disutilities related to diagnostic work up 
and treatment phases. These disutility values varied by the measurement 
instrument applied, and were higher in studies with lower quality. The estimated 
disutility values comparing to the measured ones tended to overestimate the 
harms.

OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness 
of abatacept, tocilizumab, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors as 
compared with rituximab in Finnish rheumatoid arthritis patients, who have 
previously been treated with TNF inhibitors.
METHODS: A patient-level simulation model was developed to predict costs and 
outcomes associated with four biological drugs (abatacept, tocilizumab, 
rituximab and TNF inhibitors) in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. 
Following lack of efficacy or adverse events, the patients were switched to 
another biological drug until all four options were exhausted. After that, the 
patients were assumed to receive a 6th line treatment until death. The patients' 
baseline characteristics and regression models used in the simulation were based 
on observational data from the National Register for Biological Treatments in 
Finland. Direct costs comprised drug costs, administration costs, costs of 
switching, and outpatient and inpatient care, while indirect costs included 
disability pension and sick leaves due to rheumatoid arthritis. Several subgroup 
and deterministic sensitivity analyses were conducted.
RESULTS: Drug costs were the lowest for rituximab, but when administration costs 
and costs of switching were included, drug costs were the lowest for TNF 
inhibitors. Abatacept was associated with the highest drug costs, whereas 
rituximab was associated with the highest healthcare costs. In total, TNF 
inhibitors had the lowest direct costs, while rituximab had the highest direct 
costs. The amount of quality-adjusted life years (QALY) gained ranged from 9.405 
for rituximab to 9.661 for TNF inhibitors. TNF inhibitors, abatacept, and 
tocilizumab were dominant in comparison to RTX.
CONCLUSIONS: TNF inhibitors, abatacept, and tocilizumab had lower costs and 
higher QALYs than rituximab, and therefore, they were dominant in comparison to 
rituximab. As TNF inhibitors had the lowest costs and highest QALYs, they were 
the most cost-effective treatment option.

OBJECTIVE: About 50% of acute coronary syndromes occur in patients classified as 
being at low coronary risk. We aimed to assess the potential preventive benefit 
of carotid plaque imaging with ultrasound.
METHODS: We assessed the prevalence of &ldquo;old&rdquo; arteries (vascular age 
&ge;70 years; VA70) in 3248 healthy subjects aged 40&ndash;65 years from the 
Swiss region of Olten and the German region of Koblenz. We compared sensitivity, 
specificity and discriminatory performance of SCORE, PROCAM and AGLA coronary 
risk calculators to detect VA70 for various decision thresholds and performed 
reclassification and cost-efficiency analysis.
RESULTS: VA70 was found in one out of eight subjects. Sensitivity for VA70 was 
6% at the 10% AGLA threshold in women and 30% in men in the Olten area, which 
was confirmed for the Koblenz area with PROCAM (sensitivity 8% in women, 56% in 
men). Results were similar for SCORE. The discriminatory performance ranged 
between 0.69 and 0.82. Reclassification from low risk to a higher risk category 
occurred in 17&ndash;35% of patients. Analysis showed that carotid imaging for 
CHF 100 per person was highly cost efficient.
CONCLUSIONS: In subjects aged 40&ndash;65 years, the prevalence of old arteries 
is one out of eight and the detection rate of AGLA and SCORE is lower in women 
(6% for PROCAM) than for men (30%) at the 10% threshold. Carotid imaging may be 
used to reclassify subjects from low to intermediate or high cardiovascular 
risk. Our method is highly cost efficient at a price of CHF 100 per examination.

INTRODUCTION: In BCR-ABL1-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms, myelofibrosis 
(MF) is either primary (PMF) or secondary (SMF) to polycythemia vera or 
essential thrombocythemia. MF is characterized by an increased risk of 
transformation to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and a shortened life expectancy.
METHODS: Because natural histories of PMF and SMF are different, we studied by 
targeted next generation sequencing the differences in the molecular landscape 
of 86 PMF and 59 SMF and compared their prognosis impact.
RESULTS: PMF had more ASXL1 (47.7%) and SRSF2 (14%) gene mutations than SMF 
(respectively 27.1% and 3.4%, P = .04). Poorer survival was associated with RNA 
splicing mutations (especially SRSF2) and TP53 in PMF (P = .0003), and with 
ASXL1 and TP53 mutations in SMF (P < .0001). These mutations of poor prognosis 
were associated with biological features of scoring systems (DIPSS and MYSEC-PM 
score). Mutations in TP53/SRSF2 in PMF or TP53/ASXL1 in SMF were more frequent 
as the risk of these scores increased. This allowed for a better stratification 
of MF patients, especially within the DIPSS intermediate-1 risk group (DIPSS) or 
the MYSEC-PM high risk group. AML transformation occurred faster in SMF than in 
PMF and patients who transformed to AML were more SRSF2-mutated and less 
CALR-mutated at MF sampling.
CONCLUSIONS: PMF and SMF have different but not specific molecular profiles and 
different prognosis depending on the molecular profile. This may be due to 
differences in disease history. Combining mutations and existing scores should 
improve prognosis assessment.

The availability of water is the critical factor driving plant growth, 
physiological responses, population and community succession in arid and 
semiarid regions, thus a precipitation addition-reduction platform with five 
experimental treatments, was established to explore the growth and physiology of 
two psammophytes (also known as psammophiles) to precipitation manipulation in 
Horqin Sandy Land. Changes in coverage and density were measured, and 
antioxidant enzymes and osmoregulatory substances in both of the studied species 
were determined. Investigation results showed that the average vegetation 
coverage increased with an increasing precipitation, and reached a maximum in 
July. Under the -60% precipitation treatment, Tribulus terrestris accounted for 
a large proportion of the area, but Bassia dasyphylla was the dominant species 
in the +60% treatment. T. terrestris was found to have higher a drought stress 
resistance than B. dasyphylla. From days 4 to 7 after rainfall, B. dasyphylla 
under precipitation reduction showed obvious water stress. The malondialdehyde 
(MDA) content of B. dasyphylla was higher than that of T. terrestris, but that 
of B. dasyphylla had the lower relative water content (RWC). The MDA content in 
the precipitation reduction treatments of the two studied species was higher 
than that in the precipitation addition treatments from days 4 to 10. Peroxidase 
(POD) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and the soluble proteins and free 
proline content of T. terrestris were higher than those of B. dasyphylla. The 
free proline content of T. terrestris and B. dasyphylla increased with 
increasing drought stress. Our data illustrated that T. terrestris had a higher 
drought stress resistance than B. dasyphylla, which was correlated with the 
augmentation of some antioxidant enzymes and osmoregulatory substance. The 
adaptive mechanism provides solid physiological support for an understanding of 
psammophyte adaptation to drought stress, and of community succession or species 
manipulation for desertified land restoration.

INTRODUCTION: Much of the US adult population does not engage in regular 
physical activity or meet the recommended guidelines for exercise. Moreover, 
many rural Americans disproportionately experience lower health status and life 
expectancy attributed to obesity, poor diet, and lack of physical activity. 
Evidence supports the role of perceived physical and social-environmental 
factors as potential influencers of exercise. However, measurement of these 
influencers, particularly within diverse, rural populations, has been sparse. A 
substantial number of American Indians live in federally defined rural areas, 
and many rural American Indians are at elevated risk for being overweight and 
obese due to physical inactivity. Therefore, this study established the validity 
and reliability of the Rural Active Living Perceived Environmental Support Scale 
(RALPESS) within a predominantly rural American Indian sample.
METHODS: In this cross-sectional pilot study, the 33-item RALPESS was 
administered to 130 adults, across 19 rural localities within Oklahoma, who were 
recruited from community events hosted by local partners of the tribal Head 
Start program. Confirmatory factor analysis was used to examine the hypothesized 
factor structure of the RALPESS.
RESULTS: Confirmatory factor analysis showed an adequate fit between the 
hypothesized model and the data. Analyses produced an acceptable χ2 goodness of 
fit index with two degrees of freedom. The comparative fit index and parsimony 
goodness of fit index were acceptable. The root mean square error of 
approximation and its 90% confidence interval were also acceptable. Overall, the 
RALPESS showed suitable internal consistency for the full measure and its 
subscales, resulting in Cronbach's alpha between 0.82 and 0.96.
CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study produced confirmatory evidence that the RALPESS is 
likely a valid and reliable tool for use with rural American Indian populations. 
Continued validation of this scale, particularly in international rural 
communities, will support further investigation into this important public 
health issue, and may further efforts towards the development and promotion of 
effective programming to increase exercise engagement.

Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is one of the most challenging diseases faced by 
humankind. AD is still not classified as curable because of the complex 
structure of pathologies underlying it. As the mean life expectancy of the world 
population constantly increases, the prevalence of AD and treatment costs for AD 
also grow rapidly. Current state of the art for AD treatment mainly consists of 
palliative therapy aimed at providing symptomatic relief and improving the 
standard of living in patients with AD. However, different research groups are 
working on more effective and safe drug delivery options aimed at both 
symptomatic relief and treatment of the underlying mechanisms. In this review, 
the current prevalence of AD, health costs, pathologies, and available treatment 
options including the ones in the market and/or under trial have been reviewed. 
Data in the existing literature have been presented, and future opportunities 
have been discussed. It is our belief that these nanotechnological products 
provide the required efficacy and safety profiles to enable these formulations 
go through phase studies and enter the market after regulatory authority 
approval, as with cancer. Last, but not the least the metabolomic studies will 
be providing useful informative data on the early diagnosis of AD, thus may be 
clinical implications might be delayed with the administration of therapeutic 
agents at the initial state of the disease.

Objective　In recent years, studies have reported a prefectural-level disparity 
in life expectancy. Therefore, we analyzed the related factors using the 
National Database (NDB), which includes data pertaining to the specific health 
checkup conducted for 20 million individuals. By doing so, we aimed to obtain 
basic data for developing future health promotion measures.Methods　We used 
specific health checkup items from NDB Open Data for 2014, and life expectancy 
data from Prefecture Life Table for 2015. The specific health checkup items were 
adjusted by age using Japanese population data for 2015. A multiple linear 
regression analysis was conducted using specific health checkup items that were 
significantly related to average life expectancy as explanatory 
variables.Results　In men, excessive drinking, smoking, antihypertensive drug 
use, systolic blood pressure, and hyperglycemia were independently and inversely 
related to life expectancy. In women, smoking and antihypertensive drug use 
emerged as significant factors.Conclusions　Analysis using NDB Open Data showed 
that lifestyle factors such as smoking and drinking, and cardiovascular risk 
factors such as high blood pressure and hyperglycemia, were strongly related to 
life expectancy. These result suggest that it is necessary to focus on the above 
factors when prefectural authorities implement health promotion measures.

OBJECTIVE: The life expectancy of women increases with the advancement in modern 
medicine, leading them to spent about two decades in menopausal state along with 
its associated complications. The process of aging triggers a deleterious 
cascade of physiological changes in the body. Hence, the aim of our study is to 
determine the effects of both aerobic and anaerobic exercises on estrogen level 
in postmenopausal osteoporotic females.
METHODOLOGY: A randomized control trial was conducted among 94 postmenopausal 
osteoporotic females, randomly divided into two equal groups. The participants 
in Group A were assigned to perform aerobic exercise, whereas Group B performed 
resistance exercises. Each group performed exercises for 12 weeks, whereas 
reading was collected for blood estrogen level, fat mass, and muscle mass before 
exercise training and after 12 weeks of training.
RESULTS: Twelve weeks of aerobic and anaerobic exercise program based on the 
American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM); frequency, intensity, time, and type 
protocol has beneficial effect on estradiol level and lean mass, whereas 
inversely correlated with fat mass of postmenopausal osteoporotic female.
CONCLUSION: The study concluded that 12 weeks of exercise programs was found to 
be effective in improving estradiol level of postmenopausal osteoporotic female. 
The efficacy of anaerobic exercise was found to be more potent on estradiol 
level and lean mass than aerobic exercises as only 36 sessions of resisted 
exercises performed during a period of 12 weeks provided more significant result 
than 72 session of aerobic exercises.

BACKGROUND: The main objective of this study was to analyse how the inclusion 
(exclusion) of social costs can alter the results and conclusions of economic 
evaluations in the field of Alzheimer's disease interventions.
METHODS: We designed a systematic review that included economic evaluations in 
Alzheimer's disease. The search strategy was launched in 2000 and ran until 
November 2018. The inclusion criteria were: being an original study published in 
a scientific journal, being an economic evaluation of any intervention related 
to Alzheimer's disease, including social costs (informal care costs and/or 
productivity losses), being written in English, using QALYs as an outcome for 
the incremental cost-utility analysis, and separating the results according to 
the perspective applied.
RESULTS: It was finally included 27 studies and 55 economic evaluations. Around 
11% of economic evaluations changed their main conclusions. More precisely, 
three of them concluded that the new intervention became cost-effective when the 
societal perspective was considered, whereas when using just the health care 
payer perspective, the new intervention did not result in a cost-utility ratio 
below the threshold considered. Nevertheless, the inclusion of social cost can 
also influence the results, as 37% of the economic evaluations included became 
the dominant strategy after including social costs when they were already 
cost-effective in the health care perspective.
CONCLUSIONS: Social costs can substantially modify the results of the 
economic evaluations. Therefore, taking into account social costs in diseases 
such as Alzheimer's can be a key element in making decisions about public 
financing and pricing of health interventions.

BACKGROUND: The Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis (GPELF) was 
launched in 2000 with the goal of eliminating lymphatic filariasis (LF) as a 
public health problem by 2020. Despite considerable progress, the current 
prevalence is around 60% of the 2000 figure, with the deadline looming a year 
away. Consequently, there is a continued need for investment in both the mass 
drug administration (MDA) and morbidity management programs, and this paper aims 
to demonstrate that need by estimating the health and economic burdens of LF 
prior to MDA programs starting in GPELF areas.
METHODS: A previously developed model was used to estimate the numbers of 
individuals infected and individuals with symptomatic disease, along with the 
attributable number of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). The economic 
burden was calculated by quantifying the costs incurred by the health-care 
system in managing clinical cases, the patients' out-of-pocket costs, and their 
productivity costs.
RESULTS: Prior to the MDA program, approximately 129 million people were 
infected with LF, of which 43 million had clinical disease, corresponding to a 
DALY burden of 5.25 million. The average annual economic burden per chronic case 
was US $115, the majority of which resulted from productivity costs. The total 
economic burden of LF was estimated at US $5.8 billion annually.
CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate the magnitude of the LF burden and 
highlight the continued need to support the GPELF. Patients with clinical 
disease bore the majority of the economic burden, but will not benefit much from 
the current MDA program, which is aimed at reducing transmission. This 
assessment further highlights the need to scale up morbidity management 
programs.

Laboratory investigations have demonstrated that at low plasma concentrations 
(1-5 mg/l) theophylline markedly enhances the anti-inflammatory effects of 
corticosteroids in COPD.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of 
adding low-dose theophylline to a drug regimen containing ICSs in people with 
COPD at high risk of exacerbation.
DESIGN: A multicentre, pragmatic, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled 
clinical trial.
SETTING: The trial was conducted in 121 UK primary and secondary care sites.
PARTICIPANTS: People with COPD [i.e. who have a forced expiratory volume in 1 
second (FEV1)/forced vital capacity (FVC) of < 0.7] currently on a drug regimen 
including ICSs with a history of two or more exacerbations treated with
