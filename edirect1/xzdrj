Finally, we discuss challenges and potential research paths that will promote 
further research into future pandemic outbreaks.

Kiwifruit worldwide suffers from the devastating diseases of bacterial canker 
caused by Pseudomonas syringae pv. actinidiae (Psa) and gray mold caused by 
Botrytis cinerea. Here, an endophytic bacterium XL17 isolated from a rape crown 
gall was screened out for its potent antagonistic activities against Psa and B. 
cinerea. Strain XL17 and its cell-free culture filtrate (CF) inhibited the 
growth of Psa and B. cinerea, Psa-associated leaf necrosis, and B. 
cinerea-associated kiwifruit necrosis. Electron microscopy showed that XL17 CF 
could damage the cell structures of Psa and B. cinerea. Genome-based taxonomy 
revealed that strain XL17 belongs to Pseudomonas bijieensis within the P. 
corrugata subgroup of the P. fluorescens species complex. Among the P. corrugata 
subgroup containing 31 genomospecies, the presence of the phl operon responsible 
for the biosynthesis of the phenolic polyketide 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol 
(DAPG) and the absence of the lipopeptide/quorum sensing island can serve as the 
genetic marker for the determination of a plant-protection life style. HPLC 
detected DAPG in extracts from XL17 CF. MALDI-TOF-MS analysis revealed that 
strain XL17 produced cyclic lipopeptides of the viscosin family and orfamide 
family. Together, phenotypic, genomic, and metabolic analyses identified that P. 
bijieensis XL17 producing DAPG and cyclic lipopeptides can be used to control 
bacterial canker and gray mold pathogens of kiwifruit.

During the last 30 years, antiretroviral treatment (ART) for human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection has been continuously evolving. Since 
1996, three-drug regimens (3DR) have been standard-of-care for HIV treatment and 
are based on a protease inhibitor (PI) or a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase 
inhibitor (NNRTI) plus two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs). 
The effectiveness of first-generation 3DRs allowed a dramatic increase in the 
life expectancy of HIV-infected patients, although it was associated with 
several side effects and ART-related toxicities. The development of novel 
two-drug regimens (2DRs) started in the mid-2000s in order to minimize side 
effects, reduce drug-drug interactions and improve treatment compliance. Several 
clinical trials compared 2DRs and 3DRs in treatment-naïve and 
treatment-experienced patients and showed the non-inferiority of 2DRs in terms 
of efficacy, which led to 2DRs being used as first-line treatment in several 
clinical scenarios, according to HIV clinical guidelines. In this review, we 
summarize the current evidence, research gaps and future prospects of 2DRs.

Today, the use of natural biodegradable materials in the production processes is 
more and more adopted by industry to achieve cyclic economy targets and to 
improve environmental and human health indexes. Active packaging is the latest 
trend for food preservation. In this work, nanostructures were prepared by 
incorporation of thyme oil with natural natrium-montmorillonite and 
organo-montmorillonite with two different techniques, direct impregnation and 
the green evaporation-adsorption process. Such nanostructures were mixed with 
poly-L-lactic-acid for the first time via an extrusion molding process to 
develop a new packaging film. Comparisons of morphological, mechanical, and 
other basic properties for food packaging were carried out via XRD, FTIR, TG, 
SEM/EDS, oxygen and water vapor permeation, and antimicrobial and antioxidant 
activity for the first time. Results showed that poly-L-lactic-acid could be 
modified with clays and essential oils to produce improved active packaging 
films. The final product exhibits food odor prevention characteristics and 
shelf-life extension capabilities, and it could be used for active packaging. 
The films based on OrgMt clay seems to be more promising, while the thyme oil 
addition improves their behavior as active packaging. The PLLA/3%TO@OrgMt and 
PLLA/5%TO@OrgMt films were qualified between the tested samples as the most 
promising materials for this purpose.

Riboflavin (RF) was considered to be possessed of photoactivity to generate 
reactive oxygen species (ROS) under ultraviolet (UV) light, which is thought to 
be a favorable antibacterial candidate. Herein, RF was incorporated into 
chitosan (CS) coatings and treated under UV with different exposure times (2, 4, 
and 6 h) to improve the physicochemical and antibacterial properties. The 
results showed that the light transmittance and antibacterial performance of 
chitosan coatings gradually increased with the extension of the UV irradiation 
time. The antibacterial ability of chitosan coatings correlated with the 
generation of ROS: ∙OH and H2O2, which achieved 1549.08 and 95.48 μg/g, 
respectively, after 6 h irradiation. Furthermore, the chitosan coatings with UV 
irradiation also reduced the pH value, total volatile basic nitrogen (TVB-N), 
ΔE, and total viable counts (TVC) and improved sensory attributes of pork. In 
conclusion, the UV irradiated chitosan coatings could be used as an 
environmentally friendly antimicrobial packaging material to effectively delay 
the spoilage of pork, maintain its sensory quality and prolong its shelf life.

BACKGROUND: Schimke immuno-osseous dysplasia (SIOD) is a very rare autosomal 
recessive genetic disease caused by mutations in the SMARCAL1 gene. It is 
characterized by spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia, T-cell immunodeficiency, 
hypercromic nevi, hypercholestero-lemia, and steroid-resistant nephrotic 
syndrome with progressive renal failure to end-stage kidney disease.
CASE PRESENTATION: We report two cases of SIOD in sisters, diagnosed after the 
debut of nephrotic syndrome. Both had a personal history of short stature, 
acetabular hip dysplasia, and hypercholesterolemia. The first case, a 6-year-old 
girl, presented peripheral refractory edema, severe arterial hypertension, and 
progressive decrease of the glomerular filtration rate. Steroid-resistance of 
nephrotic syndrome was confirmed, treated with tacrolimus without response. 
Renal function worsened over the following 4 months, so haemodialysis was 
started. Her sister, a 5-year-old girl, had the steroid-resistant nephrotic 
syndrome and normal blood pressure and renal function under enalapril treatment. 
In view of the suspicion of SIOD, genetic studies were carried out, revealing 
the same mutation in homozygosis.
CONCLUSION: SIOD has a variable expression with multi-systemic involvement with 
a short life expectancy. Early diagnosis is important, which can encourage the 
early start of treatment and anticipation of complications that may be 
life-threatening.

The antigen specificity and long serum half-life of monoclonal antibodies have 
made them a critical part of modern therapeutics. These properties have been 
coopted in a number of synthetic formats, such as antibody-drug conjugates, 
bispecific antibodies, or Fc-fusion proteins to generate novel biologic drug 
modalities. Historically, these new therapies have been generated by covalently 
linking multiple molecular moieties through chemical or genetic methods. This 
irreversible fusion of different components means that the function of the 
molecule is static, as determined by the structure. Here, we report the 
development of a technology for switchable assembly of functional antibody 
complexes using chemically induced dimerization domains. This approach enables 
control of the antibody's intended function in vivo by modulating the dose of a 
small molecule. We demonstrate this switchable assembly across three 
therapeutically relevant functionalities in vivo, including localization of a 
radionuclide-conjugated antibody to an antigen-positive tumor, extension of a 
cytokine's half-life, and activation of bispecific, T cell-engaging antibodies.

The rapid outbreak of coronavirus threatens humans' life all around the world. 
Due to the insufficient diagnostic infrastructures, developing an accurate, 
efficient, inexpensive, and quick diagnostic tool is of great importance. To 
date, researchers have proposed several detection models based on chest imaging 
analysis, primarily based on deep neural networks; however, none of which could 
achieve a reliable and highly sensitive performance yet. Therefore, the nature 
of this study is primary epidemiological research that aims to overcome the 
limitations mentioned above by proposing a large-scale publicly available 
dataset of chest computed tomography scan (CT-scan) images consisting of more 
than 13k samples. Secondly, we propose a more sensitive deep neural networks 
model for CT-scan images of the lungs, providing a pixel-wise attention layer on 
top of the high-level features extracted from the network. Moreover, the 
proposed model is extended through a transfer learning approach for being 
applicable in the case of chest X-Ray (CXR) images. The proposed model and its 
extension have been trained and evaluated through several experiments. The 
inclusion criteria were patients with suspected PE and positive real-time 
reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for SARS-CoV-2. The 
exclusion criteria were negative or inconclusive RT-PCR and other chest CT 
indications. Our model achieves an AUC score of 0.886, significantly better than 
its closest competitor, whose AUC is 0.843. Moreover, the obtained results on 
another commonly-used benchmark show an AUC of 0.899, outperforming related 
models. Additionally, the sensitivity of our model is 0.858, while that of its 
closest competitor is 0.81, explaining the efficiency of pixel-wise attention 
strategy in detecting coronavirus. Our promising results and the efficiency of 
the models imply that the proposed models can be considered reliable tools for 
assisting doctors in detecting coronavirus.

INTRODUCTION: Developing instruments to screen for relevant aspects of advanced 
illness is key to identifying palliative needs and evaluating the effectiveness 
of interventions in this population. The objective of this project is to 
validate the Death and Dying Distress Scale in Spanish (DADDS-Sp) for screening 
anxiety about death and evaluating psychometric properties for people with 
advanced cancer.
METHODS: DADDS is a 15-item self-administered questionnaire that assesses 
thoughts and feelings related to death and the process of dying. A 
cross-sectional, descriptive, psychometric validation study was conducted in two 
cancer centres in Santiago de Chile. Included were patients over 18 years of age 
with incurable and/or metastatic cancer, fluent in Spanish, and a life 
expectancy of more than 3 months. Reliability was analysed using Cronbach's 
alpha, and confirmatory factor analysis was performed following the model of the 
original scale.
RESULTS: Seventy four patients participated in the study. The median age was 63 
years. Of the sample, 59% identified themselves as women. On average, 
participants reported low anxiety about death (mean = 21, SD = 18). Women have 
more death anxiety. The reliability analysis yielded a value of α = 0.93 (IC = 
0.91-0.95). Factor analysis with a one-factor structure yielded Comparative Fit 
Index (CFI) = 0. 0.972, Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA) = 0.092, 
Standardized Root Mean Square Residual (SRMR) = 0.085 and Tucker-Lewis Index 
(TLI) = 0.968. The model with a two-factor structure yielded CFI = 0.989, RMSEA 
= 0.059, SRMR = 0.075 and TLI = 0.987, suggesting that the two-factor model has 
a better fit for the data studied.
CONCLUSIONS: DADDS-Sp is psychometrically valid for use in a Spanish-speaking 
population, yielding high reliability and internal consistency. A majority of 
the Chilean patients reported a low level of anxiety about death although about 
10% presented with severe anxiety, so their identification for adequate clinical 
management is fundamental.

BACKGROUND: There is a large gap in the data on cancer outcomes in Latin 
America, making it difficult to establish adequate cancer control policies in 
the region. The aim of our study was to describe the survival, life expectancy 
estimates and life expectancy changes over time for a large cohort of Peruvian 
patients insured with Oncosalud, a private healthcare system.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We evaluated a retrospective cohort of patients diagnosed 
between 2000 and 2015 in Oncosalud (Lima-Peru). Cases included colon, rectum, 
stomach, bladder, breast, prostate and non-melanoma skin cancers. Survival was 
evaluated with the Kaplan-Meier methodology. The standard period life table was 
used to estimate the excess mortality risks of patients in our cohort compared 
to the population covered by the Peruvian Superintendence of Banks, Insurance 
Companies and Pension Funds (SBS). The years of life lost was estimated based on 
SBS population, matching patients by age and sex.
RESULTS: A large cohort of 7,687 Peruvian cancer patients managed in a 15-year 
period was eligible. If patients survive 5 years after a cancer diagnosis, life 
expectancy tends to be close to that of a population without cancer. The number 
of years of life lost at diagnosis was higher at the youngest ages, steadily 
decreasing thereafter. During the first years after cancer diagnosis, young 
patients face a much higher loss in life expectancy than older ones. Patients 
suffering from colon, rectum, stomach and bladder cancer are the most affected 
by the years of life lost.
CONCLUSION: In cancer patients surviving ≥ 5 years, life expectancy becomes 
similar to that observed in a population with similar socioeconomic 
characteristics. The estimated survival rate in our cohort is higher than that 
reported by public cancer registries in Peru. This could be explained by the 
different socio-economic background and access to specialised cancer care.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a silent and poorly known killer. The current 
concept of CKD is relatively young and uptake by the public, physicians and 
health authorities is not widespread. Physicians still confuse CKD with chronic 
kidney insufficiency or failure. For the wider public and health authorities, 
CKD evokes kidney replacement therapy (KRT). In Spain, the prevalence of KRT is 
0.13%. Thus health authorities may consider CKD a non-issue: very few persons 
eventually need KRT and, for those in whom kidneys fail, the problem is 'solved' 
by dialysis or kidney transplantation. However, KRT is the tip of the iceberg in 
the burden of CKD. The main burden of CKD is accelerated ageing and premature 
death. The cut-off points for kidney function and kidney damage indexes that 
define CKD also mark an increased risk for all-cause premature death. CKD is the 
most prevalent risk factor for lethal coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and 
the factor that most increases the risk of death in COVID-19, after old age. Men 
and women undergoing KRT still have an annual mortality that is 10- to 100-fold 
higher than similar-age peers, and life expectancy is shortened by ~40 years for 
young persons on dialysis and by 15 years for young persons with a functioning 
kidney graft. CKD is expected to become the fifth greatest global cause of death 
by 2040 and the second greatest cause of death in Spain before the end of the 
century, a time when one in four Spaniards will have CKD. However, by 2022, CKD 
will become the only top-15 global predicted cause of death that is not 
supported by a dedicated well-funded Centres for Biomedical Research (CIBER)

BACKGROUND: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) in Latin America (LA) continues to 
represent a challenge due to the burden of disease it causes and the difficulty 
in accessing treatment. LA has a total population of 652 million people living 
in 20 countries that occupy an area of 19.2 million km2. The Latin American 
Dialysis and Renal Transplantation Registry (LADRTR), founded in 1991, has 
collected data and reports on patients receiving kidney replacement therapy 
(KRT) since 1993. This article summarizes the registry data for 2019.
METHODS: Participating countries complete an annual survey collecting aggregated 
data on incident and prevalent patients on KRT in all modalities. The different 
treatment modalities considered were hemodialysis (HD), peritoneal dialysis (PD) 
and living functioning kidney graft (LFG). National gross domestic product per 
capita (GDP, expressed in US dollars) and life expectancy at birth (LEB) 
corresponding to the year 2019 were collected from the World Bank Data Bank. 
Prevalence and incidence were compared with previous years and were also 
correlated with GDP and LEB.
RESULTS: On 31 December 2019 a total of 432 610 patients were in KRT in LA, 
corresponding to an overall unadjusted prevalence of 866 per million population 
(pmp). Regarding treatment modality, 66.7% of the prevalent patients were 
treated with HD and 9.3% with PD while 24% of the patients had an LFG. A total 
of 85 224 patients started KRT in LA, representing a total unadjusted incidence 
rate of 168 pmp. Diabetic nephropathy as a cause of CKD continues to be a 
relevant percentage (36%) and five countries reported CKD of nontraditional 
causes. The kidney transplant rate in the region was 22 pmp, varying from 1 to 
>60 pmp. The total prevalence of KRT correlated positively with GDP per capita 
(r 2 = 0.6, P < 0.01) and LEB (r 2 = 0.23, P < 0.05). The overall incidence rate 
also significantly correlated with GDP (r 2 = 0.307, P < 0.05). The overall 
unadjusted mortality rate was 13%.
CONCLUSION: Accessibility to KRT is still limited in LA. It is necessary to 
continue the efforts made by each country and the Latin American Society of 
Nephrology and Hypertension to guarantee equal access to treatment.

OBJECTIVE: Despite the advances in the control of traditional risk factors, 
coronary artery disease (CAD) remains the greatest cause of morbidity and 
mortality. Our aim was to establish the relation between plasma proteomics 
analysis and the risk of cardiovascular events in patients with stable CAD.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with stable CAD and documented coronary 
atherosclerosis were screened for inclusion. Using proximity extension assays, 
177 plasma proteins were simultaneously measured. The endpoint consisted of the 
first major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) and was the composite of 
cardiovascular death, acute coronary syndrome, stroke, transient ischemic 
attack, or acute limb ischemia at 18 months follow-up. Cox proportional-hazards 
regression with adjustment for multiple comparisons was used to identify 
biomarkers for the outcomes of interest.
RESULTS: The cohort consisted of 229 patients. Six mediators were associated 
with MACE (p < 0.001). For these markers, the risk of MACE was calculated: tumor 
necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 13B (HR = 1.65; 95% CI: 1.30-2.10), 
C-C motif chemokine-3 (HR = 1.57; 95% CI: 1.23-1.98), decorin (HR = 1.65; 95% 
CI: 1.26-2.16), fibroblast growth factor-23 (HR = 1.56; 95% CI: 1.23-1.99), 
tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand-receptor 2 (TRAIL-R2) 
(HR = 1.61; 95% CI: 1.23-2.11), and tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily 
member 10A (HR = 1.69; 95% CI: 1.25-2.29). Except for TRAIL-R2, the other 
proteins were associated with MACE independent of age, sex, diabetes mellitus, 
or estimated glomerular filtration rate.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with stable CAD, five novel biomarkers were identified 
as independent risk factors for adverse outcomes. Novel biomarkers could 
represent pharmacological targets for the prevention of adverse cardiovascular 
events.

BACKGROUND: Sarcopenia-related parameters may have differential impacts on 
health-related outcomes in older adults. We examined dose-response relationships 
of body composition, muscle strength, and physical performance with incident 
disability and mortality.
METHODS: This prospective study included 1765 Japanese residents (862 men; 903 
women) aged ≥65 years who participated in health check-ups. Outcomes were 
incident disability and all-cause mortality. Fat mass index (FMI) and skeletal 
muscle mass index (SMI), determined using segmental multi-frequency 
bioelectrical impedance analysis, handgrip strength (HGS), and usual gait speed 
(UGS) were measured. We determined multivariate-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for 
disability and mortality relative to sex-specific reference values (FMI: 
medians; SMI: 7.0 kg/m2 for men and 5.7 kg/m2 for women; HGS: 28 kg for men and 
18 kg for women; or UGS: 1.0 m/s for both sexes). Association shapes were 
examined using restricted cubic splines or fractional polynomial functions.
RESULTS: The median follow-up was 5.3 years; 107 (12.7%) men and 123 (14.2%) 
women developed disability, and 101 (11.7%) men and 56 (6.2%) women died. FMI 
did not impact any outcome in men and disability in women, while an 
FMI ≤ 7.3 kg/m2 (median) was significantly associated with higher mortality risk 
in women, compared with median FMI. SMI did not impact disability in either sex 
and mortality in women, but showed a significant inverse dose-response 
relationship with mortality risk in men [HRs (95% confidence intervals) of 
minimum and maximum values compared with the reference value: 2.18 (1.07-4.46) 
and 0.43 (0.20-0.93), respectively], independent of HGS and UGS. HGS and UGS 
showed a significant inverse dose-response relationship with disability in both 
sexes [HGS: 1.71 (1.00-2.91) and 0.31 (0.09-0.99), respectively, in men, 2.42 
(1.18-4.96) and 0.41 (0.20-0.85), respectively, in women; UGS: 2.14 (1.23-3.74) 
and 0.23 (0.08-0.67), respectively, in men, 3.26 (2.07-5.14) and 0.11 
(0.05-0.26), respectively, in women] and mortality in women [HGS: 6.84 
(2.84-16.47) and 0.06 (0.02-0.21), respectively; UGS: 2.67 (1.14-6.27) and 0.30 
(0.11-0.85), respectively], independent of body composition, but did not impact 
mortality in men.
CONCLUSIONS: Disability risk was more dependent on muscle strength and physical 
performance in both sexes. Mortality risk in men was more dependent on muscle 
mass, and mortality risk in women was influenced by lower fat mass along with 
muscle strength and physical performance. Although improving muscle strength and 
physical performance should be the first target for health promotion, it is also 
necessary to pay attention to body composition to extend life expectancy in 
older adults.

INTRODUCTION: Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is an important HIV outcome 
beyond viral suppression. However, there are limited data characterizing HRQoL 
of key populations, including female sex workers (FSW) living with HIV.
METHODS: We used baseline data (22 June 2018-23 March 2020) of FSW who were 
diagnosed with HIV and enrolled into a randomized trial in Durban, South Africa. 
HRQoL information was collected by a generic preference-accompanied tool with 
five domains (EQ-5D), and summarized into a single score (range 0-1), which 
represents health utility. We employed multivariable beta regression models to 
identify determinants of HRQoL and to estimate subgroup-specific HRQoL score. 
Using external estimates of life expectancy and population size, we estimated 
the number of quality adjusted life years reduced among FSW living with HIV in 
South Africa associated with violence and drug use.
RESULTS: Of 1,363 individuals (mean age: 32.4 years; mean HRQoL score: 0.857) in 
our analysis, 62.6% used drugs, 61.3% experienced physical or sexual violence 
and 64.6% self-reported taking antiretroviral treatment (ART). The following 
were associated with a reduction in the average marginal HRQoL score: older age 
(per decade: 0.018 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.008, 0.027]), drug use 
(0.022 [0.007, 0.036]), experience of violence (0.024 [0.010, 0.038]) and 
moderate (vs. no) level of internalized stigma (0.023 [0.004, 0.041]). Current 
ART use was associated with a 0.015-point (-0.001, 0.031) increase in the HRQoL 
score. The estimated mean (95% CI) HRQoL scores ranged from 0.838 (0.816, 0.860) 
for FSW who used drugs, experienced violence and were not on ART; to 0.899 
(0.883, 0.916) for FSW who did not use drugs nor experience violence and were on 
ART. Our results can be translated into a reduction in 37,184 and 39,722 quality 
adjusted life years related to drug use and experience of violence, 
respectively, in South Africa.
CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate the association of ART with higher HRQoL 
among FSW and the need to further address structural risks, including drug use, 
violence and stigma. Population-specific estimates of HRQoL score can be further 
used to calculate quality-adjusted life years in economic evaluations of 
individual and structural interventions addressing the needs of FSW living with 
HIV.

Digital nucleic acid analysis technology has shown great application potential 
due to its excellent performance. However, most current digital nucleic acid 
detection methods are based on PCR or other template amplification strategies. 
Here, we present an alternative analysis platform based on digital nucleic acid 
signal amplification in droplets termed dNASA. Using a bead-based controllable 
extension bridged cascade signal amplification reaction, we achieved an ultralow 
background, high efficiency, and highly specific nucleic acid signal 
amplification analysis. As a "proof of concept", we demonstrated the feasibility 
of the proposed dNASA platform in single-base DNA mutation analysis using 
artificially synthesized samples. This platform provides innovative ideas for 
the field of digital nucleic acid analysis.

INTRODUCTION: Upper limb disability can limit the quality of life of lung cancer 
survivors. The COVID-19 era has required a finding of alternatives to attend the 
monitoring of presented disturbances with the minor risk of spread. 
Tele-assessment offers new possibilities for clinical assessment demonstrating 
good reliability compared to traditional face-to-face assessment in a variety of 
patients. No previous study has applied this type of assessment in lung cancer 
survivors. For this reason, the aim of this study was to evaluate the level of 
agreement between upper limb disability assessment using tele-assessment and the 
face-to-face method in lung cancer survivors.
METHODS: A reliability study was conducted with 20 lung cancer survivors 
recruited from the Oncological Radiotherapy Service of the "Hospital PTS" 
(Granada). Patients attended a session for clinical face-to-face and real-time 
online tele-assessment. The main outcome measurements of the study included 
upper limb function (shirt task) and musculoskeletal disturbances (active range 
of movement and trigger points), and these outcomes were recorded by two 
independent researchers.
RESULTS: The outcome measures showed good agreement between both assessments. 
The active range of movement presented heterogeneous results, being excellent 
reliability (ρ > 0.75) in extension, internal rotation, homolateral adduction, 
and contralateral abduction, good (0.4 < ρ < 0.75) for flexion, homolateral 
abduction, contralateral adduction and contralateral external rotation, and poor 
(ρ < 0.4) for homolateral external rotation. The measure evaluating upper limb 
function and trigger points show the highest interrater reliability with 
confidence interval lower limits ≥0.99.
DISCUSSION: The tele-assessment of upper limb function and musculoskeletal 
disorders of lung cancer survivors present a good interrater reliability 
compared to face-to-face assessment. It could be useful for monitoring the 
disability presented by cancer survivors whose access is difficult by the 
residential situation, physical limitations or the risk of COVID-19 spread.

BACKGROUND: National guidelines for prehospital trauma triage aim to identify 
seriously injured patients who may benefit from transport to trauma centers. 
These guidelines have poor sensitivity for serious injury among older adults. We 
evaluated the cost-effectiveness of a high-sensitivity triage strategy for older 
adults.
STUDY DESIGN: We developed a Markov chain Monte Carlo microsimulation model to 
estimate the cost-effectiveness of high-sensitivity field triage criteria among 
older adults compared with current practice. The model used a retrospective 
cohort of 3621 community-dwelling Medicare beneficiaries who were transported by 
emergency medical services after an acute injury in 7 counties in the 
northwestern US during January to December 2011. These data informed model 
estimates of emergency medical services triage assessment, hospital transport 
patterns, and outcomes from index hospitalization up to 1 year after discharge. 
Outcomes beyond 1 year were modeled using published literature. Differences in 
cost and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were calculated for both strategies 
using a lifetime analytical horizon. We calculated the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (cost per QALY gained) to assess cost-effectiveness, 
which we defined using a threshold of less than $100,000 per QALY.
RESULTS: High-sensitivity trauma field triage for older adults would produce a 
small incremental benefit in average trauma system effectiveness (0.0003 QALY) 
per patient at a cost of $1,236,295 per QALY. Sensitivity analysis indicates 
that the cost of initial hospitalization and emergency medical services 
adherence to triage status (ie transporting triage-positive patients to a trauma 
center) had the largest influence on overall cost-effectiveness.
CONCLUSIONS: High-sensitivity trauma field triage is not cost-effective among 
older adults.

BACKGROUND: The continuum of care for maternal and newborn health is a 
systematic approach for delivery of an integrated effective package of 
life-saving interventions throughout pregnancy, childbirth, and postpartum as 
well as across levels of service delivery to women and newborns. Nonetheless, in 
low-income countries, coverage of these interventions across the life cycle 
continuum is low. This study examined the predictors of utilization of maternal 
and newborn health care services along the continuum of care in Ethiopia.
METHODS: This was a cross-sectional population-based study. We measured maternal 
and newborn health care utilization practices among women who had live births in 
the last 12 months preceding the survey in Amhara, Oromia, SNNP, and Tigray 
regions of Ethiopia. We fitted multilevel random-effects logistic regression 
models to examine the predictors of the continuum of care accounting for the 
survey design, and individual, and contextual characteristics of the 
respondents.
RESULTS: Our analysis revealed that only one-fifth of women utilized maternal 
and newborn health services across the antepartum, intrapartum, and postpartum 
continuum; most women discontinued at the postpartum stage. Continued use of 
services varied significantly across wealth, model family, prenatal stay at 
maternity waiting homes, antenatal care in the first trimester, complete 
antenatal care service, and the administrative region at all antepartum, 
intrapartum, and postpartum stages. Moreover, family conversation during 
pregnancy [AOR: 2.12; 95% CI: 1.56-2.88], delivery by cesarean [AOR: 2.70; 95% 
CI: 1.82-4.02] and birth notified to health extension workers [AOR: 1.95; 95% 
CI: 1.56-2.43] were found to be predictors of the continuum of care at the 
postpartum stage.
CONCLUSION: In Ethiopia, despite good access to antepartum care, compliance with 
continuity of care across the pathway decreased with significant inequitable 
distributions, the poorest segment of the population being at most disadvantage. 
The main modifiable program factors connected to the continued uptake of 
maternal health services include family conversation, pregnant women conference, 
complete antenatal care, antenatal care in the first trimester, and birth 
notification.

Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) is a rare autosomal recessive hereditary disorder. As 
patients with XP are deficient in nucleotide excision repair, they show severe 
photosensitivity symptoms. Although skin protection from ultraviolet (UV) 
radiation is essential to improve the life expectancy of such patients, the 
optimal protective effect is not achieved even with sunscreen application, owing 
to the low usability of the preparations. Nanosheets are two-dimensional 
nanostructures with a thickness in the nanometer range. The extremely large 
aspect ratios of the nanosheets result in high transparency, flexibility, and 
adhesiveness. Moreover, their high moisture permeability enables their 
application to any area of the skin for a long time. We fabricated preparations
