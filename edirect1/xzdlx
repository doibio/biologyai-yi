Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common malignant brain tumor in 
adults, causing many deaths each year. The life expectancy of patients from the 
time of diagnosis does not exceed 15 months. Tumoral cells are generally 
surrounded by a bed of tumor microenvironment (TME), composed of various 
components such as different immune cells, stromal cells, and blood vessels. 
Previous studies on the treatment of this tumor have generally focused on 
cancerous cells and, therefore, have introduced conventional therapies for 
eradicating this tumor, including maximal safe surgery, chemotherapy with 
temozolomide (TMZ), and radiotherapy. Despite treatment with this method, tumors 
almost always recur, and life expectancy has not increased much. Recently, due 
to the discovery of the various roles of immune cells (including 
tumor-associated macrophages or TAMs) in the pathogenesis of this disease, the 
path of studies has moved towards targeting them as a treatment for 
glioblastoma. In this review, we aimed to investigate recent studies on the 
different roles of TME components, the role of TAM in the pathogenesis, and 
novel methods that target TAMs, including induction of TAM repolarization, 
inhibition of TAM-produced cytokines, and prohibition of immune system 
suppression induced by TAMs. In this regard, various targets, including 
colony-stimulating factor-1 (CSF- 1) receptors, Nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB), 
or chemokine receptor (CXCR) pathways, are investigated.

RATIONALE: Escobar syndrome (ES) is an autosomal recessive disorder. It is 
highly characterized by facial abnormalities, congenital diaphragmatic muscle 
weakness, myasthenic-like features, and skin pterygiums on multiple body 
legions. ES is a rare condition associated with many external and internal 
abnormalities. The internal malformations described in ES affect many organs 
including the heart, lungs, esophagus, liver, spleen, and intestine. The purpose 
of this paper is to explore the cardiac manifestations associated with ES.
PATIENT CONCERNS: A 3.5-year-old girl, who was born for double first cousins, 
was admitted to the hospital for neuromuscular evaluation of multiple congenital 
contractures.
DIAGNOSIS: The girl was diagnosed with ES and isolated dextrocardia which is a 
rare cardiac manifestation. However, to the best of our knowledge, no similar 
cases have been reported to date, and this case is thus believed to be very 
rare.
INTERVENTIONS: The patient underwent an operative intervention to correct the 
bilateral fixed flexion deformity at her knees which was related to the 
posterior bilateral fibrotic bands/pterygia.
OUTCOMES: Post-operatively, complete knee extension was obtained, the patient 
was fitted with a cast and extension night splint. She was discharged alive and 
had no complications. The patient was followed regularly in the orthopedic 
clinic and had periodic physiotherapy sessions.
CONCLUSIONS: ES and isolated dextrocardia concurrence in the presented case 
resulted from different pathogenic mechanisms. Our findings suggest that ES 
might be caused by dysfunction in the acetylcholine receptor throughout fetal 
life, which may have affected muscle strength and movement. Other cardiac 
conditions include hypoplastic left-sided heart, Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, 
patent ductus arteriosus, and heterotaxia.

To develop a new prognostic model for the overall survival of patients with 
clear cell metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) using Korean Renal Cancer 
Study Group (KRoCS) database and compared it with 2 renowned prognostic models: 
the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) and the international 
metastatic renal cell carcinoma database consortium (IMDC) models.Data of 790 
patients diagnosed with mRCC and receiving targeted therapy as their first-line 
treatment were pooled to this study. Data from 4 hospitals (n = 619) were used 
to develop the new model and those from other 5 hospitals (n = 171) were used 
for external validation. After detecting prognostic factors in multivariable Cox 
proportional-hazards regression analysis, patients were classified into 3 risk 
groups, favorable (0), intermediate (1-2), and poor (3 and more) by the number 
of prognostic factors.Seven variables such as more than 2 metastasis sites, no 
prior nephrectomy, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status ≥2, low 
hemoglobin, high serum corrected calcium, high neutrophil, high serum alkaline 
phosphatase were identified as prognostic factors for poor overall survival. 
Also, risk groups were categorized into 3 groups; median overall survival was 
61.1 months in favorable, 26.5 months in intermediate, and 6.8 months in poor 
group. KRoCS ranked the first in all 3 statistical parameters including akaike 
information criterion (AIC), concordance index and generalized R2 among other 
prognostic models.We developed the KRoCS model and validated it externally with 
demonstrating its superiority over MSKCC and IMDC models. The KRoCS model can 
provide useful information for counseling patients with clear cell mRCC 
regarding life-expectancy.

Meniscus surgery is one of the most commonly performed orthopedic procedures 
worldwide. Modifiable risk factors for meniscus injury include body mass index, 
participation in athletics and occupation. Nonmodifiable risk factors include 
age, sex, lower extremity alignment, discoid meniscus, ligamentous laxity, and 
biconcave tibial plateau. Conditions commonly associated with meniscal injury 
are osteoarthritis, anterior cruciate ligament injury, and tibial plateau 
fractures. Tear type and location vary by patient age and functional status. 
Surgical management of meniscus injury is typically cost-effective in terms of 
quality-adjusted life years. The purpose of this review is to provide an 
overview of meniscal injury epidemiology by summarizing tear types and 
locations, associated conditions, and factors that increase the risk for 
meniscal injury. The economic burden of meniscus injury and strategies to 
prevent injury to the meniscus are also reviewed.

BACKGROUND: Exercise-based rehabilitation targeting intersegmental control has 
high success rates and fast recovery times in the management of athletic groin 
pain (AGP). The influence of this approach on hip strength and lower limb 
reactive strength and how these measures compare with uninjured athletes (CON) 
remain unknown. Additionally, the efficacy of this program after return to play 
(RTP) has not been examined.
PURPOSE: First, to examine differences in isometric hip strength, reactive 
strength, and the Hip and Groin Outcome Score (HAGOS) between the AGP and CON 
cohorts and after rehabilitation; second, to examine the relationship between 
the change in HAGOS and the change in strength variables after rehabilitation; 
last, to track HAGOS for 6 months after RTP.
STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 2.
METHODS: A total of 42 athletes diagnosed with AGP and 36 matched controls 
completed baseline testing: isometric hip strength, lower limb reactive 
strength, and HAGOS. After rehabilitation, athletes with AGP were retested, and 
HAGOS was collected at 3 and 6 months after RTP.
RESULTS: In total, 36 athletes with AGP completed the program with an RTP time 
of 9.8 ± 3.0 weeks (mean ± SD). At baseline, these athletes had significantly 
lower isometric hip strength (abduction, adduction, flexion, extension, external 
rotation: d = -0.67 to -1.20), single-leg reactive strength (d = -0.73), and 
HAGOS (r = -0.74 to -0.89) as compared with the CON cohort. Hip strength (d = 
-0.83 to -1.15) and reactive strength (d = -0.30) improved with rehabilitation 
and were no longer significantly different between groups at RTP. HAGOS 
improvements were maintained or improved in athletes with AGP up to 6 months 
after RTP, although some subscales remained significantly lower than the CON 
group (r = -0.35 to -0.51). Two linear regression features (hip abduction and 
external rotation) explained 11% of the variance in the HAGOS Sports and 
Recreation subscale.
CONCLUSION: Athletes with AGP demonstrated isometric hip strength and reactive 
strength deficits that resolved after an intersegmental control rehabilitation 
program; however, improved hip strength explained only 11% of improvement in the 
Sports and Recreation subscale. HAGOS improvements after pain-free RTP were 
maintained at 6 months.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Several studies have evaluated the effects of 
high-intensity aerobic training (HIAT) on pain severity and quality of life 
(QoL) among women with primary dysmenorrhea. However, to date, no studies have 
evaluated the effectiveness of HIAT on academic performance or absenteeism or 
examined the cost-effectiveness of HIAT relative to other treatments in women 
with primary dysmenorrhea. Furthermore, the mechanisms underlying aerobic 
exercise-induced analgesia in primary dysmenorrhea remain unclear. The 
objectives of this study are to: (1) evaluate the effects of HIAT on absenteeism 
and academic performance among university students, (2) identify the underlying 
mechanisms associated with aerobic exercise-induced analgesia in primary 
dysmenorrhea, and (3) determine the cost-effectiveness of HIAT compared with a 
wait-list control (WLC) group receiving usual care.
METHODS: A sequential, embedded, mixed-methods study design, including a 
crossover, randomised controlled trial (RCT) and semi-structured focus groups, 
will be conducted alongside an economic evaluation. A total of 130 women aged 
18-24 years will be randomised into either HIAT (n = 65) or wait-list control (n 
= 65) groups. Primary outcomes will include average pain intensity, absenteeism 
from university, and academic performance. Primary mediators will include 
salivary progesterone and prostaglandin F2α levels. Outcome and meditator 
variables will be assessed at baseline and post-treatment, at 12 and 28 weeks. 
An economic analysis will be conducted from the societal and healthcare 
perspective of Hong Kong. Semi-structured focus groups will be conducted at 32 
weeks. Of the 130 participants included in the RCT, 70 will be included in the 
focus groups.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: All statistical analyses will be performed on an 
intention-to-treat basis, using SPSS (version 24). Preliminary analysis using an 
independent samples t-test and a two-sided, unpaired Student's t-test will be 
performed to exclude carryover effects and identify within-participant 
differences in outcome variables between the study periods, respectively. 
Treatment effects will be evaluated using analysis of variance via a 
mixed-effects model with fixed effects for intervention, period, and sequence. 
In all models, random effects will include the participants nested within the 
sequence as a sampling cluster. The mediation effects will be assessed using the 
Sobel test. The EQ-5D responses will be converted into utility scores to 
estimate the gain or loss of quality-adjusted life-years. Seemingly unrelated 
regression analyses will be used to estimate the total cost differences and 
effect differences. Qualitative data will be analysed using the process of 
thematic analysis.

The present study aimed to investigate the effect of chitosan edible coating 
containing 0.15% oregano essential oil (OEO) or 0.60% cinnamon essential oil 
(CEO) on the quality characteristics and dynamic changes in the bacterial 
community of roast duck slices under modified atmosphere packaging (MAP, 30% 
CO2/70% N2) during 21 days of storage at 2 ± 2 °C. The results showed that the 
application of chitosan coating (CH) alone inhibited the growth of 
microorganisms and prevented lipid oxidation throughout storage. Moreover, the 
storage stability was further improved by including OEO or CEO, which lowered 
(P < 0.05) values for total viable count (TVC), Enterobacteriaceae, 
2-thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS) and total volatile basic 
nitrogen (TVB-N). Based on the microbiological results, the shelf-life of CH-OEO 
and CH-CEO treated roast duck slices was prolonged by at least 7 days compared 
to that of the control. In addition, packaging types applied in this study 
played a major role in the bacterial community development. Notably, Vibrio spp. 
were the most predominant bacteria in all samples, when TVC values approached 
the shelf-life threshold, suggesting that this bacterium may be the main 
contributor to the spoilage of roast duck. The growth inhibition of Vibrio spp. 
in the CH-OEO and CH-CEO treatments during the early period of chilled storage 
might be the reason for the extension of the shelf life. Taken together, CH 
incorporated with OEO or CEO could be developed as prospective edible packaging 
materials to preserve roast duck meat.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of spouses and the 
relevance of quality of life (QoL) and life expectancy (LE) in the treatment 
decision-making process of patients with advanced prostate cancer (CaP). We also 
addressed the role of possible mental deterioration, partnership quality, QoL, 
distress, anxiety, and depression in patients and their spouses.
METHODS AND MATERIAL: This was a cross-sectional non-interventional explorative 
study. We administered questionnaires to 96 patients with advanced CaPand their 
spouses. Both patients and their spouses were asked about the influence of the 
spouses on treatment decision making, if they prefer quality of life or life 
expectancy as main goal of treatment and the perceived deterioration of the 
patients' mental abilities. Additional questionnaires were used to assess 
medical history, partnership, global quality of life, distress, depression, and 
anxiety. We performed statistical tests to compare patients with spouses and 
correlations to detect associations between variables.
RESULTS: The spouses (65 ± 9 years) were significantly younger than the patients 
(69 ± 9 years). Ninety-five percent of the patients and 91% of the spouses 
reported that the spouses were involved in making treatment decisions. There was 
a high similarity within couples with regard to their preference for QoL or LE 
during treatment. Between couples, this preference differed markedly. Emotional 
control and motivation were the areas most commonly reported to have 
deteriorated among patients' mental abilities. The quality of the partnership 
was rated as being higher than average by both partners. Among the spouses, the 
quality of partnership correlated significantly with the preference for LE with 
regard to treatment decision making. Patients and spouses reported high 
psychological burdens in all areas, with higher levels of distress and anxiety 
in spouses (P< 0.01). Reduced quality of life and greater distress, depression, 
and anxiety were significantly correlated with the amount of deterioration of 
the patients' mental abilities.
CONCLUSIONS: Spouses of patients with advanced CaP seem to respond to different 
aspects of the disease by adjusting both their involvement in treatment decision 
making and their preferred goal of treatment. Due to mental deterioration in the 
patients and pronounced anxiety in their spouses, we suggest that it is 
important for the attending physician to provide detailed information and 
support to both partners. Overall, the high-stress situation seems to affect 
both partners to similar degrees.

There is a worldwide expansion in percutaneous therapy for valvular heart 
disease. Rapidly evolving technology and the general increase in life expectancy 
will support the evolution of new treatment options dedicated to structural 
heart interventions. Transcatheter aortic valve implantation for severe aortic 
valve stenosis and percutaneous mitral valve repair with the MitraClip system 
for severe mitral regurgitation have been demonstrated as a feasible, innovative 
alternative for surgical treatment. Despite the inequality in clinical 
experience, both procedures have encouraging results and now are a part of 
everyday clinical practice. More importantly, rapid development is expected in 
the next decades. However, the global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) 
pandemic imposed redistribution of healthcare resources. Hospitals were obliged 
to modify their workflow and limit TAVI and MitraClip procedures to urgent or in 
highly symptomatic patients. Despite this encumbrance improvement in technology 
and experience supported by robust evidence from current studies might extend 
indications for both procedures. The future holds promise for this treatment 
modality to become the preferred procedure for all patients despite age or risk 
and reserving surgical treatment for a minority. Thus, we present 
state-of-the-art and current evidence for both methods assumed to change the 
paradigm of treatment of valvular heart failure in the future.

BACKGROUND: This study aimed to examine the disease burden of North Korean 
defectors in South Korea by sex, age, and disease from 2000 to 2018 and to study 
the changes in the disease burden over time.
METHODS: Based on the incidence-based disability-adjusted life year (DALY) 
developed in a Korean National Burden of Disease (KNBD) study, we calculated the 
years of life lost (YLL), years lived with disability (YLD), and 
disability-adjusted life years (DALY) for approximately 22,753 North Korean 
defectors in South Korea whose claims data were available from the National 
Health Insurance Service (NHIS).
RESULTS: In 2018, the rates of YLL, YLD, and DALY for North Korean defectors per 
100,000 population was 3,763 (male 8,491; female 2,404), 37,683 (male 27,742; 
female 40,539), and 41,446 (male 36,233; female 42,943), respectively. Major 
depressive disorders constituted the highest DALY, followed by cirrhosis of the 
liver and low back pain. The disease burden of North Korean defectors 
consistently decreased from 2010 to 2018. The decrease in YLD contributed to the 
overall decline in DALY per 100,000 population in 2018, which decreased by 25.2% 
compared to that in 2010.
CONCLUSION: This is the first study to measure the disease burden of North 
Korean defectors in South Korea. Given the decreasing or substantially 
increasing trends in disease burden, it is necessary to establish appropriate 
public health policies in a timely manner, and the results of this study provide 
a basis for the development of customized public health and healthcare policies 
for North Korean defectors in South Korea.

The manufacture of DNA origami nanostructures with highly ordered functional 
motifs is of great significance for biomedical applications. Here, we present a 
robust strategy to produce customized scaffolds with integrated aptamer 
sequences, which enables direct construction of functional DNA origami 
structures. As we demonstrated, aptamers of various numbers and types were 
efficiently and stably integrated in user-defined positions of the scaffolds. 
Specifically, two different thrombin aptamer sequences were simultaneously 
inserted into the M13mp18 phage genome. The assembled functional DNA origami 
structures from this aptamer-integrated scaffold exhibited increased binding 
efficiency to thrombin and displayed more than 10-fold stronger resistance to 
exonuclease degradation than that produced using the traditional staple 
extension method. Additionally, a scaffold integrated with the platelet-derived 
growth factor aptamer was produced, and the assembled DNA origami structures 
showed significant inhibitory effect on breast cancer cells MDA-MB-231. This 
scalable method of creating design-specific scaffolds opens up a new way to 
construct more stable and functionally robust DNA origami structures and thus 
provides an important basis for their broader applications.

Trends in socioeconomic-related health inequalities is a particularly pertinent 
topic in South Africa where years of systematic discrimination under apartheid 
bequeathed a legacy of inequalities in health outcomes. We use three nationally 
representative datasets to examine trends in income- and race-related 
inequalities in life expectancy (LE) and health-adjusted life expectancy (HALE) 
since the beginning of the millennium. We find that, in aggregate, (HA)LE at age 
five fell substantially between 2001 and 2007, but then increased to above 2001 
levels by 2016, with the largest changes observed among prime age adults. 
Income- and race-related inequalities in both LE and HALE favor relatively 
well-off and non-Black South Africans in all survey years. Both income- and 
race-related inequalities in (HA)LE grew between 2001 and 2007, and then 
narrowed between 2007 to 2016. However, while race-related inequalities in 
(HA)LE in 2016 were smaller than in 2001, income-related inequalities in (HA)LE 
were greater in 2016 than in 2001. Based on the patterns and timing observed, 
these trends in income- and race-related inequalities in (HA)LE are most likely 
related to the delayed initial policy response to the HIV epidemic, the 
subsequent rapid and effective rollout of anti-retroviral therapy, and the 
changes in the overall income distribution among Black South Africans. In 
particular, the growth of the Black middle class narrowed the HA(LE) gap with 
the non-Black population but reinforced income-related inequalities.

AIM: In the UK, injectable medicines are often prepared and administered by 
nurses following the Injectable Medicines Guide (IMG). Our earlier study 
confirmed a higher frequency of correct administration with user-tested versus 
standard IMG guidelines. This current study aimed to model the 
cost-effectiveness of user-testing.
METHODS: The costs and cost-effectiveness of user-testing were explored by 
modifying an existing probabilistic decision-analytic model. The adapted model 
considered administration of intravenous voriconazole to hospital inpatients by 
nurses. It included 11 error types, their probability of detection and level of 
harm. Model inputs (including costs) were derived from our previous study and 
other published data. Monte Carlo simulation using 20,000 samples (sufficient 
for convergence) was performed with a 5-year time horizon from the perspective 
of the 121 NHS trusts and health boards that use the IMG. Sensitivity analyses 
were undertaken for the risk of a medication error and other sources of 
uncertainty.
RESULTS: The net monetary benefit at £20,000/quality-adjusted life year was 
£3,190,064 (95% credible interval (CrI): -346,709 to 8,480,665), favouring 
user-testing with a 96% chance of cost-effectiveness. Incremental cost-savings 
were £240,943 (95% CrI 43,527-491,576), also favouring user-tested guidelines 
with a 99% chance of cost-saving. The total user testing cost was £6317 (95% CrI 
6012-6627). These findings were robust to assumptions about a range of input 
parameters, but greater uncertainty was seen with a lower medication error risk.
CONCLUSIONS: User-testing of injectable medicines guidelines is a low-cost 
intervention that is highly likely to be cost-effective, especially for 
high-risk medicines.

Epidermolysis bullosa (EB) is a group of rare, inherited diseases characterized 
by skin fragility and multiorgan system involvement that presents many 
anesthetic challenges. Although the literature regarding anesthetic management 
focuses primarily on the pediatric population, as life expectancy improves, 
adult patients with EB are more frequently undergoing anesthesia in nonpediatric 
hospital settings. Safe anesthetic management of adult patients with EB requires 
familiarity with the complex and heterogeneous nature of this disease, 
especially with regard to complications that may worsen during adulthood. 
General, neuraxial, and regional anesthetics have all been used safely in 
patients with EB. A thorough preoperative evaluation is essential. Preoperative 
testing should be guided by EB subtype, clinical manifestations, and 
extracutaneous complications. Advanced planning and multidisciplinary 
coordination are necessary with regard to timing and operative plan. Meticulous 
preparation of the operating room and education of all perioperative staff 
members is critical. Intraoperatively, utmost care must be taken to avoid all 
adhesives, shear forces, and friction to the skin and mucosa. Special 
precautions must be taken with patient positioning, and standard anesthesia 
monitors must be modified. Airway management is often difficult, and progressive 
airway deterioration can occur in adults with EB over time. A smooth induction, 
emergence, and postoperative course are necessary to minimize blister formation 
from excess patient movement. With careful planning, preparation, and 
precautions, adult patients with EB can safely undergo anesthesia.

Corners States.

To assess trends in life expectancy and the contribution of specific causes of 
death to Native American-White longevity gaps in the Four Corners states, we 
used death records from the National Center for Health Statistics and population 
estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau from 1999-2017 to generate period life 
tables and decompose racial gaps in life expectancy. Native American-White life 
expectancy gaps narrowed between 2001 and 2012 but widened thereafter, reaching 
4.92 years among males and 2.06 years among females in 2015. The life expectancy 
disadvantage among Native American males was primarily attributable to motor 
vehicle accidents (0.96 years), liver disease (1.22 years), and diabetes (0.78 
years). These causes of deaths were also primary contributors to the gap among 
females, forming three successive waves of mortality that occurred in young 
adulthood, midlife, and late adulthood, respectively, among Native American 
males and females. Interventions to reduce motor vehicle accidents in early 
adulthood, alcohol-related mortality in midlife, and diabetes complications at 
older ages could reduce Native American-White longevity disparities in the Four 
Corners states.

BACKGROUND: Bread represents a significant share of food waste worldwide. The 
extension of the bread shelf life together with innovative systems of food waste 
treatment might decrease waste biomass decay, the need for transportation, and 
the need for storage. In recent years, insects have been selected as a valuable 
tool for food waste treatment owing to their capability to transform low-value 
food waste into biomass with high nutritional value. Bakery wastes can be used 
profitably for this purpose. This work had two objectives: (i) to measure the 
impact of flaxseed cake fortification on bread shelf life depending on the 
leavening agent (baker's yeast vs sourdough); (ii) to evaluate the possible 
reuse of the stale bread fortified with flaxseed cake for Tenebrio molitor 
rearing.
RESULTS: Our results showed that fortification seemed to slow the hardening rate 
of bread, particularly if baker's yeast was used. The time necessary for mold to 
appear in sourdough bread doubled (from 2 to 4 days). The addition of flaxseed 
cake to the recipe determined an increase of its scrap consumption by T. molitor 
larvae. We also observed a significant increase in the body mass of the T. 
molitor larvae fed with bread obtained with the brewer's yeast with respect to 
larvae fed with the sourdough.
CONCLUSION: Taken together, these preliminary data can indicate that sourdough 
bread fortified with 5% of flaxseed cake can represent a promising tool to 
reduce food waste and to recycle bread scraps by a novel zero-waste approach. ©

Cemental tear: Literature review, proposed classification and recommendations 
for treatment.

Cemental tears are an important condition of relevance to Endodontics but are 
often overlooked. A cemental tear is the partial or complete detachment of the 
cementum from the cemento-dentinal junction or along the incremental line within 
the body of cementum. The limited attention received is most likely due to the 
limited awareness amongst dental professionals and challenges in accurately 
diagnosing them, resulting in misdiagnosis and erroneous treatment. The aim of 
this review is to describe the: (i) epidemiology and predisposing factors; (ii) 
clinical, radiographic and histological features and (iii) the clinical 
management and treatment outcomes of cemental tear. The review included 37 
articles published in English that comprised eight observational studies and 29 
case reports. The prevalence of cemental tears was reported to be lower than 2%; 
whilst the incidence remains unknown. Internal factors due to the inherent 
structural weakness of cementum and its interface with the dentine, and external 
factors that are associated with stress have been proposed as the two mechanisms 
responsible for the development and propagation of cemental tears. Predisposing 
factors that have been implicated were tooth type, gender, age, previous root 
canal treatment, history of dental trauma, occlusal trauma and excessive 
occlusal force; however, evidence is limited. Common clinical and radiographic 
manifestations of cemental tears resemble the presentations of primary 
endodontic diseases, primary periodontal diseases and combined 
endodontic-periodontal lesions. Clinical management tended to focus on complete 
removal of the torn fragments and periodontal treatment, often combined with 
regenerative treatment. In this article, a new classification for cemental tears 
is developed that consists of classes 0 to 6 and stages A, B, C and D based on 
the: (i) location and accessibility of the torn cemental fragment; (ii) the 
pattern and extension of the associated bony defect in relation to the root 
length and (iii) the number of root surface/s affected by the cemental tear/s 
and the associated bony defect. Recommendations for treatment strategies are 
also provided and linked to the classification to aid in streamlining the 
process of treatment decision making.

Seafood spoilage can be prevented by inhibiting the quorum sensing (QS) system 
between bacteria. However, membrane materials combining freshness indicators 
with QS inhibition features have rarely been reported. Therefore, in this study, 
pH-sensitive polylactic acid-naringin coaxial electrospun fibers capable of 
maintaining and monitoring freshness were prepared and investigated. Surface 
analysis revealed that the fiber membranes exhibited a smooth surface and an 
average diameter of 243 nm. FTIR spectroscopy analysis revealed characteristic 
absorption peaks at 3265 and 1124 cm-1, confirming the successful loading of 
naringin and bromocresol purple. Release behavior analysis verified the 
uninterrupted release of naringin within 192 h, which enabled the fibers to 
achieve a protease inhibitory activity rate of 35.94%. Furthermore, the coaxial 
fibers successfully inhibited the expression of rhlI, rhlR, aprA, and fliA in 
Pseudomonas fluorescens. The real-world applicability of the coaxial fibers was 
evaluated by the salmon spoilage assay, where a 4-d extension to the shelf life 
of the coated fillets was attained. Additionally, the color of the coaxial 
fibers changed with the deterioration of salmon quality and the ΔE value 
increased from 4.75 to 26.51. These results verify that the prepared fibers can 
effectively monitor the freshness of seafood products and improve their storage 
conditions.

Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) such as imatinib, nilotinib, dasatinib, and 
ponatinib have significantly improved the life expectancy of Philadelphia 
chromosome-positive (Ph+) acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) patients; however, 
resistance to TKIs remains a major clinical challenge. Point mutations in the 
tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) of BCR-ABL1 have emerged as the predominant cause 
of acquired resistance. In approximately 30% of patients, the mechanism of 
resistance to TKIs remains elusive. This study aimed to investigate mechanisms 
of nonmutational resistance in Ph+ ALL. Here we report the development of a 
nonmutational resistance cell line SupB15-RT; conferring resistance to approved 
ABL kinase inhibitors (AKIs) and allosteric inhibitors GNF-2, ABL001, and 
crizotinib, except for dasatinib (IC90 50nM), a multitarget kinase inhibitor. We 
found that the AKT/mTOR pathway is activated in these cells and their 
proliferation inhibited by Torin-1 with an IC50 of 24.7 nM. These observations 
were confirmed using 3 different ALL patient-derived long term cultures 
(PDLTCs): (1) HP (BCR-ABL1 negative), (2) PH (BCR-ABL1 positive and responsive 
to TKIs) and (3) BV (BCR-ABL1 positive and nonmutational resistant to TKIs). 
Furthermore, Torin-1 and NVP-BEZ235 induced apoptosis in PH and BV cells but not 
in HP cells. Our experiments provide evidence of the involvement of AKT/mTOR 
pathway in the evolution of nonmutational resistance in Ph+ ALL which will 
assist in developing novel targeted therapy for Ph+ ALL patients with BCR-ABL1 
independent nonmutational resistance.

We reviewed the recent literature related to primary musculoskeletal tumors and 
metastatic bone tumors. With regard to primary bone tumors, computer navigation 
systems and three-dimensional-printed prostheses seem to be new treatment 
options, especially in challenging anatomical locations, such as the sacrum and 
pelvis. Regarding the treatment of giant cell tumor of bone, recent studies have 
suggested that denosumab administration is related to a higher local recurrence 
rate following curettage, but a lower local recurrence rate following en bloc 
resection. In addition, there was no difference in the local recurrence rate at 
five years after surgery between short-term and long-term denosumab therapy. 
With regard to soft tissue tumors, percutaneous cryoablation appears to be a new 
treatment option for extra-abdominal desmoid tumors, with encouraging results. 
Regarding soft tissue sarcomas, a negative surgical margin of < 1 mm is 
sufficient to control local recurrence. Pexidartinib seems to be a promising 
systemic therapy for the treatment of tenosynovial giant cell tumors for which 
surgery is not expected to improve the function of the affected limb. Finally, 
the life expectancy of patients is the most important factor in determining the 
optimal surgical procedure for patients with impending or pathological fractures
