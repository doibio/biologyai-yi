BACKGROUND: There are too many plausible permutations and scale-up scenarios of 
combination hepatitis C virus (HCV) interventions for exhaustive testing in 
experimental trials. Therefore, we used a computer simulation to project the 
health and economic impacts of alternative combination intervention scenarios 
for people who inject drugs (PWID), focusing on direct antiviral agents (DAA) 
and medication-assisted treatment combined with syringe access programs (MAT+).
METHODS: We performed an allocative efficiency study, using a mathematical model 
to simulate the progression of HCV in PWID and its related consequences. We 
combined 2 previously validated simulations to estimate the cost-effectiveness 
of intervention strategies that included a range of coverage levels. Analyses 
were performed from a health-sector and societal perspective, with a 15-year 
time horizon and a discount rate of 3%.
RESULTS: From a health-sector perspective (excluding criminal justice 
system-related costs), 4 potential strategies fell on the cost-efficiency 
frontier. At 20% coverage, DAAs had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
(ICER) of $27 251/quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). Combinations of DAA at 20% 
with MAT+ at 20%, 40%, and 80% coverage had ICERs of $165 985/QALY, $325 
860/QALY, and $399 189/QALY, respectively. When analyzed from a societal 
perspective (including criminal justice system-related costs), DAA at 20% with 
MAT+ at 80% was the most effective intervention and was cost saving. While DAA 
at 20% with MAT+ at 80% was more expensive (eg, less cost saving) than MAT+ at 
80% alone without DAA, it offered a favorable value compared to MAT+ at 80% 
alone ($23 932/QALY).
CONCLUSIONS: When considering health-sector costs alone, DAA alone was the most 
cost-effective intervention. However, with criminal justice system-related 
costs, DAA and MAT+ implemented together became the most cost-effective 
intervention.

Injured axons fail to regenerate in the adult CNS, which contrasts with their 
vigorous growth during embryonic development. We explored the potential of 
re-initiating axon extension after injury by reactivating the molecular 
mechanisms that drive morphogenetic transformation of neurons during 
development. Genetic loss- and gain-of-function experiments followed by 
time-lapse microscopy, in vivo imaging, and whole-mount analysis show that axon 
regeneration is fueled by elevated actin turnover. Actin depolymerizing factor 
(ADF)/cofilin controls actin turnover to sustain axon regeneration after spinal 
cord injury through its actin-severing activity. This pinpoints ADF/cofilin as a 
key regulator of axon growth competence, irrespective of developmental stage. 
These findings reveal the central role of actin dynamics regulation in this 
process and elucidate a core mechanism underlying axon growth after CNS trauma. 
Thereby, neurons maintain the capacity to stimulate developmental programs 
during adult life, expanding their potential for plasticity. Thus, actin 
turnover is a key process for future regenerative interventions.

Threat-related emotional function is supported by a neural circuit that includes 
the prefrontal cortex (PFC), hippocampus, and amygdala. The function of this 
neural circuit is altered by negative life experiences, which can potentially 
affect threat-related emotional processes. Notably, Black-American individuals 
disproportionately endure negative life experiences compared to White-American 
individuals. However, the relationships among negative life experiences, race, 
and the neural substrates that support threat-related emotional function remains 
unclear. Therefore, the current study investigated whether the brain function 
that supports threat-related emotional processes varies with racial differences 
in negative life experiences. In the present study, adolescent violence 
exposure, family income, and neighborhood disadvantage were measured 
prospectively (i.e., at 11-19 years of age) for Black-American and 
White-American volunteers. Participants then, as young adults (i.e., 18-23 years 
of age), completed a Pavlovian fear conditioning task during functional magnetic 
resonance imaging (fMRI). Cued and non-cued threats were presented during the 
conditioning task and behavioral (threat expectancy) and psychophysiological 
responses (skin conductance response; SCR) were recorded simultaneously with 
fMRI. Racial differences were observed in neural (fMRI activity), behavioral 
(threat expectancy), and psychophysiological (SCR) responses to threat. These 
threat-elicited responses also varied with negative life experiences (violence 
exposure, family income, and neighborhood disadvantage). Notably, racial 
differences in brain activity to threat were smaller after accounting for 
negative life experiences. The present findings suggest that racial differences 
in the neural and behavioral response to threat are due, in part, to exposure to 
negative life experiences and may provide new insight into the mechanisms 
underlying racial disparities in mental health.

BACKGROUND: Our aim was to assess both the credibility and strength of evidence 
arising from systematic reviews with meta-analyses of observational studies and 
physical health outcomes associated with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) but 
not acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.
METHODS: We performed an umbrella review of observational studies. Evidence was 
graded as convincing, highly suggestive, suggestive, weak, or nonsignificant.
RESULTS: From 3413 studies returned, 20 were included, covering 55 health 
outcomes. Median number of participants was 18 743 (range 403-225 000 000). 
Overall, 45 (81.8%) of the 55 unique outcomes reported nominally significant 
summary results (P < .05). Only 5 outcomes (9.0%; higher likelihood of presence 
of breathlessness, higher chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD] 
prevalence, maternal sepsis, higher risk of anemia, and higher risk of all 
fractures among people living with HIV [PLWHIV]) showed suggestive evidence, 
with P values < 10-3; only 3 (5.5%; higher prevalence of cough in 
cross-sectional studies, higher incidence of pregnancy-related mortality, and 
higher incidence of ischemic heart disease among PLWHIV in cohort studies) 
outcomes showed stronger evidence using a stringent P value (<10-6). None of the 
unique outcomes presented convincing evidence (Class I), yet 3 outcomes 
presented highly suggestive evidence, 5 outcomes presented suggestive evidence, 
and 37 outcomes presented weak evidence.
CONCLUSIONS: Results show highly suggestive and suggestive evidence for HIV and 
the presence of a cough, COPD, ischemic heart disease, pregnancy-related 
mortality, maternal sepsis, and bone fractures. Public health policies should 
reflect and accommodate these changes, especially in light of the increases in 
the life expectancy and the incidence of comorbidities in this population.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Gastrinomas are the most prevalent functioning 
neuroendocrine tumors (NET) in multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1). 
Guidelines suggest medical therapy in most patients, but surgery may be 
considered in a subgroup. Currently, factors to guide management are necessary. 
This population-based cohort study assessed prognostic factors of survival in 
patients with MEN1-related gastrinomas.
METHODS: Patients with MEN1 having gastrinomas were identified in the Dutch MEN1 
database from 1990 to 2014 based on fasting serum gastrin (FSG) levels and/or 
pathology. Predictors of overall survival were assessed using Cox regression.
RESULTS: Sixty-three patients with gastrinoma (16% of the MEN1 population) were 
identified. Five- and 10-year overall survival rates were 83% and 65%, 
respectively. Prognostic factors associated with overall survival were initial 
FSG levels ≥20x upper limit of normal (ULN) (hazard ratio [HR], 6.2 [95% 
confidence interval, 1.7-23.0]), pancreatic NET ≥2 cm (HR 4.5; [1.5-13.1]), 
synchronous liver metastases (HR 8.9; [2.1-36.7]), gastroduodenoscopy suspicious 
for gastric NETs (HR 12.7; [1.4-115.6]), and multiple concurrent NETs (HR 5.9; 
[1.2-27.7]).
CONCLUSION: Life expectancy of patients with MEN1 gastrinoma is reduced. FSG 
levels and pancreatic NETs ≥2 cm are prognostic factors. FSG levels might guide 
surveillance intensity, step-up to additional diagnostics, or provide arguments 
in selecting patients who might benefit from surgery.

INTRODUCTION: We develop a framework to model disease progression across 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) and to assess the cost-effectiveness of future 
disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) for people with mild cognitive impairment 
(MCI) due to AD.
METHODS: Using data from the US National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center, we 
apply survival analysis to estimate transition from predementia to AD dementia 
and ordered probit regression to estimate transitions across AD dementia stages. 
We investigate the cost-effectiveness of a hypothetical treatment scenario for 
people in MCI due to AD.
RESULTS: We present an open-access model-based decision-analytic framework. 
Assuming a modest DMT treatment effect in MCI, we predict extended life 
expectancy and a reduction in time with AD dementia.
DISCUSSION: Any future DMT for AD is expected to pose significant economic 
challenges across all health-care systems, and decision-analytic modeling will 
be required to assess costs and outcomes. Further developments are needed to 
inform these health policy considerations.

OBJECTIVE: To explore how community social ecology factors may be associated 
with country registered nurse/registered midwife (RN/RM) workforce supply and 
reproductive health globally.
DESIGN: A cross-sectional design using a social ecology framework was employed.
SAMPLE: Data were retrieved from publicly available websites for 107 countries.
MEASUREMENTS: Dependent variables included RN/RM density, maternal mortality 
ratios (MMR), and adolescent birth rates (ABR). Independent variables included 
gender inequality, region, country income classification, education, gross 
domestic product per capita, government expenditure of spending on education and 
health, life expectancy, percent of female seats in legislature, and labor force 
participation factors.
RESULTS: The best fit multivariable model of RN/RM density showed that after 
adjustment for region, country income and the GII, the percent of females with 
some secondary education explained most of variation in RN/RM density. The best 
fit models of MMR and ABR showed that gender inequality explained most of the 
variation. Other factors in the models were the percent of female seats in 
legislatures, region, country income class, and mean years of schooling.
CONCLUSIONS: Employing a social ecology model can useful in RN/RM workforce 
planning and development as countries seek multisectoral strategies for 
increasing the RN/RM supply and improving reproductive health outcomes.

INTRODUCTION: Promising HIV vaccine candidates are steadily progressing through 
the clinical trial pipeline. Once available, HIV vaccines will be an important 
complement but also potential competitor to other biomedical prevention tools 
such as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). Accordingly, the value of HIV vaccines 
and the policies for rollout may depend on that interplay and tradeoffs with 
utilization of existing products. In this economic modelling analysis, we 
estimate the cost-effectiveness of HIV vaccines considering their potential 
interaction with PrEP and condom use.
METHODS: We developed a dynamic model of HIV transmission among the men who have 
sex with men population (MSM), aged 15-64 years, in Seattle, WA offered PrEP and 
HIV vaccine over a time horizon of 2025-2045. A healthcare sector perspective 
with annual discount rate of 3% for costs (2017 USD) and quality-adjusted life 
years (QALYs) was used. The primary economic endpoint is the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) when compared to no HIV vaccine availability.
RESULTS: HIV vaccines improved population health and increased healthcare costs. 
Vaccination campaigns achieving 90% coverage of high-risk men and 60% coverage 
of other men within five years of introduction are projected to avoid 40% of new 
HIV infections between 2025 and 2045. This increased total healthcare costs by 
$30 million, with some PrEP costs shifted to HIV vaccine spending. HIV vaccines 
are estimated to have an ICER of $42,473/QALY, considered cost-effective using a 
threshold of $150,000/QALY. Results were most sensitive to HIV vaccine efficacy 
and future changes in the cost of PrEP drugs. Sensitivity analysis found ranges 
of 30-70% HIV vaccine efficacy remained cost-effective. Results were also 
sensitive to reductions in condom use among PrEP and vaccine users.
CONCLUSIONS: Access to an HIV vaccine is desirable as it could increase the 
overall effectiveness of combination HIV prevention efforts and improve 
population health. Planning for the rollout and scale-up of HIV vaccines should 
carefully consider the design of policies that guide interactions between 
vaccine and PrEP utilization and potential competition.

STUDY OBJECTIVES: To determine cost-effectiveness of continuous positive airway 
pressure (CPAP) treatment of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in Australia for 
2017-2018 to facilitate public health decision-making.
METHODS: Analysis was undertaken of direct per-person costs of CPAP therapy 
(according to 5-year care pathways), health system and other costs of OSA and 
its comorbidities averted by CPAP treatment (5-year adherence rate 56.7%) and 
incremental benefit of therapy (in terms of disability-adjusted life years 
[DALYs] averted) to determine cost-effectiveness of CPAP. This was expressed as 
the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (= dollars per DALY averted). Direct 
costs of CPAP were estimated from government reimbursements for services and 
advertised equipment costs. Costs averted were calculated from both the health 
care system perspective (health system costs only) and societal perspective 
(health system plus other financial costs including informal care, productivity 
losses, nonmedical accident costs, deadweight taxation and welfare losses). 
These estimates of costs (expressed in US dollars) and DALYs averted were based 
on our recent analyses of costs of untreated OSA.
RESULTS: From the health care system perspective, estimated cost of CPAP therapy 
to treat OSA was $12 495 per DALY averted while from a societal perspective the 
effect was dominant (-$10 688 per DALY averted) meaning it costs more not to 
treat the problem than to treat it.
CONCLUSIONS: These estimates suggest substantial community investment in 
measures to more systematically identify and treat OSA is justified. Apart from 
potential health and well-being benefits, it is financially prudent to do so.

BACKGROUND: The number of patients waiting to receive a kidney transplant 
outstrips the supply of donor organs. We sought to quantify trade-offs 
associated with different approaches to deceased donor kidney allocation in 
terms of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), costs, and access to 
transplantation.
METHODS: An individual patient simulation model was developed to compare 5 
different approaches to kidney allocation, including the 2006 UK National Kidney 
Allocation Scheme (NKAS) and a QALY maximization approach designed to maximize 
health gains from a limited supply of donor organs. We used various sources of 
patient-level data to develop multivariable regression models to predict 
survival, health state utilities, and costs. We simulated the allocation of 
kidneys from 2200 deceased donors to a waiting list of 5500 patients and 
produced estimates of total lifetime costs and QALYs for each allocation scheme.
RESULTS: Among patients who received a transplant, the QALY maximization 
approach generated 48 045 QALYs and cost £681 million, while the 2006 NKAS 
generated 44 040 QALYs and cost £625 million. When also taking into 
consideration outcomes for patients who were not prioritized to receive a 
transplant, the 2006 NKAS produced higher total QALYs and costs and an 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of £110 741/QALY compared with the QALY 
maximization approach.
CONCLUSIONS: Compared with the 2006 NKAS, a QALY maximization approach makes 
more efficient use of deceased donor kidneys but reduces access to 
transplantation for older patients and results in greater inequity in the 
distribution of health gains between patients who receive a transplant and 
patients who remain on the waiting list.

Before the development of the first vaccine, infectious diseases were a major 
cause of death around the globe with life expectancy estimated to be <50 years. 
Three measures have helped to drastically reduce the burden of infectious 
diseases but only vaccines have proven to be able to eradicate infectious 
agents. Herein, we describe new methodologies that have paved the way for what 
is currently known as modern vaccinology and the use of vaccines to tackle 
antimicrobial resistance, the biggest global threat of our time.

BACKGROUND: Few reports have focused on chronic subdural hematoma (CSDH) in the 
very elderly, who have lived beyond average life expectancy. Our aim is to 
appraise treatment outcomes of burr-hole craniotomy for CSDH in the elderly, 
focusing on cure, recurrence, and complications.
METHODS: Fifty patients ≤79 years of age (group A) and 73 patients ≥80 years of 
age (group B) were studied. Recurrence was defined as requiring reoperation for 
hematoma regrowth or symptomatic failure. A cure was regarded as having been 
achieved in the absence of hematoma on postoperative computed tomography. 
Complications were defined as any harmful event related to the treatment 
procedure for CSDH.
RESULTS: Cure was documented in 31 patients in group A (63%) and 24 patients in 
group B (33%) (P = 0.0017). Median intervals to cure were 2.76 and 3.73 months, 
respectively (P = 0.06). Cumulative cure rates were 51%/76% and 36%/59%, 
respectively, at the sixth/twelfth postoperative months. Recurrence was 
documented in 2 patients (4%) and 11 patients (15%), respectively (P = 0.07). 
Median intervals to recurrence were 0.81 and 1.25 months, respectively (P = 
0.049). Cumulative recurrence-free rates were 96%/92% and 87%/75%, respectively, 
at the third/sixth postoperative months. Complications were observed in 2 
patients (4%) and 4 patients (5%), respectively (P = 1.00).
CONCLUSIONS: With advancing age, CSDH might show a greater tendency to recur and 
a longer time is required to achieve a cure. However, complications developed 
only in high-risk patients. Thus, surgical treatment for CSDH in elderly 
patients, even those who have lived beyond life expectancy, might provide 
acceptably effective results.

Solid-state nanochannels have great potentials in the vibrant field of 
photoelectrochemical (PEC) bioanalysis. This work herein demonstrates the 
innovative use of DNA-decorated nanoporous anodic alumina (NAA) nanochannels for 
sensitive PEC bioanalysis of telomerase (TE) activity. Specifically, telomerase 
primer sequences (TS) were initially immobilized within the NAA nanochannels and 
then extended by TE in the presence of deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates 
(dNTPs). The as formed single-strand DNA was then directed to hybrid with many 
partially matched single-strand assisting DNA (aDNA), leading to the formation 
of multiple DNAzymes by the unmatched parts and the subsequent 
DNAzyme-stimulated biocatalytic precipitation (BCP) within the nanochannels. 
Because the inhibited signals of the photoelectrode could be correlated with 
TE-enabled TS extension, an innovative nanochannels PEC bioanalysis could be 
realized for probing TE activity. This work features the ingenious use of 
DNA-associated nanochannels for PEC bioanalysis of TE activity. Given the 
versatile functions of DNA molecules, the extension of this strategy easily 
allows for addressing numerous other targets of interest. Also, we envision this 
work could inspire more interest for the further development of nanochannels PEC 
bioanalysis.

Testicular volume (TV) is one of the most important traits used in evaluation of 
the reproductive capacity of male animals. The levelled-container used in the 
present study was found to be reliable instrument to measure TV, based on a 
water displacement method. Sperm-associated antigen 11 (SPAG11) is an important 
gene that affects male reproductive performance. An objective of the present 
study, therefore, was to determine if single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 
a fragment of the SPAG11 gene could be used to determine associations with 
values of testicular biometric variables in Boer goats. Primers were designed to 
amplify the full length of the first two exons of SPAG11. The targeted fragment 
was generated using a molecular cloning technique. As the result, four SNPs, 
[g.1256A > G(ss19199134542), g.1270C > T(ss19199134541), 
g.1325A > G(ss19199134540) and g.1327 G > A (ss19199134543)], were detected 
using a single-base extension (SBE) method. Two of these SNPs were synonymous 
(ss19199134540 and ss19199134542). The other two SNPs were nonsynonymous, thus, 
there were changes in amino acid in the resulting protein: threonine to 
isoleucine (for ss19199134541) and arginine to glutamine (for ss19199134543). 
The SNP ss19199134543 was the only locus detected that was associated with TV 
(P = 0.002). None of the testes dimensions nor TW were associated with detected 
SPAG11 gene SNPs. Most likely, the ss19199134543 locus affects tissue structures 
adjacent to the testes, causing the change in TV. In conclusion, among the 
studied testicular biometric variables, TV had the greatest potential for 
preselecting of bucks with desirable semen quality. The use of the 
levelled-container as a TV measurement approach was an accurate and reliable 
method.

BACKGROUND: The clinical activity of fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) 
inhibitors seems restricted to cancers harbouring rare FGFR genetic aberrations. 
In preclinical studies, high tumour FGFR mRNA expression predicted response to 
rogaratinib, an oral pan-FGFR inhibitor. We aimed to assess the safety, maximum 
tolerated dose, recommended phase 2 dose, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary 
clinical activity of rogaratinib.
METHODS: We did a phase 1 dose-escalation and dose-expansion study of 
rogaratinib in adults with advanced cancers at 22 sites in Germany, Switzerland, 
South Korea, Singapore, Spain, and France. Eligible patients were aged 18 years 
or older, and were ineligible for standard therapy, with an Eastern Cooperative 
Oncology Group performance status of 0-2, a life expectancy of at least 3 
months, and at least one measurable or evaluable lesion according to Response 
Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1. During dose 
escalation, rogaratinib was administered orally twice daily at 50-800 mg in 
continuous 21-day cycles using a model-based dose-response analysis (continuous 
reassessment method). In the dose-expansion phase, all patients provided an 
archival formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumour biopsy or consented to a 
new biopsy at screening for the analysis of FGFR1-3 mRNA expression. In the 
dose-expansion phase, rogaratinib was given at the recommended dose for 
expansion to patients in four cohorts: urothelial carcinoma, head and neck 
squamous-cell cancer (HNSCC), non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and other 
solid tumour types. Primary endpoints were safety and tolerability, 
determination of maximum tolerated dose including dose-limiting toxicities and 
determination of recommended phase 2 dose, and pharmacokinetics of rogaratinib. 
Safety analyses were reported in all patients who received at least one dose of 
rogaratinib. Patients who completed cycle 1 or discontinued during cycle 1 due 
to an adverse event or dose-limiting toxicity were included in the evaluation of 
recommended phase 2 dose. Efficacy analyses were reported for all patients who 
received at least one dose of study drug and who had available post-baseline 
efficacy data. This ongoing study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number 
NCT01976741, and is fully recruited.
FINDINGS: Between Dec 30, 2013, and July 5, 2017, 866 patients were screened for 
FGFR mRNA expression, of whom 126 patients were treated (23 FGFR mRNA-unselected 
patients in the dose-escalation phase and 103 patients with FGFR 
mRNA-overexpressing tumours [52 patients with urothelial carcinoma, eight 
patients with HNSCC, 20 patients with NSCLC, and 23 patients with other tumour 
types] in the dose-expansion phase). No dose-limiting toxicities were reported 
and the maximum tolerated dose was not reached; 800 mg twice daily was 
established as the recommended phase 2 dose and was selected for the 
dose-expansion phase. The most common adverse events of any grade were 
hyperphosphataemia (in 77 [61%] of 126 patients), diarrhoea (in 65 [52%]), and 
decreased appetite (in 48 [38%]); and the most common grade 3-4 adverse events 
were fatigue (in 11 [9%] of 126 patients) and asymptomatic increased lipase (in 
10 [8%]). Serious treatment-related adverse events were reported in five 
patients (decreased appetite and diarrhoea in one patient with urothelial 
carcinoma, and acute kidney injury [NSCLC], hypoglycaemia [other solid tumours], 
retinopathy [urothelial carcinoma], and vomiting [urothelial carcinoma] in one 
patient each); no treatment-related deaths occurred. Median follow-up after 
cessation of treatment was 32 days (IQR 25-36 days). In the expansion cohorts, 
15 (15%; 95% CI 8·6-23·5) out of 100 evaluable patients achieved an objective 
response, with responses recorded in all four expansion cohorts (12 in the 
urothelial carcinoma cohort and one in each of the other three cohorts), and in 
ten (67%) of 15 FGFR mRNA-overexpressing tumours without apparent FGFR genetic 
aberration.
INTERPRETATION: Rogaratinib was well tolerated and clinically active against 
several types of cancer. Selection by FGFR mRNA expression could be a useful 
additional biomarker to identify a broader patient population who could be 
eligible for FGFR inhibitor treatment.

Collagens carry out critical extracellular matrix (ECM) functions by interacting 
with numerous cell receptors and ECM components. Single glycine substitutions in 
collagen III, which predominates in vascular walls, result in vascular 
Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (vEDS), leading to arterial, uterine, and intestinal 
rupture and an average life expectancy of <50 years. Collagen interactions with 
integrin α2β1 are vital for platelet adhesion and activation; however, how these 
interactions are impacted by vEDS-associated mutations and by specific amino 
acid substitutions is unclear. Here, we designed collagen-mimetic peptides 
(CMPs) with previously reported Gly → Xaa (Xaa = Ala, Arg, or Val) vEDS 
substitutions within a high-affinity integrin α2β1-binding motif, GROGER. We 
used these peptides to investigate, at atomic-level resolution, how these amino 
acid substitutions affect the collagen III-integrin α2β1 interaction. Using a 
multitiered approach combining biological adhesion assays, CD, NMR, and 
molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we found that these substitutions 
differentially impede human mesenchymal stem cell spreading and integrin 
α2-inserted (α2I) domain binding to the CMPs and were associated with 
triple-helix destabilization. Although an Ala substitution locally destabilized 
hydrogen bonding and enhanced mobility, it did not significantly reduce the 
CMP-integrin interactions. MD simulations suggested that bulkier Gly → Xaa 
substitutions differentially disrupt the CMP-α2I interaction. The Gly → Arg 
substitution destabilized CMP-α2I side-chain interactions, and the Gly → Val 
change broke the essential Mg2+ coordination. The relationship between the loss 
of functional binding and the type of vEDS substitution provides a foundation 
for developing potential therapies for managing collagen disorders.

Fasting and rapamycin: diabetes versus benevolent glucose intolerance.

Rapamycin (Sirolimus) slows aging, extends life span, and prevents age-related 
diseases, including diabetic complications such as retinopathy. Puzzlingly, 
rapamycin can induce insulin sensitivity, but may also induce insulin resistance 
or glucose intolerance without insulin resistance. This mirrors the effect of 
fasting and very low calorie diets, which improve insulin sensitivity and 
reverse type 2 diabetes, but also can cause a form of glucose intolerance known 
as benevolent pseudo-diabetes. There is no indication that starvation
