Background: Unplanned readmissions or emergency visits (EVs) after discharge 
from hospital are frequent in patients in palliative care. Strategies to 
anticipate and prevent rapid deterioration of health are needed. Objective: 
Assessing feasibility and predictive ability of remote monitoring using 
wearables. Design: Prospective observational feasibility study in a single 
center. Setting/Subjects: Thirty cancer patients with an estimated life 
expectancy of >8 weeks to <12 months, aged >18 years and being discharged from 
inpatient to outpatient care were included. Measurements: Patients were provided 
with a smartphone, including the preinstalled "Activity Monitoring" application 
and a sensor-equipped bracelet. Follow-up was 12 weeks. Both devices recorded 
several features (e.g., vital signs). Visual analog scale (VAS) for pain and 
distress was reported once daily and European Organization for Research and 
Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) once 
weekly. Statistical methods were applied to explore relationship between sensor 
data, self-reports, and EVs or readmissions or death. Results: Between February 
2017 and May 2018, 30 patients were included. Twenty-five of 30 participants 
(83%) completed 12 weeks of follow-up. On average, bracelet was worn on 53% and 
smartphone on 85% of study days. Completion rate of daily digital questionnaires 
for subjective ratings was 73%. Eight unplanned hospital readmissions occurred. 
Ratings of pain, distress, and QLQ-C30 scores were not associated with 
readmission, whereas resting heart rate, resting heart rate variability, as well 
as speed of steps differed significantly in patients with and without 
readmission. Conclusions: Monitoring of palliative cancer patients using 
wearables is feasible. First results indicate that mobile health features might 
be promising biomarkers to predict unplanned readmissions.

Caries and periodontitis are the primary non-communicable oral diseases among 
elderly individuals. The burden of the disease increases with ageing, 
particularly as the elderly are tending to retain more teeth due to improvement 
of oral health measures and increased life expectancy. Root caries represents 
itself as an overlapping pathology, but not necessarily a summation of the two 
diseases. This narrative commentary discusses the cross-boundary nature of root 
caries, a periodontal-cariological condition, taking into account the 
multi-morbidities of ageing. The evidence includes epidemiological and 
pathophysiological features of root caries, and specific influencing factors of 
ageing, such as xerostomia, polypharmacy, functional and cognitive impairment 
and oral ecological alterations. Active or previous history of periodontal 
disease poses a risk for root caries, whereas the systemic co-morbidities of 
ageing may also increase the susceptibility to this pathology. It is plausible 
that root caries is the net outcome of coexisting risk for these conditions. 
There exists no standardised system for risk assessment and diagnosis that takes 
into account the interactive effect of caries, periodontitis and the 
constellation of age-specific influencing factors. As restorative treatment is 
challenging, cost-effective prevention and diagnosis methods are needed for 
vulnerable elderly populations. These may include improved clinical registration 
methods and establishment of individualised prevention and treatment protocols.

SUMMARY: State-of-the-art repeat analysis tools rely on extending maximal 
repeated pairs to enumerate maximal k-mismatch repeats. These pairs can be 
quadratic in n, the length of the input sequence, and thus greedy heuristics are 
applied to speed up the extension. Here, we introduce supermaximal k-mismatch 
repeats, which are linear in n and capture all maximal k-mismatch repeats: every 
maximal k-mismatch repeat is a substring of some supermaximal k-mismatch repeat. 
We present SMART, a tool based on recent algorithmic advances implemented in C++ 
to compute supermaximal k-mismatch repeats directly, and show that these 
elements are statistically much more significant than the output of the 
state-of-the-art.

BACKGROUND: Whether worldwide increases in life expectancy are accompanied by a 
better health status is still a debate. People age differently, and there is a 
need to disentangle whether healthy-ageing pathways can be shaped by cohort 
effects. This study aims to analyse trends in health status in two large 
nationally representative samples of older adults from England and the USA.
METHODS: The sample comprised 55 684 participants from the first seven waves of 
the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA), and the first 11 waves of the 
Health and Retirement Study (HRS). A common latent health score based on 
Bayesian multilevel item response theory was used. Two Bayesian mixed-effects 
multilevel models were used to assess cohort effects on health in ELSA and HRS 
separately, controlling for the effect of household wealth and educational 
attainment.
RESULTS: Similar ageing trends were found in ELSA (β = -0.311; p < 0.001) and 
HRS (β = -0.393; p < 0.001). The level of education moderated the life-course 
effect on health in both ELSA (β = -0.082; p < 0.05) and HRS (β = -0.084; 
p < 0.05). A birth-year effect was found for those belonging to the highest 
quintiles of household wealth in both ELSA (β = 0.125; p < 0.001) and HRS 
(β = 0.170; p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Health inequalities have increased in recent cohorts, with the 
wealthiest participants presenting a better health status in both the USA and 
English populations. Actions to promote health in the ageing population should 
consider the increasing inequality scenario, not only by applying highly 
effective interventions, but also by making them accessible to all members of 
society.

BACKGROUND: With the rapid development of the socioeconomic status, the 
mortality of several cancers has been changed in China during the past 30 years. 
We aimed to estimate the trends of mortality and years of life lost (YLLs) of 
various cancers in urban and rural areas of China from 1990 to 2017.
METHODS: The mortality data were collected from Chinese yearbooks and the age 
structure of population from the Chinese sixth population census were used as 
reference to calculate age-standardized mortality rates (ASMRs) and YLLs rates. 
Joinpoint regression analysis was implemented to calculate the annual percent 
change (APC) of mortality rates and YLL rates for cancers. YLLs owing to 
premature death were calculated as age-specific cancer deaths multiplied by the 
reference life expectancy at birth of 80 years for male and 82.5 years for 
female.
RESULTS: The ASMRs of all cancers showed significant decreasing trends for urban 
residents from 1990 to 2017, such downward trend without significance was also 
observed among rural residents. Interestingly, ASMRs of lung cancer and breast 
cancer have raised continuously in rural areas since 1990. The age-standardized 
YYL rates for urban and rural residents decreased with 1.02% and 0.85% per year, 
respectively. YLLs in rural areas were higher than those in urban areas, whereas 
YLLs of urban outstripped those of rural finally with the increasing in YLLs of 
urban areas (216.71% for men and 207.87% for women).
CONCLUSION: The ASMRs and YLL rates of all cancers have declined in urban and 
rural areas from 1990 to 2017. YLLs increased in urban areas and remained higher 
level in rural areas after 2014 year. Preventive measures should be strengthened 
to against cancer, especially for lung cancer.

BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Obesity has risen to epidemic proportions within the United 
States. As the rates of obesity have increased, so has its prevalence among 
patients undergoing adult spinal deformity (ASD) surgery. The effect of obesity 
on the cost efficiency of corrective procedures for ASD has not been effectively 
evaluated.
PURPOSE: To investigate differences in cost efficiency of ASD surgery for 
patients stratified by body mass index (BMI).
STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: Retrospective review of a single-center ASD database.
PATIENT SAMPLE: Five hundred five ASD patients.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Complications, revisions, costs, EuroQol-5D (EQ5D), 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), cost per QALY.
METHODS: ASD patients (scoliosis≥20°, SVA≥5 cm, PT≥25°, or TK ≥60°) ≥18, 
undergoing ≥4 level fusions were included. Patients were stratified into 
NIH-defined obesity groups based on their preoperative BMI: underweight 18.5< 
(U), normal 18.5 to 24.9 (N), overweight 25.0 to 29.9 (O), obese I 30.0 to 34.9 
(OI), obese II 35.0 to 39.9 (OII), and obesity class III 40.0+ (OIII). Total 
surgery costs for each ASD obesity group were calculated. Costs were calculated 
using the PearlDiver database, which reflects both private insurance and 
Medicare reimbursement claims. Overall complications and major complications 
were assessed according to CMS definitions. QALYs and cost per QALY for obesity 
groups were calculated using an annual 3% discount up to life expectancy (78.7 
years).
RESULTS: In all, 505 patients met inclusion criteria. Baseline demographics and 
surgical details were: age 60.8±14.8, 67.6% female, BMI 28.8±7.30, 81.0% 
posterior approach, 18% combined approach, 10.1±4.2 levels fused, op time 
441.2±146.1 minutes, EBL 1903.8±1594.7 cc, and LOS 8.7±10.7 days. There were 17 
U, 154 N patients, 151 O patients, 100 OI, 51 OII, and 32 OIII patients. 
Revision rates by obesity group were: 0% U, 3% N patients, 3% O patients, 5% OI, 
4% OII, and 6% for OIII patients. The total surgery costs by obesity group were: 
$48,757.86 U, $49,688.52 N, $47,219.93 O, $50,467.66 OI, $51,189.47 OII, and 
$53,855.79 OIII. In an analysis of patients with baseline and 1 Y EQ5D 
follow-up, the cost per QALY by obesity group was: $153,737.78 U, $229,222.37 N, 
$290,361.68 O, $493,588.47 OI, $327,876.21 OII, and $171,680.00 OIII. If that 
benefit was sustained to life expectancy, the cost per QALY was $8,588.70 U, 
$12,805.72 N, $16,221.32 O, $27,574.77 OI, $18,317.11 OII, and $9,591.06 for 
OIII.
CONCLUSIONS: Among adult spinal deformity patients, those with BMIs in the 
obesity I, obesity II, or obesity class III range had more expensive total 
surgery costs. When assessing 1 year cost per QALY, obese patients had costs 32% 
higher than nonobese patients ($224,440.61 vs. $331,048.23). Further research is 
warranted on the utility of optimizing modifiable preoperative health factors 
for patients undergoing corrective adult spinal deformity surgery.

Fiscal decentralization has been a key component of many health sector reforms. 
Nevertheless, the actual effects of greater financial accountability by regional 
governments on reducing geographical health disparities are still debatable. The 
existing empirical literature is highly fragmented, focusing either on the 
effect of fiscal decentralization on health outcomes (without considering 
convergence) or on the convergence process in health (without considering 
decentralization). This paper aims to make a step forward by disentangling the 
role played by fiscal decentralization on the convergence dynamics of infant 
mortality rate and life expectancy at birth, considering also spatial effects. 
To this purpose, a panel of 20 Italian regions over the period 1996-2016 is 
investigated. For both our health outcomes, the results point towards no 
reduction in dispersion levels but evidence of a "catching-up" effect among 
regions. Exploiting the panel dimension of the data, fiscal decentralization 
seems to favour the rate of convergence of the Italian regions. However, the 
fiscal decentralization-growth rate relationship is sensitive to the regional 
level of health outcome: once high performance levels are reached, more 
consistent improvements require giving up a certain degree of fiscal 
accountability. Finally, spatial interactions appear statistically relevant for 
explaining the regional convergence process.

INTRODUCTION: Evidence concerning the effectiveness of non-pharmacological 
interventions that are applied to people with dementia living in long-term care 
facilities is inconsistent. The purpose of this protocol is to describe the 
methodological considerations that will guide the completion of a scoping review 
that will inventorise and assess the effectiveness of the various 
non-pharmacological interventions that are documented in literature for 
improving quality of life of people with dementia living in long-term care.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This scoping review will combine the methodology outlined 
in the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses 
Extension for Scoping Reviews and Guidance for conducting systematic scoping 
reviews by Peters et al. PubMed; MEDLINE; CINAHL; Embase; Cochrane Database of 
Systematic Reviews; Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials; Emcare; 
Sociological Abstracts and PsycINFO databases will be searched. Grey literature 
databases will also be explored. A two-stage screening process consisting of a 
title and abstract scan and a full-text review will be used to determine the 
eligibility of studies. Studies, irrespective of design, will be included that 
quantitatively assess quality of life of long-term care residents who receive 
non-pharmacological interventions for dementia. A pair of reviewers will 
independently assess all articles for eligibility, and all eligible articles 
will be abstracted and charted using a standardised form. The extracted data 
will undergo a 'narrative review' or a descriptive analysis of the contextual or 
process-oriented data and quantitative analysis reflecting the objectives of 
this scoping review.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Research ethics approval is not required for this 
scoping review. This review started off in October 2018, anticipated end date is 
June 2020. We plan to disseminate this research through publications, 
presentations at relevant national and international conferences and meetings 
with relevant stakeholders. This scoping review protocol has been registered at 
Open Science Framework (https://osf.io/tupbv).

PURPOSE: Acromegaly is a rare disease caused by chronic hypersecretion of growth 
hormone, which leads to multiple comorbidities and reduced life expectancy. The 
objective of this study was to characterize the serum metabolic profiles of 
acromegaly patients and identify metabolic biomarkers using metabolomics.
METHODS: Twenty-nine active acromegaly patients and age- and sex-matched normal 
controls were recruited. Serum samples were collected, and serum metabolites 
were analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry coupled with a series 
of multivariate statistical analyses.
RESULTS: The orthogonal projections to latent structures-discriminate analysis 
(OPLS-DA) model identified and validated significant metabolic differences 
between individuals with acromegaly and normal controls (R2Y = 0.908 and 
Q2Y = 0.601). Compared with normal controls, acromegaly patients had elevated 
levels of 5-aminovaleric acid, glyceric acid, L-dithiothreitol, dihydrocoumarin, 
N-acetyl-L-glutamic acid, gluconic acid, and monoolein (P < 0.05) and reduced 
serum levels of D-erythronolactone, taurine, carbamoyl-aspartic acid, and mucic 
acid (P < 0.01). Furthermore, glyceric acid and taurine possessed higher area 
under the receiver operating characteristic curve values (AUC values, 0.914 and 
0.931, respectively), suggesting an excellent clinical ability to distinguish 
acromegaly patients from normal controls. Pathway analysis revealed that the 
pentose phosphate pathway and the taurine and hypotaurine metabolic pathway are 
significant pathways (P = 0.002 and 0.004, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: Metabolic activity is significantly altered in the serum of 
individuals with active acromegaly. Glyceric acid and taurine may be considered 
potential biomarkers for distinguishing acromegaly patients from normal 
controls.

Electronic Health Record and Problem Lists in Leeds, United Kingdom: Variability 
of general practitioners' views.

Data sharing of Electronic Health Records from general practices to secondary 
care in Leeds occurs through the so-called Leeds Care Records, which collects a 
specific set of codes from primary care, known as 'Active Problems', and 
presents it to the user. Variability on its content is a known issue. To explore 
general practitioners' views on their use of 'Active Problems' and on sharing 
data, so lessons could be learnt on how to homogenise and improve shared data. 
Assessing Leeds general practitioners' views through two parallel processes (60 
online surveys and 17 interviews). General practitioners feel they do not have 
the time nor the training required for keeping a shared approach to concise and 
current Problem Lists in electronic patient records. Action is needed to reduce 
current variability, and to improve the quality of shared information. Some 
types of codes currently present in Problem Lists have very little support among 
general practitioners who consider the focus should be on long-term conditions 
and probably adding current acute diagnoses and life expectancy items and not 
omitting sensitive information. There is a perceived need of training and time 
to update Problem Lists if their quality is to improve.

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to predict population composition, mortality, 
sociodemographic index (SDI), and cause-specific disability-adjusted life year 
(DALY) rate in China from 2018 through 2021.
STUDY DESIGN: Using the time series method autoregressive integrated moving 
average (ARIMA) models on all available data, mainly Statistics Year Report by 
the Global Burden of Disease Study 2017, we predicted populations, deaths, DALYs 
attributable to disease conditions, and injuries (causes) for China from 2018 
through 2021 at levels 0, 1, 2, and 3.
METHODS: The time series method ARIMA models was used on history data.
RESULTS: The predicted total population and SDI in China are increasing from 
2018 through 2021. The under-5 mortality is decreasing; from 10.24% to 0.65% in 
the period 1990-2021. The all-cause DALY rate decreases. The top causes of DALY 
rate are non-communicable diseases (level 1), cardiovascular diseases (level 2), 
and stroke (level 3). For the leading 22 level 2 causes in 2018, the trend of 
ranking in 2021 is as follows: unchanged, 15; increasing, 4; and decreasing, 3. 
For the leading 169 level 3 causes in 2018, the trend of ranking in 2021 is: as 
follows: unchanged, 49; increasing, 63; and decreasing 57.
CONCLUSIONS: Cause-specific and time-dependent health policy should be steered 
to reduce the major burden focuses and to improve population health.

BACKGROUND: Although it is widely accepted that the autosomal dominant 
polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) patients with large liver cysts have a 
significant decrement in quality of life (QOL), there is insufficient evidence 
that clearly demonstrates the relationship between the size of the liver cysts 
and QOL. Therefore, we started this prospective longitudinal study to 
investigate the impact of liver cysts on QOL.
METHODS: We grouped the 111 included ADPKD patients into 4 groups (control group 
A; < 25%, group B; 25-49%, group C; 50-75%, group D; > 75%) according to liver 
cysts-parenchyma ratio (CPR). QOL was measured by FANLTC + FACT-Hep scores. We 
compared QOL scores and several clinical parameters amongst these groups for 
3 years.
RESULTS: The number of patients in group A, B, C, and D was 31, 14, 14, and 23, 
respectively. Although there were no significant differences in AST (p = 0.107), 
ALT (p = 0.925), and serum albumin (p = 0.212) between the four groups, platelet 
count was significantly decreased along with the extension of cyst volume 
(p = 0.030). Overall, the mean FANLTC and FACT-Hep scores were 71.8 ± 12.5, and 
32.4 ± 5.8, respectively. FANLTC (p = 0.017) and FACT-Hep scores (p = 0.003) 
were significantly decreased with increasing cyst volume. From the data 
collected at the time of registration, multivariate linear regression analysis 
demonstrated that the CPR had a significant influence on FANLTC and FACT-Hep 
scores.
CONCLUSION: In this cross-sectional and prospective longitudinal study, we 
demonstrate the relationship between liver cyst volume and QOL in ADPKD 
patients. We hope to establish the long-term influence on QOL in this ongoing 
prospective longitudinal study.

Health Care Provider Knowledge and Perceptions of FDA-Approved and 
Do-It-Yourself Automated Insulin Delivery.

BACKGROUND: Automated insulin delivery (AID) technology may reduce variability 
in blood glucose, resulting in lower risk for hypoglycemia and associated 
complications, and by extension improve quality of life. While clinical trials, 
research, and patient experience have consistently demonstrated the value of 
AID, this technology is still inaccessible to many patients. Patient-driven 
innovation has resulted in alternative do-it-yourself (DIY) solutions to 
available off-the-shelf AID devices.
METHOD: This two-phase cross-sectional observational study addressed health care 
provider (HCP) perceptions of AID as well as the perceived need for, development 
of, and evaluation of an AID fact sheet comparing the most commonly used Federal 
Drug Administration approved AID and DIY AID devices.
RESULTS: Negative attitudes toward the use of DIY AID were low. The majority of 
HCPs saw their lack of knowledge about how DIY AID work to be the greatest 
barrier to answering patient questions about what is available (74.4%). 
Additionally, the majority of HCPs (64.5%) indicated they were either "likely" 
or "very likely" to use the fact sheet when answering patient questions about 
AID options.
CONCLUSION: Increased awareness and utilization of AID technology offer hope to 
further reduce the burden of diabetes, but there is a need to bridge the 
knowledge gap about DIY AID. A fact sheet provides a way to facilitate 
discussions of this emerging technology between HCPs and patients. Next steps 
could investigate additional ways to put needed information in the hands of 
HCPs.

This article examined the factors of how long people would like to live 
involving 462 respondents aged 40 years and older in Malaysia. Data collected 
through an online self-administered survey indicated that 75% of the respondents 
would like to live at least 80 years and on average most people would like to 
live 81 years. Rural respondents, those who agreed that they have a loving 
family, those who agreed that they want to continue working for as long as they 
can, respondents who believed that they will not need long-term care at 65 years 
and older, and those who may consider living in an assisted living facility were 
more likely to want to live at least 80 years compared with respondents who did 
not agree. Efforts should be targeted at promoting healthy lifestyle and 
providing more employment opportunities for older persons.

Damage to the kidney substantially reduces life expectancy. Renal tissue 
hypoperfusion and hypoxia are key elements in the pathophysiology of acute 
kidney injury and its progression to chronic kidney disease. In vivo assessment 
of renal haemodynamics and tissue oxygenation remains a challenge. Blood 
oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is sensitive 
to changes in the effective transversal relaxation time (T2 *) in vivo, and is 
non-invasive and indicative of renal tissue oxygenation. However, the renal T2 * 
to tissue pO2 relationship is not governed exclusively by renal blood 
oxygenation, but is affected by physiological confounders with alterations in 
renal blood volume fraction (BVf) being of particular relevance. To decipher 
this interference probing renal BVf is essential for the pursuit of renal MR 
oximetry. Superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticle (USPIO) preparations can be 
used as MRI visible blood pool markers for detailing alterations in BVf. This 
review promotes the opportunities of MRI-based assessment of renal BVf. 
Following an outline on the specifics of renal oxygenation and perfusion, 
changes in renal BVf upon interventions and their potential impact on renal T2 * 
are discussed. We also describe the basic principles of renal BVf assessment 
using ferumoxytol-enhanced MRI in the equilibrium concentration regimen. We 
demonstrate that ferumoxytol does not alter control of renal haemodynamics and 
oxygenation. Preclinical applications of ferumoxytol enhanced renal MRI as well 
as considerations for its clinical implementation for examining renal BVf 
changes are provided alongside practical considerations. Finally, we explore the 
future directions of MRI-based assessment of renal BVf.

Mass participation sporting events (MPSEs) are increasing in popularity. 
However, little research exists into the potential value of these events for 
improving public health by enhancing physical activity (PA). The aim of this 
study is to estimate the health impact of increased physical activity as a 
result of preparing for an MPSE. Participants of a mass participation women-only 
running event were asked if they performed additional PA in preparation of the 
event, including the length (weeks) and intensity (min per week). Additionally, 
self-reported change in health status was evaluated. Based on these results, we 
have developed a framework for estimating the cumulatively gained quality 
adjusted life years (QALYs) and monetary value thereof. Of the respondents (N = 
468; mean age 42.3 ± 11.9 years), 32% performed additional vigorous PA in 
preparation of the event, with an average of 63 min per week over 8.8 weeks. 
Performing additional vigorous PA significantly improved the odds of self-rated 
health. The estimated total health impact of participants preparing for the 
Marikenloop was 6.6 QALYs gained with a corresponding monetary value between EUR 
133,000 and EUR 532,000. We believe our health impact framework helps to 
understand that MPSEs can be a notable part of the public health domain.

Critical limb ischemia is the most serious form of peripheral artery disease, 
characterized by severe functional consequences, difficult clinical management 
and reduced life expectancy. The goal of this study was to investigate the 
miR-210 role in the neo-angiogenic response after acute limb ischemia. 
Complementary approaches were used in a mouse model of hindlimb ischemia: 
miR-210 loss-of-function was obtained by administration of LNA-oligonucleotides 
anti-miR-210; for miR-210 gain-of-function, a doxycycline-inducible miR-210 
transgenic mouse was used. We tested miR-210 ability to stimulate vascular 
regeneration following ischemia. We found that miR-210 was necessary and 
sufficient to stimulate blood perfusion recovery, as well as arteriolar and 
capillary density increase, in the ischemic muscle. To clarify the molecular 
events underpinning miR-210 pro-angiogenic action, the transcriptomic changes in 
ischemic muscles upon miR-210 blocking were analyzed. We found that miR-210 
impacted the transcriptome significantly, regulating pathways and functions 
linked to vascular regeneration. In agreement with a pro-angiogenic role, 
miR-210 also improved cardiac function and left ventricular remodeling after 
myocardial infarction. Moreover, miR-210 blocking decreased capillary density in 
a Matrigel plug assay, indicating that miR-210 is necessary for angiogenesis 
independently of ischemia. Collectively, these data indicate that miR-210 plays 
a pivotal role in promoting vascular regeneration.

As a consequence of the improvements in diagnostic technology along with gains 
in life expectancy of cancer patients, the incidence of spine metastases has 
increased. Spine metastases can affect the patient's quality of life and 
negatively impact on their prognosis. Multidisciplinary treatments involve 
surgery, chemotherapy, radiosurgery and radiotherapy. Spine metastases should be 
treated using a multidisciplinary and integrated approach that involves spinal 
surgeons, medical oncologists and radiologists. More research is required to 
elucidate the pathological mechanisms involved in the aetiology of spine 
metastasis. This review describes the current situation regarding the diagnosis 
of spine metastasis, what is understood about the pathological development of 
spine metastasis and the evolution of the multidisciplinary treatments that are 
available for patients with spine metastases.

BACKGROUND: Chile has one of the highest life expectancies within Latin 
American. This is the first study to determine health expectancies in older 
populations in Chile, considering cognitive status as a health indicator.
METHODS: We estimated prevalence of cognitive decline among people aged 60 years 
and over based on the Mini-mental State Examination and the Pfeffer Functional 
Activities Questionnaire, with data from the National Survey of Health (2003, 
2009, 2016). Life expectancy free of cognitive impairment was calculated using 
the Sullivan method.
RESULTS: At age 60, life expectancy free of cognitive impairment was more than 3 
years longer for women, compared to men of the same age. Life expectancy free 
from cognitive impairment was higher for both men and women aged 60 in 2016 when 
compared to 2003 (2.1 and 2 years higher, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: Longer life expectancy in women was accompanied by more years free 
of cognitive impairment. Men expected to live a similar proportion of years free 
of cognitive impairment, compared to women. Common and standardised assessments 
of health status of older people should be adopted in Latin American studies, to 
allow for time-trend analyses and international comparisons.

BACKGROUND: Mental disorders are among the leading causes of non-fatal disease 
burden in India, but a systematic understanding of their prevalence, disease 
burden, and risk factors is not readily available for each state of India. In 
this report, we describe the prevalence and disease burden of each mental 
disorder for the states of India, from 1990 to 2017.
METHODS: We used all accessible data from multiple sources to estimate the 
prevalence of mental disorders, years lived with disability (YLDs), and 
disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) caused by these disorders for all the 
states of India from 1990 to 2017, as part of the Global Burden of Diseases, 
Injuries, and Risk Factors Study. We assessed the heterogeneity and time trends 
of mental disorders across the states of India. We grouped states on the basis 
of their Socio-demographic Index (SDI), which is a composite measure of 
per-capita income, mean education, and fertility rate in women younger than 25 
years. We also assessed the association of major mental disorders with suicide 
deaths. We calculated 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) for the point estimates.
FINDINGS: In 2017, 197·3 million (95% UI 178·4-216·4) people had mental 
disorders in India, including 45·7 million (42·4-49·8) with depressive disorders 
and 44·9 million (41·2-48·9) with anxiety disorders. We found a significant, but 
modest, correlation between the prevalence of depressive disorders and suicide 
death rate at the state level for females (r2=0·33, p=0·0009) and males 
(r2=0·19, p=0·015). The contribution of mental disorders to the total DALYs in 
India increased from 2·5% (2·0-3·1) in 1990 to 4·7% (3·7-5·6) in 2017. In 2017, 
depressive disorders contributed the most to the total mental disorders DALYs 
(33·8%, 29·5-38·5), followed by anxiety disorders (19·0%, 15·9-22·4), idiopathic 
developmental intellectual disability (IDID; 10·8%, 6·3-15·9), schizophrenia 
(9·8%, 7·7-12·4), bipolar disorder (6·9%, 4·9-9·6), conduct disorder (5·9%, 
4·0-8·1), autism spectrum disorders (3·2%, 2·7-3·8), eating disorders (2·2%, 
1·7-2·8), and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD; 0·3%, 0·2-0·5); 
other mental disorders comprised 8·0% (6·1-10·1) of DALYs. Almost all (>99·9%) 
of these DALYs were made up of YLDs. The DALY rate point estimates of mental 
disorders with onset predominantly in childhood and adolescence (IDID, conduct 
disorder, autism spectrum disorders, and ADHD) were higher in low SDI states 
than in middle SDI and high SDI states in 2017, whereas the trend was reversed 
for mental disorders that manifest predominantly during adulthood. Although the 
prevalence of mental disorders with onset in childhood and adolescence decreased 
in India from 1990 to 2017, with a stronger decrease in high SDI and middle SDI 
states than in low SDI states, the prevalence of mental disorders that manifest 
predominantly during adulthood increased during this period.
INTERPRETATION: One in seven Indians were affected by mental disorders of 
varying severity in 2017. The proportional contribution of mental disorders to 
the total disease burden in India has almost doubled since 1990. Substantial 
variations exist between states in the burden from different mental disorders 
and in their trends over time. These state-specific trends of each mental 
disorder reported here could guide appropriate policies and health system 
response to more effectively address the burden of mental disorders in India.
