The Alagille syndrome (AGS) or arteriohepatic dysplasia is a rare, autosomal 
dominant inherited disease with a prevalence of approximately 1:100,000. AGS was 
first described in 1969 and affects liver, heart, arterial blood vessels, 
skeleton and the eyes. The expression of AGS is variable. In severe cases a 
liver transplantation is required. Presented is the case of a 25-year-old woman 
with AGS. At the age of 7 and 8years she had liver transplantations. Other 
typical findings associated with Alagille syndrome (e.g. pulmonary or renal 
anomalies) were also present. The young woman apparently died suddenly and 
unexpectedly in a good health condition despite regular medical treatment. Cause 
of death was a subarachnoid hemorrhage with invasion of the hemorrhage into the 
ventricle system caused by a rupture of previously unknown large aneurysm in the 
terminal basilary artery. Intracranial vascular malformations are a common 
finding in patients with AGS and cause death in up to 16% of them. Life 
expectancy in AGS patients depends on the severity of changes of the affected 
liver. But AGS is also responsible for various vascular abnormalities in several 
other organs which can cause lethal complications. Due to the high rate of 
vascular complications and intracranial hemorrhage with the leading cause of 
mortality in patients with AGS, vascular screening by the use of noninvasive 
imaging techniques (CT or MR angiography) is required to avoid unexpected sudden 
death.

We examined the impact of antiretroviral treatment adherence among hepatitis C 
(HCV) coinfected human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) patients on survival and 
clinical outcomes. We analyzed Medicaid claims data from 14 southern states from 
2005 to 2007, comparing survival and clinical outcomes and cost of treatment for 
HIV and HCV coinfected patients (N = 4115) at different levels of adherence to 
antiretroviral therapy (ART). More than one in five patients (20.5%) showed less 
than 50% adherence to antiretroviral treatment, but there were no racial/ethnic 
or gender disparities. Significant survival benefit was demonstrated at each 
incremental level of adherence to ART (one-year mortality ranging from 3.5% in 
the highest adherence group to 26.0% in the lowest). Low-adherence patients also 
had higher rates of hospitalization and emergency department visits. Relative to 
patients with high (>95%) ART adherence, those with less than 25% treatment 
adherence had fourfold greater risk of death (adjusted odds ratio 4.22 [95% CI: 
3.03, 5.87]). Nondrug Medicaid expenditures were lower for high-adherence 
patients, but cost of medications drove total Medicaid expenditures higher for 
high-adherence patients. Cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) saved 
(relative to the <25% low-adherence group) ranged from $21,874 for increasing 
adherence to 25-50% to $37,229 for increasing adherence to 75-95%. Adherence to 
ART for patients with HIV and HCV coinfection is associated with lower adverse 
clinical outcomes at a Medicaid cost per QALY commensurate with other 
well-accepted treatment and prevention strategies. Further research is needed to 
identify interventions which can best achieve optimal ART adherence at a 
population scale.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of solifenacin succinate in Parkinson's 
disease (PD) patients suffering from overactive bladder (OAB).
BACKGROUND: Urinary dysfunction is a commonly encountered non-motor feature in 
PD that significantly impacts patient quality of life.
DESIGN/METHODS: This was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, 3-site 
study with an open label extension phase to determine the efficacy of 
solifenacin succinate in idiopathic PD patients with OAB. Patients were 
randomized to receive solifenacin succinate 5-10 mg daily or placebo for 12 
weeks followed by an 8-week open label extension. The primary outcome measure 
was the change in the mean number of micturitions per 24 h period. Secondary 
outcome measures included the change in the mean number of urinary incontinence 
episodes and the mean number of nocturia episodes.
RESULTS: Twenty-three patients were randomized in the study. There was no 
significant improvement in the primary outcome measure in the double-blind 
phase, but there was an improvement in the number of micturitions per 24 h 
period in the solifenacin succinate group compared to placebo at a mean dose of 
6 mg/day (p = 0.01). In the open label phase, the mean number of urinary 
incontinence episodes per 24 h period decreased (p = 0.03), as did the number of 
nocturia episodes per 24 h period (p = 0.01). Adverse events included 
constipation and xerostomia, which resolved after treatment was discontinued.
CONCLUSIONS: In this pilot trial, solifenacin succinate treatment led to an 
improvement in urinary incontinence, despite persistence in other OAB symptoms.

OBJECTIVES: As life expectancy increases, functional outcomes in elderly 
patients after radical prostatectomy (RP) become a more important factor to 
consider in treatment selection. The aim of this study was to determine 
age-dependent differences in functional outcomes after RP.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 8,295 patients who underwent RP from January 
2009 to July 2013 were analyzed. Univariate and multivariate logistic 
regressions were used to estimate the effect of age and other covariates on 3- 
and 12-month continence and potency rates. Continence was achieved if no more 
than one safety pad was used per day. Potency was defined as an international 
index of erectile function (IIEF)-5 score of 18 or higher.
RESULTS: In the entire cohort, 12-month (3-mo) continence and potency rates were 
91.0% (76.1%) and 54.6% (40.9%), respectively. The 1-year continence rates for 
age groups < 65, ≥ 65 and < 70, ≥ 70 and < 75, and ≥ 75 years were 93.2%, 90.8%, 
86.0%, and 86.5%, respectively. The corresponding 1-year potency rates were 
59.3%, 46.9%, 44.4%, and 31.3%. In both, univariate and multivariate analyses, 
older age had a significant negative effect on functional outcomes. Moreover, 
nerve sparing, pT category, and patients' body mass index were significantly 
associated with continence. Nerve sparing, pT category, patients' body mass 
index, and use of PDE5 inhibitor or intracavernous injection therapy 
significantly influenced potency.
CONCLUSIONS: Older age has a significant adverse effect on recovery of 
continence and potency. Although functional outcomes in elderly patients and 
especially in patients aged 75 years or older are still good, they should be 
educated about the increased risk of incontinence and impotence after RP.

HIV patients are exposed to a higher risk of adverse cardiovascular events, due 
to complex interactions between traditional risk factors and HIV infection 
itself in terms of ongoing endothelial dysfunctional immune 
activation/inflammation and increased risk of thrombosis. On the other hand, 
long-span antiretroviral therapy administration still raises questions on its 
long-term safety in an era in which life expectancy is becoming longer and 
longer while treatment of non-HIV-related serious events is increasingly raising 
concern. In this article, we will critically analyse the current knowledge of 
pathological and clinical aspects pertaining to the increased risk of 
cardiovascular events associated with HIV.

Sustaining and strengthening the ability of the elderly to continue their sexual 
needs can be realized as part of improving their quality of life, health and 
well-being. There is no age at which ends the expression of sexuality and 
intimacy. Through education, quality of life and advances in medicine, the 
average life expectancy is still increasing. Sexual activity of older people 
society usually describe using pejorative terms as an inappropriate, bizarre or 
obscene, but these labels are different than reality. Hormonal changes and other 
physiological changes associated with aging affect sexual interest. Erectile 
dysfunction is a problem in men increasing with age. There is no evidence that 
premature ejaculation is more common in older age. Cross-sectional studies 
showed no difference in sexual dysfunction between older and younger women. Age 
is not a barrier to sexually transmitted diseases. The most common pathogenetic 
factors for male erectile dysfunction are vascular diseases. In women, the most 
important symptoms of sexual dysfunction are lack of emotional wellbeing and a 
sense of intimacy during sexual intercourse.

Presbycusis and presbystasis represent relevant problems of aging, caused by the 
increase in life expectancy in developed countries. As such, it is advantageous 
to better understand the physiopathological mechanisms of these age-related 
inner ear diseases. The hypothesis that presbycusis and presbystasis have a 
genetic background was proposed some years ago. Several studies (in humans and 
animals) are available in the literature, and possible genes involved in the 
physiopathology of both diseases have been identified. The aim of this paper is 
to present an overview of the information available in the current medical 
literature on presbycusis and presbystasis.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to identify and critically appraise the 
use of Value of Information (VOI) analyses undertaken as part of health 
technology assessment (HTA) reports in England and Wales.
METHODS: A systematic review of National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) 
funded HTA reports published between 2004 and 2013 identified the use of VOI 
methods and key analytical details in terms of: (i) types of VOI methodology 
used; (ii) parameters and key assumptions; and (iii) conclusions drawn in terms 
of the need for further research.
RESULTS: A total of 512 HTA reports were published during the relevant 
timeframe. Of these, 203 reported systematic review and economic modeling 
studies and 25 of these had used VOI method(s). Over half of the twenty-five 
studies (n = 13) conducted both EVPI (Expected Value of Perfect Information) and 
EVPPI (Expected Value of Partial Perfect Information) analyses. Eight studies 
conducted EVPI analysis, three studies conducted EVPI, EVPPI, and EVSI (Expected 
Value of Sampling Information) analyses and one study conducted EVSI analysis 
only. The level of detail reporting the methods used to conduct the VOI analyses 
varied.
CONCLUSIONS: This review has shown that the frequency of the use of VOI methods 
is increasing at a slower pace compared with the published volume of HTA 
reports. This review also suggests that analysts reporting VOI method(s) in HTA 
reports should aim to describe the method(s) in sufficient detail to enable and 
encourage decision-makers guiding research prioritization decisions to use the 
potentially valuable outputs from quantitative VOI analyses.

OBJECTIVES: This paper describes the development and findings for a policy brief 
on "Advancing the Integration of Palliative Care into the National Health 
System" and the subsequent use of this report.
METHODS: Key stakeholders involved with palliative care helped identify the 
problem and potential policy solutions to scale up these services within the 
health system. A working group of national stakeholder representatives and 
external reviewers commented on and contributed to successive drafts of the 
report. Research describing the problem, policy options and implementation 
considerations was identified by reviewing government documents, routinely 
collected data, electronic literature searches, contact with key informants, and 
reviewing the reference lists of relevant documents that were retrieved.
RESULTS: The palliative burden is not only high but increasing due to the rise 
in population and life expectancy. A few options for holistic, supportive care 
include: Home-based care increases chances of a peaceful death for the 
terminally ill surrounded by their loved ones; supporting informal caregivers 
improves their quality of life and discharge planning reduces unscheduled 
admissions and has the potential to free up capacity for acute care services. A 
combination of strategies is needed to effectively implement the proposed 
options as discussed further in this article.
CONCLUSIONS: The policy brief report was used as a background document for two 
stakeholder dialogues whose main outcome was that a comprehensive national 
palliative care policy should be instituted to include all the options, which 
need to be integrated within the public health system. A draft policy is now in 
process.

AIMS: To assess the cost-effectiveness of dapagliflozin, a sodium-glucose 
co-transporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitor, compared with a sulfonylurea, when added to 
metformin for treatment of UK people with Type 2 diabetes mellitus inadequately 
controlled on metformin alone.
METHODS: Clinical inputs sourced from a head-to-head randomized controlled trial 
(RCT) informed the Cardiff diabetes decision model. Risk equations developed 
from the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) were used in 
conjunction with the clinical inputs to predict disease progression and the 
incidence of micro- and macrovascular complications over a lifetime horizon. 
Cost and utility data were generated to present the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for both treatment arms, and sensitivity and 
scenario analyses were conducted to assess the impact of uncertainty on the 
final model results.
RESULTS: The dapagliflozin treatment arm was associated with a mean incremental 
benefit of 0.467 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) [95% confidence interval 
(CI): 0.420; 0.665], with an incremental cost of £1246 (95% CI: £613; £1637). 
This resulted in an ICER point estimate of £2671 per QALY gained. Incremental 
costs were shown to be insensitive to parameter variation, with only 
treatment-related weight change having a significant impact on the incremental 
QALYs. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis determined that dapagliflozin had a 
100% probability of being cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of 
£20,000 per QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: Dapagliflozin in combination with metformin was shown to be a 
cost-effective treatment option compared with sulfonylurea from a UK healthcare 
perspective for people with Type 2 diabetes mellitus who are inadequately 
controlled on metformin monotherapy.

BACKGROUND: Living alone is common among elderly people in Western countries, 
and studies on its relationship with institutionalization and all-cause 
mortality have shown inconsistent results. We investigated that the impact of 
living alone on institutionalization and mortality in a population-based cohort 
of elderly people.
METHODS: Data originate from the Swedish National study on Aging and 
Care-Kungsholmen. Participants aged ≥66 years and living at home (n = 2404) at 
baseline underwent interviews and clinical examination. Data on living 
arrangements were collected in interviews. All participants were followed for 6 
years; survival status and admission into institutions were tracked continuously 
through administrative registers from 2001 to 2007. Data were analysed using Cox 
proportional hazard models, competing risk regressions and Laplace regressions 
with adjustment for potential confounders.
RESULTS: Of the 2404 participants, 1464 (60.9%) lived alone at baseline. During 
the follow-up, 711 (29.6%) participants died, and 185 (15.0%) were 
institutionalized. In the multi-adjusted Cox model, the hazard ratio (HR) of 
mortality in those living alone was 1.35 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.18 to 
1.54), especially among men (HR = 1.44, 95% CI 1.18 to 1.76). Living alone 
shortened survival by 0.6 years and was associated with the risk of 
institutionalization (HR = 1.74, 95% CI 1.10 to 2.77) after taking death into 
account as a competing risk.
CONCLUSIONS: Living alone is associated with elevated mortality, especially 
among men and an increased risk of institutionalization. Over a 6-year period, 
living alone was related to a half year reduction in survival among elderly 
people in Sweden.

BACKGROUND: Beta thalassemia is considered a severe, progressive anemia, which 
needs regular transfusions for life expectancy. One of the most important 
complications of regular blood transfusions is autoimmunization and 
alloimmunization, which increases the need for transfusion. This study was 
performed to investigate the frequency of auto- and allo-antibodies in beta 
thalassemia patients in Alexandria, Egypt.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Blood samples of fourteen beta thalassemia patients were 
collected and tested for autosensitization with direct antiglobulin test (DAT). 
The positive DAT blood sample undergone antibody elution then identification. 
Plasma of the patients were also investigated for allosensitization by testing 
against cell panel reagents.
RESULTS: DAT was positive in 45% of the patients. Eluted antibodies were 
identified in 6 cases of 10, they were Kp(b) and Lu(b), and one positive test 
was unidentified. Alloantibodies were detected in 42.5% of the cases. The 
identified antibodies were anti-D (4.76%), anti-c (4.76%), anti-K (4.76%), 
anti-Kp(a) (9.52%), anti-Kp(b) (19.05%), anti-Lu(a) (9.52%), anti-Lu(b) 
(19.05%), and anti-Bg(a) (4.76%). A total 23.81% of the alloantibodies were 
unidentified.
DISCUSSION: This study observes that autoimmunization and alloimmunization were 
more frequent among poly transfused beta thalassemia Egyptian patients. The 
presence of these clinically significant alloantibodies is a bad indicator for 
situation of blood transfusion. There is need for use an effective strategies to 
provide a safe blood for those patients by using leukodepleted blood and more 
compatible blood with extended phenotyping.

Osteoarthritis is nowadays one of the most frequent chronic diseases and, with 
the increase in life expectancy, both its prevalence and incidence is expected 
to rise. This condition is progressive and leads to functional decline and loss 
in quality of life, with important health care and society costs. A review of 
relevant and recent literature on osteoarthritis was performed in PubMed. The 
purpose of this study is to understand important aspects about osteoarthritis 
estimates, burden of disease, pathophysiology, risk factors, diagnosis and 
treatment.

OBJECTIVE: People with serious mental illness have reduced life expectancy, in 
large part due to reduced access to medical services and underutilization of 
preventive health services. This is a cross-sectional study that compared 
preventive services use in an integrated behavioral health primary care clinic 
(IBHPC) with two existing community mental health programs.
METHODS: Participants completed questionnaires about preventive health services 
use that contained 33 questions about demographic clinical information, and use 
of preventive health services, from October 2010 to December 2012. Services 
examined included mammogram, Papanicolaou Test, prostate specific antigen, 
digital rectal exam, fecal occult blood test, and flexible sigmoidoscopy or 
colonoscopy; blood pressure, height and weight, cholesterol, and blood sugar for 
diabetes; and influenza immunization, Hepatitis C Virus (HCV), and Human 
Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) antibodies. A health service utilization score was 
developed and used as primary outcome for data analyses.
RESULTS: In the multivariate analyses female gender (p < 0.05), race/ethnicity 
(p = 0.01 for Asian, p = 0.04 for Hispanic/Latino, both compared to White), 
program type (p < 0.001), and having a primary care provider (p < 0.001) were 
significant predictors of higher services use. IBHPC was associated with higher 
overall service utilization compared to one community mental health program (p < 
0.001) but was similar when compared another (p = 0.34). There was high 
variability in use of individual services among the clinical programs.
CONCLUSION: More studies are needed to examine the effectiveness of integrated 
care in improving use of health screening services. Characteristics of the 
clinic in relation to use of preventive services deserve further study.

MOTIVATION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a dementia that gets worse with time 
resulting in loss of memory and cognitive functions. The life expectancy of AD 
patients following diagnosis is ∼7 years. In 2006, researchers estimated that 
0.40% of the world population (range 0.17-0.89%) was afflicted by AD, and that 
the prevalence rate would be tripled by 2050. Usually, examination of brain 
tissues is required for definite diagnosis of AD. So, it is crucial to diagnose 
AD at an early stage via some alternative methods. As the brain controls many 
functions via releasing signalling proteins through blood, we analyse blood 
plasma proteins for diagnosis of AD.
RESULTS: Here, we use a radial basis function (RBF) network for feature 
selection called feature selection RBF network for selection of plasma proteins 
that can help diagnosis of AD. We have identified a set of plasma proteins, 
smaller in size than previous study, with comparable prediction accuracy. We 
have also analysed mild cognitive impairment (MCI) samples with our selected 
proteins. We have used neural networks and support vector machines as 
classifiers. The principle component analysis, Sammmon projection and heat-map 
of the selected proteins have been used to demonstrate the proteins' 
discriminating power for diagnosis of AD. We have also found a set of plasma 
signalling proteins that can distinguish incipient AD from MCI at an early 
stage. Literature survey strongly supports the AD diagnosis capability of the 
selected plasma proteins.

Several types of cardiovascular complications can occur during treatment with 
targeted therapies: heart failure, QTc lengthening, arterial and venous 
thrombosis. A clinical examination, ECG and cardiac ultrasound are essential 
before starting treatment with targeted therapy. Patients with no medical 
history, who are asymptomatic with a normal ECG and a left ventricular ejection 
fraction (LVEF) greater than 50% can begin molecular targeted therapy (MTT). 
Patients must be assessed by a cardiologist before the introduction of MTT if 
they have a history of ischemic or valvular heart disease, heart failure, atrial 
fibrillation, stroke, transient ischemic attack, or ECG anomalies (Q wave, 
supraventricular arrhythmia, QT greater than 500ms), or LVEF less than 50%. In 
patients who are symptomatic (dyspnoea, angina, syncope, embolism etc.) and/or 
present with a modification to the ECG or alteration to the LVEF, MTT must be 
stopped and reassessment by a cardiologist is indicated. The restarting of MTT 
following a cardiovascular complication must be subject to a multidisciplinary 
discussion taking into account the severity of the cardiac event, its 
reversibility with cardiac treatment, life expectancy of the patient as well as 
the expected efficacy of the drug.

BACKGROUND: CTLA4 blockade by tremelimumab 15 mg/kg every 90 days provided 
preliminary evidence of activity in patients with pretreated malignant 
mesothelioma; however, retrospective exposure-response analysis of data from 
patients with melanoma suggested that this schedule could result in 
underexposure to tremelimumab. We therefore investigated the efficacy and safety 
of an intensified schedule of tremelimumab in patients with advanced malignant 
mesothelioma.
METHODS: In this open-label, single-arm, phase 2 study, participants aged 18 
years or older with unresectable, advanced malignant mesothelioma (measurable in 
accordance with the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST]), a 
life expectancy of 3 months or more, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 
performance status of 2 or less, and who had failed a first-line platinum-based 
regimen were enrolled at the University Hospital of Siena, Siena, Italy. 
Participants received tremelimumab 10 mg/kg once every 4 weeks for six doses, 
then every 12 weeks until disease progression, unacceptable toxic effects, or 
refusal to continue treatment. The primary endpoint was the proportion of 
patients achieving an immune-related objective response (complete or partial), 
assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of the study drug. This 
study is registered with the European Union Clinical Trials Register, number 
2012-002762-12, and ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01655888.
FINDINGS: Between July 30, 2012, and July 15, 2013, we enrolled 29 patients with 
a median age of 65 years (range 42-78), stage III (n=11) or IV (n=18) disease, 
and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-1 (n=23) or 2 
(n=6). Malignant mesothelioma histology was epithelioid (n=21, including one 
peritoneal), biphasic (n=6), sarcomatoid (n=1), or undefined (n=1). Patients 
received a median of six doses of tremelimumab (range 1-13). After a median 
follow-up of 21·3 months (IQR 18·7-25·9), four immune-related-partial responses 
were recorded, one at the first tumour assessment (after about 12 weeks) and 
three at the second tumour assessment (about 24 weeks), with two responses 
occurring after initial progressive disease and one response after initial 
stable disease. 15 (52%) of patients achieved disease control, with a median 
duration of 10·9 months (95% CI 8·2-13·6). According to modified RECIST, one 
patient (3%) achieved a partial response and 11 (38%) patients achieved disease 
control rate. Grade 1-2 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 26 (90%) 
patients and grade 3-4 adverse events in two (7%) patients. The most common 
treatment-related adverse events were gastrointestinal, dermatological, and 
fever.
INTERPRETATION: Our results suggest that the intensified schedule of 
tremelimumab investigated seems to have clinical and immunological activity in 
patients with advanced malignant mesothelioma, and a good safety profile. The 
same intensified schedule is now being investigated in an ongoing randomised, 
double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2b study.

CONTEXT: Cryoablation (CA) is a minimally invasive modality with low 
complication rates, but its use in urology is relatively recent.
OBJECTIVE: To summarize available evidence for CA for small renal masses (SRMs) 
and to assess the selection criteria, complications, and functional and 
oncologic results based on the latest CA literature.
EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: A systematic literature search of the Medline, Embase, and 
Scopus databases was performed in August 2014 using Medical Subject Headings and 
free-text protocol. The following search terms were included: kidney 
cryosurgery, renal cryosurgery, kidney cryoablation, renal cryoablation, kidney 
cryotherapy, and renal cryotherapy.
EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Due to the relatively recent mainstream utilization of CA 
and lack of long-term efficacy data from large prospective or randomized 
studies, most of the data available on CA are limited to treatment of SRMs in 
patients who are often older or are poor surgical candidates. The rates of major 
complications across the CA literature remain relatively low. Studies assessing 
renal function after CA suggest a degree of functional decline following CA 
because proper application includes freezing of a tumor margin; however, often 
this is not clinically significant. Specific oncologic outcomes should be 
evaluated in patients with biopsy-proven renal cell carcinoma; when SRM series 
include benign or unbiopsied tumors, the results of these outcomes are skewed. 
Although earlier series were suggestive of a higher recurrence rate after CA, 
some studies have challenged this view reporting recurrence rates comparable 
with extirpative nephron-sparing surgery.
CONCLUSIONS: CA represents an alternative approach to treatment for patients 
diagnosed with renal neoplasm. There is no consensus within the literature on 
the best patient selection criteria. Due to higher rates of treatment failure, 
it is often not offered to patients with minimal comorbidities and good life 
expectancy. In terms of functional outcomes, CA signifies a modality with 
minimum impact on renal function; however, well-designed studies precisely 
assessing this factor are lacking. CA is a minimally invasive modality with 
suitably low rates of complications, particularly if delivered via the 
percutaneous route.
PATIENT SUMMARY: Cryoablation (CA) represents an alternative approach for 
treating renal neoplasm. Excellent functional outcomes and low rates of 
complications make CA an ideal minimally invasive modality. Patient selection 
criteria and oncologic outcomes require further study.

CONTEXT: The widespread use of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening has led 
to the detection of more indolent prostate cancer (PCa) in healthy men. PCa 
treatment and screening must therefore balance the potential for life gained 
against the potential for harm. Fundamental to this balance is physician 
awareness of a patient's estimated life expectancy (LE).
OBJECTIVE: To review the evidence on LE differences between men diagnosed with 
PCa and the general population. To examine clinician- and model-predicted LE and 
publicly available LE calculators.
EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: A comprehensive search of the PubMed database between 1990 
and September 2014 was performed according to Preferred Reporting Items for 
Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. Free text protocols of 
the following search terms were used "life expectancy prostate cancer", "life 
expectancy non-cancer", "non-cancer mortality prostate", and 
"comorbidity-adjusted life expectancy". Two internet search engines were queried 
daily for 1 mo for the search term "life expectancy calculator", and the top 20 
results were examined.
EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Of 992 articles and 32 websites screened, 17 articles and 
nine websites were selected for inclusion. Men with non-screening-detected PCa 
and distant disease at diagnosis were found to have shorter LE than age-matched 
peers, whereas men with localized PCa had prolonged LE. In general, 
clinician-predicted 10-yr LE was pessimistic and of limited accuracy; however, 
model-predicted LE provided only modest improvements in accuracy (c-index of 
models 0.65-0.84). Online LE calculators provide consistent LE estimates, but 
government life tables provide LE estimates near the mean for all calculators 
examined.
CONCLUSIONS: The accuracy of clinician-predicted survival is limited, and while 
available statistical models offer improvement in discrimination, it is unclear 
whether they provide advantages over freely available government life tables.
PATIENT SUMMARY: We examined differences in life expectancy between men 
diagnosed with prostate cancer and the general population, and ways of 
predicting life expectancy to help guide treatment decisions. We found that 
current models for predicting life expectancy specific to prostate cancer might 
not be any better than government life tables or simple rules of thumb.

BACKGROUND: Chronic infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 2 or 3 can 
be treated with sofosbuvir without interferon. Because sofosbuvir is costly, its 
benefits should be compared with the additional resources used.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of sofosbuvir-based treatments for 
HCV genotype 2 or 3 infection in the United States.
DESIGN: Monte Carlo simulation, including deterministic and probabilistic 
sensitivity analyses.
DATA SOURCES: Randomized trials, observational cohorts, and national health care 
spending surveys.
TARGET POPULATION: 8 patient types defined by HCV genotype (2 vs. 3), treatment 
history (naive vs. experienced), and cirrhosis status (noncirrhotic vs. 
cirrhotic).
TIME HORIZON: Lifetime.
PERSPECTIVE: Payer.
INTERVENTION: Sofosbuvir-based therapies, pegylated interferon-ribavirin, and no 
therapy.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Discounted quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), costs, and 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs).
RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: The ICER of sofosbuvir-based treatment was less 
than $100,000 per QALY in cirrhotic patients (genotype 2 or 3 and 
treatment-naive or treatment-experienced) and in treatment-experienced 
noncirrhotic patients but was greater than $200,000 per QALY in treatment-naive 
noncirrhotic patients.
RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: The ICER of sofosbuvir-based therapy for 
treatment-naive noncirrhotic patients with genotype 2 or 3 infection was less 
than $100,000 per QALY when the cost of sofosbuvir was reduced by approximately 
40% and 60%, respectively. In probabilistic sensitivity analyses, 
cost-effectiveness conclusions were robust to uncertainty in treatment efficacy.
LIMITATION: The analysis did not consider possible benefits of preventing HCV 
transmission.
CONCLUSION: Sofosbuvir provides good value for money for treatment-experienced 
patients with HCV genotype 2 or 3 infection and those with cirrhosis. At their 
current cost, sofosbuvir-based regimens for treatment-naive noncirrhotic 
patients exceed willingness-to-pay thresholds commonly cited in the United 
States.
