BACKGROUND: In patients undergoing induction chemotherapy for acute myeloid 
leukemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), posaconazole has been proven 
more effective in the prevention of invasive fungal infection (IFI) than 
fluconazole or itraconazole (standard azoles) The current analysis seeks to 
estimate the cost effectiveness of prophylactic posaconazole compared with 
standard azoles in AML or MDS patients with severe chemotherapy-induced 
neutropenia in Sweden.
METHODS: A decision-analytic model was used to estimate life expectancy, costs, 
and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Efficacy data were derived from a phase 
III clinical trial. Life expectancy and quality of life data were collected from 
the literature. A modified Delphi method was used to gather expert opinion on 
resource use for an IFI. Unit costs were captured from hospital and pharmacy 
pricelists. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) was used to investigate 
the impact of uncertainty in the model parameters on the cost-effectiveness 
results.
RESULTS: The estimated mean direct cost per patient with posaconazole 
prophylaxis was 46,893 Swedish kronor (SEK) (€5,387) and SEK50,017 (€5,746) with 
standard azoles. Prophylaxis with posaconazole resulted in 0.075 QALYs gained 
compared with standard azoles. At a cost-effectiveness threshold of 
SEK500,000/QALY the PSA demonstrated a more than 95 % probability that 
posaconazole is cost effective versus standard azoles for the prevention of IFI 
in high-risk neutropenic patients in Sweden.
CONCLUSION: Given the assumptions, methods, and data used, posaconazole is 
expected to be cost effective compared with standard azoles when used as 
antifungal prophylaxis in AML or MDS patients with chemotherapy-induced 
prolonged neutropenia in Sweden.

Life expectancy in multiple myeloma has significantly increased. However, a high 
incidence of chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) can negatively 
influence quality of life during this period. This study applied functional 
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to compare areas associated with central pain 
processing in patients with multiple myeloma who had chemotherapy induced 
peripheral neuropathy (MM-CIPN) with those from healthy volunteers (HV). 
Twenty-four participants (n = 12 MM-CIPN, n = 12 HV) underwent Blood Oxygen 
Level-Dependent (BOLD) fMRI at 3T whilst noxious heat-pain stimuli were applied 
to the foot and then thigh. Patients with MM-CIPN demonstrated greater 
activation during painful stimulation in the precuneus compared to HV 
(p = 0.014, FWE-corrected). Patients with MM-CIPN exhibited hypo-activation of 
the right superior frontal gyrus compared to HV (p = 0.031, FWE-corrected). 
Significant positive correlation existed between the total neuropathy score 
(reduced version) and activation in the frontal operculum (close to insular 
cortex) during foot stimulation in patients with MM-CIPN (p = 0.03, 
FWE-corrected; adjusted R2 = 0.87). Painful stimuli delivered to MM-CIPN 
patients evoke differential activation of distinct cortical regions, reflecting 
a unique pattern of central pain processing compared with healthy volunteers. 
This characteristic activation pattern associated with pain furthers the 
understanding of the pathophysiology of painful chemotherapy induced peripheral 
neuropathy. Functional MRI provides a tool for monitoring cerebral changes 
during anti-cancer and analgesic treatment.

OBJECTIVES: Biliary atresia (BA) is the most common liver disease leading to 
liver transplantation (LT) during childhood. The optimal timing of listing and 
LT for children with failed portoenterostomy (PE) is not clear. The aim of our 
study was to determine the optimal timing of LT for children with BA and failed 
PE by using a Markov model simulation analysis.
METHODS: A Markov model was constructed presenting the progression of the 
severity of liver status for patients with BA who underwent PE before 60 days 
old. Three treatment strategies were compared: LT for moderate liver disease 
(MLD), LT for severe liver disease (SLD), and no LT, and 10,000 patients were 
simulated in each strategy. Health states were defined as LT, early repeat LT 
(≤30 days after LT), late repeat LT (>30 days after LT), status post-LT (period 
after first LT), and death.
RESULTS: For patients with an available liver for transplantation (living 
donors), LT at MLD was associated with an increase of 17.4% additional expected 
life-years (LY) as compared with LT at SLD. Patient survival rates after 10 
years were 84.7% and 75.5% in the MLD and SLD strategies, respectively. For the 
patients with no LT, the survival rate after 10 years was 48.1%. When the 
probability of deceased donor LT was lower than 50% from time of listing at 3 
months, there was no increase in expected LY of MLD strategy. "No LT" resulted 
in approximately 60% reduction of expected LY compared with LT for patients with 
SLD.
CONCLUSIONS: Our model suggests that early listing and transplantation is 
beneficial in patients with an available liver for transplantation. For patients 
in whom the probability for LT is low, there appears to be no advantage to early 
listing. A validation of the present model in a "real" cohort of patients with 
BA is needed.

Is chronic obstructive pulmonary disease a disease of aging?

Clinic, University of Padova, Padua, Italy.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a disease that usually presents 
clinically at an advanced age, after years of smoking cigarettes. It is usually 
believed that aging and its biological consequences are important mechanisms in 
the disease pathogenesis. This concept has maintained the focus of studies on 
COPD in old-age individuals. Here we analyze the possible role of aging from a 
different point of view and introduce different concepts that might be 
considered useful additions to the understanding of the disease. Essentially, we 
propose and show evidence that COPD is a disease of the young susceptible smoker 
that progresses over time and manifests in older age because we live longer and 
not so much because of the effect of aging itself; we examine the concept of 
cell senescence, the basis of tissue aging, and how stressors like the ones 
produced by smoking can accelerate cell senescence with all of its untoward 
consequences in COPD. We thus finally suggest that COPD might accelerate aging 
rather than be a consequence of it. In conclusion, we suggest that COPD could be 
considered a disease of the predisposed young individual that manifests 
clinically in old age because we live longer, with all of its consequences.

BACKGROUND: Mortality studies of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients are scarce.
OBJECTIVE: To assess mortality of MS patients included in a large MS cohort from 
the county of Bizkaia in Spain.
METHODS: Patients were collected from a dynamic population-based cohort of 
patients with MS from the county of Bizkaia (named the 'Bizkaia cohort') in the 
Basque Country (Spain). Data from official registries were used for estimating 
mortality indicators.
RESULTS: During a 24-year period (1987-2011), a total of 1,283 patients were 
included in the Bizkaia cohort. Eighty-nine patients (6.9%) had died before 
December 31, 2011. The standardized mortality ratio was 2.78 for the whole group 
(3.26 for men and 2.73 for women), with a decreased life expectancy of 6.53 
years. The mean survival from the onset of MS in deceased patients was 22.4 
years. Death was related directly or indirectly to MS in 57 patients and 
unrelated in 27, while the cause of death was unknown in the remaining 5. 
Respiratory infection and sepsis were the most frequent MS-related causes of 
death. Differences in survival according to gender or disease course were not 
observed.
CONCLUSION: Patients with MS included in the 'Bizkaia cohort' had an almost 
threefold increase in the risk for death. Life expectancy is reduced by 6-10 
years.

BACKGROUND: In Malawi the orthopaedic clinical officer (OCO) training programme 
trains non-physician clinicians in musculoskeletal care. We studied the 
cost-effectiveness of this program.
METHODS: Hospital logbooks were reviewed for data pertaining to activity in 
seven district hospitals over a 6-month period. The total costs were divided by 
the total effectiveness, calculated as disability adjusted life years (DALYs) 
averted.
RESULTS: The total cost-effectiveness of providing orthopaedic care through the 
OCO training programme was US$92.06 per DALY averted. The mean per hospital was 
US$138.75 (95% CI: US$69.58-207.91) per DALY averted which is very 
cost-effective when compared with other health interventions. Of the 837 
patients treated 63% were aged <15 years and 36% were in the 'economically 
active' demographic of ages 15-74 years.
CONCLUSION: Training of clinical officers in orthopaedic surgery is very 
cost-effective and allows transfer of skills into rural areas. The demographics 
suggest that failure to provide such care would have a negative economic impact.

Health care expenditure disparities in the European Union and underlying 
factors: a distribution dynamics approach.

Villaverde J(1), Maza A, Hierro M.

villavej@unican.es.

This paper examines health care expenditure (HCE) disparities between the 
European Union countries over the period 1995-2010. By means of using a 
continuous version of the distribution dynamics approach, the key conclusions 
are that the reduction in disparities is very weak and, therefore, persistence 
is the main characteristic of the HCE distribution. In view of these findings, a 
preliminary attempt is made to add some insights into potentially main factors 
behind the HCE distribution. The results indicate that whereas per capita income 
is by far the main determinant, the dependency ratio and female labour 
participation do not play any role in explaining the HCE distribution; as for 
the rest of the factors studied (life expectancy, infant mortality, R&D 
expenditure and public HCE expenditure share), we find that their role falls 
somewhat in between.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the optimal imaging strategy for ICH incorporating CTA 
or DSA with and without a NCCT risk stratification algorithm.
METHODS: A Markov model included costs, outcomes, prevalence of a vascular 
lesion, and the sensitivity and specificity of a risk stratification algorithm 
from the literature. The four imaging strategies were: (a) CTA screening of the 
entire cohort; (b) CTA only in those where NCCT suggested a high or 
indeterminate likelihood of a lesion; (c) DSA screening of the entire cohort and 
(d) DSA only for those with a high or indeterminate suspicion of a lesion 
following NCCT. Branch d was the comparator.
RESULTS: Age of the cohort and the probability of an underlying lesion 
influenced the choice of optimal imaging strategy. With a low suspicion for a 
lesion (<12%), branch (a) was the optimal strategy for a willingness-to-pay of 
$100,000/QALY. Branch (a) remained the optimal strategy in younger people (<35 
years) with a risk below 15%. If the probability of a lesion was >15%, branch 
(b) became preferred strategy. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed 
that branch (b) was the optimal choice 70-72% of the time over varying 
willingness-to-pay values.
CONCLUSIONS: CTA has a clear role in the evaluation of people presenting with 
ICH, though the choice of CTA everyone or CTA using risk stratification depends 
on age and likelihood of finding a lesion.

[Radical cancer surgery of renal cell and prostate carcinoma with hematogenous 
metastasis: benefits].

[Article in German]

The therapeutic role of cytoreductive surgery for urogenital malignancies is 
controversially discussed in the literature. The current article critically 
reflects the potential impact of cytoreductive surgery in patients with renal 
cell cancer and prostate cancer with locoregional lymph node or systemic 
metastases based on a review of the literature and personal experience.Even in 
the era of molecular targeted therapies in metastatic renal cell cancer, 
cytoreductive radical nephrectomy seems to exert survival benefit when compared 
to systemic therapy alone if (1) patients demonstrate a good ECOG performance 
status, (2) exhibit good or intermediate prognosis according to the Heng 
criteria, (3) cerebral metastases have been excluded, and (4) >90% of the total 
cancer volume can be eliminated. Preliminary clinical studies suggest that 
neoadjuvant systemic treatment might be associated with a significantly reduced 
1-year mortality rate.For prostate cancer cytoreductive radical prostatectomy is 
one of the guideline-recommended treatment options for men with intrapelvic 
lymph node metastases resulting in survival benefit when compared to androgen 
deprivation as monotherapy. Cytoreductive radical prostatectomy should be 
performed (1) in the presence of limited intrapelvic lymph node metastasis 
without bulky disease, (2) if complete resectability of the primary cancer and 
its metastasis can be achieved by extended radical prostatectomy and extended 
pelvic lymphadenectomy, (3) if the patient is included in a multimodality 
approach, and (4) if the life expectancy is > 10 years.The role of cytoreductive 
radical prostatectomy in men with osseous metastases remains unclear due to the 
lack of large clinical trials. Despite the presence of the first promising 
studies, it is not justified to perform cytoreductive radical prostatectomy 
outside clinical trials. Preliminary results from small studies indicate that 
patients with minimal metastatic burden, PSA decrease < 1.0 ng/ml following 
neoadjuvant ADT for 6 months and complete resectability of the tumor exhibit the 
best prognosis to benefit from this new surgical approach.

BACKGROUND: Only one-third of patients with depression respond fully to 
treatment with antidepressant medication. However, there is little robust 
evidence to guide the management of those whose symptoms are 'treatment 
resistant'.
OBJECTIVE: The CoBalT trial examined the clinical effectiveness and 
cost-effectiveness of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) as an adjunct to usual 
care (including pharmacotherapy) for primary care patients with 
treatment-resistant depression (TRD) compared with usual care alone.
DESIGN: Pragmatic, multicentre individually randomised controlled trial with 
follow-up at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. A subset took part in a qualitative study 
investigating views and experiences of CBT, reasons for completing/not 
completing therapy, and usual care for TRD.
SETTING: General practices in Bristol, Exeter and Glasgow, and surrounding 
areas.
PARTICIPANTS: Patients aged 18-75 years who had TRD [on antidepressants for ≥ 6 
weeks, had adhered to medication, Beck Depression Inventory, 2nd version 
(BDI-II) score of ≥ 14 and fulfilled the International Classification of 
Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth edition criteria for depression]. 
Individuals were excluded who (1) had bipolar disorder/psychosis or major 
alcohol/substance abuse problems; (2) were unable to complete the 
questionnaires; or (3) were pregnant, as were those currently receiving 
CBT/other psychotherapy/secondary care for depression, or who had received CBT 
in the past 3 years.
INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomised, using a computer-generated code, to 
usual care or CBT (12-18 sessions) in addition to usual care.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was 'response', defined as ≥ 50% 
reduction in depressive symptoms (BDI-II score) at 6 months compared with 
baseline. Secondary outcomes included BDI-II score as a continuous variable, 
remission of symptoms (BDI-II score of < 10), quality of life, anxiety and 
antidepressant use at 6 and 12 months. Data on health and social care use, 
personal costs, and time off work were collected at 6 and 12 months. Costs from 
these three perspectives were reported using a cost-consequence analysis. A 
cost-utility analysis compared health and social care costs with quality 
adjusted life-years.
RESULTS: A total of 469 patients were randomised (intervention: n = 234; usual 
care: n = 235), with 422 participants (90%) and 396 (84%) followed up at 6 and 
12 months. Ninety-five participants (46.1%) in the intervention group met 
criteria for 'response' at 6 months compared with 46 (21.6%) in the usual-care 
group {odds ratio [OR] 3.26 [95% confidence interval (CI) 2.10 to 5.06], p < 
0.001}. In repeated measures analyses using data from 6 and 12 months, the OR 
for 'response' was 2.89 (95% CI 2.03 to 4.10, p < 0.001) and for a secondary 
'remission' outcome (BDI-II score of < 10) 2.74 (95% CI 1.82 to 4.13, p < 
0.001). The mean cost of CBT per participant was £ 910, the incremental health 
and social care cost £ 850, the incremental QALY gain 0.057 and incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio £ 14,911. Forty participants were interviewed. Patients 
described CBT as challenging but helping them to manage their depression; listed 
social, emotional and practical reasons for not completing treatment; and 
described usual care as mainly taking medication.
CONCLUSIONS: Among patients who have not responded to antidepressants, 
augmenting usual care with CBT is effective in reducing depressive symptoms, and 
these effects, including outcomes reflecting remission, are maintained over 12 
months. The intervention was cost-effective based on the National Institute for 
Health and Care Excellence threshold. Patients may experience CBT as difficult 
but effective. Further research should evaluate long-term effectiveness, as this 
would have major implications for the recommended treatment of depression.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To describe and understand why the HIV-infected population is 
aging in high-income countries, the rate and causes of death in comparison with 
the general population, and to illustrate the impact of combined antiretroviral 
therapy (cART) on life expectancy and to discuss needs for further researches.
RECENT FINDINGS: The HIV-infected population is aging in high-income countries 
because of increasing age at HIV infection, higher risk of late diagnosis in 
older individuals and decrease in the AIDS-defining and non-AIDS-defining death 
rates. Compared with the general population, the risk of death is no longer 
elevated in many non-IDU-infected individuals successfully treated with cART.
SUMMARY: Further researches are needed to reconcile the absence of increased 
mortality risk in HIV-infected individuals with controlled viral load and 
restored immunity with the observed higher risk of comorbidities, such as 
cardiovascular diseases and non-AIDS-defining cancers, and the accelerated aging 
hypothesis, in particular, to help stratify HIV individuals who are at risk; to 
define the optimal management of multimorbidity and polypharmacy, even in the 
absence of a higher comorbidity risk; and to better account for increased life 
expectancy and multimorbidity burden to plan the future needs in care for 
HIV-infected individuals.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: It is now widely accepted that HIV-infected individuals 
remain at a higher risk for mortality and age-related morbidities than the 
general population, but several unresolved issues need to be addressed by the 
research community in the coming years to further improve the health of 
HIV-infected individuals in the modern treatment era.
RECENT FINDINGS: Although recent studies have helped to better define the 
contribution of HIV to life expectancy and morbidity in the modern 
antiretroviral therapy (ART) era, questions remain about the generalizability of 
these findings to a future HIV-infected population that is expected to be much 
older. Furthermore, although a consensus has emerged that the persistent 
inflammatory state contributes to morbidity and mortality in this setting, the 
relative contributions of this process, health-related behaviours, comorbidities 
and medication toxicities remain incompletely understood. Lastly, significant 
uncertainty remains over the root causes of the persistent inflammatory state, 
the specific immunologic pathways to target with interventions and the most 
appropriate biomarkers to use for surrogate outcomes in pilot trials of 
immune-based interventions.
SUMMARY: Each of these issues will be addressed in this review, highlighting 
recently published and presented studies that inform the discussion, and 
recommendations will be made for prioritizing the future research agenda.

OBJECTIVE: To compare the recovery of urinary continence (UC) after 
robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) in men aged ≥70 and <70 years at 
1-year follow-up and to assess for preoperative predictors of UC recovery, as 
older, healthy men with localised prostate cancer are often denied curative 
surgical treatment on the grounds of worse UC recovery.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: In all, 262 patients with prostate cancer having undergone 
RARP between May 2008 and September 2012, under the care of two consultant 
urological surgeons at three Melbourne hospitals, were identified. Patients were 
categorised based on their age ≥70 and <70 years and compared with regards to 
two endpoints; percentage fully continent and mean pads/day at 4-6 weeks, and 3, 
6, 9 and 12 months after RARP.
RESULTS: Of the 262 men, 9% (24) were aged ≥70 years. Older men had higher PSA 
levels (P = 0.007) and clinical stages (P < 0.001) compared with the younger 
cohort. There were more non-nerve sparing procedures in the older group (P = 
0.009) and a shorter mean operative time (P = 0.004). At 4-6 weeks after RARP, 
the number of pads used per day was greater in older men (P = 0.03) and there 
was a trend towards fewer older men being fully continent (P = 0.08) than their 
younger counterparts; however, by 3 months and all time-points thereafter there 
was no difference. The 12-month UC rates were 89% and 92% for men aged <70 and 
≥70 years, respectively. Neither age, body mass index, D'Amico risk group, nerve 
sparing nor use of Rocco suture were predictors of time to UC recovery.
CONCLUSION: UC recovery after RARP in men aged ≥70 years appears comparable to 
younger men and therefore not a reason to deny older men with a reasonable 
life-expectancy curative surgical treatment of localised prostate cancer.

Decision making about change of medication for comorbid disease at the end of 
life: an integrative review.

The main goal of palliative care is to improve quality of life by treating 
symptoms in patients with life-threatening illnesses. Most patients suffer from 
more than five severe comorbidities in the last 6 months of life. However, for 
patients receiving palliative care, interventions to prevent possible long-term 
complications of these comorbidities are no longer the primary aim of care. This 
paper aimed to review the literature regarding decision making about medication 
for comorbid disease at the end of life, defined as a life expectancy <3 months, 
and to formulate preliminary recommendations based on the existing literature. 
An integrative review approach was used. We searched the MEDLINE, EMBASE, and 
CINAHL databases. Papers were included if they had been published in the English 
language between 1 January 1995 and 31 December 2013, with an abstract. 
Additional studies were identified by searching bibliographies. Factors to 
consider when systematically reviewing medications are the goals of care, 
remaining life expectancy, treatment targets, time until benefit, number needed 
to treat, number needed to harm, and adverse drug reactions. Existing research 
focuses particularly on the use of certain drug classes during end-of-life care, 
including statins, antihypertensive agents, anticoagulants, antihyperglycaemic 
agents and antibiotics. Based on the results of this review, we made preliminary 
recommendations for these medication groups. Medication that does not benefit 
the patient in any way should be avoided. The aim of medication at the end of 
life should be symptom control. There is a need for prospective trials to give 
further insight into the decision-making process of medication management at the 
end of life.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Drug therapy in patients with advanced heart failure 
and limited life expectancy may be of no benefit or even inappropriate. The aim 
of this study was to analyze the appropriateness of medication prescribed to 
patients with advanced heart failure and limited life expectancy, considering as 
such an expected median survival of less than 6 months.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed data on all patients with advanced heart 
failure who met criteria for limited life expectancy and who died in the 
geriatric ward of a tertiary hospital over a four-and-a-half-year period. We 
analyzed treatments prescribed before admission, especially drugs used for 
prophylaxis or to prolong life.
RESULTS: A total of 72 patients were included. The mean age was 85.4 years, and 
52.3 % were women. Mean Charlson index was 3.2. Prophylactic medications taken 
by patients at admission were antiplatelets in 40 patients (55.6 %), oral 
anticoagulants in 17 (23.6 %), statins in 14 (19.4 %), and osteoporosis 
medication in nine (12.5 %). Medications taken to prolong survival were 
angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor antagonists 
in 29 patients (40.3 %). Other medications were iron supplements in 19 patients 
(26.4 %), vitamins in two (2.8 %), and acetylcholinesterase inhibitors in two 
(2.8 %).
CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that patients with advanced heart failure and 
limited life expectancy were receiving an excessive number of prophylactic 
medications, drugs to prolong life, and other inappropriate treatments. These 
findings emphasize the need to review drug therapy in an individualized manner 
in elderly patients with advanced stages of heart disease and a poor prognosis.

17α-ethynylestradiol (EE2) is a synthetic hormone, which is a derivative of the 
natural hormone, estradiol (E2). EE2 is an orally bio-active estrogen, and is 
one of the most commonly used medications for humans as well as livestock and 
aquaculture activity. EE2 has become a widespread problem in the environment due 
to its high resistance to the process of degradation and its tendency to (i) 
absorb organic matter, (ii) accumulate in sediment and (iii) concentrate in 
biota. Numerous studies have reported the ability of EE2 to alter sex 
determination, delay sexual maturity, and decrease the secondary sexual 
characteristics of exposed organisms even at a low concentration (ng/L) by 
mimicking its natural analogue, 17β-estradiol (E2). Thus, the aim of this review 
is to provide an overview of the science regarding EE2, the concentration levels 
in the environment (water, sediment and biota) and summarize the effects of this 
compound on exposed biota at various concentrations, stage life, sex, and 
species. The challenges in respect of EE2 include the extension of the limited 
database on the EE2 pollution profile in the environment, its fate and transport 
mechanism, as well as the exposure level of EE2 for better prediction and 
definition revision of EE2 toxicity end points, notably for the purpose of 
environmental risk assessment.

Coarctation of the aorta is typically a disease of childhood and early 
adulthood, and there is a reduced life expectancy in patients who have not 
undergone correction. Survival to older age is rare, due to severe 
cardiovascular complications. We describe the case of a woman first diagnosed 
with coarctation of aorta at an advanced age.

OBJECTIVES: The value of a health technology can be measured in terms of cost 
and benefit on two-dimensional co-ordinates. This study is to quantitatively 
analyze the correlation and to conduct a regression on the X-Y plane constituted 
by cost and QALYs (quality-adjusted life years) associated with the first line 
treatment, the maintenance treatment, and the second line treatment for 
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
METHODS: The cost-effectiveness data of the cost and QALYs were extracted, with 
respect to the three categories of the NSCLC treatment, from the CEA Registry at 
Tufts Medical Center, regarding the literature published from 2000-2011. As a 
result, 44 QALY-cost ratios were identified.
RESULTS: Based on those extracted data, the correlation and regression analyses 
were performed by mathematical model using log and square-root functions. The 
plotted ratios stratified by the three stages for the NSCLC treatment were 
visually grouped into three clusters. There were statistically significant 
differences among the correlation coefficients of the cluster. In regression, 
the log model was found to be better fitted than the square-root model; 
formulating QALY = -1.12 + 0.16 log(Cost), -1.99 + 0.28 log(Cost), and 
-0.69 + 0.10 log(Cost) for the first line, the maintenance, and the second line 
treatment, respectively. Monetary units were standardized to 2008 US dollars.
CONCLUSION: A good methodological potential was confirmed so as to assess the 
Incremental Cost Effectiveness Ratio (ICER) variations, considering 
stratification by multiple factors such as disease and treatment categories. 
This study has certain limitations, such as the small number of included 
articles and the stratification, not reflecting a factor of new genetic 
findings.

A Canadian cost-effectiveness analysis of transcatheter mitral valve repair with 
the MitraClip system in high surgical risk patients with significant mitral 
regurgitation.

OBJECTIVE: In patients with significant mitral regurgitation (MR) at high risk 
of mortality and morbidity from mitral valve surgery, transcatheter mitral valve 
repair with the MitraClip System is associated with a reduction in MR and 
improved quality-of-life and functional status compared with baseline. The 
objective was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of MitraClip therapy compared 
with standard of care in patients with significant MR at high risk for mitral 
valve surgery from a Canadian payer perspective.
METHODS: A decision analytic model was developed to estimate the lifetime costs, 
life years, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and incremental cost per life 
year and QALY gained for patients receiving MitraClip therapy compared with 
standard of care. Treatment-specific overall survival, risk of clinical events, 
quality-of-life, and resource utilization were obtained from the Endovascular 
Valve Edge-to-Edge REpair High Risk Study (EVEREST II HRS). Health utility and 
unit costs (CAD $2013) were taken from the published literature. Sensitivity 
analyses were conducted to explore the impact of alternative assumptions and 
parameter uncertainty on results.
RESULTS: The base case incremental cost per QALY gained was $23,433. RESULTS 
were most sensitive to alternative assumptions regarding overall survival, time 
horizon, and risk of hospitalization for congestive heart failure (CHF). 
Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed MitraClip therapy to have a 92% chance 
of being cost-effective compared with standard of care at a willingness-to-pay 
threshold of $50,000 per QALY gained.
STUDY LIMITATIONS: Key limitations include the small number of patients included 
in the EVEREST II HRS which informed the analysis, the limited data available to 
inform clinical events and disease progression in the concurrent comparator 
group, and the lack of a comparator group from a randomized control trial.
CONCLUSION: MitraClip therapy is likely a cost-effective option for the 
treatment of patients at high risk for mitral valve surgery with significant MR.

Cost-effectiveness analysis of annual Trichomonas vaginalis screening and 
treatment in HIV-positive women to prevent HIV transmission.

South Carolina, Charleston, SC; †Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology 
Division of Maternal Fetal Medicine, Southern Illinois University, Carbondale, 
IL; and Departments of ‡Pediatrics and §Health Science and Research, Medical 
University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC.

BACKGROUND: Because of a high incidence of Trichomonas infection among 
HIV-positive women, annual screening and treatment are recommended. Trichomonas 
infection is associated with a 2-fold risk of HIV transmission. The objective of 
this study was to determine if annual screening is cost-effective for the 
prevention of new HIV cases in susceptible male partners secondary to 
Trichomonas infection in HIV-positive women.
METHODS: A decision tree analysis was constructed to model the costs of 
Trichomonas screening, treatment, and follow-up. 200 women cycled through the 
model for a period of 12 months. One hundred women were unscreened and 100 were 
screened and treated per recommendations.
RESULTS: Annual Trichomonas screening and treatment saves US $553 (US $475- US 
$645) per woman in the prevention of HIV transmission to male partners. The 
cost-effectiveness of this strategy was maintained across all assumptions in a 
sensitivity analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: Trichomonas screening and treatment for the purpose of decreasing 
new HIV infections is not only cost-effective but also cost saving in 
HIV-positive women. If Centers for Disease Control and Prevention treatment 
guidelines were followed in all HIV-positive women living in the United States, 
the lifetime cost of new HIV infections prevented would approximate US 
$159,264,000 and could potentially prevent new HIV cases secondary to 
female-to-male transmissions.

BACKGROUND: Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common form of lung 
cancer. Some epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase (EGFR-TK) 
mutations make tumours responsive to treatment with EGFR-TK inhibitors 
(EGFR-TKIs) but less responsive to treatment with standard chemotherapy. 
Patients with NSCLC are therefore tested for EGFR-TK tumour gene mutations to 
inform treatment decisions. There are a variety of tests available to detect 
these mutations. The different tests vary in the specific mutations that they 
attempt to detect, the amount of tumour cells needed for the test to work, the 
time that it takes to give a result, the error rate of the test, and the cost of 
the test.
OBJECTIVE: To compare the performance and cost-effectiveness of EGFR-TK mutation 
tests used to identify previously untreated adults with locally advanced or 
metastatic NSCLC, who may benefit from first-line treatment with TKIs.
DATA SOURCES: Twelve databases to August 2012 [including MEDLINE, MEDLINE 
In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations and Daily Update (OvidSP), EMBASE, 
Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR), Cochrane Central Register of 
Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE), 
Health Technology Assessment database (HTA), Science Citation Index (SCI), Latin 
American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS), BIOSIS Previews, 
NIHR Health Technology Assessment programme, PROSPERO (International Prospective 
Register of Systematic Reviews)], research registers and conference proceedings. 
A web-based survey gathered data on technical performance of EGFR-TK mutation 
tests.
METHODS: Randomised controlled trials were assessed for methodological quality 
using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Diagnostic accuracy studies were assessed 
using QUADAS-2. There were insufficient data for meta-analysis. For accuracy 
studies, we calculated sensitivity and specificity together with 95% confidence 
intervals (CIs). Survival data were summarised as hazard ratios and tumour 
response data as relative risks, with 95% CIs. The health-economic analysis 
considered the long-term costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) 
associated with different tests followed by treatment with either standard 
chemotherapy or a TKI. Direct sequencing was taken as the comparator. The de 
novo model consisted of a decision tree and a Markov model.
RESULTS: The survey indicated no differences between tests in batch size, 
turnaround time, number of failed samples or cost. Six studies provided data on 
the accuracy of EGFR-TK mutation testing for predicting response to treatment 
with TKIs. Estimates of accuracy were similar across studies. Six analyses 
provided data on the clinical effectiveness of TKIs compared with standard 
chemotherapy. There were no clear differences in the treatment effects reported 
by different studies, regardless of which EGFR mutation test was used to select 
patients. Cost-effectiveness analysis using 'Evidence on comparative 
effectiveness available' and 'Linked evidence' approaches: Therascreen(®) EGFR 
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) Kit (Qiagen, Venlo, the Netherlands) was both 
less effective and less costly than direct sequencing of all exon 19-21 
mutations at an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of £32,167 (comparative) 
and £32,190 (linked) per QALY lost. 'Assumption of equal prognostic value' 
approach: the lowest total strategy cost was [commercial-in-confidence (CiC) 
information has been removed] [Sanger sequencing or Roche cobas EGFR Mutation 
Testing Kit(®) (Roche Molecular Systems, Inc., Branchburg, NJ, USA)] compared 
with (CiC information has been removed) for the most expensive strategy 
(fragment length analysis combined with pyrosequencing).
LIMITATIONS: The cost-effectiveness analysis assumed that the differences in 
outcomes between the results of the trials were solely attributable to the 
different mutation tests used to distinguish between patients; this assumption 
ignores other factors that might explain this variation.
CONCLUSION: There was no strong evidence that any one EGFR mutation test had 
greater accuracy than any other test. Re-testing of stored samples from previous 
studies, where patient outcomes are already known, could be used to provide 
information on the relative effectiveness of TKIs and standard chemotherapy in 
patients with EGFR mutation-positive and mutation-negative tumours, where 
mutation status is determined using tests for which adequate data are currently 
unavailable.

Lower life expectancy among people with an HCV notification: a population-based 
linkage study.

Among people with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, liver disease-related 
deaths have risen over the last 20 years. Life expectancy has not been estimated 
in this population. HCV notifications (mandatory notification of 
anti-HCV-positive serology since 1991) reported to the New South Wales Health 
Department from 1992 to 2006 were linked to cause of death data. Abridged life 
tables were constructed from age-specific mortality rates. Life expectancy from 
ages 18-70 years for non-drug-related mortality causes was estimated using 
competing risk methods and compared to the general population of Australia. The 
cohort comprised 81 644 individuals with an HCV notification, with median 
follow-up of 7.6 years. Median age at notification was 34 years [interquartile 
range (IQR) 28-42] and 63% were male. Between 1992 and 2006, 4607 deaths 
occurred. Median age at liver- and drug-related death among males was 51 (IQR 
45-66) and 36 (IQR 31-42) years, respectively, and among females was 63 (IQR 
49-74) and 36 (IQR 30-41) years, respectively. In each year of follow-up before 
2000, 15-21% of deaths were liver- and 30-39% were drug-related. After 2000,
