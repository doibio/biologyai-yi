Bone pathologies such as osteoporosis (OTP) and osteoarthritis (OA) are rising 
in incidence with the worldwide rise in life expectancy. The diagnosis is 
usually obtained using imaging techniques such as densitometry, but with both 
being multifactorial diseases, several molecular mechanisms remain to be 
understood. Metabolomics offers the potential to detect global changes which can 
lead to the identification of biomarkers and a better insight in the progress of 
the diseases. Our aim was to compare the metabolic profiles of a cohort of 100 
postmenopausal women, including subcapital hip fragility fracture patients, 
women with severe OA of the hip that required the implantation of a hip 
prosthesis and controls, to find altered metabolites and networks. Nuclear 
magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy was used to obtain the metabolomic 
profiles of peripheral blood derived serum, and statistical analysis was 
performed using MATLAB V.6.5. 30 of the 73 metabolites analysed showed 
statistically significant differences in a 3-way ANOVA, and 11 of them were 
present in the comparison between OA and controls after adjustment by 
covariates, including amino acids, energy metabolism metabolites and 
phospholipid precursors. PLS-DA analysis shows a good discrimination between 
controls and fracture subjects with OA patients, and ROC curve analysis 
demonstrates that control and fracture subjects were accurately discriminated 
using the metabolome, but not OA. These results point to OA as an intermediate 
metabolic state between controls and fracture, and suggest that some metabolic 
shifts that happen after a fracture are also present at weaker intensity in the 
OA process.

BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease is a frequent complication after kidney 
transplantation and represents the leading cause of mortality in this 
population.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: We searched for the relevant articles in the National 
Institutes of Health library of medicine, transplant, cardiologic and 
nephrological journals.
RESULTS: The pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease in kidney transplant is 
multifactorial. Apart from non-modifiable risk factors, such as age, gender, 
genetic predisposition and ethnicity, several traditional and non-traditional 
modifiable risk factors contribute to its development. Traditional factors, such 
as diabetes, hypertension and dyslipidemia, may be present before and may worsen 
after transplantation. Immunosuppressants and impaired graft function may 
strongly influence the exacerbation of these comorbidities. However, in the last 
years, several studies showed that many other cardiovascular risk factors may be 
involved in kidney transplantation, including hyperuricemia, inflammation, low 
klotho and elevated Fibroblast Growth Factor 23 levels, deficient levels of 
vitamin D, vascular calcifications, anemia and poor physical activity and 
quality of life.
CONCLUSIONS: The timely and effective treatment of time-honored and recently 
discovered modifiable risk factors represent the basis of the prevention of 
cardiovascular complications in kidney transplantation. Reduction of 
cardiovascular risk can improve the life expectancy, the quality of life and the 
allograft function and survival.

One of the common types of cancer for women is ovarian cancer. Still, at 
present, there are no drug therapies that can properly cure this deadly disease. 
However, early-stage detection could boost the life expectancy of the patients. 
The main aim of this work is to apply machine learning models along with 
statistical methods to the clinical data obtained from 349 patient individuals 
to conduct predictive analytics for early diagnosis. In statistical analysis, 
Student's t-test as well as log fold changes of two groups are used to find the 
significant blood biomarkers. Furthermore, a set of machine learning models 
including Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (DT), 
Extreme Gradient Boosting Machine (XGBoost), Logistic Regression (LR), Gradient 
Boosting Machine (GBM) and Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM) are used to 
build classification models to stratify benign-vs.-malignant ovarian cancer 
patients. Both of the analysis techniques recognized that the serumsamples 
carbohydrate antigen 125, carbohydrate antigen 19-9, carcinoembryonic antigen 
and human epididymis protein 4 are the top-most significant biomarkers as well 
as neutrophil ratio, thrombocytocrit, hematocrit blood samples, alanine 
aminotransferase, calcium, indirect bilirubin, uric acid, natriumas as general 
chemistry tests. Moreover, the results from predictive analysis suggest that the 
machine learning models can classify malignant patients from benign patients 
with accuracy as good as 91%. Since generally, early-stage detection is not 
available, machine learning detection could play a significant role in cancer 
diagnosis.

Objective: Petrous apex cholesterol granuloma (PACG) is a lesion that can give 
rise to different symptoms, and correlations with etiopathology are ambiguous. 
The aim of this study is to analyze the association between PACG symptoms and 
radiological findings at presentation, in order to establish a reproduceable 
pre-operative radiological evaluation and guide the surgical indication. 
Methods: PACG patients were collected in two tertiary care hospitals. All cases 
underwent CT/MRI to evaluate the cyst localization and erosion of surrounding 
structures. Typical and atypical symptoms were then analyzed and compared to 
radiologic findings established in accordance with the literature. Results: 
Twenty-nine patients were recruited; the most common symptoms were headache 
(69%), diplopia (20.7%) and fainting (24.1%), an atypical clinical manifestation 
related to jugular tubercle involvement. Significant associations between 
symptoms and radiologic findings were noted in terms of headache and temporal 
lobe compression (p = 0.04), fainting and jugular tubercle erosion (p < 0.001), 
vestibular symptoms and internal auditory canal erosion (p = 0.02), facial 
paresthesia and Meckel’s cave compression (p = 0.03), diplopia and Dorello canal 
involvement (p = 0.001), and tinnitus and cochlear basal turn erosion (p < 
0.001). All patients were treated via an endoscopic−endonasal approach, in which 
extension was tailored to each case. At a median follow-up of 46 months, 93.1% 
of patients experienced resolution of symptoms. Conclusions: This 
clinico-radiological series demonstrates associations between symptoms and 
anatomical subsites involved with PACG. Hence, it may guide the surgeon at the 
time of surgical decision, since it asserts that typical and atypical symptoms 
are actually related to PACG.

Polyoxymethylene (POM) fiber is a new polymer fiber with the potential to 
improve the performance of airport pavement concrete. The effect of POM fiber on 
the flexural fatigue properties of concrete is an important issue in its 
application for airport pavement concrete. In this study, four-point flexural 
fatigue experiments were conducted using ordinary performance concrete (OPC) and 
POM fiber airport pavement concrete (PFAPC) with fiber volume contents of 0.6% 
and 1.2%, at four stress levels, to examine the flexural fatigue characteristics 
of these materials. A two-parameter Weibull distribution test of flexural 
fatigue life was performed, after examining the change in flexural fatigue 
deformation using the cycle ratio (n/N). A flexural fatigue life equation was 
then constructed considering various failure probabilities (survival rate). The 
results show that POM fiber had no discernible impact on the static load 
strength of airport pavement concrete, and the difference between PFAPC and OPC 
in terms of static load strength was less than 5%. POM fiber can substantially 
increase the flexural fatigue deformation capacity of airport pavement concrete 
by almost 100%, but POM fiber had a different degree of detrimental impact on 
the fatigue life of airport pavement concrete compared to OPC, with a maximum 
decrease of 85%. The fatigue lives of OPC and PFAPC adhered to the two-parameter 
Weibull distribution, the single- and double-log fatigue equations considering 
various failure probabilities had a high fitting degree based on the 
two-parameter Weibull distribution, and their R2 was essentially over 0.90. The 
ultimate fatigue strength of PFAPC was roughly 4% lower than that of OPC. This 
study on the flexural fatigue properties of POM fiber airport pavement concrete 
has apparent research value for the extension of POM fiber to the construction 
of long-life airport pavements.

Objectives: This study evaluates the cost-effectiveness of adding 
prolonged-release (PR)-fampridine to best supportive care (BSC) versus BSC alone 
in adult multiple sclerosis patients with walking disability in China. Materials 
& methods: A hybrid decision tree and Markov model from both the societal and 
healthcare perspectives were constructed. Parameters were derived from clinical 
trials of PR-fampridine, published sources and clinical expert interviews. 
Results: Over a 10-year time horizon, adding PR-fampridine to BSC led to 0.15 
quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gain and lower costs, with incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios of -238,806 Chinese Yuan/QALY and -113,488 Chinese 
Yuan/QALY from the societal and healthcare perspectives, respectively. 
Conclusion: Compared with BSC alone, PR-fampridine plus BSC is considered an 
economically dominant strategy for the treatment of multiple sclerosis-related 
walking disability in China.

Green tea epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) and microRNA (miRNA) molecules 
modulate obesity. Nevertheless, it is still unknown whether EGCG modulates fat 
cell growth via miRNA-related signaling. In this study, white preadipocytes were 
used to examine whether the antimitogenic effect of EGCG on fat cells is 
regulated by the miR-143/MAPK7 pathway. We showed that EGCG upregulated the 
levels of miR-143, but not miR-155, in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. Moreover, EGCG 
downregulated MAPK7 mRNA and protein levels time- and dose-dependently. MAPK7 
expression increased during 3T3-L1 cell proliferation. miR-143 overexpression in 
the absence of EGCG mimicked the effects of EGCG to suppress preadipocyte growth 
and MAPK7 expression, whereas knockdown of miR-143 antagonized the EGCG-altered 
levels of miR-143, MAPK7, and pERK1/2 and reversed the EGCG-inhibited cell 
growth. These findings suggest that EGCG inhibits 3T3-L1 cell growth via 
miR-143/MAPK7 pathway.

The Asian lady beetle Harmonia axyridis (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) is a 
biological control agent that also may adversely impact other coccinellid 
species. Life table parameters were used to assess the population growth 
potential and the effects of interspecific competition between the invasive lady 
beetle H. axyridis and the native coccinellids Hippodamia convergens and 
Cycloneda sanguinea (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) under laboratory conditions at 
25 °C, using Schizaphis graminum (Hemiptera: Aphididae) as prey. The effects of 
the abiotic factors air temperature and humidity on these coccinellids by 
conducting a survey in a sorghum crop under average conditions of 18.1 °C and 
53.5%, respectively, were also assessed. Fecundity was higher in C. sanguinea 
(1021.0 eggs per female) and H. axyridis (1029.2 eggs per female) than in H. 
convergens (484.5 eggs per female). The majority of the life table parameters 
showed no significant differences. The instantaneous rates of population 
increase (rm) of C. sanguinea, H. axyridis, and H. convergens were 0.195, 0.198, 
and 0.194 d-1, respectively. Based on the life table parameters obtained in this 
study, all three species of Coccinellidae showed a similar capacity to control a 
S. graminum population.

BACKGROUND: Syphilis is a chronic infectious disease that has created 
challenging situations for humanity for centuries. Transmission can occur 
sexually or vertically, with great repercussions on populations, particularly 
among women and children. The present study presents information on the main 
burden imposed by syphilis generated by the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study 
2019 for Brazil and its 27 federated units.
METHODS: We described the metrics of incidence, deaths, years of life lost 
(YLLs), years lived with disability (YLDs), and disability-adjusted life years 
(DALYs), standardized by age and per 100,000 inhabitants, from 1990 to 2019, and 
we compared the disease burden between the years 1990 and 2019.
RESULTS: In Brazil, the disease burden increased between 2005 and 2019 for all 
metrics. Although a higher incidence of syphilis was found among women in 2019, 
DALYs [YLLs (males: 15.9%; females: 21.8%), YLDs (males: 25.0%; females: 50.0%), 
and DALYs (males: 16.2%; females: 22.4%)] were higher among men. In 2019, the 
highest DALY rate per 100,000 inhabitants was observed in individuals aged above 
50 years. The State of Maranhão presented the highest values of DALYs {1990: 
165.2 [95% uncertainty interval (UI) 96.2-264.4]; 2005: 43.8 [95% UI 30.3-62.4]; 
2019: 29.1 [95% UI 19.8-41.1]} per 100,000 inhabitants in the three years 
analyzed.
CONCLUSIONS: The burden of syphilis has increased in recent years. Men presented 
higher DALYs, although the incidence of the disease was higher in women. 
Syphilis affects a large number of people across all age groups, causing 
different degrees of disability and premature death (DALYs).

IMPORTANCE: The most appropriate therapy for older adults with multimorbidity 
may depend on life expectancy (ie, mortality risk), and several scores have been 
developed to predict 1-year mortality risk. However, often, these mortality risk 
scores have not been externally validated in large sample sizes, and a 
head-to-head comparison in a prospective contemporary cohort is lacking.
OBJECTIVE: To prospectively compare the performance of 6 scores in predicting 
the 1-year mortality risk in hospitalized older adults with multimorbidity.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This prognostic study analyzed data of 
participants in the OPERAM (Optimising Therapy to Prevent Avoidable Hospital 
Admissions in Multimorbid Older People) trial, which was conducted between 
December 1, 2016, and October 31, 2018, in surgical and nonsurgical departments 
of 4 university-based hospitals in Louvain, Belgium; Utrecht, the Netherlands; 
Cork, Republic of Ireland; and Bern, Switzerland. Eligible participants in the 
OPERAM trial had multimorbidity (≥3 coexisting chronic diseases), were aged 70 
years or older, had polypharmacy (≥5 long-term medications), and were admitted 
to a participating ward. Data were analyzed from April 1 to September 30, 2020.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The outcome of interest was any-cause death 
occurring in the first year of inclusion in the OPERAM trial. Overall 
performance, discrimination, and calibration of the following 6 scores were 
assessed: Burden of Illness Score for Elderly Persons, CARING (Cancer, 
Admissions ≥2, Residence in a nursing home, Intensive care unit admit with 
multiorgan failure, ≥2 Noncancer hospice guidelines) Criteria, Charlson 
Comorbidity Index, Gagné Index, Levine Index, and Walter Index. These scores 
were assessed using the following measures: Brier score (0 indicates perfect 
overall performance and 0.25 indicates a noninformative model); C-statistic and 
95% CI; Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test and calibration plots; and 
sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values.
RESULTS: The 1879 patients in the study had a median (IQR) age of 79 (74-84) 
years and 835 were women (44.4%). The median (IQR) number of chronic diseases 
was 11 (8-16). Within 1 year, 375 participants (20.0%) died. Brier scores ranged 
from 0.16 (Gagné Index) to 0.24 (Burden of Illness Score for Elderly Persons). 
C-statistic values ranged from 0.62 (95% CI, 0.59-0.65) for Charlson Comorbidity 
Index to 0.69 (95% CI, 0.66-0.72) for the Walter Index. Calibration was good for 
the Gagné Index and moderate for other mortality risk scores.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Results of this prognostic study suggest that all 6 
of the 1-year mortality risk scores examined had moderate prognostic 
performance, discriminatory power, and calibration in a large cohort of 
hospitalized older adults with multimorbidity. Overall, none of these mortality 
risk scores outperformed the others, and thus none could be recommended for use 
in daily clinical practice.

PURPOSE: Bariatric surgery is an efficacious intervention for substantial and 
sustained weight reduction in individuals with morbid obesity resulting in 
health improvements. However, the changes to a patient's health related quality 
of life (HRQoL) in the medium to longer term after bariatric surgery have not 
been adequately characterized. Our aim was to evaluate the change to patient 
HRQoL 5 years following bariatric surgery in an Australian government-funded 
hospital system and determine the significance of relationships between change 
in physical and mental assessment scores and HRQoL utility scores.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a longitudinal panel study of 81 adult 
patients who underwent primary bariatric surgery at an Australian tertiary 
government-funded hospital and completed multi-attribute utility (MAU), 
multi-attribute non-utility (MA), and disease-specific adjusted quality of life 
(AQoL) questionnaires before and after bariatric surgery.
RESULTS: At a mean (SD) 5.72 (1.07) years postbariatric surgery, participants 
demonstrated statistically significant improvements in mean AQoL-8D utility 
(0.135 (0.21); P < 0.0001), yielding a mean 3.2 (1.67) QALYs gained. Beck 
Depression Inventory-II scores improved (baseline mean 17.35 (9.57); 5-year mean 
14.7 (11.57); P = 0.037). Short Form-36 scores improved in the domains of 
physical functioning and role limitations due to physical health and general 
health. Change in depression scores and patient satisfaction with surgery were 
found to be significant predictors of follow up AQoL utility scores.
CONCLUSIONS: Bariatric surgery improves physical and psychological quality of 
life measures over 5 years. The improvement of patient QALYs provide insight to 
the potential cost utility of publicly funded bariatric surgery in the medium 
term.

OBJECTIVES: To consider trends and disparities in end-of-life health in the US.
METHODS: I use data from the National Health Interview Survey, linked to death 
records through 2015, for respondents who died at ages 65+ to compare the 
prevalence of three health outcomes in the last six years of life across time, 
sex, age, race, and educational attainment. Self-rated health (SRH) is available 
for respondents interviewed in years 1987-2014, while information on activities 
of daily living (ADL) and instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) is 
available for the period 1997-2014.
RESULTS: By the end of the study period, individuals reported two fewer months 
of fair/poor health at the end of life than those dying in earlier years. In 
contrast, time lived with at least one activity limitation at the end of life 
generally remained comparable. Compared to men, women on average reported an 
additional year of living with an IADL limitation before death, and an 
additional eight months with an ADL limitation. Despite sex differences in 
disability, both sexes reported similar periods of fair/poor SRH before death. 
Similarly, while individuals who lived to older ages experienced a longer 
disabled period before death than individuals who died at younger ages, all age 
groups were equally likely to report fair/poor SRH. Black adults and adults with 
less formal schooling also spent more time with an end-of-life disability. For 
men, these racial and socioeconomic disparities lessened as death approached. 
For women, inequalities persisted until death.
DISCUSSION: These findings suggest that despite increasing life expectancy, the 
period of poor health and disability prior to death has not recently been 
extended. Black women and women with less than a high school degree, require 
extended support at the end of life.

OBJECTIVE: To report the global, regional, and national burden of chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and its attributable risk factors between 
1990 and 2019, by age, sex, and sociodemographic index.
DESIGN: Systematic analysis.
DATA SOURCE: Global Burden of Disease Study 2019.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Data on the prevalence, deaths, and disability adjusted 
life years (DALYs) of COPD, and its attributable risk factors, were retrieved 
from the Global Burden of Disease 2019 project for 204 countries and 
territories, between 1990 and 2019. The counts and rates per 100 000 population, 
along with 95% uncertainty intervals, were presented for each estimate.
RESULTS: In 2019, 212.3 million prevalent cases of COPD were reported globally, 
with COPD accounting for 3.3 million deaths and 74.4 million DALYs. The global 
age standardised point prevalence, death, and DALY rates for COPD were 2638.2 
(95% uncertainty intervals 2492.2 to 2796.1), 42.5 (37.6 to 46.3), and 926.1 
(848.8 to 997.7) per 100 000 population, which were 8.7%, 41.7%, and 39.8% lower 
than in 1990, respectively. In 2019, Denmark (4299.5), Myanmar (3963.7), and 
Belgium (3927.7) had the highest age standardised point prevalence of COPD. 
Egypt (62.0%), Georgia (54.9%), and Nicaragua (51.6%) showed the largest 
increases in age standardised point prevalence across the study period. In 2019, 
Nepal (182.5) and Japan (7.4) had the highest and lowest age standardised death 
rates per 100 000, respectively, and Nepal (3318.4) and Barbados (177.7) had the 
highest and lowest age standardised DALY rates per 100 000, respectively. In 
men, the global DALY rate of COPD increased up to age 85-89 years and then 
decreased with advancing age, whereas for women the rate increased up to the 
oldest age group (≥95 years). Regionally, an overall reversed V shaped 
association was found between sociodemographic index and the age standardised 
DALY rate of COPD. Factors contributing most to the DALYs rates for COPD were 
smoking (46.0%), pollution from ambient particulate matter (20.7%), and 
occupational exposure to particulate matter, gases, and fumes (15.6%).
CONCLUSIONS: Despite the decreasing burden of COPD, this disease remains a major 
public health problem, especially in countries with a low sociodemographic 
index. Preventive programmes should focus on smoking cessation, improving air 
quality, and reducing occupational exposures to further reduce the burden of 
COPD.

OBJECTIVES: Stroke treatment with intravenous tissue-type plasminogen activator 
(tPA) is effective and efficient, but as its benefits are highly time dependent, 
it is essential to treat the patient promptly after symptom onset. This study 
evaluates the cost-effectiveness of a blood biomarker test to differentiate 
ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke to guide pre-hospital treatment with tPA in 
patients with suspected stroke, compared with standard hospital management. The 
standard care for patients suffering stroke consists mainly in diagnosis, 
treatment, hospitalization and monitoring.
METHODS: A Markov model was built with four health states according to the 
modified Rankin scale, in adult patients with suspected moderate to severe 
stroke (NIHSS 4-22) within 4.5 hours after symptom onset. A Spanish Health 
System perspective was used. The time horizon was 15 years. Quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs) and life-years gained (LYGs) were used as a measure of 
effectiveness. Short- and long-term direct health costs were included. Costs 
were expressed in Euros (2022). A discount rate of 3% was used. Probabilistic 
sensitivity analysis and several one-way sensitivity analyses were conducted.
RESULTS: The use of a blood-test biomarker compared with standard care was 
associated with more QALYs (4.87 vs. 4.77), more LYGs (7.18 vs. 7.07), and 
greater costs (12,807€ vs. 12,713€). The ICER was 881€/QALY. Probabilistic 
sensitivity analysis showed that the biomarker test was cost-effective in 82% of 
iterations using a threshold of 24,000€/QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: The use of a blood biomarker test to guide pre-hospital 
thrombolysis is cost-effective compared with standard hospital care in patients 
with ischemic stroke.

BACKGROUND: While several studies investigated the epidemiology and burden of 
stroke in the North Africa and Middle East region, no study has comprehensively 
evaluated the age-standardized attributable burden to all stroke subtypes and 
their risk factors yet.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study is to explore the regional distribution 
of the burden of stroke, including ischemic stroke, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and 
intracerebral hemorrhage, and the attributable burden to its risk factors in 
2019 among the 21 countries of North Africa and Middle East super-region.
METHODS: The data of the Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD) 2019 on stroke 
incidence, prevalence, death, disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), years of 
life lost (YLLs), years lived with disability (YLDs) rates, and attributed 
deaths, DALYs, YLLs, and YLDs to stroke risk factors were used for the present 
study.
RESULTS: The age-standardized deaths, DALYs, and YLLs rates were diminished 
statistically significant by 27.8, 32.0, and 35.1% from 1990 to 2019, 
respectively. Attributed deaths, DALYs, and YLLs to stroke risk factors, 
including high systolic blood pressure, high body-mass index, and high fasting 
plasma glucose shrank statistically significant by 24.9, 25.8, and 28.8%, 
respectively.
CONCLUSION: While the age-standardized stroke burden has reduced during these 
30 years, it is still a concerning issue due to its increased burden in all-age 
numbers. Well-developed primary prevention, timely diagnosis and management of 
the stroke and its risk factors might be appreciated for further decreasing the 
burden of stroke and its risk factors and reaching Sustainable Development Goal 
3.4 target for reducing premature mortality from non-communicable diseases.

BACKGROUND: This study compares the health gains, costs, and cost-effectiveness 
of hundreds of Australian and New Zealand (NZ) health interventions conducted 
with comparable methods in an online interactive league table designed to inform 
policy.
METHODS: A literature review was conducted to identify peer-reviewed evaluations 
(2010 to 2018) arising from the Australia Cost-Effectiveness research and NZ 
Burden of Disease Epidemiology, Equity and Cost-Effectiveness Programmes, or 
using similar methodology, with: health gains quantified as health-adjusted life 
years (HALYs); net health system costs and/or incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio; time horizon of at least 10 years; and 3% to 5% discount rates.
RESULTS: We identified 384 evaluations that met the inclusion criteria, covering 
14 intervention domains: alcohol; cancer; cannabis; communicable disease; 
cardiovascular disease; diabetes; diet; injury; mental illness; other 
non-communicable diseases; overweight and obesity; physical inactivity; salt; 
and tobacco. There were large variations in health gain across evaluations: 
33.9% gained less than 0.1 HALYs per 1000 people in the total population over 
the remainder of their lifespan, through to 13.0% gaining > 10 HALYs per 1000 
people. Over a third (38.8%) of evaluations were cost-saving.
CONCLUSIONS: League tables of comparably conducted evaluations illustrate the 
large health gain (and cost) variations per capita between interventions, in 
addition to cost-effectiveness. Further work can test the utility of this league 
table with policy-makers and researchers.

The aims of this study were (1) to develop a comprehensive risk-of-death and 
life expectancy (LE) model and (2) to provide data on the effects of multiple 
risk factors on LE. We used data for Canada from the Global Burden of Disease 
(GBD) Study. To create period life tables for males and females, we obtained 
age/sex-specific deaths rates for 270 diseases, population distributions for 51 
risk factors, and relative risk functions for all disease-exposure pairs. We 
computed LE gains from eliminating each factor, LE values for different levels 
of exposure to each factor, and LE gains from simultaneous reductions in 
multiple risk factors at various ages. If all risk factors were eliminated, LE 
in Canada would increase by 6.26 years for males and 5.05 for females. The 
greatest benefit would come from eliminating smoking in males (2.45 years) and 
high blood pressure in females (1.42 years). For most risk factors, their 
dose-response relationships with LE were non-linear and depended on the presence 
of other factors. In individuals with high levels of risk, eliminating or 
reducing exposure to multiple factors could improve LE by several years, even at 
a relatively advanced age.

Increasing life expectancy has led to a global rise in late-life diseases. 
Quality of Life (QOL) is important for healthy life expectancy. The active 
ageing framework serves as a guide for policymakers to design policies that 
enhance the QOL of older people. This study aims to determine the association 
between awareness of active ageing and QOL. The Malay version of the 26-item 
WHOQOL-BREF questionnaire was utilised along with the 14-item Active Ageing 
Awareness Questionnaire (AAAQ). A total of 532 participants had a mean (SD) age 
of 50.2 (5.9), were largely ethnic Malay (96.2%), female (52.8%), and comprised 
largely of low-income households (65.4%). The median (IQR) AAAQ score was 71.4 
(19.1). The hierarchical multiple regression analysis revealed significant 
positive association between AAAQ and the QOL domains of physical (β = 0.154, p 
< 0.001), psychological (β = 0.196, p < 0.001), social relationship (β = 0.175, 
p < 0.001), and environment (β = 0.145, p < 0.001) after adjusting for all 
covariates. Awareness of active ageing was found to have a positive effect on 
all domains of QOL among pre-elder employees, and thus, we recommend that 
policies to improve active ageing awareness should be implemented for healthy 
life expectancy in ageing populations.

Changes in articular surfaces can be associated with the aging process and as 
such may lead to quantitative and qualitative impairment of joint motion. This 
study is aiming to evaluate the age-related quality of the knee joint 
arthrokinematic motion using nonlinear parameters of the vibroarthrographic 
(VAG) signal. To analyse the age-related quality of the patellofemoral joint 
(PFJ), motion vibroarthrography was used. The data that were subject to analysis 
represent 220 participants divided into five age groups. The VAG signals were 
acquired during flexion/extension knee motion and described with the following 
nonlinear parameters: recurrence rate (RR) and multi-scale entropy (MSE). RR and 
MSE decrease almost in a linear way with age (main effects of group p<0.001; 
means (SD): RR=0.101(0.057)−0.020(0.017); and MSE=20.9(8.56)−13.6(6.24)). The RR 
post-hoc analysis showed that there were statistically significant differences 
(p<0.01) in all comparisons with the exception of the 5th−6th life decade. For 
MSE, statistically significant differences (p<0.01) occurred for: 3rd−7th, 
4th−7th, 5th−7th and 6th life decades. Our results imply that degenerative 
age-related changes are associated with lower repeatability, greater 
heterogeneity in state space dynamics, and greater regularity in the time domain 
of VAG signal. In comparison with linear VAG measures, our results provide 
additional information about the nature of changes of the vibration dynamics of 
PFJ motion with age.
