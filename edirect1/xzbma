quality of life (QOL) for the patient, or a change from "hospital-centered 
medical care" to "community-oriented medical care" in correlation with nursing 
care and welfare.
CURRENT SITUATION AND PROBLEMS: (1)  Necessity for a paradigm shift to 
"cure-and-support seeking medical care" In addition to the process of aging with 
functional deterioration of multiple organs, the elderly often suffer from 
systemically disordering diseases, such as lifestyle-related diseases, as well 
as geriatric syndrome and daily activity dysfunction; therefore, integrated and 
comprehensive medical care is required. In addition, with regard to diseases in 
the elderly, not only their acute stage, but also their chronic and intermediate 
stages must be emphasized in their treatment. Aiming to achieve a complete cure 
of disease by exploring the cause and implementing radical treatment, the 
conventional medical care model is difficult to apply to the medical care of the 
elderly; medical care suitable for the elderly is required. (2)  Spread of 
home-based care and the necessity for human resources development Many elderly 
people want to continue to live in their house and their community where they 
have been living for a long time, even with disease. There are increasing needs 
for QOL-emphasizing home-based care for patients in the intermediate stage after 
completion of acute stage treatment, or for end-of-life care. Hence, there is a 
demand for a shift to "community-oriented medical care" for providing 
comprehensive care supported with medical and nursing resources available in the 
community. As the percentage of the elderly population (aged ≥65 years) and the 
availability of medical care resources vary considerably among different 
regions, it is important that specialists in the fields of public health, 
medical care, nursing care, and welfare work on establishing a collaborative 
system suitable for the local characteristics of each region by making the best 
use of their own specialties. (3)  Necessity for establishing a department of 
gerontology or geriatric medicine at each medical school In line with the 
increasing number of elderly people, it is necessary to upgrade the systems for 
educating and nurturing physicians engaged in healthcare and nursing care for 
the elderly. It is also necessary to develop the organic cooperation with other 
medical and nursing care professionals, such as registered nurses and care 
workers. At present, just approximately 30% of medical schools in Japan have a 
department specializing in medical care for the elderly and relevant medical 
education; there is an urgent need to improve the situation, as the majority of 
universities do not provide any such education. (4)  Necessity for establishing 
a medical center for promoting medical care provider collaboration, 
multidisciplinary training and a means to increase public awareness In the 
medical care for the elderly, comprehensive care must be provided from the 
viewpoints of both healthcare and nursing care; to improve the quality of such 
care services, multidisciplinary collaboration and team-based medicine are 
indispensable. Therefore, physicians, nurses, therapists, pharmacists, 
dieticians, care managers, and other health care professionals who have thorough 
knowledge about medical care for the elderly are of utmost necessity. In 
reality, however, the collaboration of these health care professionals is 
unsatisfactory, and the degree of understanding of team-based medicine by each 
medical professional is low. Therefore, as in the case of the establishment of 
cancer centers within individual regions to promote medical care for cancer, 
there is a demand to nurture professionals engaged in medical care for the 
elderly, and to establish a core facility for the promotion of multidisciplinary 
collaboration and team-based medicine for each region. (5)  Do the people 
understand the paradigm shift? Currently, not only healthcare professionals, but 
also many citizens seek "cure-seeking medical care" aiming at a restoration of 
organ function; however, surveys of the elderly often show that they want to 
restore independent daily activity, rather than to achieve a "cure." In 
contrast, in the actual medical care setting, contradictory situations prevail 
in which the public awareness of the shift to "cure-and-support seeking medical 
care" is unsatisfactory, including the fact that the majority of recipients of 
tertiary emergency care are elderly patients.
CONTENTS OF THE PROPOSAL: The Science Council of Japan has the task to propose 
future visions for the Japanese aging society not only from the viewpoint of the 
health of each individual, but also from a broader perspective, taking into 
account the relationship between humans and society. Various issues related to 
general population aging are posing serious problems, which require prompt 
resolution. Although we made a number of proposals at the 21st Subcommittee for 
Aging, the situation has not changed satisfactorily. Accordingly, the present 
proposals on specific solutions were designed. (1)  In a super-aged society, a 
paradigm shift to "cure-and-support seeking medical care" should be implemented 
A super-aged society will consist of an unprecedented demographic structure in 
which the percentage of only those people aged ≥75 years will increase in the 
entire population. Therefore, there is an urgent need to prepare for increasing 
populations of persons in need of long-term care and those who are likely to 
become in need of long-term care. Given the consideration that "patients are not 
merely sick persons, but rather living persons," a paradigm shift from 
conventional "cure-seeking medical care" to "cure and support-seeking medical 
care" must be implemented. (2)  Facilitate a paradigm shift to 
community-oriented medical care, and promote the activity of female physicians 
in the medical care for the elderly A paradigm shift should be promptly 
facilitated by reorganizing hospital functions and establishing a community 
comprehensive care system for home-based care to promote the participation of 
the elderly by themselves in care-supporting society. To further promote the 
collaboration of medical care and welfare, not only persons in charge of actual 
regional settings, but also university schools of medicine and regional core 
medical institutions experienced in medical care for the elderly should take the 
initiative to promote home-based care and facilitate a paradigm shift to 
community-oriented medical care. In addition, programs should also be developed 
to re-educate female physicians who became housewives in order to nurture them 
to become facilitators of geriatric medicine. (3)  Physicians who are required 
at local medical facilities must be nurtured through the establishment of a 
department of gerontology or geriatric medicine at each medical school To 
facilitate efficient medical care services, medical education and research, and 
human resources development in support of expected paradigm shifts, it is 
considered that a department of gerontology or geriatric medicine should be 
established at each medical school. Furthermore, it is necessary to allocate 
dedicated teachers of medical care for the elderly to all medical schools, as 
well as to upgrade practice-participatory drills and to collaborate with a broad 
range of entities, including local medical institutions, and welfare and nursing 
care facilities. Efforts must be made to nurture locally wanted physicians 
through specific efforts concerning team-based medicine. (4)  Promote the 
establishment of centers for geriatrics and gerontology (provisional name) for 
medical care collaboration, multidisciplinary training, and a means to increase 
public awareness To promote the uniform accessibility of expertise on efficient 
medical care that is best suited for a super-aged society, it is necessary to 
build a post-graduation educational system under the initiatives of the Japan 
Geriatrics Society and the National Center for Geriatrics and Gerontology across 
the nation in cooperation with regional medical schools and the Japan Medical 
Association. Furthermore, at least one hospital serving as a center for 
geriatrics and gerontology should be established in each regional block 
(Hokkaido, Tohoku, Koshinetsu, Hokuriku/Tokai, Kinki, Chushikoku and 
Kyushu/Okinawa) by making the best use of existing hospitals. By establishing 
these centers, uniform accessibility for the quality of medical care for the 
elderly in each region is expected. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED).

PURPOSE: Aim of this study was to measure the outcome of hamstring transfer for 
quadriceps reconstruction after soft tissue sarcoma resection and to identify 
risk factors influencing postoperative results.
METHODS: 43 patients underwent hamstring transfer after sarcoma resection. 
Medical records were reviewed for surgical technique and complications. Physical 
examination included assessment of range of motion and muscle strength as well 
as plantar pressure distribution by computerized dynamometer and podometry, 
respectively. Additionally, patients' satisfaction, quality of life and 
karnofsky index were assessed.
RESULTS: Sole biceps transfer was performed in 31 (74%) and combined 
biceps/semitendinosus or gracilis transfer in 12 patients (26%). In 91%of cases 
3/4 or more of the quadriceps muscle had to be removed. Postoperative 
complications occurred in 16 patients (37%). 17 patients (40%) were available 
for physical examination. Mean follow-up was 61 months (22-107). Average knee 
flexion was 74° (35-110°). All patients had full knee extension. Average 
extension force was 44% (19-79%) and flexion-force 74% (55-100%) of the 
unaffected leg. Mean plantar pressure distribution was 119% (44-200%) on the 
forefoot and 107% (60-169%) on the heel. Average patient satisfaction score was 
16 (9-25), quality of life assessment was 78 (54-92) and Karnofsky Index was 82% 
(70-90%). Besides patient's age and the extent of resection, the surgical 
technique had statistically significant influence on functional outcome and 
postoperative complications (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Hamstring transfer is feasible for quadriceps reconstruction after 
massive tumor resection from the thigh. In contrast to biceps alone, combined 
semitendinosus or gracilis transfer revealed comparable outcome but higher 
complication rates.

BACKGROUND: Primary sarcoma of the prostate is extremely rare and accounts for 
0.1% of all prostate cancers. This type of cancer is associated with poor 
prognosis due to aggressive biological behavior. The World Health Organization 
histologically classified prostate sarcomas as stromal tumor of unknown 
malignant potential (STUMP) and stromal sarcoma.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A 39-year-old patient presented with lower urinary tract 
symptoms over the last few months. On digital rectal examination, the right lobe 
of the prostate was diffusely hard on palpation. Prostate-specific antigen was 
0.5 ng/ml. A biopsy specimen was obtained with the guidance of transrectal 
ultrasonography. Immunohistochemical examination revealed positive staining for 
vimentin, actin, and desmin.
RESULTS: (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron-emission tomography/computed 
tomography scans obtained for staging purposes with the diagnosis of primary 
spindle cell carcinoma of the prostate revealed widespread lung and liver 
metastases. A doxorubicin-based systemic chemotherapy (CTx) was initiated.
CONCLUSION: Spindle sarcomas of the prostate have quite aggressive nature and 
they have high potential to metastase. Average life expectancy is <1 year and 
the prognosis is poor. CTx and radiation therapy can't yield curative effects 
due to poor differentiation.

BACKGROUND: DNA methylation was suggested as the promising biomarker for lung 
cancer diagnosis. However, it is a great challenge to search for the optimal 
combination of methylation biomarkers to obtain maximum diagnostic performance.
RESULTS: In this study, we developed a panel of DNA methylation biomarkers and 
validated their diagnostic efficiency for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in 
a large Chinese Han NSCLC retrospective cohort. Three high-throughput DNA 
methylation microarray datasets (458 samples) were collected in the discovery 
stage. After normalization, batch effect elimination and integration, 
significantly differentially methylated genes and the best combination of the 
biomarkers were determined by the leave-one-out SVM (support vector machine) 
feature selection procedure. Then, candidate promoters were examined by the 
methylation status determined single nucleotide primer extension technique 
(MSD-SNuPET) in an independent set of 150 pairwise NSCLC/normal tissues. Four 
statistical models with fivefold cross-validation were used to evaluate the 
performance of the discriminatory algorithms. The sensitivity, specificity and 
accuracy were 86.3%, 95.7% and 91%, respectively, in Bayes tree model. The 
logistic regression model incorporated five gene methylation signatures at 
AGTR1, GALR1, SLC5A8, ZMYND10 and NTSR1, adjusted for age, sex and smoking, 
showed robust performances in which the sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and 
area under the curve (AUC) were 78%, 97%, 87%, and 0.91, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: In summary, a high-throughput DNA methylation microarray dataset 
followed by batch effect elimination can be a good strategy to discover optimal 
DNA methylation diagnostic panels. Methylation profiles of AGTR1, GALR1, SLC5A8, 
ZMYND10 and NTSR1, could be an effective methylation-based assay for NSCLC 
diagnosis.

BACKGROUND: The Global Burden of Disease Study 2010 (GBD 2010), estimated that a 
substantial proportion of the world's disease burden came from mental, 
neurological and substance use disorders. In this paper, we used GBD 2010 data 
to investigate time, year, region and age specific trends in burden due to 
mental, neurological and substance use disorders.
METHOD: For each disorder, prevalence data were assembled from systematic 
literature reviews. DisMod-MR, a Bayesian meta-regression tool, was used to 
model prevalence by country, region, age, sex and year. Prevalence data were 
combined with disability weights derived from survey data to estimate years 
lived with disability (YLDs). Years lost to premature mortality (YLLs) were 
estimated by multiplying deaths occurring as a result of a given disorder by the 
reference standard life expectancy at the age death occurred. 
Disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) were computed as the sum of YLDs and 
YLLs.
RESULTS: In 2010, mental, neurological and substance use disorders accounted for 
10.4% of global DALYs, 2.3% of global YLLs and, 28.5% of global YLDs, making 
them the leading cause of YLDs. Mental disorders accounted for the largest 
proportion of DALYs (56.7%), followed by neurological disorders (28.6%) and 
substance use disorders (14.7%). DALYs peaked in early adulthood for mental and 
substance use disorders but were more consistent across age for neurological 
disorders. Females accounted for more DALYs in all mental and neurological 
disorders, except for mental disorders occurring in childhood, schizophrenia, 
substance use disorders, Parkinson's disease and epilepsy where males accounted 
for more DALYs. Overall DALYs were highest in Eastern Europe/Central Asia and 
lowest in East Asia/the Pacific.
CONCLUSION: Mental, neurological and substance use disorders contribute to a 
significant proportion of disease burden. Health systems can respond by 
implementing established, cost effective interventions, or by supporting the 
research necessary to develop better prevention and treatment options.

Impact of depression on quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE) directly as well 
as indirectly through suicide.

Nursing, Columbia University, 617 West 168th Street, New York, NY, 10032, USA, 
hj2198@columbia.edu.

PURPOSE: To estimate quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE) loss among US 
adults due to depression and QALE losses associated with the increased risk of 
suicide attributable to depression.
METHOD: We ascertained depressive symptoms using the eight-item Patient Health 
Questionnaire (PHQ-8) on the 2006, 2008, and 2010 Behavioral Risk Factor 
Surveillance System (BRFSS) surveys. We estimated health-related quality of life 
(HRQOL) scores from BRFSS data (n = 276,442) and constructed life tables from US 
Compressed Mortality Files to calculate QALE by depression status. QALE loss due 
to depression is the difference in QALE between depressed and non-depressed 
adults. QALE loss associated with suicide deaths is the difference between QALE 
from only those deaths that did not have suicide recorded on the death 
certificate and QALE from all deaths including those with a suicide recorded on 
the death certificate.
RESULTS: At age 18, QALE was 28.0 more years for depressed adults and 56.8 more 
years for non-depressed adults, a 28.9-year QALE loss due to depression. For 
depressed adults, only 0.41 years of QALE loss resulted from deaths by suicide, 
and only 0.26 years of this loss could be attributed to depression.
CONCLUSION: Depression symptoms lead to a significant burden of disease from 
both mortality and morbidity as assessed by QALE loss. The 28.9-year QALE loss 
at age 18 associated with depression markedly exceeds estimates reported 
elsewhere for stroke (12.4-year loss), heart disease (10.3-year loss), diabetes 
mellitus (11.1-year loss), hypertension (6.3-year loss), asthma (7.0-year loss), 
smoking (11.0-year loss), and physical inactivity (8.0-year loss).

BACKGROUND: Based on results of the PLATO (Platelet Inhibition and Patient 
Outcomes) trial comparing ticagrelor with clopidogrel therapy, the U.S. Food and 
Drug Administration approved ticagrelor in 2011 for reducing thrombotic 
cardiovascular events in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) with the 
proviso that it be taken with low-dose aspirin.
OBJECTIVES: This study sought to assess the cost and cost effectiveness of 
ticagrelor therapy relative to clopidogrel in treating ACS patients from the 
perspective of the U.S. health care system.
METHODS: We estimated within-trial resource use and costs using U.S. low-dose 
aspirin patients in PLATO (n = 547). Quality-adjusted life expectancy was 
estimated using the total PLATO population (n = 18,624), combined with baseline 
risk and long-term survival data from an external ACS patient cohort. Study 
drugs were valued at current costs. Cost effectiveness was assessed, as was the 
sensitivity of results to sampling and methodological uncertainties.
RESULTS: One year of ticagrelor therapy, relative to that of generic 
clopidogrel, cost $29,665/quality-adjusted life-year gained, with 99% of 
bootstrap estimates falling under a $100,000 willingness-to-pay threshold. 
Results were robust to extensive sensitivity analyses, including variations in 
clopidogrel cost, exclusion of costs in extended years of life, and a 
recalibrated estimate of survival reflecting a lower underlying mortality risk 
in the United States.
CONCLUSIONS: For PLATO-eligible ACS patients, a U.S. perspective comparison of 
the current standard of dual antiplatelet therapy of aspirin with clopidogrel 
versus aspirin plus ticagrelor showed that the ticagrelor regimen increased life 
expectancy at an incremental cost well within accepted benchmarks of good value 
for money. (A Comparison of Ticagrelor [AZD6140] and Clopidogrel in Patients 
With Acute Coronary Syndrome [PLATO]; NCT00391872).

AIMS: To examine the short- and long-term cost-effectiveness of intensive 
multifactorial treatment compared with routine care among people with 
screen-detected Type 2 diabetes.
METHODS: Cost-utility analysis in ADDITION-UK, a cluster-randomized controlled 
trial of early intensive treatment in people with screen-detected diabetes in 69 
UK general practices. Unit treatment costs and utility decrement data were taken 
from published literature. Accumulated costs and quality-adjusted life years 
(QALYs) were calculated using ADDITION-UK data from 1 to 5 years (short-term 
analysis, n = 1024); trial data were extrapolated to 30 years using the UKPDS 
outcomes model (version 1.3) (long-term analysis; n = 999). All costs were 
transformed to the UK 2009/10 price level.
RESULTS: Adjusted incremental costs to the NHS were £285, £935, £1190 and £1745 
over a 1-, 5-, 10- and 30-year time horizon, respectively (discounted at 3.5%). 
Adjusted incremental QALYs were 0.0000, - 0.0040, 0.0140 and 0.0465 over the 
same time horizons. Point estimate incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) 
suggested that the intervention was not cost-effective although the ratio 
improved over time: the ICER over 10 years was £82,250, falling to £37,500 over 
30 years. The ICER fell below £30 000 only when the intervention cost was below 
£631 per patient: we estimated the cost at £981.
CONCLUSION: Given conventional thresholds of cost-effectiveness, the intensive 
treatment delivered in ADDITION was not cost-effective compared with routine 
care for individuals with screen-detected diabetes in the UK. The intervention 
may be cost-effective if it can be delivered at reduced cost.

Australian Aboriginal people are some of the most researched people on earth, 
yet their life expectancy and other well-being indices lag significantly behind 
non-Aboriginal Australians. The reach of evidence-based practice (EBP) in social 
interventions has not yet informed Aboriginal policy even though it is based on 
clinical expertise and systematic research. This is due to criticism of the 
processes of EBP, most commonly its supposed limitations and misperceptions, 
which are easily refuted. EBP continues to be a tool that is needed to inform 
practice across all disciplines of human service, and needs to be the core value 
of any intervention with indigenous peoples.

BACKGROUND: Most patients with hip fractures are characterised by older age (>70 
years), frailty, and functional deterioration, and their long-term outcomes are 
poor with increased costs. We compared the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness 
of giving these patients comprehensive geriatric care in a dedicated geriatric 
ward versus the usual orthopaedic care.
METHODS: We did a prospective, single-centre, randomised, parallel-group, 
controlled trial. Between April 18, 2008, and Dec 30, 2010, we randomly assigned 
home-dwelling patients with hip-fractures aged 70 years or older who were able 
to walk 10 m before their fracture, to either comprehensive geriatric care or 
orthopaedic care in the emergency department, to achieve the required sample of 
400 patients. Randomisation was achieved via a web-based, computer-generated, 
block method with unknown block sizes. The primary outcome, analysed by 
intention to treat, was mobility measured with the Short Physical Performance 
Battery (SPPB) 4 months after surgery for the fracture. The type of treatment 
was not concealed from the patients or staff delivering the care, and assessors 
were only partly masked to the treatment during follow-up. This trial is 
registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00667914.
FINDINGS: We assessed 1077 patients for eligibility, and excluded 680, mainly 
for not meeting the inclusion criteria such as living in a nursing home or being 
aged less than 70 years. Of the remaining patients, we randomly assigned 198 to 
comprehensive geriatric care and 199 to orthopaedic care. At 4 months, 174 
patients remained in the comprehensive geriatric care group and 170 in the 
orthopaedic care group; the main reason for dropout was death. Mean SPPB scores 
at 4 months were 5·12 (SE 0·20) for comprehensive geriatric care and 4·38 (SE 
0·20) for orthopaedic care (between-group difference 0·74, 95% CI 0·18-1·30, 
p=0·010).
INTERPRETATION: Immediate admission of patients aged 70 years or more with a hip 
fracture to comprehensive geriatric care in a dedicated ward improved mobility 
at 4 months, compared with the usual orthopaedic care. The results suggest that 
the treatment of older patients with hip fractures should be organised as 
orthogeriatric care.

BACKGROUND: Increased life expectancy and younger patients' desire to avoid 
lifelong anticoagulation requires a better understanding of bioprosthetic valve 
failure. This study evaluates risk factors associated with explantation for 
structural valve deterioration (SVD) in a long-term series of Carpentier-Edwards 
PERIMOUNT aortic valves (AV).
METHODS: From June 1982 to January 2011, 12,569 patients underwent AV 
replacement with Edwards Lifesciences Carpentier-Edwards PERIMOUNT stented 
bovine pericardial prostheses, models 2700PM (n = 310) or 2700 (n = 12,259). 
Mean age was 71 ± 11 years (range, 18 to 98 years). 93% had native AV disease, 
48% underwent concomitant coronary artery bypass grafting, and 26% had 
additional valve surgery. There were 81,706 patient-years of systematic 
follow-up data available for analysis. Demographics, intraoperative variables, 
and 27,386 echocardiographic records were used to identify risks for explant for 
SVD and assess longitudinal changes in transprosthesis gradients using 
time-varying covariable analyses.
RESULTS: Three hundred fifty-four explants were performed, with 41% related to 
endocarditis and 44% to SVD. Actuarial estimates of explant for SVD at 10 and 20 
years were 1.9% and 15% overall, respectively, and in patients younger than 60 
years, 5.6% and 46%, respectively. Younger age (p < 0.0001), lipid-lowering 
drugs (p = 0.002), prosthesis-patient mismatch (p = 0.001), and higher 
postoperative peak and mean AV gradients were associated with explant for SVD (p 
< 0.0001). The effect of gradient on SVD was greatest in patients younger than 
60 years.
CONCLUSIONS: Durability of the Carpentier-Edwards PERIMOUNT aortic valve is 
excellent even in younger patients. Explant for SVD is related to gradient at 
implantation, especially in younger patients. Strategies to reduce early 
postoperative AV gradients, such as root enlargement or more efficient 
prostheses, should be considered.

Atrial fibrillation is the most common form of cardiac arrhythmia, occurring in 
1-2 % of the population and due to an increased life expectancy the prevalence 
will increase further. Pharmacological treatment of atrial fibrillation is an 
important component of basic initial therapeutic options for patients with 
atrial fibrillation. Independent of an individually adjusted prevention of 
thromboembolism, rate and rhythm management can also be carried out. While rate 
control mainly applies to all patients, rhythm control is only indicated in 
patients who remain clinically symptomatic despite sufficient rate control. 
Profound knowledge about antiarrhythmic drugs including specific interactions is 
necessary due to the variable individual effects and sometimes severe side 
effects.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a multiorgan inflammatory disorder affecting 
approximately 1% of the population that leads to progressive joint destruction 
and disability. Patients with RA exhibit a high risk of cardiovascular disease, 
which results in premature morbidity and mortality and reduced life expectancy, 
when compared with the general population. Among various guises of myocardial 
involvement, heart failure (HF) has been recently recognized as an important 
contributory factor to the excess cardiovascular mortality associated with RA. 
HF in RA typically presents with occult clinical symptomatology and is mainly 
associated with structural and functional left ventricular abnormalities leading 
to diastolic dysfunction, while systolic myocardial performance remains well 
preserved. As isolated diastolic dysfunction is a predictor of high mortality, 
the evaluation of patients in early asymptomatic stages, when treatment 
targeting the heart is more likely to be effective, is of great importance. 
Although patient history and physical examination remain the cornerstones of HF 
evaluation, noninvasive imaging of cardiac chambers, coronary arteries, and 
great vessels may be necessary. Echocardiography, nuclear techniques, and 
invasive coronary angiography are already established in the routine assessment 
of HF; however, many aspects of HF pathophysiology in RA remain obscure, due to 
the limitations of currently used techniques. The capability of cardiovascular 
magnetic resonance (CMR) to capture early tissue changes allows timely detection 
of pathophysiologic phenomena of HF in RA, such as myocardial inflammation and 
myocardial perfusion defects, due to either macrovascular (coronary artery 
disease) or microvascular (vasculitis) disease. Therefore, CMR may be a useful 
tool for early, accurate diagnosis and research in patients with RA.

How Well Do the Generic Multi-attribute Utility Instruments Incorporate Patient 
and Public Views Into Their Descriptive Systems?

Multi-attribute utility instruments (MAUIs) are increasingly being used to 
generate utility data, which can be used to calculate quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs). These QALY data can then be incorporated into a cost-utility 
analysis as part of an economic evaluation, to inform health care resource 
allocation decisions. Many health care decision-making bodies around the world, 
such as the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, require the use 
of generic MAUIs. Recently, there has been a call for greater input of patients 
into the development of patient-reported outcome measures, and this is now 
actively encouraged. By incorporating the views of patients, greater validity of 
an instrument is expected and it is more likely that patients will be able to 
self-complete the instrument, which is the ideal when obtaining information 
about a patient's health-related quality of life. This paper examines the stages 
of MAUI development and the scope for patient and/or public involvement at each 
stage. The paper then reviews how much the main generic MAUIs have incorporated 
the views of patients/the public into the development of their descriptive 
systems at each of these stages, and the implications of this. The review finds 
that the majority of MAUIs had very little input from patients/the public. 
Instead, existing literature and/or the views of experts were used. If we wish 
to incorporate patient/public views into future development of MAUIs, 
qualitative methods are recommended.

Osteoporosis is a chronic disease, carrying an elevated risk of fractures, 
morbidity, and death. Long-term treatment may be required, but the long-term 
risks with osteoporosis drugs remain incompletely understood. The competing risk 
of death may be a barrier to treating the oldest, yet this may not be rational 
if the risk of death is reduced by treatment. It is difficult to devise 
goal-directed long-term strategies for managing osteoporosis without firm 
information about residual life expectancy in treated patients. We conducted an 
observational study in Danish national registries tracking prescriptions for 
osteoporosis drugs, comorbid conditions, and deaths. We included 58,637 patients 
and 225,084 age- and sex-matched control subjects. Information on deaths until 
the end of 2013 was retrieved, providing a follow-up period of 10 to 17 years. 
In men younger than 80 years and women younger than 60 years, the relative risk 
of dying declined from being strongly increased in the first year to a stable 
but elevated level in subsequent years. In women older than 65 to 70 years, 
there was only a small elevation in risk in the first year of treatment followed 
by lower than background population mortality. The residual life expectancy of a 
50-year-old man beginning osteoporosis treatment was estimated to be 18.2 years 
and that of a 75-year-old man was 7.5 years. Estimates in women were 26.4 years 
and 13.5 years, respectively. This study shows an excess mortality in men and in 
women younger than 70 years who are treated for osteoporosis compared with the 
background population. This excess risk is more pronounced in the first few 
years on treatment. The average life expectancy of osteoporosis patients is in 
excess of 15 years in women younger than 75 years and in men younger than 60 
years, highlighting the importance of developing tools for long-term management.

Statin use in cancer patients with brain metastases: a missed communication 
opportunity at the end of life.

PURPOSE: Preventive care, referring to medical interventions with anticipated 
long-term benefits, is often inappropriately continued near the end of life. We 
examined the use of statin medications in patients with brain metastases 
receiving whole brain radiation therapy to determine the effect of short life 
expectancy and regular interaction with oncology providers on statin 
discontinuation. We propose reasons for the unnecessary continuation of 
preventive care and suggest that it is a frequently missed communication 
opportunity to discuss prognosis in a concrete manner.
METHODS: This is a retrospective study examining statin use in patients 
receiving whole brain radiotherapy for brain metastases. A total of 206 patients 
at two cancer centers were studied, and information on statin use and clinical 
characteristics was obtained from review of the medical record.
RESULTS: Of the 206 patients, 53 (26 %) were on a statin at their initial 
radiation oncology consultation. Of these patients, 13 (25 %) had their statin 
discontinued by the time of their last follow-up visit, but 40 patients (75 %) 
were continued on their statin despite their limited life expectancy and low 
likelihood of benefit.
CONCLUSIONS: The majority of patients who were on statins prior to starting 
palliative whole brain radiation therapy remained on a statin after completing 
treatment despite an estimated survival of months and regular visits with an 
oncologist. This represents a missed opportunity for doctors and patients to 
discuss the appropriateness of continuing preventive care as part of an 
important conversation about prognosis.

Just healthcare? The moral failure of single-tier basic healthcare.

Meadowcroft J(1).

Author information:
(1)Kings College London, London, UK john.meadowcroft@kcl.ac.uk.

This article sets out the moral failure of single-tier basic healthcare. 
Single-tier basic healthcare has been advocated on the grounds that the 
provision of healthcare should be divorced from ability to pay and unequal 
access to basic healthcare is morally intolerable. However, single-tier basic 
healthcare encounters a host of catastrophic moral failings. Given the fact of 
human pluralism it is impossible to objectively define "basic" healthcare. 
Attempts to provide single-tier healthcare therefore become political processes 
in which interest groups compete for control of scarce resources with the most 
privileged possessing an inherent advantage. The focus on outputs in arguments 
for single-tier provision neglects the question of justice between individuals 
when some people provide resources for others without reciprocal benefits. The 
principle that only healthcare that can be provided to everyone should be 
provided at all leads to a leveling-down problem in which advocates of 
single-tier provision must prefer a situation where some individuals are made 
worse-off without any individual being made better-off compared to plausible 
multi-tier alternatives. Contemporary single-tier systems require the exclusion 
of noncitizens, meaning that their universalism is a myth. In the light of these 
pathologies, it is judged that multi-tier healthcare is morally required.

The aim of cancer screening is to detect asymptomatic cancers whose treatment 
will result in extension of life, relative to length of life absent screening. 
Unfortunately, cancer screening also results in overdiagnosis, the detection of 
cancers that, in the absence of screening, would not present symptomatically 
during one's lifetime. Thus, their detection and subsequent treatment is 
unnecessary and detrimental. This definition of overdiagnosis, while succinct, 
does not capture the ways it can occur, and our interactions with patients, 
advocates, researchers, clinicians, and journalists have led us to believe that 
the concept of overdiagnosis is difficult to explain and, for some, difficult to 
accept. We propose a dichotomy, the "tumor-patient" classification, to aid in 
understanding overdiagnosis. The tumor category includes asymptomatic malignant 
disease that would regress spontaneously if left alone, as well as asymptomatic 
malignant disease that stagnates or progresses too slowly to be life threatening 
in even the longest of lifetimes. The patient category includes asymptomatic 
malignant disease that would progress quickly enough to be life threatening 
during a lifetime of typical length, but lacks clinical relevance because death 
due to another cause intercedes prior to what would have been the date of 
symptomatic diagnosis had screening not occurred. Cancer screening of most 
organs is likely to result in overdiagnosis of both types. However, the ratio of 
tumor- to patient-driven overdiagnosis almost certainly varies, and may vary 
drastically, by organ, screening modality, patient characteristics, and other 
factors.

Prevention of pelvic radiation disease.

Sciences, S.Orsola-Malpighi Hospital, University of Bologna, 40136 Bologna,

Pelvic cancers are among the most frequently diagnosed cancers worldwide. 
Treatment of patients requires a multidisciplinary approach that frequently 
includes radiotherapy. Gastrointestinal (GI) radiation-induced toxicity is a 
major complication and the transient or long-term problems, ranging from mild to 
very severe, arising in non-cancerous tissues resulting from radiation treatment 
to a tumor of pelvic origin, are actually called as pelvic radiation disease. 
The incidence of pelvic radiation disease changes according to the radiation 
technique, the length of follow up, the assessment method, the type and stage of 
cancer and several other variables. Notably, even with the most recent radiation 
techniques, i.e., intensity-modulated radiotherapy, the incidence of 
radiation-induced GI side effects is overall reduced but still not negligible. 
In addition, radiation-induced GI side effects can develop even after several 
decades; therefore, the improvement of patient life expectancy will unavoidably 
increase the risk of developing radiation-induced complications. Once developed, 
the management of pelvic radiation disease may be challenging. Therefore, the 
prevention of radiation-induced toxicity represents a reasonable way to avoid a 
dramatic drop of the quality of life of these patients. In the current 
manuscript we provide an updated and practical review on the best available
