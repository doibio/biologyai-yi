The unprecedented rise in life expectancy observed in the last decades is 
leading to a global increase in the ageing population, and age-associated 
diseases became an increasing societal, economic, and medical burden. This has 
boosted major efforts in the scientific and medical research communities to 
develop and improve therapies to delay ageing and age-associated functional 
decline and diseases, and to expand health span. The establishment of induced 
pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) by reprogramming human somatic cells has 
revolutionised the modelling and understanding of human diseases. iPSCs have a 
major advantage relative to other human pluripotent stem cells as their 
obtention does not require the destruction of embryos like embryonic stem cells 
do, and do not have a limited proliferation or differentiation potential as 
adult stem cells. Besides, iPSCs can be generated from somatic cells from 
healthy individuals or patients, which makes iPSC technology a promising 
approach to model and decipher the mechanisms underlying the ageing process and 
age-associated diseases, study drug effects, and develop new therapeutic 
approaches. This review discusses the advances made in the last decade using 
iPSC technology to study the most common age-associated diseases, including 
age-related macular degeneration (AMD), neurodegenerative and cardiovascular 
diseases, brain stroke, cancer, diabetes, and osteoarthritis.

INTRODUCTION: The increase in life expectancy brought a higher prevalence of 
chronic diseases, with an emphasis on those who reached advanced stages and 
required palliative care. We aimed to characterize patients diagnosed with 
advanced neoplasms and/or dementia accompanied in primary health care and to 
test the sensitivity of two tools for identifying patients with palliative 
needs.
METHODS: We recruited three voluntary family physicians who provided data 
relative to 623 patients with active codification for neoplasm and/or dementia 
on the MIM@UF platform. We defined 'patient with palliative needs' as any 
patient with this codification in advanced stadium and made their clinical and 
sociodemographic characterization. Assuming the existence of advanced-stage 
disease as the gold standard, we calculated and compared the sensitivities of 
each of the tools under study: the surprise question, the question 'do you think 
this patient has palliative needs?' and an instrument that corresponded to 
identification by at least one of the questions.
RESULTS: Among the analyzed data, there were 559 (89.7%) active codifications of 
neoplasm and 64 (10.3%) of dementia; the prevalence of advanced neoplasm and 
dementia was 1.0% in the studied sample. The subgroup of patients with advanced 
dementia showed female sex predominance, an older age, and less access to health 
care. In both subgroups there was a scarcity of data related to education and 
income, and we observed polypharmacotherapy and multimorbidity. The sensitivity 
of the surprise question was 33.3% for neoplasia and 69.3% for dementia; of the 
new tool 50.0% for neoplasia and 92.3% for dementia; and, when used together, 
55.6% for neoplasia and 92.3% for dementia.
CONCLUSION: Our results help characterize two subpopulations of patients in need 
of palliative care and advance with a possible tool for their identification, to 
be confirmed in a representative sample.

Publisher: Introdução: O aumento da esperança de vida trouxe maior prevalência 
de doenças crónicas, merecendo destaque as que atingem estádios avançados e que 
requerem cuidados paliativos. Pretendeu-se caracterizar os doentes com 
diagnóstico de neoplasia e/ou demência em estádio avançado, acompanhados em 
cuidados de saúde primários, e testar a sensibilidade de duas ferramentas para 
identificação de doentes com necessidades paliativas. Métodos: Recrutámos três 
médicos de família voluntários que forneceram dados relativos a 623 doentes com 
codificação ativa de neoplasia e/ou demência na plataforma MIM@UF. Definimos 
como ‘doente com necessidades paliativas’ todo o doente com doença em estádio 
avançado, e fizemos a sua caracterização clínica e sociodemográfica. Assumindo 
como gold standard a existência de doença em estádio avançado, calculámos e 
comparámos as sensibilidades de cada uma das ferramentas em estudo: a questão 
surpresa, a questão ‘acha que este doente tem necessidades paliativas?’ e um 
instrumento que correspondesse a identificação por pelo menos uma das questões. 
Resultados: De entre os dados analisados, existiram 559 (89,7%) codificações 
ativas de neoplasia e 64 (10,3%) de demência; a prevalência de neoplasia e 
demência avançadas foi de 1,0% na amostra estudada. O subgrupo de doentes com 
demência avançada mostrou predomínio do sexo feminino, idade superior e menor 
acesso a cuidados de saúde. Em ambos os subgrupos houve escassez de dados 
relativos à escolaridade e rendimento e observámos polifarmacoterapia e 
multimorbilidade. A sensibilidade da questão surpresa foi de 33,3% para 
neoplasia e 69,3% para demência; da nova ferramenta de 50,0% para neoplasia e 
92,3% para demência; e, quando usadas em conjunto, de 55,6% para neoplasia e 
92,3% para demência. Conclusão: Estes resultados ajudam a caracterizar duas 
subpopulações de doentes com necessidade de cuidados paliativos e avançam com 
uma possível ferramenta para sua identificação, a confirmar a sua utilidade numa 
amostra representativa.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the 3-year success of placing a single-incision midurethral 
sling (SIMS) using the Dynamic Intraoperative Standing Sling Technique (DISST) 
in an office setting under local anesthesia.
METHODS: This is a prospective case series of 20 women who underwent in-office 
SIMS procedure by the DISST from July 2019 to February 2020. This is an 
extension of our pilot study (11) and all 20 patients were evaluated at a mean 
follow-up of 34.3months. Success was defined as a composite score of objective 
success (negative standing cough test at bladder fullness), subjective success 
based on the modified PGI-I score of "very much better" or "much better," and no 
retreatment for stress urinary incontinence. Secondary objectives were adverse 
events, de novo overactivity of the bladder, recurrent urinary tract infections, 
voiding dysfunction, pain/dyspareunia, and influence on sexual function.
RESULTS: The composite success rate was 95% (95% CI [75.1, 99.9]) at the 
36-month follow-up. The significant improvement in MESA scores was maintained 
over the study period. There were no cases of de novo urgency, mesh exposure, 
postop voiding dysfunction or recurrent urinary tract infections. There were no 
cases of de novo dyspareunia.
CONCLUSION: SIMS placed by the DISST technique under local anesthesia in an 
office setting has shown sustained efficacy over a 3-year period with no 
decrease in cure. Subjects remained dry and reported excellent improvement in 
symptoms and quality of life at the 36-month follow-up visit.

OBJECTIVE: A single valued neutrosophic set represented the uncertainty of real 
life situations in terms of membership [Formula: see text], indeterminacy 
[Formula: see text] and non-membership [Formula: see text] degree. However, this 
uncertainty cannot be limited to those three degrees; there is also an 
additional refusal degree. For this issue, the Turiyam set is an appropriate 
tool, which described the neutrosophic refusal degree of this situation as a 
liberal [Formula: see text] degree in addition to those three degrees. The 
graphical representation of this situation is required for knowledge processing. 
For this purpose, the Turiyam graph was introduced as an extension of the single 
valued neutrosophic graph. This graph is helpful when the depictions of the 
vertices or their relationships or both, are considered in terms of membership 
[Formula: see text], indeterminacy [Formula: see text], non-membership [Formula: 
see text] and liberal [Formula: see text] degrees. The goal of this paper is to 
introduce the degree, order and size in the context of Turiyam graphs and 
examine a social network (SN) with the help of this graph.
RESULTS: In this regard, the degree, order and size in the context of Turiyam 
graphs are studied. The feasibility of this Turiyam graph is shown by employing 
its concept in a social network (SN). Finally, the advantage of the Turiyam 
graph over the existing graph theories is recognized by viewing its better 
framework.

BACKGROUND: More than 1.7 billion people are affected by neglected tropical 
diseases (NTDs) worldwide. Forty percent of the NTD-affected people live in 
Africa with the poorest, most vulnerable, and hard to reach geographical areas. 
The NTDs cause significant social and economic burden and deepen marginalization 
and stigmatization. The World Health Organization's current roadmap for NTD aims 
to prevent, control, eliminate, or eradicate 20 tropical diseases. Ethiopia 
experiences a high burden of these diseases, but current access to diagnostics, 
medicine, and/or care has been little explored to inform the country's NTD 
strategic plan. The overall purpose of the scoping review was to map and 
characterize the burden of NTDs and challenges in access to diagnostics, 
medicine, and/or care in Ethiopia.
METHODS: A systematic search of evidence was conducted in PubMed, Cochrane 
Library, and Google Scholar from January 2000 until May 2022, without 
restrictions of language or study design. The Preferred Reporting Items for 
Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Review was followed 
for screening of studies. Key findings were extracted and narrated 
qualitatively.
RESULTS: The search resulted in 4532 articles, of which 105 met the inclusion 
criteria and were included in the scoping review under three themes: burden of 
NTDs, access to diagnostics, medicine and/or care, and key barriers. Although 
gains have been made in the prevention and control of NTDs in Ethiopia, the 
burden remains high, and progress in access to diagnostics, medicine/drugs, 
and/or care is very slow. Poverty, poor quality of life, and underfunding of NTD 
programs decelerate the process of NTD elimination program in the country.
CONCLUSIONS: The scoping review identified a considerable number of studies on 
the burden of NTDs in Ethiopia and strategies for diagnosis, treatment, and/or 
care; however, there is a paucity of evidence on the suitability and potential 
benefits of novel diagnostic technologies and medicines in the country. A 
regular review and analysis of such country-level evidence is important to 
inform the country NTDs roadmap and local implementation strategies.

OBJECTIVES: The pandemic has exacerbated pre-existing health and socioeconomic 
inequalities around the globe. In order to mitigate the effects of extreme 
isolation and containment measures, governments have taken steps to protect the 
health, the economy, employment, and socially vulnerable groups. The health 
crisis should be treated as a pretext in order to ensure universal access to 
health and socioeconomics.The aim of this review was the presentation of the way 
the pandemic contributed to the worldwide deterioration of health inequities 
affecting in parallel the social protection in the health, economic and 
educational sector along with other factors, the effects and the measures taken, 
in order to face the consequences of a pandemic on the social protection in 
Greece in comparison with other countries of Europe.
METHODS: A cross-sectional bibliographic study was undertaken using keywords and 
phrases such as "COVID-19," "Health inequities," "Social protection," and 
"Social identifiers." The search was done through the search engines google 
scholar, PubMed, Health link, and Elsevier using either the Greek or English 
language. The total number of evaluated read-used articles was 30. Inclusion 
criteria were free full-text meta-analyses, reviews, and systematic reviews.
RESULTS: The socially disadvantaged groups in the United States were found to 
have a lower life expectancy and higher morbidity rates than privileged social 
groups, as economic, health, and sociocultural precariousness are major causes 
of death. Patients with underlying diseases are vulnerable groups and increase 
the risk of coronavirus infection and quite often lead to loss of life due to 
complications of the disease. Greece is ranked in the 4th worst position with 
61.10% in employment in all European Union (EU) countries. There is a 
significant increase in deaths with a percentage change from 2018 to date of 
17.50%. It also holds the 3rd worst position among EU countries in the field of 
unemployment, while women hold the 2nd worst with a rate of 13.50%. Overworked 
and overindebted households due to extreme measures due to the pandemic 
(reduction of working time, quarantine) led to unemployment, loss of income, 
poverty, widening social inequalities, and deteriorating care for people with 
disabilities. Children due to the closure of schools and the loss of school 
meals are led to food insecurity. The pandemic also left many children orphaned 
after the death of their parents by COVID-19, with psychosocial problems 
exacerbated by school closures.
CONCLUSIONS: The pandemic has exacerbated long-standing health and socioeconomic 
inequalities, stressing to governments the need to adopt political strategies 
that will help address them. Measures have been taken in Greece for labor 
protection, and unemployment benefits, such as the two-month extension of the 
subsidy period for the unemployed and the long-term unemployed. Minimum 
insurance days have also been reduced so that citizens employed in tourism, 
catering, and other seasonal occupations can receive unemployment benefits.

Two complementary approaches to estimate an excess of mortality: The case of 
Switzerland 2022.

Locatelli I(1), Rousson V(1).

Lausanne, Switzerland.

OBJECTIVE: During the COVID-19 pandemic, excess mortality has generally been 
estimated comparing overall mortality in a given year with either past mortality 
levels or past mortality trends, with different results. Our objective was to 
illustrate and compare the two approaches using mortality data for Switzerland 
in 2022, the third year of the COVID-19 pandemic.
METHODS: Using data from the Swiss Federal Statistical Office, standardized 
mortality rates and life expectancies in 2022 were compared with those of the 
last pre-pandemic year 2019 (first approach), as well as with those that would 
be expected if the pre-pandemic downward trend in mortality had continued during 
the pandemic (second approach). The pre-pandemic trend was estimated via a 
Poisson log-linear model on age-specific mortality over the period 2010-19.
RESULTS: Using the first approach, we estimated in Switzerland in 2022 an excess 
mortality of 2.6% (95%CI: 1.0%-4.1%) for men and 2.5% (95%CI: 1.0%-4.0%) for 
women, while the excess mortality rose to 8.4% (95%CI: 6.9%-9.9%) for men and 
6.0% (95%CI: 4.6%-7.5%) for women using the second approach. Age classes over 80 
were the main responsible for the excess mortality in 2022 for both sexes using 
the first approach, although a significant excess mortality was also found in 
most age classes above 30 using the second approach. Life expectancy in 2022 has 
been reduced by 2.7 months for men and 2.4 months for women according to the 
first approach, whereas it was reduced by respectively 8.8 and 6.0 months 
according to the second approach.
CONCLUSIONS: The excess mortality and loss of life expectancy in Switzerland in 
2022 are around three times greater if the pre-pandemic trend is taken into 
account than if we simply compare 2022 with 2019. These two different 
approaches, one being more speculative and the other more factual, can also be 
applied simultaneously and provide complementary results. In Switzerland, such a 
dual-approach strategy has shown that the pre-pandemic downward trend in 
mortality is currently halted, while pre-pandemic mortality levels have largely 
been recovered by 2022.

There is a need for understanding the breadth of interventions for caregivers of 
individuals receiving hospice care at home, given the important role caregivers 
play in caring and the negative outcomes (e.g., depression) associated with 
their caregiving. Previous reviews were limited in scope to certain types of 
interventions or patient populations. The objective of this scoping review was 
to broadly examine the interventions targeting caregivers who provide care to 
terminally ill patients in home, with the purpose of (1) describing the 
characteristics of these interventions, (2) discussing key outcomes, 
limitations, and knowledge gaps, (3) highlighting intervention strengths, and 
(4) proposing future research directions. We followed the Preferred Reporting 
Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews 
(PRISMA-ScR). Intervention studies that met the inclusion criteria and that were 
published up until October 2022 were obtained from the following databases: Ovid 
MEDLINE, Ovid EMBASE, CINAHL (EBSCO), and The Cochrane Library (Wiley). We 
analyzed 76 studies describing 55 unique interventions that took place in 14 
countries. Interventions were largely delivered by nurses (n = 18, 24%), 
followed by an interdisciplinary team (n = 16, 21%), a health care provider 
(n = 10, 13%), research staff (n = 10, 13%), social worker (n = 5, 7%), and 
others (n = 11, 15%). Six interventions (8%) were self-administered. The most 
measured outcome was caregiver quality of life (n = 20, 26%), followed by 
anxiety (n = 18, 24%) and burden (n = 15, 20%). Missing data on patient and 
caregiver characteristics (i.e., age, gender) were common, and less than half of 
studies (n = 32, 42%) reported race/ethnicity data. Our review highlighted the 
current state of interventions for caregivers of patients receiving hospice care 
at home. Many of the interventions were in the early phases of development, 
raising the need for future studies to look at efficacy, effectiveness, and the

The Body Appreciation Scale-2 (BAS-2) is a widely used measure of a core facet 
of the positive body image construct. However, extant research concerning 
measurement invariance of the BAS-2 across a large number of nations remains 
limited. Here, we utilised the Body Image in Nature (BINS) dataset - with data 
collected between 2020 and 2022 - to assess measurement invariance of the BAS-2 
across 65 nations, 40 languages, gender identities, and age groups. Multi-group 
confirmatory factor analysis indicated that full scalar invariance was upheld 
across all nations, languages, gender identities, and age groups, suggesting 
that the unidimensional BAS-2 model has widespread applicability. There were 
large differences across nations and languages in latent body appreciation, 
while differences across gender identities and age groups were 
negligible-to-small. Additionally, greater body appreciation was significantly 
associated with higher life satisfaction, being single (versus being married or 
in a committed relationship), and greater rurality (versus urbanicity). Across a 
subset of nations where nation-level data were available, greater body 
appreciation was also significantly associated with greater cultural distance 
from the United States and greater relative income inequality. These findings 
suggest that the BAS-2 likely captures a near-universal conceptualisation of the 
body appreciation construct, which should facilitate further cross-cultural

Selective use of new information is crucial for adaptive decision-making. 
Combining a gamble bidding task with assessing cortical responses using 
functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), we investigated potential effects 
of information valence on behavioral and neural processes of belief and value 
updating during uncertainty reduction in young adults. By modeling changes in 
the participants' expressed subjective values using a Bayesian model, we 
dissociated processes of (i) updating beliefs about statistical properties of 
the gamble, (ii) updating values of a gamble based on new information about its 
winning probabilities, as well as (iii) expectancy violation. The results showed 
that participants used new information to update their beliefs and values about 
the gambles in a quasi-optimal manner, as reflected in the selective updating 
only in situations with reducible uncertainty. Furthermore, their updating was 
valence-dependent: information indicating an increase in winning probability was 
underweighted, whereas information about a decrease in winning probability was 
updated in good agreement with predictions of the Bayesian decision theory. 
Results of model-based and moderation analyses showed that this 
valence-dependent asymmetry was associated with a distinct contribution of 
expectancy violation, besides belief updating, to value updating after 
experiencing new positive information regarding winning probabilities. In line 
with the behavioral results, we replicated previous findings showing 
involvements of frontoparietal brain regions in the different components of 
updating. Furthermore, this study provided novel results suggesting a 
valence-dependent recruitment of brain regions. Individuals with stronger 
oxyhemoglobin responses during value updating was more in line with predictions 
of the Bayesian model while integrating new information that indicates an 
increase in winning probability. Taken together, this study provides first 
results showing expectancy violation as a contributing factor to sub-optimal 
valence-dependent updating during uncertainty reduction and suggests limitations 
of normative Bayesian decision theory.
