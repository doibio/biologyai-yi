BACKGROUND: Infected necrosis complicates 10% of all acute pancreatitis episodes 
and is associated with 15-20% mortality. The current standard treatment for 
infected necrotizing pancreatitis is the step-up approach (catheter drainage, 
followed, if necessary, by minimally invasive necrosectomy). Catheter drainage 
is preferably postponed until the stage of walled-off necrosis, which usually 
takes 4 weeks. This delay stems from the time when open necrosectomy was the 
standard. It is unclear whether such delay is needed for catheter drainage or 
whether earlier intervention could actually be beneficial in the current step-up 
approach. The POINTER trial investigates if immediate catheter drainage in 
patients with infected necrotizing pancreatitis is superior to the current 
practice of postponed intervention.
METHODS: POINTER is a randomized controlled multicenter superiority trial. All 
patients with necrotizing pancreatitis are screened for eligibility. In total, 
104 adult patients with (suspected) infected necrotizing pancreatitis will be 
randomized to immediate (within 24 h) catheter drainage or current standard care 
involving postponed catheter drainage. Necrosectomy, if necessary, is preferably 
postponed until the stage of walled-off necrosis, in both treatment arms. The 
primary outcome is the Comprehensive Complication Index (CCI), which covers all 
complications between randomization and 6-month follow up. Secondary outcomes 
include mortality, complications, number of (repeat) interventions, hospital and 
intensive care unit (ICU) lengths of stay, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) 
and direct and indirect costs. Standard follow-up is at 3 and 6 months after 
randomization.
DISCUSSION: The POINTER trial investigates if immediate catheter drainage in 
infected necrotizing pancreatitis reduces the composite endpoint of 
complications, as compared with the current standard treatment strategy 
involving delay of intervention until the stage of walled-off necrosis.

The accessibility of antiretroviral treatments has revolutionised the life 
expectancy of people living with HIV. The efficacy of these treatments, while 
essential, must nevertheless be accompanied by the prevention and close 
monitoring of comorbidities such as certain cancers, diabetes or cardiovascular 
diseases. Finally, the support provided to people living with HIV must also take 
into account the stigmatisation to which they are still subjected.

Membrane-integral adenylyl cyclases (ACs) are key enzymes in mammalian 
heterotrimeric GTP-binding protein (G protein)-dependent signal transduction, 
which is important in many cellular processes. Signals received by the G 
protein-coupled receptors are conveyed to ACs through G proteins to modulate the 
levels of cellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). Here, we describe the 
cryo-electron microscopy structure of the bovine membrane AC9 bound to an 
activated G protein αs subunit at 3.4-angstrom resolution. The structure reveals 
the organization of the membrane domain and helical domain that spans between 
the membrane and catalytic domains of AC9. The carboxyl-terminal extension of 
the catalytic domain occludes both the catalytic and the allosteric sites of 
AC9, inducing a conformation distinct from the substrate- and activator-bound 
state, suggesting a regulatory role in cAMP production.

Regular physical activity is considered one of the most important factors for 
lifestyle, for maintaining good health in older ages and increasing life 
expectancy. Dance is considered an activity that involves coordinating movements 
with music, as well as brain activation because it is constantly necessary to 
learn and remember new steps. Dance as a musical-kinetics skill, requires the 
coordination of body movements with rhythmic stimuli, developing the 
adaptability of the movement. One-hundred-thirty (130) elderly people aged 60 
years and over (mean age 67 years old) with an average of 8 years of education, 
attended Greek traditional dance sessions for 32 weeks. The frequency was 2 
times per week, for 75 min per session. Dances were selected from all over 
Greece with moderate intensity initially. During the program, they had the 
opportunity to try with greater intensity dances. At the beginning and after the 
end of intervention all the participants were evaluated by the Fullerton Senior 
Fitness Test for their physical fitness, the Single Leg Balance and the Handgrip 
Strength Test. The results showed a significant improvement in their physical 
fitness (Chair Stand: T = -5.459, p < 0.001; Arm Curl: T = -5.750, p < 0.001; 
Back Scratch: T = -4.648, p < 0.001; Sit and Reach: T = -4.759, p < 0.001; 2 min 
Step: T = -5.567, p < 0.001; Foot Up and Go: T = -8.599, p < 0.001) and at their 
static balance with eyes open (Balance 1 leg: T = -4.996, p < 0.001) and 
Handgrip Strength (Handgrip: T = -3.490, p < 0.001). Elderly seem to enjoy 
dancing as an activity while maintaining their functionality. Probably the 
elderly in traditional dance cause prosperity in their lives by promoting active 
aging.

In the beginning of the twenty-first century, humanity faces great challenges 
regarding diseases and health-related quality of life. A drastic rise in 
bacterial antibiotic resistance, in the number of cancer patients, in the 
obesity epidemics and in chronic diseases due to life expectation extension are 
some of these challenges. The discovery of novel therapeutics is fundamental and 
it may come from underexplored environments, like marine habitats, and microbial 
origin. Actinobacteria are well-known as treasure chests for the discovery of 
novel natural compounds. In this study, eighteen Actinomycetales isolated from 
marine sponges of three Erylus genera collected in Portuguese waters were tested 
for bioactivities with the main goal of isolating and characterizing the 
responsible bioactive metabolites. The screening comprehended antimicrobial, 
anti-fungal, anti-parasitic, anti-cancer and anti-obesity properties. 
Fermentations of the selected strains were prepared using ten different 
culturing media. Several bioactivities against the fungus Aspergillus fumigatus, 
the bacteria Staphylococcus aureus methicillin-resistant (MRSA) and the human 
liver cancer cell line HepG2 were obtained in small volume cultures. Screening 
in higher volumes showed consistent anti-fungal activity by strain Dermacoccus 
sp. #91-17 and Micrococcus luteus Berg02-26. Gordonia sp. Berg02-22.2 showed 
anti-parasitic (Trypanosoma cruzi) and anti-cancer activity against several cell 
lines (melanoma A2058, liver HepG2, colon HT29, breast MCF7 and pancreatic 
MiaPaca). For the anti-obesity assay, Microbacterium foliorum #91-29 and #91-40 
induced lipid reduction on the larvae of zebrafish (Danio rerio). Dereplication 
of the extracts from several bacteria showed the existence of a variety of 
secondary metabolites, with some undiscovered molecules. This work showed that 
Actinomycetales are indeed good candidates for drug discovery.

The exponential accumulation, processing and accrual of big data in healthcare 
are only possible through an equally rapidly evolving field of big data 
analytics. The latter offers the capacity to rationalize, understand and use big 
data to serve many different purposes, from improved services modelling to 
prediction of treatment outcomes, to greater patient and disease stratification. 
In the area of infectious diseases, the application of big data analytics has 
introduced a number of changes in the information accumulation models. These are 
discussed by comparing the traditional and new models of data accumulation. Big 
data analytics is fast becoming a crucial component for the modelling of 
transmission-aiding infection control measures and policies-emergency response 
analyses required during local or international outbreaks. However, the 
application of big data analytics in infectious diseases is coupled with a 
number of ethical impacts. Four key areas are discussed in this paper: (i) 
automation and algorithmic reliance impacting freedom of choice, (ii) big data 
analytics complexity impacting informed consent, (iii) reliance on profiling 
impacting individual and group identities and justice/fair access and (iv) 
increased surveillance and population intervention capabilities impacting 
behavioural norms and practices. Furthermore, the extension of big data 
analytics to include information derived from personal devices, such as mobile 
phones and wearables as part of infectious disease frameworks in the near future 
and their potential ethical impacts are discussed. Considered together, the need 
for a constructive and transparent inclusion of ethical questioning in this 
rapidly evolving field becomes an increasing necessity in order to provide a 
moral foundation for the societal acceptance and responsible development of the 
technological advancement.

second and third trimesters using elliptic Fourier analysis.

During prenatal development, the brain is considered the best maturation 
criterion for the estimation of foetal physiological age, regardless of the 
conditions of pregnancy. Unfortunately, the brain lyses very quickly after 
death, but fortunately, the brain also has a major influence over osseous 
structures of the cranial base during development. Therefore, we considered the 
osseous structures of the cranial base potential indirect maturation indicators 
of foetal age. Because of its early formation and robustness, the basioccipital 
is a cranial base bone that is often used for studies in biological 
anthropology. Studies generally use conventional morphometry and bone size ratio 
to highlight morphological changes occurring during the foetal period and to 
create age estimation methods. These methods usually define thresholds beyond 
which the morphology of the basioccipital changes, but do not fully consider the 
form that might be valuable precisely to visualize its development or improve 
age estimation methods. Using geometric morphometric methods, the present study 
aims to analyse the development of the basioccipital during the second and third 
trimesters of foetal life by quantifying and visualizing shape changes in the 
inferior view. Basioccipital shapes are used as direct indicators of the 
maturation of the cranial base and as indirect indicators of the maturation of 
the brain and, by extension, the whole body. A sample of 221 anonymized computed 
tomographic (CT) scans of normal foetuses, ranging from 18 to 41 gestational 
weeks (GW), was used. Elliptic Fourier analysis (EFA) was used to quantify the 
basioccipital outline, and maturation stages were established to visualize shape 
changes with a principal component analysis. Our study allowed us precisely to 
quantify and continuously visualize shape changes occurring during prenatal 
life. Additionally, this study provides the first evidence of two distinct 
linear shape trajectories of the basioccipital. Foetuses aged between 18 and 26 
GW have a rapid shape change with well-individualized stages, whereas shape 
changes are less visible in the second trajectory (27-41 GW). Furthermore, 
intra-stage shape variation is higher for the basioccipital at the beginning of 
the second and third trimesters than at the first trimester. By using geometric 
morphometric methods and EFA, this study shows that it was possible to go beyond 
classical methods. Indeed, the developed methodology enabled the first 
quantification of the overall shape changes of the basioccipital between 
gestational ages. The morphological shape changes throughout the foetal period 
can be useful for anthropological studies and provide new perspectives for 
immature age estimation methods.

Aims: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of percutaneous patent foramen ovale 
(PFO) closure, from a US payer perspective. Lower rates of recurrent ischemic 
stroke have been documented following percutaneous PFO closure in properly 
selected patients. Stroke in patients aged <60 years is particularly interesting 
because this population is typically at peak economic productivity and 
vulnerable to prolonged disability. Materials and methods: A Markov model 
comprising six health states (Stable after index stroke, Transient ischemic 
attack, Post-Transient Ischemic Attack, Clinical ischemic stroke, Post-clinical 
ischemic stroke, and Death) was constructed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness 
of PFO closure in combination with medical management versus medical management 
alone. The base-case model employed a 5-year time-horizon, with transition 
probabilities, clinical inputs, costs, and utility values ascertained from 
published and national costing sources. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
(ICER) was evaluated per US guidelines, utilizing a discount rate of 3.0%. 
Results: At 5 years, overall costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) 
obtained from PFO closure compared with medical management were $16,323 vs 
$7,670 and 4.18 vs 3.77, respectively. At 5 years, PFO closure achieved an ICER 
of $21,049, beneficially lower than the conventional threshold of $50,000. PFO 
closure reached cost-effectiveness at 2.3 years (ICER = $47,145). Applying 
discount rates of 0% and 6% had a negligible impact on base-case model findings. 
Furthermore, PFO closure was 95.4% likely to be cost-effective, with a 
willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of $50,000 and a 5-year time horizon. 
Limitations: From a cost perspective, our economic model employed a US patient 
sub-population, so cost data may not extrapolate to other non-US stroke 
populations. Conclusion: Percutaneous PFO closure plus medical management 
represents a cost-effective approach for lowering the risk of recurrent stroke 
compared with medical management alone.

Slower increase in life expectancy in Australia than in other high income 
countries: the contributions of age and cause of death.

OBJECTIVES: To compare life expectancy at birth in Australia during 1980-2016 
with that in other high income countries; to estimate the contributions of age 
at death and cause of death to differences between Australia and these 
countries.
DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS: Data on deaths by age, sex, and cause in 
Australia and 26 other high income countries obtained from the Global Burden of 
Disease study.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Contributions of age, cause of death, and birth cohort to 
differences in life expectancy between Australia and other high income countries 
and to changes in the differences.
RESULTS: From 1981 to 2003, life expectancy at birth increased rapidly in 
Australia, both in absolute terms and in comparison with other high income 
countries. The main contributor to greater increases for males in Australia than 
in western Europe was lower mortality from ischaemic heart disease; compared 
with the United States, mortality from ischaemic heart disease, cerebrovascular 
disease, and transport-related injuries was lower. Since 2003, life expectancy 
has increased more slowly for both sexes than in most other high income 
countries, mainly because declines in mortality from cardiovascular disease and 
cancer have slowed. Age-specific mortality for people born since the 1970s is 
higher in Australia than in most high income countries.
CONCLUSIONS: Recent declines in mortality in Australia have been relatively 
modest. Together with the high prevalence of obesity and the limited scope for 
further increasing life expectancy by reducing the prevalence of smoking, this 
suggests that future life expectancy increases will be smaller than in other 
high income countries. Improved control of health risk factors will be required 
if further substantial life expectancy increases in Australia are to be 
achieved.

cis-Regulatory analysis for later phase of anterior neuroectoderm-specific foxQ2 
expression in sea urchin embryos.

Japan.

The specification of anterior neuroectoderm is controlled by a highly conserved 
molecular mechanism in bilaterians. A forkhead family gene, foxQ2, is known to 
be one of the pivotal regulators, which is zygotically expressed in this region 
during embryogenesis of a broad range of bilaterians. However, what controls the 
expression of this essential factor has remained unclear to date. To reveal the 
regulatory mechanism of foxQ2, we performed cis-regulatory analysis of two foxQ2 
genes, foxQ2a and foxQ2b, in a sea urchin Hemicentrotus pulcherrimus. In sea 
urchin embryos, foxQ2 is initially expressed in the entire animal hemisphere and 
subsequently shows narrower expression restricted to the anterior pole region. 
In this study, as a first step to understand the foxQ2 regulation, we focused on 
the later restricted expression and analyzed the upstream cis-regulatory 
sequences of foxQ2a and foxQ2b by using the constructs fused to short half-life 
green fluorescent protein. Based on deletion and mutation analyses of both 
foxQ2, we identified each of the five regulatory sequences, which were 4-9 bp 
long. Neither of the regulatory sequences contains any motifs for ectopic 
activation or spatial repression, suggesting that later mRNA localization is 
regulated in situ. We also suggest that the three amino acid loop 
extension-class homeobox gene Meis is involved in the maintenance of foxQ2b, the 
expression of which is dominant during embryogenesis.

Southern California, Los Angeles.

IMPORTANCE: The United States is currently facing an epidemic of deaths related 
to substance use disorder (SUD), with totals exceeding those due to motor 
vehicle crashes and gun violence. The epidemic has led to decreased life 
expectancy in some populations. In recent years, Medicaid eligibility has 
expanded in some states, and the association of this expansion with SUD-related 
deaths is yet to be examined.
OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between eligibility thresholds for state 
Medicaid coverage and SUD-related deaths.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Economic evaluation study using a 
retrospective analysis of state-level data between 2002 and 2015 to determine 
the association between the Medicaid eligibility threshold and SUD-related 
deaths, controlling for other relevant policies, state socioeconomic 
characteristics, fixed effects, and a time trend. Policy variables were lagged 
by 1 year to allow time for associations to materialize. Data were collected and 
analyzed from 2016 to 2017.
EXPOSURES: The policy of interest was the state Medicaid eligibility threshold, 
ie, the highest allowed income that qualifies a person for Medicaid, expressed 
as a percentage of the federal poverty level. State policies related to mental 
health, overdose treatment, and law enforcement of drug crimes were included as 
controls.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was number of SUD-related 
deaths, obtained from data provided by the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention.
RESULTS: Across 700 state-year observations, the mean (SD) number of SUD-related 
deaths was 21.15 (6.05) per 100 000 population. Between 2002 and 2015, the 
national SUD-related death rate increased from 16.0 to 27.5 per 100 000, while 
the average Medicaid eligibility threshold increased from 87.2% to 97.1% of the 
federal poverty level. Over this period, every 100-percentage point increase in 
the Medicaid eligibility threshold (eg, from 50% to 150% of the federal poverty 
level) was associated with 1.373 (95% CI, -2.732 to -0.014) fewer SUD-related 
deaths per 100 000 residents, a reduction of 6.50%. In the 22 states with net 
contractions in eligibility thresholds between 2005 and 2015, an estimated 
increase of 570 SUD-related deaths (95% CI, -143 to 1283) occurred. In the 28 
states that increased eligibility thresholds, an estimated 1045 SUD-related 
deaths (95% CI, -209 to 2299) may have been prevented.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These findings suggest that the overall increase in 
SUD-related deaths between 2002 and 2015 may have been greater had the average 
eligibility threshold for Medicaid not increased over this period. Broader 
eligibility for Medicaid coverage may be one tool to help reduce SUD-related 
deaths.

We analyze the interface trap states generated by the self-heating effect in 
flexible single-crystalline Si nanomembrane (sc-Si NM) transistors. Despite the 
excellent device performance (Subthreshold swing: ~61 mV/dec, Ion/off: ~109, 
Nit: ~5 × 1010 cm-2, µeff: ~250 cm²/V·s) and mechanical flexibility (RB,min ═ 1 
mm) of sc-Si NM transistors on a polymer substrate, they are vulnerable to 
thermal reliability issues due to the poor thermal conductivity (κ < 1 W/m·K) of 
the polymer substrate. Understanding the detailed mechanism driving heat-related 
device degradation is key to improving device reliability, life expectancy, and 
overall device performance. Thus, a charge pumping method was employed to 
systematically analyze the device degradation caused by the self-heating effect. 
This enabled the interface trap density to be investigated for the flexible 
sc-Si NM transistors on a polymer substrate after a bias stress. For comparison, 
a heat spreading layer (HSL) made using a 1-µm thick Ag film (κ~400 W/m·K) was 
integrated into the sc-Si NM device to mitigate the self-heating effect. The 
results showed that the interface trap density was proportional to the 
self-heating effect. This facilitated the fundamental understanding of the 
self-heating effect of flexible sc-Si NM transistors, opening a robust route to 
realizing high performance flexible devices using sc-Si NM.

BACKGROUND: The use of combination antiretroviral therapy has led to dramatic 
improvements in the life expectancy of HIV-infected persons. As result, the HIV 
population is aging and increasingly facing illnesses typically seen in the 
elderly, such as chronic kidney disease (CKD).
METHODS: A retrospective longitudinal study was conducted using data from years 
2010 and 2014 in all HIV-infected persons enrolled at the Spanish VACH cohort. 
We analyzed the prevalence and the predictive factors for developing CKD 
(estimated glomerular filtration rate, eGFR<60mL/min/1.73m2).
RESULTS: The CKD prevalence at baseline was 456/8968, 5.1% [4.6-5.6%]. Of 8512 
HIV-positive individuals examined without CKD at baseline (73.7% male, median 
age 44 years-old), 2.15% developed CKD (eGFR<60mL/min/1.73m2). The odds ratios 
[95%CI] for the independent predictive factors identified were gender (male) 
0.54 [0.39-0.75], age (per year) 1.08 [1.07-1.10], AIDS diagnosis 1.40 
[1.03-1.91], protease inhibitor-based regimens 1.49 [1.10-2.02], hypertension 
1.37 [0.94-1.99], diabetes 1.84 [1.33-2.55] and history of cardiovascular events 
1.66 [0.96-2.86].
CONCLUSION: The prevalence and risk factors for CKD and its progression are high 
in the VACH cohort. Thus, preventive measures such as control of hypertension, 
diabetes and obesity, as well as efforts for avoiding exposure to nephrotoxic 
drugs, including some antiretrovirals, are warranted in this aging HIV 
population.

INTRODUCTION: Type 2 diabetes is associated with vascular complications that 
deteriorate the quality of life and decrease the life expectancy of individuals. 
We previously reported the efficacy of sitagliptin for glucose control in 
patients with type 2 diabetes in the Sitagliptin Registration Type 2 
Diabetes-Juntendo Collaborating Project (SPIRITS-J). Through the results of the 
SPIRITS-J study, we expected that optimal comprehensive management of type 2 
diabetes according to current clinical practice guidelines in addition to 
achieving individualized glycemic goals would reduce macrovascular complications 
and all-cause mortality in Japan. The aim of this study was to evaluate this 
hypothesis.
METHODS: We investigated the clinical outcomes prospectively in the extended 
SPIRITS-J study and compared these to previous Japanese cohort studies in the 
era before widespread use of guidelines. The primary clinical outcome was a 
composite of myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, and all-cause mortality.
RESULTS: Mean duration of follow-up was 3.5 ± 1.3 years. The crude incidence of 
the primary outcome per 1000 person-years was 13.9 (non-fatal MI 1.44, non-fatal 
stroke 4.22, all-cause mortality 8.79 per 1000 person-years, respectively). It 
is noteworthy that the incidence of MI in the SPIRITS-J study was very much 
lower than that in a previous Japanese cohort study. In multivariate analysis, 
both the history of coronary artery disease and low-density lipoprotein 
cholesterol (LDL-C) were independently associated with incidence of primary 
clinical outcome.
CONCLUSION: The extended SPIRITS-J study demonstrated that optimal comprehensive 
management in patients with type 2 diabetes according to the recent practice 
guidelines has succeeded in preventing macrovascular complications in Japan. 
This study suggests that more intensive LDL-C-lowering therapy is important for 
further prevention of macrovascular complications even in Japanese patients with 
type 2 diabetes (UMIN 000004121).

BACKGROUND: Complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) is often associated with 
drug-resistant pathogens and requires therapy with broad-spectrum antibiotics. 
Choice of empiric therapy should be based on an evaluation of clinical efficacy 
and medical costs. We used a cost-utility model to compare the empiric use of a 
new antibiotic, ceftolozane/tazobactam with piperacillin/tazobactam in patients 
with cUTI.
METHODS: The analysis was conducted using a decision tree and patient-level 
simulation approach. Patients in the model received empiric antibiotic treatment 
with ceftolozane/tazobactam or piperacillin/tazobactam. Outcomes included 
mortality, medical costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Parameters 
related to pathogen distribution, length of hospital stay and medical costs, 
were estimated based on a cohort of patients with cUTI admitted during July 1st, 
2015 to August 31st, 2016 to the National Taiwan University Hospital, a teaching 
hospital in Taiwan. Isolates used for the patient-level simulation to determine 
susceptibility to either drug were taken from the Study for Monitoring 
Antimicrobial Resistance Trend database.
RESULTS: The analysis was performed on a simulation of 1000 patients. Empiric 
use of ceftolozane/tazobactam leads to higher total medical costs (USD 4199.01 
per patient versus USD 3594.76, respectively) but also more discounted QALYs 
(4.80 versus 4.78, respectively). The additional cost per discounted QALY gained 
associated with empiric ceftolozane/tazobactam was 32,521.08 USD (956,282 NTD).
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that empiric use of ceftolozane/tazobactam for 
the treatment of cUTI could be a cost-effective choice in Taiwan.

AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Diabetes increases the risk of premature death and reduces work 
productivity. We estimated the impact of diabetes in China in terms of 
mortality, years of life lost, and productivity-adjusted life years (PALYs) lost 
in the Chinese population.
METHODS: Life table modelling was used with simulated follow-up of those with 
diabetes in the Chinese population of working age (20-49 years in women and 
20-59 years in men) until retirement age (50 years for women and 60 years for 
men). Data regarding the prevalence of diabetes, as well as excess mortality, 
labour force dropout and productivity loss attributable to diabetes, were taken 
from published sources. Models were constructed for the cohort with diabetes and 
repeated for the same cohort assuming that they had no diabetes. The differences 
in number of deaths, years of life lived and PALYs lived between the two models 
reflected the impact of diabetes. The WHO standard 3% annual discount rate was 
applied to years of life and PALYs lived.
RESULTS: In 2017, an estimated 56.4 million people of working age in China 
(7.1%) had diabetes. With simulated follow-up until retirement, those with 
diabetes were predicted to experience an estimated 4.1 million more deaths, the 
loss of an additional 22.7 million years of life (3.7%) and the loss of an 
additional 75.8 million PALYs (15.1%). This was equivalent to an average of 1.3 
PALYs lost per person with diabetes. Based on gross domestic product (GDP) per 
full-time worker in 2017, the loss in PALYs equated to a total of Chinese ¥17.4 
trillion (US$2.6 trillion) in lost GDP owing to reduced productivity, with an 
average of ¥307,925 (US$45,959) lost per person with diabetes.
CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Our study demonstrates the significant cumulative 
impact of diabetes on productivity across the working lifetime in the Chinese 
population, highlighting the potential economic benefits of diabetes prevention 
in the longer term.

Our aim was to estimate and rank 12 food groups according to disability-adjusted 
life years (DALYs) from coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke, type 2 diabetes 
(T2D), and colorectal cancer (CRC) in 16 European countries. De novo published 
non-linear dose-response meta-analyses of prospective studies (based on 297 
primary reports), and food consumption data from the European Food Safety 
Authority Comprehensive European Food Consumption Database in Exposure 
Assessment, and DALY estimates from the Institute for Health Metrics and 
Evaluation were used. By implementing disease-specific counterfactual scenarios 
of theoretical minimum risk exposure level (TMRELs), the proportion of DALYs 
attributed to 12 food groups was estimated. In addition, a novel modelling 
approach was developed to obtain a single (optimized) TMREL across diseases. 
Four scenarios were analysed (A: disease-specific TMRELs/all food-disease 
associations; B: disease-specific TMRELs/only significant food-disease 
associations; C: single TMREL/all food-disease associations; D: single 
TMREL/only significant food-disease associations). Suboptimal food intake was 
associated with the following proportions of DALYs; Scenario A 
(highest-estimate) and D (lowest-estimate): CHD (A: 67%, D: 52%), stroke (A: 
49%, D: 30%), T2D (A: 57%, D: 51%), and CRC (A: 54%, D: 40%). Whole grains (10%) 
had the highest impact on DALYs, followed by nuts (7.1%), processed meat (6.4%), 
fruit (4.4%) and fish and legumes (4.2%) when combining all scenarios. The 
contribution to total DALYs of all food groups combined in the different 
scenarios ranged from 41-52% in Austria to 51-69% in the Czech-Republic. These 
findings could have important implications for planning future food-based 
dietary guidelines as a public health nutrition strategy.

We examine how childhood adversity relates to work disability and life 
expectancy, using 1999-2015 data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics. We 
estimate the probabilities of work disability and death, adjusting for age, sex, 
race/ethnicity, and education in a nationally representative sample of African 
American, Hispanic, and white women and men. We find that people in all these 
groups who experienced high adversity childhoods (individuals with four or more 
of six adversity indicators) had significantly more work disability and shorter 
lives than those who experienced no adversity. These findings provide evidence 
that childhood adversity is associated with substantial disability, and a 
reduction in life expectancy of at least a decade. Childhood adversity was 
generally associated with more lost years of life for men than for women, and 
more disability for women than for men. The results are robust, even when 
controlling for diabetes, heart disease, depression, obesity, and sedentary 
behavior.

Antibody therapy of cancer is increasingly used in the clinic and has improved 
patient's life expectancy. Except for immune checkpoint inhibition, the mode of 
action of many antibodies is to recognize overexpressed or specific tumor 
antigens and initiate either direct F(ab')2-mediated tumor cell killing, or 
Fc-mediated effects such as complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and 
antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity/phagocytosis (ADCC/P) after 
binding to activating Fc receptors. All antibodies used in the clinic are of the 
IgG isotype. The IgA isotype can, however, also elicit powerful anti-tumor 
responses through engagement of the activating Fc receptor for monomeric IgA 
(FcαRI). In addition to monocytes, macrophages and eosinophils as FcαRI 
expressing immune cells, neutrophils are especially vigorous in eliminating IgA 
opsonized tumor cells. However, with IgG as single agent it appears almost 
impossible to activate neutrophils efficiently, as we have visualized by live 
cell imaging of tumor cell killing. In this study, we investigated Fc receptor 
expression, binding and signaling to clarify why triggering of neutrophils by 
IgA is more efficient than by IgG. FcαRI expression on neutrophils is ~2 times 
and ~20 times lower than that of Fcγ receptors FcγRIIa and FcγRIIIb, but still, 
binding of neutrophils to IgA- or IgG-coated surfaces was similar. In addition, 
our data suggest that IgA-mediated binding of neutrophils is more stable 
compared to IgG. IgA engagement of neutrophils elicited stronger Fc receptor 
signaling than IgG as indicated by measuring the p-ERK signaling molecule. We 
propose that the higher stoichiometry of IgA to the FcαR/FcRγ-chain complex, 
activating four ITAMs (Immunoreceptor Tyrosine-based Activating Motifs) compared 
to a single ITAM for FcγRIIa, combined with a possible decoy role of the highly 
expressed FcγRIIIb, explains why IgA is much better than IgG at triggering tumor 
cell killing by neutrophils. We anticipate that harnessing the vast population 
of neutrophils by the use of IgA monoclonal antibodies can be a valuable 
addition to the growing arsenal of antibody-based therapeutics for cancer 
treatment.
