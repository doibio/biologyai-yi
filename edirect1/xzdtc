The indicator of average life expectancy at birth is widely used as systemic 
indicator of population quality of life and health. The purpose of the study is 
to identify, to evaluate quantitative and structural changes of indicator of 
life expectancy at birth in population of the Irkutsk Oblast during 1990-2019. 
The data of life expectancy at birth was obtained from the Rosstat websites. The 
original calculations of survival tables were carried out using the databases of 
the Center for Demographic Research at the New Economic School. The analysis of 
trends was carried out using linear regression analysis. The analysis of role of 
exogenous and endogenous determination of mortality in formation of average life 
expectancy was carried out. In 1990-2005, in the Irkutsk Oblast, occurred change 
in ranking of causes of death that determined the greatest irrecoverable losses 
of population and reduction of indicator of average life expectancy at birth. 
The essence of this change is in abnormally high proportion of exogenous causes 
of mortality, especially class of external causes of mortality, in the structure 
of irreversible demographic losses. In the Irkutsk Oblast, in 2006-2019, 
occurred favorable changes in the structure of irrecoverable losses, testifying 
returning to modern type of mortality. During the same period, indicator of 
average life expectancy at birth increased. It is established that changes 
occurred since 2006 in the quantitative and structural indices of mortality and 
average life expectancy at birth are very positive. However, during demographic 
processes in 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic intervened. This factor is bringing 
negative impact on economy, and after that on social sphere and public health. 
The further course of development of social demographic situation in the Irkutsk 
Oblast, in particular, dynamics of indicator of average life expectancy at 
birth, will depend on success of activities of authorities of all levels in 
struggle with pandemic and overcoming crisis events in social economic 
development.

Showdomycin produced by Streptomyces showdoensis ATCC 15227 is a C-nucleoside 
microbial natural product with antimicrobial and cytotoxic properties. The 
unique feature of showdomycin in comparison to other nucleosides is its 
maleimide base moiety, which has the distinct ability to alkylate nucleophilic 
thiol groups by a Michael addition reaction. In order to understand 
structure-activity relationships of showdomycin, we synthesized a series of 
derivatives with modifications in the maleimide ring at the site of alkylation 
to moderate its reactivity. The showdomycin congeners were designed to retain 
the planarity of the base ring system to allow Watson-Crick base pairing and 
preserve the nucleosidic character of the compounds. Consequently, we 
synthesized triphosphates of showdomycin derivatives and tested their activity 
against RNA polymerases. Bromo, methylthio, and ethylthio derivatives of 
showdomycin were incorporated into RNA by bacterial and mitochondrial RNA 
polymerases and somewhat less efficiently by the eukaryotic RNA polymerase II. 
Showdomycin derivatives acted as uridine mimics and delayed further extension of 
the RNA chain by multi-subunit, but not mitochondrial RNA polymerases. 
Bioactivity profiling indicated that the mechanism of action of 
ethylthioshowdomycin was altered, with approximately 4-fold reduction in both 
cytotoxicity against human embryonic kidney cells and antibacterial activity 
against Escherichia coli. In addition, the ethylthio derivative was not 
inactivated by medium components or influenced by addition of uridine in 
contrast to showdomycin. The results explain how both the maleimide ring and the 
nucleoside nature contribute to the bioactivity of showdomycin and demonstrates 
for the first time that the two activities can be separated.

Expectancies for pain and pain relief are central to experimental models of 
placebo analgesia and nocebo hyperalgesia and are a promising target for 
clinical intervention in patients with chronic pain. Affective states may play 
an important role in modulating the degree to which expectancies influence pain, 
broadening the opportunities for intervention targets. However, findings to date 
have been mixed and mostly limited to laboratory designs. Few studies have 
examined the interplay of naturally occurring affective states, pain 
expectancies, and pain experiences in the course of daily life with chronic 
pain. In this study, patients with temporomandibular disorder reported their 
daily pain expectancies and affective states each morning and their daily pain 
experience each evening, over a 2-week period. Multilevel modeling analyses 
revealed the association of morning pain expectancies with subsequent pain 
experiences was moderated by morning positive affective state ( B = 0.04, SE = 
0.02, t = 2.00, P = 0.046) such that the congruent assimilation of a low pain 
expectancy with a low pain experience was starkest when morning positive affect 
was higher than usual. Relatedly, higher morning positive affect predicted 
greater odds of experiencing a match between pain expectancies and pain 
experience when the expectation was for low, but not high, pain levels (odds 
ratio = 1.19, confidence interval: 1.01-1.41, P = 0.03). Negative affect, in 
contrast, did not significantly influence the assimilation of high pain 
expectancies with high pain experiences. These findings extend previous 
experimental studies by showing that the association of daily pain expectancies 
with pain experience varies as a function of affective state.

BACKGROUND: Paediatric patients being treated for long-term physical health 
conditions (LTCs) have elevated mental health needs. However, mental health 
services in the community are difficult to access in the usual course of care 
for these patients. The Lucy Project - a self-referral drop-in access point-was 
a program to address this gap by enrolling patients for low-intensity 
psychological interventions during their treatment for LTCs. In this paper, we 
evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the Lucy Project.
METHODS: Using a pre-post design, we evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the 
intervention by calculating the base-case incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
(ICER) using outcomes data and expenses recorded by project staff. The target 
population was paediatric patients enrolled in the program with an average age 
of 9 years, treated over a time horizon of 6 months. Outcome data were collected 
via the Paediatric Quality of Life Inventory, which was converted to health 
utility scores using an instrument found in the literature. The QALYs were 
estimated using these health utility scores and the length of the intervention. 
We calculate a second, practical-case incremental cost-effectiveness ratio using 
streamlined costing figures with maximum capacity patient enrolment within a 
one-year time horizon, and capturing lessons learned post-trial.
RESULTS: The base-case model showed an ICER of £21,220/Quality Adjusted Life 
Years (QALY) gained, while the practical model showed an ICER of £4,359/QALY 
gained. The practical model suggests the intervention garners significant gains 
in quality of life at an average cost of £309 per patient. Sensitivity analyses 
reveal use of staff time was the greatest determinant of the ICER, and the 
intervention is cost-effective 75% of the time in the base-case model, and 94% 
of the time in the practical-case model at a cost-effectiveness threshold of 
£20,000/QALY gained.
CONCLUSIONS: We find the base-case intervention improves patient outcomes and 
can be considered cost-effective according to the National Institute for Health 
and Care Excellence (NICE) threshold of £20,000-£30,000/QALY gained, and the 
practical-case intervention is roughly four times as cost-effective as the 
base-case. We recommend future studies incorporate a control group to 
corroborate the effect size of the intervention.

BACKGROUND: The population of people aged 60 and older is rapidly increasing in 
developing countries such as Iran due to declining birth rates and increased 
life expectancy. Old age is associated with increased risk for frailty and 
reduced dignity. Frailty is a clinical syndrome characterized by depletion of 
physical reserves and multiple system disorders, reducing the individual's 
ability to cope with stressful events. Dignity is an inherent characteristic of 
human beings and respecting dignity is an ethical principle. This study 
investigated the association of frailty with dignity among older people in 
Tehran, Iran.
METHODS: This correlational study was conducted on 200 individuals aged 60 years 
and older. Data collection relied on the Demographic Questionnaire, Frailty 
Index for Elders (FIFE) and the Patient Dignity Inventory (PDI). Data were 
analyzed with SPSS 25.
RESULTS: The mean age of the participants was 68 ± 5.05 years; 62% of the 
participants were at risk for frailty, and 69% had few dignity-related problems. 
The multiple regression results showed that frailty was significantly associated 
with dignity (ß = 0.571, p < 0.001). The association was significant across all 
the dimensions of dignity measured by the PDI. The highest predictors of frailty 
included dependency (ß = 0.584, p < 0.001), followed by existential distress (ß 
= 0.560, p < 0.001), symptom distress (ß = 0.400, p = 0.400), social support (ß 
= 0.391, p < 0.001), and peace of mind (ß = 0.338, p < 0.001) in dignity.
CONCLUSIONS: The results show that higher levels of frailty in older people are 
associated with decreases in their dignity, and frailty was the leading 
predictor of dignity. Providers should develop programs to prevent and reduce 
frailty in those at risk and to enhance the dignity of the already frail.

BACKGROUND: U.S. veterans report high rates of traumatic experiences and mental 
health symptomology [e.g. posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)]. The stress 
sensitization hypothesis posits experiences of adversity sensitize individuals 
to stress reactions which can lead to greater psychiatric problems. We extend 
this hypothesis by exploring how multiple adversities such as early childhood 
adversity, combat-related trauma, and military sexual trauma related to 
heterogeneity in stress over time and, subsequently, greater risk for PTSD.
METHODS: 1230 veterans were recruited for an observational, longitudinal study. 
Veterans responded to questionnaires on PTSD, stress, and traumatic experiences 
five times over an 18-month study period. We used latent transition analysis to 
understand how heterogeneity in adverse experiences is related to transition 
into stress trajectory classes. We also explored how transition patterns related 
to PTSD symptomology.
RESULTS: Across all models, we found support for stress sensitization. In 
general, combat trauma in combinations with other types of adverse experiences, 
namely early childhood adversity and military sexual trauma, imposed a greater 
probability of transitioning into higher risk stress profiles. We also showed 
differential effects of early childhood and military-specific adversity on PTSD 
symptomology.
CONCLUSION: The present study rigorously integrates both military-specific and 
early life adversity into analysis on stress sensitivity, and is the first to 
examine how sensitivity might affect trajectories of stress over time. Our study 
provides a nuanced, and specific, look at who is risk for sensitization to 
stress based on previous traumatic experiences as well as what transition 
patterns are associated with greater PTSD symptomology.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to synthesize available evidence on the 
effectiveness and safety of COVID-19 vaccines for frail older adults through a 
rapid review, supplemented with geriatricians' consensus statements.
METHODS: References were identified through MEDLINE and Web of Science on 1st 
February 2021 using relevant terms related to COVID-19, vaccine, and older 
adults. Searches were also conducted on reference lists of review articles and 
Google Scholar. The content was updated on 8th April via hand searching. We 
included studies on Phase III randomized controlled trials, and data from real 
world administration of vaccines. A two-round Delphi study was conducted with 15 
geriatricians to elicit their thoughts and recommendations regarding COVID-19 
vaccination for frail older adults.
RESULTS: Five Phase III randomized controlled efficacy trials reported vaccine 
efficacy ranging from 66.7% to 95% among participants aged 16 to 95. The vaccine 
efficacy for participants aged 65 and above is 94.7% and 86.4% for 
Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna respectively. Sputnik V reported a vaccine efficacy 
of 91.8% for participants 60 and above. Serious adverse events were reported by 
0.27% to 1% of participants who received at least one dose of the four vaccines. 
For the Delphi study, 16 out of 24 statements achieved consensus. The Delphi 
panel opined that frail or very old adults, except those with limited life 
expectancy, should be vaccinated due to their vulnerability. They also agree 
that vaccination decisions should be made by patients when possible, with the 
involvement of next-of-kin should the frail older adult be unable to do so. 
Lastly, the panel thought that frail older adults should be included in future 
clinical trials.
CONCLUSION: In early clinical trials, there is paucity of evidence on efficacy 
and safety of current COVID-19 vaccines among frail older adults. Geriatricians' 
consensus indicate that frail older adults should be vaccinated except where 
life expectancy is limited. Future trials assessing efficacy and safety should 
include frail older adults.

Dynamic evolutionary history of spiralian-specific TALE homeobox genes in 
mollusks.

Japan.

Homeobox genes play essential roles in the early development of many animals. 
Although the repertoire of most homeobox genes, including three amino acid loop 
extension (TALE)-type homeobox genes, is conserved in animals, spiralian-TALE 
(SPILE) genes are a notable exception. In this study, SPILE genes were extracted 
from the genomic data of 22 mollusk species and classified into four clades 
(-A/C, -B, -D, and -E) to determine which SPILE genes exhibit dynamic repertoire 
changes. While SPILE-D and -E duplications were rarely observed, SPILE-B 
duplication was observed in the bivalve lineage and SPILE-A/C duplication was 
observed in multiple clades. Conversely, most or all SPILE genes were lost in 
cephalopods and in some gastropod lineages. SPILE gene expression patterns were 
also analyzed in multiple mollusk species using publicly available RNA-seq data. 
The majority of SPILE genes examined, particularly those in the A/C- and 
B-clades, were specifically expressed during early development, suggesting that 
most SPILE genes exert specific roles in early development. This comprehensive 
cataloging and characterization revealed a dynamic evolutionary history, 
including SPILE-A/C and -B gene duplications and the loss of SPILE genes in 
several lineages. Furthermore, this study provides a useful resource for 
studying the molecular mechanism of spiralian early development and the 
evolution of young and lineage-specific transcription factors.

Sex differences in telomere length, lifespan, and embryonic dyskerin levels.

BC, Canada.

Telomerase levels in most human cells are insufficient to prevent loss of 
telomeric DNA with each replication cycle. The resulting "Hayflick" limit may 
have allowed lifespan to increase by suppressing the development of tumors early 
in life be it at the expense of compromised cellular responses late in life. At 
any given age, the average telomere length in leukocytes shows considerably 
variation between individuals with females having, on average, longer telomeres 
than males. Sex differences in average telomere length are already present at 
birth and correspond to reported differences in the average life expectancy 
between the sexes. Levels of telomerase RNA and dyskerin, encoded by DKC1, are 
known to limit telomerase activity in embryonic stem cells. X-linked DKC1 is 
expressed from both alleles in female embryo cells and higher levels of dyskerin 
and telomerase could elongate telomeres prior to embryo implantation. The 
hypothesis that embryonic telomerase levels set the stage for the sex 
differences in telomere length and lifespan deserves further study.

Indiana.

BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease (SCD) leads to end-organ damage and shortened 
life expectancy. The second highest incidence of SCD in Indiana is in Lake 
County, but until 2017, there was no SCD expert within 65 miles. The Indiana 
Hemophilia and Thrombosis Center (IHTC) developed the Sickle Care coordination 
OutReach and Education (SCORE) program in 2017 to bring high-quality, 
guideline-based care to children with SCD.
PROCEDURE: The St. Vincent IRB deemed this retrospective analysis of SCORE 
clinic care from 2017 to 2020 exempt. Data on the number of transcranial 
Dopplers (TCD) performed, HU dosing escalation, and vaccine rates were collected 
along with the number of school and home visits completed.
RESULTS: Fifty-three children, adolescents, and young adults completed 288 SCORE 
clinic visits during the study period; over 75% completed at least three clinic 
visits. Mean HU dose increased significantly with SCORE clinic care. TCD 
screening rates increased every year starting in 2018 through 2020 when we added 
local care coordination. One hundred seventy-three vaccines were administered in 
SCORE outreach clinics. The PPSV23 vaccines had a 100% acceptance rate, and 
seasonal influenza had a 75.8% acceptance rate.
CONCLUSION: Access to care coordination services and local hematology specialty 
care alleviates barriers to care and enables comprehensive SCD care delivery to 
children in need. Prior to the establishment of the SCORE clinic, 75% of 
children in Lake County were not receiving recommended stroke screening. The 
SCORE clinic model demonstrates feasibility and impact when delivering on the 
promise of high-quality care for children with SCD.

AIM: To explore changes in body weight and cardiometabolic risk factors after 
treatment withdrawal in the STEP 1 trial extension.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: STEP 1 (NCT03548935) randomized 1961 adults with a body 
mass index ≥ 30 kg/m2 (or ≥ 27 kg/m2 with ≥ 1 weight-related co-morbidity) 
without diabetes to 68 weeks of once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg 
(including 16 weeks of dose escalation) or placebo, as an adjunct to lifestyle 
intervention. At week 68, treatments (including lifestyle intervention) were 
discontinued. An off-treatment extension assessed for a further year a 
representative subset of participants who had completed 68 weeks of treatment. 
This subset comprised all eligible participants from any site in Canada, Germany 
and the UK, and sites in the United States and Japan with the highest main phase 
recruitment. All analyses in the extension were exploratory.
RESULTS: Extension analyses included 327 participants. From week 0 to week 68, 
mean weight loss was 17.3% (SD: 9.3%) with semaglutide and 2.0% (SD: 6.1%) with 
placebo. Following treatment withdrawal, semaglutide and placebo participants 
regained 11.6 (SD: 7.7) and 1.9 (SD: 4.8) percentage points of lost weight, 
respectively, by week 120, resulting in net losses of 5.6% (SD: 8.9%) and 0.1% 
(SD: 5.8%), respectively, from week 0 to week 120. Cardiometabolic improvements 
seen from week 0 to week 68 with semaglutide reverted towards baseline at week 
120 for most variables.
CONCLUSIONS: One year after withdrawal of once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 
2.4 mg and lifestyle intervention, participants regained two-thirds of their 
prior weight loss, with similar changes in cardiometabolic variables. Findings 
confirm the chronicity of obesity and suggest ongoing treatment is required to 
maintain improvements in weight and health.

Although accurate base-pairing ensures specificity of molecular recognition, DNA 
polymerization and DNA amplification, there are many non-specific pairings that 
arise from mismatched pairs, such as the T/G wobble pair. We have found that by 
using 2-S-TTP (STTP), we can minimize T/G mismatch, improve the DNA 
polymerization specificity and enhance the detection sensitivity (up to 20 
fold), without significantly compromising the polymerization efficiency (the 
extension rate ratio of TTP vs.STTP is 1.08). With the STTP strategy, DNA 
polymerization is more specific and allows the detection of pathogens (such as 
COVID-19) in single digits (up to 5 copies), which is not possible with 
conventional RT-PCR. We have discovered that STTP can generally promote much 
higher specificity and sensitivity in DNA polymerization and nucleic acid 
detection than canonical TTP.

BACKGROUND: The life expectancy of patients with severe mental illness (SMI) is 
estimated to be 20 to 30 years shorter than in the general population due to 
avoidable physical illnesses. This gap is widening. Health care professionals' 
performance with regard to physical health and lifestyle appears to be 
suboptimal.
AIMS: The purpose of this study is to formulate recommendations to enhance 
physical care for patients with an SMI.
METHODS: A generic descriptive qualitative study was conducted. Fifteen mental 
health nurses (MHNs) working in community mental health care in the Netherlands 
were interviewed. Thematic analysis of the data was performed.
RESULTS: Most MHNs perceived physical screening and lifestyle interventions to 
be an important part of their professional role. However, they recognize 
discrepancy between their perception and actual practice. Most MHNs focus in 
particular on the psychiatric illness and its consequences for daily living, and 
they defined the provision of physical health care as a secondary concern. 
Participants described building a therapeutic relationship as a crucial, 
however, difficult part of the process of working on physical health promotion. 
Many MHNs tend to formulate goals and necessary behavioral changes on behalf of 
their patients, rather than helping them formulate their own goals and 
activities for themselves.
CONCLUSIONS: Building a good therapeutic relationship with patients and 
supporting patients in defining their own lifestyle goals can enhance nursing 
physical care. Support by other team members (such as NPs) and managers is 
needed. In training and education for professionals, the lessons learned in this 
study should be included.

Flowering is a critical stage in plant life history, which is coordinated by 
environmental signals and endogenous cues. Phytomelatonin is a widely 
distributed indoleamine present in all living organisms and plays pleiotropic 
roles in plant growth and development. Recent evidence has established that 
phytomelatonin could modulate flowering in many species, probably in a 
concentration-dependent manner. Phytomelatonin seems to associate with floral 
meristem identification and floral organ formation, and the fluctuation of 
phytomelatonin might be important for flowering. Regarding the underlying 
mechanisms, phytomelatonin interacts with the central components of floral gene 
regulatory networks directly or indirectly, including the MADS-box gene family, 
phytohormones, and reactive oxygen species (ROS). From an evolutionary point of 
view, the actions of phytomelatonin in flowering probably evolved during the 
period of the diversification of flowering plants and could be regarded as a 
functional extension of its primary activities. The presumed evolutionary 
history of phytomelatonin-modulated flowering is proposed, presented in the 
chronological order of the appearance of phytomelatonin and core flowering 
regulators, namely DELLA proteins, ROS, and phytohormones. Further efforts are 
needed to address some intriguing aspects, such as the exploration of the 
association between phytomelatonin and photoperiodic flowering, 
phytomelatonin-related floral MADS-box genes, the crosstalk between 
phytomelatonin and phytohormones, as well as its potential applications in 
agriculture.

Clinical Profile of Central Nervous System Involvement in Patients with Rhino 
Orbital Cerebral Mucormycosis.

Yadav S(1), Bs N(1), Ak S(1).

Author information:
(1)Bangalore Medical College, Kalaburgi.

Mucormycosis is life threatening fungal infection that occurs in 
immunocompromised patients. Patients at risk are those with poorly controlled 
diabetes mellitus, immunosuppressed patients such as those undergoing treatment 
for hematological cancer or recipients of solid organ and hematopoietic stem 
cell transplantation. COVID 19 infection is known to produce a state of hyper 
inflammation with release of various cytokines this state of immune dysfunction 
is associated with development of opportunistic infections, of which 
Mucormycosis is on the rise currently. The widespread use of corticosteroids can 
cause secondary infections including mucormycosis. CNS penetration typically 
starts with nasal involvement followed by the paranasal sinuses and palate, 
ultimately invading the orbit and brain or by direct hematological spread which 
is called as Rhino-orbito-cerebral Mucormycosis (ROCM) .
MATERIAL: This is a cross sectional study conducted on 50 patients diagnosed 
with COVID 19 associated mucormycosis admitted to the hospitals attached to 
BMCRI from May2021 to August 2021.All the ROCM cases with CNS manifestation were 
included The relevant demographic data, clinical presentation, neurologic 
manifestations, underlying co morbidity, medical treatments, and surgical 
interventions done were recorded and analyzed.
OBSERVATION: A total of 50 patients were included mean age 49.3 year with 38 
males and 12 females .Most common comorbidity was diabetes (94%)followed by 
hypertension (26%) .Most common symptom was headache (86%) followed by facial 
swelling (68%), facial pain (66%).40% Patients had CNS symptom among which most 
common was hemiparesis. EOM restriction(70%) and abnormal vision(70%) being most 
common examination finding. Most common sinus being involved was maxillary 94% 
followed by ethmoid sinus 92%. Neurological manifestation included acute infarct 
(56%), Cavernous sinus thrombosis (28%),ICA occlusion (10%) abscess (34%), 3 
patients had dual fungal infection. 26% patient underwent craniotomy, 
6%carniotomy with Denkers procedure, 30% underwent maxillectomy. Among the 
mortality group, average duration of diabetes was 11.5 years, average steroid 
use of 9.53 days, CRP was 104mg/l, D Dimer 755ng/dl, as compared to 5.89 years, 
5.3 days, 58.9mg/l, 419ng/dl, respectively among recovered patients. Most 
patient were left with morbidity like vision loss and facial disfigurement (40%) 
being most common while hemiparesis in (14%) patients .
CONCLUSION: Diabetes mellitus being the main predisposing factor for ROCM. 
Delayed diagnosis or inappropriate treatment may result in massive tissue 
destruction and possible extension into the cranial base and/or vault and orbit. 
Despite advances in imaging and the availability of novel drugs, cerebral 
mucormycosis continues to be associated with high rates of death and disability.

BACKGROUND: Smoking is believed as one of the major risk factors resulting in a 
variety of non-communicable diseases, such as lung cancer and chronic 
respiratory diseases (CRDs). However, the global burden of CRDs attributed to 
smoking has not been systematically studied, particularly across different 
temporal and spatial scales.
METHODS: We conducted a systematic analysis of the Global Burden of CRDs and 
related risk factors using data from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019. 
Incidence, death, risk factors, and other parameters such as estimated annual 
percentage change have been analyzed. We also compared various risk factors 
across regions, countries, and genders.
RESULTS: Globally, the incidence of CRDs and deaths cases have increased in the 
last 30 years, while the corresponding age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR) 
and death rate (ASDR) have declined. Smoking was the leading risk factor for the 
death of CRDs all over the world. However, in low and low-middle 
Socio-demographic Index (SDI) areas, particulate matter pollution was the main 
risk factor leading to death from CRDs, while smoking was ranked first among the 
major risk factors in areas with middle, middle-high, or high SDI. Globally, 
gender differences in morbidity and mortality from CRDs were observed. Males had 
slightly more cases and ASIR of chronic respiratory diseases than females over 
the last 30 years. However, the mortality cases and ASDR in males were 
significantly higher than that of females. Furthermore, the ASDR of all major 
risk factors, specially smoking, was higher in men than in women.
CONCLUSIONS: CRDs were still major threats human health. The current study 
highlights the dominating roles of smoking for death risks resulting from CRDs, 
followed by PM pollution. Therefore, tobacco control and improving air quality 
are key to reducing deaths from CRDs.

Background: People with hematological malignancies can deteriorate rapidly to a 
terminal event and have variable levels of engagement when transitioning to 
palliative and end-of-life care. Objectives: To describe end-of-life care values 
and preferences of people with hematological malignancies and explore whether 
these align with hematology clinicians' perceptions. Design: Two matched 
anonymous quantitative cross-sectional surveys explored: (1) patients' values 
and preferences around manner and timing of discussions regarding life 
expectancy and prognosis, involvement in decision making, and concurrent 
integration of palliative care with active treatment; and (2) clinicians' 
perceptions of their patients' values and preferences in relation to prognostic 
information. Settings/Participants: Concurrent online national surveys of people 
with hematological malignancies known to the Leukemia Foundation of Australia, 
and clinicians in Australia with membership to the Hematology Society of 
Australia and New Zealand. Results: Five hundred nine (38% response rate) 
patients (median age 64 [min 20, max 89, interquartile range 56-70]) and 272 
clinicians (21% response rate) responded to the survey. If their health was 
deteriorating, most patients wanted honest prognostic and life expectancy 
information (87%); welcomed involvement in decision making (94%); felt they 
would be comfortable talking to the treating team about the possibility of death 
(86%); and would be comfortable seeing someone from a specialist palliative care 
team (74%). Clinicians generally underestimated most of these responses. 
Conclusion: Although our findings indicate that most people believe they would 
be comfortable discussing prognosis, life expectancy, and wishes at the end of 
life, clinicians were largely unaware of their preferences. This highlights the 
need to embed values clarification in routine care for each patient and family.

BACKGROUND: Evidence and guidelines increasingly support an individualised 
approach to care for people with type 2 diabetes and individualisation of 
glycaemic targets in response to patient factors.
METHODS: We undertook a scoping review of the literature for evidence of factors 
impacting upon glycated haemoglobin target individualisation in adults with type 
2 diabetes. Data were analysed thematically with the themes inductively derived 
from article review.
FINDINGS: Evidence suggests that presence of cardiovascular disease, 
hypoglycaemia unawareness, severe hypoglycaemia, limited life expectancy, 
advanced age, long diabetes duration, frailty, cognitive impairment, disability, 
extensive comorbidity, diabetes distress and patient preference should inform 
the setting of glycaemic targets.
CONCLUSION: The management of people with diabetes is complex. In clinical 
practice, many patients will have a variety of factors that should be considered 
when personalising their care. Approaches to personalised care and glycaemic 
treatment targets should be undertaken as part of a shared decision-making 
process between physician and patient. Use of electronic records might enable 
greater efficiency and more widespread use of personalised care plans for people 
with diabetes.
