OBJECTIVES: Patients with peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAOD) are at 
risk of worsening limb symptoms, major adverse cardiovascular events and exhibit 
an impaired life expectancy. There is a lack of evidence on the extent of 
pharmacological secondary prevention in PAOD patients. This study assesses 
treatment patterns of antithrombotic agents in symptomatic PAOD patients.
METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study using data from the second largest 
insurance fund in Germany, BARMER. We included symptomatic PAOD patients 
undergoing in-hospital treatment with an index admission between 1 January 2010 
and 31 December 2017. Outcomes were proportions of single antiplatelets (SAPT), 
dual antiplatelets (DAPT), vitamin-K antagonists (VKA), or direct oral 
anticoagulants (DOAC) in the 12 months prior and 6 months after the index 
hospitalization. Non-parametric cumulative incidence for competing risks was 
estimated to account for censoring and death after discharge from hospital stay. 
Patient flows were visualised by alluvial diagrams. All analyses were stratified 
by intermittent claudication (IC) and chronic limb-threatening ischaemia (CLTI). 
The protocol was registered to ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03909022).
RESULTS: A total of 80,426 unique patient encounters were identified. Mean age 
was 72.7 (46.3% female). Amongst all patients, 25.6% were on SAPT, 4.1% on DAPT, 
9.1% on VKA, 3.9% on DOAC, 3.9% on both antiplatelets and oral anticoagulation, 
and 53.3% without any antithrombotic therapy during the 12 months before index 
stay. The estimated cumulative incidence was 37.9% SAPT, 14.8% DAPT, 7.5% VKA, 
4.3% DOAC, 7.4% both, and 28.1% without any antithrombotic therapy during the 6 
months after index stay. The considerable increases in antiplatelet therapy were 
mainly driven by the group of patients without antithrombotics before index 
stay. As compared with IC, patients who suffered from CLTI received less often 
antiplatelets but more often anticoagulants both before and after index stay.
CONCLUSIONS: Utilisation rates of antithrombotic therapy increased considerably 
after in-hospital treatment for PAOD. Yet, remarkably high rates of symptomatic 
patients without any blood-thinning therapy constitute a major concern with 
respect to adequate secondary prevention of PAOD patients.

The progressive improvement of lymphoma treatment has led to an important 
prolongation of patient survival and life expectancy. The principal 
international scientific societies of oncology now therefore recommend that 
long-term survivors of lymphoma join fertility programs. Specifically, 
fertile-age patients should be assisted by a multidisciplinary team, including 
specialists dedicated to fertility preservation in oncology, in order to support 
the completion of their reproductive project. In the general population, the use 
of Myo-Inositol and D-Chiro-Inositol (MI/DCI) has been demonstrated to be an 
effective choice to treat ovarian dysfunctions, with a consequent improvement in 
reproductive outcomes, so it may represent an adjuvant strategy for this 
purpose. We therefore conducted a pilot prospective case-control study to 
evaluate the potentialities of this nutritional supplement, with the aim of 
optimizing reproductive function in female long-term survivors of lymphoma. One 
group underwent oral supplementation with MI 1200 mg and DCI 135 mg per day for 
12 months, compared with controls who underwent no treatment in the same period. 
After 12 months, FSH, LH, and progesterone levels, as well as oligomenorrhea and 
antral follicle count (AFC), were significantly improved in the MI/DCI group. In 
addition, a significantly higher mean value in FSH and LH and a significantly 
lower mean AFC value in the right ovary were observed in controls compared to 
the MI/DCI group. Despite the need for further investigation, MI/DCI could be 
considered a potential adjuvant strategy to restore ovarian function in female 
long-term survivors of lymphoma.

Potentilla bifurca is widely distributed in Eurasia, including the Tibetan 
Plateau. It is a valuable medicinal plant in the Tibetan traditional medicine 
system, especially for the treatment of diabetes. This study investigated the 
functional gene profile of Potentilla bifurca at different altitudes by 
RNA-sequencing technology, including de novo assembly of 222,619 unigenes from 
405 million clean reads, 57.64% of which were annotated in Nr, GO, KEGG, Pfam, 
and Swiss-Prot databases. The most significantly differentially expressed top 50 
genes in the high-altitude samples were derived from plants that responded to 
abiotic stress, such as peroxidase, superoxide dismutase protein, and the 
ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme. Pathway analysis revealed that a large number of 
DEGs encode key enzymes involved in secondary metabolites, including 
phenylpropane and flavonoids. In addition, a total of 298 potential genomic SSRs 
were identified in this study, which provides information on the development of 
functional molecular markers for genetic diversity assessment. In conclusion, 
this study provides the first comprehensive assessment of the Potentilla bifurca 
transcriptome. This provides new insights into coping mechanisms for non-model 
organisms surviving in harsh environments at high altitudes, as well as 
molecular evidence for the selection of superior medicinal plants.

As an extension of our research against COVID-19, a multiphase in silico 
approach was applied in the selection of the three most common inhibitors 
(Glycyrrhizoflavone (76), Arctigenin (94), and Thiangazole (298)) against 
papain-like protease, PLpro (PDB ID: 4OW0), among 310 metabolites of natural 
origin. All compounds of the exam set were reported as antivirals. The 
structural similarity between the examined compound set and S88, the 
co-crystallized ligand of PLpro, was examined through structural similarity and 
fingerprint studies. The two experiments pointed to Brevicollin (28), 
Cryptopleurine (41), Columbamine (46), Palmatine (47), Glycyrrhizoflavone (76), 
Licochalcone A (87), Arctigenin (94), Termilignan (98), Anolignan B (99), 
4,5-dihydroxy-6″-deoxybromotopsentin (192), Dercitin (193), Tryptanthrin (200), 
6-Cyano-5-methoxy-12-methylindolo [2, 3A] carbazole (211), Thiangazole (298), 
and Phenoxan (300). The binding ability against PLpro was screened through 
molecular docking, disclosing the favorable binding modes of six metabolites. 
ADMET studies expected molecules 28, 76, 94, 200, and 298 as the most favorable 
metabolites. Then, molecules 76, 94, and 298 were chosen through in silico 
toxicity studies. Finally, DFT studies were carried out on glycyrrhizoflavone 
(76) and indicated a high level of similarity in the molecular orbital analysis. 
The obtained data can be used in further in vitro and in vivo studies to examine 
and confirm the inhibitory effect of the filtered metabolites against PLpro and 
SARS-CoV-2.

Gelatin/chitosan solutions incorporated with betel leaf ethanolic extract (BLEE) 
at varying concentrations were electrospun on polylactic acid (PLA) films. 
Nanofibers with different morphologies, as indicated by scanning electron 
microscopy (SEM), were formed after solutions of gelatin/chitosan with and 
without BLEE were electrospun on PLA films at a constant voltage (25 kV) and a 
feed rate of 0.4 mL/h. Beaded gelatin/chitosan nanofibers (GC/NF) were found, 
particularly when high concentrations of BLEE were encapsulated. PLA films 
coated with GC/NF, and with BLEE added, showed antioxidant and antibacterial 
activities, which were augmented by increasing BLEE concentrations. Lower water 
vapor permeability and enhanced mechanical properties were achieved for 
GC/NF-coated PLA film (p < 0.05). Microbial growth and lipid oxidation of Nile 
tilapia slices packaged in PLA film coated with GC/NF containing 2% BLEE were 
more retarded than those packaged in low-density polyethylene (LDPE) bags over 
refrigerated storage of 12 days. Based on microbial limits, the shelf-life was 
escalated to 9 days, while the control had a shelf-life of 3 days. Therefore, 
such a novel film/bag could be a promising active packaging for foods.

Single-chain variable fragments (scFvs) have been recognized as promising agents 
in cancer therapy. However, short serum half-life of scFvs often limits clinical 
application. Fusion to albumin affibody (ABD) is an effective and convenient 
half-life extension strategy. Although one terminus of scFv is available for 
fusion of ABD, it is also frequently used for fusion of useful moieties such as 
small functional proteins, cytokines, or antibodies. Herein, we investigated the 
internal linker region for ABD fusion instead of terminal region, which was 
rarely explored before. We constructed two internally ABD-inserted anti-HER2 
4D5scFv (4D5-ABD) variants, which have short (4D5-S-ABD) and long (4D5-L-ABD) 
linker length respectively. The model structures of these 4D5scFv and 4D5-ABD 
variants predicted using the deep learning-based protein structure prediction 
program (AlphaFold2) revealed high similarity to either the original 4D5scFv or 
the ABD structure, implying that the functionality would be retained. Designed 
4D5-ABD variants were expressed in the bacterial expression system and 
characterized. Both 4D5-ABD variants showed anti-HER2 binding affinity 
comparable with 4D5scFv. Binding affinity of both 4D5-ABD variants against 
albumin was also comparable. In a pharmacokinetic study in mice, the 4D5-ABD 
variants showed a significantly prolonged half-life of 34 h, 114 times longer 
than that of 4D5scFv. In conclusion, we have developed a versatile scFv platform 
with enhanced pharmacokinetic profiles with an aid of deep learning-based 
structure prediction.

Heart failure (HF) is a progressively deteriorating medical condition that 
significantly reduces both the patients' life expectancy and quality of life. 
Even though real progress was made in the past decades in the discovery of novel 
pharmacological treatments for HF, the prevention of premature deaths has only 
been marginally alleviated. Despite the availability of a plethora of 
pharmaceutical approaches, proper management of HF is still challenging. Thus, a 
myriad of experimental and clinical studies focusing on the discovery of new and 
provocative underlying mechanisms of HF physiopathology pave the way for the 
development of novel HF therapeutic approaches. Furthermore, recent 
technological advances made possible the development of various interventional 
techniques and device-based approaches for the treatment of HF. Since many of 
these modern approaches interfere with various well-known pathological 
mechanisms in HF, they have a real ability to complement and or increase the 
efficiency of existing medications and thus improve the prognosis and survival 
rate of HF patients. Their promising and encouraging results reported to date 
compel the extension of heart failure treatment beyond the classical view. The 
aim of this review was to summarize modern approaches, new perspectives, and 
future directions for the treatment of HF.

Cis-regulatory elements of promoters are essential for gene regulation by 
transcription factors (TFs). However, the regulatory roles of nonpromoter 
regions, TFs, and epigenetic marks remain poorly understood in plants. In this 
study, we characterized the cis-regulatory regions of 53 TFs and 19 histone 
marks in 328 chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP-seq) datasets from Arabidopsis. 
The genome-wide maps indicated that both promoters and regions around the 
transcription termination sites of protein-coding genes recruit the most TFs. 
The maps also revealed a diverse of histone combinations. The analysis suggested 
that exons play critical roles in the regulation of non-coding genes. 
Additionally, comparative analysis between heat-stress-responsive and 
nonresponsive genes indicated that the genes with distinct functions also 
exhibited substantial differences in cis-regulatory regions, histone regulation, 
and topologically associating domain (TAD) boundary organization. By integrating 
multiple high-throughput sequencing datasets, this study generated regulatory 
models for protein-coding genes, non-coding genes, and TAD boundaries to explain 
the complexity of transcriptional regulation.

Proteostasis unbalance in prion diseases: Mechanisms of neurodegeneration and

Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs), or prion diseases, are 
progressive neurodegenerative disorders of the central nervous system that 
affect humans and animals as sporadic, inherited, and infectious forms. 
Similarly to Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders, any 
attempt to reduce TSEs' lethality or increase the life expectancy of affected 
individuals has been unsuccessful. Typically, the onset of symptoms anticipates 
the fatal outcome of less than 1 year, although it is believed to be the 
consequence of a decades-long process of neuronal death. The duration of the 
symptoms-free period represents by itself a major obstacle to carry out 
effective neuroprotective therapies. Prions, the infectious entities of TSEs, 
are composed of a protease-resistant protein named prion protein scrapie (PrPSc) 
from the prototypical TSE form that afflicts ovines. PrPSc misfolding from its 
physiological counterpart, cellular prion protein (PrPC), is the unifying 
pathogenic trait of all TSEs. PrPSc is resistant to intracellular turnover and 
undergoes amyloid-like fibrillation passing through the formation of soluble 
dimers and oligomers, which are likely the effective neurotoxic entities. The 
failure of PrPSc removal is a key pathogenic event that defines TSEs as 
proteopathies, likewise other neurodegenerative disorders, including 
Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's disease, characterized by alteration 
of proteostasis. Under physiological conditions, protein quality control, led by 
the ubiquitin-proteasome system, and macroautophagy clears cytoplasm from 
improperly folded, redundant, or aggregation-prone proteins. There is evidence 
that both of these crucial homeostatic pathways are impaired during the 
development of TSEs, although it is still unclear whether proteostasis 
alteration facilitates prion protein misfolding or, rather, PrPSc protease 
resistance hampers cytoplasmic protein quality control. This review is aimed to 
critically analyze the most recent advancements in the cause-effect correlation 
between PrPC misfolding and proteostasis alterations and to discuss the 
possibility that pharmacological restoring of ubiquitin-proteasomal competence 
and stimulation of autophagy could reduce the intracellular burden of PrPSc and 
ameliorate the severity of prion-associated neurodegeneration.

Exploring inequalities in life expectancy and lifespan variation by 
race/ethnicity and urbanicity in the United States: 1990 to 2019.

BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: Investigating trends in life expectancy and lifespan 
variation can highlight disproportionate mortality burdens among population 
subgroups. We examined inequalities in life expectancy and lifespan variation by 
race/ethnicity and by urbanicity in the US from 1990 to 2019.
METHODS: Using vital registration data for 322.0 million people in 3,141 
counties from the National Center for Health Statistics, we obtained life 
expectancy at birth and lifespan variation for 16 
race/ethnicity-gender-urbanicity combinations in six 5-year periods (1990-1994 
to 2015-2019). Race/ethnicity was categorized as Hispanic, and non-Hispanic 
White, Black, and Asian/Pacific Islander. Urbanicity was categorized as 
metropolitan vs nonmetropolitan areas, or in six further detailed 
categorizations. Life expectancy and lifespan variation (coefficient of 
variation) were computed using life tables.
RESULTS: In 2015-2019, residents in metropolitan areas had higher life 
expectancies than their nonmetropolitan counterparts (79.6 years compared to 
77.0 years). The widest inequality in life expectancy occurred between 
Asian/Pacific Islander women and Black men, with a 17.7-year gap for residents 
in metropolitan areas and a 16.9-year gap for residents in nonmetropolitan 
areas. Nonmetropolitan areas had greater dispersion around average age at death. 
Black individuals had the highest lifespan variations in both metropolitan and 
nonmetropolitan areas. Until the mid-2010s, life expectancy increased while 
lifespan variation decreased; however, recent trends show stagnation in life 
expectancy and increases in lifespan variation. Metropolitan-nonmetropolitan 
inequalities in both life expectancy and lifespan variation widened over time.
CONCLUSION: Despite previous improvements in longevity, life expectancy is now 
stagnating while lifespan variation is increasing. Our results highlight that 
early-life deaths (i.e., young- and middle-age mortality) disproportionately 
affect Black individuals, who not only live the shortest lifespans but also have 
the most variability with respect to age at death.

BACKGROUND: Esophageal cancer is a global health concern. Regularly updated data 
about the burden of esophageal cancer are essential for formulating specific 
public policies. We aimed to estimate the global, regional, and national burden 
and trends of esophageal cancer and its attributable risk factors from 1990 to 
2019, by age, sex and socio-demographic index (SDI).
METHODS: Data about the incidence, death, disability-adjusted life-years 
(DALYs), and age-standardized rates were collected from Global Burden of Disease 
study 2019. Estimated annual percentage changes were used to quantify the 
temporal trends of age-standardized rates. Moreover, the risk factors 
attributable to esophageal cancer deaths were also presented.
RESULTS: There were 534,563 incident cases and 498,067 deaths in 2019, 
contributing to 11,666,017 DALYs. The absolute numbers of incidence, death, and 
DALYs had increased from 1990 to 2019, contrasting with declined changes in 
their corresponding age-standardized rates. The burden of esophageal cancer 
varied across different regions and countries, and the age-standardized rates 
were negative with SDI. Almost half of the esophageal cancer was concentrated in 
China. Males accounted for most of the burden of esophageal cancer, and the 
onset age tended to be older. The death of esophageal cancer was primarily 
attributable to smoking, followed by alcohol use, high body mass index, diet low 
in fruits and diet low in vegetables.
CONCLUSION: The burden of esophageal cancer was heterogeneous across regions and 
countries by sex, age, and SDI, providing information for governments that may 
help to formulate more targeted policies.

BACKGROUND: There is a lack of in-depth analysis regarding the disease burden of 
childhood cancer in China. Indeed, this is the first time the topic has been 
addressed in detail. Drawing on population-based data for the past 30 years, 
this study systematically analyzes the composition and long-term trend of this 
disease burden in China.
METHODS: GBD 2019 contained population-based data from 1990 to 2019 and was 
prepared using Microsoft Excel 2016. We used AAPC and ARIMA models for trend 
analysis and prediction formulation.
RESULTS: In 2019, there were 45,601 new cases, 9,156 cancer deaths, and 782,530 
DALYs in China. From 1990 to 2019, leukemia, together with brain and CNS cancer, 
invariably ranked highest in terms of new cases, cancer deaths, and DALYs. 
Leukemia accounted for more than 50%, but decreased over time. By contrast, the 
proportions for brain and CNS cancer increased. There were significant decreases 
in the overall incidence, mortality, and DALY rates in China, but these were 
still higher than the corresponding global average levels. Considering all types 
of childhood cancer, the incidence rate of testicular cancer showed the biggest 
increase, and the mortality and DALY rates of leukemia showed the largest 
decrease. In terms of different age groups, the overall incidence rate of 
childhood cancers increased in 0 to 4 age group, but it decreased in 5 to 14 age 
groups. The overall mortality and DALY rates of childhood cancers decreased in 
all four age groups. Over the next 10 years, the overall incidence rate of 
childhood cancer will increase, but the overall mortality and DALY rates will 
decrease. The increase in malignant skin melanoma will comprise the largest rise 
in the incidence, while the decrease for leukemia will be the largest fall in 
the incidence, cancer deaths, and DALYs.
CONCLUSION: The disease burden of all childhood cancers in China remains highly 
serious, especially for certain types of cancer and certain age groups. China 
should focus more emphatically on the incidence of childhood cancer in future, 
and it must consistently strengthen investment in the relevant research and 
medical resources to reduce the disease burden in this field.

BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is a pandemic that is devastating the world right now 
quelling over 2.5 million people worldwide. Similarly, in India and its largest 
southern state Karnataka, the coronavirus is responsible for around 161,000 and 
12,449 deaths, respectively. These numbers capture the havoc caused by this 
novel coronavirus, but fail to discern the complete picture.
OBJECTIVES: Broadly, this study aimed to study the mortality, morbidity, and the 
economic issues inflicted by the COVID-19 in the state of Karnataka. 
Specifically, the study used publically available epidemiological data to study 
both mortality and morbidity by means of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). 
Furthermore, the study aimed at estimating the permanent losses to the state 
gross domestic product (SGDP) due to the pandemic.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Publicly available epidemiological data are used from 
selected sources and DALYs are computed. The permanent loss to the SGDP is 
estimated using the human capital approach.
RESULTS: The total DALYs for Karnataka are computed to be 22,506 of which 22,041 
correspond to mortality and remaining correspond to morbidity. Financially, 
Karnataka lost around 208 years of productive years of lives costing around ₹590 
million rupees to the SGDP.
CONCLUSIONS: It is found that major burden of COVID-19 during study period is 
due to mortality. Morbidity accounts for around 2% of the total DALYs. Males are 
the most affected by the mortality and also the morbidity. With respect to loss 
in productivity, the losses due to premature mortality of COVID-19 amounted to 
₹590 million.

Stereotactic body radiation therapy as an alternative to adrenalectomy for the 
treatment of pheochromocytomas in 8 dogs.

The objective of this report is to describe the use and outcome of stereotactic 
body radiation therapy (SBRT) for treatment of pheochromocytomas in 8 dogs. 
Pheochromocytomas are an uncommon but challenging tumour to manage. 
Adrenalectomy is the standard of care for treatment of pheochromocytomas in both 
animals and humans; however, unpredictable catecholamine secretion from the 
tumour and vascular and local invasion of the tumour and thrombi can pose 
life-threatening perioperative and anaesthetic risks. SBRT has been investigated 
as an alternative to adrenalectomy in human patients with pheochromocytomas. 
Eight dogs with clinical signs, an adrenal mass, and cytology and/or urine 
normetanephrine/creatinine ratios consistent with pheochromocytoma were treated 
with SBRT in lieu of adrenalectomy. Three dogs presented with acute hemoabdomen. 
Seven dogs had caval tumour invasion, 3 with extension into the right atrium. 
Following SBRT, all dogs had complete resolution of clinical signs and reduced 
urine normetanephrine/creatinine ratio and/or tumour size. No significant 
anaesthetic complications were encountered. Acute radiation toxicity was limited 
to grade I gastrointestinal signs in 3 dogs and resolved within 1-2 days of 
symptomatic therapy. Five of 8 dogs were alive at the time of follow up, with a 
median follow up time of 25.8 months. SBRT resulted in a favourable outcome and 
mitigated the life-threatening risks of adrenalectomy in these 8 dogs. SBRT may 
be a safe and effective alternative to adrenalectomy for pheochromocytomas in 
dogs with non-resectable tumours, or for owners averse to the risks of surgery.

INTRODUCTION: In the coming years, an increase in the number of cancer cases can 
be expected in Iceland. It is important to gain more insight into the 
experiences of the diagnostic- and treatment phase among those diagnosed with 
cancer to improve quality of life and life expectancy.
METHODS: The study included 4575 individuals diagnosed with cancer between 2015 
and 2019 in Iceland, 18 years or older at the time. Participants answered an 
on-line questionnaire once between 2020 and 2021.
RESULTS: A total of 1672 (37%) individuals responded to the questionnaire. The 
mean age at diagnosis was 59 years (±12). The majority of participants were 
informed on their cancer diagnosis during a doctor's appointment (67%), but a 
quarter (25%) received the information by telephone. A total of 77% of 
participants were satisfied with the diagnostic process, thereof relatively 
fewer women than men (73% vs. 83%) (p<0,001). Fewer of those who received the 
cancer diagnosis by telephone were pleased with the diagnostic process (62%) 
compared with those receiving information during a doctor's appointment (85%) 
(p<0,001). More women (58%) than men (33%) expressed the need for support 
regarding mental well-being from healthcare professionals during the diagnostic 
process (p<0.001). In 2015, 36% of participants started treatment more than 
month after diagnosis, compared with 51% in 2019. The need for various specific 
resources during treatment, e.g. physiotherapy, psychological services or 
nutritional counseling were regularly assessed among 20-30% of participants.
CONCLUSION: A quarter of respondents diagnosed with cancer received information 
about the diagnosis over the phone instead of an interview. There is a 
suggestion that the time from diagnosis to the start of cancer treatment is 
increasing. It is necessary to assess whether it is possible to support 
individuals with cancer better during the diagnostic- and treatment phase based 
on their individual needs.

The life histories of organisms are expressed as rates of development, 
reproduction, and survival. However, individuals may experience differential 
outcomes for the same set of rates. Such individual stochasticity generates 
variance around familiar mean measures of life history traits, such as life 
expectancy and the reproductive number R0. By writing life cycles as Markov 
chains, we calculate variance and other indices of variability for longevity, 
lifetime reproductive output (LRO), age at offspring production, and age at 
maturity for 83 animal and 332 plant populations from the Comadre and Compadre 
matrix databases. We find that the magnitude within and variability between 
populations in variance indices in LRO, especially, are surprisingly high. We 
furthermore use principal components analysis to assess how the inclusion of 
variance indices of different demographic outcomes affects life history 
constraints. We find that these indices, to a similar or greater degree than the 
mean, explain the variation in life history strategies among plants and animals.

Reconstruction of Quadriceps Function Using a Single Functional Gracilis Muscle 
Transfer With an Adductor Longus Nerve to Femoral Nerve Branch of the Rectus 
Femoris Nerve Transfer.

BACKGROUND: A femoral nerve injury may result in cutaneous sensory disturbances 
of the anteromedial thigh and complete paralysis of the quadriceps femoris 
muscles resulting in an inability to extend the knee. The traditional mainstay 
of treatment for femoral neuropathy is early physiotherapy, knee support 
devices, and pain control. Case reports have used the anterior division of the 
obturator nerve as a donor nerve to innervate the quadriceps femoris muscles; 
however, a second nerve transfer or nerve grafting is often required for 
improved outcomes. We suggest a novel technique of combining an innervated, 
pedicled gracilis transfer with an adductor longus to rectus femoris nerve 
transfer to restore the strength and stability of the quadriceps muscles.
METHODS: This is a case series describing the use of a pedicled gracilis muscle 
transposed into the rectus femoris position with a concomitant nerve transfer 
from the adductor longus nerve branch into the rectus femoris nerve branch to 
restore quadriceps function after iatrogenic injury (hip arthroplasty) and 
trauma (gunshot wound).
RESULTS: With electrodiagnostic confirmation of severe denervation of the 
quadriceps muscles and no evidence of elicitable motor units, 2 patients 
(average age, 47 years) underwent a quadriceps muscle reconstruction with a 
pedicled, innervated gracilis muscle and an adductor longus to recuts femoris 
nerve transfer. At 1 year follow-up, the patients achieved 4.5/5 British Medical 
Research Council full knee extension, a stable knee, and the ability to ambulate 
without an assistive aid.
CONCLUSIONS: The required amount of quadriceps strength necessary to maintain 
quality of life has not been accurately established. In the case of femoral 
neuropathy, we assumed that a nerve transfer alone and a gracilis muscle 
transfer alone would not provide enough stability and strength to restore 
quadriceps function. We believe that the restoration of the quadriceps function 
after femoral nerve injury can be achieved by combining an innervated, pedicled 
gracilis transfer with an adductor longus to rectus femoris nerve transfer with 
low morbidity and no donor defects.

BACKGROUND: An increase in health anxiety was observed during the COVID-19 
pandemic. However, due to physical distancing restrictions and a strained mental 
health system, people were unable to access support to manage health anxiety. 
Chatbots are emerging as an interactive means to deliver psychological 
interventions in a scalable manner and provide an opportunity for novel therapy 
delivery to large groups of people including those who might struggle to access 
traditional therapies.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this mixed methods pilot study was to investigate the 
feasibility, acceptability, engagement, and effectiveness of a cognitive 
behavioral therapy (CBT)-based chatbot (Otis) as an early health anxiety 
management intervention for adults in New Zealand during the COVID-19 pandemic.
METHODS: Users were asked to complete a 14-day program run by Otis, a primarily 
decision tree-based chatbot on Facebook Messenger. Health anxiety, general 
anxiety, intolerance of uncertainty, personal well-being, and quality of life 
were measured pre-intervention, postintervention, and at a 12-week follow-up. 
Paired samples t tests and 1-way ANOVAs were conducted to investigate the 
associated changes in the outcomes over time. Semistructured interviews and 
written responses in the self-report questionnaires and Facebook Messenger were 
thematically analyzed.
RESULTS: The trial was completed by 29 participants who provided outcome 
measures at both postintervention and follow-up. Although an average decrease in 
health anxiety did not reach significance at postintervention (P=.55) or 
follow-up (P=.08), qualitative analysis demonstrated that participants perceived 
benefiting from the intervention. Significant improvement in general anxiety, 
personal well-being, and quality of life was associated with the use of Otis at 
postintervention and follow-up. Anthropomorphism, Otis' appearance, and delivery 
of content facilitated the use of Otis. Technical difficulties and high 
performance and effort expectancy were, in contrast, barriers to acceptance and 
engagement of Otis.
CONCLUSIONS: Otis may be a feasible, acceptable, and engaging means of 
delivering CBT to improve anxiety management, quality of life, and personal 
well-being but might not significantly reduce health anxiety.

Are physical activity and nutrition linked to personality disorders? Health 
habits and personality disorders: A scoping review.

Individuals with personality disorders (PDs) have a decreased life expectancy 
compared with the general population in part due to physical illnesses. Many 
hypotheses have been suggested to explain those physical illnesses such as 
hormone imbalance, medication, lack of physical activity, and unhealthy diet. 
However, little is known about the relation between lifestyle and PDs. The 
purpose of this scoping review is to regroup the available information on this 
topic. We searched the literature up to February 2021 using four databases and 
found 21 articles analyzing the relation between lifestyle and PDs in 
observational studies including 153,081 participants from diverse populations 
going from general population to adults in psychiatric care. Most studies used 
measures of lifestyle as control variables or did not use lifestyle variables at 
all. Moreover, the instruments used to measure lifestyle variables lacked 
precision at best. Two studies demonstrated a relation between early 
malnutrition and further development of PDs, but those results may be influenced 
by confounding variables and cannot indicate a clear link between nutrition and 
personality disorder. The lack of solid evidence we observed is surprising, 
considering the multiple benefits individuals with PDs could get from a healthy 
lifestyle. More studies are needed to thoroughly analyze the impact of lifestyle 
on PDs and vice versa.

BACKGROUND: Insect endosymbionts are widespread in nature and known to play key 
roles in regulating host biology. As a secondary endosymbiont, bacteria in the 
genus Hamiltonella help cotton aphids (Aphis gossypii) defend against parasitism 
by parasitoid wasps, however, the potential negative impacts of these bacteria 
on cotton aphid biology remain largely unclear.
RESULTS: This study aims to evaluate the potential impacts of Hamiltonella on 
the growth and development of cotton aphids based on life table parameters and 
RNA sequencing. The results showed that infection with Hamiltonella resulted in 
smaller body type and lower body weight in aphids. Compared to the control 
group, there were significant differences in the finite and intrinsic rates of 
increase and mean generation time. Furthermore, the RNA sequencing data revealed 
that the genes related to energy synthesis and nutrient metabolism pathways were 
significantly downregulated and genes related to molting and nervous system 
pathways were significantly upregulated in the Hamiltonella population.
CONCLUSION: Our results confirm that Hamiltonella retarded the growth and 
development of cotton aphids accompanied by the downregulation of genes related 
to energy synthesis and nutrient metabolism, which provides new insights into 
aphid-symbiont interactions and may support the development of improved aphid 
management strategies. © 2022 Society of Chemical Industry.

PURPOSE: To investigate the clinical features, diagnosis, treatment and 
prognosis of otolaryngological extranodal RDD.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed on 16 patients who were 
initially diagnosed and treated with otolaryngological extranodal RDD in our 
hospital from January 2013 to January 2019.
RESULTS: There were 9 females and 7 males. The mean diagnostic age was 45.35. 
Nasal, laryngeal and otic RDD were, respectively, accounting for 56.25%, 31.25% 
and 12.5%. The median interval diagnostic time was individually 1, 0.5 and 
0.2 year for nasal, laryngeal and otic RDD. The most common symptoms were 
separately progressive nasal congestion, dyspnea, otorrhea in nasal, laryngeal 
and otic RDD. 13 had cervical lymph node swelling on MRI. Surgery or 
postoperative radiotherapy were conformed. In the end, 14 patients with RDD
