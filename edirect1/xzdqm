RESULTS: Costs for the index procedural hospitalisation were £18 781, of which 
£16 218 were for the TMVr device. Over 2-year follow-up, TMVr reduced subsequent 
costs compared with GRMT (£10 944 vs £14 932, p=0.006), driven mainly by 
reductions in heart failure hospitalisations; nonetheless, total 2-year costs 
remained higher with TMVr (£29 165 vs £14 932, p<0.001). When survival, health 
utilities and costs were projected over a lifetime, TMVr was projected to 
increase life expectancy by 1.57 years and quality-adjusted life expectancy by 
1.12 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) at an incremental cost of £21 980, 
resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of £23 270 per QALY 
gained (after discounting). If the benefits of TMVr observed in the first 
2 years were maintained without attenuation, the ICER improved to £12 494 per 
QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: For patients with HFrEF and severe secondary mitral regurgitation 
similar to those enrolled in COAPT, TMVr increases life expectancy and 
quality-adjusted life expectancy compared with GRMT at an ICER that represents 
good value from an NHS perspective.

OBJECTIVES: Childhood maltreatment, also referred as childhood trauma, increases 
the severity of bipolar disorders (BD). Childhood maltreatment has been 
associated with more frequent mood recurrences, however, mostly in retrospective 
studies. Since scarce, further prospective studies are required to identify 
whether childhood maltreatment may be associated with the time to recurrence in 
BD.
METHODS: Individuals with BD (N = 2008) were assessed clinically and for 
childhood maltreatment at baseline, and followed up for two years. The 
cumulative probability of mood recurrence over time was estimated with the 
Turnbull's extension of the Kaplan-Meier analysis for interval-censored data, 
including childhood maltreatment as a whole, and then maltreatment subtypes as 
predictors. Analyses were adjusted for potential confounding factors.
RESULTS: The median duration of follow-up was 22.3 months (IQR:12.0-24.8). 
Univariable analyses showed associations between childhood maltreatment, in 
particular all types of abuses (emotional, physical, and sexual) or emotional 
neglect, and a shorter time to recurrence (all p < 0.001). When including 
potential confounders into the multivariable models, the time to mood recurrence 
was associated with multiple/severe childhood maltreatment (i.e., total score 
above the 75th percentile) (HR = 1.32 95%CI (1.11-1.57), p = 0.002), and more 
specifically with moderate/severe physical abuse (HR = 1.44 95%CI(1.21-1.73), 
p < 0.0001). Living alone, lifetime anxiety disorders, lifetime number of mood 
episodes, baseline depressive and (hypo)manic symptoms, and baseline use of 
atypical antipsychotics were also associated with the time to recurrence.
CONCLUSIONS: In addition to typical predictors of mood recurrences, an exposure 
to multiple/severe forms of childhood maltreatment, and more specifically to 
moderate to severe physical abuse, may increase the risk for a mood recurrence 
in BD. This leads to the recommendations of more scrutiny and denser follow-up 
of the individuals having been exposed to such early-life stressors.

with anxiety symptoms: A randomized controlled trial.

BACKGROUND: A previous randomized controlled trial in older adults with anxiety 
symptoms found no differences between a brief blended Acceptance and Commitment 
Therapy (ACT) intervention and brief face-to-face Cognitive Behavior Therapy 
(CBT) regarding anxiety symptom severity at posttreatment and 12-month 
follow-up. A health-economic evaluation comparing these interventions has not 
yet been conducted.
OBJECTIVE: This study examined the one-year cost-effectiveness and cost-utility 
of blended ACT compared to face-to-face CBT for older adults with anxiety 
symptoms.
METHODS: The economic evaluation was embedded in a randomized controlled trial 
comparing blended ACT to CBT in 314 older adults with mild to moderately severe 
anxiety symptoms. Data were collected at baseline and 3, 6 and 12 months post 
baseline. For the cost-effectiveness analysis, treatment response was defined as 
a reliable improvement in anxiety symptom severity (measured with the 
Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7) between baseline and 12-month follow-up. To 
assess cost-utility, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were computed using 
EuroQol-5 Dimensions-5 Levels-5 utility scores. Analyses took the societal 
perspective, including both healthcare costs and productivity costs. Incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated using 2500 bootstraps of seemingly 
unrelated regression equations of costs and effects. Sensitivity analyses were 
performed to assess the robustness of the findings.
RESULTS: Differences between the blended ACT group and CBT group in treatment 
response and QALYs were statistically insignificant and clinically irrelevant. 
The ACT intervention was associated with an average per-participant cost 
reduction of €466 ($593) compared to CBT, which resulted from lower productivity 
costs in the blended ACT group. From a healthcare perspective, the ACT 
intervention was associated with higher costs (by €71 ($90)) than CBT.
CONCLUSIONS: The results do not indicate that from a health-economic perspective 
blended ACT should be preferred over CBT in the treatment of older adults with 
anxiety symptoms. The findings support a model of shared decision making, where 
clinicians and patients collaboratively decide on the preferred intervention, 
based on ethical-medical, practical and personal considerations.

OBJECTIVE: Expert evaluation of minimally invasive techniques in the diagnostic 
algorithm of pathological processes of the oral mucosa.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Fluorescence stomatoscopy of the oral mucosa of 1520 
patients aged 18-65 years with analysis of color code of optical images was 
carried out. The nature of the disease was established by liquid cytology. PCR 
diagnostics was performed to detect oral-potential disorders provoked by human 
papillomavirus and Epstein-Barr virus.
RESULTS: Analysis of optical images of the normal and pathologically affected 
oral mucosa allows determining the possibilities of the technique to detect a 
hidden pathological process at the preclinical level. The results of liquid 
cytology in each case confirm the nature and depth of the pathological process. 
PCR diagnostics determines the presence of risk factors (Epstein-Barr virus, 
human papilloma virus 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59), 
contributing to the malignant transformation.
CONCLUSIONS: A comprehensive examination of the oral mucosa using 
clinical-laboratory methods of visualizing pathological processes contributes to 
their early diagnosis, reduces the risk of advanced cases of oncopathology and 
allows extending life expectancy.

Globally, 43 million people are living with HIV, 90% in developing countries. 
Increasing life expectancy with combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) 
results in chronic complications, including HIV-associated neurocognitive 
disorders (HAND) and eye diseases. HAND screening is currently challenging. Our 
aim was to evaluate clinical utility of retinopathy as a screening measure of 
HAND in older cART-treated individuals in Tanzania and feasibility of 
smartphone-based retinal screening in this low-resource setting. A 
cross-sectional systematic sample aged ≥ 50-years attending routine HIV 
follow-up in Tanzania were comprehensively assessed for HAND by American Academy 
of Neurology criteria and received ophthalmic assessment including 
smartphone-based retinal imaging. HAND and ophthalmic assessments were 
independent and blinded. Diagnostic accuracy was evaluated by AUROC curves. Of 
129 individuals assessed, 69.8% were visually impaired. Thirteen had 
retinopathy. HAND prevalence was 66.7%. Retinopathy was significantly associated 
with HAND but HIV-disease factors (CD4, viral load) were not. Diagnostic 
accuracy of retinopathy for HAND was poor (AUROC 0.545-0.617) but specificity 
and positive predictive value were high. We conclude that ocular pathology and 
HAND appear highly prevalent in this low-resource setting. Although retinal 
screening cannot be used alone identify HAND, prioritization of individuals with 
abnormal retinal screening is a potential strategy in low-resource settings.

In older adults, functional decline, such as frailty and the need for nursing 
care, has a significant impact on quality of daily life (QOL) and life 
expectancy, and this is also true for older patients with hypertension. It has 
been shown that hypertensive patients with frailty or those in need of nursing 
care might be disadvantaged by conventional hypertension treatment according to 
the guidelines, while it is also known that inappropriate antihypertensive 
treatment may cause functional impairment. Therefore, in the management of older 
hypertensive patients, it is important to understand a patient's condition using 
functional assessments, such as a comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) or 
frailty assessments, and it is strongly recommended to determine the 
antihypertensive target and select the antihypertensive treatment according to 
the degree of functional impairment or frailty.

As life expectancy increases, Osteoarthritis (OA) is becoming a more frequently 
seen chronic joint disease. The main characteristics of OA are loss of articular 
cartilage, subchondral bone sclerosis, and synovial inflammation. Baicalein 
(Bai), a traditional Chinese medicine extracted from Scutellaria baicalensis 
Georgi, has been demonstrated to exert notable anti-inflammatory effects in 
previous studies, suggesting its potential effect in the treatment of OA. In 
this study, we first predicted the action targets of Bai, mapped target genes 
related to OA, identified potential anti-OA targets for Bai, performed gene 
ontology (GO) enrichment, and KEGG signaling pathway analyses of the action 
targets, and analyzed the molecular docking of key Bai targets. Additionally, 
the effect and potential mechanism of Bai against OA were verified in mouse knee 
OA models induced by destabilized medial meniscus (DMM) surgery. GO and KEGG 
analyses showed that 19 anti-OA targets were mainly involved in the response to 
oxidative stress, the response to hypoxia and apoptosis, and the PI3K-Akt and 
p53 signaling pathways. Molecular docking results indicated that BAX, BCL 2, and 
Caspase 3 enriched in the apoptotic signaling pathway have high binding affinity 
with Bai. Validation experiments showed that Bai can significantly attenuate the 
loss of articular cartilage (OARSI score), suppress synovial inflammation 
(synovitis score), and ameliorate subchondral bone resorption measured by 
micro-CT. In addition, Bai notably inhibited the expression of apoptosis-related 
proteins in articular cartilage (BAX, BCL 2, and Caspase 3). By combining 
network pharmacology with experimental validation, our study identifies and 
verifies the importance of the apoptotic signaling pathway in the treatment of 
OA by Bai. Bai may have promising application and potential therapeutic value in 
OA treatment.

Objective To compare the cost-effectiveness of the combination of pembrolizumab 
and chemotherapy (Pembro+Chemo) versus pembrolizumab monotherapy (Pembro) as the 
first-line treatment for metastatic non-squamous and squamous non-small-cell 
lung cancer (NSCLC) with PD-L1expression ≥50%, respectively, from a US health 
care perspective. Material and Methods A comprehensive Makrov model were 
designed to compare the health costs and outcomes associated with first-line 
Pembro+Chemo and first-line Pembro over a 20-years time horizon. Health states 
consisted of three main states: progression-free survival (PFS), progressive 
disease (PD) and death, among which the PFS health state was divided into two 
substates: PFS while receiving first-line therapy and PFS with discontinued 
first-line therapy. Two scenario analyses were performed to explore satisfactory 
long-term survival modeling. Results In base case analysis, for non-squamous 
NSCLC patients, Pembro+Chemo was associated with a significantly longer life 
expectancy [3.24 vs 2.16 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs)] and a 
substantially greater healthcare cost ($341,237 vs $159,055) compared with 
Pembro, resulting in an ICER of $169,335/QALY; for squamous NSCLC patients, 
Pembro+Chemo was associated with a slightly extended life expectancy of 0.22 
QALYs and a marginal incremental cost of $3,449 compared with Pembro, resulting 
in an ICER of $15,613/QALY. Our results were particularly sensitive to 
parameters that determine QALYs. The first scenario analysis yielded lower ICERs 
than our base case results. The second scenario analysis founded Pembro+Chemo 
was dominated by Pembro. Conclusion For metastatic non-squamous NSCLC patients 
with PD-L1 expression ≥50%, first-line Pembro+Chemo was not cost-effective when 
compared with first-line Pembro. In contrast, for the squamous NSCLC patient 
population, our results supported the first-line Pembro+Chemo as a 
cost-effective treatment. Although there are multiple approaches that are used 
for extrapolating long-term survival, the optimal method has yet to be 
determined.

To characterize cultivar variations in hormonal regulation of the transition 
between pattern-triggered immunity (PTI) and effector-triggered immunity or 
susceptibility (ETI or ETS), the responses of resistance (R-) genes, hydrogen 
peroxide, and proline metabolism in two Brassica napus cultivars to contrasting 
disease susceptibility (resistant cv. Capitol vs. susceptible cv. Mosa) were 
interpreted as being linked to those of endogenous hormonal levels and signaling 
genes based on a time course of disease symptom development. Disease symptoms 
caused by the Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris (Xcc) infections were much 
more developed in cv. Mosa than in cv. Capitol, as shown by an earlier 
appearance (at 3 days postinoculation [3 DPI]) and larger V-shaped necrosis 
lesions (at 9-15 DPI) in cv. Mosa. The cultivar variations in the R-genes, 
hormone status, and proline metabolism were found in two different phases (early 
[0-3 DPI] and later [9-15 DPI]). In the early phase, Xcc significantly 
upregulated PTI-related cytoplasmic kinase (Botrytis-induced kinase-1 [BIK1]) 
expression (+6.3-fold) with salicylic acid (SA) accumulation in cv. Capitol, 
while relatively less (+2.6-fold) with highly increased jasmonic acid (JA) level 
in cv. Mosa. The Xcc-responsive proline accumulation in both cultivars was 
similar to upregulated expression of proline synthesis-related genes (P5CS2 and 
P5CR). During the later phase in cv. Capitol, Xcc-responsive upregulation of 
ZAR1 (a coiled-coil-nucleotide binding site-leucine-rich repeat [CC-NB-LRR-type 
R-gene]) was concomitant with a gradual increase in JA levels without additional 
proline accumulation. However, in cv. Mosa, upregulation of TAO1 (a 
toll/interleukin-1 receptor-nucleotide binding site-leucine-rich repeat 
[TIR-NB-LRR-type R-gene]) was consistent with an increase in SA and abscisic 
acid (ABA) levels and resulted in an antagonistic depression of JA, which led to 
a proline accumulation. These results indicate that Xcc-induced BIK1- and 
ZAR1-mediated JA signaling interactions provide resistance and confirm ETI, 
whereas BIK1- and TAO1-enhanced SA- and/or ABA-mediated proline accumulation is 
associated with disease susceptibility (ETS).

BACKGROUND: Cranial base chordomas are typically indolent and usually appear as 
encapsulated tumors. They slowly grow by infiltrating the bone, along with the 
lines of least resistance. Due to its relationship with important neurovascular 
structures, skull base chordoma surgery is challenging.
OBJECTIVE: The usefulness of intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging (IO-MRI) 
in achieving the goal of surgery, is evaluated in this study.
METHODS: Between March 2018 and March 2020, 42 patients were operated on for 
resection of skull base chordomas in our institution. All of them were operated 
on under IO-MRI. Patients were analyzed retrospectively for identifying common 
residue locations, complications and early post-operative outcomes.
RESULTS: In 22 patients (52,4%) gross total resection was achieved according to 
the final IO-MRI. In 20 patients (47,6%) complete tumor removal was not possible 
because of extension to the petrous bone (8 patients), pontocerebellar angle (6 
patients), prepontine cistern (4 patients), temporobasal (1 patient), cervical 
axis (1 patient). In 13 patients, the surgery was continued after the first 
IO-MRI control was performed, which showed a resectable residual tumor. 7 of 
these patients achieved total resection according to the second IO-MRI, in the 
other 6 patients all efforts were made to ensure maximal resection of the tumor 
as much as possible without morbidity. Repeated IO-MRI helped achieve gross 
total resection in 7 patients (53.8%).
CONCLUSIONS: Our study proves that the use of IO-MRI is a safe method that 
provides the opportunity to show the degree of resection in skull base chordomas 
and to evaluate the volume and location of the residual tumor intraoperatively. 
Hence IO-MRI can improve the life expectancy of patients because it provides an 
opportunity for both gross total resection and maximal safe resection in cases 
where total resection is not possible.

Communications between clinicians and patients with idiopathic pulmonary 
fibrosis (IPF) have the potential to be challenging. The variable course and 
poor prognosis of IPF complicate discussions around life expectancy but should 
not prevent clinicians from having meaningful conversations about patients' 
fears and needs, while acknowledging uncertainties. Patients want information 
about the course of their disease and management options, but the provision of 
information needs to be individualised to the needs and preferences of the 
patient. Communication from clinicians should be empathetic and take account of 
the patient's perceptions and concerns. Models, tools and protocols are 
available that can help clinicians to improve their interactions with patients. 
In this article, we consider the difficulties inherent in discussions with 
patients with IPF and their loved ones, and how clinicians might communicate 
with patients more effectively, from breaking the news about the diagnosis to 
providing support throughout the course of the disease.

Inhibitory control is a critical part of executive function and an important 
cognitive process in daily life. It is currently unclear how to optimally 
improve inhibitory control ability through behavior training and other 
interventions. Here, we explored the factors that influence inhibition control 
training in two experiments, focusing on the gains and transfer effects of 
training. Experiments 1 and 2 investigated the effects of anodal transcranial 
direct current stimulation (tDCS) over the pre-supplementary motor area and an 
increase in training duration on the training effect for inhibitory control, 
respectively, as well as the transfer effects when participants completed the 
Stroop and directed forgetting tasks. The results showed a stable training 
effect in relation to inhibitory control and a transfer effect for the Stroop 
task. Anodal tDCS in the pre-supplementary motor area could effectively improve 
inhibitory control ability, but not further enhance the training effect for 
inhibitory control. Moreover, increasing the training duration did not enhance 
the training effect for inhibitory control. The addition of tDCS and the 
extension of training duration failed to enhance the training effect, indicating 
that there may be a limitation of improvement in inhibitory control. The 
findings provide evidence regarding the further intervention effects of 
behavioral training and tDCS.

Several lifestyle factors have been linked to risk for heart failure (HF) and 
premature mortality. The aim of this study was to estimate the impact of a 
healthy lifestyle on life expectancy with and without HF among men and women 
from a general population. This study was performed among 6113 participants 
(mean age 65.8 ± 9.7 years; 58.9% women) from the Rotterdam Study, a large 
prospective population-based cohort study. A continuous lifestyle score was 
created based on five lifestyle factors: smoking status, alcohol consumption, 
diet quality, physical activity and weight status (assessed 1995-2008). The 
lifestyle score was categorized into three levels: unhealthy (reference), 
intermediate and healthy. Gompertz regression and multistate life tables were 
used to estimate the effects of lifestyle on life expectancy with and without HF 
in men and women separately at ages 45, 65 and 85 years (follow-up until 2016). 
During an average follow-up of 11.3 years, 699 incident HF events and 2146 
deaths occurred. At the age of 45 years, men in the healthy lifestyle category 
had a 4.4 (95% CI: 4.1-4.7) years longer total life expectancy than men in the 
unhealthy lifestyle category, and a 4.8 (95% CI: 4.4-5.1) years longer life 
expectancy free of HF. Among women, the difference in total life-expectancy at 
the age of 45 years was 3.4 (95% CI: 3.2-3.5) years and was 3.4 (95% CI: 
3.3-3.6) years longer for life expectancy without HF. This effect persisted also 
at older ages. An overall healthy lifestyle can have a positive impact on total 
life expectancy and life expectancy free of HF.

BACKGROUND: Prognostic information is key to shared decision-making, 
particularly in life-limiting illness like advanced chronic kidney disease 
(CKD).
OBJECTIVE: To understand the prognostic information preferences expressed by 
older patients with CKD.
DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: Qualitative study of 28 consecutively enrolled patients 
over 65 years of age with non-dialysis dependent CKD stages 3b-5, receiving care 
in a multi-disciplinary CKD clinic.
APPROACH: Semi-structured telephone or in-person interviews to explore patients' 
preference for and perceived value of individualized prognostic information. 
Interviews were analyzed using inductive content analysis.
KEY RESULTS: We completed interviews with 28 patients (77.7 ± SD 6.8 years, 69% 
men). Patients varied in their preference for prognostic information and more 
were interested in their risk of progression to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) 
than in life expectancy. Many conflated ESKD risk with risk of death, perceiving 
a binary choice between dialysis and quick decline and death. Patients expressed 
that prognostic information would allow them to plan, take care of important 
business, and think about their treatment options. Patients were accepting of 
prognostic uncertainty and imagined leveraging it to nurture hope or motivate 
them to better manage risk factors. They endorsed the desire to receive 
prognosis of life expectancy even though it may be hard to accept or difficult 
to talk about but worried it could create helplessness for other patients in 
their situation.
CONCLUSION: Most, but not all, patients were interested in prognostic 
information and could see its value in motivating behavior change and allowing 
planning. Some patients expressed concern that information on life expectancy 
might cause depression and hopelessness. Therefore, prognostic information is 
most appropriate as part of a clinical conversation that fosters shared 
decision-making and helps patients consider treatment risks, benefits, and 
burdens in context of their lives.

The spatial heterogeneity and influence factors of public lifespan have been 
reported worldwide at the national level or typical longevous areas. However, 
few sub-national studies considering the living environment and socio-economic 
level together have been explored in the imbalanced developed region with a huge 
population base and deteriorated air quality. In this paper, spatial 
heterogeneity of lifespan integrating environment and socio-economic influence 
factors was investigated in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region of China 
using geographically weighted regression (GWR). Five indicators were constructed 
to determine the lifespan based on the three national censuses (1990-2010) in 
the BTH region. The results showed that the areas with higher CH (centenarians 
per 100,000 inhabitants) and centenarity index (CI) exhibited changing 
distribution in the BTH region, whereas those with lower CH and CI and extreme 
value of the ultra-octogenarian index (UOI) and LI (> 90/ > 65) maintained a 
relatively stable feature through time. But as lifespan indicators increase 
overall, the differences between the counties/districts widen. Furthermore, 
remarkable spatial heterogeneity was detected for the associations between the 
significant environmental and socio-economic variables and lifespan indicators. 
Although the natural geographic condition (altitude) still exhibited a negative 
influence on the longevity of the population, the socio-economic factors (GDPpc 
and income level) showed a more dominant influence on the extension of the 
elderly and longevity population. Correspondingly, the widened unbalance of 
population lifespan (UOI, LI, CH) was considered closely related to the 
socio-economic polarization, and the adverse effects of air pollution on life 
expectancy at birth (LEB) have also emerged. To further improve the overall 
lifespan level and narrow the lifespan gap in the BTH region, future work on 
cleaner air and more balanced development is still needed.

OBJECTIVE: To increase the clinical awareness of the need for genetic evaluation 
for congenital myotonic dystrophy (CDM1) in cases of fetal akinesia sequence and 
idiopathic polyhydramnios.
METHODS: Retrospective case review.
RESULTS: A 27 y.o. G1P0 with no significant family history presented for 
ultrasound at 25 weeks gestation. Notable findings included lack of extension of 
the fetal arms and legs with bilateral talipes consistent with fetal akinesia 
sequence. Polyhydramnios with an amniotic fluid index of 32.2 cm was also 
present. Amniotic fluid obtained by amniocentesis was sent for chromosomal 
microarray and a next generation sequencing fetal akinesia panel which both 
returned normal. The patient underwent serial amnioreductions for recurrent 
severe polyhydramnios with removal of a total of 9.3 L. Further amniotic fluid 
testing for CDM1 identified >200 repeats in one copy of the fetal DMPK gene, 
consistent with a diagnosis of CDM1. The patient was delivered at 35 weeks 
gestation and neonatal demise occurred on the second day of life.
CONCLUSION: Congenital myotonic dystrophy should be a consideration for cases of 
severe polyhydramnios identified by ultrasound. Myotonic dystrophy is detected 
using PCR and southern blot and is not typically included on next generation 
sequencing (NGS) panels that test for similar conditions. Clinicians should 
consider more specialized genetic testing than microarray and NGS in these 
cases.

Forefoot and toes are prominent regions for locomotion and individual 
metatarsophalangeal joint (MTPJ) stiffness may be linked to jump take-off 
mechanics and performances. However, little is known about the relationships 
between MTPJ stiffness and take-off related variables. This study examined the 
relationship between individual MTPJ stiffness and biomechanical variables under 
various vertical countermovement jumps (CMJ) conditions. We measured MTPJ 
stiffness on 21 male university basketball players and then asked them to 
perform jumps under single, consecutive and running CMJ conditions. Pearson's 
correlation coefficient was employed to examine the relationships between MTP 
passive stiffness and each jumping performance, ground reaction force (GRF) and 
joint kinematic and kinetic variables. The results indicated that MTPJ stiffness 
significantly correlated with maximum jump height (r = 0.49, moderate), peak 
take-off velocity (r = 0.47, moderate), peak take-off ankle plantarflexion 
moment (r = 0.68, strong), peak dorsiflexion moment (r = 0.60, strong) and peak 
take-off ankle power (r = 0.44, moderate) in consecutive CMJ. Only a moderate 
correlation between MTPJ stiffness and peak MTPJ extension take-off velocity (r 
= -0.46, moderate) was determined in a single CMJ. There were no significant 
correlations found in running CMJ conditions. These findings imply that higher 
MTPJ stiffness of participants was related to improved jump performances in 
consecutive jumps.

BACKGROUND: The current international consensus report indicated that all 
Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori)-positive patients should be treated. This study 
aimed to evaluate the long-term effects and benefits of H. pylori eradication on 
the gastric mucosa in the elderly population.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study with 311 individuals aged ≥60 
years, including 83 with persistent H. pylori infection (persistent group), 128 
with successful H. pylori eradication (eradicated group), and 100 without H. 
pylori infection (control group). The results of endoscopy and mucosal histology 
were investigated at baseline and followed up for 5 and 10 years.
RESULTS: In the 5 to 10-year follow-up, there was a significant difference in 
the atrophy score among the three groups (P < 0.001); however, no significant 
difference was observed in the intestinal metaplasia (IM) score (P > 0.05). 
There was no significant difference in the cumulative incidence of gastric 
neoplastic lesion (GNL) between the eradicated and persistent groups during the 
5 to 10-year follow-up period (P > 0.05). The baseline IM score of patients with 
GNL was significantly higher than that of those without GNL in the eradicated 
and control groups (P < 0.05). In all patients with GNL, the mean interval time 
between baseline and diagnosis of GLN was more than 6 years. The severity of 
baseline mucosal IM (odds ratio: OR 3.092, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 
1.690-5.655, P < 0.001) and H. pylori infection (OR: 2.413, 95%CI: 1.019-5.712, 
P = 0.045) significantly increased the risk for GNL.
CONCLUSIONS: Older patients with a life expectancy of less than 5 to 10 years, 
especially those with moderate to severe gastric mucosal IM, may not benefit
