BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: For 1.3 billion population in India, there are only 
scarce reports on disability of epilepsy using disability-adjusted life year 
(DALY) as a measure. Our objective was to estimate DALY using real-life data 
over a period of time for a cohort of people with epilepsy (PWE) admitted to an 
Epilepsy Monitoring Unit (EMU) of a tertiary care epilepsy center.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: : We ascertained survival status as on December 31, 2016 
of all eligible admissions to the EMU between 01/01/2005 and 12/31/2015. We 
examined the medical records of randomly selected 200 of the 1970 survivors and 
all the expired PWE (n = 40) for clinical characteristics. The cumulative 
real-life DALY (cr-DALY) for individual was calculated as the sum of the years 
lost to disability (YLD) and the years of life lost (YLL). Annual 
population-based DALY (p-DALY) was estimated from the cr-DALY, total 
patient-years of follow-up, and regional population prevalence.
RESULTS: The cr-DALY per PWE was 17.63 (generalized seizures only). The cr-DALY 
increased by 23.7% when all seizure types were considered (23.12). PWE with 
epilepsy onset <10 years of age, focal epilepsy (particularly, extratemporal 
lobe epilepsy), and premature death had significantly higher cr-DALY. Those who 
underwent surgery for epilepsy or achieved remission had significantly lower 
cr-DALY. The computed p-DALY was 583/1,00,000 population (generalized epilepsy 
contributed 165/1,00,000 population; focal epilepsy contributed 418/1,00,000 
population).
CONCLUSION: Our study had identified, for the first time, several determinants 
that reduced DALY significantly. Real-life DALY, rather than prevalence-based 
DALY, captures the cumulative disability of affected individuals. Epilepsy leads 
to loss of 23 years of disability-adjusted life span for the affected person. 
This can be extrapolated to substantial economic benefits.

'Seolgaeng', an opaque-endosperm rice (Oryza sativa) mutant, is used to prepare 
high-quality dry-milled rice flour. The mutation causing its opaque-endosperm 
phenotype was unknown. Map-based cloning identified a missense mutation in the 
gene FRUCTOSE-6-PHOSPHATE 2-KINASE/FRUCTOSE-2,6-BISPHOSPHATASE 2 (OsF2KP2) in 
Seolgaeng. Transfer DNA insertion and clustered regularly interspaced short 
palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated nuclease 9 (Cas9)-induced f2kp2 
mutants exhibited opaque endosperm. Rice harbors another F2KP gene, OsF2KP1. 
CRISPR/Cas9-induced double mutants of OsF2KP1 and OsF2KP2 (f2kp-d) possessed 
more opaque endosperm compared to f2kp2 single mutants, whereas the endosperm of 
the f2kp1 single mutant was normal. Grain hardness and damaged starch content 
were significantly reduced in f2kp2 mutants compared to the wild type and f2kp1. 
Amylose content was lower than normal in f2kp2 mutants but not f2kp1. Grain 
hardness and amylose content were much lower in f2kp-d than in f2kp2. Starch 
polymerization analysis revealed altered amylopectin structure in f2kp2 and 
f2kp-d mutants. F2KP activity was lower in f2kp2 and much lower in the double 
mutants when compared to the wild types, but f2kp1 showed no significant 
difference. In coleoptiles, hypoxia induced OsF2KP2 expression but downregulated 
OsF2KP1. These results suggest that OsF2KP2 functions as the main F2KP isoform 
in endosperm experiencing hypoxia, but OsF2KP1 may partially compensate for the 
absence of OsF2KP2. We propose that F2KP has a crucial role in inorganic 
pyrophosphate-utilizing energy metabolism for starch biosynthesis in rice 
endosperm.

Here, we present and release the Global Rainfall Erosivity Database (GloREDa), a 
multi-source platform containing rainfall erosivity values for almost 4000 
stations globally. The database was compiled through a global collaboration 
between a network of researchers, meteorological services and environmental 
organisations from 65 countries. GloREDa is the first open access database of 
rainfall erosivity (R-factor) based on hourly and sub-hourly rainfall records at 
a global scale. This database is now stored and accessible for download in the 
long-term European Soil Data Centre (ESDAC) repository of the European 
Commission's Joint Research Centre. This will ensure the further development of 
the database with insertions of new records, maintenance of the data and 
provision of a helpdesk. In addition to the annual erosivity data, this release 
also includes the mean monthly erosivity data for 94% of the GloREDa stations. 
Based on these mean monthly R-factor values, we predict the global monthly 
erosivity datasets at 1 km resolution using the ensemble machine learning 
approach (ML) as implemented in the mlr package for R. The produced monthly 
raster data (GeoTIFF format) may be useful for soil erosion prediction 
modelling, sediment distribution analysis, climate change predictions, flood, 
and natural disaster assessments and can be valuable inputs for Land and Earth 
Systems modelling.

INTRODUCTION: It is well established that starting antiretroviral therapy (ART) 
increases a patient's life expectancy among HIV-positive individuals. 
Considering the HIV pandemic, the major concern is initiation of ARTs to the 
large segment of HIV infected population, not adverse events from immune 
restoration. The prevalence of HIV-associated immune reconstitution inflammatory 
syndrome (IRIS) is poorly estimated due to Africa's underdeveloped 
infrastructure, particularly in Eastern Africa. Therefore, this study compiled 
data regarding the magnitude and associated factors of IRIS in the context of 
Eastern Africa.
METHODS: The electronic databases such as Google Scholar, PubMed, Web of 
Science, and free Google access were searched till 5 June 2021, and the search 
was lastly updated on 30 June 2022 for studies of interest. The pooled 
prevalence, and associated factors with a 95% confidence interval were estimated 
using the random effects model. The I2 and Egger's tests were used for 
heterogeneity and publication bias assessment, respectively.
RESULTS: The development of HIV-associated IRIS in Eastern Africa was estimated 
to be 18.18% (95% CI 13.30-23.06) in the current review. The two most common 
predictors of IRIS associated with Eastern Africa were the lower pre-ART CD4 
T-cell count of 50 cells/μl and the low baseline body mass index level. 
Therefore, attention should be focused on the early detection and care of 
HIV-associated IRIS to reduce the morbidity and death caused by IRIS.

Increase in life expectancy has led to increased number of octogenarian and 
nonagenarians population. These old people have increased chances of developing 
skin tumours like slow growing basal cell carcinoma on the sun exposed parts of 
body. Many a times surgeons all over the world are bit conservative in managing 
these elderly patients and compromise on cosmetic aspects due to very advanced 
age of these patients. This report is about an 87-year-old female with BCC of 
nasal dorsum who underwent a major surgical procedure to maintain facial 
aesthetics.

INTRODUCTION: Smoking-related diseases are major contributors to disability and 
shorter life expectancy among opioid-dependent patients. Smoking prevalence is 
considerably higher for opioid-dependent persons than among the general 
population, and only a minority quit smoking in treatment settings. Studies show 
that pharmacological smoking cessation interventions have modest success rates. 
This study aimed to investigate patients' receiving opioid agonist therapy 
perspectives on factors affecting behavior and decisions related to smoking 
cessation, and their experiences with smoking cessation.
METHODS: This is a qualitative study using semi-structured individual 
interviews. The participants were asked, among others, to elaborate on the 
participants' thoughts about smoking, previous attempts to quit tobacco use, and 
what could prompt a smoking cessation attempt. We analyzed the transcripts with 
systematic text condensation. The Standards for Reporting Qualitative Research 
and the Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research guidelines were 
followed. Opioid-dependent patients receiving opioid agonist therapy in 
outpatient clinics were invited to participate using a purposive sampling 
method. In total, fourteen individuals participated in this study.
RESULTS: We identified six themes which were: (1) reflections on how smoking 
affected decisions, (2) smoking and its impact on physical and mental health, 
(3) the economy as a motivator to stop smoking, (4) emotions, desires, and 
habits related to smoking, (5) knowledge of smoking, smoking cessation, and quit 
attempts, and (6) social factors influencing the participants' choices and 
activities. The participants were well informed about the consequences of 
smoking and had some knowledge and experience in quitting. The participants' 
pulmonary health was an important motivational factor for change. Withdrawal 
symptoms, anxiety, and fear of using other substances discouraged several from 
attempting to quit smoking. In contrast, social support from partners and access 
to meaningful activities were considered important factors for success. Few 
reported being offered help from health professionals to make a smoking 
cessation attempt.
DISCUSSION: Experiencing social support, being encouraged to quit smoking, and 
patients' concerns for their physical health were important reasons for wanting 
to quit smoking. Smoking cessation interventions based on patient preferences 
and on the behavior change wheel may enable a higher success rate among patients 
receiving opioid agonist therapy.

How have health and social mortality risks changed over time? Evidence from 
pre-1945 cohorts is sparse, mostly from the United States, and evidence is mixed 
on long-term changes in the risk of being overweight. We develop a dataset of 
men entering the NZ army in the two world wars, with objectively measured height 
and weight, and socioeconomic status in early adulthood. Our sample includes 
significant numbers of indigenous Māori, providing estimates of weight and 
mortality risk in an indigenous population. We follow men from war's end until 
death, with data on more than 12,000 men from each war. Overweight and obesity 
were important risk factors for mortality, and associated with shorter life 
expectancy. However, the reduction in life expectancy associated with being 
overweight declined from 5 to 3 years between the two cohorts, consistent with 
the hypothesis that being overweight became less risky during the twentieth 
century.

Diabetes and two kinds of primary tumors in a patient with thalassemia: a case 
report and literature review.

BACKGROUND: Thalassemia is a group of common genetic hematologic disorders 
characterized by deficient synthesis of the hemoglobin chain. Due to effective 
blood transfusion and optimization of chelate therapy, the survival of 
thalassemia patients and their overall quality of life have improved noticeably 
in the past few decades. As a consequence, the longer life expectancy has led to 
the manifestation of several concomitant morbidities, including heart disease, 
infections, cirrhosis, endocrine abnormalities, various malignancies, and so on. 
In this context, the probability and updated literature about some malignancy 
cases in patients with thalassemia build new scenarios for the next few years. 
We describe the first report of a thalassemic patient developing diabetes and 
head and neck cancer and try to summarize the possible predisposing factors and 
mechanisms behind their phenomenon.
CASE PRESENTATION: The current case report describes a 50-year-old Asian man who 
has been diagnosed with thalassemia since childhood. In early 2017, he was also 
diagnosed with diabetes and started on insulin-hypoglycemic treatment. The 
patient was then diagnosed with primary non-keratinizing undifferentiated 
carcinoma of the nasopharynx in late February 2013. A biopsy of the left tongue 
revealed squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) in late March 2019.
CONCLUSIONS: We report the first case of a thalassemic patient developing 
diabetes and squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck and discuss the 
possibility of a link between the three diseases. This specific case should 
alert physicians to the possibility of endocrinopathy and malignancy in 
thalassemic patients.

Duchenne muscular dystrophy is an X-linked monogenic disease caused by mutations 
in the dystrophin gene (DMD) characterized by progressive muscle weakness, 
leading to loss of ambulation and decreased life expectancy. Since the current 
standard of care for Duchenne muscular dystrophy is to merely treat symptoms, 
there is a dire need for treatment modalities that can correct the underlying 
genetic mutations. While several gene replacement therapies are being explored 
in clinical trials, one emerging approach that can directly correct mutations in 
genomic DNA is base editing. We have recently developed CRISPR-SKIP, a base 
editing strategy to induce permanent exon skipping by introducing C > T or A > G 
mutations at splice acceptors in genomic DNA, which can be used therapeutically 
to recover dystrophin expression when a genomic deletion leads to an 
out-of-frame DMD transcript. We now demonstrate that CRISPR-SKIP can be adapted 
to correct some forms of Duchenne muscular dystrophy by disrupting the splice 
acceptor in human DMD exon 45 with high efficiency, which enables open reading 
frame recovery and restoration of dystrophin expression. We also demonstrate 
that AAV-delivered split-intein base editors edit the splice acceptor of DMD 
exon 45 in cultured human cells and in vivo, highlighting the therapeutic 
potential of this strategy.

Orbital cellulitis is a sight- and life-threatening condition. Prompt diagnosis 
and immediate intervention are required. We report a case of fatal odontogenic 
orbital cellulitis complicated with intracranial abscesses in a 55-year-old 
gentleman. The patient presented with painful swelling of the left eye 
associated with reduced eye movement, blurry vision, and a headache. There was 
generalized periodontitis. Initial imaging was suggestive of left eye orbital 
cellulitis with intracranial abscess, and intensive systemic antibiotic therapy 
was initiated. After six weeks of antibiotic therapy, there was an improvement 
in ocular signs and symptoms. However, the patient developed signs of meningism 
with a persistent fever. Serial brain imaging demonstrated worsening 
intracranial abscesses. The patient died eight weeks after the initial onset of 
presentation. This case emphasized that brain abscesses could be a fatal 
complication of odontogenic orbital cellulitis. A high index of suspicion is 
important in diagnosing orbital cellulitis and its complications. Early 
consideration of surgical intervention is necessary in cases not responding to 
antibiotic therapy.

Background In recent years, advances in the treatment of malignant tumors have 
improved life expectancy and diversified treatment options. However, maintaining 
high activities of daily living in patients is essential for appropriately 
treating the primary disease, and interventions for patients with impaired motor 
function will lead to improved quality of life. Here, we compared the muscle 
mass of malignant tumor patients who are visiting bone metastasis outpatient 
clinics with that of healthy subjects. Methods We compared the muscle mass of 61 
malignant tumor patients with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) 
performance status ≤ 2 (mean 66.3 ± 12.0 years; 30 males and 31 females) 
attending our bone metastasis outpatient clinic since 2018 with that of 315 
healthy subjects (mean 65.0 ± 17.7 years; 110 males and 205 females). Body mass 
index, skeletal muscle mass, and body fat percentage were assessed by 
bioimpedance analysis, and the skeletal muscle mass index (SMI) was calculated. 
Results To eliminate age bias in the malignant tumor patients and healthy 
subjects, 1:1 propensity score matching was performed separately for males and 
females. There was no significant difference in right upper limb, left upper 
limb, right lower limb, or left lower limb mass or SMI between the two groups, 
whereas trunk muscle mass and muscle mass were significantly higher in the 
healthy females compared with malignant tumor females. Conclusion There was no 
significant difference in the SMI measured by bioimpedance analysis between the 
two groups in either males or females, while muscle mass and trunk muscle mass 
were significantly lower in female malignant tumor patients than in healthy 
subjects. These results suggest that even malignant tumor patients whose 
performance status was maintained enough to allow outpatient visits still had 
impaired motor function.

INTRODUCTION: Medicine faces nowadays the trend of increasing life expectancy of 
human population, with the resulting increase of degenerative age related 
diseases prevalence, combined with the risks of less tempered sun radiations 
environment exposure. Under these circumstances, our work pointed out on 
evaluating the effect of some xanthophyll pigments dietary supplements, actually 
widely recommended, for prevention of retinal degenerative damages and for 
slowing down the progression of such age related changes if they have already 
occurred. These dietary supplements are already well known for their total 
antioxidant activity, proven by photochemiluminescence method using Total 
Antioxidant Capacity in Lipid soluble-substances procedure.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study recruited a number of 120 subjects equally 
divided on genders. The lot included a first group of 60 patients with 
comparable ages (all of them over 50 years and divided in 2 segments of age: 
50-60 and over 60) and suffering from comparable retinal age-related 
degenerative abnormalities (mild/medium severity age-related macular 
degeneration according to Wisconsin Age-Related Maculopathy Grading System), and 
a second group, considered control, including a similar number of healthy, 
normal retina subjects belonging to same age and gender categories. There were 
evaluated at baseline the eye medical status and the retinal risk by specific 
methods: complete eye check-up, Amsler grid, specific standardized 
questionnaires focused on visual function and its impact on the quality of 
current life. Both groups, patients and control, received similar dosages of 
xanthophyll pigments dietary supplements including lutein and zeaxanthin during 
18 months after baseline; at the end of this supplementation period a new 
evaluation was conducted. In the second part of the research all subjects 
involved received a new dietary supplement in which the same xanthophylls were 
enriched with C and E vitamins and oligo-elements Zinc and Copper. At the end of 
three years duration supplementation, the subjects were reevaluated and the 
paper presents the conclusions on the matter, pointing on the impact of 
xanthophyll supplements on visual health.
RESULTS: Correlation tests were applied to the complete set of data. Correlation 
tests have values between -1 and +1. The value -1 represents the negative 
correlation (reverse proportionality) meanwhile the value +1 represents the 
positive correlation (direct proportionality). The charts show the curves that 
are fitting experimental data. The dependence is linear in nature, and the value 
R2, as it approaches more the value 1, represents a better match with the 
experimental data (the data are in a percentage of approximately 99% on these 
straight lines of type y = ax + b). In the charts, there were noted the average 
values of the scores for healthy control patients with "Control", and the 
average values of the scores for the patients with existing age related 
degenerative retinal pathology at baseline with "Patients".
DISCUSSION: The retinal function and the impact of visual condition on health 
were both evaluated at baseline, 18 months and 36 months after baseline, by 
visual acuity, ophthalmoscopy fundus examination, Amsler test and by asking the 
subjects to answer the visual function questionnaires: EQ-5D, NEI-VFQ-25, as 
measures of health status quality and of the influence on welfare. The study 
revealed that under supplementation both control healthy subjects and patients 
with known degenerative retinal pathology included in the 50-60 years of age 
group evolved almost the same way, leading to the conclusion that administered 
xanthophyll pigments-based supplements, simple or enriched, managed to slow down 
the progression of abnormal degenerative vision loss to a rate comparable to 
physiological aging-related vision loss. It was also observed that intake of 
xanthophyll pigments dietary supplements preserved the general health condition 
and maintained relatively constant vision on the entire 36th months follow-up 
research duration in patients presented with existing age related degenerative 
retinal pathology at baseline. For healthy subjects, evaluation showed an 
improvement in results after dietary supplementation, with maintenance of 
constant vision and a significantly increase of general condition, in a positive 
sense. For subjects over the age of 60 dietary supplements intake was even more 
effective compared to younger group in providing better control of degenerative 
processes.

On the occasion of the 20th anniversary of the REIN (French Renal Epidemiology 
and Information Network), a summary work on the contributions of the national 
French ESKD register was carried out. On the issue of paediatric CKD patients, 
the following key messages were retained. Paediatric stage 5 chronic kidney 
disease (CKD) has particularities that require to be analysed and taken into 
account because the mortality of these patients remains 30 times higher than 
that of children of the same age. The REIN registry enables illustrating the 
specificities of stage 5 CKD in the paediatric age-group in France and providing 
a set of indicators making it possible to describe the future of these patients 
as well as the choices made concerning the modalities of replacement therapy. As 
compared to other European countries, the incidence and prevalence of stage 5 
CKD in France is in the middle range for children under 15 and 20 years old. 
Renal transplant is by far the leading treatment for stage 5 CKD in children and 
adolescents under 18 years of age in France, allowing to offer these patients 
the best possible life expectancy. Owing to the small volume of patients, only a 
nationwide registry can provide an unbiased view and enables analysing this 
population requiring a hyperspecialised treatment. The participation of French 
paediatric nephrologists in the REIN French registry also enables providing 
input to the European registry (ESPN/ERA www.espn-reg.org/index.jsp) and the 
international registry (IPNA https://ipna-registry.org) (Consulted on September 
15th 2022) and thus the possibility of international studies, which are vital to 
be in line with an approach to improving practices.

Publisher: À l’occasion des 20 ans du REIN (Réseau Epidémiologie et Information 
en Néphrologie), un travail de synthèse sur les apports du registre a été mené. 
Sur la question des patients pédiatriques, les messages clés suivants ont été 
retenus. La maladie rénale chronique (MRC) stade 5 pédiatrique a des 
particularités qui nécessitent d’être analysées et prises en compte car la 
mortalité de ces patients reste 30 fois supérieure à celle des enfants du même 
âge. Le registre REIN permet d’illustrer les spécificités de la MRC stade 5 à 
l’âge pédiatrique en France et de fournir un ensemble d’indicateurs permettant 
de décrire le devenir de ces patients ainsi que les choix faits concernant les 
modalités de traitement de suppléance. En comparaison à d’autres pays européens, 
l’incidence et la prévalence de la MRC stade 5 en France se situent dans les 
valeurs moyennes chez les enfants de moins de 15 et 20 ans. La transplantation 
rénale est de loin le premier traitement de la MRC stade 5 parmi les enfants et 
les adolescents de moins de 18 ans en France, permettant d’offrir à ces patients 
la meilleure espérance de vie possible. En raison du petit volume de patients, 
seul un registre à l’échelon national permet d’avoir une vision non biaisée et 
d’analyser cette population nécessitant une prise en charge hyperspécialisée. La 
participation des néphropédiatres français au registre français REIN permet 
aussi d’alimenter le registre européen (ESPN/ ERA www.espn-reg.org/index.jsp) et 
le registre international (IPNA https://ipna-registry.org) (Consulté le 15 
septembre 2022) et ainsi la possibilité d’études internationales, indispensables 
pour s’inscrire dans une démarche d’amélioration des pratiques.

Depression is one of the most prevalent mental health disorders globally, 
causing severe emotional suffering, reducing life expectancy and increasing the 
risk of suicide. Recently, the use of dissociative psychedelic substances such 
as ketamine and esketamine for depressive disorders has expanded treatment 
options. We sought to analyze, through a systematic review, the existing 
protocols for the treatment of depression with ketamine and esketamine. The 
search adopted PRISMA criteria and was performed using PubMed and Web of Science 
databases. Procedures in each study were compared, focusing on the sample 
recruited, therapeutic approaches, including the clinical team and professionals 
engaged in treatment, medical procedures, description of the setting (including 
music) and factors such as specific medication (ketamine or esketamine), route 
of administration and dosage employed. Results indicated the predominance of a 
medical approach, with a limited number of studies on ketamine assisted 
psychotherapy (KAP) and other modalities of psychedelic assisted therapy. 
Additionally, there is limited information on psychosocial elements such as 
preparation, psychological support during session and integration of experience. 
Altogether these findings suggest that treatment of depression with ketamine or 
esketamine diverges in relation to the practices employed with psychedelic 
substances. This is discussed considering future research directions in the 
field.

Despite extensive research on cognitive impairment and limitations in basic 
activities of daily living, no study has investigated the burden of their 
co-occurrence (co-impairment). Using the Health and Retirement Study data and 
incidence-based multistate models, we study the population burden of 
co-impairment using three key indicators: mean age at onset, lifetime risk, and 
health expectancy. We examine patterns by gender, race, ethnicity, nativity, 
education, and their interactions for U.S. residents aged 50-100. Furthermore, 
we analyze what fractions of racial, ethnic, and nativity disparities in 
co-impairment are attributable to inequalities in educational attainment. 
Results reveal that an estimated 56% of women and 41% of men aged 50 will 
experience co-impairment in their remaining life expectancy. Men experience an 
earlier onset of co-impairment than women (74 vs. 77 years), and women live 
longer in co-impairment than men (3.4 vs. 1.9 years). Individuals who are Black, 
Latinx, and lower educated, especially those experiencing intersecting 
disadvantages, have substantially higher lifetime risk of co-impairment, earlier 
co-impairment onset, and longer life in co-impairment than their counterparts. 
Up to 75% of racial, ethnic, and nativity disparity is attributable to 
inequality in educational attainment. This study provides novel insights into 
the burden of co-impairment and offers evidence of dramatic disparities in the 
older U.S. population.

Lung cancer and liver cancer are the leading and third causes of cancer death, 
respectively. Both lung and liver cancer are with clear major risk factors. A 
thorough understanding of their burdens in the context of globalization, 
especially the convergences and variations among WHO regions, is useful in 
precision cancer prevention worldwide and understanding the changing 
epidemiological trends with the expanding globalization. The Global Burden of 
Disease (GBD) and WHO Global Health Observatory (GHO) database were analyzed to 
evaluate the burden metrics and risk factors of trachea, bronchus, and lung 
(TBL) cancer and liver cancer. Western Pacific Region (WPR) had the highest 
age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR) for both liver cancer (11.02 [9.62-12.61] 
per 100,000 population) and TBL cancer (38.82 [33.63-44.04] per 100,000 
population) in 2019. Disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) for liver and TBL 
cancer elevated with the increasing sociodemographic index (SDI) level, except 
for liver cancer in WPR and TBL cancer in European Region (EUR). Region of the 
Americas (AMR) showed the biggest upward trends of liver cancer age-standardized 
rates (ASRs), as well as the biggest downward trends of TBL cancer ASRs, 
followed by Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR). Alcohol use and smoking were the 
leading cause of liver and TBL cancer death in most WHO regions. Variances of 
ASRs for liver and TBL cancer among WHO memberships have been decreasing during 
the past decade. The homogenization and convergence of cancer burdens were also 
demonstrated in different agegroups and sexes and in the evolution of associated 
risk factors and etiology. In conclusion, our study reflects the variations and 
convergences in the liver and lung cancer burdens among the WHO regions with the 
developing globalization, which suggests that we need to be acutely aware of the 
global homogeneity of the disease burden that accompanies increasing 
globalization, including the global convergences in various populations, risk 
factors, and burden metrics.

BACKGROUND: It is unknown whether five-year overall survival (OS) differs and to 
what extent between testicular germ-cell tumor (TGCT) patients and age-matched 
male population-based controls.
MATERIALS: We identified newly diagnosed (2004-2014) TGCT patients within 
Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results database 2004-2019. We compared OS 
between non-seminoma (NS-TGCT) and seminoma (S-TGCT) patients relative to 
age-matched male population-based controls based on Social Security 
Administration Life-Tables. Smoothed cumulative incidence plots displayed 
cancer-specific mortality (CSM) vs. other-cause mortality (OCM).
RESULTS: Of all 20,935 TGCT patients, 43% had NS-TGCT and 57% had S-TGCT. Of 
NS-TGCT patients, 63% were stage I vs. 16% stage II vs. 21% stage III. Of S-TGCT 
patients, 86% were stage I vs. 8% were stage II vs. 6% stage III. Five-year OS 
differences between NS-TGCT patients vs age-matched male population-based 
controls were 97 vs. 99% (Δ = 2%) for stage I, 96 vs. 99% (Δ = 3%) for stage II, 
76 vs 98% (Δ = 22%) for stage III. Five-year OS differences between S-TGCT 
patients vs age-matched male population-based controls were 97 vs. 98% (Δ = 1%) 
for stage I, 95 vs. 97% (Δ = 2%) for stage II, 87 vs. 98% (Δ = 11%) for stage 
III. OCM rates ranged from 1 to 3% in NS-TGCT patients and from 2 to 4% in 
S-TGCT patients.
CONCLUSION: The OS difference between NS-TGCT patients vs. age-matched male 
population-based controls was invariably higher across all stages (2-22%) than 
for S-TGCT patients (1-11%). Reassuringly, OCM rates were marginal in stage I 
and stage II patients. Conversely, higher OCM rates were recorded in stage III 
patients.

BACKGROUND: Multimorbidity, typically defined as having two or more long-term 
health conditions, is associated with reduced wellbeing and life expectancy.
