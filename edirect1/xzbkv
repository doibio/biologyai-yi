Nineteen percent of mothers were initiate complementary before 6 months. The 
reason for too early initiation of complementary feeding was lack of knowledge 
and perceive inadequate breast milk production by mothers 17(47.2%), 11(30.6%) 
respectively. Mothers have male child three times more likely timely initiate 
complementary feeding than female child (AOR 2.9,95% CI 1.2-7.3). This might be 
due to traditional gender norm that discriminate female feeding "female eat 
little talk little" this might start at early age life.
CONCLUSION: More than half of them initiated complementary feeding timely which 
was low. The main reason reported by the mothers for early initiation of 
complementary feeding was lack of knowledge. Mothers who have male child were 
three times more likely timely initiate complementary feeding than female child. 
Information about importance of timely initiation of complementary feeding 
should be implemented via information education and behavioral change 
communications, and integrating with health extension package is recommended.

Malignant gliomas are among the rarest brain tumours, and they have the worst 
prognosis. Grade IV astrocytoma, known as glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), is a 
highly lethal disease where the standard therapies of surgery, followed by 
radiation and chemotherapy, cannot significantly prolong the life expectancy of 
the patients. Tumour recurrence shows more aggressive form compared to the 
primary tumour, and results in patient survival from 12 to 15 months only. 
Although still controversial, the cancer stem cell hypothesis postulates that 
cancer stem cells are responsible for early relapse of the disease after 
surgical intervention due to their high resistance to therapy. Alternative 
strategies for GBM therapy are thus urgently needed. Nanobodies are 
single-domain antigen-binding fragments of heavy-chain antibodies, and together 
with classical antibodies, they are part of the camelid immune system. 
Nanobodies are small and stable, and they share a high degree of sequence 
identity to the human heavy chain variable domain, and these characteristics 
offer them advantages over classical antibodies or antibody fragments. We first 
immunised an alpaca with a human GBM stem-like cell line prepared from primary 
GBM cultures. Next, a nanobody library was constructed in a phage-display 
vector. Using nanobody phage-display technology, we selected specific GBM 
stem-like cell binders through a number of affinity selections, using whole cell 
protein extracts and membrane protein-enriched extracts from eight different GBM 
patients, and membrane protein-enriched extracts from two established GBM 
stem-like cell lines (NCH644 and NCH421K cells). After the enrichment, 
periplasmic extract ELISA was used to screen for specific clones. These nanobody 
clones were recloned into the pHEN6 vector, expressed in Escherichia coli WK6, 
and purified using immobilised metal affinity chromatography and size-exclusion 
chromatography. Specific nanobody:antigen pairs were obtained and mass 
spectrometry analysis revealed two proteins, TRIM28 and β-actin, that were 
up-regulated in the GBM stem-like cells compared to the controls.

Down Syndrome (DS) is characterised by premature aging and an accelerated 
decline of cognitive functions in the vast majority of cases. As the life 
expectancy of DS persons is rapidly increasing, this decline is becoming a 
dramatic health problem. The aim of this study was to thoroughly evaluate a 
group of 67 non-demented persons with DS of different ages (11 to 66 years), 
from a neuropsychological, neuropsychiatric and psychomotor point of view in 
order to evaluate in a cross-sectional study the age-related adaptive and 
neuropsychological features, and to possibly identify early signs predictive of 
cognitive decline. The main finding of this study is that both 
neuropsychological functions and adaptive skills are lower in adult DS persons 
over 40 years old, compared to younger ones. In particular, language and short 
memory skills, frontal lobe functions, visuo-spatial abilities and adaptive 
behaviour appear to be the more affected domains. A growing deficit in verbal 
comprehension, along with social isolation, loss of interest and greater fatigue 
in daily tasks, are the main features found in older, non demented DS persons 
evaluated in our study. It is proposed that these signs can be alarm bells for 
incipient dementia, and that neuro-cognitive rehabilitation and 
psycho-pharmacological interventions must start as soon as the fourth decade (or 
even earlier) in DS persons, i.e. at an age where interventions can have the 
greatest efficacy.

The prevalence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk and events in patients with 
haemophilia (PWH) is expected to increase as the longevity of this cohort 
increases due to treatment advances since the 1950s. The aims of this study were 
to assess publications of CVD and haemophilia for robustness, determine if the 
increasing longevity of PWH and associated age-related CVD risk factors result 
in CVD events; assess the need for an extension of the circle of care for ageing 
PWH due to the shift in comorbidities. A scoping review was conducted, resulting 
in a final pool of 30 articles which were organized based on publication dates. 
A matrix was created to illustrate which articles cited articles published prior 
to its own publication. This led to the identification of the primary articles, 
receiving the highest number of citations by other publications, which drive the 
research pertaining to the study of age-related risk factors of CVD in PWH. The 
scoping review revealed 14 original articles, four of which indicated a 
protective effect of haemophilia toward CVD. Twelve articles demonstrated a 
similar prevalence of CVD in PWH compared to the general population while seven 
articles concluded a difference in the prevalence of CVD in the ageing 
haemophilia population. The existing literature presented conflicting evidence 
regarding the possibility of a protective effect of haemophilia against CVD. The 
scoping review was not able to finalize whether the longevity of PWH and their 
associated age-related CVD risk factors result in CVD events because the 
articles assessed reported conflicting results.

Cost-effectiveness analysis of quadrivalent influenza vaccine versus trivalent 
influenza vaccine for elderly in Hong Kong.

You JH, Ming WK, Chan PK.

BACKGROUND: Cost and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained by quadrivalent 
influenza vaccine (QIV) versus trivalent influenza vaccine (TIV) in Hong Kong 
elderly were estimated over 9 seasons.
METHODS: TIV-unmatched influenza B infection rates with QIV versus TIV were 
estimated by an epidemiology model. Model parameters included percentages of 
influenza B lineages in circulation, influenza B-associated hospital admission, 
age-specific population, vaccine coverage and effectiveness. Incremental cost 
per QALY gained (ICER) by QIV versus TIV were estimated from Hong Kong's 
societal perspective.
RESULTS: Mean reduction in influenza B infection rate was 191.3 (95%CI 
45.1-337.5) per 100,000 population aged ≥65 years. Highest cost savings and 
QALYs gained by QIV occurred in 2007 with high percentage of TIV-unmatched 
strain (92.9%) for age groups 65-79 years (USD266,473 and 22.8 QALYs) and 
≥80 years (USD483,461 and 27.3 QALYs). ICERs of QIV were below 
willingness-to-pay for age group 65-79 years in 6, 5 and 3 years when QIV 
cost + USD1 + USD2 and + USD5 more than TIV, respectively. For age group 
≥80 years, ICERs of QIV were below willingness-to-pay in 7 and 5 years when QIV 
cost + USD1 and + USD5, correspondingly.
CONCLUSIONS: Acceptance of QIV to be cost-effective in Hong Kong elderly was 
subject to QIV unit cost and percentage of circulating TIV-unmatched influenza B 
lineages.

Ischemic heart disease is the single leading cause of death and a significant 
cause of morbidity among women in industrialized countries. Current guidelines 
recommend antiplatelet therapy as the main cornerstone for the prevention and 
treatment of cardiovascular disease. Unfortunately, evidence is emerging that 
the response to antiplatelet drugs differs according to sex, although the 
biological basis for this gender disparity is unknown. In order to explain the 
epidemiological data showing a more severe clinical expression of cardiovascular 
disease in addition to adverse outcomes despite optimal pharmacological and 
interventional approaches in women compared to men, differences in platelet 
reactivity related to sex and gender are currently under investigation. In this 
report, we review available data from clinical trials of antiplatelet drugs 
administered for primary and secondary prevention, focusing on the 
underenrollment of female subjects in interventional randomized studies and weak 
community awareness of the impact of cardiovascular disease on life expectancy 
in women. Based on our findings, the development of real gender-oriented 
evidence-based guidelines for antiplatelet use in the setting of cardiovascular 
disease is urgently required.

Cost-effectiveness analysis of a low-cost bubble CPAP device in providing 
ventilatory support for neonates in Malawi - a preliminary report.

Chen A, Deshmukh AA, Richards-Kortum R, Molyneux E, Kawaza K, Cantor SB.

BACKGROUND: A low-cost bubble continuous positive airway pressure (bCPAP) device 
has been shown to be an excellent clinical alternative to nasal oxygen for the 
care of neonates with respiratory difficulty. However, the delivery of bCPAP 
requires more resources than the current routine care using nasal oxygen. We 
performed an economic evaluation to determine the cost-effectiveness of a 
low-cost bCPAP device in providing ventilatory support for neonates in Malawi.
METHODS: We used patient-level clinical data from a previously published 
non-randomized controlled study. Economic data were based on the purchase price 
of supplies and equipment, adjusted for shelf life, as well as hospital cost 
data from the World Health Organization. Costs and benefits were discounted at 
3%. The outcomes were measured in terms of cost, discounted life expectancy, 
cost/life year gained and net benefits of using bCPAP or nasal oxygen. The 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio and incremental net benefits determined the 
value of one intervention compared to the other. Subgroup analysis on several 
parameters (birth weight categories, diagnosis of respiratory distress syndrome, 
and comorbidity of sepsis) was conducted to evaluate the effect of these 
parameters on the cost-effectiveness.
RESULTS: Nasal oxygen therapy was less costly (US$29.29) than the low-cost bCPAP 
device ($57.78). Incremental effectiveness associated with bCPAP was 6.78 life 
years (LYs). In the base case analysis, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
for bCPAP relative to nasal oxygen therapy was determined to be $4.20 (95% 
confidence interval, US$2.29-US$16.67) per LY gained. The results were highly 
sensitive for all tested subgroups, particularly for neonates with birth weight 
1- < 1.5 kg, respiratory distress syndrome, or comorbidity of sepsis; these 
subgroups had a higher probability that bCPAP would be cost effective.
CONCLUSION: The bCPAP is a highly cost-effective strategy in providing 
ventilatory support for neonates in Malawi.

Changing the obesogenic environment of severe mentally ill residential patients: 
ELIPS, a cluster randomised study design.

Looijmans A, Jörg F, Schoevers RA, Bruggeman R, Stolk RP, Corpeleijn E.

BACKGROUND: Severe mentally ill (SMI) patients have a reduced life expectancy of 
13-30 years compared to the general population, largely due to an increased risk 
of cardiovascular mortality. Unhealthy lifestyle behaviours in SMI patients 
contribute to this increased risk. The obesogenic living environment of patients 
in residential facilities may even pose an extra risk. Although several studies 
have shown positive effects of lifestyle interventions on SMI patients' weight 
status, studies including residential patients and their obesogenic environment 
are scarce. This paper describes the Effectiveness of Lifestyle Interventions in 
PSychiatry trial (ELIPS). The goal of this trial is to improve cardiometabolic 
health in severe mentally ill residential patients by addressing the obesogenic 
environment.
METHODS/DESIGN: The ELIPS study is a multi-site cluster randomised controlled 
trial (RCT) based on the principles of a pragmatic RCT. All residential and 
long-term clinical care teams of two large mental health care organisations in 
the North of the Netherlands serving SMI patients are invited to participate. 
The intervention is aimed at team level. Lifestyle coaches first develop a team 
specific lifestyle plan that tailors the ELIPS goals and protocol and then train 
teams on how to create a healthy environment and stimulate healthy behaviours in 
patients. After three months, teams take over the intervention after they have 
set out goals to achieve in the following nine months. In this phase, adherence 
to the lifestyle plan and pre-set goals is monitored. Patients in the control 
arm receive care as usual. Primary outcome measure is waist circumference at 
three and 12 months after baseline.
DISCUSSION: ELIPS is different from previously published lifestyle intervention 
studies in three ways. First, it follows the principles of a pragmatic design, 
which enables the examination of effects in everyday practice. Second, by 
implementing the intervention at team level, we expect lifestyle activities to 
be maintained when interventionists leave. Last, by targeting the obesogenic 
environment we create a prerequisite for any sustainable health improvement, as 
patients can only make healthy choices in a healthy living environment.

Since its foundation 30 years ago, the mission of the Asia-Pacific Academic 
Consortium for Public Health has been promoting "health for all" through public 
health. "Health for all" became the theme of Walter Patrick's public health 
career and inspired his contribution to APACPH. However, the universality of 
health care is now under threat, more from economists and politicians than 
public health workers. Health for all remains a continuing challenge for all 
public health workers in our region. Progress is being made toward this goal as 
life expectancy in the Western Pacific has increased from 64 to 78 in the past 3 
decades. Prof Walter Patrick was strong public health advocate, and this review 
was written as a tribute to good friend and inspiring colleague who believed in, 
and worked for "health for all."

OBJECTIVE: Everolimus and axitinib are approved in the US to treat patients with 
advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) after failure on sunitinib or sorafenib, and 
one prior systemic therapy (e.g., sunitinib), respectively. Two indirect 
comparisons performed to evaluate progression-free survival in patients treated 
with everolimus vs axitinib suggested similar efficacy between the two 
treatments. Therefore, this analysis compares the lifetime costs of these two 
therapies among sunitinib-refractory advanced RCC patients from a US payer 
perspective.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A Markov model was developed to simulate a cohort 
of sunitinib-refractory advanced RCC patients and estimate the cost of treating 
patients with everolimus vs axitinib. The following health states were included: 
stable disease without adverse events (AEs), stable disease with AEs, disease 
progression (PD), and death. The model included the following resources: active 
treatments, post-progression treatments, adverse events, physician and nurse 
visits, scans and tests, and palliative care. Resource utilization inputs were 
derived from a US claims database analysis. Additionally, a 3% annual discount 
rate was applied to costs, and the robustness of the model results was tested by 
conducting sensitivity analyses, including those on dosing scheme and 
post-progression treatment costs.
RESULTS: Base case results demonstrated that patients treated with everolimus 
cost an average of $12,985 (11%) less over their lifetimes than patients treated 
with axitinib. The primary difference in costs was related to active treatment, 
which was largely driven by axitinib's higher dose intensity. RESULTS remained 
consistent across sensitivity analyses for AE and PD treatment costs, as well as 
dose intensity and discount rates.
CONCLUSION: The results suggest that everolimus likely leads to lower lifetime 
costs than axitinib for sunitinib-refractory advanced RCC patients in the US.

OBJECT: The surgical treatment of many large arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) 
is associated with substantial risks, and many are considered inoperable. 
Furthermore, AVMs larger than 3 cm in diameter are not usually treated with 
conventional single-session radiosurgery encompassing the entire AVM volume. 
Volume-staged stereotactic radiosurgery (VS-SRS) is an option for large AVMs, 
but it has mixed results. The authors report on a series of patients with 
high-grade AVMs who underwent multiple VS-SRS sessions with resultant 
downgrading of the AVMs, followed by resection.
METHODS: A cohort of patients was retrieved from a single-institution AVM 
patient registry consisting of prospectively collected data. VS-SRS was 
performed as a planned intentional treatment. Surgery was considered as salvage 
therapy in select patients.
RESULTS: Sixteen AVMs underwent VS-SRS followed by surgery. Four AVMs presented 
with rupture. The mean patient age was 25.3 years (range 13-54 years). The 
average initial Spetzler-Martin grade before any treatment was 4, while the 
average supplemented Spetzler-Martin grade (Spetzler-Martin plus Lawton-Young) 
was 7.1. The average AVM size in maximum dimension was 5.9 cm (range 3.3-10 cm). 
All AVMs were supratentorial in location and all except one were in eloquent 
areas of the brain, with 7 involving primary motor cortex. The mean number of 
VS-SRS sessions was 2.7 (range 2-5 sessions). The mean interval between first 
VS-SRS session and resection was 5.7 years. There were 4 hemorrhages that 
occurred after VS-SRS. The average Spetzler-Martin grade was reduced to 2.5 
(downgrade, -1.5) and the average supplemented Spetzler-Martin grade was reduced 
to 5.6 (downgrade, -1.5). The maximum AVM size was reduced to an average of 3.0 
cm (downsize=-2.9 cm). The mean modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores were 1.2, 
2.3, and 2.2 before VS-SRS, before surgery, and at last follow-up, respectively 
(mean follow-up, 6.9 years). Fifteen AVMs were cured after surgery. Ten patients 
had good outcomes at last follow-up (7 with mRS Score 0 or 1, and 3 with mRS 
Score 2). There were 2 deaths (both mRS Score 1 before treatment) and 4 patients 
with mRS Score 3 outcome (from mRS Scores 0, 1, and 2 [n=2]).
CONCLUSIONS: Volume-staged SRS can downgrade AVMs, transforming high-grade AVMs 
(initially considered inoperable) into operable AVMs with acceptable surgical 
risks. This treatment paradigm offers an alternative to conservative observation 
for young patients with unruptured AVMs and long life expectancy, where the risk 
of hemorrhage is substantial. Difficult AVMs were cured in 15 patients. Surgical 
morbidity associated with downgraded AVMs is reduced to that of 
postradiosurgical/preoperative supplemented Spetzler-Martin grades, not their 
initial AVM grades.

[Cost-effectiveness and budget impact of ivabradine in heart failure therapy].

[Article in Italian]

Polistena B, Maggioni AP, Oliva F, Spandonaro F.

BACKGROUND: Cost-effectiveness of ivabradine was assessed by the National 
Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) in 2012, based on the data 
derived from the SHIFT trial: NICE considered ivabradine cost-effective for 
treating chronic heart failure, supporting drug reimbursement by the national 
healthcare system (NHS). The aim of this study was to assess the 
cost-effectiveness of ivabradine on top of standard care in heart failure 
therapy, by adapting a Markovian model to the Italian population and 
organization, previously developed for submission to national regulatory bodies.
METHODS: The demographic and clinical characteristics of the Italian population 
were derived from both the SHIFT trial and the IN-HF Outcome registry (Italian 
real practice data). Costs were drawn from the Italian NHS information system. 
All analyses adopted the Italian NHS perspective.
RESULTS: In a lifetime horizon, in the base case, our assessment confirms that 
adoption of ivabradine seems socially acceptable with a cost per 
quality-adjusted life year (QALY) of €17,434.86 (incremental cost of €2,952.85 
and QALYs gained 0.21). The incremental cost/life-year gained (LYG) is 
€15,557.24 (LYG gained 0.24) and hospitalization costs avoided are €3,420.77 
(avoided hospitalizations 0.76). A probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed 
that ivabradine on top of standard treatment is cost-effective in more than 87% 
of cases accepting a threshold of €30,000, and in more than 93% of cases with a 
threshold of €40,000.
CONCLUSIONS: The results obtained for the Italian population and in the 
organizational context of the Italian NHS show social acceptability (cost per 
QALY) of ivabradine therapy in the treatment of heart failure.

[Clinical and economical evaluation of new analgesics for the management of 
chronic pain].

[Article in Italian]

Coluzzi F, Ruggeri M.

The management of chronic pain still represent a challenge for physicians. 
Opioids are the main stem in the treatment of chronic severe pain, not only for 
their potency, but as they act as central drugs. The main limit to their 
utilization in clinical practice is the prevalence of side effects, in 
particular in the gastrointestinal tract, whose constipation represents the most 
common. Two new formulations are nowadays available on the market: tapentadol PR 
(TAP PR) and oxycodone/naloxone (OXN). A recent meta-analysis showed that both 
drugs have a better tolerability profile than a tradizional opioid, such as 
oxycodone CR (OXY CR), but TAP PR reduces by 47% (RR=0.53) the percentage of 
patients discontinuing treatment because of side effects, compared to 24% 
(RR=0.76) of OXN. A similar advantage has been reported in the reduction of the 
risk of developing nausea and/or vomiting: TAP PR reduces the risk by 47% 
(RR=0.53), while OXN reduces the risk by only by 10% (RR=0.90). Both drugs 
reduced by about 40% the risk of constipation (RR=0.61 for TAP PR and for OXN). 
These results have been recently confirmed by a direct comparison of the two 
formulations (TAP PR vs OXN) in patients with chronic low back pain with 
neuropathic component. Both drugs were reported to be effective in reducing pain 
intensity and neuropathic symptoms, however TAP PR resulted superior to OXN in 
terms of analgesic efficacy, quality of life, and tolerability, in particular 
regarding constipation and adherence to treatment. A pharmacoeconomic analysis 
can be useful to understand the costs of these clinical advantages, and can be 
done by using a probabilistic analisys and by populating a Markov model that 
simulates the transition in time of 100 patients through 4 different possible 
health states: 1) still on treatment; 2) presence of adverse events; 3) 
discontinuation; 4) death. Both treatments (TAP PR and OXN) have been shown to 
have an excellent cost-effectiveness profile. In the case of OXN, in one year, 
0.29 QALYs were gained compared to the use of OXY CR at an additional cost of € 
138 resulting in a cost per QALY gained of € 475 (€ 138/0.29). In the case of 
TAP PR, instead, 0.31 QALYs were gained with additional savings due to the 
reduction of drug side effects, hospitalizations and emergency department 
access. Therefore, the use of TAP PR implies an average saving of € 31.6 per 
patient. These data are the results of a pharmacoeconomic model and require a 
further validation in clinical practice.

HELPcB (Health Effects in High-Level Exposure to Polychlorinated Biphenyls 
[PCB]) is a surveillance program for former PCB-exposed workers of a capacitor 
recycling company and other concerned individuals. The aim of this study was to 
examine the influence of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) on the health-related 
quality of life (HRQL) and on quality-adjusted life years (QALY). The EQ-5D-3L 
questionnaire was used to determine the HRQL. After three cross-sectional 
examinations at intervals of 1 yr, the longitudinal development of QALY was 
compared by repeated-measurement analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). The cohort was 
split at the 95th percentile of the comparison group for each PCB congener; 
known confounders such as age were taken into account. A significant difference 
in height and development of QALY over time was shown for the higher chlorinated 
non-dioxin-like PCB (hcPCB) congeners. A significant between-groups effect was 
found on PCB 153, PCB 180, and the sum of hcPCB. It was found that QALY 
decreased in the high-burden group and QALY stabilized after yr 2 in the 
normal-burden group. Taking the dimensions of the EQ-5D into account, the 
between-groups effect seems to be based predominantly on the dimension anxiety. 
The development of the within-group effect, however, seems to be based on the 
dimension mobility. This study detected a significant influence of hcPCB on the 
development of HRQL and QALYs over time according to the level of internal PCB 
burden.

Aging of the world population and a concomitant increase in age-related diseases 
and disabilities mandates the search for strategies to increase healthspan, the 
length of time an individual lives healthy and productively. Due to the 
age-related decline of the immune system, infectious diseases remain among the 
top 5-10 causes of mortality and morbidity in the elderly, and improving immune 
function during aging remains an important aspect of healthspan extension. 
Calorie restriction (CR) and more recently rapamycin (rapa) feeding have both 
been used to extend lifespan in mice. Preciously few studies have actually 
investigated the impact of each of these interventions upon in vivo immune 
defense against relevant microbial challenge in old organisms. We tested how 
rapa and CR each impacted the immune system in adult and old mice. We report 
that each intervention differentially altered T-cell development in the thymus, 
peripheral T-cell maintenance, T-cell function and host survival after West Nile 
virus infection, inducing distinct but deleterious consequences to the aging 
immune system. We conclude that neither rapa feeding nor CR, in the current 
form/administration regimen, may be optimal strategies for extending healthy 
immune function and, with it, lifespan.

Health economic analysis of human papillomavirus vaccines in women of Chile: 
perspective of the health care payer using a Markov model.

Aires, Argentina. alejandro.c.lepetic@gsk.com.

BACKGROUND: In Chile, significant reductions in cervical cancer incidence and 
mortality have been observed due to implementation of a well-organized screening 
program. However, it has been suggested that the inclusion of human 
papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination for young adolescent women may be the best 
prospect to further reduce the burden of cervical cancer. This 
cost-effectiveness study comparing two available HPV vaccines in Chile was 
performed to support decision making on the implementation of universal HPV 
vaccination.
METHODS: The present analysis used an existing static Markov model to assess the 
effect of screening and vaccination. This analysis includes the epidemiology of 
low-risk HPV types allowing for the comparison between the two vaccines 
(HPV-16/18 AS04-adjuvanted vaccine and the HPV-6/11/16/18 vaccine), latest 
cross-protection data on HPV vaccines, treatment costs for cervical cancer, 
vaccine costs and 6% discounting per the health economic guideline for Chile.
RESULTS: Projected incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR) and incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICERs) for the HPV-16/18 AS04-adjuvanted vaccine was 
116 United States (US) dollars per quality-adjusted life years (QALY) gained or 
147 US dollars per life-years (LY) saved, while the projected ICUR/ICER for the 
HPV-6/11/16/18 vaccine was 541 US dollars per QALY gained or 726 US dollars per 
LY saved. Introduction of any HPV vaccine to the present cervical cancer 
prevention program of Chile is estimated to be highly cost-effective (below 1X 
gross domestic product [GDP] per capita, 14278 US dollars). In Chile, the 
addition of HPV-16/18 AS04-adjuvanted vaccine to the existing screening program 
dominated the addition of HPV-6/11/16/18 vaccine. In the probabilistic 
sensitivity analysis results show that the HPV-16/18 AS04-adjuvanted vaccine is 
expected to be dominant and cost-saving in 69.3% and 77.6% of the replicates 
respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings indicate that the addition of any HPV vaccine to the 
current cervical screening program of Chile will be advantageous. However, this 
cost-effectiveness model shows that the HPV-16/18 AS04-adjuvanted vaccine 
dominated the HPV-6/11/16/18 vaccine. Beyond the context of Chile, the data from 
this modelling exercise may support healthcare policy and decision-making 
pertaining to introduction of HPV vaccination in similar resource settings in 
the region.

Pharmacy; University of Groningen; The Netherlands.

Herpes zoster (HZ) is a common disease among elderly, which may develop into a 
severe pain syndrome labeled postherpetic neuralgia (PHN). A live-attenuated 
varicella zoster virus vaccine has been shown to be effective in reducing the 
incidence and burden of illness of HZ and PHN, providing the opportunity to 
prevent significant health-related and financial consequences of HZ. In this 
review, we summarize the available literature on cost-effectiveness of HZ 
vaccination and discuss critical parameters for cost-effectiveness results. A 
search in PubMed and EMBASE was performed to identify full cost-effectiveness 
studies published before April 2013. Fourteen cost-effectiveness studies were 
included, all performed in western countries. All studies evaluated 
cost-effectiveness among elderly above 50 years and used costs per 
quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained as primary outcome. The vast majority 
of studies showed vaccination of 60- to 75-year-old individuals to be 
cost-effective, when duration of vaccine efficacy was longer than 10 years. 
Duration of vaccine efficacy, vaccine price, HZ incidence, HZ incidence and 
discount rates were influential to the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
(ICER). HZ vaccination may be a worthwhile intervention from a 
cost-effectiveness point of view. More extensive reporting on methodology and 
more detailed results of sensitivity analyses would be desirable to address 
uncertainty and to guarantee optimal comparability between studies, for example 
regarding model structure, discounting, vaccine characteristics and loss of 
quality of life due to HZ and PHN.

People with serious mental illness have reduced life expectancy compared with a 
control population, much of which is accounted for by significant physical 
comorbidity. Frontline clinical staff in mental health often lack confidence in 
recognition, assessment and management of such 'medical' problems. Simulation 
provides one way for staff to practise these skills in a safe setting. We 
produced a multidisciplinary simulation course around recognition and assessment 
of medical problems in psychiatric settings. We describe an audit of strategic 
and design aspects of the recognition and assessment of medical problems in 
psychiatric settings course, using the Department of Health's 'Framework for 
Technology Enhanced Learning' as our audit standards. At the same time as 
highlighting areas where recognition and assessment of medical problems in 
psychiatric settings adheres to these identified principles, such as the 
strategic underpinning of the approach, and the means by which information is 
collected, reviewed and shared, it also helps us to identify areas where we can 
improve.

OBJECTIVE: This 1-year study aimed to assess low-dose budesonide therapy for 
maintenance of clinical remission in patients with collagenous colitis.
DESIGN: A prospective, randomised, placebo-controlled study beginning with an 
8-week open-label induction phase in which patients with histologically 
confirmed active collagenous colitis received budesonide (Budenofalk, 9 mg/day 
initially, tapered to 4.5 mg/day), after which 92 patients in clinical remission 
were randomised to budesonide (mean dose 4.5 mg/day; Budenofalk 3 mg capsules, 
two or one capsule on alternate days) or placebo in a 12-month double-blind 
phase with 6 months treatment-free follow-up. Primary endpoint was clinical 
remission throughout the double-blind phase.
RESULTS: Clinical remission during open-label treatment was achieved by 84.5% 
(93/110 patients). The median time to remission was 10.5 days (95% CI (9.0 to 
14.0 days)). The maintenance of clinical remission at 1 year was achieved by 
61.4% (27/44 patients) in the budesonide group versus 16.7% (8/48 patients) 
receiving placebo (treatment difference 44.5% in favour of budesonide; 95% CI 
(26.9% to 62.7%), p<0.001). Health-related quality of life was maintained during 
the 12-month double-blind phase in budesonide-treated patients. During 
treatment-free follow-up, 82.1% (23/28 patients) formerly receiving budesonide 
relapsed after study drug discontinuation. Low-dose budesonide over 1 year 
resulted in few suspected adverse drug reactions (7/44 patients), all 
non-serious.
CONCLUSIONS: Budesonide at a mean dose of 4.5 mg/day maintained clinical 
remission for at least 1 year in the majority of patients with collagenous 
colitis and preserved health-related quality of life without safety concerns. 
Treatment extension with low-dose budesonide beyond 1 year may be beneficial 
given the high relapse rate after budesonide discontinuation.

The Nicoya region of Costa Rica: a high longevity island for elderly males.

Reliable data show that the Nicoyan region of Costa Rica is a hot spot of high 
longevity. A survival follow-up of 16,300 elderly Costa Ricans estimated a 
Nicoya death rate ratio (DRR) for males 1990-2011 of 0.80 (0.69-0.93 CI). For a 
60-year-old Nicoyan male, the probability of becoming centenarian is seven times 
that of a Japanese male, and his life expectancy is 2.2 years greater. This 
Nicoya advantage does not occur in females, is independent of socio-economic 
conditions, disappears in out-migrants and comes from lower cardiovascular (CV) 
mortality (DRR = 0.65). Nicoyans have lower levels of biomarkers of CV risk; 
they are also leaner, taller and suffer fewer disabilities. Two markers of 
ageing and stress-telomere length and dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate-are also 
more favourable. The Nicoya diet is prosaic and abundant in traditional foods 
like rice, beans and animal protein, with low glycemic index and high fibre 
content.

Clinical transplantation and tolerance: are we there yet?

School of Brown University, Providence, RI, USA.

Organ transplantation is not only considered as the last resort therapy but also 
as the treatment of choice for many patients with end-stage organ damage. 
Recipient-mediated acute or chronic immune response is the main challenge after 
transplant surgery. Nonspecific suppression of host immune system is currently 
the only method used to prevent organ rejection. Lifelong immunosuppression will 
cause significant side effects such as infections, malignancies, chronic kidney 
disease, hypertension and diabetes. This is more relevant in children who have a 
longer life expectancy so may receive longer period of immunosuppressive 
medications. Efforts to minimize or complete withdrawal of immunosuppression 
would improve the quality of life and long-term outcome of pediatric transplant 
recipients.

BACKGROUND: New evidence on the clinical effectiveness of acupuncture plus usual 
care (acupuncture) and counselling plus usual care (counselling) for patients 
with depression suggests the need to investigate the health-related quality of 
life and costs of these treatments to understand whether they should be 
considered a good use of limited health resources.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: The cost-effectiveness analyses are based on the 
Acupuncture, Counselling or Usual care for Depression (ACUDep) trial results. 
Statistical analyses demonstrate a difference in mean quality adjusted life 
years (QALYs) and suggest differences in mean costs which are mainly due to the 
price of the interventions. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis is used to 
express decision uncertainty. Acupuncture and counselling are found to have 
higher mean QALYs and costs than usual care. In the base case analysis 
acupuncture has an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of £4,560 per 
additional QALY and is cost-effective with a probability of 0.62 at a 
cost-effectiveness threshold of £20,000 per QALY. Counselling compared with 
acupuncture is more effective and more costly with an ICER of £71,757 and a 
probability of being cost-effective of 0.36. A scenario analysis of counselling 
versus usual care, excluding acupuncture as a comparator, results in an ICER of 
£7,935 and a probability of 0.91.
CONCLUSIONS: Acupuncture is cost-effective compared with counselling or usual 
care alone, although the ranking of counselling and acupuncture depends on the 
relative cost of delivering these interventions. For patients in whom
