BACKGROUND: This study estimates life expectancy with and without type 2 
diabetes for individuals in Lower Saxony, Germany in order to detect a trend in 
population health.
METHODS: Morbidity and mortality data derived from German administrative claims 
data (statutory health insurance, AOK Niedersachsen, N = 2,900,065) were used 
covering 10 years from 2005 to 2014. Life table analysis was applied for 
calculating life expectancy, life expectancy free of type 2 diabetes, life 
expectancy with type 2 diabetes, and the proportion of life expectancy free of 
diabetes to total life expectancy using the Sullivan method.
RESULTS: The total life expectancy increase is stronger in men than in women: At 
the age of 20, total life expectancy was 55.0 years in 2005 and 56.3 years in 
2014 for men, whereas it was 61.7 years in 2005 and 62.5 years in 2014 for 
women. Decreases in life expectancy without type 2 diabetes were more pronounced 
in women than in men. Accordingly, life expectancy with type 2 diabetes 
increased in both women and in men. The proportion of life expectancy without 
diabetes to total life expectancy decreased, indicating a similar development in 
both. For example, at the age of 60, the proportion of life expectancy without 
diabetes to total life expectancy decreased from 0.75 in 2005 to 0.66 in 2014 
for men, while it decreased from 0.77 in 2005 to 0.70 in 2014 for women.
CONCLUSIONS: Against the background of increasing total life expectancy, the 
time spent in morbidity increased for the case of type 2 diabetes in Lower 
Saxony, Germany.

In 1914, Progressive Era reformer Irving Fisher and wealthy contractor Harold 
Ley founded the Life Extension Institute (LEI), a business venture organized to 
address the problems of American health. For approximately two decades, from 
1914 until the death of its medical director in 1931, the Life Extension 
Institute widely promoted its health maintenance program of annual physical 
examinations and health literature. The advertised goal of the LEI was to extend 
life without old age, as well as improve masculinity and good business practices 
through adherence to health principles. The first two decades of activities of 
the Life Extension Institute offer a window for examining early twentiethcentury 
ideas about the relationships between health, old age, and masculinity. The LEI 
literature constructed a picture of healthy, vigorous, and efficient American 
working men that helped to cement ideals of masculinity to ideals of health.

Elucidating how life history traits vary geographically is important to 
understanding variation in population dynamics. Because many aspects of 
ectotherm life history are climate-dependent, geographic variation in climate is 
expected to have a large impact on population dynamics through effects on annual 
survival, body size, growth rate, age at first reproduction, size-fecundity 
relationship, and reproductive frequency. The Eastern Massasauga (Sistrurus 
catenatus) is a small, imperiled North American rattlesnake with a distribution 
centered on the Great Lakes region, where lake effects strongly influence local 
conditions. To address Eastern Massasauga life history data gaps, we compiled 
data from 47 study sites representing 38 counties across the range. We used 
multimodel inference and general linear models with geographic coordinates and 
annual climate normals as explanatory variables to clarify patterns of variation 
in life history traits. We found strong evidence for geographic variation in six 
of nine life history variables. Adult female snout-vent length and neonate mass 
increased with increasing mean annual precipitation. Litter size decreased with 
increasing mean temperature, and the size-fecundity relationship and growth 
prior to first hibernation both increased with increasing latitude. The 
proportion of gravid females also increased with increasing latitude, but this 
relationship may be the result of geographically varying detection bias. Our 
results provide insights into ectotherm life history variation and fill critical 
data gaps, which will inform Eastern Massasauga conservation efforts by 
improving biological realism for models of population viability and climate 
change.

BACKGROUND: Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) quantify the loss of healthy 
years of life due to dying prematurely and due to living with diseases and 
injuries. Current methods of attributing DALYs to underlying risk factors fall 
short on two main points. First, risk factor attribution methods often unjustly 
apply incidence-based population attributable fractions (PAFs) to 
prevalence-based data. Second, it mixes two conceptually distinct approaches 
targeting different goals, namely an attribution method aiming to attribute 
uniquely to a single cause, and an elimination method aiming to describe a 
counterfactual situation without exposure. In this paper we describe dynamic 
modeling as an alternative, completely counterfactual approach and compare this 
to the approach used in the Global Burden of Disease 2010 study (GBD2010).
METHODS: Using data on smoking in the Netherlands in 2011, we demonstrate how an 
alternative method of risk factor attribution using a pure counterfactual 
approach results in different estimates for DALYs. This alternative method is 
carried out using the dynamic multistate disease table model DYNAMO-HIA. We 
investigate the differences between our alternative method and the method used 
by the GBD2010 by doing additional analyses using data from a synthetic 
population in steady state.
RESULTS: We observed important differences between the outcomes of the two 
methods: in an artificial situation where dynamics play a limited role, DALYs 
are a third lower as compared to those calculated with the GBD2010 method 
(398,000 versus 607,000 DALYs). The most important factor is newly occurring 
morbidity in life years gained that is ignored in the GBD2010 approach. 
Age-dependent relative risks and exposures lead to additional differences 
between methods as they distort the results of prevalence-based DALY 
calculations, but the direction and magnitude of the distortions depend on the 
particular situation.
CONCLUSIONS: We argue that the GBD2010 approach is a hybrid of an attributional 
and counterfactual approach, making the end result hard to understand, while 
dynamic modelling uses a purely counterfactual approach and thus yields better 
interpretable results.

Malignant pleural effusion (MPE) is common in clinical practice, and despite the 
existence of studies to guide clinical decisions, it often poses diagnostic and 
therapeutic dilemmas. Once it is diagnosed, median survival does not usually 
exceed 6 months. The management of these patients focuses on symptom relief 
since no treatments have been shown to increase survival to date. Conversely, 
poor management can shorten survival. The approach must be multidisciplinary and 
allow for individualized care. Initial diagnostic procedures should be minimally 
invasive and, according to the results and other factors, procedures of 
increasing complexity will be selecting. Likewise, the treatment of MPEs should 
be individualized according to factors such as type of tumor, patient functional 
status, means available, benefits of each procedure, or life expectancy. 
Currently, treatment seems to tend toward less interventional approaches, in 
which patients can be managed on an outpatient basis, thus minimizing both the 
discomfort that more aggressive approaches involve and the costs of care 
associated with this disease. This article reviews the pleural procedures 
employed in the management of MPEs with special emphasis on the indication for 
each one, its usefulness, benefits, and complications.

This paper investigates the effect of corruption on health outcomes by using 
cross-country panel data covering about 150 countries for the period of 1995 to 
2012. We employ ordinary least squares (OLS), fixed-effects and two-stage least 
squares (2SLS) estimation methods, and find that corruption significantly 
increases mortality rates, and reduces life expectancy and immunization rates. 
The results are consistent across different regions, gender, and measures of 
corruption. The findings suggest that reducing corruption can be an effective 
method to improve health outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Chronic hepatitis B is a common, progressive disease, particularly 
when viral replication is detected. Oral antivirals can suppress viral 
replication and prevent or delay the development of cirrhosis and liver-related 
complications. The treatments of chronic hepatitis B cannot totally cure the 
disease but can prevent its progression to hepatocellular carcinoma, decreasing 
the levels of both morbidity and mortality. To date, there are several therapies 
indicated by the international guidelines as first-line treatments for the 
management of hepatitis B; two of the most effective are those based on either 
tenofovir or entecavir.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of 
tenofovir and entecavir in the treatment of naïve patients with chronic 
hepatitis B. The two treatments are compared with the "no treatment" and to one 
another.
METHODS: The cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted using a Markov model; 
patients entered one of the following health states: chronic hepatitis, 
cirrhosis (compensated or decompensated), hepatocellular carcinoma, liver 
transplantation or death. The analysis was carried out from the perspective of 
the Italian National Health Service by considering a life-time horizon with 
cycles lasting 1 year and with costs and QALYs (quality-adjusted life years) 
discounted at a rate of 3.5%. The results of the model were analysed in terms of 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER).
RESULTS: ICERs for tenofovir and entecavir emerging from the comparison versus 
"no treatment" were equal to €10,274.73 and €16,300.44 per QALY gained, 
respectively, on the life-time horizon. Tenofovir was dominant in the direct 
comparison with entecavir, indicating more QALYs and a lower consumption of 
resources. The Monte Carlo simulation demonstrated that in 97% (tenofovir) and 
in 85% (entecavir) of the scenarios performed, the cost per QALY fell below the 
threshold of €30,000/QALY. The budget impact analysis showed savings for 
tenofovir amounting to 33% compared to entecavir in the first year on treatment 
and to 31% in following years.
CONCLUSIONS: Entecavir and tenofovir are recommended for the treatment of 
patients with chronic Hepatitis B in the Italian Health System. In particular, 
tenofovir appeared to be the more cost-effective drug for the management of 
chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections. These results could help decision 
makers and clinicians to address their decision when choosing a first-line 
treatment for the management of people affected by chronic HBV.

Smoking is one of the major health threats and is highly prevalent in Korea. 
This study quantifies the burden of disease (BOD) resulting from smoking by 
using the most reliable national statistics of Korea. We followed Global Burden 
of Disease Study (GBD) 2013 methodology for estimating BOD attributable to 
smoking. Population attributable fraction was calculated for all diseases and 
multiplied by disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) to obtain BOD by each 
disease. Total burden of smoking in Korea was 1 368 072 DALYs (38 per 1000); 68% 
of the disease burden was in males and 32% in females. The highest percentage of 
burden was a result of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in both genders. 
BOD was highest in the 70- to 74-year-old age group. Smoking burden is 
substantial in Korea, especially among the elderly population. Tailored health 
plans for each gender and age should be formulated, and smoking-related burden 
should be continuously monitored to evaluate the extent of hazard and create 
priority settings.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The cost effectiveness of occupational therapy for 
subacute stroke patients is unclear in the extant literature. Consequently, this 
study determined the cost effectiveness of the occupation-based approach using 
Aid for Decision-Making in Occupation Choice (ADOC) for subacute stroke patients 
compared with an impairment-based approach.
METHODS: We conducted an economic evaluation from a societal perspective 
alongside a pilot randomized controlled trial, with a single blind assessor for 
participants in 10 subacute rehabilitation units in Japan. The intervention 
group received occupation-based goal setting using ADOC, with interventions 
focused on meaningful occupations. The control group received an 
impairment-based approach focused on restoring capacities. For both groups, 
occupational-therapy intervention was administered more than five times per 
week, for over 40 min each time, and they received physical and speech therapy 
prior to discharge. The main outcomes were quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) 
and total costs. Further, sensitivity analyses were performed to examine the 
influence of parameter uncertainty on the base case results.
RESULTS: The final number of participants was 24 in each of the two groups. In 
terms of QALYs, the intervention group is significantly higher than the control 
group (p = 0.001, difference 95% CI: 0.002-0.008) and total costs are not 
statistically significant. Applying a willingness-to-pay threshold of JPY 5 
million/QALY, the probability of the occupation-based approach using ADOC being 
cost effective was estimated to be 65.3%.
CONCLUSIONS: The results show that the occupation-based approach is associated 
with significantly improved QALYs and has potential cost effectiveness, compared 
with the impairment-based approach.

OBJECTIVES: Protest responses, whereby respondents refuse to state the value 
they place on the health gain, are commonly encountered in contingent valuation 
(CV) studies, and they tend to be excluded from analyses. Such an approach will 
be biased if protesters differ from non-protesters on characteristics that 
predict their responses. The Heckman selection model has been commonly used to 
adjust for protesters, but its underlying assumptions may be implausible in this 
context. We present a multiple imputation (MI) approach to appropriately address 
protest responses in CV studies, and compare it with the Heckman selection 
model.
METHODS: This study exploits data from the multinational EuroVaQ study, which 
surveyed respondents' willingness-to-pay (WTP) for a Quality Adjusted Life Year 
(QALY). Here, our simulation study assesses the relative performance of MI and 
Heckman selection models across different realistic settings grounded in the 
EuroVaQ study, including scenarios with different proportions of missing data 
and non-response mechanisms. We then illustrate the methods in the EuroVaQ study 
for estimating mean WTP for a QALY gain.
RESULTS: We find that MI provides lower bias and mean squared error compared 
with the Heckman approach across all considered scenarios. The simulations 
suggest that the Heckman approach can lead to considerable underestimation or 
overestimation of mean WTP due to violations in the normality assumption, even 
after log-transforming the WTP responses. The case study illustrates that 
protesters are associated with a lower mean WTP for a QALY gain compared with 
non-protesters, but that the results differ according to method for handling 
protesters.
CONCLUSIONS: MI is an appropriate method for addressing protest responses in CV 
studies.

Malignant or accelerated hypertension is the most severe form of hypertension, 
defined clinically by very high blood pressure (diastolic above 130 mm Hg) 
accompanied by bilateral retinal hemorrhages and/or exudates, with or without 
papilledema. The aim of this review is to discuss if malignant hypertension 
still poses a clinically relevant entity and to highlight the diagnostic 
challenges of this form of hypertension. The substantial improvement in 
prognosis in patients with malignant hypertension over the last decades is well 
documented, but there is no strong evidence to suggest a significant change in 
its incidence. In fact, with the growing population and improving life 
expectancy, malignant hypertension is likely to become even more prevalent 
worldwide, especially in the developing countries with less advanced health care 
services. Despite simple diagnostic criteria of malignant hypertension, the 
diagnoses may be difficult in many patients. Malignant hypertension patients 
often have the diagnosis established only when the target organ damage occur. 
Furthermore, retrospective diagnosis is problematic, as malignant hypertensive 
retinopathy gradually resolves over a relatively short period of time, while 
persistent target organ damage will, however, lead to the development of 
complications and much poorer prognosis than in nonmalignant hypertension 
patients. Certainly, malignant hypertension still poses a clinically relevant 
and challenging form of hypertension and its possibility should be always 
considered during the assessment of patients with poorly controlled 
hypertension.

study.

General population-based studies, the chronic kidney disease (CKD) prognosis 
consortium and renal registries worldwide have contributed to the description of 
the scale of CKD as a public health problem. Since 1990, CKD has been included 
in the list of non-communicable diseases investigated by the Global Burden of 
Disease (GBD) study. The GBD represents a systematic, high-quality, scientific 
effort to quantify the comparative magnitude of health loss from all major 
diseases, injuries and risk factors. This article provides an outline of the 
place of CKD in the ranking of these diseases and the change over time. Whereas 
age-standardized death and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) rates due to 
non-communicable diseases in general have been declining, such favourable trends 
do not exist for CKD. Altogether the GBD reports indicate increasing rates for 
death and DALYs due to CKD with huge variation across the globe. A substantial 
component of the observed increase in mortality attributable to CKD relates to 
that caused by diabetes mellitus and hypertension. For the increase in DALYs, 
CKD due to diabetes mellitus appears to be the main contributor. It is possible 
that these trends are in part due to new data becoming available or different 
coding behaviour over time, including greater specificity of coding. Although 
some feel there is evidence of overdiagnosis, it seems clear that in many 
regions CKD and its risk factors are a growing public health problem and in some 
of them rank very high as cause of years of life lost and DALYs. Therefore, 
public health policies to address this problem as well as secondary prevention 
in high-risk groups remain greatly needed.

CONTEXT: Osteoporosis is a frequent disease in many populations. The hallmark is 
fragility fractures, which are harbingers of future fractures, disability, 
mortality and cost on society. The occurrence increases with age, low vitamin D 
level and smoking. Smoking rates are high, vitamin D is low and life expectancy 
is rising steeply in Greenland, as is the need for focus on osteoporosis. We 
report a case that uses a simple and readily available tool to diagnose 
osteoporosis at the hospital in Sisimiut, a town of 5000 inhabitants on the west 
coast of Greenland.
ISSUES: A 51-year-old Inuit woman was seen due to lower back pain. No trauma 
could be recalled. Laboratory results showed a low vitamin D level and normal 
S-calcium, S-phosphate, S-parathyroid hormone, S-thyrotropin, erythrocyte 
sedimentation rate, S-creatinine and hemoglobin. The lateral chest radiograph 
demonstrated a reduction of anterior height of the seventh and ninth thoracic 
vertebral bodies of 50% and 40% respectively.
LESSONS LEARNED: Chest radiographs are frequently done in the towns along the 
vast coastline of Greenland, the world's largest island. They are transferred to 
the hospital in the capital city Nuuk using existing tele-technology, and 
specialist evaluations are given in electronic records available at the coastal 
hospitals. Effective therapies for osteoporosis are available and the 
identification of vertebral fractures that merit treatment may prevent future 
fractures, morbidity and mortality. Fragility fractures are frequent in old age 
and the steep rise in life expectancy and in the number of old people in 
Greenland emphasize the need for a focus on management of osteoporosis. 
Geography provides a diagnostic challenge to rural and remote areas that can be 
overcome by the use of lateral chest radiographs as it relies on facilities 
readily available. Clinical risk assessment tools with high specificity may 
support further osteoporosis risk prediction in remote Arctic societies.

BACKGROUND: Information and theory beyond copula concepts are essential to 
understand the dependence relationship between several marginal covariates 
distributions. In a therapeutic trial data scheme, most of the time, censoring 
occurs. That could lead to a biased interpretation of the dependence 
relationship between marginal distributions. Furthermore, it could result in a 
biased inference of the joint probability distribution function. A particular 
case is the cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA), which has shown its utility in 
many medico-economic studies and where censoring often occurs.
METHODS: This paper discusses a copula-based modeling of the joint density and 
an estimation method of the costs, and quality adjusted life years (QALY) in a 
cost-effectiveness analysis in case of censoring. This method is not based on 
any linearity assumption on the inferred variables, but on a punctual estimation 
obtained from the marginal distributions together with their dependence link.
RESULTS: Our results show that the proposed methodology keeps only the bias 
resulting statistical inference and don't have anymore a bias based on a 
unverified linearity assumption. An acupuncture study for chronic headache in 
primary care was used to show the applicability of the method and the obtained 
ICER keeps in the confidence interval of the standard regression methodology.
CONCLUSION: For the cost-effectiveness literature, such a technique without any 
linearity assumption is a progress since it does not need the specification of a 
global linear regression model. Hence, the estimation of the a marginal 
distributions for each therapeutic arm, the concordance measures between these 
populations and the right copulas families is now sufficient to process to the 
whole CEA.

BACKGROUND: The burden of chronic disease and multimorbidity is rapidly 
increasing. Self-management support interventions are effective in reduce cost, 
especially when targeted at a single disease group; however, economical evidence 
of such complex interventions remains scarce. The objective of this study was to 
evaluate a cost-effectiveness analysis of a tele-based health-coaching 
intervention among patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D), coronary artery disease 
(CAD) and congestive heart failure (CHF).
METHODS: A total of 1570 patients were blindly randomized to intervention 
(n = 970) and control (n = 470) groups. The intervention group received monthly 
individual health coaching by telephone from a specially trained nurse for 
12-months in addition to routine social and healthcare. Patients in the control 
group received routine social and health care. Quality of life was assessed at 
the beginning of the intervention and follow-up measurements were made after 
12 months health coaching. The cost included all direct health-care costs 
supplemented with home care and nursing home-care costs in social care. Utility 
was based on a Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) measurement (15D 
instrument), and cost effectiveness was assessed using incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs).
RESULTS: The cost-effectiveness of health coaching was highest in the T2D group 
(ICER €20,000 per Quality-Adjusted Life Years [QALY]). The ICER for the CAD 
group was more modest (€40,278 per QALY), and in the CHF group, costs increased 
with no marked effect on QoL. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis indicated that 
at the societal willingness to pay threshold of €50,000 per QALY, the 
probability of health coaching being cost effective was 55% in the whole study 
group.
CONCLUSIONS: The cost effectiveness of health coaching may vary substantially 
across patient groups, and thus interventions should be targeted at selected 
subgroups of chronically ill. Based on the results of this study, health 
coaching improved the QoL of T2D and CAD patients with moderate costs. However, 
the results are grounded on a short follow-up period, and more evidence is 
needed to evaluate the long-term outcomes of health-coaching programs.

Central-line bloodstream infection (CLABSI) increases hospital mortality. A 
cohort study was conducted in a Brazilian hospital to estimate the 
disability-adjusted life year (DALY) of CLABSI using modified World Health 
Organization (WHO) methodology. CLABSI DALY was 20.44 per 1,000 inpatients, most 
were the result of premature death (20.42 per 1,000 inpatients). DALY can be 
useful to guide and measure the impact of healthcare infection prevention.

Economic evaluation of drugs is used in decision-making on medical care and 
public policy. Recently, real-world data (RWD) have been used in the analysis. 
In this study, we discuss the risk and benefits of using RWD for economic 
evaluation. We conducted a cost-outcome description with RWD from a nationwide 
registry providing information on hepatitis treatment in Japan and estimated the 
utility of the analysis. We evaluated the cost-outcome description of 
peginterferon plus ribavirin (PEG-IFN-α2b+RBV) treatment in hepatitis C virus 
(HCV)-infected patients. Simulations were based on a Markov model. The cohorts 
were set using data from the registry and we assumed a societal perspective for 
the calculation of costs. The dose and drug cost were chosen based on the 
Japanese Guidelines for the Management of Hepatitis C Virus Infection or package 
inserts. Model details and parameters were as described in previous studies. The 
simulations were performed for a period of 10 years with no discount rate. We 
estimated 2.5 million JPY per Quality Adjusted Life Year (QALY) in 48-week 
PEG-IFN-α2b+RBV treatment for a period of 10 years. The results of this study 
are in agreement with previous HCV treatment economic evaluation studies in 
Japan. We analyzed the statistics of the HCV-infected patients at each disease 
stage using the data in our registry and calculated the costs. The results of 
this study more closely reflect a real-world clinical situation compared to the 
widely used randomized clinical trial method, which estimates clinical trial 
results and scenarios.

Liver transplantation is an option that improves quality of life and prolongs 
life expectancy in patients with different types of liver disease. Liver 
transplantation is controversial for colorectal metastases and is not 
recommended in clinical practice guidelines. In this case report, we present, to 
our knowledge, the first liver transplantation for colorectal metastases 
conducted in Colombia, with a successful follow-up of more than 2 years. 
Patients with these characteristics who underwent liver transplantation 
experience reduced mortality and exponentially improved quality of life.

Polypharmacy and inappropriate medication use in patients with dementia: an 
underresearched problem.

7BL, UK.

Multimorbidity and polypharmacy are increasingly prevalent across healthcare 
systems and settings as global demographic trends shift towards increased 
proportions of older people in populations. Numerous studies have demonstrated 
an association between polypharmacy and potentially inappropriate prescribing 
(PIP), and have reported high prevalence of PIP across settings of care in 
Europe and North America and, as a consequence, increased risk of adverse drug 
reactions, healthcare utilization, morbidity and mortality. These studies have 
not focused specifically on people with dementia, despite the high risk of 
adverse drug reactions and PIP in this patient cohort. This narrative review 
considers the evidence currently available in the area, including studies 
examining prevalence of PIP in older people with dementia, how appropriateness 
of prescribing is assessed, the medications most commonly implicated, the 
clinical consequences, and research priorities to optimize prescribing for this 
vulnerable patient group. Although there has been a considerable research effort 
to develop criteria to assess medication appropriateness in older people in 
recent years, the majority of tools do not focus on people with dementia. Of the 
limited number of tools available, most focus on the advanced stages of dementia 
in which life expectancy is limited. The development of tools to assess 
medication appropriateness in people with mild to moderate dementia or across 
the full spectrum of disease severity represents an important gap in the 
research literature and is beginning to attract research interest, with recent 
studies considering the medication regimen as a whole, or misprescribing, 
overprescribing or underprescribing of certain medications/medication classes, 
including anticholinergics, psychotropics, antibiotics and analgesics. Further 
work is required in development and validation of criteria to assess prescribing 
appropriateness in this vulnerable patient population, to determine prevalence 
of PIP in large cohorts of people with the full spectrum of dementia variants 
and severities, and to examine the impact of PIP on health outcomes.

Lifespan research investigates the development of individuals over the course of 
life. As medical rehabilitation deals with primary and secondary prophylaxis, 
treatment, and compensation of chronic illnesses, a lifespan perspective is 
needed for the classification and diagnosis of chronic disorders, the assessment 
of course modifying factors, the identification of vulnerable life periods and 
critical incidents, the implementation of preventive measures, the development 
of methods for the evaluation of prior treatments, the selection and 
prioritization of interventions, including specialized inpatient rehabilitation, 
the coordination of therapies and therapists, and for evaluations in social and 
forensic medicine. Due to the variety of individual risk constellations, illness 
courses and treatment situations across the lifespan, personalized medicine is 
especially important in the context of medical rehabilitation, which takes into 
consideration hindering and fostering factors alike.

INTRODUCTION: Surgical management for lumbar stenosis is generally safe and 
provides significant improvements in pain, disability, and function. Successful 
lumbar decompression hinges on removing an appropriate amount of lamina and 
other compressive pathology in the lateral recess. Too little bony decompression 
can result in persistent pain and disability, while over resection of the pars 
and/or facets may jeopardize spinal stability.
CASE REPORT: In this unique report, we present for the first time an acute 
iatrogenic grade 4 L5-S1 spondylolisthesis distal to a L3-5 laminectomy and 
circumferential instrumented fusion due to bilateral iatrogenic L5 pars 
fractures and its management and clinical outcomes after revision operation. The 
patient presented with worsening pain, neurologic compromise, and severe 
sagittal imbalance. The iatrogenic, high-grade spondylolisthesis was urgently 
addressed with a L5-S1 anterior lumbar interbody fusion and extension of 
posterior instrumentation to the pelvis, which resulted in considerable pain 
relief, resolution of neurologic deficits, and reconstitution of acceptable 
sagittal imbalance.
CONCLUSION: All attempts during a lumbar decompression should be made to prevent 
iatrogenic pars fractures, as they may result in severe sagittal imbalance, 
neurologic compromise, and persistent disability. Iatrogenic, high-grade L5-S1 
spondylolisthesis can be successfully treated with reduction using 
circumferential fusion of the lumbosacral junction.
