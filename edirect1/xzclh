The aim was to study the variation trends of all-cause and cancer mortality 
during 1984⁻2013 in Macheng City, China. The mortality data were collected from 
Macheng City disease surveillance points system and Hubei Center for Disease 
Control and Prevention. The model life table system was used to adjust mortality 
rates due to an under-reporting problem. An age-period-cohort model and 
intrinsic estimator algorithm were used to estimate the age effect, period 
effect, and cohort effect of all-cause mortality and cancer mortality for males 
and females. Age effect of all-cause mortality for both sexes increased with 
age, while the age effect of cancer mortality for both sexes reached a peak at 
the age group of 55⁻59 years old and then decreased. The relative risks (RRs) of 
all-cause mortality for males and females declined with the period and decreased 
by 51.13% and 63.27% during the whole study period, respectively. Furthermore, 
the period effect of cancer mortality in both sexes decreased at first and then 
increased. The cohort effect of all-cause and cancer mortality for both sexes 
born after 1904 presented the pattern of "rise first and then fall," and 
decreased by 82.18% and 90.77% from cohort 1904⁻1908 to 1989⁻1993, respectively; 
especially, the risk of all-cause and cancer mortality for both sexes born 
before 1949 was much higher than that for those born after 1949.

BACKGROUND: People are living longer than they were expected to 2 decades ago. 
Increased life expectancy and reduced mortality encompasses a simultaneous 
increase in the number of older adults with obesity that entails an increase of 
co-morbidities, such as diabetes, hypertension, cancer, and many other diseases. 
The aim of our study was to compare the outcomes of bariatric surgery in 
patients age ≥65 in comparison with younger patients.
METHODS: This retrospective study compares bariatric surgeries performed in a 
private institution between the years 2013 and 2015. The study included 9044 
patients divided into an older group (451 patients) and the younger group (8593 
patients).
RESULTS: In the younger group, bariatric surgery is distributed as follows: 
77.68% sleeve gastrectomy, 12.72% gastric banding, 9.27% gastric bypass, and 
.33% duodenal switch or biliopancreatic diversion; in the older group: 70.51% 
sleeve gastrectomy, 15.08% gastric bypass, 13.97% gastric band, and .44% 
biliopancreatic diversion. In the control group 550 cases (6.4%) underwent 
revisional surgery; 64 cases (14.10%) underwent revision in the older group. 
Older patients lost less excess weight than younger patients (72.44% versus 
86.11%, respectively). Older patients presented higher rates of complications 
(8.42% versus 5.59%), co-morbidities (77.60% versus 55.45%), and revisions 
(1.33% versus .77%). There was no statistical difference in hospital stay 
between older group and control group (2.27 versus 2.23, respectively). When 
performing a Clavien-Dindo classification, we demonstrated significant 
differences in class 3B and 4A and no differences in other classes. Two deaths 
occurred in the control group. Diabetes, fatty liver, and sleep apnea have been 
improved or remitted in >90% of patients in both groups, hypertension and 
hyperlipidemia by >80%, and hyperuricemia and ischemic heart disease were 
improved or resolved in >70% of the patients CONCLUSIONS: Bariatric surgery in 
the elderly has more complications, but it can still be considered safe.

IMPORTANCE: Androgenetic alopecia is a highly prevalent condition across both 
sexes and can be surgically corrected through hair transplant. Health utility 
scores, which represent quantitative estimates of individual preferences for a 
given state of health, are a measure of health-related quality of life. The 
health utility scores for sex-specific alopecia and the posttransplant state 
have not previously been quantified.
OBJECTIVE: To obtain health utility measurements for the objective assessment of 
sex-specific alopecia and hair transplant surgery and to analyze layperson 
perception of alopecia compared with other chronic health conditions.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A prospective clinical study was conducted 
from August 1 to December 31, 2017, at the Harvard Decision Science Laboratory. 
Adult casual observers (n = 308) completed an internet-based health utility 
questionnaire. Health states were presented using still patient images and a 
description of 5 health states, including monocular blindness, binocular 
blindness, male alopecia, female alopecia, and male posttransplant state.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Health utility measures of sex-specific alopecia, 
posttransplant state, and monocular and binocular blindness were measured by 
visual analog scale (VAS), standard gamble (SG), and time trade-off (TTO) in 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Groups were analyzed with 1-way analysis of 
variance and post hoc Tukey pairwise comparison.
RESULTS: The 308 participants included 157 (51.0%) women with a mean (SD) age of 
30.8 (13.5) years. Mean (SD) health utility measures included 0.85 (0.18) QALYs 
for the VAS, 0.93 (0.17) QALYs for the SG, and 0.93 (0.17) QALYs for the TTO in 
male alopecia; 0.83 (0.19) QALYs for the VAS, 0.92 (0.17) QALYs for the SG, and 
0.91 (0.18) QALYs for the TTO in female alopecia; and 0.93 (0.11) QALYs for the 
VAS, 0.95 (0.15) QALYs for the SG, and 0.95 (0.16) QALYs for the TTO in a man in 
the posttransplant state. The mean (SD) health utility of monocular blindness 
was 0.76 (0.17) QALYs for the VAS, 0.87 (0.21) QALYs for the SG, and 0.86 (0.20) 
QALYs for the TTO. The health utility score for the posttransplant state was 
significantly improved compared with the health utility score for alopecia in 
both sexes (female VAS: +0.10 [95% CI, 0.06-0.14; P < .001]; male VAS, +0.08 
[95% CI, 0.04-0.12; P < .001]). Hair loss in women and men demonstrated 
significantly lower QALYs on the VAS compared with the posttransplant state 
(female: -0.10 [95% CI, -0.14 to -0.06; P < .001]; male: -0.08 [95% CI, -0.12 to 
-0.04; P < .001]).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Alopecia has a meaningful negative influence on 
health utility measures in both sexes. Hair transplant surgery significantly 
increases health utility measures compared with untreated alopecia in both sexes 
as rated among layperson observers.

Worldwide, musculoskeletal (MSK) disorders are the second cause of living with 
disability. According to our data, in Mexico, MSK conditions are an important 
cause of disability, at national and state level. Preventive actions promoted by 
health systems to reduce the burden of MSK disorders are essential.
INTRODUCTION: We describe premature mortality and disability due to 
musculoskeletal (MSK) disorders in Mexico at national and state level from 1990 
to 2016.
METHODS: Using data from the global burden of disease study 2016 (GBD 2016), we 
present rates and trends in years of life lost (YLLs), years lived with 
disability (YLDs), and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) caused by MSK 
disorders in Mexico by state from 1990 to 2016. The burden of MSK disorders was 
computed using standard GBD methodology. To compare the burden of MSK disorders 
across the country, states were grouped by sociodemographic index (SDI).
RESULTS: In Mexico, MSK disorders were the 3rd and 17th greatest cause of YLDs 
and YLLs in 2016, respectively, accounting for 1.95 million (95% UI 1.4-2.5) 
DALYs. Among all MSK disorders, low back and neck pain had the highest all-ages 
DALYs rate and represented 3.6% of total DALYs. All-ages YLLs and YLDs rates of 
MSK disorders were 234 and 37% higher in females (YLLs 102.2, 95% UI 79.9-110.7; 
YLDs 1677.9, 95% UI 1213.5-2209.4) than in males (YLLs 30.6, 95% UI 28.3-34.0; 
YLDs 1224.7, 95% UI 887.2-1608.3), respectively. Northern and high SDI states 
had higher rates of MSK disorders in comparison with southern and low SDI 
states. Only 16% of YLDs caused by all MSK disorders could be attributed to risk 
factors currently assessed in GBD.
CONCLUSION: MSK conditions are an important cause of premature mortality and 
disability. Researcher engagement and cross-sectorial actions to address the 
burden of MSK disorders are essential.

This article presents an assessment of individual uncertainty about longevity. A 
survey performed on 3,331 French people enables us to record several survival 
probabilities per individual. On this basis, we compute subjective life 
expectancies (SLE) and subjective uncertainty regarding longevity (SUL), the 
standard deviation of each individual's subjective distribution of her or his 
own longevity. It is large and equal to more than 10 years for men and women. 
Its magnitude is comparable to the variability of longevity observed in life 
tables for individuals under 60, but it is smaller for those older than 60, 
which suggests use of private information by older respondents. Our econometric 
analysis confirms that individuals use private information-mainly their parents' 
survival and longevity-to adjust their level of uncertainty. Finally, we find 
that SUL has a sizable impact, in addition to SLE, on risky behaviors: more 
uncertainty on longevity significantly decreases the probability of unhealthy 
lifestyles. Given that individual uncertainty about longevity affects prevention 
behavior, retirement decisions, and demand for long-term care insurance, these 
results have important implications for public policy concerning health care and 
retirement.

The clinical use of recombinant interferons (rIFNs) is limited by higher 
purification cost and quick clearance from circulation. Elastin-like 
polypeptides (ELPs) are a novel tag for recombinant protein purification and 
half-life extension. In this study, we evaluated the feasibility of ELP fusion 
for simple purification and half-life extension of recombinant porcine IFNs 
(rPoIFNs). After construction of five different fusion expression vectors, we 
optimized the conditions for soluble protein expression and purification. 
SDS-PAGE analysis showed that, unlike PoIFNα-His and PoIFNγ-His, PoIFNα-ELP, 
ELP-PoIFNα and PoIFNαγ-ELP were expressed mainly as soluble proteins at 20 ℃. 
The optimal conditions for the inverse transition cycling (ITC) of three ELP 
fusion proteins were 2 M NaCl at 28 ℃. After two rounds of ITC, the three ELP 
fusion proteins were purified to more than 90% purities, which were comparable 
to that of affinity-purified PoIFNα-His and PoIFNγ-His. Cytopathic effect 
inhibition assay showed that the five rPoIFNs had potent but different antiviral 
activities against two different viruses on two different cell types. The plasma 
solubility assay showed that the three ELP-fused rPoIFNs remained as soluble 
proteins under the physical conditions. The plasma stability of three ELP-fused 
rPoIFNs was significantly improved in comparison with that of PoIFN-α. These 
data suggest that ELP fusion is a feasible strategy to enhance purification and 
plasma stability of rPoIFNs.

BACKGROUND: Motor neurone disease (MND) is the term for a group of progressive, 
debilitating, neurodegenerative disorders that affect various aspects of a 
patient's life, including speech, swallowing, breathing and limb function.
OBJECTIVE: This review outlines the common symptoms and issues in MND and the 
latest available treatment options. A multidisciplinary approach to MND, 
involving the general practitioner (GP) and rehabilitation, palliative care and 
allied health services, is discussed.
DISCUSSION: The complexity of care for patients with MND and their families is 
best managed using a multidisciplinary team approach, with the GP as an 
important member of that team. The biopsychosocial care model discussed can 
improve the quality of life for patients and carers, as well as the 
life expectancy of patients with MND.

INTRODUCTION: Despite the popularity and analytical relevance of the concept of 
successful aging, little efforts have been made to address its relationship to 
sexuality in older individuals.
AIM: To explore the relationship between successful aging and the 
(retrospectively assessed) change in sexual interest and enjoyment in the past 
10 years, using a new multidimensional model of successful aging.
METHODS: The data for this study was collected in 2016 using national 
probability-based surveys in four European countries (Norway, Denmark, Belgium 
and Portugal). In total, information from 2,461 sexually active and inactive 
participants aged 60-75 years was used for analyses. Multigroup structural 
equation analysis was employed to address the associations between key 
constructs.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The dependent variable was a composite (two-item) 
indicator of change in sexual interest and enjoyment in the past 10 years; a 
multifaceted model of successful aging predicted the change by country and 
gender.
RESULTS: Tested cross-culturally, the proposed model of successful aging 
demonstrated a good fit to the data. Furthermore, its metric characteristics 
enabled direct comparisons across gender and national cultures. Controlling for 
sociodemographic characteristics, higher successful aging scores were 
consistently related to lower reduction in sexual interest/enjoyment among men 
and women across the 4 countries.
CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Given an increased life-expectancy and focus on healthy 
aging in many countries, the findings about the associations between sexual 
expression, quality of life and aging well are valuable to professionals working 
in the area of healthy sexual aging.
STRENGTH & LIMITATIONS: This is the first study to systematically address the 
relationship between successful aging and sexuality. Furthermore, it provides a 
multidimensional measure of successful aging for a wide range of sexologic 
studies. Among limitations, possible self-selection bias (toward more sexually 
permissive and sexually active participants) and the fact that the findings are 
restricted to older heterosexual individuals, should be considered.
CONCLUSION: Without stigmatizing the absence of sexual expression in aging 
individuals, the findings from this cross-cultural study point out that 
sustained sexual interest and sexual enjoyment are linked to successful aging in 
both genders. Štulhofer A, Hinchliff S, Jurin T, Hald GM, Træen B. Successful 
Aging and Changes in Sexual Interest and Enjoyment Among Older European Men and

PURPOSE: To estimate state-level diabetes-attributable deaths and years of life 
lost (YLL) in the Unites States.
METHODS: We estimated diabetes-attributable all-cause and cardiovascular disease 
(CVD) deaths by age, sex, and state, using the attributable fraction approach. 
Data on diabetes prevalence were collected from Behavioral Risk Factor 
Surveillance System. Relative risks for people with and without diabetes were 
estimated using the National Health Interview Survey. State-sex-age-specific 
deaths were obtained from CDC WONDER. YLL were calculated by multiplying the 
number of people with diabetes by the difference in life expectancy between 
people with and without diabetes using the life table approach.
RESULTS: Nationally, estimated diabetes-attributable all-cause deaths and CVD 
deaths were 293,224 and 90,953, respectively. Diabetes resulted in a total of 
109,707,000 YLL with an average 4.4 years of life lost per person with diabetes. 
Most state variation in total deaths was explained by state population size and 
diabetes prevalence. All-cause deaths ranged from 415 in Alaska to 28,538 in 
California, and CVD deaths ranged from 113 in Alaska to 8908 in California. 
Across all states, the average diabetes-attributable death rate per 100,000 was 
125 for males and 105 for females for all-cause deaths and 40 for males and 31 
for females for CVD deaths.
CONCLUSIONS: Mortality attributable to diabetes is greatly underestimated when 
looking only at diabetes listed as an underlying cause of death. These results 
can be used to track state differences in deaths due to diabetes and to monitor 
the success of public health activities.

BACKGROUND: Time trade-off, standard gamble, and willingness to pay assess the 
number of years, risk of death, and income a patient would give up for perfect 
health. These questions were used to evaluate the impact knee arthritis, hip 
arthritis, or failed total knee (TKA) or hip arthroplasty (THA) has on patients' 
health-related quality of life prior to surgery.
METHODS: Three hundred sixty patients including 176 undergoing primary TKA, 127 
undergoing primary THA, 31 undergoing revision TKA, and 26 undergoing revision 
THA were assessed. Time trade-off and standard gamble were converted to utility 
scores with 1.0 suggesting perfect health and 0 suggesting preference for death 
rather than living in current state. Willingness to pay is the percentage of 
yearly income that a patient would pay for perfect health.
RESULTS: The mean time trade-off, standard gamble, and willingness to pay scores 
were 0.74, 0.83, and 0.32 without significant difference between procedures with 
the numbers available for study (P = .16, .31, and 0.41, respectively). 
Increasing body mass index was correlated with decreasing time trade-off scores 
(P = .014).
CONCLUSION: Patients scheduled for primary or revision THA and TKA would accept 
an average 17% risk of death, lose 2.6 years of an additional 10-year life 
expectancy, and pay 32% of their income for perfect health. The time trade-off 
(0.74) was similar to patients with history of acute myocardial infarction 
(0.74) or minor stroke (0.72) and worse than those with chronic hepatitis C 
(0.83) or human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome 
infection (0.86). These data highlight the high value that patients place on 
adult reconstructive procedures.

OBJECTIVE: To document life expectancy and causes of death in 
chorea-acanthocytosis (ChAc) and McLeod syndrome (MLS).
METHODS: We reviewed our personal databases and the published literature to 
identify cases of ChAc and MLS for whom adequate information was available 
regarding ages of disease onset and death, cause of death, and other clinical 
information.
RESULTS: Adequate information was obtained on 52 patients with ChAc and 34 with 
MLS. Causes of death included pneumonia, cardiac disease, seizure, suicide, and 
sepsis. Mean disease duration from diagnosis was 11 years for ChAc, while for 
MLS it was 21 years.
CONCLUSIONS: Given the current data, causes of death in ChAc and MLS are similar 
to those for the phenotypically similar Huntington's disease, with additional 
risks due to the presence of seizures and cardiac disease. Suicidality was seen 
in 10% of patients with ChAc. Identifying causes of mortality is valuable for 
disease management and ultimately for clinical trials. In the absence of 
disease-modifying agents, disease management should focus upon treating symptoms 
which may contribute to morbidity.

As part of its Single Technology Appraisal process, the UK National Institute 
for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) invited the manufacturer of ibrutinib 
(Janssen) to submit evidence on the clinical effectiveness and cost 
effectiveness of ibrutinib for the treatment of relapsed or refractory (R/R) 
mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). The School of Health and Related Research Technology 
Assessment Group at the University of Sheffield was commissioned to act as the 
independent Evidence Review Group (ERG). The ERG produced a critical review of 
the evidence contained within the company's submission to NICE. The clinical 
effectiveness evidence for ibrutinib included one randomised controlled trial 
comparing ibrutinib and temsirolimus and two single-arm studies. The company's 
indirect comparison of ibrutinib versus rituximab plus chemotherapy (R-chemo) 
produced a hazard ratio (HR) for progression-free survival (PFS) of 0.28. The 
ERG's random effects network meta-analysis (NMA) indicated that the treatment 
effect on PFS was highly uncertain (HR 0.27; 95% credible interval (CrI) 
0.06-1.26). The company's Markov model assessed the cost effectiveness of 
ibrutinib versus R-chemo for the treatment of R/R MCL from the perspective of 
the National Health Service (NHS) and Personal Social Services over a lifetime 
horizon. Based on a re-run of the company's model by the ERG, the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for ibrutinib versus R-chemo [including the 
company's original patient access scheme (PAS)] was expected to be £76,014 per 
quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. The ERG had several concerns regarding 
the company's model structure and the evidence used to inform its parameters. 
The ERG's preferred analysis, which used the ERG's NMA and the observed 
Kaplan-Meier curve for time to ibrutinib discontinuation and excluded long-term 
disutilities for R-chemo, produced ICERs of £63,340 per QALY gained for the 
overall R/R MCL population and of £44,711 per QALY gained for patients with one 
prior treatment. Following an updated PAS and consideration of evidence from a 
later data-cut of the RAY trial, the appraisal committee concluded that the most 
plausible ICER for the one prior treatment subgroup was likely to be lower than 
the company's estimate of £49,848 per QALY gained. The company's ICER for the 
overall R/R MCL population was higher, at £62,650 per QALY gained. The committee 
recommended ibrutinib as an option for treating R/R MCL in adults only if they 
have received only one previous line of therapy and the company provides 
ibrutinib with the discount agreed in the commercial access agreement with NHS 
England.

BACKGROUND: The rate of pacemaker (PM) implantations is constantly growing. 
Since life expectancy of the population is projected to increase, a large number 
of nonagenarian patients will need PM implantation. We aimed at analyzing short- 
and long-term outcomes after PM implantation in nonagenarians.
METHODS: Patients aged ≥90 years referred for PM implantation from 2004 to 2017 
were included. The primary clinical endpoint was total mortality. Secondary 
endpoints included procedure-related and in-hospital complications.
RESULTS: A total of 172 patients were included (92.6 ± 2.1 years, from 90.0 to 
101.4 years). Procedure duration was 50.0 ± 19.7 minutes. Most of the patients 
had VVI devices implanted (143 pts, 83.1%) and mean hospital stay was 3.5 ± 1.5 
days. Nine patients (5.2%) had short-term device-related complications and 29 
patients (16.8%) had post-procedural complications, non-related to the 
implantation, including four leading to patients' death. During a follow-up of 
22.5 months (interquartile range: 7.3-38.0), 94 patients (54.7%) died. Survival 
rates were 82.9% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 76.0-88.0), 73.7% (95% CI: 
65.7-80.1) and 37.5% (95% CI: 27.5-47.5) after 1, 2, and 5 years, respectively. 
The Charlson comorbidity index was a predictive factor of procedural 
complications (odds ratio = 1.33; 95% CI: 1.05-1.69, P = 0.02) while having a 
complication (hazard ratio [HR] = 4.04; 95% CI: 1.79-9.11, P = 0.001) and atrial 
fibrillation (HR = 1.63; 95% CI: [1.02-2.63], P = 0.043) were predictors of 
post-implantation death.
CONCLUSION: PM implantation in nonagenarians is safe, with a low risk of 
procedural complications, but many comorbidities-related complications can 
occur. Caution should be taken in this old and frail population since 
complications significantly impact patients' survival.

Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is the most common genetic cause of infant 
mortality. SMA is a spectral disorder and is categorised based on symptom onset 
and severity. The median life expectancy for infants with SMA presenting before 
6 months of age is less than 2 years without respiratory support. To date, there 
is no cure for SMA. In June 2017, nusinersen was approved in Canada as the first 
disease-modifying drug for SMA because of its demonstrated benefits on motor 
function and survival in clinical trials. However, with a price tag of almost 1 
million dollars for the first year of therapy, careful clinical, treatment-based 
and ethical consideration of the principles of (i) best interests; (ii) 
universality; (iii) portability; (iv) public administration; (v) accessibility; 
and (vi) comprehensiveness are important guideposts to ensure transparent and 
equitable allocation of health-care resources for nusinersen and all other 
future orphan drugs.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the cost-effectiveness of the HiBalance training program 
for managing Parkinson's disease (PD)-related balance and gait disorders.
DESIGN: Cost comparison design following the randomized controlled trial 
comparing a novel balance training intervention with care as usual.
SUBJECTS: A total of 100 participants with mild-moderate PD were randomized to 
either the intervention ( n = 51) or the control group ( n = 49).
INTERVENTION: A 10-week (three times per week), group-based, progressive balance 
training program, led by two physical therapists.
MAIN OUTCOMES: All program costs were collected for both groups. Cost-utility 
was evaluated using quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and cost-effectiveness 
measures were the Mini Balance Evaluation Systems Test (Mini-BESTest; assessing 
balance performance) and gait velocity. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios 
were calculated and a probabilistic sensitivity analysis was conducted.
RESULTS: The between-group difference in QALYs was 0.043 (95% confidence 
interval (CI): 0.011-0.075), favoring the intervention group. Between-group 
differences in balance performance and gait velocity were 2.16 points (95% CI: 
1.19-3.13) and 8.2 cm/second (95% CI: 2.9-13.6), respectively, favoring the 
intervention group. The mean cost per participant in the intervention group was 
16,222 SEK (€1649) compared to 2696 SEK (€274) for controls. The estimated 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were 314,558 SEK (€31,969) for an 
additional QALY, 6262 SEK (€631) for one point improvement in balance 
performance, and 1650 SEK (€166) for 1 cm/second increase in gait velocity. 
Sensitivity analyses indicated a high probability (85%) of program success.
CONCLUSION: In terms of QALYs, the HiBalance program demonstrated a high 
probability of cost-effectiveness in the short-term perspective when considering 
the willingness-to-pay thresholds used in Europe.

BACKGROUND: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a chronic, progressive, genetic disease 
affecting more than 30,000 people in the United States and 70,000 people 
globally. The goals of treatment are to slow disease progression, reduce 
pulmonary exacerbations, relieve chronic symptoms, and improve the patient's 
quality of life. Lumacaftor/ivacaftor is a new therapy for CF that has 
demonstrated good clinical outcomes, including improved absolute percentage 
predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1%). However, given the high 
cost of therapy, there is a need to evaluate the overall value of 
lumacaftor/ivacaftor in CF management.
OBJECTIVES: To (a) conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) of 
lumacaftor/ivacaftor to understand the overall effectiveness of the drug 
compared with its costs and (b) conduct a budget impact analysis (BIA) to 
understand the potential financial effect of introducing a new drug in a health 
plan.
METHODS: Two static decision models were developed using Microsoft Excel to 
evaluate the cost-effectiveness and budget impact of lumacaftor/ivacaftor over a 
1-year time frame from a payer perspective. Model inputs included drug costs 
(wholesale acquisition costs), drug monitoring schedules (package inserts), drug 
monitoring costs (Centers for Medicare & Medicaid physician fee schedule and 
published literature), FEV1% predicted and pulmonary exacerbation values 
(clinical trials), and cost to treat pulmonary exacerbations (published 
literature). The outcomes in the CEA included total cost of therapy; average 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ACER), defined as cost per FEV1% predicted; and 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), defined as the difference in the 
ratio of cost per FEV1% predicted of lumacaftor/ivacaftor and placebo. Outcomes 
in the BIA included total budget impact; cost per member per month (PMPM), 
defined as total budget impact per hypothetical plan population; and cost per 
treated member per month (PTMPM), defined as total budget impact per target CF 
population. All costs were adjusted to 2016 dollars, and one-way sensitivity 
analyses were conducted to test the model robustness given uncertainty in model 
inputs and study assumptions.
RESULTS: The annual cost of therapy per patient for lumacaftor/ivacaftor was 
$379,780. The ACER for lumacaftor/ivacaftor was $151,912, while the ICER for 
lumacaftor/ivacaftor compared with placebo was $95,016 per FEV1% predicted. The 
annual total budget impact due to the inclusion of lumacaftor/ivacaftor on the 
health plan formulary was $266,046. The PMPM cost was $0.02 and the PTMPM cost 
was $6.21.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with CF, lumacaftor/ivacaftor has demonstrated better 
clinical effectiveness compared with placebo alongside an increased drug 
acquisition cost. However, the therapy may be a viable alternative to existing 
standard therapy over a short time horizon. Health care payers, both private and 
public, need to evaluate the cost-effectiveness and the financial effect when 
considering expansion of new drug coverage in CF management.

Nonidentifiability in Model Calibration and Implications for Medical Decision 
Making.

MN.

BACKGROUND: Calibration is the process of estimating parameters of a 
mathematical model by matching model outputs to calibration targets. In the 
presence of nonidentifiability, multiple parameter sets solve the calibration 
problem, which may have important implications for decision making. We evaluate 
the implications of nonidentifiability on the optimal strategy and provide 
methods to check for nonidentifiability.
METHODS: We illustrate nonidentifiability by calibrating a 3-state Markov model 
of cancer relative survival (RS). We performed 2 different calibration 
exercises: 1) only including RS as a calibration target and 2) adding the ratio 
between the 2 nondeath states over time as an additional target. We used the 
Nelder-Mead (NM) algorithm to identify parameter sets that best matched the 
calibration targets. We used collinearity and likelihood profile analyses to 
check for nonidentifiability. We then estimated the benefit of a hypothetical 
treatment in terms of life expectancy gains using different, but equally 
good-fitting, parameter sets. We also applied collinearity analysis to a 
realistic model of the natural history of colorectal cancer.
RESULTS: When only RS is used as the calibration target, 2 different parameter 
sets yield similar maximum likelihood values. The high collinearity index and 
the bimodal likelihood profile on both parameters demonstrated the presence of 
nonidentifiability. These different, equally good-fitting parameter sets produce 
different estimates of the treatment effectiveness (0.67 v. 0.31 years), which 
could influence the optimal decision. By incorporating the additional target, 
the model becomes identifiable with a collinearity index of 3.5 and a unimodal 
likelihood profile.
CONCLUSIONS: In the presence of nonidentifiability, equally likely parameter 
estimates might yield different conclusions. Checking for the existence of 
nonidentifiability and its implications should be incorporated into standard 
model calibration procedures.

Turkey.

OBJECTIVE: The incidence of colorectal cancer becomes higher among octogenarians 
as the life expectancy increases. Whether advanced age is a risk factor for 
colorectal surgery is a matter of debate. In the present study, the clinical 
results of octogenarians who underwent colorectal cancer surgery are discussed 
to find an answer to this question.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Data of 63 octogenarians who were operated in a tertiary 
colorectal surgery department between January 1, 2010 and December 31, 2013 were 
reviewed retrospectively. Demographic data and preoperative, peroperative, and 
postoperative parameters were evaluated.
RESULTS: Overall, 57.2% of the patients were men. The median age was 81 (80-89) 
years. Cancer was located at the right colon in 17.5%, left colon in 50.8%, and 
rectum in 31.7%. Eleven patients underwent emergency surgery (17.5%). The most 
common surgical procedure was low anterior resection in elective (22.2%) and 
Hartmann's procedure in the emergency setting (9.5%). Stoma creation was more 
frequent among patients undergoing emergency procedures (42% vs. 6.8%; 
p=0.0018). Histopathological diagnosis was adenocarcinoma in 90.5% of the 
patients, and 34.9% of the patients had stage IIIB disease. Surgical morbidity 
was significantly higher among patients who underwent rectal resection (66% vs. 
10.2%; p=0.0124). Medical morbidity was observed in 10 (15.9%) patients. 
Preoperative blood transfusion was a risk factor for morbidity (83.4% vs. 29.8%; 
p=0.0170). Length of total hospital stay was 14 (3-39) days. Surgical (p=0.0004) 
and medical (p=0.0288) morbidity prolonged the length of total hospital stay. 
The overall mortality rate was 1.6%.
CONCLUSION: Colorectal surgery may be safely performed in octogenarians with 
acceptable morbidity and mortality in specialized centers.

OBJECTIVE: To quantify the burden of traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) as 
defined by nonfatal health loss and premature mortality among a large sample of 
participants over a 44-year period, and estimate the national burden of SCI in 
the United States for the year 2010.
DESIGN: Longitudinal.
SETTING: National SCI Model Systems and Shriners Hospitals.
PARTICIPANTS: Individuals (N=51,226) were categorized by neurologic level of 
injury as cervical (n=28,178) or thoracic and below (n=23,048).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The burden of SCI was calculated in years lost due to 
premature mortality (YLL), years lived with disability (YLD), and 
disability-adjusted life years (DALY).
RESULTS: For those with cervical level injuries, the overall YLLs and YLDs were 
253,745 and 445,709, respectively, for an estimated total of 699,454 DALYs. For 
those with thoracic and below level injuries, the overall YLLs and YLDs were 
153,885 and 213,160, respectively, for an estimated total of 367,045 DALYs. 
Proportionally adjusted DALYs attributable to SCI in 2010 were 445,911.
CONCLUSIONS: SCIs accounted for over 1 million years of healthy life lost in a 
national sample over a 44-year span. We estimated that 445,911 DALYs resulted 
from SCIs in the US in 2010 alone, placing the national burden of SCIs above 
other impactful conditions such as human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune 
deficiency syndrome. Future investigations may employ DALYs to monitor trends in 
SCI burden in response to innovations in SCI care and identify subgroups of 
persons with SCIs for whom tailored interventions might improve DALYs.
