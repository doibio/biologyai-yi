long-term successful weight loss with an intensive lifestyle intervention (ILI). 
It is unknown, however, if intentional weight loss can reduce the risk of TKR.
METHODS: Look AHEAD randomized persons aged 45-76 with type 2 diabetes who had 
overweight or obesity to either an ILI to achieve/maintain 7% weight loss or to 
standard diabetes support and education (DSE). Reported knee pain was assessed 
using the Visual Analog Scale and Western Ontario McMaster University 
Osteoarthritis Index questionnaire in 5125 participants without previous TKR. 
Cox proportional hazard regression was used to model differences in risk of TKR 
in relation to randomization group assignment (ILI vs DSE) along with baseline 
body mass index category and baseline knee pain as potential confounders from 
baseline through Look AHEAD-Extension.
RESULTS: Baseline mean ± SD Western Ontario McMaster University Osteoarthritis 
Index knee pain scores did not differ by treatment assignment (ILI: 3.6 ± 2.9, 
DSE: 3.9 ± 3.0, P = .08); as expected due to randomization. During follow up, 
the 631 (12%) participants who reported having a TKR were more likely to have 
been heavier (P < .001) and older (P < .001) at enrollment, but risk of TKR did 
not differ by treatment group assignment (hazard ratio [HR] 1.07, 95% confidence 
interval [CI] 0.91-1.25, P = .43). Heterogeneity of treatment effect was 
observed according to baseline knee pain (interaction P = .02). In persons 
without knee pain at baseline, there was a 29% reduced risk of TKR in ILI 
compared to DSE (HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.52-0.96). However, in persons with knee pain 
at baseline, there was no statistically significant association of treatment 
assignment with respect to subsequent TKR incidence (HR 1.11, 95% CI 0.92-1.33).
CONCLUSION: Findings suggest that intensive lifestyle change including physical 
activity, dietary restriction and behavioral changes to achieve weight loss for 
prevention of TKR may be most effective in preventing TKR prior to the 
development of knee pain.

AIMS: A significant proportion of patients with brain metastases have a poor 
prognosis, with a life expectancy of 3-6 months. To determine the optimal 
radiotherapeutic strategy for brain metastases in this population, we conducted 
a randomised feasibility study of whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) versus 
stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with a life expectancy of 3-6 months and between 
one and 10 brain metastases with a diameter ≤4 cm were enrolled at six Canadian 
cancer centres. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either WBRT (20 
Gy in five fractions) or SRS (15 Gy in one fraction). The primary end point was 
the rate of accrual per month. Secondary feasibility and clinical end points 
included the ratio of accrued subjects to screened subjects. This trial is 
registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (number NCT02220491).
RESULTS: In total, 210 patients were screened to enrol 22 patients into the 
trial; 20 patients were randomised between the two arms. Two patients did not 
receive treatment because one patient died and another patient withdrew consent 
after being enrolled. Patients were accrued between January 2015 and November 
2017; the accrual rate was 0.63 patients/month. The most common reasons for 
exclusion were anticipated median survival outside the required range (n = 40), 
baseline Karnofsky Performance Score below 70 (n = 28) and more than 10 brain 
metastases (n = 28). The median follow-up was 7.0 months and the median survival 
was 7.0 months for all patients in the trial. The median intracranial 
progression-free survival was 1.8 months in the SRS arm and 9.2 months in the 
WBRT arm. There were five grade 3+ toxicities in the SRS arm and one grade 3+ 
toxicity in the WBRT arm; no grade 5 toxicities were observed. The cumulative 
rates of retreatment were 40% in the SRS arm and 40% in the WBRT arm.
CONCLUSIONS: A randomised trial evaluating WBRT versus SRS in patients with one 
to 10 metastases and a poor prognosis is feasible. A slower than expected 
accrual rate and difficulties with accurate prognostication were identified as 
issues in this feasibility study. A larger phase III randomised trial is planned 
to determine the optimal treatment in this patient population.

The effects of lead as a dietary pollutant remain a global public health concern 
that needs urgent resolution. Children are highly susceptible to the adverse 
outcomes of lead pollution, as even low levels of lead may cause irreversible 
damage to intellectual development. Since several sources of lead exposure are 
present in the environment, it is necessary to identify the attributable burden 
of lead-related diseases arising from different exposure sources. In the present 
study, we used epidemiological data from studies around the nation to estimate 
the burden of mild intellectual disability (MID) attributed to lead exposure 
sources by using disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). To this end, a 
dose-response approach was used and a model comprising three components was 
established: exposure, dose-response, and DALYs module. In Chinese children aged 
0-6 years, blood lead levels (BLLs) of 5.34 ± 3.09 μg/dL resulted in a MID 
incidence rate of 12.84 cases per 1000 children, with an estimated burden of 
disease (BoD) of 42.23 DALYs per 1000 children. Owing to dietary lead exposure, 
36.64 healthy life years per 1000 children were lost, which was notably higher 
than the outcomes associated with exposure from other sources. This was 
consistent with the result that dietary exposure was the main contributor to 
children's lead exposure, accounting for 86.76%. According to the regional 
distribution based on the existing literature, the areas in China with higher 
BLLs were Heilongjiang, Shanxi, and Jiangxi. Our findings provided the 
information for lead risk management decisions and policies making.

Atmospheric cold plasma (ACP) treatment is an emerging food technology for 
product safety and quality retention, shelf-life extension, and sustainable 
processing. The activated chemical species of ACP can act rapidly against 
microorganisms without leaving chemical residues on food surfaces. The main 
objectives of this study were to investigate the efficiency and mechanisms of 
inactivation of fungal spores and biofilms by ACP and to understand the effects 
of the gas-mediated and liquid-mediated modes of application against important 
fungal contaminants. Aspergillus flavus was selected as the model microorganism. 
A. flavus spores were exposed to either gas plasma (GP) or plasma-activated 
water (PAW), whereas gas plasma alone was used to treat A. flavus biofilms. This 
study demonstrated that both GP and PAW treatments independently resulted in 
significant decreases of A. flavus metabolic activity and spore counts, with 
maximal reductions of 2.2 and 0.6 log10 units for GP and PAW, respectively. The 
characterization of the reactive oxygen and nitrogen species in PAW and spore 
suspensions indicated that the concentration of secondary reactive species was 
an important factor influencing the antimicrobial activity of the treatment. The 
biofilm study showed that GP had detrimental effects on biofilm structure; 
however, the initial inoculum concentration prior to biofilm formation can be a 
crucial factor influencing the fungicidal effects of ACP.IMPORTANCE The 
production of mycotoxin-free food remains a challenge in both human and animal 
food chains. A. flavus, a mycotoxin-producing contaminant of economically 
important crops, was selected as the model microorganism to investigate the 
efficiency and mechanisms of ACP technology against fungal contaminants of food. 
Our study directly compares the antifungal properties of gas plasma (GP) and 
plasma-activated water (PAW) against fungi as well as reporting the effects of 
ACP treatment on biofilms produced by A. flavus.

AIMS: Our aim was to explore optimal treatment decisions for HbA1c control for 
type 2 diabetes mellitus patients and assess the impact on potential 
improvements in quality of life compared with current guidelines.
METHODS: We analyzed a large dataset of HbA1c levels, diabetes-related key risk 
factors and medication dispensed to 70,069 patients with type 2 diabetes from 
polyclinics and a large public hospital in Singapore during January 1, 2008, to 
December 31, 2015. A Markov decision process (MDP) model was developed to 
determine the optimal treatment policy concerning medication management for 
glycemic control over a long-term treatment period. We assessed the model 
performance by comparing quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained by the model 
with those derived by a conventional Markov model informed by current clinical 
guidelines.
RESULTS: Numerical results showed that optimal treatment strategies derived by 
the MDP model could increase the total expected QALYs by as much as 0.27 years 
for patients at higher risk such as old age, high HbA1c levels and smokers. In 
particular, the improvements in QALYs gained for patients with HbA1c levels of 
9% (75 mmol/mol) and above were higher than those with lower HbA1c levels. 
However, the potential improvements appeared to be marginal for patients at 
lower risk compared with current guidelines.
CONCLUSIONS: Use of data-driven prescriptive analytics would help clinicians 
make evidence-based treatment decisions for HbA1c control for patients with type 
2 diabetes, in particular for those at high risk.

Klein and Boals (2001a, Applied Cognitive Psychology, 15[5], 565-579, 
Experiments 1 and 2) found that working memory capacity correlated negatively 
with perceived negative life event stress and speculated the relation may be 
driven by thoughts produced from these experiences. Here, we sought to replicate 
the association between working memory capacity and perceived negative life 
experience and to assess potential mediators of this association such as mind 
wandering propensity, rumination propensity, and the sum of negatively valenced 
mind wandering reports. In this preregistered replication and extension study, 
with data collected from 356 subjects (ns differ among analyses), we found no 
evidence suggesting that perceived negative life stress is associated with 
working memory capacity. Additionally, we found evidence consistent with the 
claim that negatively valenced mind wandering is uniquely detrimental to 
cognitive task performance, but we highlight a potential confound that may 
account for this association that should be addressed in future work.

BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Recently revised vaccination recommendations for US 
adults, aged 65 years and older, include both 23-valent pneumococcal 
polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23) and 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine 
(PCV13), with PCV13 now recommended for immunocompetent older people based on 
shared decision making. The public health impact and cost-effectiveness of this 
recommendation or of pneumococcal vaccine uptake improvement interventions are 
unclear.
DESIGN: Markov decision analysis.
SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Hypothetical 65-year-old general and black population 
cohorts.
INTERVENTION: Current pneumococcal vaccination recommendations for US older 
people, an alternative policy omitting PCV13 in immunocompetent older people, 
and vaccine uptake improvement programs.
RESULTS: The current pneumococcal vaccination recommendation was the most 
effective strategy, but afforded slight public health benefits compared to an 
alternative (PPSV23 for all older people plus PCV13 for the immunocompromised) 
and cost greater than $750 000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained in 
either population group with a vaccine uptake improvement program (absolute 
uptake increase = 12.3%; cost = $1.78/eligible patient) in place. The 
alternative strategy was more economically favorable, but cost greater than $100 
000/QALY in either population, with or without an uptake intervention. Results 
were robust in sensitivity analyses; however, in black older people, the 
alternative strategy with an uptake program was most likely to be favored in 
probabilistic sensitivity analyses at a $150 000/QALY gained threshold.
CONCLUSION: Current pneumococcal vaccination recommendations for US older people 
are economically unfavorable compared to an alternative strategy omitting PCV13 
in the immunocompetent. The alternative recommendation with an uptake 
improvement program may be economically reasonable in black population analyses 
and could be worth considering as a population-wide recommendation if mitigating 
racial disparities is a priority. J Am Geriatr Soc 68:1271-1278, 2020.

BACKGROUND: Focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) is a neuronal migration disorder and 
is a major cause of drug-resistant epilepsy. However, many focal abnormalities 
remain undetected during routine visual inspection, and many patients with 
histologically confirmed FCD have normal fluid-attenuated inversion recovery 
(FLAIR-negative) images. The aim of this study was to quantitatively evaluate 
the changes in cortical thickness with magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of 
patients to identify FCD lesions from FLAIR-negative images.
METHODS: We first used the three-dimensional (3D) Laplace method to calculate 
the cortical thickness for individuals and obtained the cortical thickness mean 
image and cortical thickness standard deviation (SD) image based on all 32 
healthy controls. Then, a cortical thickness extension map was computed by 
subtracting the cortical thickness mean image from the cortical thickness image 
of each patient and dividing the result by the cortical thickness SD image. 
Finally, clusters of voxels larger than three were defined as the FCD lesion 
area from the cortical thickness extension map.
RESULTS: The results showed that three of the four lesions that occurred in 
non-temporal areas were detected in three patients, but the detection failed in 
three patients with lesions that occurred in the temporal area. The quantitative 
analysis of the detected lesions in voxel-wise on images revealed the following: 
specificity (99.78%), accuracy (99.76%), recall (67.45%), precision (20.42%), 
Dice coefficient (30.01%), Youden index (67.23%) and area under the curve (AUC) 
(83.62%).
CONCLUSION: Our studies demonstrate an effective method to localize lesions in 
non-temporal lobe regions. This novel method automatically detected FCD lesions 
using only FLAIR-negative images from patients and was based only on cortical 
thickness feature. The method is noninvasive and more effective than a visual 
analysis for helping doctors make a diagnosis.

With the emergence of diseases, people become frailer and are expected to be 
less tolerant of adverse outcomes. Frailty was first described to explain the 
variability in life expectancy in individuals of the same age. Nowadays, it is 
described as a syndrome and as a state. It is used to explain the heterogeneity 
of people not only in their responses to biological ageing but also in their 
responses to illness. In this review, we explore the role of frailty both in 
age-related diseases, including dementia, cancer and cardiovascular disease, and 
in non-age-related diseases, such as Human Immunodeficiency Virus. We describe 
how high levels of frailty in such disorders predict worse outcomes and play a 
direct role in disease progression and in prognostic prediction. Overall, the 
potential for frailty to predict adverse health outcomes among young people as 
well as in non-age-related diseases is an evolving topic. Understanding how 
frailty contributes to poor health and how it can be modified to prevent or 
delay disease progression will ultimately enhance quality of life in affected 
individuals.

BACKGROUND: Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) adversely impact morbidity and 
mortality.
OBJECTIVE: To quantify burden of disease associated with ACEs among U.S. adults 
by estimating quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE) according to number of 
ACEs reported.
PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: Data from respondents' adverse experiences occurring 
before age 18 were collected in nine states through the 2011 and 2012 Behavioral 
Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS).
METHODS: We estimated health-related quality of life (HRQOL) scores from BRFSS 
data. We constructed life tables from the Compressed Mortality Files to 
calculate QALE, a generalization of life expectancy that weights expected years 
of life lived with the HRQOL score, according to number of ACEs.
RESULTS: The QALE for an 18-year-old person reporting 0, 1-2, and 3+ ACEs was 
55.1, 53.4, and 45.6 years, respectively. Reporting 3+ ACEs was associated with 
a 9.5-year decrease (17%) in QALE. The adverse impact of ACEs are present 
according to age, gender, and race/ethnicity subgroups. The impact of 3+ ACEs on 
QALE was nearly 3-fold greater for women than men (13.2 vs. 4.7-year decrease). 
By contrast, an 18-year-old reporting 1-2 ACEs experienced a small decrease in 
QALE (1.7 years).
CONCLUSIONS: Reporting 3+ ACEs led to a significant burden of disease, as 
assessed by QALE loss, to a similar degree as many other well-established 
behavioral risk factors and chronic conditions. Providers and policymakers 
should focus on efforts to prevent ACEs, initiate early detection of and 
interventions to minimize the impact of an ACE, and reduce the likelihood of 
engaging in maladaptive risky behaviors.

BACKGROUND: Osteoporosis is the most common condition contributing to 95% of 
fractures in older patients hospitalized for fracture treatment. Despite the 
significant impact of fragility fractures on patient morbidity and mortality, 
efforts in optimizing osteoporotic treatment and prevention remain inadequate. 
In contrast, in patients with limited life expectancy, withholding specific 
osteoporosis drug treatment appears reasonable. The threshold between under- and 
overtreatment is still unclear.
METHODS: In 2016, we implemented a fracture liaison service (FLS) for 18 months 
to improve the quality of osteoporosis care. We collected prospectively the 
patient's history, current treatment for osteoporosis, and risk factors for 
fragility fractures using a standardized protocol. Recommendations for drug 
therapy are discussed during the interdisciplinary ward round. The primary 
outcome parameter was a recommendation for specific osteoporosis drug treatment. 
We included 681 patients (mean age 82.5 years, 502 (73.7%) females). The 
inclusion criteria were the following: age of 70 years or older, admission to 
geriatric fracture center between April 2016 and December 2018.
RESULTS: Based on our data, specific osteoporosis drug therapy was recommended 
in 467 (68.6%) patients. Six hundred fifty-one (95.6%) patients received vitamin 
D3, and 546 (80.2%) calcium. After adjustment, only age (every 5 years, OR 0.57; 
95% CI 0.45-0.72; p < 0.0001), cognitive impairment (OR 0.41; 95% CI 0.23-0.74; 
p = 0.003), pre-fracture mobility (OR 1.54; 95% CI 1.34-1.75; p < 0.0001), and 
living in a nursing home (OR 0.52; 95% CI 0.27-0.99; p = 0.049) remained as 
independent predictors for an indication of specific osteoporosis drug therapy.
CONCLUSION: We found a higher rate of recommendations for specific osteoporosis 
drug therapy compared with usual treatment rates in literature. Though in some 
cases withholding of specific osteoporosis drug therapy seems reasonable, the 
main proportion of fragility fracture patients is undertreated. Our results 
could be a benchmark for the quality of osteoporosis care in older fragility 
fracture patients treated in a geriatric fracture center.

[Transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy].

[Article in Danish]

Hansen PR(1), Krakauer M.

Author information:

Transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM) resulting from deposition of 
transthyretin amyloid fibrils in the heart is an underrecognised cause of heart 
failure in the elderly and is associated with a poor life expectancy. The 
diagnosis can now be made by radionuclide imaging with bone tracers, provided 
absence of plasma-cell dyscrasia. Recent evidence has suggested a considerable 
prevalence of ATTR-CM, and effective treatment has become available. This review 
summarises these new developments, which have ushered a new era in the detection 
and clinical management of ATTR-CM.

Symposium review: Why revisit dairy cattle productive lifespan?

Dairy cattle productive lifespan averages approximately 3 yr after first 
calving. Changes in the last decade in reproductive performance, genetic merit, 
and societal concerns regarding animal welfare and the environmental footprint 
of dairy products warrant a critical review of decision making regarding dairy 
cattle productive lifespan. The objective of this study is to provide such a 
review. Economic decision making drives the majority of culling decisions and, 
by extension, dairy cattle productive lifespan. Historically, models focused on 
optimizing replacement decisions for individual cows found economically optimal 
productive lifespans of 40 mo or more. However, cow performance and prices have 
changed and the average findings of these models may no longer hold. Management 
and housing may affect productive lifespan through improvements in health care 
and cow comfort. Improvements in reproductive efficiency and the availability of 
sexed semen are leading to an abundance of dairy heifers on many dairy farms, 
which often results in shorter productive lifespans in herds of fixed sizes. 
There is also a growing interest in the use of beef semen in dairy cattle, which 
does not add to the supply of dairy heifers. Acceleration of genetic gain due to 
genomic testing should likely result in shorter productive lifespans. Younger 
herds capitalize on genetic progress but have fewer efficient mature cows and 
have greater replacement costs. Extending dairy cattle productive lifespan might 
decrease the environmental footprint of milk production because fewer heifers 
need to be raised. Short productive lifespans, especially as a result of much 
forced culling early in lactation, are often signs of reduced welfare. Possible 
extensions of productive lifespan through improved welfare may alleviate public 
concerns about dairy production, although longer productive lifespans for 
healthy cows are not necessarily more profitable. A simple model of the 
economically optimal productive lifespan illustrates the tradeoffs between herd 
replacement cost, maturity and aging costs, genetic opportunity cost, and calf 
value opportunity cost. Combined, these factors suggest that an average 
productive lifespan of approximately 5 yr is warranted. In conclusion, increases 
in genetic gain, reproductive efficiency, cow comfort, and health care will 
increase the opportunity of herd managers to change productive lifespan to 
increase profitability, improve societal acceptance of dairy production, or 
both.

BACKGROUND: Very long-term mortality in men with early prostate cancer treated 
with surgery versus observation is uncertain.
OBJECTIVE: To determine long-term effects of surgery versus observation on 
all-cause mortality for men with early prostate cancer.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This study evaluated long-term follow-up of a 
randomized trial conducted at the US Department of Veterans Affairs and National 
Cancer Institute sites. The participants were men (n=731) ≤75yr of age with 
localized prostate cancer, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) <50ng/ml, life 
expectancy ≥10yr, and medically fit for surgery.
INTERVENTION: Radical prostatectomy versus observation.
OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: All-cause mortality was assessed 
in the entire cohort and patient and tumor subgroups. Intention-to-treat 
analysis was conducted using Kaplan-Meier methods with log-rank tests and Cox 
proportional hazard models; cumulative mortality incidence, between-group 
differences, and relative risks were also assessed at predefined time periods.
RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: During 22.1yr (median follow-up for survivors=18.6yr; 
interquartile range: 16.6-20.0), 515 men died; 246 of 346 men (68%) were 
assigned to surgery versus 269 of 367 (73%) assigned to observation (hazard 
ratio 0.84 [95% confidence interval {CI}: 0.70-1.00]; p= 0.044 [absolute risk 
reduction = 5.7 percentage points, 95% CI: -0.89 to 12%]; relative risk: 0.92 
[95% CI: 0.84-1.01]). The restricted mean survival in the surgical group was 
13.6 yr (95% CI: 12.9-14.3) versus 12.6 yr (95% CI: 11.8-13.3) in the 
observation group; a mean of 1 life-year was gained with surgery. Results did 
not significantly vary by patient or tumor characteristics, although differences 
were larger favoring surgery among men aged <65 yr, of white race, and having 
better health status, fewer comorbidities, ≥34% positive prostate biopsy cores, 
and intermediate-risk disease. Results were not adjusted for multiple 
comparisons, and we could not assess outcomes other than all-cause mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: Surgery was associated with small very long-term reductions in 
all-cause mortality and increases in years of life gained. Absolute effects did 
not vary markedly by patient characteristics. Absolute effects and mean survival 
were much smaller in men with low-risk disease, but were greater in men with 
intermediate-risk disease although not in men with high-risk disease.
PATIENT SUMMARY: In this randomized study, we evaluated death from any cause in 
men with early prostate cancer treated with either surgery or observation. 
Overall, surgery may provide small very long-term reductions in death from any 
cause and increases in years of life gained. Absolute effects were much smaller 
in men with low-risk disease, but were greater in men with intermediate-risk 
disease although not in men with high-risk disease. Strategies are needed to 
identify men needing and benefitting from surgery while reducing ineffective 
treatment and overtreatment.

Introduction. Medical improvements have allowed hemophilia patients to 
anticipate an increased quality of life and life expectancy similar to that of 
the general population. Analysis of the potential disease symptoms of hemophilia 
patients based on a survey of Sasang Constitutional Medicine (SCM) is important 
for optimal preventive care and adjunctive therapy to avoid life-threating 
complications.
AIM: To predict potential disease symptoms from the viewpoint of SCM as a 
preventive care strategy for hemophilia patients.
METHODS: Sixty-one hemophilia patients responded to a survey on Sasang 
constitutional classification, hemophilia disease pattern, and original 
symptoms.
RESULTS: In terms of SCM type, the 61 of hemophilia patients included 37 Tae-Eum 
(60.7%), 18 So-Yang (29.5%), and 6 So-Eum (12.5%). Hemophilia was found to be 
higher in Tae-Eum type and lower in So-Yang and So-Eum types, while considering 
the distributional rate of Korean Sasang types. Most of the patients with 
Tae-Eum type had Joyeol or Ganyeol. Furthermore, the incidences of diabetes and 
high blood pressure were greater in Tae-Eum type than in those of other types.
CONCLUSION: In order to increase the quality of life and overall life 
expectancy, hemophilia patients with Tae-Eum type should be treated through 
management according to SCM along with medicine against hemophilia as long-term 
preventive care. Diabetes and high blood pressure should be regularly monitored 
in patients with Tae-Eum type.

BACKGROUND: Randomised controlled trials demonstrating improved longevity are 
needed to justify high-dose vitamin D supplementation for older populations.
OBJECTIVES: To demonstrate the feasibility of a large trial (n ≈ 20,000) of 
high-dose vitamin D in people aged 65-84 years through general practitioner (GP) 
practices, and to cluster randomise participating practices between open-label 
and double-blind randomisation to compare effects on recruitment, compliance and 
contamination.
DESIGN: Twenty GP practices were randomised in matched pairs between open-label 
and double-blind allocation. Within each practice, patients were individually 
randomised to vitamin D or control (i.e. no treatment or placebo). Participants 
were invited to attend their GP practice to provide a blood sample and complete 
a lifestyle questionnaire at recruitment and again at 2 years. Randomisation by 
telephone followed receipt of a serum corrected calcium assay confirming 
eligibility (< 2.65 nmol/l). Treatment compliance was reported by quarterly 
follow-up forms sent and returned by e-mail or post (participant choice). GP 
visits and infections were abstracted from GP records. Hospital attendances, 
cancer diagnoses and deaths were ascertained by linkage to Hospital Episode 
Statistics and national registration through NHS Digital.
SETTING: GP practices in England.
PARTICIPANTS: Recruitment opened in October 2013 and closed in January 2015. A 
total of 1615 registered patients aged 65-84 years were randomised: 407 to 
vitamin D and 421 to no treatment in open practices; 395 to vitamin D and 392 to 
placebo in blind practices.
INTERVENTIONS: There was a 24-month treatment period: 12 monthly doses 
(100,000 IU of vitamin D3 or placebo as 5 ml oily solution) were posted after 
randomisation and at 1 year (100,000 IU per month corresponds to 3300 IU per 
day). Reminders were sent monthly by e-mail, text message or post.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Recruitment, compliance, contamination and change in 
circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] from baseline to 2 years.
RESULTS: Participation rates (randomised/invited) were 15.0% in open practices 
and 13.4% in double-blind practices (p = 0.7). The proportion still taking study 
medication at 2 years was 91.2% in open practices and 89.2% in double-blind 
practices (p = 0.4). The proportion of control participants taking > 400 IU 
vitamin D per day at 2 years was 5.0% in open practices and 4.8% in double-blind 
practices. Mean serum 25(OH)D concentration was 51.5 nmol/l [95% confidence 
interval (CI) 50.2 to 52.8 nmol/l] with 82.6% of participants < 75 nmol/l at 
baseline. At 2 years, this increased to 109.6 nmol/l (95% CI 107.1 to 
112.1 nmol/l) with 12.0% < 75 nmol/l in those allocated to vitamin D and was 
unaltered at 51.8 nmol/l (95% CI 49.8 to 53.8 nmol/l) in those allocated to no 
vitamin D (no treatment or placebo).
CONCLUSIONS: A trial could recruit 20,000 participants aged 65-84 years through 
200 GP practices over 2 years. Approximately 80% would be expected to adhere to 
allocated treatment (vitamin D or placebo) for 5 years. The trial could be 
conducted entirely by e-mail in participants aged < 80 years, but some 
participants aged 80-84 years would require postal follow-up. Recruitment and 
treatment compliance would be similar and contamination (self-administration of 
vitamin D) would be minimal, whether control participants are randomised openly 
to no treatment with no contact during the trial or randomised double-blind to 
placebo with monthly reminders.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN46328341 and EudraCT 
database 2011-003699-34.

Health Technology Assessment programme and will be published in full in Health

Plain Language Summary: High-dose vitamin D may reduce the risk of many 
diseases, but without large randomised controlled trials the evidence will 
remain inconclusive. We therefore proposed the Vitamin D and Longevity (VIDAL) 
trial, with 20,000 older people randomised to either no vitamin D medication or 
vitamin D medication for 5 years. The VIDAL feasibility study was conducted to 
establish the procedures required for the main trial, including assessment of 
recruitment, compliance (taking study treatment as directed) and contamination 
(how many control participants started taking vitamin D). This was done in two 
sets of general practitioner (GP) practices: (1) ‘open’ practices, in which 
participants knew their treatment allocation (2 years of 100,000 IU vitamin D 
monthly or no treatment), and (2) ‘double-blind’ practices, in which 
participants and their GPs did not know whether they were taking vitamin D or 
placebo oil. We invited 11,376 men and women aged 65–84 years from 20 GP 
practices in England and 1615 (14%) took part. Ninety per cent of participants 
allocated to monthly oil took it for 2 years and few participants used vitamin 
supplements outside the trial, with no marked differences between open-label and 
double-blind arms. The best way to conduct the main trial will therefore depend 
on other considerations. A double-blind trial provides reliable evidence on 
effects where reporting could be influenced by you or your doctor knowing your 
treatment, which is important for many illnesses and any side effects of 
treatment. However, any long-term effects are likely to be considerably greater 
if treatment continues instead of stopping after 5 years when the main trial 
ends. An open trial is easier to conduct and, when it ends, those taking vitamin 
D can be offered a continuing supply so that the effect of lifelong treatment 
can be studied for major diseases and life expectancy, which are unlikely to be 
affected by individuals knowing whether or not they are taking vitamin D.

The last years witnessed an important progress in the diagnosis and treatment of 
dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), improving prognosis and life expectancy. However, 
some important issues in clinical management remain unresolved. The role of 
genetic testing, the arrhythmic stratification, and the therapeutic approach 
still represent areas of uncertainty. The way for improving care of DCM should 
go through better understanding of the etiological basis of the disease, 
appropriate risk stratification, and development of new therapies. The 
abovementioned issues represent the most important and demanding challenges for 
the next future research on DCM.

Differential sequences and single nucleotide polymorphism of exosomal SOX2 DNA 
in cancer.

Vaidya M(1), Sugaya K(1).

Central Florida, Orlando, Florida, United States of America.

Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common form of brain cancer, with an 
average life expectancy of fewer than two years post-diagnosis. We have 
previously reported that cancer cell originated exosomes, including GBM, have 
NANOG and NANOGP8 DNA associated with them. The exosomal NANOG DNA has certain 
differences as compared to its normal counterpart that are of immense importance 
as a potential cancer biomarker. NANOG has been demonstrated to play an 
essential role in the maintenance of embryonic stem cells, and its pseudogene, 
NANOGP8, is suggested to promote the cancer stem cell phenotype. Similarly, SOX2 
is another stemness gene highly expressed in cancer stem cells with an intimate 
involvement in GBM progression and metastasis as well as promotion of 
tumorigenicity in Neuroblastoma (NB). Since exosomes are critical in 
intercellular communication with a role in dissipating hallmark biomolecules 
responsible for cancer, we conducted a detailed analysis of the association of 
the SOX2 gene with exosomes whose sequence modulations with further research and 
appropriate sample size can help to identify diagnostic markers for cancer. We 
have detected SOX2 DNA associated with exosomes and have identified some of the 
SNPs and nucleotide variations in the sequences from a GBM and SH-SY5Y sample. 
Although a further systematic investigation of exosomal DNA from GBM and NB 
patient's blood is needed, finding of SOX2 DNA in exosomes in the current study 
may have value in clinical research. SOX2 is known to be misregulated in cancer 
cells by changes in miRNA function, such as SNPs in the binding sites. Our 
finding of cancer-specific SNPs in exosomal SOX2 DNA sequence may reflect those 
changes in the cancer stem cells as well as cancer cells. A series of our study 
on embryonic stem cell gene analysis in exosomal DNA may lead to a minimally 
invasive exosome-based diagnosis, and give us a key in understanding the 
mechanisms of cancer formation, progression, and metastasis.
