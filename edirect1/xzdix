BACKGROUND: Some patients with end-stage osteoarthritis of the knee remain 
unsatisfied after total knee arthroplasty (TKA). We postulated that to increase 
satisfaction, self-efficacy (SE) for physical activity should receive more 
attention in rehabilitative intervention, alongside the management of patient 
expectations, pain, and function.
OBJECTIVE: We examined the relative impact of Physical Activity SE on 
Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQOL) alongside other factors such as pain and 
physical function which are well-addressed by current interventions.
METHODS: One hundred and six first-TKA recipients (15 Male/91 Female, age 73.6 ± 
7.2) were evaluated at 3 and 6 months post-operatively using the Medical 
Outcomes Study 36-Item Health Survey (SF-36v2) for HRQOL, knee extension 
strength measurement, Timed Up and Go test (TUG), One Leg Standing time test 
(OLS), Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) 
for pain and function, and an instrument for measuring Physical Activity SE 
among the frail elderly in Japan.
RESULTS: Significant improvement over pre-operative values was found at 3 and 6 
months in TUG, OLS, WOMAC Pain and Function, and the 8 subscales of the SF-36v2. 
Factors found to significantly impact SF-36v2 subscale scores at 6 months 
post-operatively were found to be knee pain, knee function, and SE for physical 
activity.
CONCLUSION: These results support our postulation that interventions to improve 
SE for physical activity could have comparable impact alongside interventions 
for knee pain and knee function, on the advancement of HRQOL among TKA 
recipients.

Cross-national survey data shows that for a significant share of European 
citizens, corruption is acceptable. Notwithstanding the importance of prior 
knowledge on corruption extension and experience, research has made little 
progress in exploring why people condone it, especially in unsuspicious 
countries, with effective institutions and stable democratic rules and 
processes. The present study examines this gap in the literature by assessing 
the European Values Study (EVS) and the Special Eurobarometer (EB) attempts at 
measuring 'Tolerance towards Corruption' (TtC) in OECD countries in Europe 
during the same period (2017-2019). In the end, measurements proved to be 
constrained by the limited number of questions/items that try to capture TtC, 
which gave room to conclude that: (a) EVS and EB approaches do not measure the 
same TtC. The first measures it through social transgressions not exclusively 
related to corruption, while the second measures the willingness to accept a 
public-office corruption when dealing with the public sphere. (b) Lower ages 
combined with individual preferences/perceptions of less satisfaction with life, 
widespread corruption, and prior experiences with corruption proved to be more 
relevant to explain TtC, regardless of the country in which individuals were 
surveyed. (c) The type of TtC citizens display in advanced democracies proved to 
be mainly contingent on their age and on the way they interpret the extension of 
corruption and the prior contact they had with a public-office corruption in a 
given society.

OBJECTIVE: This study investigates life expectancy and trade openness in China 
for the period 1960-2018.
METHODS: We purposed a theoretical model that is tested for China by applying 
regime-switching regression.
RESULTS: Our findings suggest that trade openness increases life expectancy in 
China; trade affects life expectancy from two aspects; firstly, trade expansion 
and industrialization lead to high economic activities and resulted in raise the 
income of the people in society leading to improve life expectancy. Secondly, 
industrial expansion increases the CO2 emissions which leads to imposes a 
negative implication on human health and thus reduces life expectancy.
CONCLUSION: Thus, the net effect of trade liberalization depends on the value of 
income effect and volume of CO2 emissions. Therefore, the government needs to 
support the trade policies which causes a low level of CO2 emissions, the 
government may provide incentives to exports and industrialists to adopted green 
energy in the production process. Besides, the government may impose some 
regulations such as carbon tax to mitigate the CO2 emissions in society.

BACKGROUND: Men have a special role to play in promoting maternal and child 
health during pregnancy, childbirth, and postpartum period. The health of women 
also requires the participation and cooperation of men. The aim of this study is 
to compare the effect of virtual and face-to-face childbirth preparation 
training for spouses of the primiparous women on the pregnancy experience, fear 
of childbirth (FOC), and mother- and father-infant attachment.
METHODS: The primiparous women attending the prenatal clinics of Lolagar 
Hospital and Azadi and Tehransar health centers of Tehran along with their 
husbands will be studied. The inclusion criteria for the women's husbands are 
the first experience of becoming a father, being at least 18 years of age, and 
the ability to read and write. The exclusion criteria for women's husbands are 
the history of physical/mental illness; being a smoker; and consuming alcohol, 
drugs, or psychotropic substances. The participants will be selected by the 
convenience sampling method and will be divided into three groups of study A, 
study B, and control. Spouses in study groups A and B will receive childbirth 
training through virtual and face-to-face methods with similar content, 
respectively. The control group only receives ordinary prenatal care. At the 
18-20 weeks of gestation, demographic information, pregnancy experience scale 
(PES), and version A of Wijma delivery expectancy/experience questionnaire 
(WDEQ-A) will be completed. At 37-38 weeks of gestation, the PES and WDEQ-A 
questionnaires will be completed again and maternal postnatal attachment scale 
(MPAS) and postnatal paternal-infant attachment questionnaire (PPAQ) will be 
completed by the parents 12 weeks after the delivery. Discussion. Improving the 
experience of pregnancy, especially reducing the FOC and creating a positive 
attitude towards it, is a vital strategy to promote vaginal childbirth and 
reduce the number of cesarean sections requested by women. Achieving this will 
reduce the cost of health care and improve the quality of life during pregnancy, 
after childbirth, and during the growth and development of infants. Ethics and 
Dissemination. This research has been funded by the Iran University of Medical 
Sciences, approved by the Thailand Registry of Clinical Trials, and will 
commence in May 2020. Results will be disseminated through peer-reviewed 
journals and shared with the academic and medical community to pregnancy and 
childbirth outcomes. This trial is registered with TCTR20200515011.

Chandigarh, IND.

Treatment modalities for polycythemia vera (PV) have evolved over time. 
Phlebotomy and low-dose aspirin suffice in low-risk patients, but cytoreductive 
therapies are indicated in all high-risk patients (age ≥ 65 years or those with 
a history of PV-related thrombotic event) and may be considered for low-risk 
patients with progressively increasing splenomegaly, progressively increasing 
leucocyte and platelet counts, and for those who do not tolerate phlebotomy. 
Hydroxyurea/hydroxycarbamide or interferons can be used as first-line drugs. 
Hydroxyurea may not be tolerated by some patients, and it also carries risk of 
myelosuppression. Interferon alfa is especially useful for PV symptoms, and the 
newer preparation, ropeginterferon alfa-2b, has lesser incidence of flu-like 
reactions. Ruxolitinib reduces the JAK2V617F mutation burden and is used as a 
second-line drug. Anagrelide reduces platelet production and can be used in 
conjunction with hydroxyurea in patients with excessive thrombocytosis. The 
alkylating agent, busulfan, can also be used as a last resort in patients with a 
limited life expectancy. Prospective future treatments include givinostat, a 
histone deacetylase inhibitor, and idasanutlin, a murine double minute 2 
antagonist.

BACKGROUND: In geriatric age group, hip fractures tend to become a major public 
health hazard. Due to this high occurrence, there is a need to develop 
standardized, effective, and multidisciplinary management for treatment. These 
elderly patients have excessive mortality that can extend ahead of the time of 
recovery. Early surgery after hip fractures has lead to a notable reduction in 
mortality rates. Still, it is considerably high as compared to other fractures.
METHODS: 266 patients of >65 years who were operated within 72 h hours in a 
tertiary level health care centre for hip fractures were included. They were 
evaluated with X-rays and grade of Singh's index was noted. Mortality rates and 
the factors associated with it such as age, sex, co morbidities (using 
Charlson's co morbidity Index/CCI) were evaluated after 2 year follow up.
RESULTS: The overall 2-year mortality reported in our study population was 
11.2%. It was broadly lower as compared to most of the other studies. It was 
6.3% in females as compared to 18.1% in males. While it was reported to be only 
6% in 65-74 years of age, it was 25% in patients who were 85 years and above. 
76.6% of the patients had Singh's index of ≤ grade 3 showing osteoporosis. The 
patients with Low Charlson's score showed only 4.2% mortality while those with 
high Charlson's score showed 25.5% mortality.
CONCLUSION: It was concluded that Mortality among elderly patients after early 
surgery after osteoporotic hip fractures is quite significant. The factors for 
improvement in long term survival post-hip fracture may include changing 
treatment patterns, increasing life expectancy and early surgery. Increase in 
age, female sex, and high CCI Scores were major risk factors of mortality after 
hip fractures in a 2-year follow-up period.

Health Sciences, University of the Witwatersrand, Parktown, South Africa.

BACKGROUND: Secondary health conditions (SHCs) such as pain, pressure sores, 
sexual problems, bowel and bladder problems are prevalent throughout the 
lifespan of people with spinal cord injury (SCI). Studies have reported that 
SHCs decrease life expectancy and increase health care costs. Studies on the 
lived experience of SHCs are, however, limited.
OBJECTIVES: To explore the experiences of SHCs amongst people with SCI in a 
public rehabilitation hospital in South Africa.
METHOD: Face-to-face semi-structured interviews were conducted with people with 
SCI from August 2018 to July 2019. All interviews were transcribed verbatim and 
analysed using a content analysis approach.
RESULTS: Seventeen people with SCI were interviewed. Participants experienced a 
range of SHCs. The most common experienced SHC was pain (94%). The main theme 
that emerged from the analysis was 'the impact of secondary health conditions on 
health and well-being'. The categories linked to the impact were SHCs 
co-occurrence and how SHCs limit function, restrict participation, affect mental 
health and disrupt lives.
CONCLUSION: We found that SHCs were enormously impactful on our participants' 
lives and health, as illustrated by their stories of fear, embarrassment and 
shame. Understanding people with SCI experiences of SHCs can enhance 
communication between people with SCI and health professionals and may help 
develop prevention strategies.
CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: To enhance patient-centred care, health professionals are 
encouraged to actively listen to patients' experiences of illness and the impact 
on health and wellbeing.

Comparing written exposure therapy to Prolonged Exposure for the treatment of 
PTSD in a veteran sample: A non-inferiority randomized design.

Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is highly prevalent among veterans. 
Although there are effective treatment approaches for PTSD, such as Prolonged 
Exposure (PE) and Cognitive Processing Therapy, many providers trained in these 
approaches do not use them, or use them without sufficient fidelity, and 
veterans drop out of these treatments at very high rates. The time intensive 
nature of these treatments is frequently cited as a barrier to receiving the 
treatment among veterans and delivering the treatment among providers. 
According, there is an urgent need to establish more efficient and effective 
PTSD treatment approaches in order to meet the needs of veterans seeking care. 
Written exposure therapy (WET) is an efficient, exposure-based treatment, and 
may represent a plausible alternative treatment option to address PTSD in 
veterans. Although WET has been found to be effective and non-inferior to more 
time intensive trauma-focused treatment, it has not yet been investigated with a 
veteran sample. In an ongoing randomized controlled trial (RCT) we are 
investigating whether WET is non-inferior in treating PTSD compared with the 
more time intensive PE. The study sample will include 150 men and women veterans 
diagnosed with PTSD who are randomly assigned to either WET (n = 75) or PE 
(n = 75). Participants are assessed prior to treatment and 10-, 20-, and 
30-weeks after the first treatment session. The primary outcome is PTSD symptom 
severity assessed with the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5. 
Establishing that PTSD can be treated effectively with fewer treatment sessions 
would represent a significant advance in improving access to evidence-based care 
for veterans with PTSD.

The Asia-Pacific region includes countries with diverse cultural, demographic, 
and socio-political backgrounds. Countries such as Japan have very high life 
expectancy and an aged population. China and India, with a combined population 
over 2.7 billion, will experience a huge wave of ageing population with 
subsequent osteoporotic injuries. Australia will experience a similar increase 
in the osteoporotic fracture burden, and is leading the region by establishing a 
national hip fracture registry with governmental guidelines and outcome 
monitoring. While it is impossible to compare fragility hip fracture care in 
every Asia-Pacific country, this review of 4 major nations gives insight into 
the challenges facing diverse systems. They are united by the pursuit of 
internationally accepted standards of timely surgery, combined orthogeriatric 
care, and secondary fracture prevention strategies.

BACKGROUND: Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) play a critical role in 
standardizing and improving treatment outcomes based on the available evidence. 
It is unclear how many CPGs are available globally to assist clinicians in the 
management of patients with skin disease.
OBJECTIVES: To search for and identify CPGs for dermatological conditions with 
the highest burden globally.
METHODS: We adapted a list of 12 dermatological conditions with the highest 
burden from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study 2019. A systematic 
literature search was done to identify CPGs published between October 2014 to 
October 2019. The scoping review was conducted and reported in accordance with 
the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 
framework.
RESULTS: A total of 226 CPGs were included. Melanoma had the greatest 
representation in the CPGs, followed by dermatitis and psoriasis. Skin cancers 
had a relatively high CPG representation but with lower GBD disease burden 
ranking. There was an uneven distribution by geographical region, with 
resource-poor settings being under-represented. The skin disease categories of 
the CPGs correlated weakly with the GBD disability-adjusted life-years metrics. 
Eighty-nine CPGs did not have funding disclosures and 34 CPGs were behind a 
paywall.
CONCLUSIONS: The global production of dermatology CPGs showed wide variation in 
geographical representation, article accessibility and reporting of funding. The 
number of skin disease CPGs were not commensurate with its disease burden. 
Future work will critically appraise the methodology and quality of dermatology 
CPGs and lead to the production of an accessible online resource summarizing 
these findings.

BACKGROUND: Sinusitis complicated by intracranial or orbital extension can be 
life-threatening and require emergent intervention. Histologic features of 
complicated sinusitis have yet to be determined and may have significant 
implications for understanding pathophysiology.
METHODS: A structured histopathology report was utilized to analyze sinus tissue 
extracted during functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS). A total of 13 
histopathology variables were compared between patients with complicated 
sinusitis (CS), CRS without nasal polyps (CRSsNP), and CRS with nasal polyps 
(CRSwNP).
RESULTS: About 24 CS, 149 uncomplicated CRSsNP, and 191 uncomplicated CRSwNP 
patients were analyzed. Nasal tissue from CS and CRSwNP patients demonstrated 
similar levels of overall inflammation (66.7% vs. 69.6% with moderate/severe 
inflammation, P = .466). Relative to CRSsNP, CS patients showed significantly 
greater overall inflammation (66.7% vs. 41.6%, P = .019). CS patients 
demonstrated significantly fewer eosinophils per high power field (eos/HPF) and 
eosinophil aggregates compared to CRSwNP patients (20.8% vs. 70.7% with 
5+eos/HPF, P < .0001; 4.2% vs. 33.5%, P < .0001). Relative to CRSsNP patients, 
CS patients demonstrated enhanced neutrophil infiltration (45.8% vs. 28.0%, 
P = .011). About 91.7% of CS patients demonstrated a lymphoplasmacytic 
predominant inflammatory infiltrate, compared to 69.8% of CRSsNP and 62.8% of 
CRSwNP patients (P < .0001).
CONCLUSION: Significant histopathological differences were evident in patients 
with CS, CRSsNP, and CRSwNP. CS patients did not perfectly fit either a CRSsNP 
or CRSwNP profile, underscoring the importance of delineating the 
histopathological features of CS. This study offers insight into the histologic 
aspects of CS, providing initial evidence that it is an aggressive neutrophilic 
inflammatory process.

OBJECTIVE: Subjective quality of life is an important outcome of psychotic 
disorders. However, longitudinal course of subjective quality of life in the 
early illness stage is under-studied. We aimed to investigate the patterns and 
baseline predictors of subjective quality of life trajectories over 3 years in 
early psychosis patients, utilizing growth mixing modeling analysis, in the 
context of a 3-year follow-up of a randomized controlled trial comparing 1-year 
extension of early intervention with step-down psychiatric care for 
first-episode psychosis.
METHOD: One hundred sixty Chinese patients were recruited from specialized early 
intervention program for first-episode psychosis in Hong Kong after they had 
completed this 2-year early intervention service, and underwent 1-year 
randomized controlled trial as well as 2-year post-randomized controlled trial 
follow-up (i.e. 3-year follow-up). Assessments on premorbid adjustment, onset 
profile, psychopathology, functioning and treatment characteristics were 
conducted. Individual class membership of subjective quality of life trajectory 
derived from growth mixing modeling was based on the 36-Item Short Form Health 
Survey mental component summary scores measured at four different time-points 
(baseline, 1, 2 and 3 years) among 142 participants across 3-year follow-up.
RESULTS: Three distinct subjective quality of life trajectories were identified 
including higher-improving (68.3%, n = 97), lower-stable (24.6%, n = 35) and 
deteriorating (7%, n = 10) trajectories. Age of onset; duration of untreated 
psychosis; depressive, positive and negative symptoms; and intervention 
condition were significantly different between good (higher-improving 
trajectory) and poor (combined lower-stable and deteriorating trajectories) 
trajectory groups. Multiple regression analysis revealed that younger age of 
onset, more severe depression and receipt of step-down care independently 
predicted poor subjective quality of life trajectory.
CONCLUSION: Approximately one-third of patients displayed poor subjective 
quality of life trajectory in the early phase of psychotic illness. Our results 
affirm depression as a critical determinant of prospective subjective quality of 
life and underscores positive effect of extended early intervention on sustained 
subjective quality of life improvement. Further longitudinal research is 
warranted to facilitate better characterization of subjective quality of life 
course patterns and development of targeted intervention to optimize subjective 
quality of life in patients with early psychosis.

Increased mortality rates and decreased life expectancy in the United States are 
associated with rurality, even after adjusting for poverty. In unincorporated 
rural communities, high population density may compound the negative health 
impact of the upstream factors associated with rurality, yet little is known 
about how this context contributes to residents' health. We conducted nine focus 
groups with youth and adults from March-July 2017 in two Texas unincorporated 
rural communities. Using ecosocial theory and applied thematic analysis for 
focus groups, we investigated social, political, and historical factors that 
affect health. We identified two primary themes: upstream barriers to community 
health and K-12 schools as facilitators of community health. K-12 schools, and 
full-service community schools, in particular, may have an important role in 
closing the rural-urban health gap, even in the context of structural 
constraints associated with unincorporated rural status.

Leveraging Social and Structural Determinants of Health at the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention: A Systems-Level Opportunity to Improve Public 
Health.

Health Service and Implementation Science Office (Dr Naoom), Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia; and Government and Public Services 
Practice, Deloitte, Atlanta, Georgia (Ms Irune).

CONTEXT: Social and structural determinants of health (SDOH) have become part of 
the public health and health care landscape. The need to address SDOH is 
reinforced by morbidity and mortality trends, including a recent multiyear 
decrease in life expectancy and persistent health disparities. Leadership on 
SDOH-related efforts has come from public health, health care, private 
philanthropy, and nongovernmental entities.
STRATEGY: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has been 
addressing SDOH through both disease- or condition-specific programs and 
crosscutting offices. Guidance from public health partners in the field has led 
the CDC to consider more strategic approaches to incorporating SDOH into public 
health activities.
IMPLEMENTATION: The CDC's crosscutting SDOH Workgroup responded to external 
recommendations to develop a specific vision and plan that aims to integrate 
SDOH into the agency's infrastructure. The group also sponsors CDC forums for 
sharing research and trainings on embedding SDOH in programs. The group created 
a Web site to centralize CDC SDOH research, data sources, practice tools, 
programs, and policies.
PROGRESS: The CDC has shown strong leadership in prioritizing SDOH in recent 
years. Individual programs and crosscutting offices have developed various 
models aimed at ensuring that public health research and practice address SDOH.
DISCUSSION: Building sustainable SDOH infrastructures in public health 
institutions that reach across multiple health topics and non-health 
organizations could increase chances of meeting public health morbidity and 
mortality reduction goals, including decreasing health disparities. Although 
public health priorities and socioeconomic trends will change over time, 
experience suggests that social and structural factors will continue to 
influence the public's health. The CDC and state, tribal, local, and territorial 
public health institutions have played important leadership roles in the system 
of community and service organizations that interface with communities they 
mutually serve to address SDOH. Continued capacity-building could help grow and 
sustain an SDOH infrastructure that advances this work.

OBJECTIVE: Life expectancy and obesity rates have drastically increased in 
recent years. An unhealthy weight is related to long-lasting medical disorders 
that might compromise the normal course of aging. The aim of the current study 
of brain connectivity patterns was to examine whether adults with obesity would 
show signs of premature aging, such as lower segregation, in large-scale 
networks.
METHODS: Participants with obesity (n = 30, mean age = 32.8 ± 5.68 years) were 
compared with healthy-weight controls (n = 33, mean age = 30.9 ± 6.24 years) and 
senior participants who were stroke-free and without dementia (n = 30, mean age 
= 67.1 ± 6.65 years) using resting-state magnetic resonance imaging and graph 
theory metrics (i.e., small-world index, clustering coefficient, characteristic 
path length, and degree).
RESULTS: Contrary to our hypothesis, participants with obesity exhibited a 
higher clustering coefficient compared with senior participants (t = 5.06, p < 
.001, d = 1.23, 95% CIbca = 0.64 to 1.88). Participants with obesity also showed 
lower global degree relative to seniors (t = -2.98, p = .014, d = -0.77, 95% 
CIbca = -1.26 to -0.26) and healthy-weight controls (t = -2.92, p = .019, d = 
-0.72, 95% CIbca = -1.19 to -0.25). Regional degree alterations in this group 
were present in several functional networks.
CONCLUSIONS: Participants with obesity displayed greater network clustering than 
did seniors and also had lower degree compared with seniors and individuals with 
normal weight, which is not consistent with the notion that obesity is 
associated with premature aging of the brain. Although the cross-sectional 
nature of the study precludes causal inference, the overly clustered network 
patterns in obese participants could be relevant to age-related changes in brain 
function because regular networks might be less resilient and metabolically 
inefficient.

IMPORTANCE: Treatment with nivolumab-ipilimumab combination therapy was found to 
improve overall survival compared with chemotherapy among patients with advanced 
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in the CheckMate 227 clinical trial. However, 
these drugs are substantially more expensive than chemotherapy and, given the 
high incidence of advanced NSCLC, the incorporation of dual immune checkpoint 
inhibitors into the standard of care could have substantial economic 
consequences.
OBJECTIVE: To assess whether nivolumab-ipilimumab combination therapy is a 
cost-effective first-line treatment for patients with advanced NSCLC.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This economic evaluation designed a Markov 
model to compare the cost-effectiveness of nivolumab-ipilimumab combination 
therapy with platinum-doublet chemotherapy as first-line treatment for patients 
with advanced NSCLC. The Markov model was created to simulate patients with 
advanced NSCLC who were receiving either nivolumab-ipilimumab combination 
therapy or platinum-doublet chemotherapy. Transition probabilities, including 
disease progression, survival, and treatment toxic effects, were derived using 
data from the CheckMate 227 clinical trial. Costs and health utilities were 
obtained from published literature. Data analyses were conducted from November 
2019 to September 2020.
EXPOSURES: Nivolumab-ipilimumab combination therapy.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary study outcomes were quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs) and cost in 2020 US dollars. Cost-effectiveness was measured 
using an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), with an ICER less than 
$100 000 per QALY considered cost-effective. Model uncertainty was assessed with 
1-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses.
RESULTS: Treatment with nivolumab-ipilimumab combination therapy was associated 
with an increase in overall cost of $201 900 and improved effectiveness of 0.50 
QALYs compared with chemotherapy, yielding an ICER of $401 700 per QALY. The 
study model was sensitive to the cost and duration of immunotherapy. Treatment 
with nivolumab-ipilimumab combination therapy became cost-effective when monthly 
treatment costs were reduced from $26 425 to $5058 (80.9% reduction) or when the 
maximum duration of immunotherapy was reduced from 24.0 months to 1.4 months. 
The model was not sensitive to assumptions about survival or programmed cell 
death 1 ligand 1 status. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis indicated that, at 
a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100 000 per QALY, nivolumab-ipilimumab 
combination therapy was less cost-effective than chemotherapy 99.9% of the time.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this study, first-line treatment with 
nivolumab-ipilimumab combination therapy was not found to be cost-effective at 
current prices despite clinical trial data indicating that this regimen 
increases overall survival among patients with advanced NSCLC.

BACKGROUND: Vanilla planifolia is an important tropical orchid for production of 
natural vanilla flavor. Traditionally, V. planifolia is propagated by stem 
cuttings, which produces identical genotype that are sensitive to virulent 
pathogens. However, propagation with seed germination of V. planifolia is 
intricate and unstable because the seed coat is extremely hard with strong 
hydrophobic nature. A better understanding of seed development, especially the 
formation of impermeable seed coat would provide insights into seed propagation 
and conservation of genetic resources of Vanilla.
RESULTS: We found that soaking mature seeds in 4% sodium hypochlorite solution 
from 75 to 90 min significantly increased germination. For the culture of 
immature seeds, the seed collection at 45 days after pollination (DAP) had the 
highest germination percentage. We then investigated the anatomical features 
during seed development that associated with the effect of seed pretreatment on 
raising seed germination percentage. The 45-DAP immature seeds have developed 
globular embryos and the thickened non-lignified cell wall at the outermost 
layer of the outer seed coat. Seeds at 60 DAP and subsequent stages germinated 
poorly. As the seed approached maturity, the cell wall of the outermost layer of 
the outer seed coat became lignified and finally compressed into a thick 
envelope at maturity. On toluidine blue O staining, the wall of outer seed coat 
stained greenish blue, indicating the presence of phenolic compounds. As well, 
on Nile red staining, a cuticular substance was detected in the surface wall of 
the embryo proper and the innermost wall of the inner seed coat.
CONCLUSION: We report a reliable protocol for seed pretreatment of mature seeds 
and for immature seeds culture based on a defined time schedule of V. 
plantifolia seed development. The window for successful germination of culturing 
immature seed was short. The quick accumulation of lignin, phenolics and/or 
phytomelanins in the seed coat may seriously inhibit seed germination after 45 
DAP. As seeds matured, the thickened and lignified seed coat formed an 
impermeable envelope surrounding the embryo, which may play an important role in 
inducing dormancy. Further studies covering different maturity of green capsules 
are required to understand the optimal seed maturity and germination of seeds.

PURPOSE: Extension of adjuvant endocrine therapy (ET) reduces the risk of 
recurrence in women diagnosed with ER-positive breast cancers, but a significant 
benefit is unlikely to happen to all individual patients. This study is aimed at 
evaluating the ability of different clinical late distant recurrence (LDR) risk 
stratification methods and in particular the clinical treatment score at 5 years 
(CTS5) to predict the response to extended adjuvant ET.
METHODS: 783 patients diagnosed with ER+ BC between 1988 and 2014 at Umberto I 
Hospital of Turin, of which 180 received an extended adjuvant ET, were 
retrospectively selected. They were stratified according to pT, pN, disease 
stage, tumor grade, Ki67 level, progesterone receptor status and CTS5. The 
primary endpoint was LDR rate. LDR rates according to ET duration were 
confronted in each subgroup.
RESULT: The median duration of extended ET was 7 years (6-10). Median follow-up 
from diagnosis was 9 years (6-26). Retrospective risk stratification according 
to tumor size, nodal status, disease stage, tumor grade, Ki67 level, and 
progesterone receptor status did not appear to be able to predict the response 
to extended ET. In the CTS5 high-risk subgroup instead, the risk of developing 
an LDR was significantly lower in the patients who underwent extended ET 
compared to standard ET (HR 0.37, 95% CI 0.15-0.91), while no significant 
benefit was demonstrated for low and intermediate-risk patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Risk stratification according to CTS5 appeared to be predictive of 
the response to extended endocrine therapy in our population of real-life pre 
and postmenopausal patients.

Osteoarthritis (OA) is one of the most frequent chronic joint diseases with the 
increasing life expectancy. The main characteristics of the disease are loss of 
articular cartilage, subchondral bone sclerosis and synovium inflammation. 
Physical measures, drug therapy and surgery are the mainstay of treatments for 
OA, whereas drug therapies are mainly limited to analgesics, glucocorticoids, 
hyaluronic acids and some alternative therapies because of single therapeutic 
target of OA joints. Baicalein, a traditional Chinese medicine extracted from 
Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi, has been widely used in anti-inflammatory 
therapies. Previous studies revealed that baicalein could alleviate cartilage 
degeneration effectively by acting on articular chondrocytes. However, the 
mechanisms involved in baicalein-mediated protection of the OA are not 
completely understood in consideration of integrality of arthrosis. In this 
study, we found that intra-articular injection of baicalein ameliorated 
subchondral bone remodelling. Further studies showed that baicalein could 
decrease the number of differentiated osteoblasts by inhibiting pre-osteoblasts 
proliferation and promoting pre-osteoblasts apoptosis. In addition, baicalein 
impaired angiogenesis of endothelial cells and inhibited proliferation of 
synovial cells. Taken together, these results implicated that baicalein might be 
an effective medicine for treating OA by regulating multiple targets.
