DESIGN: Markov decision model employing a societal perspective.
PATIENTS: Four hypothetical cohorts of American adults 60 years of age at 
progressively greater risk for sudden cardiac death (SCD): 1) all adults (annual 
probability of SCD 0.4%); 2) adults with multiple SCD risk factors (probability 
2%); 3) adults with previous myocardial infarction (probability 4%); and 4) 
adults with ischemic cardiomyopathy unable to receive an implantable 
defibrillator (probability 6%).
INTERVENTION: Strategy 1: individuals suffering an in-home cardiac arrest were 
treated with emergency medical services equipped with AEDs (EMS-D). Strategy 2: 
individuals suffering an in-home cardiac arrest received initial treatment with 
an in-home AED, followed by EMS.
RESULTS: Assuming cardiac arrest survival rates of 15% with EMS-D and 30% with 
AEDs, the cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained (QALY) of providing in-home 
AEDs to all adults 60 years of age is 216,000 dollars. Costs of providing 
in-home AEDs to adults with multiple risk factors (2% probability of SCD), 
previous myocardial infarction (4% probability), and ischemic cardiomyopathy (6% 
probability) are 132,000 dollars, 104,000 dollars, and 88,000 dollars, 
respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The cost-effectiveness of in-home AEDs is intimately linked to 
individuals' risk of SCD. However, providing in-home AEDs to all adults over age 
60 appears relatively expensive.

Summary for patients in
    Ann Intern Med. 2005 Apr 19;142(8):I39.

BACKGROUND: The Multicenter Automatic Defibrillator Implantation Trial 
(MADIT)-II demonstrated that implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) save 
lives when used in patients with a history of myocardial infarction (MI) and an 
ejection fraction of 0.3 or less.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the cost-effectiveness of implanting ICDs in patients 
who met MADIT-II eligibility criteria and were enrolled in the Duke 
Cardiovascular Database between 1 January 1986 and 31 December 2001.
DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis.
DATA SOURCES: Published literature, databases owned by Duke University Medical 
Center, and Medicare data.
TARGET POPULATION: Adults with a history of MI and an ejection fraction of 0.3 
or less.
TIME HORIZON: Lifetime.
PERSPECTIVE: Societal.
INTERVENTIONS: ICD therapy versus conventional medical therapy.
OUTCOMES MEASURES: Cost per life-year gained and incremental cost-effectiveness.
RESULTS: Compared with conventional medical therapy, ICDs are projected to 
result in an increase of 1.80 discounted years in life expectancy and an 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 50,500 dollars per life-year gained. 
Cost-effectiveness varied dramatically with changes in time horizon: The 
cost-effectiveness ratio increased to 67,800 dollars per life-year gained, 
79,900 dollars per life-year gained, 100,000 dollars per life-year gained, 
167,900 dollars per life-year gained, and 367,200 dollars per life-year gained 
for 15-year, 12-year, 9-year, 6-year, and 3-year time horizons, respectively. 
Changing the frequency of follow-up visits, complication rates, and battery 
replacements had less of an effect on the cost-effectiveness ratios than 
reducing the cost of ICD placement and leads.
LIMITATIONS: The study was limited by the completeness of the data, referral 
bias, difference in medical therapy between the Duke cohort and the MADIT-II 
cohort, and not addressing potential upgrades to biventricular devices.
CONCLUSIONS: The economic expense of defibrillator implantation in all patients 
who meet MADIT-II eligibility criteria is substantial. However, in the range of 
survival benefit observed in MADIT-II, ICD therapy for these patients is 
economically attractive by conventional standards.

Summary for patients in
    Ann Intern Med. 2005 Apr 19;142(8):I40.

BACKGROUND: Weaponized Bacillus anthracis is one of the few biological agents 
that can cause death and disease in sufficient numbers to devastate an urban 
setting.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of strategies for prophylaxis and 
treatment of an aerosolized B. anthracis bioterror attack.
DESIGN: Decision analytic model.
DATA SOURCES: We derived probabilities of anthrax exposure, vaccine and 
treatment characteristics, and their costs and associated clinical outcomes from 
the medical literature and bioterrorism-preparedness experts.
TARGET POPULATION: Persons living and working in a large metropolitan U.S. city.
TIME HORIZON: Patient lifetime.
PERSPECTIVE: Societal.
INTERVENTION: We evaluated 4 postattack strategies: no prophylaxis, vaccination 
alone, antibiotic prophylaxis alone, or vaccination and antibiotic prophylaxis, 
as well as preattack vaccination versus no vaccination.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Costs, quality-adjusted life-years, life-years, and 
incremental cost-effectiveness.
RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: If an aerosolized B. anthracis bioweapon attack 
occurs, postexposure prophylactic vaccination and antibiotic therapy for those 
potentially exposed is the most effective (0.33 life-year gained per person) and 
least costly (355 dollars saved per person) strategy, as compared with 
vaccination alone. At low baseline probabilities of attack and exposure, mass 
previous vaccination of a metropolitan population is more costly (815 million 
dollars for a city of 5 million people) and not more effective than no 
vaccination.
RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: If prophylactic antibiotics cannot be promptly 
distributed after exposure, previous vaccination may become cost-effective.
LIMITATIONS: The probability of exposure and disease critically depends on the 
probability and mechanism of bioweapon release.
CONCLUSIONS: In the event of an aerosolized B. anthracis bioweapon attack over 
an unvaccinated metropolitan U.S. population, postattack prophylactic 
vaccination and antibiotic therapy is the most effective and least expensive 
strategy.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy, safety, and long-term results, including 
continued clinical improvement and limb salvage, of percutaneous transluminal 
angioplasty (PTA) in patients with critical limb ischemia (CLI).
METHODS: From August 1993 to March 2004, 138 limbs in 111 patients with CLI 
(rest pain in 62 [45%] and ulcer/gangrene in 76 [55%]) were treated by PTA. In 
iliac lesions, stents were placed selectively for primary PTA failure: residual 
stenosis (>30%) or pressure gradient (>5 mm Hg). Stent placement was limited in 
infrainguinal lesions. The most distal affected arteries treated with 
angioplasty were the iliac artery in 45 limbs (33%; iliac group), the 
femoropopliteal artery in 41 limbs (30%; FP group), and tibial arteries in 52 
limbs (37%; BK group). All analysis was performed according to an 
intent-to-treat basis. Reporting standards of the Society for Vascular Surgery 
and the International Society for Cardiovascular Surgery were followed to 
evaluate initial success, and late follow-up status was evaluated with the 
Kaplan-Meier method. Patency was evaluated by using ultrasound scanning and 
ankle-brachial pressure index measurement.
RESULTS: There was one (0.9%) perioperative death. Twenty stents were placed 
selectively in 14 iliac arteries. Mean follow-up was 14.7 months (range, 1-75 
months). Overall, initial technical and clinical success rates were 96.4% and 
92.8%, respectively. The cumulative primary, assisted primary, and secondary 
patency; continued clinical improvement; and limb salvage rates +/- SE at 5 
years were 31.4% +/- 10.4%, 75.5% +/- 5.7%, 79.6% +/- 5.5%, 36.1% +/- 10.0%, and 
89.1% +/- 4.0%, respectively. In each subgroup, the primary, assisted primary, 
and secondary patency; continued clinical improvement; and limb salvage rates at 
3 years were 51.6%, 94.7%, 97.8%, 65.1%, and 95.0%, respectively, in the iliac 
group; 49.4%, 72.2%, 76.4%, 57.4%, and 92.7%, respectively, in the FP group; and 
23.5%, 41.8%, 46.1%, 51.1%, and 77.3%, respectively, in the BK group. Of the 12 
predictable variables, hypertension, multiple segment lesions, more distal 
lesions, and TransAtlantic Inter-Society Consensus classification type D were 
significant independent risk factors for the outcomes ( P < .05; univariate 
log-rank test and Cox regression multivariate analysis).
CONCLUSIONS: PTA is a feasible, safe, and effective procedure for the treatment 
of CLI. The high limb salvage rate is attributed to the high assisted primary 
and secondary patency rates despite the low primary patency rate. Angioplasty 
can be the primary choice for the treatment of CLI due to iliac and 
infrainguinal arterial occlusive disease.

INTRODUCTION: Morbid obesity (MO) is a chronic disease that is reaching epidemic 
proportions and becoming an increasing health problem in developed countries. 
Obesity-related comorbidities reduce both the quality and expectancy of life.
OBJECTIVES: To validate the GIQLI (Gastrointestinal Quality of Life Index) test 
as a reliable and effective tool for the evaluation of quality of life in 
morbidly obese patients.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: The GIQLI test is made up of 36 individually scored items, 
the addition of which give up a final score. A higher score correlates with a 
better quality of life. Items can be separated into five groups or dimensions: 
digestive symptoms, emotional status, effects of treatment, and physical as well 
as social dysfunction. The GIQLI test was administered to a randomized sample of 
1990 morbidly obese patients who fulfilled the indication criteria for bariatric 
surgery, and to a control group of 100 healthy individuals with no known 
medical, functional or psychiatric disease. Overall test and specific dimension 
scores were evaluated for each group.
RESULTS: Overall test and specific dimension scores were significantly lower in 
patients with MO when compared to the control group. The overall GIQLI score 
decreased as age increased, as did the number of associated comorbidities.
CONCLUSIONS: The GIQLI test proved to be a rather useful tool to evaluate 
quality of life in morbidly obese patients. These patients present a poorer 
quality of life not only because of the presence of digestive symptoms but also 
because of their emotional, physical, and social status.

CONTEXT: As the prevalence of obesity increases in the United States, concern 
over the association of body weight with excess mortality has also increased.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate deaths associated with underweight (body mass index [BMI] 
<18.5), overweight (BMI 25 to <30), and obesity (BMI > or =30) in the United 
States in 2000.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We estimated relative risks of mortality 
associated with different levels of BMI (calculated as weight in kilograms 
divided by the square of height in meters) from the nationally representative 
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) I (1971-1975) and 
NHANES II (1976-1980), with follow-up through 1992, and from NHANES III 
(1988-1994), with follow-up through 2000. These relative risks were applied to 
the distribution of BMI and other covariates from NHANES 1999-2002 to estimate 
attributable fractions and number of excess deaths, adjusted for confounding 
factors and for effect modification by age.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Number of excess deaths in 2000 associated with given BMI 
levels.
RESULTS: Relative to the normal weight category (BMI 18.5 to <25), obesity (BMI 
> or =30) was associated with 111,909 excess deaths (95% confidence interval 
[CI], 53,754-170,064) and underweight with 33,746 excess deaths (95% CI, 
15,726-51,766). Overweight was not associated with excess mortality (-86,094 
deaths; 95% CI, -161,223 to -10,966). The relative risks of mortality associated 
with obesity were lower in NHANES II and NHANES III than in NHANES I.
CONCLUSIONS: Underweight and obesity, particularly higher levels of obesity, 
were associated with increased mortality relative to the normal weight category. 
The impact of obesity on mortality may have decreased over time, perhaps because 
of improvements in public health and medical care. These findings are consistent 
with the increases in life expectancy in the United States and the declining 
mortality rates from ischemic heart disease.

Measurements of soft tissue volume in association with single-implant 
restorations: a 1-year comparative study after abutment connection surgery.

Henriksson K(1), Jemt T.

Author information:
(1)The Brånemark Clinic, Public Dental Health, Göteborg, Sweden.

BACKGROUND: Patients with buccal defects due to tooth extraction seem to regain 
some of the contour at the time of abutment surgery and connection of 
single-implant crown restorations. It can then be assumed that different 
abutment systems could restore the buccal contour to different degrees.
PURPOSE: To measure changes in buccal tissue volume after placing restorations 
with single-implant crowns using two different abutment systems and to measure 
soft tissue change during the 1 year after single-implant treatment.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighteen patients were provided with single-implant 
restorations in the central incisor area. Nine patients in each group were 
treated with single-implant crowns supported by either CeraOne abutments (Nobel 
Biocare AB, Göteborg, Sweden) or customized Procera ceramic abutments (Nobel 
Biocare AB). Study casts were made before abutment connection, at crown 
placement, and after 1 year. After the casts were scanned, they were analyzed 
with a computer, using the model before abutment as a reference. In the area of 
the single implant, sagittal projections provided images of the models that 
allowed measurements between the contours at the different situations. 
Radiography and photography for measuring papillary volume were also performed.
RESULTS: All patients exhibited increased "buccal volume" after abutment 
connection and crown placement (p < .01). A trend to greater increase was 
observed for the Procera group. Both groups also showed a reduction of buccal 
tissue 1 year later (p < .05-.01), leaving on average more volume in the Procera 
group. The papillae recovered spontaneously, and no relationship was observed 
between the presence of papilla and underlying bone support (p > .05).
CONCLUSIONS: The buccal tissue increased significantly after placement of the 
abutment cylinder and the implant crown. This increase of buccal contour was 
reduced after 1 year. Furthermore, no relationship was established between the 
presence of papillae and the distance between the contact point and the 
underlying bone crest.

Fixed implant-supported prostheses in elderly patients: a 5-year retrospective 
study of 133 edentulous patients older than 79 years.

BACKGROUND: An increasing number of elderly patients are treated with implants, 
but results for the elderly patient in terms of implant success and adaptation 
to implant prostheses are contradictory.
OBJECTIVE: To retrospectively study the 5-year clinical and radiologic 
performances of fixed implant-supported prostheses placed in edentulous elderly 
patients and to compare those results with the results of using similar 
prostheses in a control group of younger patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study group comprised 133 edentulous patients who 
were 80 or more years of age and who were consecutively treated with fixed 
implant-supported prostheses between January 1986 and August 1998. Altogether 
761 Brånemark System implants (Nobel Biocare AB, Göteborg, Sweden) were placed 
in 139 edentulous jaws. The control group comprised 115 edentulous patients who 
were younger than 80 years and who were treated consecutively from March 1996 to 
November 1997 with similar prostheses. In this group 670 implants were placed in 
118 edentulous jaws. Information was collected from all postinsertion visits, 
including the fifth annual checkup, and changes of marginal bone levels were 
analyzed from intraoral radiographs.
RESULTS: The 5-year cumulative survival rate (CSR) for implants in the maxilla 
was 93.0% in the study group and 92.6% in the control group; the corresponding 
CSRs for implants in the mandible were 99.5% and 99.7%. The most common 
complications for patients in the study group were soft tissue inflammation 
(mucositis) and cheek and lip biting (p < .05) whereas resin veneer fractures 
were the most common complications for the control group. Overall 5-year 
marginal bone loss for the study group was 0.7 mm (standard deviation [SD], 
0.45) in the upper jaw and 0.6 mm (SD, 0.50) in the lower jaw. Differences in 
bone levels and bone loss between the two groups did not reach significant 
levels (p > .05).
CONCLUSIONS: Implant treatment in the elderly patients showed treatment results 
comparable to those observed in younger age groups. However, indications of more 
problems with adaptation could be observed and were reflected in more 
postinsertion problems. Cleaning problems and associated soft tissue 
inflammation (mucositis) as well as tongue, lip, and cheek biting were 
significantly more often observed among the elderly patients (p < .05).

BACKGROUND: Few long-term follow-up studies on treatment concepts using computer 
numeric control-milled titanium frameworks have been conducted.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical and radiographic performance of 
implant-supported prostheses provided with computer numeric control-milled 
titanium frameworks in the edentulous jaw and to compare their performance 
during the first 5 years of function with that of prostheses provided with 
conventional cast gold alloy frameworks.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A consecutive group of 126 edentulous patients were 
randomly provided with 67 prostheses with titanium frameworks (test group) in 23 
upper jaws and 44 lower jaws and with 62 conventional prostheses with gold alloy 
castings (control group) in 31 upper jaws and 31 lower jaws. Clinical and 
radiographic 5-year data were collected for the test and control groups.
RESULTS: The frequency of problems was low, and clinical and radiologic 
performances were similar in both groups. In the test group, the 5-year 
cumulative survival rates (CSRs) were 94.9% and 98.3% for implants and titanium 
prostheses, respectively. The respective corresponding CSRs for the control 
group were 97.9% and 98.2%. More loaded implants were lost in the maxillas in 
the test group (p < .01), but this difference was not significant on the 
patient/prosthesis level (p > .05). Smokers lost more implants than nonsmokers 
lost (p < .01). Similar survival rates were observed for implants in the 
mandible. One prosthesis was lost in each group because of the loss of implants. 
Metal fractures were seen only in the control group, and resin veneer fractures 
were more frequent in the maxilla in the gold alloy group (p < .05). In the test 
group, the mean marginal bone loss was 0.5 mm (SD, 0.44) in the maxilla and 0.4 
mm (SD, 0.50) in the mandible. A similar pattern of bone reaction was observed 
in the control group. Mean marginal bone loss was similar for smokers and 
nonsmokers (p > .05).
CONCLUSION: Computer numeric control-milled titanium frameworks are a viable 
alternative to gold alloy castings in the edentulous jaw and present clinical 
and radiologic performances similar to those of conventional gold alloy 
frameworks during the first 5 years of function.

Delivery of health services is an important determinant of health. Restricted 
availability and access may result in health inequalities. To determine the 
extent of geographic variation in the delivery of health services and its effect 
on the health of community residents in terms of under-diagnosis and 
under-treatment of hypertension, we carried out a multilevel study of 
participants in the 1995 Nova Scotia Heart Health Survey (n = 3,094). We used 
individual level survey data and health status measurements linked to 
geographical level information to examine the importance of adequate delivery of 
health services to the diagnosis and treatment of hypertension in the universal 
health care setting of the province of Nova Scotia. The delivery of primary care 
services across Nova Scotia varied moderately with physician visit rates ranging 
from 3.3 to 5.5 visits per resident per year. There were neither substantial nor 
statistically significant differences in the diagnosis and treatment of 
hypertension among residents of communities varying in the delivery of health 
services. We concluded that a geographic variation in the delivery of primary 
care services is a public health concern that is not consistent with the 
objectives of universal coverage of health services; however, it was not 
confirmed to result in health inequalities.

PURPOSE: Cost-utility analyses (CUAs) have become increasingly popular, although 
questions persist about their comparability and credibility. Our objectives were 
to: 1) describe the growth and characteristics of CUAs published in the 
peer-reviewed literature through 2001; 2) investigate whether CUA quality has 
improved over time; 3) examine whether quality varies by the experience of 
journals in publishing CUAs, or the source of external funding for study 
investigators; and 4) examine changes in practices in US-based studies following 
recommendations of the US Panel on Cost-Effectiveness in Health and Medicine 
(USPCEHM). This study updates and expands our previous work, which examined CUAs 
through 1997.
METHODS: We conducted a systematic search of the English-language medical 
literature for original CUAs published from 1976 through 2001, using Medline and 
other databases. Each study was audited independently by two trained readers, 
who recorded the methodological and reporting practices used.
RESULTS: Our review identified 533 original CUAs. Comparing articles published 
in 1998 to 2001 (n = 305) with those published in 1976 to 1997 (n = 228), 
studies improved in almost all categories, including: clearly presenting the 
study perspective (73% vs. 52%, P < 0.001); discounting both costs and 
quality-adjusted life-years (82% vs. 73%, P = 0.0115); and reporting incremental 
cost-utility ratios (69% vs. 46%, P < 0.001). The proportion of studies 
disclosing funding sources did not change (65% vs. 65%, P = 0.939). Adherence to 
recommended practices was greater in more experienced journals, and roughly 
equal in industry versus non-industry-funded analyses. The data suggest an 
impact in methodological practices used in US-based CUAs in accordance with 
recommendations of the USPCEHM.
CONCLUSIONS: Adherence to methodological and reporting practices in published 
CUAs is improving, although many studies still omit basic elements. Medical 
journals, particularly those with little experience publishing 
cost-effectiveness analyses, should adopt and enforce standard protocols for 
conducting and reporting CUAs.

Variability of cost-effectiveness estimates for pharmaceuticals in Western 
Europe: lessons for inferring generalizability.

OBJECTIVES: It has long been suggested that, whereas the results of clinical 
studies of pharmaceuticals are generalizable from one jurisdiction to another, 
the results of economic evaluations are location dependent. There has been, 
however, little study of the causes of variation, whether differences in study 
results among countries are systematic, or whether they are important for 
decision making.
METHODS: A literature search was conducted to identify economic evaluations of 
pharmaceuticals conducted in two or more European countries. The studies 
identified were then classified by methodological type and analyzed to assess 
their level of variability and to identify the main causes of variation. 
Assessments were also made of the extent to which differences in study results 
among countries were systematic and whether they would lead to a different 
decision, assuming a range of values of the threshold willingness-to-pay for a 
life-year or quality-adjusted life-year (QALY).
RESULTS: In total 46 intercountry drug comparisons were identified, 29 in 
multicountry studies and 17 in comparable single country studies that were 
considered to be sufficiently similar in terms of methodology. The type of study 
(i.e., trial-based or modeling study) had some impact on variability, but the 
most important factor was the extent of variation across countries in 
effectiveness, resource use or unit costs, allowed by the researcher's chosen 
methodology. There were few systematic differences in study results among 
countries, so a decision maker in country B, on seeing a recent economic 
evaluation of a new drug in country A, would have little basis on which to 
predict whether the drug, if evaluated, would be more or less cost-effective in 
his or her country. Given the extent of variation in cost-effectiveness 
estimates among countries, the importance of this for decision making depends on 
decision makers' thresholds in willingness-to-pay for a QALY or life-year. If a 
cost-effectiveness threshold (i.e., willingness-to-pay) for a life-year or QALY 
of dollar 50,000 were assumed, the same conclusion regarding cost-effectiveness 
would be reached in most cases.
CONCLUSION: This review shows that cost-effectiveness results for 
pharmaceuticals vary from country to country in Western Europe and that these 
variations are not systematic. In addition, constraints imposed by analysts may 
reduce apparent variability in the estimates. The lessons for inferring 
generalizability are not straightforward, although the implications of variation 
for decision making depend critically on the cost-effectiveness thresholds 
applying in Western Europe.

therapy in COPD patients in different countries.

OBJECTIVES: The development of a probabilistic Markov model with a time horizon 
of 1 year to compare the cost-effectiveness of three bronchodilators: 1) the new 
long-acting anticholinergic tiotropium; 2) the short-acting anticholinergic 
ipratropium; and 3) the long-acting beta 2-agonist salmeterol, for the treatment 
of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in different 
countries. In this article we compare The Netherlands and Canada.
METHODS: The Markov model was structured along disease severity states and 
exacerbations. Transition probabilities between disease states and exacerbation 
probabilities were derived from patient-level data from six randomized 
controlled trials assessing the efficacy and safety of tiotropium. Resource 
utilization during exacerbations and maintenance treatment for The Netherlands 
were derived from two clinical trials, whereas for Canada these data were 
obtained from a countrywide observational study that used similar inclusion 
criteria as the trials. Second-order Monte Carlo simulations were undertaken in 
which values were randomly drawn from distributions of these parameters. 
Outcomes of the model are yearly treatment costs, exacerbations, and 
quality-adjusted life months.
RESULTS: The mean difference in the number of exacerbations was 0.17 (95% 
uncertainty interval: -0.02-0.37) in favor of tiotropium when compared with 
salmeterol and the difference between salmeterol and ipratropium was 0.12 
(-0.17-0.44) in favor of salmeterol. The number of quality-adjusted life months 
did not substantially differ between treatment groups and varied from 8.42 (SE 
0.41) in the tiotropium group to 8.17 (0.46) in the salmeterol group and 8.11 
(0.50) in the ipratropium group. In The Netherlands, costs in the tiotropium 
group were 42 Euros (-484-353) lower than in the salmeterol group, whereas costs 
in the salmeterol group were 128 Euros (-795-457) lower than in the ipratropium 
group. In Canada, costs were consistently lower than in The Netherlands and 
nearly the same in all treatment groups. Differences between the two countries 
were primarily a result of a higher length of hospital stay in case of an 
exacerbation in The Netherlands. The cost-effectiveness acceptability frontier 
of exacerbations showed that tiotropium was associated with the maximum expected 
net benefit for all values of the ceiling ratio above 0 Euros (The Netherlands) 
and 10 Euros (Canada) in the base case analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: This probabilistic model-based economic evaluation demonstrates how 
clinical trial data can be combined and integrated with country-specific 
information about resource utilization and unit cost to assess the 
cost-effectiveness of bronchodilators in COPD patients. Quality-adjusted life 
months did not substantially differ between treatment groups. In terms of 
exacerbations, tiotropium was associated with maximum expected net benefit for 
plausible values of the ceiling ratio. In sensitivity analyses, this outcome was 
most sensitive to changes in exacerbation rates.

An assessment of the impact of informative dropout and nonresponse in measuring 
health-related quality of life using the EuroQol (EQ-5D) descriptive system.

OBJECTIVES: To investigate the impact of imputing EQ-5D values to allow for 
informative dropout and nonresponse in a longitudinal assessment of the 
health-related quality of life (HRQL) of liver transplant recipients.
METHODS: The EQ-5D was administered at defined time intervals pre- and 
post-transplantation to all adults who were listed to receive liver transplants 
as National Health Service (NHS) treatment at each of the six Department of 
Health designated centers in England and Wales over a time-period of 36 months 
(12 month recruitment period and 24 month follow-up period). During the course 
of the study missing data arose for two main reasons, informative dropout and 
nonresponse. Informative dropout was accounted for by giving those patients who 
died an EQ-5D score of 0 and those patients who were too ill to respond to an 
EQ-5D score equivalent to the 5th percentile of respondents for each time point 
pretransplantation. Nonresponse was accounted for using relatively naive 
approaches (last value carried forward, and upper/lower 95% confidence interval 
around the mean) and contrasted with a more sophisticated multiple imputation 
method.
RESULTS: Adjusting for informative dropout in isolation resulted in a marked 
deterioration in mean scores over time pretransplant relative to the base case 
situation in which no such adjustments were made. Nevertheless, adjusting for 
informative dropout and/or nonresponders did not alter the base case conclusion 
of no statistically significant differences in mean EQ-5D scores over time 
pretransplant. In contrast, post-transplant data indicated highly statistically 
significant improvements in quality of life over time for the base case (P < 
0.001) whereas no statistically significant improvements over time were found 
when informative dropout was allowed for in isolation (P = 0.402) or when 
informative dropout and nonresponse were allowed for simultaneously (P = 
0.105-0.185).
CONCLUSIONS: It is important that future studies which purport to assess the 
HRQL over time of patients, such as these with end-stage liver disease, include 
an allowance for informative dropout and nonresponse within the analysis.

Changes in the disparities in chronic diseases during the course of the 20th 
century.

Longitudinal studies support the proposition that the extent and severity of 
chronic conditions in middle and late ages are to a large extent the outcome of 
environmental insults at early ages, including in utero. Data from the Early 
Indicators Project, undertaken at the Center for Population Economics, suggest 
that the range of differences in exposure to disease has narrowed greatly over 
the course of the 20th century, that age-specific prevalence rates of chronic 
diseases were much lower at the end of the 20th century than they were at the 
beginning of the last century or during the last half of the 19th century, and 
that there has been a significant delay in the onset of chronic diseases over 
the course of the 20th century. These trends appear to be related to changes in 
levels of environmental hazards and in body size. These findings have led 
investigators to posit a synergism between technological and physiological 
improvements. This synergism has contributed to reductions in inequality in real 
income, body size, and life expectancy during the 20th century.

This article examines how differences in longevity over time and across groups 
add to the typical measures of economic progress and intergroup differentials. 
We focus on gains for and differences between groups defined both by race (black 
and white) and by gender, relying on willingness to pay as our measure of the 
economic value of gains in longevity. Measured at birth, the gains for white 
males between 1968 and 1998 were about 245,000 dollars per person, while the 
gains for black males were far larger, about 390,000 dollars per person. The 
gains for women were somewhat smaller, with white females gaining about 150,000 
dollars per person and black females gaining about 305,000 dollars per person. 
Our estimates suggest that differences in income explain about 1/3 to 1/2 of the 
current black-white gap in longevity.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness and the impact of 
once-weekly administration of epoetin alfa (Ea) on the management of anaemia and 
on the quality of life (QOL) of cancer patients receiving chemotherapy. Eighty 
cancer patients with life expectancy > or = 24 weeks and haemoglobin (Hb) levels 
< 10.5 g/dL were studied. After an initial screening of patients' demographic 
and clinical characteristics, Ea 40000 U once a week was administered over a 
period of 4 months. In case of patients with Hb level exceeding > 14 g/dL or in 
case of non-response, the dosage was reconsidered. Every month, data regarding 
Hb levels, clinical variations, changes in the chemotherapy regimen and 
transfusion use since the last study visit, were evaluated. The Linear Analogue 
Scale Assessment scale was used for the evaluation of the QOL. The readmissions 
to hospital rates (P < 0.002) and the transfusion use rates (P < 0.003) were 
significantly decreased comparatively with baseline. A mean increase from 
baseline to the final Hb level (P < 0.001) was established, as well as a 
significant improvement in the functional ability, energy and in the overall QOL 
(P < 0.001). In conclusion, the treatment of cancer patients with Ea once-weekly 
is effective and safe, improving their haematological parameters and QOL.

Laparoscopic surgery for inguinal hernia repair: systematic review of 
effectiveness and economic evaluation.

McCormack K(1), Wake B, Perez J, Fraser C, Cook J, McIntosh E, Vale L, Grant A.

(1)Health Services Research Unit, Institute of Applied Health Sciences, 
University of Aberdeen, UK.

OBJECTIVES: To determine whether laparoscopic methods are more effective and 
cost-effective than open mesh methods of inguinal hernia repair, and then 
whether laparoscopic transabdominal preperitoneal (TAPP) repair is more 
effective and cost-effective than laparoscopic totally extraperitoneal (TEP).
DATA SOURCES: Electronic databases. Conference proceedings. Manufacturers' 
submissions to the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) were 
reviewed.
REVIEW METHODS: Selected studies were rigorously assessed. Dichotomous outcome 
data were combined using the relative risk method and continuous outcomes were 
combined using the Mantel-Haenszel weighted mean difference method. Time to 
return to usual activities was described using hazard ratios derived from 
individual patient data reanalysis. A review of economic evaluations undertaken 
by NICE in 2001 was updated and an economic evaluation was performed. The 
estimation of cost-effectiveness focused on the comparison of laparoscopic 
repair with open flat mesh. A Markov model incorporating the data from the 
systematic review was used to estimate cost-effectiveness for a time horizon up 
to 25 years.
RESULTS: Thirty-seven randomised control trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs met the 
inclusion criteria on effectiveness. Fourteen studies were included in the 
review of economic evaluations. Laparoscopic repair was associated with a faster 
return to usual activities and less persisting pain and numbness. There also 
appeared to be fewer cases of wound/superficial infection and haematoma. 
However, operation times are longer and there appears to be a higher rate of 
serious complications in respect of visceral (especially bladder) injuries. Mesh 
infection is very uncommon with similar rates noted between the surgical 
approaches. There is no apparent difference in the rate of hernia recurrence. 
Laparoscopic repair was more costly to the health service than open repair, with 
an estimated extra cost from studies conducted in the UK of about 300-350 pounds 
per patient. The point estimates of cost provided by the economic model also 
suggest that the laparoscopic techniques are more costly (approximately 100-200 
pounds more per patient after 5 years). From the review of economic evaluations, 
the estimates of incremental cost per additional day at usual activities were 
between 86 pounds and 130 pounds. Where productivity costs were included, they 
eliminated the cost differential between laparoscopic and open repair. 
Additional analysis incorporating new trial evidence suggested that TEP was 
associated with significantly more recurrences than open mesh but these data did 
not greatly influence cost-effectiveness.
CONCLUSIONS: For the management of unilateral hernias, the base-case analysis 
and most of the sensitivity analysis suggest that open flat mesh is the least 
costly option but provides less quality adjusted life years (QALYs) than TEP or 
TAPP. TEP is likely to dominate TAPP (on average TEP is estimated to be less 
costly and more effective). It is likely that, for management of symptomatic 
bilateral hernias, laparoscopic repair would be more cost-effective as 
differences in operation time (a key cost driver) may be reduced and differences 
in convalescence time are more marked (hence QALYs will increase) for 
laparoscopic compared with open mesh repair. When possible repair of 
contralateral occult hernias is taken into account, TEP repair is most likely to 
be considered cost-effective at threshold values for the cost per additional 
QALY above 20,000 pounds. The increased adoption of laparoscopic techniques may 
allow patients to return to usual activities faster. This may, for some people, 
reduce any loss of income. For the NHS, increased use of laparoscopic repair 
would lead to an increased requirement for training and the risk of serious 
complications may be higher. Chronic pain should now be addressed prospectively 
using standard definitions and allowing assessment of the degree of pain. More 
evidence is required on the loss of utility caused by persisting pain and 
numbness, as well as serious complications resulting from minor surgery. 
Prospective population-based registries of new surgical procedures may be the 
best way to address this, as a complement to randomised trials assessing 
effectiveness. Further research relating to whether the balance of advantages 
and disadvantages changes when hernias are recurrent or bilateral is also 
required as current data are limited. Methodologically sound RCTs are needed to 
consider the relative merits and risks of TAPP and TEP. Further methodological 
research is required into the complexity of laparoscopic groin hernia repair and 
the improvement of performance that accompanies experience.
