Traditionally, threshold levels of cost-effectiveness have been derived from 
willingness-to-pay studies, indicating the consumption value of health 
(v-thresholds). However, it has been argued that v-thresholds need to be 
supplemented by so-called k-thresholds, which are based on the marginal returns 
to health care. The objective of this research is to estimate a k-threshold 
based on the marginal returns to cardiovascular disease (CVD) hospital care in 
the Netherlands. To estimate a k-threshold for hospital care on CVD, we proceed 
in two steps: First, we estimate the impact of hospital spending on mortality 
using a Bayesian regression modelling framework, using data on CVD mortality and 
CVD hospital spending by age and gender for the period 1994-2010. Second, we use 
life tables in combination with quality of life data to convert these estimates 
into a k-threshold expressed in euros per quality-adjusted life year gained. Our 
base case estimate resulted in an estimate of 41,000 per quality-adjusted life 
year gained. In our sensitivity analyses, we illustrated how the incorporation 
of prior evidence into the estimation pushes estimates downwards. We conclude 
that our base case estimate of the k-threshold may serve as a benchmark value 
for decision making in the Netherlands as well as for future research regarding 
k-thresholds.

Durability is an important quality of dental restorative materials, and the 
ability to autonomously heal damage incurred during their oral function is 
highly desirable.
OBJECTIVE: The objective was to evaluate the improvement in durability of 
self-healing dental composites (SHDCs) in terms of their resistance to fracture 
and capacity for healing of damage under monotonic and cyclic loading.
METHODS: SHDCs were prepared by incorporating dental resin composites with 
microcapsules containing healing liquid. Control specimens with the same mass 
fraction (5% and 25%) of microcapsules filled with water were also evaluated. 
Two sets of SHDCs were distinguished by the silane coupling agents that 
functionalized and bonded the microcapsules to resin network. One set used a 
methacrylate silane (MA-silane) that connected resin network through covalent 
bonds, and the other used a H-bonding forming hydroxyl silane (OH-silane). The 
fatigue crack growth resistance was assessed in terms of the threshold stress 
intensity range and the conventional Paris Law parameters. Cyclic loading was 
conducted at 5 Hz with maximum cyclic load ranged between approximately 1 N and 
5 N. The efficiency of the autonomous healing was determined per the recovering 
of the fracture toughness and the extension of fatigue life.
RESULTS: The SHDCs with 5 wt% of healing microcapsules exhibited a larger 
fracture toughness than those with 25 wt% microcapsules. MA-silane SHDCs had 
approximately five times more responsive microcapsules triggered by fracturing 
of the composites. Consequently, the MA-silane SHDCs with 5 wt% of microcapsules 
achieved the best performance in terms of fracture toughness and healing 
efficiency. In regards to the fatigue crack growth behavior, there was a 
significant increase in the resistance to fatigue crack growth and 580 ± 15% 
improvement in the fatigue life.
SIGNIFICANCE: Strong silanization is vital in SHDCs to simultaneously achieve 
clinically applicable mechanical performance and substantial healing capability. 
Moreover, the evaluation of self-healing under cyclic loading is a promising 
tool in quantifying the degree of fracture-induced healing.

Vaccines constitute one of the main foundations of the public health system, 
improving the quality and life expectancy of people. The vaccination calendar 
must be extended to the whole life of a person and in recent years the 
vaccination of the adult has become more complex and requires a greater 
knowledge of it. The role of primary care health is essential in order to 
improve vaccination coverage given the patient's closeness and trust. It is 
important to know the recommendations on vaccination for reasons of age, 
underlying pathology, work circumstances or any other factor that may endanger 
health and be preventable by vaccination and at the same time have clear 
criteria of what should not be done in this countryside. An excess in 
vaccination can pose a risk to the health of the patient and a waste of 
resources.

Las vacunas constituyen uno de los pilares fundamentales de salud pública, 
mejorando la calidad y la esperanza de vida de las personas. El calendario 
vacunal debe extenderse a toda la vida de una persona y en los últimos años la 
vacunación del adulto se ha hecho más compleja y requiere un mayor conocimiento 
del mismo. El papel del personal sanitario de atención primaria resulta 
fundamental para conseguir mejorar las coberturas vacunales dada la cercanía y 
confianza del paciente. Es importante conocer las recomendaciones en materia de 
vacunación por motivos de edad, patología de base, circunstancias laborales o 
cualquier otro factor que pueda poner en riesgo la salud y sea prevenible 
mediante vacunación y a la vez tener criterios claros de qué no se debe hacer en 
este campo. Un exceso en vacunación puede suponer un riesgo para la salud del 
paciente y un despilfarro de recursos.

Despite the improvement in understanding its pathogenesis and the introduction 
of novel treatment options, the management of primary immune thrombocytopenia 
(ITP) still remains challenging. Considering its increased incidence with aging 
and prolonged life-expectancy, ITP is often diagnosed in elderly patients, a 
subset that deserves some special precautions. Ensure the diagnosis is a crucial 
step, and carefully attention must be given in excluding other causes of 
thrombocytopenia, especially among older people that frequently suffer from many 
comorbidities. When it comes to treatment decision, it is worth keeping into 
account that the elderly have an increased risk of bleeding, thrombosis and 
infections, that they often require many concomitant therapies, including 
antiplatelet or anticoagulant agents, and that treatment-related toxicities are 
often increased and sometimes more dangerous that the disease itself. There are 
not dedicated guidelines, and only few specific studies. Steroids with or 
without IVIG remain the first-line treatment. Splenectomy is less effective than 
in youngers and burdened by an increased thrombotic and infectious risk. 
Rituximab is a good option in non-immunocompromised patients, but long-term 
remissions are few. Eltrombopag and romiplostim have a good safety and efficacy 
profile, and have become a prominent drug in this subset, even if they are 
associated with a possible increased risk of thrombosis, and long-term toxicity 
is unknown. Other drugs, such as dapsone and danazol, have a well-known efficacy 
and safety profile, and still represent a valid option among elderly patients.

BACKGROUND: Understanding how socioeconomic events influence cause-specific 
mortality is essential for optimizing disease-control strategies. We 
characterized long-term trends in cause-specific mortality in a stable 
population from a very large urban centre.
METHODS: We derived population data from 1974 to 2015 on vital status, 
demographics and causes of death from the death registration system in Yangpu 
District, Shanghai, China. We examined temporal trends in mortality and assessed 
the effects of age, period and birth cohort.
RESULTS: Over 41 879 864 person-years of follow-up, we analyzed 290 332 deaths: 
3.80% from communicable conditions (group 1), 86.50% from noncommunicable 
diseases (group 2), and 5.56% from injuries (group 3). Age-standardized 
mortality decreased after 1988 for group 1 (average annual percentage change 
[AAPC] -6.7, 95% confidence interval [CI] -9.3 to -4.1), after 1995 for group 2 
(AAPC -2.9, 95% CI -3.5 to -2.3), and after 1994 for group 3 (AAPC -5.4, 95% CI 
-6.3 to -4.5), after improvements in public health and clinical service 
infrastructure and the removal of polluting industries during the 1980s. We 
observed increased mortality from group 2 and group 3 causes in those born 
between 1955 and 1965, a period that included the Great Chinese Famine. 
Cause-specific mortality risks increased in those born after 1949 for cancer and 
diabetes only.
INTERPRETATION: Birth cohorts exposed to extreme starvation in early life had 
increased premature cause-specific mortality in later life. Decreased 
cause-specific mortality followed improvements in public health, medical 
infrastructure and pollution control, but not for cancer or diabetes, likely 
because of exposure to new risk factors.

Duchenne muscular dystrophy is the most common form of childhood muscular 
dystrophy. A mutation in the DMD gene disrupts dystrophin (protein) production, 
causing damage to muscle integrity, weakness, loss of ambulation, and 
cardiopulmonary compromise by the second decade of life. Life expectancy has 
improved from mid-teenage years to mid-20s with the use of glucocorticoids and 
beyond the third decade with ventilator support and multidisciplinary care. 
However, Duchenne muscular dystrophy is associated with comorbidities and is a 
fatal disease. Glucocorticoids prolong ambulation, but their side effects are 
significant. Emerging investigational therapies have surfaced over the past 
decade and have rapidly been tested in clinical trials. Gene-specific strategies 
include nonsense readthrough, exon skipping, gene editing, utrophin modulation, 
and gene replacement. Other mechanisms include muscle regeneration, 
antioxidants, and antifibrosis and anti-inflammatory pathways. With potential 
therapies emerging, early diagnosis is needed to initiate treatment early enough 
to minimize morbidity and mortality. Newborn screening can be used to 
significantly improve early diagnosis, especially for gene-specific 
therapeutics.

Burden of Disease Due to Secondhand Smoke among Korean Adults at Sub-National 
Level.

Hail, Hail, Saudi Arabia.

of Medicine, Suwon, Korea.

BACKGROUND: Exposure to secondhand smoke (SHS) is one of the biggest health 
hazards. Quantifying the related burden of disease (BOD) is a powerful tool for 
making evidence-based policies. This study calculated the BOD due to SHS at 
sub-national level using the most recent statistics of Korea.
METHODS: SHS related diseases were selected by the systematic review of previous 
studies. Population attributable fraction (PAF) was calculated by using the 
standard formula using prevalence of exposure derived from Community Health 
Survey (CHS) 2013. SHS burden was calculated by multiplying nonsmoker's 
disability adjusted life years (DALYs) with PAF of SHS.
RESULTS: SHS burden at sub-national level ranged between 460 DALYs in Cheonan to 
5 DALYs in Pyeongtaek, Songtan region. Median of DALY was highest in districts 
of metropolitan cities and lowest in small towns and rural areas. Twelve out of 
fifteen regions with highest DALY per 1,000 were small towns and rural areas. 
Gender and age standardized DALY was highest in Seogwipo (west) in Jeju-do 
(1.66/1,000) and lowest in Dong-gu, Ulsan (0.17/1,000).
CONCLUSION: There were substantial variations between regions according to BOD. 
Regional governments should implement policies according to specific situation 
in each region and regular monitoring should be done by calculating BOD. Big 
cities need to focus more on control of active and SHS prevalence. Resources in 
small towns and rural areas need to be allocated more towards implementation of 
screening programs, early diagnosis and treatment of diseases especially in the 
elderly population.

OBJECTIVE: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) provides a significant 
symptom relief and mortality reduction in most patients; however, a substantial 
group of patients does not experience the same beneficial results according to 
physician-determined outcomes.
METHODS: Single-centre prospective design; the population comprises all 
consecutive patients undergoing TAVI in 2012-2017. TAVI futility was defined as 
the combined endpoint of either no symptomatic improvement or mortality at 
1 year. We actively gathered telephone follow-up using a predefined 
questionnaire.
RESULTS: Guideline defined TAVI futility was present in 212/741 patients. 
Multivariate regression showed lower albumin and non-transfemoral approach to be 
predictive for futility. In addition to these, chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease, lower estimated glomerular filtration rate, atrial fibrillation, 
low-flow-low-gradient aortic stenosis and lower Body Mass Index were predictive 
for 1-year mortality. Patients who showed symptomatic benefit estimated the 
percentage in which their symptoms were remedied higher than patients who did 
not (80% vs 60%, p<0.001). Guideline-defined TAVI futility occurs frequently, 
contrasting with patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs). The vast majority in 
both groups would again choose for TAVI treatment.
CONCLUSION: Lower albumin and non-transfemoral access route were predictors for 
guideline-defined TAVI futility, defined as mortality within 1 year or no 
objective symptomatic improvement in New York Heart Association class. Futility 
according to this definition occurred frequently in this study, contrasting with 
much more positive PROMs. The majority of patients would undergo a TAVI again, 
underlining the patients' experienced value of TAVI and putting the definition 
of TAVI futility further on debate. In the near future, less-strict criteria for 
TAVI futility, that is, using a shorter warranted life expectancy and 
incorporating patients' perceived outcomes, should be used.

National University Hwasun Hospital, Hwasun, Korea.

PURPOSE: With increasing life expectancy, the presence of comorbidities has 
become a major concern in elderly patients who require surgery. However, little 
is known about the impact of different comorbidities on the outcomes of 
laparoscopic total gastrectomy (LTG). In this study, we investigated the impact 
of comorbidities on postoperative complications in patients undergoing LTG for 
gastric carcinoma.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the cases of 303 consecutive 
patients who underwent LTG for gastric carcinoma between 2005 and 2016. The 
associations between each comorbidity and postoperative complications were 
assessed using univariate and multivariate analyses.
RESULTS: A total of 189 patients (62.4%) had one or more comorbidities. 
Hypertension was the most common comorbidity (37.0%), followed by diabetes 
mellitus (17.8%), chronic viral hepatitis (2.6%), liver cirrhosis (2.6%), and 
pulmonary (27.1%), ischemic heart (3.3%), and cerebrovascular diseases (2.3%). 
The overall postoperative morbidity and mortality rates were 20.1% and 1.0%, 
respectively. Patients with pulmonary disease significantly showed higher 
complication rates than those without comorbidities (32.9% vs. 14.9%, 
respectively, P=0.003); patient with other comorbidities showed no significant 
difference in the incidence of LTG-related complications. During univariate and 
multivariate analyses, pulmonary disease was found to be an independent 
predictive factor for postoperative complications (odds ratio, 2.14; 95% 
confidence interval, 1.03-4.64), along with old age and intraoperative bleeding.
CONCLUSIONS: Among the various comorbidities investigated, patients with 
pulmonary disease had a significantly higher risk of postoperative complications 
after LTG. Proper perioperative care for optimizing pulmonary function may be 
required for patients with pulmonary disease.

Disease burden in Norway in 2016.

[Article in English, Norwegian]

Tollånes MC, Knudsen AK, Vollset SE, Kinge JM, Skirbekk V, Øverland S.

BAKGRUNN: For å kunne møte helseutfordringer i befolkningen trenger vi oversikt 
over befolkningens helsetilstand. I Norge har vi tradisjonelt hatt god oversikt 
over dødsårsaker, men vi vet mindre om byrden fra tilstander som medfører 
sykelighet, såkalt ikke-dødelig helsetap. Vårt mål var å beskrive den totale 
sykdomsbyrden i Norge i 2016, utviklingen de siste ti årene samt 
kjønnsforskjeller i sykdomsbyrde.
MATERIALE OG METODE: Vi brukte resultater fra det globale sykdomsbyrdeprosjektet 
Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries and Risk Factors Study (GBD), som 
kvantifiserer ikke-dødelig helsetap slik at det kan måles på samme skala som 
dødelighet i form av tapte leveår. Summen av tapte leveår og ikke-dødelig 
helsetap gir sykdomsbyrdemålet helsetapsjusterte leveår (DALY).
RESULTATER: Ikke-smittsomme sykdommer som hjerte- og karsykdom, kreft, kronisk 
obstruktiv lungesykdom og demens var viktige årsaker til tapte leveår hos begge 
kjønn i Norge i 2016. Ikke-dødelig helsetap utgjorde 52 % av sykdomsbyrden målt 
i helsetapsjusterte leveår. Spesielt muskel- og skjelettsykdommer, psykiske 
lidelser og ruslidelser var viktige. De siste ti årene har sykdomsbyrden (i 
aldersjusterte rater) sunket for mange tilstander som medfører tapte leveår, men 
ikke for tilstander som gir ikke-dødelig helsetap.
FORTOLKNING: Ikke-dødelig helsetap utgjør en stor og økende andel av 
sykdomsbyrden i den norske befolkningen, noe som vil gi nye utfordringer for 
helsevesenet.

As dengue causes about 4,000 symptomatic nonfatal episodes for every dengue 
death globally, quantitative disability assessments are critical to assess the 
burden of dengue and the cost-effectiveness of dengue control interventions. 
This systematic analysis of disability or quality of life lost from a 
symptomatic nonfatal dengue episode combined a systematic literature review, 
statistical modeling, and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. We conceptualized 
a dengue episode as having two phases: acute and persistent symptoms. Our 
estimates for the acute phase, consisting of onset and recovery periods and 
defined as the first 20 days (0.054 year), were based on literature review. We 
searched PubMed, POPLINE, EconLit, Google Scholar, scientific conferences, and 
other sources, for "dengue" plus "quality of life" or related terms. From 4,322 
initial entries, six met our criteria (original studies with empirical data). 
The median disability-adjusted life year (DALY) burden for the acute phase was 
0.011 (95% certainty interval [CI]: 0.006-0.015) for ambulatory episodes, 0.015 
(CI: 0.010-0.020) for hospitalized episodes, and 0.012 (CI: 0.006-0.019) 
overall. Using literature reviews about persistent dengue, we estimated that 34% 
of episodes experienced persistent symptoms with a median duration of symptoms 
of 0.087 (CI: 0.040-0.359) year, which resulted in median DALYs of 0.019 (CI: 
0.008-0.082). Thus, the overall median DALY burden was 0.031 (CI: 0.017-0.092) 
for ambulatory episodes, 0.035 (CI: 0.024-0.096) for hospitalized episodes, and 
0.032 (CI: 0.018-0.093) overall. Our dengue-specific burden of a dengue episode 
was 2.1 times the 2013 Global Burden of Disease estimate. These literature-based 
estimates provide an empirical summary for policy and cost-effectiveness 
analyses.

This analysis of the Bulgarian health system reviews developments in its 
organization and governance, health financing, health care provision, health 
reforms and health system performance. With the 2015 National Health Strategy 
2020 at its core, there have been ambitious reform plans to introduce more 
decentralization, strategic purchasing and integrated care into the Bulgarian 
social health insurance system. However, the main characteristics of the 
Bulgarian health system, including a high level of centralization and a single 
payer to administer social health insurance, remain intact and very few reforms 
have been implemented (for example, the introduction of health technology 
assessment). There are multiple reasons for this, of which political fragility 
and stakeholder resistance are among the most important. Overall, Bulgaria 
marked notable progress on some health indicators (for example, life expectancy 
and infant mortality) but generally progress lags behind EU averages. What is 
more, the system has not been effective in reducing amenable mortality, as 
reflected in the unsteady improvement patterns in mortality due to malignant 
neoplasms. This is despite an increase in total health expenditure as a 
percentage of gross domestic product to 8.2% in 2015. The overall high 
out-of-pocket spending (47.7% of total health spending in 2015) has been growing 
and is increasingly worrisome. It evidences the low degree of financial 
protection by the Bulgarian social health insurance system and exacerbates the 
already considerable inequities along socioeconomic and regional fault lines. 
For instance, there are regional imbalances of medical professionals, which are 
more concentrated in urban areas, and accessibility to physicians is further 
deteriorating, especially in rural areas. Current reforms have to tackle these 
challenges and build consensus among stakeholders of the health system to unlock 
the standstill.

This analysis of the Austrian health system reviews recent developments in 
organization and governance, health financing, health care provision, health 
reforms and health system performance. Two major reforms implemented in 2013 and 
2017 are among the main issues today. The central aim of the reforms that put in 
place a new governance system was to strengthen coordination and cooperation 
between different levels of government and self-governing bodies by promoting 
joint planning, decision-making and financing. Yet despite these efforts, the 
Austrian health system remains complex and fragmented in its organizational and 
financial structure. The Austrian population has a good level of health. Life 
expectancy at birth is above the EU average and low amenable mortality rates 
indicate that health care is more effective than in most EU countries. Yet, the 
number of people dying from cardiovascular diseases and cancer is high compared 
to the EU-28 average. Tobacco and alcohol represent the major health risk 
factors. Tobacco consumption has not declined over the last decade like in most 
other EU countries and lies well above the EU-28 average. In terms of 
performance, the Austrian health system provides good access to health care 
services. Austrias residents report the lowest levels of unmet needs for medical 
care across the EU. Virtually all the population is covered by social health 
insurances and enjoys a broad benefit basket. Yet, rising imbalances between the 
numbers of contracted and non-contracted physicians may contribute to social and 
regional inequalities in accessing care. The Austrian health system is 
relatively costly. It has a strong focus on inpatient care as characterized by 
high hospital utilization and imbalances in resource allocation between the 
hospital and ambulatory care sector. The ongoing reforms therefore aim to bring 
down publicly financed health expenditure growth with a global budget cap and 
reduce overutilization of hospital care. Efficiency of inpatient care has 
improved over the reform period but the fragmented financing between the 
inpatient and ambulatory sector remain a challenge. Current reforms to 
strengthen primary health care are an important step to further shift activities 
out of the large and costly hospital sector and improve skill mix within the 
health workforce.

This analysis of the Spanish health system reviews recent developments in 
organization and governance, health financing, health care provision, health 
reforms and health system performance. Overall health status continues to 
improve in Spain, and life expectancy is the highest in the European Union. 
Inequalities in self-reported health have also declined in the last decade, 
although long-standing disability and chronic conditions are increasing due to 
an ageing population. The macroeconomic context in the last decade in the 
country has been characterized by the global economic recession, which resulted 
in the implementation of health system-specific measures addressed to maintain 
the sustainability of the system. New legislation was issued to regulate 
coverage conditions, the benefits package and the participation of patients in 
the National Health System funding. Despite the budget constraints linked to the 
economic downturn, the health system remains almost universal, covering 99.1% of 
the population. Public expenditure in health prevails, with public sources 
accounting for over 71.1% of total health financing. General taxes are the main 
source of public funds, with regions (known as Autonomous Communities) managing 
most of those public health resources. Private spending, mainly related to 
out-of-pocket payments, has increased over time, and it is now above the EU 
average. Health care provision continues to be characterized by the strength of 
primary care, which is the core element of the health system; however, the 
increasing financing gap as compared with secondary care may challenge primary 
care in the long-term. Public health efforts over the last decade have focused 
on increasing health system coordination and providing guidance on addressing 
chronic conditions and lifestyle factors such as obesity. The underlying 
principles and goals of the national health system continue to focus on 
universality, free access, equity and fairness of financing. The evolution of 
performance measures over the last decade shows the resilience of the health 
system in the aftermath of the economic crisis, although some structural reforms 
may be required to improve chronic care management and the reallocation of 
resources to high-value interventions.

This analysis of the Estonian health system reviews recent developments in 
organization and governance, health financing, health care provision, health 
reforms and health system performance. In 2017, the Estonian government took the 
historic step of expanding the revenue base of the health system, which has been 
a longstanding challenge. However, in terms of percentage of GDP it remains a 
small increase and long-term financial sustainability could still pose a 
problem. That said, if these additional funds are invested wisely, they could 
play a positive role in further improving the health system. Indeed, although 
Estonia has made remarkable progress on many health indicators (e.g. the 
strongest gains in life expectancy of all EU countries, strongly falling 
amenable mortality rates), there are opportunities for improvements. They 
include overcoming the large health disparities between socioeconomic groups, 
improving population coverage, developing a comprehensive plan to tackle 
workforce shortages, better managing the growing number of people with 
(multiple) noncommunicable diseases and further reaping the benefits of the 
e-health system, especially for care integration and clinical decision-making. 
Also in terms of quality, large strides have been made but the picture is mixed. 
Avoidable hospital admissions are among the lowest in Europe for asthma and 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), about average for congestive heart 
failure and diabetes, but among the worst for hypertension. Moreover, the 30-day 
fatality rates for acute myocardial infarction and stroke are among the worst in 
the EU. These outcomes suggest substantial room to further improve service 
quality and care coordination. The new NHP, which is currently being revised 
will be play a crucial role in the success of future reform efforts.

School, Boston, Massachusetts.

BACKGROUND: There has been increased utilization of surgical options for the 
treatment of end-stage unicompartmental arthritis in patients at both extremes 
of the age spectrum. The purpose of this study was to determine how these 
changing paradigms affected the lifetime cost-effectiveness of total knee 
arthroplasty (TKA), unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA), and nonsurgical 
treatment (NST).
METHODS: Using a Markov decision analytic model, we assessed how lifetime costs 
and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) vary as a function of age at the time of 
initial treatment (ATIT) of patients with end-stage unicompartmental knee 
osteoarthritis undergoing TKA, UKA, and NST. Separate models were estimated for 
ATITs at 5-year intervals from 40 through 90 years. Direct medical costs, QALYs, 
and transition probabilities were determined from the published literature. 
Indirect costs (lost wages, Social Security disability collections, and value of 
missed workdays) were calculated. Cost-effectiveness and incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated for each treatment at each 
ATIT. The model assumed no crossover from NST to UKA or TKA. ICERs were compared 
with a willingness-to-pay threshold of 50,000 U.S. dollars, and a 1-way 
sensitivity analysis was used to assess the robustness of ICER-based treatment 
decisions. Societal savings were estimated.
RESULTS: In the base-case model, surgical treatments were less expensive and 
provided a greater number of QALYs than NST from 40 to 69 years of age. From 70 
years of age and onward, surgical treatments remained cost-effective compared 
with NST, with ICERs remaining below the societal willingness-to-pay threshold. 
When surgical treatments were compared, UKA dominated TKA for all ATITs. The 
preferential use of UKA in all U.S. patients with unicompartmental 
osteoarthritis would result in an estimated lifetime societal savings of 987 
million to 1.5 billion U.S. dollars per annual wave of patients undergoing 
treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: In this preliminary assessment, recent expansion of surgical 
treatments into younger and older age demographics appears to be cost-effective 
in the setting of unicompartmental knee osteoarthritis. Our findings suggest 
that NST should be used sparingly in patients below the age of 70 years and UKA 
should be chosen over TKA in order to maximize cost-effectiveness.

BACKGROUND: The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) provides 
approximately US$70 billion annually to support food purchases by low-income 
households, supporting approximately 1 in 7 Americans. In the 2018 Farm Bill, 
potential SNAP revisions to improve diets and health could include financial 
incentives, disincentives, or restrictions for certain foods. However, the 
overall and comparative impacts on health outcomes and costs are not 
established. We aimed to estimate the health impact, program and healthcare 
costs, and cost-effectiveness of food incentives, disincentives, or restrictions 
in SNAP.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: We used a validated microsimulation model (CVD-PREDICT), 
populated with national data on adult SNAP participants from the National Health 
and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2009-2014, policy effects from SNAP 
pilots and food pricing meta-analyses, diet-disease effects from meta-analyses, 
and policy, food, and healthcare costs from published literature to estimate the 
overall and comparative impacts of 3 dietary policy interventions: (1) a 30% 
incentive for fruits and vegetables (F&V), (2) a 30% F&V incentive with a 
restriction of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs), and (3) a broader 
incentive/disincentive program for multiple foods that also preserves choice 
(SNAP-plus), combining 30% incentives for F&V, nuts, whole grains, fish, and 
plant-based oils and 30% disincentives for SSBs, junk food, and processed meats. 
Among approximately 14.5 million adults on SNAP at baseline with mean age 52 
years, our simulation estimates that the F&V incentive over 5 years would 
prevent 38,782 cardiovascular disease (CVD) events, gain 18,928 quality-adjusted 
life years (QALYs), and save $1.21 billion in healthcare costs. Adding SSB 
restriction increased gains to 93,933 CVD events prevented, 45,864 QALYs gained, 
and $4.33 billion saved. For SNAP-plus, corresponding gains were 116,875 CVD 
events prevented, 56,056 QALYs gained, and $5.28 billion saved. Over a lifetime, 
the F&V incentive would prevent approximately 303,900 CVD events, gain 649,000 
QALYs, and save $6.77 billion in healthcare costs. Adding SSB restriction 
increased gains to approximately 797,900 CVD events prevented, 2.11 million 
QALYs gained, and $39.16 billion in healthcare costs saved. For SNAP-plus, 
corresponding gains were approximately 940,000 CVD events prevented, 2.47 
million QALYs gained, and $41.93 billion saved. From a societal perspective 
(including programmatic costs but excluding food subsidy costs as an 
intra-societal transfer), all 3 scenarios were cost-saving. From a government 
affordability perspective (i.e., incorporating food subsidy costs, including for 
children and young adults for whom no health gains were modeled), the F&V 
incentive was of low cost-effectiveness at 5 years (incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio: $548,053/QALY) but achieved cost-effectiveness 
($66,525/QALY) over a lifetime. Adding SSB restriction, the intervention was 
cost-effective at 10 years ($68,857/QALY) and very cost-effective at 20 years 
($26,435/QALY) and over a lifetime ($5,216/QALY). The combined 
incentive/disincentive program produced the largest health gains and reduced 
both healthcare and food costs, with net cost-savings of $10.16 billion at 5 
years and $63.33 billion over a lifetime. Results were consistent in 
probabilistic sensitivity analyses: for example, from a societal perspective, 
1,000 of 1,000 iterations (100%) were cost-saving for all 3 interventions. Due 
to the nature of simulation studies, the findings cannot prove the health and 
cost impacts of national SNAP interventions.
CONCLUSIONS: Leveraging healthier eating through SNAP could generate substantial 
health benefits and be cost-effective or cost-saving. A combined food 
incentive/disincentive program appears most effective and may be most attractive 
to policy-makers.

Background: There are substantial differences in long term health outcomes 
across countries, particularly in terms of both life expectancy at birth (LEAB) 
and healthy life expectancy (HALE). Socio-economic status, disease prevention 
approaches, life style and health financing systems all influence long-term 
health goals such as life expectancy. Within this context, universal health 
coverage (UHC) is expected to influence life expectancy as a comprehensive 
health policy. The aim of the study is to investigate this relationship between 
Universal Health Coverage (UHC) and life expectancy. Method: A multi-country 
cross-sectional study was performed drawing on different sources of data (World 
Health Organization, UNDP-Education and World Bank) from 193 UN member 
countries, applying administrative record linkage theory. Descriptive 
statistics, t-tests, Pearson correlations, hierarchical linear regressions were 
utilized as appropriate. Result: Global average healthy life years was shown to 
be 61.34 ± 8.40 and life expectancy at birth was 70.00 ± 9.3. Standardized 
coefficients from regression analysis found UHC (0.34), child vaccination 
(Diphtheria Pertussis Tetanus-3: 0.17) and sanitation coverage (0.31) were 
associated with significantly increased life expectancy at birth. In contrast, 
population growth was associated with a decrease (0.29). Likewise, unit 
increases in child vaccination (DPT 3), sanitation and UHC would increase 
healthy life expectancy considerably (0.18, 0.31, and 0.40 respectively), 
whereas the same for population growth reduces healthy life expectancy by 0.28. 
Conclusion: Universal Health Coverage (UHC) is a comprehensive health system 
approach that facilitates a wide range of health services and significantly 
improves the life expectancy at birth and healthy life expectancy. This study 
suggests that specific programs to achieve UHC should be considered for 
countries that have not seen sufficient gains in life expectancy as part of the 
wider push to achieve the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG).

University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.

OBJECTIVES: Constraint-Induced Movement Therapy (CIMT) is an intervention method 
that can enhance cerebral palsy (CP) children's hand function. CP is a pervasive 
and common disorder which affects many aspects of a child life. Hemiplegic CP 
affects one side of a child's hand and has great effect on child's independence. 
We investigated the CIMT's studies conducted in Iran, and indicated the 
effectiveness of CIMT on duration and children age?
MATERIALS & METHODS: This systematic review was conducted using the electronic 
databases such as Medline PubMed, CINAHL, etc. performed from 1990 to 2016. 
Iranian and foreigner famous journals in the fields of pediatrics such as 
Iranian Journal of Pediatrics (IJP), Iranian Rehabilitation Journal (IRJ) and 
Google scholar with some specific keywords such as CP, CIMT, and occupational 
therapy were searched.
RESULTS: Overall, 43 articles were found, from which, 28 articles were removed 
because of lack of relevancy. Ten article were omitted because of duplication 
and exclusion criteria, so finally 15 articles were included.
CONCLUSION: CIMT is effective compared to no intervention but there are some 
inconsistencies regarding some parts of CIMT effectiveness such as its 
effectiveness on muscle tone and protective extension.

To date, there have been limited reports of oncogenesis occurring within 
pacemaker pockets. We report the case of a 100-year-old male who presented to 
the emergency department complaining of expansion of his pacemaker pocket over 
the period of 8 days. Dissection of the pacemaker pocket and pathological 
analysis of tissue samples revealed plasmablastic lymphoma, a subset of diffuse 
large B-cell lymphoma, commonly seen in immunocompromised elderly patients. This 
is the first known reported case of plasmablastic lymphoma occurring within a 
pacemaker pocket. <Learning objective: We describe the first case of a 
plasmablastic lymphoma arising as a primary tumor around a pacemaker site. A 
thorough literature review of primary tumors arising around pacemakers is 
provided. As the life expectancy of our population increases, the amount of time 
that pacemakers are in place increases as well. Therefore, we discuss several 
mechanisms that may have led to the oncogenicty of pacemakers, as well as the 
role of titanium in carcinogenesis.>.
