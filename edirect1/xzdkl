BACKGROUND: Long-term exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is associated 
with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D). However, limited data on trends 
in the global burden of T2D attributed to PM2.5, particularly in different 
regions by social-economic levels. We evaluated the spatio-temporal changes in 
the disease burden of T2D attributed to PM2.5 from 1990 to 2019 in 204 countries 
and regions with different socio-demographic indexes (SDI).
METHODS: This is a retrospective analysis with data from the Global Burden of 
Disease Study 2019 (GBD2019) database. The burden of T2D attributed to PM2.5, 
age-standardized mortality rate (ASMR) and age-standardized disability-adjusted 
life year rate (ASDR) were estimated according to sex, age, nationality and SDI. 
The annual percentage change (APCs) and the average annual percentage change 
(AAPCs) were calculated by using the Joinpoint model to evaluate the changing 
trend of ASMR and ASDR attributed to PM2.5 from 1990 to 2019. The Gaussian 
process regression model was used to estimate the relationship of SDI with ASMR 
and ASDR.
RESULTS: Overall, the global burden of T2D attributable to PM2.5 increased 
significantly since 1990, particularly in the elderly, men, Africa, Asia and 
low-middle SDI regions. The ASMR and ASDR of T2D attributable to PM2.5 in 2019 
were 2.47 (95% CI: 1.71, 3.24) per 100,000 population and 108.98 (95% CI: 74.06, 
147.23) per 100,000 population, respectively. From 1990 to 2019, the global ASMR 
and ASDR of T2D attributed to T2D increased by 57.32% and 86.75%, respectively. 
The global AAPCs of ASMR and ASDR were 1.57 (95% CI: 1.46, 1.68) and 2.17 (95% 
CI: 2.02, 2.32), respectively. Declining trends were observed in North America, 
South America, Europe, Australia, and other regions with high SDI.
CONCLUSIONS: Over this 30-years study, the global T2D burden attributable to 
PM2.5 has increased particularly in regions with low-middle SDI. PM2.5 remains a 
great concern on the global burden of diabetes.

Cost-effectiveness analyses using quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) are used 
in decision-making regarding which interventions are available via many national 
healthcare systems. QALYs are calculated based on health state values provided 
by preference elicitation techniques. Several national decision-making bodies 
recommend that health state values should be based on preferences elicited from 
general populations, rather than from patients. Previous studies have shown 
systematic differences between health state values elicited from members of the 
general population and from patients. Various explanations for this phenomenon 
have been proposed, however empirical evidence for these is scarce. We aimed to 
explore possible reasons for discrepancies between public and patient valuations 
by undertaking qualitative cognitive interviews, asking 14 members of the 
general population and 12 people with multiple sclerosis (MS) to think aloud 
while completing a preference elicitation task (time trade-off) for MS-related 
health states. The interviews were undertaken between December 2016 and October 
2017 in the South West region of England, and were analysed using the Framework 
Method. As anticipated, we found that participants with MS had more experience 
of health problems and used this experience to consider how they might adapt to 
the health states over time, and which dimensions of health-related quality of 
life were most important to them. We found no evidence that participants with MS 
were less affected by framing effects and focusing illusions, more likely to 
prioritise non-physical dimensions of health, or more prone to loss aversion, 
endowment effects and non-compensatory decision-making. These findings 
contribute to our understanding of how patients and members of the general 
population respond to preference elicitation exercises, and why their 
preferences may differ, and may help to inform developing areas of research, 
such as the joint presentation of cost-effectiveness results from multiple 
perspectives, and the use of preferences elicited from patients for experienced 
health states.

From 2016 to 2040 the number of people with dementia in the United Kingdom is 
expected to increase by 57%, while 70% percent of it is due to a higher life 
expectancy. Thus, we analyzed the overall and age-stratified effect of physical 
activity on risk of dementia in participants with mild cognitive impairment 
(MCI) of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA). Participants of the 
ELSA, aged over 50 with MCI, were followed-up nine times between 2002 and 2019. 
Physical activity was assessed using a self-reported, validated questionnaire 
and participants were classified as inactive, low, or moderate-to-high active. 
Medical diagnosis of dementia was self-reported or determined using the 
Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly. Data from 521 
participants with MCI were analyzed (56% women; mean [SD] age, 68.7 [10.6]). 
Over 17-year follow-up, 20.5 (95%CI: 17.3 to 24.2)% were diagnosed with 
dementia. The risk of incident dementia was reduced in participants engaging in 
low (HR: 0.34; 95%CI: 0.22 to 0.54) or moderate-to-high (HR: 0.16; 95%CI: 0.08 
to 0.33) levels of physical activity. Risk of dementia in adults aged 80 or more 
engaging in low or moderate-to-high levels of physical activity was not 
different from inactive adults aged between 50 and 69 years. Results were 
sustained after competing risk regression model and sensitivity analyses to 
reduce the impact of reverse causality. Physical activity appears to minimize 
the risk associated with aging in older adults with MCI.

INTRODUCTION: Frailty is a state of physiological vulnerability that negatively 
influences surgical outcomes. The effect of frailty on pituitary adenoma 
surgery, however, is not clear, and patients may be wrongly denied surgery 
because they are "too frail". We examined the effects of frailty on surgical 
outcome and quality-of-life (QoL) in patients undergoing endoscopic 
transsphenoidal resection of pituitary adenomas.
METHODS: A prospective, consecutive cohort of surgically managed pituitary 
adenoma was analysed. Frailty was defined by the 5-factor modified Frailty Index 
(mFI-5) and the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI). QoL was measured by the 
anterior skull base questionnaire (ASBQ) and sinonasal outcomes test (SNOT).
RESULTS: Of 304 patients with pituitary adenomas, 42 (13.8%) were frail (mFI5 
of > 1). Frail patients tended to have smaller adenomas (p < 0.0001) with less 
suprasellar extension (p < 0.0001). Both overall (ASBQ) and sinonasal-specific 
(SNOT) QoL were not affected by frailty on multivariate analysis. Endocrine and 
visual outcomes were similarly not worsened by frailty. Overall, medical 
complications were uncommon, and perioperative morbidity or mortality was not 
significantly greater in the frail group.
CONCLUSION: Frail patients experience the same QoL benefits from surgery as 
their non-frail counterparts, and have equivalently successful visual and 
endocrine outcomes. Frailty should not be seen as a barrier to successful 
surgical management of pituitary adenomas.

OBJECTIVE: To generate a value set for the Mexican adult general population to 
support and facilitate the inclusion of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) into 
the health technology assessment process of the Mexican healthcare authorities.
METHODS: A representative sample of the Mexican adult population stratified by 
age, sex and socio-economic status was used. Following version 2.0 of the 
EuroQol EQ-5D-5L valuation protocol, trained interviewers guided participants in 
completing composite time trade-off (cTTO) and discrete-choice experiment (DCE) 
tasks included in the EQ-VT software. Generalized least squares, Tobit and 
Bayesian models were used for cTTO data. The choice of value set model was based 
on criteria that included: theoretical considerations, parsimony, logical 
ordering of coefficients, and statistical significance.
RESULTS: Based on quality control criteria and interviewer judgment, 1000 out of 
1032 participants provided useable responses. Participants' demographic 
characteristics were similar to the 2010 Mexican Population Census and followed 
the socioeconomic structure defined by the Mexican Association of Marketing 
Research and Public Opinion Agencies (AMAI). The predicted index values in the 
final cTTO model (a heteroscedastic censored model with Bayesian estimation) 
ranged from - 0.5960 to 1, with 19.7% of all predicted health state scores less 
than 0 (i.e., worse than dead).
CONCLUSION: This study has generated the first value set representing the stated 
preferences of the Mexican adult population for use in estimating QALYs. The 
resulting EQ-5D-5L value set is technically robust and will facilitate health 
economic analyses as well as quality-of-life studies.

Patient and liver graft survival rates have improved significantly in the last 
decades, leading to complications mainly related to long-term immunosuppression. 
Prevention of, screening for metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease, de novo 
diabetes mellitus, renal dysfunction, and malignancies and their management are 
mandatory due to important causes of morbidity and mortality in this patient 
population. Quality of life (QoL) and functional benefits are clearly better 
compared to preoperative status; however, post-liver transplantation (LT) 
complications may impair and alter QoL scores. Individualized immunosuppression 
managed by transplant physicians and collaboration with other non-transplant 
specialists for recognition and treatment of medical complications and 
comorbidities after LT is the key to enhanced QoL and life expectancy of this 
patient population.

This study investigated the effects of an eight-week dual-task training with and 
without blood flow restriction (BFR) on muscle quality (MQ) biomarkers, physical 
and cognitive functions in older women. Twenty-four healthy volunteers 
(62.9 ± 3.1years) were randomly assigned into either dual-task (DT), DT with 
blood flow restriction (DTBFR), or control (C) group. The experimental groups 
performed cognitive tasks while walked on a treadmill at 45% of heart rate 
reserve (HRR), 20 min per session, three sessions per week for eight weeks. The 
cuff pressure for the DTBFR group was 50% of the calculated arterial blood 
occlusion and was increased by 10% every 2 weeks. Pre and post-training 
intervention, biomarkers of MQ and cognitive functions, body composition, 
maximal strength, and psychological status were measured. There was a 
significant interaction effect on BDNF, CAF, P3NP, body mass, BMI, fat 
percentage, visceral fat mass, and total fat mass (p<0.05). Furthermore, a 
significant interaction effect on knee extension, 30-s stand-up test, 6-min walk 
test, timed up&go test, and QOL was observed. There was a significant effect of 
time on MMSE, sleep quality, and mood score. These findings suggested that 
including BFR to DT training result in greater physiological and psychological 
responses and should be considered a training method to combat undesired changes 
associated with increasing age.

Phages are one of the key components in the structure, dynamics, and 
interactions of microbial communities in different bins. It has a clear impact 
on human health and the food industry. Bacteriophage characterization using in 
vitro approaches are time/cost consuming and laborious tasks. On the other hand, 
with the advent of new high-throughput sequencing technology, the development of 
a powerful computational framework to characterize the newly identified 
bacteriophages is inevitable for future research. Machine learning includes 
powerful techniques that enable the analysis of complex datasets for knowledge 
discovery and pattern recognition. In this study, we have conducted a 
comprehensive review of machine learning methods application using different 
types of features were applied in various aspects of bacteriophage research 
including, automated curation, identification, classification, host species 
recognition, virion protein identification, and life cycle prediction. Moreover, 
potential limitations and advantages of the developed frameworks were discussed.

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive monogenic disease caused by 
mutations in the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane conductance Regulator (CFTR) 
gene. Although F508del is the most frequent mutation, there are in total 360 
confirmed disease-causing CFTR mutations, impairing CFTR production, function 
and stability. Currently, the only causal treatments available are CFTR 
correctors and potentiators that directly target the mutant protein. While these 
pharmacological advances and better symptomatic care have improved life 
expectancy of people with CF, none of these treatments provides a cure. The 
discovery and development of programmable nucleases, in particular CRISPR 
nucleases and derived systems, rekindled the field of CF gene therapy, offering 
the possibility of a permanent correction of the CFTR gene. In this review we 
will discuss different strategies to restore CFTR function via gene editing 
correction of CFTR mutations or enhanced CFTR expression, and address how best 
to deliver these treatments to target cells.

PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to assess the efficacy in terms of neck 
failure of an initial neck dissection before definitive chemoradiotherapy in 
N2-3 oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas, as well as the dosimetric impact 
and the acute and delayed morbidity of this approach.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: All patients consecutively treated between 2009 and 2018 
with definitive chemoradiotherapy using intensity-modulated conformal 
radiotherapy (IMRT) for a histologically proven N2-3 oropharyngeal squamous cell 
carcinomas were retrospectively included. The therapeutic approach consisted of 
induction chemotherapy, followed by cisplatine-based chemoradiotherapy preceded 
or not by neck dissection. Neck dissection was discussed on a case-by-case basis 
in a dedicated multidisciplinary tumour board for patients with a dissociated 
response to induction chemotherapy, defined as a better response on the primary 
than on the node. Chemoradiotherapy without neck dissection was systematically 
performed in case of a major lymph node response to induction chemotherapy 
(decrease in size of 90% or more). Intensity-modulated radiotherapy using a 
simultaneous-integrated boost delivered 70Gy in 35 fractions on macroscopic 
tumour volumes, 63Gy on intermediate-risk levels or extra-nodal extension and 
54Gy on prophylactic lymph node areas.
RESULTS: Two groups were constituted: 47 patients without an initial neck 
dissection (62.7%), and 28 patients with a neck dissection prior to definitive 
chemoradiotherapy (37.3%). Initial patient characteristics were not 
statistically different between the two groups. The median follow-up was 
60.1months (range: 3.2-119months). Incidence of neck failure was higher in 
patients without neck dissection (P=0.015). The neck failure rate at 5years was 
19.8% (95% confidence interval: 7.4-30.6%; P=0.015) without neck dissection 
versus 0% following neck dissection. All lymph node failures occurred in the 
planned target volume at 70Gy. Upfront neck dissection suggested a decrease in 
the mean dose received by the homolateral parotid gland (P=0.01), mandible 
(P=0.02), and thyroid gland (P=0.02). Acute toxicity of chemoradiotherapy after 
neck dissection suggested a reduction in grade≥3 adverse events (P=0.04), early 
discontinuation of concomitant chemotherapy (P=0.009) and feeding 
tube-dependence (P=0.008) in univariate analysis. During follow-up, there was no 
difference between the two groups in terms of xerostomia, dysgeusia, dysphagia 
or gastrostomy dependence in univariate analysis.
CONCLUSION: Neck dissection prior to definitive chemoradiotherapy in N2-3 
oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma was associated with high neck control 
without additional mid and long-term morbidity.

INTRODUCTION: Screening for peripheral artery disease (PAD) with the 
ankle-brachial index (ABI) test is currently not recommended in the general 
population; however, previous studies advocate screening in high-risk 
populations. Although providers may be hesitant to prescribe low-dose 
rivaroxaban to patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) alone, given the 
reduction in cardiovascular events and death associated with rivaroxaban, 
screening for PAD with the ABI test and accordingly prescribing rivaroxaban may 
provide additional benefits. We sought to describe the cost-effectiveness of 
screening for PAD in patients with CAD to optimize this high-risk populations' 
medical management.
METHODS: We used a Markov model to evaluate the ABI test in patients with CAD. 
We assumed that all patients screened would be candidates for low-dose 
rivaroxaban. We assessed the cost of ABI screening at $100 per patient and added 
additional charges for physician visits ($100) and rivaroxaban cost ($470 per 
month). We used a 30-day cycle and performed analysis over 35 years. We 
evaluated quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) from previous studies and 
determined the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) according to our 
model. We performed a deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses of 
variables with uncertainty and reported them in a Tornado diagram showing the 
variables with the greatest effect on the ICER.
RESULTS: Our model estimates decision costs to screen or not screen at $94,953 
and $82,553, respectively. The QALYs gained from screening was 0.060, generating 
an ICER of $207,491 per QALY. Factors most influential on the ICER were the 
reduction in all-cause mortality associated with rivaroxaban and the 
prohibitively high cost of rivaroxaban. If rivaroxaban cost less than $95 per 
month, this would make screening cost-effective based on a willingness to pay 
threshold of $50,000 per QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: According to our model, screening patients with CAD for PAD to 
start low-dose rivaroxaban is not currently cost-effective due to insufficient 
reduction in all-cause mortality and high medication costs. Nevertheless, 
vascular surgeons have a unique opportunity to prescribe or advocate for 
low-dose rivaroxaban in patients with PAD to improve cardiovascular outcomes.

OBJECTIVES: Recent controversies on the use of drug coated/eluting devices in 
the arteries of the lower extremities renewed the focus on the evaluation of 
more conventional techniques. The results of the stenting of short and/or 
intermediate femoro-popliteal lesions are well known, but little data relate to 
the endovascular treatment of long femoro-popliteal lesions with contiguous bare 
metal stents (ETLFBS). The objective of this study was to report our results of 
ETLFBS.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Between January 2014 and December 2017, 1233 patients had 
an infrainguinal angioplasty in our center. The files of patients treated for 
femoropopliteal lesions longer than 250 mm using extensive stenting with 
contiguous bare metal stents were reviewed and analyzed. The primary outcome was 
the 12-month primary patency, defined by the absence of restenosis (≥50%) and/or 
reintervention on the target lesion. Continuous data were expressed as mean and 
standard deviation. Survival analysis was carried out according to Kaplan-Meier.
RESULTS: Overall, 64 patients aged 80 ± 11 years were included, with 49 (76.6%) 
presenting with critical limb ischemia. Lesions were classified as TASC D in 
54.7% of the cases. The length of the lesions was 295 ± 64 mm and 3 ± 1 stents 
were implanted. The 30-day mortality was null but two patients (3.1%) presented 
nonvascular major complications. With a follow-up of 27 ± 17 months, 22 patients 
(34.3%) died including three of vascular causes. The healing of the trophic 
disorder was obtained in 77.5% of the cases. The rate of amputation was 10.9%. 
The 6-, 12-, and 24-month primary patency rates were 79.7%, 66.6%, and 60.9%, 
respectively. The 6-, 12-, and 24-month rates of freedom from target lesion 
revascularization were 96.3%, 73.9%, and 71.9%, respectively. The 6-, 12-, and 
24-month survival rates were 90.3%, 83.6%, and 65.6%, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The 12-month primary patency rate of ETLFBS is acceptable. This 
strategy constitutes an acceptable alternative in patients presenting with 
critical limb ischemia and a limited life expectancy.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate community-based health workers' ability to identify 
cases of hypertension in pregnancy, safely deliver methyldopa and magnesium 
sulphate and make referrals when appropriate.
STUDY DESIGN: This was part of Nigeria Community-Level Interventions for 
Pre-eclampsia (CLIP) cluster randomized controlled trial (NCT01911494). 
Community-based Health Workers (CHW) recruited pregnant women from five Local 
Government Areas (clusters) and used mobile health aid for clinical assessment 
of pre-eclampsia.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was the number of adverse events that 
occurred after the administration of magnesium sulphate and/or methyldopa to 
pregnant women by CHWs.
FINDINGS: Of 8790 women receiving mobile health-guided care, community-based 
health workers in Nigeria provided 309 women with hypertension (4.2% of 
delivered women), and safely administered 142 doses of intramuscular magnesium 
sulphate. Community Heath Extension Workers (CHEWs) and nurses gave fifty-two 
and sixty-seven doses of intramuscular magnesium sulphate respectively, 
twenty-three doses were given by other health care workers (midwives, community 
health officers, health assistants). The high rate of administration by nurses 
can be explained by turf protection as well as their seniority within the health 
system. Also, CHEWs and nurses gave 124 doses of oral methyldopa and 126 urgent 
referrals were completed. There were no complications related to administration 
of treatment or referral.
INTERPRETATION: These findings demonstrate the ability of community-based health 
workers to safely administer methyldopa and intramuscular magnesium sulphate. 
The use of task-sharing, therefore, could drastically reduce the three delays 
(triage, transport and treatment) associated with high maternal mortality and 
morbidity in rural communities in low- and middle-income countries.

Floating plastic debris was investigated in the transition region in the North 
Pacific between 141°E and 165°W to understand its transportation process from 
Asian coast to central subtropical Pacific. Distribution was influenced 
primarily by the current system and the generation process of the high 
concentration area differed between the western and eastern areas. West of 180°, 
debris largely accumulated around nearshore convergent area and was transported 
by eddies and quasi-stationary jet from south to the subarctic region. The 
average was 15% higher than that previously reported in 1989, suggesting an 
increase in plastic debris in 30 years. East of 180°, debris concentrated in the 
calm water downstream of the Kuroshio Extension Bifurcation with considerably 
high concentration (505,032 ± 991,989 pieces km-2), due to the accumulation of 
small transparent film caused by calm weather conditions, suggesting a further 
investigation on small plastic (<1 mm) in the subsurface depth in the 
subtropical North Pacific.

Comment in
    J Urol. 2023 Jan;209(1):275-277.

BACKGROUND: Increasing life expectancy and demographic change result in a rising 
number of geriatric patients, but knowledge about geriatric treatment options 
and adapted diagnostic pathways is low. Simultaneously, urinary tract infections 
(UTIs) are common in older people and often difficult to treat.
METHODS: Patients with a UTI at a urological outpatient department between 
January 01, 2016, and December 31, 2017, were retrospectively identified in the 
data system. One thousand one hundred fifteen patients with "N30" and "N39" 
diagnosis were included in this study, 965 of which were under the age of 75 
(group 1) and 150 of which 75 years or older (group 2).
RESULTS: Of 150 patients in group 2, 41.6% had nitrite-positive urine (vs. 20.9% 
in group 1, p < 0.05 in χ2 testing). Patients in group 2 often had indwelling 
devices (30.3 vs. 6.0%, p < 0.05) and presented a sterile urine culture in only 
20.7% (vs. 40.1% in group 1). Regarding calculated antibiotic therapy, there 
were significant differences concerning prescription of ciprofloxacin (34.9 vs. 
25%, p < 0.05) and fosfomycin (12.7 vs. 40.7%, p < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: UTI in geriatric patients should be treated differently than in 
younger patients because antibiotic resistance is high. The group with 
indwelling devices is complex. Individual strategies for geriatric patients 
should be considered.

Hospital, University of Health Sciences, Bursa, Turkey.

BACKGROUND: Schizophrenia is known to be accompanied with increased 
cardiovascular mortality, which causes reduced life expectancy.
AIM: The aim of the current study was to investigate if atherogenic index of 
plasma (AIP) could be a good marker in assessing cardiovascular disease (CVD) 
risk in patients with schizophrenia.
METHODS: Patients with schizophrenia (n = 328) and healthy controls (n = 141) 
were recruited. Schizophrenia patients were evaluated according to the presence 
of antipsychotic (AP) drug use as AP(+)Sch group and AP(-)Sch group. Atherogenic 
indices, such as AIP, Castelli's risk index-I (CRI-I), Castelli's risk index-II 
(CRI-II), and atherogenic coefficient (AC), were calculated according to the 
laboratory examination of serum lipid parameters.
RESULTS: According to the comparison of serum lipid levels, triglyceride (TG) 
levels were found to be highest and high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol levels 
were lowest in AP(+)Sch group than AP(-)Sch group and control group (CG) 
(p < 0.001). AIP, CRI-I, and CRI-II scores were found to be significantly higher 
in AP(+)Sch group than AP(-)Sch group, and in AP(-)Sch than healthy controls 
(p < 0.001). Mean AC scores were higher in AP(+)Sch group than both AP(-)Sch and 
CG and were similar in AP(-)Sch and control subjects (p < 0.001). According to 
the correlation analysis, AIP scores were positively correlated with duration of 
disease (r = 0.235; p = 0.002) and age (r = 0.226; p = 0.003) in AP(+)Sch group 
but not in drug-free subjects. In all groups, atherogenic indices of CRI-I, 
CRI-II, and AC scores were found to be positively correlated with AIP scores 
(p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that AIP is an easily calculable and reliable 
marker for determining the CVD risk in both drug-free schizophrenia patients and 
patients under AP treatment.

Knowledge of the behavioral ecology of marmosets carried out in their natural 
habitat associated with the advent of a non-invasive technique for measuring 
steroid hormones in feces has made a significant contribution to understanding 
their social relationships and sexual strategies. These studies showed that they 
are mainly monogamous, live in relatively stable social groups according to a 
social hierarchy in which females compete and males cooperate, and form social 
bonds similar to humans, which makes this species a potential animal model to 
study disorders related to social stress. In addition, laboratory studies 
observed the expression of behaviors similar to those in nature and deepened the 
descriptions of their social and reproductive strategies. They also 
characterized their responses to the challenge using behavioral, cognitive, 
physiological, and genetic approaches that were sexually dimorphic and 
influenced by age and social context. These findings, added to some advantages 
which indicate good adaptation to captivity and the benefits of the birth of 
twins, small size, and life cycle in comparison to primates of the Old World, 
led to their use as animal models for validating psychiatric diseases such as 
major depression. Juvenile marmosets have recently been used to develop a 
depression model and to test a psychedelic brew called Ayahuasca from the Amazon 
rainforest as an alternative treatment for major depression, for which positive 
results have been found which encourage further studies in adolescents. 
Therefore, we will review the experimental evidence obtained so far and discuss 
the extension of the marmoset as an animal model for depression.

Background: If the diagnosis of neuroendocrine neoplasm (NEN) increases the risk 
of patients to commit suicide has not been investigated so far. Identifying NEN 
patients at risk to commit suicide is important to increase their life quality 
and life expectancy. Methods and findings: Cancer cases were extracted from the 
Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program and were divided into the 
NEN and the non-NEN cohorts. Subsequently, the NEN patients were randomly split 
into a training data set and a validation data set. Analyzing the training data 
set, we developed a score for assessing the risk to commit suicide for patients 
with NEN. In addition, we validated the score using the validation data set and 
evaluated, if this score could also be applied to other cancer entities by using 
the test data set, a non-NEN cohort. The odds ratio (OR) of suicide between NEN 
and non-NEN patients was determined. Moreover, the performance of a score was 
evaluated by the receiver operating characteristic curve and the area under the 
curve (AUC). Compared to non-NEN, NEN significantly increased the risk of 
suicide to 1.8-fold (NEN vs. non-NEN; OR, 1.832; P < 0.001). In addition, we 
observed that age, gender, race, marital status, tumor stage, histologic grade, 
surgery, and chemotherapy were associated with suicide among NEN patients; and a 
synthesized score based on these factors could significantly distinguish suicide 
individuals from non-suicide individuals in the training data set (AUC, 0.829; P 
< 0.001) and in the validation data set (AUC, 0.735; P < 0.001). This score also 
had a good performance when it was assessed by the test data set (AUC, 0.690; P 
< 0.001). This demonstrates that the score might also be applicable to other 
cancer entities. Conclusions: This population-based study suggests that NEN 
patients have a higher risk of suicide than non-NEN patients. In addition, this 
study provided a score, which can identify NEN patients at high-risk of 
committing suicide. Thus, this score in combination with current screening and 
prevention strategies for suicide may improve life quality and life expectancy 
of NEN patients.
