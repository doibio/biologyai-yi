OBJECTIVE: The aim was to examine the real-world cost-effectiveness of 
breast-conserving surgery (BCS) plus hormonal therapy with radiotherapy, 
compared to hormonal therapy alone among women 66 and older with hormone 
receptor positive early-stage breast cancer in the United States (US).
METHODS: This study was conducted from a U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid 
Services perspective and an eight-year time horizon. Both costs (2020 US$) and 
health utilities (quality-adjusted life years, QALYs) were obtained from 
retrospective studies using the SEER linked with Medicare and Medicare Health 
Outcomes Survey, respectively. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) 
of the addition of radiotherapy to hormonal therapy versus hormonal therapy 
alone after BCS was estimated by an unbiased doubly robust estimator. 
Sensitivity analyses were conducted through bootstrapping to estimate credible 
intervals.
RESULTS: The addition of radiotherapy to hormonal therapy after BCS yielded the 
highest clinical benefits (2.66 QALYs) and costs ($19,424.27) compared to its 
hormonal therapy alone after BCS (0.77 QALYS; $2,028.58). The ICER was estimated 
to be $9,174.94/QALY. Sensitivity analyses did not change the direction of the 
findings.
CONCLUSIONS: The results implicated that the combination of radiotherapy and 
hormonal therapy is cost-effective in the US.

BACKGROUND: Transition from childhood to adulthood (TCA) is usually difficult in 
rare, progressive and multisystemic diseases. New treatments and modalities of 
care for many lysosomal diseases (LD) can increase life expectancy, and a 
successful TCA can help patient who reach adulthood to avoid disruption to 
health care. In France, some TCA initiatives have been taken by referral centers 
but in view of the problems encountered by Vaincre les Maladies Lysosomales 
(VML), the LD patient association, they seem to be insufficient. The aim of this 
study is to determine the current state of the TCA process and to identify 
actions to improve it through interviews with patient families and physicians in 
LD referral centers. The study is based upon an observational, 
non-interventional, cross-sectional, national survey which used two anonymous 
questionnaires. These questionnaires, developed by a scientific committee 
including representatives from VML and medical specialists in LD, were sent to 
patients who were receiving care in pediatric departments at age 15 years or 
older. Questionnaires were also sent to their referral pediatricians.
RESULTS: Fifty-four patients were included. Forty-two questionnaires were 
completed by patients and their corresponding physicians and 12 were completed 
by physicians only. The majority of the patients (80%) were informed that 
transfer to adult healthcare would occur, but 52% were informed after their 
eighteenth birthday. Forty-eight percent indicated that they were informed that 
a TCA coordinator would be appointed; for 39% the time frame for the transfer 
was communicated, and 31% were informed of the composition of the adult medical 
team. Among the actions that patients rated as "important/very important", and 
considered to be a priority in their comments, the most frequently cited were 
the provision of explanatory documents on the TCA (94%), the transmission of the 
medical file from the pediatric sector to the adult sector (94%) and a joint 
consultation with both pediatrician and adult unit physician (91%). Physicians 
were in agreement concerning the primary importance of the last two actions.
CONCLUSION: This study provides a basis for the deployment, on the national 
level, of transition programs which include specific actions that patients view 
as priorities.

BACKGROUND: 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS) is a rare disease with an 
important characteristic-clinical heterogeneity. The diversity of organs, 
regions, and systems of the body that can be affected requires periodic updating 
of health professionals so that they can recognize these clinical signs as 
belonging to 22q11.2DS. Updated professionals are equally important for the 
appropriate and timely clinical management of individuals with a positive 
diagnosis. In this context, this article aimed to map and analyze the access to 
healthcare for individuals with 22q11.2DS until the moment of diagnosis.
RESULTS: We analyzed the clinical data of 111 individuals with 22q11.2DS 
registered in the Brazilian Database on Craniofacial Anomalies (BDCA) from 2008 
to 2020. In this study, individuals were diagnosed at a median age of 9 years 
(mean = 9.7 years). Before the genetic investigation, they accessed 68.75% of 
the internationally recommended evaluations available at BDCA. Recurrent 
22q11.2DS clinical manifestations such as delayed neuropsychomotor development, 
lip and/or palate defects, cardiac malformation and/or 
hematological/immunological alteration co-occurred in at least 72.06% of 
individuals. Cardiac malformation was the only clinical alteration that lowered 
the median diagnostic age, corresponding to 6.5 years of age with a cardiac 
malformation versus 11 years of age without one (p = 0.0006).
CONCLUSIONS: In Brazil, 22q11.2 DS is under-recognized, and early diagnosis and 
management of affected individuals are still a distant reality. In this sense, 
22q11.2 DS suspicion followed by the elimination of obstacles for its diagnosis 
confirmation is essential to increase life expectancy and improve the quality of 
life of these individuals in Brazil.

The incidence of cancer is higher in patients with end-stage kidney disease 
(ESKD) than among the general population. Despite this, screening for cancer is 
generally not cost-effective and may worsen quality of life in these patients. 
This is due to high mortality rates (patients are not living long enough to reap 
the benefits of screening), the inaccuracy of cancer screening tests, and the 
increased risks associated with therapy in patients with ESKD. Specific groups 
of patients with ESKD who have a longer-than-expected life expectancy or 
higher-than-expected cancer risk may benefit from screening. These groups 
include patients on peritoneal dialysis, patients on home hemodialysis, Black 
and Asian-American patients, transplant-eligible patients, and those at higher 
risk of cancer including patients with acquired cystic kidney disease, those who 
have been previously exposed to cytotoxic agents or aristolochic acid, and 
patients with a genetic predisposition to cancer. In this narrative review, we 
will examine the prevalence of and risk factors for cancer in patients with ESKD 
and the effectiveness of cancer screening, and discuss specific situations in 
which cancer screening may be effective.

PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to assess the short- to mid-term 
radiologic, clinical, and functional outcomes of patients treated with combined 
dorsal and volar locking plating for internal fixation of complex, comminuted, 
intra-articular, distal radius fractures.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of 34 patients treated with 
combined dorsal and volar locking plates for the internal fixation of complex, 
comminuted, intra-articular distal radius fractures. Radiographic and clinical 
parameters were recorded at a mean of 48 months after surgery. Activities of 
daily living and quality of life were assessed by the Disabilities of the Arm, 
Shoulder, and Hand and Patient-Rated Wrist Evaluation questionnaires.
RESULTS: Compared with the contralateral wrist, the treated wrist regained 73% 
of flexion, 81% of extension, 86% of ulnar deviation, 90% of radial deviation, 
98% of pronation, 99% of supination, and 93% of grip strength. Mean Disabilities 
of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand and Patient-Rated Wrist Evaluation scores were 11 
(range, 0-78) and 11 (range, 0-77), respectively. Radial height and radial 
inclination were restored anatomically in 24% and 41% of patients, respectively, 
while volar tilt and ulnar variance were restored in 68% of patients.
CONCLUSION: The overall functional and radiologic outcome of patients with 
comminuted intra-articular complex distal radius fractures treated with the 
combined dorsovolar plate osteosynthesis was good to excellent.

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to estimate the cost-effectiveness of remdesivir, 
the first novel therapeutic to receive Emergency Use Authorization for the 
treatment of hospitalized patients with COVID-19, and identify key drivers of 
value to guide future pricing and reimbursement efforts.
METHODS: A Markov model evaluated the cost-effectiveness of remdesivir in 
patients hospitalized with COVID-19 from a US healthcare sector perspective. A 
lifetime time horizon captured potential long-term costs and outcomes. Model 
outcomes included discounted total costs, life-years, and quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs). Remdesivir was modeled as an addition to standard of care 
and compared with standard of care alone, including dexamethasone for patients 
requiring respiratory support. COVID-19 hospitalizations were assumed to be 
reimbursed through a single payment based on the respiratory support received 
alongside a remdesivir carveout payment in the base case. Sensitivity and 
scenario analyses identified key drivers.
RESULTS: At a unit price of $520 per vial and assuming no survival benefit with 
remdesivir, the incremental cost-effectiveness was $298 200/QALY for patients 
with moderate to severe COVID-19 and $1 847 000/QALY for patients with mild 
COVID-19. Although current data do not support a survival benefit, if one was 
assumed, the cost-effectiveness estimate was $50 100/QALY for the moderate to 
severe population and $103 400/QALY for the mild population. Another key driver 
included the hospitalization payment structure (per diem vs bundled payment).
CONCLUSIONS: With the current evidence available, remdesivir's price is too high 
to align with its expected health gains for hospitalized patients with COVID-19. 
Results from this study provide a rationale for iterative health technology 
assessment.

Background The aim of this study is to explore the prevalence and overlap of 
physical, cognitive, psychological, and social frailty and their 
negative-interrelationships. Methods We conducted a survey of people aged ≥75 
years in the region with the oldest population in Japan. Frailty was divided 
into physical, cognitive, psychological, and social frailty, which were 
evaluated with the Japanese version of the Cardiovascular Health Study (J-CHS) 
criteria, J-CHS and the Japanese version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, 
the Geriatric Depression Scale-15 and the Lubben Social Network Scale, 
respectively. Results Of the 268 participants (aged 81.5 ± 4.5 years), 48.1% and 
8.6% had physical prefrailty and frailty; 68.3%, 13.0%, and 5.2% had mild 
cognitive impairment, dementia, and cognitive frailty; 25.7% and 5.2% had 
depressive mood and depression as psychological frailty; and 7.8% had social 
frailty, respectively. Path analysis showed that social frailty was associated 
with psychological frailty. Psychological frailty was associated with physical 
frailty. Physical frailty was associated with cognitive frailty. Multiple 
logistic regression analysis showed that independent determinants of physical 
robustness were female sex, age, and psychological robustness (odds ratio 
(OR) = 2.166, 0.831, 3.625, respectively). Determinants of cognitive robustness 
were age and psychological robustness (OR = 0.837, 7.079). Determinants of 
psychological robustness were physical, cognitive, and social robustness 
(OR = 3.759, 6.829, 5.037), and the determinant of social robustness was 
psychological robustness (OR = 4.489), respectively. Conclusions We demonstrated 
the prevalence, overlap, and interrelationships of different types of frailty 
and clarified the factors that may help to reduce frailty.

Impact of preoperative prognostic nutritional index levels on morbidity in 
colorectal cancer surgery.

Senger AS, Dincer M, Uzun O, Gulmez S, Avan D, Ofluoglu CB, Polat E, Duman M.

AIM: The prognostic nutritional index (PNI) is a valuable parameter that 
indicates the immunonutritional status of patients with malignant tumors.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Patients operated for colorectal cancer between January 
2013 and December 2019 were analyzed retrospectively. The relationship between 
PNI and morbidity was investigated in the 314 patients included in the study. 
Based on previous studies, the PNI cutoff value was set at 45, and the patients 
were duly divided into two groups: PNI <45 and PNI ≥45. The demographic and 
clinicopathological characteristics, as well as postoperative complications in 
the two groups, were compared.
RESULTS: There was no statistical difference in gender, localization, T stage, N 
stage, perineural invasion, lymphovascular invasion, stage, Ca19-9 values, and 
body mass index(BMI) between the two groups. In contrast, there was a 
statistically significant difference in age, complications, and CEA values. 
(p=0.008, p<0.001, p=0.043, respectively). The median age was lower in patients 
with high PNI scores than in the low PNI group (61 vs. 64 years). When the 
patients were examined for complications, 36 (37.1%) patients were observed in 
the high PNI group, compared to 155 (71.4%) in the low PNI group. In terms of 
overall survival, the mean life expectancy was 68.112 2.646 months for patients 
with low PNI group, compared to 84.626 2.701 months in the high-PNI group, and 
the difference was statistically significant (p=0.001).
CONCLUSION: This study's findings suggest that the preoperative prognostic 
nutritional index may indicate postoperative complications and prognosis. The 
most significant benefit of this marker is that it can be improved 
preoperatively and practically.

The conserved ATPase p97 (Cdc48 in yeast) and adaptors mediate diverse cellular 
processes through unfolding polyubiquitinated proteins and extracting them from 
macromolecular assemblies and membranes for disaggregation and degradation. The 
tandem ATPase domains (D1 and D2) of the p97/Cdc48 hexamer form stacked rings. 
p97/Cdc48 can unfold substrates by threading them through the central pore. The 
pore loops critical for substrate unfolding are, however, not well-ordered in 
substrate-free p97/Cdc48 conformations. How p97/Cdc48 organizes its pore loops 
for substrate engagement is unclear. Here we show that p97/Cdc48 can form double 
hexamers (DH) connected through the D2 ring. Cryo-EM structures of p97 DH reveal 
an ATPase-competent conformation with ordered pore loops. The C-terminal 
extension (CTE) links neighboring D2s in each hexamer and expands the central 
pore of the D2 ring. Mutations of Cdc48 CTE abolish substrate unfolding. We 
propose that the p97/Cdc48 DH captures a potentiated state poised for substrate 
engagement.

Metabolic energy consumption has long been thought to play a major role in the 
aging process (Pearl, The rate of living. University of London Press, London, 
1928). Across species, a gram of tissue expends approximately the same amount of 
energy during the lifespan on average (Speakman, J Exp Biol 208:1717-1730, 
2005). Energy restriction has also been shown to increase the maximum lifespan 
(McCay et al. J Nutr 10:63-79, 1935) and to retard age-associated changes 
(Weindruch and Walford, The retardation of aging and disease by dietary 
restriction. CC Thomas, Springfield, 1988). However, there are significant 
exceptions to universal energy consumption during the lifespan, mainly found by 
interclass comparison (Ramsey et al. Free Rad Biol Med 29:946-968, 2000; 
Atanasov, Trakia J Sci 10(3):1-14, 2012). Here, we present a universal relation 
that relates lifespan energy consumption to several physiological variables, 
such as body mass, temperature and the ratio of heart rate to respiratory rate, 
which have been shown to be valid for [Formula: see text] species representing 
different classes of living organisms, from unicellular organisms to the largest 
mammals. This relation has an average scattered pattern restricted to factors of 
2, with 95% ([Formula: see text]) of the organisms having departures of less 
than a factor of [Formula: see text] from the relation, despite the difference 
of [Formula: see text] orders of magnitude in body mass, reducing any possible 
interclass variation in the relation to only a geometrical factor. This result 
can be interpreted as supporting evidence for the existence of an approximately 
constant total number [Formula: see text] of respiration cycles per lifetime for 
all organisms studied, effectively predetermining the extension of life through 
the basic energetics of respiration (quantified by [Formula: see text]); this is 
an incentive to conduct future studies on the relation of such a constant number 
[Formula: see text] of cycles per lifetime due to the production rates of free 
radicals and oxidants or alternative mechanisms, which may yield definite 
constraints on the origin of aging.

It is unknown whether the survival of patients cured of esophageal cancer 
differs from that of the corresponding background population. This nationwide 
and population-based cohort study included all patients who survived for at 
least 5 years after surgery for esophageal cancer in Sweden between 1987 and 
2015, with follow-up throughout 2020. Relative survival rates with 95% 
confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated by dividing the observed with the 
expected survival. The expected survival was assessed from the entire Swedish 
population of the corresponding age, sex, and calendar year. Yearly relative 
survival rates were calculated between 6 and 10 years postoperatively. Among all 
762 participants, the relative survival was initially similar to the background 
population (96.1%, 95% CI 94.3-97.9%), but decreased each following 
postoperative year to 83.5% (95% CI 79.5-87.6%) by year 10. The drop in relative 
survival between 6 and 10 years was more pronounced in participants with a 
history of squamous cell carcinoma [from 94.5% (95% CI 91.2-97.8%) to 70.8% (95% 
CI 64.0-77.6%)] than in those with adenocarcinoma [from 96.9% (95% CI 
94.8-99.0%) to 91.5% (95% CI 86.6-96.3%)], and in men [from 96.0% (95% CI 
93.8-98.1%) to 81.8% (95% CI 76.8-86.8%)] than in women [from 96.4% (95% CI 
93.4-99.5%) to 88.1% (95% CI 81.5-94.8%)]. No major differences were found 
between age groups. In conclusion, esophageal cancer survivors had a decline in 
survival between 6 and 10 years after surgery compared with the corresponding 
general population, particularly those with a history of squamous cell carcinoma 
of the esophagus and male sex.

INTRODUCTION: Cystic fibrosis-related diabetes mellitus (CFRDM) is becoming a 
more common issue in pregnancy care as the life expectancy of females living 
with cystic fibrosis has improved, with an increasing number of pregnancies in 
this population. Despite the Republic of Ireland having the highest incidence of 
cystic fibrosis globally, there is limited Irish data on pregnancy outcomes for 
those with CFRDM. This study aimed to retrospectively review maternal and foetal 
outcomes of pregnancies affected by maternal CFRDM.
METHODS: The patient records of all women with CFRDM who attended the National 
Maternity Hospital Dublin for obstetric care between 2015 and 2019 were 
retrospectively reviewed.
RESULTS: A search of patient records identified 15 pregnancies in 12 women with 
CFRDM during the study period. CFRDM was diagnosed pre-conception in ten of the 
15 pregnancies. Median neonatal weight at birth was lower in women with CFRDM 
diagnosed pre-conception compared to women diagnosed during pregnancy (2.8 vs. 
3.02 kg). The median weight gain in women with CFRDM diagnosed pre-conception 
was 10.9 kg compared to 11.9 kg for those diagnosed during pregnancy. The 
majority of women (62.5%) with CFRDM diagnosed pre-conception delivered via 
caesarean section. Admission for CF exacerbations during pregnancy in women with 
CFRDM diagnosed pre-conception was very common (87.5%) compared with 75% of 
those diagnosed during their pregnancy.
CONCLUSION: Women diagnosed with CFRDM were likely to require caesarean section, 
to be treated with insulin, and to be frequently admitted to hospital for CF 
exacerbations. Our review highlights the importance of good glucose control, 
stable cystic fibrosis before pregnancy and a multidisciplinary team approach.

The development of effective and safe treatments has significantly increased the 
life expectancy of persons with haemophilia (PWH). This has been accompanied by 
an increase in the comorbidities of ageing including cardiovascular disease, 
which poses particular challenges due to the opposing risks of bleeding from 
haemophilia and antithrombotic treatments versus thrombosis. Although mortality 
secondary to coronary artery disease in PWH is less than in the general 
population, the rate of atherosclerosis appears similar. The prevalence of 
atrial fibrillation in PWH and risk of secondary thromboembolic stroke are not 
well established. PWH can be safely supported through acute coronary 
interventions but data on the safety and efficacy of long-term antithrombotics 
are scarce. Increased awareness and research on cardiovascular disease in PWH 
will be crucial to improve primary prevention, acute management, secondary 
prevention and to best support ageing PWH.

BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic disease that impacts 
patients' quality of life, healthcare costs, and life expectancy. Elevated 
sickle hemoglobin (HbS), which readily polymerizes, causes red blood cell 
sickling, leading to chronic hemolytic anemia and complications often requiring 
hospitalization and transfusions. In 2019, voxelotor, which inhibits HbS 
polymerization, was approved for SCD treatment.
OBJECTIVES: This study uses real-world evidence to assess voxelotor's 
effectiveness in SCD patients in typical clinical practice from 2019 to 2021 
using a national medical claims database (N = 3128).
RESULTS: After initiating voxelotor, 60.8% of patients with available hemoglobin 
(Hb) laboratory data (n = 74) showed a Hb increase >1 g/dL. Mean transfusion 
rate per patient-year dropped 52% in patients with ≥1 transfusion before 
treatment (n = 190). In patients with ≥1 of the corresponding events (n = 1065), 
decreases were observed in mean vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC) frequency (-23%); 
mean VOC-related hospitalizations and length of stay (LOS) time (-34% and -30%, 
respectively); mean all-cause hospitalization and LOS time (-37% and -23%, 
respectively); outpatient visits (-10%); iron chelation use (-46%); and 
prescribed opioids (-13%).
CONCLUSION: These data align with randomized controlled trial results showing 
voxelotor improvements and support that voxelotor may lower transfusion and VOC 
rates in clinical practice.

OBJECTIVES: Since the 1980s, life expectancy at birth (e0) in the United States 
has fallen steadily behind that of other high-income countries, widening the 
U.S. e0 disadvantage. We estimate how that disadvantage was affected by high 
mortality rates in 2020, the first full year of the coronavirus disease 2019 
pandemic.
METHODS: We contrast male and female e0 in the United States and 18 peer 
countries for years 1980, 1995, 2010, 2019, and 2020. Using Arriaga 
decomposition, we show how differences in age-specific death rates have 
contributed to U.S. e0 disadvantages.
RESULTS: In 2020, U.S. male and female e0 changed by -2.33 (-2.50, -2.15) and 
-1.69 (-1.85, -1.53) years, respectively, whereas corresponding changes in peer 
countries averaged -0.67 (-0.82, -0.51) and -0.50 (-0.65, -0.35) years, 
respectively. This accelerated a longstanding and widening U.S. e0 disadvantage 
relative to its peers, which increased from 3.49 to 5.15 years in males and from 
2.78 to 3.97 years in females between 2019 and 2020. Whereas deaths before age 
65 accounted for 55% and 40% of declines in U.S. male and female life 
expectancy, respectively, they accounted for only 24% and 11% of the respective 
declines in peer countries.
DISCUSSION: U.S. life expectancy declines in 2020 were larger than in peer 
countries and involved deaths across a broader age range, particularly among 
young and middle-aged adults. Both the longstanding U.S. e0 disadvantage and 
acute losses of life in 2020 signal the need for systemic policy changes in the 
United States.

Neurocognition and the Aging Brain in People With HIV: Implications for 
Screening.

The introduction of effective antiretroviral therapy (ART) has converted HIV 
infection from a lethal disease to a manageable chronic condition for most 
people. The drastic improvement in life expectancy of people with HIV has led to 
an expansion of the aging population of people with HIV globally. Recent 
research indicates that people with HIV on suppressive ART still sustain 
persistent, albeit alleviated, systemic and cerebral immune activation that can 
facilitate age-related causes of cognitive impairment (CI), including 
neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular diseases. Although HIV-associated 
neurocognitive disorder remains prevalent in older people with HIV on 
suppressive ART, the co-occurrence of other age-related causes of CI makes the 
investigation and management of CI more challenging. More importantly, it 
remains unknown if the neuropsychiatric manifestations of HIV-associated 
neurocognitive disorder are modified by the presence of age-related causes of 
CI, such as Alzheimer disease, and vice versa. This article will review findings 
regarding the interaction between HIV-1 infection and age-related comorbidities, 
namely atherosclerosis and neurodegenerative diseases, followed by cognitive 
outcomes of people with HIV in longitudinal studies. Cognitive symptoms of 
people with HIV on stable ART will be discussed. The review will go through the 
latest recommendations for cognitive screening in different HIV management 
guidelines, as well as the usefulness of various screening tools in the setting 
of stable viral suppression.

INTRODUCTION: In patients with pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) or leptin receptor 
(LEPR) deficiency, managing obesity and hyperphagia can be burdensome for 
patients and caretakers. The impacts on health-related quality of life are 
under-recognized and are not well characterized.
METHODS: We conducted in-depth qualitative interviews in patients with POMC 
(n = 3) and LEPR (n = 2) deficiencies participating in an ongoing open-label 
extension of phase 3 clinical trials with the melanocortin receptor 4 agonist 
setmelanotide to describe the patient experience of hyperphagia and characterize 
changes following treatment with setmelanotide.
RESULTS: Prior to setmelanotide treatment, all five patients described abnormal 
sensations of hunger with none indicating feeling satiated after meals and also 
reported that the burden of hyperphagia impacted their families, emotions, and 
work and/or school functioning. Following setmelanotide treatment, all five 
patients reported consistent reductions in hunger and weight, decreased eating, 
and feeling satiated after meals in addition to substantial improvements in each 
area of functioning they had previously reported. All five patients indicated 
they were very satisfied with the impact of setmelanotide on their quality of 
life and would be upset if treatment was discontinued.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with POMC or LEPR deficiency, hyperphagia and the 
inability to feel satiety negatively impacted quality of life. By reducing 
hunger and improving satiety, setmelanotide facilitated important changes in the 
lives of these patients. This qualitative research study suggests that the 
impact of setmelanotide goes beyond favorable clinical changes (e.g., weight and 
hunger) to also include quality of life improvements that are highly meaningful 
to patients.

Cost-effectiveness of antenatal multiple micronutrients and balanced energy 
protein supplementation compared to iron and folic acid supplementation in 
India, Pakistan, Mali, and Tanzania: A dynamic microsimulation study.

BACKGROUND: Malnutrition among women of childbearing age is especially prevalent 
in Asia and sub-Saharan Africa and can be harmful to the fetus during pregnancy. 
In the most recently available Demographic and Health Survey (DHS), 
approximately 10% to 20% of pregnant women in India, Pakistan, Mali, and 
Tanzania were undernourished (body mass index [BMI] <18.5 kg/m2), and according 
to the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2017 study, approximately 20% of babies 
were born with low birth weight (LBW; <2,500 g) in India, Pakistan, and Mali and 
8% in Tanzania. Supplementing pregnant women with micro and macronutrients 
during the antenatal period can improve birth outcomes. Recently, the World 
Health Organization (WHO) recommended antenatal multiple micronutrient 
supplementation (MMS) that includes iron and folic acid (IFA) in the context of 
rigorous research. Additionally, WHO recommends balanced energy protein (BEP) 
for undernourished populations. However, few studies have compared the 
cost-effectiveness of different supplementation regimens. We compared the 
cost-effectiveness of MMS and BEP with IFA to quantify their benefits in 4 
countries with considerable prevalence of maternal undernutrition.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: Using nationally representative estimates from the 2017 
GBD study, we conducted an individual-based dynamic microsimulation of 
population cohorts from birth to 2 years of age in India, Pakistan, Mali, and 
Tanzania. We modeled the effect of maternal nutritional supplementation on 
infant birth weight, stunting and wasting using effect sizes from Cochrane 
systematic reviews and published literature. We used a payer's perspective and 
obtained costs of supplementation per pregnancy from the published literature. 
We compared disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) in a baseline scenario with existing antenatal 
IFA coverage with scenarios where 90% of antenatal care (ANC) attendees receive 
either universal MMS, universal BEP, or MMS + targeted BEP (women with 
prepregnancy BMI <18.5 kg/m2 receive BEP containing MMS while women with BMI 
≥18.5 kg/m2 receive MMS). We obtained 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) for all 
outputs to represent parameter and stochastic uncertainty across 100 iterations 
of model runs. ICERs for all scenarios were lowest in Pakistan and greatest in 
Tanzania, in line with the baseline trend in prevalence of and attributable 
burden to LBW. MMS + targeted BEP averts more DALYs than universal MMS alone 
while remaining cost-effective. ICERs for universal MMS compared to baseline IFA 
were $52 (95% UI: $28 to $78) for Pakistan, $72 (95% UI: $37 to $118) for Mali, 
$70 (95% UI: $43 to $104) for India, and $253 (95% UI: $112 to $481) for 
Tanzania. ICERs for MMS + targeted BEP compared to baseline IFA were $54 (95% 
UI: $32 to $77) for Pakistan, $73 (95% UI: $40 to $104) for Mali, $83 (95% UI: 
$58 to $111) for India, and $245 (95% UI: $127 to $405) for Tanzania. Study 
limitations include generalizing experimental findings from the literature to 
our populations of interest and using population-level input parameters that may 
not reflect the heterogeneity of subpopulations. Additionally, our 
microsimulation fuses multiple sources of data and may be limited by data 
quality and availability.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we observed that MMS + targeted BEP averts more 
DALYs and remains cost-effective compared to universal MMS. As countries 
consider using MMS in alignment with recent WHO guidelines, offering targeted 
BEP is a cost-effective strategy that can be considered concurrently to maximize 
benefits and synergize program implementation.
