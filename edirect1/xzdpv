per 100,000 persons, with an EAPC of 0.29 (0.27-0.32). In 2019, the EAPCs of the 
ASIR and age-standardized DALY rate of hip osteoarthritis were positively 
associated with the SDI of hip osteoarthritis. In 1990 and 2019, the incidence 
of hip osteoarthritis was unimodally distributed across different age groups, 
with a peak incidence in the 60-64-year-old age group, whereas the DALYs 
increased with age.
CONCLUSIONS: The incidence and DALYs of hip osteoarthritis have been increasing 
globally. The EAPCs of the ASIR and age-standardized DALY rate were particularly 
significant in developed regions and varied across nations and regions, 
indicating the urgent need for governments and medical institutions to increase 
the awareness regarding risk factors, consequences of hip osteoarthritis.

Transposition of the great arteries is one of the most common cyanotic 
congenital heart diseases. It is characterised by an abnormal connection of the 
ventricles and great arteries, so that the aorta arises from the morphological 
right ventricle and the pulmonary artery arises from the morphological left 
ventricle. Historically, as with many congenital heart diseases, patients with 
transposition of the great arteries had poor life expectancy. Advances in 
surgical and medical management have resulted in patients surviving into 
adulthood. As these patients are living longer, they will be encountered more 
frequently in practice. The purpose of this article is to familiarise the 
general radiologist with the expected postoperative anatomy, and the appearance 
on cross-sectional imaging as well as the long-term complications in this group 
of patients.

Therapeutic advances in hereditary amyloid transthyretin (ATTRv) amyloidosis 
with polyneuropathy extended life expectancy and delayed symptom progression 
especially in patients with early disease. Thus, detection and monitoring of 
asymptomatic carriers gained importance. However, there is still limited 
consensus on genetic screening of ATTRv-polyneuropathy patients' family members 
and diagnostic tests that must be done in the follow-up. In this study, we 
followed prospectively five asymptomatic carriers of a family with ATTRV30M 
(p.Val50Met) mutation by different diagnostic tests for three years. The 
carriers were followed by neurological examination, nerve conduction studies, 
sympathetic skin response test, heart rate variability, SFN-SIQ and DN4 
questionnaires, quantitative sensory testing (QST), skin biopsy and in vivo 
corneal confocal microscopy. Nerve conduction studies, sympathetic skin response 
test and heart rate variability were normal in all for three years. Baseline QST 
and SFN-SIQ were normal but became abnormal during follow-up of two individuals 
who developed small fiber neuropathy symptoms. Baseline intraepidermal nerve 
fiber density was low in three carriers and decreased to below normative values 
in all during follow-up, while corneal sub-basal nerve density was low in all 
carriers compared to controls during the entire follow-up. Thus, our study 
showed that SFN-SIQ and QST are useful diagnostic tools to detect the transition 
to symptomatic ATTRv-polyneuropathy.

The aging population has had an impact on society in recent decades. 
Aging-associated health issues are a particularly challenging aspect to 
regulate. Therefore, the extension of healthy life expectancy by the application 
of biologically active compounds is an attractive research topic in the fields 
of medicinal chemistry, chemical biology, and also organic synthesis. Herein, 
the first total synthesis of acaulide, acaulone A and 10-keto-acaudiol A is 
described. These compounds were originally isolated from a culture of Acaulium 
sp. H-JQSF. Acaulide exhibits anti-osteoporosis activity in a 
prednisolone-induced osteoporotic zebrafish model; hence, this natural product 
is expected to be a new lead compound for anti-osteoporosis drugs. The 
characteristic acaulide skeletons were synthesized via late-stage Michael 
addition inspired by the proposed biosynthetic pathways. The conformational 
analysis of the 14-membered macrodiolide revealed the specific conformation that 
enabled the late-stage stereoselective functionalization.

PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to use the finite element method (FEM) to 
reproduce fracture lines that reach the lateral tibial plateau during open-wedge 
high tibial osteotomy (OWHTO) in patients with Type III lateral hinge fracture 
(LHF). It was hypothesized that the FEM could clarify biomechanical causes of 
Type III LHF, enabling prevention of adverse complications.
METHODS: This study used the nonlinear FEM to analyze the data of eight knees in 
eight patients (two males and six females) with Type III LHF among 82 patients 
who underwent OWHTO, as well as the data of eight individuals with no LHF. To 
predict the onset of Type III LHF, simulation models were also developed in 
which posterior osteotomy sufficiency varied from 50% to perfect, the latter 
defined as osteotomy reaching the hinge point.
RESULTS: Real-life instances of Type III LHF caused by insufficient posterior 
osteotomy were reproduced in all patient-specific FEM models, and these models 
accurately predicted fracture types and locations. During opening of the 
osteotomy gap, the fracture line reached the lateral tibial plateau, and 
extended vertically from the end of the insufficient posterior osteotomy, 
avoiding the rigid proximal tibiofibular joint. In contrast, sufficient 
posterior osteotomy resulted in a lack of LHF. Posterior osteotomy 
extension ≥ 70% of the width of the osteotomy plane was the cut-off value to 
prevent Type III LHF.
CONCLUSION: Forced opening of insufficient posterior osteotomy was found to be a 
biomechanical cause of Type III LHF that extended perpendicularly to the lateral 
tibial plateau, avoiding the proximal tibiofibular joint. The clinical 
significance of this study is that sufficient posterior osteotomy during OWHTO, 
defined as at least 70% of the width of the osteotomy plane, can prevent Type 
III LHF.

The escalation of life expectancy is accompanied by an increase in the 
prevalence of age-related conditions, such as sarcopenia. Sarcopenia, a muscle 
condition defined by low muscle strength, muscle quality or quantity, and 
physical performance, has a high prevalence among the elderly and is associated 
to increased mortality. The neuromuscular system has been emerging as a key 
contributor to sarcopenia pathogenesis. Indeed, the age-related degeneration of 
the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) function and structure may contribute to the 
loss of muscle strength and ultimately to the loss of muscle mass that 
characterize sarcopenia. The present mini-review discusses important signaling 
pathways involved in the function and maintenance of the NMJ, giving emphasis to 
the ones that might contribute to sarcopenia pathogenesis. Some conceivable 
biomarkers, such as C-terminal agrin fragment (CAF) and brain-derived 
neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and therapeutic targets, namely acetylcholine and 
calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), can be retrieved, making way to future 
studies to validate their clinical use.

BACKGROUND: The lack of morphological differentiation among chiropteran species 
and cryptic speciation impedes species identification. DNA-based approaches help 
species identification and contribute to the discovery of additional species. 
Rhyneptesicus nasutus (Sind Serotine Bat) is a rare and poorly studied species 
in Pakistan.
METHODS: This study explores the range extension of Sind Bat within the 
territorial limits of Pakistan from Sind and Baluchistan to Federally 
Administered Areas of Pakistan. No molecular record exists for the species in 
Pakistan. In the present study, we for the first time confirm species 
identification of Rhyneptesicus nasutus from Pakistan using a genetic marker 
(cytochrome b) along with morphometric analysis. A neighbor-joining tree based 
on Kimura-2 parameters was created to infer phylogenetic relationships. We 
sequenced the cytochrome b gene segment and conducted a phylogenetic analysis 
with previously published data from other countries.
RESULTS: Sequences from Pakistan formed a clade with Iranian Rhyneptesicus 
nasutus specimens suggesting a common ancestry. Various morphometric parameters 
(mean values) were measured, including Head and Body length (44.3 mm), Tail 
length (43.4 mm), Hindfoot length (8.3 mm), Forearm length (35.7 mm), and Ear 
length 36 mm while 5th Metacarpal Length, 4th Metacarpal Length, and 3rd 
Metacarpal Lengths were 33.2 mm, 34.7 mm, and 35.3 mm. Approaches based on DNA 
barcoding reveal a high diversity of bat species in the study area.
CONCLUSION: The data will enable researchers to build an improved evolutionary 
framework of the Serotine Bats from this region and subsequently reconstruct a 
detailed evolutionary history of the genus. Further research is required to test 
other molecular markers to support the findings of the current study in 
Pakistan.

Though the level of public and private health expenditure per capita in 
Southeast Asia is comparatively below the level of health expenditure in 
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries, the 
former has higher rates of under-five and non-communicable disease mortality 
rates than the latter. Similarly, life expectancy at birth is considerably 
higher in OECD compared to Southeast Asia, despite the global progress in recent 
decades. This study examines the dynamics of public and private health 
expenditure on health outcomes in Southeast Asia, vis-a-vis two of the 
Sustainable Development Goals targets. The techniques of fixed effect, random 
effect and feasible generalised least squares methods are used to obtain robust 
estimates. Furthermore, the analysis dives deep into the analysis of 
country-specific impacts of public and private health expenditure on health 
outcomes using the technique of seemingly unrelated regression. Estimates show 
that, across Southeast Asia, public health expenditure alone contributes to 
improving life expectancy at birth, lower level of under-five and 
non-communicable disease mortality rates. Unlike public health expenditure, 
private health expenditure contributes to better health outcomes only in 
Brunei and Singapore but not across the countries of Southeast Asia. The 
implications of the findings and possible future research areas are highlighted 
further.

Tailored tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia 
(CML) based on current evidence.

Philadelphia (Ph*)/BCR-ABL1-positive chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a 
neoplastic hematologic disorder, which is a functionally curable chronic disease 
via using tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) drugs. The life expectancy for the 
vast majority of chronic phase-CML patients is "normal", thanks to the unique 
effectiveness of the ABL-targeted TKIs of CML. The patients with CML receiving 
TKI could be expected to have a survival and 'quality of life' of the age- and 
sex-matched healthy people. Several TKI pathways may be selected for the first 
line CML treatment, including first-generation original/generic imatinib or 
second-generation TKIs, such as bosutinib, nilotinib, and dasatinib. Individual 
characteristics of the CML patients, TKI drug compliance, lifestyle preferences, 
comorbidities, distinct toxicity profile of the TKI drug, and physician-clinical 
center experience are among the critical factors to be taken into account while 
deciding on the proper first line TKI in the newly diagnosed CML patients. 
Identifying CML patients at a higher risk for the disease progression or TKI 
resistance is essential and could influence the choice of primary TKI. The 
optimized integrations of the best available evidence, individual patient 
characteristics, and physician clinical experience are required in order to 
select best TKI for the CML management. Pathobiological basis depending upon the 
prospective in vivo research data is also crucial during the follow-up as well.

CONTEXT: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a group of rare neurological 
diseases which cause progressive loss of upper and lower motor neurons at the 
spinal or bulbar level. ALS affects voluntary muscles of the body which control 
eating, talking, and moving. Individuals with ALS manifest difficulty breathing 
on their own due to weakness of the respiratory system. The average life 
expectancy of individuals with ALS is 2-5 years from the time of diagnosis, with 
death resulting from respiratory failure. There is no cure for ALS. At present, 
riluzole and edaravone are the only FDA-approved treatments that impact 
survival. Adverse reactions to edaravone include hypoxia and respiratory 
failure. To date, there are no published reports describing isolated dramatic 
respiratory improvement in ALS with continued global clinical worsening 
including limb and face function, particularly following edaravone use.
FINDINGS: We present a case report of late stage bulbar ALS, in which a dramatic 
respiratory improvement is seen following edaravone use, and subsequent 
cessation.
CONCLUSION/CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Isolated pulmonary decline and subsequent 
recovery following cessation of edaravone in the setting of continued systemic 
neurologic decline has not yet been described and may suggest potential for 
reversibility of edaravone-related pulmonary decline. Research is needed to 
evaluate this possibility further, and this case report may lead to further 
investigation to evaluate this possibility. Alternatively, although less likely, 
it is possible the observed that pulmonary improvement may either be 
beneficially attributed to edaravone, or unrelated to edaravone entirely - 
representing an undescribed phenomenon of isolated pulmonary decline and 
improvement in the setting of systemic continued ALS progression, possibly 
related to the bulbar subtype. Further investigation is warranted to evaluate 
both the role of edaravone in causing in a potentially reversible pulmonary 
decline upon cessation of the medication, and the possibility of other undefined 
variables including various subtypes of ALS contributing to this phenomenon.

BACKGROUND: With increasing interest in cost optimization, costs of adult spinal 
deformity (ASD) surgery intersections with frailty merit investigation.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate costs associated with ASD and frailty.
METHODS: Patients with ASD (scoliosis ≥20°, sagittal vertical axis [SVA] ≥5 cm, 
pelvic tilt ≥ 25°, or thoracic kyphosis ≥ 60°) with baseline and 2-yr 
radiographic data were included. Patients were severely frail (SF), frail (F), 
or not frail (NF). Utility data were converted from Oswestry Disability Index to 
Short-Form Six-Dimension. Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) used 3% rate for 
decline to life expectancy. Costs were calculated using PearlDiver. Loss of work 
costs were based on SRS-22rQ9 and US Bureau of Labor Statistics. Accounting for 
complications, length of stay, revisions, and death, cost per QALY at 2 yr and 
life expectancy were calculated.
RESULTS: Five hundred ninety-two patients with ASD were included (59.8 ± 14.0 
yr, 80% F, body mass index: 27.7 ± 6.0 kg/m2, Adult Spinal Deformity-Frailty 
Index: 3.3 ± 1.6, and Charlson Comorbidity Index: 1.8 ± 1.7). The average blood 
loss was 1569.3 mL, and the operative time was 376.6 min, with 63% undergoing 
osteotomy and 54% decompression. 69.3% had a posterior-only approach, 30% 
combined, and 0.7% anterior-only. 4.7% were SF, 22.3% F, and 73.0% NF. At 
baseline, 104 were unemployed losing $971.38 weekly. After 1 yr, 62 remained 
unemployed losing $50 508.64 yearly. With propensity score matching for baseline 
SVA, cost of ASD surgery at 2 yr for F/SF was greater than that for NF ($81 347 
vs $69 722). Cost per QALY was higher for F/SF at 2 yr than that for NF 
($436 473 vs $430 437). At life expectancy, cost per QALY differences became 
comparable ($58 965 vs $58 149).
CONCLUSION: Despite greater initial cost, F and SF patients show greater 
improvement. Cost per QALY for NF and F patients becomes similar at life 
expectancy.

BACKGROUND: Life expectancy in people with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has 
increased but remains shorter than in people without IBD. We describe the life 
expectancy associated with IBD therapies among the growing number of older 
adults living with IBD.
METHODS: Older adults (≥ 65 years) with IBD were identified from 
population-based health administrative data using a validated algorithm. Life 
expectancy on patients' 65th birthday, stratified by sex, was calculated using a 
period life table approach from age- and sex-specific mortality rates among 
patients receiving immunomodulator monotherapy, biologic monotherapy, 
combination therapy, mesalamine, systemic steroids, and no therapy.
RESULTS: Among 28,260 older adults with IBD (239,125 person-years of follow-up), 
life expectancy at 65 years was longest for patients taking mesalamine (females: 
22.1 years, 95% CI 21.8-22.5; males: 19.6 years, 95% CI 19.3-20.0) and shortest 
for patients taking steroids (females: 11.7 years, 95% CI 11.0-12.4; males 
10.3 years, 95% CI 9.7-10.8). Life expectancy was similar for patients receiving 
immunomodulator monotherapy and biologic monotherapy. Immunomodulator 
monotherapy was associated with a reduction in life expectancy compared to 
combination therapy by 5.1 (95% CI 2.3-7.8) in females and 2.8 years (95% CI 
0.1-5.5) in males.
CONCLUSIONS: Life expectancy varies across therapies used for IBD, with 
differences likely arising from a combination of medication effectiveness, 
safety profiles, disease severity, and comorbid conditions. These considerations 
should be balanced when deciding on a therapeutic approach for the management of 
IBD in older adults.

BACKGROUND: Over the past few decades, economic, political, and social changes 
have directly and indirectly affected the health of the Mongolian population. To 
date, no comprehensive analysis has been conducted on the burden of diseases in 
this country. Thus, we aimed to describe the leading causes of death and 
disabling conditions and their trends between 1990 and 2019 in the Mongolian 
population.
METHODS: We used the data from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2019 study. In 
the current study, we examined life expectancy at birth, healthy life 
expectancy, the 20 leading causes of death, years of life lost (YLLs), years 
lived with disability (YLDs), disability-adjusted-life-years (DALYs), and the 
contribution of major risk factors to DALYs in Mongolia.
FINDINGS: The life expectancy at birth in Mongolia has gradually increased since 
1995 and reached 63.8 years for men and 72.7 for women in 2019. The highest 
increase in the age-standardised death rate between 1990 and 2019 occurred in 
alcohol use disorders (628.6%; 95% UI 10.0-1109.6) among men, and in liver 
cancer (129.1%; UI 65.3-222.4) among women. Ischaemic heart disease and stroke 
showed the highest rates of death, YLLs, and DALYs among both men and women. In 
2019, the highest age-standardised rates of DALYs were attributable to high 
systolic blood pressure and dietary risks.
INTERPRETATION: Although Mongolia saw substantial improvements across many 
communicable diseases, maternal and neonatal disorders, and under-5 mortality 
between 1990 and 2019, non-communicable diseases remained leading causes of 
mortality. The mortality from the most preventable causes such as injury, 
alcohol use, and dietary risks remain substantially high, suggesting that 
individual and social efforts are needed to tackle these diseases. Our analyses 
will support the development of policy priorities and action plans in multiple 
sectors to improve the overall health of the Mongolian population.

BACKGROUND: Current measures to monitor population health include indicators of 
(i) average length-of-life (life expectancy), (ii) average length-of-life spent 
in good health (health expectancy), and (iii) variability in length-of-life 
(lifespan inequality). What is lacking is an indicator measuring the extent to 
which healthy lifespans are unequally distributed across individuals (the 
so-called 'healthy lifespan inequality' indicators).
METHODS: We combine information on age-specific survival with the prevalence of 
functional limitation or disability in Spain (2014-2017) by sex and level of 
education to estimate age-at-disability onset distributions. Age-, sex- and 
education-specific prevalence rates of adult individuals' daily activities 
limitations were based on the GALI index derived from Spanish National Health 
Surveys held in 2014 and 2017. We measured inequality using the Gini index.
RESULTS: In contemporary Spain, education differences in health expectancy are 
substantial and greatly exceed differences in life expectancy. The female 
advantage in life expectancy disappears when considering health expectancy 
indicators, both overall and across education groups. The highly educated 
exhibit lower levels of lifespan inequality, and lifespan inequality is 
systematically higher among men. Our new healthy lifespan inequality indicators 
suggest that the variability in the ages at which physical daily activity 
limitations start are substantially larger than the variability in the ages at 
which individuals die. Healthy lifespan inequality tends to decrease with 
increasing educational attainment, both for women and for men. The variability 
in ages at which physical limitations start is slightly higher for women than 
for men.
CONCLUSIONS: The suggested indicators uncover new layers of health inequality 
that are not traceable with currently existing approaches. Low-educated 
individuals tend to not only die earlier and spend a shorter portion of their 
lives in good health than their highly educated counterparts, but also face 
greater variation in the eventual time of death and in the age at which they 
cease enjoying good health-a multiple burden of inequality that should be taken 
into consideration when evaluating the performance of public health systems and 
in the elaboration of realistic working-life extension plans and the design of 
equitable pension reforms.

The increased life expectancy of individuals with Down syndrome (DS) is 
associated with increased prevalence of trisomy 21-linked early-onset 
Alzheimer's disease (EOAD) and dementia. The aims of this study of 14 brain 
regions including the entorhinal cortex, hippocampus, basal ganglia, and 
cerebellum in 33 adults with DS 26-72 years of age were to identify the 
magnitude of brain region-specific developmental neuronal deficits contributing 
to intellectual deficits, to apply this baseline to identification of the 
topography and magnitude of neurodegeneration and neuronal and volume losses 
caused by EOAD, and to establish age-based staging of the pattern of genetically 
driven neuropathology in DS. Both DS subject age and stage of dementia, 
themselves very strongly correlated, were strong predictors of an AD-associated 
decrease of the number of neurons, considered a major contributor to dementia. 
The DS cohort was subclassified by age as pre-AD stage, with 26-41-year-old 
subjects with a full spectrum of developmental deficit but with very limited 
incipient AD pathology, and 43-49, 51-59, and 61-72-year-old groups with 
predominant prevalence of mild, moderately severe, and severe dementia 
respectively. This multiregional study revealed a 28.1% developmental neuronal 
deficit in DS subjects 26-41 years of age and 11.9% AD-associated neuronal loss 
in DS subjects 43-49 years of age; a 28.0% maximum neuronal loss at 51-59 years 
of age; and a 11.0% minimum neuronal loss at 61-72 years of age. A total 
developmental neuronal deficit of 40.8 million neurons and AD-associated 
neuronal loss of 41.6 million neurons reflect a comparable magnitude of 
developmental neuronal deficit contributing to intellectual deficits, and 
AD-associated neuronal loss contributing to dementia. This highly predictable 
pattern of pathology indicates that successful treatment of DS subjects in the 
fourth decade of life may prevent AD pathology and functional decline.

INTRODUCTION: Stroke rehabilitation guidelines suggest a high-frequency 
task-oriented training at high intensity. A targeted and self-paced daily 
training with intermittent supervision is recommended to improve patients' 
self-management and functional output. So far, there is conflicting evidence 
concerning the most effective home-training delivery method.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The purpose of this pilot study is to compare the 
feasibility and preliminary effects of task-oriented home-exercises in patients 
in the subacute stage after stroke. Twenty-four patients will be randomised 
(1:1) to a Video group (a) or Paper group (b) of an individualised, 
task-oriented home-training (50 min, 6×/week, for 4 weeks) based on Wulf and 
Lewthwaite's Optimizing Performance Through Intrinsic Motivation and Attention 
for Learning theory of motor learning. Patient-relevant goals will be identified 
using Goal Attainment Scaling and exercises progressively adapted. 
Semistructured interviews and a logbook will be used to monitor adherence, arm 
use and acceptability. Primary outcome will be the feasibility of the methods 
and a full-scale trial employing predefined feasibility criteria (recruitment, 
retention and adherence rates, patients' satisfaction with the home-exercise 
programme and their progress, affected hand use and acceptance of the 
intervention). Assessed at baseline, post intervention and 4-week follow-up, 
secondary outcomes include self-perceived hand and arm use, actual upper 
extremity function and dexterity, hand strength, independence in activities of 
daily living and health-related quality of life. Interview data will be analysed 
using qualitative content analysis. Medians (ranges) will be reported for 
ordinal data, means (SD) for continuous and frequency (percentage) for nominal 
data.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study follows the Standard Protocol Items: 
Recommendations for Interventional Trials-Patient-Reported Outcome (PRO) 
Extension guideline. Ethical approval was received from the Ethics Committee of 
the Medical University of Innsbruck, Austria (1304/2020). Written informed 
consent will be obtained from all participants prior to data collection. Study 
results will be disseminated to participating patients, patient organisations, 
via the clinic's homepage, relevant conferences and peer-reviewed journals.

Anemia is frequently diagnosed in elderly patients, and it is a key indicator of 
many reactive and clonal conditions. Furthermore, the older age is the most 
common presenting age for myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Anemia in older age 
may be attributed to an inflammatory state due to senescence, comorbidities, 
nutritional deficiencies, or primary bone marrow conditions. As diagnostic 
possibilities and life expectancy increase, the prevalence of anemia of the 
elderly increases as well. The etiology has a direct impact on the treatment and 
quality of life of these patients, in whom is a usual clinical challenge as it 
may be due to a multifactorial origin. In a minority group, when no etiology is 
identified, it is classified as unexplained anemia (UA) or clonal cytopenia of 
unknown significance (CCUS). The underlying cause of anemia remains unexplained 
in 30% of cases, and a great part of unexplained cytopenia may account for 
myeloid neoplasms. Anemia in the elderly is associated with worse cognitive and 
functional outcomes and increased mortality.

With increasing life expectancy in people with Cystic fibrosis (CF), the focus 
of clinical care has shifted to management and prevention of non-pulmonary 
comorbidities. CF related bone disease, defined by low bone mineral density 
(BMD), is prevalent across all age groups and acknowledges the increased 
fractures rates that negatively impact lung function and quality of life. Dual 
energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) measurement of bone mineral content (BMC) and 
"areal" BMD (aBMD) is recommended for identifying and monitoring bone health in 
children and adults due to its low cost, low radiation exposure, and widespread 
availability. Recent studies in children and adolescents with chronic illness 
focus on adjustment of BMC and aBMD measurements for height due to the effects 
of short stature and delayed maturation on bone size. Expanded reference 
databases for alternate imaging sites such as the ultradistal radius and hip 
present opportunities for research and long-term monitoring. As the 
two-dimensional nature of DXA imposes limitations, we highlight other imaging 
modalities including peripheral quantitative computed tomography QCT (pQCT), 
magnetic resonance imaging, and quantitative ultrasound (QUS). These tools, 
while primarily used in a research setting, can impart information on true 
volumetric bone density and bone microarchitecture as well as contribute to 
fracture assessment and prediction. Due to the high morbidity and mortality 
associated with vertebral and hip fracture, we will present on vertebral 
fracture assessment (VFA) in both children and adults as well as applied 
analyses including hip structural analysis (HSA), trabecular bone score (TBS), 
and fracture risk assessment (FRAX) for high risk groups. Questions remain on 
the future clinical applicability and accessibility of these assessment and 
prediction tools, longitudinal monitoring through adolescence and adulthood, and 
how outcome measures may guide bone modifying therapies.

Although the physical health status of the Russian population has improved over 
time, limited attention has been paid to the role of subjective well-being 
(SWB), and even less is known about its relationship with objective health 
conditions. Using the concept of health expectancy, this study estimates the 
number of years expected to be satisfied with life (happy life expectancy [LE]) 
for Russian men and women aged 50 years and older between 1994 and 2015. Data on 
age-specific prevalence rates of life satisfaction were obtained from the 
Russian Longitudinal Study of Higher School of Economics (RLMS-HSE), and the 
life tables were from the Human Life Table Database. We also tested the 
correlation between macroeconomic indicators and happy LE at age 50. Results 
based on the Sullivan method demonstrated substantial increases in happy LE at 
age 50 for both genders during the study period. Changes in happy LE and the 
percentage of happy life were significant for both genders. Furthermore, happy 
LE fluctuated during the 1990s but increased in the early 2000s. Importantly, 
the results from more recent years show stagnation and slight declines in happy 
LE for men and women. We also noted correlations between happy LE at age 50 and 
macroeconomic indicators, including gross domestic product (GDP), inflation, 
unemployment, and poverty rates. Taken together, the findings suggest that 
Russian men and women are becoming more satisfied with life as they live longer. 
While health has mainly been measured by mortality and morbidity in the Russian 
context, the finding suggests the importance of focusing more on the positive 
aspect of population health.

Lactic acid bacteria produce various bioactive compounds widely used in human 
healthcare. However, studies on cryoprotective agents for the efficient storage 
of lactic acid bacteria after freeze-drying are still lacking. Here, we report 
the shelf-life extension effects of a highly efficient and eco-friendly 
cryoprotective agent and a cold adaptation method on Lactobacillus sakei 
WiKim31. Cold adaptation of L. sakei WiKim31 increased exopolysaccharide 
expression in response to abiotic stress. As a possible cryoprotective agent, 
the citrus byproduct (CP) contains a variety of sugars, amino acids, and 
cations, exhibiting high antioxidant activity. L. sakei WiKim31 powders 
formulated with CP or a mixture of soy powder (SP) and CP exhibited high cell 
viability at 58.3 and 76.3%, respectively, after 56 days of storage. These 
results indicate that CP can be efficiently used as a novel cryoprotective agent 
either alone or in combination with SP to improve the storage conditions of L. 
sakei WiKim31 and preserve it longer.
