PURPOSE: To estimate the incremental cost-effective-ness of amblyopia screening 
at preschool and kindergarten, the costs and benefits of three amblyopia 
screening scenarios were compared to no screening and to each other: (1) 
acuity/stereopsis (A/S) screening at kindergarten, (2) A/S screening at 
preschool and kindergarten, and (3) photoscreening at preschool and A/S 
screening at kindergarten.
METHODS: A probabilistic microsimulation model of amblyopia natural history and 
response to treatment with screening costs and outcomes estimated from two state 
programs was programmed. The probability was calculated that no screening and 
each of the three interventions were most cost-effective per incremental 
quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained and case avoided.
RESULTS: Assuming a minimal 0.01 utility loss from monocular vision loss, no 
screening was most cost-effective with a willingness to pay (WTP) of less than 
$16,000 per QALY gained. A/S screening at kindergarten alone was most 
cost-effective at a WTP between $17,000 and $21,000. A/S screening at preschool 
and kindergarten was most cost-effective at a WTP between $22,000 and $75,000, 
and photoscreening at preschool and A/S screening at kindergarten was most 
cost-effective at a WTP greater than $75,000. Cost-effectiveness substantially 
improved when assuming a greater utility loss. All scenarios were cost-effective 
when assuming a WTP of $10,500 per case of amblyopia cured.
CONCLUSION: All three screening interventions evaluated are likely to be 
considered cost-effective relative to many other potential public health 
programs. The choice of screening option depends on budgetary resources and the 
value placed on monocular vision loss prevention by funding agencies.

Indigenous mental health 2035: future takers, future makers and transformational 
potential.

OBJECTIVE: The aims were to review progress in Indigenous mental health over the 
past 25 years and to identify possible directions for the next 25 years.
METHOD: Māori involvement in health and health care was used to illustrate key 
Indigenous developments since 1984. Challenges in the decades ahead were 
discussed in the context of demographic transitions, life course epidemiology, 
global trends, technological innovations and health leadership.
RESULTS: Progress was measured by a range of indicators including 
Māori-referenced life expectancy, Māori agendas for health, strengthened 
cultural identity, the dissemination of health knowledge, and Māori 
participation in the health sector. In contrast to being ready to respond to 
change (future takers), active planning for the future (future makers) was seen 
as a better way of achieving Indigenous aspirations. One option for health 
advancement currently being developed in New Zealand involved an integrated 
approach premised on intersectoral delivery and a focus on families.
CONCLUSIONS: Indigenous health will be advanced by dedicated approaches to 
family wellbeing that avoid fragmentation, focus on positive strengths, and lead 
to positive outcomes for family members and the family as a whole.

Should we have any doubts about hypertension therapy in elderly patients?: 
ACCF/AHA 2011 expert consensus document on hypertension in the elderly.

University of Lodz, Poland. maciejbanach@aol.co.uk

Hypertension therapy in elderly patients still constitutes a considerable 
challenge. Its importance is also emphasized by the fact that, nowadays, many 
international organizations focus on the problem of an aging society (in 2030, 
life expectancy at birth in the European Union 27 is expected to rise to 85.3 
years for women and 80.0 years for men). They discuss not only the optimal 
therapy in elderly patients, the problem of compliance and polypragmasy, but 
also the quality of life as well as the social, economic, and psychological 
challenges associated with this patient group. However, neither the available 
trials nor the European Society of Hypertension guidelines (2009) finally 
answered all important questions on hypertension management in elderly people. 
Thus, the first official recommendations on hypertension therapy in this patient 
group were much expected. The American College of Cardiology Foundation/American 
Heart Association 2011 Expert Consensus Document on Hypertension in the Elderly 
was published on April 25, 2011. The present article summarizes the most 
important issues discussed in this document.

Cytoreductive surgery is accepted as a major treatment of primary ovarian 
cancer. The role in recurrent ovarian cancer remains a field of discussion and 
controversy, mainly owing to missing data from prospective randomized trials and 
lack of universal definitions. Retrospective data indicate that complete 
resection of recurrent tumor formations should be aimed for, since survival 
prolongation is mainly seen for patients with no residual disease. Thus, it is 
most important to find predictors of complete resection, on the one hand to 
offer the best therapeutic chances to patients, but on the other hand to protect 
patients with limited life expectancy from additional surgical burden. The first 
prospective surgical trial in recurrent ovarian cancer, AGO-DESKTOP II validated 
a score ('AGO score') for complete resection. It was shown that patients with a 
good general condition (ECOG 0), no residual disease after surgery for primary 
ovarian cancer and absence of ascites in presurgical diagnostics have a 76% 
likelihood of undergoing complete resection. In this article, further recent 
data regarding surgery for recurrent ovarian cancer are going to be discussed 
and the advantages of incorporating these patients into randomized trials are 
highlighted.

The SmokingPaST Framework: illustrating the impact of quit attempts, quit 
methods, and new smokers on smoking prevalence, years of life saved, medical 
costs saved, programming costs, cost effectiveness, and return on investment.

O'Donnell MP(1), Roizen MF.

Author information:
(1)American Journal of Health Promotion, Bratenahl, Ohio, USA.

PURPOSE: Describe the specifications of the Smoking Prevalence, Savings, and 
Treatment (SmokingPaST) Framework and show how it can illustrate the impact of 
quit attempts, quit method, number of new smokers, smoking rates of immigrants 
and emigrants, and death rates of smokers and nonsmokers on future smoking 
prevalence rates, program costs, years of life saved, medical costs saved, cost 
effectiveness of programs, and return on investment (ROI). FRAMEWORK 
SPECIFICATIONS: Mathematical relationships among factors in SmokingPaST are 
described. Input variables include baseline smoking rates among current adults, 
new adults, immigrants, and emigrants; population counts for these groups; 
annual quit attempts; and distribution of quit methods. Assumption variables 
include success rate by quit method, death rates of smokers and nonsmokers, 
annual medical costs of smoking, costs per person for four tobacco treatment 
methods, age distribution of quitters, and distribution of medical cost funding 
by source. Output variables include year-end adult smoking rates, successful 
quitters, years of life saved by quitting, medical costs saved by quitting and 
by not hiring smokers, total costs of smoking treatment programs, cost per 
quitter, cost per life-year saved, distribution of medical cost savings from 
quitting, and ROI of treatment costs.
APPLICATIONS: The Framework was applied at the employer, county, state, and 
national levels.
CONCLUSIONS: The SmokingPaST Framework provides a conceptually simple framework 
that can be applied to any population. It illustrates that significant drops in 
smoking rates can be achieved and significant savings in medical costs can be 
captured by employers as well as state and federal governments through tobacco 
treatment and prevention programs. Savings are especially important for reducing 
state and federal government deficits and enhancing job competitiveness.

[Uncertainty of long term preservation of digital documents and how to cope with 
it].

[Article in French]

The development of digital technologies in all activities sectors of our society 
leads to a growing number of digital documents. A significant part of these 
documents needs to be durably preserved. This long term preservation has to face 
the short life expectancy of the technologies and the digital storage media. 
Large national organizations have already take this problem into account and set 
up teams, skills and means to face this challenge. At the opposite, the small 
structures, doctor's offices, individuals, students, etc. are not generally 
aware of the problem or are stripped to face there. A certain number of simple 
actions, not requiring specific skills in data processing can nevertheless be 
undertaken. Without important expenditure, they increase to a significant 
degree, the security level of the documents over the long term.

BACKGROUND: The most common acute infections occur in the respiratory tract. 
Recent discoveries of several novel viruses have markedly increased the 
repertoire of agents understood to cause presentations of acute respiratory 
disease.
OBJECTIVES: Further understanding is needed of the relative importance of newly 
discovered pathogens in the clinical setting to provide clinicians with an 
indication of appropriate diagnostic and therapeutic targets. To address this, 
quantification of the disease burden of respiratory viruses in hospitalized 
patients was undertaken.
STUDY DESIGN: Disease burden caused by respiratory viruses in hospitalized 
patients was quantified using the World Health Organization endorsed DALY model. 
Diagnostic testing results from samples collected over three years for 
adenovirus (AdV), influenzas A and B, parainfluenza viruses 1, 2 and 3 (PIV-1, 
-2 and -3), respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV), and previously published 
retrospective screening for human metapneumovirus, rhinoviruses, and four 
respiratory coronaviruses were applied to the DALY model. Disability weights 
were calculated per 1000 hospitalized patients in age banded groups.
RESULTS: Strikingly different disease burden profiles were observed in children 
and adults. Adenoviruses were among the leading cause of respiratory 
presentations in children but not adults. HRSV and influenza A were consistently 
one of the greatest causes of disease regardless of sampled population. 
Rhinoviruses and PIV-3 were significant pathogens in all groups except those 
aged 16-64 years. In immunocompromised patients rhinoviruses were the leading 
viral cause of disease.
CONCLUSIONS: These analyses provide a framework which can be used to identify 
where finite resources should be directed in respiratory therapeutics and 
vaccine development.

Welfare state regimes, infant mortality and life expectancy: integrating 
evidence from East Asia.

Chuang YC(1), Chuang KY, Chen YR, Shi BW, Yang TH.

Author information:
(1)School of Public Health, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.

BACKGROUND: This longitudinal study builds on the cross-sectional work of Karim 
et al and examines the influence of welfare state regime on population health 
with a particular focus on East Asian welfare states (eg, Hong Kong, Japan, 
Korea, Singapore and Taiwan).
METHODS: Data were extracted from the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and 
Development Data Set, World Development Indicators and Asian Development Bank's 
key indicators from 1980 to 2006. Infant mortalities and life expectancy were 
used as health-outcome varables. Thirty-one countries were categorised into six 
types of welfare regimes: Scandinavian, Anglo-Saxon, Bismarckian, Southern, 
Eastern European and East Asian. Mixed models were applied to analyse the data 
with repeated measurements.
RESULTS: In keeping with Karim et al, Scandinavian and Eastern European welfare 
states have lower and higher infant mortalities respectively compared with East 
Asian welfare states. Eastern European welfare states had a lower life 
expectancy than East Asian welfare states. Most welfare states had a higher 
social, health and education expenditure, and higher densities of physicians 
than East Asian welfare states.
CONCLUSION: East Asian welfare states did not have worse health than most 
welfare states. Future studies should continue to incorporate East Asian 
countries in the typology of welfare regimes that include more social, economic, 
political and healthcare system characteristic variables to provide insight on 
the mechanism by which welfare-state regimes influence population health.

[Perimenarchial growth spurt of the bone].

[Article in Japanese]

Namba N(1), Ozono K.

Author information:

Japan.

Peak bone mass negatively predicts the lifetime cumulative incidence of 
osteoporosis and fractures. Osteoporosis is a highly prevalent disease and 
fractures at an advanced age worsen life expectancy. It is therefore important 
to prevent progression of this disease. However, curbing the loss of already 
osteoporotic bone is not an easy task. Adolescence is a critical period for bone 
acquisition. Maximizing peak bone mass during puberty will ultimately guard 
against osteoporosis. In this review, we focus on the hormonal effects of 
puberty on bone growth and the importance of appropriate exercise and nutrition 
to optimize bone accrual.

Liver disease in cystic fibrosis.

Rowland M(1), Bourke B.

Author information:

Dublin, Ireland. marion.rowland@ucd.ie

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review looks at what is currently known about liver 
disease in cystic fibrosis (CF) in light of the literature over the past year, 
and what the ongoing challenges are from a clinical and research perspective for 
the optimal management of cystic fibrosis liver disease (CFLD).
RECENT FINDINGS: Patients with CF who develop clinically significant liver 
disease have a worse overall phenotype, and whereas there is no definite 
evidence that they have a shorter life expectancy, longer follow-up is required 
to determine if liver disease is a risk factor for mortality in CF.The 
development of the ferret and pig animal models of CF with multiorgan 
involvement is an important breakthrough which will enhance our understanding of 
the pathogenesis of CFLD, and with which it is hoped novel therapeutic targets 
for the treatment of CFLD will be identified.
SUMMARY: Whereas there is still no effective treatment for liver disease in CF, 
recent developments of animal models of CFLD will enhance our capacity to 
develop new therapeutic targets and reduce the impact of liver disease on 
mortality in CF.

The moth Lobesia botrana (Denis & Schiffermüller) (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) 
feeds on grapes (Vitis vinifera L.), reducing yield and increasing 
susceptibility to fungal infections. L. botrana is among the most economically 
important insects in Europe and has recently been found in vineyards in Chile, 
Argentina, and California. Here, we review L. botrana biology and behavior in 
relation to its larval host (the grapevine) and its natural enemies. We also 
discuss current and future control strategies in light of our knowledge of 
chemical ecology, with an emphasis on the use of the sex pheromone-based 
strategies as an environmentally safe management approach. Pheromone-mediated 
mating disruption is the most promising technique available on grapes and is 
currently implemented on approximately 140,000 ha in Europe. Experience from 
several growing areas confirms the importance of collaboration between research, 
extension, growers, and pheromone-supply companies for the successful 
implementation of the mating disruption technique. In the vineyards where mating 
disruption has been successfully applied as an areawide strategy, the reduction 
in insecticide use has improved the quality of life for growers, consumers, as 
well as the public living near wine-growing areas and has thereby reduced the 
conflict between agricultural and urban communities.

(NSSI), Zürich, Switzerland.

The recent proliferation of standards and labels for organic, fair-trade, 
locally produced, and healthy food products risks creating confusion among 
consumers. This study presents a standardized approach to developing a 
comprehensive sustainability label that incorporates ecological, economic, and 
social values. The methodology is based on an extension of modular life-cycle 
assessment to non-environmental sustainability criteria. Interviews with a wide 
range of experts (n=65) and a consumer survey (n=233) were conducted to analyze 
the feasibility and potential effectiveness of the approach. Responses indicated 
that a comprehensive sustainability label could considerably influence 
consumption patterns and facilitate cross-product comparisons.

Cost-effectiveness of oral bisphosphonates for osteoporosis at different ages 
and levels of life expectancy.

Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina 27705, USA.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of oral bisphosphonate therapy 
for osteoporosis in women at different ages and life expectancies.
DESIGN: A Markov model was used to analyze oral bisphosphonate treatment for 5 
years compared to no intervention. Women at each age were divided into life 
expectancy quartiles: the lowest 1% to 25% (sickest group), the two middle 26% 
to 75% (average health group), and the highest 76% to 100% of life expectancy 
(healthiest group). Simulations were performed for hypothetical cohorts at 
5-year intervals with starting ages between 50 and 90 and for each life 
expectancy group and followed for up to 100 years or until death. Data sources 
included published fracture rates, costs, utility values, and mortality risks.
SETTING: Computer simulation using a societal perspective.
PARTICIPANTS: Hypothetical cohort of women with various life expectancies 
beginning osteoporosis treatment between the age of 50 and 90 years.
MEASUREMENTS: Cost per quality-adjusted life years (QALY) gained for 5 years of 
bisphosphonate therapy compared to no treatment. Cost-effectiveness was defined 
at a willingness-to-pay of $50,000.
RESULTS: In the healthiest group, all costs were less than $18,000 per QALY. In 
the median quartiles of life expectancy, lifetime costs per QALY were less than 
$27,000 for patients at all ages; treatment became cost-saving at a starting age 
of 75 and remained so through a starting age of 85. Even in the sickest group, 
although osteoporosis treatment was not cost-saving, it remained cost-effective 
through a starting age of 90 with lifetime costs of less than $43,000 per QALY.
CONCLUSION: Treatment with an oral bisphosphonate for 5 years was cost-effective 
for all women, regardless of quartile of life expectancy. Advanced age should 
not prevent consideration of osteoporosis treatment based on cost effectiveness, 
and strategies to improve care, such as nurse-led screening programs or 
electronic medical record tools, are needed.

AIM: To investigate the cost-effectiveness of liraglutide as add-on to metformin 
vs. glimepiride or sitagliptin in patients with Type 2 diabetes uncontrolled 
with first-line metformin.
METHODS: Data were sourced from a clinical trial comparing liraglutide vs. 
glimepiride, both in combination with metformin, and a clinical trial comparing 
liraglutide vs. sitagliptin, both as add-on to metformin. Only the subgroup of 
patients in whom liraglutide was added to metformin monotherapy was included in 
the cost-utility analysis. The CORE Diabetes Model was used to simulate outcomes 
and costs with liraglutide 1.2 and 1.8 mg vs. glimepiride and vs. sitagliptin 
over patients' lifetimes. Treatment effects were taken directly from the trials. 
Costs and outcomes were discounted at 3.5% per annum and costs were accounted 
from a third-party payer (UK National Health System) perspective.
RESULTS: Treatment with liraglutide 1.2 and 1.8 mg resulted, respectively, in 
mean increases in quality-adjusted life expectancy of 0.32 ± 0.15 and 0.28 ± 
0.14 quality-adjusted life years vs. glimepiride, and 0.19 ± 0.15 and 0.31 ± 
0.15 quality-adjusted life years vs. sitagliptin, and was associated with higher 
costs of £ 3003 ± £ 678 and £ 4688 ± £ 639 vs. glimepiride, and £ 1842 ± £ 751 
and £ 3224 ± £ 683 vs. sitagliptin, over a patient's lifetime. Both liraglutide 
doses were cost-effective, with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of £ 9449 
and £ 16,501 per quality-adjusted life year gained vs. glimepiride, and £ 9851 
and £ 10,465 per quality-adjusted life year gained vs. sitagliptin, 
respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Liraglutide, added to metformin monotherapy, is a cost-effective 
option for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes in a UK setting.

New anticoagulants for the prevention of stroke in atrial fibrillation.

Höchtl T(1), Huber K.

Author information:
(1)3rd Medical Department with Cardiology and Emergency Medicine, Wilhelminen 
Hospital, Montleartstraße 37, Vienna, Austria.

Oral anticoagulation in atrial fibrillation is obligatory to lower the risk of 
spontaneous cerebrovascular and systemic thromboembolism. For this purpose, 
vitamin K antagonists (coumarins) have been recommended as the most effective 
drugs for a long time. However, problems with the practical use of these agents, 
e.g. the need for frequent and regular coagulation controls, the 
inter-individual differences in maintaining a stable therapeutic range, as well 
as drug or food interactions, have led to the search and investigation of 
alternative compounds characterized by a more simple use (e.g. without regular 
controls of therapeutic levels), high efficacy, as well as low risk of bleeding. 
The direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran and the direct factor Xa inhibitors 
rivaroxaban and apixaban have recently been investigated to prove whether they 
fulfill the high expectancy of an ideal anticoagulant with respect to a more 
favorable efficacy/safety profile and without the need for coagulation controls, 
thereby improving quality of life. Dabigatran (RE-LY) achieved an impressive 
reduction in stroke and non-central nervous system (non-CNS) embolism (110 mg: 
1.5%/year; 150 mg: 1.1%/year) in contrast to warfarin (1.7%/year; P = 0.34 and 
P < 0.001) with a favorable action on bleeding hazards. The results of 
rivaroxaban which were obtained in the ROCKET AF study (on treatment analysis: 
stroke and non-CNS embolism: 1.7%/year vs. 2.15%/year with warfarin; P = 0.015; 
primary safety endpoint major and minor bleeding: 14.91 vs. 14.52%; P = 0.442) 
point in the same direction. And finally, compared to aspirin, apixaban reduced 
the combined primary efficacy endpoint by 52% with comparable rates of bleeding 
(AVERROES). This review gives a summary of the current knowledge about these 
agents and their potential future importance.

BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to explore impairment in quality of life 
(QOL) of the mothers who were primarily responsible for taking care of children 
with obstetrical brachial plexus palsy (OBPP) and to state its association with 
the age, sex and functional status of the child with OBPP.
METHODS: Ninety-three mothers of children with OBPP and 88 mothers of children 
without any health problems were included in the study. Children's demographic 
characteristics were recorded and the functional status of the upper extremity 
was determined with the active movement scale. The QOL of the mothers was 
assessed with the Turkish version of the Nottingham Health Profile (NHP).
RESULTS: There were significant differences between mothers of children with 
OBPP and the control group in total, physical activity, energy expenditure, and 
pain score of the NHP. A decrease in energy expenditure and physical activity 
levels were found to be related to children's active movement scale results in 
elbow flexion and extension, and forearm supination. A statistically meaningful 
difference was found between mothers of children aged 0-2 and mothers of 
children aged 2-7 years in emotional reaction, social isolation and total score 
of NHP.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study revealed that mothers of children with 
OBPP have poor QOL compared with mothers of healthy children. The limitation in 
elbow joint movements was found to be important for the mothers. The strongest 
impact of the illness is on the emotional reactions and social isolation of the 
mothers. Professionals involved in the care of children with OBPP should also 
help parents to cope with the burden of caregiving.

Detailed analysis revealed fundamental differences between bacterial association 
with cucumber (Cucumis sativus) seeds and seedlings roots. Seed colonization by 
bacteria seems to result from passive encounter between bacteria, conveyed by 
imbibed soil solution, and the germinating seed. In accordance, the 
seed-associated bacterial community composition directly reflected that of the 
germination medium and was characterized by low dominance. Transition from seed 
to root was marked by a shift in bacterial community composition and in an 
increase in dominance values. Furthermore, settlement of bacteria on roots was 
tightly controlled by the specific properties of each root segment. Size and 
richness of the seed-associated bacterial community were clearly determinate by 
the community in the germination medium. In contrast, for fully developed and 
active roots, the medium effect on these parameters was negligible. Perturbation 
of the seed environment by a pathogen (Pythium aphanidermatum) had major 
consequences on the seed bacterial community. However, those were mostly related 
to direct pathogen-bacteria rather than seed-bacteria interactions. In 
conclusion, simple, even passive processes may determine the initial stage of 
plant-microbe association during seed germination, prior to extension of the 
primary root. Therefore, seed germination is a unique phase in the plant life 
cycle, with respect to its interaction with the below-ground microbiome.

lost.

USA.

OBJECTIVE: To estimate the average loss in life expectancy (LE) due to bladder 
cancer (BC) in men and women in the USA.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Cancer records for 51,528 patients diagnosed with BC 
during 1988-1997 were obtained from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End 
Results database. Potential follow-up ranged from 10 to 20 years (median 14 
years). Loss in median LE at BC diagnosis was computed as the difference between 
expected median survival and observed median survival. Expected survival was 
calculated using two methods: method 1 used age, sex, and race-specific LE in 
the general population, method 2 used the hazard of death from non-BC causes in 
patients with BC (to account for past exposures and treatment-related toxicities 
not present in the general population).
RESULTS: During the study period, BC death occurred in 17% of men and 23% of 
women and non-BC death occurred in 53% of men and 47% of women. Using LE in the 
general population as the reference (method 1), loss in median LE at BC 
diagnosis was 3.9 years for men (33% of their potential remaining years of life) 
and 6.5 years for women (47% of their potential remaining years of life). Using 
non-BC-specific hazard as the reference (method 2), loss in median LE was 2.7 
years for men (26% of their potential remaining years of life) and 4.1 years for 
women (36% of their potential remaining years of life).
CONCLUSION: Compared with men, women loose more years of life and a greater 
fraction of their life expectancy to BC.

Polyandry and the decrease of a selfish genetic element in a wild house mouse 
population.

Studies, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland. andri.manser@ieu.uzh.ch

Despite deleterious effects on individuals, the t haplotype is a selfish genetic 
element present in many house mouse populations. By distorting the transmission 
ratio, +/t males transmit the t haplotype to up to 90% of their offspring. 
However, t/t individuals perish in utero. Theoretical models based on these 
properties predict a much higher t frequency than observed, leading to the t 
paradox. Here, we use empirical field data and theoretical approaches to 
investigate whether polyandry is a female counterstrategy against the negative 
fitness consequences of such distorters. We found a significant decrease of the 
t frequency over a period of 5.5 years that cannot be explained by the effect of 
transmission ratio distortion and recessive lethals, despite significantly 
higher life expectancy of +/t females compared to +/+ females. We quantified 
life-history data and homozygous and heterozygous fitness effects. Population 
subdivision and inbreeding were excluded as evolutionary forces influencing the 
t system. The possible influence of polyandry on the t system was then 
investigated by applying a stochastic model to this situation. Simulations show 
that polyandry can explain the observed t dynamics, making it a biologically 
plausible explanation for low t frequencies in natural populations in general.

University, School of Nursing, Richmond, VA 23298–0567, USA. delyon@vcu.edu

PURPOSE: To examine phenotypic considerations in the study of fatigue and to 
explore significant issues affecting the extension of biobehavioral research of 
fatigue by the inclusion of genetic and genomic markers. THEORETICAL 
ORGANIZATION: Fatigue is a condition that has an adverse effect on quality of 
life that has been a focus of nursing inquiry. Yet, the study of fatigue has 
been stymied by the lack of phenotypic clarity. To expand the biobehavioral 
inquiry of fatigue, phenotypic clarity is needed. In addition, examining genomic 
factors associated with fatigue may help to elucidate the pathophysiology of 
fatigue and, in the future, lead to targeted interventions that address the 
molecular basis of fatigue.
CONCLUSIONS: Given that nursing has been at the forefront of the study of 
fatigue, nurse scientists should consider enhancing phenotypic clarity by the 
development of a case-definition and use of a core measure of fatigue, one that 
can be augmented by condition- or population-specific measures as needed. 
Following the establishment of phenotypic clarity, the integration of genomics 
into biobehavioral research offers an opportunity for further clarity of 
phenotypes and for theoretical specification of the pathophysiology of 
conditions such as fatigue.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The development of targeted interventions for fatigue depend 
on a more precise definition of fatigue and a better understanding of the 
biologic processes that contribute to its development and persistence.

INTRODUCTION: An association between HIV infection and chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease (COPD) has been observed in several studies.
OBJECTIVE AND METHODS: we conducted a review of the literature linking HIV 
infection to COPD, focusing on clinical and epidemiological data published 
before and during widespread highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART).
RESULTS: Interactions between HIV infection and COPD appear to be influenced by 
multiple factors. In particular, the bronchopulmonary tract can be damaged by 
HIV infection, the immunodeficiency it induces, and the resulting increase in 
the risk of pulmonary infections. In addition, the prevalence of smoking and 
intravenous drug use is higher in HIV-infected populations, also increasing the 
risk of COPD. Before the advent of HAART, respiratory tract infections probably 
played a major role. Since the late 1990s and the widespread use of HAART, the 
frequency of opportunistic infections has fallen but new complications have 
emerged as life expectancy has increased.
CONCLUSION: given the high prevalence of smoking among HIV-infected patients, 
COPD may contribute significantly to morbidity and mortality in this setting.

Cell rearrangements shape organs and organisms using molecular pathways and 
cellular processes that are still poorly understood. Here we investigate the 
role of the Actin cytoskeleton in the formation of the Drosophila compound eye, 
which requires extensive remodeling and coordination between different cell 
types. We show that CYFIP/Sra-1, a member of the WAVE/SCAR complex and regulator 
of Actin remodeling, controls specific aspects of eye architecture: rhabdomere 
extension, rhabdomere terminal web organization, adherens junctions, retina 
depth and basement membrane integrity. We demonstrate that some phenotypes 
manifest independently, due to defects in different cell types. Mutations in 
WAVE/SCAR and in ARP2/3 complex subunits but not in WASP, another major 
regulator of Actin nucleation, phenocopy CYFIP defects. Thus, the 
CYFIP-SCAR-ARP2/3 pathway orchestrates specific tissue remodeling processes.

Caloric restriction (CR) extends the life span of organisms ranging from yeast 
to primates. Here, we show that the thiol-dependent peroxiredoxin Tsa1 and its 
partner sulfiredoxin, Srx1, are required for CR to extend the replicative life 
span of yeast cells. Tsa1 becomes hyperoxidized/inactive during aging, and CR 
mitigates such oxidation by elevating the levels of Srx1, which is required to 
reduce/reactivate hyperoxidized Tsa1. CR, by lowering cAMP-PKA activity, 
enhances Gcn2-dependent SRX1 translation, resulting in increased resistance to 
H(2)O(2) and life span extension. Moreover, an extra copy of the SRX1 gene is 
sufficient to extend the life span of cells grown in high glucose concentrations 
by 20% in a Tsa1-dependent and Sir2-independent manner. The data demonstrate 
that Tsa1 is required to ensure yeast longevity and that CR extends yeast life 
span, in part, by counteracting age-induced hyperoxidation of this 
peroxiredoxin.

Over the past 50 years, Japan has successfully developed and maintained an 
increasingly equitable system of universal health coverage in addition to 
achieving the world's highest life expectancy and one of the lowest infant 
mortality rates. Against this backdrop, Japan is potentially in a position to 
become a leading advocate for and supporter of global health. Nevertheless, 
Japan's engagement with global health has not been outstanding relative to its 
substantial potential, in part because of government fragmentation, a weak civil 
society, and lack of transparency and assessment. Japan's development assistance 
for health, from both governmental and non-governmental sectors, has remained 
low and Japanese global health leadership has been weak. New challenges arising 
from changes in governance and global and domestic health needs, including the 
recent Great East Japan Earthquake, now provide Japan with an opportunity to 
review past approaches to health policy and develop a new strategy for 
addressing global and national health. The fragmented functioning of the 
government with regards to global health policy needs to be reconfigured and 
should be accompanied by further financial commitment to global health 
priorities, innovative non-governmental sector initiatives, increased research 
capacity, and investments in good leadership development as witnessed at the G8 
Hokkaido Toyako Summit. Should this strategy development and commitment be 
achieved, Japan has the potential to make substantial contributions to the 
health of the world as many countries move toward universal coverage and as 
Japan itself faces the challenge of maintaining its own health system.

Japan's health indices such as life expectancy at birth are among the best in 
the world. However, at 8·5% the proportion of gross domestic product spent on 
health is 20th among Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development 
countries in 2008 and half as much as that in the USA. Costs have been contained 
by the nationally uniform fee schedule, in which the global revision rate is set 
first and item-by-item revisions are then made. Although the structural and 
process dimensions of quality seem to be poor, the characteristics of the 
health-care system are primarily attributable to how physicians and hospitals 
have developed in the country, and not to the cost-containment policy. However, 
outcomes such as postsurgical mortality rates are as good as those reported for 
other developed countries. Japan's basic policy has been a combination of tight 
control of the conditions of payment, but a laissez-faire approach to how 
services are delivered; this combination has led to a scarcity of professional 
governance and accountability. In view of the structural problems facing the 
health-care system, the balance should be shifted towards increased freedom of 
payment conditions by simplification of reimbursement rules, but tightened 
control of service delivery by strengthening of regional health planning, both 
of which should be supported through public monitoring of providers' 
performance. Japan's experience of good health and low cost suggests that the 
priority in health policy should initially be improvement of access and 
prevention of impoverishment from health care, after which efficiency and 
quality of services should then be pursued.

Japan's population is ageing rapidly because of long life expectancy and a low 
birth rate, while traditional supports for elderly people are eroding. In 
response, the Japanese Government initiated mandatory public long-term care 
insurance (LTCI) in 2000, to help older people to lead more independent lives 
and to relieve the burdens of family carers. LTCI operates on social insurance 
principles, with benefits provided irrespective of income or family situation; 
it is unusually generous in terms of both coverage and benefits. Only services 
are provided, not cash allowances, and recipients can choose their services and 
providers. Analysis of national survey data before and after the programme 
started shows increased use of formal care at lower cost to households, with 
mixed results for the wellbeing of carers. Challenges to the success of the 
system include dissatisfaction with home-based care, provision of necessary 
support for family carers, and fiscal sustainability. Japan's strategy for 
long-term care could offer lessons for other nations.
