The formation of the olfactory nerve and olfactory bulb (OB) glomeruli begins 
embryonically in mice. However, the development of the olfactory system 
continues throughout life with the addition of new olfactory sensory neurons 
(OSNs) in the olfactory epithelium (OE). Much attention has been given to the 
perinatal innervation of the OB by OSN axons, but in the young adult the process 
of OSN maturation and axon targeting to the OB remains controversial. To address 
this gap in understanding, we used BrdU to label late-born OSNs in young adult 
mice at postnatal day 25 (P25-born OSNs) and timed their molecular maturation 
following basal cell division. We show that OSNs in young adults undergo a 
sequential molecular development with the expression of GAP 43 
(growth-associated protein 43) > AC3 (adenylyl cyclase 3) > OMP (olfactory 
marker protein), consecutively, in a time frame of ∼8 d. To assess OSN axon 
development, we implemented an in vivo fate-mapping strategy to label P25-born 
OSNs with ZsGreen. Using sampling intervals of 24 h, we demonstrate the 
progressive extension of OSN axons in the OE, through the foramen of the 
cribriform plate, and onto the surface of the OB. OSN axons reached the OB and 
began to target and robustly innervate specific glomeruli ∼10 d following basal 
cell division, a time point at which OMP expression becomes evident. Our data 
demonstrate a sequential process of correlated axon extension and molecular 
maturation that is similar to that seen in the neonate, but on a slightly longer 
timescale and with regional differences in the OE.

Aging is consistently reported as the most important independent risk factor for 
neurodegenerative diseases. As life expectancy has significantly increased 
during the last decades, neurodegenerative diseases became one of the most 
critical public health problem in our society. The most investigated 
neurodegenerative diseases during aging are Alzheimer disease (AD), 
Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD) and Parkinson disease (PD). The search for 
biomarkers has been focused so far on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood. 
Recently, exosomes emerged as novel biological source with increasing interest 
for age-related neurodegenerative disease biomarkers. Exosomes are tiny 
Extracellular vesicles (EVs; 30-100 nm in size) released by all cell types which 
originate from the endosomal compartment. They constitute important vesicles for 
the release and transfer of multiple (signaling, toxic, and regulatory) 
molecules among cells. Initially considered with merely waste disposal function, 
instead exosomes have been recently recognized as fundamental mediators of 
intercellular communication. They can move from the site of release by diffusion 
and be retrieved in several body fluids, where they may dynamically reflect 
pathological changes of cells present in inaccessible sites such as the brain. 
Multiple evidence has implicated exosomes in age-associated neurodegenerative 
processes, which lead to cognitive impairment in later life. Critically, 
consolidated evidence indicates that pathological protein aggregates, including 
Aβ, tau, and α-synuclein are released from brain cells in association with 
exosomes. Importantly, exosomes act as vehicles between cells not only of 
proteins but also of nucleic acids [DNA, mRNA transcripts, miRNA, and non-coding 
RNAs (ncRNAs)] thus potentially influencing gene expression in target cells. In 
this framework, exosomes could contribute to elucidate the molecular mechanisms 
underneath neurodegenerative diseases and could represent a promising source of 
biomarkers. Despite the involvement of exosomes in age-associated 
neurodegeneration, the study of exosomes and their genetic cargo in 
physiological aging and in neurodegenerative diseases is still in its infancy. 
Here, we review, the current knowledge on protein and ncRNAs cargo of exosomes 
in normal aging and in age-related neurodegenerative diseases.

As life expectancy increases, there is a marked increase in the elderly 
population eager to continue driving. A large proportion of these elderly drive 
safely, however, patients with mild dementia are high-risk drivers.
OBJECTIVE: to identify the cognitive tests that best predict driving ability in 
subjects with mild dementia.
METHODS: 28 drivers with mild dementia and 28 healthy elderly subjects underwent 
an extensive cognitive assessment (NACC Uniform Data Set Neuropsychological 
Battery), completed an adapted On Road Driving Test (ORDT) and a Driving 
Simulator assessment.
RESULTS: drivers with mild dementia made more mistakes on the ORDT and had 
slower responses in the simulator tasks. Cognitive tests correlated strongly 
with on road and simulator driving performance. Age, the Digit Symbol Modalities 
Test and Boston Naming Test scores were the variables that best predicted 
performance on the ORDT and were included in a logistic regression model.
CONCLUSION: the strong correlation between driving performance and performance 
on specific cognitive tests supports the importance of cognitive assessment as a 
useful tool for deciding whether patients with mild dementia can drive safely. 
The algorithm including these three variables could be used as a screening tool 
for the detection of unsafe driving in elderly subjects with cognitive decline.

Publisher: À medida que aumenta a expectativa de vida, há um crescimento notável 
da população idosa ansiosa por continuar dirigindo. Uma grande proporção deles 
dirige com segurança, mas, pacientes com demência leve são condutores de alto 
risco.
OBJETIVO: identificar os testes cognitivos que melhor predizem a capacidade de 
dirigir em indivíduos com demência leve.
MÉTODOS: 28 motoristas com demência leve e 28 idosos saudáveis foram submetidos 
a uma extensa avaliação cognitiva (Bateria Neuropsicológica de Conjunto de Dados 
Uniformes NACC), completaram um teste de condução real adaptado (TCRA) e uma 
avaliação do Simulador de Condução.
RESULTADOS: motoristas com demência leve cometeram mais erros no TCRA e tiveram 
respostas mais lentas nas tarefas do simulador. Os testes cognitivos 
correlacionaram-se fortemente com a condução na estrada e no simulador. A idade, 
o Teste de Modalidades do Símbolo Digit e o Teste de Nomeação de Boston foram as 
variáveis que melhor predisseram o desempenho no ORDT e foram incluídos em um 
modelo de regressão logística.
CONCLUSÃO: a forte correlação entre o desempenho na direção e os testes 
cognitivos específicos apoia a importância da avaliação cognitiva como uma 
ferramenta útil para decidir se os pacientes com demência leve podem dirigir com 
segurança. O algoritmo que inclui essas três variáveis poderia ser usado como 
uma ferramenta de triagem para a detecção de condução de risco em idosos com 
declínio cognitivo.

Distal arthrogryposis (DA) is a heterogeneous sub-group of arthrogryposis 
multiplex congenita (AMC), mostly characterized by having congenital 
contractures affecting hands, wrists, feet, and ankles. Distal arthrogryposis is 
mostly autosomal dominantly inherited, while only one sub-type DA type 5D is 
inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Clinically, DA5D is described having 
knee extension contractures, micrognathia, distal joint contractures, clubfoot, 
ptosis, contractures (shoulders, elbows, and wrists), and scoliosis. Using whole 
exome sequencing (WES) followed by Sanger sequencing, we report on a first 
familial case of DA5D from Pakistani population having a novel biallelic 
missense mutation (c.158C>A, p.Pro53Leu) in the ECEL1 gene. Our result support 
that homozygous mutations in ECEL1 causes DA5D and expands the clinical and 
allelic spectrum of ECEL1 related contracture syndromes.

The phenotypic heterogeneity in a large population arises because of fluctuation 
in microenvironments and stochastic gene expressions. In this report, we 
isolated two types of persistent sub-populations of Vibrio cholerae, one 
triggered by starvation and another by antibiotics. We characterised 
starvation-induced (E-cells) and antibiotic-induced (P-cell) persister cells for 
stress tolerance, colony morphology and toxin gene expressions. Both the 
sub-populations differ with respect to morphology, temperature tolerance and 
oxidative stress tolerance. The E-cells were smaller than the P-cells and formed 
tiny colonies (1-2 mm). The E-cells were more sensitive to heat and oxidative 
stress compared with P-cells. The up-regulated genes of P-cells include, genes 
of antioxidant enzymes (>5 fold), cholera toxin (>26 fold) and toxin: antitoxin 
protein hipA (>100 fold). Upon nutrient up-shift, the E-cells recovered after 
lag time of 6 h. However, such lag extension was not visible during P-cell 
recovery, suggesting that P-cell physiology is more akin to normal cells than 
E-cells. This is the first comparative report on the two different persister 
sub-populations of V. cholerae. The E-cells and P-cells are similar regarding 
antibiotic tolerance. However, the sub-populations differ significantly in 
stress tolerance and other phenotypes studied.

Decision tree and Markov models have been the most commonly used modeling 
methods in health economic evaluations. Both methods are known for their 
limitations. Discrete-event simulation (DES), an event-driven model in 
continuous time at the patient level, is a relatively new method in health 
economic evaluations that addresses some limitations of the common modeling 
techniques. Specifically, with the advent of personalized medicine, conventional 
methods for value assessment that are based on population-level measures might 
not be appropriate. The best treatment would depend on patient characteristics 
and clinical profiles. Value assessment of health interventions can vary 
substantially and may lead to different health decision making due to patient 
heterogeneity. As such, modeling at the patient level is an appropriate approach 
for value assessment of health interventions. The DES model has several 
advantages, such as flexibility, ability to reflect patient heterogeneity, 
increased precision, and better characterization of modeling uncertainty, that 
may be preferred to decision tree and Markov models. In addition, with 
increasing health care spending and drug prices, it is important to quantify 
value of available treatment options for women with postmenopausal osteoporosis 
(PMO). The purpose of this Viewpoints article was to describe and demonstrate an 
application of a DES model to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the current 
treatment guidelines for women with PMO. In particular, the DES model indicated 
that the optimal treatment at the common willingness-to-pay thresholds between 
$100,000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) and $150,000 per QALY was 
denosumab. Analysis of patient heterogeneity in terms of low, medium, high, and 
very high risk of fractures resulted in a similar conclusion. DISCLOSURES:

BACKGROUND: Disease-free survival (DFS) in early-stage human epidermal growth 
factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer is significantly greater with 
the addition of neratinib after adjuvant trastuzumab versus no additional 
therapy. However, it remains uncertain whether these survival gains represent 
good value for the money, given the substantial cost of neratinib.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate clinical and economic implications of adding neratinib 
after adjuvant trastuzumab based on results from the phase III ExteNET trial.
METHODS: A 3-state Markov model was developed to estimate the cost-effectiveness 
of neratinib for women with early-stage (I-III) HER2-positive breast cancer. 
Five-year recurrence rates were derived from the ExteNET trial. Mortality and 
recurrence rates after 5 years were derived from the HERceptin Adjuvant (HERA) 
trial. Outcomes included life-years, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and 
direct medical expenditures. The analysis was performed from a payer perspective 
over a lifetime horizon. One-way sensitivity and probabilistic analyses were 
conducted to evaluate uncertainty.
RESULTS: Total cost of neratinib following adjuvant trastuzumab was $317,619 
versus $152,812 for adjuvant trastuzumab alone. A gain of 0.4 QALYs (15.7 vs. 
15.3) and 0.1 years of projected life expectancy (18.3 vs. 18.2) favored 
neratinib after trastuzumab versus trastuzumab alone. The neratinib cost per 
QALY gained was $416,106. At standard willingness-to-pay thresholds of $50,000, 
$100,000, and $200,000 per QALY gained, neratinib has a probability of 2.8%, 
16.7%, and 33.9% of cost-effectiveness, respectively. The cost per QALY gained 
in a scenario analysis only including patients with hormone-receptor positive 
disease was $275,311.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on 5-year data from ExteNET, neratinib following adjuvant 
trastuzumab is not projected to be cost-effective, even among those patients 
shown to derive the greatest clinical benefit. Future analyses should reassess 
the cost-effectiveness associated with neratinib treatment as trial data mature.

534. Triple Conventional Synthetic Disease-Modifying Anti-Rheumatic Drugs for the
 Management of Rheumatoid Arthritis: A Review of Cost-Effectiveness [Internet].

CADTH Rapid Response Reports.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an inflammatory, chronic disease of the joint that 
is characterized by activation of autoantibodies against immunoglobulin G and 
anticitrullinated protein antibodies. Activated immune cells cause synovial 
accumulation that leads to cartilage and bone erosion. The prevalence of RA in 
urban Quebec between 1992 and 2008 was estimated to be as high as 995 per 
100,000 females aged 45 years and older and 994 per 100,000 males in the same 
age group. The prevalence was estimated to be 205 per 100,000 females younger 
than 45 years, and 73 per 100,000 males younger than 45 years. The prevalence 
values were lower in age-matched rural populations except for females aged 45 
years and older. In Ontario, the prevalence in 2010 was estimated to be 784 
(with a 95% confidence interval of 779 to 789) per 100,000 people. Patients with 
RA have a shorter life expectancy than the general population and are at higher 
risk of experiencing cardiovascular events. Methotrexate (MTX), a conventional 
synthetic disease modifying anti-rheumatic drug (csDMARD), is a folic acid 
antagonist and is the drug that is most commonly used to treat RA. Some patients 
may be intolerant of or may not respond adequately to MTX monotherapy, therefore 
alternate forms of therapy have emerged. Other csDMARDs such as sulfasalazine 
(SSZ), leflunomide (LEF), and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) are available and are 
offered as monotherapy or in combination with other csDMARDs or biologics. For 
patients who are intolerant of specific csDMARDs or whose RA is inadequately 
controlled with one or more csDMARDs, biologic therapies such as tumor necrosis 
inhibitors, T-cell stimulation inhibitors, CD20 inhibitors, IL-6 inhibitors, or 
JAK inhibitors, are increasingly being recommended. However, given that 
biologics are significantly more costly than csDMARDs, there are renewed efforts 
to determine whether combinations of csDMARDs may be more cost-effective. The 
aim of this report is to summarize the cost-effectiveness evidence on triple 
csDMARDs therapy (specifically, methotrexate, sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine) 
relative to other pharmacologic options for the management of RA in North 
America.

The blood flow through the major vessels holds great diagnostic potential for 
the identification of cardiovascular complications and is therefore routinely 
assessed with current diagnostic modalities. Heart valves are subject to high 
hydrodynamic loads which render them prone to premature degradation. Failing 
native aortic valves are routinely replaced with bioprosthetic heart valves. 
This type of prosthesis is limited by a durability that is often less than the 
patient's life expectancy. Frequent assessment of valvular function can 
therefore help to ensure good long-term outcomes and to plan reinterventions. In 
this article, we describe how unsupervised novelty detection algorithms can be 
used to automate the interpretation of blood flow data to improve outcomes 
through early detection of adverse cardiovascular events without requiring 
repeated check-ups in a clinical environment. The proposed method was tested in 
an in-vitro flow loop which allowed simulating a failing aortic valve in a 
laboratory setting. Aortic regurgitation of increasing severity was deliberately 
introduced with tube-shaped inserts, preventing complete valve closure during 
diastole. Blood flow recordings from a flow meter at the location of the 
ascending aorta were analyzed with the algorithms introduced in this article and 
a diagnostic index was defined that reflects the severity of valvular 
degradation. The results indicate that the proposed methodology offers a high 
sensitivity towards pathological changes of valvular function and that it is 
capable of automatically identifying valvular degradation. Such methods may be a 
step towards computer-assisted diagnostics and telemedicine that provide the 
clinician with novel tools to improve patient care.

BACKGROUND: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is criticized by some 
as an expensive treatment in super-elder patients with limited life expectancy. 
However, there is a knowledge gap regarding the magnitude of clinical benefit 
provided by TAVI in comparison with conservative management in patients with 
severe aortic stenosis (AS) in real clinical practice, which would be important 
in the decision making for TAVI.
METHODS: We combined two independent registries, namely CURRENT AS and K-TAVI 
registries. CURRENT AS was a multicenter registry enrolling 3815 consecutive 
patients with severe AS irrespective to treatment modalities between January 
2003 and December 2011. K-TAVI was a multicenter, prospective registry including 
449 consecutive patients with severe AS, who underwent TAVI with SAPIEN XT 
balloon-expandable valves between October 2013 and June 2016. In these 2 
registries, 449 patients received TAVI and 894 patients were managed with 
conservative strategy. We conducted propensity score matching and finally 
obtained a cohort of 556 patients (278 patients for each group) for the 
analysis. The primary outcome measures were all-cause death and heart failure 
(HF) hospitalization at 2-year.
RESULTS: The cumulative 2-year incidences of all-cause death and HF 
hospitalization were significantly lower in the TAVI group than in the 
conservative group (16.8% versus 36.6%, P<0.001, and 10.7% versus 37.2%, 
P<0.001). After adjusting the residual confounders, TAVI reduced the risks of 
all-cause death (HR, 0.46; 95%CI, 0.32-0.69; P = 0.0001) and HF hospitalizations 
(HR, 0.25; 95%CI, 0.16-0.40; P<0.0001) compared with conservative strategy. 
There was no difference in the cumulative incidence of non-cardiovascular death 
between the 2 groups.
CONCLUSIONS: TAVI in the early Japanese experience was associated with striking 
risk reduction for all-cause death as well as HF hospitalization as compared 
with the historical cohort of patients with severe AS who were managed 
conservatively just before introduction of TAVI in Japan.

In the field of developmental origins of health and diseases among humans, 
classical epidemiology has limited power. We hypothesize that widely available 
"biological clocks" would introduce a new era in the history of health research. 
By contrasting chronological age and physiological age, "biological clocks" 
might become instrumental, without any delay, in exploring the possible 
long-term effects of a highly modified lifestyle during the "primal period". The 
aging process, life expectancy and health in general would be the main criteria. 
Today "DNA methylation GrimAge", based on estimations of plasma protein levels, 
may be considered to be the best predictor of lifespan and healthspan.

Fifteen years ago, Gaceta Sanitaria published the article entitled "What is an 
efficient health technology in Spain?" The growing interest in setting the price 
of new technologies based on the value they provide to health systems and the 
experience accumulated by the countries in our environment make it opportune to 
review what constitutes an efficient health intervention in Spain in 2020. 
Cost-effectiveness analysis continues to be the reference method to maximize 
social health outcomes with the available resources. The interpretation of its 
results requires establishing reference values that serve as a guide on what 
constitutes a reasonable value for the health care system. Efficiency thresholds 
must be flexible and dynamic, and they need to be updated periodically. Its 
application should be based on and transparency, and consider other factors that 
reflect social preferences. Although setting thresholds is down to political 
decision-makers, in Spain it could be reasonable to use thresholds of 25,000 and 
60,000 Euros per QALY. However, currently, in addition to determining exact 
figures for the threshold, the key question is whether the Spanish National 
Health System is able and willing to implement a payment model based on value, 
towards achieving gradual financing decisions and, above all, to improve the 
predictability, consistency and transparency of the process.

OBJECTIVE: In the U.S., genetic testing for maturity-onset diabetes of the young 
(MODY) is frequently delayed because of difficulty with insurance coverage. 
Understanding the economic implications of clinical genetic testing is 
imperative to advance precision medicine for diabetes. The objective of this 
article is to assess the cost-effectiveness of genetic testing, preceded by 
biomarker screening and followed by cascade genetic testing of first-degree 
relatives, for subtypes of MODY in U.S. pediatric patients with diabetes.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We used simulation models of distinct forms of 
diabetes to forecast the clinical and economic consequences of a systematic 
genetic testing strategy compared with usual care over a 30-year time horizon. 
In the genetic testing arm, patients with MODY received treatment changes 
(sulfonylureas for HNF1A- and HNF4A-MODY associated with a 1.0% reduction in 
HbA1c; no treatment for GCK-MODY). Study outcomes included costs, life 
expectancy (LE), and quality-adjusted life years (QALY).
RESULTS: The strategy of biomarker screening and genetic testing was cost-saving 
as it increased average quality of life (+0.0052 QALY) and decreased costs 
(-$191) per simulated patient relative to the control arm. Adding cascade 
genetic testing increased quality-of-life benefits (+0.0081 QALY) and lowered 
costs further (-$735).
CONCLUSIONS: A combined strategy of biomarker screening and genetic testing for 
MODY in the U.S. pediatric diabetes population is cost-saving compared with 
usual care, and the addition of cascade genetic testing accentuates the 
strategy's benefits. Widespread implementation of this strategy could improve 
the lives of patients with MODY while saving the health system money, 
illustrating the potential population health benefits of personalized medicine.

The vertebrate tail: a gene playground for evolution.

Portugal. mallo@igc.gulbenkian.pt.

The tail of all vertebrates, regardless of size and anatomical detail, derive 
from a post-anal extension of the embryo known as the tail bud. Formation, 
growth and differentiation of this structure are closely associated with the 
activity of a group of cells that derive from the axial progenitors that build 
the spinal cord and the muscle-skeletal case of the trunk. Gdf11 activity 
switches the development of these progenitors from a trunk to a tail bud mode by 
changing the regulatory network that controls their growth and differentiation 
potential. Recent work in the mouse indicates that the tail bud regulatory 
network relies on the interconnected activities of the Lin28/let-7 axis and the 
Hox13 genes. As this network is likely to be conserved in other mammals, it is 
possible that the final length and anatomical composition of the adult tail 
result from the balance between the progenitor-promoting and -repressing 
activities provided by those genes. This balance might also determine the 
functional characteristics of the adult tail. Particularly relevant is its 
regeneration potential, intimately linked to the spinal cord. In mammals, known 
for their complete inability to regenerate the tail, the spinal cord is removed 
from the embryonic tail at late stages of development through a Hox13-dependent 
mechanism. In contrast, the tail of salamanders and lizards keep a functional 
spinal cord that actively guides the tail's regeneration process. I will argue 
that the distinct molecular networks controlling tail bud development provided a 
collection of readily accessible gene networks that were co-opted and combined 
during evolution either to end the active life of those progenitors or to make 
them generate the wide diversity of tail shapes and sizes observed among 
vertebrates.

PURPOSE: To examine the prognosis after BCR with and without salvage therapy, 
including radiation and/or androgen deprivation.
METHODS: The study population consisted of 431 patients, all of whom underwent 
radical prostatectomy and developed BCR (PSA > 0.2 ng/mL). According to the two 
risk factors [Gleason score ≥ 8 and PSA-doubling time (DT) < 6 months], we 
divided the patients into two groups. The high/intermediate-risk group consisted 
of patients with both or one risk factor. On the other hand, patients with 
neither factor were in the low-risk group. We set the starting point at the 
timing of BCR, and the endpoints were development to castration-resistant 
prostate cancer (CRPC) and cancer-specific death.
RESULTS: During the mean follow-up period of 8.3 years after BCR, CRPC was 
observed in 49 patients (11.4%), and 21 patients (4.9%) died due to prostate 
cancer. We first divided the 191 high/intermediate-risk patients according to 
the PSA level (PSA < 1.0 ng/mL, PSA 1.0-4.0, and PSA > 4.0 or no therapy) at the 
initiation of salvage therapy, including radiation and/or androgen deprivation. 
We found that delayed (PSA > 4.0 ng/mL) or no salvage therapy was significantly 
associated with CRPC and cancer-specific death. In the 240 low-risk patients, 
Kaplan-Meier curves demonstrated no significant difference in CRPC-free survival 
or cancer-specific survival within 10 years from the timing of BCR.
CONCLUSIONS: Observation after BCR without salvage therapy or delayed 
administration may be an option for low-risk patients with a Gleason score ≤ 7 
and PSA-DT ≥ 6 months when their life expectancy is within 10 years.

BACKGROUND: A CYP2D6 gene polymorphism is related to the effect of tamoxifen 
treatment in patient with estrogen-receptor positive (ER) positive breast cancer 
and CYP2D6*10 T/T can lead to a poor prognosis in Asian patients. Although 
one-off pharmacogenetic testing may optimize adjuvant endocrine therapy, testing 
prior to tamoxifen initiation incurs additional costs.
AIM: We conducted a study to assess the cost-effectiveness of CYP2D6*10 
pharmacogenetic testing to guide the adjuvant endocrine therapy compared with 
tamoxifen without CYP2D6*10 testing in China.
METHODS: A semi-Markov model was developed to evaluate costs and health outcomes 
represented as quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained. Input data were 
obtained from the public literature. The results were expressed as incremental 
cost per QALY gained. A one-way deterministic sensitivity analysis explored the 
impact of uncertainty in the model parameters on results, and probabilistic 
uncertainty was assessed through a Monte Carlo probabilistic sensitivity 
analysis.
RESULTS: In the base-case analysis, in the CYP2D6*10 testing and alternative 
adjuvant endocrine therapy group, the incremental total cost was US$17,966.95 
and the incremental QALY was 3.582. Thus, the incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio was US$5015.693 per QALY gained. Compared with a willingness-to-pay 
threshold of US$26,508/QALY in China, the CYP2D6*10 testing is the dominant 
strategy in postmenopausal women with ER-positive breast cancer in China, and 
the increased cost of genetic testing was completely worthwhile. The sensitivity 
analyses showed that the model we built was quite stable.
CONCLUSION: From the perspective of the Chinese healthcare system, CYP2D6*10 
pharmacogenetic testing was cost effective for postmenopausal women with 
ER-positive early breast cancer.

BACKGROUND: Entire deletion of the azoospermia factor a (AZFa) region commonly 
results in non-obstructive-azoospermia (NOA). Although sY84 and sY86 are 
recommended as the first choice of sequence-tagged sites (STSs) primers in AZFa 
region, and their deletions suggest a very high probability of complete deletion 
of AZFa, extension analysis is now compulsory to identify the deletion pattern.
OBJECTIVES: We aim to verify that extension analysis is relevant in assessing 
the deletion pattern of AZF by reporting a family in which two normal fertile 
men were confirmed to have a deletion of sY84 and sY86.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: According to the EAA/EMQN recommendation, AZF evaluation 
was detected by multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with six STSs, and 
extension analysis was performed to identify the deletion pattern due to the 
deletions of sY84 and sY86. And the further exploration was conducted to map the 
breakpoints of deleted DNA fragment.
RESULTS: Deletion of sY84 and sY86 was found in the case with coinstantaneous 
normal semen analysis. An identically partial deletion pattern of AZFa region 
with the absence of an hg38Y fragment (12470437~12690385, 219949 bp in total) 
was found in both the case and his father, which includes three pseudogenes and 
one non-coding-RNA gene.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: The extension analysis has permitted the diagnosis of 
a partial AZFa deletion and confirmed the importance of the extension analysis 
in order to provide a more accurate prediction for the testis phenotype.

Sciences,Hacettepe University, Ankara, Turkey.

Seyhan K, Kerem-Günel M. Does stable sitting influence upper limb function in 
children with cerebral palsy? Turk J Pediatr 2019; 61: 79-84. Bilateral spastic 
cerebral palsy (BSCP) patients frequently need to use various sitting devices 
for body control and function. The aim of this study was to investigate whether 
the use of a belt to position the pelvis in an adjustable chair would affect 
upper limb function in preschool children with BSCP. Fortyone children with BSCP 
[mean age 44 ±11, range 18-60 months] classified according to the Gross Motor 
Function Classification System (GMFCS), as level III (n=21) and level IV (n=20) 
were fitted with a hip-positioning belt. Upper limb functions were assessed by 
Quality of Upper Extremity Skills Test (QUEST). The median scores of the 
following upper extremity functions increased significantly by wearing the hip 
positioning belt: dissociated movements, grasping, weight bearing and protective 
extension. The total QUEST score increased from 56.7 (±46.3) to 66.1 (±39.2) (p 
< 0.001). The portable and adaptable hip-positioning belt may be used in daily 
life to improve upper limb activity in preschool children with moderate to 
severe BSCP.

OBJECTIVES: Skeletal muscle weakness and an increase in fatigability 
independently contribute to age-related functional decline. The objective of 
this study was to examine the combined contribution of these deficiencies (i.e., 
torque capacity) to physical function, and then to assess the functional 
implications of progressive resistance training (PRT) mediated-torque capacity 
improvements in mobility-limited older adults.
DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial.
SETTING: Exercise laboratory on the Health Sciences campus of an urban 
university.
PARTICIPANTS: Seventy mobility-limited (Short Physical Performance Battery 
(SPPB) ≤9) older adults (~79 yrs).
INTERVENTION: Progressive resistance training or home-based flexibility 3 
days/week for 12 weeks.
MEASUREMENTS: Torque capacity was defined as the sum of peak torques from an 
isokinetic knee extension fatigue test. Relationships between torque capacity 
and performance-based and patient-reported functional measures before and after 
PRT were examined using partial correlations adjusted for age, sex, and body 
mass index.
RESULTS: Torque capacity explained (P<0.05) 10 and 28% of the variance in 
six-minute walk distance and stair climb time, respectively. PRT-mediated torque 
capacity improvements were paralleled by increases (P<0.05) in self-reported 
activity participation (+20%) and advanced lower extremity function (+7%), and 
associated (P<0.05) with a reduction in activity limitations (r=0.44) and an 
improved SPPB score (r=0.32).
CONCLUSION: Skeletal muscle torque capacity, a composite of strength and 
fatigue, may be a proximal determinant of physical function in mobility-limited 
older individuals. To more closely replicate the musculoskeletal demands of 
real-life tasks, future studies are encouraged to consider the combined 
interaction of distinct skeletal muscle faculties to overall functional ability 
in older adults.

Division database. The sum of characteristic traditional Japanese foods 
(beneficial food components in the Japanese diet: rice, fish, soybeans, 
vegetables, eggs, and seaweeds; food components rarely used in the Japanese 
diet: wheat, milk, and red meat) was divided as tertiles (beneficial food 
components: -1, 0, 1; rarely used food components: 1, 0, -1). Obesity rate was
