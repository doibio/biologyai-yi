Mean 24 month Nottingham EADL Scale scores were EXTRAS (n=219) 40.0 (SD 18.1) 
and usual care (n=231) 37.2 (SD 18.5) giving an adjusted mean difference of 1.8 
(95% CI, -0.7 to 4.2). 1155/1338 (86%) of expected EXTRAS reviews were 
undertaken. Over 24 months, the mean cost of resource utilization was lower in 
the intervention group: -£311 (-$450 [95% CI, -£3292 to £2787; -$4764 to 
$4033]). EXTRAS provided more Quality Adjusted Life Years (0.07 [95% CI, 0.01 to 
0.12]). At current conventional thresholds of willingness to pay (£20 000 
[$28 940] per Quality Adjusted Life Years), there was a 90% chance that EXTRAS 
could be considered cost-effective. Conclusions- EXTRAS did not significantly 
improve stroke survivors' performance in extended activities of daily living. 
However, given the impact on costs and Quality Adjusted Life Years, EXTRAS may 
be an affordable addition to improve stroke care. Clinical Trial Registration-

AIMS: Limited data are available regarding the ability of sacubitril/valsartan 
to provide clinically meaningful health-related quality of life (HRQoL) 
improvements among individuals with heart failure (HF). Objective measurement of 
physical activity and sleep using actigraphy can provide insight into daily 
functioning and HRQoL.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We designed an 18 week, multicenter, randomized, 
double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group study to objectively assess changes 
in function and HRQoL directly after initiating sacubitril/valsartan vs. 
enalapril in participants with HF in their home environments. A total of 136 
outpatient, ambulatory participants with New York Heart Association Class II or 
III HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) will be included in the study. 
Patients will undergo a 2 week baseline observational phase (continuing current 
HF treatment); data from the second week of this phase will be the baseline 
value for comparison with those of subsequent periods. Patients will then enter 
an 8 week blinded-treatment phase (randomly assigned 1:1 to sacubitril/valsartan 
or enalapril), followed by an 8 week open-label extension phase (treatment with 
only sacubitril/valsartan). The primary efficacy endpoint is the change in mean 
activity counts during the most active 30 min of the participant's day between 
baseline and the final randomized treatment phase measurement. Secondary 
endpoints include the change in mean sleep activity during the randomized and 
open-label phases; questionnaires will also assess HRQoL measures. Rather than 
analysing pooled actigraphy data, the researchers are considering each 
participant to be acting as his or her own control.
CONCLUSIONS: This will be the first study to assess the effects of 
sacubitril/valsartan on objective measures of sleep and activity in individuals 
with HFrEF within the context of their daily lives. Wearable accelerometer 
devices will be used to gain insight into how the medication affects physical 
activity and sleep.

Background: The current life expectancy in India is <70 years. Type 2 diabetes 
mellitus (T2DM) is known to reduce life expectancy by 6-8 years. Hence elderly 
people with T2DM in India would be rare. We report on the clinical profile of 
Asian Indian patients with T2DM who lived beyond 90 years of age and compared 
them with T2DM patients aged 50 to 60 years. Methods: From the diabetes 
electronic medical records of >470,000 diabetes patients, we identified T2DM 
patients who had lived ≥90 years and compared them with those in the 50-60 years 
age group, matched for gender and duration of diabetes. Clinical data included 
age at last visit, age at diagnosis, duration of diabetes, family history, 
smoking and alcohol, details of medications, body mass index (BMI), and blood 
pressure. Biochemical data included fasting and postprandial plasma glucose, 
glycated hemoglobin, fasting and stimulated C-peptide levels, lipid profile, and 
renal function studies. Assessment of retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy, 
coronary artery disease (CAD), and peripheral vascular disease (PVD) was also 
done. Results: A total of 325 T2DM patients aged ≥90 years and 278 T2DM patients 
aged between 50 and 60 years were selected for the study. Patients aged ≥90 
years had higher systolic blood pressure (P < 0.001) and lower BMI (P < 0.001) 
than those between 50 and 60 years. Prevalence of retinopathy (29.7% vs. 53.5%) 
and macroalbuminuria (3.7% vs. 16.0%) was lower in the ≥90 years T2DM patients 
than in the 50-60 years age group. However, prevalence of neuropathy (89.8% vs. 
50.8%), PVD (13.5% vs. 2.0%), and CAD (60.3% vs. 32.0%) was higher among the ≥90 
years patients. Eighty-five percent of the T2DM aged ≥90 years were on oral 
hypoglycemic agents (OHAs), (of whom 64.9% were on sulfonylurea), 12% were on 
insulin, and 3% on diet alone. Among the 50-60 years old, 87.8% were on OHAs and 
12.2% on insulin. Conclusions: This is the first report on the clinical profile 
of Asian Indians with T2DM aged ≥90 years, and significant differences are seen 
in their clinical profile compared with younger T2DM patients.

BACKGROUND: Delayed diagnosis of Oral Cancer (OC) can mean a difference in 
quality and expectancy of life for the patient. This delay could be from the 
healthcare side, or more importantly from the patient's side. Globally, there 
are studies enumerating the causes for delays from the patients' side in seeking 
healthcare for Oral Cancer; however, no similar research is found in the context 
of Pakistan. This study endeavoured to understand the health seeking behaviour, 
reasons for delay in consultation and the impact on OC patients' lives.
METHODS: In-depth interviews were conducted with randomly selected OC patients 
at a private sector tertiary care facility in Islamabad (who met the inclusion 
criteria of having successfully been treated for Oral Cancer) which caters to 
the most diverse population for the treatment of Oral Cancer. Theoretical 
saturation was achieved at 14 interviews. All participants gave verbal consent 
for participation, which was recorded prior to the interviews.
RESULTS: Patients (age range 43-68 years) had received the surgical treatment 
and radiation. The reported delay before seeking a proper medical advice ranged 
from 1 month to 2 years. Lack of awareness about OC risk factors, symptoms, and 
whom to approach for treatment were the main reasons. Most respondents relied on 
self-treatment considering the non-healing wound/ulcer to be a minor issue until 
they were advised a consultation with a specialist. Treatment started within 
1-3 months after a confirmed diagnosis on biopsy. The reported average 
expenditure on treatment was US$5000-10,000, mostly covered through a private 
health insurance and others borrowed the money.
CONCLUSION: A socio-behavioural change campaign for the general population can 
result in earlier presentation of the OC, minimizing the financial burden on the 
patient as well as the health system, and improving the quality of life of the 
patients.

BACKGROUND: Active surveillance (AS) is an accepted means of managing low-risk 
prostate cancer. Because of the rarity of downstream events, data from existing 
AS cohorts cannot yet address how differences in surveillance intensity affect 
metastasis and mortality. This study projected the comparative benefits of 
different AS schedules in men diagnosed with prostate cancer who had Gleason 
score (GS) ≤6 disease and risk profiles similar to those in North American AS 
cohorts.
METHODS: Times of GS upgrading were simulated based on AS data from the 
University of Toronto, Johns Hopkins University, the University of California at 
San Francisco, and the Canary Pass Active Surveillance Cohort. Times to 
metastasis and prostate cancer death, informed by models from the Scandinavian 
Prostate Cancer Group 4 trial, were projected under biopsy surveillance 
schedules ranging from watchful waiting to annual biopsies. Outcomes included 
the risk of metastasis, the risk of death, remaining life-years (LYs), and 
quality-adjusted LYs.
RESULTS: Compared with watchful waiting, AS biopsies reduced the risk of 
prostate cancer metastasis and prostate cancer death at 20 years by 1.4% to 3.3% 
and 1.0% to 2.4%, respectively; and 5-year biopsies reduced the risk of 
metastasis and prostate cancer death by 1.0% to 2.4% and 0.6% to 1.6%, 
respectively. There was little difference between annual and 5-year biopsy 
schedules in terms of LYs (range of differences, 0.04-0.16 LYs) and 
quality-adjusted LYs (range of differences, -0.02 to 0.09 quality-adjusted LYs).
CONCLUSIONS: Among men diagnosed with GS ≤6 prostate cancer, obtaining a biopsy 
every 3 or 4 years appears to be an acceptable alternative to more frequent 
biopsies. Reducing surveillance intensity for those who have a low risk of 
progression reduces the number of biopsies while preserving the benefit of more 
frequent schedules.

BACKGROUND: Revascularization is the cornerstone in the treatment of patients 
with critical limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI). However, the 2-year mortality 
rate is up to 50% in these patients. Therefore, the clinical benefit of 
revascularization needs to be considered carefully. The question emerges if 
there are changes in quality of life (QoL) and health status (HS) in the 
end-of-life phase of CLTI in older patients.
METHODS: Patients with CLTI and of an age of 70 years or older were included in 
a prospective observational cohort study. Treatment consisted of endovascular 
revascularization, surgical revascularization, or conservative therapy. The 
follow-up period was 2 years. Within this follow-up period, patients completed 
the following questionnaires at six specified time intervals: the WHOQOL-BREF 
and the SF-12. Patients who died within 2 years after inclusion were analyzed. 
Final scores were defined as the last measurement at end of follow-up or death.
RESULTS: Eighty two patients (42.1%) died during the 24-month follow-up. QoL and 
HS before death did not decrease with treatment (option: endovascular 
intervention, surgical revascularization, or conservative therapy).
CONCLUSIONS: Older patients with CLTI and a life expectancy less than 2 years 
had no differences in QoL and HS before death compared to their previous 
measurement. Except for the mental HS domain, no differences in the percentage 
of patients showing significant individual change in QoL and HS were found 
between the treatments. For clinicians, it is important to use patient-reported 
outcome measure when discussing treatment for older frail patients with CLTI in 
a shared decision-making process.

While the incidence of cancer in children and adolescents has significantly 
increased over the last decades, improvements made in the field of cancer 
therapy have led to an increased life expectancy for childhood cancer survivors. 
However, the gonadotoxic effect of the treatments may lead to infertility. 
Although semen cryopreservation represents the most efficient and safe fertility 
preservation method for males producing sperm, it is not feasible for 
prepubertal boys. The development of an effective strategy based on the 
pharmacological protection of the germ cells and testicular function during 
gonadotoxic exposure is a non-invasive preventive approach that prepubertal boys 
could benefit from. However, the progress in this field is slow. Currently, 
cryopreservation of immature testicular tissue (ITT) containing spermatogonial 
stem cells is offered to prepubertal boys as an experimental fertility 
preservation strategy by a number of medical centers. Several in vitro and in 
vivo fertility restoration approaches based on the use of ITT have been 
developed so far with autotransplantation of ITT appearing more promising. In 
this review, we discuss the pharmacological approaches for fertility protection 
in prepubertal and adolescent boys and the fertility restoration approaches 
developed on the utilization of ITT.

BACKGROUND: Hypsizygus marmoreus, a high value commercialized edible mushroom is 
widely cultivated in East Asia, and has become one of the most popular edible 
mushrooms because of its rich nutritional and medicinal value. Mitochondria are 
vital organelles, and play various essential roles in eukaryotic cells.
RESULTS: In this study, we provide the Hypsizygus marmoreus mitochondrial (mt) 
genome assembly: the circular sequence is 102,752 bp in size and contains 15 
putative protein-coding genes, 2 ribosomal RNAs subunits and 28 tRNAs. We 
compared the mt genomes of the 27 fungal species in the Pezizomycotina and 
Basidiomycotina subphyla, with the results revealing that H. marmoreus is a 
sister to Tricholoma matsutake and the phylogenetic distribution of this fungus 
based on the mt genome. Phylogenetic analysis shows that Ascomycetes 
mitochondria started to diverge earlier than that of Basidiomycetes and 
supported the robustness of the hyper metric tree. The fungal sequences are 
highly polymorphic and gene order varies significantly in the dikarya data set, 
suggesting a correlation between the gene order and divergence time in the fungi 
mt genome. To detect the mt genome variations in H. marmoreus, we analyzed the 
mtDNA sequences of 48 strains. The phylogeny and variation sited type statistics 
of H. marmoreus provide clear-cut evidence for the existence of four 
well-defined cultivations isolated lineages, suggesting female ancestor origin 
of H. marmoreus. Furthermore, variations on two loci were further identified to 
be molecular markers for distinguishing the subgroup containing 32 strains of 
other strains. Fifteen conserved protein-coding genes of mtDNAs were analyzed, 
with fourteen revealed to be under purifying selection in the examined fungal 
species, suggesting the rapid evolution was caused by positive selection of this 
gene.
CONCLUSIONS: Our studies have provided new reference mt genomes and comparisons 
between species and intraspecies with other strains, and provided future 
perspectives for assessing diversity and origin of H. marmoreus.

BACKGROUND: Physical inactivity is a global public health problem, partly due to 
urbanization and increased use of passive modes of transport such as private 
motor vehicles. Improving accessibility to public transport could be an 
effective policy for Governments to promote equity and efficiency within 
transportation systems, increase population levels of physical activity and 
reduce the negative externalities of motor vehicle use. Quantitative estimates 
of the health impacts of improvements to public transport accessibility may be 
useful for resource allocation and priority-setting, however few studies have 
been published to inform this decision-making. This paper aims to estimate the 
physical activity, obesity, injury, health and healthcare cost-saving outcomes 
of scenario-based improvements to public transport accessibility in Melbourne, 
Australia.
METHODS: Baseline and two hypothetical future scenario estimates of improved 
public transport accessibility for Melbourne, Australia, were derived using a 
spatial planning and decision tool designed to simulate accessibility 
performance (the Spatial Network Analysis for Multimodal Urban Transport Systems 
(SNAMUTS)). Public transport related physical activity was quantified by strata 
of age group and sex from Melbourne travel survey data (VISTA survey) and used 
with the SNAMUTS Composite Index to estimate input data for health impact 
modelling for the Melbourne population aged 20-74 years. A proportional 
multi-state, multiple cohort lifetable Markov model quantified the potential 
health gains and healthcare cost-savings from estimated changes in physical 
activity, body weight and injuries related to walking to access/egress public 
transport under two scenarios: (S1) public transport accessibility under current 
policy directions, and (S2) multi-directional, high-frequency network 
improvements.
RESULTS: Multi-directional, high-frequency improvements to the public transport 
network (S2) resulted in significantly greater health and economic gains than 
current policy directions (S1) in relation to physical activity (mean 6.4 more 
MET minutes/week), body weight (mean 0.05 kg differential), health-adjusted life 
years gained (absolute difference of 4878 HALYs gained) and healthcare 
cost-savings (absolute difference of AUD43M), as compared to business as usual 
under both scenarios (n = 2,832,241 adults, over the lifecourse).
CONCLUSIONS: Based on our conservative analyses, improving accessibility to 
public transport will improve population health by facilitating physical 
activity and lead to healthcare cost savings compared with business-as-usual. 
These wider health benefits should be better considered in transport planning 
and policy decisions.

OBJECTIVE: Improvements in the Black-White difference in life expectancy have 
been attributed to improved diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular diseases 
and declines in cardiovascular disease mortality. However, it is unclear whether 
race differences in total cardiovascular risk and the prevalence of 
cardiovascular risk factors have improved in the United States since the 1990s.
DESIGN: Serial cross-sectional design.
SETTING: Data from the 1988-1994, 1999-2002, and 2009-2012 National Health and 
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES).
METHODS: We estimated total cardiovascular risk levels, the prevalence of 
high-risk cardiovascular risk factors and the use of antihypertensive and 
lipid-lowering drugs among US Black and White men and women to determine whether 
differential changes occurred from 1990-2010.
RESULTS: Total cardiovascular risk declined for all races from 1990-2010. The 
Black-White difference was only significant in 2000 and sex-specific analyses 
showed that trends seen in the total population were driven by changes among 
women. Black and White men did not differ in risk at any time during this 
period. Conversely, Black women had significantly higher risk than White women 
in 1990 and 2000; this difference was eliminated by 2010. Improved diagnosis and 
treatment of high blood pressure and high cholesterol reduced risk in the total 
population; improved blood pressure and lipid profiles among Black women and 
increasing obesity prevalence among White women specifically contributed to the 
narrowing of the Black-White difference in risk among women.
CONCLUSION: Cardiovascular risk and racial disparities in risk declined among US 
Whites and Blacks due to greater use and effectiveness of lipid-lowering and 
antihypertensive medications.

OBJECTIVE: Choosing therapies for type 2 diabetes that are both effective and 
cost-effective is vital as healthcare systems worldwide aim to maximize health 
of the population. The present analysis assessed the cost-effectiveness of 
once-weekly semaglutide (a novel glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor 
agonist) versus insulin glargine U100 (the most commonly used basal insulin) and 
versus dulaglutide (an alternative once-weekly GLP-1 receptor agonist), from a 
societal perspective in the Netherlands.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The IQVIA CORE Diabetes Model was used to project 
outcomes for once-weekly semaglutide 0.5 mg and 1 mg versus insulin glargine 
U100, once-weekly semaglutide 0.5 mg versus dulaglutide 0.75 mg, and once-weekly 
semaglutide 1 mg versus dulaglutide 1.5 mg. Clinical data were taken from the 
SUSTAIN 4 and SUSTAIN 7 clinical trials. The analysis captured direct and 
indirect costs, mortality, and the impact of diabetes-related complications on 
quality of life.
RESULTS: Projections of outcomes suggested that once-weekly semaglutide 0.5 mg 
was associated with improved quality-adjusted life expectancy by 0.19 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) versus insulin glargine U100 and 0.07 QALYs 
versus dulaglutide 0.75 mg. Once-weekly semaglutide 1 mg was associated with 
mean increases in quality-adjusted life expectancy of 0.27 QALYs versus insulin 
glargine U100 and 0.13 QALYs versus dulaglutide 1.5 mg. Improvements came at an 
increased cost versus insulin glargine U100, with incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratios from a societal perspective of €4988 and €495 per QALY gained for 
once-weekly semaglutide 0.5 mg and 1 mg, respectively, falling below 
Netherlands-specific willingness-to-pay thresholds. Improvements versus 
dulaglutide came at a reduced cost from a societal perspective for both doses of 
once-weekly semaglutide.
CONCLUSIONS: Once-weekly semaglutide is cost-effective versus insulin glargine 
U100, and dominant versus dulaglutide 0.75 and 1.5 mg for the treatment of type 
2 diabetes, and represents a good use of healthcare resources in the 
Netherlands.

INTRODUCTION: Fragility hip fracture is a useful surrogate marker of the burden 
of osteoporosis. With improving life expectancy and progressive ageing of 
population, the global burden of osteoporotic fracture is increasing. Despite 
this, there is paucity of data regarding epidemiology, predictors, and outcomes 
of fragility hip fractures in the Indian population.
METHODS: In this multicenter, prospective observational study, 264 patients of 
fragility hip fracture were followed up for 12 months.
RESULTS: Men (46.2%) and women (53.8%) had a nearly equal distribution of 
fragility hip fracture. Mean (±SD) age of study population was 65.9 ± 12.6 years 
and men had earlier age (64.7 ± 12.6 years) of fracture as compared to women 
(66.9 ± 12.6 years). Out of these, 89.7% patients had osteoporosis, 7.6% had 
osteopenia, and 2.7% patients had normal bone mineral density (BMD). Fractures 
predominantly occurred inside the home (229, 86.7%) as compared to outside (35, 
13.3%). Female gender, hypertension, diabetes, anemia, smoking, and alcohol were 
associated with lower BMD, but not a predictor of morbidity. Aging (P = 0.000), 
osteoporosis (P = 0.012), and diabetes (P = 0.008) were predictors of increased 
mortality. A total of 243 (92%) patients underwent surgery with a mean hospital 
stay of 13.5 ± 2.9 days and 34 (12.9%) patients died. Maximum death (73.5%) 
occurred in first 3 months and the commonest cause of death was cardiovascular 
(44.1%) related.
CONCLUSION: The majority of fragility hip fractures occurred inside the home. 
Distribution of fractures in either gender is comparable. Aging, osteoporosis, 
and diabetes are predictors of poor outcome. We recommend development of newer 
strategies that target male as well as female patients with osteoporosis with 
particular attention to prevent in-house falls and fractures.

Intermittent claudication is a symptom of atherosclerosis of the lower limbs 
(peripheral arterial disease (PAD)) and is characterized by pain and cramps of 
lower limb muscles during exercise. Claudication leads to a reduction in 
physical activity of patients. PAD is a systemic disease. Atherosclerotic 
lesions located in the arteries of the lower limbs not only pose the risk of the 
ischemic limb loss, but above all, they are an important prognostic factor. 
Patients with claudication are at significant risk of cardiovascular 
complications such as infarcts or strokes. Comprehensive rehabilitation of 
patients with intermittent claudication based on the current TASC II 
(Inter-Society Consensus for the Management of Peripheral Arterial Disease) 
guidelines, ESC (European Society of Cardiology) guidelines, and AHA (American 
Heart Association) guidelines includes supervised treadmill training, training 
on a bicycle ergometer, Nordic Walking, resistance exercises of lower limb 
muscles, and exercises of upper limbs. A trained, educated, and motivated 
patient has a chance to improve life quality as well as life expectancy.

PURPOSE: Superior ophthalmic vein thrombosis (SOVT) is an extremely rare 
condition. Few studies have been published about clinical aspects of this 
condition. In this study, we have studied the symptoms, underlying etiologies, 
treatment, pathogenesis and complication of the SOVT and we tried to classify it 
based on the etiology, treatment, and prognosis.
METHODS: We reviewed the patients' data from a tertiary academic referral 
center. Each patient with SOVT was then reviewed for symptoms associated with 
SOVT, underlying etiology, treatment protocol, treatment response, 
complications, possible pathogens, and final outcome.
RESULTS: Twenty-four cases of SOVT were included in this study. Overall, 13 
cases were diagnosed as right-sided SOVT, out of which, eight had simultaneous 
right-sided cavernous sinus thrombosis (CST). Eighteen cases were diagnosed to 
have left-sided SOVT, out of which, 11 had simultaneous left-sided CST.
CONCLUSIONS: The SOVT can be secondary to different mechanisms. The SOVT 
secondary to trauma, recent surgery and coagulopathy are mostly non-aggressive, 
and can be managed by conservative therapy and anticoagulation. The SOVT in 
patients with orbital cellulitis, history of active sinusitis or paranasal sinus 
surgery are aggressive presenting with acute orbital swelling, abscess and 
visual loss. This type of SOVT can be complicated by extension to the cavernous 
sinus and intracranial structures. These patients require urgent antibiotics 
therapy and sinus surgery. The most severe type of SOVT is caused by 
mucormycosis which may also extend intracranially resulting in stroke and is 
often life-threatening.

BACKGROUND: Life expectancy is increasing all over the world, although 
neurodegenerative disorders might drastically affect the individual activity of 
aged people. Of those, Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is one of the most social-cost 
age-linked diseases of industrialized countries. To date, retinal diseases seem 
to be more common in the developing world and characterize principally aged 
people. Agerelated Macular Degeneration (AMD) is a late-onset, neurodegenerative 
retinal disease that shares several clinical and pathological features with AD, 
including stress stimuli such as oxidative stress, inflammation and amyloid 
formations.
METHODS: In both diseases, the detrimental intra/extra-cellular deposits have 
many similarities. Aging, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, obesity, 
arteriosclerosis and smoking are risk factors to develop both diseases. Cellular 
aging routes have similar organelle and signaling patterns in retina and brain. 
The possibility to find out new research strategies represent a step forward to 
disclose potential treatment for both of them. Essential trace metals play 
critical roles in both physiological and pathological condition of retina, optic 
nerve and brain, by influencing metabolic processes chiefly upon complex 
multifactorial pathogenesis.
CONCLUSION: Hence, this review addresses current knowledge about some up-to-date 
investigated essential trace metals associated with AD and AMD. Changes in the 
levels of systemic and ocular fluid essential metals might reflect the early 
stages of AMD, possibly disclosing neurodegeneration pathways shared with AD, 
which might open to potential early detection.

Value in Health: How It Is Defined and Used in Priority Setting and Pricing in 
Norway.

Melberg HO(1).

Author information:
(1)Associate Professor, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.

Value in health is a concept that has been used in many different contexts. It 
is used in debates about priority setting, pricing of pharmaceuticals and 
payment systems. In the Norwegian context, value in health in priority setting 
is officially defined as the quality-adjusted life-years produced by an 
intervention. However, the value of an intervention is also adjusted based on 
the severity of the disease. Importantly, the value does not include gains in 
productivity. In the context of price setting, there is a movement toward 
value-based pricing. Although generally supportive, I argue that the approach is 
limited by noisy and incomplete indicators of outcome and that full value-based 
pricing of pharmaceuticals has important consequences for the distribution of 
costs.

OBJECTIVES: Current National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines 
support systemic therapy based on mutational status in stage IV non-small cell 
lung cancer (NSCLC), with stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) reserved 
for oligoprogression. We aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the routine 
addition of SBRT to upfront therapy in stage IV NSCLC by mutational subgroup.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A Markov state transition model was constructed to 
perform a cost-effectiveness analysis comparing SBRT plus maintenance therapy 
with maintenance therapy alone for oligometastatic NSCLC. Three hypothetical 
cohorts were analyzed: epidermal growth factor receptor or anaplastic lymphoma 
kinase mutation-positive, programmed death ligand-1 expressing, and 
mutation-negative group. Clinical parameters were obtained largely from clinical 
trial data, and cost data were based on 2018 Medicare reimbursement. Strategies 
were compared using the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio with effectiveness 
in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and evaluated with a willingness to pay 
threshold of $100,000 per QALY gained.
RESULTS: SBRT plus maintenance therapy was not cost-effective at a $100,000/QALY 
gained threshold, assuming the same survival for both treatments, resulting in 
an incremental cost effectiveness ratio of $564,186 and $299,248 per QALY gained 
for the epidermal growth factor receptor or anaplastic lymphoma kinase positive 
and programmed death ligand-1 positive cohorts, respectively. Results were most 
sensitive to the cost of maintenance therapy. A large overall survival gain with 
SBRT could potentially result in upfront SBRT becoming cost-effective. For the 
mutation-negative cohort, upfront SBRT was nearly cost-effective, costing 
$128,424 per QALY gained.
CONCLUSION: Adding SBRT to maintenance therapy is not a cost-effective strategy 
for oligometastatic NSCLC compared with maintenance therapy alone for 
mutation-positive groups. However, this should be validated via randomized 
trials.

OBJECTIVES: In Malaysia, there is exponential growth of patients on dialysis. 
Dialysis treatment consumes a considerable portion of healthcare expenditure. 
Comparative assessment of their cost effectiveness can assist in providing a 
rational basis for preference of dialysis modalities.
METHODS: A cost utility study of hemodialysis (HD) and continuous ambulatory 
peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) was conducted from a Ministry of Health (MOH) 
perspective. A Markov model was also developed to investigate the cost 
effectiveness of increasing uptake of incident CAPD to 55% and 60% versus 
current practice of 40% CAPD in a five-year temporal horizon. A scenario with 
30% CAPD was also measured. The costs and utilities were sourced from published 
data which were collected as part of this study. The transitional probabilities 
and survival estimates were obtained from the Malaysia Dialysis and Transplant 
Registry (MDTR). The outcome measures were cost per life year (LY), cost per 
quality adjusted LY (QALY) and incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) for 
the Markov model. Sensitivity analyses were performed.
RESULTS: LYs saved for HD was 4.15 years and 3.70 years for CAPD. QALYs saved 
for HD was 3.544 years and 3.348 for CAPD. Cost per LY saved was RM39,791 for HD 
and RM37,576 for CAPD. The cost per QALY gained was RM46,595 for HD and RM41,527 
for CAPD. The Markov model showed commencement of CAPD in 50% of ESRD patients 
as initial dialysis modality was very cost-effective versus current practice of 
40% within MOH. Reduction in CAPD use was associated with higher costs and a 
small devaluation in QALYs.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest provision of both modalities is fiscally 
feasible; increasing CAPD as initial dialysis modality would be more 
cost-effective.

OBJECTIVE: To analyze the ranking and percentage variation of the main causes of 
hospital admissions and death of Brazilian elders between 2005 and 2015, 
according to gender and age groups.
METHOD: Retrospective and temporal analysis study. The six main causes of 
hospitalization and death of elders were collected in DATASUS according to sex 
and age groups (60 ~ 79, ≥80) in 2017.
RESULTS: Heart Failure (2005) and pneumonia (2015) were the two main causes of 
hospital admissions in both sexes and age groups, except for the younger group. 
Acute Myocardial Infarction was the main cause of death in 2005 and 2015. The 
second cause in the overall ranking was the Stroke in 2005 and Pneumonia in 
2015.
CONCLUSION: Circulatory and respiratory diseases were the main causes of 
hospital admissions and death among the elderly, highlighting the impotant 
increase in pneumonia as a cause of morbimortality.
