AIMS: The Associazione Medici Diabetologi-annals initiative is a physician-led 
quality-of-care improvement scheme that has been shown to improve HbA1c 
concentration, blood pressure, lipid profiles and BMI in enrolled people with 
Type 2 diabetes. The present analysis investigated the long-term 
cost-effectiveness of enrolling people with Type 2 diabetes in the Associazione 
Medici Diabetologi-annals initiative compared with conventional management.
METHODS: Long-term projections of clinical outcomes and direct costs (in 2010 
Euros) were made using a published and validated model of Type 2 diabetes in 
people with Type 2 diabetes who were either enrolled in the Associazione Medici 
Diabetologi-annals initiative or who were receiving conventional management. 
Treatment effects were based on mean changes from baseline seen at 5 years after 
enrolment in the scheme. Costs and clinical outcomes were discounted at 3% per 
annum.
RESULTS: The Associazione Medici Diabetologi-annals initiative was associated 
with improvements in mean discounted life expectancy and quality-adjusted life 
expectancy of 0.55 years (95% CI 0.54-0.57) years and 0.48 quality-adjusted life 
years (95% CI 0.46-0.49), respectively, compared with conventional management. 
Whilst treatment costs were higher in the Associazione Medici Diabetologi-annals 
arm, this was offset by savings as a result of the reduced incidence and 
treatment of diabetes-related complications. The Associazione Medici 
Diabetologi-annals initiative was found to be cost-saving over patient lifetimes 
compared with conventional management [€ 37,289 (95% CI 37,205-37,372) vs € 
41,075 (95% CI 40,956-41,155)].
CONCLUSIONS: Long-term projections indicate that the physician-led Associazione 
Medici Diabetologi-annals initiative represents a cost-saving method of 
improving long-term clinical outcomes compared with conventional management of 
people with Type 2 diabetes in Italy.

Estimating the life expectancy with and without cognitive impairment in an older 
adult population is critical for understanding the burden of illness on 
individuals and their families, the health care system, and society at large. 
This paper presents and compares estimates of life expectancy with and without 
cognitive impairment for the noninstitutionalized population ages 60 years and 
older in São Paulo, Brazil, for the years 2000 and 2010. Life expectancy with 
and without cognitive impairment was calculated using the Sullivan method and 
prevalence estimates from data collection at two points (2000 and 2010) of the 
Health, Well-Being, and Aging (SABE) Study. Results indicate that 60-year-old 
men in São Paulo in 2000 could expect to live 14.8 years and women 17.9 years 
without cognitive impairment. By 2010, life expectancy without cognitive 
impairment had increased to 17.1 years for men and 20.0 years for women. Length 
of life with cognitive impairment differed by gender (2.3 years for men and 3.7 
years for women at age 60 in 2010). However, the absolute number of years with 
cognitive impairment remained relatively constant with age. The results indicate 
a trend for improvements in life expectancy without cognitive impairment over 
time in São Paulo. Adults in Brazil still face many years of cognitive 
impairment in their older years, particularly when compared with estimates from 
developed countries.

OBJECTIVE: Repair is indicated of asymptomatic popliteal artery aneurysms 
(aPAAs) that are >2 cm. Endovascular PAA repair with covered stents (stenting) 
is increasingly used. It is, however, unclear when an endovascular approach is 
preferred to traditional open repair with great saphenous vein bypass (GSVB). 
The goal of this study was to assess the treatment options for aPAAs using 
decision analysis.
METHODS: A Markov model was developed and a hypothetic cohort of patients with 
aPAAs was analyzed. GSVB, stenting, and nonoperative management with optimal 
medical treatment (OMT) were compared. Operative mortality, patency rates, 
quality-of-life values, and costs were determined by comprehensive review of the 
best available evidence. The main outcome was quality-adjusted life-years 
(QALYs). Secondary outcomes were cost-effectiveness and number of 
reinterventions.
RESULTS: For a 65-year-old male patient with a 2.0-cm aPAA and without 
significant comorbidities, probabilistic sensitivity analysis shows that 
intervention is preferred over OMT (5.77 QALYs, 95% credibility interval [CI], 
5.43-6.11; OMT). GSVB treatment for this patient results in slightly higher 
QALYs than stent placement, with a predicted 8.43 QALYs (GSVB: 95% CI, 
8.21-8.64) vs 8.07 QALYs (stenting: 95% CI, 7.84-8.29), a difference of 0.36 
QALYs (95% CI, 0.14-0.58). Furthermore, costs are higher for stenting ($40,464; 
95% CI, $34,814-$46,242) vs GSVB ($21,618; 95% CI, $15,932-$28,070), and more 
reinterventions are required after stenting (1.03 per patient) vs GSVB (0.52 per 
patient), making GSVB the preferred strategy for all outcomes considered. 
Stenting is preferred in patients who are at high risk for open repair (>6% 
30-day mortality) or if the 5-year primary patency rates of stenting increase to 
80%. For very old patients (>95 years) and patients with a very short life 
expectancy (<1.5 years), OMT yields higher QALYs.
CONCLUSIONS: GSVB is the preferred treatment in 65-year-old patients with aPAAs 
for all outcomes considered. However, patients at high risk for open repair or 
without suitable vein should be considered as candidates for endovascular 
repair. Very elderly patients and patients with a short life expectancy are best 
treated with OMT. Further improvement of endovascular techniques that increase 
patency rates of endovascular stents could make this the preferred therapy for 
more patients in the future.

CONTEXT: Quality-adjusted life year (QALY) estimation is a well-known but little 
used technique to compare survival adjusted for complications. Lack of 
calibration and interpretation guidance hinders implementation of QALY analyses.
OBJECTIVES: We conducted simulation studies to assess the impact of differences 
in survival, toxicity rates, and utility values on QALY results.
METHODS: Survival comparisons used both log-rank and Wilcoxon testing. We 
examined power considerations for a North Central Cancer Treatment Group Phase 
III lung cancer clinical trial (89-20-52).
RESULTS: Sample sizes of 100 events per treatment have low power to generate a 
statistically significant difference in QALYs unless the toxicity rate is 44% 
higher in one arm. For sample sizes of 200 per arm and equal survival times, 
toxicity needs to be at least 38% more in one arm for the result to be 
statistically significant, using a utility of 0.3 for days with toxicity. Sample 
sizes of 300 (500)/arm provide 80% power if there is a 31% (25%) toxicity 
difference. If the overall survival hazard ratio between the two treatment arms 
is 1.25, then samples of at least 150 patients and 13% increased toxicity are 
necessary to have 80% power to detect QALY differences. In study 89-20-52, there 
was only 56% power to determine the statistical significance of the observed 
QALY differences, clarifying the enigmatic conclusion of no statistically 
significant difference in QALY despite an observed 14.5% increase in toxicity 
between treatments.
CONCLUSION: This calibration allows researchers to interpret the clinical 
significance of QALY analyses and facilitates QALY inclusion in clinical trials 
through improved study design.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the 2012 cost utility of cataract surgery in the United 
States and to compare 2012 cost-utility data with those from 2000.
DESIGN: Value-Based Medicine (Flourtown, PA), patient preference-based, 
comparative effectiveness analysis and cost-utility analysis using 2012 real 
United States dollars.
PARTICIPANTS: Previously published Patient Outcomes Research Team Study data and 
time tradeoff utilities obtained from patients with vision loss. Visual acuity 
measurements from patients wtih untreated cataract were used as controls.
INTERVENTION: Thirteen-year, average, first-eye and second-eye cataract surgery 
cost-utility analysis using the societal and third-party insurer cost 
perspectives.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Patient value gain in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) 
and percent gain in quality of life as well as the cost-utility ratio using the 
dollars expended per QALY gained. Patient and financial value outcomes were 
discounted at 3% annually with net present value analysis.
RESULTS: First-eye cataract surgery conferred 1.6212 QALYs over the 13-year 
model, a 20.8% quality-of-life gain. Bilateral cataract surgery conferred 2.8152 
QALYs over 13 years, a 36.2% improvement in quality of life. The direct 
ophthalmic medical cost for unilateral cataract surgery in 2012 United States 
nominal dollars was $2653, an inflation-adjusted 34.2% less than in 2000 and 85% 
less than in 1985. The 2012 inflation-adjusted physician fee was 10.1% of that 
in 1985. The 13-year societal cost perspective, financial return on investment 
(ROI) for first-eye cataract surgery was $121,198, a 4567% gain. The third-party 
insurer cost perspective average cost-utility ratio was $2653/1.6212 = 
$1636/QALY for unilateral cataract surgery, whereas the societal cost 
perspective average cost-utility ratio was -$121,198/1.6212 = -$74,759/QALY. The 
net 13-year $123.4-billion financial ROI from a 1-year cohort of cataract 
surgery patients was accrued: Medicare, $36.4 billion; Medicaid, $3.3 billion; 
other insurers, $9.6 billion; patients, $48.6 billion; and increased United 
States national productivity, $25.4 billion.
CONCLUSIONS: Cataract surgery in 2012 greatly improved quality of life and was 
highly cost effective. It was 34.4% less expensive than in 2000 and 85% less 
expensive than in 1985. Initial cataract surgery yielded an extraordinary 4567% 
financial ROI to society over the 13-year model.

Evolutionary perspectives on the links between mitochondrial genotype and 
disease phenotype.

Dowling DK(1).

Author information:
(1)School of Biological Sciences, Monash University, Clayton 3800, VIC 
Australia.

BACKGROUND: Disorders of the mitochondrial respiratory chain are heterogeneous 
in their symptoms and underlying genetics. Simple links between candidate 
mutations and expression of disease phenotype typically do not exist. It thus 
remains unclear how the genetic variation in the mitochondrial genome 
contributes to the phenotypic expression of complex traits and disease 
phenotypes.
SCOPE OF REVIEW: I summarize the basic genetic processes known to underpin 
mitochondrial disease. I highlight other plausible processes, drawn from the 
evolutionary biological literature, whose contribution to mitochondrial disease 
expression remains largely empirically unexplored. I highlight recent advances 
to the field, and discuss common-ground and -goals shared by researchers across 
medical and evolutionary domains.
MAJOR CONCLUSIONS: Mitochondrial genetic variance is linked to phenotypic 
variance across a variety of traits (e.g. reproductive function, life 
expectancy) fundamental to the upkeep of good health. Evolutionary theory 
predicts that mitochondrial genomes are destined to accumulate male-harming (but 
female-friendly) mutations, and this prediction has received proof-of-principle 
support. Furthermore, mitochondrial effects on the phenotype are typically 
manifested via interactions between mitochondrial and nuclear genes. Thus, 
whether a mitochondrial mutation is pathogenic in effect can depend on the 
nuclear genotype in which is it expressed.
GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: Many disease phenotypes associated with OXPHOS malfunction 
might be determined by the outcomes of mitochondrial-nuclear interactions, and 
by the evolutionary forces that historically shaped mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) 
sequences. Concepts and results drawn from the evolutionary sciences can have 
broad, but currently under-utilized, applicability to the medical sciences and 
provide new insights into understanding the complex genetics of mitochondrial 
disease. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled Frontiers of 
Mitochondrial Research.

Comorbidity-adjusted life expectancy: a new tool to inform recommendations for 
optimal screening strategies.

Cho H, Klabunde CN, Yabroff KR, Wang Z, Meekins A, Lansdorp-Vogelaar I, Mariotto 
AB.

BACKGROUND: Many guidelines recommend considering health status and life 
expectancy when making cancer screening decisions for elderly persons.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate life expectancy for elderly persons without a history of 
cancer, taking into account comorbid conditions.
DESIGN: Population-based cohort study.
SETTING: A 5% sample of Medicare beneficiaries in selected geographic areas, 
including their claims and vital status information.
PARTICIPANTS: Medicare beneficiaries aged 66 years or older between 1992 and 
2005 without a history of cancer (n = 407 749).
MEASUREMENTS: Medicare claims were used to identify comorbid conditions included 
in the Charlson index. Survival probabilities were estimated by comorbidity 
group (no, low/medium, and high) and for the 3 most prevalent conditions 
(diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and congestive heart failure) 
by using the Cox proportional hazards model. Comorbidity-adjusted life 
expectancy was calculated based on comparisons of survival models with U.S. life 
tables. Survival probabilities from the U.S. life tables providing the most 
similar survival experience to the cohort of interest were used.
RESULTS: Persons with higher levels of comorbidity had shorter life 
expectancies, whereas those with no comorbid conditions, including very elderly 
persons, had favorable life expectancies relative to an average person of the 
same chronological age. The estimated life expectancy at age 75 years was 
approximately 3 years longer for persons with no comorbid conditions and 
approximately 3 years shorter for those with high comorbidity relative to the 
average U.S. population.
LIMITATIONS: The cohort was limited to Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries 
aged 66 years or older living in selected geographic areas. Data from the 
Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results cancer registry and Medicare claims 
lack information on functional status and severity of comorbidity, which might 
influence life expectancy in elderly persons.
CONCLUSION: Life expectancy varies considerably by comorbidity status in elderly 
persons. Comorbidity-adjusted life expectancy may help physicians tailor 
recommendations for stopping or continuing cancer screening for individual 
patients.

High-fertility phenotypes: two outbred mouse models exhibit substantially 
different molecular and physiological strategies warranting improved fertility.

Langhammer M(1), Michaelis M, Hoeflich A, Sobczak A, Schoen J, Weitzel JM.

Author information:
(1)Institut für Fortpflanzungsbiologie.

Animal models are valuable tools in fertility research. Worldwide, there are 
more than 400 transgenic or knockout mouse models available showing a 
reproductive phenotype; almost all of them exhibit an infertile or at least 
subfertile phenotype. By contrast, animal models revealing an improved fertility 
phenotype are barely described. This article summarizes data on two outbred 
mouse models exhibiting a 'high-fertility' phenotype. These mouse lines were 
generated via selection over a time period of more than 40 years and 161 
generations. During this selection period, the number of offspring per litter 
and the total birth weight of the entire litter nearly doubled. Concomitantly 
with the increased fertility phenotype, several endocrine parameters (e.g. serum 
testosterone concentrations in male animals), physiological parameters (e.g. 
body weight, accelerated puberty, and life expectancy), and behavioral 
parameters (e.g. behavior in an open field and endurance fitness on a treadmill) 
were altered. We demonstrate that the two independently bred high-fertility 
mouse lines warranted their improved fertility phenotype using different 
molecular and physiological strategies. The fertility lines display female- as 
well as male-specific characteristics. These genetically heterogeneous mouse 
models provide new insights into molecular and cellular mechanisms that enhance 
fertility. In view of decreasing fertility in men, these models will therefore 
be a precious information source for human reproductive medicine. Translated

Fairness, health, and access.

Gusmano M.

During the past two years, much of my work at The Hastings Center has explored 
the implementation of health reform in the United States and its implications 
for poor and vulnerable groups. These projects include a study of access to care 
for undocumented patients and one that examines state-level decisions about 
health reform, including Medicaid expansion and the creation of health insurance 
"marketplaces." Both raise issues central to bioethics, including fairness, 
justice, and the stewardship of society's resources. Our nation spent about 2.7 
trillion dollars on health care in 2012, and its major public health insurance 
programs represent over 20 percent of the federal budget. Despite these 
investments, there are troubling differences in life expectancy, infant 
mortality, and premature death depending on factors like income, race, 
ethnicity, gender, and where people live.

BACKGROUND: Life-expectancy of adults with congenital heart disease (CHD) has 
improved world-wide, but there are limited data on these patients' experiences 
of quality of life (QoL), life satisfaction (LS), and their determinants (e.g. 
social support), particularly among patients from developing countries.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional case-control.
METHODS: A total of 347 CHD patients (18-64 years, 52.2% women) and 353 non-CHD 
participants, matched by sex/age, were recruited from two heart hospitals in 
Tehran, Iran. LS and QoL served as dependent variables, and 
demographic/socioeconomic status, mental-somatic symptoms, social support, and 
clinical factors (e.g. defect category) served as independent variables in 
multiple regression analyses once among all participants, and once only among 
CHD patients.
RESULTS: The CHD patients had significantly lower scores in LS and all domains 
of QoL than the control group. However, having CHD was independently negatively 
associated only with overall QoL, physical health, and life and health 
satisfaction. Additionally, multivariate analyses among the CHD patients 
revealed that female sex, younger age, being employed, less emotional distress, 
and higher social support were significantly associated with higher perceived 
QoL in most domains, while LS was associated with female sex, being employed, 
less emotional distress, and better social support. Neither QoL nor LS was 
associated with cardiac defect severity.
CONCLUSIONS: The adults with CHD had poorer QoL and LS than their non-CHD peers 
in our developing country. Socio-demographics, emotional health, and social 
support were important 'determinants' of QoL and LS among the CHD patients. 
Longitudinal studies are warranted to establish causal links.

Cervical spinal tumor with large lateral extension is usually removed through 
posterolateral approach and rarely through anterolateral approach. A young man 
presented with neck pain and brachialgia. Cervical spinal MRI showed a 
intraspinal tumor with huge extraforaminal paraspinal extension. We removed the 
tumor through anterolateral (interscalene and transforaminal) approach. Post 
operatively patient recovered from his sufferings and returned to normal life. 
Here we report the case along with operative technical aspects.

Catecholamine is a group of neurotransmitters that is believed to be responsible 
for the normal function of animal brain. Physiological and behavioral changes of 
human body have been reported due to the damage of the brain function following 
lead exposure. Due to the assumption of lead disposal in brain tissue with two 
year for its half-life, which results in alteration of brain function, we 
investigated the ability of lead to change the brain catecholamines during short 
and long-term studies. Rats were exposed daily with varying amounts of lead and 
catecholamine contents of cerebellum, mid-brain and brain cortex were 
determined. Acute peritoneal administration of single dose of lead as lead 
acetate (260 μmol/Kg) after 2 h reduced (p < 0.05) the catecholamine levels of 
cerebellum, mid-brain and cortex part by 34.9%, 35.44% and 23.8%, respectively. 
The extension of experiment time to 5 h, significant (p < 0.05) reductions in 
catecholamine levels of mentioned regions of brain by 32.35%, 12.35% and 19.3% 
were seen respectively. Daily intraperitoneal administration of 10 μmol/Kg lead 
for 30 and 60 days reduced catecholamines levels of cerebellum (22.22% and 
30.44%), midbrain (12.48% and 26.27%) and brain cortex (11.58% and 26.7%) 
respectively. It might be concluded that brain dysfunction in lead intoxicated 
rat occurred through the reduction in the catecholamine levels of different 
parts of brain. Lead might be therefore considered as a probable factor in 
causing neurological disease in lead exposed man.

BACKGROUND: Life expectancy of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patients 
is usually short and selection of the most appropriate treatment is crucial. The 
aim of this study was to investigate the usefulness of serum CA 19-9 as a 
surrogate marker under no impress excluding other factors affecting CA 19-9 
level other than tumor itself.
METHODS: We recruited 1,446 patients with PDACs and patients with Lewis antigen 
both negative or obstructive jaundice were excluded to eliminate the false 
effects on CA 19-9 level. The clinicopathologic factors were reviewed including 
initial and post-treatment CA 19-9, and statistical analysis was done to 
evaluate the association of clinicopathologic factors with overall survival 
(OS).
RESULTS: The total of 944 patients was enrolled, and205 patients (22%) underwent 
operation with curative intention and 541 patients (57%) received chemotherapy 
and/or radiotherapy. The median CA 19-9 levels of initial and post-treatment 
were 670 IU/ml and 147 IU/ml respectively. The prognostic factors affecting OS 
were performance status, AJCC stage and post-treatment CA 19-9 level in 
multivariate analysis. Subgroup analysis was done for the patients who underwent 
R0 and R1 resection, and patients with normalized post-operative CA 19-9 (≤37 
IU/mL) had significantly longer OS and DFS regardless of initial CA 19-9 level; 
32 vs. 18 months, P<0.001, 16 vs. 9 months, P = 0.004 respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Post-treatment CA 19-9 and normalized post-operative CA 19-9 (R0 
and R1 resected tumors) were independent factors associated with OS and DFS, 
however, initial CA 19-9 level was not statistically significant in multivariate 
analysis.

Pharmaceutical interventions have brought about many benefits to health, 
improving the population's well-being and life expectancy. However, these 
interventions are not without potential harmful side-effects and yet searching 
for the evidence on adverse effects is challenging. This article summarises a 
PhD whose main aim was to develop a better understanding of the implications of 
using different sources and approaches to identifying relevant data on adverse 
effects. The author is Su Golder, who has recently completed her PhD at the 
University of York and who has already published several articles on specific 
aspects of her research, including this journal. This article is the first in 
the Dissertations into Practice series to report on a PhD study, and it 
summarises her research in a way which emphasises the implications for practice.

Recombinant human serum albumin (HSA) conjugates of a 15-amino-acid truncated 
peptide YY (PYY) analogue were prepared using three heterobifunctional linkers 
[succinimidyl 4-[N-maleimidomethyl]cyclohexane-1-carboxylate (SMCC), 
6-maleimidohexanoic acid N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (MHS), and 
N-[γ-maleimidobutyryloxy]sulfosuccinimide ester (GMBS)] in 2 synthetic steps 
involving (1) reaction of succinimidyl ester on linker with ε-amine of Lys2 on 
the peptide and (2) reaction of maleimide on peptide linker with free thiol of 
Cysteine 34 (Cys34) on albumin. In-process controls using ESI LC-MS were used to 
follow reactions and identify reaction products. Proteolytic digests of the 
conjugate revealed that peptide conjugation occurs at Cys34 on HSA. Conjugates 
were assayed in cell-based assays to determine potency at the human Y2-receptor, 
and selectivity at the human Y1-, Y4-, and Y5-receptors using a calcium flux 
assay. All three conjugates assayed were selective agonists of the Y2-receptor, 
and displayed nanomolar potencies. MCC and MH conjugates were selected for acute 
PK/PD studies in DIO mice. Significant reduction in food intake was observed 
with the MH conjugate, which lasted for 24 h at the 10 mg (or 4 μmol)/kg dose. 
While the MCC conjugate exhibited greater potency in vitro, it was slightly less 
effective than the MH conjugate in vivo with respect to reduction in food 
intake. Both conjugates were significantly less active than the peptide coupled 
to a 30 kDa PEG. The observed T1/2 (8-9 h) for both conjugates was significantly 
lower than that observed for the PEGylated peptide (∼25 h). These results 
suggest that, as compared with the unmodified and PEGylated peptide, the 
extended circulation half-life of albumin conjugates is mediated through uptake 
and recirculation by FcRn, and allometric scaling methods are necessary to 
account for interspecies variation in pharmacokinetic properties.

Comparing life expectancy and health-adjusted life expectancy by body mass index 
category in adult Canadians: a descriptive study.

BACKGROUND: While many studies have examined differences between body mass index 
(BMI) categories in terms of mortality risk and health-related quality of life 
(HRQL), little is known about the effect of body weight on health expectancy. We 
examined life expectancy (LE), health-adjusted life expectancy (HALE), and 
proportion of LE spent in nonoptimal (or poor) health by BMI category for the 
Canadian adult population (age ≥ 20).
METHODS: Respondents to the National Population Health Survey (NPHS) were 
followed for mortality outcomes from 1994 to 2009. Our study population at 
baseline (n=12,478) was 20 to 100 years old with an average age of 47. LE was 
produced by building abridged life tables by sex and BMI category using data 
from the NPHS and the Canadian Chronic Disease Surveillance System. HALE was 
estimated using the Health Utilities Index from the Canadian Community Health 
Survey as a measure of HRQL. The contribution of HRQL to loss of healthy life 
years for each BMI category was also assessed using two methods: by calculating 
differences between LE and HALE proportional to LE and by using a decomposition 
technique to separate out mortality and HRQL contributions to loss of HALE.
RESULTS: At age 20, for both sexes, LE is significantly lower in the underweight 
and obesity class 2+ categories, but significantly higher in the overweight 
category when compared to normal weight (obesity class 1 was nonsignificant). 
HALE at age 20 follows these same associations and is significantly lower for 
class 1 obesity in women. Proportion of life spent in nonoptimal health and 
decomposition of HALE demonstrate progressively higher losses of healthy life 
associated with lowered HRQL for BMI categories in excess of normal weight.
CONCLUSIONS: Although being in the overweight category for adults may be 
associated with a gain in life expectancy as compared to normal weight adults, 
overweight individuals also experience a higher proportion of these years of 
life in poorer health. Due to the descriptive nature of this study, further 
research is needed to explore the causal mechanisms which explain these results, 
including the important differences we observed between sexes and within obesity 
subcategories.

The present study aimed to determine the spatiotemporal dynamics of 
microvascular and astrocytic adaptation during hypoxia-induced cerebral 
angiogenesis. Adult C57BL/6J and Tie2-green fluorescent protein (GFP) mice with 
vascular endothelial cells expressing GFP were exposed to normobaric hypoxia for 
3 weeks, whereas the three-dimensional microvessels and astrocytes were imaged 
repeatedly using two-photon microscopy. After 7 to 14 days of hypoxia, a vessel 
sprout appeared from the capillaries with a bump-like head shape (mean diameter 
14 μm), and stagnant blood cells were seen inside the sprout. However, no 
detectable changes in the astrocyte morphology were observed for this early 
phase of the hypoxia adaptation. More than 50% of the sprouts emerged from 
capillaries 60 μm away from the center penetrating arteries, which indicates 
that the capillary distant from the penetrating arteries is a favored site for 
sprouting. After 14 to 21 days of hypoxia, the sprouting vessels created a new 
connection with an existing capillary. In this phase, the shape of the new 
vessel and its blood flow were normalized, and the outside of the vessels were 
wrapped with numerous processes from the neighboring astrocytes. The findings 
indicate that hypoxia-induced cerebral angiogenesis provokes the adaptation of 
neighboring astrocytes, which may stabilize the blood-brain barrier in immature 
vessels.

Rome, Piazzale Aldo Moro 5, Rome 00185, Italy. giuseppe.latorre@uniroma1.it.

The growing impact of chronic degenerative pathologies (such as cardiovascular 
disease, type 2 diabetes and Alzheimer's disease) requires and pushes towards 
the development of new preventive strategies to reduce the incidence and 
prevalence of these diseases. Lifestyle changes, especially related to the 
Mediterranean diet, have the potential to modify disease outcomes and ultimately 
costs related to their management. The objective of the study was to perform a 
systematic review of the scientific literature, to gauge the economic 
performance and the cost-effectiveness of the adherence to the Mediterranean 
diet as a prevention strategy against degenerative pathologies. We investigated 
the monetary costs of adopting Mediterranean dietary patterns by determining 
cost differences between low and high adherence. Research was conducted using 
the PubMed and Scopus databases. Eight articles met the pre-determined inclusion 
criteria and were reviewed. Quality assessment and data extraction was 
performed. The adherence to the Mediterranean diet has been extensively reported 
to be associated with a favorable health outcome and a better quality of life. 
The implementation of a Mediterranean dietary pattern may lead to the prevention 
of degenerative pathologies and to an improvement in life expectancy, a net gain 
in health and a reduction in total lifetime costs.

INTRODUCTION: With a rapidly aging society, geriatric mental health is emerging 
as an important public health concern. According to the WHO, prevalence of 
depression in adults aged ≥60 years in developed and developing countries was 
0.5 million and 4.8 million respectively in 2004. In India, increased life 
expectancy led to a rise in the older adult population between 2001 and 2011, 
expected to reach 324 million by 2050.
OBJECTIVES: To estimate the prevalence of depression and assess association 
between sociodemographic parameters and depression among older adults in a rural 
Indian community.
METHODS: A cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted in February and March 
2012 in the rural village of Sembakkam, Kancheepuram District in the state of 
Tamil Nadu, India; the village has a population of 5948, 3.1% of whom are aged 
≥60 years. Universal sampling technique was employed, in which every household 
in the community was visited and all elderly persons were selected. After 
obtaining written informed consent (a thumbprint was taken if the person was 
illiterate), participants were assessed face to face for depression using the 
Short Form Geriatric Depression Scale. The inclusion criterion was a score >24 
on the mini-mental state examination. Final sample size was 103. Study variables 
included sociodemographic parameters such as age, sex, education, occupation, 
socioeconomic status, and marital status. Data entry and statistical analysis 
used SPSS version 17.
RESULTS: Of 103 respondents interviewed, 73 (70.9%) were aged 60-69 years and 58 
(56.3%) were male. Forty-four (42.7%) individuals (17 males, 27 females) were 
found to be depressed; 23 (22.3%) with mild depression, 14 (13.6%) moderate 
depression and 7 (6.8%) severe depression. Female sex and widowhood were 
significantly associated with depression.
CONCLUSIONS: Depression, particularly mild depression, is common in this rural 
population of older adults, particularly among women and widowed elderly. These 
study findings can help program managers implement a more comprehensive strategy 
in this community for timely interventions to promote mental health and prevent 
geriatric depression.

[Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI)].

Aortic valve stenosis (AS) is the most common acquired valve disease in the 
industrialized countries. Most patients--especially young and low-risk 
patients--can be safely and effectively operated with aortic valve replacement. 
Due to increasing life expectancy, however, the number of elderly patients with 
AS and various concomitant diseases will increase in the coming decades. For 
those elderly high-risk patients, transfemoral or transapical aortic valve 
implantation (TAVI) has evolved as a valuable alternative to conventional 
surgery. The TAVI approach has been shown to be superior to standard medical 
treatment in these high-risk patients. All patients considered for TAVI should 
be discussed in a consensus conference consisting of cardiac surgeons and 
cardiologists (heart team). Furthermore, for successful treatment with 
transcatheter techniques, sophisticated pre-interventional imaging is required 
to screen patients. Available data on TAVI from randomized trials and 
large-scale registries demonstrate that this method is very promising.

Sydney, Australia.

This paper reports the results of a best-worst scaling (BWS) study to value the 
Investigating Choice Experiments Capability Measure for Adults (ICECAP-A), a new 
capability measure among adults, in a UK setting. A main effects plan plus its 
foldover was used to estimate weights for each of the four levels of all five 
attributes. The BWS study was administered to 413 randomly sampled individuals, 
together with sociodemographic and other questions. Scale-adjusted latent class 
analyses identified two preference and two (variance) scale classes. Ability to 
characterize preference and scale heterogeneity was limited, but data quality 
was good, and the final model exhibited a high pseudo-r-squared. After adjusting 
for heterogeneity, a population tariff was estimated. This showed that 
'attachment' and 'stability' each account for around 22% of the space, and 
'autonomy', 'achievement' and 'enjoyment' account for around 18% each. Across 
all attributes, greater value was placed on the difference between the lowest 
levels of capability than between the highest. This tariff will enable ICECAP-A 
to be used in economic evaluation both within the field of health and across 
public policy generally.

Future trends in health and health care: implications for social work practice 
in an aging society.

Spitzer WJ(1), Davidson KW.

Author information:
(1)a Glen Allen , Virginia , USA.

Major economic, political, demographic, social, and operational system factors 
are prompting evolutionary changes in health care delivery. Of particular 
significance, the "graying of America" promises new challenges and opportunities 
for health care social work. At the same time, the Patient Protection and 
Affordable Care Act of 2010, evolution of Accountable Care Organizations, and an 
emphasis on integrated, transdisciplinary, person-centered care represent 
fundamental shifts in service delivery with implications for social work 
practice and education. This article identifies the aging shift in American 
demography, its impact on health policy legislation, factors influencing 
fundamentally new service delivery paradigms, and opportunities of the 
profession to address the health disparities and care needs of an aging 
population. It underscores the importance of social work inclusion in integrated 
health care delivery and offers recommendations for practice education.

CONCLUSION: Hearing restoration using an active middle ear implant (AMEI) is a 
highly cost-effective treatment for a selected group of patients with no other 
possibilities for auditory rehabilitation.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the cost-utility of using an AMEI for hearing 
rehabilitation.
METHODS: This was a prospective, multicenter, single-subject repeated study in 
six tertiary referral centers. Twenty-four patients with sensorineural (SNHL), 
conductive (CHL), and mixed hearing loss (MHL) were implanted with the AMEI 
Vibrant Soundbridge® (VSB) for medical reasons. All patients were previously 
rehabilitated with conventional hearing aids. Multiple validated quality of life 
patient questionnaires, Health Utilities Index (HUI 2 and 3), and Glasgow 
Hearing Aid Benefit Profile (GHABP) were used to determine the utility gain and 
quality adjusted life years (QALY). Directly related treatment costs for the
