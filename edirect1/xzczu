mixture prevented the aging-induced increase in the serum levels of saturated 
fatty acids (SFA) and the aging-induced decrease in the serum concentrations of 
mono-unsaturated fatty acids (MUFA). Old treated rats showed increased serum 
concentrations of EPA and DHA and decreased HOMA-IR index and circulating levels 
of total cholesterol, insulin and IL-6. Treatment with the oil mixture increased 
the mRNA levels of antioxidant and insulin sensitivity-related enzymes, as well 
as reduced the gene expression of pro-inflammatory markers in the liver and in 
cardiac and aortic tissues. In addition, the treatment also prevented the 
aging-induced endothelial dysfunction and vascular insulin resistance through 
activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway. Moreover, aortic rings from old rats treated 
with the oil mixture showed a decreased response to the vasoconstrictor AngII. 
In conclusion, treatment with a mixture of EVOO and AO improves the lipid 
profile, insulin sensitivity and vascular function in aged rats and decreases 
aging-induced inflammation and oxidative stress in the liver, and in the 
cardiovascular system. Thus, it could be an interesting strategy to deal with 
cardiometabolic alterations associated with aging.

Exercise and spinal manipulative therapy are commonly used for the treatment of 
chronic low back pain (CLBP) in Australia. Reduction in pain intensity is a 
common outcome; however, it is only one measure of intervention efficacy in 
clinical practice. Therefore, we evaluated the effectiveness of two common 
clinical interventions on physical and self-report measures in CLBP. 
Participants were randomized to a 6‑month intervention of general strength and 
conditioning (GSC; n = 20; up to 52 sessions) or motor control exercise plus 
manual therapy (MCMT; n =20; up to 12 sessions). Pain intensity was measured at 
baseline and fortnightly throughout the intervention. Trunk extension and 
flexion endurance, leg muscle strength and endurance, paraspinal muscle volume, 
cardio‑respiratory fitness and self-report measures of kinesiophobia, disability 
and quality of life were assessed at baseline and 3- and 6-month follow-up. Pain 
intensity differed favoring MCMT between-groups at week 14 and 16 of treatment 
(both, p = 0.003), but not at 6-month follow‑up. Both GSC (mean change (95%CI): 
-10.7 (-18.7, -2.8) mm; p = 0.008) and MCMT (-19.2 (-28.1, -10.3) mm; p < 0.001) 
had within-group reductions in pain intensity at six months, but did not achieve 
clinically meaningful thresholds (20mm) within- or between‑group. At 6-month 
follow-up, GSC increased trunk extension (mean difference (95% CI): 81.8 (34.8, 
128.8) s; p = 0.004) and flexion endurance (51.5 (20.5, 82.6) s; p = 0.004), as 
well as leg muscle strength (24.7 (3.4, 46.0) kg; p = 0.001) and endurance (9.1 
(1.7, 16.4) reps; p = 0.015) compared to MCMT. GSC reduced disability (-5.7 
(‑11.2, -0.2) pts; p = 0.041) and kinesiophobia (-6.6 (-9.9, -3.2) pts; p < 
0.001) compared to MCMT at 6‑month follow-up. Multifidus volume increased 
within-group for GSC (p = 0.003), but not MCMT or between-groups. No other 
between-group changes were observed at six months. Overall, GSC improved trunk 
endurance, leg muscle strength and endurance, self-report disability and 
kinesiophobia compared to MCMT at six months. These results show that GSC may 
provide a more diverse range of treatment effects compared to MCMT.

BACKGROUND: Guangdong province is dominated by three cultural regions: Canton, 
Hakka and Hoklo. However, little is known about the disease burden within these 
regions, particularly because different population,environmental and 
socioeconomic risk factors might cause different patterns of mortality, 
disability-adjusted life-years (DALY), life expectancy and healthy life 
expectancy (HALE). We aimed to compare the patterns of disease burden in Canton, 
Hakka and Hoklo regions between 2005 and 2015.
METHOD: We calculated the mortality, YLL, YLD for 116 diseases for different 
cultural regions between 2005 and 2015. We calculated the DALYs for 116 causes 
as the sum of YLLs and YLDs. We estimated the life expectancy and HALE by using 
sex-specific mortality rates and YLDs for the three cultural regions.
RESULTS: With a respective reduction of 22.3, 15.8 and 17.8% in 2015 compared 
with 2005, the age-standardized DALY rates in 2015 was 19,988.0, 14,396.5 and 
20,436.6 in Hakka, Canton and Hoklo region. Canton region had a significantly 
lower mortality and DALYs in most diseases, followed by Hoklo and Hakka regions. 
The life expectancy and HALE at birth were highest in Canton region in both 2005 
and 2015, than in Hoklo and Hakka region.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings call for improved public health care via the 
refinement of policy and effective measures for disease prevention. 
Understanding the environmental and culture-related risk factors of diseases in 
Hoklo and Hakka regions may help inform public health sectors to reduce the 
disease burden and the between-region inequality.

The life expectancy of extensive-stage small cell lung (ES-SCLC) cancer patients 
has not improved in the last 2-3 decades until two recent trials (CASPIAN and 
IMpower133) showing the addition of anti-programmed death ligand (PD-L1) therapy 
to chemotherapy has survival benefit over chemotherapy alone. However, such 
benefit is relatively small and was not even observed in some other trials using 
immunotherapy, raising the question of optimal chemoimmunotherapy combination in 
the 1st-line setting for ES-SCLC. Here, we discussed several thought-provoking 
questions with the focus on IMpower133 and CASPIAN trials.

BACKGROUND: The 16 Southern Africa Development Community (SADC) countries remain 
the epicentre of the HIV/AIDS epidemic with the largest number of people living 
with HIV/AIDS. Anti-retroviral treatment (ART) has improved survival and 
prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) of HIV, but the disease 
remains a serious cause of mortality. We conducted a descriptive epidemiological 
analysis of HIV/AIDS burden for the 16 SADC countries using secondary data from 
the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries and Risk Factor (GBD) Study.
METHODS: The GBD study is a systematic, scientific effort by the Institute for 
Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) to quantify the comparative magnitude of 
health loss due to diseases, injuries, and risk factors by age, sex, and 
geographies for specific points in time. We analyzed the following outcomes: 
mortality, years of life lost (YLLs), years lived with disability (YLDs), and 
disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) due to HIV/AIDS for SADC. Input data for 
GBD was extracted from censuses, household surveys, civil registration and vital 
statistics, disease registries, health service utilisation, disease 
notifications, and other sources. Country- and cause-specific HIV/AIDS-related 
death rates were calculated using the Cause of Death Ensemble model (CODEm) and 
spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression (ST-GPR). Deaths were multiplied by 
standard life expectancy at each age-group to calculate YLLs. Cause-specific 
mortality was estimated using a Bayesian meta-regression modelling tool, 
DisMod-MR. Prevalence estimates were multiplied by disability weights for 
mutually exclusive sequelae of diseases to calculate YLDs. Crude and 
age-adjusted rates per 100,000 population and changes between 1990 and 2017 were 
determined for each country.
RESULTS: In 2017, HIV/AIDS caused 336,175 deaths overall in SADC countries, and 
more than 20 million DALYs. This corresponds to a 3-fold increase from 113,631 
deaths (6,915,170 DALYs) in 1990. The five leading countries with the proportion 
of deaths attributable to HIV/AIDS in 2017 were Botswana at the top with 28.7% 
(95% UI; 23.7-35.2), followed by South Africa 28.5% (25.8-31.6), Lesotho, 25.1% 
(21.2-30.4), eSwatini 24.8% (21.3-28.6), and Mozambique 24.2% (20.6-29.3). The 
five countries had relative attributable deaths that were at least 14 times 
greater than the global burden of 1.7% (1.6-1.8). Similar patterns were observed 
with YLDs, YLLs, and DALYs. Comoros, Seychelles and Mauritius were on the lower 
end, with attributable proportions less than 1%, below the global proportion.
CONCLUSIONS: Great progress in reducing HIV/AIDS burden has been achieved since 
the peak but more needs to be done. The post-2005 decline is attributed to PMTCT 
of HIV, resources provided through the US President's Emergency Plan For AIDS 
Relief (PEPFAR), and behavioural change. The five countries with the highest 
burden of HIV/AIDS as measured by proportion of death attributed to HIV/AIDS and 
age-standardized mortaility rate were Botswana, South Africa, Lesotho, eSwatini, 
and Mozambique. SADC countries should cooperate, work with donors, and embrace 
the UN Fast-Track approach, which calls for frontloading investment from 
domestic or other sources to prevent and treat HIV/AIDS. Robust tracking, 
testing, and early treatment are required, as well as refinement of individual 
treatment strategies for transient individuals in the region.

Epic Supra valves have been used off-label in the pulmonary position. We aim to 
evaluate the durability of Epic valves in the pulmonary position. We performed a 
retrospective review of all Epic valves placed in the pulmonary position from 
October 2008 to May 2019. Time-to-event analysis was performed using 
Kaplan-Meier estimates to evaluate freedom from valve intervention, moderate 
pulmonary regurgitation, and peak velocity greater than 3.5 m/s. Valve 
dysfunction was a composite of all 3 end points. A total of 79 patients had Epic 
valves implanted in the pulmonary position. Median age was 18.5 years (15th-85th 
percentile 11.2-41.0). In total, 1 (1%) 19 mm valve, 4 (5%) 21 mm valves, 8 
(10%) 23 mm valves, 23 (29%) 25 mm valves, and 43 (54%) 27 mm valves were 
implanted. There were no deaths or transplants. Median follow-up was 3.1 years 
(interquartile range 1.0-5.5). At 5 years, freedom from valve intervention was 
95%, freedom from valve dysfunction was 68%, freedom from moderate pulmonary 
regurgitation was 73%, and freedom from peak velocity greater than 3.5 m/s was 
82%. Epic Supra valves provide an acceptable valve replacement in the pulmonary 
position for children and adults. Longer follow-up is needed to determine valve 
durability through the entirety of the valve life expectancy.

Due to improved healthcare services the human life expectancy has improved, 
therefore the interest of understanding the effect of age on number of dental 
pulp cells count has increased being key for maintaining vitality of the tooth. 
The aim of this study was to investigate correlations between numbers of dental 
pulp cells odontoblasts (OCs), subodontoblasts (SOCs) and fibroblasts (FCs) with 
age, within different age groups for Pakistani and Saudi Arabian populations. A 
total number of 220 tooth samples were included in the study, comprising of 
55-teeth for individuals aged groups between 6-30 years and 31-85 years for 
Group I and Group II of both Pakistani and Saudi Arabian populations 
respectively. The qualitative research was conducted at Riyadh Elm University, 
Riyadh, Saudi Arabia from February 2019 to July 2019. Regression equations (RE) 
for the estimation of individuals' age from dental pulp cell count were 
developed. The values of the correlations obtained for each RE indicate good 
fits for the equations obtained. The pulp cells were observed to upsurge till 
third decade of life, later were observed to decline with increasing age. 
Pearson correlation revealed positive relation between number of dental pulp 
cells with age for Group I whereas a significant negative relationship for 
individuals above 30 years above. RE generated using number of OCs, SOCs and FCs 
for determination of age with standard error estimate was ±3 and ±6 years for 
Pakistani population Group I (6-30 years) and Group II (31-85 years) 
respectively whereas, for Saudi Arabian population Group I and Group II it was 
±4 years and ±9 years. The age estimates made by the number of dental pulp cells 
were not statistically significantly different (p>0.05) from chronological age.

Pandemic enveloped RNA Novel Corona Virus' 2019 (SARS-CoV-2) appears as a 
beating reed which induce overwhelming outbreak all over the world since 
November 2019 to till date. Inherent Immunity developed by traditional food 
habit, exposure to various antigens and vitamin D induced sunlight exposure. 
Meteorological parameters are the important factors which influencing the severe 
acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) like infectious disease. Aim of this review to 
enhance our knowledge and explore the association among build up immunity, 
weather parameters and Corona virus disease (COVID-19) death. In this review we 
emphasize role of meteorological factor included degree of sun exposure and 
effect of temperature on enveloped lipid bi-layer structure of Novel corona 
virus. These meteorological factors and inherent immunity may have impact on 
SARS-CoV-2 incidence among South East Asian including Bangladeshi. In summary, 
this study suggests that temperature-humidity variation, inherent immunity and 
lower life expectancy of South East Asia may be important.

BACKGROUND: It remains unclear whether increasing longevity is accompanied by a 
compression or expansion of poor health and disability. We examined trends of 
physical functioning and morbidity in a population aged 90 and older, and 
disease- and disability-free life expectancy (LE) at age 90 between 2001 and 
2018 in Finland's third most populated city.
METHODS: We used survey data from the Vitality 90+ Study, which comprises a 
series of six repeated mailed surveys (7,590 observations). Information on 
mortality came from Statistics Finland. We examined trends of functioning 
(activities of daily living [ADL] and mobility) and cardiovascular and dementia 
morbidity using age-adjusted generalized estimating equation models stratified 
by sex. In addition, age-, sex-, and period-specific health expectancies were 
calculated using Sullivan's method.
RESULTS: Over time, functioning improved, especially, in women, and morbidity 
increased in men. From 2001 to 2018, LE at age 90 increased by 5.3 months for 
men and 6.4 months for women. LE without ADL disability increased by 5.0 months 
for men and 8.4 months for women, and LE without mobility disability by 6.0 
months for men and 4.4 months for women. LE without cardiovascular and dementia 
morbidity decreased for men (2.6 months) and increased for women (1.9 months).
CONCLUSIONS: In relative terms, we found a compression of disability for both 
sexes and an expansion of morbidity for men. Although the trends overall are 
rather positive, the increase in absolute morbidity and, to some extent, in 
disability will inevitably mean increasing care needs with population aging.

OBJECTIVES: We conduct a cost-utility analysis of inotuzumab ozogamicin (INO) 
versus chemotherapy as the standard of care (SOC) for adults with relapsed or 
refractory B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
METHODS: A Markov model incorporating transition probabilities between health 
states was applied to simulate disease progression. The model inputs, including 
overall survival, progression-free survival, and utility parameters, were 
obtained from the INO-VATE ALL trial and literatures. The Taiwan Cancer Registry 
Database and the Health and Welfare Database were utilized to identify the 
patient cohort and medical costs from the perspective of National Health 
Insurance Administration. The lifetime medical costs (in 2017 US dollars), 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained, and associated incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) were the main study outcomes.
RESULTS: The lifetime medical costs for INO and SOC were $176,795 and $69,496, 
and the QALYs gained were 2.25 and 0.84, respectively. The ICER for INO versus 
SOC was $76,044 per QALY gained, which is slightly more than three times 
Taiwan's gross domestic product per capita (i.e., $73,224). Favorable economic 
results for INO versus SOC were found with an increased time horizon for model 
simulation, less discounting for the future benefit, and higher stem cell 
transplantation (SCT) rate after INO treatment; and among patients aged less 
than 55 years, with no SCT history, or in the first salvage treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: INO versus SOC has higher costs but is more effective. The use of 
INO is favorable for patients in the early treatment course and when more future 
benefit associated with INO is considered.

OBJECTIVES: Discrete choice experiments (DCEs) can be used to obtain latent 
scale values for the EQ-5D-Y, but these require anchoring at 0 = dead to meet 
the conventions of quality-adjusted life year (QALY) estimation. The primary aim 
of this study is to compare four preference elicitation methods for obtaining 
anchors for latent scale EQ-5D-Y values.
METHODS: Four methods were tested: visual analogue scale (VAS), DCE (with a 
duration attribute), lag-time time trade-off (TTO) and the location-of-dead 
(LOD) approach. In computer-assisted personal interviews, UK general public 
respondents valued EQ-5D-3L health states from an adult perspective and EQ-5D-Y 
health states from a 10-year-old child perspective. Respondents completed 
valuation tasks using all four methods, under both perspectives.
RESULTS: 349 interviews were conducted. Overall, respondents gave lower values 
under the adult perspective compared to the child perspective, with some 
variation across methods. The mean TTO value for the worst health state (33333) 
was about equal to dead in the child perspective and worse than dead in the 
adult perspective. The mean VAS rescaled value for 33333 was also higher in the 
child perspective. The DCE produced positive child perspective values and 
negative adult perspective values, though the models were not consistent. The 
LOD median rescaled value for 33333 was negative under both perspectives and 
higher in the child perspective.
DISCUSSION: There was broad agreement across methods. Potential criteria for 
selecting a preferred anchoring method are presented. We conclude by discussing 
the decision-making circumstances under which utilities and QALY estimates for 
children and adults need to be commensurate to achieve allocative efficiency.

INTRODUCTION: Tofacitinib is an oral Janus kinase inhibitor for the treatment of 
psoriatic arthritis (PsA). We report the interim safety, tolerability, and 
efficacy of tofacitinib in PsA patients in OPAL Balance, a 3-year, open-label, 
long-term extension study (data cut-off: August 2017; database not locked, data 
may change).
METHODS: Eligible patients from two phase (P) 3 (P3) tofacitinib PsA studies 
(OPAL Broaden, NCT01877668; OPAL Beyond, NCT01882439) entered OPAL 
Balance ≤ 3 months after completing the P3 study or discontinuing for reasons 
other than study-drug-related adverse events (AEs). Patients received open-label 
tofacitinib 5 mg twice daily (BID), with adjustments to 10 mg BID permitted 
post-month (M) 1. Certain concomitant conventional synthetic disease-modifying 
antirheumatic drugs were allowed. Primary endpoints were incidence/severity of 
AEs and laboratory abnormalities, and changes from baseline in laboratory 
parameters (reported up to M36 and M30, respectively). Efficacy 
(clinical/patient-reported outcomes) was reported through M30.
RESULTS: A total of 686 patients were treated; at data cut-off, 68.2% remained 
in the study. Mean (range) treatment duration was 641 (1-1032) days; total 
treatment duration was 1153.2 patient-years. By M36, 79.6, 13.8, and 8.6% of 
patients reported AEs, serious AEs, and discontinuations due to AEs, 
respectively. Five deaths occurred; one within the risk period (incidence rate 
[IR; patients with events/100 patient-years] 0.1). IRs for AEs of special 
interest were: all (non-serious and serious) herpes zoster, 1.7; serious 
infections, 0.9; opportunistic infections, 0.3 (all 
disseminated/multi-dermatomal herpes zoster); malignancies excluding 
non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC), 0.8; NMSC, 1.0; major adverse cardiovascular 
events, 0.3; pulmonary embolisms, 0.1; and arterial thromboembolisms, 0.4. No 
patients had deep vein thrombosis. Alanine aminotransferase and aspartate 
aminotransferase levels were elevated  ≥  3-fold the upper limit of normal in 
4.0 and 2.2% of patients, respectively. Changes in laboratory parameters were 
generally stable over time, although lymphocyte counts decreased slightly. 
Efficacy was maintained through M30.
CONCLUSIONS: In this interim analysis of OPAL Balance, tofacitinib safety and 
efficacy in patients with PsA appeared to be consistent with those of the P3 
studies. Efficacy was maintained over time.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01976364.

Plain Language Summary: In many countries, tofacitinib is an approved medicine 
that can be used to treat psoriatic arthritis (PsA). In the study reported here 
(OPAL Balance), adult patients with PsA took tofacitinib for up to 3 years. We 
report a planned interim analysis, i.e., an analysis of information collected 
before the study finished. This early information suggests that the safety of 
tofacitinib, and how well it improved symptoms and quality of life (efficacy), 
was similar in this long study as in shorter studies. Information from the 
finished study will be reported later. OPAL Balance started on 17 February 2014. 
This interim analysis includes information collected by 31 August 2017. Before 
joining, patients had finished a 6-month or 12-month tofacitinib study (OPAL 
Broaden or OPAL Beyond). Patients in OPAL Balance took a 5 mg tofacitinib pill 
twice a day, but if PsA symptoms did not improve after 1 month, they could take 
a 10 mg pill twice a day. They could also take other medicines (including 
methotrexate or corticosteroids). Of the 686 patients who took tofacitinib, 546 
(80%) experienced side effects over 3 years. These were considered serious for 
95 patients (14%) and caused 59 patients (9%) to leave the study. Five patients 
died from causes not related to tofacitinib. Known tofacitinib side effects, 
including shingles (herpes zoster), serious infections (needing 
hospitalization), infections in patients with weakened immune systems, cancer, 
heart (cardiovascular) problems, and vein blockages (embolisms), were each 
reported by fewer than 20 patients. Most blood test results and tofacitinib 
efficacy were stable over 2.5 years.

Epigenetics, HIV, and Cardiovascular Disease Risk.

Ebner BF, Chueng T, Martinez CA.

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is currently considered a risk factor for 
cardiovascular disease (CVD). With the advent of antiretroviral treatment and 
prevention, HIV-related morbidity and mortality rates have decreased 
significantly. Prolonged life expectancy heralded higher prevalence of diseases 
of aging, including CVD-associated morbidity and mortality, having an earlier 
onset in people living with HIV (PLHIV) compared to their noninfected 
counterparts. Several epigenetic biomarkers are now available as predictors of 
health and disease, with DNA methylation being one of the most widely studied. 
Epigenetic biomarkers are changes in gene expression without alterations to the 
intrinsic DNA sequence, with the potential to predict risk of future CVD, as 
well as the outcome and response to therapy among PLHIV. We sought to review the 
available literature referencing epigenetic markers to determine underlying 
biomechanism predisposing high-risk PLHIV to CVD, elucidating areas of possible 
intervention.

BACKGROUND: The prevalence of sarcopenia defined using the Asian Working Group 
for Sarcopenia (AWGS) criteria in Asian communities has not been fully 
addressed. Moreover, few studies have addressed the influence of sarcopenia on 
mortality.
METHODS: A total of 1,371 and 1,597 residents aged 65 years or older 
participated in health surveys in 2012 and 2017. Sarcopenia was determined using 
the AWGS definition. Factors associated with the presence of sarcopenia were 
assessed using a logistic regression model in participants in the 2012 survey. 
Subjects in the 2012 survey were followed-up prospectively for a median of 4.3 
years. Mortality risk for subjects with sarcopenia was examined using the Cox 
proportional hazards model.
RESULTS: The crude prevalence of sarcopenia was 7.4% and 6.6% in participants at 
the 2012 and 2017 surveys, respectively; there was no significant difference 
between surveys (P = 0.44). The prevalence of sarcopenia increased significantly 
with age in both sexes (both P for trend <0.001). Subjects with sarcopenia were 
more likely to exercise less regularly, to intake less total energy, and to 
exhibit a disability in activity of daily living than those without. The 
multivariable-adjusted hazard ratio for all-cause mortality was 2.20 (95% 
confidence interval, 1.25-3.85) in subjects with sarcopenia, compared to those 
without.
CONCLUSIONS: Approximately 7% of older subjects had sarcopenia in a 
community-dwelling older Japanese population. Moreover, subjects with sarcopenia 
had an increased mortality risk. Our findings suggest that a public health 
strategy for sarcopenia is needed to extend healthy life expectancy.

Life History Transitions at the Origins of Agriculture: A Model for 
Understanding How Niche Construction Impacts Human Growth, Demography and 
Health.

History, Jena, Germany.

Over recent millennia, human populations have regularly reconstructed their 
subsistence niches, changing both how they obtain food and the conditions in 
which they live. For example, over the last 12,000 years the vast majority of 
human populations shifted from foraging to practicing different forms of 
agriculture. The shift to farming is widely understood to have impacted several 
aspects of human demography and biology, including mortality risk, population 
growth, adult body size, and physical markers of health. However, these trends 
have not been integrated within an over-arching conceptual framework, and there 
is poor understanding of why populations tended to increase in population size 
during periods when markers of health deteriorated. Here, we offer a novel 
conceptual approach based on evolutionary life history theory. This theory 
assumes that energy availability is finite and must be allocated in competition 
between the functions of maintenance, growth, reproduction, and defence. In any 
given environment, and at any given stage during the life-course, natural 
selection favours energy allocation strategies that maximise fitness. We argue 
that the origins of agriculture involved profound transformations in human life 
history strategies, impacting both the availability of energy and the way that 
it was allocated between life history functions in the body. Although overall 
energy supply increased, the diet composition changed, while sedentary 
populations were challenged by new infectious burdens. We propose that this 
composite new ecological niche favoured increased energy allocation to defence 
(immune function) and reproduction, thus reducing the allocation to growth and 
maintenance. We review evidence in support of this hypothesis and highlight how 
further work could address both heterogeneity and specific aspects of the 
origins of agriculture in more detail. Our approach can be applied to many other 
transformations of the human subsistence niche, and can shed new light on the 
way that health, height, life expectancy, and fertility patterns are changing in 
association with globalization and nutrition transition.

Background: The objective benefits of low dose radiotherapy (LDRT) for 
non-malignant joint disorders are controversial. This study evaluated changes in 
pain, quality of life (QoL) and function after LDRT for epicondylitis, plantar 
fasciitis, and finger osteoarthritis. Materials and Methods: Patients over 40 
years old with epicondylitis, plantar fasciitis, and finger osteoarthritis were 
had pain following at least 6 months of conservative therapy. Patients received 
0.5 Gy LDRT twice weekly for 4 weeks repeated once after 8 weeks in patients who 
failed to achieve complete pain relief. Patients assessed their pain according 
to the visual analog scale. Handgrip strength was measured with an isometric 
dynamometer and the fast self-paced walking test was used in patients with 
plantar fasciitis. QoL was evaluated according to the EQ-5D and HAQ-DI 
questionnaires. Results: Outcomes for 157 patients (204 sites) were documented 
at 2, 6, and 12 months after last LDRT. Pain reduction at rest (p < 0.001), 
during activity (p < 0.001) and increase in handgrip strength (extension p < 
0.001, flexion p = 0.002) were highly significant for patients with lateral 
epicondylitis. Patients with medial epicondylitis reported pain relief at rest 
(p = 0.041) and during activity (p = 0.041) and significant increase in handgrip 
strength (p = 0.022). Patients with plantar fasciitis reported pain reduction at 
rest (p < 0.001), during activity (p < 0.001) and faster walking times (p < 
0.001). A trend toward improved QoL was observed. Patients with finger 
osteoarthritis reported significant pain relief during activity (p < 0.001) and 
a gain in handgrip strength (p = 0.004), with a trend to both pain relief at 
rest (p = 0.056) and stronger pinch grip (p = 0.099). Conclusions: LDRT achieved 
significant pain relief at rest and during activity and a corresponding 
objective improvement in handgrip strength in patients with epicondylitis. Pain 
relief at rest, during activity and improvement in walking time were 
demonstrated in patients with plantar fasciitis. LDRT achieved pain relief 
during activity, and handgrip strength was improved in patients with finger 
osteoarthritis. No significant effect was seen on quality of life measures for 
these conditions. The observed benefits were maintained 12 months after LDRT for 
all 3 indications and we recommend this low cost, safe intervention for patients 
over 40 who have failed prior conservative therapy.

BACKGROUND: Digestive tumours are among the leading causes of morbidity and 
mortality. Many cancer patients cannot maintain oral feeding and develop 
malnutrition. The authors aim to: review the endoscopic, radiologic and surgical 
techniques for nutritional support in cancer patients; address the strategies 
for nutritional intervention according to the selected technique; and establish 
a decision-making algorithm to define the best approach in a specific tumour 
setting.
SUMMARY: This is a narrative non-systematic review based on an electronic search 
through the medical literature using PubMed and UpToDate. The impossibility of 
maintaining oral feeding is a major cause of malnutrition in head and neck (H&N) 
cancer, oesophageal tumours and malignant gastric outlet obstruction. Tube 
feeding, endoscopic stents and gastrojejunostomy are the three main nutritional 
options. Nasal tubes are indicated for short-term enteral feeding. Percutaneous 
endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) is the gold standard when enteral nutrition is 
expected for more than 3-4 weeks, especially in H&N tumour and oesophageal 
cancer patients undergoing definite chemoradiotherapy. A gastropexy push system 
may be considered to avoid cancer seeding. Radiologic and surgical gastrostomy 
are alternatives when an endoscopic approach is not feasible. Postpyloric 
nutrition is indicated for patients intolerant to gastric feeding and may be 
achieved through nasoenteric tubes, PEG with jejunal extension, percutaneous 
endoscopic jejunostomy and surgical jejunostomy. Oesophageal and enteric stents 
are palliative techniques that allow oral feeding and improve quality of life. 
Surgical or EUS-guided gastrojejunostomy is recommended when enteric stents fail 
or prolonged survival is expected. Nutritional intervention is dependent on the 
technique chosen. Institutional protocols and decision algorithms should be 
developed on a multidisciplinary basis to optimize nutritional care.
CONCLUSIONS: Gastroenterologists play a central role in the nutritional support 
of cancer patients performing endoscopic techniques that maintain oral or 
enteral feeding. The selection of the most effective technique must consider the 
cancer type, the oncologic therapeutic program, nutritional aims and expected 
patient survival.

Publisher: INTRODUÇÃO: O cancro digestivo encontra-se entre as principais causas 
de morbilidade e mortalidade globais. Uma fração significativa de doentes 
oncológicos não consegue manter a via oral no decurso da doença e desenvolve 
desnutrição. Os autores pretendem: rever as técnicas endoscópicas, radiológicas 
e cirúrgicas de suporte nutricional em doentes com cancro; abordar as 
estratégias de intervenção nutricional tendo em conta a técnica escolhida; 
estabelecer algoritmos de decisão para definir a melhor abordagem técnica no 
contexto de neoplasias específicas.
SUMÁRIO: Revisão narrativa não sistemática, realizada através da pesquisa 
eletrónica na literatura médica com recurso à PubMed e UpToDate. A 
impossibilidade de manter a via oral é uma causa major de desnutrição em doentes 
com neoplasias cervicofaciais, cancro do esófago e tumores que condicionam 
obstrução do trato de saída gástrico. A alimentação por tubo (tube feeding), as 
próteses metálicas autoexpansíveis (PMAE) colocadas por via endoscópica e a 
gastrojejunostomia são as três principais abordagens para suporte nutricional. 
As sondas nasais estão indicadas para nutrição entérica de curta duração. A 
gastrostomia endoscópica percutânea (PEG) é a técnica gold-standard sempre que 
se antecipa a necessidade de nutrição entérica por um período superior a 3-4 
semanas, em particular nos doentes com neoplasias cervicofaciais e tumores do 
esófago com indicação para quimiorra-dioterapia definitiva. A utilização de um 
sistema push com gastropexia pode ser equacionada para evitar o risco de 
metastização no estoma. A gastrostomia radiológica e cirúrgica são alternativas 
válidas quando a abordagem endoscópica não é possível. A nutrição pós-pilórica 
está recomendada nos doentes intolerantes à alimentação intragástrica, podendo 
ser realizada através de sondas nasoentéricas, PEG com extensão jejunal, 
jejunostomia endoscópica percutânea ou jejunostomia cirúrgica. As PMAE 
esofágicas e entéricas estão indicadas para paliação, permitindo manter a via 
oral e melhorar a qualidade de vida. A gastrojejunostomia cirúrgica ou guiada 
por ecoendoscopia deve ser equacionada perante a falência técnica das próteses 
entéricas ou alternativamente quando uma sobrevida prolongada é expectável. As 
estratégias de intervenção nutricional dependem da técnica selecionada. 
Protocolos institucionais e algoritmos de decisão devem ser desenvolvidos em 
contexto multidisciplinar para otimizar os cuidados nutricionais prestados ao 
doente oncológico.
CONCLUSÕES: Os gastrenterologistas desempenham um papel central no suporte 
nutricional do doente oncológico com a realização de procedimentos endoscópios 
que permitem manter a via oral e/ou entérica. A seleção da técnica mais adequada 
deve ter em conta a neoplasia subjacente, a estratégia terapêutica, os objetivos 
nutricionais e a sobrevida esperada.

BACKGROUND: Digital biomarkers that measure physical activity and mobility are 
of great interest in the assessment of chronic diseases such as rheumatoid 
arthritis, as it provides insights on patients' quality of life that can be 
reliably compared across a whole population.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the feasibility of analyzing iPhone sensor data 
collected remotely by means of a mobile software application in order to derive 
meaningful information on functional ability in rheumatoid arthritis patients.
METHODS: Two objective, active tasks were made available to the study 
participants: a wrist joint motion test and a walk test, both performed remotely 
and without any medical supervision. During these tasks, gyroscope and 
accelerometer time-series data were captured. Processing schemes were developed 
using machine learning techniques such as logistic regression as well as 
explicitly programmed algorithms to assess data quality in both tasks. 
Motion-specific features including wrist joint range of motion (ROM) in 
flexion-extension (for the wrist motion test) and gait parameters (for the walk 
test) were extracted from high quality data and compared with subjective pain 
and mobility parameters, separately captured via the application.
RESULTS: Out of 646 wrist joint motion samples collected, 289 (45%) were high 
quality. Data collected for the walk test included 2,583 samples (through 867 
executions of the test) from which 651 (25%) were high quality. Further analysis 
of high-quality data highlighted links between reduced mobility and increased 
symptom severity. ANOVA testing showed statistically significant differences in 
wrist joint ROM between groups with light-moderate (220 participants) versus 
severe (36 participants) wrist pain (p < 0.001) as well as in average step times 
between groups with slight versus moderate problems walking about (p < 0.03).
CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrate the potential to capture and quantify 
meaningful objective clinical information remotely using iPhone sensors and 
represent an early step towards the development of patient-centric digital 
endpoints for clinical trials in rheumatoid arthritis.
