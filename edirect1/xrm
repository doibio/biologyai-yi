Oxford, UK. christine.kennedy@institute-of-health-sciences.oxford.ac.uk

The economic implications of regulations governing radon gas level 
identification and remediation in buildings are poorly understood, and attempts 
to address these issues have been criticised for lack of comparability. It is 
imperative therefore that a general model for the economic evaluation of radon 
remediation programmes is adopted to ensure comparability between studies and 
settings and to increase the usefulness of the results to decision makers. This 
paper presents general guidelines for the use of cost-effectiveness analysis 
(CEA) as an economic appraisal tool in the evaluation of radon reduction and 
prevention programmes. The data requirements for a CEA of radon remediation 
programmes concern both costs and outcomes. These components are discussed with 
respect to: programme objectives, comparator choice, perspective, time horizon, 
discounting, uncertainty, and final ratios. Adhering to clear guidelines 
concerning these aspects of evaluations will facilitate meaningful evaluation of 
radon remediation programmes. Finally, by evaluating the radon remediation 
programmes using methods applied to other health interventions (such as lung 
cancer prevention interventions), comparisons using the same metric can be made 
across policy areas.

Clinical significance and prognostic value of CA72-4 compared with CEA and 
CA19-9 in patients with gastric cancer.

France.

Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and CA 19-9 are both widely used in the follow up 
of patients with gastrointestinal cancer. More recently another tumor marker, 
named CA 72-4 has been identified and characterized using two different 
monoclonal antibodies B72.3 and CC49. Several reports evaluated CA 72-4 as a 
serum tumor marker for gastric cancer and compared its clinical utility with 
that of CEA or CA 19-9; few reports concerned its prognostic value. In the 
present study, CA 72-4 is evaluated and compared with CEA and CA 19-9 in various 
populations of patients with gastric cancer and benign disease; for 52 patients 
with gastric adenocarcinoma and 57 patients without neoplastic disease CEA, CA 
19-9 and CA 72-4 were evaluated before treatment. Sensitivity of the tumor 
markers CA 72-4, CA 19-9 and CEA at the recommended cut-off level in all 52 
patients were 58%, 50% the sensitivity increased to 75%. of these markers, for 
non metastatic patients, multivariate analyses indicated that none of the 
markers were significant, when adjusted for gender and age (which were 
indicators of poor prognosis); patients with abnormal values of CA72-4 tended to 
have shorter survival than patients with normal values (p<0.07). In the 
metastatic population, only high values of CA19-9 (p<0.02) and gender (women) 
p<0.03) were indicators of poor prognosis in univariate analysis; multivariate 
analysis revealed that both CA72-4 (p=0.034) and CA19-9 p=0.009), adjusted for 
gender were independent prognostic factors. However, CA72-4 lost significance 
(p=0.41) when adjusted for CA19-9 and gender, indicating that CA19-9 provides 
more prognostic information than CA72-4. When limited to the metastatic male 
population with normal values of CA 19-9 and CEA, CA 72-4 pretherapeutic 
positive levels were associated with a worse prognosis (p<0.005). In conclusion, 
this study suggests that the addition of CA 72-4 to CEA and/or CA 19-9 could 
improve sensitivity in gastric cancer. The prognostic role of this marker is not 
yet clearly demonstrated but its usefulness in the monitoring of gastric cancer 
should be taken into account.

Survival patterns in biliary atresia and comparison of quality of life of 
long-term survivors in Japan and England.

BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Portoenterostomy is an accepted method of achieving bile 
drainage in biliary atresia, but there is a paucity of data, including formal 
quality-of-life (QoL) studies, on long-term survivors. This report includes 
survival analysis and QoL studies from the world's largest series of cases 
treated in Japan (1951 to 1998). The Japanese QoL results are compared with a 
matched group of UK patients from King's College Hospital, London.
METHODS: One hundred fifteen Japanese surviving portoenterostomy patients were 
studied and comparison of trends in survival calculated from 6-year period 
cohorts. Liver function and hematologic status in a group of 30 long-term 
survivors (14 to 24 years) were compared with 25 patients from England, (14 to 
23 years). Twenty-five Japanese and 21 UK patients (SF-36) completed a QoL 
questionnaire.
RESULTS: Median survival times in Japanese patients before 1975 were less than 1 
year but increased to 18 years after 1975. Hematologic and liver function test 
results did not show any significant differences between the Japanese and UK 
patients. QoL studies in the UK patients showed no significant difference from 
normative, general population data. Japanese patients underperformed in general 
health (P = .01), role emotional (P = .05) and role physical (P = .07) but, 
overall, there was no significant difference between the Japanese and UK 
patients except for marginal differences in indices of general health and 
vitality (P = .06 and .04, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: Long-term survival rate in the Japanese patients increased 
dramatically from 1 year to 17 years after 1975. The QoL of survivors was 
comparable in Japan and England. The satisfactory comparison with normative 
population data suggests that we should continue to use portoenterostomy as the 
primary treatment for biliary atresia. J Pediatr Surg 36:892-897.

USA.

OBJECTIVES: Quality of life (QOL) issues are important for patients with 
prostate cancer because side effects from treatment are substantial, while the 
disease itself may be indolent. This article reviews prostate cancer QOL 
studies.
DATA SOURCES: Selected studies published on QOL in prostate cancer using 
validated patient-assessed tools from the last 5 years.
CONCLUSIONS: Prostate cancer treatments are associated with side effects: 
prostatectomy has more urinary and sexual side effects, while external radiation 
therapy has more bowel symptoms. Side effects are not highly correlated with 
overall QOL.
IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICE: Patients must be made aware of potential 
gains in life expectancy as well as side effects of treatments to make informed 
decisions about treatment.

On individual preferences and aggregation in economic evaluation in healthcare.

Liljas B(1), Lindgren B.

For practical reasons, in order to carry out economic evaluations of collective 
decisions, total costs will generally be compared with total benefits; hence, 
individuals' willingness to pay (WTP) or quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) 
have to be estimated at an aggregate level. So far, aggregation has usually been 
done by taking the individuals' mean WTP or the unweighted number of QALYs. 
Since the aggregation process is closely related to the way that income, health 
and/or utility of different individuals are compared and weighted, it also has 
significant equity implications. Thus. the explicit (or, more often, implicit) 
assumptions behind the aggregation process will largely affect how health and 
welfare are distributed is society. The aggregation problem in economic 
evaluation is certainly not trivial, but is seldom addressed in current 
practice. This paper shows the underlying assumptions of aggregate cost-benefit 
analysis (CBA) and cost-effectiveness analysis/cost-utility analysis (CEA/CUA), 
and it emphasises the particularly strong assumptions which have to be made when 
QALYs are interpreted as utilities in the welfare economics sense. Naturally, 
the appropriate method to choose depends on what is to be maximised: welfare or 
health. If decisions of resource allocation are to be based on economic welfare 
theory, then CBA should be preferred. However, if QALYs are interpreted as 
measures of health, rather than as utilities, then CEA/CUA would be appropriate.

Pharmacoeconomics of hypertension management: the place of combination therapy.

Pharmacological treatment of hypertension has been shown to reduce the risk of 
stroke, coronary events, heart failure and progression of renal disease. 
However, rates of successful blood pressure control remain low among treated 
patients while antihypertensive medication represents a large and increasing 
proportion of healthcare expenditure in many countries. Several influential 
pharmacoeconomic analyses have confirmed the cost effectiveness of conventional 
antihypertensive treatments, usually involving monotherapy with diuretics or 
beta-blockers, compared with alternative strategies. Recent research has shown 
that a considerable proportion of the total cost of antihypertensive treatment 
in general practice is due to factors such as inadequate blood pressure control, 
poor compliance with therapy, discontinuation and switching between therapies. 
These factors operate to a much lesser extent in well-conducted clinical trials, 
and have not been fully incorporated into most economic studies. Some novel 
strategies, particularly low dose combinations of antihypertensive agents, may 
offer advantages in terms of efficacy, reduced adverse effects and improved 
compliance with treatment. There is therefore a need for comprehensive 
pharmacoeconomic analyses of novel strategies, taking these additional factors 
into account. Until such studies are available, the wider use of low dose 
combination therapy and other novel strategies should not be held back on the 
basis of earlier economic studies that have not included all relevant 
considerations.

The cost of treatment of Alzheimer's disease in The Netherlands: a 
regression-based simulation model.

OBJECTIVE: To examine the potential economic impact of treatment of Alzheimer's 
disease.
DESIGN: Regression-based simulation estimation of the long term costs of 
Alzheimer's disease under a number of treatment scenarios. Data from an 
epidemiological study conducted in Rotterdam, The Netherlands, was used to 
simulate disease progression. Comparison of the costs and effectiveness 
experienced by the patients were used to measure the impact of treatment.
PATIENTS AND INTERVENTION: 2 theoretical cohorts of patients with Alzheimer's 
disease, one of which receives standard treatment, while the other receives a 
treatment which slows cognitive decline as measured by the Mini-Mental State 
Examination (MMSE).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES AND RESULTS: Under one of the scenarios examined, the 
baseline cost of Alzheimer's disease was 97,866 euro (EUR; 1996 values) per 
patient over 10 years' follow-up; the cost was almost EUR100,000 under all 
scenarios. Life expectancy following onset was about 4.5 years and MMSE decline 
was approximately 2 points per year for a typical prevalent (existing) patient 
and almost twice as much for incident (newly diagnosed) patients (1.82 vs 3.42 
points per year, respectively). Slowing the rate of cognitive decline results in 
a slightly increased life expectancy, with more time being spent at home and 
less in a nursing home. Total costs (excluding those of therapy) will decrease, 
but savings will be modest and may well be less than the cost of therapy. Under 
the same scenario, total savings were EUR1,571 per patient which corresponds to 
an annual break-even cost of just EUR453. Decisions regarding the initiation or 
termination of therapy will affect both the number of patients treated and the 
costs and potential savings of treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: The savings made in treating Alzheimer's disease will almost 
certainly be small in comparison with total costs and may well be offset by the 
cost of the treatment itself. Simulation models can be used to estimate the 
effect of therapy on the costs of care and can be useful tools in clinical 
decision-making and allocation of resources. These results show the need for 
further research into the costs and effects of treatment of Alzheimer's disease.

The pediatric neurologist as expert witness with particular reference to 
perinatal asphyxia.

Shevell MI(1).

Author information:

Canada.

The frequency of litigation related to alleged medical malpractice is increasing 
in Canada. For the neurologist, involvement in such litigation most often takes 
place in the context of acting as an expert witness and, for the pediatric 
neurologist, the most common clinical situation for which expertise is requested 
is that of possible perinatal asphyxia. The medical expert's primary role is to 
provide necessary guidance and assistance to the court, which may permit the 
rendering of decisions that are scientifically valid. This article will review 
the attributes of the medical expert witness. Aspects of perinatal asphyxia 
cases under litigation that commonly require the assistance of pediatric 
neurology expertise such as etiology, timing, extent of disability and life 
expectancy will also be reviewed in detail. The aim is to provide for the 
neurologist a clearer understanding of the responsibilities inherent in this 
increasing professional role.

In this commentary, the author reviews the impact of infectious diseases on 
women's health, beginning with the late 18th century when clinically recognized 
infections took the heaviest toll on women. The review continues through the 
19th and 20th centuries when public health measures and the advent of antibiotic 
agents led to apparent control of infection, and ends with a forecast for the 
next 25 years. Foreboding considerations for the future include spread of human 
immune deficiency virus infection and other sexually transmitted diseases and 
the development of new infections, antibiotic-resistant bacteria, and the 
recognition of infection as a cause of many obstetric-gynecologic and chronic 
disorders. Obstetricians and gynecologists can contribute to the solution of 
these problems individually and collectively.

Stinnett and Mullahy recently introduced the concept of net health benefit as an 
alternative to cost-effectiveness ratios for the statistical analysis of 
patient-level data on the costs and health effects of competing interventions. 
Net health benefit addresses a number of problems associated with 
cost-effectiveness ratios by assuming a value for the willingness-to-pay for a 
unit of effectiveness. We extend the concept of net health benefit to 
demonstrate that standard statistical procedures can be used for the analysis, 
power, and sample size determinations of cost-effectiveness data. We also show 
that by varying the value of the willingness-to-pay, the point estimate and 
confidence interval for the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio can be 
determined. An example is provided.

Gerald.Pierard@ulg.ac.be

BACKGROUND: The escalating ageing population in the western world has led to an 
increased incidence of superficial fungal infections. The most common infections 
include onychomycosis, tinea pedis and tinea cruris. With the increasing life 
expectancy, the prevalence of onychomycosis and other superficial fungal 
infections is likely to increase further without adequate prevention and 
treatment.
OBJECTIVE: To study the prevalence of foot mycoses in Europe.
METHOD: The Achilles project represents a survey of 90,085 subjects from 16 
European countries.
RESULTS: Approximately half of the total screened population had evidence of 
fungal foot infection, with tinea pedis and onychomycosis affecting one quarter 
of these individuals. Advancing age showed an unfavourable effect on the 
prevalence of these infections.
CONCLUSION: As the number of aged people in developed countries continues to 
increase, skin diseases will constitute a greater pharmaco-economic concern of 
worldwide healthcare. Better recognition by clinicians and patients of mycotic 
foot disease will help prevent direct morbidity and further complications.

[Specific concepts of care for pregnant women with drug addiction or HIV 
infection].

In the last 10 years about 130 women with a drug addiction and more than 100 
HIV-positive pregnant women were treated at the 1. University Hospital of 
Obstetrics and Gynaecology in Munich. Besides a specialized medical treatment 
both groups required intensive psychosocial care. HIV-infected people are still 
isolated and suffer from the social stigmata. Their essential needs for 
sexuality and children of their own are often ignored or even condemned because 
of irrational fears about HIV, which continue despite rapid medical 
improvements. The life-expectancy for example has increased since the 
inauguration of protease inhibitors. Vertical transmission of HIV is below 2% 
through medical treatment in pregnancy, elective cesarean section and 
renunciation of breastfeeding. Drug addicted pregnant women are given the 
opportunity to change their life in order to care for their children 
appropriately. The basis for this is a substitution with levomethadone and 
elimination of the use of other drugs. The addicted women often can reduce the 
dosage of levomethadone during the course of their pregnancy and sometimes can 
cease totally. Normally they are highly motivated and thus can ease the 
withdrawal symptoms of their newborns following delivery. By establishing a 
reliable social net during pregnancy mothers learn to recognize the demands of 
their children after birth and thus emotional and cognitive deficits can be 
prevented.

Randomized controlled trial of quadriceps training after proximal femoral 
fracture.

Mitchell SL(1), Stott DJ, Martin BJ, Grant SJ.

Author information:
(1)Academic Section of Geriatric Medicine, Glasgow Royal Infirmary, Scotland, 
UK.

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether systematic progressive high-intensity quadriceps 
training increases leg extensor power and reduces disability in patients 
rehabilitating after proximal femoral fracture.
DESIGN: Open parallel group randomized controlled trial comparing the addition 
of six weeks quadriceps training (40 patients) with standard physiotherapy alone 
(40 patients). The training group exercised twice weekly, with six sets of 12 
repetitions of knee extension (both legs), progressing up to 80% of their 
one-repetition maximum.
SETTING: Orthogeriatric unit, and community follow-up.
SUBJECTS: Eighty patients rehabilitating after proximal femoral fracture.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Measurements of leg extensor power (Nottingham Power 
Rig), functional mobility (elderly mobility score), disability (Barthel Index) 
and quality of life (Nottingham Health Profile) were made at baseline, after six 
weeks (at the end of the intervention) and at 16 weeks.
RESULTS: Leg extensor power increased significantly in the quadriceps training 
group (fractured leg mean improvement at six weeks 157% (standard error 16), 
nonfractured leg 80% (12)) compared with the control group (63% (11) and 26% (8) 
respectively, unpaired Student's t-test p = 0.007 and p = 0.01 for between-group 
comparisons). Significant benefits were maintained at 16 weeks. Quadriceps 
training resulted in a greater increase in elderly mobility scale score compared 
with standard rehabilitation (between-group difference of 2.5 (95% CI 1.1,3.8) 
at week 6 and 1.9 (0.4,3.4) at week 16). Barthel score increased significantly 
from week 0 to 6 in the quadriceps training group compared with controls 
(Mann-Whitney U-test p = 0.05). Patients in the quadriceps training group scored 
significantly better in the energy subscore of the Nottingham Health Profile at 
the end of follow-up (Mann-Whitney U-test p = 0.0185).
CONCLUSIONS: Progressive high-intensity quadriceps training in elderly proximal 
femoral fracture patients increased leg extensor power and reduced disability. 
This was accompanied by an increase in energy as measured by the Nottingham 
Health Profile. This intervention may provide a simple practical way of 
improving outcome in these patients.

St. Louis, Missouri 63110-1093, USA. wsumner@im.wustl.edu

BACKGROUND: Health outcome utility assessments generally assume procedural 
invariance. Preference reversals violating procedural invariance occur in 
economic scenarios when the assessment process shifts from a choice to a 
fill-in-the-blank task.
PURPOSE: To determine if similar reversals occur in utility assessments.
METHODS: One hundred thirty-six volunteer subjects completed 6 preference 
assessments of 4 personal health scenarios. Patients responded to otherwise 
identical tasks using either choice or fill-in-the-blank processes in a 
randomized crossover design. The authors determined the percentage of subjects 
preferring, or inferred to prefer, a given choice.
RESULTS: Preference reversals occurred in all assessment scenarios.
CONCLUSIONS: These preference reversals are a potential source of confusion for 
utility assessment and informed consent. They could be manipulated to achieve 
ends other than the best interest of patients. Anchoring or the prominence 
hypothesis may explain these findings.

Considerable uncertainty exists about the use of cancer screening tests in older 
people, as illustrated by the different age cutoffs recommended by various 
guideline panels. We suggest that a framework to guide individualized cancer 
screening decisions in older patients may be more useful to the practicing 
clinician than age guidelines. Like many medical decisions, cancer screening 
decisions require weighing quantitative information, such as risk of cancer 
death and likelihood of beneficial and adverse screening outcomes, as well as 
qualitative factors, such as individual patients' values and preferences. Our 
framework first anchors decisions through quantitative estimates of life 
expectancy, risk of cancer death, and screening outcomes based on published 
data. Potential benefits of screening are presented as the number needed to 
screen to prevent 1 cancer-specific death, based on the estimated life 
expectancy during which a patient will be screened. Estimates reveal substantial 
variability in the likelihood of benefit for patients of similar ages with 
varying life expectancies. In fact, patients with life expectancies of less than 
5 years are unlikely to derive any survival benefit from cancer screening. We 
also consider the likelihood of potential harm from screening according to 
patient factors and test characteristics. Some of the greatest harms of 
screening occur by detecting cancers that would never have become clinically 
significant. This becomes more likely as life expectancy decreases. Finally, 
since many cancer screening decisions in older adults cannot be answered solely 
by quantitative estimates of benefits and harms, considering the estimated 
outcomes according to the patient's own values and preferences is the final step 
for making informed screening decisions.

BACKGROUND: This study tested the hypothesis that childhood-onset schizophrenia 
(COS) is a variant of adult-onset schizophrenia (AOS) by determining if 
first-degree relatives of COS probands have an increased risk for schizophrenia 
and schizotypal and paranoid personality disorders.
METHODS: Relatives of COS probands (n = 148) were compared with relatives of 
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (n = 368) and community control 
(n = 206) probands. Age-appropriate structured diagnostic interviews were used 
to assign DSM-III-R diagnoses to probands and their relatives. Family 
psychiatric history was elicited from multiple informants. Diagnoses of 
relatives were made blind to information about probands' diagnoses. Final 
consensus diagnoses, which integrated family history, direct interview 
information, and medical records, are reported in this article.
RESULTS: There was an increased lifetime morbid risk for schizophrenia (4.95% 
+/- 2.16%) and schizotypal personality disorder (4.20% +/- 2.06%) in the parents 
of COS probands compared with parents of ADHD (0.45% +/- 0.45%, 0.91% +/- 0.63%) 
and community control (0%) probands. The parents of COS probands diagnosed as 
having schizophrenia had an early age of first onset of schizophrenia. Risk for 
avoidant personality disorder (9.41% +/- 3.17%) was increased in the parents of 
COS probands compared with parents of community controls (1.67% +/- 1.17%).
CONCLUSIONS: The psychiatric disorders that do and do not aggregate in the 
parents of COS probands are remarkably similar to the disorders that do and do 
not aggregate in the parents of adults with schizophrenia in modern family 
studies. These findings provide compelling support for the hypothesis of 
etiological continuity between COS and AOS.

Patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery and who have coronary artery disease run 
a high risk of myocardial infarct. Diagnosis and postoperative management is 
presently based on assessment of cardiac troponin I. Associated with optimal 
postoperatory management, several approaches can limit the occurrence of 
postoperatory coronary complications and improve the life expectancy of surgical 
patients with high cardiovascular risk. They include the possibility of 
preoperatory myocardial revascularisation and the prophylactic, postoperatory 
administration of cardiovascular medications (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory 
drugs, beta-blockers and alpha 2 receptor agonists).

BACKGROUND: Autograft aortic root replacement is an established therapeutic 
option for young adults with aortic valve disease. Unfortunately, most series 
are small with a limited follow-up. Meta-analysis and microsimulation modeling 
were used to predict long-term outcome based on currently available midterm 
data.
METHODS: We combined our center's experience with autograft aortic root 
replacement in 85 adult patients in a meta-analysis with reported results of 
three other hospitals. The outcomes of this meta-analysis were entered in a 
microsimulation model, calculating (event-free) life expectancy after autograft 
aortic root replacement.
RESULTS: The pooled results comprised 380 patients with a total follow-up of 
1,077 patient-years. Mean age was 37 years (range 16 to 68 years). Male/female 
ratio was 2.7. Operative mortality was 2.6% (n = 10); during follow-up 6 more 
patients died. Linearized annual risk estimates were 0.5% for thromboembolism, 
0.3% for endocarditis, and 0.4% for nonstructural valve failure. Structural 
autograft failure requiring reoperation occurred in 5 patients, and a Weibull 
function was constructed accordingly. Using this information, the 
microsimulation model predicted age- and gender-specific mean, reoperation-free, 
and event-free life expectancy.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on current evidence the calculated average autograft-related 
reoperation-free life expectancy is 16 years. The combination of meta-analysis 
and microsimulation provides a promising and powerful tool for estimating 
long-term outcome after aortic valve replacement.

Sickle cell anemia (SCA) is an inherited disorder of beta-globin, resulting in 
red blood cell rigidity, anemia, painful crises, organ infarctions, and reduced 
life expectancy. Allogeneic blood or marrow transplantation (BMT) can cure SCA 
but is associated with an 8% to 10% mortality rate, primarily from complications 
of marrow-ablative conditioning. Transplantation of allogeneic marrow after less 
intensive conditioning reduces toxicity but may result in stable mixed 
hematopoietic chimerism. The few SCA patients who inadvertently developed mixed 
chimerism after BMT remain symptom free, suggesting that mixed chimerism can 
reduce disease-related morbidity. However, because the effects of various levels 
of mixed chimerism on organ pathology have not been characterized, this study 
examined the histologic effects of an increasing percentage of normal donor 
hematopoiesis in a mouse model of BMT for SCA. In lethally irradiated normal 
mice that were reconstituted with varying ratios of T-cell-depleted marrow from 
normal and transgenic "sickle cell" mice, normal myeloid chimerism in excess of 
25% was associated with more than 90% normal hemoglobin (Hb). However, 70% 
normal myeloid chimerism was required to reverse the anemia. Organ pathology, 
including liver infarction, was present in mice with sickle Hb (HbS) levels as 
low as 16.8% (19.6% normal myeloid chimerism). Histologic abnormalities 
increased in severity up to 80% HbS, but were less severe in mice with more than 
80% HbS than in those with 40% to 80% HbS. Therefore, stable mixed chimerism 
resulting from nonmyeloablative BMT may reduce the morbidity from SCA, but 
prevention of all disease complications may require minimizing the fraction of 
circulating sickle red cells. (Blood. 2001;97:3960-3965)

Selenium metabolism in Drosophila: selenoproteins, selenoprotein mRNA 
expression, fertility, and mortality.

Selenocysteine is a rare amino acid in protein that is encoded by UGA with the 
requirement of a downstream mRNA stem-loop structure, the selenocysteine 
insertion sequence element. To detect selenoproteins in Drosophila, the entire 
genome was analyzed with a novel program that searches for selenocysteine 
insertion sequence elements, followed by selenoprotein gene signature analyses. 
This computational screen and subsequent metabolic labeling with (75)Se and 
characterization of selenoprotein mRNA expression resulted in identification of 
three selenoproteins: selenophosphate synthetase 2 and novel G-rich and BthD 
selenoproteins that had no homology to known proteins. To assess a biological 
role for these proteins, a simple chemically defined medium that supports growth 
of adult Drosophila and requires selenium supplementation for optimal survival 
was devised. Flies survived on this medium supplemented with 10(-8) to 10(-6) m 
selenium or on the commonly used yeast-based complete medium at about twice the 
rate as those on a medium without selenium or with >10(-6) m selenium. This 
effect correlated with changes in selenoprotein mRNA expression. The number of 
eggs laid by Drosophila was reduced approximately in half in the chemically 
defined medium compared with the same medium supplemented with selenium. The 
data provide evidence that dietary selenium deficiency shortens, while 
supplementation of the diet with selenium normalizes the Drosophila life span by 
a process that may involve the newly identified selenoproteins.

Diabetic vitrectomy has been found to be efficacious for the treatment of 
vitreous hemorrhage secondary to diabetic retinopathy. The purpose of this study 
is to determine the cost-effectiveness of early vitrectomy for the management of 
vitreous hemorrhage secondary to diabetic retinopathy. The analysis was 
performed from the perspective of a third-party insurer. A cost-utility Markov 
model was used to determine the cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) 
gained from early versus deferral of vitrectomy. The model used 2-, 3-, and 
4-year results from the Diabetic Retinopathy Vitrectomy Study, patient-based 
utilities, life expectancy data, and incremental medical costs. Early vitrectomy 
was the dominant strategy and was associated with a gain of 0.41 QALYs over the 
57-year expected life span for a hypothetical patient. The cost per additional 
QALY gained from early vitrectomy treatment was $1910 (US$ discounted at 3%). 
When sensitivity analyses were performed by varying efficacy probabilities and 
utilities across their 95% confidence intervals, early treatment was always the 
dominant strategy. Additionally, even at the extreme sensitivity values, the 
cost per QALY of early vitrectomy treatment remained under $10,000. Overall, 
early vitrectomy for the treatment of vitreous hemorrhage secondary to diabetic 
retinopathy is highly cost-effective.

STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective study was performed, using the Short Form-36 
Health Survey and the Roland and Morris Disability Questionnaire, to investigate 
patient outcomes after fusion for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis using 
Harrington rod instrumentation.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate health-related quality of life and low back pain in a 
long-term follow-up study of surgery for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The commonly accepted surgical treatment for 
idiopathic evolutive scoliosis is vertebral fusion. It has been suggested that 
this procedure may cause low back pain and a poor quality of life over the long 
term. Outcome measures after surgery for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis have 
focused mainly on objective parameters such as radiographic measures. However, 
this information has proved to be correlated only weakly with outcomes that are 
more relevant to patients, such as functional status and symptoms. Until 
recently, only a few long-term outcome studies have used standardized and 
validated patient-oriented tools to evaluate surgically treated patients with 
scoliosis.
METHODS: In this study, 70 patients treated with a standard Harrington technique 
were recontacted and evaluated by means of self-administered questionnaires 
(Short Form-36 Health Survey and Roland and Morris Disability, clinical 
examination, and radiographic analysis. Preoperative and follow-up radiographic 
findings were registered. Relations between radiographic and patient-oriented 
data were evaluated.
RESULTS: A comparison between the current sample and the Italian age-matched 
normative data for the Short Form-36 Health Survey showed them to have a similar 
pattern. Findings showed the patient-oriented outcome to be correlated inversely 
with the extension of vertebral fusion and the preoperative Cobb angle.
CONCLUSION: Long-term follow-up evaluation of Harrington rod fusion for 
adolescent idiopathic scoliosis showed no important impairment of health-related 
quality of life, as measured by patient-oriented evaluation.

Differential 'fuel usage' has been proposed as a mechanism for life-span 
extension by caloric restriction (CR). Here, we report the effects of CR, 
initiated after weaning, on metabolic enzyme gene expression 0, 1.5, 5, and 12 h 
after feeding of 24-month-old mice. Plasma glucose and insulin were reduced by 
approximately 20 and 80%. Therefore, apparent insulin sensitivity, as judged by 
the glucose to insulin ratio, increased 3.3-fold in CR mice. Phosphoenolpyruvate 
carboxykinase mRNA and activity were transiently reduced 1.5 h after feeding, 
but were 20-100% higher in CR mice at other times. Glucose-6-phosphatase mRNA 
was induced in CR mice and repressed in control mice before, and for 5 h 
following feeding. Feeding transiently induced glucokinase mRNA fourfold in 
control mice, but only slightly in CR mice. Pyruvate kinase and pyruvate 
dehydrogenase activities were reduced approximately 50% in CR mice at most 
times. Feeding induced glutaminase mRNA, and carbamyl phosphate synthetase I and 
glutamine synthase activity (and mRNA). They were each approximately twofold or 
higher in CR mice. These results indicate that in mice, CR maintains higher 
rates of gluconeogenesis and protein catabolism, even in the hours after 
feeding. The data are consistent with the idea that CR continuously promotes the 
turnover and replacement of extrahepatic proteins.

Potential cost-effectiveness of one-time screening for lung cancer (LC) in a 
high risk cohort.

The development of low-dose helical computed-tomography (CT) scanning to detect 
nodules as small as a few mm has sparked renewed interest in lung cancer (LC) 
screening. The objective of this study was to assess the potential health 
effects and cost-effectiveness of a one-time low-dose helical CT scan to screen 
for LC. We created a decision analysis model using baseline results from the 
Early Lung Cancer Action Project (ELCAP); Surveillance, Epidemiology and End 
Results (SEER) registry public-use database; screening program costs estimated 
from 1999 Medicare reimbursement rates; and annual costs of managing cancer and 
non-cancer patients from Riley et al. (1995) [Med Care 1995;33(8):828-841] and 
Taplin et al. (1995) [J Natl Cancer Inst 1995;87(6):417-26]. The main outcome 
measures included years of life, cost estimates of baseline diagnostic screening 
and follow up, and cost-effectiveness of screening. We found that in a very 
high-risk cohort (LC prevalence of 2.7%) of patients between 60 and 74 years of 
age, a one-time screen appears to be cost-effective at $5940 per life year 
saved. In a lower risk general population of smokers (LC prevalence of 0.7%), a 
one-time screen appears to be cost-effective at $23100 per life year. Even when 
a lead-time bias of 1 year is incorporated into the model for a low risk 
population, the cost-effectiveness is estimated at $58183 per life year. Based 
on the assumptions embedded in this model, one-time screening of elderly 
high-risk patients for LC appears to be cost-effective.

10021, USA. schrag@mskcc.org

BACKGROUND: Randomized trials have established that 5-fluorouracil-based 
adjuvant chemotherapy following resection of stage III colon cancer reduces 
subsequent mortality by as much as 30%. However, the extent to which adjuvant 
therapy is used outside the clinical trial setting, particularly among the 
elderly, is unknown.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort study utilizing the Surveillance, Epidemiology, 
and End Results/Medicare-linked database identified 6262 patients aged 65 years 
and older with resected stage III colon cancer. The primary outcome was 
chemotherapy use within 3 months of surgery, as ascertained from Medicare 
claims. We examined the extent to which age at diagnosis was associated with 
adjuvant chemotherapy usage, and we adjusted for potential confounding based on 
differences in other patient characteristics with the use of multiple logistic 
regression. All P values were two-sided.
RESULTS: Age at diagnosis was the strongest determinant of chemotherapy: 78% of 
patients aged 65-69 years, 74% of those aged 70-74 years, 58% of those aged 
75-79 years, 34% of those aged 80-84 years, and 11% of those aged 85-89 years 
received postoperative chemotherapy. The age trend remained pronounced after 
adjustment for potential confounding based on variation in patients' demographic 
and clinical characteristics and after exclusion of patients with any evident 
comorbidity (all P values <.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Adjuvant chemotherapy for stage III colon cancer is used 
extensively, especially for patients under the age of 75 years. However, 
treatment rates decline dramatically with chronologic age. Because patients in 
their 70s and even 80s have a reasonable life expectancy, further efforts are 
needed to ensure that elderly patients have the opportunity to make informed 
decisions regarding this potentially curative treatment.
