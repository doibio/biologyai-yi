(76.2%) significant PCa with 2 false positives (6.5%). The detection rate for 
significant PCa was equal to 76.2% (mpMRI/TRUS fusion biopsy) vs 81% (extended) 
vs 100% (SPBx) (p = 0.001); mpMRI/TRUS targeted biopsy and extended biopsy 
missed 5/21 (23.8%) and 4/21 (19%) significant PCa which were found by SPBx (p = 
0.001) being characterised by the presence of a single positive core of GS ≥ 7 
with GPC &lt; 10%.
CONCLUSIONS: Although mpMRI improve the diagnosis of clinically significant PCa, 
SPBx is provided of the best detection rate for PCa in men enrolled in AS 
protocols who underwent confirmatory biopsy.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The risk factors associated to long-term survival were 
assessed in patients with liver metastases of colorectal carcinoma undergoing 
ablative therapies.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Single-centre cohort study, retrospectively analysed and 
prospectively collected consecutive patients with unresectable metastatic liver 
disease of colorectal carcinoma treated with ablative therapies between 1996 and 
2013. Factors associated with survival time were identified using Cox's 
proportional hazard model with time-dependent covariates. A forward variable 
selection based on Akaike information criterion was performed. Relative risk and 
95% confidence intervals for each factor were calculated. Statistical 
significance was set as P<.05.
RESULTS: Seventy-five patients with liver metastases of colorectal cancer, with 
a mean age of 65.6 (10.3) underwent 106 treatments. Variables selected were good 
quality of life (RR 0.308, 95% CI 0.150-0.632) and tumour extension (RR 3.070, 
95% CI 1.776-5.308). The median overall survival was 18.5 months (95% CI 
17.4-24.4). The survival prognosis in median was 13.5 vs. 23.4 months for 
patients with and without tumour extension, and 23.0 vs. 12.8 months for 
patients with good and fair or poor quality of life, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Good quality of life and tumour extension were the only 
statistically significant predictors of long-term survival in patients of 
colorectal carcinoma with liver metastatic disease undergoing ablative treatment 
with ultrasound.

Wales, Australia.

South Wales, Australia.

OBJECTIVES: Despite being one of the healthiest countries in the world, 
Australia displays substantial mortality differentials by socioeconomic 
disadvantage, remoteness and sex. In this study, we examined how these mortality 
differentials translated to differences in life expectancy between 2001 and 
2012.
DESIGN AND SETTING: Population-based study using mortality and estimated 
residential population data from Australia's largest state, New South Wales 
(NSW), between 2001 and 2012. Age-group-specific death rates by socioeconomic 
disadvantage quintile, remoteness (major cities vs regional and remote areas), 
sex and year were estimated via Poisson regression, and inputted into life table 
calculations to estimate life expectancy.
RESULTS: Life expectancy decreased with increasing socioeconomic disadvantage in 
males and females. The disparity between the most and least socioeconomically 
deprived quintiles was 3.77 years in males and 2.39 years in females in 2012. 
Differences in life expectancy by socioeconomic disadvantage were mostly stable 
over time. Gender gaps in life expectancy ranged from 3.50 to 4.93 years (in 
2012), increased with increasing socioeconomic disadvantage and decreased by 
∼1 year for all quintiles between 2001 and 2012. Overall, life expectancy varied 
little by remoteness, but was 1.8 years higher in major cities compared to 
regional/remote areas in the most socioeconomically deprived regions in 2012.
CONCLUSIONS: Socioeconomic disadvantage and sex were strongly associated with 
life expectancy. The disparity in life expectancy across the socioeconomic 
spectrum was larger in males and was stable over time. In contrast, gender gaps 
reduced for all quintiles between 2001 and 2012, and a remoteness effect was 
evident in 2012, but only for those living in the most deprived areas.

BACKGROUND: There are several reports describing an increase in anterior pelvic 
tilt after hamstring lengthening in children with cerebral palsy (CP). Distal 
femoral extension and shortening osteotomy (DFESO) is an alternative treatment 
for correction of flexed knee gait, but investigations analyzing outcome and 
influence on adjacent joint are few in the literature. The purpose of this study 
was to analyze the influence of DFESO on knee and pelvis in children with CP. 
Furthermore, it was of interest if an additional patellar tendon advancement 
(PA) influences outcome.
METHODS: In this retrospective study, 31 limbs of 22 children (GMFCS I-III; mean 
age: 12.1±3.1 years), who received DFESO were included and kinematic parameters 
(knee, pelvis) measured by 3-D-gait analysis were compared before and at least 1 
year after surgery (mean follow-up period: 15.6 months).
RESULTS: After surgery, during stance phase minimum knee flexion improved 
significantly by 20.5° (P<0.001) and mean anterior pelvic tilt increased by 4.0 
degrees (P=0.045). In 16 limbs, the postoperative increase in maximum anterior 
pelvic tilt was more than 5°. Limbs who received an additional PA showed the 
biggest increase in anterior pelvic tilt.
CONCLUSIONS: DFESO is an effective method for correction of flexed knee gait in 
children with CP. Furthermore, the results of this study indicate that DFESO may 
lead to an increase in anterior pelvic tilt, which may lead to a recurrence of 
flexed knee gait. In this context, PA seemed to aggravate the effect on the 
pelvis.

trends in quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE) by educational level'. 
Afgedrukt met toestemming.

OBJECTIVE: Quantifying trends in quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE) by 
level of education in the Netherlands 2001-2011.
DESIGN: Retrospective study.
METHOD: For this study we used data from several sources. Using regression 
models we estimated mortality rates and quality of life as functions of age, 
gender, calendar year and educational level. Quality of life was measured using 
the SF-6D questionnaire. In order to calculate QALE we combined estimates of 
mortality rates and quality of life into Sullivan's life tables.
RESULTS: Over the period 2001-2011 quality of life and survival increased at all 
educational levels. This resulted in an increase of QALE varying from 1.5 to 3 
years depending on gender and education. QALE increased less strongly in people 
with lower education than in those with higher education, which to a large 
extent was due to widening inequalities in mortality.
CONCLUSION: The Dutch are living longer and have a better quality of life but 
inequalities in QALE have increased.

The objective of the present study was to evaluate the impact of rosemary and 
basil essential oils (EOs) on the quality of Atlantic mackerel fillets stored at 
2°C up to 15 days. Atlantic mackerel (Scomber scombrus) fillets were 
periodically evaluated to assess their textural, color, physicochemical, and 
spectral characteristics. The results indicated that rosemary and basil 
treatments were effective for inhibiting the formation of total volatile basic 
nitrogen (TVB-N) and lipid oxidation products during storage. Based on TVB-N 
values, the shelf life of Atlantic mackerel fillets treated with rosemary and 
basil EOs was extended by 2 and 5 days, respectively, compared to the control 
group. Similar results were obtained with thiobarbituric acid-reactive substance 
analysis, which demonstrated an extended shelf life of Atlantic mackerel 
immersed with rosemary and basil EOs of 2 and 3 days, respectively, compared to 
the control group. The factorial discriminant analysis applied on the 
concatenated first five principal components corresponding to the 
physicochemical, textural, color, and fluorescence measurements allowed clear 
discrimination of the three groups, because a correct classification rate of 
93.3% was obtained. Therefore, treatment with basil and rosemary EOs, as natural 
biopreservative compounds, could present a high-potential application in the 
seafood industry.

Cervical cancer (CC) is the second leading cause of cancer death among Filipino 
women. Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination protects against CC. Two vaccines 
(AS04-HPV-16/18 and 4vHPV) are approved in the Philippines; they were originally 
developed for a 3-dose (3D) administration and have recently been approved in a 
2-dose schedule (2D). This study aims to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of HPV 
vaccination of 13-year-old Filipino girls, in addition to current screening, in 
the new 2D schedule. An existing static lifetime, one-year cycle Markov cohort 
model was adapted to the Philippine settings to simulate the natural history of 
low-risk and oncogenic HPV infection, the effects of screening and vaccination 
of a 13-year-old girls cohort vaccinated with either the 2D-AS04-HPV-16/18 or 
2D-4vHPV assuming a 100% vaccination coverage. Incremental cost, 
quality-adjusted life year (QALY) and cost-effectiveness were derived from these 
estimates. Input data were obtained from published sources and Delphi panel, 
using country-specific data where possible. Sensitivity analyses were performed 
to assess the robustness of the model. The model estimated that 
2D-AS04-HPV-16/18 prevented 986 additional CC cases and 399 CC deaths 
(undiscounted), as well as 555 increased QALY (discounted), and save 
228.1 million Philippine pesos (PHP) compared with the 2D-4vHPV. In conclusion, 
AS04-HPV-16/18 is shown to be dominant over 4vHPV in the Philippines, with 
greater estimated health benefits and lower costs.

The increased life expectancy and the expansion of the elderly population are 
stimulating research into aging. Aging may be viewed as a multifactorial process 
that results from the interaction of genetic and environmental factors, which 
include lifestyle. Human molecular processes are influenced by physiological 
pathways as well as exogenous factors, which include the diet. Dietary 
components have substantive effects on metabolic health; for instance, bioactive 
molecules capable of selectively modulating specific metabolic pathways affect 
the development/progression of cardiovascular and neoplastic disease. As 
bioactive nutrients are increasingly identified, their clinical and molecular 
chemopreventive effects are being characterized and systematic analyses 
encompassing the "omics" technologies (transcriptomics, proteomics and 
metabolomics) are being conducted to explore their action. The evolving field of 
molecular pathological epidemiology has unique strength to investigate the 
effects of dietary and lifestyle exposure on clinical outcomes. The mounting 
body of knowledge regarding diet-related health status and disease risk is 
expected to lead in the near future to the development of improved diagnostic 
procedures and therapeutic strategies targeting processes relevant to nutrition. 
The state of the art of aging and nutrigenomics research and the molecular 
mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of bioactive nutrients on the main 
aging-related disorders are reviewed herein.

OBJECTIVE: Induction of labour at 39 weeks for nulliparous women aged 35 years 
and over may prevent stillbirths and does not increase caesarean births, so it 
may be popular. But the overall costs and benefits of such a policy have not 
been compared.
DESIGN: A cost-utility analysis alongside a randomised controlled trial (the 
35/39 trial).
SETTING: Obstetric departments of 38 UK National Health Service hospitals and 
one UK primary-care trust.
POPULATION: Nulliparous women aged 35 years or over on their expected due date, 
with a singleton live fetus in a cephalic presentation.
METHODS: Costs were estimated from the National Health Service and Personal 
Social Services perspective and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were 
calculated based on patient responses to the EQ-5D at baseline and 4 weeks.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Data on antenatal care, mode of delivery, analgesia in 
labour, method of induction, EQ-5D (baseline and 4 weeks postnatal) and 
participant-administered postnatal health resource use data were collected.
RESULTS: The intervention was associated with a mean cost saving of £263 and a 
small additional gain in QALYs (though this was not statistically significant), 
even without considering any possible QALY gains from stillbirth prevention.
CONCLUSION: A policy of induction of labour at 39 weeks for women of advanced 
maternal age would save money.
TWEETABLE ABSTRACT: A policy of induction of labour at 39 weeks of gestation for 
women of advanced maternal age would save money.

AIMS: To develop a cost-effectiveness model to compare Type 2 diabetes 
prevention programmes targeting different at-risk population subgroups with a 
lifestyle intervention of varying intensity.
METHODS: An individual patient simulation model was constructed to simulate the 
development of diabetes in a representative sample of adults without diabetes 
from the UK population. The model incorporates trajectories for HbA1c , 2-h 
glucose, fasting plasma glucose, BMI, systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol 
and HDL cholesterol. Patients can be diagnosed with diabetes, cardiovascular 
disease, microvascular complications of diabetes, cancer, osteoarthritis and 
depression, or can die. The model collects costs and utilities over a lifetime 
horizon. The perspective is the UK National Health Service and personal social 
services. We used the model to evaluate the population-wide impact of targeting 
a lifestyle intervention of varying intensity to six population subgroups 
defined as high risk for diabetes.
RESULTS: The intervention produces 0.0003 to 0.0009 incremental quality-adjusted 
life years and saves up to £1.04 per person in the general population, depending 
upon the subgroup targeted. Cost-effectiveness increases with intervention 
intensity. The most cost-effective options are to target individuals with HbA1c 
> 42 mmol/mol (6%) or with a high Finnish Diabetes Risk (FINDRISC) probability 
score (> 0.1).
CONCLUSION: The model indicates that diabetes prevention interventions are 
likely to be cost-effective and may be cost-saving over a lifetime. In the 
model, the criteria for selecting at-risk individuals differentially impact upon 
diabetes and cardiovascular disease outcomes, and on the timing of benefits. 
These findings have implications for deciding who should be targeted for 
diabetes prevention interventions.

Low-income households may be disproportionately affected by ozone pollution and 
ozone policy. We quantify how three factors affect the relative benefits of 
ozone policies with household income: (1) unequal ozone reductions; (2) policy 
delay; and (3) economic valuation methods. We model ozone concentrations under 
baseline and policy conditions across the full continental United States to 
estimate the distribution of ozone-related health impacts across nine income 
groups. We enhance an economic model to include these impacts across household 
income categories, and present its first application to evaluate the benefits of 
ozone reductions for low-income households. We find that mortality incidence 
rates decrease with increasing income. Modeled ozone levels yield a median of 11 
deaths per 100 000 people in 2005. Proposed policy reduces these rates by 13%. 
Ozone reductions are highest among low-income households, which increases their 
relative welfare gains by up to 4% and decreases them for the rich by up to 8%. 
The median value of reductions in 2015 is either $30 billion (in 2006 U.S. 
dollars) or $1 billion if reduced mortality risks are valued with 
willingness-to-pay or as income from increased life expectancy. Ozone reductions 
were relatively twice as beneficial for the lowest- compared to the 
highest-income households. The valuation approach affected benefits more than a 
policy delay or differential ozone reductions with income.

Uropathogenic E. coli exploit PapG-II adhesin for infecting host cells of the 
kidney; the expression of PapG-II at the tip of bacterial pili correlates with 
the onset of pyelonephritis in humans, a potentially life-threatening condition. 
It was envisaged that blocking PapG-II (and thus bacterial adhesion) would 
provide a viable therapeutic alternative to conventional antibiotic treatment. 
In our search for potent PapG-II antagonists, we observed an increase in 
affinity when tetrasaccharide 1, the natural ligand of PapG-II in human kidneys, 
was elongated to hexasaccharide 2, even though the additional Siaα(2-3)Gal 
extension is not in direct contact with the lectin. ITC studies suggest that the 
increased affinity results from partial desolvation of nonbinding regions of the 
hexasaccharide; this is ultimately responsible for perturbation of the outer 
hydration layers. Our results are in agreement with previous observations and 
suggest a general mechanism for modulating carbohydrate-protein interactions 
based on nonbinding regions of the ligand.

Gender bias and sex-based differences in health care efficiency in Polish 
regions.

BACKGROUND: Health differences between sexes are relatively well recognized, 
though less is known about the specificity of women's and men's health 
responsiveness to medical care. Applying data from Polish regions, this study 
identifies sex-based differences in medical care efficiency and investigates the 
reasons for these disparities in the gender bias context.
METHODS: The study estimates sex-specific health production functions for 
regional data from Poland (1999-2013). Using panel-data regression, male and 
female life expectancies at ages 0, 15, 30, 45, 60 and 65 are regressed on a set 
of socioeconomic factors, with the primary interest in medical care proxied by 
doctor density.
RESULTS: The results show that in Poland the association between life expectancy 
and doctor density was positive for both men and women; however, the 
coefficients for medical care were insignificant for those at birth and at the 
age of 30 for both sexes. The magnitude of health care for longevity was higher 
for men comparing to women at every age, though the difference between sexes was 
not statistically significant. The sex-based disparities in medical care 
efficiency were more pronounced at younger ages and they diminished with age. 
The inspection of data on the health system in Poland shows that male patients 
seemed to be in an advantageous position: the mean reimbursement per service for 
men was higher in most medical care areas; men reported less problems with 
access to health care; and their mortality trend exhibited more favorable 
evolution over time. Additionally, the association between other socioeconomic 
factors and health also differed across sexes, and several of these factors were 
more important for life expectancy than health care.
CONCLUSION: Polish medical care suffers from gender bias, which possibly makes 
men more responsive to medical care. The disparities in the operation of medical 
care in Poland should be challenged to achieve more equal access to services 
between sexes and possibly to gain more health from the treatment of female 
patients.

BACKGROUND: Quality-adjusted life years (QALY) is a single value index that 
quantifies the overall burden of disease. It reflects all aspects of heath, 
including nonfatal illness and mortality outcomes by weighting life-years lived 
with health-related quality of life (HRQOL) scores. This study examine the 
burden of disease due to increasing levels of depressive symptoms by examining 
the association between the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) scores 
and QALY for U.S. adults aged 65 years and older.
METHODS: We ascertained respondents' HRQOL scores and mortality status from the 
2005-2006, 2007-2008, and 2009-2010 cohorts of the National Health and Nutrition 
Examination Survey (NHANES) with mortality follow-up data through December 31, 
2011. This analysis included respondents aged 65 years and older (n = 3,680). We 
estimated the mean QALY throughout the remaining lifetime according to 
participants' depression severity categories: none or minimal (PHQ-9 score 0-4), 
mild (5-9), moderate (10-14), and moderately severs and severe (15 or higher). 
We estimated QALY loss due to major depressive disorder (PHQ-9 score 10 or 
higher) and to mild depression (5-9).
RESULTS: The QALY for persons with none/minimal, mild, moderate, and moderately 
severe/severe depression were 14.0, 7.8, 4.7, and 3.3 years, respectively. 
Compared to persons without major depressive disorder, persons with major 
depressive disorder had 8.3 fewer QALY (12.7 vs. 4.4), or a 65% loss. Compared 
to persons who reported "none" or minimal depressive symptoms, persons who 
reported mild depressive symptoms had 6.2 fewer QALY (14.0 vs. 7.8), or a 44% 
loss. The same patterns were noted in demographic and socioeconomic subgroups 
and according to number of comorbidities.
CONCLUSIONS: This study not only confirmed the significant burden of disease for 
major depressive disorder among the U.S. elderly, but also showed an incremental 
decrease in QALY with an increasing severity of depressive symptoms as well as 
significant QALY loss due to mild depression. Specifically, individuals with 
higher (or more impaired) PHQ-9 scores had significantly fewer QALYs and our 
findings of fewer years of QALY for persons with major depressive disorder and 
mild depression were not only statistically significant but also clinically 
important.

Large body size of ectothermic species can be correlated with high life 
expectancy. We assessed the longevity of the World's largest chameleon, the 
Parson's chameleon Calumma parsonii from Madagascar by using skeletochronology 
of phalanges taken from preserved specimens held in European natural history 
museums. Due to the high bone resorption we can provide only the minimum age of 
each specimen. The highest minimum age detected was nine years for a male and 
eight years for a female, confirming that this species is considerably long 
living among chameleons. Our data also show a strong correlation between 
snout-vent length and estimated age.

OBJECTIVE: There is an international trend towards recommending medication to 
prevent cardiovascular disease (CVD) in individuals at increasingly lower 
cardiovascular risk. We assessed the cost-effectiveness of a population approach 
with a polypill including a statin (simvastatin 20 mg) and three 
antihypertensive agents (amlodipine 2.5 mg, losartan 25 mg and 
hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg) and periodic risk assessment with different risk 
thresholds.
METHODS: We developed a microsimulation model for lifetime predictions of CVD 
events, diabetes, and death in 259 146 asymptomatic UK Biobank participants aged 
40-69 years. We assessed incremental costs and quality-adjusted life-years 
(QALYs) for polypill scenarios with the same combination of agents and doses but 
differing for starting age, and periodic risk assessment with 10-year CVD risk 
thresholds of 10% and 20%.
RESULTS: Restrictive risk assessment, in which statins and antihypertensives 
were prescribed when risk exceeded 20%, was the optimal strategy gaining 123 
QALYs (95% credible interval (CI) -173 to 387) per 10 000 individuals at an 
extra cost of £1.45 million (95% CI 0.89 to 1.94) as compared with current 
practice. Although less restrictive risk assessment and polypill scenarios 
prevented more CVD events and attained larger survival gains, these benefits 
were offset by the additional costs and disutility of daily medication use. 
Lowering the risk threshold for prescription of statins to 10% was economically 
unattractive, costing £40 000 per QALY gained. Starting the polypill from age 60 
onwards became the most cost-effective scenario when annual drug prices were 
reduced below £240. All polypill scenarios would save costs at prices below £50.
CONCLUSIONS: Periodic risk assessment using lower risk thresholds is unlikely to 
be cost-effective. The polypill would become cost-effective if drug prices were 
reduced.

Mediastinitis continues to be an important and life-threatening complication 
after median sternotomy despite advances in prevention and treatment strategies, 
with an incidence of 0.25-5%. It can also occur as extension of infection from 
adjacent structures such as the oesophagus, airways and lungs, or as descending 
necrotizing infection from the head and neck. In addition, there is a chronic 
form of 'chronic fibrosing mediastinitis' usually caused by granulomatous 
infections. In this expert consensus, the evidence for strategies for treatment 
and prevention of mediatinitis is reviewed in detail aiming at reducing the 
incidence and optimizing the management of this serious condition.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate national prevalence, 
general demographic characteristics and survival of Danish patients with 
Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS).
METHOD: A population-based cohort study was conducted using a database 
consisting of the entire Danish population alive at any given time between 1 
January 2000 and 31 December 2012, based upon longitudinal Danish national 
registers. All patients with EDS were identified, and the cohort was described 
by disease prevalence, basic demographic characteristics, mean age at death and 
mortality for the observational period of 13 years.
RESULTS: The cohort held 1427 unique persons with EDS, giving a national 
prevalence of 0.02%. The EDS population had a mean ( s . d .) age of 34.9 (18.6) 
years and comprised 73.9% females and 26.1% males. Of the cohort, 95.9% 
originated from Denmark and 57% were unmarried. We found that 31.6% of the 
cohort received state-granted subsidies, of which 77% were in the form of early 
retirement pension. Regarding educational status, 28.1% of the EDS cohort had 
completed primary education (⩽10th grade) as their highest educational level, 
while 71.9% had completed a higher level. During the observation period, 42 
patients died, with a mean ( s . d .) age at death of 53.6 (21.7) years.
CONCLUSION: This study confirmed a small national prevalence of patients 
diagnosed with EDS and showed that the majority of patients diagnosed are 
female. The EDS cohort had a lower educational level, mean age and life 
expectancy compared with the background population and showed a predisposition 
for receiving state-granted subsidies.

We describe bayesPop, an R package for producing probabilistic population 
projections for all countries. This uses probabilistic projections of total 
fertility and life expectancy generated by Bayesian hierarchical models. It 
produces a sample from the joint posterior predictive distribution of future 
age- and sex-specific population counts, fertility rates and mortality rates, as 
well as future numbers of births and deaths. It provides graphical ways of 
summarizing this information, including trajectory plots and various kinds of 
probabilistic population pyramids. An expression language is introduced which 
allows the user to produce the predictive distribution of a wide variety of 
derived population quantities, such as the median age or the old age dependency 
ratio. The package produces aggregated projections for sets of countries, such 
as UN regions or trading blocs. The methodology has been used by the United 
Nations to produce their most recent official population projections for all 
countries, published in the World Population Prospects.

The Role of BRCA2 Mutation Status as Diagnostic, Predictive, and Prognosis 
Biomarker for Pancreatic Cancer.

Institute, University Hospital Fundación Jiménez Díaz-UAM, Madrid, Spain.

Pancreatic cancer is one of the deadliest cancers worldwide, and life expectancy 
after diagnosis is often short. Most pancreatic tumours appear sporadically and 
have been highly related to habits such as cigarette smoking, high alcohol 
intake, high carbohydrate, and sugar consumption. Other observational studies 
have suggested the association between pancreatic cancer and exposure to 
arsenic, lead, or cadmium. Aside from these factors, chronic pancreatitis and 
diabetes have also come to be considered as risk factors for these kinds of 
tumours. Studies have found that 10% of pancreatic cancer cases arise from an 
inherited syndrome related to some genetic alterations. One of these alterations 
includes mutation in BRCA2 gene. BRCA2 mutations impair DNA damage response and 
homologous recombination by direct regulation of RAD51. In light of these 
findings that link genetic factors to tumour development, DNA damage agents have 
been proposed as target therapies for pancreatic cancer patients carrying BRCA2 
mutations. Some of these drugs include platinum-based agents and PARP 
inhibitors. However, the acquired resistance to PARP inhibitors has created a 
need for new chemotherapeutic strategies to target BRCA2. The present systematic 
review collects and analyses the role of BRCA2 alterations to be used in early 
diagnosis of an inherited syndrome associated with familiar cancer and as a 
prognostic and predictive biomarker for the management of pancreatic cancer 
patients.

Malignant fluid, a commonly seen tumor associated complication, mainly includes 
peritoneal effusion, malignant pleural effusion and pericardial effusion. It can 
produce huge negative influence on the quality of life of patients and even lead 
to death. Treatment of malignant effusion is one of the effective measures for 
improving life expectancy of patients. To evaluate the effect of thermotherapy 
in combination with intracavitary infusion of Kangai injection in treating 
malignant pleural effusion, 195 patients who received treatment from April 2010 
to October 2014 in the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University were 
selected and divided into an observation group and two control groups (group A 
and B). The observation group was treated by thermotherapy in combination with 
intracavitary infusion of kangai injection. Control group A was treated by 
intracavitary infusion of kangai injection and control group B was treated by 
hyperthermal perfusion in combination with intracavity chemotherapy. Clinical 
effects, quality of life, treatment safety and untoward reactions were compared 
between the groups. It was found that differences of WBC, RBC and PLT levels 
before and after treatment had no statistical significance comparisons within 
group and comparisons between groups (P>0.05); hepatic and renal functions of 
the groups had no remarkable difference before or after treatment (P>0.05). The 
clinical effect of the observation group was superior to that of control groups 
A and B (P less than 0.05); the Karnofsky performance status (KPS) score of the 
observation group was much higher than that of control groups A and B 
(79.34±10.58 vs 71.11±9.64), but the difference of the ZPS score between groups 
had no statistical significance (P>0.05). It can be concluded that thermotherapy 
in combination with intracavitary infusion of traditional Chinese medicine can 
be safely applied as it has positive effects and remarkably improves quality of 
life, therefore it is clinically worth promoting.

Removal of ribonucleotides by p53 protein incorporated during DNA synthesis by 
HIV-1 reverse transcriptase.

Cell and Developmental Biology, Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University,

Ramat-Gan, Israel.

OBJECTIVE(S): HIV-1 reverse transcriptase frequently incorporates 
ribonucleotides into the proviral DNA in macrophages, but not in lymphocytes. 
The enzyme exerts an efficient ribonucleotide-terminated primer extension 
capacity. Furthermore, ribonucleotide-editing repair is attenuated in 
macrophages. Tumor suppressor p53 protein, displaying an intrinsic 3'→5' 
exonuclease activity, was found to be involved in efficient proofreading of 
base-base mismatches produced during DNA synthesis. As the presence of 
proofreading activity is cardinal for the DNA synthesis accuracy, it was of 
interest to assess whether p53 can serve as a trans-acting proofreader for HIV-1 
reverse transcriptase during ribonucleotide incorporation.
DESIGN: We investigated the potential involvement of cytoplasmic p53 in error 
correction during insertion of ribonucleotides into DNA by recombinant HIV-1 
reverse transcriptase in a p53-proficient and deficient background.
METHODS: Primer extension reactions were carried out to elucidate the 
incorporation and removal of ribonucleotides.
RESULTS: The biochemical studies suggest that p53 is involved in a 
ribonucleotide damage-associated repair mechanism through its capacity to remove 
preformed 3'-terminal ribonucleotides, to decrease ribonucleotide incorporation 
and to prevent the 3'-ribo-terminated primer extension during ongoing DNA 
synthesis by HIV-1 reverse transcriptase. A positive correlation exists between 
the presence of endogenous p53 and decrease in stable incorporation of 
ribonucleotides into DNA with p53-harboring lysates of HCT116 cells. p53, by 
preferential removal of purine over pyrimidine ribonucleotides, may affect the 
ribonucleotide mutation spectra produced by HIV-1 reverse transcriptase.
CONCLUSION: The data implies that p53 can excise incorrect sugar in addition to 
base mispairs, thereby expanding the role of p53 in the repair of nucleic acids 
replication errors.

In 2014, the all-cause age-adjusted death rate in the United States reached a 
historic low of 724.6 per 100,000 population (1). However, mortality in rural 
(nonmetropolitan) areas of the United States has decreased at a much slower 
pace, resulting in a widening gap between rural mortality rates (830.5) and 
urban mortality rates (704.3) (1). During 1999–2014, annual age-adjusted death 
rates for the five leading causes of death in the United States (heart disease, 
cancer, unintentional injury, chronic lower respiratory disease (CLRD), and 
stroke) were higher in rural areas than in urban (metropolitan) areas (Figure 
1). In most public health regions (Figure 2), the proportion of deaths among 
persons aged <80 years (U.S. average life expectancy) (2) from the five leading 
causes that were potentially excess deaths was higher in rural areas compared 
with urban areas (Figure 3). Several factors probably influence the rural-urban 
gap in potentially excess deaths from the five leading causes, many of which are 
associated with sociodemographic differences between rural and urban areas. 
Residents of rural areas in the United States tend to be older, poorer, and 
sicker than their urban counterparts (3). A higher proportion of the rural U.S. 
population reports limited physical activity because of chronic conditions than 
urban populations (4). Moreover, social circumstances and behaviors have an 
impact on mortality and potentially contribute to approximately half of the 
determining causes of potentially excess deaths (5).
