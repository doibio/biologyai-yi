There is increasing interest in the characterization of normative senescence in 
humans. To assess to what extent aging patterns in humans are unique, 
comparative data from closely related species, such as non-human primates, can 
be very useful. Here, we use data from bonobos and chimpanzees, two closely 
related species that share a common ancestor with humans, to explore 
physiological markers that are indicative of aging processes. Many studies on 
aging in humans focus on the somatotropic axis, consisting of growth hormone 
(GH), insulin-like growth factors (IGFs), and IGF binding proteins (IGFBPs). In 
humans, IGFBP-3 levels decline steadily with increasing age. We used urinary 
IGFBP-3 levels as an alternative endocrine marker for IGF-I to identify the 
temporal pattern known to be related with age-related changes in cell 
proliferation, growth, and apoptosis. We measured urinary IGFBP-3 levels in 
samples from 71 bonobos and 102 chimpanzees. Focusing on samples from 
individuals aged 10 years or older, we found that urinary IGFBP-3 levels decline 
in both ape species with increasing age. However, in both species, females start 
with higher urinary IGFBP-3 levels than males, experience a steeper decline with 
increasing age, and converge with male levels around the age of 30-35 years. Our 
measurements of urinary IGFBP-3 levels indicate that bonobos and chimpanzees 
mirror human patterns of age-related decline in IGFBP-3 in older individuals 
(<10 years) of both sexes. Moreover, such as humans, both ape species show 
sex-specific differences in IGFBP-3 levels with females having higher levels 
than males, a result that correlates with sex differences in life expectancy. 
Using changes in urinary IGFBP-3 levels as a proxy for changes in GH and IGF-I 
levels that mark age-related changes in cell proliferation, this approach 
provides an opportunity to investigate trade-offs in life-history strategies in 
cross-sectional and in longitudinal studies, both in captivity and in the wild.

The virulence of Francisella tularensis, the etiological agent of tularemia, 
relies on an atypical type VI secretion system (T6SS) encoded by a genomic 
island termed the Francisella Pathogenicity Island (FPI). While the importance 
of the FPI in F. tularensis virulence is clearly established, the precise role 
of most of the FPI-encoded proteins remains to be deciphered. In this study, 
using highly virulent F. tularensis strains and the closely related species F. 
novicida, IglG was characterized as a protein featuring a unique α-helical 
N-terminal extension and a domain of unknown function (DUF4280), present in more 
than 250 bacterial species. Three dimensional modeling of IglG and of the 
DUF4280 consensus protein sequence indicates that these proteins adopt a 
PAAR-like fold, suggesting they could cap the T6SS in a similar way as the 
recently described PAAR proteins. The newly identified PAAR-like motif is 
characterized by four conserved cysteine residues, also present in IglG, which 
may bind a metal atom. We demonstrate that IglG binds metal ions and that each 
individual cysteine is required for T6SS-dependent secretion of IglG and of the 
Hcp homologue, IglC and for the F. novicida intracellular life cycle. In 
contrast, the Francisella-specific N-terminal α-helical extension is not 
required for IglG secretion, but is critical for F. novicida virulence and for 
the interaction of IglG with another FPI-encoded protein, IglF. Altogether, our 
data suggest that IglG is a PAAR-like protein acting as a bi-modal protein that 
may connect the tip of the Francisella T6SS with a putative T6SS effector, IglF.

Cost-effectiveness of cervical spine clearance interventions with litigation and 
long-term-care implications in obtunded adult patients following blunt injury.

Washington, Seattle, Washington (B.R.H.R.); and Department of Internal Medicine, 
University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, Ohio (M.H.E.).

BACKGROUND: Recent guidelines from the Eastern Association for the Surgery of 
Trauma conditionally recommend cervical collar removal after a negative cervical 
computed tomography in obtunded adult blunt trauma patients. Although the rates 
of missed injury are extremely low, the impact of chronic care costs and 
litigation upon decision making remains unclear. We hypothesize that the 
cost-effectiveness of strategies that include additional imaging may contradict 
current guidelines.
METHODS: A cost-effectiveness analysis was performed for a base-case 
40-year-old, obtunded man with a negative computed tomography. Strategies 
compared included adjunct imaging with cervical magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI), collar maintenance for 6 weeks, or removal. Data on the probability for 
long-term collar complications, spine injury, imaging costs, complications 
associated with MRI, acute and chronic care, and litigation were obtained from 
published and Medicare data. Outcomes were expressed as 2014 US dollars and 
quality-adjusted life-years.
RESULTS: Collar removal was more effective and less costly than collar use or 
MRI (19.99 vs. 19.35 vs. 18.70 quality-adjusted life-years; $675,359 vs. 
$685,546 vs. $685,848) in the base-case analysis. When the probability of missed 
cervical injury was greater than 0.04 adjunct imaging with MRI dominated, 
however, collar removal remained cost-effective until the probability of missed 
injury exceeded 0.113 at which point collar removal exceeded the $50,000 
threshold. Collar removal remained the most cost-effective approach until the 
probability of complications from collar use was reduced to less than 0.009, at 
which point collar maintenance became the most cost-effective strategy. Early 
collar removal dominates all strategies until the risk of complications from MRI 
positioning is reduced to 0.03 and remained cost-effective even when the 
probability of complication was reduced to 0.
CONCLUSION: Early collar removal in obtunded adult blunt trauma patients appears 
to be the most effective and least costly strategy for cervical clearance based 
on the current literature available.

OBJECTIVE: Grip strength predicts functional decline and death, and is regarded 
as a biomarker of biological aging. The primary objective of this manuscript was 
to assess differences in the rate of decline in grip strength in persons aging 
with and without HIV.
DESIGN: Grip strength was assessed in 1552 (716 HIV+ and 836 HIV-) men aged at 
least 50 years participating in the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study between 2007 
and 2014.
METHODS: Grip strength decline was modeled longitudinally, adjusting for 
serostatus, demographics, comorbidities, and conditions. In HIV-specific models, 
coefficients were included for cumulative viral load and history of AIDS.
RESULTS: Grip strength at the age of 50 years averaged 37.9 and 38.2 kg for HIV+ 
and HIV- men, respectively (P = 0.70). In fully adjusted models, grip strength 
declined 0.33 kg/year in HIV- men (P < 0.001) and 0.42 kg/year in HIV+ men 
(P = 0.01). In HIV-stratified models, higher cumulative viral load indicated 
greater strength decline (-0.884 kg for 3.1-4.0 log10 copies-years/ml and 
-1.077 kg for ≥4.1 log10 copies-years/ml) relative to men with consistently low 
viral load (≤3.0 log10 copies-years/ml). Adjusted Cox proportional hazard models 
revealed a 70% greater risk of clinically weak grip strength in HIV+ men 
(adjusted hazard ratio 1.70; 95% confidence interval, 1.22-2.40).
CONCLUSION: Grip strength decline is accelerated in HIV-infected men, which may 
contribute to decreased life expectancy and lower quality of life with aging. 
Greater cumulative viral load exposure appears to be an important driver of this 
decline and underscores the importance of early initiation of therapy.

OBJECTIVES: To determine whether lifestyle factors, measured late in life, could 
compress the disabled period toward the end of life.
DESIGN: Community-based cohort study of older adults followed from 1989 to 2015.
SETTING: Four U.S. communities.
PARTICIPANTS: Community-living men and women aged 65 and older (N = 5,248, mean 
age 72.7 ± 5.5, 57% female, 15.2% minority) who were not wheelchair dependent 
and were able to give informed consent at baseline.
MEASUREMENTS: Multiple lifestyle factors, including smoking, alcohol 
consumption, physical activity, diet, body mass index (BMI), social networks, 
and social support, were measured at baseline. Activities of daily living (ADLs) 
were assessed at baseline and throughout follow-up. Years of life (YoL) was 
defined as years until death. Years of able life (YAL) was defined as years 
without any ADL difficulty. YAL/YoL%, the proportion of life lived able, was 
used to indicate the relative compression or expansion of the disabled period.
RESULTS: The average duration of disabled years was 4.5 (out of 15.4 mean YoL) 
for women and 2.9 (out of 12.4 mean YoL) for men. In a multivariable model, 
obesity was associated with 7.3 percentage points (95% confidence interval (CI) 
= 5.4-9.2) lower YAL/YoL% than normal weight. Scores in the lowest quintile of 
the Alternate Healthy Eating Index were associated with a 3.7% (95% CI = 
1.6-5.9) lower YAL/YoL% than scores in the highest quintile. Every 25 blocks 
walked in a week was associated with 0.5 percentage points (95% CI = 0.3-0.8) 
higher YAL/YoL%.
CONCLUSION: The effects of healthy lifestyle factors on the proportion of future 
life lived free of disability indicate that the disabled period can be 
compressed, given the right combination of these factors.

Romania: Health System Review.

This analysis of the Romanian health system reviews recent developments in 
organization and governance, health financing, health care provision, health 
reforms and health system performance. The Romanian health care system is a 
social health insurance system that has remained highly centralized despite 
recent efforts to decentralize some regulatory functions. It provides a 
comprehensive benefits package to the 85% of the population that is covered, 
with the remaining population having access to a minimum package of benefits. 
While every insured person has access to the same health care benefits 
regardless of their socioeconomic situation, there are inequities in access to 
health care across many dimensions, such as rural versus urban, and health 
outcomes also differ across these dimensions. The Romanian population has seen 
increasing life expectancy and declining mortality rates but both remain among 
the worst in the European Union. Some unfavourable trends have been observed, 
including increasing numbers of new HIV/AIDS diagnoses and falling immunization 
rates. Public sources account for over 80% of total health financing. However, 
that leaves considerable out-of-pocket payments covering almost a fifth of total 
expenditure. The share of informal payments also seems to be substantial, but 
precise figures are unknown. In 2014, Romania had the lowest health expenditure 
as a share of gross domestic product (GDP) among the EU Member States. In line 
with the government's objective of strengthening the role of primary care, the 
total number of hospital beds has been decreasing. However, health care 
provision remains characterized by underprovision of primary and community care 
and inappropriate use of inpatient and specialized outpatient care, including 
care in hospital emergency departments. The numbers of physicians and nurses are 
relatively low in Romania compared to EU averages. This has mainly been 
attributed to the high rates of workers emigrating abroad over the past decade, 
exacerbated by Romania's EU accession and the reduction of public sector 
salaries due to the economic crisis. Reform in the Romanian health system has 
been both constant and yet frequently ineffective, due in part to the high 
degree of political instability. Recent reforms have focused mainly on 
introducing cost-saving measures, for example, by attempting to shift some of 
the health care costs to drug manufacturers by claw-back and to the population 
through co-payments, and on improving the monitoring of health care expenditure.

Spending on anticancer drugs has risen rapidly over the past two decades. A key 
policy question is whether new anticancer drugs offer value, given their high 
cost. Using data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results 
(SEER)-Medicare database, we assessed the value of new cancer treatments in 
routine clinical practice for patients with metastatic breast, lung, or kidney 
cancer or chronic myeloid leukemia in the periods 1996-2000 and 2007-11. We 
found that there were large increases in medical costs, but also large gains in 
life expectancy. For example, among patients with breast cancer who received 
physician-administered drugs, lifetime costs-including costs for outpatient and 
inpatient care-increased by $72,000 and life expectancy increased by thirteen 
months. Changes in life expectancy and costs were much smaller among patients 
who did not receive these drugs.

BACKGROUND: According to the Turkey Burden of Disease Study, 10% of the national 
burden of disease is attributed to cardiovascular diseases. Although the 
standardized coronary heart disease (CHD) rate is falling in general, CHD 
prevalence among young people is rising. On the other hand, as a result of 
increased life expectancy and higher retirement ages, the CHD rate among workers 
is also increasing. Therefore, work ability and return to work after diagnosis 
are important for population health and well-being. Socioeconomic factors and 
working conditions may play a key role as well as clinical conditions described 
in the literature that affect returning to work.
AIMS: The aims of this qualitative study are exploring the changes in employment 
and working conditions of the patients after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) 
and affecting factors such as socioeconomic, personal and environmental.
STUDY DESIGN: Qualitative research.
METHODS: The research population are fifty-three patients who are engaged in 
paid employment when the people have been diagnosed with myocardial infarction 
for the first time between 2011 and 2012 at a university hospital coronary care 
unit. We intended to reach the whole population. Twenty-seven patients were 
contacted whose phone numbers were accessible from the hospital records. 
Semi-structured in-depth interviews were conducted with twelve patients in a 
meeting room at the hospital. The interviews were tape-recorded accompanied by 
note-taking and the content analysis method were evaluated.
RESULTS: While many of the participants continued to work at the same job by 
working less, one third of them said that they were thinking about getting an 
easier job if they have the opportunity. On the other hand, in most cases, there 
were neither assessments about their work ability, nor changes to their working 
conditions after AMI. They had to cope with their conditions, such as economic 
or psychosocial, without any support.
CONCLUSIONS: While the patients have to return to work for economic and social 
reasons, they expressed uncertainty about working after a diagnosis of AMI and 
could not reach professional support to assess their work abilities. Therefore, 
specific algorithms and assessment tools to manage the return to work of AMI 
patients would be useful.

BACKGROUND: Even though human hookworm infection is highly endemic in many 
countries throughout the world, its global economic and health impact is not 
well known. Without a better understanding of hookworm's economic burden 
worldwide, it is difficult for decision makers such as funders, policy makers, 
disease control officials, and intervention manufacturers to determine how much 
time, energy, and resources to invest in hookworm control.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPLE FINDINGS: We developed a computational simulation model to 
estimate the economic and health burden of hookworm infection in every country, 
WHO region, and globally, in 2016 from the societal perspective. Globally, 
hookworm infection resulted in a total 2,126,280 DALYs using 2004 disability 
weight estimates and 4,087,803 DALYs using 2010 disability weight estimates 
(excluding cognitive impairment outcomes). Including cognitive impairment did 
not significantly increase DALYs worldwide. Total productivity losses varied 
with the probability of anemia and calculation method used, ranging from $7.5 
billion to $138.9 billion annually using gross national income per capita as a 
proxy for annual wages and ranging from $2.5 billion to $43.9 billion using 
minimum wage as a proxy for annual wages.
CONCLUSION: Even though hookworm is classified as a neglected tropical disease, 
its economic and health burden exceeded published estimates for a number of 
diseases that have received comparatively more attention than hookworm such as 
rotavirus. Additionally, certain large countries that are transitioning to 
higher income countries such as Brazil and China, still face considerable 
hookworm burden.

BACKGROUND: Malignant airway obstruction is a feared complication and will most 
probably occur more frequently in the future because of increasing cancer 
incidence and increased life expectancy in cancer patients. Minimal invasive 
treatment using airway stents represents a meaningful and life-saving 
palliation. We present a new removable airway stent for improved individualised 
treatment.
METHODS: To our knowledge, the new airway stent is the world's first knitted and 
uncovered self-expanding metal stent, which can unravel and be completely 
removed. In an in vivo model using two anaesthetised and spontaneously breathing 
pigs, we deployed and subsequently removed the stents by unravelling the device. 
The procedures were executed by flexible bronchoscopy in an acute and a chronic 
setting - a 'proof-of-principle' study.
RESULTS: The new stent was easily and accurately deployed in the central 
airways, and it remained fixed in its original position. It was easy to unravel 
and completely remove from the airways without clinically significant 
complications. During the presence of the stent in the chronic study, 
granulation tissue was induced. This tissue disappeared spontaneously with the 
removal.
CONCLUSIONS: The new removable stent functioned according to its purpose and 
unravelled easily, and it was completely removed without significant technical 
or medical complications. Induced granulation tissue disappeared spontaneously. 
Further studies on animals and humans are needed to define its optimal 
indications and future use.

BACKGROUND: The Quality-Adjusted Life Year (QALY) is a measure that combines 
life extension and health improvement in a single score, reflecting preferences 
around different types of health gain. It can therefore be used to inform 
decision-making around allocation of health care resources to mutually exclusive 
options that would produce qualitatively different health benefits. A number of 
quality-of-life instruments can be used to calculate QALYs. The EQ-5D is one of 
the most commonly used, and is the preferred option for submissions to NICE ( 
https://www.nice.org.uk/process/pmg9/ ). However, it has limitations that might 
make it unsuitable for use in areas such as public and mental health where 
interventions may aim to improve well-being. One alternative to the QALY is a 
Wellbeing-Adjusted Life Year. In this study we explore the need for a 
Wellbeing-Adjusted Life Year measure by examining the extent to which a measure 
of wellbeing (the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale) maps onto the 
EQ-5D-3L.
METHODS: Secondary analyses were conducted on data from the Coventry Household 
Survey in which 7469 participants completed the EQ-5D-3L, Warwick-Edinburgh 
Mental Well-being Scale, and a measure of self-rated health. Data were analysed 
using descriptive statistics, Pearson's and Spearman's correlations, linear 
regression, and receiver operating characteristic curves.
RESULTS: Approximately 75 % of participants scored the maximum on the EQ-5D-3L. 
Those with maximum EQ-5D-3L scores reported a wide range of levels of mental 
wellbeing. Both the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale and the EQ-5D-3L 
were able to detect differences between those with higher and lower levels of 
self-reported health. Linear regression indicated that scores on the 
Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale and the EQ-5D-3L were weakly, 
positively correlated (with R(2) being 0.104 for the index and 0.141 for the 
visual analogue scale).
CONCLUSION: The Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale maps onto the EQ-5D-3L 
to only a limited extent. Levels of mental wellbeing varied greatly amongst 
participants who had the maximum score on the EQ-5D-3L. To evaluate the relative 
effectiveness of interventions that impact on mental wellbeing, a new measure - 
a Wellbeing Adjusted Life Year - is needed.

BACKGROUND: measures of population health, like the Disability Adjusted Life 
Year (DALY), are important for health policy and planning. Some worry, however, 
that these measures discriminate against the disabled.
METHODS: This paper provides an analysis of the disability discrimination 
problem. Then, adapting a fixed-plus-variable framework proposed in welfare 
economics to the case of health measurement, it proposes a novel measure called 
the Ethically Adjusted Life Year (EALY).
RESULTS: The EALY, in at least some formulations, can avoid discriminating 
against the disabled. It is different from, and has some advantages over, 
alternative ways of avoiding discrimination.
CONCLUSIONS: There is reason to consider using the EALY in measuring health 
burden and the impact of health interventions.

BACKGROUND: The support of health promotion activities for older people gains 
societal relevance in terms of enhancing the health and well-being of older 
people with a view to the efficient use of financial resources in the healthcare 
sector. Health economic evaluations have become an important instrument to 
support decision-making processes in many countries. Sound evidence on the 
cost-effectiveness of health promotion activities would encourage support for 
the implementation of health promotion activities for older people. This debate 
article discusses to what extent economic evaluation techniques are appropriate 
to support decision makers in the allocation of resources regarding health 
promotion activities for older people. We address the problem that the economic 
evaluation of these interventions is hampered by methodological obstacles that 
limit comparability, e.g. with economic evaluations of curative measures. Our 
central objective is to describe and discuss the specific problems and 
challenges entailed in the economic evaluation of health promotion activities 
especially for older people with regard to their usefulness for informing 
decision making processes.
DISCUSSION: Beyond general problems concerning the economic evaluation of health 
promotion, our discussion focusses on problems that pertain to the analysis of 
cost and outcomes of health promotion interventions for older people. With 
regard to costs these are general problems of economic evaluations, namely the 
actual implementation of a societal perspective, the appropriate measurement and 
valuation of informal caregiver time, the measurement and valuation of 
productivity costs and costs incurred in added years of life. The main problems 
concerning the identification and measurement of outcomes are related to the 
identification of outcome parameters that, firstly, adequately reflect the broad 
effects of health promotion interventions, especially social benefits that gain 
importance for older people, and secondly, ensure a comparability of effects 
across different age groups. In particular, the limitations of the widely used 
QALY for older people are discussed and recently developed alternatives are 
presented.
CONCLUSIONS: The key conclusion of the article is that a comparison of the 
effects of different health promotion initiatives between different age groups 
by means of economic evaluation is not recommendable. Taking into account the 
complex outcomes of health promotion interventions it has to be accepted that 
the outcomes of these interventions will often not be comparable with clinical 
interventions and have to be assessed differently.

The aim of this study was to survey the current status of reirradiation (Re-RT) 
and patterns of practice in Japan. An email questionnaire was sent to Kansai 
Cancer Therapist Group partner institutions, using questions similar to those in 
the Canadian radiation oncologist (RO) survey (2008). A total of 34 ROs from 28 
institutions returned the survey. All 28 institutions experienced Re-RT cases in 
2014. However, 26 of the 28 institutions (93%) reported difficulty in obtaining 
Re-RT case information from their respective databases. Responses from 19 
institutions included the number of Re-RT cases; this rose from 183 in the 
period 2005-2009 (institution median = 4; 2-12.9) to 562 in the period 2010-2014 
(institution median = 26; 2-225). Important considerations for indication of 
Re-RT were age (65%), performance status (83%), life expectancy (70%), absence 
of distant metastases (67%), and interval since previous treatment (73%). 
Previous total radiation dose (48%), volume of tissue irradiated (72%), and the 
biologically equivalent dose (BED; 68.5%) were taken into account during Re-RT 
planning. These factors were similar to those considered in the Canadian survey; 
however, the present study did not consider age. In eight site-specific 
scenarios, barring central nervous system recurrence, more than 90% of ROs 
agreed to perform Re-RT, which was higher than the percentage observed in the 
Canadian survey. Re-RT cases have increased in number and aroused interest among 
ROs in this decade of advanced technology. However, consensus building to 
establish guidelines for the practice and prospective evaluation of Re-RT is 
required.

Objective To construct the ribosome display library of anti-B7-H4 extracellular 
domain, and select the antibody with high specificity. Methods The cDNA of B7-H4 
extracellular domain was amplified from A549 cells by reverse transcription PCR 
(RT-PCR). To express ectodomains of B7-H4, the sequence of B7-H4 gene, which 
encodes the B7-H4 extracellular domains, was inserted into plasmid pET-28a(+). 
The purified recombinant protein of B7-H4 extracellular domain was used to 
immunize BALB/c mice. The total RNA was extracted from the spleen of BALB/c mice 
which had been immunized with B7-H4 recombinant protein. The genes of VH, Vκ and 
VH/Vκ were amplified separately by RT-PCR and splicing by overlap extension PCR 
(SOE-PCR). The gene of VH/ Vκ was ligated into pUM19-T vector and the ligated 
sample was transformed into competent E.coli DH5α. The resulting plasmid was 
isolated and then subjected to sequencing to verify the gene sequence. TNT(R)T7 
Quick for PCR DNA kit was used to translate and screen the anti-B7-H4-scFv in 
vitro from the ribosome display library. Western blotting and an indirect ELISA 
were performed to detect the specificity of anti-B7-H4-scFv. Results The right 
sequences of VH, Vκ and VH/Vκ were acquired, which were 439, 680 and 1098 bp in 
length, respectively. The analysis of specificity demonstrated that the 
anti-B7-H4-scFv screened from the ribosome display library had a high specific 
combining ability with B7-H4. Conclusion The experiment has successively 
constructed the ribosome display library of anti-B7-H4 extracellular domain, and 
selected the anti-B7-H4-scFv which has a high specific binding ability with 
recombinant protein of B7-H4 extracelluar domain.

Hyponatremia (HN) is a common condition, with a large number of etiologies and a 
complicated treatment. Although chronic HN has been shown to be a predictor of 
poor outcome, sodium-increasing treatments in chronic stable and asymptomatic HN 
have not proven to increase life expectancy. For symptomatic HN, in contrast, 
the necessity for urgent treatment has broadly been accepted to avoid the 
development of fatal cerebral edema. On the other hand, a too rapid increase of 
serum sodium in chronic HN may result in cerebral damage due to osmotic 
demyelinisation. Recently, administration of hypertonic saline bolus has been 
recommended as first-line treatment in patients with moderate-to-severe 
symptomatic HN. This approach is easy to memorize and holds the potential to 
greatly facilitate the initial treatment of symptomatic HN. First-line treatment 
of chronic HN is fluid restriction and if ineffective treatment with tolvaptan 
or in some patients other agents should be considered. A number of 
recommendations and guidelines have been published on HN. In the present review, 
the management of patients with HN in relation to everyday clinical practice is 
summarized with focus on the acute management.

Personality disorders are pervasive patterns of maladaptive behaviors, thoughts, 
and emotions that often go unrecognized and can wreak havoc in the patient's 
interpersonal life. These inflexible patterns of managing the world can be 
disruptive when an individual is admitted to the hospital, causing distress for 
both the patient who lacks the skills to deal with the expectations of the 
hospital environment and the treatment team who can feel ill equipped to manage 
such behavior. Having a personality disorder has implications for an 
individual's healthcare outcomes; those with a personality disorder have a life 
expectancy nearly 2 decades shorter than the general population for a multitude 
of reasons, among them trouble interacting with the healthcare system. Although 
a diagnosis of a specific personality disorder may be difficult to make on an 
acute care unit, identification of dysfunctional personality structures can 
provide opportunity for better management of an individual patient's medical and 
psychological needs. This review focuses on the identification of these 
individuals in the acute care setting and provides an overview of evidence-based 
behavioral and pharmacological interventions. Journal of Hospital Medicine

The scorpion has been extensively used in various pharmacological profiles or as 
food supplies. The exploration of scorpion venom has been reported due to the 
presence of recombinant peptides. rBmαTX14 is an α-neurotoxin extracted from the 
venom gland of the East Asian scorpion Buthus martensii Karsch and can affect 
ion channel conductance. Here, we investigated the functions of rBmαTX14 using 
the Caenorhabditis elegans model. Using western blot analysis, rBmαTX14 was 
shown to be expressed both in the cytoplasm and inclusion bodies in the E.coli 
Rosetta (DE3) strain. Circular dichroism spectroscopy analysis demonstrated that 
purified rBmαTX14 retained its biological structures. Next, feeding nematodes 
with E.coli Rosetta (DE3) expressing rBmαTX14 caused extension of the life span 
and promoted the locomotion of the nematodes. In addition, we identified several 
genes that play various roles in the life span and locomotion of C. elegans 
through microarray analysis and quantitative real-time PCR. Furthermore, if the 
amino acid site H15 of rBmαTX14 was mutated, rBmαTX14 no longer promoted the C. 
elegans life span. In conclusion, the results not only demonstrated the 
functions and mechanism of rBmαTX14 in C. elegans, but also provided the new 
sight in the utility of recombinant peptides from scorpion venom.

BACKGROUND: We investigated the predictors of long-term gains in 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) from total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and the 
patient attributes that predicted cost-effective TKA.
METHODS: Data on TKA patients (n = 570) from 2006 to 2007 were extracted from a 
single-institution registry. QALY gains over 7 years post surgery were 
calculated from health-related quality of life (HrQoL) scores measured 
preoperatively and annually postoperatively using the short-form health survey 
(SF-12) instrument. Multivariate linear regression analysis investigated the 
predictors of QALY gain from TKA from a broad range of preoperative patient 
characteristics and was used to predict QALY gains for each individual. Patients 
were grouped into deciles according to their predicted QALY gain, and the 
cost-effectiveness of each decile was plotted on the cost-effectiveness plane. 
Patient attribute differences between deciles were decomposed.
RESULTS: After exclusions and dropout, data were available for 488 patients. The 
average estimated QALY gain over 7 years was 0.77 (95% confidence interval [CI] 
0.70-0.83). Predictors significantly associated with smaller QALY gains were 
comorbidities (Charlson comorbidity index 3+ coefficient -0.54 CI -0.15 
to -0.92), the absence of severe osteoarthritis in the ipsilateral knee (-0.51 
CI -0.16 to -0.85), preoperative HrQoL (standardized coefficient -0.34 CI -0.26 
to -0.43), the requirement for an interpreter (-0.24 CI -0.05 to -0.44), and age 
(-0.01 CI -0.01 to -0.02). The largest difference between cost-effective and 
non-cost-effective deciles was relatively high preoperative HrQoL in the 
non-cost-effective decile.
CONCLUSION: TKA is likely to be cost-effective for most patients except those 
with unusually high preoperative HrQoL or a lack of severe osteoarthritis. The 
poorer outcomes for those requiring an interpreter requires further research.

Previous studies have mainly used mortality or morbidity as the health outcome 
to examine the air pollution-health association. Little evidence is available on 
relationships between air pollutants and years of life lost (YLL). We aimed to 
estimate the YLL from cardiovascular mortality due to air pollution. Daily data 
on weather and air pollutants and individual data of all registered deaths for 
years 2004-2007 were obtained in Guangzhou, China. The generalized additive 
model was used to assess the YLL associated with 10μg/m3 increases in NO2, SO2 
and PM10. We found that the mean daily YLL was 248, 87.5 and 73.7 for deaths 
from cardiovascular disease (CVD), stroke and ischemic heart disease (IHD), 
respectively. A significant linear correlation was observed between air 
pollution and YLL due to cardiovascular disease. The effects of air pollutants 
on YLL were immediate and lasted for two days. A 10μg/m3 increase above the 
corresponding threshold of 55.6μg/m3, 40.4μg/m3 and 0μg/m3 in NO2, PM10 and SO2 
was related to YLL increase of 1.8 (95% CI: 0.8-2.9), 2.8 (1.7-3.8) and 2.6 
(1.2-4.0) years at lag 0-1days for CVD, respectively. The estimates of YLL 
associated with NO2 and PM10 were higher in men than women. The air 
pollutants-related YLL was higher among young people and those with low 
education level, compared to the elderly and those with high education level, 
respectively. These findings confirmed YLL provides a complementary strategy for 
assessing the health effect of air pollution. This study underscores the 
necessity of the reduction of air pollution benefiting public health.
