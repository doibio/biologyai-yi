BACKGROUND: The HIV Prevention Trials Network (HPTN) 083 trial demonstrated the 
superiority of long-acting injectable cabotegravir (CAB-LA) compared with oral 
emtricitabine-tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (F/TDF) for HIV preexposure 
prophylaxis (PrEP).
OBJECTIVE: To identify the maximum price premium (that is, greatest possible 
price differential) that society should be willing to accept for the additional 
benefits of CAB-LA over tenofovir-based PrEP among men who have sex with men and 
transgender women (MSM/TGW) in the United States.
DESIGN: Simulation, cost-effectiveness analysis.
DATA SOURCES: Trial and published data, including estimated HIV incidence (5.32, 
1.33, and 0.26 per 100 person-years for off PrEP, generic F/TDF and branded 
emtricitabine-tenofovir alafenamide (F/TAF), and CAB-LA, respectively); 28% 
6-year PrEP retention. Annual base-case drug costs: $360 and $16 800 for generic 
F/TDF and branded F/TAF. Fewer side effects with branded F/TAF versus generic 
F/TDF were assumed.
TARGET POPULATION: 476 700 MSM/TGW at very high risk for HIV (VHR).
TIME HORIZON: 10 years.
PERSPECTIVE: Health care system.
INTERVENTION: CAB-LA versus generic F/TDF or branded F/TAF for HIV PrEP.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary transmissions, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), 
costs (2020 U.S. dollars), incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs; U.S. 
dollars per QALY), maximum price premium for CAB-LA versus tenofovir-based PrEP.
RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: Compared with generic F/TDF (or branded F/TAF), 
CAB-LA increased life expectancy by 28 000 QALYs (26 000 QALYs) among those at 
VHR. Branded F/TAF cost more per QALY gained than generic F/TDF compared with no 
PrEP. At 10 years, CAB-LA could achieve an ICER of at most $100 000 per QALY 
compared with generic F/TDF at a maximum price premium of $3700 per year over 
generic F/TDF (CAB-LA price <$4100 per year).
RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: In a PrEP-eligible population at high risk for 
HIV, rather than at VHR (n = 1 906 800; off PrEP incidence: 1.54 per 100 
person-years), CAB-LA could achieve an ICER of at most $100 000 per QALY versus 
generic F/TDF at a maximum price premium of $1100 per year over generic F/TDF 
(CAB-LA price <$1500 per year).
LIMITATION: Uncertain clinical and economic benefits of averting future 
transmissions.
CONCLUSION: Effective oral PrEP limits the additional price society should be 
willing to pay for CAB-LA.

Over the past decade, we have witnessed unprecedented, groundbreaking innovation 
in pharmaceuticals. This has been particularly true in oncology, where new 
therapies have increased survival and at times offered clinical cure. However, 
the impact of these promising treatments has been attenuated by persistent 
access and cost challenges that may limit their effect. A narrative has emerged 
that many of these so-called breakthroughs are not priced according to the value 
they provide. Traditional cost-effectiveness analyses would appear to support 
these doubts, often suggesting that innovative therapies do not represent value 
for money. However, there is a case to be made that innovative therapies require 
equally innovative value assessments. To explore this emerging viewpoint, this 
article provides a brief introduction to the current value debate and 
oncology-specific considerations when assessing elements of value. We offer a 
brief background on the nature and development of quality-adjusted life-years as 
a part of cost-effectiveness analyses and some of their key limitations; a 
primer on "novel" elements of value, which capture specific aspects of patient 
and societal preferences not included in quality-adjusted life-years; and their 
applicability to oncology including discussion on areas where further thought 
and research might be needed. We conclude with a potential checklist of novel 
elements of value that should be considered. DISCLOSURES: This Viewpoints

Life span inequality as a function of the moments of the deaths distribution: 
Connections and insights.

Recent work has unearthed many empirical regularities in mortality trends, 
including the inverse correlation between life expectancy and life span 
inequality, and the compression of mortality into older age ranges. These 
regularities have furnished important insights into the dynamics of mortality by 
describing, in demographic terms, how different attributes of the life table 
deaths distribution interrelate and change over time. However, though empirical 
evidence suggests that the demographically-meaningful metrics these regularities 
involve (e.g., life span disparity and life table entropy) are correlated to the 
moments of the deaths distribution (e.g., variance), the broader theoretical 
connections between life span inequality and the moments of the deaths 
distribution have yet to be elucidated. In this article we establish such 
connections and leverage them to furnish new insights into mortality dynamics. 
We prove theoretical results linking life span disparity and life table entropy 
to the central moments of the deaths distribution, and use these results to 
empirically link statistical measures of variation of the deaths distribution 
(e.g., variance, index of dispersion) to life span disparity and life table 
entropy. We validate these results via empirical analyses using data from the 
Human Mortality Database and extract from them several new insights into 
mortality shifting and compression in human populations.

In many countries of the world, COVID-19 pandemic has led to exceptional changes 
in mortality trends. Some studies have tried to quantify the effects of Covid-19 
in terms of a reduction in life expectancy at birth in 2020. However, these 
estimates might need to be updated now that, in most countries, the mortality 
data for the whole year are available. We used data from the Human Mortality 
Database (HMD) Short-Term Mortality Fluctuations (STMF) data series to estimate 
life expectancy in 2020 for several countries. The changes estimated using these 
data and the appropriate methodology seem to be more pessimistic than those that 
have been proposed so far: life expectancy dropped in the Russia by 2.16 years, 
1.85 in USA, and 1.27 in England and Wales. The differences among countries are 
substantial: many countries (e.g. Denmark, Island, Norway, New Zealand, South 
Korea) saw a rather limited drop in life expectancy or have even seen an 
increase in life expectancy.

BACKGROUND: Three-amino-loop-extension (TALE) superfamily genes are widely 
present in plants and function directly in plant growth and development and 
abiotic stress response. Although TALE genes have been studied in many plant 
species, members of the TALE family have not been identified in wheat.
RESULTS: In this study, we identified 70 wheat TALE protein candidate genes 
divided into two subfamilies, KNOX (KNOTTED-like homeodomain) and BEL1-like 
(BLH/BELL homeodomain). Genes in the same subfamily or branch in the 
phylogenetic tree are similar in structure, and their encoded proteins have 
similar motifs and conserved structures. Wheat TALE genes are unevenly 
distributed on 21 chromosomes and expanded on the fourth chromosome. Through 
gene duplication analysis, 53 pairs of wheat TALE genes were determined to 
result from segmental duplication events, and five pairs were caused by tandem 
duplication events. The Ka/Ks between TALE gene pairs indicates a strong 
purification and selection effect. There are multiple cis-elements in the 
2000 bp promoter sequence that respond to hormones and abiotic stress, 
indicating that most wheat TALE genes are involved in the growth, development, 
and stress response of wheat. We also studied the expression profiles of wheat 
TALE genes in different developmental stages and tissues and under different 
stress treatments. We detected the expression levels of four TALE genes by 
qRT-PCR, and selected TaKNOX11-A for further downstream analysis. TaKNOX11-A 
enhanced the drought and salt tolerances of Arabidopsis thaliana. TaKNOX11-A 
overexpressing plants had decreased malondialdehyde content and increased 
proline content, allowing for more effective adaptation of plants to unfavorable 
environments.
CONCLUSIONS: We identified TALE superfamily members in wheat and conducted a 
comprehensive bioinformatics analysis. The discovery of the potential role of 
TaKNOX11-A in drought resistance and salt tolerance provides a basis for 
follow-up studies of wheat TALE family members, and also provides new genetic 
resources for improving the stress resistance of wheat.

Nepal's Primary Health Care (PHC) is aligned vertically with disease control 
programs at the core and a vast network of community health workers at the 
periphery. Aligning with the globalization of health and the factors affecting 
global burden of diseases, Nepal echoes the progressive increase in life 
expectancy, changes in diseases patterns, including the current impact of 
COVID-19. Nepal's health system is also accommodating recent federalization, and 
thus it is critical to explore how the primary health care system is grappling 
the challenges amidst these changes. In this review, we conducted a narrative 
synthesis of literature to explore the challenges related to transformation of 
Nepal's primary health care delivery system to meet the demands incurred by 
impact of globalization and recent federalization, covering following database: 
PubMED, Embase and Google Scholar. Of the 49 articles abstracted for full text 
review, 37 were included in the analyses. Existing theories were used for 
constructing the conceptual framework to explain the study findings. The results 
are divided into four themes. Additional searches were conducted to further 
support the narrative synthesis: a total of 46 articles were further included in 
the articulation of main findings. Transforming Nepal's primary health care 
system requires a clear focus on following priority areas that include i) 
Revised efforts towards strengthening of community based primary health care 
units; ii) Adapting vertical programs to federal governance; iii) Reinforcing 
the health insurance scheme; and iv) Strengthening an existing network of 
community health workers and health human resources. This review discusses how 
these broad goals bear challenges and opportunities.

BACKGROUND: Individuals with glycogen storage disease IIIa (GSD IIIa) (OMIM 
#232400) experience muscle weakness and exercise limitation that worsen through 
adulthood. However, normative data for markers of physical capacity, such as 
strength and cardiovascular fitness, are limited. Furthermore, the impact of the 
disease on muscle size and quality is unstudied in weight bearing skeletal 
muscle, a key predictor of physical function. We aim to produce normative 
reference values of aerobic capacity and strength in individuals with GSD IIIa, 
and to investigate the role of muscle size and quality on exercise impairment.
RESULTS: Peak oxygen uptake (V̇O2peak) was lower in the individuals with GSD 
IIIa than predicted based on demographic data (17.0 (9.0) ml/kg/min, 53 (24)% of 
predicted, p = 0.001). Knee extension maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) was 
also substantially lower than age matched predicted values (MVC: 146 (116) Nm, 
57% predicted, p = 0.045), though no difference was found in MVC relative to 
body mass (1.88 (2.74) Nm/kg, 61% of predicted, p = 0.263). There was a strong 
association between aerobic capacity and maximal leg strength (r = 0.920; 
p = 0.003). Substantial inter-individual variation was present, with a high 
physical capacity group that had normal leg strength (MVC), and relatively high 
V̇O2peak, and a low physical capacity that display impaired strength and 
substantially lower V̇O2peak. The higher physical capacity sub-group were 
younger, had larger Vastus Lateralis (VL) muscles, greater muscle quality, 
undertook more physical activity (PA), and reported higher health-related 
quality of life.
CONCLUSIONS: V̇O2peak and knee extension strength are lower in individuals with 
GSD IIIa than predicted based on their demographic data. Patients with higher 
physical capacity have superior muscle size and structure characteristics and 
higher health-related quality of life, than those with lower physical capacity. 
This study provides normative values of these important markers of physical 
capacity.

BACKGROUND: Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma is a rare, rapidly progressive, and 
highly aggressive tumor. It has a global annual incidence of 1-2 per million 
people. It mostly affects older adults and women. The median survival duration 
after diagnosis does not exceed 6-8 months.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 60-year-old female patient of mixed race (Honduran) 
presented to the local medical service with dysphonia that had started 
approximately 2 months earlier, accompanied by orthopnea that had started 1 
month earlier. On physical examination, a soft mass was palpated within the 
anterior neck region; it was approximately 4 cm in diameter, painless, and 
mobile on swallowing, and had irregular margins. Ultrasound and computed 
tomography of the neck were performed. Subsequently, fine needle aspiration 
biopsy was performed. The histological diagnosis was anaplastic thyroid 
carcinoma (stage IVB). She underwent total thyroidectomy and chemotherapy. She 
is currently in her fifth year of remission after diagnosis and remains under 
oncologic surveillance.
DISCUSSION: Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma demonstrates a lethal behavior. 
Approximately 18% survive for more than a year after diagnosis, and 0-10% 
survive for 5 years. Different pretherapeutic prognostic factors may affect 
survival, including age < 70 years, the absence of distant metastases, and 
complete local resection.
CONCLUSION: Conventional treatment improves the quality of life of the patient, 
but the results are not encouraging for the medium and long term. Only a few 
patients manage to exceed the average life expectancy of 3-6 months, despite 
undergoing the currently available therapeutic regimen.

CASE: Two patients (aged 71 and 82 years) presented with a greater trochanteric 
fracture with lesser trochanter extension. These cases were successfully treated 
by prophylactic osteosynthesis to prevent secondary intertrochanteric/cervical 
fracture and to facilitate an early return to daily life. We also clarified the 
mechanical strength of the area that escaped bone fracture using the 
patient-specific computed tomography-based finite element method (CT/FEM).
CONCLUSIONS: The present fractured femurs were shown to halve the axial 
compression strength and had only one-sixth torsional strength in 
patient-specific CT/FEM. These data support prophylactic surgery to prevent the 
secondary fractures because of this injury.

BACKGROUND: Despite the non-sterile nature of the alimentary tract, percutaneous 
endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) procedures are often performed after creating a 
sterile surgical field to reduce infection risk. Our group has previously 
demonstrated no statistically significant difference in the rate of surgical 
site infection (SSI) following PEG performed with or without sterile operative 
fields. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of 
working with or without sterile operative fields during PEG.
METHODS: A decision tree model of PEG with and without sterile operative fields 
was created to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of these two methods. The primary 
outcome was incremental cost-effectiveness ratio with a ceiling willingness to 
pay threshold assumed of $100,000 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). Costs 
were from the perspective of the healthcare system with a time horizon for the 
model of 90 days. Sensitivity analyses were performed on all model parameters.
RESULTS: In the base case analysis, sterile operative field PEG was 
cost-effective resulting in 0.2225 QALYs at an expected cost of $2,099. PEG 
procedures without a sterile operative field yielded less QALYs (0.2224) at a 
higher cost ($2,199) and were dominated. These procedures became cost-effective 
when the expected cost was < $1618 (e.g., $140 less than sterile operative field 
PEG) or when the SSI rate was < 1.6% (e.g., 0.2% higher than sterile operative 
field PEG) while holding all other variables constant.
CONCLUSION: PEG procedures performed without a sterile operative field can be 
cost-effective compared to procedures performed with a sterile operative field 
if the rates of SSI remain similar. Cost savings from foregoing a sterile 
operative field appear to be offset if the SSI rate increases > 0.2% above that 
of sterile operative field PEG procedures.

This study aimed to investigate whether belt electrode skeletal muscle 
electrical stimulation (B-SES) would improve postoperative lower limb function 
and walking ability in patients with diabetes who have undergone minor 
amputations. Diabetic patients who had undergone minor amputations were assigned 
randomly to a B-SES or control group. The B-SES group underwent conventional 
physical therapy for 20 min and B-SES for 20 min. The control group underwent 
only the 20-min conventional physical therapy. In both groups, rehabilitation 
was introduced by the physical therapists for 14 days from postoperative day 1. 
The outcome measures were range of motion in the ankle joint, knee extension 
muscle strength, ambulation status, and quality of life score. All these were 
evaluated before the intervention and 2 and 4 weeks after the intervention. From 
the 84 patients initially assessed, 32 were assigned to either the B-SES 
(N = 16) or control (N = 16) group. Preoperatively, there were no significant 
differences in all endpoints. The B-SES group showed significant improvement in 
the ankle dorsiflexion angle at 2 weeks postoperatively and knee joint extension 
strength at 4 weeks postoperatively. Postoperative B-SES with standard physical 
therapy might improve the range of motion of dorsiflexion of the ankle joint and 
extensor strength of the knee joint in patients with diabetes who have undergone 
minor amputations. B-SES is a useful tool to improve postoperative physical 
function in diabetic patients who have undergone minor amputations. A 
multicenter study is needed to determine the effective B-SES combined with 
regular physiotherapy for minor amputation.

METHODS: Seventy-seven patients with chronic knee osteoarthritis pain received 
ultrasound-guided ACB with 14 ml 0.25% levobupivacaine and 100 mcg clonidine. At 
baseline and 1 month after the blockade, we assessed maximal and minimal pain 
intensity in the knee using a numeric rating scale (NRS) and the Knee Injury and 
Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS). The range of motion in extension and 
flexion (ROMext and ROMflex) and quadriceps muscle strength of both knees (QS), 
Timed Up and Go Test (TUG), and 30-Second Chair Stand Test (30CST) results were 
determined at baseline, 1 hour, 1 week, and 1 month after the blockade.
RESULTS: ACB with levobupivacaine and clonidine appeared to decrease pain 
severity (NRSmax 8.13 to 4.2, p < 0.001 and NRSmin 3.32 to 1.40, p < 0.001). 
Similarly, knee ROMext decreased from 3.90 preintervention to 2.89 
postintervention at 1 month, p < 0.001; ROMflex decreased from 5.70 to 3.29, p < 
0.001; TUG time decreased from 3.22 to 2.93, <0.001; QS increased from 18.43 to 
22.77, p < 0.001; CST increased from 8.23 to 10.74, p < 0.001. The KOOS for pain 
(36.40 to 58.34), symptoms (52.55 to 64.32), activities of daily living 
functions (ADLs, 36.36 to 60.77), and quality of life (QoL, 17.87 to 30.97) also 
increased, all p < 0.001.
CONCLUSION: ACB appeared to decrease pain and increase ambulation. If our 
preliminary results are reproducible in a planned randomized controlled trial, 
ACB could be a useful adjunctive pain therapy in patients with disabling pain 
due to knee OA.

BACKGROUND: Use of an antibiotic-eluting envelope (AEE) during cardiac 
implantable electronic device procedures reduces infection risk but increases 
procedural costs. We aim to estimate the cost-effectiveness of AEE use during 
cardiac implantable electronic device procedures among patients with heart 
failure.
METHODS: A state-transition cohort model of heart failure patients undergoing 
cardiac implantable electronic device implantation or generator replacement was 
developed with input parameters estimated from randomized trials, registries, 
surveys, and claims data. Effectiveness was estimated from the World-Wide 
Randomized Antibiotic Envelope Infection Prevention Trial. AEE was assumed to 
cost $953 per unit. The model projected mortality, quality-adjusted life-years, 
costs, and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of AEE use compared with 
usual care from a US healthcare sector perspective over a lifetime horizon. We 
assumed a cost-effectiveness threshold of $100 000 per quality-adjusted 
life-year gained.
RESULTS: Compared with usual care, AEE use in initial implantations produced an 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $112 000 per quality-adjusted life-year 
gained (39% probability of being cost-effective). In generator replacement 
procedures, AEE use produced an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $54 000 
per quality-adjusted life-year gained (84% probability of being cost-effective). 
Results were sensitive to the underlying rate of infection, cost of the AEE, and 
durability of AEE effectiveness.
CONCLUSIONS: Universal AEE use for cardiac implantable electronic device 
procedures in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction is 
unlikely to be cost-effective, reinforcing the need for individualized risk 
assessment to guide uptake of the AEE in clinical practice. Selective use in 
patients at increased risk of infection, such as those undergoing generator 
replacement procedures, is more likely to meet health system value benchmarks.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The growing burden of diabetes mellitus and recent progress 
in understanding cardiovascular outcomes for type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients 
continue to make the disease a priority for healthcare decision-makers around 
the world. Our objective was to develop a new, product-independent model capable 
of projecting long-term clinical and cost outcomes for populations with T2D to 
support health economic evaluation.
METHODS: Following a systematic literature review to identify longitudinal study 
data, existing T2D models and risk formulae for T2D populations, a model was 
developed (the PRIME Type 2 Diabetes Model [PRIME T2D Model]) in line with good 
practice guidelines to simulate disease progression, diabetes-related 
complications and mortality. The model runs as a patient-level simulation and is 
capable of simulating treatment algorithms and risk factor progression, and 
projecting the cumulative incidence of macrovascular and microvascular 
complications as well as hypoglycemic events. The PRIME T2D Model can report 
clinical outcomes, quality-adjusted life expectancy, direct and indirect costs, 
along with standard measures of cost-effectiveness and is capable of 
probabilistic sensitivity analysis. Several approaches novel to T2D modeling 
were utilized, such as combining risk formulae using a weighted model averaging 
approach that takes into account patient characteristics to evaluate 
complication risk.
RESULTS: Validation analyses comparing modeled outcomes with published studies 
demonstrated that the PRIME T2D Model projects long-term patient outcomes 
consistent with those reported for a number of long-term studies, including 
cardiovascular outcomes trials. All root mean squared deviation (RMSD) values 
for internal validations (against published studies used to develop the model) 
were 1.1% or less and all external validation RMSDs were 3.7% or less.
CONCLUSIONS: The PRIME T2D Model is a product-independent analysis tool that is 
available online and offers new approaches to long-standing challenges in 
diabetes modeling and may become a useful tool for informing healthcare 
policy.HIGHLIGHTSThe PRIME Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) Model is a new, 
product-independent simulation model.The model offers new approaches to 
long-standing challenges in diabetes modeling.PRIME T2D Model projects outcomes 
consistent with those from clinical trials.The model is designed to be a useful 
tool for informing healthcare policy in T2D.

The US opioid crisis came in three waves - prescription opioids, heroin, and 
illicitly manufactured fentanyls - Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention resulting in the deaths of nearly 
500,000 people from 1996 to 2019. In 2009, drug overdose deaths exceeded those 
involving automobiles. Opioid overdose deaths contributed to the decrease in 
life expectancy for Americans from 78.8 to 78.5 during 2014 to 2017. The 
overprescribing of a schedule II prescription opioid was escalated by 
pharmaceutical companies promoting a growing belief that pain was an 
undertreated condition. In 2012, the number of opioid prescriptions peaked at 
255 million and deaths exceeded 11,000 per year. The typical prescription opioid 
abuser was white, male, and 45-55 years of age. The hardest-hit states were in 
Appalachia and the Northeast. When an abuse-resistant formulation was introduced 
for OxyContin, the most prevalent prescription opioid, users turned to heroin. 
From the early 1980s, a new pizza delivery style of Mexican trafficking in black 
tar heroin infiltrated many of the same states hit hardest by prescription 
opioids. Heroin overdose deaths reached 14,495 in 2017. As heroin abuse 
increased in states supplied with black tar heroin, fentanyl-contaminated white 
powder heroin began to appear in the Northeast. Fentanyl was quickly followed by 
fentanyl analogs. While heroin deaths continued to escalate through 2017, they 
were soon overshadowed by fentanyl overdose deaths. Finally, prescription opioid 
and heroin overdose deaths started to decline in 2017, though fentanyl deaths 
continued to increase. In late 2019, it appeared that restrictions on 
transportation and travel due to the COVID-19 pandemic had resulted in decreased 
availability of illicit drugs, but by 2020 drug abuse had escalated in many 
countries. Globally, heroin was the primary opioid of abuse and only a few 
countries - including Canada, Germany, Austria, and Belgium - have experienced a 
significant increase in prescription opioids. However, illicitly manufactured 
fentanyls are a growing problem in North America, Europe, Australia, and Asia.

INTRODUCTION: The instituted elderly in nursing home need professional support 
targeting to maintain their daily activities and quality of life. Social support 
affects the health of elderly through its influence as a stress buffering or 
main effects on emotions, cognitions and behaviour that improve health outcomes. 
Understanding and identifying available interventions for the elderly in the 
literature related to integrating social support into interventions will be 
benefits to guide future practice, research and policy.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A scoping review designed by Arksey and O'Malley has been 
used in this study. Key words, inclusion and exclusion criteria were elaborated 
to search the primary articles that published in English from 2010 to 2021 
mainly from PubMed, Science Direct, Public Library of Science, SocioHub, Wiley 
Online Library and PsycINFO databases targeting to reach the selected articles 
and combined the results with reference lists and hand searches. The Mixed 
Methods Appraisal Tool version 2018 will be used to identify the quality of the 
studies. Authors developed the Data Extraction Form for data extraction and 
analysis. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses 
extension for Scoping Reviews tool will be employed for reporting guideline.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Authors forecast to obtain relevant studies reporting 
integrating specific dimensions of supportive functions into interventions for 
the elderly in nursing home. This finding will benefit in quality improvement of 
supportive interventions in nursing home and to continue the further 
experimental study. The findings will be disseminated via electronic and hard 
copy through peer-reviewed publications, conference presentations and internal 
organisation meeting.

COVID 19 has exacerbated and underscored structural inequalities and endemic 
vulnerabilities in food, economic, and social systems, compounding concerns 
about environmental sustainability and racial and economic justice. Convergent 
crises have amplified a growing chorus of voices and movements calling for new 
thinking and new practices to adapt to these shifts, mitigate their impact, and 
address their root causes through far reaching changes in social and economic 
life and values, including breaking with the free market paradigm. In the face 
of a historic choice between transition or multiple systems collapse that deepen 
injustice and threaten planetary survival, I make the case for expanding on 
liberatory tendencies in Extension programs to build capacities for 
response-ability to transition toward more just and sustainable futures.

route is a significant risk factor for anastomotic disorder after McKeown 
esophagectomy.

BACKGROUND: Anastomotic disorder of the reconstructed gastric conduit is a 
life-threating morbidity after thoracic esophagectomy. Although there are 
various reasons for anastomotic disorder, the present study focused on 
dislocation of the gastric conduit (DGC).
METHODS: The study cohort comprised 149 patients who underwent transthoracic 
esophagectomy. The relationships between DGC and peri- and postoperative 
morbidities were analyzed retrospectively. Data were analyzed to determine 
whether body mass index (BMI) and extension of the gastric conduit were related 
to DGC. Uni- and multivariate Cox regression analyses were performed to identify 
the factors associated with anastomotic disorder.
RESULTS: DGC was significantly related to anastomotic leakage (P < .001), 
anastomotic stricture (P = .018), and mediastinal abscess/empyema (P = .031). 
Compared with the DGC-negative group, the DGC-positive group had a significantly 
larger mean preoperative BMI (23.01 ± 3.26 kg/m2 vs. 21.22 ± 3.13 kg/m2, 
P = .001) and mean maximum cross-sectional area of the gastric conduit 
(1024.75 ± 550.43 mm2 vs. 619.46 ± 263.70 mm2, P < .001). Multivariate analysis 
revealed that DGC was an independent risk factor for anastomotic leakage (odds 
ratio: 4.840, 95% confidence interval: 1.770-13.30, P < .001). Body weight 
recovery tended to be better in the DGC-negative group than in the DGC-positive 
group, although this intergroup difference was not significant.
CONCLUSION: DGC reconstructed via the posterior mediastinal route is a 
significant cause of critical morbidities related to anastomosis. In particular, 
care is required when performing gastric conduit reconstruction via the 
posterior mediastinal route in patients with a high BMI.

OBJECTIVES: Previous research in the United States suggests contextual income 
mobility may play a role in explaining the disparities between life expectancy 
in the United States and peer countries. This article aims to extend previous 
research by estimating the consequences of average individual exposure to 
mobility regimes during childhood and adolescence on adult health.
METHODS: This study draws its data from two longitudinal datasets that track the 
county of residence of respondents during childhood and adolescence, the Panel 
Study of Income Dynamics and the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997. We 
implement marginal structural models to assess the association of the average 
exposure to county income mobility on five health outcomes and behaviors.
RESULTS: The results are only partially consistent with a systematic association 
between exposure to income mobility and health outcomes. Evidence obtained from 
the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth suggests less income mobility might 
increase the probability of smoking by age 30.
DISCUSSION: The paper provides a precise assessment of the hypothesis that 
childhood exposure to income mobility regimes may influence health status 
through behavior later in life and contribute to longevity gaps. Only partial 
evidence on smoking suggests an association between income mobility and health, 
so we discuss potential reasons for the disparities in results with previous 
research.
