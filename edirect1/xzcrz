INTRODUCTION: 'One-off' systematic case-finding for COPD using a respiratory 
screening questionnaire is more effective and cost-effective than routine care 
at identifying new cases. However, it is not known whether early diagnosis and 
treatment is beneficial in the longer term. We estimated the long-term 
cost-effectiveness of a regular case-finding programme in primary care.
METHODS: A Markov decision analytic model was developed to compare the 
cost-effectiveness of a 3-yearly systematic case-finding programme targeted to 
ever smokers aged ≥50 years with the current routine diagnostic process in UK 
primary care. Patient-level data on case-finding pathways was obtained from a 
large randomised controlled trial. Information on the natural history of COPD 
and treatment effects was obtained from a linked COPD cohort, UK primary care 
database and published literature. The discounted lifetime cost per 
quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained was calculated from a health service 
perspective.
RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of systematic case-finding 
versus current care was £16 596 per additional QALY gained, with a 78% 
probability of cost-effectiveness at a £20 000 per QALY willingness-to-pay 
threshold. The base case result was robust to multiple one-way sensitivity 
analyses. The main drivers were response rate to the initial screening 
questionnaire and attendance rate for the confirmatory spirometry test.
DISCUSSION: Regular systematic case-finding for COPD using a screening 
questionnaire in primary care is likely to be cost-effective in the long-term 
despite uncertainties in treatment effectiveness. Further knowledge of the 
natural history of case-found patients and the effectiveness of their management 
will improve confidence to implement such an approach.

Screening for new primary cancers in patients with metastatic breast cancer: a 
provincial analysis of the Choosing Wisely Canada recommendations.

Newfoundland, St. John's, NL.

INTRODUCTION: Patients with metastatic cancer have a decreased life expectancy, 
and with screening and surveillance for new primary cancers, they run the risk 
of immediate harm with little chance of any benefit. Choosing Wisely Canada 
therefore recommends that such investigations be avoided in patients with 
metastatic disease.
METHODS: We examined cancer screening practices in a subset of patients with 
metastatic cancer in Newfoundland and Labrador. Patients with metastatic breast 
cancer seen at the provincial cancer clinic during 2014-2016 were identified 
from the Newfoundland and Labrador Cancer Registry. For each patient, we 
assessed whether any one or a combination of screening mammography, Pap 
(Papanicolaou) test, flexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy, or fecal 
immunohistochemical test were performed at any point after the diagnosis of 
metastatic disease.
RESULTS: Of 305 patients with metastatic breast cancer, 114 (37.4%) underwent at 
least 1 screening investigation (mean: 2.92 investigations per screened 
patient). The most common screening investigations were mammography (n = 197) 
and Pap test (n = 107). Primary care providers ordered most of the screening 
investigations (70%); oncology specialists ordered 14%, and other specialists, 
12%. Median overall survival for patients with breast cancer after a diagnosis 
of metastatic disease was 42 months, with a 5-year overall survival of 35.9%.
CONCLUSIONS: A significant proportion of patients with metastatic breast cancer 
in Newfoundland and Labrador are still undergoing screening for new primary 
malignancies, which is discordant with oncology guidelines from Choosing Wisely 
Canada. Increased education strategies are needed if the Choosing Wisely Canada 
recommendations are to be implemented into routine clinical practice.

Mechanical versus bioprosthetic valves in patients on dialysis.

Chan PG(1), Sultan I(1), Gleason TG(1), Navid F(1), Kilic A(1).

Author information:

Pennsylvania, USA.

BACKGROUND: The aim of this study is to evaluate the outcomes of bioprosthetic 
versus mechanical valves in patients on dialysis.
METHODS: All patients who underwent aortic (AVR) or mitral valve replacement 
(MVR) at a single institution from 2011-2017 were reviewed. Primary 
stratification was bioprosthetic versus mechanical valves. The primary outcome 
was all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes included hospital readmission, valve 
reoperation rates and bleeding events. Kaplan-Meier curves were generated and 
Cox proportional hazards regression models were used for risk-adjustment.
RESULTS: During the study period, 3,969 patients underwent AVR or MVR, of which 
97 (2.4%) were on dialysis. In dialysis patients, unadjusted 30-day mortality 
was comparable between bioprosthetic (12.7%) versus mechanical (5.9%) valves 
(P=0.31). However, the bioprosthetic group had higher rates of 1-year (40.3% 
versus 15.2%; P=0.03) and 5-year mortality (67.9% versus 60.7%; P=0.02). Most 
patients were readmitted within 5 years with no differences between the groups 
(bioprosthetic 80.3% versus mechanical 100%; P=0.57). There were no valve 
reoperations in either group at 5 years. The 5-year readmission rate was higher 
in the mechanical cohort (10.5% versus 53.8%; P=0.05). Risk-adjusted analysis 
confirmed these findings, where mechanical valves were independently associated 
with reduced mortality at 1-year and 5-years.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite the limited life expectancy of patients on dialysis, 
mechanical valves have an intermediate term mortality benefit compared to 
bioprosthetic valves. This comes at the expense of a higher rate of readmission 
for bleeding. Although valve choice should consider multiple factors, these data 
suggest that mechanical valve usage in dialysis patients is reasonable.

Total knee arthroplasty in osteogenesis imperfecta.

Brand J(1), Tyagi V(1), Rubin L(1).

Author information:
(1)Yale New Haven Hospital New Haven, CT, USA.

Osteogenesis imperfecta is a genetic disease resulting in abnormal collagen 
formation, with multiple clinical manifestations. Advancements in medical and 
surgical treatments have prolonged the life expectancy of these patients in 
recent decades. As a result, orthopedic surgeons are likely to be faced with the 
challenge of performing arthroplasty in these patients on a more frequent basis. 
Here, we describe a patient with osteogenesis imperfecta and subsequent severe 
osteoarthritis prompting primary total knee arthroplasty. This rare case 
presents an opportunity to explore special considerations unique to this patient 
population, including comorbid bone defects, the need for using extramedullary 
guides, careful alignment of prostheses to accommodate abnormalities in limb 
axes, and equipment utilization.

The fusion of an Fc moiety to a therapeutic protein is widely applied as a 
half-life extension strategy. However, unlike monoclonal antibodies, Fc-fusion 
proteins have been shown to be more susceptible to protease-mediated catabolism. 
The resultant catabolites may still be pharmacologically active and therefore 
require characterization. We combined intact protein LC-MS and digestion 
LC-MS/MS methods to both characterize the biotransformation of the fusion 
protein, Fc-FGF21, and quantify the intact molecule and its major catabolites in 
rat serum. The digestion LC-MS/MS assay and intact protein LC-MS assay 
determined that there were four major catabolites formed in vivo: one amino acid 
(dC1), two amino acids (dC2), or three amino acids (dC3) clipped off from the 
C-terminus, and a truncated fragment. By 72 h post dosing, only 66% of the 
intact protein remained. The digestion method was developed with a sensitivity 
of 20 ng/mL-10 times more sensitive than the intact protein method at 200 ng/mL. 
While the digestion approach proved more sensitive, the intact LC-MS method was 
primarily employed for understanding the biotransformation of the Fc-FGF21 
fusion protein in the rat in vivo study. Graphical abstract.

PURPOSE: To evaluate the long-term effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a 
supervised 18-week high-intensity exercise program compared with usual care in 
patients treated with autologous stem cell transplantation.
METHODS: One hundred nine patients were randomly assigned to the exercise 
intervention (n = 54) or the usual care control group (n = 55). Data on 
cardiorespiratory fitness (VO2peak), handgrip strength, general fatigue, and 
health-related quality of life (quality-adjusted life years [QALYs]) were 
collected at baseline (T0), after completion of the exercise intervention or at 
a similar time point in the control group (T1) and 12 months later (T2). Cost 
questionnaires were used to assess societal costs. Long-term effectiveness (at 
T2) was evaluated using linear mixed model analyses. For the economic 
evaluation, missing data were imputed using multiple imputation, and data were 
analyzed using linear mixed models.
RESULTS: At T2, no statistically significant differences were found between the 
intervention and control group for VO2peak (0.12; 95%CI - 1.89; 2.14 ml/min/kg), 
handgrip strength (- 1.08; 95%CI- 2.47; 2.31), and general fatigue (- 0.69; 
95%CI - 2.52; 1.14). During 12-months follow-up, no significant between-group 
differences in QALYs and societal costs were found (QALYs - 0.07; 95%CI - 0.17; 
0.04; costs 529; 95%CI - 3205;4452). Intervention costs were €1340 per patient. 
For all outcomes, the probability of the intervention being cost-effective was 
low at reasonable values of willingness-to-pay.
CONCLUSION: We found no evidence for the exercise intervention being effective 
on physical fitness and fatigue, nor cost-effective from a societal perspective.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study was prospectively registered on 27 May 2010 at the 
Netherlands Trial Register ( NTR2341 ).
IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: The current exercise intervention should not 
be recommended to patients recently treated with autologous stem cell 
transplantation.

Researchers involved in community-based participatory research often face 
challenges due to numerous dynamic factors, including the physical location of 
the study population, willingness to participate, language barriers, cultural 
norms, social stigmas, and unpredictable weather and other disasters. 
Investigators who work with commercial fishermen are all too familiar with these 
potential obstacles and barriers to performing occupational safety and health 
research. Such has been the case along the Texas and Louisiana gulf coasts, 
where the burden of occupational fatalities in the shrimp fishery remains high. 
Moreover, the need for strategic community, regulatory agency, and research 
partnerships in order to explore solutions that can help to reduce this burden 
is ongoing. The IFISH 5 conference and the panel session described in this brief 
report offered a venue to acknowledge and create awareness of these barriers and 
opportunities for developing sustainable solutions that can have an impact on 
this loss of life. The approach taken was to explore the perspectives of a panel 
of regional collaborators including two researchers, an outreach community 
liaison, and a marine safety and health official from the U. S. Coast Guard. Key 
barriers emerging from the panel fell into four themes, each emphasized by one 
of the four panel members, allowing for discussion of potential solutions. The 
themes included: (1) language gap; (2) cultural influences and use of personal 
flotation devices; (3) relationships with the community; and (4) enforcement 
agency role as a trusted opinion leader. This panel session can readily serve as 
a model to promote similar exploration of barriers and solutions in commercial 
fishing across other regions of the US and internationally as well.

BACKGROUND: Delay to start antiretroviral therapy (ART) and nonadherence 
compromise the health and wellbeing of people living with HIV (PLWH), raise the 
cost of care and increase risk of transmission to sexual partners. To date, 
interventions to improve adherence to ART have had limited success, perhaps 
because they have failed to systematically elicit and address both perceptual 
and practical barriers to adherence. The primary aim of this study is to 
determine the efficacy of the Supporting UPtake and Adherence (SUPA) 
intervention.
METHODS: This study comprises 2 phases. Phase 1 is an observational cohort 
study, in which PLWH who are ART naïve and recommended to take ART by their 
clinician complete a questionnaire assessing their beliefs about ART over 
12 months. Phase 2 is a randomised controlled trial (RCT) nested within the 
observational cohort study to investigate the effectiveness of the SUPA 
intervention on adherence to ART. PLWH at risk of nonadherence (based on their 
beliefs about ART) will be recruited and randomised 1:1 to the intervention 
(SUPA intervention + usual care) and control (usual care) arms. The SUPA 
intervention involves 4 tailored treatment support sessions delivered by a 
Research Nurse utilising a collaborative Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) and 
Motivational Interviewing (MI) approach. Sessions are tailored to individual 
needs and preferences based on the individual patient's perceptions and 
practical barriers to ART. An animation series and intervention manual have been 
developed to communicate a rationale for the personal necessity for ART and 
illustrate concerns and potential solutions. The primary outcome is adherence to 
ART measured using Medication Event Monitoring System (MEMS). Three hundred 
seventy-two patients will be sufficient to detect a 15% difference in adherence 
with 80% power and an alpha of 0.05. Costs will be compared between intervention 
and control groups. Costs will be combined with the primary outcome in 
cost-effectiveness analyses. Quality adjusted life-years (QALYs) will also be 
estimated over the follow-up period and used in the analyses.
DISCUSSION: The findings will enable patients, healthcare providers and policy 
makers to make informed decisions about the value of the SUPA intervention.

OBJECTIVE: We take advantage of a rare occurrence when two different studies 
report on the estimation of quality of life utilities for the same health states 
to assess convergence of the reported measures. Health state utilities are 
important inputs into health economic models that estimate the impact of new 
medical technologies using a common metric of health gain-the quality adjusted 
life-year.
RESULTS: We find low concordance between the two measures which is concerning in 
that this could have important ramifications for health care decision making 
based on estimated cost-effectiveness. We explore possible reasons for the 
discrepancy between the two measures and draw implications for the design of 
future studies.

BACKGROUND: There is no good evidence to support the use of patient-reported 
outcome measures (PROMs) in setting preoperative thresholds for referral for hip 
and knee replacement surgery. Despite this, the practice is widespread in the 
NHS.
OBJECTIVES/RESEARCH QUESTIONS: Can clinical outcome tools be used to set 
thresholds for hip or knee replacement? What is the relationship between the 
choice of threshold and the cost-effectiveness of surgery?
METHODS: A systematic review identified PROMs used to assess patients undergoing 
hip/knee replacement. Their measurement properties were compared and 
supplemented by analysis of existing data sets. For each candidate score, we 
calculated the absolute threshold (a preoperative level above which there is no 
potential for improvement) and relative thresholds (preoperative levels above 
which individuals are less likely to improve than others). Owing to their 
measurement properties and the availability of data from their current 
widespread use in the NHS, the Oxford Knee Score (OKS) and Oxford Hip Score 
(OHS) were selected as the most appropriate scores to use in developing the 
Arthroplasty Candidacy Help Engine (ACHE) tool. The change in score and the 
probability of an improvement were then calculated and modelled using 
preoperative and postoperative OKS/OHSs and PROM scores, thereby creating the 
ACHE tool. Markov models were used to assess the cost-effectiveness of total 
hip/knee arthroplasty in the NHS for different preoperative values of OKS/OHSs 
over a 10-year period. The threshold values were used to model how the ACHE tool 
may change the number of referrals in a single UK musculoskeletal hub. A user 
group was established that included patients, members of the public and 
health-care representatives, to provide stakeholder feedback throughout the 
research process.
RESULTS: From a shortlist of four scores, the OHS and OKS were selected for the 
ACHE tool based on their measurement properties, calculated preoperative 
thresholds and cost-effectiveness data. The absolute threshold was 40 for the 
OHS and 41 for the OKS using the preferred improvement criterion. A range of 
relative thresholds were calculated based on the relationship between a 
patient's preoperative score and their probability of improving after surgery. 
For example, a preoperative OHS of 35 or an OKS of 30 translates to a 75% 
probability of achieving a good outcome from surgical intervention. The economic 
evaluation demonstrated that hip and knee arthroplasty cost of < £20,000 per 
quality-adjusted life-year for patients with any preoperative score below the 
absolute thresholds (40 for the OHS and 41 for the OKS). Arthroplasty was most 
cost-effective for patients with lower preoperative scores.
LIMITATIONS: The ACHE tool supports but does not replace the shared 
decision-making process required before an individual decides whether or not to 
undergo surgery.
CONCLUSION: The OHS and OKS can be used in the ACHE tool to assess an individual 
patient's suitability for hip/knee replacement surgery. The system enables 
evidence-based and informed threshold setting in accordance with local resources 
and policies. At a population level, both hip and knee arthroplasty are highly 
cost-effective right up to the absolute threshold for intervention. Our 
stakeholder user group felt that the ACHE tool was a useful evidence-based 
clinical tool to aid referrals and that it should be trialled in NHS clinical 
practice to establish its feasibility.
FUTURE WORK: Future work could include (1) a real-world study of the ACHE tool 
to determine its acceptability to patients and general practitioners and (2) a 
study of the role of the ACHE tool in supporting referral decisions.
FUNDING: The National Institute for Health Research Health Technology Assessment 
programme.

Plain Language Summary: Patients with severe hip and knee arthritis may require 
joint replacement. General practitioners make the decision to refer patients to 
hospital based on an assessment of their symptoms. Pain and function can be 
measured using patient questionnaires and the questionnaire scores can indicate 
whether or not the severity of disease warrants referral (i.e. whether or not 
the patient is a candidate for joint replacement based on their ‘capacity to 
benefit’). However, we do not know whether or not basing treatment decisions on 
such scores is correct, nor do we know what exact pain score thresholds should 
be used for referral. After a thorough search, we found that the Oxford Hip and 
Knee Scores were the best instruments. A high score (i.e. a maximum score of 48) 
indicates less pain and better function. The threshold values for referral for 
surgery were scores of 40 for hips and 41 for knees. The process of evaluating 
scoring systems, the choice of scoring systems and the threshold values were 
discussed and agreed by a panel of patients and by doctors throughout the study. 
Most patients with severe joint pain benefit from joint replacement, and these 
operations are cost-effective. However, above a certain level (a score of 40 for 
hips and 41 for knees), patients are not thought to typically benefit from 
surgery. Below these values, lower presurgery scores indicate a steadily 
increasing likelihood of benefit in terms of reduced pain and better function. 
This information provides the basis for a tool to help doctors decide who to 
refer for joint replacement: the Arthroplasty Candidacy Help Engine (ACHE). Use 
of the ACHE tool prevents patients who are unlikely to benefit from joint 
replacement being referred unnecessarily and allows the NHS to concentrate 
resources on those who will benefit most from arthroplasty treatment.

WHAT IS KNOWN ON THE SUBJECT?: People with severe mental illness (SMI) have a 
life expectancy of 15-20 years less than the general population, partly due to 
increased risk of physical disease, including type II diabetes (T2DM) and 
cardiovascular disease. Little is known about changes in cardiovascular risk 
factors over time in people with both T2DM and SMI compared to those with T2DM 
and no SMI. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS TO EXISTING KNOWLEDGE?: We investigated whether 
levels of cardiovascular risk factors, cholesterol, HbA1c, systolic and 
diastolic blood pressure associated with adverse clinical outcomes are different 
in T2DM patients with and without SMI. We found significant differences in 
systolic blood pressure and HbA1c between the two groups. Fifty-five percent and 
twenty-nine percent of T2DM patients with comorbid SMI are at increased risk of 
adverse clinical outcomes due to sub-optimal HbA1c and systolic blood pressure 
levels, respectively. WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE?: Many patients 
with T2DM and SMI have higher levels of cardiovascular risk compared to patients 
with T2DM only, and good management of risk factors is therefore particularly 
important in patients with both conditions. Achieving better control of HbA1c 
levels is likely to be central to addressing inequalities in outcomes for 
patients with both SMI and T2DM. Abstract Introduction Patients with both severe 
mental illness (SMI) and type II diabetes (T2DM) have lower life expectancy than 
patients with T2DM alone, partly due to poor control of cardiovascular risk 
factors in comorbid patients. Aim To compare levels of cholesterol, HbA1c and 
blood pressure in T2DM patients with and without SMI. Method We analysed 
longitudinal clinical records of 30,353 people with T2DM (657 with SMI; 29,696 
controls without SMI) between 2001 and 2013 using the Clinical Practice Research 
Datalink (CPRD). We used mixed-effects regression models to compare 
cardiovascular risk factors between SMI and controls. Results Patients with SMI 
had lower mean systolic blood pressure (SBP; β: -2.49; SE = .45 p = <.01) and 
were more likely to have extreme (high and low) values of HbA1c and SBP (OR: 
1.38, 95% CI: 1.16, 1.64 and 1.76:1.40, 2.21, respectively). Discussion People 
with T2DM and SMI have similar average values of cardiovascular risk factors to 
people with T2DM alone but are more likely to have values of HbA1c and SBP 
indicating increased risk of adverse clinical outcomes. Implications for 
Practice Improved management of cardiovascular risk factors in general, 
glycaemic control in particular, is central to addressing the increased risk of 
adverse outcomes in people with both SMI and T2DM.

BACKGROUND: Cancer contributes substantially to the life expectancy gap between 
US blacks and whites, and racial cancer disparities remain stubborn to 
eradicate. Disparities vary geographically, suggesting that they are not 
inevitable.
METHODS: The authors examined the relationship between housing discrimination 
and the size of cancer disparities across large US metropolitan statistical 
areas (MSAs). MSA-level cancer disparities were measured using data from the US 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Mortgage discrimination for each MSA 
was estimated using the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act database, and MSA racial 
segregation was determined using US Census data. Patterns of housing 
discrimination and cancer disparities were mapped, and the associations between 
these place-based factors and cancer disparities across MSAs were measured.
RESULTS: Black-to-white cancer mortality disparities (rate ratios) varied 
geographically, ranging from 1.50 to 0.86; 88% of mortality ratios were >1, 
indicating higher mortality for blacks. In areas with greater mortgage 
discrimination, the gap between black and white cancer mortality rates was 
larger (correlation coefficient [r] = 0.32; P = .001). This relationship 
persisted in sex-specific analyses (males, r = 0.37; P < .001; females, 
r = 0.23; P = .02) and in models controlling for confounders. In contrast, 
segregation was inconsistently associated with disparities. Adjusting for 
incidence disparities attenuated, but did not eliminate, the correlation between 
mortgage discrimination and mortality disparities (r = 0.22-0.24), suggesting 
that cancer incidence and survival each account for part of the mortality 
disparity.
CONCLUSIONS: Mortgage discrimination is associated with larger black-to-white 
cancer mortality disparities. Some areas are exceptions to this trend. 
Examination of these exceptions and of policies related to housing 
discrimination may offer novel strategies for explaining and eliminating cancer 
disparities.

A typical feature of eukaryotic aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRSs) is the 
evolutionary gain of domains at either the N- or C-terminus, which frequently 
mediating protein-protein interaction. TARSL2 (mouse Tarsl2), encoding a 
threonyl-tRNA synthetase-like protein (ThrRS-L), is a recently identified 
aaRS-duplicated gene in higher eukaryotes, with canonical functions in vitro, 
which exhibits a different N-terminal extension (N-extension) from TARS 
(encoding ThrRS). We found the first half of the N-extension of human ThrRS-L 
(hThrRS-L) is homologous to that of human arginyl-tRNA synthetase. Using the 
N-extension as a probe in a yeast two-hybrid screening, AIMP1/p43 was identified 
as an interactor with hThrRS-L. We showed that ThrRS-L is a novel component of 
the mammalian multiple tRNA synthetase complex (MSC), and is reliant on two 
leucine zippers in the N-extension for MSC-incorporation in humans, and mouse 
cell lines and muscle tissue. The N-extension was sufficient to target a foreign 
protein into the MSC. The results from a Tarsl2-deleted cell line showed that it 
does not mediate MSC integrity. The effect of phosphorylation at various sites 
of hThrRS-L on its MSC-targeting is also explored. In summary, we revealed that 
ThrRS-L is a bona fide component of the MSC, which is mediated by a newly 
evolved N-extension domain.

OBJECTIVES: As life expectancy continues to rise, the burden of cardiovascular 
disease among older people is expected to increase, making cardiovascular 
prevention in older people an issue of growing interest and public health 
importance. We aimed to explore the long-term effects of adherence to statins on 
mortality and cardiovascular morbidity among older adults.
DESIGN: A historical population-based cohort study using routinely collected 
data.
SETTING: Clalit Health Services Northern District.
PARTICIPANTS: We followed members of Clalit Health Services aged 65 years or 
older who were eligible for primary cardiovascular prevention for a period of 
10 years.
MEASUREMENTS: We fitted Cox regression models to assess the association between 
the adherence to statin therapy and all-cause mortality and cardiovascular 
morbidity, adjusting for cardiovascular risk factors and associated morbidity as 
time-updated variables.
RESULTS: The analysis included 19 518 older adults followed during 10 years 
(median = 9.7 y). All-cause mortality rates were 34% lower among those who had 
adhered to statin treatment, compared with those who had not (hazard ratio [HR] 
= .66; 95% confidence interval [CI] = .56-.79). Adherence to statins was also 
associated with fewer atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease events (HR = .80; 
95% CI = .71-.81). The benefit of statin use did not diminish among beyond age 
75 and was evident for both women and men.
CONCLUSION: Adherence to statins may be associated with reduced mortality and 
cardiovascular morbidity among older adults, regardless of age and sex. J Am

Patellar fractures account for approximately 1% of all skeletal fractures. These 
fractures are rare; however, because of the crucial function of the patella in 
the extensor mechanism of the knee, they may lead to serious impairment. New 
data are revealing functional impairment remains common even with improved 
surgical techniques. The aim of this study was to assess the functional outcomes 
of patients after revision surgery in cases of secondary fracture dislocation or 
persistent articular incongruity. This study included 16 patients with a mean 
age of 51.8 years (range: 16-85 years) with a mean follow-up of 35.1 months. 
According to the AO/OTA classification, 15 patients had a C-type fracture, 
including 10 patients with C3 fracture. Thirteen patients were initially treated 
with tension band wiring via K-wires or cannulated screws. Revision surgery was 
performed because of persistent articular incongruity in five patients and 
secondary fracture dislocation or refracture in 11 patients. We analyzed pain 
(visual analog scale [0-10]), satisfaction, range of motion (ROM), Böstman's 
score, Lysholm's score, and knee injury and osteoarthritis outcome score (KOOS) 
after revision surgery and could extract follow-up data from 15 patients. Mean 
pain score at rest was 0.57 (range: 0-3.5) and on exertion 2.79 (range: 0-8). 
The measurement of the ROM of the affected knee compared with that of the 
opposite knee revealed complete extension. Mean flexion was 123 degrees, in the 
corresponding knee it was 136 degrees (p = 0.05). The mean postoperative 
Böstman's and Lysholm's scores were 25.11 (good, maximum: 30) and 78.67 
(moderate, maximum: 100), respectively. KOOS was as follows: symptoms, 66.8 
points; pain, 77.55 points; activity of daily living (ADL), 75.67 points; and 
quality of life, 56.25 points. The results of this study suggested that early 
revision surgery after failure of primary osteosynthesis with secondary anatomic 
reconstruction and good radiological results leads to satisfactory functional 
outcomes with persistent functional deficits.

Objective: To evaluate the cost-benefit and cost-effectiveness of current 
strategy for preventing mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) of hepatitis B 
virus. Methods: A decision tree model with the Markov process was developed and 
simulated over the lifetime of a birth cohort in Zhejiang Province in 2016. The 
current PMTCT strategy was compared with universal vaccination and 
non-vaccination. Costs were assessed from social perspective. Benefits were the 
savings from reduced costs associated with disease and effectiveness were 
measured by quality-adjusted of life-years (QALY) gained. The net present value 
(NPV), cost-benefit ratio (BCR) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) 
were calculated. Univariate and Probabilistic Sensitivity Analyses (PSA) were 
performed to assess parameter uncertainties. The parameters of costs and 
utilities value of hepatitis B-related disease came from the results of the 
field survey, which were obtained by face-to-face questionnaire survey combined 
with inpatient medical records, including eight county and municipal hospitals 
in Jinhua, Jiaxing and Taizhou. A total of 626 outpatients and 523 inpatient 
patients were investigated. The annual total costs of infection was calculated 
by combining the costs of outpatient and inpatient. Results: The PMTCT strategy 
showed a net-gain as 38 323.78 CNY per person, with BCR as 21.10, which was 
higher than 36 357.80 CNY per person and 13.58 respectively of universal 
vaccination. Compared with universal vaccination, the PMTCT strategy would save 
2 787.07 CNY per additional QALY gained for every person, indicating that PMTCT 
would be cost-saving. The most important parameters that could affect BCR and 
ICER were the vaccine coverage rate and costs of hepatitis B related diseases 
respectively. The PSA showed the PMTCT strategy was preferable as it would gain 
more QALY and save costs. Conclusions: The PMTCT strategy appeared as highly 
cost-beneficial and highly cost-effective. High vaccination rate was a key 
factor of high economic value.

Objective: The objective of this study was to analyze the disease burden of 
influenza in schools and child care settings in rural areas of Hangzhou. 
Methods: Hospital visit influenza cases aged 3-17 years in hospitals that 
reported based on influenza surveillance system from 2016 to 2018 in Chun'an 
county, Hangzhou city were selected as study subjects and a total of 294 
confirmed cases of influenza were selected using system sampling method. 
Questionnaires were designed to investigate the basic information and data on 
inpatients and outpatients among, health care and life quality, etc.. Direct and 
indirect economic burden and disability adjusted life year (DALY) were analyzed 
and compared among different age groups. Results: The mean age of investigated 
subjects was (8.88±3.92) years. A total of 143 (48.64%) investigated cases were 
male. In total of 283 (96.26%) cases were outpatients. The total economic burden 
was 124 743.95 CNY. The mean economic burden was 424.30 CNY per person. The mean 
direct and indirect economic burden was 361.33 and 62.97 CNY per person 
respectively. The difference of the mean direct, indirect and total economic 
burden per person between different age group was statistically significant 
(P<0.001). The 3-5 years age group showed the highest economic burden with the 
median value of direct, indirect and total economic burden per person being 
276.24, 50.98 and 321.26 CNY, respectively, while the 12-17 years age group 
showed the lowest values with 175.30, 26.54, 201.79 CNY, respectively. The DALY 
of 294 influenza cases was 1.18, and the median of burden strength was 3.21 
DALY/thousand. The difference of the burden of strength between different age 
group influenza case was statistically significant (P<0.001), of which the 12-17 
years age group showed the highest value with 4.25 DALYs/thousand while the 3-5 
years age group showed the lowest value with 2.60 DALY/thousand. Conclusion: The 
disease burden of influenza was heavy in schools and kindergartens in rural 
areas of Hangzhou city, with the cases aged from 3 to 5 years showing higher 
economic burden and cases aged from 12 to 17 years showing greater burden 
strength.

743.95元人民币，人均总经济负担为424.30元人民币，人均直接和间接经济负担分别为361.33和62.97元人民币。不同年龄病例人均直接、间接、总经济负担之间的差异均有统计学意义（P值均<0.001），3~5岁组最高，M分别为276.34、50.98和321.26元人民币，12~17岁组最低，分别为175.30、26.54和201.79元人民币。调查对象损失的伤残调整生命年为1.18人年，负担强度M为3.21人年/千人，不同年龄病例间的负担强度差异有统计学意义（P<0.001），12~17岁组最大，为4.25人年/千人，3~5岁组最小，为2.60人年/千人。 
结论： 杭州市农村地区学校和幼托机构流感疾病负担较重，3~5岁儿童经济负担较重，12~17岁儿童负担强度较大。.

Gene therapy techniques and genetic knowledge may sufficiently advance, within 
the next few decades, to support prophylactic gene therapy for the prevention of 
polygenic late-onset diseases. The risk of these diseases may, hypothetically,
