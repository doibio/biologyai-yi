Atom Transfer Radical Polymerization (ATRP) is an important polymerization 
process in polymer synthesis. However, a typical ATRP system has some drawbacks. 
For example, it needs a large amount of transition metal catalyst, and it is 
difficult or expensive to remove the metal catalyst residue in products. In 
order to reduce the amount of catalyst and considering good biocompatibility and 
low toxicity of the iron catalyst, in this work, we developed a homogeneous 
polymerization system of initiators for continuous activator regeneration ATRP 
(ICAR ATRP) with just a ppm level of iron catalyst. Herein, we used oil-soluble 
iron (III) acetylacetonate (Fe(acac)₃) as the organometallic catalyst, 
1,1'-azobis (cyclohexanecarbonitrile) (ACHN) with longer half-life period as the 
thermal initiator, ethyl 2-bromophenylacetate (EBPA) as the initiator, 
triphenylphosphine (PPh₃) as the ligand, toluene as the solvent and methyl 
methacrylate (MMA) as the model monomer. The factors related with the 
polymerization system, such as concentration of Fe(acac)₃ and ACHN and 
polymerization kinetics, were investigated in detail at 90 °C. It was found that 
a polymer with an acceptable molecular weight distribution (Mw/Mn = 1.43 at 
45.9% of monomer conversion) could be obtained even with 1 ppm of Fe(acac)₃, 
making it needless to remove the residual metal in the resultant polymers, which 
makes such an ICAR ATRP process much more industrially attractive. The "living" 
features of this polymerization system were further confirmed by chain-extension 
experiment.

OBJECTIVES: Living donor kidney transplant relieves the disease burden of 
patients with end-stage renal disease but may shorten donor life expectancy; 
however, their quality of life (QOL) is preserved. Nevertheless, the magnitude 
of the net gain of this procedure is unknown. We evaluated the QOL of both 
donors and recipients concurrently and calculated the net utility gain.
METHODS: We recruited 210 subjects who visited the kidney transplantation clinic 
of a university hospital. Subjects were asked to complete the 5-level 
EQ-5D-based questionnaire, and patient characteristics were extracted from their 
medical records. We performed multivariate tobit models analysis to evaluate the 
QOL change caused by transplant surgery and subsequently ran computational 
simulations to determine the net utility gains of donors and recipients. We also 
performed sensitivity analyses.
RESULTS: After excluding 16 answers with missing data, we analyzed 203 answers 
in total. After the transplant surgery, recipients gained 0.07 in utility value 
while donors lost 0.04. In the net utility analysis, we found that the 
quality-adjusted life years gained ranged from 7.2 to 7.8 in the most favorable 
case observed in the combination of middle-aged recipients and elderly donors. 
Assuming no utility discount, the most favorable combination was that with older 
donors and younger recipients.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicated that the QOL improvement in recipients was 
larger than the loss among donors. When calculating the net utilities, a 
combination of middle-aged recipients and elderly donors yielded the largest net 
utility, but this was likely derived from assumption in the discount of QOL.

BACKGROUND: Adequate kidney donor management after donation is increasingly 
emphasized due to concerns of renal function impairment after nephrectomy with 
increasing life expectancy. In this study, the clinical impact of a protocolized 
kidney donor follow-up system by nephrologists was evaluated.
METHODS: A total of 427 living kidney donors underwent nephrectomy from January 
2010 to December 2014 and were followed for at least 2 years at the Samsung 
Medical Center. Donors were followed-up by nephrologists after the establishment 
of a donor clinic with systemized protocols in January 2013. The primary 
outcomes were incidence of post-donation low estimated glomerular filtration 
rate (eGFR) and renal function adaptability. Secondary outcomes were changes in 
compliance and incidence of hyperuricemia and microalbuminuria.
RESULTS: The patients were divided into 2 groups according to the time of 
nephrectomy: the pre-donor clinic period (n = 182) and the donor clinic period 
(n = 172). Preoperative eGFR in patients in the pre-donor clinic period was 
higher than that in patients in the donor clinic period. After donation, poor 
renal adaptation was less frequent in the donor clinic period compared to the 
pre-donor clinic period. Low eGFR tended to be less common during the donor 
clinic period. Shorter mean outpatient clinic visit intervals with more visits 
within 6 months after donation and earlier detection of de novo hyperuricemia 
were found during the donor clinic period.
CONCLUSION: A protocolized donor clinic run by nephrologists may improve 
post-nephrectomy renal outcomes and compliance and facilitate better management 
of potential risk factors of chronic kidney disease in donors.

Cost-utility analysis of offering a novel remunerated community pharmacist 
consultation service on influenza vaccination for seniors in Ontario, Canada.

Pullagura GR, Waite NM, Houle SKD, Violette R, Wong WWL.

BACKGROUND: Despite the availability of free and accessible influenza vaccine to 
all Ontarians, uptake has remained suboptimal. Although reasons to not receive 
the vaccine vary widely, health care provider recommendations remain the most 
effective strategy to positively influence vaccination decisions.
OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to predict the relative quality of life, costs, and 
cost-effectiveness of introducing a remunerated community pharmacist 
consultation service on influenza vaccination for Ontarians aged ≥ 65 years.
METHODS: A cost-utility analysis was performed from a third-party public payer 
perspective over 1 year. The delivery of consultation services by community 
pharmacists on influenza vaccination, billable at CAD $15 was compared with 
current standard practices (absence of remunerated consultations). Model inputs 
were derived primarily from existing literature. The impact of parameter 
uncertainties was assessed through deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity 
analyses.
RESULTS: The provision of influenza vaccine consultation services was predicted 
to prevent 2407 cases of mild influenza and 3 influenza-related deaths at an 
additional cost of CAD $2.03 per person over current practices. The incremental 
costs per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained for the enhanced care 
strategy compared with standard care was CAD $2087. The interpretation of the 
base-case result was found to be robust across all sensitivity analyses. The 
projected additional costs of implementing pharmacist consultations in Ontario 
was estimated at CAD $1.15 million per year, and the anticipated benefits 
included a gain of 507 QALY per year.
CONCLUSION: Pharmacist-delivered consultation services on influenza vaccination 
are cost-effective and lead to improved clinical outcomes for Ontario seniors. 
Introduction of such services offers a promising strategy to address challenges 
related to poor vaccine uptake in this group.

BACKGROUND: Life expectancy is reduced by 19 years in men and 17 in women with 
psychosis in Sweden, largely due to cardiovascular disease.
AIM: Assess whether a psychosocial health promotion intervention improves 
cardiometabolic risk factors, quality of life, and severity of illness in 
patients with psychotic disorders more than treatment as usual.
METHODS: A pragmatic intervention trial testing a manual-based multi-component 
health promotion intervention targeting patients with psychosis. The Swedish 
intervention was adapted from IMPaCT therapy, a health-promotion program based 
on motivational interviewing and cognitive behavioral therapy, designed to be 
incorporated into routine care. The intervention group consisted of 119 patients 
and the control group of 570 patients from specialized psychosis departments. 
Outcome variables were assessed 6 months before intervention during the run-in 
period, again at the start of intervention, and 12 months after the intervention 
began. The control group received treatment as usual.
RESULTS: The intervention had no significant effect on any of the outcome 
variables. However, BMI, waist circumference, systolic BP, heart rate, HbA1c, 
general health, and Clinical Global Impressions Scale score improved 
significantly during the run-in period before the start of the active 
intervention (observer effect). The multi-component design meant that treatment 
effects could only be calculated for the intervention as a whole.
CONCLUSION: The results of the intervention are similar to those of the U.K. 
IMPaCT study, in which the modular health-promotion intervention had little 
effect on cardiovascular risk indicators. However, in the current study, the 
run-in period had a positive effect on cardiometabolic risk factors.

Cost-Effectiveness of Colonoscopy-Based Colorectal Cancer Screening in Childhood 
Cancer Survivors.

    J Natl Cancer Inst. 2019 Nov 1;111(11):1114-1115.

BACKGROUND: Childhood cancer survivors (CCS) are at increased risk of developing 
colorectal cancer (CRC) compared to the general population, especially those 
previously exposed to abdominal or pelvic radiation therapy (APRT). However, the 
benefits and costs of CRC screening in CCS are unclear. In this study, we 
evaluated the cost-effectiveness of early-initiated colonoscopy screening in 
CCS.
METHODS: We adjusted a previously validated model of CRC screening in the US 
population (MISCAN-Colon) to reflect CRC and other-cause mortality risk in CCS. 
We evaluated 91 colonoscopy screening strategies varying in screening interval, 
age to start, and age to stop screening for all CCS combined and for those 
treated with or without APRT. Primary outcomes were CRC deaths averted (compared 
to no screening) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). A 
willingness-to-pay threshold of $100 000 per life-years gained (LYG) was used to 
determine the optimal screening strategy.
RESULTS: Compared to no screening, the US Preventive Services Task Force's 
average risk screening schedule prevented up to 73.2% of CRC deaths in CCS. The 
optimal strategy of screening every 10 years from age 40 to 60 years averted 
79.2% of deaths, with ICER of $67 000/LYG. Among CCS treated with APRT, 
colonoscopy every 10 years from age 35 to 65 years was optimal (CRC deaths 
averted: 82.3%; ICER: $92 000/LYG), whereas among those not previously treated 
with APRT, screening from age 45 to 55 years every 10 years was optimal (CRC 
deaths averted: 72.7%; ICER: $57 000/LYG).
CONCLUSIONS: Early initiation of colonoscopy screening for CCS is 
cost-effective, especially among those treated with APRT.

INTRODUCTION: the continuous increase in life expectancy and the large amount of 
elderly population the caregiver become an important figure in domiciliary 
assistance. He is not often prepared to fulfil this complex role, because he has 
a great number of unsatisfied needs. For this reason the aim of this study is to 
identify and analyze the caregiver's educational needs, in anticipation of frail 
elderly's home discharge.
METHODS: 39 caregivers of patients in the Humanitas Gradenigo Hospital in Turin, 
were asked to express their needs through the Caregiver Needs Assessment (CNA) 
questionnaire and then through semi-structured interviews, which were analyzed 
with Grouded Theory.
RESULTS: The CNA's results showed that health care professionals were not always 
able to satisfy caregiver needs, in particular they needed more informations and 
needed to be involved in team decisions. There was a lack of communication 
between them and the equipe, they also needed to know how to take care of the 
patients and they needed emotional and social support. From the interviews, five 
main categories emerged: "emotion during acute event", " Strategies to face the 
disease", "relationship with staff ", "expressed need" and "future ".
CONCLUSIONS: This study shows how the caregiver's experience impacts on 
different aspects of his life, including work, physical, emotional, and 
psychological health. Therapeutic education is an essential instrument that 
nursing staff can use to make caregivers more prepared for the complex 
management of the patient at home, sharing therapeutic aims.

Publisher: INTRODUZIONE: Con l’aumento dell’aspettativa di vita e l’incremento 
della popolazione anziana, il caregiver ha acquisito un ruolo rilevante 
nell’assistenza domiciliare. Spesso tale figura, portatrice di numerosi e 
complessi bisogni, non è sufficientemente preparata per ricoprire al meglio tale 
ruolo. L’ obiettivo dello studio è stato quello di individuare ed analizzare i 
bisogni educativi del caregiver, in previsione della dimissione del paziente 
fragile a domicilio.
METODO: Al campione di 39 caregiver, presso il reparto di Medicina Interna 
dell’ospedale Humanitas Gradenigo di Torino, è stato chiesto di esprimere i 
propri bisogni attraverso il questionario Caregiver Needs Assessment (CNA). Le 
tematiche emerse sono state approfondite con 15 interviste semi-strutturate, 
analizzate successivamente attraverso la tecnica Grouded Theory.
RISULTATI: I risultati del CNA evidenziano numerosi bisogni insoddisfatti tra 
cui il bisogno di informazione, di essere coinvolto nelle decisioni, di 
comunicare in modo soddisfacente con l’equipe, di saper affrontare i compiti 
assistenziali e ricevere supporto emotivo e sociale. Dalle interviste sono 
emerse diverse tematiche che sono state raggruppate in cinque categorie 
principali: “emozioni di fronte all’evento acuto”, “strategie per affrontare la 
malattia”, il “rapporto con il personale”, i ”bisogni espressi” e i percepiti 
sul “futuro”. CONCLUSIONI. Lo studio evidenzia come l’esperienza di assistenza 
del caregiver impatti su diversi aspetti della sua vita, inclusa l’attività 
lavorativa, la salute fisica, emotiva e psicologica. L'educazione terapeutica è 
uno strumento essenziale che l’infermiere può utilizzare per rendere i caregiver 
più consapevoli e aderenti alla complessa gestione della malattia al domicilio 
condividendone gli obiettivi terapeutici.

BACKGROUND: Cryoprecipitate's shelf life is limited due to concerns over 
decreased clotting factor activity and contamination with extended storage. 
Hemostatic characteristics of thawed cryoprecipitate stored up to 35 days at 
refrigerated and room temperatures were assessed.
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Pooled cryoprecipitate was thawed and aliquoted for 
storage at 1-6°C or 21-24°C. Samples were tested immediately after thawing and 
at 4 h, 24 h, 72 h, and weekly for 35 days. At each time point fibrinogen, 
factor VIII (FVIII), and von Willebrand factor (vWF) were assessed. Thrombin 
generation and rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM) were also performed. 
Further, packed red cells, platelet concentrates, frozen plasma, and stored 
cryoprecipitate were combined (1:1:1:1) to simulate massive transfusion and 
analyzed by ROTEM. Day 35 samples were cultured for bacterial contamination.
RESULTS: Precipitation was observed in refrigerated samples; however, these 
aggregates were easily resuspended upon warming in a 37°C water bath. No 
significant changes were observed in fibrinogen concentration or ROTEM at either 
temperature. FVIII and vWF declined significantly during storage. vWF, clot 
time, and thrombin generation were significantly better preserved with 
refrigeration. With simulated massive transfusion, fibrinogen function remained 
at or above the established range for whole blood at both storage temperatures. 
Bacterial contamination was not observed in cold stored or room temperature 
cryoprecipitate.
CONCLUSION: The fibrinogen concentration and function of cryoprecipitate at 
extended storage durations are adequate for fibrinogen replacement in critical 
bleeding. These results support extension of the shelf life of cryoprecipitate 
when used for fibrinogen replacement.

BACKGROUND: Resistance training is assumed to be a key player in counteracting 
the age-related decline of functional capacity as well as the incidence of falls 
in older adults. Functional training using free weights is presumed to mimic 
daily activities, but there is a lack of studies comparing free weight training 
with barbells and machine training in older adults. The purpose of this study 
was to evaluate the development of muscle strength for high resistance training 
in high functioning older people for machines as well as free-weights as well as 
testing the feasibility of free weight training for this target group.
METHODS: Thirty-two fitness trained women and men aged 60 to 86 years (mean: 
66.9, SD: ±5.5) participated in this study. Machine exercisers (n = 16; chest 
press, leg press, upper row, biceps cable curls, triceps cable extension) vs. 
free weight exercisers (n = 16; squat, bench press, bent-over rowing, biceps 
curls, lying triceps press) participated twice à week for a total of 26 weeks. 
They trained the same five muscle groups for three sets with 10 to 12 
repetitions at the 10-Repetition-Maximum, followed by 20 min of endurance 
training over six months. Three measurements (dynamic, isometric strength and 
endurance) were taken at the beginning, after 10 weeks and again after 26 weeks.
RESULTS: Repeated measures MANCOVA analysis revealed significant increases in 
the free weights training group (FWT) as well as in the machine training group 
(MT) over the period of 6 months. However, only for leg strength (113 vs. 44%) 
and triceps (89.0 vs. 28.3%) the free-weights group exhibited significant 
differences for the percentage increase over a period of 26 weeks compared to 
the machine group. A detraining period revealed the decline of the dynamic 
strength without training. The analysis of the follow-up questionnaire resulted 
in higher demands for safety, but also higher values for fun, motivation, 
future, and benefit for daily life for the FWT group compared to the MT group 
indicating an overall better evaluation of their training specific regime.
CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that especially free-weight training has 
benefits in improving leg and triceps strength as well as in the subjective 
perception in older adults. Nevertheless, our results do not overall indicate 
that free-weight training is superior to machine training for increasing 
strength.

Little is known about the relation between acculturation and socioecological 
contexts of migrants with a personal trauma history living in the community. 
This study represents an extension of our previous work and aimed to unpack the 
perceived neighborhood ethnic density (ED) effect and examine the moderating 
role of ED on the acculturation-adjustment relation in a community sample of 
migrants with trauma (N = 99) from developing countries residing in Montreal, 
Canada. ED was protective against general psychological distress but did not 
predict posttraumatic symptoms. The ED effect was mediated via degree of 
acculturation to the French-Canadian mainstream cultural context, rather than 
heritage acculturation, social support, or discrimination. Moreover, protective 
effects of French-Canadian mainstream acculturation for depressive symptoms and 
life satisfaction were found under high but not low ED conditions. Similarities 
and differences with our previous research as well as theoretical and prevention 
implications are discussed from a person-environment interaction perspective.

Patients with end-stage renal disease that require chronic haemodialysis need a 
reliable vascular access. Unanimously, native arteriovenous fistulae are 
considered to be the most reliable access for patients with reasonable life 
expectancy. For the last 60 years arteriovenous fistulae have been created 
surgically at the wrist or the elbow with variable rates of success, maturation 
problems, reinterventions and complications, making this field of surgery 
particularly challenging and full of scientific controversies. The recent 
addition of the technical ability to create arteriovenous fistulae 
percutaneously comes to add one more option for the patients and one more source 
of controversy for the experts.

The impact of foodborne metals on the burden of disease has been largely 
overlooked, in comparison to the attention on acute diseases associated with 
infectious foodborne agents. Four articles in this special section describe in 
detail the burden of disease from foodborne lead, methylmercury, arsenic, and 
cadmium. Ingested lead and methylmercury are causally associated with lifelong 
intellectual disability. Long term ingestion of arsenic is causally associated 
with an increased risk of cancer. Long term ingestion of cadmium is causally 
associated with an increased risk of late stage chronic kidney disease. This 
article presents an overview of the burden of disease from these four foodborne 
metals and discusses them in the context of the World Health Organization's 
initiative to estimate the global burden of foodborne disease. The results 
indicate that in 2015, ingestion of arsenic, methylmercury, lead, and cadmium 
resulted in more than 1 million illnesses, over 56,000 deaths, and more than 9 
million disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) worldwide. The greatest impact on 
DALYs was in the Western Pacific B subregion. All of the metals were found to 
have high DALYs per case in comparison with other foodborne disease agents, 
including infectious and parasitic agents. In addition, lead, arsenic, and 
methylmercury were found to have high DALYs per 100,000 population in comparison 
to other foodborne disease agents.

BACKGROUND: Peripheral artery disease (PAD) becomes more prevalent with 
advancing age and is associated with elevated risk of cardiovascular events and 
shortened life expectancy. We investigated the prognostic performance of cardiac 
and vascular biomarkers in a cohort of PAD patients.
METHODS: A total of 95 PAD patients were enrolled (mean age 68 years, range 47 
to 86 years, 73 males). Carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT), ankle brachial 
index (ABI), high sensitive cardiac troponin T, and N-terminal pro-B-type 
Natriuretic Peptide (NT-proBNP) were measured.
RESULTS: During a median follow-up time of 9.5 years, 44 patients died and 51 
patients survived. Upon Kaplan-Meier survival analysis hs-TnT (P < .001) or 
NT-proBNP levels (P < .001) above the median but not cIMT above the median 
(P = .488) or ABI below the median (P < .436)were associated with reduced 
survival rate. Upon univariate cox regression and after adjustment for age, 
gender, prior cerebral artery disease, and diabetes mellitus only the 
association between hs-cTnT and mortality remained significant (HR 1.93, 95% CI 
1.33-2.79, P < .001). In receiver operating curve analysis hs-cTnT (area under 
the curve [AUC]: 0.77, 95% CI: 0.67-0.87, P < .001) NT-proBNP (AUC: 0.74, 95% 
CI: 0.64-0.84, P < .001) as well as hs-cTnT, and NT-proBNP combined (AUC: 0.79, 
95% CI: 0.69-0.88, P < .001) were superior to cIMT (AUC: 0.64, 95%, CI: 
0.53-0.76, P = .022) and ABI (AUC: 0.57, 95% CI: 0.44-0.68, P = .313) in 
discriminating risk for mortality.
CONCLUSION: hs-cTnT and NT-proBNP should be taken into account for prognosis of 
patients with PAD.

Tisagenlecleucel for the Treatment of Relapsed or Refractory B-cell Acute 
Lymphoblastic Leukaemia in People Aged up to 25 Years: An Evidence Review Group 
Perspective of a NICE Single Technology Appraisal.

As part of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence's (NICE's) 
Single Technology Appraisal (STA) process, Novartis submitted evidence on the 
clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of tisagenlecleucel for treating 
paediatric and young adult patients (under the age of 25 years) with relapsed or 
refractory (r/r) B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). This article 
presents a summary of the Evidence Review Group's (ERG's) independent review of 
the evidence submission, the committee's deliberations, and the subsequent 
development of NICE guidance for the use of tisagenlecleucel on the National 
Health Service (NHS) in England. Tisagenlecleucel is a chimeric antigen 
receptor-modified T-cell (CAR-T) product, the first of this emerging therapeutic 
class to be considered by NICE in this indication. The company's evidence 
submission was based upon three single-arm, phase II studies: ELIANA, ENSIGN, 
and B2101J. These trials demonstrated a beneficial effect of tisagenlecleucel, 
with significant extensions in event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival 
(OS) compared to historical control datasets on blinatumomab and salvage 
chemotherapy. Adverse events were common; 77% of patients suffered from cytokine 
release syndrome (CRS), 56% of whom required intensive care unit-level care. The 
ERG did not consider clofarabine monotherapy an appropriate proxy for salvage 
chemotherapy. The company presented a hybrid cost-effectiveness model, combining 
a decision tree and three-state partitioned survival model structure. The 
majority of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained were generated through 
additional life-years in the extrapolated 'long-term survival' phase of the 
model, where patients were assumed to be 'cured'. The ERG considered the results 
to be subject to substantial uncertainty, due in part to immature trial data, 
unresolved long-term treatment effects, and a lack of appropriate comparator 
data. The ERG implemented a number of changes to the company's model in an 
alternative base case, producing deterministic incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratios (ICERs) of £45,397 per QALY gained versus salvage chemotherapy, and 
£27,732 versus blinatumomab. The probabilistic model produced ICERs of £48,265 
per QALY gained versus salvage chemotherapy, and £29,501 versus blinatumomab. 
The committee considered the ERG's analysis to be most closely aligned with 
their preferred assumptions, and did not consider tisagenlecleucel to meet both 
of the end-of-life (EoL) criteria. In recognition of the innovative nature of 
tisagenlecleucel, and the present immaturity of ongoing clinical trials, the 
committee considered further data collection would be valuable in resolving 
uncertainties around OS, the technology's novel mechanism of action, and the 
management of CRS and B-cell aplasia. The committee therefore recommended 
tisagenlecleucel for use in the Cancer Drugs Fund (CDF) until the conclusion of 
the ELIANA study (June 2023). This appraisal highlighted the difficulty of 
interpreting EoL criteria in the context of curative therapies and the valuation 
of cure versus extension of life. Further clarification of NICE's position in 
these situations may be necessary to ensure consistency and equity in their 
decision-making.

Aims: Tofacitinib is an oral Janus kinase inhibitor for the treatment of 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA). This analysis investigated the cost-effectiveness of 
the second-line treatment with tofacitinib, compared with adalimumab, both plus 
methotrexate (MTX), in patients with moderate-to-severe RA and an inadequate 
response to the first-line MTX, from a Taiwan National Health Insurance 
Administration perspective. Materials and methods: A patient-level simulation 
model was used to project lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life-years 
(QALYs). Base-case analysis compared second-line treatment with tofacitinib 5 mg 
twice daily plus MTX vs adalimumab 40 mg every 2 weeks plus MTX. Patients 
switched or discontinued treatment due to a lack or loss of effectiveness or a 
serious adverse event. Efficacy was measured by change in Health Assessment 
Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI) score. HAQ-DI scores were used to 
predict mortality and resource utilization, and were mapped onto utility values 
to estimate QALYs. Efficacy and safety data were derived from clinical trials 
and other secondary sources. Uncertainty in model parameters was explored using 
one-way deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Results: Patients 
gained 0.09 more QALYs with second-line tofacitinib plus MTX compared with 
adalimumab plus MTX (5.13 vs 5.04, respectively) at an additional cost of New 
Taiwan Dollars (NT$) 12,881. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was 
NT$143,122/QALY. One-way sensitivity analysis confirmed the base-case result was 
robust. Limitations: The lack of available clinical data, particularly for 
HAQ-DI scores, may introduce some bias in the analysis. No patients were in an 
early stage of RA, which may limit the generalizability of these results. 
Base-case results from our study are not necessarily generalizable to countries 
with healthcare systems that differ considerably from Taiwan. Conclusions: From 
a payer perspective, second-line treatment with tofacitinib plus MTX is a 
cost-effective treatment strategy, compared with adalimumab plus MTX, in 
patients with moderate-to-severe RA in Taiwan.

Deprescribing: a challenge for clinical cardiologists.

Dolara A(1).

Author information:
(1)Agenzia Regionale Sanità, Firenze, Italy.

Deprescribing is a holistic process to identify medications that can be ceased, 
substituted or reduced. This process can improve the health of older patients 
and also enhance their compliance to the prescribed medications which are 
actually beneficial. Recommendations and guidelines have been elaborated for 
extensively prescribed drugs. In clinical cardiology the process of 
deprescribing is a challenge for doctors because of withdrawal-related adverse 
effects, but it may be applied in certain clinical conditions such as the 
discontinuation of statin prescription in patients with advanced senile dementia 
and those with limited life expectancy. Deprescribing is also focussed on the 
scarcely known effects of prolonged therapy after the acute phase of a disease 
is over, especially when continuation may signify potential life-long treatment. 
There needs to be collaboration between the consultant cardiologist who first 
prescribes medications and family doctors who are responsible for the long-term 
care of the patient and reviewing prescribed medications may be necessary.

Dysphagia in people with advanced oesophageal cancer can be treated by 
oesophageal stents, external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) and intraluminal 
brachytherapy. Despite guidelines recommending brachytherapy for patients with a 
predicted life expectancy exceeding 3 months, its uptake in the UK has been 
limited. Here we examine the strength of the evidence supporting the use of 
brachytherapy compared with oesophageal stents and EBRT and possible reasons for 
its limited uptake. Trials and observational studies suggest brachytherapy alone 
confers a benefit to patients, but its impact is less immediate than oesophageal 
stents; the evidence on effectiveness and value-for-money is limited. Moreover, 
stronger evidence will probably be insufficient to increase uptake, due to the 
extra complexity of delivery compared with stents and EBRT and a lack of 
experience among specialists.

BACKGROUND: The oligometastatic paradigm suggests that some patients with a 
limited number of metastases might be cured if all lesions are eradicated. 
Evidence from randomised controlled trials to support this paradigm is scarce. 
We aimed to assess the effect of stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) on 
survival, oncological outcomes, toxicity, and quality of life in patients with a 
controlled primary tumour and one to five oligometastatic lesions.
METHODS: This randomised, open-label phase 2 study was done at 10 hospitals in 
Canada, the Netherlands, Scotland, and Australia. Patients aged 18 or older with 
a controlled primary tumour and one to five metastatic lesions, Eastern 
Cooperative Oncology Group score of 0-1, and a life expectancy of at least 6 
months were eligible. After stratifying by the number of metastases (1-3 vs 
4-5), we randomly assigned patients (1:2) to receive either palliative standard 
of care treatments alone (control group), or standard of care plus SABR to all 
metastatic lesions (SABR group), using a computer-generated randomisation list 
with permuted blocks of nine. Neither patients nor physicians were masked to 
treatment allocation. The primary endpoint was overall survival. We used a 
randomised phase 2 screening design with a two-sided α of 0·20 (wherein p<0·20 
designates a positive trial). All analyses were intention to treat. This study 
is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01446744.
FINDINGS: 99 patients were randomised between Feb 10, 2012, and Aug 30, 2016. Of 
99 patients, 33 (33%) were assigned to the control group and 66 (67%) to the 
SABR group. Two (3%) patients in the SABR group did not receive allocated 
treatment and withdrew from the trial; two (6%) patients in the control group 
also withdrew from the trial. Median follow-up was 25 months (IQR 19-54) in the 
control group versus 26 months (23-37) in the SABR group. Median overall 
survival was 28 months (95% CI 19-33) in the control group versus 41 months 
(26-not reached) in the SABR group (hazard ratio 0·57, 95% CI 0·30-1·10; 
p=0·090). Adverse events of grade 2 or worse occurred in three (9%) of 33 
controls and 19 (29%) of 66 patients in the SABR group (p=0·026), an absolute 
increase of 20% (95% CI 5-34). Treatment-related deaths occurred in three (4·5%) 
of 66 patients after SABR, compared with none in the control group.
INTERPRETATION: SABR was associated with an improvement in overall survival, 
meeting the primary endpoint of this trial, but three (4·5%) of 66 patients in 
the SABR group had treatment-related death. Phase 3 trials are needed to 
conclusively show an overall survival benefit, and to determine the maximum 
number of metastatic lesions wherein SABR provides a benefit.

Technology, Nihon University.

OBJECTIVES: To clarify the performance of health systems (performance), the 
state of prefectures was investigated.
METHODS: Using the method developed by the Organisation for Economic 
Co-operation and Development, we conducted the study using 27 indicators. To 
evaluate the performance, we examined the signal-to-noise ratio of transcription 
(η) by integrating indicators using the Mahalanobis-Taguchi method. The η was 
separated by a median. The ratio of prefectures in East or West Japan and the 
presence or absence of ordinance-designated cities were studied using the 
chi-square test. Furthermore, the correlation among the total component η (T-η), 
each component η, and expenditures, and the correlation between T-η and life 
expectancy, were studied.
RESULTS: The T-η positively correlated with the risk factors (RF)-η and the 
resources (R)-η, and negatively correlated with the health status (HS)-η. The 
number pf prefectures without ordinance-designated cities where the T-η and RF-η 
exceeded the median was large. The number of prefectures with 
ordinance-designated cities where the HS-η exceeded the median was also large. 
In addition, there were many prefectures where the T-η was in the top 25% in 
West Japan. There were positive correlations between the total expenditures and 
the T-η, the expenditures and the RF-η, and the expenditures and the R-η. There 
was a negative correlation between the expenditures and the HS-η, and the T-η 
and the life expectancy.
CONCLUSIONS: For life expectancy, prefectures with too good performance were 
recognized. In these prefectures, correction of resources is necessary.

Parallel Progress in Perceived Age and Life Expectancy.

Denmark, Odense, Denmark.

Southern Denmark, Odense, Denmark.

BACKGROUND: Human life expectancy continues to rise in most populations. This 
rise not only leads to longer lives but also is accompanied by improved health 
at a given age, that is, recent cohorts show a reduction of biological age for a 
given chronological age. Despite or even because of the diversity of biomarkers 
of aging, an accurate quantification of a general shift in biological age across 
time has been challenging.
METHODS: Here, we compared age perception of facial images taken in 2001 over a 
decade and related these changes in age perception to changes in life 
expectancy.
RESULTS: We show that age perception changes substantially across time and 
parallels the progress in life expectancy. In 2012, people aged more than 70 
years needed to look 2.3 years younger to be rated the same age as in 2002.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that age perception reflects the past life 
events better than predicts future length of life, that is, it is written in 
your face how much you have aged so far. We draw this conclusion as age 
perception among elderly individuals paralleled changes in life expectancy at 
birth but not changes in remaining life expectancies. We suggest that changes in 
age perception should be explored for younger age classes to inform on aging 
processes, including whether aging is delayed or slowed with increasing life 
expectancy.
