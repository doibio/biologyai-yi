advancements, early return to work can be seen as a factor preventing exclusive 
breastfeeding, and therefore, potentially having negative health impacts for 
babies. Indeed, the World Health Organisation recommends exclusive breastfeeding 
up to 6 months of age to provide babies with the nutrition for healthy growth 
and brain development, protection from life-threatening ailments, obesity and 
non-communicable diseases such as asthma and diabetes. Therefore, labour market 
demands on women may be at odds with the health benefits for children gained by 
longer periods of maternity leave. The aim of this article is to examine the 
relationship between leave provision and health benefits for children. We 
examine maternity and parental leave provision across European countries and its 
potential impact on the breastfeeding of very young babies (up to 6-months of 
age). We also consider economic factors of potential extension of maternity 
leave provision to 6 months, such as costs to businesses, effects on the female 
labour market attachment, and wider consequences (benefits and costs) for 
individuals, families, employers and the wider society.

IMPORTANCE: Liver cancer is among the leading causes of cancer deaths globally. 
The most common causes for liver cancer include hepatitis B virus (HBV) and 
hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and alcohol use.
OBJECTIVE: To report results of the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2015 study on 
primary liver cancer incidence, mortality, and disability-adjusted life-years 
(DALYs) for 195 countries or territories from 1990 to 2015, and present global, 
regional, and national estimates on the burden of liver cancer attributable to 
HBV, HCV, alcohol, and an “other” group that encompasses residual causes.
DESIGN, SETTINGS, AND PARTICIPANTS: Mortality was estimated using vital 
registration and cancer registry data in an ensemble modeling approach. 
Single-cause mortality estimates were adjusted for all-cause mortality. 
Incidence was derived from mortality estimates and the mortality-to-incidence 
ratio. Through a systematic literature review, data on the proportions of liver 
cancer due to HBV, HCV, alcohol, and other causes were identified. Years of life 
lost were calculated by multiplying each death by a standard life expectancy. 
Prevalence was estimated using mortality-to-incidence ratio as surrogate for 
survival. Total prevalence was divided into 4 sequelae that were multiplied by 
disability weights to derive years lived with disability (YLDs). DALYs were the 
sum of years of life lost and YLDs.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Liver cancer mortality, incidence, YLDs, years of 
life lost, DALYs by etiology, age, sex, country, and year.
RESULTS: There were 854 000 incident cases of liver cancer and 810 000 deaths 
globally in 2015, contributing to 20 578 000 DALYs. Cases of incident liver 
cancer increased by 75% between 1990 and 2015, of which 47% can be explained by 
changing population age structures, 35% by population growth, and −8% to 
changing age-specific incidence rates. The male-to-female ratio for 
age-standardized liver cancer mortality was 2.8. Globally, HBV accounted for 
265 000 liver cancer deaths (33%), alcohol for 245 000 (30%), HCV for 167 000 
(21%), and other causes for 133 000 (16%) deaths, with substantial variation 
between countries in the underlying etiologies.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Liver cancer is among the leading causes of cancer 
deaths in many countries. Causes of liver cancer differ widely among 
populations. Our results show that most cases of liver cancer can be prevented 
through vaccination, antiviral treatment, safe blood transfusion and injection 
practices, as well as interventions to reduce excessive alcohol use. In line 
with the Sustainable Development Goals, the identification and elimination of 
risk factors for liver cancer will be required to achieve a sustained reduction 
in liver cancer burden. The GBD study can be used to guide these prevention 
efforts.

This data analysis of the Global Burden of Disease 2015 study on primary liver 
cancer reports incidence, mortality, and disability-adjusted life-years for 195 
countries or territories from 1990 to 2015, and presents global, regional, and 
national estimates on the burden of liver cancer.

QUESTION: What is the burden of liver cancer globally, what are the major risk 
factors for liver cancer across countries, regions, and at the global level and 
how did these change between 1990 and 2015?
FINDINGS: There were 854 000 incident liver cancer cases and 810 000 deaths 
globally in 2015, contributing to 20 578 000 disability-adjusted life-years. 
Hepatitis B virus infection accounted for 265 000 liver cancer deaths (33%), 
alcohol for 245 000 (30%), hepatitis C virus infection for 167 000 (21%), and 
other causes for 133 000 (16%) deaths.
MEANING: Most cases of liver cancer can be prevented through vaccination, 
antiviral treatment, safe blood transfusion and injection practices, as well as 
interventions to reduce excessive alcohol use.

INTRODUCTION: Cervical cancer is the tenth most common cancer and the eighth 
most frequent cause of death among women in Singapore. As human papillomavirus 
(HPV) infection is the necessary cause of cervical cancer, the risk of cervical 
cancer can be substantially reduced through vaccination. This study was 
conducted to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of two-dose HPV vaccination as part 
of a national vaccination programme for 12-year-old girls in Singapore, from the 
perspective of the healthcare payer.
METHODS: A lifetime Markov cohort model was used to evaluate the 
cost-effectiveness of introducing the AS04-adjuvanted HPV-16/18 vaccine 
(AS04-HPV-16/18v) to the current cervical screening programme in Singapore. 
Furthermore, the cost-effectiveness of the AS04-HPV-16/18v was compared with the 
HPV-6/11/16/18 vaccine (4vHPV). Model inputs were derived from local data, where 
possible, and validated by clinical experts in Singapore.
RESULTS: Introduction of the AS04-HPV-16/18v in Singapore was shown to prevent 
137 cervical cancer cases and 48 cervical cancer deaths when compared with 
screening alone. This resulted in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of SGD 
12,645 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained, which is cost-effective 
according to the World Health Organization threshold for Singapore. When 
discounted at 3%, AS04-HPV-16/18v was dominant over 4vHPV, with cost savings of 
SGD 80,559 and 28 additional QALYs gained. In the one-way sensitivity analysis, 
AS04-HPV-16/18v remained cost-effective compared with screening alone and 
dominant compared with 4vHPV.
CONCLUSION: AS04-HPV-16/18v is the most cost-effective choice for reducing the 
burden of cervical cancer through universal mass vaccination for 12-year-old 
girls in Singapore.

PURPOSE: Exclusive breastfeeding and longer breastfeeding reduce women's breast 
cancer risk but Mexico has one of the lowest breastfeeding rates worldwide. We 
estimated the lifetime economic and disease burden of breast cancer in Mexico if 
95% of parous women breastfeed each child exclusively for 6 months and continue 
breastfeeding for over a year.
METHODS: We used a static microsimulation model with a cost-of-illness approach 
to simulate a cohort of Mexican women. We estimated breast cancer incidence, 
premature mortality, disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), medical costs, and 
income losses due to breast cancer and extrapolated the results to 1.116 million 
Mexican women of age 15 in 2012. Costs were expressed in 2015 US dollars and 
discounted at a 3% annual rate.
RESULTS: We estimated that 2,186 premature deaths (95% CI 2,123-2,248), 9,936 
breast cancer cases (95% CI 9,651-10,220), 45,109 DALYs (95% CI 43,000-47,217), 
and $245 million USD (95% CI 234-256) in medical costs and income losses owing 
to breast cancer could be saved over a cohort's lifetime. Medical costs account 
for 80% of the economic burden; income losses and opportunity costs for 
caregivers account for 15 and 5%, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: In Mexico, the burden of breast cancer due to suboptimal 
breastfeeding in women is high in terms of morbidity, premature mortality, and 
the economic costs for the health sector and society.

PURPOSE: The aim of this study is to evaluate prevalence of second primary 
cancer (SPC) among hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients after liver 
transplantation (LT) by using nationwide claims data from South Korea.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The nationwide cohort included patients who were 
diagnosed with HCC and received LT from 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2014. We 
analyzed frequency and standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) to estimate the risk 
of SPC in HCC patients after LT.
RESULTS: A total of 2462 patients who were diagnosed with HCC and received LT 
were confirmed. Of these patients, 103 (4.2%) developed SPC after LT; the most 
common cancer site was lung (16.5%). Patients with HCC receiving LT had high 
risk of SPC [SIR 2.79, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.27-3.38], particularly 
lymphoma (SIR 9.26), myeloma (SIR 10.60), and bladder cancer (SIR 7.19). The 
12-, 24-, 36-, and 48-month overall survival for patients with HCC after LT was 
92.7, 87.8, 84.6, and 82.1%, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: HCC patients with LT had longer life expectancy and higher risk for 
SPC compared with the general population. Therefore, close surveillance for SPC 
is important in patients with HCC receiving LT.

We describe a unique microsporidian species that infects the green stink bug, 
Chinavia hilaris; the brown marmorated stink bug, Halyomorpha halys; the brown 
stink bug, Euschistus servus; and the dusky stink bug, Euschistus tristigmus. 
All life stages are unikaryotic, but analysis of the consensus small subunit 
region of the ribosomal gene places this microsporidium in the genus Nosema, 
which historically has been characterized by diplokaryotic life stages. It is 
also characterized by having the reversed arrangement of the ribosomal gene (LSU 
-ITS- SSU) found in species within the "true Nosema" clade. This microsporidium 
is apparently Holarctic in distribution. It is present in H. halys both where it 
is native in Asia and where it is invasive in North America, as well as in 
samples of North American native C. hilaris collected prior to the introduction 
of H. halys from Asia. Prevalence in H. halys from mid-Atlantic, North America 
in 2015-2016 ranged from 0.0% to 28.3%, while prevalence in C. hilaris collected 
in Illinois in 1970-1972 ranged from 14.3% to 58.8%. Oral infectivity and 
pathogenicity were confirmed in H. halys and C. hilaris. Morphological, 
ultrastructural, and ecological features of the microsporidium, together with a 
molecular phylogeny, establish a new species named Nosema maddoxi sp. nov.

Early-phase HIV cure research is conducted against a background of highly 
effective antiretroviral therapy, and involves risky interventions in 
individuals who enjoy an almost normal life expectancy. To explore perceptions 
of three ethical topics in the context of HIV cure research-(a) equipoise, (b) 
risk-benefit ratios, and (c) "otherwise healthy volunteers"-we conducted 36 
in-depth interviews (IDIs) with three groups of purposively selected key 
informants: clinician-researchers ( n = 11), policy-makers and bioethicists ( n 
= 13), and people living with HIV (PLWHIV; n = 12). Our analysis revealed 
variability in perceptions of equipoise. Second, most key informants believed 
there was no clear measure of risk-benefit ratios in HIV cure research, due in 
part to the complexity of weighing (sometimes unknown) risks to participants and 
(sometimes speculative) benefits to science and society. Third, most 
clinician-researchers and policy-makers/bioethicists viewed potential HIV cure 
study participants as "otherwise healthy volunteers," but this perception was 
not shared among PLWHIV in our study.

- Chronic pancreatitis is a progressive inflammatory disease, which leads to a 
severe decrease in quality of life and reduced life expectancy.- 85-90% of 
patients with chronic pancreatitis consult the doctor because of pain.- Pain in 
chronic pancreatitis has a multifactorial aetiology, with nociceptive and 
neuropathological components.- Current treatment of chronic pancreatitis uses a 
step-up approach, starting with lifestyle interventions and medication, followed 
by endoscopic or surgical treatment or a combination of these two.- Surgical 
drainage or resection is more effective than repeated endoscopic treatment for 
patients with advanced chronic pancreatitis who use opiates.- There are 
indications that early surgical intervention in painful chronic pancreatitis and 
a dilated pancreatic duct provides better results than the current step-up 
approach; this is currently being investigated in the ESCAPE trial.

Sciences Mental Health and Wellbeing, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK.

BACKGROUND: Death of people with intellectual disabilities is considered to be 
earlier than for the general population.
METHODS: Databases were searched for key words on intellectual disabilities and 
death. Strict inclusion/exclusion criteria were used. Information was extracted 
from selected papers, tabulated and synthesized. Prospero registration number: 
CRD42015020161.
RESULTS: Of 19,111 retrieved articles, 27 met criteria. Death was earlier by 
20 years. It has improved in recent decades; however, the same inequality gap 
with the general population remains. More severe intellectual disabilities, 
and/or additional comorbidities rendered it shortest. Standardized mortality 
rates showed a greater inequality for women than men. Respiratory disease and 
circulatory diseases (with greater congenital and lesser ischaemic disease 
compared with the general population) were the main causes of death. Cancer was 
less common, and cancer profile differed from the general population. Some 
deaths are potentially avoidable. All research is from high-income countries, 
and cause of death is surprisingly little investigated.
CONCLUSIONS: Improved health care, including anticipatory care such as health 
checks, and initiatives addressing most relevant lifestyle behaviours and health 
risks are indicated.

OBJECTIVES: To perform a cost analysis comparing the cost of robot-assisted 
radical cystectomy (RARC) with open RC (ORC) in a UK tertiary referral centre 
and to identify the key cost drivers.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data on hospital length of stay (LOS), operative time 
(OT), transfusion rate, and volume and complication rate were obtained from a 
prospectively updated institutional database for patients undergoing RARC or 
ORC. A cost decision tree model was created. Sensitivity analysis was performed 
to find key drivers of overall cost and to find breakeven points with ORC. Monte 
Carlo analysis was performed to quantify the variability in the dataset.
RESULTS: One RARC procedure costs £12 449.87, or £12 106.12 if the robot was 
donated via charitable funds. In comparison, one ORC procedure costs £10 474.54. 
RARC is 18.9% more expensive than ORC. The key cost drivers were OT, LOS, and 
the number of cases performed per annum.
CONCLUSION: High ongoing equipment costs remain a large barrier to the cost of 
RARC falling. However, minimal improvements in patient quality of life would be 
required to offset this difference.

: This series of review articles outlines the complex cause of HIV-related 
cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) particularly the interactions of viral factors, 
complications of antiviral therapy such as metabolic derangement, and chronic 
systemic inflammation. These factors, directly stemming from chronic HIV 
infection, are important in the pathogenesis of HIV-related CVD. Addressing each 
issue has likely underpinned the improved morbidity and increased life 
expectancy enjoyed by patients in the modern era of HIV management. The global 
management of HIV-related CVD may, however, be simpler than previously imagined, 
as the disease likely follows a pathway shared by multiple systemic diseases. 
Other chronic systemic diseases, including diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, and 
autoimmune disease, share numerous pathophysiological mechanisms with HIV and 
provoke similar cardiac complications. CVD risk management in patients living 
with HIV (PLHIV) may be optimized by drawing upon existing knowledge of chronic 
systemic diseases which may open up new concepts in treatment and address the 
current shortfalls in cardiovascular management of PLHIV.

BACKGROUND: GPs can refer obese children living in deprived areas to 
multidisciplinary programmes for a weight loss intervention, though the 
effectiveness of these local initiatives targeted to this specific group is 
unknown.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of the Kids4Fit intervention in 
deprived areas on child's weight status.
METHODS: Design and setting: cohort study, including a waiting list control 
period. Subjects: children (N = 154) aged 6-12 years, who signed up for the 
Kids4Fit intervention programme, led by a dietitian, physiotherapist and child 
psychologist were included. Measurements of standardized body mass index (BMI-z) 
and waist circumference were taken at start of the waiting list period, at start 
and at the end of the intervention and after 52 weeks. Mixed model analyses 
(random effects models) were used, expressed in effect per week [β with 95% 
confidence interval (CI)], compared to the waiting list expectancy over the 
52-week study period.
RESULTS: Mixed model analyses showed a non-significant trend towards a lower 
BMI-z up to 52 weeks after start of Kids4Fit (β: -0.0024; 95% CI: -0.0053; 
0.0004), compared to the waiting list expectancy. A significantly lower waist 
circumference was found over time compared to the waiting list expectancy (β: 
-0.0558; 95% CI: -0.0950; -0.0166). No differences were found in lifestyle and 
health-related quality of life.
CONCLUSION: A local multidisciplinary intervention programme in deprived areas 
is effective in reducing waist circumference of obese children, compared to a 
waiting list expectancy, but no significant changes in lifestyle and quality of 
life were shown.

The concept of damage control orthopaedics (DCO) is a strategy that focuses on 
managing orthopaedic injuries in polytrauma patients who are in an unstable 
physiological state. The concept of DCO is an extension of damage control 
surgery or damage limitation surgery (DCS/DLS). Recently, it has become clear 
that certain patients, following extensive soft tissue trauma, could benefit 
from the idea of DCS. In the management of severe lower extremity trauma with 
exposed fracture sites, aggressive early wound excision debridement, early 
internal fixation, and vascularized wound coverage within a few days after 
trauma were proposed. A negative-pressure dressing can be easily and rapidly 
applied to obtain a temporary closure between surgical stages. While negative 
pressure wound therapy (NPWT) has clear indications in the management of chronic 
wounds, its applications in the acute setting in victims of polytrauma are 
uneven. We conducted a review of the current clinical literature to evaluate the 
role of NPWT in this field, which points out that the negative pressure, applied 
immediately after the first debridement, seems to be an optimal bridge to the 
final reconstruction up to 7 days.

BACKGROUND: Socioeconomically disadvantaged populations often have higher 
exposures to particulate air pollution, which can be expected to contribute to 
differentials in life expectancy. We examined socioeconomic differentials in 
exposure and air pollution-related mortality relating to larger scale (5 km 
resolution) variations in background concentrations of selected pollutants 
across England.
METHODS: Ozone and particulate matter (sub-divided into PM10, PM2.5, PM2.5-10, 
primary, nitrate and sulphate PM2.5) were simulated at 5 km horizontal 
resolution using an atmospheric chemistry transport model (EMEP4UK). Annual mean 
concentrations of these pollutants were assigned to all 1,202,578 residential 
postcodes in England, which were classified by urban-rural status and 
socioeconomic deprivation based on the income and employment domains of the 2010 
English Index of Multiple Deprivation for the Lower-level Super Output Area of 
residence. We used life table methods to estimate PM2.5-attributable life years 
(LYs) lost in both relative and absolute terms.
RESULTS: Concentrations of the most particulate fractions, but not of nitrate 
PM2.5 or ozone, were modestly higher in areas of greater socioeconomic 
deprivation. Relationships between pollution level and socioeconomic deprivation 
were non-linear and varied by urban-rural status. The pattern of PM2.5 
concentrations made only a small contribution to the steep socioeconomic 
gradient in LYs lost due to PM2.5 per 103 population, which primarily was driven 
by the steep socioeconomic gradient in underlying mortality rates. In rural 
areas, the absolute burden of air pollution-related LYs lost was lowest in the 
most deprived deciles.
CONCLUSIONS: Air pollution shows modest socioeconomic patterning at 5 km 
resolution in England, but absolute attributable mortality burdens are strongly 
related to area-level deprivation because of underlying mortality rates. 
Measures that cause a general reduction in background concentrations of air 
pollution may modestly help narrow socioeconomic differences in health.

OBJECTIVE: To provide an in-depth understanding of patients' views about the 
impact of transcatheter aortic valve implantation on self-reported quality of 
life.
BACKGROUND: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation is considered to be the gold 
standard of care for inoperable patients diagnosed with severe symptomatic 
aortic stenosis. Mid- to long-term clinical outcomes are favourable and 
questionnaire data indicates improvements in quality of life but an in-depth 
understanding of how quality of life is altered by the intervention is missing.
METHODS: A mixed methods study design with a total of 89 in-depth qualitative 
interviews conducted with participants (39% male; mean age 81.7 years), 1 and 3 
months post TAVI, recruited from a regional centre in England. Data were 
triangulated with questionnaire data (SF-36 and EQ5D-VAS) collected, pre, 1 and 
3 months post implantation.
RESULTS: Participants' accounts were characterised by four key themes; shortened 
life, extended life, limited life and changed life. Quality of life was changed 
through two mechanisms. Most participants reported a reduced symptom burden and 
all explained that their life expectancy was improved. Questionnaire data 
supported interview data with gradual improvements in mean EQ-5D scores and 
SF-36 physical and mental domain scores at 1 and 3 months compared to baseline.
CONCLUSION: Findings suggest that TAVI was of variable benefit, producing 
considerable improvements in either mental or physical health in many 
participants, while a smaller proportion continued to deteriorate.

The decision-making process for treatment of prostate cancer should not be based 
on a single parameter such as patient age but should account for cancer 
characteristics, life expectancy, comorbidities, and patient expectation. Local 
treatment might be beneficial in selected elderly men with aggressive disease 
and a long life expectancy.

OBJECTIVES: Treatment thresholds based on risk predictions can be optimized by 
considering various health (economic) outcomes and performing marginal analyses, 
but this is rarely performed. We demonstrate a general approach to identify 
treatment thresholds optimizing individual health (economic) outcomes, 
illustrated for statin treatment based on 10-year coronary heart disease (CHD) 
risk predicted by the Framingham risk score.
STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: Creating a health economic model for a risk-based 
prevention strategy, risk thresholds can be evaluated on several outcomes of 
interest. Selecting an appropriate threshold range and decrement size for the 
thresholds and adapting the health economic model accordingly, outcomes can be 
calculated for each risk threshold. A stepwise, or marginal, comparison of 
clinical as well as health economic outcomes, that is, comparing outcomes using 
a specific threshold to outcomes of the former threshold while gradually 
lowering the threshold, then takes into account the balance between additional 
numbers of individuals treated and their outcomes (additional health effects and 
costs). In our illustration, using a Markov model for CHD, we evaluated risk 
thresholds by gradually lowering thresholds from 20% to 0%.
RESULTS: This approach can be applied to identify optimal risk thresholds on any 
outcome, such as to limit complications, maximize health outcomes, or optimize 
cost-effectiveness. In our illustration, keeping the population-level fraction 
of statin-induced complications <10% resulted in thresholds of T = 6% (men) and 
T = 2% (women). Lowering the threshold and comparing quality-adjusted life-years 
(QALYs) after each 1% decrease, QALYs were gained down to T = 1% (men) and 
T = 0% (women). Also accounting for costs, net health benefits were favorable 
down to T = 3% (men) and T = 6% (women).
CONCLUSION: Using a stepwise risk-based approach to threshold optimization 
allows for preventive strategies that optimize outcomes. Presenting this 
comprehensive overview of outcomes will better inform decision makers when 
defining a treatment threshold.

The use of anti-retroviral therapy has been effective in controlling the spread 
of HIV-1, and has prolonged life expectancy, but this success can be affected by 
the emergence of drug resistance. The main goal of this study was to investigate 
drug resistance in the reverse transcriptase (RT), and protease (PR) genes among 
HIV-1 infected individuals. We systematically selected 59 HIV-1 infected 
individuals from Shiraz Voluntary Counseling and Testing Center (29 treatment- 
naïve and 30 treated). In this study intravenous drug users older than 18 were 
included in this study. Using specific primers, nested RT-PCR was performed on 
RNA extracted from patient samples. The genes targeted for RT and PCR were 
successfully amplified and sequenced. The sequences of these two genes were 
compared with mutations related to drug resistance against nucleotide reverse 
transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI), non-nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors 
(NNRTI) and protease inhibitors (PI) using the latest database from the 
International AIDS society - USA, Stanford University, and the patterns were 
recorded. Among treatment-naïve, the detected NRTI and NNRTI resistance 
mutations were V179T, V75 M and E138A. V179T causes high level resistance to 
Efavirenze and Nevirapin. V75 M causes intermediate resistance to Stavudine. 
Regarding NRTI and NNRTI resistance mutations among treated patients, the most 
frequent mutation (7%) was M184 V, which causes high level resistance to 
zidovudin and emtricitabine. The interesting result from this study was the 
detection of NRTI and NNRTI resistance mutations before the initiation of 
treatment, which signifies the transmission of resistant strains of virus 
between individuals. This mutation highlights the importance of drug resistance 
HIV-1 genotyping before commencing treatment.
