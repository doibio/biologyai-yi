The majority of studies on longevity in Sardinia point to an exceptional level 
of longevity, particularly for males, in this region of Italy. This study used 
individual data, considering selected groups of individuals such as 
centenarians, or focusing on cohorts of newborns in a large time period, that 
have previously been treated as a single group. An analysis on decennial birth 
cohorts from 1872 to 1911 in a selected village located in the Blue Zone area of 
longevity in Sardinia was used to gain insight into sex differentials in 
mortality in this area of high longevity and to separate differences between 
cohorts' experiences, considering the possible role of significant events in 
determining differential mortality among them. The results show that there is 
not a secular trend in survival in the birth cohorts under study, but rather 
that several points of mortality convergence and crossover occur, which make the 
estimates derived from conventional sensitivity tests of survival curves 
unreliable. Differences among birth cohorts' experiences are more marked among 
the male population and at early adult ages. External events are shown to play a 
relevant role in mortality variations, despite not having an impact on the 
ageing process. The results highlight that, although there are not statistically 
significant differences between the two sexes, the male population is exposed to 
a higher risk of death and proves to be more vulnerable to external changes. 
This suggests that extreme contextual conditions, both favourable and 
unfavourable, may significantly affect the mortality trajectories of a 
population.

BACKGROUND: Life expectancy and time to first hospitalization have been 
prolonged, indicating that people live longer without needing hospital care. 
Life expectancy increased partially due to improved survival from severe 
diseases, which, however, could lead to a more fragile population. If so, time 
to a subsequent hospitalization could decrease. Alternatively, the overall trend 
of improved health could continue after the first hospitalization, prolonging 
also the time to subsequent hospitalizations. This study analyzes trends in 
subsequent hospitalizations among Swedish men and women above the age of 60, 
relating them to first hospitalization. It also looks at trends in the 
proportion of never hospitalized.
METHODS: Individuals were followed in national registers for hospital admissions 
and deaths between 1972 and 2010. The proportion of never hospitalized 
individuals at given ages and time points, and the annual change in the risks of 
first and subsequent hospitalizations, were calculated.
FINDINGS: An increase in the proportion of never hospitalized was seen over 
time. The risks of first as well as subsequent hospitalizations were reduced by 
almost 10% per decade for both men and women. Improvements were observed mainly 
for individuals below the ages of 90 and up to the year 2000.
CONCLUSIONS: The reduction in annual risk of both first and subsequent 
hospitalizations up to 90 years of age speaks in favor of a postponement of the 
overall morbidity among the elderly and provides no support for the hypothesis 
that the population becomes more fragile due to increased survival from severe 
diseases.

Hemophilia A and B are rare inherited bleeding disorders characterized by the 
deficiency of coagulation factor VIII (FVIII) or factor IX (FIX). While the 
history of hemophilia dates back to the 2nd century AD, a modern description of 
hemophilia appeared only at the beginning of the 19th century. The discovery of 
"antihemophilic globulin" in the middle of the 20th century paved the way to the 
production of cryoprecipitate and then of FVIII and FIX concentrates. Barring 
the tragic consequences on the hemophilia community of the transmission of 
blood-borne viruses by nonvirus inactivated factor concentrates during the 1970s 
and 1980s, plasma-derived first and recombinant products later revolutionized 
the treatment of hemophilia through the widespread adoption of home treatment 
and prophylaxis regimens, which dramatically improved the quality of life and 
life expectancy of persons with hemophilia during the past decade. This article 
briefly reviews the most important stages of the management of hemophilia from 
the past century up to the present days.

OBJECTIVE: Type A1 gestational diabetes mellitus (A1GDM), also known as 
diet-controlled gestational diabetes, is associated with an increase in adverse 
perinatal outcomes such as macrosomia and Erb palsy. However, it remains unclear 
when to deliver these women because optimal timing of delivery requires 
balancing neonatal morbidities from early term delivery against the risk of 
intrauterine fetal demise (IUFD). We sought to determine the optimal gestational 
age (GA) for women with A1GDM to deliver.
STUDY DESIGN: A decision-analytic model was built to compare the outcomes of 
delivery at 37-41 weeks in a theoretical cohort of 100,000 women with A1GDM. 
Strategies involving expectant management until a later GA accounted for 
probabilities of spontaneous delivery, indicated delivery, and IUFD during each 
week. GA-associated risks of neonatal complications included cerebral palsy, 
infant death, and Erb palsy. Probabilities were derived from the literature, and 
total quality-adjusted life years were calculated. Sensitivity analyses were 
used to investigate the robustness of the baseline assumptions.
RESULTS: Our model showed that induction at 38 weeks maximized quality-adjusted 
life years. Within our cohort, delivery at 38 weeks would prevent 48 stillbirths 
but lead to 12 more infant deaths compared to 39 weeks. Sensitivity analysis 
revealed that 38 weeks remains the optimal timing of delivery until IUFD rates 
fall <0.3-fold of our baseline assumption, at which point expectant management 
until 39 weeks is optimal.
CONCLUSION: By weighing the risks of IUFD against infant deaths and neonatal 
morbidities from early term delivery, we determined that the ideal GA for women 
with A1GDM to deliver is 38 weeks.

de Tenerife, Spain, ivan.castillarodriguez@sescs.es.

BACKGROUND: To assess the cost-utility of gastric bypass versus usual care for 
patients with severe obesity in Spain.
METHODS: We have implemented a discrete-event simulation model with two 
branches: one branch involves gastric bypass, thereby reducing patients' BMI, 
and another branch where patients do not undergo surgery. The model analyzes the 
emergence of comorbidities (stroke, coronary obstructive disease, diabetes, and 
breast cancer) associated with obesity during a lifetime horizon. The selected 
measure of effectiveness is health-related quality of life. Both costs and 
effects are discounted at 3 %. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis is also 
performed using second-order Monte Carlo simulation; acceptability curves for 
different time horizons were also calculated.
RESULTS: Patients with gastric bypass result in a lifetime increase of 5.63 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) (18.18 vs. 12.55 QALYs). In addition, 
because of the reduced spending associated with the treatment of various 
obesity-related comorbidities, final savings stand at 13,994 <euro>. The total 
cost of the intervention branch is close to half the cost of the 
non-intervention branch (17,431 vs. 31,425 <euro>).
CONCLUSIONS: Gastric bypass is an intervention that dominates over the option of 
not intervening when a lifetime horizon is considered.

Highly active antiretroviral therapy has helped to improved control of the HIV 
infection, and has led to a progressively older population with the infection 
having a life expectancy quite similar to that of the general population. On the 
other hand, it is also known that HIV infection, even in patients with 
undetectable viral loads and good immunity, carries an increased cardiovascular 
risk, as well as an increased incidence of certain cancers. Therefore, the 
majority of HIV-infected patients receive several drugs (either prescribed by 
the physician or self-administered) combined with antiretrovirals. This article 
reviews the interactions between antiretrovirals and other drugs that can cause 
significant damage to patients, or even be life-threatening and of whom 
clinicians, especially those not directly treating HIV-infected patients, should 
be aware. A review is also presented on the implications of interactions between 
antiretrovirals and other drugs in special situations, such as the 
co-administration with cytostatics, immunesuppressants used in solid organ 
transplantation, or patients receiving new treatments for hepatitisC. Generally, 
combinations with two nucleos(t)ide reverse transcriptase inhibitors and 
raltegravir (or in the near future, dolutegravir) are those with less potential 
for clinically significant interactions.

A cost-effectiveness analysis of celecoxib compared with diclofenac in the 
treatment of pain in osteoarthritis (OA) within the Swedish health system using 
an adaptation of the NICE OA model.

OBJECTIVES: Celecoxib for the treatment of pain resulting from osteoarthritis 
(OA) was reviewed by the Tandvårds- och läkemedelsförmånsverket-Dental and 
Pharmaceutical Benefits Board (TLV) in Sweden in late 2010. This study aimed to 
evaluate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of celecoxib plus a 
proton pump inhibitor (PPI) compared to diclofenac plus a PPI in a Swedish 
setting.
METHODS: The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in the UK 
developed a health economic model as part of their 2008 assessment of treatments 
for OA. In this analysis, the model was reconstructed and adapted to a Swedish 
perspective. Drug costs were updated using the TLV database. Adverse event costs 
were calculated using the regional price list of Southern Sweden and the 
standard treatment guidelines from the county council of Stockholm. Costs for 
treating cardiovascular (CV) events were taken from the Swedish DRG codes and 
the literature.
RESULTS: Over a patient's lifetime treatment with celecoxib plus a PPI was 
associated with a quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gain of 0.006 per patient 
when compared to diclofenac plus a PPI. There was an increase in discounted 
costs of 529 kr per patient, which resulted in an incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio (ICER) of 82,313 kr ($12,141). Sensitivity analysis showed that treatment 
was more cost effective in patients with an increased risk of bleeding or 
gastrointestinal (GI) complications.
CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that celecoxib plus a PPI is a cost effective 
treatment for OA when compared to diclofenac plus a PPI. Treatment is shown to 
be more cost effective in Sweden for patients with a high risk of bleeding or GI 
complications. It was in this population that the TLV gave a positive 
recommendation. There are known limitations on efficacy in the original NICE 
model.

Reliable estimates of disease burden support rational allocation of financial 
and human resources. Measurement is a powerful force for change as ‘what gets 
measured gets done’. The global burden of musculoskeletal disease studies 
ensures visibility of these highly prevalent, disabling diseases. Now we must 
act to reduce disease burden.

[The burden of disease in Catalonia, Spain, using disability-adjusted life years 
(2005-2010)].

[Article in Spanish]

Cuadras Andreu A, Rovira Ricart E.

BACKGROUND: Burden of disease allows measuring the health of the population 
including mortality and disability. The objectives of this paper are to estimate 
the burden of disease in Catalonia, to compare the results with Spain and 
Tarragones area and to assess the contribution of the local registers to the 
estimation of the disability.
METHODS: We calculated the disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) for 123 causes 
using the methodology developed by the World Health Organization. We compared 
the standardized rates with the Spanish rates. In Tarragones area, we calculated 
the DALYs, we compared them with the DALYs in Catalonia and moreover we used the 
cancer incidence local registry to calculate cancer burden disease.
RESULTS: There were 801,140 DALYs (annual average) in Catalonia, 60.3% due to 
disability and 39.7% due to premature mortality. Neuropsychiatric disorders 
(30.9%), malignant neoplasms (15.8%) and cardiovascular diseases (11.3%) were 
the leading causes. The standardized rate of respiratory diseases (7.5 per 
1,000) was significantly higher compared with the Spanish rate. Perinatal 
conditions (3.1 per 1,000), intentional injuries (2.2 per 1,000) and digestive 
diseases (4.9 per 1,000) were significantly higher in Tarragones area. DALYs 
attributable to cancer showed an increase of 13.4 % when they were calculated 
using the incidence of cases.
CONCLUSION: Noncommunicable diseases were the leading causes for DALYs in 
Catalonia. There are differences between territories in respiratory diseases, 
perinatal conditions, digestive diseases and intentional injures. Local 
registries can be very useful in order to calculate the DALYs.

Cost-effectiveness of ensuring hepatitis B protection for previously vaccinated 
healthcare personnel.

Hoerger TJ(1), Bradley C, Schillie SF, Reilly M, Murphy TV.

Author information:
(1)RTI International, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina.

OBJECTIVE: To examine the cost-effectiveness of pre- and postexposure approaches 
for ensuring hepatitis B protection among previously vaccinated healthcare 
personnel (HCP).
DESIGN: A decision-analytic model was developed for alternative strategies of 
ensuring hepatitis B protection under assumptions of 68% and 95% long-term 
protection after a primary vaccination series. Costs and quality-adjusted life 
years (QALYs) lost from infections were estimated, and incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated relative to a no intervention 
alternative over 10 years of intervention. Separate analyses were performed for 
trainees and nontrainees, using the healthcare system perspective. Trainees face 
higher risk of exposure and likely received primary vaccination as infants.
SETTING: General healthcare settings.
PARTICIPANTS: Trainee and nontrainee HCP.
INTERVENTIONS: Preexposure testing for antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen 
followed by additional vaccination for HCP without protective antibody levels; 
postexposure evaluation and management for HCP reporting blood or body fluid 
exposures
RESULTS: The preexposure strategy prevents more infections and has higher costs 
than the postexposure strategy or no intervention. For trainees, 10-year 
preexposure evaluation ICERs are $832,875 and $144,457 per QALY for 95% and 68% 
long-term vaccine protection, respectively. Trainee 10-year postexposure 
evaluation ICERs are $1,146,660 and $191,579 per QALY under the 95% and 68% 
long-term protection assumptions, respectively. For nontrainees, 10-year ICERs 
are $745,739 and $1,129,286 per QALY for the preexposure and postexposure 
evaluation strategies, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: ICERs may inform decision makers as they decide whether the added 
cost of the preexposure strategy provides sufficient value in preventing 
infections.

Insulin therapy for type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Wallia A(1), Molitch ME(1).

Author information:
(1)Division of Endocrinology, Metabolism, and Molecular Medicine, Northwestern 
University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, Illinois.

IMPORTANCE: The incidence and prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus are 
increasing.
OBJECTIVE: To review currently available insulin therapy, as well as evidence on 
the use, application, initiation, and intensification of insulin in the 
outpatient setting.
EVIDENCE REVIEW: Data sources included PubMed for trials and investigations in 
type 2 diabetes examining insulin use from January 1998 to April 2014.
FINDINGS: The hemoglobin A1c target for most patients with type 2 diabetes is 7% 
but needs to be modified when there is increased risk of hypoglycemia, reduced 
life expectancy, extensive comorbidities, or reduced resources. Insulin therapy 
may be considered early or late in the disease course; adverse effects include 
weight gain and hypoglycemia. Basal insulin can be added to oral hypoglycemic 
agents (generally stopping sulfonylureas) initially, and later, prandial insulin 
can be added in a stepwise fashion. Insulin treatment must be individualized, 
and there are a number of challenges to insulin initiation and intensification.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Insulin can help achieve ideal hemoglobin A1c goals 
for patients with type 2 diabetes. Barriers such as adherence, patient 
preferences, clinician preferences, and resource allocation must be addressed.

A mechanistic perspective on process-induced changes in glucosinolate content in 
Brassica vegetables: a review.

Science , Wageningen University , Wageningen , The Netherlands.

Brassica vegetables are consumed mostly after processing, which is expected to 
give beneficial effects on the vegetable properties, such as improved 
palatability and bioavailability of nutrients, or shelf life extension. But 
processing also results to various changes in the content of health promoting 
phytochemicals like glucosinolates. This paper reviews the effects of processing 
on the glucosinolates content by using a mechanism approach underlying 
processing method employed. Cultural differences between Eastern and Western 
preparation practices and their possible effect on glucosinolate retention are 
highlighted. Boiling and blanching considerably reduce the glucosinolate content 
mainly due to mechanisms of cell lysis, diffusion, and leaching, and partly due 
to thermal and enzymatic degradation. Steaming, microwave processing, and stir 
frying either retain or slightly reduce the glucosinolates content due to low 
degrees of leaching; moreover, these methods seem to enhance extractability of 
glucosinolates from the plant tissue. Fermentation reduces the glucosinolate 
content considerably, but the underlying mechanisms are not yet studied in 
detail. Studying the changes of glucosinolates during processing by a 
mechanistic approach is shown to be valuable to understand the impact of 
processing and to optimize processing conditions for health benefits of these 
compounds.

The multimodal treatment of acromegaly: current status and future perspectives.

Espinosa E, Ramirez C, Mercado M(1).

Acromegaly is a chronic systemic disorder caused by a GH-secreting pituitary 
adenoma. Active acromegaly results in a poor quality of life due to symptoms 
such as headache, fatigue, arthralgia, depression, sexual dysfunction and 
hyperhidrosis; an increased prevalence of co-morbidities like diabetes, 
hypertension as well as cancer risk and a reduced life expectancy. Appropriate, 
modern, multimodal treatment of acromegaly has led to a significant improvement 
in quality of life, an adequate control of co-morbidities and a drastic 
reduction in the mortality rates that used to prevail in the past. This 
multimodal strategy includes an adequate selection of patients who are likely to 
benefit from surgical treatment (which has to be performed by a skilled 
pituitary neurosurgeon), the use of pharmacological interventions such as 
somatostatin analogs and dopamine agonists, which target the pituitary adenoma; 
and pegvisomant, a GH mutant acting as a competitive antagonist of the GH 
receptor. Radiation therapy is an important tool, particularly in parts of the 
World where resources are limited. The ultimate outcome of the individual 
patient depends on the judicious use of all these treatment options, which are 
critically analyzed in this mini-review.

Cystic fibrosis related diabetes.

O'Shea D(1), O'Connell J.

Author information:
(1)Department of Endocrinology, St. Vincent's University Hospital, Elm Park, 
Dublin 4, Ireland.

Improved life expectancy in cystic fibrosis (CF) has led to an expanding 
population of adults with CF, now representing almost 50 % of the total CF 
population. This creates new challenges from long-term complications such as 
diabetes mellitus (DM), a condition that is present in 40 %-50 % of adults with 
CF. Cystic fibrosis-related diabetes (CFRD) results from a primary defect of 
insulin deficiency and although sharing features with type 1 (DM1) and type 2 
diabetes (DM2), it is a clinically distinct condition. Progression to diabetes 
is associated with poorer CF clinical outcomes and increased mortality. CFRD is 
not associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and the 
prevalence of microvascular complications is lower than DM1 or DM2. Rather, the 
primary goal of insulin therapy is the preservation of lung function and 
optimization of nutritional status. There is increasing evidence that 
appropriate screening and early intervention with insulin can reverse weight 
loss and improve pulmonary function. This approach may include targeting 
postprandial hyperglycemia not detected by standard diagnostic tests such as the 
oral glucose tolerance test. Further clinical research is required to guide when 
and how much to intervene in patients who are already dealing with the burden of 
one chronic illness.

Osteoarthritis (OA), the most prevalent joint disease in adults, ranks among the 
top 5 causes of disability. The burden of OA is expected to be greater in 
developing countries, where life expectancy is increasing and access to joint 
replacement therapy is not readily available. Risk factors associated with knee 
OA in Africa may differ from those identified in other parts of the world. This 
study aimed to establish the prevalence, clinical presentation, and associated 
factors of knee OA in two large referral centers in Cameroon. Between February 
and July 2012, we performed a cross-sectional analysis of 148 patients with knee 
OA followed at two rheumatology units in Douala. We included all patients with 
mechanical knee pain, who fulfilled the 1986 ACR for the classification and 
reporting of knee OA. One thousand four hundred ninety-six patients with 
musculoskeletal complaints were seen; 148 (9.9%) with knee OA were analyzed. 
Mean age was 56.9 ± 10.7 years, 75% were females, and 68% were post-menopausal. 
The VAS of pain at the time of diagnosis was higher than 50/100 mm in 64.2% of 
patients. Mean pain duration was 1 year (7 months-3.5 years). Obesity (BMI > 30) 
was present in 52% of patients, hypertension in 37.2%, and diabetes in 8.8%. 
Knee x-ray showed 35.5% of patients with grades III and IV on Kellgren and 
Lawrence classification. Bilateral bi-compartmental knee OA was found in 38.5% 
of patients and bilateral tricompartmental in 14.2%. The mean Lequesne 
disability index (LDI) was 8.4 ± 2.8. Pain intensity did not correlate with 
radiological findings whereas there was an association between pain and LDI. 
Knee OA is not rare among patients in Cameroon. Multiple factors including 
limited access to health care may account for why knee OA patients present at 
later stages of the disease with severe disability.

Quality-adjusted time without symptoms or toxicity (Q-TWiST): patient-reported 
outcome or mathematical model? A systematic review in cancer.

University of Arizona Cancer Center, The University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA.

OBJECTIVE: Successful cancer treatment is defined as an increase in overall 
survival and/or progression-free survival. Despite their importance, these 
metrics omit patient quality of life. Quality-adjusted time without symptoms or 
toxicity (Q-TWiST) was developed to adjust survival gained, accounting for 
quality of life. The purpose of this systematic review was to assess the methods 
reported in cancer literature to determine Q-TWiST values and how these are 
currently translated to the clinic.
METHODS: The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses 
guidelines were used to conduct a systematic review of studies indexed on 
MEDLINE and Web of Science through April 2013. Cancer studies that measured 
Q-TWiST either as a primary outcome or retrospectively and determined utility 
coefficients from a patient population were identified, and their methods 
reviewed to determine how the utility coefficient was calculated. Additionally, 
other relevant factors such as definitions of health states and significant 
findings were collected and summarized.
RESULTS: Out of 284 studies, 11 were identified that calculated patient-defined 
utility coefficients. Several methods to determine utility coefficients were 
reported, and multiple definitions of health state toxicity were applied. Of 
these studies, seven reported significant differences (p < 0.05) in 
quality-adjusted survival. No studies, however, directly discussed the clinical 
relevance of their findings.
CONCLUSIONS: Currently, Q-TWiST is utilized as a mathematical theory rather than 
a clinical tool. Standardization of terminology plus reliability and validity 
testing of determining both utility coefficients and time frame definitions must 
be performed before Q-TWiST can become clinically useful to physicians and 
patients alike for making treatment decisions.

Utility values for specific hepatic encephalopathy health states elicited from 
the general public in the United Kingdom.

HA6 1BN, UK. julian.guest@catalyst-health.co.uk.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: To elicit utility values for five health states 
corresponding to increasing severity of hepatic encephalopathy, from members of 
the general public in the UK. The health states studied were Conn grades 0, 1, 
2, 3 and 4.
METHODS: Interviewer-administered time trade-off (TTO) and standard gamble (SG) 
utilities were elicited for the five health states from a random sample of 200 
members of the general public in the UK, using health state descriptions 
validated by clinicians and members of the general public.
RESULTS: Respondents' mean age was 49.5 years and 49% were female. Mean 
utilities were 0.962 (TTO) and 0.915 (SG) for Conn grade 0; 0.912 (TTO) and 
0.837 (SG) for Conn grade 1; 0.828 (TTO) and 0.683 (SG) for Conn grade 2; 0.691 
(TTO) and 0.489 (SG) for Conn grade 3; and 0.429 (TTO) and 0.215 (SG) for Conn 
grade 4. The TTO and SG values between the five Conn grades were significantly 
different (p < 0.001). Additionally, the TTO value was significantly higher than 
the SG value for the corresponding state (p <0.0001).
CONCLUSION: These findings quantify how different Conn grades and level of 
response to treatment may impact on the health-related quality of life of 
patients with hepatic encephalopathy. There were greater preference values for 
lower levels of disease, with the highest value associated with Conn grade 0. 
These health state preference values can be used to estimate the outcomes of 
different interventions for hepatic encephalopathy in terms of quality-adjusted 
life years.

Thomas' Hospital, Westminster Bridge Road, London, UK.

PURPOSE: To create a robust test object for the assessment of isotropic 
diffusion kurtosis and to investigate the relationships between barrier 
concentration and kurtosis and diffusion coefficients.
THEORY AND METHODS: Diffusion kurtosis imaging is an extension of conventional 
diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging which provides a means of 
assessing the degree to which diffusion processes of spin-bearing particles are 
non-Gaussian, a property that is quantified by the kurtosis. We present a set of 
test objects, each possessing a different concentration of colloidal dispersion, 
allowing barrier concentration of the dispersed colloidal particles to be 
related to the kurtosis of the water diffusion. Diffusion coefficients from the 
kurtosis model and the monoexponential model are compared.
RESULTS: A relationship between barrier concentration and kurtosis is found, 
demonstrating that the diffusion process becomes less Gaussian as the barrier 
concentration is increased. Differences in the two estimates for the diffusion 
coefficients are examined. The test object is robust, displaying long-term 
reproducibility of results.
CONCLUSIONS: Colloidal dispersions provide a suitable and stable test object for 
the assessment and reproducibility measurements of kurtosis.

INTRODUCTION: Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and cataract formation are 
common in older people. Medical management of symptomatic BPH is often preferred 
to surgical treatment as surgery increases the risk of morbidities, whereas, 
surgery is the main form of treatment to restore sight in patient with cataract. 
The clinical treatment of BPH is either alpha-1 adrenergic antagonist alone or 
combination of alpha reductase inhibitor and alpha adrenergic receptor (AR) 
antagonist. There are four alpha-AR antagonists currently available to treat 
BPH. The uroselective alpha-blocker tamsulosin is the most commonly used drug 
among all. Studies showed that the majority of the patients who develop 
intraoperative floppy iris syndrome (IFIS) were on tamsulosin. Women are more 
likely to develop cataract than men and some recent studies showed that 
tamsulosin is effective in treating female lower urinary tract symptoms and 
thereby can cause IFIS during cataract surgery.
EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: We performed a critical review of the published articles 
and abstracts on association of IFIS with alpha-blockers and other medications 
as well as other medical conditions.
EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Tamsulosin is the most common cause of formation of IFIS. 
However, not all patients given tamsulosin develop IFIS and cases have been 
reported without any tamsulosin treatment.
CONCLUSION: Tamsulosin is a recognized cause to impede mydriasis and lead to 
IFIS during cataract surgery. Urologist should collaborate with their 
ophthalmology colleagues and general practitioner during prescribing tamsulosin 
in patients with history of cataract or waiting for planned cataract surgery. 
The increasing life expectancy and growth of older people will increase the 
number of men and women who suffer from lower urinary tract symptoms as well as 
cataract. Therefore, further research and studies are required to properly 
understand the relation of alpha blockers and IFIS.

A unique case of bilateral synchronous testicular tumor with concomitant 
bilateral diffuse intratubular germ cell neoplasia: testis sparing surgery and 
local radiotherapy.

Synchronous bilateral testicular germ cell tumors (TGCTs) are seen in exteremely 
rare cases. Although there is still no standard therapy for bilateral TGCTs, 
bilateral orchiectomy is recommended as the gold standard treatment. 
Nevertheless, it has some long-term problems, such as infertility and 
psychosocial difficulties, and thus some clinicians prefer to perform 
testis-sparing surgery in appropriate cases. We reviewed the first case of 
bilateral synchronous TGCT with concomittant bilateral diffuse intratubular germ 
cell neoplasia in a young single patient, who was treated by a left radical 
orchiectomy and right testis sparing-surgery with following local radiotherapy 
to the right residual testicular tissue with previous semen cryopreservation to 
maintain the ability to father children. We supposed that testis-sparing surgery 
can be a feasible therapeutic alternative to radical orchiectomy in patients 
with bilateral TGCTs in terms of improving the quality of life and continuing 
fertility and normal hormonal status with no medications. However, while the 
long-term effects are not yet known, this type of treatment should be perpormed 
in carefully selected cases with longlife expectancy.

Medicine, Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam, the Netherlands.

BACKGROUND: Gastroenterology has over the past 30 years evolved very rapidly. 
The societal benefits to which this has led are incompletely determined, yet 
form a mandate to determine the need for future innovations and further 
development of the field. A more thorough understanding of societal benefits may 
help to determine future goals and improve decision making.
AIMS: The objective of this article is to determine the societal gains of 
medical innovations in the field of gastroenterology in the past and future, 
using peptic ulcer disease as an example of past innovation and the 
implementation of colorectal cancer screening as an illustration of future 
gains.
METHODS: Literature searches were performed for data on peptic ulcer and 
colorectal cancer epidemiology, treatment outcomes, and costs. National and 
governmental databases in the Netherlands were searched to obtain the input for 
calculations of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), health-adjusted life 
expectancy (HALE), and the corresponding societal benefit.
RESULTS: Since 1980 the improvements in peptic ulcer treatment have had a 
limited impact on life expectancy, rising from 83.6 years to 83.7 years, but 
have led to a yearly gain of 46,000 QALYs, caused by improved quality of life. 
These developments in the field of peptic ulcer translated into a yearly gain of 
1.8 billion to 7.8 billion euros in 2008 compared with the 1980s. Mortality due 
to colorectal cancer is high, with 21.6 deaths per 100,000 per year in the 
Netherlands (European Standardized Rate (ESR)). The future implementation of a 
nationwide call-recall colorectal cancer screening by means of biennial fecal 
immunochemical testing (FIT) is expected to result in a 50%-80% mortality 
reduction and thus a gain of an estimated 35,000 life years per year, 
corresponding to 26,000 QALYs per year. The effects of the implementation of FIT 
screening can be translated to a future societal gain of 1.0 billion to 4.4 
billion euro.
CONCLUSIONS: The innovations and developments in the field of gastroenterology 
have led to significant societal gains in the past three decades. This process 
will continue in the near future as a result of further developments. These 
calculations provide a template for calculations on the need for specialist 
training as well as research and implementation of new developments in our 
field.

Due to the aging population of Western countries and the high-quality health 
care system, breast cancer in the elderly generally affects women of good or 
satisfactory performance status pursuing active lifestyle. Over the last decade, 
it became evident that, in contrast to previous dogmas, age alone cannot be the 
contraindication to standard oncological treatment, and adequate 
multidisciplinary therapy aiming full recovery rather than compromise treatment 
is required. A number of specific aspects needs to be taken into account 
regarding surgery, such as life expectancy, co-morbidities, individual mobility, 
mental and emotional status as well as family background, which may result in 
changes to the individual treatment plan. Objective evaluation of the above 
mentioned parameters necessitates a close co-operation of professions. 
Interestingly, the evidence-based protocols of modern oncology often originate 
from the generalizations of results from clinical trials representing younger 
population, due to the typical under representation of elderly patients in 
clinical studies. Clinical trials should be extended to elderly patients as well 
or should specifically aim this patient population. The authors of the present 
paper review the special oncological and reconstructive surgical aspects of 
breast cancer in the elderly, such as breast conserving surgery versus 
mastectomia, sentinel lymph node biopsy, axillary lymphadenectomy or the 
omission of surgery in axillary staging, and questions regarding implant based 
and autologous reconstructive techniques.

Publisher: A „nyugati világ” népességének elöregedésével, a magas színvonalú 
egészségügyi ellátórendszernek köszönhetően, az időskori emlőrák általában jó 
állapotú, aktív életvitelű nőket érint. Az elmúlt évtizedben világossá vált, 
hogy az életkor önmagában nem kontraindikálja a standard kezeléseket, és nem 
kompromisszumos kezelgetés szükséges, hanem a teljes gyógyulást célzó 
multidiszciplináris terápia. A sebészi kezeléseknél számos speciális szempontot 
is figyelembe kell venni, mint a várható élettartam, társult betegségek, 
szellemi állapot, ami a kezelési tervet speciálisan módosíthatja. Az objektív 
megítélés a társszakmák szoros együttműködését szükségelteti. Érdekes módon, az 
onkológia bizonyítékokon alapuló vezérfonalai az időskori emlőrák területén

kiterjeszteni a klinikai vizsgálatokat. A szerzők áttekintik az időskori emlőrák 
speciális sebészeti szempontjainak szakirodalmát, mint az emlőmegtartó sebészet

The annual congress of the European Association of Urology in Stockholm was 
packed with mixed poster/oral sessions wherein innovative clinical and 
preclinical research aimed at improving the care of patients with urinary tract 
diseases was reported and open for discussion. Not everything that was reported 
during the meeting can be captured in a single report, but the following text 
will guide readers through the most significant new findings directly related 
with pharmacotherapy for overactive bladder, urinary tract cancer and other 
common medical conditions that endanger the quality of life and life expectancy 
of many patients worldwide.

Mobility, continence, and life expectancy in persons with Asia Impairment Scale 
Grade D spinal cord injuries.

Shavelle RM(1), Paculdo DR, Tran LM, Strauss DJ, Brooks JC, DeVivo MJ.

Author information:
(1)From the Life Expectancy Project, San Francisco, California (RMS, DRP, LMT, 
DJS, JCB); and Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, University of 
Alabama at Birmingham (MJD).

OBJECTIVE: Previous research on the life expectancy of persons with American 
Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) Impairment Scale Grade D spinal cord injury has 
considered them as a large homogenous group, making no functional or medical 
distinctions. This study sought to (1) determine how survival in this group 
depends on ambulatory function and the extent of bowel or bladder dysfunction, 
(2) compute life expectancies for various subgroups, and (3) examine whether 
survival has improved over time.
DESIGN: Data were from 8,206 adults with ASIA Impairment Scale Grade D spinal 
cord injury in the Spinal Cord Injury Model Systems database who were not 
ventilator dependent and who survived more than 1 yr after injury. There were a 
total of 114,739 person-years of follow-up and 1,730 deaths during the 1970-2011 
study period. Empirical age- and sex-specific mortality rates were computed. 
Regression analysis of survival data with time-dependent covariates was used to 
determine the effect of risk factors, to test for a time trend, and to estimate 
mortality rates for subgroups. Life expectancies were obtained from life tables 
constructed for each subgroup.
RESULTS: The ability to walk, whether independently or with an assistive device, 
was associated with longer survival than wheelchair dependence. The need for an 
indwelling catheter, and to a lesser extent intermittent catheterization, was 
associated with increased mortality risk. Persons who walked unaided and who did 
not require catheterization had life expectancies roughly 90% of normal. Those 
who required a wheelchair for locomotion had life expectancies comparable with 
that in paraplegia, less than 75% of normal. No time trend in survival was 
found.
CONCLUSIONS: Life expectancy of persons with ASIA Impairment Scale D spinal cord 
injury depends strongly on the ability to walk and the need for catheterization.

[Health of the homeless].

[Article in French]

Cha O.

The homeless population is difficult to define and its number difficult to 
evaluate. In France, it is estimated that almost 4 million people living in 
substandard accommodation, and 85,000 homeless people. Most homeless people 
rarely frequent public spaces. One-third have a job, one-quarter live with 
children, and one-third are between 18 and 29 years old. Shared characteristics 
include a collapse of social ties and a complete lack of stable accommodation. 
There are no illnesses specific to homeless people, but their epidemiology 
differs from the general population: the incidence rate of tuberculosis is 30 
times higher, for example. Medical care often arrives far too late. As a result, 
functional deficits are common, often following serious accidents, and 
hospitalization is three times more frequent. A chronic disease is present in 
45% of cases. Average life expectancy is only 47.6 years-between 30 and 35 years 
lower than for the general French population. Medical care can only be fully 
effective if these patients' social and housing issues are dealt with too.

Our objective was to determine the probability threshold for recurrent symptoms 
at which elective cholecystectomy compared to observation in older patients with 
symptomatic cholelithiasis is the more effective and cost-effective option. We 
built a decision model of elective cholecystectomy versus observation in
