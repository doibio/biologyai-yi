(difference; 0.95 QALYs) and lower costs (difference; $-1712).
CONCLUSIONS: Adoption of SES in the Egyptian healthcare settings is a more 
effective and cost-saving strategy. Our results are consistent with the WHO 
Injection Safety Program and Safe Injection Global Network initiatives, which 
call for adoption of smart syringes. The introduction of SES as one of the most 
urgently needed interventions is mostly encouraged to decrease hepatitis C 
burden in similar resource-limited settings. The use of SES as a prevention 
strategy may bring substantial population-level health gains and governmental 
cost savings in developing countries.

Neurological and neuropsychological outcome after resection of 
craniopharyngiomas.

Giese H, Haenig B, Haenig A, Unterberg A, Zweckberger K.

OBJECTIVE: Craniopharyngiomas are rare and benign tumors of the sellar and/or 
parasellar region. Primary treatment involves resection followed by adjuvant 
radiotherapy. While the grade of resection was frequently analyzed following 
surgery, the neurological outcome and especially neuropsychological deficits and 
quality of life have been neglected for many decades. Therefore, the authors 
retrospectively analyzed their patient series and prospectively assessed 
neuropsychological outcome and quality of life following resection of 
craniopharyngiomas in adults.
METHODS: In total, 71 patients (39 men and 32 women) with a mean age of 49 years 
were enrolled in the retrospective analysis. In addition, 36 of the 71 patients 
were included in the prospective arm of the study and underwent neurological and 
neuropsychological testing as well as quality of life (36-Item Short-Form Health 
Survey; SF-36) assessment. Factors influencing outcome were identified and 
correlations calculated.
RESULTS: Resection was performed mostly using a pterional (41.6%, 47/113 
surgical procedures) or bifrontal translamina terminalis (30.1%, 34/113 surgical 
procedures) approach. Following surgery, visual acuity was significantly 
improved (> 0.2 diopters) in 32.4% (23/71) of patients, or remained stable in 
45.1% (32/71) of patients. During long-term follow up, 80.3% (57/71) of patients 
developed pituitary insufficiency, particularly involving the corticotropic and 
thyrotrophic axes. In total, 75% (27/36) of patients showed neuropsychological 
deviations in at least 1 test item. In particular, attentiveness, cognitive 
speed, and short-term memory were affected. Referring to the SF-36 score, 
quality of life was affected in both the mental and physical score in 19.4% 
(7/36) and 33.3% (12/36), respectively. The risk factors that were identified 
were a tumor volume larger than 9 cm3, tumor extension toward/into the third 
ventricle or the brainstem, and resection using a bifrontal translamina 
terminalis or left-sided approach.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that resection of craniopharyngiomas is 
frequently associated with postoperative neuropsychological deficits and hence 
an impaired quality of life. In addition to tumor size and extension toward/into 
the third ventricle or the brainstem, selection of the surgical approach may 
play a crucial role in the patient's neuropsychological outcome and quality of 
life.

A reference set of Health State Utility Values for gambling problem behaviour, a 
survey of the Australian general population: implications for future healthcare 
evaluations.

Australia.

Objectives: This study sought to investigate the impact of gambling habits on 
HSUVs and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) using SF-36 measure in the 
Australian general population.Methods: Using the 2015 wave of Household Income 
and Labour Dynamics in Australian survey (n = 17,606) age- and gender-specific 
HSUVs were estimated according to the severity of gambling problem (measured by 
the Problem Gambling Severity Index). OLS and Tobit regression models were used 
to control for demographic and other confounding factors. Marginal effects of 
the gambling statuses for the expected value of HSUV were estimated to calculate 
quality-adjusted life year (QALY) loss attributed to gambling.Results: The 
predicted HSUVs on Australian weights for low- and moderate-risk and problem 
gamblers were -0.030 (95%CI -0.060 to -0.000), -0.057 (95%CI -0.089 to -0.025) 
and -0.181 (95%CI -0.239 to -0.123) less than non-gamblers &/or non-problem 
gamblers. Low HSUVs related to gambling behavior were predicted by age, gender, 
education, and employment. Gambling was responsible for 443.44 (95%CI -695.16 to 
-188.13) QALY losses in 2015 in the Australian general population.Conclusion: 
Gambling is significantly and negatively associated with HRQoL and HSUVs and the 
magnitude of this association is determined by the severity of the gambling 
problem.

Management of older people on dialysis requires focus on the wider aspects of 
aging as well as dialysis. Recognition and assessment of frailty is vital in 
changing our approach in elderly patients. Current guidelines in dialysis have a 
limited evidence base across all age group, but particularly the elderly. We 
need to focus on new priorities of care when we design guidelines "for people 
not diseases". Patient-centered goal-directed therapy, arising from shared 
decision-making between physician and patient, should allow adaption of the 
dialysis regime. Hemodialysis (HD) in the older age group can be complicated by 
intradialytic hypotension, prolonged time to recovery, and access-related 
problems. There is increasing evidence relating to the harm associated with the 
delivery of standard thrice-weekly HD. Incremental HD has a lower burden of 
treatment. There appears to be no adverse clinical effects during the first 
years of dialysis in presence of a significant residual kidney function. The 
advantages of incremental HD might be particularly important for elderly 
patients with short life expectancy. There is a need for more research into 
specific topics such as the assessment of the course of frailty with progression 
of chronic kidney disease and after dialysis initiation, the choice of dialysis 
modality impacting on the trajectory of frailty, the timing of dialysis 
initiation impacting on frailty or on other outcomes. In conclusion, 
understanding each individual's goals of care in the context of his or her life 
experience is particularly important in the elderly, when overall life 
expectancy is relatively short, and life experience or quality of life may be 
the priority.

Amylosucrase (AS) is a glycosyltransferase that produces linear α-1,4 glucans 
using sucrose as the sole substrate. In this study, for various applications, 
α-glucan-coated starch (α-GCS) was produced by AS (20 U/Lreactant) from 
Neisseria polysaccharea to improve the physicochemical properties of raw normal 
corn starch (NCS) by applying different reaction conditions (i.e., varying the 
substrate concentration, pH, and temperature). Field-emission scanning electron 
microscopy (FE-SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) showed that raw NCS was 
successfully coated by α-glucan. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and 
rapid viscosity analyses (RVA) of the α-GCS confirmed that the α-glucan coating 
decreased the degree of retrogradation. Notably, compared to raw NCS as a 
control, starch retrogradation was significantly (p < 0.05) decreased by 13.7% 
after five weeks. Therefore, the novel α-GCS can be applied as a functional 
material for controlled retrogradation in the starch-based food industry for 
shelf-life extension.

Liver-intestine cadherin (CDH17) has been known to function as a tumor 
stimulator and diagnostic marker for almost two decades. However, its function 
in highly malignant pancreatic cancer (PC) has yet to be elucidated. Using 
different strategies including siRNA, shRNA, and CRISPR technology, we 
successfully induced knockdown and knockout of CDH17 in Panc02-H7 cells and 
established the corresponding stable cell lines. With these cells, we 
demonstrated that loss of CDH17 function not only suppressed Panc02-H7 cell 
growth in vitro but also significantly slowed orthotopic tumor growth in vivo, 
resulting in the significant life extension. In vitro studies demonstrated that 
impairing CDH17 inhibited cell proliferation, colony formation, and motility by 
mechanistically modulating pro- and anti-apoptosis events in PC cells, as CDH17 
suppression obviously increased expression of Bad, cytochrome C, cleaved caspase 
3, and cleaved PARP, and reduced expression of Bcl-2, Survivin, and pAkt. In 
vivo studies showed CDH17 knockout resulted in apoptotic PC tumor death through 
activating caspase-3 activity. Taken together, CDH17 functions as an oncogenic 
molecule critical to PC growth by regulating tumor apoptosis signaling pathways 
and CDH17 could be targeted to develop an anti-PC therapeutic approach.

BACKGROUND: Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) has shown promise in identifying 
subclinical nodal metastasis in patients with high-risk cutaneous squamous cell 
carcinoma. However, low metastasis rates may indicate that performing such a 
procedure in all patients may be unnecessary and costly.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A decision model was developed to analyze costs and 
survival in patients with head and neck cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma based 
on their tumor and nodal metastasis staging and whether or not they received an 
SLNB. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated based on the change 
in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and costs (US$) between the different 
options, with a threshold of $100,000 to determine the most cost-effective 
strategy. One-way, two-way, and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were 
performed to validate the results.
RESULTS: Not performing an SLNB results in 12.26 QALYs and a cost of $3712.98. 
Performing an SLNB resulted in a 0.59 decrease in QALYs and an increase in cost 
of $1379.58 for an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of -2338.27. This trend 
remained the same across all tumor stages and remained consistent within most 
sensitivity analyses.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with head and neck cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, 
the most cost-effective strategy is to not perform SLNBs, regardless of the 
patient's stage. Low rates of nodal metastasis in addition to low 
disease-specific death rates were the significant factors in this outcome. 
Increasing the sensitivity of SLNB would not impact this recommendation unless 
the rate of nodal metastasis was significantly higher.

Statin-based treatments reduce cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in patients 
with non-dialysis chronic kidney disease (CKD), but it is unclear which regimen 
is the most cost-effective. We used the Study of Heart and Renal Protection 
(SHARP) CKD-CVD policy model to evaluate the effect of statins and ezetimibe on 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and health care costs in the United States 
(US) and the United Kingdom (UK). Net costs below $100,000/QALY (US) or 
£20,000/QALY (UK) were considered cost-effective. We investigated statin 
regimens with or without ezetimibe 10 mg. Treatment effects on cardiovascular 
risk were estimated per 1-mmol/L reduction in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) 
cholesterol as reported in the Cholesterol Treatment Trialists' Collaboration 
meta-analysis, and reductions in LDL cholesterol were estimated for each 
statin/ezetimibe regimen. In the US, atorvastatin 40 mg ($0.103/day as of 
January 2019) increased life expectancy by 0.23 to 0.31 QALYs in non-dialysis 
patients with stages 3B to 5 CKD, at a net cost of $20,300 to $78,200/QALY. 
Adding ezetimibe 10 mg ($0.203/day) increased life expectancy by an additional 
0.05 to 0.07 QALYs, at a net cost of $43,600 to $91,500/QALY. The 
cost-effectiveness findings and policy implications in the UK were similar. In 
summary, in patients with non-dialysis-dependent CKD, the evidence suggests that 
statin/ezetimibe combination therapy is a cost-effective treatment to reduce the 
risk of CVD.

BACKGROUND: Pancreatico-enteric anastomosis after pancreaticoduodenectomy can be 
performed using either a pancreaticojejunostomy (PJ) or pancreaticogastrostomy 
(PG). Differences in surgical outcomes are still a matter of debate, and less is 
known about long-term functional outcomes.
METHODS: Twelve years after the conclusion of a comparative study evaluating the 
surgical outcomes of PJ and PG (Bassi et al., Ann Surg 2005), available patients 
underwent morphological and functional pancreatic assessment: pancreatic volume 
and duct diameter measured by MRI, impaired secretion after secretin, fecal fat, 
fecal elastase-1 (FE-1), serum vitamin D and endocrine function. Quality of life 
and symptom scores were evaluated with the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire.
RESULTS: Only 34 patients were available for assessment. No differences were 
found in terms of BMI variation, endocrine function, quality of life or 
symptoms. Exocrine function was more severely impaired after PG than after PJ 
(fecal fats 26.6 ± 4.1 vs 18.2 ± 3.6 g/day; FE-1 121.4 ± 6.7 vs 
170.2 ± 25.5 μg/g, vitamin D 18.1 ± 1.8 vs. 23.2 ± 3.1 ng/mL). MRI assessment 
identified a lower pancreatic volume (26 ± 3.1 vs. 36 ± 4.1 cm3) and a more 
dilated pancreatic duct (4.6 ± 0.92 vs. 2.4 ± 0.18 mm) in patients with PG 
compared to those with PJ.
CONCLUSION: Compared to PJ, PG is associated with a more severely impaired 
exocrine function long-term, but they result similar endocrine function and 
quality of life. In patients with a long life expectancy, this should be taken 
into account.

Next-Generation Sequencing vs Culture-Based Methods for Diagnosing 
Periprosthetic Joint Infection After Total Knee Arthroplasty: A 
Cost-Effectiveness Analysis.

Lebanon, NH.

BACKGROUND: Periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) after total knee arthroplasty 
is challenging to diagnose. Compared with culture-based techniques, 
next-generation sequencing (NGS) is more sensitive for identifying organisms but 
is also less specific and more expensive. To date, there has been no study 
comparing the cost-effectiveness of these two methods to diagnose PJI after 
total knee arthroplasty.
METHODS: A Markov, state-transition model projecting lifetime costs and 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) was constructed to determine the 
cost-effectiveness from a societal perspective. The primary outcome was 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, with a willingness-to-pay threshold of 
$100,000/QALY. Sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate parameter 
assumptions.
RESULTS: At our base case values, culture was not determined to be 
cost-effective compared to NGS, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 
$422,784 per QALY. One-way sensitivity analyses found NGS to be the 
cost-effective choice above a pretest probability of 45.5% for PJI. In addition, 
NGS was cost-effective if its sensitivity was greater than 70.0% and its 
specificity greater than 94.1%. Two-way sensitivity analyses revealed that the 
pretest probability and test performance parameters (sensitivity and 
specificity) were the largest factors for identifying whether a particular 
strategy was cost-effective.
CONCLUSION: The results of our model suggest that the cost-effectiveness of NGS 
to diagnose PJI depends primarily on the pretest probability of PJI and the 
performance characteristics of the NGS technology. Our results are consistent 
with the idea that NGS should be reserved for clinical contexts with a high 
pretest probability of PJI. Further study is required to determine the 
indications and subgroups for which NGS offers clinical benefit.

BACKGROUND: Venezuela is one of the most violent countries in the world. 
According to the United Nations, homicide rates in the country increased from 
32.9 to 61.9 per 100 000 people between 2000 and 2014. This upsurge coincided 
with a slowdown in life expectancy improvements. We estimate mortality trends 
and quantify the impact of violence-related deaths and other causes of death on 
life expectancy and lifespan inequality in Venezuela.
METHODS: Life tables were computed with corrected age-specific mortality rates 
from 1996 to 2013. From these, changes in life expectancy and lifespan 
inequality were decomposed by age and cause of death using a continuous-change 
model. Lifespan inequality, or variation in age at death, is measured by the 
standard deviation of the age-at-death distribution.
RESULTS: From 1996 to 2013 in Venezuela, female life expectancy rose 3.57 [95% 
confidence interval (CI): 3.08-4.09] years [from 75.79 (75.98-76.10) to 79.36 
(78.97-79.68)], and lifespan inequality fell 1.03 (-2.96 to 1.26) years [from 
18.44 (18.01-19.00) to 17.41 (17.30-18.27)]. Male life expectancy increased 1.64 
(1.09-2.25) years [from 69.36 (68.89-59.70) to 71.00 (70.53-71.39)], but 
lifespan inequality increased 0.95 (-0.80 to 2.89) years [from 20.70 
(20.24-21.08) to 21.65 (21.34-22.12)]. If violence-related death rates had not 
risen over this period, male life expectancy would have increased an additional 
1.55 years, and lifespan inequality would have declined slightly (-0.31 years).
CONCLUSIONS: As increases in violence-related deaths among young men (ages 
15-39) have slowed gains in male life expectancy and increased lifespan 
inequality, Venezuelan males face more uncertainty about their age at death. 
There is an urgent need for more accurate mortality estimates in Venezuela.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR) is experiencing a 
demographic shift towards rapid aging at a time of political unrest. We aimed to 
estimate the burden of neurodegenerative disorders and its relationship with 
sociodemographic index in the EMR countries from 1990 to 2016.
METHODS: Using data from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2016, we calculated 
country-specific trends for prevalence, mortality, disability-adjusted 
life-years (DALY), years of life lost and years lived with disability (YLD) for 
Alzheimer's disease/other dementias and Parkinson's disease in the EMR during 
1990-2016.
RESULTS: In the EMR, the age-standardized prevalence rate of Alzheimer's 
disease/other dementias and Parkinson's disease was estimated at 759.8/100 000 
(95% uncertainty intervals, 642.9-899.9) and 87.1/100 000 (95% uncertainty 
intervals, 69.8-108.2) people in 2016, demonstrating 0.01% and 42.3% change from 
1990, respectively. Neurodegenerative disorders contributed to 5.4% of total 
DALY and 4.6% of total YLD among the older EMR population (70 years of age or 
older in 2016). Age-standardized DALY due to Parkinson's disease were strongly 
correlated with the sociodemographic index level (r = 0.823, P < 0.001). The 
YLD:DALY ratio of neurodegenerative diseases declined during this period in the 
low-income but not the high-income EMR countries.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrated an increasing trend in the burden of 
dementias and Parkinson's disease in most EMR countries between 1990 and 2016. 
With aging of the EMR populations, countries should target the modifiable risk 
factors of neurodegenerative diseases to control their increasing burden.

Objectives: To analyze the status quo and trends on the burden of 
cerebrovascular diseases between 1990 and 2016 in China. Methods: Morbidity 
mortality, years of life lost (YLL), years of lived with disability (YLD) and 
disability-adjusted life year (DALY) related to cerebrovascular diseases between 
1990 and 2016, were collated and analyzed, according to the results of the 
Global Burden of Diseases Study 2016 (GBD 2016). Numbers on incidence and 
morbidity were used to assess the incidence of diseases, while the numbers of 
death and mortality were used to assess the death of diseases. Years of life 
lost due to premature death (YLL), years lost due to disability (YLD) and 
disability-adjusted life year (DALY) were used to assess the burden of diseases. 
Changing trend on the burden of cerebrovascular disease from 1990 to 2016 was 
also analyzed. Results: In 2016 and 1990, the numbers of new cases/morbidity and 
the number of deaths/mortality on cerebrovascular diseases in the country showed 
an upward trend. Rates regarding YLL and DALY on cerebrovascular diseases 
remained stable from 1990 to 2016, however, the YLD rate showed a slow upward 
trend. The changing rate of DALY was mainly influenced by YLL. Both DALY and YLL 
crude rates in males showed a slow upward trend, with the highest DALY rate 
appearing in the ≥70 age group. Disease burden on males was heavier than that of 
the females and in the 50-60 age group, which taking the largest proportion. As 
for the composition in DALY, YLL appearing much larger than YLD and slowly 
increasing. Analysis on the subtypes of diseases, proportions of YLL and DALY in 
hemorrhagic stroke were greater than that in ischemic stroke while the 
proportion of YLD in ischemic stroke was in the opposite. Conclusions: The 
burden of disease on cerebrovascular diseases remained heavy and the differences 
appeared in age, gender and subtypes of diseases. Our findings called for the 
adoption of measures including screening, intervention and rehabilitation to be 
taken on target populations, in order to reduce the burden on both individuals 
and the society.

Publisher: 目的： 分析1990－2016年脑血管病在我国造成的疾病负担现状和趋势，为疾病预防和控制政策提供线索。 方法： 
应用2016年全球疾病负担研究的结果，采用死亡人数和死亡率评估死亡水平；采用发病人数和发病率评估发病水平；采用伤残损失寿命年（YLD）、过早死亡损失寿命年（YLL）和伤残调整寿命年（DALY）来评价我国不同年份、年龄、性别、疾病亚型的脑血管病疾病负担情况，并分析1990－2016年脑血管病的疾病负担的变化趋势。 
结果： 
与1990年相比，2016年我国脑血管病的发病人数（率）和死亡人数（率）都呈现上升趋势。1990－2016年脑血管病的YLL率、DALY率总体保持平稳，YLD率呈缓慢上升趋势，DALY率的变化主要来源于YLL率的变化；男性DALY、YLL粗率总体呈现缓慢上升趋势，≥70岁组DALY率最大；各指标性别、年龄组构成中，男性疾病负担较女性重，50~岁组所占比例最大；分性别、年龄组的DALY构成中，均为YLL所占比例远远大于YLD，YLD呈缓慢上升趋势；疾病亚型构成分析显示，出血性卒中的YLL和DALY占比大于缺血性卒中，缺血性卒中YLD占比大于出血性卒中。 
结论： 脑血管病的疾病负担较重，其在年龄、性别、疾病亚型等方面均存在差异，需采取针对性的筛查、干预、康复等措施，减轻其对个人及社会造成的负担。.

Objective: To estimate the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and 
health-adjusted life expectancy (HALE) which were associated with chronic 
non-communicable diseases (NCDs) in people from Guangdong province of China. 
Methods: Data on both NCDs prevalence and EuroQol-5 Dimensions-3 Levels measured 
HRQOL were gathered from the Fifth National Health Survey in Guangdong province, 
2013. Logistic regression model and multiple linear regression model were 
employed to explore the impact of NCDs on HRQOL. Life expectancy (LE) and HALE 
were used to evaluate the comprehensive impact of chronic diseases on population 
health. Results: A total of 68 550 inhabitants were included in the analysis. 
Graded logistic regression showed that the impact of chronic diseases on all 
dimensions of quality of life was statistically significant after adjusting for 
social demographic characteristics. The greatest health impact was on the 
pain/discomfort health dimension [OR=4.48 (95%CI:4.20-4.77)], followed by 
anxiety/depression[OR=3.95 (95%CI: 3.62- 4.31)], daily activities [OR=3.69 
(95%CI: 3.37-4.04)], mobility [OR=3.63 (95%CI: 3.34-3.94)]and ability on 
self-care [OR=3.30 (95%CI: 2.98-3.66)]. Losses of LE and HALE caused by NCDs 
were 12.7 and 14.6 years respectively while the overall expected gain was 3.8 
years in HALE, when NCDs were taken away. Conclusions: Our data showed that NCDs 
had shortened the healthy life span of patients through reducing the HRQOL and 
also causing heavy disease burden on both patients with NCDs and the 
communities. Health-care related policies on NCDs need to be developed, for the 
elderly, in particular.

Publisher: 目的： 分析广东省慢性病患者生存质量及健康调整期望寿命。 方法： 
基于广东省第五次全国卫生服务调查数据，通过欧洲五维度三水平健康量表对人群生存质量进行评价。运用多重线性回归和等级logistic回归评价慢性病对人群生存质量的影响，并用期望寿命和健康调整期望寿命指标评价慢性病对人群健康的综合影响。 
结果： 共纳入68 
550名居民数据进行分析，等级logistic回归显示在校正了社会人口学特征后，慢性病对生存质量各个维度的影响均有统计学意义，其中对疼痛/不舒服维度的影响最大[OR=4.48（95%CI：4.20~4.77）]，其余依次为焦虑/抑郁[OR=3.95（95%CI：3.62~4.31）]、日常活动[OR=3.69（95%CI：3.37~4.04）]、行动[OR=3.63（95%CI：3.34~3.94）]和自我照顾[OR=3.30（95%CI：2.98~3.66）]。慢性病患者期望寿命比非慢性病人群平均少12.7年，健康调整寿命平均减少14.6年（男性减少17.8年，女性减少9.7年）。人群去慢性病健康调整期望寿命收益为3.8年（男性为5.1年，女性为2.0年）。 
结论： 
慢性病会影响患者生存质量的各维度，从而减少患者的健康调整期望寿命，给人群和社会带来沉重的健康负担。从卫生政策和卫生资源优化配置的角度看，需为慢性病患者尤其是为老年患者提供更全面可及的医疗照护，照护需不仅关注生理健康也要注重心理健康。.

Use of gestational surrogates for women with Eisenmenger syndrome: a 
cost-effectiveness analysis.

Objective: Eisenmenger syndrome (ES) is regarded as a contraindication to 
pregnancy, with therapeutic abortion recommended in the event of unintended 
pregnancy. However, women with ES continue to desire and attempt pregnancy 
despite grave risks to their own health. This study compares the costs and 
outcomes of pregnancy in women with ES to the use of gestational surrogates in 
their pregnancies.Study design: A decision-analytic model was built using 
TreeAge software that compared use of gestational surrogates and pregnancy in 
women with ES. Maternal death and neonatal outcomes including intrauterine fetal 
demise, preterm birth, cerebral palsy, and death were assessed. All 
probabilities and costs were derived from the literature. Utilities were 
discounted at a rate of 3% across the expected lifespan to generate 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Univariate and multivariate sensitivity 
analyses were performed to evaluate the robustness of the model given changes in 
baseline assumptions.Results: In a theoretical cohort of 1000 women with ES, 
pregnancy would result in 360 maternal deaths, 100 stillbirths, 477 preterm 
births, and 157 neonatal deaths . In these highly desired pregnancies, use of 
gestational surrogates would prevent 99 and 98% of maternal and neonatal death, 
respectively. Cases and costs of preterm birth and associated cerebral palsy are 
also significantly reduced. Use of a gestational surrogate would save $518,255 
per woman with a gain of 6.77 QALYs, a dominant strategy. The approach is 
cost-effective up to a cost of surrogacy of $1.2 million and even if the 
surrogate achieves pregnancy only 30% of the time.Conclusions: The use of 
surrogate mothers for those with ES is cost-effective and results in 
significantly improved maternal and neonatal outcomes. These benefits are robust 
in the face of high surrogacy costs largely due to the marked reduction in 
maternal mortality and preterm birth. These findings should be used to 
underscore the importance of broadening health care financing for 
medically-indicated assisted reproduction.

This study examined gender differences in the prevalence of heart disease in 
India in terms of type of care sought and biological risk factors. The analysis 
included 142,620 people aged 30 and above from the National Sample Survey 
Office's 71st round of 2014. While men and women have the same prevalence of 
seven per 1,000 persons, using a form of prevalence odds ratio the analysis 
indicated that women were likely to seek care at lower levels of service 
provision, even though they carried a higher level of multiple morbidities. This 
difference is not because of the survival effect of women living longer with 
heart diseases when compared to men. It is possible that women with heart 
disease complicated by multiple co-morbidities have limited treatment options. 
Nevertheless, these constraints are not entirely biological and therefore 
whether these are a consequence of gender discrimination in care options needs 
further examination.

INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: To assess the cost-effectiveness of edoxaban vs 
acenocoumarol in the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with 
nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) in Spain.
METHODS: Markov model, adapted to the Spanish setting from the perspective of 
the National Health System, stimulating the progression of a hypothetical cohort 
of patients with NVAF throughout their lifetime, with different health states: 
stroke, haemorrhage, and other cardiovascular complications. Efficacy and safety 
data were obtained from the available clinical evidence (mainly from the phase 
III ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 study). The costs of managing NVAF and its complications 
were obtained from Spanish sources.
RESULTS: Edoxaban use led to 0.34 additional quality-adjusted life years (QALY) 
compared with acenocoumarol. The incremental cost with edoxaban was 3916€, 
mainly because of higher pharmacological costs, which were partially offset by 
lower costs of treatment monitoring and managing NVAF events and complications. 
The cost per QALY was 11 518€, within the thresholds commonly considered 
cost-effective in Spain (25 000-30 000 €/QALY). The robustness of the results 
was confirmed by various sensitivity analyses.
CONCLUSIONS: Edoxaban is a cost-effective alternative to acenocoumarol in the 
prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with NVAF in Spain.

The sex- and duration-dependent effects of intermittent fasting on lifespan and 
reproduction of spider mite Tetranychus urticae.

BACKGROUND: Intermittent fasting (IF) is receiving increasing attention as an 
alternative to continuous restriction of calories because of its benefits in 
aging-related disease prevention and lifespan extension. However, whether both 
sexes with sexual dimorphism have similar response to IF have rarely been 
assayed. In this study, we determined how different durations of IF influence 
lifespan and whether males and females differed in their responses to IF. We 
also tested whether there is a trade-off between lifespan and lifetime 
reproduction in females under IF.
METHOD: We used spider mite Tetranychus urticae, with female-biased sexual size 
dimorphism (SSD), as our model species to investigate the survival and lifespan 
difference of both sexes at different durations of IF regimes, and explore the 
association between longevity and fecundity in females within and across 
treatments.
RESULTS: The lifespan of females increased before intermediate level of IF and 
then decreased afterwards, but males showed a decreasing trend in lifespan when 
subjected to IF. Within each treatment, female longevity was positively 
associated with their fecundity. However, the females fed ad libitum had a 
higher lifetime fecundity with a shorter lifespan, whereas mites fed 50% IF 
outlived ad libitum fed ones with lower fecundity because of the later onset of 
reproduction and lower daily fecundity, showing clear survival and reproduction 
trade-off when variation of resource availability enhanced across treatments.
CONCLUSION: We showed sex-specific response to IF in lifespan, indicating that 
sexes with SSD have different optimal level of IF. These findings showed 
trade-off between survival and reproduction between treatments but not within 
treatments, suggesting that variation in resource availability is the necessary 
precondition for life history trade-off, and IF extends lifespan of females at 
the cost of reproductive success.

As life expectancy is on the rise, it is predicted that a growing number of 
people will live beyond the age of 65 and therefore a higher number of elderly 
women will have breast diseases requiring significant health care and services. 
This study is aimed at investigating the characteristics, the treatment and 
outcomes of women older than 65 years old treated for breast diseases at our 
institution. This was a retrospective study covering the period from January 
2003 to December 2011. It involved 92 patients aged over 65 and treated for 
breast disease in the Maternity Center of Monastir, Tunisia. The data included 
characteristics of patients and tumors, treatment and outcomes that were 
obtained through data extraction sheets. We reported a study of 92 women over 
the age of 65 of whom 77 women had malignant breast disease (83.6%) and 15 
benign breast diseases (16.4%). Breast cancer was discovered at a mean age of 
72.5 ± 6.6 years. Distant metastases were found in 5.3% of cases and 
infiltrative ductal carcinoma was detected in 85.7% of patients. Hormonal 
receptors were positive for estrogens in 64.7% of cases. Surgical treatment was 
performed in 73 patients and adjuvant treatment was prescribed for 67 women 
(86%). The complication rate was 16.6% among the 73 patients who underwent 
surgery. Benign breast diseases represented 16.3% of the mammary pathologies. 
Abscesses and fibrocystic mastopathy were the most frequent histological 
diagnoses. Despite great interest in geriatric gynecological pathology 
worldwide, many questions related to how optimally treat this patient population 
remain unanswered. In this study, a surgical treatment was performed in 94.8% of 
breast cancer patients and the complication rate was 16.6%.

BACKGROUND: This paper examines changes in substance use, and compares the 
resulting attributable burden of disease in the WHO European Region between 2010 
and 2016.
METHODS: Data for 2010 and 2016 on the number of deaths, years of life lost 
(YLL) and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) lost were obtained by sex and 
country from the 2016 Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study. Exposure data for 
all substances except alcohol were obtained from the same study, while alcohol 
data were obtained from the WHO. Proportional changes were calculated for the 
WHO European Region as a whole to identify trends and for sub-regions to 
identify which regions contributed most to trends.
RESULTS: In the WHO European Region in 2016, substance use caused 2.1 million 
deaths, 48.6 million YLL and 57.9 million DALYs lost, representing 22.4, 29.0 
and 20.4% of all deaths, YLL and DALYs, respectively. The substance-attributable 
burden of disease was higher among men than women and highest in the eastern 
parts of the WHO European Region. Changes in the number of deaths, YLL and DALYs 
lost between 2010 and 2016 were almost uniformly downward, with the largest 
proportional changes observed for men. Exposure to tobacco, alcohol and illicit 
drugs also decreased uniformly.
CONCLUSIONS: Substance use and its attributable mortality and burden of disease 
have decreased in the WHO European Region since 2010. However, overall levels of 
substance use and the resulting burden of disease in the Region remain high 
compared with other regions of the world.

Graduate students and postdoctoral researchers (postgraduates) in the life 
sciences frequently mentor undergraduate researchers, especially at research 
universities. Yet there has been only modest investigation of this relationship 
from the postgraduate perspective. We conducted an exploratory study of the 
experiences of 32 postgraduate mentors from diverse institutions, life sciences 
disciplines, and types of research to examine their motivations for mentoring 
and their perceived outcomes. Although some postgraduates reported feeling 
pressured to mentor undergraduate researchers, all expressed personal 
motivations, including both agentic (self-focused) and communal 
(community-focused) motivations. These postgraduates reported benefits and costs 
of mentoring that had both vocational and psychosocial elements. Given that our 
results indicated that even postgraduates who engaged in mentoring at the 
request of their faculty advisors had their own motivations, we conducted a 
second phase of analysis to determine the extent to which our results aligned 
with different theories of motivation (self-determination theory, social 
cognitive career theory, expectancy-value theory, social exchange theory). We 
end by proposing a model of postgraduate mentoring of undergraduate researchers 
that integrates the theories supported by our findings.
