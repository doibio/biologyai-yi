cost-effective alternative to established imaging tests.
DESIGN: Decision model and cost-effectiveness analysis.
DATA SOURCES: Literature review and meta-analysis.
TARGET POPULATION: 55-year-old men and 65-year-old women presenting with chest 
pain.
TIME HORIZON: Lifetime of the patient.
PERSPECTIVE: Health care policy.
INTERVENTIONS: MRI, electron-beam CT, exercise echocardiography, exercise 
single-photon emission CT, and coronary angiography.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Target sensitivity and specificity values for a new 
noninvasive test.
RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: Assuming that society is willing to pay $75000 
per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained, a new test that costs $1000 would 
need a sensitivity of 94% and a specificity of 90% to be cost-effective.
RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: Assuming that society is willing to pay $50000 
per QALY gained, a new test that costs $1000 or more would never be 
cost-effective. For a test that costs $500, the sensitivity and specificity must 
each be 95%.
CONCLUSIONS: New imaging techniques, such as MRI and electron-beam CT, must be 
relatively inexpensive and have excellent sensitivity and specificity to be 
cost-effective compared with other techniques for the diagnosis of coronary 
artery disease. Similar analyses in other areas of health care may help to focus 
the development of new diagnostic technology.

PURPOSE: To examine whether high intraocular pressure (greater than or equal to 
25 mm Hg) or a history of treatment for glaucoma is associated with decreased 
survival and, if so, how such ocular markers might be explained.
METHODS: Eye examinations, including applanation tonometry, were conducted on 
members of the Framingham Eye Study cohort from February 1, 1973, to February 1, 
1975. Participants who reported a history of treatment for glaucoma were 
identified. Survival data, including information on the date of death, were 
available from the time of the Eye Study through March 31, 1990.
RESULTS: Of the 1,764 persons under the age of 70 years at the baseline eye 
examination, 1,421 persons had low intraocular pressure (< or =20 mm Hg), 264 
persons had medium intraocular pressure levels (20 to 24 mm Hg), and 79 persons 
had high intraocular pressure (> or =25 mm Hg) or history of glaucoma treatment. 
During the follow-up period, 29%, 30%, and 47% died in the groups with low, 
medium, and high intraocular pressure (or history of glaucoma treatment), 
respectively. In an age-and-sex adjusted Cox proportional hazards analysis, the 
death rate ratio for the group with medium intraocular pressure relative to the 
group with low intraocular pressure was 1.04. The corresponding death rate ratio 
for the group with high intraocular pressure was 1.56 with a 95% confidence 
interval of 1.11 to 2.19 (P < .001). After adjustment for age, sex, 
hypertension, diabetes, cigarette smoking, and body mass index, a positive 
relationship remained, but at a borderline level of significance (P = .075).
CONCLUSIONS: High intraocular pressure or the presence of glaucoma is a marker 
for decreased life expectancy in the Framingham Eye Study cohort. The 
relationship is present even after adjustment for risk factors known to be 
associated with higher mortality such as age, sex, hypertension, diabetes, 
cigarette smoking, and body mass index. Special attention to the general health 
status of patients with high intraocular pressure or glaucoma seems warranted.

OBJECTIVE: To describe the results of the lung transplantation programme in 
Groningen in relation to the bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS), in the 
first 118 consecutive patients.
DESIGN: Retrospective.
METHOD: Data were collected on the 118 patients subjected to lung 
transplantation in November 1990 to June 1998 in the University Hospital 
Groningen, the Netherlands, regarding the prevalence of chronic transplant 
dysfunction (BOS) and survival.
RESULTS: 117 lung transplantations (95 bilateral lung transplantations including 
2 retransplants, and 22 single lung transplantations) and 1 heart-lung 
transplantation had been performed. The patients were 70 males and 48 females 
with a mean age of 42 years (range: 9-64). The mean (SD) survival at 1, 2, 3 and 
5 years post transplantation was 83% (3), 70% (4), 66% (5) and 61% (5) 
respectively. The median survival amounted to 2447 days. The mean (SD) 
prevalence of BOS at respectively 1, 2, 3 and 5 years post transplantation was 
32% (5), 36% (5), 44% (5) en 54% (6). After a diagnosis of BOS stage I the 
median survival was 649 days.
CONCLUSION: The survival of the lung transplant programme of the University 
Hospital Groningen is considered to compare favourably with other centres. The 
prevalence of BOS is considerable, and comparable with the prevalence of BOS 
reported by other programmes. BOS is associated with a decreased life 
expectancy.

[The chronicity of HIV infection].

[Article in French]

Bordeaux.

The widespread use of highly active antiretroviral therapy led to a substantial 
decrease of HIV related-morbidity and mortality in industrialized countries. 
These recent advances allow to envisage a chronicity of HIV infection and led 
HIV infected people to set up a familial or professional life-project, difficult 
to imagine until now. The increase in life-expectancy is nevertheless closely 
dependent on the prolonged adherence of the patients to therapy, which justifies 
the development of strategies to increase medication compliance. The 
side-effects of long-term taken drugs often impair the quality of life of HIV 
infected people: abnormal fat distribution and atherogen hyperlipidemia and 
insulin resistance, mainly described with protease inhibitors, are new worrying 
concerns. Chronicity of HIV infection favours also the development of 
co-morbidity (HIV-HCV co-infection). The necessity of a more global and varied 
case management of people living with HIV is emerging simultaneously with a new 
dynamic of clinical research whose ultimal goal still remains the achievement of 
HIV eradication strategies.

The state of pediatric heart transplantation.

Suddaby EC(1).

Author information:
(1)Inova Fairfax Hospital for Children, Falls Church, VA 22042, USA.

Heart transplantation is now an accepted method for treatment of heart disease 
in children, but transplantation in pediatric recipients continues to present 
unique challenges. The differences in indications and the complexity of surgery 
for congenital heart disease are only two of those challenges. A successful 
means of mechanical support is not available, which puts children at special 
risk of dying while waiting for transplantation. In addition, physiologic 
differences produce issues about management after transplantation, including use 
of immunosuppressive agents, control of infection, identification of transplant 
coronary artery disease, and posttransplant lymphoproliferative disease. Because 
of the longer life expectancy desired from pediatric transplantation, 
measurement of quality of life must be more comprehensive. This broad range of 
special demands means that although the state of pediatric heart transplantation 
is positive, there are areas for continued improvement.

The research aimed at finding out the profile of 49 women with myocardial 
infarction hospitalized in two hospitals at São Paulo state. The following 
results were analysed according to the "Health Field Model": a) human biology: 
79.6% of them were from 50 to 80 years old; 71.4% hypertension; 57.2% 
overweight; 42.4% diabetes mellitus; 57.1% had a positive family history of 
hypertension; b) socioeconomic characterization: 63.2% housewives; 53% married; 
55.1% with a salary lower than 3 minimum wages and 51% illiterate; c) life 
style: 93.8% lived a sedentary life; 79.6% referred to daily stress and 34.7% 
are smokers; d) attention to health: 53.1% knew about their diagnosis and 48.9% 
were being treated in primary health services. According to the model there are 
risk factors to infarction in the four elements.

Theoretical Gompertzian implications on life span variability among 
genotypically identical animals.

Aging is a highly polygenic trait (Kirkwood, T.B.L., Franceschi, C., 1992. Is 
aging as complex as it would appear? Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences 
663, 412-417) who's underlying mechanisms are still unresolved. Animal models 
are an important help for understanding this process and a recent report drew 
attention to a putative gene which causes variability in the life span among 
genotypically identical mice (de Haan, G., Gelman, R., Watson, A., Yunis, E., 
van Zant, G., 1998. A putative gene causes variability in life span among 
genotypically identical mice. Nature Genetics 19, 114-116). De Haan et al. 
observed that the time between the death of the first and last member of a group 
of inbred mice (the death range) is controlled by a locus, which they mapped to 
chromosome 11. The authors conclude that well-known effects like modifiers, 
suppressors or epistatic genes might not be able to explain how this variability 
in genetically identical organisms is generated and that such a trait has broad 
implications for genetic studies of the aging process. Here we give a possible 
answer to the question of what mechanism could cause such a phenotype. We show 
that all genes which affect the Gompertz parameters are possible candidates.

Cancer Centre, Houston 77030, USA.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Solitary extramedullary plasmacytoma (EMP) represents a 
rare category of malignant disease on which there are limited data in regard to 
diagnosis, staging and natural history. This study attempted to clarify the 
clinical course of solitary extramedullary plasmacytoma after radiation or 
surgical therapy given with curative intent.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The diagnosis was based on a mass of clonal plasma cells 
separate from bone or bone marrow without evidence of occult disease elsewhere. 
Between 1963 and 1996, 22 previously untreated patients with an EMP were 
diagnosed. Disease presented in the head or neck in 86%, usually in the nasal 
cavity (NC) or maxillary sinus (MS), and in these areas local bone destruction 
was found in 10 of 11 patients. Among all patients, serum myeloma protein was 
present in three patients (14%) and Bence Jones protein alone was found in two 
patients (9%). Radiation therapy was the sole treatment for 18 of 22 patients, 
and the median radiotherapy dose was 50 Gy (range, 40-60 Gy); five of seven 
patients with an EMP of oral cavity (OC), oropharynx (OP), nasopharynx (NP), 
parotid or larynx also received elective neck irradiation. Two patients 
underwent surgery plus postoperative irradiation of a plasmacytoma of the 
sigmoid colon or pleura, and two patients had resection alone of a plasmacytoma 
of the colon or cervical lymph node.
RESULTS: Local control was achieved in 21 of 22 patients (95%), and disease 
never recurred in regional nodes. Disappearance of myeloma protein occurred in 
three of five patients with an evaluable abnormality. Multiple myeloma developed 
in seven patients (32%), all within 5 years. The 5-year rate of freedom from 
progression to multiple myeloma was 56% and the median survival was 9.5 years.
CONCLUSION: Radiation therapy achieved excellent locoregional control of EMP 
with an approximate cure fraction of 50%.

BACKGROUND: This review is about the patency of ductus arteriosus (PDA), with 
particular care concerning diagnosis, surgical techniques, survival and 
postoperative pregnancy in operated females.
METHODS: a) Sperimental study: the research has been conducted retrospectively 
and the follow-up is 40 years. b)
ENVIRONMENT: all the patients were operated on in the Division of Cardiac 
Surgery, University of Turin (public structure) and in the Italian Institution 
of Cardiac Surgery (private structure). c)
PATIENTS: from 1958 to 1987, 677 patients were operated on: mean age was 11.5 
+/- 8.7 years. A complete follow-up was made on 487 patients (72%). d) Technique 
of operation: left lateral thoracotomy was often performed; in younger children, 
however, the tying of PDA was frequently made within the pericardium by left 
anterior thoracotomy in the third intercostal space. In uncomplicated 
situations, PDA was tied more frequently than divided, by two purse string 
stitches and one or two transfixed ligatures. e)
SURVEY: overall early and late mortality, the clinical conditions of all 
patients, pregnancies and preor postoperative miscarriages of operated women 
were examined.
RESULTS: From 1958 to 1967 overall early mortality was 5%; during the following 
years, there was no hospital mortality. The recurrence of PDA occurred only in 4 
patients. 72% of the operated females became pregnant.
CONCLUSION: Life expectancy is normal after surgical closure of an uncomplicated 
PDA in infancy or in childhood but premature death may not always be avoided 
operating on adults with long-standing chronic congestive heart failure. At 
least, postoperative pregnancy is not a risk factor for the mother and PDA seems 
not to be correlated to foetal transmission.

Trends in world population: how will the millenium compare with the past?

Raleigh VS(1).

Author information:
(1)National Institute of Epidemiology, University of Surrey, Guildford, UK.

This paper reviews historical and projected trends in world population numbers, 
and the underlying determinants of those trends. Whereas the world's population 
has shown little change over most of its one million-year history, the past 200 
years have witnessed dramatic changes in fertility, mortality and population 
growth rates. Recent decades, in particular, have seen unprecedented demographic 
events, with more people added to the world's population in the past 50 years 
than in the preceding million. The demographic impact of HIV/AIDS, selective as 
it is to young adults and infants, is also unprecedented, with life expectancy 
among some populations reduced by almost 20 years. As we approach the end of the 
20th century, further demographic changes are underway with, for the first time 
in recent human history, a slowing down of world population growth. Nonetheless, 
world population is projected to grow from 6 billion currently to about 9.4 
billion by 2050 (medium fertility assumption), with ageing emerging as the most 
pressing demographic issue facing humanity in the millenium.

Differentiation between senescence (M1) and crisis (M2) in human fibroblast 
cultures.

Wei W(1), Sedivy JM.

Author information:
(1)Department of Molecular Biology, Cell Biology and Biochemistry, Division of 
Biology and Medicine, Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island 02912, USA.

Normal human fibroblasts undergo only a limited number of divisions in culture 
and eventually enter a nonreplicative state designated senescence or mortality 
stage 1 (M1). Expression of certain viral oncogenes, such as the SV40 large T 
antigen (SV40 T-Ag), can elicit a significant extension of replicative life 
span, but these cultures eventually also cease dividing. This proliferative 
decline has been designated crisis or mortality stage 2 (M2). BrdU incorporation 
assays are commonly used to distinguish between senescence (<5% labeling index) 
and crisis (>30% labeling index). It has not been possible, however, to 
ascertain whether the high labeling index, indicative of ongoing DNA 
replication, was caused by the presence of T-Ag. We used gene targeting to knock 
out both copies of the p21(CIP1/WAF1) gene in presenescent human fibroblasts. 
p21 -/- cells displayed an extended life span but eventually entered a 
nonproliferative state. In their terminally nonproliferative state both p21 +/+ 
and p21 -/- cultures were positive for the senescence-associated 
beta-galactosidase (SA-beta-gal) activity; in contrast, the labeling index of 
p21 +/+ cells was low (<5%) whereas the labeling index of p21 -/- cells was high 
(>30%). The observation that p21 -/- and SV40 T-Ag-expressing cells behave 
identically with respect to life span extension as well as the high labeling 
index in the terminally nonproliferative state indicates that crisis is not a 
phenomenon induced solely by viral oncogenes, but a physiological state 
resulting from the bypass of normal senescence mechanisms. The widely used 
biomarker for senescence, SA-beta-gal, cannot distinguish between senescence and 
crisis. We propose that all SA-beta-gal-positive cultures should be further 
examined for their BrdU labeling index.

Gene structure of mouse BIT/SHPS-1.

BIT/SHPS-1/SIRPalpha/P84 is a unique molecule with a high degree of homology 
with immune antigen recognition molecules (immunoglobulin, T-cell receptor and 
MHC), and is highly expressed in the brain. The extracellular region contains 
three immunoglobulin-like domains (V-type, C1-type and C1-type), and the 
intracellular region contains two signalling motifs that interact with SHP-2 
protein tyrosine phosphatase. BIT-coated plates support cell-substrate adhesion 
and neurite extension of neurons, and BIT participates in neuronal signal 
transduction. Diversity of the V-type domain sequences of human BIT has been 
reported. In the present study we analysed the structure of the mouse BIT gene 
(Bit). The protein coding region consists of eight exons corresponding to a 
signal peptide, a V-type domain, a C1-type domain, a C1-type domain, a 
transmembrane region and three parts of one cytoplasmic region. The two 
signalling motifs are encoded in one exon. Four splicing forms of mouse BIT were 
revealed. We also found the sequence diversity in three mouse strains, namely 
BALB/c, 129/Sv and C57BL/6. The substitution patterns of amino acids and 
nucleotides indicate positive pressure to alter the amino acids in the V-type 
domain in evolution. Immunoblot analyses showed that mouse BIT and human 
BITalpha are predominantly expressed in the brain. On the bases of these 
findings we discuss the possibility that BIT contributes to the genetic 
individuality and diversity of the brain.

Annual summary of vital statistics--1998.

Hygiene and Public Health, Baltimore, Maryland 21205, USA.

Most vital statistics indicators of the health of Americans were stable or 
showed modest improvements between 1997 and 1998. The preliminary birth rate in 
1998 was 14.6 births per 1000 population, up slightly from the record low 
reported for 1997 (14.5). The fertility rate, births per 1000 women aged 15 to 
44 years, increased 1% to 65.6 in 1998, compared with 65.0 in 1997. The 1998 
increases, although modest, were the first since 1990, halting the steady 
decline in the number of births and birth and fertility rates in the 1990s. 
Fertility rates for total white, non-Hispanic white, and Native American women 
each increased from 1% to 2% in 1998. The fertility rate for black women 
declined 19% from 1990 to 1996, but has changed little since 1996. The rate for 
Hispanic women, which dropped 2%, was lower than in any year for which national 
data have been available. Birth rates for women 30 years or older continued to 
increase. The proportion of births to unmarried women remained about the same at 
one third. The birth rate for teen mothers declined again for the seventh 
consecutive year, and the use of timely prenatal care (82.8%) improved for the 
ninth consecutive year, especially for black (73.3%) and Hispanic (74.3%) 
mothers. The number and rate of multiple births continued their dramatic rise; 
the number of triplet and higher-order multiple births jumped 16% between 1996 
and 1997, accounting, in part, for the slight increase in the percentage of low 
birth weight (LBW) births. LBW continued to increase from 1997 to 1998 to 7.6%. 
The infant mortality rate (IMR) was unchanged from 1997 to 1998 (7.2 per 1000 
live births). The ratio of the IMR among black infants to that for white infants 
(2.4) remained the same in 1998 as in 1997. Racial differences in infant 
mortality remain a major public health concern. In 1997, 65% of all infant 
deaths occurred to the 7.5% of infants born LBW. Among all of the states, Maine, 
Massachusetts, and New Hampshire had the lowest IMRs. State-by-state differences 
in IMR reflect racial composition, the percentage LBW, and birth weight-specific 
neonatal mortality rate for each state. The United States continues to rank 
poorly in international comparisons of infant mortality. Expectation of life at 
birth increased slightly to 76.7 years for all gender and race groups combined. 
Death rates in the United States continue to decline, including a drop in 
mortality from human immunodeficiency virus. The age-adjusted death rate for 
suicide declined 6% in 1998; homicide declined 14%. Death rates for children 
from all major causes declined again in 1998. A large proportion of childhood 
deaths, however, continue to occur as a result of preventable injuries.

University of Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.

Infectious diseases continue to exert a heavy toll on human health even in 
industrialized countries. Recent data from the World Health Organization 
suggests that infectious diseases are the leading cause of death in the world. 
Many changing trends in our society have a known or potential impact on 
infectious disease spread and may have an impact on the normal routine of home 
hygiene. Important amongst these societal trends are increasing population and 
life expectancy, changes in urbanization, grouping of susceptibles, increased 
ambulatory and home care, increased immunosuppression, increased and faster 
travel, changes in technology, increasing antibiotic resistance as a result of 
misuse of antibiotics, changes in food and water consumption, and changes in 
personal cleaning, washing, and laundry practices. This review will highlight 
these factors and their impact on home hygiene and steps that may be needed to 
reduce the risk from infections.

OBJECTIVE: Recently published data from the North American Carotid 
Endarterectomy Trial revealed a benefit for carotid endarterectomy (CEA) in 
symptomatic patients with moderate (50% to 69%) carotid stenosis. This benefit 
was significant but small (absolute stroke risk reduction at 5 years, 6.5%; 
22.2% vs 15.7%), and thus, the authors of this study were tentative in the 
recommendation of operation for these patients. To better elucidate whether CEA 
in symptomatic patients with moderate carotid stenosis is a proper allocation of 
societal resources, we examined the cost-effectiveness of this intervention.
METHODS: A decision-analytic Markov process model was constructed to determine 
the cost-effectiveness of CEA versus medical treatment for a hypothetical cohort 
of 66-year-old patients with moderate carotid stenosis. This model allowed the 
comparison of not only the immediate hospitalization but also the lifetime costs 
and benefits of these two strategies. Our measure of outcome was the 
cost-effectiveness ratio (CER), defined as the incremental lifetime cost per 
quality-adjusted life year saved. We assumed an operative stroke and death rate 
of 6.6% and a declining risk of ipsilateral stroke after the ischemic event with 
medical treatment (first year, 9.3%; second year, 4%; subsequent years, 3%). The 
hospitalization cost of CEA ($6,420) and the annual costs of major stroke 
($26,880), minor stroke ($798), and aspirin therapy ($63) were estimated from a 
hospital cost accounting system and the literature.
RESULTS: CEA for moderate carotid stenosis increased the survival rate by 0.13 
quality-adjusted life years as compared with medical treatment at an additional 
lifetime cost of $580. Thus, CEA was cost-effective with a CER of $4,462. 
Society is usually willing to pay for interventions with CERs of less than 
$60,000 (eg, CERs for coronary artery bypass grafting at $9,100 and for dialysis 
at $53,000). CEA was not cost-effective if the perioperative risk was greater 
than 11.3%, if the ipsilateral stroke rate associated with medical treatment at 
1 year was reduced to 4.3%, if the age of the patient exceeded 83 years, or if 
the cost of CEA exceeded $13,200.
CONCLUSION: CEA in patients with symptomatic moderate carotid stenosis of 50% to 
69% is cost-effective. Perioperative risk of stroke or death, medical and 
surgical stroke risk, cost of CEA, and age are important determinants of the 
cost-effectiveness of this intervention.

OBJECTIVE: Mutations in the TP53 gene are frequently detected in some types of 
malignant tumors (bladder, prostate, kidney, lungs, breast, colon and rectum). 
This study analyzed the utility of semi-quantitative determination of p53 in 
transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder by an immunohistochemical technique 
and evaluated the results at 5 years.
METHODS/RESULTS: A prospective clinical cohort study was conducted on 81 
patients. The study comprised two groups: nontumoral bladder tissue specimens 
from 20 patients (group I) and tissue specimens from 61 patients with bladder 
carcinoma (group II). In both groups the tissue specimens were obtained between 
November 1992 and November 1993, and during the follow-up period until July 
1998. p53 expression was determined by a semi-quantitative method based on an 
immunohistochemical technique (NCL-p53-DO7, Novocastra).
CONCLUSIONS: p53 oncoprotein was not found to be useful in the characterization 
of carcinoma of the urinary bladder.

The Marfan syndrome and related disorders are systemic disorders of connective 
tissue. Proximal aorta is usually dilated. The molecular basis of Marfan 
syndrome has been elucidated, thus allowing prenatal diagnosis. Life expectancy 
has markedly improved due to the widespread use of beta-adrenergic receptor 
inhibitors and improved surgical management of the aortic disease.

Connecticut, USA.

In summary, the development of intervention criteria is a complex and 
challenging endeavor. Specific examination of this issue is crucial to the 
appropriate clinical care of patients. With these objectives in mind, we have 
drawn upon our clinical experience to design, by way of statistical analysis, 
reasoned size criteria for intervention. These intervention criteria must be 
carefully weighed against the patient's age, overall physical condition, and 
anticipated life expectancy. We have approached the development of criteria for 
intervention using statistical methodology from the standpoint of preventing 
complications (i.e., dissection and rupture). Symptomatic states, organ 
compression, concomitant aortic insufficiency, and acute ascending aortic 
dissection are well-accepted general indications for surgical intervention 
regardless of aortic size. The appendix incorporates the size criteria developed 
in the present study as an integral component within a comprehensive strategy 
for managing patients with TAA. This study confirms that aneurysms of the 
thoracic aorta are potentially lethal, that attentive follow-up is critical, and 
that adverse events can be anticipated based on size criteria. As we continue to 
expand our database, we hope to refine further statistically-based 
recommendations for surgical intervention. Multi-institutional patient 
enrollment, with the concomitant statistical power of larger patient numbers, 
would considerably strengthen this type of analysis.

Clinical experience with combination disease-modifying antirheumatic drug 
therapy with cyclosporine.

Centre, Melbourne, Australia.

OBJECTIVES: We previously reported on the clinical use of cyclosporine (Neoral), 
alone or in combination with methotrexate (MTX), in the first 46 refractory 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients treated at our centre between March 1996 and 
November 1997. Thirty of the 46 patients remained on cyclosporine at study 
completion (mean dose 2.98 mg/kg/day) with efficacy inferred by significant 
reductions in the prednisolone and MTX doses and creatinine maintained in an 
acceptable range. Early discontinuation was primarily related to non-serious 
side effects.
METHODS: The 30 patients continuing cyclosporine were reviewed 12 months later 
in November 1998. Analysis included life-table techniques.
RESULTS: 21 of the original 46 patients (46%) continued at a mean dose of 2.59 
mg/kg/day after a mean of 23.4 months. Nine patients discontinued cyclosporine 
during this 12-month period: 3 due to inactive disease, 2 due to hypertension, 2 
due to elevated creatinine, and 1 due to mononeuritis multiplex secondary to 
rheumatoid vasculitis, and 1 due to inefficacy. Patients continuing cyclosporine 
had a shorter disease duration (9.85 versus 15.5 years [P = 0.05]). The 
prednisolone dose decreased from a baseline value of 10.57 mg/day to 6.78 mg/day 
(P = 0.007) and the MTX dose from 15.6 mg/week to 13.1 mg/week (P = 0.02). The 
mean serum creatinine level increased from a baseline of 73.86 mumol/l to 85.8 
mumol/l (16%). 21/30 patients on combination therapy with MTX showed no 
difference in discontinuation rates compared with those on cyclosporine alone. 
Life-table analysis showed a bimodal distribution with significantly increased 
cyclosporine discontinuation in the first 12 months (principally due to 
non-renal/hypertensive causes) versus the subsequent period.
CONCLUSION: This follow-up study indicates that the use of cyclosporine in 
refractory RA allows a reduction in the prednisolone and MTX doses. Utilization 
is longer in earlier disease and is unaffected by combination with MTX. Renal 
function is maintained within an acceptable range. The bimodal discontinuation 
curve reflects early patient/physician concern about minor side effects, while 
renal/hypertension changes resulted in later discontinuation.

The purpose of this study is to define prognostic relationships between 
computer-derived nuclear morphological features, lymph node status, and tumor 
size in breast cancer. Computer-derived nuclear size, shape, and texture 
features were determined in fine-needle aspirates obtained at the time of 
diagnosis from 253 consecutive patients with invasive breast cancer. Tumor size 
and lymph node status were determined at the time of surgery. Median follow-up 
time was 61.5 months for patients without distant recurrence. In univariate 
analysis, tumor size, nuclear features, and the number of metastatic nodes were 
of decreasing significance for distant disease-free survival. Nuclear features, 
tumor size, and the number of metastatic nodes were of decreasing significance 
for overall survival. In multivariate analysis, the morphological size feature, 
largest perimeter, was more predictive of disease-free and overall survival than 
were either tumor size or the number of axillary lymph node metastases. This 
morphological feature, when combined with tumor size, identified more patients 
at both the good and poor ends of the prognostic spectrum than did the 
combination of tumor size and axillary lymph node status. Our data indicate that 
computer analysis of nuclear features has the potential to replace axillary 
lymph node status for staging of breast cancer. If confirmed by others, axillary 
dissection for breast cancer staging, estimating prognosis, and selecting 
patients for adjunctive therapy could be eliminated.

The International Prognostic Index can be used as a guide to treatment decisions 
regarding patients with human immunodeficiency virus-related systemic 
non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

BACKGROUND: The International Prognostic Index (IPI) effectively separates 
aggressive lymphomas into four groups with significantly different responses to 
therapy and survival. The authors have applied the IPI to evaluate a series of 
patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) related lymphoma, a disease for 
which treatment strategies are still controversial and prognostic indicators are 
therefore particularly important.
METHODS: Sixty-nine consecutive evaluable patients with HIV-related systemic 
non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) diagnosed at a single Institution during a 10-year 
period were analyzed. Primary cerebral lymphoma was not considered. Forty-nine 
patients (71%) received aggressive combination chemotherapy (CT), 45 of whom 
were treated with the same program: cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, etoposide, 
cytarabine, bleomycin, vincristine, and methotrexate with lecuovorin and 
prednisone (ProMACE-CytaBOM). Univariate and multivariate methods were used for 
statistical analysis. End points were response to treatment in patients 
receiving aggressive CT and survival of treated patients and all patients.
RESULTS: According to age-adjusted IPI, 5 patients (7%) belonged to the low risk 
group, 12 (17%) to the low-intermediate risk group, 16 (23%) to the 
high-intermediate risk group, and 36 (52%) to the high risk group. Among the 
four groups with increasing IPI scores, the mean CD4 cell count at NHL diagnosis 
was 313, 230, 151, and 72/microL, respectively (P = 0.0085). The complete 
response (CR) rates were 100%, 88%, 50%, and 32% (P = 0. 0001) and the median 
survival of all patients was >60, 17, 10.9, and 6.8 months (P = 0.0002) for 
patients with low, low-intermediate, high-intermediate, and high risk IPI 
scores, respectively. In multivariate analysis, among patients receiving 
aggressive CT, high risk IPI (P = 0.013) and systemic symptoms (P = 0.014) were 
the only parameters related to CR, and high risk IPI (P = 0.016) and achievement 
of CR (P < 0.001) were the only parameters related to survival. When all 
patients were considered, high risk IPI had significant prognostic value for 
overall survival (P = 0.01), as did age (P = 0.019) and achievement of CR (P < 
0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: IPI was a reliable prognostic indicator in an unselected series of 
patients with HIV-related systemic NHL. The outcomes of patients without high 
risk IPI treated with aggressive CT were similar to those expected for HIV 
negative patients with lymphoma. However more than half of patients with 
HIV-related NHL had IPI high risk disease, and their outcomes were poor even 
after aggressive CT. The degree of immunodeficiency was related to increasing 
IPI score, suggesting that immunodeficiency may be an important factor 
contributing to the aggressive clinical presentation of lymphoma.

CONTEXT: Mammography is recommended and is cost-effective for women aged 50 to 
69 years, but the value of continuing screening mammography after age 69 years 
is not known. In particular, older women with low bone mineral density (BMD) 
have a lower risk of breast cancer and may benefit less from continued 
screening.
OBJECTIVE: To compare life expectancy and cost-effectiveness of screening 
mammography in elderly women based on 3 screening strategies.
DESIGN: Decision analysis and cost-effectiveness analysis using a Markov model.
PATIENTS: General population of women aged 65 years or older.
INTERVENTIONS: The analysis compared 3 strategies: (1) Undergoing biennial 
mammography from age 65 to 69 years; (2) undergoing biennial mammography from 
age 65 to 69 years, measurement of distal radial BMD at age 65 years, 
discontinuing screening at age 69 years in women in the lowest BMD quartile for 
age, and continuing biennial mammography to age 79 years in those in the top 3 
quartiles of distal radius BMD; and (3) undergoing biennial mammography from age 
65 to 79 years.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Deaths due to breast cancer averted, life expectancy, and 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratios.
RESULTS: Compared with discontinuing mammography screening at age 69 years, 
measuring BMD at age 65 years in 10000 women and continuing mammography to age 
79 years only in women with BMD in the top 3 quartiles would prevent 9.4 deaths 
and add, on average, 2.1 days to life expectancy at an incremental cost of 
$66773 per year of life saved. Continuing mammography to age 79 years in all 
10000 elderly women would prevent 1.4 additional breast cancer deaths and add 
only 7.2 hours to life expectancy at an incremental cost of $117689 per year of 
life saved compared with only continuing mammography to age 79 years in women 
with BMD in the top 3 quartiles.
CONCLUSIONS: This analysis suggests that continuing mammography screening after 
age 69 years results in a small gain in life expectancy and is moderately 
cost-effective in those with high BMD and more costly in those with low BMD. 
Women's preferences for a small gain in life expectancy and the potential harms 
of screening mammography should play an important role when elderly women are 
deciding about screening.

CONTEXT: Three major coronary risk factors-serum cholesterol level, blood 
pressure, and smoking-increase incidence of coronary heart disease (CHD) and 
related end points. In previous investigations, risks for low-risk reference 
groups were estimated statistically because samples contained too few such 
people to measure risk.
OBJECTIVE: To measure long-term mortality rates for individuals with favorable 
levels for all 3 major risk factors, compared with others.
DESIGN: Two prospective studies, involving 5 cohorts based on age and sex, that 
enrolled persons with a range of risk factors. Low risk was defined as serum 
cholesterol level less than 5.17 mmol/L (<200 mg/dL), blood pressure less than 
orequal to 120/80 mm Hg, and no current cigarette smoking. All persons with a 
history of diabetes, myocardial infarction (MI), or, in 3 of 5 cohorts, 
electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities, were excluded.
SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: In 18 US cities, a total of 72144 men aged 35 through 
39 years and 270671 men aged 40 through 57 years screened (1973-1975) for the 
Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial (MRFIT); in Chicago, a total of 10025 
men aged 18 through 39 years, 7490 men aged 40 through 59 years, and 6229 women 
aged 40 through 59 years screened (1967-1973) for the Chicago Heart Association 
Detection Project in Industry (CHA) (N = 366559).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cause-specific mortality during 16 (MRFIT) and 22 (CHA) 
years, relative risks (RRs) of death, and estimated greater life expectancy, 
comparing low-risk subcohorts vs others by age strata.
RESULTS: Low-risk persons comprised only 4.8% to 9.9% of the cohorts. All 5 
low-risk groups experienced significantly and markedly lower CHD and 
cardiovascular disease death rates than those who had elevated cholesterol 
level, or blood pressure, or smoked. For example, age-adjusted RRs of CHD 
mortality ranged from 0.08 for CHA men aged 18 to 39 years to 0.23 for CHA men 
aged 40 through 59 years. The age-adjusted relative risks (RRs) for all 
cardiovascular disease mortality ranged from 0.15 for MRFIT men aged 35 through 
39 years to 0.28 for CHA men aged 40 through 59 years. The age-adjusted RR for 
all-cause mortality rate ranged from 0.42 for CHA men aged 40 through 59 years 
to 0.60 for CHA women aged 40 through 59 years. Estimated greater life 
expectancy for low-risk groups ranged from 5.8 years for CHA women aged 40 
through 59 years to 9.5 years for CHA men aged 18 through 39 years.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on these very large cohort studies, for individuals with 
favorable levels of cholesterol and blood pressure who do not smoke and do not 
have diabetes, MI, or ECG abnormalities, long-term mortality is much lower and 
longevity is much greater. A substantial increase in the proportion of the 
population at lifetime low risk could contribute decisively to ending the CHD 
epidemic.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost utility of interferon beta-1b in secondary 
progressive multiple sclerosis.
DESIGN: Population based cost utility model (healthcare perspective). Data on 
use of health services were obtained from case records and routine morbidity 
data and utility values from a EuroQol survey. Local and published costs were 
used. Effectiveness was modelled using data on relative risk reductions from a 
randomised trial of interferon beta-1b.
SETTING: Tayside region, 1993-5.
SUBJECTS: 132 ambulatory people with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained. Rate 
of relapse and proportion becoming wheelchair dependent over three years.
RESULTS: The number needed to treat for 30 months to delay time to wheelchair 
dependence in one person by nine months was 18 (95% confidence interval 5 to 
26). For every 18 people treated for 30 months, six relapses would be prevented, 
gaining 0.397 discounted QALYs. The cost per QALY gained was 1 024 667 pounds 
sterling (276 466 pounds sterling to 485 499 pound sterling). If treatment was 
restricted to patients attending neurology services, the number needed to treat 
was 14 (cost per QALY gained 833 pounds sterling 514 (161 358 pounds sterling to 
infinity)). The cost per QALY gained was not sensitive to changes in cost which 
took account of a societal perspective.
CONCLUSIONS: The cost per QALY gained from interferon beta is high because of 
the high drug cost and modest clinical effect. Resources could be used more 
efficiently elsewhere.
