noted that the route of administration, the choice of molecules, the respect of 
the intervention window and the dosage seem to modulate the potential vascular 
effects.

The vertebroplasty is based on intracorporeal acrylic resin injection. Its 2 
main objectives are analgesia and bone consolidation. Its main indications are 
painful and inflammatory fractures on a site of osteopathic fragility and bone 
metastases. Its clinical efficacy is strongly correlated with a treatment 
performed within 3 months post fracture. Transpedicular acrylic resin injection 
is performed under scopic control in order to continuously follow the 
intra-corporeal filling of the cement and thus limit the risk of complications. 
Main risks of vertebroplasty are rare and represented by the risk of 
extracorporeal leak, disc, foraminal, in the epidural space, the periventricular 
and epidural veins or the inferior vena cava or the lung about acrylic resin 
injection. For the spinal tumoral pathology, each file is the subject of a 
multidisciplinary discussion where essential elements to the global care of the 
patients are necessary to collect and to take into account, in particular the 
general state of the patient and its life expectancy and the goal of treatment 
(curative or palliative). The main techniques of hot ablathermy are represented 
by laser, radio frequency or microwaves and cold ablathermy by cryoablation. 
Different guidance techniques (fluoroscopy, CT, MRI, etc.) are available to 
interventional radiologists to perform their actions in conditions of maximum 
safety and efficiency. It is necessary to put in place a passive protection 
(thermocouple or electrostimulation) or active protection (displacement of the 
organs, insufflation of CO2, hydro-dissection, cooling or warming) of the 
neighboring organs, in particular of the nerves.

BACKGROUND: Gastric cancer (GC) is the third leading cause of cancer death. 
Early detection is a key factor to reduce its mortality.
METHODS: We retrospectively collected pre- and postoperative serum samples as 
well as tumour tissues and adjacent normal tissues from 100 GC patients. Serum 
samples from non-cancerous patients were served as controls (n = 50). A 
high-throughput protein detection technology, multiplex proximity extension 
assays (PEA), was applied to measure levels of over 300 proteins. Alteration of 
each protein was analysed by univariate analysis. Elastic-net logistic 
regression was performed to select serum proteins into the diagnostic model.
FINDINGS: We identified 19 serum proteins (CEACAM5, CA9, MSLN, CCL20, SCF, 
TGF-alpha, MMP-1, MMP-10, IGF-1, CDCP1, PPIA, DDAH-1, HMOX-1, FLI1, IL-7, 
ZBTB-17, APBB1IP, KAZALD-1, and ADAMTS-15) that together distinguish GC cases 
from controls with a diagnostic sensitivity of 93%, specificity of 100%, and 
area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0·99 (95% CI: 
0·98-1). Moreover, the 19-serum protein signature provided an increased 
diagnostic capacity in patients at TNM I-II stage (sensitivity 89%, specificity 
100%, AUC 0·99) and in patients with high microsatellite instability (MSI) (91%, 
98%, and 0·99) compared to individual proteins. These promising results will 
inspire a large-scale independent cohort study to be pursued for validating the 
proposed protein signature.
INTERPRETATION: Based on targeted proteomics and elastic-net logistic 
regression, we identified a 19-serum protein signature which could contribute to 
clinical GC diagnosis, especially for patients at early stage and those with 
high MSI. FUND: This study was supported by a European H2020-Marie 
Skłodowska-Curie Innovative Training Networks grant (316,929, 
GastricGlycoExplorer). Funder had no influence on trial design, data evaluation, 
and interpretation.

Indolent systemic mastocytosis (ISM) patients have a normal life expectancy, 
except in the 5% to 10% of cases that progress to more advanced SM (advSM), 
which has a significantly poorer outcome. Mutations in genes other than KIT 
frequently found in myeloid neoplasms have been associated with a poorer outcome 
among advSM, whereas limited information exists about their frequency and 
prognostic impact in ISM. We investigated the frequency and prognostic impact of 
variants in 18 genes, found to be altered in advSM, in 322 ISM patients (median 
follow-up, 5.7 years) divided into discovery (n = 200) and validation (n = 122) 
cohorts. Overall, 71 genetic variants were detected in 55 of 322 (17%) patients. 
Mutated ISM cases, particularly those carrying ASXL1, RUNX1, and/or DNMT3A 
(A/R/D) pathogenic variant allele frequencies (VAFs) ≥ 30%, exhibited 
significantly shortened (P < .001) progression-free survival (PFS) and overall 
survival (OS). Multivariate analysis showed that serum β2-microglobulin (sβ2M) 
levels > 2.5 µg/mL (hazard ratio [HR], 9.8; P = .001), together with a KIT D816V 
VAF ≥ 1% in bone marrow (BM) (HR, 10.1; P = .02) and pathogenic variants of 
A/R/D VAFs ≥ 30% (HR, 4.2; P = .02), were the best combination of independent 
predictors for PFS. In turn, A/R/D gene pathogenic VAF ≥ 30% was the only 
independent predictor for OS (HR, 51.8; P < .001). Based on these variables, 2 
scoring systems were constructed for risk stratification of ISM at diagnosis 
with significantly different 10-year PFS (100%, 91%, 0% for scores of 0, 1, ≥2, 
respectively) and OS (100% and 50% for scores of 0 and 1) rates.

The Gram-negative bacterium Erwinia amylovora causes fire blight disease of 
apples and pears. While the virulence systems of E. amylovora have been studied 
extensively, relatively little is known about its parasitic behavior. The aim of 
this study was to identify primary metabolites that must be synthesized by this 
pathogen for full virulence. A series of auxotrophic E. amylovora mutants, 
representing 21 metabolic pathways, were isolated and characterized for 
metabolic defects and virulence in apple immature fruits and shoots. On detached 
apple fruitlets, mutants defective in arginine, guanine, hexosamine, 
isoleucine/valine, leucine, lysine, proline, purine, pyrimidine, sorbitol, 
threonine, tryptophan, and glucose metabolism had reduced virulence compared to 
the wild type, while mutants defective in asparagine, cysteine, glutamic acid, 
histidine, and serine biosynthesis were as virulent as the wild type. 
Auxotrophic mutant growth in apple fruitlet medium had a modest positive 
correlation with virulence in apple fruitlet tissues. Apple tree shoot 
inoculations with a representative subset of auxotrophs confirmed the apple 
fruitlet results. Compared to the wild type, auxotrophs defective in virulence 
caused an attenuated hypersensitive immune response in tobacco, with the 
exception of an arginine auxotroph. Metabolomic footprint analyses revealed that 
auxotrophic mutants which grew poorly in fruitlet medium nevertheless depleted 
environmental resources. Pretreatment of apple flowers with an arginine 
auxotroph inhibited the growth of the wild-type E. amylovora, while heat-killed 
auxotroph cells did not exhibit this effect, suggesting nutritional competition 
with the virulent strain on flowers. The results of our study suggest that 
certain nonpathogenic E. amylovora auxotrophs could have utility as fire blight 
biocontrol agents.IMPORTANCE This study has revealed the availability of a range 
of host metabolites to E. amylovora cells growing in apple tissues and has 
examined whether these metabolites are available in sufficient quantities to 
render bacterial de novo synthesis of these metabolites partially or even 
completely dispensable for disease development. The metabolomics analysis 
revealed that auxotrophic E. amylovora mutants have substantial impact on their 
environment in culture, including those that fail to grow appreciably. The 
reduced growth of virulent E. amylovora on flowers treated with an arginine 
auxotroph is consistent with the mutant competing for limiting resources in the 
flower environment. This information could be useful for novel fire blight 
management tool development, including the application of nonpathogenic E. 
amylovora auxotrophs to host flowers as an environmentally friendly biocontrol 
method. Fire blight management options are currently limited mainly to 
antibiotic sprays onto open blossoms and pruning of infected branches, so novel 
management options would be attractive to growers.

The surgical management of severe truncal valvular dysfunction is still 
challenging in neonates with persistent truncus arteriosus. This report 
describes a 14-day-old neonate with severe truncal valve insufficiency 
successfully undergoing truncal valve repairs, and followed by valve replacement 
at the age of 4 years. The truncal valve was quadricuspid with two large and two 
small leaflets, and all leaflets had severe dysplastic and myxomatous changes. 
We performed leaflet extension and bicuspidization valvuloplasty for this valve. 
This patient obtained somatic growth for 4 years without heart failure symptoms, 
and safely underwent prosthetic valve replacement. This technique would be 
effective for truncal valve dysfunction in neonates as the life-saving and the 
bridging procedure to valve replacement.

Antithrombotic treatment and perioperative management in patients with 
hemophilia remains a challenge. As life expectancy in these patients is 
increasing, a concern about cardiovascular diseases is emerging. Herein we 
present the case of a 68 year-old patient with mild hemophilia B and multivessel 
coronary disease who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery. 
Off-pump surgery with continuous infusion FIX treatment was performed 
successfully with stable factor IX levels, and no bleeding or thrombotic 
complications. There is a paucity of cases reported regarding management of CABG 
in this population. To our knowledge, this is the first patient with mild 
hemophilia B that underwent CABG surgery with off-pump technique, that seems to 
be a secure and effective procedure.

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the main cause of morbidity and mortality in 
Western society and present an important age-related risk. With the constant 
rise in life expectancy, prevalence of CVD in the population will likely 
increase further. New therapies, especially in the elderly, are needed to combat 
CVD. This review is focused on the role of long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) in CVD. 
RNA sequencing experiments in the past decade showed that most RNA does not code 
for protein, but many RNAs function as ncRNA. Here, we summarize the recent 
findings of lncRNA regulation in the diseased heart. The potential use of these 
RNAs as biomarkers of cardiac disease prediction is also discussed.

Fat is historically associated with poor health and obesity. However, the 
continuous use of lipidomics and genetic studies in model organisms revealed 
that specific lipid profiles and signals might delay aging. In order to identify 
and quantify the lipid species, researchers are taking advantage of the recent 
developments in the area of lipidomics that is mainly done by mass spectrometry 
and further techniques, such as NMR spectroscopy and chromatographic 
separations. This review will emphasize the role of lipid composition and 
metabolism during aging. We review the molecular and physiological changes 
during the progression of aging with a special focus on the role of lipids. 
Interventions to modulate life span in a variety of organisms such caloric 
restriction, show a significant extension of their maximum life-span and a 
decrease in the onset of age-related diseases. In particular, the influence of 
dietary restriction in lipid metabolism will be a major point of this review.

At the dawn of the third millennium, cancer has become the bane of twenty-first 
century man, and remains a predominant public health burden, affecting welfare 
and life expectancy globally. Spinal osteogenic sarcoma, a primary spinal 
malignant tumor, is a rare and challenging neoplastic disease to treat. After 
the conventional therapeutic modalities of chemotherapy, radiation and surgery 
have been exhausted, there is currently no available alternative therapy in 
managing cases of spinal osteosarcoma. The defining signatures of tumor survival 
are characterised by cancer cell ability to stonewall immunogenic attrition and 
apoptosis by various means. Some of these biomarkers, namely immune-checkpoints, 
have recently been exploited as druggable targets in osteosarcoma and many other 
different cancers. These promising strides made by the use of reinvigorated 
immunotherapeutic approaches may lead to significant reduction in spinal 
osteosarcoma disease burden and corresponding reciprocity in increase of 
survival rates. In this review, we provide the background to spinal 
osteosarcoma, and proceed to elaborate on contribution of the complex ecology 
within tumor microenvironment giving arise to cancerous immune escape, which is 
currently receiving considerable attention. We follow this section on the tumor 
microenvironment by a brief history of cancer immunity. Also, we draw on the 
current knowledge of treatment gained from incidences of osteosarcoma at other 
locations of the skeleton (long bones of the extremities in close proximity to 
the metaphyseal growth plates) to make a case for application of immunity-based 
tools, such as immune-checkpoint inhibitors and vaccines, and draw attention to 
adverse upshots of immune-checkpoint blockers as well. Finally, we describe the 
novel biotechnique of CRISPR/Cas9 that will assist in treatment approaches for 
personalized medication.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend annual influenza 
vaccination of persons ≥6 months old. However, in 2016-17, only 43.3% of U.S. 
adults reported receiving an influenza vaccination. Limited awareness about the 
cost-effectiveness (CE) or the economic value of influenza vaccination may 
contribute to low vaccination coverage. In 2017, we conducted a literature 
review to survey estimates of the CE of influenza vaccination of adults compared 
to no vaccination. We also summarized CE estimates of other common preventive 
interventions that are recommended for adults by the U.S. Preventive Services 
Task Force. Results are presented as costs in US$2015 per quality-adjusted 
life-year (QALY) saved. Among adults aged 18-64, the CE of influenza vaccination 
ranged from $8000 to $39,000 per QALY. Assessments for adults aged ≥65 yielded 
lower CE ratios, ranging from being cost-saving to $15,300 per QALY. Influenza 
vaccination was cost-saving to $85,000 per QALY for pregnant women in moderate 
or severe influenza seasons and $260,000 per QALY in low-incidence seasons. For 
other preventive interventions, CE estimates ranged from cost-saving to $170,000 
per QALY saved for breast cancer screening among women aged 50-74, from 
cost-saving to $16,000 per QALY for colorectal cancer screening, and from 
$27,000 to $600,000 per QALY for hypertension screening and treatment. Influenza 
vaccination in adults appears to have a similar CE profile as other commonly 
utilized preventive services for adults. Efforts to improve adult vaccination 
should be considered by adult-patient providers, healthcare systems and payers 
given the health and economic benefits of influenza vaccination.

BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Patients with cancer are eligible for hospice care when 
their life expectancy is 180 days or shorter. This study investigated the 
prognostic factors of patients with cancer and sepsis who were admitted to an 
intensive care unit (ICU) to assist with clinical decisions of hospice care.
METHODS: A series of 279 patients admitted to the medical ICU with cancer and 
sepsis were included. Another series of 109 patients with cancer and sepsis 
admitted to the other medical ICU in the different branch of our hospital was 
included to verify the results.
RESULTS: Among 279 patients, the 30-, 90-, and 180-day mortality rates were 
47.3%, 72.0%, and 81.0%, respectively. APACHE II score and the cancer control 
status (controlled or remission (CR), active newly diagnosed (AND) and active 
recurrent or progressive (ARP)) were significant predictors of 30- and 90-day 
mortality(30-day: AND(odds ratio: 5.66; 95% confidence interval: 2.12-15.15), 
ARP(6.24; 2.92-13.33), APACHE II( 1.07; 1.03-1.11); 90-day: AND(4.78; 
1.91-11.99), ARP( 24.03; 11.11-51.99), APACHE II( 1.07; 1.02-1.19)) and were 
associated with a poor 180-day outcome. The 180-day mortality were significantly 
different among the patients with different cancer control status in the series 
of 279 patients (CR: 29.8%; AND: 69.4%; and ARP: 98.9 %) and that of 109 
patients (46.4%; 96.8%; and 94.0%).
CONCLUSION: APACHE II score and the cancer control status may be the prognostic 
factors for critically ill patients with cancer and sepsis, and they may be 
helpful for evaluating hospice care.

PURPOSE: Coffee is widely consumed and implicated in numerous health outcomes 
but the mechanisms by which coffee contributes to health is unclear. The purpose 
of this study was to test the effect of coffee drinking on candidate proteins 
involved in cardiovascular, immuno-oncological and neurological pathways.
METHODS: We examined fasting serum samples collected from a previously reported 
single blinded, three-stage clinical trial. Forty-seven habitual coffee 
consumers refrained from drinking coffee for 1 month, consumed 4 cups of 
coffee/day in the second month and 8 cups/day in the third month. Samples 
collected after each coffee stage were analyzed using three multiplex proximity 
extension assays that, after quality control, measured a total of 247 proteins 
implicated in cardiovascular, immuno-oncological and neurological pathways and 
of which 59 were previously linked to coffee exposure. Repeated measures ANOVA 
was used to test the relationship between coffee treatment and each protein.
RESULTS: Two neurology-related proteins including carboxypeptidase M (CPM) and 
neutral ceramidase (N-CDase or ASAH2), significantly increased after coffee 
intake (P < 0.05 and Q < 0.05). An additional 46 proteins were nominally 
associated with coffee intake (P < 0.05 and Q > 0.05); 9, 8 and 29 of these 
proteins related to cardiovascular, immuno-oncological and neurological 
pathways, respectively, and the levels of 41 increased with coffee intake.
CONCLUSIONS: CPM and N-CDase levels increased in response to coffee intake. 
These proteins have not previously been linked to coffee and are thus novel 
markers of coffee response worthy of further study. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRY:

The peanut red spider mite, Tetranychus ogmophallos Ferreira and Flechtmann 
(Acari: Tetranychidae), is an important pest of peanut in Brazil and is 
considered a quarantine pest in other countries. This study investigates the 
development, reproduction, survival and life table parameters of T. ogmophallos 
on five peanut cultivars-three with high levels of oleic acid [high oleic] and 
recently released: Granoleico, IAC OL 3 and IAC 503; and two regular and 
previously used by farmers: Runner IAC 886, IAC Tatu ST 3-and two breeding lines 
(L. 8008 and L. 322) in the growth chamber. There were differences between the 
developmental times of all immature stages, the oviposition period, fecundity 
and adult longevity of T. ogmophallos reared on the peanut cultivars and 
breeding lines. The longest duration of the immature stage and lowest fecundity 
occurred on cultivars Granoleico and Runner IAC 886, and breeding line L. 322, 
which also displayed the lowest intrinsic rate of increase (r), finite rate of 
increase (λ) and net reproductive rate (R0) and the shortest mean generation 
time (T). The highest fitness occurred on the IAC Tatu ST, IAC OL 3, IAC 503 and 
L. 8008. Our study shows that peanut cultivars belonging to the group with high 
oleic trait and recently released (IAC OL 3 and IAC 503) are susceptible to T. 
ogmophallos, except Granoleico, which is resistant. The regular and previously 
used cultivar Runner IAC 886 and breeding line L. 322 are resistant to the 
peanut red spider mite.

PURPOSE: Excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) is the core complaint of central 
nervous system (CNS) hypersomnias. In this mini-review, we summarized EDS 
features in CNS hypersomnias to provide a guide for differential diagnosis 
purposes.
METHODS: A review of recent literature was performed to provide an update in CNS 
hypersomnias.
RESULTS: At clinical evaluation, narcolepsy patients report a good restorative 
potential of sleep together with the frequent occurrence of dreaming even during 
short-lasting naps. These features are mirrored by the neurophysiological 
evidence of REM sleep at sleep onset (SOREMP) during the Multiple Sleep Latency 
Test (MSLT), a specific marker. Conversely, patients with idiopathic hypersomnia 
(IH) complain sleep inertia and prolonged nocturnal sleep. Polysomnographic 
studies show high sleep propensity on the MSLT or high 24-h total sleep time 
during continuous monitoring. Patients with insufficient sleep syndrome (ISS) 
can present with variable clinical EDS features in between narcolepsy and IH. 
ISS diagnosis is based on the clinical evidence of nocturnal sleep curtailment 
(weekdays versus vacations) associated with the disappearance of EDS complaint 
after sleep extension. Polysomnographic data are not required, but when the MSLT 
is performed, ISS patients can present with SOREMP arising from non-REM stage 2 
sleep (vs narcolepsy patients entering into SOREM most frequently from 
wakefulness). Kleine-Levin Syndrome is characterized by recurrent episodes of 
enormously prolonged sleep time lasting days associated with abnormal cognition 
and behavior intermixed by asymptomatic periods, a sleep pattern that can be 
well documented by actigraphy.
CONCLUSIONS: Different CNS hypersomnias present with specific features of EDS 
are useful to guide the clinician to apply and interpret appropriate 
neurophysiological investigations.

The risk of medical comorbidity in mental disorders with a particular focus on 
depressive syndromes Objectives: It has long been recognized that certain mental 
disorders, and in particular depressive syndromes, are associated with increased 
medical comorbidity. However, reliable data on the prevalence of comorbid 
medical diagnoses as well as the impact of these comorbidities on mortality are 
often rare and sometimes conflicting. Methods: A systematic literature review 
was conducted using PubMed and Google Scholar to provide a critical account of 
the current state of research on the comorbidities of medical and mental 
disorders, with a particular focus on depressive syndromes. Results: Among 
patients with mental disorders, all-cause mortality is about doubled as compared 
to the general population causing a significantly shortened life expectancy in 
the range of one to two decades. This excess mortality is primarily due to 
increased physical morbidity and mortality, and it cannot be excluded that, for 
patients with severe mental disorders, excess mortality has been increased over 
time. Depressive syndromes are often linked to a broad range of somatic symptoms 
and can be found in diseases, such as heart disease, stroke, diabetes mellitus, 
overweight/obesity, and asthma. Conclusion: Current studies provide ample 
evidence of close interactions between physical and mental health. Further 
developments in the field of psychosomatic medicine should take into 
consideration the health-related consequences of these interactions.

Publisher: Zusammenfassung Fragestellung: Es ist seit langem bekannt, dass 
bestimmte psychische Störungen und insbesondere Depressionen mit einer erhöhten 
somatischen Komorbidität einhergehen. Verlässliche Daten zur Prävalenz von 
komorbiden somatischen Diagnosen bei Patienten mit psychischen Erkrankungen und 
deren Auswirkungen auf die Mortalität sind jedoch selten und manchmal 
widersprüchlich. Methode: Eine systematische Literaturrecherche wurde in PubMed 
und Google Scholar durchgeführt, um den aktuellen Stand der Forschung zur 
Komorbidität von somatischen Symptomen bei depressiven Störungen kritisch zu 
erfassen. Ergebnisse: Für Menschen mit psychischen Erkrankungen ist das globale 
Sterblichkeitsrisiko gegenüber der Allgemeinbevölkerung auf etwa das Doppelte 
erhöht und die Lebenserwartung um ein bis zwei Dekaden signifikant verkürzt. 
Diese Übersterblichkeit beruht in erster Linie auf einer erhöhten somatischen 
Morbidität und Mortalität. Es kann nicht ausgeschlossen werden, dass für 
Patienten mit schweren psychischen Erkrankungen die Übersterblichkeit noch 
zugenommen hat. Depressive Syndrome sind oftmals mit einer Vielzahl von 
somatischen Symptomen verbunden und können bei Erkrankungen vorkommen wie 
Herzerkrankungen, apoplektischem Insult, Diabetes mellitus, 
Übergewicht/Adipositas und Asthma bronchiale. Diskussion: Die gegenwärtigen 
Studien belegen die engen Zusammenhänge zwischen körperlicher und seelischer 
Gesundheit. Bei Weiterentwicklungen auf dem Gebiet der Psychosomatischen Medizin 
sollten die gesundheitsbezogenen Konsequenzen dieser Zusammenhänge verstärkt 
berücksichtigt werden.

Comment in
    J Arthroplasty. 2019 Dec;34(12):3135.

BACKGROUND: Life expectancy and higher complication rates have made the routine 
use of total knee arthroplasty (TKA) in elderly patients disputed by some 
authors. The purpose of this study was to assess patient and implant 
survivorship, complication and revision rates, and patient-reported outcomes 
(PROMS) in a cohort of patients aged above 80 years undergoing TKA. A comparison 
with a propensity matched cohort of patients of average age within our database 
for TKA was performed.
METHODS: A retrospective review of prospectively collected data identified 644 
patients over the age of 80 years undergoing a TKA within a 14-year period. 
After calculating the average age of all TKA patients within the reviewed 
database, a cohort deemed average age was created within 1 standard deviation of 
the average age and matched using the following criteria: gender, surgeon, 
diagnosis, procedure type, and year. The primary outcomes were survivorship of 
the implant and the patient. The secondary outcomes were complications, 
transfusion rates, discharge destination, and PROMS.
RESULTS: The revision rate was low for both groups (P = .051). Implant 
survivorship at 10 years was similar (P = .07). Mortality rate was higher in the 
elderly (P < .001). General complication rate was higher in the elderly (P = 
.031). Surgical complications rates were similar (P = .702). The PROMS at final 
follow-up were 4% lower in the elderly (P < .001).
CONCLUSION: TKA in the elderly is a safe procedure. With measures minimizing the 
perioperative complications and blood loss, the outcome can be expected to be 
similar to patients of average age. The projected implant and patient 
survivorship in the elderly cohort is long enough to suggest that TKA in the 
elderly could have a high impact on remaining quality of life. Level III 
retrospective study.

OBJECTIVES: We examined the number of years to be lived with and without 
cognitive impairment and with high self-assessed quality of life (i.e., 
happiness) among a nationally representative sample of Americans aged 65 years 
and older. Two key questions are addressed: Can people have a high quality of 
life despite being cognitively impaired? Which is longer: happy life expectancy 
or cognitively intact life expectancy?
METHOD: Data from nine waves of the Health and Retirement Study (1998-2014) were 
used to estimate transition probabilities into and out of cognitively 
intact/impaired-un/happy states, as well as to death. Recently extended Bayesian 
multistate life table methods were used to estimate age-specific cognitively 
intact and happy life expectancy net of sex, race/ethnicity, education, and 
birth cohort.
RESULTS: Happiness and cognitive impairment were shown to coexist in both the 
gross cross-tabulated data and in the life tables. Happy life expectancy is 
approximately 25% longer than cognitively intact life expectancy at age 65 
years, and by age 85, happy life expectancy is roughly double cognitively intact 
life expectancy, on average.
DISCUSSION: Lack of cognitive impairment is not a necessary condition for 
happiness. In other words, people can have a high quality of life despite being 
cognitively impaired.

BACKGROUND: People with cerebral palsy (CP) experience increased muscle 
stiffness, muscle weakness, and reduced joint range of motion. This can lead to 
an abnormal pattern of gait, which can increase the energy cost of walking and 
contribute to reduced participation in physical activity.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to examine associations between lower-body 
joint angles, moments, power, and walking efficiency in adolescents with CP.
DESIGN: This was a cross-sectional study.
METHODS: Sixty-four adolescents aged 10 to 19 years with CP were recruited. 
Walking efficiency was measured as the net nondimensional oxygen cost (NNcost) 
during 6 minutes of overground walking at self-selected speed. Lower-body 
kinematics and kinetics during walking were collected with 3-dimensional motion 
analysis, synchronized with a treadmill with integrated force plates. The 
associations between the kinematics, kinetics, and NNcost were examined with 
multivariable linear regression.
RESULTS: After adjusting for age, sex, and Gross Motor Function Classification 
System level, maximum knee extension angle (β = -0.006), hip angle at midstance 
(β = -0.007), and maximum hip extension (β = -0.008) were associated with 
NNcost. Age was a significant modifier of the association between the NNcost and 
a number of kinematic variables.
LIMITATIONS: This study examined kinetic and kinematic variables in the sagittal 
plane only. A high interindividual variation in gait pattern could have 
influenced the results.
CONCLUSIONS: Reduced knee and hip joint extension are associated with gait 
inefficiency in adolescents with CP. Age is a significant factor influencing 
associations between ankle, knee, and hip joint kinematics and gait efficiency. 
Therapeutic interventions should investigate ways to increase knee and hip joint 
extension in adolescents with CP.

For some patients with kidney failure, particularly those who have limited life 
expectancy or severe comorbidities, the "standard" dialysis treatment regimen 
may be perceived as excessively burdensome and may not align well with the 
patient's own priorities. For such patients, a palliative approach to the 
provision of dialysis-whereby treatment is tailored to the needs of the 
individual so as to optimize quality of life and minimize disease-related 
symptoms, but limit treatment burden-might offer a way to better align the 
delivery of care with the life goals of the patient. Here, we discuss the 
fundamental principles of palliative dialysis: the patients who might most 
benefit from this approach, treatment strategies and considerations for 
implementation, as well as potential barriers to its provision.

Single domain antibodies that combine antigen specificity with high tissue 
penetration are an attractive alternative to conventional antibodies. However, 
rapid clearance from the bloodstream owing to their small size can be a 
limitation of therapeutic single domain antibodies. Here, we describe and 
evaluate the conjugation of a single domain i-body, AD-114, which targets CXCR4, 
to a panel of half-life extension technologies including a human serum 
albumin-binding peptide, linear and branched PEG, and PASylation (PA600). The 
conjugates were assessed in murine, rat and cynomolgus monkey pharmacokinetic 
studies and showed that the branched PEG was most effective at extending 
circulating half-life in mice; however, manufacturing limitations of PEGylated 
test material precluded scale-up and assessment in larger animals. PA600, by 
comparison, was amenable to scale-up and afforded considerable half-life 
improvements in mice, rats and cynomolgus monkeys. In mice, the circulating 
half-life of AD-114 was extended from 0.18 h to 7.77 h following conjugation to 
PA600, and in cynomolgus monkeys, the circulating half-life of AD-114-PA600 was 
24.27 h. AD-114-PA600 was well tolerated in cynomolgus monkeys at dose rates up 
to 100 mg/kg with no mortalities or drug-related clinical signs.
