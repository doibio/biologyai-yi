INTRODUCTION: Several studies have measured health outcomes in the United 
States, but none have provided a comprehensive assessment of patterns of health 
by state.
OBJECTIVE: To use the results of the Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD) to 
report trends in the burden of diseases, injuries, and risk factors at the state 
level from 1990 to 2016.
DESIGN AND SETTING: A systematic analysis of published studies and available 
data sources estimates the burden of disease by age, sex, geography, and year.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Prevalence, incidence, mortality, life expectancy, 
healthy life expectancy (HALE), years of life lost (YLLs) due to premature 
mortality, years lived with disability (YLDs), and disability-adjusted 
life-years (DALYs) for 333 causes and 84 risk factors with 95% uncertainty 
intervals (UIs) were computed.
RESULTS: Between 1990 and 2016, overall death rates in the United States 
declined from 745.2 (95% UI, 740.6 to 749.8) per 100 000 persons to 578.0 (95% 
UI, 569.4 to 587.1) per 100 000 persons. The probability of death among adults 
aged 20 to 55 years declined in 31 states and Washington, DC from 1990 to 2016. 
In 2016, Hawaii had the highest life expectancy at birth (81.3 years) and 
Mississippi had the lowest (74.7 years), a 6.6-year difference. Minnesota had 
the highest HALE at birth (70.3 years), and West Virginia had the lowest (63.8 
years), a 6.5-year difference. The leading causes of DALYs in the United States 
for 1990 and 2016 were ischemic heart disease and lung cancer, while the third 
leading cause in 1990 was low back pain, and the third leading cause in 2016 was 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Opioid use disorders moved from the 11th 
leading cause of DALYs in 1990 to the 7th leading cause in 2016, representing a 
74.5% (95% UI, 42.8% to 93.9%) change. In 2016, each of the following 6 risks 
individually accounted for more than 5% of risk-attributable DALYs: tobacco 
consumption, high body mass index (BMI), poor diet, alcohol and drug use, high 
fasting plasma glucose, and high blood pressure. Across all US states, the top 
risk factors in terms of attributable DALYs were due to 1 of the 3 following 
causes: tobacco consumption (32 states), high BMI (10 states), or alcohol and 
drug use (8 states).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: There are wide differences in the burden of disease 
at the state level. Specific diseases and risk factors, such as drug use 
disorders, high BMI, poor diet, high fasting plasma glucose level, and alcohol 
use disorders are increasing and warrant increased attention. These data can be 
used to inform national health priorities for research, clinical care, and 
policy.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune connective tissue disorder 
that can involve any organ system. Central nervous system involvement can be a 
severe life threatening complication, ultimately resulting in severe 
neurodegenerative changes. Magnetic resonance imaging suggests that 
neurodegeneration, which may have deleterious effects on brain function, may 
occur early in SLE and experimental models suggest that neuroprotection may be 
feasible and beneficial. The retina is an extension of the brain. Recent 
ophthalmic imaging technologies are capable of identifying early changes in 
retinal and choroidal morphology and circulation that may reflect CNS 
degeneration. However, their utility in monitoring CNS involvement in SLE has 
been poorly studied as these have only been performed in small cohorts, in a 
cross-sectional design, non-quantitatively and without correlation to disease 
activity. The authors aim to review the current understanding of 
neurodegeneration associated with SLE, with particular focus on the visual 
pathway. We describe the neuropathology of the visual system in SLE and the 
evidence for retinal and choroidal neurodegenerative and microvascular changes 
using optical coherence tomography technology. We aim to describe the potential 
role of optical imaging modalities in NPSLE diagnosis and their likely impact on 
the study of neuronal function.

countries.

Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.

Netherlands.

BACKGROUND: Gender differences in life expectancy (LE) have been traditionally 
large in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE), and alcohol has been hypothesized to 
be one of its main determinants. We examined the role of alcohol in gender 
differences in LE in Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia, Moldova, Poland, Romania, 
Russia and Ukraine, and changes in this role from 1965 until 2012.
METHODS: We decomposed the gender differences in LE at birth into alcohol- and 
non-alcohol-related mortality. We examined causes of death wholly attributable 
to alcohol over the whole period, and estimated from 1990 onwards additional 
alcohol-attributable mortality by using alcohol-attributable fractions from the 
Global Burden of Disease study.
RESULTS: In the eight CEE countries, women's advantage in LE relative to men 
increased from 7.3 years on average in 1965 to 10.0 years on average in 2012. 
All alcohol-attributable mortality contributed 1.9 years on average (uncertainty 
intervals (UI): 1.2-2.5; 18.8%) to the gender differences from 1990 to 2012. Its 
relative contribution increased in most countries until around 2005, and 
declined thereafter, resulting in a contribution of at least 15% in 2012. The 
absolute contribution of alcohol to the LE gender gap was strongly correlated 
with the overall LE gender differences (Pearson's r > 0.75), except in Poland 
and Estonia.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite recent declines, the contribution of sex differences in 
excessive alcohol consumption to the LE gender gap is substantial, and should 
not be neglected. Tackling gender differences in alcohol consumption and 
alcohol-attributable mortality would contribute to further progress in reducing 
mortality.

AIMS: To investigate the long-term cost-utility of the artificial urinary 
sphincter (AUS) compared with Transobturator Retroluminal Sling (AdVance) in the 
treatment of patients with severe post prostatectomy stress urinary incontinence 
(PPSUI) from a Canadian provincial health perspective.
METHODS: A Markov model with Monte Carlo simulation was developed with a cycle 
length of 1 year and time horizon up to 10 years to estimate the incremental 
cost per quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Patients were assigned to 
treatment with either AUS or an AdVance sling. Transition probabilities, 
efficacy data, and utility indices were derived from published literature and 
expert opinion. Cost data were obtained from provincial health care system and 
hospital data in 2016-Canadian dollars. The primary outcome was cost per 
quality-adjusted life year. A standard discount rate of 1.5% was applied 
annually. Probabilistic and one way deterministic sensitivity analyses were 
performed.
RESULTS: AUS implantation had a 10-year mean total cost of $14 228 (SD ± 3,509) 
for 7.58 QALYs. AdVance sling had a mean total cost $18 938 (SD ± 12,435) for 
6.43 QALYs. The incremental cost savings of AUS over 10-years was -$ 4710 with 
an added effectiveness of 1.15 QALYs. At a willingness to pay threshold of 
$50 000, AUS remained the most cost-effective option. A limitation of our 
analysis is the lack of direct long-term comparisons between both scenarios 
along with standard success definition.
CONCLUSIONS: AUS implantation appears to be more economical treatment strategy 
for severe PPSUI compared with AdVance sling for a publicly funded health care 
system over a 5- and 10-year time horizon.

Background Mortality from cardiovascular diseases is particularly high in Russia 
compared with the European average. The National Priority Project 'Health', 
launched in 2005, aimed to promote prevention of non-communicable diseases, 
particularly cardiovascular diseases, in primary care and to increase 
availability of state-of-art cardiovascular disease management. Methods This is 
a multiregional population based study with analysis of indicators for 
cardiovascular health and coronary heart disease in Moscow, St Petersburg, the 
Moscow region and across Russia, including a total population of 143.7 million 
inhabitants between 2005 and 2013. Data were collected using conventional 
methodology and originate from open statistical sources. Results The overall 
age-standardized coronary heart disease mortality decreased in 2005-2013 by 
24.7% from 383.6 to 289.0 per 100000 population, but with substantial 
interregional differences: it declined from 306.1 to 196.9 per 100,000 in Moscow 
(-35.7%), from 362.1 to 258.9 per 100,000 in St Petersburg (-28.5%) and from 
433.8 to 374.3 per 100,000 in the Moscow region (-13.7%). Income in Moscow 
exceeded the national average 2-3-fold, and Moscow had the highest availability 
of modern treatments and interventions. Although vegetables, fruits and fish 
consumption increased overall in Russia, this trend was most prominent in 
Moscow. Indicators for psychosocial well-being also were best in Moscow. Life 
expectancy in Moscow is almost six years higher than the Russian average. 
Conclusion Health policy interventions turned out to be successful but with 
substantial interregional differences. Lower coronary heart disease mortality 
and higher life expectancy in Moscow may be due to a more favourable 
socioeconomic and psychological environment, more healthy eating and greater 
availability of medical care.

BACKGROUND: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short, non-coding RNAs that regulate gene 
expression at the post-transcriptional level and play a key role in the control 
of innate and adaptive immune responses. For a subclinical infection such as 
bovine streptococcal mastitis, early detection is a great challenge, and miRNA 
profiling could potentially assist in the diagnosis and contribute to the 
understanding of the pathogenicity and defense mechanisms. We have examined the 
miRNA repertoire and the transcript level of six key immune genes [tumor 
necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6), 
interleukin-8 (IL-8), interleukin-10 (IL-10) and transforming growth factor beta 
1 (TGFβ1)] during the early phase response of bovine immature macrophages to in 
vitro infection with live Streptococcus agalactiae. Next generation sequencing 
of small RNA libraries from 20 cultures of blood monocyte-derived macrophages 
exposed to either one of two sequence types of S. agalactiae (ST103 or ST12) for 
6 h in vitro and unchallenged controls was performed.
RESULTS: Analyzes of over 356 million high quality sequence reads, revealed 
differential expression of 17 and 44 miRNAs (P < 0.05) in macrophages infected 
with ST103 and ST12, respectively, versus unchallenged control cultures. We also 
identified the expression of 31 potentially novel bovine miRNAs. Pathway 
analysis of the differentially regulated miRNAs and their predicted target genes 
in the macrophages infected with ST12 revealed significant enrichment for 
inflammatory response and apoptosis, while significant enrichment for integrin 
and GABA signaling were found in ST103 infected macrophages. Furthermore, both 
bacterial strains regulated miRNAs involved in the alternative activation of 
macrophages. The transcript levels of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-10 were 
significantly up-regulated by both bacterial strains, however the expression of 
TGFβ1 was significantly down-regulated only by ST12.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study identified pathogen-induced differential regulation of 
miRNAs controlling inflammation and polarization in bovine macrophages. This 
implies that miRNAs have potential to serve as biomarkers for early detection of 
bacterial infection.

BACKGROUND: During the last decades, dignity has been an emerging issue in 
mental health since its ethical and therapeutic implications became known. This 
study is an extension of the preliminary validation of the Patient Dignity 
Inventory (PDI) in a psychiatric setting, originally designed for assessing 
perceived dignity in terminal cancer patients.
METHODS: From October 21, 2015 to December 31, 2016, we administered the Italian 
PDI to all patients hospitalized in an acute psychiatric ward, who provided 
their consent and completed it at discharge (n=165). We performed Cronbach's 
alpha coefficient and principal factor analysis. We administered other scales 
concomitantly to analyze the concurrent validity of PDI. We applied stepwise 
multiple linear regression to identify the patients' demographic and clinical 
variables related to the PDI score.
RESULTS: Our response rate was 93%, with excellent internal consistency 
(Cronbach's alpha coefficient=0.94). The factorial analysis showed three factors 
with eigenvalue >1, which explained >80% of total variance: 1) "loss of 
self-identity and anxiety for the future", 2) "concerns for social dignity and 
spiritual life", and 3) "loss of personal autonomy". The PDI and the three 
factor scores were positively and significantly correlated with the Hamilton 
Scales for Depression and Anxiety but not with other scale scores. Among 
patients' variables, "suicide risk" and "insufficient social and economic 
condition" were positively and significantly correlated with the PDI total 
score.
CONCLUSION: The PDI can be a reliable tool to assess patients' dignity 
perception in a psychiatric setting, which suggests that both social and 
clinical severe conditions are closely related to dignity loss.

BACKGROUND: Monosomy of the X chromosome is the most frequent genetic 
abnormality in human as it is present in approximately 2% of all conceptions, 
although 99% of these embryos are spontaneously miscarried. In postnatal life, 
clinical features of Turner syndrome may include typical dysmorphic stigmata, 
short stature, sexual infantilism, and renal, cardiac, skeletal, endocrine and 
metabolic abnormalities.
MAIN TEXT: Turner syndrome is due to a partial or total loss of the second 
sexual chromosome, resulting in the development of highly variable clinical 
features. This phenotype may not merely be due to genomic imbalance from deleted 
genes but may also result from additive influences on associated genes within a 
given gene network, with an altered regulation of gene expression triggered by 
the absence of the second sex chromosome. Current studies in human and mouse 
models have demonstrated that this chromosomal abnormality leads to epigenetic 
changes, including differential DNA methylation in specific groups of downstream 
target genes in pathways associated with several clinical and metabolic 
features, mostly on autosomal chromosomes. In this article, we begin exploring 
the potential involvement of both genetic and epigenetic factors in the origin 
of X chromosome monosomy. We review the dispute between the meiotic and 
post-zygotic origins of 45,X monosomy, by mainly analyzing the findings from 
several studies that compare gene expression of the 45,X monosomy to their 
euploid and/or 47,XXX trisomic cell counterparts on peripheral blood mononuclear 
cells, amniotic fluid, human fibroblast cells, and induced pluripotent human 
cell lines. From these studies, a profile of epigenetic changes seems to emerge 
in response to chromosomal imbalance. An interesting finding of all these 
studies is that methylation-based and expression-based pathway analyses are 
complementary, rather than overlapping, and are correlated with the clinical 
picture displayed by TS subjects.
CONCLUSIONS: The clarification of these possible causal pathways may have future 
implications in increasing the life expectancy of these patients and may provide 
informative targets for early pharmaceutical intervention.

OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of an externally applied 
electroceutical (EAE) device, Accel-Heal, in treating non-healing venous leg 
ulcers (VLUs) in the UK.
METHOD: This was a prospective, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
multi-centre study of patients aged ≥18 years with a non-healing VLU. Patients 
were randomised in the ratio of 1:1 to receive six units of the EAE (consisting 
of a self-contained, programmed electric microcurrent generator and two skin 
contact pads) or an identical-looking placebo device over 12 consecutive days. 
Patients were followed-up for 24 weeks from randomisation, during which time 
patients received wound care according to the local standard care pathway, 
completed health-related quality of life (HRQoL) instruments, and health-care 
resource use was measured. The cost-effectiveness of the EAE device was 
estimated at 2015/16 prices in those patients who fulfilled the study's 
inclusion and exclusion criteria (economic analysis population).
RESULTS: At 24 weeks after randomisation, 34% and 30% of VLUs in the EAE and 
placebo groups in the economic analysis population, respectively, had healed. 
The time-to-healing was a mean of 2.6 and 3.5 months in the EAE and placebo 
groups, respectively. The area of the wounds that healed in the EAE group was 
nearly twice that of those in the placebo group (mean: 13.3 versus 7.7cm2 per 
VLU). Additionally, the pre-randomised duration of the wounds that healed in the 
EAE group was double that of those in the placebo group (mean: 2.6 versus 1.2 
years per VLU). By the end of the study, EAE-treated patients reported less 
pain, more social functioning and greater overall wellbeing/satisfaction than 
placebo-treated patients. None of these differences reached statistical 
significance, but they may be important to patients. There were no significant 
differences in health-care resource use between the two groups. The incremental 
cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained with the EAE device was £4480 
at eight weeks, decreasing to £2265 at 16 weeks and -£2388 (dominant) at 24 
weeks. The study was confounded by unwarranted variation in patient management 
between centres and between individual clinicians within each centre.
CONCLUSION: Despite the unwarranted variation in the provision of wound care 
observed in this study, the use of the EAE device resulted in some improved 
clinical outcomes and patient-reported outcomes, for the same or less cost as 
standard care, by 24 weeks. Clinicians managing VLUs may wish to consider the 
findings from this study when making treatment decisions.

OBJECTIVE: To analyze how individual characteristics and the social context, 
together, are associated with self-perception of the oral health.
METHODS: A multilevel cross-sectional study with data from the Brazilian 
National Health Survey 2013, the United Nations Development Program, and the 
National Registry of Health Establishments. The explanatory variables for the 
"oral health perception" outcome were grouped, according to the study framework, 
into biological characteristics (sex, color, age), proximal social determinants 
(literacy, household crowding, and socioeconomic stratification), and distal 
(years of schooling expectancy at age 18, GINI, Human Development Index, and per 
capita income). The described analysis was performed, along with bivariate 
Poisson analysis and multilevel Poisson analysis for the construction of the 
explanatory model of oral health perception. All analyzes considered the sample 
weights.
RESULTS: Both the biological characteristics and the proximal and distal social 
determinants were associated with the perception of oral health in the bivariate 
analysis. A higher prevalence of bad oral health was associated to lower years 
of schooling expectancy (PR = 1.31), lower per capita income (PR = 1.45), higher 
income concentration (PR = 1.41), and worse human development (PR = 1.45). 
Inversely, oral health services in both primary and secondary care were 
negatively associated with oral health perception. All the biological and 
individual social characteristics, except reading and writing, made up the final 
explanatory model along with the distal social determinants of the Human 
Development Index and coverage of basic care in the multilevel analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: Biological factors, individual and contextual social determinants 
were associate synergistically with the population's perception of oral health. 
It is necessary to improve individual living conditions and the implementation 
of public social policies to improve the oral health of the population.

Pública, Salvador, BA, Brazil.

OBJECTIVE: Considering the importance of screening for prostate cancer, the 
possibility of damage resulting from indiscriminate screening and the difficulty 
of disclosure and adherence to the main guidelines on the subject, we aimed to 
identify current guidelines, look for common approaches and establish a core of 
conducts.
METHOD: Systematic review of the literature on screening practice guidelines for 
prostate cancer searching the databases PubMed, Lilacs and Google Scholar and 
active search in the sites of several national health entities.
RESULTS: Twelve (12) guidelines were selected, whose analysis resulted in the 
identification of six common points of conduct, with the following minimum core 
of recommendations: (1) screening indication or not: must be individualized, and 
preceded by an informed decision; (2) tests used: PSA with or without rectal 
digital examination; (3) age at which initiate testing in men in general risk: 
50-55 years; (4) age at which to initiate testing in men at increased risk: 
40-45 years; (5) the interval between screening: annual or biennial; and (6) age 
at which to discontinue testing: 70 years-old or life expectancy less than 10 
years.
CONCLUSION: Although there are differences between them, it was possible to 
establish a minimum core of conducts that may be useful in the daily practice of 
the physician.

IMPORTANCE: Palliative care considerations are typically introduced late in the 
disease trajectory of patients with advanced heart failure (HF), and access to 
specialty-level palliative care may be limited.
OBJECTIVE: To determine if early initiation of goals of care conversations by a 
palliative care-trained social worker would improve prognostic understanding, 
elicit advanced care preferences, and influence care plans for high-risk 
patients discharged after HF hospitalization.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This prospective, randomized clinical trial 
of a social worker-led palliative care intervention vs usual care analyzed 
patients recently hospitalized for management of acute HF who had risk factors 
for poor prognosis. Analyses were conducted by intention to treat.
INTERVENTIONS: Key components of the social worker-led intervention included a 
structured evaluation of prognostic understanding, end-of-life preferences, 
symptom burden, and quality of life with routine review by a palliative care 
physician; communication of this information to treating clinicians; and 
longitudinal follow-up in the ambulatory setting.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Percentage of patients with physician-level 
documentation of advanced care preferences and the degree of alignment between 
patient and cardiologist expectations of prognosis at 6 months.
RESULTS: The study population (N = 50) had a mean (SD) age of 72 (11) years and 
had a mean (SD) left ventricular ejection fraction of 0.33 (13). Of 50 patients, 
41 (82%) had been hospitalized more than once for HF management within 12 months 
of enrollment. At enrollment, treating physicians anticipated death within a 
year for 32 patients (64%), but 42 patients (84%) predicted their life 
expectancy to be longer than 5 years. At 6 months, more patients in the 
intervention group than in the control group had physician-level documentation 
of advanced care preferences in the electronic health record (17 [65%] vs 8 
[33%]; χ2 = 5.1; P = .02). Surviving patients allocated to intervention were 
also more likely to revise their baseline prognostic assessment in a direction 
consistent with the physician's assessment (15 [94%] vs 4 [26%]; χ2 = 14.7; 
P < .001). Among the 31 survivors at 6 months, there was no measured difference 
between groups in depression, anxiety, or quality-of-life scores.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Patients at high risk for mortality from HF 
frequently overestimate their life expectancy. Without an adverse impact on 
quality of life, prognostic understanding and patient-physician communication 
regarding goals of care may be enhanced by a focused, social worker-led 
palliative care intervention that begins in the hospital and continues in the 
outpatient setting.

IMPORTANCE: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in the 
United States, but regional variation within the United States is large. 
Comparable and consistent state-level measures of total CVD burden and risk 
factors have not been produced previously.
OBJECTIVE: To quantify and describe levels and trends of lost health due to CVD 
within the United States from 1990 to 2016 as well as risk factors driving these 
changes.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Using the Global Burden of Disease 
methodology, cardiovascular disease mortality, nonfatal health outcomes, and 
associated risk factors were analyzed by age group, sex, and year from 1990 to 
2016 for all residents in the United States using standardized approaches for 
data processing and statistical modeling. Burden of disease was estimated for 10 
groupings of CVD, and comparative risk analysis was performed. Data were 
analyzed from August 2016 to July 2017.
EXPOSURES: Residing in the United States.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Cardiovascular disease disability-adjusted 
life-years (DALYs).
RESULTS: Between 1990 and 2016, age-standardized CVD DALYs for all states 
decreased. Several states had large rises in their relative rank ordering for 
total CVD DALYs among states, including Arkansas, Oklahoma, Alabama, Kentucky, 
Missouri, Indiana, Kansas, Alaska, and Iowa. The rate of decline varied widely 
across states, and CVD burden increased for a small number of states in the most 
recent years. Cardiovascular disease DALYs remained twice as large among men 
compared with women. Ischemic heart disease was the leading cause of CVD DALYs 
in all states, but the second most common varied by state. Trends were driven by 
12 groups of risk factors, with the largest attributable CVD burden due to 
dietary risk exposures followed by high systolic blood pressure, high body mass 
index, high total cholesterol level, high fasting plasma glucose level, tobacco 
smoking, and low levels of physical activity. Increases in risk-deleted CVD DALY 
rates between 2006 and 2016 in 16 states suggest additional unmeasured risks 
beyond these traditional factors.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Large disparities in total burden of CVD persist 
between US states despite marked improvements in CVD burden. Differences in CVD 
burden are largely attributable to modifiable risk exposures.

Life-History Variation Predicts the Effects of Demographic Stochasticity on 
Avian Population Dynamics.

Sæther BE, Engen S, Pape Møller A, Weimerskirch H, Visser ME, Fiedler W, 
Matthysen E.

Comparative analyses of avian population fluctuations have shown large 
interspecific differences in population variability that have been difficult to 
relate to variation in general ecological characteristics. Here we show that 
interspecific variation in demographic stochasticity, caused by random variation 
among individuals in their fitness contributions, can be predicted from a 
knowledge of the species' position along a "slow-fast" gradient of life-history 
variation, ranging from high reproductive species with short life expectancy at 
one end to species that often produce a single offspring but survive well at the 
other end of the continuum. The demographic stochasticity decreased with adult 
survival rate, age at maturity, and generation time or the position of the 
species toward the slow end of the slow-fast life-history gradient. This 
relationship between life-history characteristics and demographic stochasticity 
was related to interspecific differences in the variation among females in 
recruitment as well as to differences in the individual variation in survival. 
Because reproductive decisions in birds are often subject to strong natural 
selection, our results provide strong evidence for adaptive modifications of 
reproductive investment through life-history evolution of the influence of 
stochastic variation on avian population dynamics.
