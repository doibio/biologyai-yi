As human life expectancy increases, the incidence of neurodegenerative diseases 
in older adults has increased in parallel. Walnuts contain bioactive peptides 
with demonstrated neuroprotective effects, making them a valuable addition to 
the diet. We here present a comprehensive review of the various methods used to 
prepare, isolate, purify, and identify the neuroprotective peptides found in 
walnuts. We further summarise the different approaches currently used to 
evaluate the activity of these peptides in experimental settings, highlighting 
their potential to reduce oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and promote 
autophagy, as well as to regulate the gut microflora and balance the cholinergic 
system. Finally, we offer suggestions for future research concerning 
bioavailability and improving or masking the bitter taste and sensory properties 
of final products containing the identified walnut neuroprotective peptides to 
ensure successful adoption of these peptides as functional food ingredients for 
neurohealth promotion.

Although radiolabeled alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone-analogue NAPamide 
derivatives are valuable melanoma-specific diagnostic probes, their rapid 
elimination kinetics and high renal uptake may preclude them from being used in 
clinical settings. We aimed at improving the pharmacokinetics of radiolabeled 
DOTA-NAPamide compounds by incorporating a 4-(p-iodo-phenyl)-butanoic acid (IPB) 
into the molecules. Followed by 68Ga-, 205/206Bi-, and 177Lu-labelling, the 
radiopharmaceuticals ([68Ga]Ga-DOTA-IPB-NAPamide, 
[205/206Bi]Bi-DOTA-IPB-NAPamide, [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-IPB-NAPamide) were characterized 
in vitro. To test the imaging behavior of the IPB-containing probes, B16F10 
tumor-bearing C57BL/6 mice were subjected to in vivo microPET/microSPECT/CT 
imaging and ex vivo biodistribution studies. All tracers were stable in vitro, 
with radiochemical purity exceeding 98%. The use of albumin-binding moiety 
lengthened the in vivo biological half-life of the IPB-carrying 
radiopharmaceuticals, resulting in elevated tumor accumulation. Both 
[68Ga]Ga-DOTA-IPB-NAPamide (5.06 ± 1.08 %ID/g) and 
[205/206Bi]Bi-DOTA-IPB-NAPamide (4.50 ± 0.98 %ID/g) exhibited higher B16F10 
tumor concentrations than their matches without the albumin-binding residue 
([68Ga]Ga-DOTA-NAPamide and [205/206Bi]Bi-DOTA-NAPamide: 1.18 ± 0.27 %ID/g and 
3.14 ± 0.32; respectively), however; the large amounts of off-target 
radioactivity do not confirm the benefits of half-life extension for short-lived 
isotopes. Enhanced [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-IPB-NAPamide tumor uptake even 24 h 
post-injection proved the advantage of IPB-based prolonged circulation time 
regarding long-lived radionuclides, although the significant background noise 
must be addressed in this case as well.

Hormonal replacement therapy is the mainstay treatment to improve quality of 
life and reduce mortality. With the increasing number of young women with early 
menopause, women now live longer (increased life expectancy). However, poor 
patient compliance with oral estrogen therapy has emerged. Intravaginal estrogen 
therapy can provide significant benefits with minimal risk for postmenopausal 
women with symptoms of the lower urinary tract and vaginal area but who do not 
want to take oral estrogen. In this study, estradiol-loaded solid lipid 
nanoparticles (SLPs) were prepared from compritol ATO 888 and precirol ATO 5, 
and two different stabilizers (Pluronic F127 and Tween 80) were studied. 
Selected SLPs (F3 and F6) were coated with different concentrations of the 
mucoadhesive and sustained-release polymer chitosan. Furthermore, gelation time, 
viscosity, mucoadhesion, ex vivo permeation, and in vitro irritation for vaginal 
irritation were studied. Particle sizes ranged between 450-850 nm, and EE% 
recorded 50-83% for the six SLPs depending on the type and amount of lipids 
used. Cumulative % drug release was significantly enhanced and was recorded at 
51% to 83%, compared to that (less than 20%) for the control suspension of 
estradiol. Furthermore, extensive thermal gelation and mucoadhesion were 
recorded for chitosan-coated SLPs. Up to 2.2-fold increases in the permeation 
parameters for SLPs gels compared to the control suspension gel were recorded, 
revealing a slight to moderate irritation on Hela cell lines. These findings 
demonstrated chitosan-coated estradiol SLPs as novel and promising vaginal 
mucoadhesive hybrid nanogels.

The increased prevalence of pulmonary methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus 
aureus (MRSA) infection in patients living with cystic fibrosis (CF) is 
concerning due to a correlation with reduced life expectancy and lack of 
available treatment options. RV94 is a next generation lipoglycopeptide designed 
for pulmonary delivery that preclinically demonstrated high potency against MRSA 
in planktonic and protected colonies and improved pulmonary clearance relative 
to same class molecules. Here, RV94 was formulated into a dry powder for 
inhalation (DPI) to investigate the localized treatment of pulmonary MRSA 
presented in a potentially more convenient dosage form. RV94 DPI was generated 
using a spray-drying process with 12.5 wt% trileucine and demonstrated aerosol 
characteristics (2.0 μm MMAD and 73% FPF) predictive of efficient pulmonary 
deposition. In vivo PK from a single dose of RV94 DPI delivered by inhalation to 
rats yielded lung levels (127 μg/g) much greater than the MRSA minimum 
inhibitory concentration (0.063 μg/mL), low systemic levels (0.1 μg/mL), and a 
lung t1/2 equal to 3.5 days. In a rat acute pulmonary MRSA model, a single dose 
of RV94 DPI delivered by inhalation either up to seven days prior to or 24 h 
after infection resulted in a statistically significant reduction in lung MRSA 
titer.

Numerous factors can impact the efficiency of callus formation and in vitro 
regeneration in wheat cultures through the introduction of exogenous polyamines 
(PAs). The present study aimed to investigate in vitro plant regeneration and 
DNA methylation patterns utilizing the inter-primer binding site (iPBS) 
retrotransposon and coupled restriction enzyme digestion-iPBS (CRED-iPBS) 
methods in wheat. This investigation involved the application of distinct types 
of PAs (Put: putrescine, Spd: spermidine, and Spm: spermine) at varying 
concentrations (0, 0.5, 1, and 1.5 mM). The subsequent outcomes were subjected 
to predictive modeling using diverse machine learning (ML) algorithms. Based on 
the specific polyamine type and concentration utilized, the results indicated 
that 1 mM Put and Spd were the most favorable PAs for supporting 
endosperm-associated mature embryos. Employing an epigenetic approach, Put at 
concentrations of 0.5 and 1.5 mM exhibited the highest levels of genomic 
template stability (GTS) (73.9%). Elevated Spd levels correlated with DNA 
hypermethylation while reduced Spm levels were linked to DNA hypomethylation. 
The in vitro and epigenetic characteristics were predicted using ML techniques 
such as the support vector machine (SVM), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), 
and random forest (RF) models. These models were employed to establish 
relationships between input variables (PAs, concentration, GTS rates, Msp I 
polymorphism, and Hpa II polymorphism) and output parameters (in vitro 
measurements). This comparative analysis aimed to evaluate the performance of 
the models and interpret the generated data. The outcomes demonstrated that the 
XGBoost method exhibited the highest performance scores for callus induction 
(CI%), regeneration efficiency (RE), and the number of plantlets (NP), with R2 
scores explaining 38.3%, 73.8%, and 85.3% of the variances, respectively. 
Additionally, the RF algorithm explained 41.5% of the total variance and 
showcased superior efficacy in terms of embryogenic callus induction (ECI%). 
Furthermore, the SVM model, which provided the most robust statistics for 
responding embryogenic calluses (RECs%), yielded an R2 value of 84.1%, 
signifying its ability to account for a substantial portion of the total 
variance present in the data. In summary, this study exemplifies the application 
of diverse ML models to the cultivation of mature wheat embryos in the presence 
of various exogenous PAs and concentrations. Additionally, it explores the 
impact of polymorphic variations in the CRED-iPBS profile and DNA methylation on 
epigenetic changes, thereby contributing to a comprehensive understanding of 
these regulatory mechanisms.

People living with HIV (PLWH) remain at high risk of mortality and morbidity 
from vaccine-preventable diseases, even though antiretroviral therapy (ART) has 
restored life expectancy and general well-being. When, which, and how many doses 
of vaccine should be administered over the lifetime of PLWH are questions that 
have become clinically relevant. Immune responses to most vaccines are known to 
be impaired in PLWH. Effective control of viremia with ART and restored CD4+ 
T-cell count are correlated with an improvement in responsiveness to routine 
vaccines. However, the presence of immune alterations, comorbidities and 
co-infections may alter it. In this article, we provide a comprehensive review 
of the literature on immune responses to different vaccines in the setting of 
HIV infection, emphasizing the potential effect of HIV-related factors and 
presence of comorbidities in modulating such responses. A better understanding 
of these issues will help guide vaccination and prevention strategies for PLWH.

OBJECTIVE: This paper examines the impact of healthcare industry convergence on 
the performance of the public health system in the eastern, central, and western 
regions of China.
METHODS: Public health performance was measured by a composite index of three 
standards: average life expectancy at birth, perinatal mortality, and maternal 
mortality. The healthcare industry convergence was measured using a coupling 
coordination degree method. The spatial lag, spatial error, and spatial Durbin 
models were used to estimate the effect of healthcare industry convergence on 
public health system performance and this effect's spatial dependence and 
heterogeneity across eastern, central, and western China using panel data from 
30 Chinese provinces from 2002 to 2019.
RESULTS: The convergence of the healthcare industry significantly promotes 
regional public health [β =0.576, 95% CI: (0.331,0.821)]. However, the 
convergence does not have a spatial spillover effect on the public health system 
at the national level. Additionally, analysis of regional heterogeneity shows 
that the direct effects of healthcare industry convergence on public health are 
positive and statistically significant for Eastern China, statistically 
insignificant for Central China, and positive and statistically significant for 
Western China. The indirect effects are negative, statistically significant, 
positive, statistically significant, and statistically insignificant for these 
three regions, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Policy efforts should strengthen the convergence between the 
healthcare industry and relevant industries. It can produce more current 
healthcare services to improve public health and reduce regional health 
inequality.

BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Previous studies have shown a trend that elite athletes 
tend to live longer than the general population, which has been attributed to 
the "healthy worker hire effect" and the health benefits of exercise. There have 
not been any previous studies looking at survival of elite cricketers with the 
general population as a reference cohort. This study aimed to compare the annual 
mortality rates of current and retired elite male Australian cricket players to 
that of the age-matched general Australian male population.
METHODS: Analysis of publicly accessible dates of birth, death, and cricket 
debut data for male Australian Sheffield Shield cricket players who played 
before 2022 and had not died before 1971. Included persons were Sheffield Shield 
players who lived primarily in Australia during and after their cricket careers. 
Death rates from 1971 to 2021 (inclusive) were compared to the general 
Australian male population.
RESULTS: 1824 Sheffield Shield players had not died prior to 1971 (798 had 
played before the 1971 season, 1026 debuting subsequently). There were 586 
deaths in the 51 years of observations, compared to 825 expected deaths, giving 
a Standardized Mortality Ratio of 0.71 (95% CI 0.63-0.80).
CONCLUSION: Elite Australian male Sheffield Shield cricket players outlive the 
general male population with lower death rates. This is probably due to a 
combination of the healthy worker hire effect and the health benefits of 
exercise. This study provides evidence that in terms of longevity, it is safe to 
play elite-level cricket in Australia.

Background: Drug repurposing is an alternative strategy to traditional drug 
discovery that aims at predicting new uses for already existing drugs or 
clinical candidates. Drug repurposing has many advantages over traditional drug 
development, such as reduced attrition rates, time and costs. This is especially 
the case considering that most drugs investigated for repurposing have already 
been assessed for their safety in clinical trials. Repurposing campaigns can 
also be designed for libraries of already synthesized molecules at different 
levels of biological experimentation, from null to in vitro and in vivo. Such an 
extension of the "repurposing" concept is expected to provide significant 
advantages for the identification of novel drugs, as the synthetic accessibility 
of the desired compounds is often one of the limiting factors in the traditional 
drug discovery pipeline. Methods: In this work, we performed a computational 
repurposing campaign on a library of previously synthesized oxindole-based 
compounds, in order to identify potential new targets for this versatile 
scaffold. To this aim, ligand-based approaches were firstly applied to evaluate 
the similarity degree of the investigated compound library, with respect to 
ligands extracted from the DrugBank, Protein Data Bank (PDB) and ChEMBL 
databases. In particular, the 2D fingerprint-based and 3D shape-based similarity 
profiles were evaluated and compared for the oxindole derivates. Results: The 
analyses predicted a set of potential candidate targets for repurposing, some of 
them emerging by consensus of different computational analyses. One of the 
identified targets, i.e., the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 
(VEGFR-2) kinase, was further investigated by means of docking calculations, 
followed by biological testing of one candidate. Conclusions: While the compound 
did not show potent inhibitory activity towards VEGFR-2, the study highlighted 
several other possibilities of therapeutically relevant targets that may be 
worth of consideration for drug repurposing.

Improvements in treatment have made HIV a manageable chronic condition, leading 
to increased life expectancy and a growing share of people with HIV who are 
older. Older people with HIV have higher rates of many chronic conditions, yet 
little is known about differences in health care utilization and spending. This 
study compared health care utilization and spending for Medicare beneficiaries 
with and without HIV, accounting for differential mortality. The data included 
demographic characteristics and claims-based information. Estimated cumulative 
spending for beneficiaries with HIV aged 67 to 77 years was 26% higher for 
Medicare Part A and 39% higher for Medicare Part B compared with beneficiaries 
without HIV; most of these differences would be larger if not for greater 
mortality risk among people with HIV (and therefore fewer years to receive 
care). Future research should disentangle underlying causes for this increased 
need and describe potential responses by policymakers and health care providers.

OBJECTIVE: This study seeks to clarify the hope of cancer patients undergoing 
drug therapy and related factors through a systematic review.
METHODS: References were searched and selected in accordance with Preferred 
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses.
RESULTS: Thirteen articles were selected. A meta-analysis found that the overall 
Herth Hope Index score for cancer patients undergoing drug therapy averaged 
35.64 points. The hope of cancer patients was associated with anxiety/depression 
and quality of life (QOL). It was also associated with personal attributes such 
as age, family structure, economic situation, educational level, social support, 
internal factors such as coping, self-esteem, optimism, self-confidence, locus 
of control, etc., as well as disease/treatment-related factors such as the 
purpose of treatment, general condition, presence or absence of metastasis, 
symptoms, survival period, and estimated life expectancy.
CONCLUSION: Anxiety/depression, QOL, and other factors were found to be related 
to cancer patients' hope. In the future, studies that clarify the overall 
structure of various factors related to hope and longitudinal studies will be 
necessary.

Patients with serious mental illness are reported to have a 10-25 year reduction 
in life expectancy. Medical mistrust may influence their willingness to seek 
care (Bynum, S. A., Davis, J. L., Green, B. L., & Katz, R. V. (2012). 
Unwillingness to participate in colorectal cancer screening: Examining fears, 
attitudes, and medical mistrust in an ethnically diverse sample of adults 50 
years and older. American Journal of Health Promotion : Ajhp, 26(5), 295-300. 
https://doi.org/10.4278/ajhp.110113-QUAN-20 ). This cross-sectional study used 
baseline data from a SAMHSA funded demonstration project to describe the 
prevalence and of medical mistrust among a sample of African American adults 
with serious mental illness. Medical mistrust was identified using the Medical 
Mistrust Scale. One hundred and fifty-four participants completed the medical 
mistrust scale. Approximately, a third (34.4%) reported medical mistrust. After 
adjusting for financial stability, those endorsing medical mistrust reported 
nearly 3 times the odds of lacking support (AOR [95% CI]: 2.84 [1.01-7.97]) 
compared to those not endorsing medical mistrust. The study is among the first 
to describe elevated rates of medical mistrust among a sample of African 
Americans people with serious mental illness. An association between medical 
mistrust and lack of social support was demonstrated.

We present a comparative study of the methods used in the search for 
extraterrestrial microorganism life, including a summary table where different 
life-detection techniques can be easily compared as an aid to mission and 
instrument design aimed at life detection. This is an extension of previous 
study, where detection techniques for a series of target characteristics and 
molecules that could constitute a positive life detection were evaluated. This 
comparison has been extended with a particular consideration to sources of false 
positives, the causes of negative detection, the results of detection techniques 
when presented regarding terrestrial life, and additional science objectives 
that could be achieved outside the primary aim of detecting life. These 
additions address both the scientific and programmatic side of exploration 
mission design, where a successful proposal must demonstrate probable outcomes 
and be able to return valuable results even if no life is found. The 
applicability of the life detection techniques is considered for Earth life, 
Earth-independent life (life emerging independently from that on Earth,) and 
Earth-kin life (sharing a common ancestor with life on Earth), and techniques 
effective in detecting Earth life should also be useful in the detection of 
Earth-kin life. However, their applicability is not guaranteed for 
Earth-independent life. As found in our previous study, there exists no 
realistic single detection method that can conclusively determine the discovery 
of extraterrestrial life, and no method is superior to all others. In this 
study, we further consider combinations of detection techniques and identify 
imaging as a valuable addition to molecule detection methods, even in cases 
where there is insufficient resolution to observe the detailed morphology of a 
microbial cell. The search for extraterrestrial life is further divided into a 
survey-and-detection and analysis-and-conclusion step. These steps benefit from 
different detection techniques, but imaging is necessary for both parts.

Many insects are dependent on microbial mutualists, which are often harbored in 
specialized symbiotic organs. Upon metamorphosis, insect organs are drastically 
reorganized. What mechanism regulates the remodeling of the symbiotic organ upon 
metamorphosis? How does it affect the microbial symbiont therein? Here, we 
addressed these fundamental issues of symbiosis by experimentally manipulating 
insect metamorphosis. The stinkbug Plautia stali possesses a midgut symbiotic 
organ wherein an essential bacterial symbiont resides. By RNAi of master 
regulator genes for metamorphosis, Kr-h1 over nymphal traits and E93 over adult 
traits, we generated precocious adults and supernumerary nymphs of P. stali, 
thereby disentangling the effects of metamorphosis, growth level, developmental 
stage, and other factors on the symbiotic system. Upon metamorphosis, the 
symbiotic organ of P. stali was transformed from nymph type to adult type. The 
supernumerary nymphs and the precocious adults, respectively, developed 
nymph-type and adult-type symbiotic organs not only morphologically but also 
transcriptomically, uncovering that metamorphic remodeling of the symbiotic 
organ is under the control of the MEKRE93 pathway. Transcriptomic, cytological, 
and biochemical analyses unveiled that the structural and transcriptomic 
remodeling of the symbiotic organ toward adult emergence underpins its 
functional extension to food digestion in addition to the original role of 
symbiont retention for essential nutrient production. Notably, we found that the 
symbiotic bacteria in the adult-type symbiotic organ up-regulated genes for 
production of sulfur-containing essential amino acids, methionine and cysteine, 
that are rich in eggs and sperm, uncovering adult-specific symbiont functioning 
for host reproduction and highlighting intricate host-symbiont interactions 
associated with insect metamorphosis.

BACKGROUND: Inebilizumab, an anti-CD19 B cell-depleting antibody, reduced the 
risk of a neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) attack, disability 
worsening, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) lesion activity, and disease-related 
hospitalizations in participants with NMOSD in the N-MOmentum study 
(NCT02200770). However, the efficacy and safety outcomes of inebilizumab 
specific to an Asian population were not fully reported. Therefore, subgroup 
analyses of the N-MOmentum study were conducted post hoc to evaluate the 
efficacy and safety of inebilizumab in Asian participants with NMOSD.
METHODS: The N-MOmentum study was a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, 
placebo-controlled phase 2/3 trial with an open-label extension period (OLP). In 
the subgroup analyses, data from Asian participants from the N-MOmentum study 
were compared with those of non-Asian participants. Eligible participants were 
randomly allocated (3:1) to receive 300 mg intravenous (IV) inebilizumab or 
placebo on Days 1 and 15. Participants who had an NMOSD attack or completed the 
randomized controlled period (RCP) could enter the OLP, where they received 
inebilizumab for ≥2 years. All participants who entered the OLP received 
inebilizumab 300 mg IV every 6 months.
RESULTS: Overall, 230 participants received treatment (174 received inebilizumab 
and 56 received placebo), of whom 47 were Asian (39 received inebilizumab and 8 
received placebo). Baseline characteristics were similar between the Asian and 
non-Asian subgroups, except for disease duration, annualized relapse rate prior 
to randomization in this study, and previous maintenance therapy. In the Asian 
subgroup, the risk of NMOSD attacks was reduced with inebilizumab versus placebo 
(hazard ratio, 0.202) and the attack-free rate at 28 weeks was 82.1% with 
inebilizumab versus 37.5% with placebo, in the 6-month RCP. NMOSD attack rates 
were comparable between the Asian and non-Asian subgroups. In the Asian 
subgroup, the rates of Expanded Disability Status Scale worsening from baseline, 
active MRI lesions, and disease-related hospitalizations tended to be lower in 
the inebilizumab group than in the placebo group; similar results were shown in 
the non-Asian subgroup. For long-term efficacy and safety (RCP and OLP), the 
annualized adjudicated NMOSD attack rate in Asian participants treated with 
inebilizumab was reduced (0.096) compared with that at baseline (1.04), with a 
mean follow-up period of inebilizumab treatment of 3.38 years, which was 
consistent with the results in the non-Asian subgroup. The risk of NMOSD attack 
decreased with prolonged duration of treatment in both the 
inebilizumab/inebilizumab and placebo/inebilizumab groups in the Asian and 
non-Asian subgroups. The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) 
was similar between the Asian and non-Asian subgroups. In the Asian and 
non-Asian subgroups, 15.2% and 35.2% of participants, respectively, had at least 
one serious TEAE and/or Grade ≥3 TEAE during long-term therapy. No deaths 
occurred in the Asian subgroup whereas three deaths occurred in the non-Asian 
subgroup.
CONCLUSION: Inebilizumab reduced the risk of an NMOSD attack, progression of 
disability, MRI lesion activity, and disease-related hospitalizations in Asian 
participants with NMOSD. The efficacy of inebilizumab in reducing NMOSD attacks 
continued without any unexpected safety signals or concerns during long-term use 
in Asian participants.

As the use of radioligand therapy moves earlier in the prostate cancer timeline, 
minimizing the absorbed dose to normal organs while maintaining high tumor 
radiation doses becomes more clinically important because of the longer life 
expectancy of patients. We performed an intrapatient comparison of 
pretherapeutic dosimetry with the novel radiohybrid prostate-specific membrane 
antigen-targeting radiopharmaceutical 177Lu-rhPSMA-10.1, along with 
177Lu-PSMA-I&T, in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate 
cancer. Methods: Four consecutive patients with advanced histologically proven 
metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer who were scheduled for 
radioligand therapy were evaluated. Before undergoing therapy, each patient 
received 1.06 ± 0.05 GBq of 177Lu-rhPSMA-10.1 and 1.09 ± 0.02 GBq of 
177Lu-PSMA-I&T at least 7 d apart. For dosimetric assessment, whole-body planar 
scintigraphy was performed after 5 min, 4 h, 1 d, 2 d, and 7 d. In addition, 
SPECT/CT images were acquired over the thorax and the abdomen, 4 h, 1 d, 2 d, 
and 7 d after injection. Dosimetry of the whole body and salivary glands was 
based on the evaluation of the counts in whole-body planar imaging. Dosimetry of 
the kidneys, liver, spleen, bone marrow, and tumor lesions (≤4 per patient) was 
based on the activity in volumes drawn on SPECT/CT images. Doses were calculated 
using OLINDA/EXM version 1.0. The therapeutic index (TI), or ratio between mean 
dose of the metastases and mean dose of the kidneys, was calculated for each 
patient. Results: We found the dose to the kidneys to be higher with 
177Lu-rhPSMA-10.1 than with 177Lu-PSMA-I&T (0.68 ± 0.30 vs. 0.46 ± 0.10 
mGy/MBq); however, 177Lu-rhPSMA-10.1 delivered an average of a 3.3 times (range, 
1.2-8.3 times) higher absorbed radiation dose to individual tumor lesions. 
Consequently, intraindividual comparison revealed a 1.1-3.1 times higher TI for 
177Lu-rhPSMA-10.1 than for 177Lu-PSMA-I&T in all evaluated patients. The 
effective whole-body dose was 0.038 ± 0.008 mSv/MBq for 177Lu-rhPSMA-10.1 and 
0.022 ± 0.005 mSv/MBq for 177Lu-PSMA-I&T. Conclusion: Using 177Lu-rhPSMA-10.1 
can significantly increase the tumor-absorbed dose and improve the TI compared 
with 177Lu-PSMA-I&T. An improved TI gives the flexibility to maximize 
tumor-absorbed doses up to a predefined renal dose limit or, in earlier disease, 
to reduce the radiation exposure to the kidney while still achieving an 
effective tumor dose. The function of at-risk organs such as the kidneys is 
being assessed in a prospective clinical trial.

Links between Exercise Capacity, Exercise Training, and Metabolism.

Schiller University of Jena, Jena, Germany.

Exercise capacity of an individual describes the ability to perform physical 
activity. This exercise capacity is influenced by intrinsic factors such as 
genetic constitution and extrinsic factors such as exercise training. On the 
metabolic level exercise and metabolism are linked. As an important site of 
metabolism and the main source for ATP needed for muscle contraction, 
mitochondrial function can determine exercise capacity, and exercise inversely 
influences mitochondrial function. It has been suggested that exercise mediates 
many of its effects due to such metabolic changes. Although extrinsic factors 
affect exercise capacity, a major part of an individual's exercise capacity is 
genetically determined, and extrinsic factors can only improve on this baseline. 
Looking at the effect of exercise capacity on and with disease, the two go hand 
in hand. On one hand, disease is negatively affecting an individual's exercise 
capacity; on the other hand, exercise offers an effective treatment option. 
Combining these factors, exercise capacity is an often-ignored prognostic 
variable for life expectancy as well as morbidity and mortality. In this review, 
we aim to provide the current knowledge on the links between inherited and 
acquired exercise capacity, as well as the mechanisms in which metabolism 
interacts with exercise capacity. © 2023 American Physiological Society. Compr

OBJECTIVE: To compare the health-related quality of life and cost-effectiveness 
of robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery (RALS) versus conventional 'straight 
stick' laparoscopic surgery (CLS) in women undergoing hysterectomy as part of 
their treatment for either suspected or proven gynaecological malignancy.
DESIGN: Multicentre prospective observational cohort study.
SETTING: Patients aged 16+ undergoing hysterectomy as part of their treatment 
for gynaecological malignancy at 12 National Health Service (NHS) cancer units 
and centres in England between August 2017 and February 2020.
PARTICIPANTS: 275 patients recruited with 159 RALS, 73 CLS eligible for 
analysis.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcome was the European Organisation for Research and 
Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life measure (EORTC). Secondary outcomes included 
EuroQol-5 Dimension (EQ-5D-5L) utility, 6-minute walk test (6MWT), NHS costs 
using pounds sterling (£) 2018-2019 prices and cost-effectiveness. The 
cost-effectiveness evaluation compared EQ-5D-5L quality adjusted life years and 
costs between RALS and CLS.
RESULTS: No difference identified between RALS and CLS for EORTC, EQ-5D-5L 
utility and 6MWT. RALS had unadjusted mean cost difference of £556 (95% CI -£314 
to £1315) versus CLS and mean quality adjusted life year (QALY) difference of 
0.0024 (95% CI -0.00051 to 0.0057), non-parametric incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio of £231 667per QALY. For the adjusted 
cost-effectiveness analysis, RALS dominated CLS with a mean cost difference of 
-£188 (95% CI -£1321 to £827) and QALY difference of 0.0024 (95% CI -0.0008 to 
0.0057).
CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that RALS versus CLS in women undergoing 
hysterectomy (after adjusting for differences in morbidity) is cost-effective 
with lower costs and QALYs. Results are highly sensitive to the usage of robotic 
hardware with higher usage increasing the probability of cost-effectiveness. 
Non-inferiority randomised controlled trial would be of benefit to 
decision-makers to provide further evidence on the cost-effectiveness of RALS 
versus CLS but may not be practical due to surgical preferences of surgeons and 
the extensive roll out of RALS.
