OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the compliance and satisfaction of rehabilitation 
recommendations for advanced cancer patients hospitalized in the palliative care 
unit.
METHODS: Advanced cancer patients admitted to a hospice palliative care unit 
were recruited. Patients with advanced cancer and a life expectancy of less than 
6 months, as assumed by the oncologist were included. Patients who were expected 
to die within 3 days were excluded. ECOG and Karnofsky performance scales, 
function ambulatory category, level of ambulation, and survival days were 
evaluated under the perspective of comprehensive rehabilitation. Problem-based 
rehabilitations were provided categorized as physical therapy at the gym, 
bedside physical therapy, physical modalities, medications and pain 
intervention. Investigation of compliance for each category was completed. 
Patient satisfaction was surveyed using a questionnaire.
RESULTS: Forty-five patients were recruited and received evaluations for 
rehabilitation perspective. The subjects were reported to have gait-related 
difficulties (71.1%), pain (68.9%), poor medical conditions (68.9%), bladder or 
bowel problems (44.4%), dysphagias (11.1%), mental status issues (11.1%), edemas 
(11.1%), spasticity (2.2%), and pressure sores (2.2%). In the t-test, patients 
with good compliance for GymPT showed higher survival days (p<0.05). In the 
satisfaction survey, patients with performance scales showed a greater 
satisfaction in Spearman's correlation analysis (p<0.05).
CONCLUSION: Advanced cancer patients admitted to the hospice palliative care 
unit have many rehabilitation needs. Patients with a longer survival time showed 
better compliance for GymPT. Patients with a better performance scale showed a 
higher satisfaction. Comprehensive rehabilitation may be needed to advanced 
cancer patients in the hospice palliative care unit.

Huntington's disease (HD), an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder 
characterized by progressive striatal and cortical atrophy, has been strongly 
linked with neuroinflammation. Toll-like receptors, a family of innate immune 
receptors, are a major pathway for neuroinflammation with pleiotropic effects on 
neuronal plasticity and neurodevelopment. We assessed whether deficiency for 
TLRs 2, 3 or 4 affects life expectancy in the N171-82Q mouse model of HD. Our 
data indicate that homozygous TLRs 2 and 3 as well as heterozygous TLR4 
deficiency significantly extends the life expectancy of HD mice. Our data 
suggest that multiple TLR pathways may be involved in the neuroinflammatory and 
degenerative processes during HD.

OBJECTIVE: To define a new surgical option, with lower morbidity, for the 
treatment of intralabyrinthine schwannomas.
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective case review.
SETTING: Tertiary referral centers.
PATIENTS: Eight patients affected by an intralabyrinthine schwannoma, with or 
without extension to the internal auditory canal, that underwent surgery with a 
transcanal transpromontorial approach, were included in the study. The average 
age at presentation was 47 years. Patients' characteristics, symptoms, tumor 
features, and surgical results were analyzed.
INTERVENTIONS: All patients were diagnosed and evaluated pre-operatively with 
high-resolution, gadolinium-enhanced MRI and CT scan of the temporal bone, and 
underwent surgery via either transcanal transpromontorial endoscopic approach 
(TTEA) or enlarged transcanal transpromontorial endoscopic approach (ETTA).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Hearing function was evaluated with the Hearing 
Classification System according to the Committee on Hearing and Equilibrium 
Guidelines. Facial nerve function was evaluated using the House-Brackmann 
grading system (HB).
RESULTS: In six patients out of eight, a TTEA was performed, whereas, due to the 
extension of the pathology to the cerebellopontine angle, two patients underwent 
an ETTA. The mean follow-up period was 15.5 months (range 1-69). No 
intra-operative and post-operative major complications were observed. 
Post-operative facial nerve function was normal in seven out of eight patients 
(grade I HB). One patient presented a grade II HB.
CONCLUSION: The endoscopic approach to cochlear schwannoma represents a good 
treatment option for patients and should be preferred to other more invasive 
surgical techniques when indicated, to reduce complications, hospitalization, 
and offer to patients the chance to eradicate the disease, thus avoiding the 
stress of a long-life radiological follow-up.

The ethics of human enhancement has been a hotly debated topic in the last 
15 years. In this debate, some advocate examining science fiction stories to 
elucidate the ethical issues regarding the current phenomenon of human 
enhancement. Stories from science fiction seem well suited to analyze biomedical 
advances, providing some possible case studies. Of particular interest is the 
work of screenwriter Andrew Niccol (Gattaca, S1m0ne, In Time, and Good Kill), 
which often focuses on ethical questions raised by the use of new technologies. 
Examining the movie In Time (2011), the aim of this paper is to show how science 
fiction can contribute to the ethical debate of human enhancement. In Time 
provides an interesting case study to explore what could be some of the 
consequences of radical life-extension technologies. In this paper, we will show 
how arguments regarding radical life-extension portrayed in this particular 
movie differ from what is found in the scientific literature. We will see how In 
Time gives flesh to arguments defending or rejecting radical life-extension. It 
articulates feelings of unease, alienation and boredom associated with this 
possibility. Finally, this article will conclude that science fiction movies in 
general, and In Time in particular, are a valuable resource for a broad and 
comprehensive debate about our coming future.

Psychotropic drugs can induce weight gain and a metabolic syndrome, reducing the 
quality of life and the life expectancy of patients. Weight gain is also 
responsible for poor adherence to treatment and therefore relapses of mental 
illness. This weight gain and the metabolic syndrome are insufficiently treated 
for obese patients with mental disorders. Recommendations exist.

Publisher: Les psychotropes peuvent faire prendre du poids et induire un 
syndrome métabolique réduisant ainsi la qualité de vie et l’espérance de vie des 
patients. La prise de poids est également responsable d’une mauvaise adhésion 
aux traitements et donc de rechutes des maladies psychiques. Cette prise de 
poids et le syndrome métabolique sont insuffisamment traités pour les patients 
obèses souffrant de troubles psychiques. Des recommandations existent.

BACKGROUND: The Roma population has a high prevalence of cardiovascular risk 
factors, higher mortality, and shorter life expectancy. It is found in the 
largest number in Romania, but published data are still scarce here. We studied 
cardiovascular risk factors and disease along with target organ damage on a 
population of Roma inhabitants from Bucharest, Romania.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study enrolled 806 Roma subjects (18-83 years), in 
a community-based participatory research manner. Demographics included 
anthropometric data, a questionnaire on social status, education, medical 
history, and health deleterious behaviors. Medical evaluation included clinical 
examination, blood pressure, ankle-brachial index, pulse wave velocity 
measurements, blood tests (complete blood count, lipid profile, glucose, 
creatinine, uric acid), dip-stick microalbuminuria, dilated fundoscopy, ECG, and 
echocardiography.
RESULTS: Prevalence of all cardiovascular risk factors was high, peaking in 
abnormal lipid metabolism (82.13%), heavy smoking (63.02% including ex-smokers) 
and obesity (50.99%). The first and the latter were actually similar to the 
general population in Romania. Almost half of subjects were at high or very high 
risk for fatal cardiovascular disease.
CONCLUSIONS: The study shows that the Roma population in a more affluent region 
in Romania shares a similarly high cardiovascular burden to their surrounding 
community.

Breast cancer treatment in women over the age of 80 remains a complex issue due 
to pre-existing comorbidities, therapy-related toxicities, and the lack of 
evidence-based data in this population, leading to both overtreatment and under 
treatment. The average life expectancy of an 80-year-old woman is 9.7 years and 
chronologic age alone should not be a factor in withholding therapy. Women over 
age 80 should be treated on an individual basis, taking into account their 
overall health and life expectancy, their risk of dying from breast cancer 
versus other causes, and the benefits versus toxicities of therapies for their 
tumor. Invaluable online tools are readily available to easily assess life 
expectancy (ePrognosis), as well as the absolute survival benefits for every 
tumor type and stage in individual patients (PREDICT, Ajuvant!). This 
information should be presented to the patient so that they are able to make an 
informed decision based on their goals, wishes and quality of life. Vulnerable 
patients should not be bullied or scared into taking unwanted or unnecessary 
treatments.

INTRODUCTION: Physical activity (PA) and sedentary behavior (SB) have seasonal 
patterns. It remains unclear how these patterns are associated with sleep, 
meteorological factors, and health.
METHODS: Activity levels were continuously measured with an accelerometer for 
seven days between July 2011 and May 2016, among middle-aged (50-64 years), 
young-elderly (65-74 years) and old-elderly (≥75 years) participants of a 
population-based Dutch cohort study (n = 1116). Meteorological factors (ambient 
temperature, wind speed, sunlight hours, precipitation, and minimum visibility) 
were locally recorded. We first examined the seasonality of PA, SB, and 
nighttime sleep, stratified by age group. Second, we examined the influence of 
meteorological factors. Third, we modeled the potential seasonality of the 
all-cause mortality risk due to the seasonality of PA and SB, by using 
previously published relative risks.
RESULTS: Levels of light and moderate-to-vigorous PA were higher in summer than 
in winter among middle-aged (seasonal variation = 18.1 and 14.8 min/day) and 
young-elderly adults (12.8 and 8.6 min/day). The pattern was explained by 
ambient temperature and sunlight hours. Nighttime sleep was 31.8 min/day longer 
in winter among middle-aged adults. SB did not show a seasonal pattern. No 
seasonality in activity levels was observed among old-elderly adults. The 
all-cause mortality risk may be higher in winter than in summer due to the 
accumulation of low levels of moderate to vigorous PA and high levels of SB.
CONCLUSION: PA has a larger degree of seasonality than SB and nighttime sleep 
among middle-aged and young-elderly adults. SB appears strongly ingrained in 
daily routine. Recommending the interruption of SB with light PA might be a good 
starting point for public health institutions.

Fatal Bleeding in Conjunction with Mandibular Medication-related Osteonecrosis 
of the Jaw (MRONJ).

College.

Here, we report a case of fatal bleeding in conjunction with mandibular 
medicationrelated osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ). A 75-year-old Japanese man 
was referred to our department with osteonecrosis of the jaw due to 
bisphosphonate (BP) for multiple bone metastases from prostate cancer. 
Aggressive surgical intervention was ruled out due to a poor prognosis in terms 
of life expectancy. Death occurred due to hemorrhagic shock resulting from 
massive oral bleeding caused by necrosis of the mandible. Numerous reports have 
suggested that jaw necrosis is induced not only by BP, but also RANKL antibody, 
steroids, and molecularly-targeted agents. This suggests that the number of 
cases of MRONJ is likely to increase among elderly patients in whom general 
health is already poor. The American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial 
Surgery recommends aggressive treatment only in cases of stage 3 disease. 
Therefore, such a therapeutic strategy may only be available for cases of jaw 
necrosis in which the general health status of the patient is otherwise good. To 
prevent a life-threatening outcome in cases of MRONJ, physicians, who are 
responsible for determining the drug strategy, should cooperate with oral 
surgeons in determining the best therapeutic strategy.

Paulo, SP, Brazil.

BACKGROUND: Due to rising life expectancy of population, very complex surgical 
procedures such as pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD), are more commonly being 
performed in elderly patients. The objective of this study was to evaluate the 
safety of PD in patients older than 75 years old and the risk factors associated 
with severe complications.
METHODS: Patients who underwent PD for periampullary tumors were retrospectively 
reviewed and divided into two groups, A (<75 years) and B (>75 years). The 
primary endpoint was severe postoperative complications (Clavien 3 or greater). 
Secondary endpoints were mortality and any complications.
RESULTS: Ninety consecutive patients underwent PD for periampullary tumors in 
the studied period, 70 in group A and 20 in group B. Clinical and pathological 
characteristics of both groups were equivalents except for age. There were no 
difference regarding the incidence of severe complications (17% vs. 10%, P=0.72) 
or all complications (50% vs. 50%, P>0.999). Although mortality was greater in 
group A (8.6% vs. 0%), it was not statistically significant (P=0.333). On 
multivariate analyses, only male sex, obesity and American Society of 
Anesthesiology Score of 3 or 4 were associated with severe postoperative 
complications.
CONCLUSIONS: Poor clinical status, obesity and male gender are associated with 
severe complications in PD, but not age greater than 75 years, therefore PD can 
be considered safe in elderly patients and age itself should not be a 
contraindication for PD.

[Hospice - continuing care during patients life].

[Article in Czech]

Polívka J.

Palliative care is focused on enhancing quality of life for seriously ill. 
Hospice care is a comprehensive care provided by an interdisciplinary team for 
patients whose diseases cannot be cured and are approaching the end of life. To 
be eligible for admission to hospice care is required to be terminally ill with 
a life expectancy of 6 months or less. Currently, hospices are the main 
providers of specialized palliative care in the Czech Republic. This article is 
focused on the current state of palliative care and specifically on hospice care 
in the Czech Republic. This article should eliminate the myths associated with 
the hospice. It could also help physicians to better understand the role of 
hospice in delivering effective care for patients in the final stages of life.

On what basis are medical cost-effectiveness thresholds set? Clashing opinions 
and an absence of data: a systematic review.

, Sweden.

BACKGROUND: The amount a government should be willing to invest in adopting new 
medical treatments has long been under debate. With many countries using formal 
cost-effectiveness (C/E) thresholds when examining potential new treatments and 
ever-growing medical costs, accurately setting the level of a C/E threshold can 
be essential for an efficient healthcare system.
OBJECTIVES: The aim of this systematic review is to describe the prominent 
approaches to setting a C/E threshold, compile available national-level C/E 
threshold data and willingness-to-pay (WTP) data, and to discern whether 
associations exist between these values, gross domestic product (GDP) and 
health-adjusted life expectancy (HALE). This review further examines current 
obstacles faced with the presently available data.
METHODS: A systematic review was performed to collect articles which have 
studied national C/E thresholds and willingness-to-pay (WTP) per 
quality-adjusted life year (QALY) in the general population. Associations 
between GDP, HALE, WTP, and C/E thresholds were analyzed with correlations.
RESULTS: Seventeen countries were identified from nine unique sources to have 
formal C/E thresholds within our inclusion criteria. Thirteen countries from 
nine sources were identified to have WTP per QALY data within our inclusion 
criteria. Two possible associations were identified: C/E thresholds with HALE 
(quadratic correlation of 0.63), and C/E thresholds with GDP per capita 
(polynomial correlation of 0.84). However, these results are based on few 
observations and therefore firm conclusions cannot be made.
CONCLUSIONS: Most national C/E thresholds identified in our review fall within 
the WHO's recommended range of one-to-three times GDP per capita. However, the 
quality and quantity of data available regarding national average WTP per QALY, 
opportunity costs, and C/E thresholds is poor in comparison to the importance of 
adequate investment in healthcare. There exists an obvious risk that countries 
might either over- or underinvest in healthcare if they base their 
decision-making process on erroneous presumptions or non-evidence-based 
methodologies. The commonly referred to value of 100,000$ USD per QALY may 
potentially have some basis.

In the context of the White Book of Physical and Rehabilitation Medicine (PRM) 
in Europe, this paper deals with the future perspectives of PRM in Europe 
according to the actual vision of the European Bodies. All Chapters stress the 
big changes that Europe is facing in terms of demography, life expectancy, 
survival rates, disability burden, increasing prevalence of long-term health 
conditions, progress in technology, but also health costs and society changes in 
terms of requirements of wellness and quality of life together with health. All 
these challenges combined with the specificities of PRM, that is the medical 
specialty focusing on the whole person and its functioning in the various health 
conditions, with the aim to guarantee the best possible participation through 
improvement of activities and reduction of impairments. The possible 
consequences of these changes in the future evolution of PRM clinical practice, 
services, education, research are presented; moreover, the vision on the 
progress to harmonization of the development of PRM across Europe, and the 
possible contribution of PRM to policy planning are presented.

BACKGROUND: Matrix-based cell therapy improves surgical handling, increases 
patient comfort, and allows for expanded indications with better reliability 
within the knee joint. Five-year efficacy and safety of autologous cultured 
chondrocytes on porcine collagen membrane (MACI) versus microfracture for 
treating cartilage defects have not yet been reported from any randomized 
controlled clinical trial.
PURPOSE: To examine the clinical efficacy and safety results at 5 years after 
treatment with MACI and compare these with the efficacy and safety of 
microfracture treatment for symptomatic cartilage defects of the knee.
STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.
METHODS: This article describes the 5-year follow-up of the SUMMIT (Superiority 
of MACI Implant Versus Microfracture Treatment) clinical trial conducted at 14 
study sites in Europe. All 144 patients who participated in SUMMIT were eligible 
to enroll; analyses of the 5-year data were performed with data from patients 
who signed informed consent and continued in the Extension study.
RESULTS: Of the 144 patients randomized in the SUMMIT trial, 128 signed informed 
consent and continued observation in the Extension study: 65 MACI (90.3%) and 63 
microfracture (87.5%). The improvements in Knee injury and Osteoarthritis 
Outcome Score (KOOS) Pain and Function domains previously described were 
maintained over the 5-year follow-up. Five years after treatment, the 
improvement in MACI over microfracture in the co-primary endpoint of KOOS pain 
and function was maintained and was clinically and statistically significant ( P 
= .022). Improvements in activities of daily living remained statistically 
significantly better ( P = .007) in MACI patients, with quality of life and 
other symptoms remaining numerically higher in MACI patients but losing 
statistical significance relative to the results of the SUMMIT 2-year analysis. 
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evaluation of structural repair was performed 
in 120 patients at year 5. As in the 2-year SUMMIT (MACI00206) results, the MRI 
evaluation showed improvement in defect filling for both treatments; however, no 
statistically significant differences were noted between treatment groups.
CONCLUSION: Symptomatic cartilage knee defects 3 cm2 or larger treated with MACI 
were clinically and statistically significantly improved at 5 years compared 
with microfracture treatment. No remarkable adverse events or safety issues were 
noted in this heterogeneous patient population.

As a result of the rapidly growing global population and limited agricultural 
area, sufficient supply of cereals for food and animal feed has become 
increasingly challenging. Consequently, it is essential to reduce pre- and 
post-harvest crop losses. Extensive research, featuring several physical 
treatments, has been conducted to improve cereal post-harvest preservation, 
leading to increased food safety and sustainability. Various pests can lead to 
post-harvest losses and grain quality deterioration. Microbial spoilage due to 
filamentous fungi and bacteria is one of the main reasons for post-harvest crop 
losses and mycotoxins can induce additional consumer health hazards. In 
particular, physical treatments have gained popularity making chemical additives 
unnecessary. Therefore, this review focuses on recent advances in physical 
treatments with potential applications for microbial post-harvest 
decontamination of cereals. The treatments discussed in this article were 
evaluated for their ability to inhibit spoilage microorganisms and degrade 
mycotoxins without compromising the grain quality. All treatments evaluated in 
this review have the potential to inhibit grain spoilage microorganisms. 
However, each method has some drawbacks, making industrial application 
difficult. Even under optimal processing conditions, it is unlikely that cereals 
can be decontaminated of all naturally occurring spoilage organisms with a 
single treatment. Therefore, future research should aim for the development of a 
combination of treatments to harness their synergistic properties and avoid 
grain quality deterioration. For the degradation of mycotoxins the same 
conclusion can be drawn. In addition, future research must investigate the fate 
of degraded toxins, to assess the toxicity of their respective degradation 
products.

OBJECTIVES: Considering the good immediate results reported for transcatheter 
aortic valve implantation in high-risk patients, the role of conventional aortic 
valve replacement (AVR) is being questioned, especially in elderly patients. The 
aim of this study was to evaluate our long-term results of conventional AVR in 
octogenarians.
METHODS: A total of 2005 patients aged ≥80 years underwent AVR for aortic 
stenosis in our institution between 1978 and 2011. Of these, 1009 (50%) patients 
had an associated extracardiac comorbidity and 650 (32%) patients had coronary 
lesions. Valve replacement was the sole procedure in 1515 (76%) patients, and 
396 (19%) patients had concomitant coronary artery bypass grafting. Data were 
collected at the time of surgery in our database, and regularly updated by 
mailed questionnaires and telephone contact.
RESULTS: Early mortality of isolated AVR was 5.5% for the last 10 years of the 
series. Significant risk factors were chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 
chronic renal failure, advanced cardiac disease [left or right ventricular 
failure, New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class IV and atrial fibrillation] and 
coronary disease. Long-term follow-up was 99.5% complete (9 patients lost to 
follow-up), totalling 8849 patient-years. Nine hundred and one patients died at 
late follow-up with a median survival of 7.1 years, with 7 patients becoming 
centenarian. Apart from older age, main late causes of death were cardiovascular 
(20.5%), neurological deficit (10.2%) and cancer (10.2%). Actuarial survival was 
83%, 62.5% and 25% at 2, 5 and 10 years, respectively. This survival compares 
favourably with that of a French-matched population. Above all, 90% of late 
survivors reported functional improvement. Univariable and multivariable 
analysis identified risk factors of late death as male gender, associated 
comorbidity, renal failure, advanced cardiac disease, atrial fibrillation and 
impaired ventricular function. Coronary lesions, associated cardiac surgery and 
small diameter prostheses (19 or 21 mm) did not impair long-term survival.
CONCLUSIONS: AVR is effective for all age groups to treat aortic stenosis. 
Elderly people should not be denied surgery only because of their old age as 
conventional AVR provides an excellent quality of life and restores life 
expectancy. Percutaneous valve implantation is to be considered, in cases of 
non-operable or high-risk patients. However, to date, open-heart surgery remains 
the treatment of choice for aortic stenosis for the majority of patients.

The complexity and heterogeneity of adult spinal deformity (ASD) creates 
significant difficulties in performing high-quality, complete economic analyses. 
For the same reasons, however, such studies are immensely valuable to clinicians 
and health policy experts. There has been a paradigm shift towards value-based 
healthcare provision and as such, there is an increasing focus on demonstrating 
not just the value ASD surgery, but the provision of care at large. 
Health-related quality of life measures are an important tool for assessing 
value of an intervention and its effect on a quality-adjusted life year (QALY). 
Currently, there are no definitive criteria in regard to assigning the 
appropriate value to a QALY. A general accepted threshold discussed in 
literature is $100 000 per QALY gained. However, this figure may be variable 
across populations, and may not necessarily be applicable in today's economy, or 
in all healthcare economies. Fundamentally, an effective treatment method may be 
associated with a high upfront cost, however, if durable, will be cost-effective 
over time.The emphasis on carotid endarterectomy and CUA in the field of adult 
spine deformity is relatively recent; therefore, there is a limited amount of 
data on cost-effectiveness analyses. Continued efforts with emphasis on 
value-based outcomes are needed with long-term follow-up studies.

With improved life expectancy and the aging population, the global burden of 
atrial fibrillation (AF) continues to increase, and with AF comes an estimated 
fivefold increased risk of ischaemic stroke. Prophylactic anticoagulant therapy 
is more effective in reducing the risk of ischaemic stroke in AF patients than 
acetylsalicylic acid or dual-antiplatelet therapy combining ASA with 
clopidogrel. Non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants are the standard of 
care for stroke prevention in patients with non-valvular AF. The optimal 
anticoagulant strategy to prevent thromboembolism in AF patients who are 
undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention and stenting, those who have 
undergone successful transcatheter aortic valve replacement and those with 
embolic stroke of undetermined source are areas of ongoing research. This 
article provides an update on three randomized controlled trials of rivaroxaban, 
a direct, oral factor Xa inhibitor, that are complete or are ongoing, in these 
unmet areas of stroke prevention: oPen-label, randomized, controlled, 
multicentre study explorIng twO treatmeNt stratEgiEs of Rivaroxaban and a 
dose-adjusted oral vitamin K antagonist treatment strategy in patients with 
Atrial Fibrillation who undergo Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PIONEER 
AF-PCI) trial; the New Approach riVaroxaban Inhibition of factor Xa in a Global 
trial vs Aspirin to prevenT Embolism in Embolic Stroke of Undetermined Source 
(NAVIGATE ESUS) trial and the Global study comparing a rivAroxaban-based 
antithrombotic strategy to an antipLatelet-based strategy after transcatheter 
aortIc vaLve rEplacement to Optimize clinical outcomes (GALILEO) trial. The data 
from these studies are anticipated to help address continuing challenges for a 
range of patients at risk of stroke.

BACKGROUND: It is unclear whether the Ross procedure offers superior survival 
compared with mechanical aortic valve replacement (AVR).
OBJECTIVES: This study evaluated experience and compared long-term survival 
between the Ross procedure and mechanical AVR.
METHODS: Between 1992 and 2016, a total of 392 Ross procedures were performed. 
These were compared with 1,928 isolated mechanical AVRs performed during the 
same time period as identified using the University of Melbourne and Australia 
and New Zealand Society of Cardiac and Thoracic Surgeons' Cardiac Surgery 
Databases. Only patients between 18 and 65 years of age were included. 
Propensity-score matching was performed for risk adjustment.
RESULTS: Ross procedure patients were younger, and had fewer cardiovascular risk 
factors. The Ross procedure was associated with longer cardiopulmonary bypass 
and aortic cross-clamp times. Thirty-day mortality was similar (Ross, 0.3%; 
mechanical, 0.8%; p = 0.5). Ross procedure patients experienced superior 
unadjusted long-term survival at 20 years (Ross, 95%; mechanical, 68%; p < 
0.001). Multivariable analysis showed the Ross procedure to be associated with a 
reduced risk of late mortality (hazard ratio: 0.34; 95% confidence internal: 
0.17 to 0.67; p < 0.001). Among 275 propensity-score matched pairs, Ross 
procedure patients had superior survival at 20 years (Ross, 94%; mechanical, 
84%; p = 0.018).
CONCLUSIONS: In this Australian, propensity-score matched study, the Ross 
procedure was associated with better long-term survival compared with mechanical 
AVR. In younger patients, with a long life expectancy, the Ross procedure should 
be considered in centers with sufficient expertise.

What Is the Evidence from Past National Institute of Health and Care Excellence 
Single-Technology Appraisals Regarding Company Submissions with Base-Case 
Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratios of Less Than £10,000/QALY?

BACKGROUND: The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence has recently 
proposed that company submissions with a base-case incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of less than £10,000/quality-adjusted life-year 
(QALY) might be eligible for a "fast-track" appraisal.
OBJECTIVES: To explore outcomes relating to previously conducted 
single-technology appraisals (STAs) with base-case ICERs of less than 
£10,000/QALY.
METHODS: All STAs with published guidance from 2009 to 2016 were included; those 
with company base-case ICERs of less than £10,000/QALY were identified and 
analyzed. A secondary analysis was also conducted for those with a company 
base-case ICER of £10,000 to £15,000/QALY. Relevant data were extracted and 
presented in a narrative and in tables.
RESULTS: In total, 15% (26 of 171) of STAs included a company submission with a 
base-case ICER of less than £10,000/QALY. Of these, 73% (19 of 26) were given 
positive recommendations after the first Appraisal Committee (AC) meeting, 
whereas 27% (7 of 26) were initially given a Minded No before receiving a 
positive recommendation in the final appraisal determination, albeit with 
restricted recommendations for three technologies. Five STAs had company 
base-case ICERs of £10,000 to £15,000/QALY and all received a positive 
recommendation after the first AC meeting.
CONCLUSIONS: Most previous STAs with a company base-case ICER of £10,000 or even 
£15,000/QALY received a positive recommendation after the first AC meeting, but 
a number of them proved more complicated and required detailed appraisal, which 
influenced the final recommendation. This finding might have implications for 
the proposed fast-track process of the National Institute for Health and Care 
Excellence.

OBJECTIVES: To examine associations between four health behaviors (smoking, 
physical inactivity, heavy alcohol drinking, and obesity) and three health 
indices (health-related quality of life, life expectancy, and quality-adjusted 
life expectancy (QALE)) among US adults with depression.
METHODS: Data were obtained from the 2006, 2008, and 2010 Behavioral Risk Factor 
Surveillance System data. The EuroQol five-dimensional questionnaire (EQ-5D) 
health preference scores were estimated on the basis of extrapolations from the 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's healthy days measures. Depression 
scores were estimated using the eight-item Patient Health Questionnaire. Life 
expectancy estimates were obtained from US life tables, and QALE was estimated 
from a weighted combination of the EQ-5D scores and the life expectancy 
estimates. Outcomes were summarized by depression status for the four health 
behaviors (smoking, physical inactivity, heavy alcohol drinking, and obesity).
RESULTS: For depressed adults, current smokers and the physically inactive had 
significantly lower EQ-5D scores (0.040 and 0.171, respectively), shorter life 
expectancy (12.9 and 10.8 years, respectively), and substantially less QALE (8.6 
and 10.9 years, respectively). For nondepressed adults, estimated effects were 
similar but smaller. Heavy alcohol drinking among depressed adults, 
paradoxically, was associated with higher EQ-5D scores but shorter life 
expectancy. Obesity was strongly associated with lower EQ-5D scores but only 
weakly associated with shorter life expectancy.
CONCLUSIONS: Among depressed adults, physical inactivity and smoking were 
strongly associated with lower EQ-5D scores, life expectancy, and QALE, whereas 
obesity and heavy drinking were only weakly associated with these indices. These 
results suggest that reducing physical inactivity and smoking would improve 
health more among depressed adults.

Nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC) is the most common cancer, with the median age at 
NMSC diagnosis is 71 years. Treatment options for NMSC include surgical therapy, 
which is usually the first-choice treatment, and nonsurgical modalities. 
Therapeutic modalities depend on tumor localization, histologic type, and 
biologic behavior, as well as patient comorbidities, age, and life expectancy. 
Nonsurgical treatments include cryotherapy, local therapies (imiquimod, 
5-fluorouracil, ingenol mebutate, and diclofenac), photodynamic therapy, 
radiotherapy, and hedgehog inhibitors. Some of these treatments can be combined 
with curettage and electrodesiccation for better outcomes. Every treatment 
modality has advantages and disadvantages that must be carefully considered 
individually. Because the facial area is the most common localization of NMSC, 
treatment modalities with better cosmetic outcome are preferred. Although NMSC 
mostly occurs in the elderly, this review is focused on the features and 
nonsurgical therapy of NMSC in deep old age (≥85) and long-lived persons (aged 
>95); however, clinical trials very rarely involve this population group due to 
poor cooperation or poor general condition of these patients; thus, the 
respective knowledge being generally based on clinical experience.
