QALYs, P = 0.01) in the control group, and total mean costs were lower in the 
control group ($477, P < 0.001) over the trial duration. The intervention group 
was dominated by the control group. Results were robust to sensitivity analyses.
CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest policy makers should not adopt this intervention 
into routine health care in its current form. Further research into the efficacy 
and cost-effectiveness of telephone-based interventions for carers is required.

AIMS: The aims of this study were to compare the use of resources, costs, and 
quality of life outcomes associated with subacromial decompression, arthroscopy 
only (placebo surgery), and no treatment for subacromial pain in the United 
Kingdom National Health Service (NHS), and to estimate their cost-effectiveness.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: The use of resources, costs, and quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs) were assessed in the trial at six months and one year. 
Results were extrapolated to two years after randomization. Differences between 
treatment arms, based on the intention-to-treat principle, were adjusted for 
covariates and missing data were handled using multiple imputation. Incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated, with uncertainty around the values 
estimated using bootstrapping.
RESULTS: Cumulative mean QALYs/mean costs of health care service use and surgery 
per patient from baseline to 12 months were estimated as 0.640 (standard error 
(se) 0.024)/£3147 (se 166) in the decompression arm, 0.656 (se 0.020)/£2830 (se 
183) in the arthroscopy only arm and 0.522 (se 0.029)/£1451 (se 151) in the no 
treatment arm. Statistically significant differences in cumulative QALYs and 
costs were found at six and 12 months for the decompression versus no treatment 
comparison only. The probabilities of decompression being cost-effective 
compared with no treatment at a willingness-to-pay threshold of £20 000 per QALY 
were close to 0% at six months and approximately 50% at one year, with this 
probability potentially increasing for the extrapolation to two years.
DISCUSSION: The evidence for cost-effectiveness at 12 months was inconclusive. 
Decompression could be cost-effective in the longer-term, but results of this 
analysis are sensitive to the assumptions made about how costs and QALYs are 
extrapolated beyond the follow-up of the trial.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Cancer has a high incidence and death rate among older 
adults. The objective of this article is to summarize current literature about 
communication between older adults and medical professionals in cancer care. Our 
article addresses four categories related to communication: first, ageism; 
second, screening; third, treatment; and fourth, end of life (EoL) care.
RECENT FINDINGS: Current literature suggests that cancer treatment for older 
patients may be influenced by ageist biases. Older patients prefer that 
clinicians incorporate health status to individualize screening decisions 
although some patients don't consider life expectancy to be an important factor 
in screening. Patients often agree with the oncologists' treatment 
recommendations but want to be involved in the decision-making process. Lastly, 
work is being conducted to associate quality communication of EoL issues with 
hospital performance measures.
SUMMARY: Patients are at risk of age-based disparities in cancer screening, 
treatment, and EoL care. Older adults are not a homogenous group and all elderly 
cancer patients need to have an individualized approach to care. Medical 
professionals must understand patients' goals and values and involve them in 
shared decision-making and preparation for EoL.

Total Knee Arthroplasty: Using Decision Analytics to Find the Optimal Strategy 
Between One-Stage and Two-Stage Total Knee Revision.

School, Austin, Texas.

BACKGROUND: Periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) following total knee 
arthroplasty is a growing concern, as the demand for total knee arthroplasty 
(TKA) expands annually. Although 2-stage revision is considered the gold 
standard in management, there is substantial morbidity and mortality associated 
with this strategy. One-stage revision is associated with lower mortality rates 
and better quality of life, and there has been increased interest in utilizing 
the 1-stage strategy. However, surgeons are faced with a difficult decision 
regarding which strategy to use to treat these infections, considering 
uncertainty with respect to eradication of infection, quality of life, and 
societal costs with each strategy. The purpose of the current study was to use 
decision analysis to determine the optimal decision for the management of PJI 
following TKA.
METHODS: An expected-value decision tree was constructed to estimate the 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and costs associated with 1-stage and 
2-stage revision. Two decision trees were created: Decision Tree 1 was 
constructed for all pathogens, and Decision Tree 2 was constructed solely for 
difficult-to-treat infections, including methicillin-resistant infections. 
Values for parameters in the decision model, such as mortality rate, reinfection 
rate, and need for additional surgeries, were derived from the literature. 
Medical costs were derived from Medicare data. Sensitivity analysis determined 
which parameters in the decision model had the most influence on the optimal 
strategy.
RESULTS: In both decision trees, the 1-stage strategy produced greater health 
utility while also being more cost-effective. In the Monte Carlo simulation for 
Decision Trees 1 and 2, 1-stage was the dominant strategy in about 85% and 69% 
of the trials, respectively. Sensitivity analysis showed that the reinfection 
and 1-year mortality rates were the most sensitive parameters influencing the 
optimal decision.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite 2-stage revision being considered the current gold standard 
for infection eradication in patients with PJI following TKA, the optimal 
decision that produced the highest quality of life was 1-stage revision. These 
results should be considered in shared decision-making with patients who 
experience PJI following TKA.

BACKGROUND: While previous studies have shown higher union rates and a quicker 
return to work with operative treatment of substantially displaced clavicle 
fractures, there is disagreement whether operative treatment results in improved 
clinical outcomes. Patients who undergo operative treatment sometimes require 
additional surgery for implant removal. Nonoperative treatment may fail so that 
delayed surgical intervention is ultimately required. The duration for which the 
clinical benefits of operative treatment remain superior to those of 
nonoperative treatment has not been well established in the literature. 
Considering these uncertainties, surgeons are faced with a difficult decision 
regarding whether operative treatment of a midshaft clavicle fracture will be 
cost-effective. The purpose of this study was to identify the most 
cost-effective strategy by considering these uncertain parameters with use of 
decision-analysis techniques.
METHODS: An expected-value decision tree was built to estimate the 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and costs for operative and nonoperative 
treatment of substantially displaced midshaft clavicle fractures. Values for 
parameters in the decision model were derived from the literature. Medical costs 
were obtained from the Medicare database. A Markov model was used to calculate 
the QALYs for the duration of life expectancy. The decision model was used to 
analyze the duration for which the clinical results of operative treatment were 
superior to those of nonoperative treatment during the first 5 years after the 
operation and during a lifetime. Sensitivity analysis was performed to determine 
which parameters have the most influence on cost-effectiveness.
RESULTS: Operative treatment was more cost-effective than nonoperative treatment 
in 54% and 68% of the Monte Carlo trials in the 5-year and lifetime analyses, 
respectively. The cost per QALY with operative management was <$38,000 and 
<$8,000 in the 5-year and lifetime analyses, respectively. This is below the 
willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000 per QALY. For operative treatment to 
remain cost-effective, its clinical benefits must persist for at least 3 years.
CONCLUSIONS: Operative treatment is more cost-effective than nonoperative 
treatment for substantially displaced midshaft clavicle fractures. The clinical 
benefits derived with operative treatment must persist for at least 3 years for 
operative treatment to remain cost-effective. This research should not be used 
to conclude that all clavicle fractures should be treated surgically. It is best 
that such a decision is made through a patient-surgeon shared decision-making 
process.

OBJECTIVE: To gain insights into the virulence suppressive mechanism of a 
nonpathogenic strain of Rhizobium vitis ARK-1, we co-inoculated ARK-1 with a 
tumorigenic (Ti) strain of R. vitis to examine the expression of two essential 
virulence genes (virA and virG) and one non-essential gene (virD3) of the Ti 
strain at the wound site of grapevine.
RESULTS: Co-inoculation of ARK-1 with a Ti strain VAT03-9 at a 1:1 cell ratio 
into grapevine shoots resulted in significantly lower expression of the 
virulence genes virA, virD3, and virG of VAT03-9 at 1 day after inoculation 
compared with those when shoots were inoculated only with VAT03-9. ARK-1 was not 
able to catabolize acetosyringone, which is the plant-derived metabolites 
inducing the entire vir regulon in Ti strains, suggesting the direct effect of 
ARK-1 on the induction of broad range of vir genes of R. vitis Ti strains.

AIMS: Sarcopenia, which shortens healthy life expectancy, has recently been 
attracting attention because the Japanese population is rapidly aging. In this 
preliminary study, we estimated the prevalence of elderly diabetic patients who 
were complicated with sarcopenia and searched for any related clinical factors.
METHODS: Elderly (≥65 years of age) Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes 
mellitus were recruited by asking doctors to supply candidates for the study. 
The prevalence of sarcopenia was estimated based on the criteria proposed by the 
Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia in 2014.
RESULTS: Two hundred eighty-eight patients (151 males) were accepted for the 
study. The prevalence of sarcopenia was 15.2% in males and 15.3% in females. 
Multiple logistic regression analysis indicated that sarcopenia was 
significantly correlated with serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein in 
females, in addition to age and body mass index. Female patients were then 
classified into four groups according to the presence or absence of impaired 
muscle mass and/or impaired strength. Serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein 
was significantly higher in the sarcopenia group (those with impaired muscle 
mass and impaired strength) than in the other three groups.
CONCLUSIONS: After clarifying the prevalence of sarcopenia in elderly Japanese 
patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, we found that serum high-sensitivity 
C-reactive protein was significantly higher in female patients with sarcopenia 
than in female patients without sarcopenia. Elevated serum high-sensitivity 
C-reactive protein requires impaired muscle mass and impaired strength.

Life expectancy of people living with HIV (PLWH) is reaching similar length as 
in the general population. Accordingly, age-related comorbidities, including 
osteoporosis, are increasing. Fracture risk is higher and increases 
approximately 10 years earlier in PLWH. Classical risk factors of bone fragility 
are highly prevalent in PLWH but factors specific for HIV infection itself and 
the type of antiretroviral therapy (ART) (triple combination antiretroviral 
therapy) regimen (especially tenofovir and protease inhibitors) also contribute 
to bone loss. The majority of bone loss occurs during virus activity and at 
initiation of ART (immune reconstitution) and is associated with an increase of 
bone resorption (upregulation RANKL). Recent data indicate that calcium and 
vitamin D supplements as ART initiation lower BMD loss. The reduction of 
tenofovir plasma concentrations with tenofovir alafenamide attenuates BMD loss 
but it remains unknown whether it will contribute to reduce fracture risk. 
Hence, special considerations for the management of bone fragility in PLWH are 
warranted. Based on the current state of epidemiology and pathophysiology of 
osteoporosis in PLWH, we provide the consensus of the Swiss Association against 
Osteoporosis on best practice for diagnosis, prevention, and management of 
osteoporosis in this population. Periodic assessment of fracture risk is 
indicated in all HIV patients and general preventive measures should be 
implemented. All postmenopausal women, men above 50 years of age, and patients 
with other clinical risk for fragility fractures qualify for BMD measurement. An 
algorithm clarifies when treatment with bisphosphonates and review of ART 
regimen in favour of more bone-friendly options are indicated.

PURPOSE: The goal of this systematic review is to provide an update to the 
review by Pouwels et al. by conducting a systematic review and an assessment of 
the reporting quality of the economic analyses conducted since 2014.
METHODS: This systematic review identified published articles focused on 
metastatic breast cancer treatment using the Medline/PubMed and Scopus databases 
and the following search criteria: (((cost effectiveness[MeSH Terms]) OR (cost 
effectiveness) OR (cost-effectiveness) OR (cost utility) OR (cost-utility) OR 
(economic evaluation)) AND (("metastatic breast cancer") OR ("advanced breast 
cancer"))). The reporting quality of the included articles was evaluated using 
the International Society of Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR) 
Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) checklist.
RESULTS: Of the 256 identified articles, 67 of the articles were published after 
October 2014 when the prior systematic review stopped its assessment (Pouwels et 
al. in Breast Cancer Res Treat 165:485-498, 2017). From the 67 articles, we 
narrowed down to include 17 original health economic analyses specific to 
metastatic or advanced breast cancer. These articles were diverse with respect 
to methods employed and interventions included.
CONCLUSION: Although each of the articles contributed their own analytic 
strengths and limitations, the overall quality of the studies was moderate. The 
review demonstrated that the vast majority of the reported incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios exceeded the typically employed willingness to pay 
thresholds used in each country of analysis. Only three of the reviewed articles 
studied chemotherapies rather than treatments targeting either HER2 or hormone 
receptors, demonstrating a gap in the literature.

PURPOSE: From the MINDACT trial, Cardoso et al. did not demonstrate a 
significant efficacy for adjuvant chemotherapy (CT) for women with early-stage 
breast cancer presenting high clinical and low genomic risks. Our objective was 
to assess the usefulness of the 70-gene signature in this population by using an 
alternative endpoint: the number of Quality-Adjusted Life-Years (QALYs), i.e., a 
synthetic measure of quantity and quality of life.
METHODS: Based on the results of the MINDACT trial, we simulated a randomized 
clinical trial consisting of 1497 women with early-stage breast cancer 
presenting high clinical and low genomic risks. The individual preferences for 
the different health states and corresponding decrements were obtained from the 
literature.
RESULTS: The gain in terms of 5-year disease-free survival was 2.8% (95% CI from 
- 0.1 to 5.7%, from 90.4% for women without CT to 93.3% for women with CT). In 
contrast, due to the associated side effects, CT significantly reduced the 
number of QALYs by 62 days (95% CI from 55 to 70 days, from 4.13 years for women 
without CT to 3.96 years for women with CT).
CONCLUSION: Our results support the conclusions published by Cardoso et al. by 
providing additional evidence that the 70-gene signature can be used to avoid 
overtreatment by CT for women with high clinical risk but low genomic risk.

With increasing life expectancy and technological advancement, provision of 
anaesthesia for elderly patients has become a significant part of the overall 
case-load. These patients are unique, not only because they are older with more 
propensity for comorbidity but a decline in physiological reserve and cognitive 
function invariably accompanies ageing; this can substantially impact 
peri-operative outcome and quality of recovery. Furthermore, it is not only 
morbidity and mortality that matters; quality of life is also especially 
relevant in this vulnerable population. Comprehensive geriatric assessment is a 
patient-centred and multidisciplinary approach to peri-operative care. The 
assessment of frailty has a central role in the pre-operative evaluation of the 
elderly. Other essential domains include optimisation of nutritional status, 
assessment of baseline cognitive function and proper approach to patient 
counselling and the decision-making process. Anaesthetists should be proactive 
in multidisciplinary care to achieve better outcomes; they are integral to the 
process.

Human xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group A (XPA) is a scaffold protein 
that plays significant roles in DNA-damage verification and in recruiting 
downstream endonucleases to facilitate the repair of DNA lesions in 
nucleotide-excision repair. XPA98-219 (residues 98-219) has been identified as a 
DNA-binding domain and has been extensively studied in the last two decades. 
However, the most recent studies have redefined the DNA-binding domain as 
XPA98-239 (residues 98-239); it exerts a remarkably higher DNA-binding affinity 
than XPA98-219 and has a binding affinity that is quite similar to that of the 
full-length protein. Here, the production, crystallization and structure 
solution of human XPA98-239 are described. Crystals were obtained using a 
precipitant composed of 1.8 M ammonium citrate tribasic pH 7.0. Native X-ray 
diffraction data and zinc single-wavelength anomalous diffraction (SAD) data 
were collected to 1.93 and 2.06 Å resolution, respectively. The crystals 
belonged to space group P3, with unit-cell parameters a = 67.1, b = 67.1, c = 
35.6 Å, γ = 120.0°. Crystal-content analysis showed the presence of one molecule 
in the asymmetric unit, corresponding to a Matthews coefficient of 2.65 Å3 Da-1 
and a solvent content of 53.6%. The initial phases were solved and the structure 
model was automatically built by zinc SAD using the AutoSol program. The initial 
structure model covered 119 of 142 residues in the asymmetric unit, with an 
Rwork of 22.15% and an Rfree of 25.82%. Compared with a previously obtained 
truncated solution NMR structure of XPA (residues 98-210), a 19-residue 
C-terminal extension (residues 211-229, corresponding to 10 of the 20 extra 
C-terminal residues in the redefined domain for enhanced DNA binding) was 
contained in this initial model. Refinement of the atomic coordinates of XPA is 
ongoing.

Statin therapy in elderly patients.

[Article in English]

Piťha J, Topinková E, Bláha V, Jurašková B, Bureš I, Holmerová I, Vrablík M.

Cardiovascular events occur most frequently in patients at higher age groups. 
The elderly suffer not only more advanced and complex changes of cardiovascular 
system but, also, other chronic conditions. Moreover, compared to middle-age, 
different therapeutic response is often observed due to changes of 
pharmaco-kinetics and -dynamics; these patients use other medications, which may 
trigger drug interactions. The situation is further complicated by non-adherence 
related to frequent cognitive impairment. On one hand the elderly enjoy the 
greatest absolute benefit from adequate cardiovascular treatment while on the 
other they might be more susceptible to adverse reactions. In spite of the fact 
statins represent preventative medications, they must be indicated cautiously 
taken into consideration comorbidities, frailty and disability occurring in 
advanced age. Frail and disabled patients have greater risk of statin adverse 
effects, however, even these patients have lower mortality rates while being on 
statins. In seniors with life expectancy exceeding 5 years statins, when 
indicated, bring unambiguously proven benefit and should be considered 
high-priority medications. Key words: atherosclerosis - cardiovascular disease - 
dyslipidemia - elderly - frailty - management - statins.

BACKGROUND: For hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), liver resection is a classical 
curative modality, despite its technical complexity. The incidence of HCC in the 
oldest old people (aged ≥ 85 years) is rising along with the global increase in 
life expectancy. Currently, no report has addressed liver resection for HCC in 
this aged population.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of 1889 patients 
receiving curative liver resection for newly diagnosed HCC from 1992 to 2016. At 
the time of operation, 1858 of them were aged < 85 years (group A), and 31 were 
aged ≥ 85 years (group B). Another 18 oldest old patients, whose HCC was 
considered resectable but were not operated on due to the patient's refusal, 
served as the control group (group C). The clinicopathological characteristics 
and early and long-term outcomes were compared between groups A and B. All 
associated co-morbidities of the patients were well-treated before liver 
resection. The overall survival (OS) rates were also compared between groups B 
and C.
RESULT: Group B had a significantly higher incidence of associated 
co-morbidities and hepatitis C infection. Postoperative complication rates and 
90-day mortality rates after liver resection did not differ between groups A and 
B (p = 0.834 and p = 1.000, respectively), though group B had a longer 
postoperative stay (p = 0.001). In groups A and B, the 5-year disease-free 
survival rates were 29.7% and 22.6% (p = 0.163), respectively, and their overall 
survival rates were 43.5% and 35.5% (p = 0.086). The overall survival rate of 
group B was significantly different from group C (35.5% vs. 0%, p = 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Despite a longer postoperative recovery period, liver resection for 
HCC in the oldest old patients may be justified if co-morbidities are well 
controlled.

BACKGROUND: Patients with CML treated with TKI can have a life expectancy 
comparable to that of the general population. Due to the extended duration of 
TKI administration, treatment discontinuation has been increasingly sought.
METHODS: Medical records of 100 patients with CML who were in MR4.5 and 
discontinued their TKI outside clinical trials were reviewed.
RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 30 months (range, 5-112 months) after 
discontinuation, 35% and 17% lost MR4.5 and major molecular response (MMR), 
respectively. Only six patients lost MMR 12 months or more after 
discontinuation. Loss of MR4.5 was observed in 29% and 7% of patients with 
sustained MR4.5 duration of more than 2 and 6 years before discontinuation, 
respectively. By univariate analysis, there was a higher risk of loss of MR4.5 
for patients who were treated for less than 87 months, received second or 
subsequent line TKI, never received interferon, or those with sustained MR4.5 
for less than 6 years. By multivariate analysis, sustained MR4.5 for 6 years or 
more was the only significant predictor for durable response. Overall, 30% of 
patients who discontinued while in MR4.5 were retreated with 93% regaining MR4.5 
at a median of 5 months.
CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that under proper conditions, treatment 
discontinuation is feasible outside of clinical trial setting. MR4.5 duration of 
6 years or more before discontinuation is associated with very low risk of loss 
of MR4.5.

BACKGROUND: Intensive care services are one of the largest cost drivers in a 
hospital. Increasing life expectancy and comorbidities have resulted in an 
increased need for intensive care beds.
OBJECTIVES: To conduct a cost analysis of intensive care services at a central 
hospital in the public sector in South Africa (SA).
METHODS: A retrospective cost analysis for the 2015/16 financial year was 
conducted across two intensive care units (ICUs), a trauma ICU (10 beds) and a 
combined ICU for neurosurgery, medicine and surgery (18 beds). A mixed-methods 
costing approach was used based on the availability of data. The bottom-up 
approach was used to calculate the cost of clinical support, pharmaceuticals, 
consumables and human resources. The top-down approach was used to allocate the 
cost of equipment and goods and services.
RESULTS: There were 544 admissions resulting in 4 987 inpatient days during the 
study period. The total estimated inpatient cost across the two ICUs was ZAR114 
055 104, with a cost per patient day of ZAR22 870. The combined ICU cost per 
patient day was 58% higher than the cost per patient day in the trauma ICU 
(ZAR26 954 v. ZAR17 021). The mean cost per admission was ZAR157 883 in the 
trauma ICU and ZAR245 087 in the combined ICU. Human resources costs were the 
highest ICU cost driver (55%), followed by direct patient activity costs 
(medical consumables, pharmaceuticals, laboratory tests, radiology and blood 
products), which contributed 24%.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first reported cost analysis of intensive care services 
in SA. Our cost per patient day was higher than that reported in other 
lower-income countries, but lower than that in high-income countries. These 
costs vary owing to the different types of ICUs, wide spectrum of disease 
presentation and availability of diagnostic and treatment options. This study 
provides useful data that could assist in the planning and provision of 
intensive care services.

Choosing the optimal hemodialysis vascular access for the elderly patient is 
best achieved by a patient-centered coordinated multidisciplinary team approach 
that aligns the patient's end-stage kidney disease Life-Plan, i.e., the 
individual treatment approach (supportive care, time-limited or long-term kidney 
replacement therapy, or combination thereof) and selection of dialysis modality 
(peritoneal dialysis versus hemodialysis) with the most suitable dialysis 
access. Finding the right balance between the patient's preferences, the 
likelihood of access function and survival, and potential complications in the 
context of available resources and limited patient survival can be extremely 
challenging. The framework for choosing the most appropriate vascular access for 
the elderly presented in this review considers the individual end-stage kidney 
disease Life-Plan, the patient life expectancy, the likelihood of access 
function and survival, the timing of dialysis relative to access placement, 
prior access history, and patient preference. This complex decision-making 
process should be dynamic in order to accommodate patients' changing needs and 
life and health circumstances. Effective and timely communication between the 
patient, their caregivers, and treating team is key to delivering truly 
patient-centered care. Delivering this care also requires overcoming the 
limitations of the currently available evidence that is predominantly based on 
observational data with its inherent risks of bias. While challenging, future 
randomized controlled studies exploring the risks, benefits, costs, and timing 
of placement of available access types in the elderly are required to help us 
"get it right" for our patients.

Multiple medication and inappropriate drug prescription are prevalent and 
challenging problems in older patients in end-of-life situations, and increases 
both preventable adverse events and health care costs. Recent literature 
recommends de-prescribing some drugs in patients with short life expectancy, 
when the aim of drug treatments is not prevention or cure, but symptom control. 
Recently, a list of explicit criteria (STOPP-Frail) intended to guide 
prescribing physicians in decision making on the use of drugs in older patients 
with terminal conditions. This article presents a Spanish version of such 
criteria, which have been named STOPP-Pal to avoid confusion with the current 
concept of frailty.

Heart failure (HF) is a progressively debilitating disease that considerably 
decreases the life expectancy and quality of life. It has become an important 
area of focus since it remains one of the most common reasons for admission in 
patients over the age of 65. Importantly, the incidence of HF has not declined 
within the past 20 years, but the survival after onset has increased in younger 
patients and men. This has been in part due to the growing interest in therapies 
that may decrease morbidity, mortality, along with the substantial health care 
expenditures associated with the disease. It can be said that over the past 
50 years, there have been three distinct eras relating to HF management; a) the 
non-pharmacologic era, focused its treatments on fluid restriction; b) the 
pharmacologic era, marked by the increased use of inotropes and diuretics and 
the discovery of vasodilators, and the posterior discovery of medications 
relating to neurohormonal pathways; c) the device era, with the discovery, 
acceptance, and increased use of implantable cardioverter defibrillators, 
cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT), and left ventricular assist devices 
(LVADs) among others. A new forth era could be about to arrive, with the advent 
of regenerative therapies. In this review article will discuss new therapeutic 
discoveries as well as provide insight into future therapies.

Clival osteomyelitis is a life-threatening complication of untreated malignant 
otitis externa or paranasal sinus infection. Although various pathogens have 
been implicated, to our knowledge, primary nocardial clival osteomyelitis has 
never been reported. We describe a 74-year-old woman who presented with 
headaches, abducens and hypoglossal nerve palsies, facial numbness, photophobia, 
and neck stiffness. Imaging revealed a heterogeneous mass within the sphenoid 
sinus with clival extension. The lesion was extirpated via a binostril 
endoscopic endonasal transsphenoidal approach. Histopathological and 
microbiological examination revealed a nocardial source. Clival osteomyelitis 
associated with sphenoid sinusitis should be included in the differential 
diagnosis of progressive skull base lesions in the setting of an underlying 
infection. Early recognition and intervention with antibiotics and surgical 
debridement is essential in the management of this rare entity.

The burden of liver-related morbidity remains high among HIV-infected patients, 
despite advances in the treatment of HIV and viral hepatitis. Especially, the
