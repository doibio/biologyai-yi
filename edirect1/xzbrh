BACKGROUND: Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) comprise storage symptoms, 
voiding symptoms and post-voiding symptoms. Prevalence and severity of LUTS 
increase with age and the progressive increase in the aged population group has 
emphasised the importance to our society of appropriate and effective management 
of male LUTS. Identification of causal mechanisms is needed to optimise 
treatment and uroflowmetry is the simplest non-invasive test of voiding 
function. Invasive urodynamics can evaluate storage function and voiding 
function; however, there is currently insufficient evidence to support 
urodynamics becoming part of routine practice in the clinical evaluation of male 
LUTS.
DESIGN: A 2-arm trial, set in urology departments of at least 26 National Health 
Service (NHS) hospitals in the United Kingdom (UK), randomising men with 
bothersome LUTS for whom surgeons would consider offering surgery, between a 
care pathway based on urodynamic tests with invasive multichannel cystometry and 
a care pathway based on non-invasive routine tests. The aim of the trial is to 
determine whether a care pathway not including invasive urodynamics is no worse 
for men in terms of symptom outcome than one in which it is included, at 18 
months after randomisation. This primary clinical outcome will be measured with 
the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS). We will also establish whether 
inclusion of invasive urodynamics reduces rates of bladder outlet surgery as a 
main secondary outcome.
DISCUSSION: The general population has an increased life-expectancy and, as men 
get older, their prostates enlarge and potentially cause benign prostatic 
obstruction (BPO) which often requires surgery. Furthermore, voiding symptoms 
become increasingly prevalent, some of which may not be due to BPO. Therefore, 
as the population ages, more operations will be considered to relieve BPO, some 
of which may not actually be appropriate. Hence, there is sustained interest in 
the diagnostic pathway and this trial could improve the chances of an accurate 
diagnosis and reduce overall numbers of surgical interventions for BPO in the 
NHS. The morbidity, and therapy costs, of testing must be weighed against the 
cost saving of surgery reduction.

BACKGROUND: Anxiety disorders are among the most prevalent psychiatric 
conditions, and are associated with poor quality of life and substantial 
economic burden. Cognitive behavioural therapy is an effective treatment to 
reduce anxiety symptoms, but is also costly and labour intensive. 
Cost-effectiveness could possibly be improved by delivering cognitive 
behavioural therapy in a blended format, where face-to-face sessions are 
partially replaced by online sessions. The aim of this trial is to determine the 
cost-effectiveness of blended cognitive behavioural therapy for adults with 
anxiety disorders, i.e. panic disorder, social phobia or generalized anxiety 
disorder, in specialized mental health care settings compared to face-to-face 
cognitive behavioural therapy. In this paper, we present the study protocol. It 
is hypothesized that blended cognitive behavioural therapy for anxiety disorders 
is clinically as effective as face-to-face cognitive behavioural therapy, but 
that intervention costs may be reduced. We thus hypothesize that blended 
cognitive behavioural therapy is more cost-effective than face-to-face cognitive 
behavioural therapy.
METHODS/DESIGN: In a randomised controlled equivalence trial 156 patients will 
be included (n = 78 in blended cognitive behavioural therapy, n = 78 in 
face-to-face cognitive behavioural therapy) based on a power of 0.80, calculated 
by using a formula to estimate the power of a cost-effectiveness analysis: 
[Formula: see text]. Measurements will take place at baseline, midway treatment 
(7 weeks), immediately after treatment (15 weeks) and 12-month follow-up. At 
baseline a diagnostic interview will be administered. Primary clinical outcomes 
are changes in anxiety symptom severity as measured with the Beck Anxiety 
Inventory. An incremental cost-effectiveness ratio will be calculated to obtain 
the costs per quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) measured by the EQ-5D (5-level 
version). Health-economic outcomes will be explored from a societal and health 
care perspective.
DISCUSSION: This trial will be one of the first to provide information on the 
cost-effectiveness of blended cognitive behavioural therapy for anxiety 
disorders in routine specialized mental health care settings, both from a 
societal and a health care perspective.

BACKGROUND: Back pain is one of the most expensive health complaints. Comparing 
the economic aspects of back pain interventions may therefore contribute to a 
more efficient use of available resources. This study reports on a long-term 
cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) and cost-utility analysis (CUA) of two 
treatments as viewed from a societal perspective: 1) exposure in vivo treatment 
(EXP), a recently developed cognitive behavioral treatment for patients with 
chronic low back pain who have elevated pain-related fear and 2) the more 
commonly used graded activity (GA) treatment.
METHODS: Sixty-two patients with non-specific chronic low back pain received 
either EXP or GA. Primary data were collected at four participating treatment 
centers in the Netherlands. Primary outcomes were self-reported disability (for 
the CEA) and quality-adjusted life years (for the CUA). Program costs, health 
care utilization, patient and family costs, and production losses were measured 
by analyzing therapy records and cost diaries. Data was gathered before, during, 
and after treatment, and at 6 and 12 months after treatment. Non-parametric 
bootstrap analyses were used to quantify the uncertainty concerning the 
cost-effectiveness ratio. In addition, cost-effectiveness planes and 
cost-effectiveness acceptability curves were performed.
RESULTS: EXP showed a tendency to reduce disability, increase quality adjusted 
life years and decrease costs compared to GA. The incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratios of both the CEA and CUA are in favor of EXP.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on these results, implementing EXP for this group of patients 
seems to be the best decision.

BACKGROUND: Urinary incontinence occurs in 40 % of women aged 65 years and over; 
however, only 15 % seek care and many delay healthcare seeking for years. 
Incontinence is associated with depression, social isolation, reduced quality of 
life, falls and other comorbidities. It is accompanied by an enormous cost to 
the individual and society. Despite the substantial implications of urinary 
incontinence on social, psychological and physical well-being of older women, 
the impact of continence promotion on urinary symptom improvement and subsequent 
effects on falls, quality of life, stigma, social participation and the cost of 
care remains unknown.
METHODS: This study is a mixed methods multi-national open-label 2-arm parallel 
cluster randomized controlled trial aiming to recruit 1000 community-dwelling 
incontinent women aged 65 years and older across Quebec, Western Canada, France 
and United Kingdom. Participants will be recruited through community 
organizations. Data will be collected at 6 time points: baseline and 1 week, 3 
months, 6 months, 9 months and 12 months after baseline. One of the primary 
objectives is to evaluate whether the continence promotion intervention improves 
incontinence symptoms (measured with the Patient Global Impression of 
Improvement questionnaire, PGI-I) at 12 months post intervention compared to the 
control group. Other co-primary outcomes include changes in incontinence-related 
stigma, fall reduction, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio and 
quality-adjusted life years. Data analysis will account for correlation of 
outcomes (clustering) within community organizations. A qualitative sub-study 
will explore stigma reduction.
DISCUSSION: Community-based continence promotion programs may be a 
cost-effective strategy to reduce urinary incontinence, stigma and falls among 
older women with untreated incontinence, and simultaneously improve quality of 
life and healthy active life expectancy.

OBJECTIVES: Comorbid major depression is associated with reduced quality of life 
and greater use of healthcare resources. A recent randomised trial (SMaRT, 
Symptom Management Research Trials, Oncology-2) found that a collaborative care 
treatment programme (Depression Care for People with Cancer, DCPC) was highly 
effective in treating depression in patients with cancer. This study aims to 
estimate the cost-effectiveness of DCPC compared with usual care from a health 
service perspective.
METHODS: Costs were estimated using UK national unit cost estimates and health 
outcomes measured using quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Incremental 
cost-effectiveness of DCPC compared with usual care was calculated and scenario 
analyses performed to test alternative assumptions on costs and missing data. 
Uncertainty was characterised using cost-effectiveness acceptability curves. The 
probability of DCPC being cost-effective was determined using the UK National 
Institute for Health and Care Excellence's (NICE) cost-effectiveness threshold 
range of £ 20,000 to £ 30,000 per QALY gained.
RESULTS: DCPC cost on average £ 631 more than usual care per patient, and 
resulted in a mean gain of 0.066 QALYs, yielding an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio of £ 9549 per QALY. The probability of DCPC being 
cost-effective was 0.9 or greater at cost-effectiveness thresholds above £ 
20,000 per QALY for the base case and scenario analyses.
CONCLUSIONS: Compared with usual care, DCPC is likely to be cost-effective at 
the current thresholds used by NICE. This study adds to the weight of evidence 
that collaborative care treatment models are cost-effective for depression, and 
provides new evidence regarding their use in specialist medical settings.

BACKGROUND: Frailty predicts dependence and mortality, and is an important 
health indicator for aging populations. Comparing frailty prevalence between 
populations of the same ethnicity but different socioeconomic, lifestyle, health 
and social care systems, and environmental characteristics would address the 
role of these factors in contributing to frailty.
METHODS: We compare frailty prevalence and contributory factors across three 
Chinese populations: Beijing rural, Beijing urban, and Hong Kong (urban). Older 
people aged 65 years and above living in the community were invited to respond 
to a general health questionnaire covering demographic, socioeconomic, medical 
and drug histories, geriatric syndromes, assessment of physical and cognitive 
functioning, psychological wellbeing and nutritional status. Frailty is defined 
as an index calculated from multiple deficits > = 0.25 (FI). The ratio of 
FI/life expectancy at birth was used as an indicator of compression of 
morbidity. Risk factors and attributable fraction for frailty were compared 
across the three cohorts.
RESULTS: The prevalence of frailty increases with age in all three cohorts, and 
was lower among rural compared with urban (Beijing and Hong Kong) populations. 
The highest FI/LE ratio was observed in the Beijing urban population, followed 
by Hong Kong, with the Beijing rural population having the lowest ratio. Risk 
factors for frailty were similar in all three populations. Those having the 
highest ORs were multi-morbidity (number of diseases > = 3), polypharmacy 
(number of drugs > = 4), age 85+, female gender, followed by low education 
level, and physical inactivity. For all three cohorts, age and multi-morbidity 
constitute the highest attributable fraction, and were highest in the Beijing 
rural cohort. A major difference between the Beijing and Hong Kong cohorts is 
the high AF from polypharmacy in Beijing and the 'protective' contribution of 
being married; and the effect of being a teetotaler in the Hong Kong cohort.
CONCLUSIONS: This comparison draws attention to the importance of frailty 
prevention for ageing populations.

OBJECTIVE: To quantify the change on burden of disease from hypercholesterolemia 
in China from 1990 to 2010.
METHODS: Related data were obtained from the Global Burden of Diseases, 
Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2010 (GBD 2010). Population attributable risk 
was adopted to estimate the burden of disease from hypercholesterolemia.
RESULTS: The death and burden of disease from hypercholesterolemia for Chinese 
residents increased from 98 000 and 2.237 million disability-adjusted of life 
years (DALY) in 1990 to 281 000 and 5.912 million DALY respectively. In 2010, 
251 000 ischemic heart disease and 30 000 ischemic stroke deaths were caused by 
hypercholesterolemia, accounted for 3.4% (28.1/830.2) of the total deaths. In 
2010, the DALY of ischemic heart disease and ischemic stroke attributed to 
hypercholesterolemia was 5.169 million and 0.743 million respectively. DALY was 
3.356 million in male and 2.555 million in female. Years of life lost due to 
premature mortality (YLL) was 5.268 million, and years lived with disability 
(YLD) was 0.644 million.
CONCLUSION: Hypercholesterolemia is a major risk factor for deaths and life loss 
in 2010, and the burden of disease and death from hypercholesterolemia increased 
obviously from 1990 to 2010 in China.

[Clinical and economic benefits of the new antidiabetic drugs in the Czech 
Republic].

[Article in Czech]

Doležal T, Kruntorádová K.

GOAL: Description of efficiency, safety and cost-effectiveness of the therapy 
with new antidiabetics from the incretins group for the patients whose treatment 
with DPP4 inhibitors and GLP1 receptor agonists respectively, commenced based on 
the real data from the routine clinical practice in the Czech Republic.
METHODOLOGY: Collection of clinical data before the commencement of treatment 
and in the following 12 months. The following data was collected for all 
patients: demographic data, time elapsed from diagnosis, body weight, BMI, 
HbA1c, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, 
LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol and triglycerides. After that a 
pharmaco-economic model was analyzed which can predict long-term incidence of 
microvascular and macrovascular complications, life span and a quality-adjusted 
life-year (QALY) span of life.
RESULTS: The data of 320 patients followed for 12 months was analyzed (255 
treated with DPP4 inhibitors and 65 treated with GLP1 receptor agonists). The 
patients average age was 60.4/57.9 years and this innovative therapy was 
commenced for them after 9.1 years on average from their being diagnosed with 
diabetes. The initial glycated hemoglobin was higher (7.0%, or 7.6% HbA1c/IFCC). 
The previous therapy had been mainly based on metformin and on sulfonylurea 
derivatives. After 12 months of treatment statistically significant decreases 
were recorded in glycated hemoglobin (by 1.4% and 1.8% resp.), systolic blood 
pressure (by 4.7 mm Hg and 4.6 mm Hg resp.), diastolic blood pressure (by 1.8 mm 
Hg and 3.0 mm Hg resp.), LDL-cholesterol (by 0.3 mmol/l), triglycerides (by 0.4 
mmol/l and 0.2 mmol/l resp.), body weight (by 1.6 kg and 4.5 kg resp.) and BMI 
(by 0.5 and 1.6 resp.). The pharmacoeconomic model predicted that the 
improvement of diabetes compensation in the group of DPP4 inhibitors would lead 
in one diabetic patient to life extension by 0.36 year and by 0.31 QALY, and in 
the group of GLP1 agonists by 0.45 year and by 0.39 QALY.
CONCLUSION: The analysis has shown that the treatment based on modern 
antidiabetic medications in the conditions of the Czech Republic reduces the 
incidence of microvascular and macrovascular complications, extends the life 
span and the standard quality (QALY) life span and, due to the prevented 
complications, also reduces health insurance spending.

This article examines the literature relating to the attitudes of nurses 
currently practicing in nursing homes towards caring for gay men and lesbians in 
Ireland. Nurses' knowledge of and attitudes towards the sexuality of those in 
their care can potentially have an impact on the quality of care they deliver 
and the patient experience. There is a consensus in the literature regarding the 
expression of sexuality as a lifelong need and integral element of quality of 
life. Research to date focusing on the needs of older gay or lesbian individuals 
has been virtually non-existent, despite increases in life expectancy and 
increasing numbers of older people, and therefore older gay and lesbian people 
requiring nursing home care.

Sex Differences in Aortic Stenosis and Outcome Following Surgical and 
Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.

Aortic stenosis is the commonest valve defect in the developed world and is 
associated with a high mortality once symptomatic. There is a difference in the 
way that male and female hearts remodel in the face of chronic pressure 
overload: women develop a concentrically hypertrophied, small cavity left 
ventricle (LV), whereas men are more prone to the development of eccentric 
hypertrophy. At a cellular level, there is an increase in collagen and 
metalloproteinase gene expression in males suggesting a different regulation of 
extracellular volume composition according to sex. Male hearts with aortic 
stenosis appear to have more fibrosis than their female comparators. The trigger 
for this appears to be in part related to estrogen receptor signaling, but other 
factors such as renin-angiotensin activation, nitric oxide, and circulating 
noradrenaline levels may also be implicated. Treatment options include surgical 
valve replacement (SAVR) and more recently transcatheter aortic valve 
replacement (TAVR). Female sex may be a risk factor for adverse outcome 
following SAVR and conversely appears to confer a survival advantage when 
undergoing TAVR. Whether the lower mortality seen following TAVR in women 
compared with men (despite their increased age and frailty) reflects their 
longer life expectancy, smaller annular size (and less post-TAVR aortic 
regurgitation), more favorable LV reverse remodeling, or more likely, a 
combination of these factors remains to be established.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the feasibility,safety and follow-up results of 
multiple stents parallel placement and reconstruction technique for treating 
giant vertebrobasilar dissecting aneurysms.
METHODS: Five consecutive patients with giant fusiform vertebrobasilar 
dissecting aneurysms in Department of Neurology,Chinese People's Liberation Army 
General Hospital were retrospectively reviewed from April 2011 to October 2013. 
All patients were diagnosed vertebrobasilar dissecting aneurysms by MRI and 
digital subtraction angiography (DSA), the aneurysm size ranged 8.2-15.0 mm. All 
patients were treated by multiple stents parallel placement and reconstruction 
technique under general anesthesia. In the endovascular treatment process, 2-3 
Solitaire or Neuroform self-expandable stents were parallel implanted in the 
maximum extension segment of the aneurysms to reconstruct the cavity of the 
aneurysm and solved the problem that the diameter of the intracranial stent is 
less than the diameter of the aneurysms. Multiple stents parallel placement can 
keep the stents stable in the cavity. The parallel stent can close the 
dissection as well as strengthen the aneurysm walls to alleviate the vessel 
pulsative compression of the brain stem. Furthermore, one of the parallel stents 
was selected for the main blood flow channel. Based on the main channel, 
telescope technique was used to completely covering the dissection. It can not 
only prevent the progress of dissection to normal regions, but also be helpful 
for blood flow channel reconstruction to reduce the hemodynamic disorders. All 
Patients received routine antiplatelet therapy before and after endovascular 
treatment.
RESULTS: The operative procedures were succeeded in all patients. Five patients 
were implanted 18 stents (3 stents in 3 patients; 4 stents in 1 patient; 5 
stents in 1 patient; parallel 3 stents in 2 patients; parallel 2 stents in 3 
patients). The signs and symptoms of brain stem and posterior group of cranial 
nerves improved significantly. All patients lived and worked normally and had no 
recurrent symptoms on follow-up of 6-24 months. All patients performed DSA 
reexamination at 6-12 months postoperation. The aneurysm size lessened in 2 
patients and had no change in 3 patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Multiple stents parallel placement and reconstruction technique for 
treating giant fusiform vertebrobasilar dissecting aneurysms is feasible and 
have good operation safety. It may control the dilatation of the aneurysm and 
reduce the probability of thrombosis or hemorrhage. It can improve the patients' 
clinical symptoms and quality of life in short term follow-up. The long term 
result need for further follow-up.

The risk of developing renal cell carcinoma (RCC) increases with age, and given 
the constant gain in life expectancy of the general population, both localized 
RCC and metastatic RCC (mRCC) are more frequently observed in the elderly 
population. The elderly are a heterogeneous group of patients often 
characterized by the presence of comorbidities, different compliance to 
treatment and polypharmacy. Here we review the available data with the aim to 
analyze the safety and efficacy of new targeted therapies (TTs) in elderly mRCC 
patients. TTs seem to be effective in both older and younger patients, but 
elderly patients appear to show reduced tolerance to treatments compared to 
younger patients. Prospective trials are needed to better understand how to 
manage mRCC in elderly patients.

OBJECT: Lumbar discectomy is one of the most common surgical spine procedures. 
In order to understand the value of this surgical care, it is important to 
understand the costs to the health care system and patient for good results. The 
objective of this study was to evaluate for the first time the 
cost-effectiveness of spine surgery in Latin America for lumbar discectomy in 
terms of cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained for patients in 
Brazil.
METHODS: The authors performed a prospective cohort study involving 143 
consecutive patients who underwent open discectomy for lumbar disc herniation 
(LDH). Patient-reported outcomes were assessed utilizing the SF-6D, which is 
derived from a 12-month variation of the SF-36. Direct medical costs included 
medical reimbursement, costs of hospital care, and overall resource consumption. 
Disability losses were considered indirect costs. A 4-year horizon with 3% 
discounting was applied to health-utilities estimates. Sensitivity analysis was 
performed by varying utility gain by 20%. The costs were expressed in Reais (R$) 
and US dollars ($), applying an exchange rate of 2.4:1 (the rate at the time of 
manuscript preparation).
RESULTS: The direct and indirect costs of open lumbar discectomy were estimated 
at an average of R$3426.72 ($1427.80) and R$2027.67 ($844.86), respectively. The 
mean total cost of treatment was estimated at R$5454.40 ($2272.66) (SD R$2709.17 
[$1128.82]). The SF-6D utility gain was 0.044 (95% CI 0.03197-0.05923, p = 
0.017) at 12 months. The 4-year discounted QALY gain was 0.176928. The estimated 
cost-utility ratio was R$30,828.35 ($12,845.14) per QALY gained. The sensitivity 
analysis showed a range of R$25,690.29 ($10,714.28) to R$38,535.44 ($16,056.43) 
per QALY gained.
CONCLUSIONS: The use of open lumbar discectomy to treat LDH is associated with a 
significant improvement in patient outcomes as measured by the SF-6D. Open 
lumbar discectomy performed in the Brazilian supplementary health care system 
provides a cost-utility ratio of R$30,828.35 ($12,845.14) per QALY. The value of 
acceptable cost-effectiveness will vary by country and region.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to measure the 
cost-effectiveness of the treatment with simeprevir and sofosbuvir in chronic 
hepatitis C genotype 1 patients with F3-F4 levels of fibrosis, according to the 
results of the COSMOS trial.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A Markov model was used to estimate the costs and clinical 
outcomes from the start of therapy. In the model, the progression was simulated 
alongside the different health states of the chronic liver disease associated 
with chronic hepatitis C using whole life as time-horizon.
RESULTS: The 12-weeks treatment schemes was below the threshold of €40,000 per 
quality-adjusted life year. On the contrary, despite the 50% cost reduction, the 
24-weeks regimen demonstrated a limited level of efficiency when compared with 
the willingness to pay used in the Spanish medical literature.
CONCLUSIONS: This finding would support the introduction of a flat rate in the 
price of drugs without taking into account the duration of treatment to ensure 
that treatment with 24 weeks was efficient.

Coal tar sealcoats applied to asphalt surfaces in North America, east of the 
Continental Divide, are enriched in petroleum-derived compounds, including 
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). The release of PAHs and other chemicals 
from sealcoat has the potential to contaminate nearby water bodies, reducing the 
resiliency of aquatic communities. Despite this, relatively little is known 
about the aquatic toxicology of sealcoat-derived contaminants. We assessed the 
impacts of stormwater runoff from sealcoated asphalt on juvenile coho salmon 
(Oncorhynchus kisutch) and embryo-larval zebrafish (Danio rerio). We furthermore 
evaluated the effectiveness of bioretention as a green stormwater method to 
remove PAHs and reduce lethal and sublethal toxicity in both species. We applied 
a coal tar sealcoat to conventional asphalt and collected runoff from simulated 
rainfall events up to 7 months postapplication. Whereas sealcoat runoff was more 
acutely lethal to salmon, a spectrum of cardiovascular abnormalities was 
consistently evident in early life stage zebrafish. Soil bioretention 
effectively reduced PAH concentrations by an order of magnitude, prevented 
mortality in juvenile salmon, and significantly reduced cardiotoxicity in 
zebrafish. Our findings show that inexpensive bioretention methods can markedly 
improve stormwater quality and protect fish health.

The long circulatory half-life of albumin facilitated by the interaction with 
the cellular recycling neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) is utilized for drug 
half-life extension. FcRn engagement effects following covalent attachment of 
cargo to cysteine 34, however, have not been investigated. Poly(ethylene glycol) 
polymers were used to study the influence of cargo molecular weight on human 
FcRn engagement of recombinant wild type (WT) albumin and an albumin variant 
engineered for increased FcRn binding. Decreased affinity was observed for all 
conjugates; however, the engineered albumin maintained an affinity above that of 
unmodified wild type albumin that promotes it as an attractive drug delivery 
platform.

Bipolar Disorder: The Role of the Kynurenine and Melatonergic Pathways.

Bipolar disorder (BD) is a long-recognized severe and common psychiatric 
disorder, with a complex and often diverse range of presentations. BD is a 
heterogenous disorder that has traditionally, if rather simply, been defined by 
the recurrences of manic and depressive episodes, and presents with numerous 
immune-inflammatory and circadian/sleep abnormalities. A number of different 
lines of research have investigated the biological underpinnings of BD and 
demonstrate a heritability of about 80-90%. This genetic contribution is thought 
to be mediated by a wide array of genetic factors, rather than being strongly 
influenced by a couple of genes. In this context, a clearer formulation of the 
biological underpinnings of BD is needed in order to encompass the diverse 
effects of multiple susceptibility genes. The biological underpinnings of BD 
includes work that has focussed on the role played by increased immune 
inflammatory activity, particularly changes in pro-inflammatory cytokines, as 
measured both centrally and systemically. Changes in immune- inflammatory 
activity are intimately associated with alterations in levels of oxidative and 
nitrosative stress (O&NS), which are increased in BD. Many of the 
neuroregulatory changes driven by O&NS and immune-inflammatory activity are 
mediated by the tryptophan catabolite (TRYCAT) pathways, with changes in TRYCATs 
being evident both centrally and peripherally. A consequence of increased 
pro-inflammatory cytokines, is their induction of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 
(IDO), which takes tryptophan away from serotonin, Nacetylserotonin and 
melatonin synthesis, driving it to the synthesis of neuroregulatory TRYCATs. 
Most work exploring such changes has emphasized the role of TRYCATs in enhancing 
or decreasing neuronal activity. However, a relatively overlooked consequence of 
cytokine induced IDO and TRYCAT pathway activation is the impact that this has 
on aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) activation and in decreasing melatonergic 
pathway activity. Melatonin is classically associated with night-time synthesis 
by the pineal gland, in turn regulating circadian rhythms. However, melatonin is 
produced by many, if not all mitochondria containing cells, with consequences 
for gut regulation, as well as glia and immune cell reactivity. The melatonergic 
pathways are genetic susceptibility factors for BD. Interactive changes in O&NS, 
immune-inflammatory activity, TRYCATs and the melatonergic pathways form an 
emerging biological perspective on the etiology, course and management of BD. 
Here, we review such changes in BD, and how this better integrates the diverse 
array of BD presentations and comorbidities, including addiction and 
cardiovascular disorders as well as decreased life-expectancy. We then look at 
the future directions such research may take.

The average patient requiring vascular surgery has become older, as life 
expectancy within the US population has increased. Many older patients have some 
degree of frailty and reside near the limit of their physiological reserve with 
restricted ability to respond to stressors such as surgery. Frailty assessment 
is an important part of the preoperative decision-making process, in order to 
determine whether patients are fit enough to survive the vascular surgery 
procedure and live long enough to benefit from the intervention. In this review, 
we will discuss different measures of frailty assessment and how they can be 
used by vascular surgery providers to improve preoperative decision making and 
the quality of patient care.

Uveal melanoma (UM) is the most common primary cancer of the eye in adults and 
progresses to metastatic disease predominantly of the liver in ~50% of patients. 
In these cases, life expectancy averages just 9 months due to the lack of 
effective treatment options. The Toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5) agonist entolimod 
(former name CBLB502) rapidly activates TLR5-NF-κB signaling in hepatocytes and 
suppresses growth of both TLR5-expressing and non-expressing tumors in the liver 
through mobilization and activation of innate and adaptive immune mechanisms. 
The goal of this study was to explore the potential of entolimod as an 
immunotherapeutic agent against hepatic metastasis of UM using the TLR5-positive 
B16LS9 mouse model of ocular melanoma. Mice were given seven subcutaneous 
injections of vehicle or entolimod given 72 h apart started one day before, on 
the same day or three days after intraocular injection of B16LS9 cells. All 
tested regimens of entolimod treatment resulted in significantly reduced B16LS9 
metastasis to the liver. Entolimod induced mobilization of natural killer (NK) 
cells to the liver and stimulated their maturation, differentiation and 
activation. Antibody-mediated depletion of NK cells from mice abrogated 
entolimod's antimetastatic activity in the liver and eliminated the 
entolimod-elicited in vitro cytotoxic activity of hepatic lymphocytes against 
B16LS9 cells. These results provide pre-clinical evidence of entolimod's 
efficacy against hepatometastasis of UM and support its further development as 
an anticancer immunotherapeutic drug.

Global surgery has come of age as an emerging discipline poised to impact health 
care worldwide with a concerted plan of action and wide stakeholder support. 
Much less can be said about global pediatric surgery, despite a growing 
awareness of the global burden of pediatric surgical disease. The author 
describes his exposure to this burden of disease as a pediatric surgeon working 
in resource-limited countries in Africa and outlines his personal journey from 
recognizing the burden to measuring it and eventually attempting to address it. 
The article, based on the Hugh Greenwood International Lecture at the 2015 BAPS 
Congress, reviews what is known so far within global pediatric surgery, what is 
currently happening, and what lies ahead.

BACKGROUND: Disability weights (DWs) are used in disease burden studies, with 
the calculation of the weight of the disability as years lived with disability 
versus years of lost life accounting for mortalities. Currently, there is a 
single DW score available for poisoning, which is considered to be a single 
health state. This makes it difficult to evaluate the differing burdens of 
poisonings involving various substances/conditions in comparison with other 
health states in countries with different patterns of substance abuse. The aim 
of this study is therefore to estimate the DWs of 18 common poisonings based on 
the expert elicitation method.
METHODS: A panel of 10 medical clinicians who were familiar with the clinical 
aspects of different poisonings estimated the DWs of 50 health states by 
interpolating them on a calibrated Visual Analogue Scale. The DWs of some 
poisonings, such as alcohol, cannabis and heroin, had been estimated in previous 
studies and so were used to determine the external consistency of our panel. As 
a matter of routine, the DWs could vary on a scale between 0 (best health state) 
and 1 (worst health state).
RESULTS: Statistical analysis showed that both the internal (Cronbach's α = 
0.912) and external consistency of the panel were acceptable. The DWs for the 
different poisonings were estimated along a range from 0.830 for severe 
aluminium phosphide to 0.022 for mild benzodiazepine.
