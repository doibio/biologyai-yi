compare the cost-effectiveness of a telerehabilitation programme delivered 
remotely into patients' homes versus traditional care for total hip replacement 
patients following hospital discharge.
METHODS: A cost-effectiveness (cost-utility) analysis was conducted from the 
perspective of a health service alongside a two-arm randomised controlled trial 
comparing telerehabilitation (n=35) with in-person care (n=35) following 
hospital discharge after total hip replacement. The primary analysis used an 
Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio to compare the cost per Quality Adjusted 
Life Year (QALY) accrued in the telerehabilitation group versus in-person 
control using costs and effects data from the randomised trial. A secondary 
analysis was conducted whereby the time accrued by patients attending 
rehabilitation sessions (including travel time) was considered the "cost" (i.e. 
a time burden), rather than cost from the health service perspective.
RESULTS: Estimated mean differences in healthcare costs and QALYs gained were 
detected but were not significant. The estimated mean (95%CI) difference in cost 
of telerehabilitation versus in-person was -$28.90 (-$96.37 to $40.45), 
favouring the telerehabilitation group. The estimated mean (95%CI) difference in 
QALYs gained from telerehabilitation versus in-person was -0.0025 (-0.0227 to 
0.0217). The estimated mean (95%CI) difference in time burden favoured less time 
burden for the telerehabilitation group (-4.21 (-4.69 to -3.74) hours).
DISCUSSION: Telerehabilitation in the total hip replacement population incurred 
similar costs and yielded similar effects to traditional in-person care. 
Telerehabilitation significantly reduced the time burden for patients and 
carers. These findings are valuable for healthcare providers seeking to 
implement accessible patient-centred rehabilitation services.

Maternal investment, life histories and the evolution of brain structure in 
primates.

University, South Road, Durham DH1 3LE, UK.

Life history is a robust correlate of relative brain size: larger-brained 
mammals and birds have slower life histories and longer lifespans than 
smaller-brained species. The cognitive buffer hypothesis (CBH) proposes an 
adaptive explanation for this relationship: large brains may permit greater 
behavioural flexibility and thereby buffer the animal from unpredictable 
environmental challenges, allowing for reduced mortality and increased lifespan. 
By contrast, the developmental costs hypothesis (DCH) suggests that life-history 
correlates of brain size reflect the extension of maturational processes needed 
to accommodate the evolution of large brains, predicting correlations with 
pre-adult life-history phases. Here, we test novel predictions of the hypotheses 
in primates applied to the neocortex and cerebellum, two major brain structures 
with distinct developmental trajectories. While neocortical growth is allocated 
primarily to pre-natal development, the cerebellum exhibits relatively 
substantial post-natal growth. Consistent with the DCH, neocortical expansion is 
related primarily to extended gestation while cerebellar expansion to extended 
post-natal development, particularly the juvenile period. Contrary to the CBH, 
adult lifespan explains relatively little variance in the whole brain or 
neocortex volume once pre-adult life-history phases are accounted for. Only the 
cerebellum shows a relationship with lifespan after accounting for developmental 
periods. Our results substantiate and elaborate on the role of maternal 
investment and offspring development in brain evolution, suggest that brain 
components can evolve partly independently through modifications of distinct 
developmental phases, and imply that environmental input during post-natal 
maturation may be particularly crucial for the development of cerebellar 
function. They also suggest that relatively extended post-natal maturation times 
provide a developmental mechanism for the marked expansion of the cerebellum in 
the apes.

Introduction: The major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with cystic 
fibrosis (CF) is lung disease. Inflammation in the CF airways occurs from a 
young age and contributes significantly to disease progression and shortened 
life expectancy. Areas covered: In this review, we discuss the key immune cells 
involved in airway inflammation in CF, the contribution of the intrinsic genetic 
defect to the CF inflammatory phenotype, and anti-inflammatory strategies 
designed to overcome what is a critical factor in the pathogenesis of CF lung 
disease. Review of the literature was carried out using the MEDLINE (from 1975 
to 2018), Google Scholar and The Cochrane Library databases. Expert opinion: 
Therapeutic interventions specifically targeting the defective CF transmembrane 
conductance regulator (CFTR) protein have changed the clinical landscape and 
significantly improved the outlook for CF. As survival estimates for people with 
CF increase, long-term management has become an important focus, with an 
increased need for therapies targeted at specific elements of inflammation, to 
complement CFTR modulator therapies.

OBJECTIVE: In this study we conducted an economic evaluation of a surveillance 
programme to prevent hip dislocation in children with cerebral palsy.
METHOD: We developed a model that compared costs and health outcomes of children 
with cerebral palsy with and without a surveillance programme. Information from 
a number of sources was combined into a decision analytical model, primarily 
based on data from a comparative study with a 20-year follow-up. Effectiveness 
was measured using Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs). The analysis took the 
perspective of the Spanish National Health Service. We undertook extensive 
sensitivity analyses including a probabilistic sensitivity analysis.
RESULTS: The surveillance programme led to higher QALYs and higher health care 
costs, with an estimated incremental cost per QALY gained of 12,282€. The 
results were robust to model assumptions. The probability that the programme was 
cost-effective was estimated to be over 80% at the threshold of 25.000€/QALY 
recommended in Spain.
CONCLUSION: This study indicates that surveillance programmes to prevent hip 
dislocation in children with cerebral palsy are likely to be cost-effective.

OBJECTIVES: To estimate the economic impact of delirium in the Australian 
population in 2016-2017, including financial costs, and its burden on health.
DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A cost of illness study was conducted for the 
Australian population in the 2016-2017 financial year. The prevalence of 
delirium in 2016-2017 was calculated to inform cost estimations. The costs 
estimated in this study also include dementia attributable to delirium.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The total and per capita costs were analysed for three 
categories: health systems costs, other financial costs including productivity 
losses and informal care and cost associated with loss of well-being (burden of 
disease). Costs were expressed in 2016-2017 pound sterling (£) and Australian 
dollars ($A).
RESULTS: There were an estimated 132 595 occurrences of delirium in 2016-2017, 
and more than 900 deaths were attributed to delirium in 2016-2017. Delirium 
causes an estimated 10.6% of dementia in Australia. The total costs of delirium 
in Australia were estimated to be £4.3 billion ($A8.8 billion) in 2016-2017, 
ranging between £2.6 billion ($A5.3 billion) and £5.9 billion ($A12.1 billion). 
The total estimated costs comprised financial costs of £1.7 billion and the 
value of healthy life lost of £2.5 billion. Dementia attributable to delirium 
accounted for £2.2 billion of the total cost of delirium.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight the substantial burden that delirium 
imposes on Australian society-both in terms of financial costs associated with 
health system expenditure and the increased need for residential aged care due 
to the functional and cognitive decline associated with delirium and dementia. 
To reduce the substantial well-being costs of delirium, further research should 
seek to better understand the potential pathways from an episode of delirium to 
subsequent mortality and reduced cognitive functioning outcomes.

OBJECTIVE: Guidelines on the standard care of diabetes recommend that glycemic 
treatment goals for older adults consider the patient's complications and life 
expectancy. In this study, we examined the influence of diabetes complications 
and associated life expectancies on the cost-effectiveness (CE) of HbA1c 
treatment goals.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We used data from the 2011-2016 National Health and 
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) to generate nationally representative 
subgroups of older individuals with diabetes with various health states. We used 
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-RTI International diabetes CE 
model to estimate the long-term consequences of two treatment goals-a stringent 
control goal (HbA1c <7.5%) and a moderate control goal (HbA1c <8.5%)-on health 
and cost. Our simulation population represented typical patients, and all 
individuals in each health subgroup had average characteristics, which did not 
account for person-level variations. The CE study was conducted from a health 
system perspective and followed the study samples over a lifetime. We used 
$50,000 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) as the incremental CE threshold.
RESULTS: A stringent goal was, on average, cost-effective for individuals with 
no complications ($10,007 per QALY) or only microvascular complications 
(excluding renal failure; $19,621 per QALY), but it was not cost-effective for 
individuals with one or more macrovascular complications (all >$82,413 per 
QALY). Further, a stringent goal was not cost-effective when an individual had 
less than 7 years of life remaining.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support the guideline recommendation that glycemic 
goals for older adults should consider the complexity of their complications and 
their life expectancy from a CE perspective.

Ginger (Zingiber officinale Roscoe) in the Prevention of Ageing and Degenerative 
Diseases: Review of Current Evidence.

Currently, the age of the population is increasing as a result of increased life 
expectancy. Ageing is defined as the progressive loss of physiological 
integrity, which can be characterized by functional impairment and high 
vulnerability to various types of diseases, such as diabetes, hypertension, 
Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and atherosclerosis. 
Numerous studies have reported that the presence of oxidative stress and 
inflammation contributes to the development of these diseases. In general, 
oxidative stress could induce proinflammatory cytokines and reduce cellular 
antioxidant capacity. Increased oxidative stress levels beyond the production of 
antioxidant agents cause oxidative damage to biological molecules, including 
DNA, protein, and carbohydrates, which affects normal cell signalling, cell 
growth, differentiation, and apoptosis and leads to disease pathogenesis. Since 
oxidative stress and inflammation contribute to these diseases, ginger (Zingiber 
officinale Roscoe) is one of the potential herbs that can be used to reduce the 
level of oxidative stress and inflammation. Ginger consists of two major active 
components, 6-gingerol and 6-shogaol, which are essential for preventing 
oxidative stress and inflammation. Thus, this paper will review the effects of 
ginger on ageing and degenerative diseases, including AD, PD, type 2 diabetes 
mellitus (DM), hypertension, and osteoarthritis.

BACKGROUND: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) appears in most of cases in patients 
with advanced liver disease and is currently the primary cause of death in this 
population. Surveillance of HCC has been proposed and recommended in clinical 
guidelines to obtain earlier diagnosis, but it is still controversial and is not 
accepted worldwide.
AIM: To review the actual evidence to support the surveillance programs in 
patients with cirrhosis as well as the diagnosis procedure.
METHODS: Systematic review of recent literature of surveillance (tools, 
interval, cost-benefit, target population) and the role of imaging diagnosis 
(radiological non-invasive diagnosis, optimal modality and agents) of HCC.
RESULTS: The benefits of surveillance of HCC, mainly with ultrasonography, have 
been assessed in several prospective and retrospective analysis, although the 
percentage of patients diagnosed in surveillance programs is still low. 
Surveillance of HCC permits diagnosis in early stages allows better access to 
curative treatment and increases life expectancy in patients with cirrhosis. HCC 
is a tumor with special radiological characteristics in computed tomography and 
magnetic resonance imaging, which allows highly accurate diagnosis without 
routine biopsy confirmation. The actual recommendation is to perform biopsy only 
in indeterminate nodules.
CONCLUSION: The evidence supports the recommendation of performing surveillance 
of HCC in patients with cirrhosis susceptible of treatment, using 
ultrasonography every 6 mo. The diagnosis evaluation of HCC can be established 
based on noninvasive imaging criteria in patients with cirrhosis.

The experiences of older adults with a diagnosed functional mental illness, 
their carers and healthcare professionals in relation to mental health service 
delivery: An integrative review.

AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To analyse the experiences of older people with a diagnosed 
functional mental illness and their carers in relation to mental health service 
delivery and analyse the experiences of health and social care professionals who 
care for and treat older people who have a diagnosed functional mental illness.
BACKGROUND: The prevalence of functional mental illness in older adults is 
notable but to date has received less research attention than dementia. Older 
adults with functional mental illness have life expectancy of up to 20 years 
less than the rest of the population. Therefore, the experiences of older adults 
with functional mental illness, their carers and healthcare professionals, in 
relation to mental health services, need further exploration.
DESIGN: Integrative literature review.
METHODS: A five-stage process was informed by Whittemore and Knafl. MeSH was 
used. Keyword searches of MEDLINE, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, PsycINFO, EMBASE 
and AMED were conducted between January 2000-October 2017. Titles were screened, 
and data were extracted manually and analysed using narrative synthesis. The 
PRISMA checklist was used.
RESULTS: A total of 342 articles were deemed potentially relevant to this 
review. Once inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied, 28 articles were 
included. The literature presented an overarching theme "determinants 
influencing older people with functional mental illness use of services." The 
overarching theme is supported by two main themes: inevitable consequences of 
ageing and variations of the availability of healthcare services for older 
people with functional mental illness.
CONCLUSION: Several determinants influence use of services by older people with 
functional mental illness. Older people with functional mental illness often 
perceived they did not have a mental health need. Within the literature, there 
was little acknowledgement of the experiences of older people with functional 
mental illness regarding their support needs.
RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: This integrative review has highlighted that 
some older people with functional mental illness do not seek mental health 
support because they believe that functional mental illness is an inevitable 
consequence of ageing; this is mirrored at times by healthcare professionals and 
carers. In addition to this finding, different views prevail regarding the 
impact that ageless and age-defined mental health service delivery models have 
on the needs of older people with functional mental illness. Further research is 
required to understand these findings.

Is Antiretroviral Two-Drug Regimen the New Standard for HIV Treatment in Naive 
Patients?

The use of a combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) has changed dramatically 
the prognosis and the life expectancy of people living with HIV. The current 
treatment guidelines continue the convention of preferred cART based on 
combining a dual nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) backbone with 
a third "anchor" agent, such as a ritonavir (r)- or cobicistat (c)-boosted 
protease inhibitor (PI), a non-NRTI (NNRTI), or an integrase inhibitor (INI) 
boosted or unboosted. However, due to toxicities of NRTIs, sparing NRTI regimen 
has been studied for a long time with moderate success due to low efficacy 
(especially in patients with high viral load and low CD4) compare to standard 
triple therapy. New strategy with lamivudine (3TC) plus a boosted PI or INI 
showed promise results and indicated that modern two-drug regimens might now, in 
fact, become a reliable treatment for HIV-infected naïve patients. This article 
discusses recent data from dual therapy studies in naïve HIV-infected patients 
and the challenges behind this strategy.

The Cost-effectiveness of Initial Immunomodulators or Infliximab Using Modern 
Optimization Strategies for Crohn's Disease in the Biosimilar Era.

BACKGROUND: Treatment cost, efficacy, and safety are integral considerations 
when optimizing management of Crohn's disease (CD). This study assessed the 
cost-effectiveness of initial immunomodulator and anti-tumor necrosis factor 
(anti-TNF) agents for the treatment of CD from a US third-party perspective, 
incorporating current treatment algorithms, optimization strategies, and reduced 
costs availed by biosimilars.
METHOD: A 1-year Markov model was developed to simulate the cost and 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) of initial azathioprine, infliximab, and 
combination therapy for moderate to severe CD. Treatment was changed based on 
tolerability and clinical disease activity at 3-monthly intervals. Efficacy data 
were based on published literature.
RESULTS: Initial azathioprine had the lowest cost and utility ($35,337 and 0.63 
QALYs), whereas combination therapy was the costliest yet conferred the highest 
health benefits ($57,638 and 0.67 QALYs). The incremental cost-effectiveness of 
infliximab and combination therapy compared with azathioprine were both in 
excess of $500,000 per QALY gained. Initial azathioprine remained the most 
cost-effective treatment on sensitivity analysis compared with infliximab and 
combination therapy, with 90% reductions in anti-TNF therapy costs and a 5-year 
time horizon, although combination therapy had an acceptable cost-effectiveness 
when costs were reduced in the extended model. Initial infliximab, ustekinumab, 
and vedolizumab were dominated by combination therapy.
CONCLUSIONS: In the biosimilar era, initial azathioprine with escalation to 
infliximab appeared more cost-effective in the short term compared with 
infliximab or combination therapy, although initial combination therapy yields 
acceptable ICERs in the long term with continued reductions in anti-TNF therapy 
costs and will likely be the preferred treatment strategy in the future.

OBJECTIVES: Widespread access to antiretroviral therapy (ART) has substantially 
increased life expectancy in sub-Saharan African countries. As a result, the 
rates of comorbidities and use of co-medications among people living with HIV 
are increasing, necessitating a sound understanding of drug-drug interactions 
(DDIs). We aimed to assess the prevalence and management of DDIs with ART in a 
rural Tanzanian setting.
METHODS: We included consenting HIV-positive adults initiating ART in the 
Kilombero and Ulanga Antiretroviral Cohort (KIULARCO) between January 2013 and 
December 2016. DDIs were classified using www.hiv-druginteractions.org as red 
(contra-indicated), amber (potential clinical relevance requiring dosage 
adjustment/monitoring), yellow (weak clinical significance unlikely to require 
further management) or green (no interaction). We assessed management of amber 
DDIs by evaluating monitoring of laboratory or clinical parameters, or changes 
in drug dosages.
RESULTS: Of 2069 participants, 1945 (94%) were prescribed at least one 
co-medication during a median follow-up of 1.8 years. Of these, 645 (33%) had at 
least one potentially clinically relevant DDI, with the highest grade being red 
in nine (< 1%) and amber in 636 (33%) participants. Of the 23 283 prescriptions, 
19 (< 1%) and 1745 (7%) were classified as red and amber DDIs, respectively. 
Overall, 351 (2%) prescriptions were red DDIs or not appropriately managed amber 
DDIs.
CONCLUSIONS: Co-medication use was common in this rural sub-Saharan cohort. A 
third of participants had DDIs requiring further management. Of the 9% of 
participants with not appropriately managed DDIs, most were with cardiovascular 
and analgesic drugs. This highlights the importance of physicians' awareness of 
DDIs for their recognition and management.

BACKGROUND: The world is facing many socio-demographic changes, such as an 
increased average life expectancy and the presence of chronic and 
non-communicable diseases, which in turn, leads to an enhanced dependency on 
others. Consequently, the demand for informal caregivers has significantly 
increased during the past few years. Caring for a dependent person is linked to 
a series of burdens that often leads to physical, psychological and emotional 
difficulties. Taking into consideration the difficulties faced by informal 
caregivers, knowing in which areas of functioning they need more guidance may 
help to relieve their burden. Therefore, the main goal of this study is to 
better understand the needs and competencies of the informal caregiver when 
caring for a dependent person in the different self-care domains.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study used a questionnaire administered on a 
single occasion by face-to-face interview. Descriptive and inferential 
statistics alongside non-parametric statistical techniques such as the 
Mann-Whitney test and Spearman's correlation were used.
RESULTS: The average age of the 143 informal caregivers is 58 years old, with 
the youngest in our sample being 21 years of age. Most of them are female, and 
50% of them are children taking care of one of their parents. Most of the 
dependent people are completely dependent in the areas of comfort and hygiene 
(53.8%) and medication management (55.9%). The female informal caregivers see 
themselves as having more competencies in sanitary hygiene than the male ones, 
with no significant differences in their competencies' perception in the other 
areas of self-care. Older caregivers see themselves as less competent in certain 
areas of self-care such as feeding, mobility, transfers, medication and symptoms 
management and communication. Most of the information given to the informal 
caregiver is about the disease (82.3%) and the medication management (80.4%). 
There are still a lot of areas of self-care, where no information, or almost 
none, is given to the informal caregivers.
CONCLUSIONS: Before home discharge of a dependent person, it is important to 
acknowledge the needs and competencies of the informal caregiver, to capacitate 
them in looking after their relatives, to help decrease their burden and 
consequently, decrease the number of hospital readmissions.

AIM: There is now a strong body of literature showing that bullying 
victimisation during childhood and adolescence precedes the later development of 
anxiety and depressive disorders. This study aimed to quantify the burden of 
anxiety and depressive disorders attributable to experiences of bullying 
victimisation for the Australian population.
METHODS: This study updated a previous systematic review summarising the 
longitudinal association between bullying victimisation and anxiety and 
depressive disorders. Estimates from eligible studies published from inception 
until 18 August 2018 were included and meta-analyses were based on 
quality-effects models. Pooled relative risks were combined with a contemporary 
prevalence estimate for bullying victimisation for Australia in order to 
calculate population attributable fractions (PAFs) for the two mental disorder 
outcomes. PAFs were then applied to estimates of the burden of anxiety and 
depressive disorders in Australia expressed as disability-adjusted life years 
(DALYs).
RESULTS: The findings from this study suggest 7.8% of the burden of anxiety 
disorders and 10.8% of the burden of depressive disorders are attributable to 
bullying victimisation in Australia. An estimated 30 656 DALYs or 0.52% (95% 
uncertainty interval 0.33-0.72%) of all DALYs in both sexes and all ages in 
Australia were attributable to experiences of bullying victimisation in 
childhood or adolescence.
CONCLUSION: There is convincing evidence to demonstrate a causal relationship 
between bullying victimisation and mental disorders. This study showed that 
bullying victimisation contributes a significant proportion of the burden of 
anxiety and depressive disorders. The investment and implementation of 
evidence-based intervention programmes that reduce bullying victimisation in 
schools could reduce the burden of disease arising from common mental disorders 
and improve the health of Australians.

The alfalfa weevil (Hypera postica) is a well-known example of a 
worldwide-distributed pest with high genetic variation. Based on the 
mitochondrial genes, the alfalfa weevil clusters into two main mitochondrial 
lineages. However, there is no clear picture of the global diversity and 
distribution of these lineages; neither the drivers of its diversification are 
known. However, it appears likely that historic demographic events including 
founder effects played a role. In addition, Wolbachia, a widespread 
intracellular parasite/symbiont, likely played an important role in the 
evolution of the species. Wolbachia infection so far was only detected in the 
Western lineage of H. postica with no information on the infecting strain, its 
frequency, and its consequences on the genetic diversity of the host. We here 
used a combination of mitochondrial and nuclear sequences of the host and 
sequence information on Wolbachia to document the distribution of strains and 
the degree of infection. The Eastern lineage has a higher genetic diversity and 
is found in the Mediterranean, the Middle East, Eastern Europe, and eastern 
America, whereas the less diverse Western lineage is found in Central Europe and 
the western America. Both lineages are infected with the same common strain of 
Wolbachia belonging to Supergroup B. Based on neutrality tests, selection tests, 
and the current distribution and diversification of Wolbachia in H. postica, we 
suggested the Wolbachia infection did not shape genetic diversity of the host. 
The introduced populations in the United States are generally genetically less 
diverse, which is in line with founder effects.

OBJECTIVE: To estimate survival in Swedish and Norwegian myelofibrosis (MF) 
patients who received ruxolitinib.
METHODS: Swedish and Norwegian patients with MF diagnosis in the National Cancer 
Registries (Sweden: 2001-2015; Norway: 2002-2016) and ≥1 record of ruxolitinib 
in the Prescribed Drug Registries (2013-2017) were included. Patients were 
followed from ruxolitinib initiation until death or end of follow-up; those who 
discontinued ruxolitinib were followed from ruxolitinib discontinuation. 
Relative survival (RS) and excess mortality rate ratios (EMRRs) were calculated 
vs a matched general population. Average loss in life expectancy (LEL) was 
predicted using flexible parametric models.
RESULTS: Among patients who initiated ruxolitinib (n = 190), 1- and 4-year RS 
were 0.80 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.74, 0.86) and 0.52 (95% CI: 0.42, 
0.64), respectively, and LEL was 11 years. EMRR was greater in patients aged >70 
vs <60 years (3.16; 95% CI: 1.34-7.40). Among patients who discontinued 
ruxolitinib (n = 71), median RS was 16.0 months (95% CI: 6.3, NE), and LEL was 
12 years. After ruxolitinib treatment discontinuation, Swedish patients (n = 37) 
received glucocorticoids, hydroxyurea, busulfan, danazol and lenalidomide.
CONCLUSION: Swedish and Norwegian MF patients who discontinued ruxolitinib had 
dismal survival outcomes and limited subsequent treatment options, highlighting 
the need for improved therapies.

AIM: To understand whether the science to date has focused on single or multiple 
chest compression components and identify the evidence related to chest 
compression components to determine the need for a full systematic review.
METHODS: This review was undertaken by members of the International Liaison 
Committee on Resuscitation and guided by a specific methodological framework and 
the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension 
for scoping reviews (PRISMA-ScR). Studies were eligible for inclusion if they 
were peer-reviewed human studies that examined the effect of different chest 
compression depths or rates, or chest wall or leaning, on physiological or 
clinical outcomes. The databases searched were MEDLINE complete, Embase, and 
Cochrane.
RESULTS: Twenty-two clinical studies were included in this review: five 
observational studies involving 879 patients examined both chest compression 
rate and depth; eight studies involving 14,285 patients examined chest 
compression rate only; seven studies involving 12001 patients examined chest 
compression depth only, and two studies involving 1848 patients examined chest 
wall recoil. No studies were identified that examined chest wall leaning. Three 
studies reported an inverse relationship between chest compression rate and 
depth.
CONCLUSION: This scoping review did not identify sufficient new evidence that 
would justify conducting new systematic reviews or reconsideration of current 
resuscitation guidelines. This scoping review does highlight significant gaps in 
the research evidence related to chest compression components, namely a lack of 
high-level evidence, paucity of studies of in-hospital cardiac arrest, and 
failure to account for the possibility of interactions between chest compression 
components.

Changing educational gradient in long-term care-free life expectancy among 
German men, 1997-2012.

BACKGROUND: The inverse association between mortality and individual 
socioeconomic status is well-documented. Due to the lack of appropriate data, 
little is known about the nature of this association among individuals with 
long-term care (LTC) needs.
OBJECTIVES: We aim to fill in this knowledge gap by estimating life expectancy 
(LE), life expectancy without (CFLE) and with (CLE) long-term care by education 
for older German men; and by assessing the trends in the education-LE/CFLE/CLE 
gradient over time.
DATA AND METHODS: We apply survival analysis and Gompertz regression to German 
Socioeconomic Panel data (1997-2012) to estimate the mortality levels and to 
construct the life tables for three educational categories. Using the 
administrative data from the health insurance, we adjust mortality rates upward 
to account for the institutionalized population. We estimate age-specific LTC 
prevalence from the German Microcensus data (2004, 2012) and compute life 
expectancy with and without LTC by employing Sullivan's method. Slope and 
Relative Indices of Inequality are computed to evaluate the magnitude of 
educational inequalities in CFLE.
RESULTS: There is a clear and growing educational gradient in LE and CFLE among 
older men in Germany. In 2004, LE at age 65 among men with low education was 
14.2 years, or 3.3 years lower than among highly educated individuals. The CFLE 
of these two educational categories ranged from 13.6 to almost 17 years. The 
gradient increased over time and in 2012 the difference constituted 4.6 years. 
The gaps between educational groups were not pronounced for CLE. The declining 
health ratio of years without LTC to remaining LE suggests the expansion of LTC 
needs, irrespective of the educational level.
CONCLUSIONS: Growing inequalities by educational status among older German men 
with care needs demand the attention of policy-makers. Prompt actions are needed 
to increase the survival chances of the most vulnerable groups.

Healthy life expectancy (HALE) varies substantially among countries, regions, 
and race/ethnicities. Utilizing the Sullivan method, this article examines HALE 
for Native Hawaiian, White, Filipino, Japanese, and Chinese Americans living in 
Hawai'i, the United States. HALE varies by sex and race/ethnicity. The HALE at 
birth in 2010 for females was 78.3, 77.8, 74.2, 73.7, and 62.6 years in contrast 
to life expectancy of 90, 88, 88.1, 83.4, and 79.4 for Chinese, Japanese, 
Filipino Americans, White, and Native Hawaiians, respectively. In the same 
order, HALE at birth for males was 73.0, 71.6, 72.3 70.7, and 60.7 years, 
compared with life expectancy of 85.3, 81.2, 80.8, 78.3, and 73.9. The gaps in 
HALE between Native Hawaiians and the longest living Chinese Americans were 15.7 
years for females and 12.3 years for males. Our results highlight sex and 
racial/ethnic disparities in HALE, which can inform program and policy 
development.
