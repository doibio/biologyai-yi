BACKGROUND: Telephone therapist delivered CBT (TCBT) and web-based CBT (WCBT) 
have been shown to be significantly more clinically effective than treatment as 
usual (TAU) at reducing IBS symptom severity and impact at 12 months in adults 
with refractory IBS. In this paper we assess the cost-effectiveness of the 
interventions.
METHODS: Participants were recruited from 74 general practices and three 
gastroenterology centres in England. Interventions costs were calculated, and 
other service use and lost employment measured and costed for one-year post 
randomisation. Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were combined with costs to 
determine cost-effectiveness of TCBT and WCBT compared to TAU.
RESULTS: TCBT cost £956 more than TAU (95% CI, £601-£1435) and generated 0.0429 
more QALYs. WCBT cost £224 more than TAU (95% CI, - £11 to £448) and produced 
0.029 more QALYs. Compared to TAU, TCBT had an incremental cost per QALY of 
£22,284 while the figure for WCBT was £7724. After multiple imputation these 
ratios increased to £27,436 and £17,388 respectively. Including lost employment 
and informal care, TCBT had costs that were on average £866 lower than TAU (95% 
CI, - £1133 to £2957), and WCBT had costs that were £1028 lower than TAU (95% 
CI, - £448 to £2580).
CONCLUSIONS: TCBT and WCBT resulted in more QALYs and higher costs than TAU. 
Complete case analysis suggests both therapies are cost-effective from a 
healthcare perspective. Imputation for missing data reduces cost-effectiveness 
but WCTB remained cost-effective. If the reduced societal costs are included 
both interventions are likely to be more cost-effective. Trial registration

BACKGROUND: Adherence to a healthy lifestyle could reduce the cancer mortality 
in the western population. We conducted a city-wide prospective study in China 
investigating the association of a healthy lifestyle score with all-cause 
mortality and the life expectancy in cancer survivors.
METHODS: This prospective cohort study included 46,120 surviving patients who 
were firstly diagnosed with cancer in Guangzhou. Five low-risk lifestyle factors 
including never smoking, never alcohol use, regular physical activity (≥ 2 
h/week), sufficient sleep (≥ 6 h/day), and normal or high BMI (≥ 18.5 kg/m2) 
were assessed and a lifestyle score (0-5, a higher score indicates healthier 
lifestyle) was generated. Hazard ratios (HRs) of all-cause mortality and the 
life expectancy by levels of the lifestyle scores were estimated.
RESULTS: Of 46,120 cancer survivors registered from 2010 to 2017, during an 
average follow-up of 4.3 years (200,285 person-years), 15,209 deaths were 
recorded. Adjusted HRs for mortality in cancer survivors with lifestyle score of 
0-2, versus 5, were 2.59 (95% confidence interval (CI): 2.03-3.30) in women, 
1.91 (95%CI 1.77-2.05) in men, 2.28 (95%CI 2.03-2.55) in those aged <65 years, 
and 1.90 (95%CI 1.75, 2.05) in those aged ≥ 65 years. Life expectancy at age 55 
for those with a score of 0-2 and 5 was 53.4 and 57.1 months, respectively. We 
also found that cancer survivors with healthy lifestyle scores of 5 showed 59.9 
months of life expectancy on average, which was longer than those with a score 
of 0-2.
CONCLUSION: Adopting a healthy lifestyle was associated with a substantially 
lower risk of all-cause mortality and longer life expectancy in cancer 
survivors. Our findings should be useful for health education and health 
promotion in primary care and clinical practice.

BACKGROUND: Rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata (RCDP) is an inherited 
ultra-rare disease which results in severely impaired physical and mental 
development. Mutations in one of five genes involved in plasmalogen biosynthesis 
have been reported to drive disease pathology. Estimates of disease incidence 
have been extremely challenging due to the rarity of the disorder, preventing an 
understanding of the unmet medical need. To address this, we have prepared a 
disease incidence and prevalence model based on genetic epidemiology approaches 
to estimate the total number of RCDP patients affected, and their demographic 
characteristics.
RESULTS: Extraction of allelic frequencies for known and predicted pathogenic 
variants in PEX7, GNPAT, AGPS, FAR1, PEX5 (limited to the PTS2 domain encoding 
region) genes, from large-scale human genetic diversity datasets (TopMed and 
gnomAD) revealed the mutational landscape contributing to the RCDP patient 
population in the US and Europe. We computed genetic prevalence to derive birth 
incidence for RCDP and modeled the impact to life expectancy to obtain high 
confidence estimates of disease prevalence. Our population genetics-based model 
indicates PEX7 variants are expected to contribute to the majority of RCDP cases 
in both the US and Europe; closely aligning with clinical reports. Furthermore, 
this model provides estimates for RCDP subtypes due to mutations in other genes, 
including exceedingly rare subtypes.
CONCLUSION: In total, the estimated number of RCDP patients in the US and the 
five largest European countries (UK, Germany, France, Italy and Spain) is 
between 516 and 847 patients, all under the age of 35 years old. This model 
provides a quantitative framework for better understanding the unmet medical 
need in RCDP, to help guide disease awareness and diagnosis efforts for this 
specific patient group.

BACKGROUND: Epigenetic regulation of the gene expression results from 
interaction between the external environment and transcription of the genetic 
information encoded in DNA. Methylated CpG regions within the gene promoters 
lead to silencing of the gene expression in most cases. Factors contributing to 
epigenetic regulation include intestinal microbiota, which in chicken can be 
potently modified by in ovo stimulation. The main aim of this study was to 
determine global and specific methylation patterns of the spleen under the 
influence of host-microbiome interaction.
RESULTS: Fertilized eggs of two genotypes: Ross 308 and Green-legged 
Partridgelike were in ovo stimulated on d 12 of incubation. The injected 
compounds were as follows: probiotic - Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris 
IBB477, prebiotic - galactooligosaccharides, and synbiotic - combination of 
both. Chickens were sacrificed on d 42 post-hatching. Spleen was collected, RNA 
and DNA were isolated and intended to gene expression, gene methylation and 
global methylation analysis. We have proved that negative regulation of gene 
expression after administration of bioactive substances in ovo might have 
epigenetic character. Epigenetic changes depend on the genotype and the 
substance administered in ovo.
CONCLUSION: Epigenetic nature of microbial reprogramming in poultry and 
extension of issues related to host-microbiome interaction is a new direction of 
this research.

BACKGROUND: Many women experience fear of childbirth (FOC). While fears about 
childbirth may be normal during pregnancy, some women experience high 
to severe FOC. At the extreme end of the fear spectrum is tocophobia, which is 
considered a specific condition that may cause distress, affect well-being 
during pregnancy and impede the transition to parenthood. Various interventions 
have been trialled, which support women to reduce and manage high to severe FOC, 
including tocophobia.
OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effectiveness of non-pharmacological 
interventions for reducing fear of childbirth (FOC) compared with standard 
maternity care in pregnant women with high to severe FOC, including tocophobia.
SEARCH METHODS: In July 2020, we searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth's 
Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov, the World Health Organization (WHO) 
International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), and reference lists of 
retrieved studies. We contacted researchers of trials which were registered and 
appeared to be ongoing.
SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised clinical trials which recruited 
pregnant women with high or severe FOC (as defined by the individual trial), for 
treatment intended to reduce FOC. Two review authors independently screened and 
selected titles and abstracts for inclusion. We excluded quasi-randomised and 
cross-over trials.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard methodological approaches as 
recommended by Cochrane. Two review authors independently extracted data and 
assessed the studies for risk of bias. A third review author checked the data 
analysis for accuracy. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. 
The primary outcome was a reduction in FOC. Secondary outcomes were caesarean 
section, depression, birth preference for caesarean section or spontaneous 
vaginal delivery, and epidural use.
MAIN RESULTS: We included seven trials with a total of 1357 participants. The 
interventions included psychoeducation, cognitive behavioural therapy, group 
discussion, peer education and art therapy. We judged four studies as high or 
unclear risk of bias in terms of allocation concealment; we judged three studies 
as high risk in terms of incomplete outcome data; and in all studies, there was 
a high risk of bias due to lack of blinding. We downgraded the certainty of the 
evidence due to concerns about risk of bias, imprecision and inconsistency. None 
of the studies reported data about women's anxiety. Participating in 
non-pharmacological interventions may reduce levels of fear of childbirth, as 
measured by the Wijma Delivery Expectancy Questionnaire (W-DEQ), but the 
reduction may not be clinically meaningful (mean difference (MD) -7.08, 95% 
confidence interval (CI) -12.19 to -1.97; 7 studies, 828 women; low-certainty 
evidence). The W-DEQ tool is scored from 0 to 165 (higher score = greater fear). 
Non-pharmacological interventions probably reduce the number of women having a 
caesarean section (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.89; 5 studies, 557 women; 
moderate-certainty evidence). There may be little to no difference between 
non-pharmacological interventions and usual care in depression scores measured 
with the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) (MD 0.09, 95% CI -1.23 to 
1.40; 2 studies, 399 women; low-certainty evidence). The EPDS tool is scored 
from 0 to 30 (higher score = greater depression). Non-pharmacological 
interventions probably lead to fewer women preferring a caesarean section 
(RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.89; 3 studies, 276 women; moderate-certainty 
evidence).  Non-pharmacological interventions may increase epidural use compared 
with usual care, but the 95% CI includes the possibility of a slight reduction 
in epidural use (RR 1.21, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.48; 2 studies, 380 women; 
low-certainty evidence).
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The effect of non-pharmacological interventions for women 
with high to severe fear of childbirth in terms of reducing fear is 
uncertain. Fear of childbirth, as measured by W-DEQ, may be reduced but it is 
not certain if this represents a meaningful clinical reduction of fear. There 
may be little or no difference in depression, but there may be a reduction in 
caesarean section delivery. Future trials should recruit adequate numbers of 
women and measure birth satisfaction and anxiety.

BACKGROUND: The population health impact of loneliness remains unknown. We 
quantified the impact of loneliness on total life expectancy (TLE) and health 
expectancy (the duration of remaining life lived in different health states) 
among older adults, aged ≥60 years.
DESIGN: Multistate life table analysis of a nationally representative 
longitudinal survey.
SETTING: Singapore.
PARTICIPANTS: Survey participants (n = 3449) interviewed in 2009, 2011-12, and 
2015.
MEASUREMENTS: Health states were defined using self-rated health (SRH) status 
and activity of daily living (ADL)/instrumental ADL (IADL) status. Participants 
with somewhat or very unhealthy SRH were considered as unhealthy. Those 
reporting health-related difficulty with any ADL/IADL were considered to have 
limitation in ADLs/IADLs. TLE and health expectancy (healthy and unhealthy life 
expectancy (HLE and UHLE) in the context of SRH, and active and inactive life 
expectancy (ALE and IALE) in the context of ADLs/IADLs) were estimated using the 
multistate life table method with a microsimulation approach, considering 
loneliness as time varying.
RESULTS: At age 60, 70, and 80, those sometimes lonely or mostly lonely 
generally had shorter TLE, HLE and ALE, similar UHLE and IALE, and a higher 
proportion of remaining life with unhealthy SRH or with ADL/IADL limitations 
versus those never lonely. For example, at the age of 60, those sometimes lonely 
versus never lonely had shorter TLE (by 5.4 [95% Confidence Interval: 3.4-7.9] 
years), shorter HLE (by 5.9 [4.1-8.6] years), similar UHLE (difference: 0.6 
[-0.7-1.7] years), and higher proportion of remaining life with unhealthy SRH 
(by 6.2 [1.2-10.8] percentage points). For those mostly lonely versus never 
lonely, TLE was shorter by 3.6 (0.7-6.6) years, HLE was shorter by 4.8 (2.3-8.2) 
years, UHLE was similar (difference: 1.2 [-0.1-4.0] years), and proportion of 
remaining life with unhealthy SRH was higher by 7.2 (2.1-18.1) percentage 
points.
CONCLUSION: Identification and management of loneliness may increase years of 
life with healthy SRH and without limitation in ADLs/IADLs among older adults.

AIMS: Recent evidence points towards a distinct obese phenotype among patients 
with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). We aimed to 
identify differentially expressed circulating biomarkers in obese HFpEF patients 
and link them to disease severity and outcomes.
METHODS AND RESULTS: From the LIFE-Heart study, 999 patients with HFpEF and 999 
patients without heart failure (no-HF) were selected and 92 circulating serum 
biomarkers were measured using a proximity extension assay. Elevation of 
identified biomarkers was validated in 220 patients from the Aldo-DHF trial with 
diagnosed HFpEF. HFpEF patients were older and had more comorbidities including 
coronary artery disease and type 2 diabetes as compared to no-HF patients 
(P < 0.05 for all). After adjusting for covariates, adrenomedullin (ADM), 
galectin-9 (Gal-9), thrombospondin-2 (THBS-2), CD4, and tumour necrosis 
factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand receptor 2 (TRAIL-R2) were 
significantly higher in obese HFpEF patients [body mass index (BMI) ≥30 kg/m2 , 
n = 464] as compared to lean HFpEF (BMI <30 kg/m2 , n = 535) and obese no-HF 
patients (BMI ≥30 kg/m2 , n = 387) (P < 0.001 for both); these findings were 
verified in the Aldo-DHF validation cohort (P < 0.001). Except for CD4 these 
proteins were associated with increased estimates of left atrial pressure in a 
linear fashion. Importantly, ADM and CD4 were associated with increased 
mortality in obese HFpEF patients after adjusting for covariates.
CONCLUSION: Obese HFpEF patients exhibit higher circulating biomarkers of volume 
expansion (ADM), myocardial fibrosis (THBS-2) and systemic inflammation (Gal-9, 
CD4) compared to obese non-HFpEF or lean HFpEF patients. These findings support 
the clinical definition of a distinct obese HFpEF phenotype and might merit 
further investigation.

BACKGROUND: The InfAct (Information for Action) project is a European Commission 
Joint Action on Health Information which has promoted the potential role of 
burden of disease (BoD) approaches to improve the current European Union-Health 
Information System (EU-HIS). It has done so by raising awareness of the concept, 
the methods used to calculate estimates and their potential implications and 
uses in policymaking. The BoD approach is a systematic and scientific effort to 
quantify and compare the magnitude of health loss due to different diseases, 
injuries, and risk factors with estimates produced by demographic 
characteristics and geographies for specific points in time. Not all countries 
have the resources to undertake such work, and may therefore start with a more 
restricted objective, e.g., a limited number of diseases, or the use of simple 
measures of population health such as disease prevalence or life expectancy. The 
main objective to develop these recommendations was to facilitate those 
countries planning to start a national burden of disease study.
RESULTS: These recommendations could be considered as minimum requirements for 
those countries planning to start a BoD study and includes following elements: 
(1) Define the objectives of a burden of disease study within the context of 
your country, (2) Identify, communicate and secure the benefits of performing 
national burden of disease studies, (3) Secure access to the minimum required 
data sources, (4) Ensure the minimum required capacity and capability is 
available to carry out burden of disease study, (5) Establish a clear governance 
structure for the burden of disease study and stakeholder 
engagement/involvement, (6) Choose the appropriate methodological approaches and 
(7) Knowledge translation. These were guided by the results from our survey 
performed to identify the needs of European countries for BoD studies, a 
narrative overview from four European countries (Belgium, Germany, The 
Netherlands and Scotland) and the summary of a comparative study of country 
health profiles with national health statistics.
CONCLUSIONS: These recommendations as minimum requirements would facilitate 
efforts by those European countries who intend to perform national BoD studies.

Life expectancy in the developed West is currently stagnated and remains shorter 
in men than women. Well-established evolutionary biology theory suggests 
lifespan trades-off against reproductive success, possibly sex-specifically. We 
examined whether a key driver of reproductive success, testosterone, affected 
survival using a Mendelian randomization longevity study in the UK Biobank to 
obtain unbiased estimates, along with control exposures. We applied published 
genetic instruments for testosterone to obtain inverse variance weighted 
estimates of associations with survival to (i.e., age at) recruitment, in 
167,020 men and 194,174 women. We similarly obtained estimates for a positive 
control (smoking initiation), and a negative control (absorbate), a marker of 
vitamin C metabolism. Testosterone was associated with poorer survival 
(0.10 years younger at recruitment per effect size of testosterone, 95% 
confidence interval (CI) 0.004 to 0.20). As expected, smoking initiation was 
also associated with poorer survival (0.37 years younger, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.50), 
but not absorbate (0.01 years younger, 95% CI - 0.09 to 0.11). Several aspects 
of a healthy lifestyle (low animal fat diet) and several widely used medications 
(statins, metformin, dexamethasone and possibly aspirin) may modulate 
testosterone. Explicitly designing interventions sex-specifically based on these 
insights might help address stagnating life expectancy and sexual disparities.

Antiretroviral treatment (ART) and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for 
HIV-serodiscordant couples, effectively reduce mortality, transmission events 
and influence quality of life at the expense of increased costs. We aimed to 
evaluate health economics of antiretroviral-based strategies for 
HIV-serodiscordant couples in the China context. A deterministic model of HIV 
evolution and transmission within a cohort of serodiscordant couples was 
parameterized using the real-world database of Zhoukou city and published 
literature. We evaluated the mid-ART (a historical strategy, initiating ART with 
CD4 < 500 cells/mm3), early-ART (the current strategy, offering ART regardless 
of CD4 cell counts) and a hypothetical strategy (early-ART combined short-term 
daily PrEP) versus the late-ART (the baseline strategy, initiating ART with 
CD4 < 350 cells/mm3) offered by 2008 national guidelines. We estimated the 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) and incremental cost-utility ratios 
(ICUR) from a societal perspective, derived by clinical benefits and HIV-caused 
life quality respectively, and portrayed their changes over a 0-30 year's 
timeframe. The model projections indicated that the antiretroviral-based 
interventions were more likely to obtain clinical benefits but difficult to 
improve quality of life, and cumulative ICER and ICUR were generally decreasing 
without achieving cost-saving. Scale-up access to ART for the HIV-positive among 
serodiscordant couples was easily fallen within the range of paying for 
incremental life-years and quality adjusted life years by the societal 
willingness. The hypothetical strategy had the potential to prevent most 
seroconversion events within marriages but required enormous upfront costs, thus 
it took a long time to reach established thresholds. The current strategy of 
early-ART is the most cost-effective. Clarifying the obstacles of high cost of 
PrEP and improving life quality for HIV-serodiscordant couples have emerged as 
an urgent requisition.

Ataxia telangiectasia (A-T) is a rare autosomal recessive disease caused by 
mutations in the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) gene. In the absence of a 
family history, the diagnosis of A-T is usually not made until the child is 
older and symptomatic. Classic A-T is characterized by a constellation of 
clinical symptoms including progressive ataxia, oculocutaneous telangiectasias 
and sinopulmonary disease and is usually associated with absence of ATM protein. 
Other laboratory features associated with A-T include elevated serum levels of 
alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and increased chromosomal breakage with in vitro 
exposure to ionizing radiation. Sinopulmonary symptoms can occur to varying 
degrees across the lifespan. Some children will also have hypogammaglobulinemia 
and impaired antibody responses requiring supplemental gamma globulin. People 
with hypomorphic ATM mutations are often considered to have mild A-T with onset 
of ataxia and neurological progression occurring later in life with less 
impairment of the immune system. The risk of malignancy, however, is 
significantly increased in people with either classic or mild A-T. While 
hematological malignancies are most common in the first two decades of life, 
solid organ malignancies become increasingly common during young adulthood. 
Deterioration of neurologic function with age is associated with dysphagia with 
aspiration, growth faltering, loss of ambulation and decline in pulmonary 
function, morbidities that contribute to shortened life expectancy and decreased 
quality of life. Premature death is often due to malignancies or chronic 
respiratory insufficiency. A-T is currently managed with supportive care and 
symptomatic treatment. Current clinical trials, however, represent progress and 
hope towards disease-modifying therapies for A-T.

PURPOSE: We aimed to investigate which changes in the explanatory factors that 
were associated with positive change in the work ability score (WAS) and degree 
of work participation (DWP) for participants in a new 1-year vocational 
rehabilitation (VR) program for people on or at risk of sick leave due to 
obesity or obesity-related problems.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: This prospective observational study included 95 
participants with a body mass index (BMI) above 30 kg/m2. The 1-year 
multidisciplinary VR program with an integrated work and lifestyle intervention 
included 4 weeks of inpatient stay followed-up by five meetings. Differences 
between baseline and 12-month follow-up data were analyzed for the change in 
explanatory variables WAS, DWP, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), BMI, and 
return-to-work self-efficacy (RTWSE). The primary outcome was measured by 
multiple linear regression for predicting WAS and DWP.
RESULTS: We found significant changes in WAS (1.51, 95% CI: 0.83 to 2.20, 
p<0.001), DWP (18.69, 95% CI: 8.35 to 29.02, p<0.001), HRQoL (2.57, 95% CI: 1.35 
to 3.79, p<0.001), BMI (-2.33, 95% CI: -3.10 to -1.56, p<0.001), and in RTWSE 
(15.89, 95% CI: 4.07 to 27.71, p = 0.009). Regression analysis yielded a strong 
association between WAS at 12-month follow-up with an increase in HRQoL (β=0.27, 
95% CI: 0.16 to 0.38, p<0.001) and WAS baseline (β=0.49, 95% CI: 0.28 to 0.71, 
p<0.001). Further, regression analysis demonstrated a strong association between 
DWP at 12-month follow-up with return-to-work expectancy (RTWEXP) (β=-10.62, 95% 
CI: -15.25 to -6.03, p<0.001).
CONCLUSION: The results indicate positive changes in WAS, DWP, HRQoL, BMI, and 
RTWSE from baseline to 12-month follow-up. For people with BMI above 30 kg/m2, 
changes in HRQoL are important for an increase in WAS, and a high RTWEXP is 
essential to achieve work participation. Future studies examining VR programs 
with lifestyle interventions for people with obesity are recommended.

The bellwether procedures described by the Lancet Commission on Global Surgery 
represent the ability to deliver adult surgical services after there is a clear 
and easily made diagnosis. There is a need for pediatric surgery bellwether 
indicators. A pediatric bellwether indicator would ideally be a routinely 
performed procedure, for a relatively common condition that, in itself, is 
rarely lethal at birth, but that should ideally be treated with surgery by a 
standard age. Additionally, the condition should be easy to diagnose, to 
minimize the confounding effects of delays or failures in diagnosis. In this 
study, we propose the age at primary cleft lip (CL) repair as a bellwether 
indicator for pediatric surgery.
METHOD: We reviewed the surgical records of 71,346 primary cleft surgery 
patients and ultimately studied age at CL repair in 40,179 patients from 73 
countries, treated by Smile Train partners for 2019. Data from Smile Train's 
database were correlated with World Bank and WHO indicators.
RESULTS: Countries with a higher average age at CL repair (delayed access to 
surgery) had higher maternal, infant, and child mortality rates as well as a 
greater risk of catastrophic health expenditure for surgery. There was also a 
negative correlation between delayed CL repair and specialist surgical workforce 
numbers, life expectancy, percentage of deliveries by C-section, total health 
expenditure per capita, and Lancet Commission on Global Surgery procedure rates.
CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that age at CL repair has potential to serve 
as a bellwether indicator for pediatric surgical capacity in Lower- and 
Middle-income Countries.

During brain development, axon outgrowth and its subsequent pathfinding are 
reliant on a highly motile growth cone located at the tip of the axon. Actin 
polymerization that is regulated by actin-depolymerizing factors homology 
(ADF-H) domain-containing family drives the formation of lamellipodia and 
filopodia at the leading edge of growth cones for axon guidance. However, the 
precise localization and function of ADF-H domain-containing proteins involved 
in axon extension and retraction remain unclear. We have previously shown that 
transcripts and proteins of coactosin-like protein 1 (COTL1), an ADF-H 
domain-containing protein, are observed in neurites and axons in chick embryos. 
Coactosin overexpression analysis revealed that this protein was localized to 
axonal growth cones and involved in axon extension in the midbrain. We further 
examined the specific distribution of coactosin and cofilin within the growth 
cone using superresolution microscopy, structured illumination microscopy, which 
overcomes the optical diffraction limitation and is suitable to the analysis of 
cellular dynamic movements. We found that coactosin was tightly associated with 
F-actin bundles at the growth cones and that coactosin overexpression promoted 
the expansion of lamellipodia and extension of growth cones. Coactosin knockdown 
in oculomotor neurons resulted in an increase in the levels of the inactive, 
phosphorylated form of cofilin and dysregulation of actin polymerization and 
axonal elongation, which suggests that coactosin promoted axonal growth in a 
cofilin-dependent manner. Indeed, the application of a dominant-negative form of 
LIMK1, a downstream effector of GTPases, reversed the effect of coactosin 
knockdown on axonal growth by enhancing cofilin activity. Combined, our results 
indicate that coactosin functions promote the assembly of protrusive actin 
filament arrays at the leading edge for growth cone motility.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The decision to initiate anticoagulation in older 
adults with atrial fibrillation is complicated by the benefit of ischemic stroke 
prevention vs the risk of falls resulting in major bleeds. The objective of this 
study was to assess the impact of different treatments including direct oral 
anticoagulants on quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) in patients aged 75 years 
and older with atrial fibrillation in the context of falls.
METHODS: A Markov decision process was constructed for older patients with 
atrial fibrillation taking no anti-thrombotic, aspirin, warfarin, rivaroxaban, 
and apixaban. Input probabilities for clinical events were estimated from the 
available literature. One-way and two-way sensitivity analyses were performed by 
measuring the impact of varying input probabilities of clinical events on QALY 
outcomes.
RESULTS: The base-case scenario estimated that older adults treated with no 
anti-thrombotic, aspirin, warfarin, rivaroxaban, and apixaban had QALYs of 8.03, 
8.69, 10.38, 11.02, and 11.56, respectively. The sensitivity analysis estimated 
that an older adult would need to fall over 45 (rivaroxaban) and 458 (apixaban) 
times per year for the QALY of a direct oral anticoagulant to be lower than that 
of aspirin.
CONCLUSIONS: Older adults with atrial fibrillation benefit from stroke 
protection of anticoagulants, especially direct oral anticoagulants, even if 
they are at high risk of falls. Clinicians should not consider fall risk as a 
deciding factor for withholding anticoagulation in this population of patients.

OBJECTIVES: For anaemic elective surgery patients, current clinical practice 
guidelines weakly recommend the routine use of iron, but not 
erythrocyte-stimulating agents (ESAs), except for short-acting ESAs in major 
orthopaedic surgery. This recommendation is, however, not based on any 
cost-effectiveness studies. The aim of this research was to (1) systematically 
review the literature regarding cost effectiveness of preoperative iron and/or 
ESAs in anaemic, elective surgery patients and (2) update existing economic 
evaluations (EEs) with recent data.
METHODS: Eight databases and registries were searched for EEs and randomized 
controlled trials (RCTs) reporting cost-effectiveness data on November 11, 2020. 
Data were extracted, narratively synthesized and critically appraised using the 
Philips reporting checklist. Pre-existing full EEs were updated with 
effectiveness data from a recent systematic review and current cost data. 
Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were expressed as cost per 
(quality-adjusted) life-year [(QA)LY] gained.
RESULTS: Only five studies (4 EEs and 1 RCT) were included, one on intravenous 
iron and four on ESAs + oral iron. The EE on intravenous iron only had an 
in-hospital time horizon. Therefore, cost effectiveness of preoperative iron 
remains uncertain. The three EEs on ESAs had a lifetime time horizon, but 
reported cost per (QA)LY gained of 20-65 million (GBP or CAD). Updating these 
analyses with current data confirmed ESAs to have a cost per (QA)LY gained of 
3.5-120 million (GBP or CAD).
CONCLUSIONS: Cost effectiveness of preoperative iron is unproven, whereas 
routine preoperative ESA therapy cannot be considered cost effective in elective 
surgery, based on the limited available data. Future guidelines should reflect 
these findings.
