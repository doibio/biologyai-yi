Recent models of social anxiety disorder emphasise the role of emotion 
dysregulation; however, the nature of the proposed impairment needs 
clarification. In a replication and extension framework, four studies (N = 193) 
examined whether individuals with social anxiety (HSAs) are impaired in using 
cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression. Self-reports and lab-based 
tasks of suppression and reappraisal were utilised among individuals with high 
and low levels of social anxiety. A meta-analysis of these studies indicated 
that, compared to controls, HSAs reported less frequent and effective use of 
reappraisal and more frequent and effective use of suppression. Counter to most 
models and our hypotheses, HSAs were more successful than controls in lab-based 
reappraisal of shame-arousing pictures as measured by subjective ratings, but 
not by event-related potentials. HSAs were less successful than controls in 
lab-based suppression of shame-arousing pictures as measured by subjective 
ratings, but not by event-related potentials. The results held even when 
participants were under social stress (impromptu speech anticipation). Overall, 
subjective reports of HSAs reveal strong deficits in emotion regulation whereas 
lab-based measures provided less conclusive evidence of such deficits. These 
results suggest that individuals with social anxiety experience difficulties 
implementing their reappraisal abilities in daily life.

BACKGROUND: As the socioeconomic conditions in Jordan have improved over recent 
decades the disease and economic burden of Hepatitis A has increased. The 
purpose of this study is to assess the potential health and economic impact of a 
two-dose hepatitis A vaccine program covering one-year old children in Jordan.
METHODS: We adapted an age-structured population model of hepatitis A 
transmission dynamics to project the epidemiologic and economic impact of 
vaccinating one-year old children for 50 years in Jordan. The epidemiologic 
model was calibrated using local data on hepatitis A in Jordan. These data 
included seroprevalence and incidence data from the Jordan Ministry of Health as 
well as hospitalization data from King Abdullah University Hospital in Irbid, 
Jordan. We assumed 90% of all children would be vaccinated with the two-dose 
regimen by two years of age. The economic evaluation adopted a societal 
perspective and measured benefits using the quality-adjusted life-year (QALY).
RESULTS: The modeled vaccination program reduced the incidence of hepatitis A in 
Jordan by 99%, 50 years after its introduction. The model projected 4.26 million 
avoided hepatitis A infections, 1.42 million outpatient visits, 22,475 
hospitalizations, 508 fulminant cases, 95 liver transplants, and 76 deaths over 
a 50 year time horizon. In addition, we found, over a 50 year time horizon, the 
vaccination program would gain 37,502 QALYs and save over $42.6 million in total 
costs. The vaccination program became cost-saving within 6 years of its 
introduction and was highly cost-effective during the first 5 years.
CONCLUSION: A vaccination program covering one-year old children is projected to 
be a cost-saving intervention that will significantly reduce the public health 
and economic burden of hepatitis A in Jordan.

BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to estimate the total economic and health 
related burden of breast cancer in the Netherlands.
METHODS: Data on incidence, prevalence, mortality and survival were extracted 
from the Dutch National Cancer Registry and were used to calculate the economic 
and health related burden of breast cancer for overall, DCIS (stage 0), early- 
(stage I), locally advanced- (stage II-III) and metastatic- (stage IV) breast 
cancer by age groups and by year (if applicable).
RESULTS: The overall incidence of breast cancer increased from 103.4 up to 153.2 
per 100,000 women between 1990 and 2014. The increase was driven by DCIS and 
early breast cancer as the incidence of locally advanced and metastatic breast 
cancer remained stable. Between 1990 and 2014, ten-year overall survival rates 
increased from 87% to 93% for early breast cancer, 41% to 62% for locally 
advanced- and from 6% to 9% for metastatic disease. Annually, breast cancer in 
the Netherlands is responsible for approximately 3100 deaths, 26,000 life years 
lost, 65,000 Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) and an economic burden of 
€1.27 billion.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a comprehensive assessment of the burden of 
breast cancer and subsequent trends over time in the Netherlands.

BACKGROUND: We aimed to clarify the feasibility of a community-based screening 
strategy for breast cancer in Tianjin, China; to identify the factors that most 
significantly influenced its feasibility; and to identify the reference range 
for quality control.
METHODS: A state-transition Markov model simulated a hypothetical cohort of 
100,000 healthy women, the start aged was set at 35 years and the time horizon 
was set to 50 years. The primary outcome for the model was the incremental 
cost-utility ratio (ICUR), defined as the program's cost per quality-adjusted 
life year (QALY) gained. Three screening strategies providing by community 
health service for women aged 35 to 69 years was compared regarding to different 
intervals.
RESULT: The probability of the ICUR being below 20 272USD (i.e., triple the 
annual gross domestic product [3 GDPs]) per QALY saved was 100% for annual 
screening strategy and screening every three years. Only when the attendance 
rate was > 50%, the probability for annual screening would be cost effective 
> 95%. The probability for the annual screening strategy being cost effective 
could reach to 95% for a willingness-to-pay (WTP) of 2 GDPs when the compliance 
rate for transfer was > 80%. When 10% stage I tumors were detected by screening, 
the probability of the annual screening strategy being cost effective would be 
up to 95% for a WTP > 3 GDPs.
CONCLUSION: Annual community-based breast cancer screening was cost effective 
for a WTP of 3 GDP based on the incidence of breast cancer in Tianjin, China. 
Measures are needed to ensure performance indicators to a desirable level for 
the cost-effectiveness of breast cancer screening.

Translational readthrough of the stop codon of the capsid protein (CP) open 
reading frame (ORF) is used by members of the Luteoviridae to produce their 
minor capsid protein as a readthrough protein (RTP). The elements regulating RTP 
expression are not well understood, but they involve long-distance interactions 
between RNA domains. Using high-resolution mass spectrometry, glutamine and 
tyrosine were identified as the primary amino acids inserted at the stop codon 
of Potato leafroll virus (PLRV) CP ORF. We characterized the contributions of a 
cytidine-rich domain immediately downstream and a branched stem-loop structure 
600 to 700 nucleotides downstream of the CP stop codon. Mutations predicted to 
disrupt and restore the base of the distal stem-loop structure prevented and 
restored stop codon readthrough. Motifs in the downstream readthrough element 
(DRTE) are predicted to base pair to a site within 27 nucleotides (nt) of the CP 
ORF stop codon. Consistent with a requirement for this base pairing, the DRTE of 
Cereal yellow dwarf virus was not compatible with the stop codon-proximal 
element of PLRV in facilitating readthrough. Moreover, deletion of the 
complementary tract of bases from the stop codon-proximal region or the DRTE of 
PLRV prevented readthrough. In contrast, the distance and sequence composition 
between the two domains was flexible. Mutants deficient in RTP translation moved 
long distances in plants, but fewer infection foci developed in systemically 
infected leaves. Selective 2'-hydroxyl acylation and primer extension (SHAPE) 
probing to determine the secondary structure of the mutant DRTEs revealed that 
the functional mutants were more likely to have bases accessible for 
long-distance base pairing than the nonfunctional mutants. This study reveals a 
heretofore unknown combination of RNA structure and sequence that reduces stop 
codon efficiency, allowing translation of a key viral protein.IMPORTANCE 
Programmed stop codon readthrough is used by many animal and plant viruses to 
produce key viral proteins. Moreover, such "leaky" stop codons are used in host 
mRNAs or can arise from mutations that cause genetic disease. Thus, it is 
important to understand the mechanism(s) of stop codon readthrough. Here, we 
shed light on the mechanism of readthrough of the stop codon of the coat protein 
ORFs of viruses in the Luteoviridae by identifying the amino acids inserted at 
the stop codon and RNA structures that facilitate this "leakiness" of the stop 
codon. Members of the Luteoviridae encode a C-terminal extension to the capsid 
protein known as the readthrough protein (RTP). We characterized two RNA domains 
in Potato leafroll virus (PLRV), located 600 to 700 nucleotides apart, that are 
essential for efficient RTP translation. We further determined that the PLRV 
readthrough process involves both local structures and long-range RNA-RNA 
interactions. Genetic manipulation of the RNA structure altered the ability of 
PLRV to translate RTP and systemically infect the plant. This demonstrates that 
plant virus RNA contains multiple layers of information beyond the primary 
sequence and extends our understanding of stop codon readthrough. Strategic 
targets that can be exploited to disrupt the virus life cycle and reduce its 
ability to move within and between plant hosts were revealed.

Who should take on risky tasks in an age-heterogeneous society? Life-history 
theory predicts that, in social insects, riskier tasks should be undertaken by 
sterile individuals with a shorter life expectancy. The loss of individuals with 
shorter life expectancy is less costly for colony reproductive success than the 
loss of individuals with longer life expectancy. Termite colonies have a sterile 
soldier caste, specialized defenders engaged in the most risky tasks. Here we 
show that termite soldiers exhibit age-dependent polyethism, as old soldiers are 
engaged in front-line defence more than young soldiers. Our nest defence 
experiment showed that old soldiers went to the front line and blocked the nest 
opening against approaching predatory ants more often than young soldiers. We 
also found that young soldiers were more biased toward choosing central nest 
defence as royal guards than old soldiers. These results demonstrate that 
termite soldiers have age-based task allocation, by which ageing predisposes 
soldiers to switch to more dangerous tasks. This age-dependent soldier task 
allocation increases the life expectancy of soldiers, allowing them to promote 
their lifetime contribution to colony reproductive success.

Although the life expectancy if patients with essential thrombocythemia (ET) is 
considered to be almost similar to that of the general population, advanced age, 
leukocytosis, and a previous history of thrombosis are poor prognostic factors, 
and it is important to prevent thrombohemorrhagic events, leukemic 
transformation, and secondary malignancies. We report an 85-year-old ET patient 
with a history of asymptomatic lacunar infarction, who developed symptomatic 
cerebral infarction and even chronic subdural hematoma. It is necessary to 
follow patients who have asymptomatic cerebral infarction or chronic ischemic 
change and to examine the necessity of brain imaging and treatment intervention 
at the time of diagnosis.

Due to a paucity of surveys in northern Indochina and lack of international 
collaborations among neighboring countries, recognized distributional ranges for 
many amphibian and reptile species end at the political borders for some 
countries, despite seemingly continuous suitable habitat spanning the region. 
Combining both morphological and genetic data, we report the first discovery of 
Japalura chapaensis, a rare agamid lizard believed previously to be endemic to 
northern Vietnam only, along the border region of southeastern Yunnan Province, 
China. To facilitate future research on the genus Japalura sensu lato in 
Indochina, we provide detailed descriptions of additional specimens of this rare 
species, including the first description of coloration in life and an expanded 
diagnosis, and discuss the species boundary of J. chapaensis with respect to its 
congeners.

Environmental stresses experienced during development exert many long-term 
effects upon health and disease. For example, chemical oxidants or genetic 
perturbations that induce low levels of reactive oxygen species can extend 
lifespan in several species. In some cases, the beneficial effects of low-dose 
oxidants are attributed to adaptive protective mechanisms such as mitohormesis, 
which involve long-term increases in the expression of stress response genes. 
Here we show in Drosophila that transient exposure to low concentrations of 
oxidants during development leads to an extension of adult lifespan. 
Surprisingly, this depends upon oxidants acting in an antibiotic-like manner to 
selectively deplete the microbiome of Acetobacter proteobacteria. We demonstrate 
that the presence of Acetobacter species, such as A. aceti, in the indigenous 
microbiota increases age-related gut dysfunction and shortens lifespan. This 
study demonstrates that low-dose oxidant exposure during early life can extend 
lifespan via microbiome remodelling rather than mitohormesis.

Purpose: To investigate the influence of β-alanine (BA) supplementation on 
muscle carnosine content, muscle pH and the power-duration relationship (i.e., 
critical power and W'). Methods: In a double-blind, randomized, 
placebo-controlled study, 20 recreationally-active males (22 ± 3 y, V°O2peak 
3.73 ± 0.44 L·min-1) ingested either BA (6.4 g/d for 28 d) or placebo (PL) (6.4 
g/d) for 28 d. Subjects completed an incremental test and two 3-min all-out 
tests separated by 1-min on a cycle ergometer pre- and post-supplementation. 
Muscle pH was assessed using 31P-magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) during 
incremental (INC KEE) and intermittent knee-extension exercise (INT KEE). Muscle 
carnosine content was determined using 1H-MRS. Results: There were no 
differences in the change in muscle carnosine content from pre- to 
post-intervention (PL: 1 ± 16% vs. BA: -4 ± 25%) or in muscle pH during INC KEE 
or INT KEE (P > 0.05) between PL and BA, but blood pH (PL: -0.06 ± 0.10 vs. BA: 
0.09 ± 0.13) during the incremental test was elevated post-supplementation in 
the BA group only (P < 0.05). The changes from pre- to post-supplementation in 
critical power (PL: -8 ± 18 W vs. BA: -6 ± 17 W) and W' (PL: 1.8 ± 3.3 kJ vs. 
BA: 1.5 ± 1.7 kJ) were not different between groups. No relationships were 
detected between muscle carnosine content and indices of exercise performance. 
Conclusions: BA supplementation had no significant effect on muscle carnosine 
content and no influence on intramuscular pH during incremental or 
high-intensity intermittent knee-extension exercise. The small increase in blood 
pH following BA supplementation was not sufficient to significantly alter the 
power-duration relationship or exercise performance.

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common autosomal recessive disorder in 
Caucasian populations. Individuals with CF have seen significant increases in 
life expectancy in the last 60 years. As a result, previously rare complications 
are now coming to light. The most common of these is cystic fibrosis-related 
diabetes (CFRD), which affects 40-50% of CF adults. CFRD significantly impacts 
the pulmonary function and longevity of CF patients, yet a lack of consensus on 
the best methods to diagnose and treat CFRD remains. We begin by reviewing our 
understanding of the pathogenesis of CFRD, as emerging evidence shows the cystic 
fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) also has important roles in 
the release of insulin and glucagon and in the protection of β cells from 
oxidative stress. We then discuss how current recommended methods of CFRD 
diagnosis are not appropriate, as continuous glucose monitoring becomes more 
effective, practical, and cost-effective. Finally, we evaluate emerging 
treatments which have narrowed the mortality gap within the CF patient group. In 
the future, pharmacological potentiators and correctors directly targeting CFTR 
show huge promise for both CFRD and the wider CF patient groups.

disease (CVD) represents the main contributor to premature mortality. 
Conventional and biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) have 
considerably improved long-term outcomes in ARDs not only by suppressing 
systemic inflammation but also by lowering CVD burden. Regarding atherosclerotic 
disease prevention, EULAR has recommended tight disease control accompanied by 
regular assessment of traditional CVD risk factors and lifestyle changes. 
However, this approach, although rational and evidence-based, does not account 
for important issues such as myocardial inflammation and the long asymptomatic 
period that usually proceeds clinical manifestations of CVD disease in ARDs 
before or after the diagnosis of systemic disease. Cardiovascular magnetic 
resonance (CMR) can offer reliable, reproducible and operator independent 
information regarding myocardial inflammation, ischemia and fibrosis. Some 
studies suggest a role for CMR in the risk stratification of ARDs and 
demonstrate that oedema/fibrosis visualisation with CMR may have the potential 
to inform cardiac and rheumatic treatment modification in ARDs with or without 
abnormal routine cardiac evaluation. In this review, we discuss how CMR findings 
could influence anti-rheumatic treatment decisions targeting optimal control of 
both systemic and myocardial inflammation irrespective of clinical 
manifestations of cardiac disease. CMR can provide a different approach that is 
very promising for risk stratification and treatment modification; however, 
further studies are needed before the inclusion of CMR in the routine evaluation 
and treatment of patients with ARDs.

AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To explore healthcare professionals' and patients' 
perceptions of the potential use of a Transition Readiness Scale in cystic 
fibrosis care. This included an examination of barriers and facilitators to its 
implementation along with the identification of key items to include in a 
Transition Readiness Scale.
BACKGROUND: Due to increasing life expectancy and improved quality of life, more 
adolescents with cystic fibrosis are transitioning from paediatric to adult 
health care. To assess and correctly manage this transition, a more structured 
approach to transition is advocated. This can be achieved using a Transition 
Readiness Scale to potentially identify or target areas of care in which the 
adolescent may have poor knowledge. These key items include education, 
developmental readiness taking into account relationships, reproduction, future 
plans and self-management skills. Existing tools to gauge readiness concentrate 
mainly on education and self-care needs assessment as their key items. 
Currently, there is no specific cystic fibrosis Transition Readiness Scale in 
use in Ireland or internationally.
DESIGN: The study used a descriptive qualitative design.
METHODS: Data were collected using semi-structured interviews (n = 8) and 
analysed using a thematic approach.
RESULTS: The findings identified the potential benefits of this tool and second 
the resources which need to be in place before its development and 
implementation into cystic fibrosis services.
CONCLUSION: Transition Readiness Scales have substantial relevance with cystic 
fibrosis services emphasising the importance of establishing the necessary 
resources prior to its implementation. These were identified as more staff, a 
dedicated private space and staff training and education.
RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Significant resources are needed to fully 
integrate Transition Readiness Scales in practice. The study findings suggest 
multidisciplinary collaborations, and patient engagement is pivotal in planning 
and easing the transition process for adolescents with cystic fibrosis.

BACKGROUND: Age related loss of skeletal muscle mass is accompanied by changes 
in muscle quality leading to impairment of functional status.
AIM: This study investigated the effect of resistance training and nutritional 
supply on muscle mass and muscle quality in very old institutionalized adults.
DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, multi-arm parallel and controlled intervention 
study.
SETTING: This study was conducted in five retirement care facilities.
POPULATION: This subgroup of the Vienna Active Ageing Study included 54 women 
and men (82.4±6.0 years) with impaired health status. Participants were randomly 
assigned either to elastic band resistance training (N.=16), training with 
nutritional supplementation (N.=21) or control group (N.=17).
METHODS: Health status was assessed at baseline with functional tests, cognitive 
status, nutritional status, sum of medications as well as sum of diseases. 
Skeletal muscle mass, determined by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, isokinetic 
knee extension and flexion force and handgrip strength were assessed at baseline 
and after 6 months. Muscle quality of lower extremities was defined as ratio of 
the extensor (MQ_LE (Ext.)) or flexor strength (MQ_LE (Flex.)) to lean leg mass. 
Muscle quality of upper extremity was defined as ratio of handgrip strength to 
lean arm mass. Follow-up examinations were performed after 12 and 18 months of 
intervention.
RESULTS: Muscle quality, but not muscle mass, showed significant correlations to 
functional tests at baseline (0.300 - 0.614, P<0.05). Resistance training 
significantly enhanced muscle quality of lower extremity after 6 months (MQ_LE 
(Ext.) +19.8%, MQ_LE (Flex.) +30.8%, P<0.05). Nutritional supplementation could 
not further increase the training effect. Participants with lower muscle quality 
at baseline benefit most from the training intervention. Skeletal muscle mass 
was not changed by any intervention.
CONCLUSIONS: Resistance training with elastic bands improved muscle quality in 
very old people. Additional nutritional supplementation was not able to further 
improve the effects obtained by training alone.
CLINICAL REHABILITATION IMPACT: Elastic band resistance training could be safely 
used to improve muscle quality even in old people with impaired health status. 
Weak and chronically ill participants benefit most from this training.

BACKGROUND: Medial meniscus root tears are a common knee injury and can lead to 
accelerated osteoarthritis, which might ultimately result in a total knee 
replacement.
PURPOSE: To compare meniscus repair, meniscectomy, and nonoperative treatment 
approaches among middle-aged patients in terms of osteoarthritis development, 
total knee replacement rates (clinical effectiveness), and cost-effectiveness.
STUDY DESIGN: Meta-analysis and cost-effectiveness analysis.
METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted. Progression to 
osteoarthritis was pooled and meta-analyzed. A Markov model projected 
strategy-specific costs and disutilities in a cohort of 55-year-old patients 
presenting with a meniscus root tear without osteoarthritis at baseline. Failure 
rates of repair and meniscectomy procedures and disutilities associated with 
osteoarthritis, total knee replacement, and revision total knee replacement were 
accounted for. Utilities, costs, and event rates were based on literature and 
public databases. Analyses considered a time frame between 5 years and lifetime 
and explored the effects of parameter uncertainty.
RESULTS: Over 10 years, meniscus repair, meniscectomy, and nonoperative 
treatment led to 53.0%, 99.3%, and 95.1% rates of osteoarthritis and 33.5%, 
51.5%, and 45.5% rates of total knee replacement, respectively. Meta-analysis 
confirmed lower osteoarthritis and total knee replacement rates for meniscus 
repair versus meniscectomy and nonoperative treatment. Discounted 10-year costs 
were $22,590 for meniscus repair, as opposed to $31,528 and $25,006 for 
meniscectomy and nonoperative treatment, respectively; projected 
quality-adjusted life years were 6.892, 6.533, and 6.693, respectively, yielding 
meniscus repair to be an economically dominant strategy. Repair was either 
cost-effective or dominant when compared with meniscectomy and nonoperative 
treatment across a broad range of assumptions starting from 5 years after 
surgery.
CONCLUSION: Repair of medial meniscus root tears, as compared with total 
meniscectomy and nonsurgical treatment, leads to less osteoarthritis and is a 
cost-saving intervention. While small confirmatory randomized clinical 
head-to-head trials are warranted, the presented evidence seems to point 
relatively clearly toward adopting meniscus repair as the preferred initial 
intervention for medial meniscus root tears.

INTRODUCTION: The reproduction of the anatomical joint line could be a good 
index to obtain good results in knee prosthesis surgery, although in revision 
surgery has not been enough studied. A search for a simple and reproducible 
method is needed to review these results.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted between January 2000 
and December 2013. A total of 97 total revision knee arthroplasties were 
implanted. Finally, the study group consisted of 67 patients. To perform our 
study, the joint line was evaluated according to the method described by Hofmann 
A. The evaluation of the clinical results included the following main variables: 
Flexion, extension, range of motion, WOMAC, SF-36, KSS (Knee Society Score) and 
functional KSS. The survival of the arthroplasties was studied. (p = 0.05).
RESULTS: The variables of flexion, extension and range of postoperative movement 
are statistically correlated with this measure. The KSS was statistically 
related in its joint aspect with the restoration of the joint line. For the 
other scales, SF-36 and WOMAC, the figures were higher but did not correlate 
with the accepted p.
CONCLUSION: In view of these results, we can say that the restoration of the 
anatomical joint line improves the clinical results of revision total knee 
arthroplasty.

Publisher: INTRODUCCIÓN: La reproducción de la correcta línea articular podría 
ser un buen índice para la obtención de resultados satisfactorios en la cirugía 
protésica de rodilla, aunque en la cirugía de revisión no se ha estudiado 
ampliamente. Es necesaria la búsqueda de un método sencillo y reproducible para 
evaluar esos resultados.
MATERIAL Y MÉTODOS: Se realizó un estudio retrospectivo entre Enero del 2000 y 
Diciembre del 2013. Se implantaron 97 artroplastías totales de revisión de 
rodilla. El grupo de estudio lo conformaron 67 pacientes. Para la realización de 
nuestro trabajo se evaluó la línea articular según el método descrito por 
Hofmann A. La evaluación de los resultados clínicos incluyó las siguientes 
variables primarias: flexión, extensión, rango de movimiento, WOMAC, SF-36, KSS 
(Knee Society Score) y KSS funcional. Se estudió la supervivencia de las 
artroplastías.
RESULTADOS: Las variables de flexión, extensión y rango de movimiento 
postoperatorio se correlacionaron estadísticamente con esta medición. El KSS se 
relacionó estadísticamente en su vertiente articular con la restauración de la 
línea articular. Para el resto de escalas, SF-36 y WOMAC, las puntuaciones 
fueron más altas pero no se correlacionó con la significación aceptada.
CONCLUSIÓN: Ante estos resultados podemos afirmar que la restauración de la 
correcta línea articular mejora los resultados clínicos de la cirugía de 
revisión de rodilla.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the mortality rate of children, adolescents and adults 
with sickle cell anemia in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
METHODS: The number of deaths, the mortality rate and the causes of deaths in 
patients with sickle cell anemia who were treated and followed up at our 
institution for 15 years were determined and compared to data available for the 
Brazilian population.
RESULTS: The overall number of deaths was 281 patients with a mortality rate of 
16.77%. Survival probability was significantly higher in females. The number of 
deaths and the mortality rate were age-specific with a significant increase in 
the 19- to 29-year-old age group. The remaining life expectancy of the patients 
with sickle cell anemia was less than that of Brazilians at large. The gap 
between the two was about 20 years for ages between one and five years with this 
gap decreasing to ten years after the age of 65 years. The most common causes of 
death were infection, acute chest syndrome, overt stroke, organ damage and 
sudden death during painful crises.
CONCLUSION: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first Brazilian study in a 
single institution in Rio de Janeiro; the mortality rate was 18.87% among adult 
patients with sickle cell anemia. The mortality rates in children and adults are 
higher than those reported in developed countries of the northern hemisphere.

Two-spotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae Koch, is one of the economically 
most important pests on a wide range of crops in greenhouses and orchards 
worldwide. Control of T. urticae has been largely based on the use of 
acaricides. Sublethal effects of spirodiclofen, pyridaben and abamectin were 
studied on life-table parameters of T. urticae females treated with the 
acaricides. LC25 values of spirodiclofen, abamectin and pyridaben (3.84, 0.04 
and 136.96 µg a.i./ml, respectively) were used for sublethal studies. All 
acaricides showed significant effects on T. urticae biological parameters 
including developmental time, survival rate, and fecundity. The females treated 
with spirodiclofen, abamectin and pyridaben at LC25 exhibited significantly 
reduced net reproductive rate (R0), finite rate of increase (λ) and intrinsic 
rate of increase (r). The intrinsic rate of increase in spirodiclofen, abamectin 
and pyridaben treated groups and control were 0.0138, 0.0273, 0.039 and 0.2481 
female offspring per female per day, respectively. The results indicated that 
sublethal concentrations of tested pesticides strongly affected the life 
characteristics of spider mite and consequently may influence mite population 
growth in future generations.

Important progresses in the management of patients with human immunodeficiency 
virus, in particular the advent of new anti-retroviral therapies (ART), have 
turned this rapidly fatal condition into a controllable chronic disease with a 
life expectancy that approaches the one from the general population. 
Cardiovascular diseases have now become one of the leading causes of 
non-HIV-related mortality in this population. Several factors including the 
presence of HIV in the vascular wall and the development of dyslipidemia and 
alteration in body fat distribution under ART might play a role the progression 
of atherosclerosis in HIV-infected patients. The use of imaging biomarkers may 
help to identify the factors associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular 
events and select high-risk patients who will benefit the most from the early 
implementation of preventive treatments.

Thromboprophylaxis in cancer patients in hospice.

Zabrocka E(1), Wojtukiewicz MZ(1), Sierko E(1).

(1)Department of Oncology, Medical University of Bialystok, Poland.

Advanced cancer patients in hospice are at notably increased risk of venous 
thromboembolism (VTE) due to age, local and distal advancement of the malignancy 
and bed confinement, among other factors. Asymptomatic VTE prevalence among 
palliative care patients has been found to reach 50%, whereas the clinically 
overt form occurs in 10%. Hospice patients are frequently given medications 
increasing VTE risk, for instance megestrol which is a drug commonly used in 
cancer cachexia. Many of the available guidelines encourage the implementation 
of thromboprophylaxis (TPX) in cancer patients, e.g., in the perioperative 
period or over the course of chemotherapy. However, concerning patients 
remaining under hospice care where the priority goal is not life extension but 
assurance of the best possible quality of life (QoL), the main benefit from the 
TPX would be a decrease in the risk of symptom burden associated with VTE, i.e., 
pain, edema or dyspnea. Nevertheless, studies performed on a sufficiently large 
study group, which could unequivocally determine the influence of 
anticoagulation on VTE symptom burden in hospice patients, are still lacking. 
VTE prophylaxis is challenging for many reasons: its unknown effect on QoL, 
vague risk of its discontinuation, and risk of bleeding complications which is 
additionally increased in conditions prevalent in hospice population, i.e., 
malnutrition, renal or liver insufficiency. So far, most of the guidelines 
issued by oncological societies do not precisely refer to the problem of TPX in 
hospice patients. Therefore, the decisions on the implementation of 
anticoagulation should be taken individually, with previous assessment of VTE 
risk, comorbidities and possible hemorrhagic complications.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a progressive condition characterized by a 
permanent and irreversible loss of renal function. In accordance to 
international guidelines, CKD clinical diagnosis methods are based on creatinine 
and albumin levels and glomerular filtration rate. Unfortunately, these 
parameters are scarcely affected in early stages, and its inherent intrinsic 
variability only allows for the identification of intermediate and advanced 
stages, when life expectancy has become shorter and treatment poses a 
significant financial investment. In this context, several targeted strategies 
have been designed for searching novel markers. Among them, "omics" techniques 
have emerged, mainly based on proteomics and metabolomics research. Urine and 
serum samples have been selected as starting material to conduct the 
identification of new CKD biomarkers, capable of differentiating between stages 
and predicting progression outcomes. In many cases, the principal objective is 
to develop a fast and reliable clinical method for non-invasive analysis in the 
early progression stages of the disease. On the other hand, significant efforts 
have been directed to identify molecules related to the CKD end stage in order 
to adequate therapies, reduce impairments, and have a positive impact on 
survival rate. In this article, the state of the art of novel proposed 
biomarkers for CKD identification is reviewed, with the aim of underlining its 
molecular diversity, emphasizing chemical structure differences and correlating 
its biological relevance. Efforts directed in this line could provide evidence 
of metabolic pathways imbalance, and lead to the development of new integral 
strategies for CKD evaluation and management.
