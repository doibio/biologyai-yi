As longevity occurs, people encounter various risks associated with ageing, 
including economic uncertainty and health issues. Therefore, in addition to 
extending healthy life expectancy, it is crucial to create an environment where 
older people can live better even when their intrinsic capacity declines. 
Additionally, integrated and comprehensive care for older adults is needed to 
maintain their functional ability and well-being at higher levels. This review 
provides an overview of the systems and initiatives in Japan, a forerunner of 
population ageing that supports the quality of life of older people and 
summarises their remaining challenges. In Japan, with support for access to 
necessary care available from social welfare councils and community 
comprehensive support centres, various health and welfare services are provided 
to respond to the needs of people with different levels of intrinsic capacity, 
including medical care, preventive care, long-term care, adult guardianship 
systems, pensions, and social assistance. Nevertheless, there are challenges for 
the systems, including the gap between life and healthy life expectancy, 
moderate accumulation and decumulation of retirement assets, lack of human and 
financial resources for care, and user-unfriendliness and non-covered needs of 
the current system. Therefore, integrated and comprehensive care beyond health 
and long-term care is needed to maintain the well-being of older adults, even 
with their intrinsic capacity declining.

KEY POINTS: A large proportion of hospitalized patients receiving dialysis 
report not receiving preference-concordant care. Hospitalized patients on 
dialysis desiring a comfort-oriented medical plan were likely to report 
receiving preference-concordant care.
BACKGROUND: Preference-concordant care is a cornerstone of high-quality medical 
decision-making, yet the prevalence and correlates of preference-concordant care 
have not been well-studied in patients receiving dialysis. We surveyed 
hospitalized people receiving maintenance dialysis to estimate the prevalence 
and correlates of preference-concordant care among this population.
METHODS: We assessed preference concordance by asking participants (223/380, 59% 
response rate), “How strongly do you agree or disagree that your current 
treatment plan meets your preference?” We assessed treatment plan preference by 
asking whether patients preferred a plan that focused on (1) extending life or 
(2) relieving pain and discomfort. We assessed shared dialysis decision-making 
using the 9-item Shared Decision-Making Questionnaire. We examined the 
differences between those reporting lack of preference-concordant care and those 
reporting receipt of preference-concordant care using chi-squared analyses. We 
also studied whether patients' treatment plan preferences or shared dialysis 
decision-making scores were correlated with their likelihood of receiving 
preference-concordant care.
RESULTS: Of the 213 respondents who provided data on preference concordance, 90 
(42.3%) reported that they were not receiving preference-concordant care. 
Patients who preferred pain and discomfort relief over life extension were less 
likely (odds ratio, 0.15 [95% confidence interval, 0.08 to 0.28] P = <0.0001) to 
report receiving preference-concordant care; patients with higher shared 
decision-making scores were more likely (odds ratio, 1.02 [95% confidence 
interval, 1.01 to 1.03], P = 0.02) to report preference-concordant care.
CONCLUSIONS: A substantial proportion of this sample of hospitalized people 
receiving maintenance dialysis reported not receiving preference-concordant 
care. Efforts to improve symptom management and enhance patient engagement in 
dialysis decision-making may improve the patients' perceptions of receiving 
preference-concordant care.

Management of congenitally corrected transposition from fetal diagnosis to 
adulthood.

Warsaw, Poland.

INTRODUCTION: Congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries (ccTGA) 
is a rare congenital heart defect characterized by atrioventricular and 
ventriculo-arterial discordance. CcTGA can be diagnosed at any stage of life. 
The natural history of the disease depends on concomitant anomalies present in 
most of the cases, progression of systemic ventricular dysfunction and 
conduction disturbances.
AREAS COVERED: This review describes diagnosis of the anomaly and summarizes the 
current knowledge on etiology and prognosis in ccTGA patients. Furthermore, 
interventional and pharmacological approaches to ccTGA management are discussed. 
The areas requiring further research are highlighted.
EXPERT OPINION: Although advances in diagnosis and treatment continue to improve 
outcomes for ccTGA, patients are burdened with significant morbidity and 
mortality. Optimal approaches to surgical management of the anomaly, as well as 
prevention and management of heart failure, are still not established. Future 
research should focus on the long-term effect of anatomic repair, potential 
benefits of novel pharmacological strategies for heart failure therapy, and the 
optimal mode of pacing in ccTGA patients. However, the issues might be difficult 
to address due to rarity of the disease and its heterogenous clinical 
presentation. As the life-expectancy of ccTGA patients improves, acquired 
cardiovascular disorders will become another serious concern.

Coronary artery perforations and dissections, associated with cardiac tamponade 
or acute vessel closure, are life-threatening complications of percutaneous 
coronary intervention. In some cases, subepicardial hematomas could occur and 
compress the vessel. A 59-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital with chest 
pain and was diagnosed with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction. Coronary 
angiography showed the total occlusion of the diagonal artery. During the 
intervention, left main coronary artery dissection and intramural hematoma 
occurred as coronary complications. The left main coronary artery was stented; 
however, the extension of the hematoma through the ostium of the left anterior 
descending artery caused further complications. The patient underwent an urgent 
coronary artery bypass graft surgery and was discharged on the seventh 
postoperative day.

BACKGROUND: The EBSLN is vulnerable to damage during thyroidectomy, results in 
voice related complications, negatively affect patient quality of life, routine 
identification of the EBSLN prior to surgical manipulation is necessary for a 
complication-free thyroidectomy. We aimed to validate a video-assisted procedure 
for identifying and preserving the external branch of the superior laryngeal 
nerve (EBSLN) during thyroidectomy and analyze the EBSLN Cernea classification 
and the localization of the nerve entry point (NEP) from the insertion of the 
sternothyroid muscle.
METHODS: A prospective descriptive study was performed; 134 patients, who 
scheduled for lobectomy with an intraglandular tumor max diameter ≤ 4 cm and 
without extrathyroidal extension, were randomly divided into the video-assisted 
surgery (VAS) and conventional open surgery (COS) groups. We used the 
video-assisted surgical procedure for visually identifying the EBSLN directly, 
and compared the differences in the visual identification rate and total 
identification rate of the two groups. We also measured the localization of the 
NEP using the insertion of the sternothyroid muscle as a reference.
RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference in clinical 
characteristics between the two groups. The visual identification rate and total 
identification rate were significantly higher in the VAS group than the COS 
group (91.04% vs. 77.61%, 100% vs. 89.6%). The EBSLN injury rate was 0 in both 
groups. The mean vertical distance (VD) of the NEP from the sternal thyroid 
insertion was 1.18 mm (SD 1.12 mm, range, 0-5 mm), with approximately 88.97% of 
the results occurring within the 0-2 mm range. The mean horizontal distance (HD) 
was 9.33 mm (SD 5.03 mm, range, 0-30 mm), with over 92.13% of the results 
occurring within the 5-15 mm range.
CONCLUSION: Both the visual and total identification rates of the EBSLN were 
significantly higher in the VAS group. This method provided a good visual 
exposure rate of the EBSLN, aiding in identifying and protecting the EBSLN 
during thyroidectomy.

Increased life expectancy has resulted in an increase in osteoporosis incidence 
worldwide. The coupling of angiogenesis and osteogenesis is indispensable for 
bone repair. Although traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) exerts therapeutic 
effects on osteoporosis, TCM-related scaffolds, which focus on the coupling of 
angiogenesis and osteogenesis, have not yet been used for the treatment of 
osteoporotic bone defects.Panax notoginsengsaponin (PNS), the active ingredient 
ofPanax notoginseng, was added to a poly (L-lactic acid) (PLLA) matrix. 
Osteopractic total flavone (OTF), the active ingredient ofRhizoma Drynariae, was 
encapsulated in nano-hydroxyapatite/collagen (nHAC) and added to the PLLA 
matrix. Magnesium (Mg) particles were added to the PLLA matrix to overcome the 
bioinert character of PLLA and neutralize the acidic byproducts generated by 
PLLA. In this OTF-PNS/nHAC/Mg/PLLA scaffold, PNS was released faster than OTF. 
The control group had an empty bone tunnel; scaffolds containing OTF:PNS = 
100:0, 50:50, and 0:100 were used as the treatment groups. Scaffold groups 
promoted new vessel and bone formation, increased the osteoid tissue, and 
suppressed the osteoclast activity around osteoporotic bone defects. Scaffold 
groups upregulated the expression levels of angiogenic and osteogenic proteins. 
Among these scaffolds, the OTF-PNS (50:50) scaffold exhibited a better capacity 
for osteogenesis than the OTF-PNS (100:0 and 0:100) scaffolds. Activation of the 
bone morphogenic protein (BMP)-2/BMP receptor (BMPR)-1A/runt-related 
transcription factor (RUNX)-2signaling pathway may be a possible mechanism for 
the promotion of osteogenesis. Our study demonstrated that the 
OTF-PNS/nHAC/Mg/PLLA scaffold could promote osteogenesis via the coupling of 
angiogenesis and osteogenesis in osteoporotic rats with bone defects, and 
activating theBMP-2/BMPR1A/RUNX2signaling pathway may be an osteogenesis-related 
mechanism. However, further experiments are necessary to facilitate its 
practical application in the treatment of osteoporotic bone defects.

OBJECTIVES: Thrombopoietin (TPO) mimetics are a potential alternative to 
platelet transfusion to minimize blood loss in patients with thrombocytopenia. 
This systematic review aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of TPO mimetics, 
compared with not using TPO mimetics, in adult patients with thrombocytopenia.
METHODS: Eight databases and registries were searched for full economic 
evaluations (EEs) and randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were synthesized as cost per quality-adjusted 
life year gained (QALY) or as cost per health outcome (e.g. bleeding event 
avoided). Included studies were critically appraised using the Philips reporting 
checklist.
RESULTS: Eighteen evaluations from nine different countries were included, 
evaluating the cost-effectiveness of TPO mimetics compared with no TPO, 
watch-and-rescue therapy, the standard of care, rituximab, splenectomy or 
platelet transfusion. ICERs varied from a dominant strategy (i.e. cost-saving 
and more effective), to an incremental cost per QALY/health outcome of EUR 
25,000-50,000, EUR 75,000-750,000 and EUR > 1 million, to a dominated strategy 
(cost-increasing and less effective). Few evaluations (n = 2, 10%) addressed the 
four principal types of uncertainty (methodological, structural, heterogeneity 
and parameter). Parameter uncertainty was most frequently reported (80%), 
followed by heterogeneity (45%), structural uncertainty (43%) and methodological 
uncertainty (28%).
CONCLUSIONS: Cost-effectiveness of TPO mimetics in adult patients with 
thrombocytopenia ranged from a dominant strategy to a significant incremental 
cost per QALY/health outcome or a strategy that is clinically inferior and has 
increased costs. Future validation and tackling the uncertainty of these models 
with country-specific cost data and up-to-date efficacy and safety data are 
needed to increase the generalizability.

INTRODUCTION: Patients who are older and sicker are ideal candidates for bladder 
sparing therapy for muscle invasive bladder cancer given risks of treatment 
related morbidity with radical cystectomy and cancer mortality with observation. 
However, little is known about the independent impact of age, comorbidity and 
life expectancy on utilization of bladder sparing therapy.
METHODS: We sampled 19,228 patients with muscle invasive bladder cancer 
diagnosed between 2004 and 2013 from the National Cancer Database. We used 
multivariable multinomial logistic regression to determine relative risk ratios 
and predicted probabilities of receipt of bladder sparing therapy by estimates 
of life expectancy, and by age and comorbidity at diagnosis.
RESULTS: On multivariable analysis decreasing life expectancy was significantly 
associated with higher use of bladder sparing compared with cystectomy (relative 
RR 1.08, 95% CI 1.07-1.08). However, absolute changes were modest with predicted 
probability of bladder sparing increasing from 8%, 10%, 12%, 14% and 17% among 
patients with 25-year, 20-year, 15-year, 10-year and 5-year life expectancies, 
respectively. By comparison, rates of cystectomy decreased from 54%, 47%, 39%, 
32% and 26% and rates of observation increased from 22%, 26%, 31%, 36% and 40% 
across the same life expectancy subgroups, respectively. Age had a stronger 
effect on relative risk of bladder sparing than comorbidity. Predicted 
probabilities of bladder sparing therapy increased from 8%, 12%, 16% and 19% 
among 60-year-old, 70-year-old, 80-year-old and 90-year-old patients, 
respectively, while the probability was 13%, 13% and 15% among patients with 
Charlson scores of 0, 1, and 2+, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Bladder sparing therapy is underused in patients who are older and 
sicker with limited life expectancy who currently primarily receive observation 
or, less often, radical cystectomy.

Upper Airway Assessment in Cone-Beam Computed Tomography for Screening of 
Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome: Development of an Evaluation Protocol in 
Dentistry.

BACKGROUND: The upper airways are formed by the nasal cavities, pharynx, and 
larynx. There are several radiographic methods that allow evaluation of the 
craniofacial structure. Upper airway analysis in cone-beam computed tomography 
(CBCT) may be useful in diagnosing some pathologies such as obstructive sleep 
apnea syndrome (OSAS). OSAS prevalence has increased significantly in recent 
decades, justified by increased obesity and average life expectancy. It can be 
associated with cardiovascular, respiratory, and neurovascular diseases, 
diabetes, and hypertension. In some individuals with OSAS, the upper airway is 
compromised and narrowed. Nowadays, CBCT is widely used in dentistry by 
clinicians. Its use for upper airway assessment would be an advantage for 
screening some abnormalities related to an increased risk of pathologies such as 
OSAS. CBCT helps to calculate the total volume of the airways and their area in 
different anatomical planes (sagittal, coronal, and transverse). It also helps 
identify regions with the highest anteroposterior and laterolateral constriction 
of the airways. Despite its undoubted advantages, airway assessment is not 
routinely performed in dentistry. There is no protocol that allows comparisons 
between studies, which makes it difficult to obtain scientific evidence in this 
area. Hence, there is an urgent need to standardize the protocol for upper 
airway measurement to help clinicians identify at-risk patients.
OBJECTIVE: Our main aim is to develop a standard protocol for upper airway 
evaluation in CBCT for OSAS screening in dentistry.
METHODS: To measure and evaluate the upper airways, data are obtained using 
Planmeca ProMax 3D (Planmeca). Patient orientation is performed in accordance 
with the manufacturer's indications at the time of image acquisition. The 
exposure corresponds to 90 kV, 8 mA, and 13,713 seconds. The software used for 
upper airway analysis is Romexis (version 5.1.O.R; Planmeca). The images are 
exhibited in accordance with the field of view of 20.1×17.4 cm, size of 
502×502×436 mm, and voxel size of 400 μm.
RESULTS: The protocol described and illustrated here allows for automatic 
calculation of the total volume of the pharyngeal airspace, its area of greatest 
narrowing, its location, and the smallest anteroposterior and laterolateral 
dimensions of the pharynx. These measurements are carried out automatically by 
the imaging software whose reliability is proven by the existing literature. 
Thus, we could reduce the possible bias of manual measurement, aiming at data 
collection.
CONCLUSIONS: The use of this protocol by dentists will allow for standardization 
of the measurements and constitutes a valuable screening tool for OSAS. This 
protocol may also be suitable for other imaging software. The anatomical points 
used as reference are most relevant for standardizing studies in this field.

Women comprise a significant portion of the agricultural workforce in developing 
countries but are often less likely to attend government sponsored training 
events. The objective of this study was to assess the feasibility of using 
machine-supported decision-making to increase overall training turnout while 
enhancing gender inclusivity. Using data obtained from 1,067 agricultural 
extension training events in Bangladesh (130,690 farmers), models were created 
to assess gender-based training patterns (e.g., preferences and availability for 
training). Using these models, simulations were performed to predict the top 
(most attended) training events for increasing total attendance (male and female 
combined) and female attendance, based on gender of the trainer, and when and 
where training took place. By selecting a mixture of the top training events for 
total attendance and female attendance, simulations indicate that total and 
female attendance can be concurrently increased. However, strongly emphasizing 
female participation can have negative consequences by reducing overall turnout, 
thus creating an ethical dilemma for policy makers. In addition to balancing the 
need for increasing overall training turnout with increased female 
representation, a balance between model performance and machine learning is 
needed. Model performance can be enhanced by reducing training variety to a few 
of the top training events. But given that models are early in development, more 
training variety is recommended to provide a larger solution space to find more 
optimal solutions that will lead to better future performance. Simulations show 
that selecting the top 25 training events for total attendance and the top 25 
training events for female attendance can increase female participation by over 
82% while at the same time increasing total turnout by 14%. In conclusion, this 
study supports the use of machine-supported decision-making when developing 
gender inclusivity policies in agriculture extension services and lays the 
foundation for future applications of machine learning in this area.

OBJECTIVE: To estimate the impact on lifetime health and economic outcomes of 
different methods of stratifying individuals with type 2 diabetes, followed by 
guideline-based treatment intensification targeting BMI and LDL in addition to 
HbA1c.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We divided 2,935 newly diagnosed individuals from 
the Hoorn Diabetes Care System (DCS) cohort into five Risk Assessment and 
Progression of Diabetes (RHAPSODY) data-driven clustering subgroups (based on 
age, BMI, HbA1c, C-peptide, and HDL) and four risk-driven subgroups by using 
fixed cutoffs for HbA1c and risk of cardiovascular disease based on guidelines. 
The UK Prospective Diabetes Study Outcomes Model 2 estimated discounted expected 
lifetime complication costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) for each 
subgroup and across all individuals. Gains from treatment intensification were 
compared with care as usual as observed in DCS. A sensitivity analysis was 
conducted based on Ahlqvist subgroups.
RESULTS: Under care as usual, prognosis in the RHAPSODY data-driven subgroups 
ranged from 7.9 to 12.6 QALYs. Prognosis in the risk-driven subgroups ranged 
from 6.8 to 12.0 QALYs. Compared with homogenous type 2 diabetes, treatment for 
individuals in the high-risk subgroups could cost 22.0% and 25.3% more and still 
be cost effective for data-driven and risk-driven subgroups, respectively. 
Targeting BMI and LDL in addition to HbA1c might deliver up to 10-fold increases 
in QALYs gained.
CONCLUSIONS: Risk-driven subgroups better discriminated prognosis. Both 
stratification methods supported stratified treatment intensification, with the 
risk-driven subgroups being somewhat better in identifying individuals with the 
most potential to benefit from intensive treatment. Irrespective of 
stratification approach, better cholesterol and weight control showed 
substantial potential for health gains.

BACKGROUND: Although curative treatment options are identical for male and 
female gastroesophageal cancer patients, access to care and survival may vary. 
This study aimed to compare treatment allocation and survival between male and 
female patients with potentially curable gastroesophageal cancer.
METHODS: Nationwide cohort study including all patients with potentially curable 
gastroesophageal squamous cell or adenocarcinoma diagnosed between 2006 and 2018 
registered in the Netherlands Cancer Registry. The main outcome, treatment 
allocation, was compared between male and female patients with oesophageal 
adenocarcinoma (EAC), oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), and gastric 
adenocarcinoma (GAC). Additionally, 5-year relative survival with relative 
excess risk (RER), that is, adjusted for the normal life expectancy, was 
compared.
RESULTS: Among 27,496 patients (68.8% men), most were allocated to curative 
treatment (62.8%), although rates dropped to 45.6%>70 years. Curative treatment 
rates were comparable among younger male and female patients (≤70 years) with 
gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma, while older females with EAC were less 
frequently allocated to curative treatment than males (OR = 0.85, 95% confidence 
interval [CI] 0.73-0.99). For those allocated to curative treatment, relative 
survival was superior for female patients with EAC (RER = 0.88, 95% CI 
0.80-0.96) and ESCC (RER = 0.82, 95% CI 0.75-0.91), and comparable for males and 
females with GAC (RER = 1.02, 95% CI 0.94-1.11).
CONCLUSIONS: While curative treatment rates were comparable between younger male 
and female patients with gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma, treatment disparities 
were present between older patients. When treated, the survival of females with 
EAC and ESCC was superior to males. The treatment and survival gaps between male 
and female patients with gastroesophageal cancer warrant further exploration and 
could potentially improve treatment strategies and survival.

PURPOSE: To describe the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the health care and 
daily life of children and adolescents with epilepsy.
METHODS: This systematic review followed the preferred reporting items 
guidelines and was registered on the PROSPERO platform (CRD42021255931). The 
PECO (Patient, Exposure, Comparison, Outcome) framework criteria were as 
follows: people with epilepsy (0-18 years old); exposed to the COVID-19 
pandemic; and outcomes, including epilepsy type, time of clinical diagnosis, 
seizure exacerbation, treatment and medications, need for emergency because of 
seizures, sleep, behavior, comorbidities and/or concerns, social and/or economic 
impact, insurance status, electronic device use, telemedicine, and distance 
learning. Literature searches for cross-sectional and longitudinal studies were 
conducted on Embase and PubMed. The methodological quality of identified studies 
was assessed using the Newcastle‒Ottawa Scale (NOS).
RESULTS: Data were extracted from 23 eligible out of 597 identified articles and 
included 31,673 patients. The mean NOS scores for cross-sectional study design 
was 3.84/10, and for longitudinal, it was 3.5/8 stars. Seizure exacerbations 
were reported in three studies, difficulties with access to anti-seizure 
medications in two, changes in dosage in five, and visit postponed or 
cancelation in five studies. Problems with sleep were highlighted in three, 
issues related to distance learning in two, an increased time spent on 
electronic devices in three, and increased behavioral problems in eight studies. 
Telemedicine, when available, was described as useful and supporting patient's 
needs.
CONCLUSION: The pandemic affected the health care and lifestyle of young 
individuals with epilepsy. The main problems described revolved around seizure 
control, accessing anti-seizure medication, sleep and behavioral complains.

The platform chemical 3-hydroxypropionic acid is used to synthesize various 
valuable materials, including bioplastics. Bifunctional malonyl-CoA reductase is 
a key enzyme in 3-hydroxypropionic acid biosynthesis as it catalyzes the 
two-step reduction of malonyl-CoA to malonate semialdehyde to 3-hydroxypropionic 
acid. Here, we report the cryo-EM structure of a full-length malonyl-CoA 
reductase protein from Chloroflexus aurantiacus (CaMCRFull). The EM model of 
CaMCRFull reveals a tandem helix architecture comprising an N-terminal (CaMCRND) 
and a C-terminal (CaMCRCD) domain. The CaMCRFull model also revealed that the 
enzyme undergoes a dynamic domain movement between CaMCRND and CaMCRCD due to 
the presence of a flexible linker between these two domains. Increasing the 
flexibility and extension of the linker resulted in a twofold increase in enzyme 
activity, indicating that for CaMCR, domain movement is crucial for high enzyme 
activity. We also describe the structural features of CaMCRND and CaMCRCD. This 
study reveals the protein structures underlying the molecular mechanism of 
CaMCRFull and thereby provides valuable information for future enzyme 
engineering to improve the productivity of 3-hydroxypropionic acid.

For chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), a Philadelphia chromosome-positive 
myeloproliferative neoplasm, the introduction of tyrosine kinase inhibitors has 
transformed CML from a lethal disease into a manageable chronic disease with a 
close-to-normal life expectancy. Active malignancy is an absolute 
contraindication to kidney transplantation. However, it is controversial whether 
kidney transplantation can be safely performed in patients with a history of CML 
who are in remission. We describe the clinical course of a 64-year-old male 
patient with chronic kidney disease from diabetic nephropathy (DMN) who 
underwent living donor kidney transplantation. The patient was diagnosed with 
CML 15 years ago and promptly achieved cytogenetic and molecular biological 
remission after starting imatinib. After that, he continued imatinib treatment 
for 15 years and was in remission, but his chronic kidney disease from DMN 
gradually worsened. A preemptive living donor kidney transplant was performed in 
July 2020. Imatinib for CML was discontinued because the patient maintained deep 
molecular remission (DMR) of major molecular response for more than 15 years 
before kidney transplantation. After kidney transplantation, the transplanted 
kidney function remained good at approximate serum creatinine levels of 1.1 
mg/dL without histopathologic rejection, and the 3 monthly BCR-ABL1 measurement 
results were negative and are in progress. Thus, he continues to maintain 
treatment-free remission status without imatinib for 26 months after renal 
transplantation. In conclusion, this result suggests that CML with long-lasting 
DMR on imatinib therapy can be considered an inactive malignancy and therefore a 
relative indication for kidney transplantation.

OBJECTIVES: The first 3-antigen hepatitis B vaccine was approved by the United 
States (US) Food and Drug Administration in November 2021 and was recommended by 
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 2022. We estimated the 
cost-effectiveness of this 3-antigen vaccine (PreHevbrio™) relative to the 
single-antigen vaccine, Engerix-BTM, to prevent hepatitis B virus (HBV) 
infection among US adults.
METHODS: A cost-effectiveness model was developed using a combined decision-tree 
and Markov structure to follow 100,000 adults over their remaining lifetimes 
after vaccination with either the 3-antigen or single-antigen vaccine. Outcomes 
from societal and healthcare sector perspectives were calculated for adults aged 
18-44, 45-64, and ≥65 years; adults with diabetes; and adults with obesity. 
Seroprotection rates were obtained from the phase3, head-to-head PROTECT trial 
(NCT03393754). Incidence, vaccine costs, vaccine adherence rates, direct and 
indirect costs, utilities, transition probabilities, and mortality were obtained 
from published sources. Health outcomes and costs (2020USD) were discounted 3% 
annually and reported by vaccine and population. One-way sensitivity and 
scenario analyses were conducted.
RESULTS: In the model, the 3-antigen vaccine led to fewer HBV infections, 
complications, and deaths compared with the single-antigen vaccine in all 
modeled populations due to higher rates and faster onset of seroprotection. 
Compared with the single-antigen vaccine, the 3-antigen vaccine had better 
health outcomes, more quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and lower costs in 
adults aged 18-64 years, adults with diabetes, and adults with obesity (dominant 
strategy). For adults aged ≥65 years, the 3-antigen vaccine was cost-effective 
compared with the single-antigen vaccine ($26,237/QALY gained) below common 
willingness-to-pay thresholds ($50,000-$100,000/QALY gained). In sensitivity 
analyses, results were sensitive to vaccine cost per dose, incidence, and age at 
vaccination.
CONCLUSION: The recently approved 3-antigen vaccine is a cost-saving or 
cost-effective intervention for preventing HBV infection and addressing the 
long-standing burden of hepatitis B among US adults.

Waterpipe smoking is an emerging epidemic and a severe public health problem 
worldwide. Observational studies on the hazards of a specific new waterpipe 
tobacco product are timely needed. The objectives were to analyze how dangerous 
waterpipe tobacco smoking is on the causes of all mortality, including cancer, 
and how effective smoking cessation is for improving health. We analyzed the 
hazards of exclusive waterpipe smoking through a prospective cohort study in 
Northern Vietnam. We obtained exposure data on the smoking status of specific 
cigarette and waterpipe and smoking cessation histories from each study 
participant. The outcome includes deaths due to all causes. The cause of death 
for each case is determined based on medical records. HR (95%CI) was estimated 
using a Cox proportional-hazards-regression analysis for overall mortality and 
all cancers. The ever-cigarette smoking group as the reference group, the 
exclusive waterpipe smoking group had a statistical increase in the risk for 
overall mortality HR (95% CI): 1.63 (1.32, 2.00), and all cancers HR (95%CI): 
1.67 (1.18, 2.38). The risk of death increased statistically in the group of 
waterpipe smoking over 20 years for overall mortality HR (95%CI): 1.82 (1.45, 
2.29), and all cancers HR (95%CI): 1.91 (1.27, 2.88). After stopping smoking, 
the risk of death decreased steadily. The risk of death was reduced by 41% for 
overall mortality HR (95%CI): 0.59 (0.39, 0.89), and 74% for death from cancers 
HR (95%CI): 0.26 (0.08, 0.83) after ten years or longer of cessation. Life 
expectancy was shortened by more than six years for the group of exclusive 
waterpipe smokers compared to non-smokers. This study found new novel hazards of 
exclusive waterpipe tobacco smoking. The findings are scientific evidence for 
developing strategies, policies, and budget allocations to control this novel 
tobacco product and promote cessation to improve life expectancy.
