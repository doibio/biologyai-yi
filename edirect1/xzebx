vitality and are likely to be more infectious under high temperature. Microbiota 
analysis revealed that high temperature could influence the bacterial community 
composition of tilapia intestine, accompanied by changes in intestinal 
structure. Compared to feed at 28 °C, the total bacterial species as well as 
pathogens, such as norank_f__Rhizobiales_Incertae_Sedis, Pseudorhodoplanes, 
Ancylobacter, in tilapia intestine were significantly increased at 35 °C, which 
may weaken the immune resistance of tilapia. Taken together, our results suggest 
that high temperature evoked tilapia susceptible to S. agalactiae should be the 
combined effect of enhanced S. agalactiae metabolism and dysregulated tilapia 
intestinal microbiota.

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to determine the lifetime cost-effectiveness of 
increasing home hemodialysis as a treatment option for patients experiencing 
peritoneal dialysis technique failure compared with the current standard of 
care.
METHODS: A Markov model was developed to assess the lifetime costs, 
quality-adjusted life-years, and cost-effectiveness of increasing the usage an 
integrated home dialysis model compared with the current patient pathways in the 
United Kingdom. A secondary analysis was conducted including only the cost 
difference in treatments, minimizing the impact of the high cost of dialysis 
during life-years gained. Sensitivity and scenario analyses were performed, 
including analyses from a societal rather than a National Health Service 
perspective.
RESULTS: The base-case probabilistic analysis was associated with incremental 
costs of £3413 and a quality-adjusted life-year of 0.09, resulting in an 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of £36 341. The secondary analysis found 
the integrated home dialysis model to be dominant. Conclusions on 
cost-effectiveness did not change under the societal perspective in either 
analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: The base-case analysis found that an integrated home dialysis model 
compared with current patient pathways is likely not cost-effective. These 
results were primarily driven by the high baseline costs of dialysis during 
life-years gained by patients receiving home hemodialysis. When excluding 
baseline dialysis-related treatment costs, the integrated home dialysis model 
was dominant. New strategies in kidney care patient pathway management should be 
explored because, under the assumption that dialysis should be funded, the 
results provide cost-effectiveness evidence for an integrated home dialysis 
model.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a rare fatal motor neuron disease. 
Although many potential mechanisms have been proposed, the pathophysiology of 
the disease remains unknown. Currently available treatments can only delay the 
progression of the disease and prolong life expectancy by a few months. There is 
still no definitive cure for ALS, and the development of new treatments is 
limited by a lack of understanding of the underlying biological processes that 
trigger and promote neurodegeneration. Several scientific results suggest a 
neurovascular impairment in ALS providing perspectives for the development of 
new biomarkers and treatments. In this article, we performed a systematic review 
using PRISMA guidelines including PubMed, EmBase, GoogleScholar, and Web of 
Science Core Collection to analyze the scientific literature published between 
2000 and 2021 discussing the neurocardiovascular involvement and ophthalmologic 
abnormalities in ALS. In total, 122 articles were included to establish this 
systematic review. Indeed, microvascular pathology seems to be involved in ALS, 
affecting all the neurovascular unit components. Retinal changes have also been 
recently highlighted without significant alteration of the visual pathways. 
Despite the peripheral location of the retina, it is considered as an extension 
of the central nervous system (CNS) as it displays similarities to the brain, 
the inner blood-retinal barrier, and the blood-brain barrier. This suggests that 
the eye could be considered as a 'window' into the brain in many CNS disorders. 
Thus, studying ocular manifestations of brain pathologies seems very promising 
in understanding neurodegenerative disorders, mainly ALS. Optical coherence 
tomography angiography (OCT-A) could therefore be a powerful approach for 
exploration of retinal microvascularization allowing to obtain new diagnostic 
and prognostic biomarkers of ALS.

Mortality transition in Greece is a well-studied phenomenon in several of its 
aspects. It is characterised by an almost constant increase in life expectancy 
at birth and other ages and a parallel decrease in death probabilities. The 
scope of this paper is a comprehensive assessment of the mortality transition in 
Greece since 1961, in the light of holistic analysis. Within this paper, life 
tables by gender were calculated and the temporal trends of life expectancy at 
several ages were examined. Moreover, a cluster analysis was used in order to 
verify the temporal changes in the mortality patterns. The probabilities of 
death in large age classes are presented. Furthermore, the death distribution 
was analysed in relation to various parameters: the modal age at death, mode, 
left and right inflexion points and the length of the old age heap. Before that, 
a non-linear regression method, originating from the stochastic analysis, was 
applied. Additionally, the Gini coefficient, average inter-individual 
differences, and interquartile range of survival curves were examined. Finally, 
the standardised rates of the major causes of death are presented. All the 
analysis variables were scholastically examined for their temporal trends with 
the method of Joinpoint Regression analysis. Mortality transition in Greece 
after the year 1961 is asymmetrical with a gender and an age-specific component, 
leading to the elevation of life expectancy at birth over time. During this 
period, the older ages' mortality decreases, but at a slower pace than that of 
the younger ones. The modal age at death, mode, the left and right inflexion 
points and the width of the old age heap denote the compression of mortality in 
the country. The old age death heap shifts towards older ages, while at the same 
time, the variability of ages at death decreases, being verified by the Gini 
Coefficient and average inter-individual differences. As a result, the 
rectangularization of survival curves is evident. These changes have a different 
pace of transition over time, especially after the emergence of the economic 
crisis. Finally, the major causes of death were the diseases of the circulatory 
system, neoplasms, diseases of the respiratory system and others. The temporal 
trends of these diseases differ according to the diseases and gender. Greece's 
mortality transition is an asymmetrical stepwise process characterised by its 
gender and age-specific characteristics. This process, despite being a 
continuous one, is not linear. Instead, a combination of serious developments 
over time governs the country's modern mortality regime. The evaluation of 
Greece's mortality transition through the lens of more advanced analytical 
methods may provide new insights and methodological alternatives for assessing 
mortality transition in other countries of the world.

The Bull Shark (Carcharhinus leucas) faces varying levels of exploitation around 
the world due to its coastal distribution. Information regarding population 
connectivity is crucial to evaluate its conservation status and local fishing 
impacts. In this study, we sampled 922 putative Bull Sharks from 19 locations in 
the first global assessment of population structure of this cosmopolitan 
species. Using a recently developed DNA-capture approach (DArTcap), samples were 
genotyped for 3400 nuclear markers. Additionally, full mitochondrial genomes of 
384 Indo-Pacific samples were sequenced. Reproductive isolation was found 
between and across ocean basins (eastern Pacific, western Atlantic, eastern 
Atlantic, Indo-West Pacific) with distinct island populations in Japan and Fiji. 
Bull Sharks appear to maintain gene flow using shallow coastal waters as 
dispersal corridors, whereas large oceanic distances and historical land-bridges 
act as barriers. Females tend to return to the same area for reproduction, 
making them more susceptible to local threats and an important focus for 
management actions. Given these behaviors, the exploitation of Bull Sharks from 
insular populations, such as Japan and Fiji, may instigate local decline that 
cannot readily be replenished by immigration, which can in turn affect ecosystem 
dynamics and functions. These data also supported the development of a genetic 
panel to ascertain the population of origin, which will be useful in monitoring 
the trade of fisheries products and assessing population-level impacts of this 
harvest.

AIMS: Heart failure (HF) does not only reduce the life expectancy in patients, 
but their life is also often limited by HF symptoms leading to a reduced quality 
of life (QoL) and a diminished exercise capacity. Novel parameters in cardiac 
imaging, including both global and regional myocardial strain imaging, promise 
to contribute to better patient characterization and ultimately to better 
patient management. However, many of these methods are not part of clinical 
routine yet, their associations with clinical parameters have been poorly 
studied. An imaging parameters that also indicate the clinical symptom burden of 
HF patients would make cardiac imaging more robust toward incomplete clinical 
information and support the clinical decision process.
METHODS AND RESULTS: This prospective study conducted at two centers in Germany 
between 2017 and 2018 enrolled stable outpatient subjects with HF [n = 56, 
including HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), HF with mid-range ejection 
fraction (HFmrEF), and HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF)] and a 
control cohort (n = 19). Parameters assessed included measures for external 
myocardial function, for example, cardiac index and myocardial deformation 
measurements by cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging, left ventricular 
global longitudinal strain (GLS), the global circumferential strain (GCS), and 
the regional distribution of segment deformation within the LV myocardium, as 
well as basic phenotypical characteristics including the Minnesota Living with 
Heart Failure Questionnaire (MLHFQ) and the 6-minute walk test (6MWT). If less 
than 80% of the LV segments are preserved in their deformation capacity the 
functional capacity by 6MWT (6 minutes walking distance: MyoHealth ≥ 80%: 579.8 
± 177.6 m; MyoHealth 60-<80%: 401.3 ± 121.7 m; MyoHealth 40-<60%: 456.4 ± 68.9 
m; MyoHealth < 40%: 397.6 ± 125.9 m, overall p-value: 0.03) as well as the 
symptom burden are significantly impaired (NYHA class: MyoHealth ≥ 80%: 0.6 ± 
1.1 m; MyoHealth 60-<80%: 1.7 ± 1.2 m; MyoHealth 40-<60%: 1.8 ± 0.7 m; MyoHealth 
< 40%: 2.4 ± 0.5 m; overall p-value < 0.01). Differences were also observed in 
the perceived exertion assessed by on the Borg scale (MyoHealth ≥ 80%: 8.2 ± 2.3 
m; MyoHealth 60-<80%: 10.4 ± 3.2 m; MyoHealth 40-<60%: 9.8 ± 2.1 m; MyoHealth < 
40%: 11.0 ± 2.9 m; overall p-value: 0.20) as well as quality of life measures 
(MLHFQ; MyoHealth ≥ 80%: 7.5 ± 12.4 m; MyoHealth 60-<80%: 23.4 ± 23.4 m; 
MyoHealth 40-<60%: 20.5 ± 21.2 m; MyoHealth < 40%: 27.4 ± 24.4 m; overall 
p-value: 0.15)-while these differences were not significant.
CONCLUSION: The share of LV segments with preserved myocardial contraction 
promises to discriminate between symptomatic and asymptomatic subjects based on 
the imaging findings, even when the LV ejection fraction is preserved. This 
finding is promising to make imaging studies more robust toward incomplete 
clinical information.

OBJECTIVE: The TOPAZ-1 trial reported a significant survival benefit of 
durvalumab in combination with chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of 
biliary tract cancer (BTC). However, no studies have evaluated the economics of 
this treatment option. The aim of this study was to assess the cost 
effectiveness of durvalumab plus chemotherapy compared to placebo plus 
chemotherapy from the perspective of US and Chinese payers.
METHODS: Based on clinical data from the TOPAZ-1 trial, a Markov model was 
developed to simulate 10-year life expectancy and total healthcare costs for 
patients with BTC. The treatment group received durvalumab in combination with 
chemotherapy and the control group received placebo plus chemotherapy. The 
primary outcomes analyzed included quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). Uncertainty in the analysis 
results was assessed by sensitivity analysis.
RESULTS: For US payers, the placebo plus chemotherapy group had a total cost of 
$56,157.05 and a utility of 1.10 QALYs, while the durvalumab plus chemotherapy 
group had a total cost of $217,069.25, a utility of 1.52 QALYs, resulting in an 
ICER of $381,864.39/QALY. For Chinese payers, the ICER of durvalumab plus 
chemotherapy group was $367,608.51/QALY. Sensitivity analysis showed that the 
analysis was most sensitive to the price of durvalumab. For US and Chinese 
payers, under the respective willing to pay thresholds, the likelihood of the 
durvalumab plus chemotherapy arm being cost-effective was 0%.
CONCLUSIONS: Both in China and in the US, durvalumab in combination with 
chemotherapy is not a cost-effective option for the first-line treatment of BTC 
compared with chemotherapy.

Dyspnea is one of the most common symptoms in oncological patients with greater 
prevalence in lung cancer and advanced disease states. Causes of dyspnea can be 
directly or indirectly associated with cancer, anti-neoplastic therapies and 
comorbidities unrelated to cancer. Routine screening of dyspnea is suggested for 
all oncological patients by using unidimensional, simple scales and 
multidimensional tools to capture more domains affected by this symptom and to 
assess the effectiveness of interventions. The first step in the treatment 
algorithm of dyspnea is the identification of potentially reversible causes; if 
no specific cause is depicted, symptomatic treatment with non-pharmacological 
and pharmacological interventions is suggested. Referral to palliative care and 
continuous palliative sedation are the last resort in patients with a very 
limited life expectancy of not more than a few days for symptomatic relief and 
to decrease of the distress of patients and caregivers.

INTRODUCTION: The lower rates of cardiovascular disease in Southern Europe could 
be partially explained by the low prevalence of lipid-rich atheroma plaques. 
Consumption of certain foods affects the progression and severity of 
atherosclerosis. We investigated whether the isocaloric inclusion of walnuts 
within an atherogenic diet prevents phenotypes predicting unstable atheroma 
plaque in a mouse model of accelerated atherosclerosis.
METHODS: Apolipoprotein E-deficient male mice (10-week-old) were randomized to 
receive a control diet (9.6% of energy as fat, n = 14), a palm oil-based 
high-fat diet (43% of energy as fat, n = 15), or an isocaloric diet in which 
part of palm oil was replaced by walnuts in a dose equivalent to 30 g/day in 
humans (n = 14). All diets contained 0.2% cholesterol.
RESULTS: After 15 weeks of intervention, there were no differences in size and 
extension in aortic atherosclerosis among groups. Compared to control diet, palm 
oil-diet induced features predicting unstable atheroma plaque (higher lipid 
content, necrosis, and calcification), and more advanced lesions (Stary score). 
Walnut inclusion attenuated these features. Palm oil-based diet also boosted 
inflammatory aortic storm (increased expression of chemokines, cytokines, 
inflammasome components, and M1 macrophage phenotype markers) and promoted 
defective efferocytosis. Such response was not observed in the walnut group. The 
walnut group's differential activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB; 
downregulated) and Nrf2 (upregulated) in the atherosclerotic lesion could 
explain these findings.
CONCLUSION: The isocaloric inclusion of walnuts in an unhealthy high-fat diet 
promotes traits predicting stable advanced atheroma plaque in mid-life mice.

Treatment of Severe Aortic Valve Stenosis: Impact of Patient Sex and Life 
Expectancy on Treatment Choice.

WA, US.

In adults with severe aortic stenosis, sex and age differences in symptoms and 
diagnosis may lead to delays in intervention. Choice of intervention partly 
depends on expected longevity because bioprosthetic valves have limited 
durability, particularly in younger patients. Current guidelines recommend the 
following: a mechanical valve in younger adults (aged <50 years) if lifelong 
anticoagulation is possible and acceptable and a valve-sparing procedure is not 
possible; surgical mechanical or bioprosthetic aortic valve replacement (SAVR) 
in adults aged 50-65 years; and transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) 
for those aged >80 years based on lower mortality and morbidity compared to SAVR 
and adequate valve durability. For patients aged 65-80 years, the choice between 
TAVI and a bioprosthetic SAVR depends on expected longevity, which is greater in 
women than men, as well as associated cardiac and noncardiac conditions, 
valvular and vascular anatomy, estimated risk of SAVR versus TAVI and expected 
complications and patient preferences.

PURPOSE: There are limited data regarding using stereotactic body radiation 
therapy (SBRT) in the postprostatectomy setting. Here, we present a preliminary 
analysis of a prospective phase II trial that aimed to evaluate the safety and 
efficacy of postprostatectomy SBRT for adjuvant or early salvage therapy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between May 2018 and May 2020, 41 patients fulfilled 
inclusion criteria and were stratified into 3 groups: group I (adjuvant), 
prostate-specific antigen (PSA) < 0.2 ng/mL with high-risk features including 
positive surgical margins, seminal vesicle invasion, or extracapsular extension; 
group II (salvage), with PSA ≥ 0.2 ng/mL but < 2 ng/mL; or group III 
(oligometastatic), with PSA ≥ 0.2 ng/mL but < 2 ng/mL and up to 3 sites of nodal 
or bone metastases. Androgen deprivation therapy was not offered to group I. 
Androgen deprivation therapy was offered for 6 months for group II and 18 months 
for group III patients. SBRT dose to the prostate bed was 30 to 32 Gy in 5 
fractions. Baseline-adjusted physician reported toxicities (Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events), patient reported quality-of-life (Expanded 
Prostate Index Composite, Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information 
System), and American Urologic Association scores were evaluated for all 
patients.
RESULTS: The median follow-up was 23 months (range, 10-37). SBRT was adjuvant in 
8 (20%) patients, salvage in 28 (68%), and salvage with the presence of 
oligometastases in 5 (12%) patients. Urinary, bowel, and sexual quality of life 
domains remained high after SBRT. Patients tolerated SBRT with no grade 3 or 
higher (3+) gastrointestinal or genitourinary toxicities. The baseline adjusted 
acute and late toxicity grade 2 genitourinary (urinary incontinence) rate was 
2.4% (1/41) and 12.2% (5/41). At 2 years, clinical disease control was 95%, and 
biochemical control was 73%. Among the 2 clinical failures, 1 was a regional 
node and the other a bone metastasis. Oligometastatic sites were salvaged 
successfully with SBRT. There were no in-target failures.
CONCLUSIONS: Postprostatectomy SBRT was very well tolerated in this prospective 
cohort, with no significant effect on quality of life metrics postirradiation, 
while providing excellent clinical disease control.

BACKGROUND: Precise breast cancer-related mortality forecasts are required for 
public health program and healthcare service planning. A number of stochastic 
model-based approaches for predicting mortality have been developed. The trends 
shown by mortality data from various diseases and countries are critical to the 
effectiveness of these models. This study illustrates the unconventional 
statistical method for estimating and predicting the mortality risk between the 
early-onset and screen-age/late-onset breast cancer population in China and 
Pakistan using the Lee-Carter model.
METHODS: Longitudinal death data for female breast cancer from 1990 to 2019 
obtained from the Global Burden of Disease study database were used to compare 
statistical approach between early-onset (age group, 25-49 years) and 
screen-age/late-onset (age group, 50-84 years) population. We evaluated the 
model performance both within (training period, 1990-2010) and outside (test 
period, 2011-2019) data forecast accuracy using the different error measures and 
graphical analysis. Finally, using the Lee-Carter model, we predicted the 
general index for the time period (2011 to 2030) and derived corresponding life 
expectancy at birth for the female breast cancer population using life tables.
RESULTS: Study findings revealed that the Lee-Carter approach to predict breast 
cancer mortality rate outperformed in the screen-age/late-onset compared with 
that in the early-onset population in terms of goodness of fit and within and 
outside forecast accuracy check. Moreover, the trend in forecast error was 
decreasing gradually in the screen-age/late-onset compared with that in the 
early-onset breast cancer population in China and Pakistan. Furthermore, we 
observed that this approach had provided almost comparable results between the 
early-onset and screen-age/late-onset population in forecast accuracy for more 
varying mortality behavior over time like in Pakistan. Both the early-onset and 
screen-age/late-onset populations in Pakistan were expected to have an increase 
in breast cancer mortality by 2030. whereas, for China, it was expected to 
decrease in the early-onset population.
CONCLUSION: The Lee-Carter model can be used to estimate breast cancer mortality 
and so to project future life expectancy at birth, especially in the 
screen-age/late-onset population. As a result, it is suggested that this 
approach may be useful and convenient for predicting cancer-related mortality 
even when epidemiological and demographic disease data sets are limited. 
According to model predictions for breast cancer mortality, improved health 
facilities for disease diagnosis, control, and prevention are required to reduce 
the disease's future burden, particularly in less developed countries.

OBJECTIVE: To better understand the challenges of designing therapies to treat 
damaged vocal fold lamina propria, it is essential to understand the biophysical 
and pathophysiological mechanisms involved in vocal fold development, 
maintenance, injury, and aging. This review critically analyses these points to 
try and direct future efforts and new strategies toward science-based solutions.
DATA SOURCES & REVIEW METHODS: MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, and Wed of Science 
databases were used to identify relevant literature. A scoping review was 
performed following the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and 
meta-analyses extension for scoping reviews checklist.
RESULTS: The layered arrangement of the vocal fold, develops during early 
childhood and is maintained during adulthood unless injury occurs. The stellate 
cells of the macular flava are likely to be important in this process. The 
capacity for vocal fold regeneration and growth is lost during adulthood and 
repair results in the deposition of fibrous tissue from resident fibroblasts. 
With advancing age, viscoelastic tissue declines, possibly due to cell 
senescence. Strategies aimed at replacing fibrous tissue within the vocal folds 
must either stimulate resident cells or implant new cells to secrete healthy 
extracellular protein. Injection of basic fibroblast growth factor is the most 
widely reported therapy that aims to achieve this.
CONCLUSIONS: The pathways involved in vocal fold development, maintenance and 
aging are incompletely understood. Improved understanding has the potential to 
identify new treatment targets that could potentially overcome loss of vocal 
fold vibratory tissue.

BACKGROUND: Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) results from a loss-of-function 
mutation in the SMN1 gene. SMA patients suffer progressive motor disability, 
although no intellectual impairments have been described. Three drugs have been 
recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European 
Medicines Agency (EMA). These drugs result in longer life expectancy for SMA 
type 1 (SMA1) patients.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to assess longitudinally the 
psychomotor development of patients with SMA1 treated after the symptom onset 
and of patients treated presymptomatically.
DESIGN: Longitudinal, monocentric, noninterventional, prospective study.
METHODS: Our study included 11 SMA1 patients and seven presymptomatic SMA 
patients. The SMA1 patients were treated with an approved drug beginning after 
onset of symptoms; treatment for the presymptomatic patients was begun before 
symptom onset. They were longitudinally evaluated between September 2018 and 
January 2022 using the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development™ - Third 
Edition.
RESULTS: At each time point, all patients treated presymptomatically scored 
above those treated postsymptomatically on the motor scale. The cognitive scores 
of six of the seven patients treated presymptomatically were average; one 
patient was in the low average range. In the 11 postsymptomatically treated 
patients, four scored either in the low average or the abnormal range on the 
cognitive scale, but a positive trend was observed during the follow-up.
CONCLUSION: A significant proportion of patients treated postsymptomatically 
scored below average on cognitive and communicative scales, with most 
significant concerns raised about the age of 1 year. Our study indicates that 
intellectual development should be considered as an important outcome in treated 
SMA1 patients. Cognitive and communicative evaluations should be performed as 
part of standard of care, and guidance should be provided to parents for optimal 
stimulation.

PURPOSE: Long-term hospitalized patients with schizophrenia (SCZ) are vulnerable 
to physical illness, leading to impaired life expectancy and treatment outcomes. 
There are few studies on the influence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease 
(NAFLD) in long-term hospitalized patients. This study aimed to investigate the 
prevalence of and influence factors for NAFLD in hospitalized patients with SCZ.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: This cross-sectional retrospective study included 310 
patients who had experienced long-term hospitalization for SCZ. NAFLD was 
diagnosed based on the results of abdominal ultrasonography. The T-test, 
Mann-Whitney U-test, correlation analysis, and logistic regression analysis were 
used to determine the influence factors for NAFLD.
RESULTS: Among the 310 patients who had experienced long-term hospitalization 
for SCZ, the prevalence of NAFLD was 54.84%. Antipsychotic polypharmacy (APP), 
body mass index (BMI), hypertension, diabetes, total cholesterol (TC), 
apolipoprotein B (ApoB), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT), triglycerides (TG), uric acid, blood glucose, 
gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), high-density lipoprotein, 
neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio significantly 
differed between the NAFLD and non-NAFLD groups (all P<0.05). Hypertension, 
diabetes, APP, BMI, TG, TC, AST, ApoB, ALT, and GGT were positively correlated 
with NAFLD (all P<0.05). The results of the logistic regression analysis 
indicated that APP, diabetes, BMI, ALT, and ApoB were the influence factors for 
NAFLD in patients with SCZ.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest a high prevalence of NAFLD among patients 
hospitalized long-term due to severe SCZ symptoms. Moreover, a history of 
diabetes, APP, overweight/obese status, and increased levels of ALT and ApoB 
were identified as negative factors for NAFLD in these patients. These findings 
may provide a theoretical basis for the prevention and treatment of NAFLD in 
patients with SCZ and contribute to the development of novel targeted 
treatments.

The current liver allocation system may be disadvantaging younger adult 
recipients as it does not incorporate the donor-recipient age difference. Given 
the longer life expectancy of younger recipients, the influences of older donor 
grafts on their long-term prognosis should be elucidated. This study sought to 
reveal the long-term prognostic influence of the donor-recipient age difference 
in young adult recipients. Adult patients who received initial liver transplants 
from deceased donors between 2002 and 2021 were identified from the UNOS 
database. Young recipients (patients 45 years old or below) were categorized 
into 4 groups: donor age younger than the recipient, 0-9 years older, 10-19 
years older, or 20 years older or above. Older recipients were defined as 
patients 65 years old or above. To examine the influence of the age difference 
in long-term survivors, conditional graft survival analysis was conducted on 
both younger and older recipients. Among 91,952 transplant recipients, 15,170 
patients were 45 years old or below (16.5%); these were categorized into 6,114 
(40.3%), 3,315 (21.9%), 2,970 (19.6%), and 2,771 (18.3%) for groups 1-4, 
respectively. Group 1 demonstrated the highest probability of survival, followed 
by groups 2, 3, and 4 for the actual graft survival and conditional graft 
survival analyses. In younger recipients who survived at least 5 years 
post-transplant, inferior long-term survival was observed when there was an age 
difference of 10 years or above (86.9% vs. 80.6%, log-rank p <0.01), whereas 
there was no difference in older recipients (72.6% vs. 74.2%, log-rank p =0.89). 
In younger patients who are not in emergent need of a transplant, preferential 
allocation of younger aged donor offers would optimize organ utility by 
increasing postoperative graft survival time.

Technical University, Trabzon, Turkey.

Today, it is known that the elderly population is increasing rapidly with the 
quality of life. The United Nations estimate that one in six people will be 
65 years or older by 2050. This situation causes interest in the old age period 
to increase day by day. In parallel with this, studies on the aging process have 
grown rapidly. Especially the health problems accompanying extended life 
expectancy and its treatment have become the focus of researchers in recent 
years. It is a known fact that some sensory and physiological changes in old age 
affect the quality of oral food intake and food taste. This may lead to 
inadequate nutritional intake and even rejection of food intake in the elderly. 
Therefore, severe malnutrition and sarcopenia occur in these individuals, and 
their life span is shortened. In this review, the effects of aging-related 
oropharyngeal and esophageal changes and problems on oral food intake will be 
evaluated. Our increasing knowledge on this subject will contribute to 
healthcare professionals in the prevention and treatment of health problems such 
as malnutrition that may occur during the aging process. In this review, a 
literature search was conducted with the keywords "older" or "elderly" or 
"geriatrics" and "nutrition" or "malnutrition" and "oropharyngeal functions" or 
"esophageal functions" in PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar electronic 
databases. KEY TEACHING POINTSSome changes may occur in oropharyngeal and 
esophageal functions with aging.Sensory and physiological changes in the aging 
process affect oral food intake and nutritional status.Impairments in oral food 
intake in elderly individuals can lead to malnutrition and 
sarcopenia.Age-related changes affecting oral food intake increase the 
importance of nutritionists with the increase in the elderly population.

IMPORTANCE: The average life expectancy has increased substantially in the past 
few decades in most industrialized countries; however, not all of the increased 
life expectancy is being spent in optimal health, especially among individuals 
with low socioeconomic status.
OBJECTIVE: To quantify the associations between levels of cardiovascular health
