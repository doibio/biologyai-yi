Recently, for many health economics researchers, empirical estimation of the 
monetary valuation of a quality-adjusted life year (QALY) has become an 
important endeavour. Different philosophical and practical approaches to this 
have emerged. On the one hand, there is a view that, with health-care budgets 
set centrally, decision-making bodies within the system can iterate, from 
observation of a series of previous decisions, towards the value of a QALY, thus 
searching for such a value. Alternatively, and more consistent with the approach 
taken in other public sectors, individual members of the public are surveyed 
with the aim of directly eliciting a preference-based - also known as a 
willingness-to-pay-based (WTP-based) - value of a QALY. While the former is 
based on supply-side factors and the latter on demand, both in fact suffer from 
informational deficiencies. Sole reliance on either would necessitate an 
acceptance or accommodation of chronic inefficiencies in health-care resource 
allocation. On the basis of this observation, this paper makes the case that in 
order to approach optimal decision making in health-care provision, a framework 
incorporating and thus, to a degree, reconciling these two approaches is to be 
preferred.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: As life expectancy increases, there are greater numbers of 
patients with liver diseases who require surgery or transplantation. Livers of 
older patients have significantly less reparative capacity following ischemia 
and reperfusion (I/R) injury, which occurs during these operations. There are no 
strategies to reduce the age-dependent I/R injury. We investigated the role of 
autophagy in the age dependence of sensitivity to I/R injury.
METHODS: Hepatocytes and livers from 3- and 26-month-old mice were subjected to 
in vitro and in vivo I/R, respectively. We analyzed changes in autophagy-related 
proteins (Atg). Mitochondrial dysfunction was visualized using confocal and 
intravital multi-photon microscopy of isolated hepatocytes and livers from 
anesthetized mice, respectively.
RESULTS: Immunoblot, autophagic flux, genetic, and imaging analyses all 
associated the increase in sensitivity to I/R injury with age with decreased 
autophagy and subsequent mitochondrial dysfunction due to calpain-mediated loss 
of Atg4B. Overexpression of either Atg4B or Beclin-1 recovered Atg4B, increased 
autophagy, blocked the onset of the mitochondrial permeability transition, and 
suppressed cell death after I/R in old hepatocytes. Coimmunoprecipitation 
analysis of hepatocytes and Atg3-knockout cells showed an interaction between 
Beclin-1 and Atg3, a protein required for autophagosome formation. Intravital 
multi-photon imaging revealed that overexpression of Beclin-1 or Atg4B 
attenuated autophagic defects and mitochondrial dysfunction in livers of older 
mice after I/R.
CONCLUSIONS: Loss of Atg4B in livers of old mice increases their sensitivity to 
I/R injury. Increasing autophagy might ameliorate liver damage and restore 
mitochondrial function after I/R.

OBJECTIVES: To undertake a fresh examination of the relationship between income 
inequality and population health for a group of Islamic countries using recent 
information derived from data resource sites from the World Bank and Islamic 
countries.
STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional data on different measures of income distribution 
(prosperity, health care, women's role and environment) and indicators of 
population health were used to illuminate this issue.
METHODS: The relationship between income inequality and population health for a 
group of Islamic countries was tested using recent information derived from data 
resource sites from the World Bank and Islamic countries. After consideration of 
previous studies, seven dependent variables were determined and tested in six 
equation formats.
RESULTS: According to the equations, the urban population percentage and gross 
domestic product are the most important significant variables that affect life 
expectancy and the infant mortality rate in Islamic countries. The income 
distribution coefficient, regardless of the type of measure, was almost 
insignificant in all equations.
CONCLUSIONS: In selected Islamic countries, income level has a positive effect 
on population health, but the level of income distribution is not significant. 
Among the other dependent variables (e.g. different measures of income 
distribution, health care, role of women and environment), only environment and 
education had significant effects. Most of the Islamic countries studied are 
considered to be poorly developed.

Comment in
    Arthroscopy. 2011 Oct;27(10):1313-6.

PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine the cost-effectiveness of 
knee arthroscopy and anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction.
METHODS: Retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data from a 
single-surgeon, institutional review board-approved outcomes registry included 2 
cohorts: surgically treated knee arthroscopy and ACL reconstruction patients. 
Our outcome measure is cost-effectiveness (cost of a quality-adjusted life-year 
[QALY]). The QALY is calculated by multiplying difference in health-related 
quality of life, before and after treatment, by life expectancy. Health-related 
quality of life is measured by use of the Quality of Well-Being scale, which has 
been validated for cost-effectiveness analysis. Costs are facility charges per 
the facility cost-to-charges ratio plus surgeon fee. Sensitivity analyses are 
performed to determine the effect of variations in costs or outcomes.
RESULTS: There were 93 knee arthroscopy and 35 ACL reconstruction patients 
included at a mean follow-up of 2.1 years. Cost per QALY was $5,783 for 
arthroscopy and $10,326 for ACL reconstruction (2009 US dollars). Sensitivity 
analysis shows that our results are robust (relatively insensitive) to 
variations in costs or outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: Knee arthroscopy and knee ACL reconstruction are very 
cost-effective.

Solid organ transplantation has become the first line of treatment for a growing 
number of life-threatening pediatric illnesses. With improved survival, research 
into the long-term outcome of transplant recipients has become important to 
clinicians. Adherence to medical instructions remains a challenge, particularly 
in the adolescent population. New immunosuppressant approaches promise to expand 
organ transplantation in additional directions. Extension of transplantation 
into replacement of organs such as faces and hands raises complex ethical 
issues.

Screening for malignancy after augmentation cystoplasty in children with spina 
bifida: a decision analysis.

Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA.

PURPOSE: Augmentation cystoplasty is the mainstay of surgical treatment for 
medically refractory neurogenic bladder in patients with spina bifida. Concerns 
regarding an increased risk of malignancy have prompted many centers to consider 
routine postoperative screening. We examine the potential cost-effectiveness of 
such screening.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A Markov model was used to compare 2 screening strategies 
among patients with spina bifida after cystoplasty, namely annual screening 
cystoscopy and cytology and usual care. Model parameters were informed via a 
systematic review of post-augmentation malignancy and cost estimates from 
published reports or government sources.
RESULTS: In a hypothetical cohort the individual increase in life expectancy for 
the entire cohort was 2.3 months with an average lifetime cost of $55,200 per 
capita, for an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $273,718 per life-year 
gained. One-way and two-way sensitivity analyses suggest the screening strategy 
could be cost effective if the annual rate of cancer development were more than 
0.26% (12.8% lifetime risk) or there were a greater than 50% increase in 
screening effectiveness and cancer risk after augmentation. After adjusting for 
multiple levels of uncertainty the screening strategy had only an 11% chance of 
being cost effective at a $100,000 per life-year threshold or a less than 3% 
chance of being cost effective at $100,000 per quality adjusted life-year.
CONCLUSIONS: Annual screening for malignancy among patients with spina bifida 
with cystoplasty using cystoscopy and cytology is unlikely to be cost effective 
at commonly accepted willingness to pay thresholds. This conclusion is sensitive 
to a higher than expected risk of malignancy and to highly optimistic estimates 
of screening effectiveness.

Netherlands. a.tranduy@maastrichtuniversity.nl

OBJECTIVE: To develop a modelling framework which can simulate long-term quality 
of life, societal costs and cost-effectiveness as affected by sequential drug 
treatment strategies for ankylosing spondylitis (AS).
METHODS: Discrete event simulation paradigm was selected for model development. 
Drug efficacy was modelled as changes in disease activity (Bath Ankylosing 
Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI)) and functional status (Bath 
Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI)), which were linked to costs and 
health utility using statistical models fitted based on an observational AS 
cohort. Published clinical data were used to estimate drug efficacy and time to 
events. Two strategies were compared: (1) five available non-steroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs (strategy 1) and (2) same as strategy 1 plus two tumour 
necrosis factor α inhibitors (strategy 2). 13,000 patients were followed up 
individually until death. For probability sensitivity analysis, Monte Carlo 
simulations were performed with 1000 sets of parameters sampled from the 
appropriate probability distributions.
RESULTS: The models successfully generated valid data on treatments, BASDAI, 
BASFI, utility, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and costs at time points 
with intervals of 1-3 months during the simulation length of 70 years. 
Incremental cost per QALY gained in strategy 2 compared with strategy 1 was 
€35,186. At a willingness-to-pay threshold of €80,000, it was 99.9% certain that 
strategy 2 was cost-effective.
CONCLUSIONS: The modelling framework provides great flexibility to implement 
complex algorithms representing treatment selection, disease progression and 
changes in costs and utilities over time of patients with AS. Results obtained 
from the simulation are plausible.

Administrative Region, China. rori0610@graduate.hku.hk

Lifespan prolongation is a common desire of the human race. With advances in 
biotechnology, the mechanism of aging has been gradually unraveled, laying the 
theoretical basis of nucleic acid therapy for lifespan prolongation. 
Regretfully, clinically applicable interventions do not exist without the 
efforts of converting theory into action, and it is the latter that has been far 
from adequately addressed at the moment. This was demonstrated by a database 
search on PubMed and Web of Science, from which only seven studies published 
between 2000 and 2010 were found to directly touch on the development of nucleic 
acid therapy for anti-aging and/or longevity enhancing purposes. In light of 
this, the objective of this article is to overview the current understanding of 
the intimate association between genes and longevity, and to bring the prospect 
of nucleic acid therapy for lifespan prolongation to light.

STUDY DESIGN: Vertebroplasty was simulated on a pig model.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the risk of neoplastic tissue migration into lungs during 
vertebroplasty.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The application of vertebroplasty in spinal 
metastasis is not well documented. The risk of neoplastic tissue migration into 
the lungs during vertebroplasty remains unknown.
METHODS: A cancer model was built in 11 Landrace pigs (50 kg) by injecting 
99mTc-labeled albumin macroaggregates into the center of L5 and L6 prior to 
vertebroplasty. Continuous scintigraphic imaging was performed with 1-minute 
frames over the lungs and vertebrae before and after injection to ensure steady 
state and baseline. We surveyed free TcO4- in thyroid. Twenty minutes after the 
99mTc injection, 2-level vertebroplasty was performed at L5 and L6 with 3 
Jamshidi needles in each vertebra. Into each vertebra, on average, 2.8 ± 1.1 mL 
of poly(methyl methacrylate) cement (Depuy CMW, Blackpool, UK) was injected. 
Quantitative scintigrams were obtained within 90 minutes after vertebroplasty. 
X-rays and quantitative computed tomography scans quantified cement 
distribution. Means of 99mTc activity before and after vertebroplasty were 
compared in a paired t test.
RESULTS: In this cancer model, we found an 80% risk of tissue migration to the 
lungs when performing vertebroplasty. In average, the study showed a significant 
amount of macroaggregate migration of 1.87% total range from 0% to 8% (CI: 
0.05%-0.37%) with P = 0.045. There was no free TcO4- in the thyroid. Despite the 
standardized procedure, we found a large interindividual variation of pulmonary 
embolism.
CONCLUSION: It is demonstrated that there exists a significant risk of exporting 
neoplastic disease or fatty tissue to the lungs when performing vertebroplasty. 
A similar adverse effect can be expected with balloon kyphoplasty. In patients 
with metastatic disease, vertebroplasty should be limited to those with short 
life expectancy.

BACKGROUND: Aging is a fundamental biological process. Characterization of 
genetic and environmental factors that influence lifespan is a crucial step 
toward understanding the mechanisms of aging at the organism level. To capture 
the different effects of genetic and environmental factors on lifespan, 
appropriate statistical analyses are needed.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We developed an online application for survival 
analysis (OASIS) that helps conduct various novel statistical tasks involved in 
analyzing survival data in a user-friendly manner. OASIS provides standard 
survival analysis results including Kaplan-Meier estimates and mean/median 
survival time by taking censored survival data. OASIS also provides various 
statistical tests including comparison of mean survival time, overall survival 
curve, and survival rate at specific time point. To visualize survival data, 
OASIS generates survival and log cumulative hazard plots that enable researchers 
to easily interpret their experimental results. Furthermore, we provide 
statistical methods that can analyze variances among survival datasets. In 
addition, users can analyze proportional effects of risk factors on survival.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: OASIS provides a platform that is essential to 
facilitate efficient statistical analyses of survival data in the field of aging 
research. Web application and a detailed description of algorithms are 
accessible from http://sbi.postech.ac.kr/oasis.

Changes in mortality after first psychiatric admission: a 20-year prospective 
longitudinal clinical study.

Nome S(1), Holsten F.

(1)Centre for Research and Education in Forensic Psychiatry, Haukeland 
University Hospital, Sandviken, Bergen, Norway.

OBJECTIVE: To examine changes in the mortality of patients admitted to a 
Norwegian psychiatric hospital from 1985 to 2003: this period saw profound 
changes in structure and organization of the mental healthcare system.
METHOD: A 20-year prospective longitudinal, record linkage study of all patients 
admitted to a psychiatric hospital with sector responsibility from 1985 to 2003.
RESULTS: Excess mortality was found for the patient group. Overall standardized 
mortality ratio (SMR) (95% confidence interval, CI) was 2.85 (2.53-3.07)/2.15 
(1.94-2.41) for male/female patients. One third of the patients who died in the 
study period died within 2 years after first admission, and 45% of the deaths 
happened within 2 years after last discharge. The median age at death decreased 
in the study period for patients who were younger than 65 years at their first 
admission. The median difference of lost years of life for the patients younger 
than 65 years at first admittance was 26.95/23.96 years for male/female 
patients. SMR increased for the youngest cohorts during the study period over 
time. From 1985 to 2003, SMR increased dramatically for both genders.
CONCLUSION: Patients admitted to a Norwegian psychiatric hospital for their 
first stay during 1985-2003 suffered increased excess mortality, whereas 
mortality in the general population decreased. The mortality was highest in the 
first 2 years after admission. Despite profound changes in the mental healthcare 
system, the mortality gap increased in the study period and was highest in the 
youngest birth cohorts.

Author information:
(1)Department of Public Health, Ghent University, Belgium.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the European community-based 
project '10 000 Steps Ghent', an intervention that resulted in a significant 
decrease in sedentary time and a significant increase in step counts (896 
steps/d) and self-reported walking (66 min/week).
DESIGN: An age- and gender-dependent Markov model, with a time horizon of 20 
years and a cycle length of 1 year, estimating the development of diabetes, 
cardiovascular events and colorectal cancer.
SETTING: All individuals started in a health state free of events. The effect of 
the intervention was based on published risk reductions related to increased 
walking time. Costs and utility decrements related to events were obtained from 
published literature. The impact of the uncertainty of the parameters on 
incremental costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALY) were assessed with 
one-way sensitivity analyses and a Monte Carlo analysis.
SUBJECTS: Cohort representing the population reached by the intervention (266 
adults aged 25-75 years with a mean age of 48·2 (sd 13·1) years, 45·6 % men, 
64·6 % highly educated, 70·0 % employed).
RESULTS: Implementing the community-based programme increased average QALY by 
0·16 and 0·11 for men and women, respectively. The total costs decreased by 
approximately 576€ and 427€, respectively. Hence, for both genders the 
intervention programme was dominant. The sensitivity analyses did not change the 
conclusion of dominance.
CONCLUSION: The community-based '10 000 Steps Ghent' campaign is a dominant 
intervention. Sensitivity analyses have proved the robustness of the results; 
hence implementing this intervention on a population-based level could lead to 
improved health outcomes and reduced costs.

BACKGROUND: Fox Chase Cancer Center Partners (FCCCP) performs an annual quality 
review of affiliate practices based on National Comprehensive Cancer Network 
(NCCN) guidelines. Given recent treatment advances, we initiated this medical 
record review in elderly patients with stage III colon cancer to measure 
compliance with these guidelines.
METHODS: Medical records of 124 patients age ≥ 65 diagnosed with stage III colon 
cancer between 2003 and 2006 were reviewed. Metrics were developed and based on 
NCCN guidelines for workup and staging, treatment, and gerontology. 
Documentation was reviewed via paper (13 sites) and electronic record (2 sites).
RESULTS: High compliance with staging and workup guidelines was noted with chest 
imaging (100%), stage (98%), computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen/pelvis 
(93%), pathology (91%), and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA; 91%). Activities of 
daily living were documented commonly (83%) but colonoscopy less (75%). Age and 
life expectancy were discussed with the patient in only 49%. Nearly all patients 
(123 of 124 patients) received adjuvant chemotherapy, with 76 patients (61%) 
receiving oxaliplatin. Common regimens were FOLFOX (oxaliplatin plus 
infusional/bolus 5-fluorouracil and folinic acid) 54%, 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin 
(5-FU/LV; 19%), and capecitabine (12%). Reasons for excluding oxaliplatin were 
comorbidity (68%), age (19%), and not specified (13%). Three-quarters of the 
patients had ≥ 12 lymph nodes sampled and 56% identified the radial margin. 
Nearly all patients (115 = 93%) received surveillance with history and physical 
and CEA. Surveillance CT was performed in 78% of the patients.
CONCLUSIONS: A quality review of community oncology practices can assess 
implementation of treatment advances. Guideline compliance for elderly patients 
with stage III colon cancer is generally high. Forty percent did not receive 
oxaliplatin and documentation of life expectancy was infrequent. Further study 
of oncologist decision making for elderly colon cancer patients is warranted.

OBJECTIVE: To study how the choice of national EQ-5D tariff may affect utility 
and incremental quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) estimates.
METHODS: South Swedish rheumatoid arthritis patients in an observational study, 
starting and continuing anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF) monotherapy (n=54) or 
anti-TNF plus methotrexate (n=215) for 1 year during May 2002 to April 2009, 
were included. EQ-5D questionnaires were completed at baseline, 3, 6 and 12 
months. Utilities and accumulated QALY were compared using the UK, US and Danish 
EQ-5D tariffs. Utilities for all 243 possible EQ-5D health states were also 
compared.
RESULTS: US utilities were generally higher than UK, with Danish falling in 
between. A substantial 1-year mean utility improvement was seen in both study 
groups using all tariffs (UK 0.28 vs 0.29; US 0.18 vs 0.19; Danish 0.20 vs 
0.22). Adjusting for baseline differences between groups, the incremental QALY 
gain of combined treatment was 0.09 using the UK tariff, while 0.06 according to 
both US and Danish tariffs. Inter-tariff disagreement in utility and accumulated 
QALY varied irregularly across the range of utilities.
CONCLUSIONS: Applying different national EQ-5D tariffs to the same data may 
result in substantially different incremental QALY estimates, crucial knowledge 
when interpreting cost-utility analyses. Studies using different tariffs cannot 
be directly compared.

OBJECTIVES: A probabilistic model was developed to determine the 
cost-effectiveness of three biologics, etanercept, infliximab and adalimumab, 
compared with palliative care for the treatment of active and progressive PsA in 
patients who have an inadequate response to standard treatment (including 
DMARDs).
METHODS: A previous model was revised to evaluate the impact of biologics on 
both skin and joint disease and to include new evidence from the clinical review 
and evidence synthesis. Initial response to biologics was determined using the 
PsA response criteria. The impact of biologics on the arthritis component of the 
disease is then modelled via a change in the HAQ and the impact of the psoriasis 
component measured using the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index.
RESULTS: For PsA patients with mild to moderate skin disease, the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for etanercept vs palliative care is around £18 
000, and the ICER for infliximab vs etanercept is around £44 000 per 
quality-adjusted life year (QALY). Adalimumab is extendedly dominated. The 
probability that etanercept is cost effective is 0.436 at a threshold of £20 000 
per QALY. Etanercept is also likely to be cost effective for patients with 
moderate to severe psoriasis or negligible skin involvement.
CONCLUSIONS: Further investigation is required to reduce uncertainties around a 
number of model parameters, in particular the length of time over which 
biologics are assumed to be effective and the progression of HAQ on and off 
treatment.

Netherlands.

Retroperitoneal bleeding is relatively rare and a potentially life-threatening 
condition with significant mortality. Early recognition requires a high index of 
suspicion. Increased life expectancy, the widespread use of anticoagulants, and 
the rise of endovascular interventions have caused an increase in the incidence 
of retroperitoneal bleeding. We present a case of a 74-year-old woman who died 
because of retroperitoneal bleeding caused by retroperitoneal metastasis of a 
sigmoid carcinoma with angioinvasive growth into a lumbar artery. In addition we 
discuss etiology, diagnostic management, and treatment strategy.

[The genes of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular diseases].

[Article in Russian]

Malygina NA, Kostomarova IV, Vodolagina NN, Melent'ev IA, Melent'ev AS.

The aim of the work was to study polymorphism of atherosclerosis-related genes 
in patients with different forms of coronary heart disease (CHD) and chronic 
cerebral ischemia (CCI) in comparison with long-living subjects. Analysis 
included the distribution of genotypes and alleles of functional polymorphisms 
of lipid metabolism genes, viz. HindIII--polymorphism of lipoproteinase (LPL) 
gene; HhaI--polymorphism of apoE gene; TaqIB--polymorphism of cholesterol ether 
transfer protein (CETP) gene; I/D--polymorphism of angiotensin converting enzyme 
(ACE) in CHD and CCI patients of different age groups including long livers and 
those presenting with different clinical variants of CHD and CCI (FC II-III 
stable angina of effort, acute myocardial infarction, post-infarction 
cardiosclerosis, acute coronary syndrome) and control subjects. The study 
revealed potential molecular-genetic markers for primary and secondary 
prophylaxis of CHD and CCI. It was shown that DD genotypes of ACE gene, H+/+ of 
LPL gene and E3E4 are associated with an enhanced probability of myocardial 
infarction (IM) in CHD patients and can be regarded as high risk markers. The DD 
genotype is associated with an increased risk of recurrent MI, life-threatening 
post-IM complications and severe cardiac insufficiency as well as peculiar 
personality and behavioural traits (animosity and type A 
behaviour)--psychological risk factors of CHD and predictors of delayed 
application for medical aid. E2 allele of the ApoE gene and H allele of the LPL 
gene occur much more frequently in CHD patients aged above 90 years (long 
livers) than in younger subjects; hence, their value as markers of stable 
ischemic disease. Protective effect in terms of favourable clinical course of 
CCI and life expectancy is especially pronounced in subjects with a combination 
of genotypes with E2E3 + H+H-, E2E2 + H+H-, E3E3 + H-H-genes of ApoE and LPL. 
B2B2 genotype of CETP gene increases the risk of stable CCI and B1B1 genotype of 
CETP gene enhances predisposition to cardiovascular pathology.

Abstract The population characteristics of the louse, Upupicola upupae (Shrank) 
(Mallophaga: Philopteridae: Ishnocera), infesting the Common Hoopae, Upupa epops 
L. (Aves: Upupiformes), were recorded during 2007-08 in District Rampur, Uttar 
Pradesh India. The pattern of frequency distribution of the louse conformed to 
the negative binomial model. The lice and its nits were reared in vitro at 35 ± 
1° C, 75-82 % RH, on a feather diet. The data obtained was used to construct the 
life table and to determine the intrinsic rate of natural increase (0.035 
female/day), the net reproductive rate was 3.67 female eggs/female, the 
generation time was 37 days, and the doubling time of the population was 19 
days. The chaetotaxy of the three nymphal instars has also been noted to record 
their diagnostic characteristics. Information on egg morphology and antennal 
sensilla is also presented.

L’Aquila, Italy.

Hypertension is a leading cardiovascular risk for cardiovascular morbidity and 
mortality. Age is the strongest risk factor for dementia and with the increasing 
life expectancy the number of patients living with dementia worldwide is 
estimated to progressively rise. A number of studies support an association 
between hypertension, particularly in midlife, and the development of cognitive 
disorders and dementia, including Alzheimer's disease. According to this, 
considering hypertension as a possible modifiable risk factor for the cognitive 
decline is of great clinical interest. Treatment of hypertension in midlife 
seems to promote considerable benefits with regard to cardiovascular outcomes. 
Longitudinal studies examining the possible benefit of anti-hypertensive 
treatments on cognitive decline have produced promising results. Nevertheless, 
the results from randomised controlled clinical trials on treatment of 
hypertension are not conclusive for the effect on cognitive decline and 
dementia. New randomized controlled trials are needed to definitively clarify 
clinical advantages and specifically elucidate the relationship between 
anti-hypertensive treatments and cognitive function or dementia.

With a growing number of protein therapeutics being developed, many of them 
exhibiting a short plasma half-life, half-life extension strategies find 
increasing attention by the biotech and pharmaceutical industry. Extension of 
the half-life can help to reduce the number of applications and to lower doses, 
thus are beneficial for therapeutic but also economic reasons. Here, a 
comprehensive overview of currently developed half-life extension strategies is 
provided including those aiming at increasing the hydrodynamic volume of a 
protein drug but also those implementing recycling processes mediated by the 
neonatal Fc receptor.

Factors influencing Australian construction industry apprentices' dietary 
behaviors.

To date there has been a theoretical and empirical gap in workplace-centered 
health promotion research-particularly as it applies to blue-collar men's diets. 
To begin addressing the paucity of research, five qualitative focus groups (N = 
53) were conducted in Australian training colleges to explore the dietary 
behaviors of apprentices. Thematic analysis was used by the researcher who 
concludes that although some apprentices were health conscious and attempted to 
eat healthy foods, many had diets high in saturated fats and sugar. These types 
of diets are associated with increased risks for developing chronic disease and 
are associated with decreased life expectancy. As such it poses a serious 
challenge for health promoters. Apprentices' dietary practices were also found 
to be moderated by convenience, availability, and cost of foods in their 
environment. Their nutritional beliefs, significant others, colleagues in the 
workplace, and their body image also influence their food choices.

PURPOSE: The aim of this study was the health-economic analysis of MR imaging in 
the diagnostics of suspicious prostate carcinoma (PCa) before execution of a 
first biopsy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The health-economic analysis included four steps: 
modeling, determination of probabilities, evaluation, and sensitivity analyses. 
We performed an effectiveness analysis from the patient perspective as well as a 
cost-effectiveness and a cost-utility analysis from the health insurance 
perspective for Austria and Germany. The effectiveness and cost-effectiveness 
analysis used a hypothetical cohort of 100,000 patients. The result parameters 
were number of biopsies, number of detected PCa, and monetary costs. For the 
cost-efficiency analysis, the result parameters, quality-adjusted life years 
(QALYs) and costs, were calculated for an individual patient.
RESULTS: The efficiency analysis showed that MRI before a first biopsy can 
prevent ca. 64,000 unnecessary biopsies/ 100,000 patients. The diagnostic 
efficiency was higher by a factor of 1.7. Due to MRI, eight PCas were 
additionally detected. From a health insurance perspective, MRI was not 
cost-effective. Extra costs of ca. 42 m. € per 100,000 patients and of 650 € per 
prevented biopsy were calculated. The costs per detected PCa were increased by 
1395 €. The attainable QALYs were a little higher for the MRI alternative, which 
was therefore not dominated.
CONCLUSION: Our results do not permit a clear recommendation for or against the 
application of MRI in the diagnostics of PCa. From the patient perspective, it 
is to be endorsed due to the higher medical efficiency. However, it is connected 
with higher health insurance costs.

Healthcare financing: how does Turkey compare?

Akhmedjonov A(1), Güç Y, Akinci F.

Author information:

The authors provide an overview of Turkey's healthcare financing. After 
comparing financing data on Turkey and other Organization for Economic 
Cooperation and Development (OECD) member countries, they examine Turkey's 
performance on a wide range of healthcare input and outcome indicators using 
descriptive data drawn from the World Health Organization, World Bank, OECD, and 
Turkish Statistical Institute. The data analysis shows that Turkey ranks low by 
a number of key healthcare indicators across the OECD countries. Empirical 
analysis suggests that although many factors are associated with improvements in 
healthcare outcomes, a significant part of changes in life expectancy at birth 
are associated with higher spending on healthcare.

BACKGROUND: Impairment in social functioning is a key component of personality 
disorder. Therefore psycho-education and problem solving (PEPS) therapy may 
benefit people with this disorder. Psycho-education aims to educate, build 
rapport, and motivate people for problem solving therapy. Problem solving 
therapy aims to help clients solve interpersonal problems positively and 
rationally, thereby improving social functioning and reducing distress. PEPS 
therapy has been evaluated with community adults with personality disorder in an 
exploratory trial. At the end of treatment, compared to a wait-list control 
group, those treated with PEPS therapy showed better social functioning, as 
measured by the Social Functioning Questionnaire (SFQ). A definitive evaluation 
is now being conducted to determine whether PEPS therapy is a clinically and 
cost-effective treatment for people with personality disorder
METHODS: This is a pragmatic, two-arm, multi-centre, parallel, randomised 
controlled clinical trial. The target population is community-dwelling adults 
with one or more personality disorder, as identified by the International 
Personality Disorder Examination (IPDE). Inclusion criteria are: Living in the 
community (including residential or supported care settings); presence of one or 
more personality disorder; aged 18 or over; proficiency in spoken English; 
capacity to provide informed consent. Exclusion criteria are: Primary diagnosis 
of a functional psychosis; insufficient degree of literacy, comprehension or 
attention to be able to engage in trial therapy and assessments; currently 
engaged in a specific programme of psychological treatment for personality 
disorder or likely to start such treatment during the trial period; currently 
enrolled in any other trial. Suitable participants are randomly allocated to 
PEPS therapy plus treatment as usual (TAU) or TAU only. We aim to recruit 340 
men and women. The primary outcome is social functioning as measured by the SFQ. 
A reduction (i.e., an improvement) of 2 points or more on the SFQ at follow-up 
72 weeks post-randomisation is our pre-specified index of clinically significant 
change. Secondary outcomes include a reduction of unscheduled service usage and 
an increase in scheduled service usage; improved quality of life; and a 
reduction in mental distress.
DISCUSSION: PEPS therapy has potential as an economical, accessible, and 
acceptable intervention for people with personality disorder. The results from 
this randomised controlled trial will tell us if PEPS therapy is effective and 
cost-effective. If so, then it will be a useful treatment for inclusion in a 
broader menu of treatment options for this group of service users.

Rotavirus is the most common cause of severe gastroenteritis in infants and 
young children worldwide. Health-state utility measures used in economic 
evaluations of rotavirus vaccines do not reflect differences between mild and 
severe symptoms of rotavirus gastroenteritis and, therefore, do not adequately 
capture preferences for non-fatal outcomes associated with rotavirus common in 
industrialized countries. This paper describes the development and results of a 
survey specifically designed to develop quality-adjusted time equivalents for 
rotavirus gastroenteritis among a sample of parents with young children in the 
United States as an alternative to conventional QALY measures in assessing 
cost-effectiveness.

Aging is a complex phenotype with multiple determinants but a strong genetic 
component significantly impacts on survival to extreme ages. The dysregulation 
of immune responses occurring with increasing age is believed to contribute to 
human morbidity and mortality. Conversely, some genetic determinants of 
successful aging might reside in those polymorphisms for the immune system genes 
regulating immune responses. Here we examined the main effects of single loci 
and multi-locus interactions to test the hypothesis that the adenosine deaminase 
(ADA) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) genes may influence human 
life-expectancy. ADA (22G>A, rs73598374) and TNF-α (-308G>A, rs1800629; -238G>A, 
rs361525) functional SNPs have been determined for 1071 unrelated healthy 
individuals from Central Italy (18-106 years old) divided into three 
gender-specific age classes defined according to demographic information and 
accounting for the different survivals between sexes: for men (women), the first 
class consists of individuals<66 years old (<73 years old), the second class of 
individuals 66-88 years old (73-91 years old), and the third class of 
individuals>88 years old (>91 years old). Single-locus analysis showed that only 
ADA 22G>A is significantly associated with human life-expectancy in males 
(comparison 1 (age class 2 vs. age class 1), O.R. 1.943, P=0.036; comparison 2 
(age class 3 vs. age class 2), O.R. 0.320, P=0.0056). Age- and gender-specific 
patterns of epistasis between ADA and TNF-α were found using Generalized 
Multifactor Dimensionality Reduction (GMDR). In comparison 1, a significant 
two-loci interaction occurs in females between ADA 22G>A and TNF-α -238G>A (Sign 
Test P=0.011). In comparison 2, both two-loci and three-loci interaction are 
significant associated with increased life-expectancy over 88 years in males. In 
conclusion, we report that a combination of functional SNPs within ADA and TNF-α 
genes can influence life-expectancy in a gender-specific manner and that males 
and females follow different pathways to attain longevity.

Life-span extension in laboratory rodents induced by long-term caloric 
restriction correlates with decreased serum insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) 
levels. Reduced activity of the growth hormone/IGF-I signaling system slows 
aging and increases longevity in mutant mouse models. In the present study, we 
show that long-term caloric restriction achieved by two different interventions 
for 4 years, either laparoscopic-adjustable gastric banding or reducing diet, 
leads to reduced IGF-I serum levels in formerly obese women relative to 
normal-weight women eating ad libitum. Moreover, we present evidence that the 
long-term caloric restriction interventions reduce fasting growth hormone serum 
levels. The present study indicates that the activity of the growth 
hormone/IGF-I axis is reduced in long-term calorically restricted formerly obese
