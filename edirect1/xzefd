significant health inequalities. A national review of public health in 2015 
found that there was a lack of coherent action across organisational boundaries, 
inhibiting progress. This paper describes a rapid (four-month) systematic 
approach to prioritisation of Scotland's public health challenges, which was 
evidence-based, transparent and made use of significant stakeholder engagement.
STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey of stakeholders in deliberative meetings.
METHODS: An independent Expert Advisory Group (EAG) was formed to develop a 
typology of public health priorities, a long-list of potential priorities and 
ranking criteria. Deliberative stakeholder events were held at which the 
criteria were refined and priorities scored by participants from a wide range of 
stakeholder organisations.
RESULTS: The proposed typology identified three types of public health 
priorities: risk factors, social factors and system factors; medically defined 
disease entities were not used deliberately, to facilitate broad stakeholder 
participation. Fifteen criteria were identified to help identify priority 
issues, based on the scope of their burden, amenability to change, and 
multi-stakeholder preferences. Six public health priorities were selected by the 
EAG based on stakeholder scoring of a long-list against these criteria.
CONCLUSION: Prioritisation is important in modern public health but it is 
challenging due to limited data availability, lack of agreed evidence on 
effectiveness and efficiency of interventions, and divergent stakeholder views. 
The Scottish experience nevertheless shows that useful public health priorities 
can be agreed upon by a wide range of stakeholders through a transparent, 
participatory and logical process.

BACKGROUND: The Banff Patellofemoral Instability Instrument (BPII) 2.0 is a 
disease-specific quality of life questionnaire for patients with patellofemoral 
instability. While good psychometric properties have been demonstrated, the data 
lack cross-cultural validity, construct validity, and an established measurement 
error.
PURPOSE: To (1) translate and cross-culturally adapt the BPII 2.0 to the 
Norwegian version (BPII 2.0-No) and (2) examine the psychometric properties of 
the Norwegian version.
STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study (diagnosis); Level of evidence, 3.
METHODS: The BPII 2.0 was translated according to international guidelines. A 
cohort of 100 patients surgically treated for recurrent patellofemoral 
instability completed the BPII 2.0-No, related outcome measures (Norwich 
Patellar Instability Score, International Knee Documentation Committee 
Subjective Knee Form 2000, Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, and 
Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia), and functional tests (Y-Balance Test-Lower 
Quarter, single-leg hop tests, and knee extension strength) before and/or 6 
months after surgery. We evaluated the face and content validity, internal 
consistency (Cronbach α), test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation 
coefficient [ICC]), measurement error (SEM and smallest detectable change at the 
individual [SDCind] and group levels [SDCgroup]). Construct validity was 
assessed by testing 9 hypotheses on the correlation between the BPII 2.0-No and 
the outcome measures/functional tests (Pearson r).
RESULTS: The BPII 2.0-No had good face and content validity. Internal 
consistency was excellent (α = .95), and no floor or ceiling effects were found. 
Test-retest reliability was high (ICC2,1 = 0.87; 95% CI, 0.77-0.93), and 
measurement error was low (SEM = 7.1). The SDCind was 19.7 points and the 
SDCgroup was 2.8 points. Eight of the 9 hypotheses regarding construct validity 
were confirmed.
CONCLUSION: The BPII 2.0-No was found to be valid and reliable. This study adds 
further knowledge on the measurement properties of the BPII 2.0 that can be used 
internationally.

Objectives: We explored temporal variations in disease burden of ambient 
particulate matter 2.5 μm or less in diameter (PM2.5) and ozone in Italy using 
estimates from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019. Methods: We compared 
temporal changes and percent variations (95% Uncertainty Intervals [95% UI]) in 
rates of disability adjusted life years (DALYs), years of life lost, years lived 
with disability and mortality from 1990 to 2019, and variations in 
pollutant-attributable burden with those in the overall burden of each PM2.5- 
and ozone-related disease. Results: In 2019, 467,000 DALYs (95% UI: 371,000, 
570,000) were attributable to PM2.5 and 39,600 (95% UI: 18,300, 61,500) to 
ozone. The crude DALY rate attributable to PM2.5 decreased by 47.9% (95% UI: 
10.3, 65.4) from 1990 to 2019. For ozone, it declined by 37.0% (95% UI: 28.9, 
44.5) during 1990-2010, but it increased by 44.8% (95% UI: 35.5, 56.3) during 
2010-2019. Age-standardized rates declined more than crude ones. Conclusion: In 
Italy, the burden of ambient PM2.5 (but not of ozone) significantly decreased, 
even in concurrence with population ageing. Results suggest a positive impact of 
air quality regulations, fostering further regulatory efforts.

mediation analysis based on the World Health Organization-Global Health 
Observatory data repository.

University, South Africa.

BACKGROUND: Globally, noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) have been continuously 
reported to be the number one leading cause of reduced life expectancy and poor 
life quality and have thus become a major public health concern.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the complex mediation analysis 
between physical inactivity and overweight in relation to mortality.
METHODS: The study is based on public data collected by the Global Health 
Observatory of the World Health Organization.
RESULTS: We showed that the median early mortality attributable to NCDs during 
the period 2016-2019 in both men and women was 23.2% (5th to 95th range=17.2, 
35.6) while that in men alone was 25.1% (16.5, 45.7) and that of women alone was 
22.0% (17.0, 27.9). When considering regional early NCDs mortality for both men 
and women, a systematically high median was observed in Southern Africa [28.7% 
(22.2, 43.8)] and a low median in Eastern Africa [21.1% (17.15, 27.3)]. The 
analysis of the overall relation between physical inactivity, overweight and 
early mortality due to NCDs revealed a statistical significance of the direct 
association between physical inactivity and early mortality due to NCDs.
CONCLUSION: Our findings revealed three main epidemiological and public health 
concerns. First, early mortality attributable to NCDs in a range of about 20 to 
30% across the sub-Saharan African regions for both sexes was observed. Second, 
there was a direct effect between physical inactivity and early NCDs mortality 
as well as the indirect effect mediated by overweight. Finally, a percentage 
point decrease in physical inactivity prevalence and overweight could 
effectively generate a reduction in mortality due to NCDs. Future studies are 
needed to confirm the scientific evidence observed in this study. Such studies 
should be based on observation of individual subjects, adopt a longitudinal 
design, and collect information that evaluates the complex relationship between 
physical inactivity and early NCDs mortality, along with the role of overweight 
as a possible mediator.

Drug use disorders are increasingly recognized as the main cause of public 
health issues worldwide. The current analysis aims to provide the most 
comprehensive, updated estimates of the burden from drug use disorders at 
global, regional, and national levels during the past three decades. Prevalence, 
incidence, deaths, and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) were estimated 
from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2019 
by age and sex for drug use disorder as well as its four main categories (opioid 
use disorders, cocaine use disorders, amphetamine use disorders, and cannabis 
use disorders) in 204 countries and territories between 1990 and 2019. DisMod-MR 
2.1, and Bayesian meta-regression were used to analyze prevalence and incidence, 
while the Cause of Death Ensemble model (CODEm) was used to estimate death of 
diseases. Globally, the burden of drug use disorders, as measured by the average 
annual percentage change (AAPC) of deaths and DALYs, continues to increase. The 
patterns by regions of DALYs due to drug use disorders varied significantly, and 
it is mainly in developed countries and concentrated among young people and 
males. Programs for drug use disorders management should be improved, 
particularly in opioid use disorders. Governments will face increasing demand 
for treatment and support services, and effective prevention as well as control 
strategies are required to reduce the burden from these causes.

The chemical scaffolds of numerous therapeutics are polyketide natural products, 
many formed by bacterial modular polyketide synthases (PKS). The large and 
flexible dimeric PKS modules have distinct extension and reducing regions. 
Structures are known for all individual enzyme domains and several extension 
regions. Here, we report the structure of the full reducing region from a 
modular PKS, the ketoreductase (KR), dehydratase (DH), and enoylreductase (ER) 
domains of module 5 of the juvenimicin PKS. The modular PKS-reducing region has 
a different architecture than the homologous fatty acid synthase (FAS) and 
iterative PKS systems in its arrangement of domains and dimer interface. The 
structure reveals a critical role for linker peptides in the domain interfaces, 
leading to discovery of key differences in KR domains dependent on module 
composition. Finally, our studies provide insight into the mechanism underlying 
modular PKS intermediate shuttling by carrier protein (ACP) domains.

In the current study, the novel eco-friendly and biodegradable nanocomposite 
films (NC-AXAc) were prepared from wheat-straw NC and AXAc with improved 
functional properties. NC derived from wheat-straw cellulose has a fibre-like 
structure with mean-particle size in the 340-520 nm range. AX derived AXAc was 
prepared with Degree of Substitution (DS) in the range of 1.85-1.89. 
Furthermore, to enhance antimicrobial properties, AgNPs were prepared via the 
reduction method using NaBH4 and added into the concentration of 4 × 10-4M into 
the emulsion forming composite films. The silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) 
incorporated in the composite exhibited an average size of 40-70 nm and a 
surface plasmon resonance (SPR) absorption peak at 395 nm. The high-resolution 
XPS spectrum of the Ag element showed that the two peaks at around 374.2 eV 
(Ag3d3/2) and 368.2 eV (Ag3d5/2) clearly revealed the metallic Ag existence in 
composite films. SEM analysis revealed the coarse and heterogeneous morphology 
of AgNPs incorporated films. The AgNPs incorporated composites exhibited good 
mechanical, thermal stability, and antimicrobial activity. The results suggested 
that AgNPs incorporated NC-AXAc composites could be used as a potential 
biodegradable antimicrobial nanocomposite in active food packaging systems for 
shelf-life extension of perishable commodities.

Intensive land use, such as dairying, can impair water quality. Although many 
guidelines exist on how to mitigate the loss of dairy-associated contaminants 
from land to water through best management practices (BMPs), few datasets exist 
on the success of implementation on-farm. Five dairy-dominated catchments (from 
598 to 2480 ha) in New Zealand were studied from 2001 to 2020. The first period, 
from 2001 to 2010, involved comprehensive "extension" advice to farmers 
consisting of workshops, stream water quality and flow monitoring, farm practice 
surveys, and identified solutions to address site-specific contaminant losses. 
In the second period (2011-2020), termed "post-extension", only water quality 
monitoring and farm practice surveys were continued. Of the water quality 
contaminants (including dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP), total phosphorus 
(TP), ammoniacal-nitrogen, nitrate-nitrite-nitrogen [NNN], suspended sediment 
and E. coli), 83 % of water quality trend directions were either improving 
(n = 16) or showed no change (n = 9) during the extension period. Over the 
20-year dataset, which included the post-extension period, 20 out of 30 
contaminant-catchment combinations (67 %) were improving, but nine were 
degrading, dominated by NNN (n = 4), DRP (n = 2) and E. coli (n = 2). Abrupt 
decreases in contaminant concentrations, were correlated with on-farm practice 
changes mainly associated with transition from direct discharge of farm dairy 
shed effluent to waterways to land application, and the capture of effluent from 
off-paddock facilities (like stand off or feed pads). Best management practices 
reduced phosphorus (P) forms, E. coli and sediment concentrations. Increase in 
NNN concentrations was caused by transitioning from flood to spray irrigation 
and a commensurate increase in cow numbers and NNN leaching. These data indicate 
that extension advice and on-farm practice change have helped to improve overall 
water quality over time. Nevertheless, recent regulatory threshold values for 
some contaminant concentrations are not being met, meaning that more actions are 
required, over and above the BMPs implemented.

The extent of the preventable burden of ischaemic stroke associated with atrial 
fibrillation (AF) remains uncertain to date. To address this knowledge gap, we 
utilised the comparative risk assessment methodology to estimate the burden of 
ischaemic stroke associated with AF at both global and regional levels. The 
population attributable fraction for ischaemic stroke and AF was obtained from 
published literature, while data on the prevalence, incidence, deaths, and 
disability-adjusted life years (DALY) associated with ischaemic stroke were 
sourced from the Global Burden of Disease study database. Our analysis revealed 
that in 2019, globally, there were an estimated 0.7 (95% uncertainty interval 
[UI] of 0.55 to 0.83) million incident cases, 6.9 (5.81 to 8.12) million 
prevalence cases, 0.3 0.25 to 0.34) million deaths and 5.7 (4.91 to 6.57) 
million DALY resulting from ischaemic stroke associated with AF. The 
age-standardised death and DALY rates declined between 2009 and 2019 in all 
regions to varying degrees. Conversely, the age-standardised incidence and 
prevalence rates reduced only in high-income countries, Central Europe, Eastern 
Europe and Central Asia and Latin America and Caribbean regions. It is likely 
that our findings under-estimated the true burden of ischaemic stroke associated 
with AF due to limitations such as the use of a fixed population attributable 
fraction and poor quality of data. Nevertheless, we believe that our estimates 
provide valuable insights and highlight the urgent need for optimised management 
of AF through the implementation of efficacious interventions. Such efforts can 
help reduce the occurrence of preventable ischaemic strokes.

Disability weights are crucial for quantifying health loss associated with 
non-fatal outcomes and were not well assessed in different countries, especially 
for specific cancer. Therefore, this study aimed to identify disability weights 
with a focus on specific cancer in a large Chinese population. Two types of web 
surveys were conducted, and 254 health states, including 30 new states for 
specific cancer, were investigated using paired comparison methods. The years 
lived with disability (YLDs) of cancer were calculated as the sum of the 
prevalence of each sequela of cancer multiplied by its relative disability 
weight. In total, 44,069 participants were eligible for the disability weights 
study. The disability weights of 254 health states were estimated. Among those, 
the disability weights of 18 specific cancer types varied greatly at diagnosis 
and primary treatment stage, with the value ranging from 0.619 (95% uncertainty 
interval (UI) 0.606-0.632) for brain cancer to 0.167 (95% UI 0.158-0.176) for 
oropharyngeal cancer. The discrepancy in YLDs calculated by different disability 
weights was high, and the largest gap for all cancer combined was approximately 
30.14%. When calculated using the cancer-specific disability weights, a total of 
1,967,830 (95% UI 1,928,880-2,008,060) YLDs of cancer were recorded in China. 
The disability weights of cancer varied greatly among cancer types and 
populations, which had considerable influence on the estimation of the disease 
burden. Cancer-specific disability weights could provide a more accurate 
evaluation of the cancer burden.

BACKGROUND: China has one of the highest hepatitis B virus (HBV) disease burdens 
worldwide and tracking progress toward the 2030 HBV elimination targets is 
essential. This study aimed to assess the impact of biomedical interventions 
(i.e., adult vaccination, screening and treatment) on the adult HBV epidemic, 
estimate the time for HBV elimination, and evaluate the cost-effectiveness of 
the interventions in China.
METHODS: A deterministic compartmental model was developed to project the HBV 
epidemic from 2022 to 2050 and estimate the time to meet elimination targets 
under four intervention scenarios. Cost-effectiveness was calculated using 
incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained, i.e., average 
cost-effectiveness ratio (CER).
RESULTS: Under the status quo, there will be 42.09-45.42 million adults living 
with HBV in 2050 and 11.04-14.36 million HBV-related deaths cumulatively from 
2022 to 2050. Universal vaccination would cumulatively avert 3.44-3.95 million 
new cases at a cost of US$1027-1261/QALY gained. The comprehensive strategy 
would cumulatively avert 4.67-5.24 million new chronic cases and 
1.39-1.85 million deaths, expediting the realization of the elimination targets 
forward to 2049. This strategy was also cost-effective with an average CER of 
US$20,796-26,685/QALY and a saved healthcare cost of US$16.10-26.84 per person.
CONCLUSION: China is not on track to meet the elimination targets but 
comprehensive biomedical interventions can accelerate the realization of the 
targets. A comprehensive strategy is cost-effective and cost-saving, which 
should be promoted in primary care infrastructures. Universal adult vaccination 
may be appropriate in the near future considering practical feasibility.

BACKGROUND: Prenatal posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS), fear of childbirth 
(FOC), and depressive symptoms have been related to various negative effects 
during pregnancy, childbirth, and in the postnatal period. This study evaluates 
the prevalence of PTSS, FOC, depressive symptoms, and health-related quality of 
life (HRQoL) among pregnant women, their partners, and as couples.
METHODS: In a cohort of 3853 volunteered, unselected women at the mean of 17th 
weeks of pregnancy with 3020 partners, PTSS was evaluated by Impact of Event 
Scale (IES), FOC by Wijma Delivery Expectancy Questionnaire (W-DEQ-A), 
depressive symptoms by Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), and HRQoL by 
15D instrument.
RESULTS: PTSS (IES score ≥ 33) was identified among 20.2% of the women, 13.4% of 
the partners, and 3.4% of the couples. Altogether, 5.9% of the women, but only 
0.3% of the partners, and 0.04% of the couples experienced symptoms suggestive 
of phobic FOC (W-DEQ A ≥ 100). Respectively, 7.6% of the women, 1.8% of the 
partners, and 0.4% of the couples reported depressive symptoms (EPDS ≥ 13). 
Nulliparous women and partners without previous children experienced FOC more 
often than those with previous children, but there was no difference in PTSS, 
depressive symptoms, or HRQoL. Women's mean 15D score was lower than partners' 
and that of age- and gender-standardized general population, while partners' 
mean 15D score was higher than that of age- and gender-standardized general 
population. Women whose partners reported PTSS, phobic FOC, or depressive 
symptoms, often had the same symptoms (22.3%, 14.3%, and 20.4%, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: PTSS were common in both women and partners, as well as in couples. 
FOC and depressive symptoms were common in women but uncommon in partners, thus 
they rarely occurred simultaneously in couples. However, special attention 
should be paid to a pregnant woman whose partner experiences any of these 
symptoms.

BACKGROUND: This study aimed to assess the long-term effects of tofogliflozin, a 
sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, on atherosclerosis progression 
and major clinical parameters in patients with type 2 diabetes lacking an 
apparent history of cardiovascular disease.
METHODS: This was a prospective observational 2-year extension study of the 
"Using TOfogliflozin for Possible better Intervention against Atherosclerosis 
for type 2 diabetes patients (UTOPIA)" trial, a 2-year randomized intervention 
study. The primary endpoints represented changes in the carotid intima-media 
thickness (IMT). Secondary endpoints included brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity 
(baPWV) and biomarkers for glucose metabolism, lipid metabolism, renal function, 
and cardiovascular risks.
RESULTS: The mean IMT of the common carotid artery (IMT-CCA) significantly 
decreased in both the tofogliflozin (- 0.067 mm, standard error 0.009, 
p < 0.001) and conventional treatment groups (- 0.080 mm, SE 0.009, p < 0.001) 
throughout the follow-up period; however, no significant intergroup differences 
in the changes (0.013 mm, 95% confidence interval (CI) - 0.012 to 0.037, 
p = 0.32) were observed in a mixed-effects model for repeated measures. baPWV 
significantly increased in the conventional treatment group (82.7 ± 210.3 cm/s, 
p = 0.008) but not in the tofogliflozin group (- 17.5 ± 221.3 cm/s, p = 0.54), 
resulting in a significant intergroup difference in changes (- 100.2 cm/s, 95% 
CI - 182.8 to - 17.5, p = 0.018). Compared to the conventional treatment group, 
tofogliflozin significantly improved the hemoglobin A1c and high-density 
lipoprotein cholesterol levels, body mass index, abdominal circumference, and 
systolic blood pressure. The frequencies of total and serious adverse events did 
not vary significantly between the groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Tofogliflozin was not associated with improved inhibition of 
carotid wall thickening but exerted long-term positive effects on various 
cardiovascular risk factors and baPWV while showing a good safety profile.
