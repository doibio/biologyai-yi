quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), costs, and the incremental 
cost-effectiveness and cost/utility ratio (ICER and ICUR) of PET-ART versus CRT. 
Model outcomes were obtained from averaging the predictions for 50,000 simulated 
patients. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis and scenario analyses were 
carried out.
RESULTS: The average incremental costs per patient of PET-ART were €569 (95% 
confidence interval [CI] €-5327-€6936) for 0.42 incremental LYs (95% CI 
0.19-0.61) and 0.33 QALYs gained (95% CI 0.13-0.49). The base-case scenario 
resulted in an ICER of €1360 per LY gained and an ICUR of €1744 per QALY gained. 
The probabilistic analysis gave a 36% probability that PET-ART improves health 
outcomes at reduced costs and a 64% probability that PET-ART is more effective 
at slightly higher costs.
CONCLUSION: On the basis of the available data, individualized PET-ART for NSCLC 
seems to be cost-effective compared with CRT.

Duchenne muscular dystrophy, an X-linked disorder, has an incidence of one in 
5000 boys and presents in early childhood with proximal muscle weakness. 
Untreated boys become wheelchair bound by the age of 12 years and die of 
cardiorespiratory complications in their late teens to early 20s. The use of 
corticosteroids, non-invasive respiratory support, and active surveillance and 
management of associated complications have improved ambulation, function, 
quality of life and life expectancy. The clinical features, investigations and 
management of Duchenne muscular dystrophy are reviewed, as well as the latest in 
some of the novel therapies.

AIM: Considering the dramatic increase in average life expectancy during the 
20th century throughout the world, the management of elderly patients with 
cancer has become a global issue. We herein investigated the clinical 
characteristics and outcomes of super-elderly hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) 
patients over 80 years old not indicated for surgical resection.
METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated 206 newly diagnosed HCC patients. The 
patients were divided into two groups according to their age at inclusion; a 
super-elderly group (n = 37, ≥80 years) and a younger group (n = 169, 
<80 years). We compared the clinical characteristics, overall survival (OS) and 
disease-specific survival (DSS) rates among the two groups. Both univariate and 
multivariate analyses were performed to identify the factors associated with the 
OS and DSS.
RESULTS: The proportion of women was higher in the super-elderly group than in 
the younger group (P = 0.017). There were no significant differences in the OS 
(P = 0.171) or DSS (P = 0.176) between the two groups. The multivariate analysis 
revealed that only the Cancer Liver Italian Program score (hazard ratio [HR], 
2.972; P < 0.0001; HR, 3.694; P < 0.0001) was independently associated with the 
OS and DSS. Age was not found to be associated with the OS or DSS according to 
either the univariate or multivariate analysis.
CONCLUSION: There were no significant differences in the OS and DSS rates among 
the super-elderly HCC patients and younger HCC patients not indicated for 
surgical resection. An advanced age itself does not restrict the therapeutic 
approach, even in super-elderly HCC patients not indicated for surgical 
resection.

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common life-limiting genetically acquired 
respiratory disorder. Patients with CF have thick mucus obstructing the airways 
leading to recurrent infections, bronchiectasis and neutrophilic airway 
inflammation culminating in deteriorating lung function. Current management 
targets airway infection and mucus clearance, but despite recent advances in 
care, life expectancy is still only 40 years. We investigated whether activin A 
is elevated in CF lung disease and whether inhibiting activin A with its natural 
antagonist follistatin retards lung disease progression. We measured serum 
activin A levels, lung function and nutritional status in CF patients. We 
studied the effect of activin A on CF lung pathogenesis by treating newborn CF 
transgenic mice (β-ENaC) intranasally with the natural activin A antagonist 
follistatin. Activin A levels were elevated in the serum of adult CF patients, 
and correlated inversely with lung function and body mass index. Follistatin 
treatment of newborn β-ENaC mice, noted for respiratory pathology mimicking 
human CF, decreased the airway activin A levels and key features of CF lung 
disease including mucus hypersecretion, airway neutrophilia and levels of 
mediators that regulate inflammation and chemotaxis. Follistatin treatment also 
increased body weight and survival of β-ENaC mice, with no evidence of local or 
systemic toxicity. Our findings demonstrate that activin A levels are elevated 
in CF and provide proof-of-concept for the use of the activin A antagonist, 
follistatin, as a therapeutic in the long-term management of lung disease in CF 
patients.

PURPOSE: We aimed to evaluate the effects of preoperative pulmonary hypertension 
(PH) on early and long term results in patients undergoing coronary bypass 
surgery and the effects of coronary bypass surgery on PH.
METHODS: Among 2325 patients who underwent elective isolated coronary artery 
bypass surgery between March 2003 and March 2012, 287 patients with high 
preoperative pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP) ≥30 mmHg were examined. Patients' 
data were obtained by retrospective examination of our clinic's database. 69 
patients who had complete parameters included in the study.
RESULTS: There was no increase in the New York Heart Association (NYHA) 
functional classification 84% of cases. Preoperative and postoperative values of 
the mean ejection fraction and mean PAP of patients was respectively 45.28 ± 
9.67 (25-65), 46.03 ±12.4 (20-65) (p = 0.447), 36.67 ± 6.81 (30-60) mmHg, 37.81 
± 10.07 (20-70) mmHg (p = 0.378). The late mortality of cases was 5.79%. In our 
study, during 33.9 ± 17 (9-100) months follow up period, life expectancy was 
calculated as 94.7 months.
CONCLUSION: Preoperative evaluation of these patients for appropriate medical 
treatment at peroperative and postoperative period, coronary bypass can be 
performed with low morbidity and mortality rates. In the late period after 
surgical revascularization PH showed no significant change and had no adverse 
effect on quality of life.

Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is an acquired disorder of the 
hematopoietic stem cell that makes blood cells more sensitive to the action of 
complement. Patients experience intravascular hemolysis, smooth muscle dystonia, 
renal failure, arterial and pulmonary hypertension, recurrent infectious 
diseases and an increased risk of notably dreadful thrombotic complications. The 
diagnosis is made by flow cytometry. Efforts have been recently performed to 
improve the sensitivity and the standardization of this technique. PNH is 
frequently associated with aplastic anemia or low-risk myelodysplasia and may be 
asymptomatic. Management of the classical form of PNH has been dramatically 
revolutionized by the development of eculizumab, which brings benefits in terms 
of hemolysis, quality of life, renal function, thrombotic risk, and life 
expectancy. Prophylaxis and treatment of arterial and venous thrombosis 
currently remain a challenge in PNH.

Mastocytosis is a term referring to a heterogeneous group of disorders 
characterized by abnormal mast cell (MC) accumulation in the skin and/or 
internal organs. In children, the disease involves mostly the skin (cutaneous 
mastocytosis; CM), whereas in adults, the disease is usually systemic (systemic 
mastocytosis; SM). Advanced SM variants with end-organ damage and reduced life 
expectancy have also been described, but are rare. Clinical signs and symptoms 
in SM result from excessive mediator release by MCs and, in aggressive forms, 
from organ failure related to MC infiltration. As a consequence, treatment of 
indolent SM aims primarily at the control of symptoms caused by MC mediator 
release. By contrast, in advanced SM, such as aggressive SM, MC leukemia, and MC 
sarcoma, intensive (chemo)therapy with or without allogeneic stem cell 
transplantation has to be considered. In addition, activating mutations in KIT 
(mostly KIT D816V in adults) are found in most patients with SM, so that 
targeted therapies aimed at blocking mutant KIT variants or/and downstream 
signaling pathways are currently being developed. Other targets, such as 
specific surface antigens expressed on neoplastic MCs, might be considered for 
the development of future therapies in advanced SM.

Worldwide, sickle cell trait is a highly prevalent gene carrier state. While 
generally a benign condition with a normal life expectancy, it is becoming 
increasingly clear that the sickle trait is associated with certain adverse 
outcomes. This article will focus on three of these outcomes, namely exertional 
rhabdomyolysis and sudden death, chronic renal dysfunction, and venous 
thromboembolism. In each case, the epidemiological evidence for the association 
is reviewed, together with the existing data on potential underlying mechanisms. 
Because newborn screening programmes for sickle cell anaemia also identify those 
with sickle cell trait, it is imperative that further studies determine what, if 
any, preventive measures can be taken to reduce the burden of these uncommon but 
potentially morbid complications in affected individuals.

INTRODUCTION: Cushing's disease is the most common cause of endogenous 
hypercortisolemia, in 90% of cases due to microadenoma. Macroadenoma can lead to 
atypical hormonal test results and complete removal of the tumour is unlikely.
CASE REPORT: A 77-year-old woman with diabetes and hypertension was admitted 
because of fatigue, proximal muscles weakness, lower extremities oedema, and 
worsening of glycaemic and hypertension control. Physical examination revealed 
central obesity, 'moon'-like face, supraclavicular pads, proximal muscle 
atrophy, and skin hyperpigmentation. Biochemical and hormonal results were as 
follows: K 2.3 mmol/L (3.6-5), cortisol 8.00 86 μg/dL (6.2-19.4) 23.00 76 μg/dL, 
ACTH 8.00 194 pg/mL (7.2-63.3) 23.00 200 pg/mL, DHEAS 330 μg/dL (12-154). CRH 
stimulation test showed lack of ACTH stimulation > 35%, overnight high dose DST 
revealed no suppression of cortisol. Chest and abdominal CT as well as 
somatostatin receptor scan didn't show ectopic tumour responsible for ACTH 
oversecretion. MRI revealed a pituitary macroadenoma (28 × 20 × 17 mm) extending 
towards the left cavernous sinus. After partial transsphenoidal adenomectomy, 
serum cortisol of 40 μg/dL was obtained. The patient's condition was still very 
poor, so unilateral adrenalectomy was performed. After surgery, serum morning 
cortisol level dropped to 20 μg/dL and the patient's condition improved 
significantly. 26 months after the operations, the patient remains in remission. 
Because her life expectancy exceeds the prognosed duration of remission with the 
presence of pituitary tumour remnants and intact left adrenal gland, the patient 
was qualified to radiosurgery with a Gamma Knife.
CONCLUSION: In selected cases, unilateral, laparascopic adrenalectomy may serve 
as a life-saving procedure in a patient with ACTHdependent Cushing's syndrome.

Template directed replication supports the maintenance of the metabolically 
coupled replicator system.

The RNA World scenario of prebiotic chemical evolution is among the most 
plausible conceptual framework available today for modelling the origin of life. 
RNA offers genetic and catalytic (metabolic) functionality embodied in a single 
chemical entity, and a metabolically cooperating community of RNA molecules 
would constitute a viable infrabiological subsystem with a potential to evolve 
into proto-cellular life. Our Metabolically Coupled Replicator System (MCRS) 
model is a spatially explicit computer simulation implementation of the 
RNA-World scenario, in which replicable ribozymes cooperate in supplying each 
other with monomers for their own replication. MCRS has been repeatedly 
demonstrated to be viable and evolvable, with different versions of the model 
improved in depth (chemical detail of metabolism) or in extension (additional 
functions of RNA molecules). One of the dynamically relevant extensions of the 
MCRS approach to prebiotic RNA evolution is the explicit inclusion of template 
replication into its assumptions, which we have studied in the present version. 
We found that this modification has not changed the behaviour of the system in 
the qualitative sense, just the range of the parameter space which is optimal 
for the coexistence of metabolically cooperating replicators has shifted in 
terms of metabolite mobility. The system also remains resistant and tolerant to 
parasitic replicators.

PURPOSE: Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) survivors have an increased risk of 
cardiovascular disease (CD), lung cancer, and breast cancer. We investigated the 
risk for the development of CD and secondary lung, breast, and thyroid cancer 
after radiation therapy (RT) delivered with deep inspiration breath-hold (DIBH) 
compared with free-breathing (FB) using 3-dimensional conformal RT (3DCRT) and 
intensity modulated RT (IMRT). The aim of this study was to determine which 
treatment modality best reduced the combined risk of life-threatening late 
effects in patients with mediastinal HL.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: Twenty-two patients with early-stage mediastinal HL were 
eligible for the study. Treatment plans were calculated with both 3DCRT and 
IMRT on both DIBH and FB planning computed tomographic scans. We reported the 
estimated dose to the heart, lung, female breasts, and thyroid and calculated 
the estimated life years lost attributable to CD and to lung, breast, and 
thyroid cancer.
RESULTS: DIBH lowered the estimated dose to heart and lung regardless of 
delivery technique (P<.001). There was no significant difference between IMRT-FB 
and 3DCRT-DIBH in mean heart dose, heart V20Gy, and lung V20Gy. The mean breast 
dose was increased with IMRT regardless of breathing technique. Life years lost 
was lowest with DIBH and highest with FB.
CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort, 3DCRT-DIBH resulted in lower estimated doses and 
lower lifetime excess risks than did IMRT-FB. Combining IMRT and DIBH could be 
beneficial for a subgroup of patients.

Clinical research requires representation of racially and ethnically diverse 
participants to accurately represent the general population. Overall life 
expectancy of African Americans is shorter than that of the general U.S.
POPULATION: Compared with the other ethnic groups in the United States, African 
Americans have higher rates of hypertension, stroke, obesity, and diabetes, and 
higher rates of mortality related to stroke and cancer. Although many health 
disparities exist among African Americans, they are well underrepresented in 
clinical research. This article provides an overview of barriers that may 
influence participation in clinical research among African Americans. Issues of 
trust, experimentation, communication, and logistics are the most commonly 
identified barriers. The barriers and facilitators identified in this review may 
be useful in the development and implementation of recruitment and research 
strategies that are culturally sensitive and that may enhance trust and 
willingness to participate among African Americans.

BACKGROUND: There are no randomized controlled trials to inform the decision of 
which cranial radiation therapy (CRT) strategy to apply to pediatric patients 
with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).
PROCEDURE: We performed a decision analysis using a Markov model in which we 
compared the life expectancy and quality-adjusted life expectancy when 
administering one of three CRT strategies to a cohort of patients with T-cell 
ALL: (1) omission of CRT for all patients; (2) CRT only for those with evidence 
of leukemic involvement in the central nervous system at diagnosis (therapeutic 
strategy); or (3) CRT for all (prophylactic strategy).
RESULTS: When considering plausible event-free survival rates and late mortality 
after cure for groups of pediatric patients with T-cell ALL, the strategies of 
omitting CRT, administering therapeutic CRT, and administering prophylactic CRT 
result in similar short-term (7-year) survival. When considering the increased 
contribution of deaths from late effects, the strategy of prophylactic CRT is 
associated with lower life expectancy when compared to the other two strategies. 
The Monte Carlo probabilistic sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the 
strategy of prophylactic CRT was the preferred strategy only 5% of the time.
CONCLUSIONS: Similar short-term survival may be expected when comparing the 
strategies of total omission of CRT, therapeutic CRT, and prophylactic CRT for 
patients with T-cell ALL. Long-term survival is likely inferior for the strategy 
of prophylactic CRT. The synthesis of nonrandomized trials and the application 
of decision analysis can help inform complex decision making in pediatric 
oncology.

Auxiliary liver transplantation is an accepted form of therapy in acute liver 
failure and in certain metabolic disorders. We report India's first successful 
auxiliary liver transplantation for Crigler-Najjar syndrome type 1, showing that 
it is technically feasible and safe procedure. It is utmost important to select 
appropriate cases for auxiliary transplant for successful long-term outcome. The 
surgeon should also have an understanding of the portal flow dynamics, as steal 
phenomenon can occur, depriving blood blow to either graft or native liver. 
Though successful in animal models, gene therapy is still in experimental stage 
in humans and pace of progress has been disappointing. Auxiliary liver 
transplantation retains the native liver for future gene therapy. These children 
are young and are likely to have a long life expectancy, and withdrawal of 
immunosuppression would be a huge advantage.

BACKGROUND: Many prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission (PMTCT) programs 
currently prioritize antiretroviral therapy (ART) for women with advanced HIV. 
Point-of-care (POC) CD4 assays may expedite the selection of three-drug ART 
instead of zidovudine, but are costlier than traditional laboratory assays.
METHODS: We used validated models of HIV infection to simulate pregnant, 
HIV-infected women (mean age 26 years, gestational age 26 weeks) in a general 
antenatal clinic in South Africa, and their infants. We examined two strategies 
for CD4 testing after HIV diagnosis: laboratory (test rate: 96%, result-return 
rate: 87%, cost: $14) and POC (test rate: 99%, result-return rate: 95%, cost: 
$26). We modeled South African PMTCT guidelines during the study period (WHO 
"Option A"): antenatal zidovudine (CD4 ≤350/μL) or ART (CD4>350/μL). Outcomes 
included MTCT risk at weaning (age 6 months), maternal and pediatric life 
expectancy (LE), maternal and pediatric lifetime healthcare costs (2013 USD), 
and cost-effectiveness ($/life-year saved).
RESULTS: In the base case, laboratory led to projected MTCT risks of 5.7%, 
undiscounted pediatric LE of 53.2 years, and undiscounted PMTCT plus pediatric 
lifetime costs of $1,070/infant. POC led to lower modeled MTCT risk (5.3%), 
greater pediatric LE (53.4 years) and lower PMTCT plus pediatric lifetime costs 
($1,040/infant). Maternal outcomes following laboratory were similar to POC (LE: 
21.2 years; lifetime costs: $23,860/person). Compared to laboratory, POC 
improved clinical outcomes and reduced healthcare costs.
CONCLUSIONS: In antenatal clinics implementing Option A, the higher initial cost 
of a one-time POC CD4 assay will be offset by cost-savings from prevention of 
pediatric HIV infection.

Saving lives and saving money: hospital-based violence intervention is 
cost-effective.

Francisco-East Bay-Highland Hospital (R.S., A.G.), Oakland, California.

BACKGROUND: Victims of violence are at significant risk for injury recidivism, 
including fatality. We previously demonstrated that our hospital-based violence 
intervention program (VIP) resulted in a fourfold reduction in injury 
recidivism, avoiding trauma care costs of $41,000 per injury. Given limited 
trauma center resources, assessing cost-effectiveness of interventions is 
fundamental to inform use of these programs in other institutions. This study 
examines the cost-effectiveness of hospital-based VIP.
METHODS: We used a decision tree and Markov disease state modeling to analyze 
cost utility for a hypothetical cohort of violently injured subjects, comparing 
VIP versus no VIP at a trauma center. Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were 
calculated using differences in mortality and published health state utilities. 
Costs of trauma care and VIP were obtained from institutional data, and risk of 
recidivism with and without VIP were obtained from our trial. Outcomes were 
QALYs gained and net costs over a 5-year horizon. Sensitivity analyses examined 
the impact of uncertainty in input values on results.
RESULTS: VIP results in an estimated 25.58 QALYs and net costs (program plus 
trauma care) of $5,892 per patient. Without VIP, these values are 25.34 and 
$5,923, respectively, suggesting that VIP yields substantial health benefits (24 
QALYs) and savings ($4,100) if implemented for 100 individuals. In the 
sensitivity analysis, net QALYs gained with VIP nearly triple when the injury 
recidivism rate without VIP is highest. Cost-effectiveness remained robust over 
a range of values; $6,000 net cost savings occur when 5-year recidivism rate 
without VIP is at 7%.
CONCLUSION: VIP costs less than having no VIP with significant gains in QALYs 
especially at anticipated program scale. Across a range of plausible values at 
which VIP would be less cost-effective (lower injury recidivism, cost of injury, 
and program effectiveness), VIP still results in acceptable cost per health 
outcome gained. VIP is effective and cost-effective and should be considered in 
any trauma center that takes care of violently injured patients. Our analyses 
can be used to estimate VIP costs and results in different settings.

Role of bone-anabolic agents in the treatment of breast cancer bone metastases.

Suvannasankha A, Chirgwin JM.

Skeletal metastases are an incurable complication afflicting the majority of 
patients who die from advanced breast cancer. They are most often osteolytic, 
characterized by net bone destruction and suppressed new bone formation. Life 
expectancy from first diagnosis of breast cancer bone metastases is several 
years, during which time skeletal-related events - including pain, fracture, 
hypercalcemia, and spinal cord compression - significantly degrade quality of 
life. The bone marrow niche can also confer hormonal and chemo-resistance. Most 
treatments for skeletal metastases target bone-destroying osteoclasts and are 
palliative. Recent results from the Breast cancer trials of Oral Everolimus-2 
trial suggest that agents such as the mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor 
everolimus may have efficacy against breast cancer bone metastases in part via 
stimulating osteoblasts as well as by inhibiting tumor growth. Selective 
estrogen receptor modulators similarly inhibit growth of estrogen 
receptor-positive breast cancers while having positive effects on the skeleton. 
This review discusses the future role of bone-anabolic agents for the specific 
treatment of osteolytic breast cancer metastases. Agents with both anti-tumor 
and bone-anabolic actions have been tested in the setting of multiple myeloma, a 
hematological malignancy that causes severe osteolytic bone loss and suppression 
of osteoblastic new bone formation. Stimulation of osteoblast activity inhibits 
multiple myeloma growth - a strategy that might decrease breast cancer burden in 
osteolytic bone metastases. Proteasome inhibitors (bortezomib and carfilzomib) 
inhibit the growth of myeloma directly and are anabolic for bone. Drugs with 
limited anti-tumor activity but which are anabolic for bone include intermittent 
parathyroid hormone and antibodies that neutralize the WNT inhibitors DKK1 and 
sclerostin, as well as the activin A blocker sotatercept and the osteoporosis 
drug strontium ranelate. Transforming growth factor-beta inhibitors have little 
tumor antiproliferative activity but block breast cancer production of 
osteolytic factors and are also anabolic for bone. Some of these treatments are 
already in clinical trials. This review provides an overview of agents with 
bone-anabolic properties, which may have utility in the treatment of breast 
cancer metastatic to the skeleton.

This study estimated the health and economic burden of child maltreatment in the 
East Asia and Pacific region, addressing a significant gap in the current 
evidence base. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses were conducted to estimate 
the prevalence of child physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional abuse, neglect, 
and witnessing parental violence. Population Attributable Fractions were 
calculated and Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) lost from physical and 
mental health outcomes and health risk behaviors attributable to child 
maltreatment were estimated using the most recent comparable Global Burden of 
Disease data. DALY losses were converted into monetary value by assuming that 
one DALY is equal to the sub-region's per capita GDP. The estimated economic 
value of DALYs lost to violence against children as a percentage of GDP ranged 
from 1.24% to 3.46% across sub-regions defined by the World Health Organization. 
The estimated economic value of DALYs (in constant 2000 US$) lost to child 
maltreatment in the EAP region totaled US $151 billion, accounting for 1.88% of 
the region's GDP. Updated to 2012 dollars, the estimated economic burden totaled 
US $194 billion. In sensitivity analysis, the aggregate costs as a percentage of 
GDP range from 1.36% to 2.52%. The economic burden of child maltreatment in the 
East Asia and Pacific region is substantial, indicating the importance of 
preventing and responding to child maltreatment in this region. More 
comprehensive research into the impact of multiple types of childhood adversity 
on a wider range of putative health outcomes is needed to guide policy and 
programs for child protection in the region, and globally.

Many countries in Europe and the world have to cope with an aging population. 
Although health policy in many countries aims at increasing disability-free life 
expectancy, elderly patients represent a significant proportion of all patients 
admitted to different hospital departments. The aim of the research was to 
investigate the relationship between health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and 
the care dependency status among elderly hospital patients. In 2012, a 
descriptive survey was administered to a convenience sample of 325 elderly 
hospital patients (> 60 years) from The Netherlands (N = 125), from Poland (N = 
100), and from Turkey (N = 100). We employed the Functional Assessment of 
Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT) Measurement System and the Care Dependency 
Scale. FACIT is a collection of HRQOL questionnaires that assess 
multidimensional health status in people with various chronic illnesses. From 
demographic variables, gender (female) (r = -0.13, p < 0.05), age and informal 
care given by family members (r = -0.27 to 0.27, p < 0.01) were significantly 
correlated with the care dependency status for the whole samples. All HRQOL 
variables, hearing aid and duration of illness correlated with care dependency 
status (r = -0.20 to 0.50, p < 0.01). Moreover, the FACIT sum score (Poland and 
Turkey) and functional wellbeing (The Netherlands) are significantly associated 
with the decrease in care dependency status. Thus, the FACIT variables are the 
most powerful indicators for care dependency. The study provides healthcare 
professionals insight into improvement of quality of care in all three 
countries.

BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to identify predictors of 30-day mortality 
in patients with malignant pleural effusion (MPE) who need pleural palliative 
procedures.
METHODS: Data was prospectively collected from our database, between January 
2013 and July 2014 on 86 patients with MPE and complete follow-up 30 days after 
the procedure. The sample was divided into two groups. The first group (G1) 
included patients who had died up to 30 days after the palliative procedure, and 
the second group (G2) included patients who survived for more than 30 days after 
the palliative procedure. The identification of prognostic factors occurred 
through univariate analysis using Fisher exact test for analysis of categorical 
variables and the t test for quantitative variables. Subsequently, all variables 
were used in the multivariate logistic regression analysis. The cutoff values 
for any significant continuous variables were determined by receiver operating 
characteristics analysis.
RESULTS: There were 24 patients in G1 and 62 patients in G2. Univariate analysis 
of factors affecting postprocedural survival disclosed nine factors that were 
associated with significantly reduced postoperative survival. At the 
multivariate analysis, high levels of white blood cells, (p = .013), low levels 
of red blood cells (p < .0001) and protein in pleural fluid (p = .001), and 
primary lung and gastrointestinal sites (p = .0076) were identified as 
independent predictors of mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: We identified four factors that are easily recognized in daily 
practice and can help select patients with low life expectancy. Therefore, 
invasive procedures and hospitalizations for this subgroup of patients can be 
prevented.

Elite-class athletes have longer life expectancy and lower risk for chronic 
noncommunicable diseases possibly because of physically active and healthier 
lifestyle. In this study, we assessed former male Finnish elite-class athletes' 
(n = 392) and their matched controls' (n = 207) body composition, and risk for 
the metabolic syndrome (MS) and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in 
later life. Compared with the controls, the former athletes had lower body fat 
percentage (24.8% vs 26.0%, P = 0.021), lower risk for MS [odds ratio (OR) 0.57, 
95% confidence interval (CI) 0.40-0.81], and NAFLD (OR 0.61, 95% CI 0.42-0.88). 
High volume of current leisure-time physical activity (LTPA) was associated with 
lower body fat percentage (P for trend < 0.001). When current volume of LTPA 
increased 1 MET h/week, the risk of MS and NAFLD decreased (OR 0.99, 95% CI 
0.98-0.99 and OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.96-0.98, respectively). Although a career as an 
elite-class athlete during young adulthood may help to protect from developing 
metabolic syndrome, present exercise levels and volume of LTPA seem equally 
important as well.

Vanishing White Matter disease (VWM) is an inherited progressive 
leukoencephalopathy caused by mutations in the genes EIF2B1-5, which encode for 
the 5 subunits of the eukaryotic initiation factor 2B (eIF2B), a regulator of
