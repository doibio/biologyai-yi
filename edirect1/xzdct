and general oncology practices. At a prespecified 40% mortality risk threshold 
used to differentiate high- vs low-risk patients, observed 180-day mortality was 
45.2% (95% CI, 41.3%-49.1%) in the high-risk group vs 3.1% (95% CI, 2.9%-3.3%) 
in the low-risk group. Integrating the algorithm into the Eastern Cooperative 
Oncology Group and Elixhauser comorbidity index-based classifiers resulted in 
favorable reclassification (net reclassification index, 0.09 [95% CI, 0.04-0.14] 
and 0.23 [95% CI, 0.20-0.27], respectively).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this prognostic study, an ML algorithm was 
feasibly integrated into the electronic health record to generate real-time, 
accurate predictions of short-term mortality for patients with cancer and 
outperformed routinely used prognostic indices. This algorithm may be used to 
inform behavioral interventions and prompt earlier conversations about goals of 
care and end-of-life preferences among patients with cancer.

The small hive beetle, Aethina tumida Murray, is an invasive pest that has 
spread globally. Western honey bees, Apis mellifera Linnaeus (Hymenoptera: 
Apidae), are considered the most important host and infestations can lead to 
collapse of colonies. Larvae feed on honey, pollen, and brood inside the hive 
and leave the hive as postfeeding wandering larvae to pupate in the surrounding 
soil. Other host species include bumble bees, stingless bees, and solitary bees, 
all of which can facilitate small hive beetle reproduction and are used for 
greenhouse crop pollination worldwide. Here, we investigated if small hive 
beetles can complete their life cycle when soil is absent by pupating in plant 
root-supporting substrates commonly used in greenhouses. Wandering small hive 
beetle larvae were introduced into containers with coconut fiber, perlite, a 
mixture of both and stone wool substrates to investigate pupation success and 
development time. Sand was used as control substrate. In all but one substrate 
(perlite), small hive beetles developed into adults equally well as they did in 
the sand. Development time ranged between 23 and 37 d and was not different from 
that of the control. We showed that small hive beetles can pupate in greenhouse 
substrates. This could constitute a problem for greenhouse pollination as well 
as it could facilitate small hive beetle survival in areas which otherwise would 
be deemed unsuitable or marginal environments for small hive beetles to become 
established. Our study highlights the opportunistic nature of the small hive 
beetle as an invasive species.

Those suffering with serious mental illness (SMI), such as psychotic disorders, 
experience life expectancy 15 years shorter than the general population. 
Cardiovascular disease is the biggest cause of death in those with psychotic 
disease and many risk factors may be limited by healthy lifestyle choices. Text 
messaging interventions represent mobile health (mHealth), a nascent way to 
deliver physical health care to those suffering with a psychotic disorder. This 
paper aims to review the literature on the feasibility of text messaging to 
support the delivery of physical health care in those with a psychotic disorder. 
A thorough electronic database literature review of Medline via Ovid, Embase, 
APA Psycinfo, Scopus, Cochrane and Web of Science was conducted. Articles were 
included if text messaging was used as an intervention targeting the physical 
health of patients with psychotic disorders. A final sample of 11 articles 
satisfied the eligibility criteria, of which, 3 were ongoing randomised 
controlled trials. Of the 8 completed trials, all demonstrated the promising 
feasibility of text messaging, assessed via quotes, conversation samples, 
response rates, questionnaires or directly based on physical results. 36% of 
studies analysed those with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, 55% with 
SMI and 9% with schizophrenia and psychotic disorders, mood disorders or anxiety 
disorders. Text messaging was used as motivation or reminders (91%), service 
delivery (27%) or social support (27%) with studies targeting multiple themes 
simultaneously. This review highlights compelling evidence for the feasibility 
of text messaging for improvement of physical health in those suffering with 
psychotic disorders.

INTRODUCTION: Antiretroviral therapy (ART) has revolutionised the care of 
HIV-positive individuals resulting in marked decreases in morbidity and 
mortality, and markedly reduced transmission to sexual partners. However, these 
benefits can only be realised if individuals are aware of their HIV-positive 
status, initiated and retained on suppressive lifelong ART. Framed using the 
socio-ecological model, the present study explores factors contributing to poor 
ART uptake among community members despite high acceptance of HIV-testing within 
a Treatment as Prevention (TasP) trial. In this paper we identify barriers and 
facilitators to treatment across different levels of the socio-ecological 
framework covering individual, community and health system components.
METHODS: This research was embedded within a cluster-randomised trial 
(ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01509508) of HIV treatment as Prevention in rural 
KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Data were collected between January 2013 and July 
2014 from resident community members. Ten participants contributed to repeat 
in-depth interviews whilst 42 participants took part in repeat focus group 
discussions. Data from individual interviews and focus group discussions were 
triangulated using community walks to give insights into community members' 
perception of the barriers and facilitators of ART uptake. We used thematic 
analysis guided by a socio-ecological framework to analyse participants' 
narratives from both individual interviews and focus group discussions.
RESULTS: Barriers and facilitators operating at the individual, community and 
health system levels influence ART uptake. Stigma was an over-arching barrier, 
across all three levels and expressed variably as fear of HIV disclosure, 
concerns about segregated HIV clinical services and negative community religious 
perceptions. Other barriers were individual (substance misuse, fear of ART side 
effects), community (alternative health beliefs). Facilitators cited by 
participants included individual (expectations of improved health and longer 
life expectancy following ART, single tablet regimens), community (availability 
of ART in the community through mobile trial facilities) and health system 
factors (fast and efficient service provided by friendly staff).
DISCUSSION: We identified multiple barriers to achieving universal ART uptake. 
To enhance uptake in HIV care services, and achieve the full benefits of ART 
requires interventions that tackle persistent HIV stigma, and offer people with 
HIV respectful, convenient and efficient services. These interventions require 
evaluation in appropriately designed studies.

Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is one of the leading causes of blindness 
worldwide with increasing prevalence owing to increased life expectancy. 
Intravitreal injections of antivascular endothelial growth factor agents are 
commonly used in exudative AMD and oral antioxidant medication for nonexudative 
AMD; however, many disorders mimic exudative and nonexudative AMD, and 
misdiagnosis can seriously affect the management of these patients. We summarize 
the demographics and clinical and imaging characteristics of each of the 
conditions that masquerade as AMD. As some of the conditions have features of 
AMD, a short update on the classical features of AMD is also included.

In the past decades, adequate and well-planned management of chronic wounds has 
reached an elevated importance to improve human's quality of life and extend 
life expectancy. The need for more complex and biomimetic strategies has fueled 
the exploration of numerous emerging technologies. However, the development of 
new therapies requires an extensive knowledge of the wound healing process and 
the key players involved in it. In that sense, this review seeks to bring 
researchers an updated description of the wound healing process, combining the 
traditionally-told phase progression with the presence and function of diverse 
stem cells and other involved mediators. Furthermore, the present work discusses 
a wide variety of strategies for accelerating wound healing; from systemic or 
local dressing-free therapies, to cell-free dressings including films, 
biopolymeric porous scaffolds, electrospun nanofiber meshes and hydrogels. 
Finally, emerging therapy solutions derived from the development of 3D 
bioprinting and CRISPR/Cas9 technology or the application of extracellular 
vesicles in healing chronic wounds are also discussed.

BACKGROUND: Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is an in-situ (pre-cancerous) breast 
malignancy whereby malignant cells are contained within the basement membrane of 
the breast ducts. Increasing awareness that some low-risk forms of DCIS might 
remain indolent for many years has led to concern about overtreatment, with at 
least 3 clinical trials underway internationally assessing the safety of active 
monitoring for low-risk DCIS. This study aimed to understand healthcare 
professionals' (HCPs) views on the management options for patients with DCIS.
METHODS: Qualitative study using semi-structured interviews with HCPs involved 
in the diagnosis and management of DCIS in Australia and New Zealand. Interviews 
were audio-recorded, transcribed and analysed thematically using Framework 
Analysis method.
RESULTS: Twenty-six HCPs including 10 breast surgeons, 3 breast physicians, 6 
radiation oncologists, and 7 breast care nurses participated. There was a strong 
overall consensus that DCIS requires active treatment. HCPs generally felt 
uncomfortable recommending active monitoring as a management option for low-risk 
DCIS as they viewed this as outside current standard care. Overall, HCPs felt 
that active monitoring was an unproven strategy in need of an evidence base; 
however, many acknowledged that active monitoring for low-risk DCIS could be 
appropriate for patients with significant co-morbidities or limited life 
expectancy. They believed that most patients would opt for surgery wherever 
possible.
CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the important need for robust randomised 
controlled trial data about active monitoring for women with low-risk DCIS, to 
provide HCPs with confidence in their management recommendations and 
decision-making.

Analog hardware used for signal envelope extraction in low-power interfaces for 
acoustic event detection, owing to its low complexity and power consumption, 
suffers from low sensitivity and performs poorly under low signal to noise 
ratios (SNR) found in undersea environments. To overcome those problems, in this 
paper, we propose a novel passive electromechanical solution for the signal 
feature extraction in low frequency acoustic range (200-1000 Hz), in the form of 
a piezoelectric vibration transducer, and a rectifier with a mechanically 
switched inductor. A simulation study of the novel solution is presented, and a 
proof-of-concept device is developed and experimentally characterized. We 
demonstrate its applicability and show the advantages of the passive 
electromechanical device in comparison to the active electrical solution in 
terms of operation with lower input signals (<20 mV compared to 40 mV), and 
higher robustness in low SNR conditions (output voltage loss for -10 dB ≤ SNR < 
40 dB of 1 mV, compared to 10 mV). In addition to the signal processing 
performance improvements, compared to our previous work, the utilization of the 
presented novel passive feature extractor would also decrease power consumption 
of a detector's channel by over 76%, enabling life-time extension and/or 
increased quality of detection with larger number of channels. To the best of 
our knowledge, this is the first solution presented in the literature that 
demonstrates the possibility of using a passive electromechanical feature 
extractor in a low-power analog wake-up event detector interface.

INTRODUCTION: As the availability of new economic evaluations (EE) on adjuvant 
trastuzumab therapy for early-stage breast cancer (EBC) with HER2-positive since 
last search and other EEs missed warrant a more extensive review, this study 
aimed to systematically review EEs of adjuvant trastuzumab compared with 
chemotherapy alone for HER2-positive EBC.
AREA COVERED: The search was performed in February 2019 using MEDLINE and 
Scopus. Reviewers independently selected studies based on eligibility criteria, 
extracted data, assessed quality of reporting, and appraised quality of data 
sources.
EXPERT OPINION: 22 studies were included which were from high-income (HICs) and 
upper-middle income countries (UMICs). Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios 
(ICERs) from HICs were within their cost-effectiveness thresholds and ranged 
from 6,018 to 78,929 USD per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. ICERs 
from UMICs mostly exceeded their thresholds ranging from 3,526 to 174,901 USD 
per QALY gained. Evidence shows cost-effectiveness of trastuzumab for 
HER2-positive EBC in HICs. There were no methodological variations. The extent 
and adequacy of reporting were high. The quality of data sources was moderate to 
high. The quality of future EEs can be improved by enhancing the reporting 
quality, by using context-based data and real-world efficacy data, which would 
impact cost-effectiveness.

Background The improved life expectancy of patients with congenital heart 
disease is often accompanied by the development of atrial tachyarrhythmias. 
Similarly, the number of patients requiring redo operations is expected to 
continue to rise as these patients are aging. Consequently, the role of 
arrhythmia surgery in the treatment of atrial arrhythmias is likely to become 
more important in this population. Although atrial arrhythmia surgery is a 
well-established part of Fontan conversion procedures, evidence-based 
recommendations for arrhythmia surgery for macroreentrant atrial tachycardia and 
atrial fibrillation in other patients with congenital heart disease are still 
lacking. Methods and Results Twenty-eight studies were included in this 
systematic review. The median reported arrhythmia recurrence was 13% 
(interquartile range, 4%-26%) during follow-up ranging from 3 months to 
15.2 years. A large variation in surgical techniques was observed. Based on the 
acquired data, biatrial lesions are more effective in the treatment of atrial 
fibrillation than exclusive right-sided lesions. Right-sided lesions may be more 
appropriate in the treatment of macroreentrant atrial tachycardia; evidence for 
the superiority of additional left-sided lesions is lacking. There are not 
enough data to support the use of exclusive left-sided lesions. Theoretically, 
prophylactic atrial arrhythmia surgery may be beneficial in this population, but 
evidence is currently limited. Conclusions To be able to provide recommendations 
for arrhythmia surgery in patients with congenital heart disease, future studies 
should report outcomes according to the type of preoperative arrhythmia, 
underlying congenital heart disease, lesion set, and energy source. This is 
essential for determining which surgical techniques should ideally be applied 
under which circumstances.

BACKGROUND: Rice is an important human staple food vulnerable to heavy metal 
contamination leading to serious concerns. High yield with low heavy metal 
contamination is a common but highly challenging goal for rice breeders 
worldwide due to lack of genetic knowledge and markers.
RESULTS: To identify candidate QTLs and develop molecular markers for rice yield 
and heavy metal content, a total of 191 accessions from the USDA Rice mini-core 
collection with over 3.2 million SNPs were employed to investigate the QTLs. 
Sixteen ionomic and thirteen agronomic traits were analyzed utilizing two 
univariate (GLM and MLM) and two multivariate (MLMM and FarmCPU) GWAS methods. 
106, 47, and 97 QTLs were identified for ionomics flooded, ionomics unflooded, 
and agronomic traits, respectively, with the criterium of p-value 
< 1.53 × 10- 8, which was determined by the Bonferroni correction for p-value of 
0.05. While 49 (~ 20%) of the 250 QTLs were coinciding with previously reported 
QTLs/genes, about 201 (~ 80%) were new. In addition, several new candidate genes 
involved in ionomic and agronomic traits control were identified by analyzing 
the DNA sequence, gene expression, and the homologs of the QTL regions. Our 
results further showed that each of the four GWAS methods can identify unique as 
well as common QTLs, suggesting that using multiple GWAS methods can complement 
each other in QTL identification, especially by combining univariate and 
multivariate methods.
CONCLUSIONS: While 49 previously reported QTLs/genes were rediscovered, over 200 
new QTLs for ionomic and agronomic traits were found in the rice genome. 
Moreover, multiple new candidate genes for agronomic and ionomic traits were 
identified. This research provides novel insights into the genetic basis of both 
ionomic and agronomic variations in rice, establishing the foundation for marker 
development in breeding and further investigation on reducing heavy-metal 
contamination and improving crop yields. Finally, the comparative analysis of 
the GWAS methods showed that each method has unique features and different 
methods can complement each other.

BACKGROUND: Glucose-lowering therapy (GLT) should be individualized in older 
patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) according to their health status and their 
life expectancy. This study aimed at assessing the inappropriateness of GLT 
prescribing and the one-year mortality rate in geriatric patients with T2D.
METHODS: Retrospective cohort study of consecutive inpatients with T2D admitted 
to a geriatric ward of a Belgian university hospital. Inclusion criteria were 
age ≥ 75 years, T2D with GLT before admission, and HbA1c measurement during the 
hospital stay. Comorbidities and geriatric syndromes were collected. GLT agents 
were classified into hypoglycaemic and non-hypoglycaemic ones, and their dosages 
were expressed in daily defined dose (DDD). Health status (intermediate or poor) 
and GLT appropriateness (appropriate, overtreatment, undertreatment) were 
assessed according to the 2019 Endocrine Society guideline on diabetes treatment 
in older adults, in which GLT overtreatment requires the presence of 
hypoglycaemic therapy. One-year mortality was determined using the National 
Registry of vital status, and its associated factors were analysed using 
multivariable Cox' regression.
RESULTS: The 318 geriatric patients with T2D (median age 84 years; 46% female) 
were in intermediate (33%) or poor health (67%). These two groups reached 
similar low HbA1c values (median 6.9%) with similar GLT regimens. GLT 
overtreatment was frequent (57%) irrespectively of the geriatric features. 
One-year mortality rate was high (38.5%) and associated in multivariate analysis 
with poor health status (HR: 1.59, p = 0.033), malnutrition (HR: 1.67, 
p = 0.006) and GLT overtreatment (HR: 1.73, p = 0.023). Patients with GLT 
overtreatment had a higher mortality rate (44.5%).
CONCLUSIONS: GLT overtreatment was present in more than half of these geriatric 
patients. Many of them were in poor health status and died within one-year. 
Special attention should be paid to individualisation of the HbA1c goals in the 
geriatric patients with diabetes, and to GLT de-intensification in those being 
over-treated.

OBJECTIVES: Over the past 3 decades there have been significant advances in the 
development of pharmaceutical and rehabilitative treatments for persons with 
multiple sclerosis (MS), such that life expectancy is continuing to increase. 
Whilst these advancements are exciting, there are also concerns and unknowns 
regarding what it is like to age with MS. The objectives of this research were 
to explore the lived experiences and meaning of aging in conjunction with having 
MS.
METHODS: Semi-structured interviews with 40 persons with MS over 60 years were 
conducted. Thereafter data were subject to an existential phenomenological 
analysis.
RESULTS: Four different ways were discussed with regards to embodied experiences 
of aging with MS: aging makes MS worse; MS makes aging worse; aging makes MS 
better; and MS makes aging better.
DISCUSSION: This research highlighted the complexity of aging with MS and the 
various of ways persons over 60 with MS experience and interpret this 
phenomenon.

Narratives of home and neighbourhood within state-subsidised aged housing in 
Durban, South Africa.

KwaZulu-Natal, Centenary Building, Howard College Campus, Durban 4001, South 
Africa. Electronic address: KalinaM@ukzn.ac.za.

The purpose of this article is to examine the meaning of 'home' and 
'neighbourhood' to individuals living within state-subsidised aged housing, and 
to explore the role that those meanings play in shaping respondent's daily lives 
and identities. The work is based on an examination of Langeler Towers, a 
purpose-built housing facility in Durban, South Africa. Drawing on extensive 
qualitative, participatory fieldwork, including focus groups and creative 
drawing exercises, the findings suggest that for these individuals 'home' is a 
deeply personal place attachment that transforms a given place into an 
expression of an individual's identity, as well as a core element of their 
concept of self. 'Neighbourhood' can be considered an extension of 'home'- a 
place of comfort, family, and community. Moreover, these understandings of 
'home' and 'neighbourhood' remain largely static throughout the life course and 
continue to inform residents' identities and expectations during and after their 
transition into aged housing. However, although residents were willing to 
negotiate on certain aspects of change during the transition into aged housing, 
such as their connection to material possessions, social attachments, such as to 
family, were seen as non-negotiable. For many, being able to maintain a tangible 
connection to loved ones, either living or deceased, with whom they no longer 
reside, was the fundamental aspect of 'home' and self-identity. These findings 
have important ramifications for an increasingly aging and urbanising South 
African population, and are also relevant for other low or middle-income 
national contexts.

OBJECTIVES: To develop a fracture risk Clinical Assessment Protocol (CAP) based 
on long-term care (LTC) fracture prevention recommendations and an embedded 
fracture risk assessment tool.
DESIGN: A modified Delphi consensus approach including 2 survey rounds and a 
face-to-face meeting was implemented to reach consensus on matching of LTC 
fracture prevention guideline statements to Fracture Risk Scale (FRS) risk 
levels.
SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A national panel of recognized experts in 
osteoporosis, fractures, and long-term care, including an LTC resident and 
family members.
METHODS: Round 1 survey respondents (n = 24) were provided the LTC fracture 
prevention guidelines matched to FRS risk levels and were asked whether they 
agreed the guideline was appropriate for the risk level (yes, no, I don't know, 
I agree with some but not all of it) and to provide comments. In round 2, 
guideline statements that did not achieve consensus (≥80% agreement) were 
revised consistent with comments provided in round 1 and respondents were asked 
again if they agreed with the guideline statement. Statements that did not 
achieve consensus were to be discussed and resolved in an in-person meeting 
(n = 17).
RESULTS: In round 1 (75% response rate), consensus was achieved in 7/14 
guideline statements. In round 2 (56% response rate), 5 statements were revised 
based on round 1 feedback and for 2 statements additional information was 
provided. Consensus was achieved in all but one statement related to the 
inappropriateness of pharmacologic therapy for residents with life expectancy 
less than 1 year. Following facilitated meeting discussions, consensus was 
obtained to revise the guideline statement to reflect that life expectancy was 
but one of several criteria that should be used to inform medication decisions.
CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: An evidence-based fracture risk CAP was developed 
that will be embedded in international routine clinical assessment tools to 
guide fracture prevention in LTC.

Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1), the most common muscular dystrophy in adults, 
is an autosomal dominant disorder with a wide phenotypic spectrum ranging from 
oligosymptomatic forms to a life-threatening, multisystem disease. People with 
DM1 overall have a reduced life expectancy, mainly due to respiratory or cardiac 
causes. There is no cure but prompt, appropriate symptom management is essential 
to limit disease-related complications. We present a case of DM1, unrecognised 
when the patient presented with recurrent type 2 respiratory failure, and 
initially misdiagnosed as Guillain-Barré syndrome. This misdiagnosis 
subsequently led to unnecessary investigation and treatment before further 
detailed neurological examination and collateral family history gave the 
diagnosis. This case highlights the importance of considering a chronic 
neuromuscular disorder in patients presenting with acute respiratory failure and 
an unusual pattern of weakness.

OBJECTIVE: There are large inequities in the lung cancer burden for the 
Indigenous Māori population of New Zealand. We model the potential lifetime 
health gains, equity impacts and cost-effectiveness of a national low-dose CT 
(LDCT) screening programme for lung cancer in smokers aged 55-74 years with a 30 
pack-year history, and for formers smokers who have quit within the last 15 
years.
DESIGN: A Markov macrosimulation model estimated: health benefits 
(health-adjusted life-years (HALYs)), costs and cost-effectiveness of biennial 
LDCT screening. Input parameters came from literature and NZ-linked health 
datasets.
SETTING: New Zealand.
PARTICIPANTS: Population aged 55-74 years in 2011.
INTERVENTIONS: Biennial LDCT screening for lung cancer compared with usual care.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated using 
the average difference in costs and HALYs between the screened and the 
unscreened populations. Equity analyses included substituting non-Māori values 
for Māori values of background morbidity, mortality and stage-specific survival. 
Changes in inequities in lung cancer survival and 'health-adjusted life 
expectancy' (HALE) were measured.
RESULTS: LDCT screening in NZ is likely to be cost-effective for the total 
population: NZ$34 400 per HALY gained (95% uncertainty interval NZ$27 500 to 
NZ$42 900) and for Māori separately (using a threshold of gross domestic product 
per capita NZ$45 000). Health gains per capita for Māori females were twice that 
for non-Māori females and 25% greater for Māori males compared with non-Māori 
males. LDCT screening will narrow absolute inequities in HALE and lung cancer 
mortality for Māori, but will slightly increase relative inequities in mortality 
from lung cancer (compared with non-Māori) due to differential stage-specific 
survival.
CONCLUSION: A national biennial LDCT lung cancer screening programme in New 
Zealand is likely to be cost-effective, will improve total population health and 
reduce health inequities for Māori. Attention must be paid to addressing ethnic 
inequities in stage-specific lung cancer survival.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most frequent cancer type in both males and 
females, with about 35% of patients being diagnosed in stage IV metastatic 
disease. Despite advancements in treatment, life expectancy in patients with 
metastatic disease is still not satisfying. Due to frequent drug resistance 
during conventional and targeted cancer treatments, the development and testing 
of multi-target therapies is an important research field. Medicinal mushrooms 
specific isolated compounds as well as complex extract mixtures have been 
studied in depth, and many mushroom species have been proven to be non-toxic 
multi-target inhibitors of specific oncogenic pathways, as well as potent 
immunomodulators. In this study, we have performed a tandem mass tags 
qualitative and quantitative proteomic analyses of CT26.WT colon cancer tumor 
tissues from Balb/c mice treated with the studied medicinal mushroom extract 
mixture, with or without 5-fluorouracil. Besides significantly improved 
survival, obtained results reveal that Agarikon.1 alone, and in combination with 
5-fluorouracil exert their anticancer effects by affecting several fundamental 
processes important in CRC progression. Bioinformatic analysis of up- and 
downregulated proteins revealed that ribosomal biogenesis and translation is 
downregulated in treatment groups, while the unfolded protein response (UPR), 
lipid metabolism and tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) are upregulated. Moreover, 
we found that many known clinical biomarkers and protein clusters important in 
CRC progression and prognosis are affected, which are a good basis for an 
expanded translational study of the herein presented treatment.

BACKGROUND: The life expectancy for people with sickle cell disease (SCD) has 
improved tremendously over the last 50 years. This population experiences 
hemolysis and vaso-occlusion in multiple organs that lead to complications such 
as cardiopulmonary disease, strokes, and avascular necrosis. These complications 
can limit mobility and aerobic endurance, similar to limitations that often 
occur in geriatric populations. These sickle-cell and age-related events lead to 
frequent hospitalization, which further increases the risk of functional 
decline. We have few tools to measure functional decline in people with SCD. The 
purpose of this paper is to describe a protocol to evaluate the feasibility of 
sickle cell disease geriatric assessment (SCD-GA).
METHODS/DESIGN: We will enroll 40 adults with SCD (20 age 18-49.99 years and 20 
age ≥ 50 years) in a prospective cohort study to assess the feasibility of 
SCD-GA. The SCD-GA includes validated measures from the oncology geriatric 
assessment enriched with additional physical and cognitive measures. The SCD-GA 
will be performed at the first study visit, at 10 to 20 days after 
hospitalization, and at 12 months (exit visit). With input from a 
multidisciplinary team of sickle cell specialists, geriatricians, and experts in 
physical function and physical activity, we selected assessments across 7 
domains: functional status (11 measures), comorbid medical conditions (1 
measure), psychological state (1 measure), social support (2 measures), weight 
status (2 measures), cognition (3 measures), and medications (1 measure). We 
will measure the proportion completing the assessment with feasibility as the 
primary outcome. Secondary outcomes include the proportion consenting and 
completing all study visits, duration of the assessment, acceptability, and 
adverse events.
DISCUSSION: We present the protocol and rationale for selection of the measures 
included in SCD-GA. We also outline the methods to determine feasibility and 
subsequently to optimize the SCD-GA in preparation for a larger multicenter 
validation study of the SCD-GA.
