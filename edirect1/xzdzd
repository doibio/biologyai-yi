BACKGROUND: A recent dramatic surge in pet ownership has been observed across 
metropolitan areas in Asia. To date, there is a dearth of information on the 
risk associated with pet ownership for the transmission of parasites on a large 
scale in Asia, despite this continent giving rise to the largest burden of 
zoonotic infections worldwide.
METHODS: We explored the nature and extent of zoonotic internal (endo-) and 
external (ecto-) parasites and arthropod-borne pathogens in 2381 client-owned 
dogs and cats living in metropolitan areas of eight countries in East and 
Southeast Asia using reliable diagnostic tests and then undertook extensive 
statistical analyses to define predictors of exposure to zoonotic pathogens.
RESULTS: The estimated ORs for overall parasite infections are 1.35 [95% CIs 
1.07;1.71] in young animals and 4.10 [1.50;11.2] in the animal group older than 
15 years as compared with adult animals, 0.61 [0.48;0.77] in neutered animals as 
compared to unneutered animals, 0.36 [0.26;0.50] in animals living in urban 
areas as compared with rural areas, 1.14 [1.08;1.21] for each 1 °C increase of 
annual mean temperature which varies from 12.0 to 28.0 °C, and 0.86 [0.78;0.95] 
for each year of life expectancy which varies from 70.9 to 83.3 years.
CONCLUSIONS: Here we highlight the influence of human life expectancy and the 
neutering status of the animals, which reflect increased living standards 
through access to education and human and veterinary health care, to be both 
strongly associated with exposure to zoonotic parasites. An integrated approach 
of local and international authorities to implement and manage educational 
programs will be crucial for the control of zoonotic infections of companion 
animals in Asia.

Plain Language Summary: Parasites live on or inside animals or humans and can 
cause disease. Companion animals (pets) with parasites present a potential risk 
to the health of their owners, as certain kinds of parasites (known as zoonotic 
parasites) can affect both animal and human health. Here, we investigated 
whether human social conditions are associated with zoonotic parasite infections 
in companion animals in East and Southeast Asia. We found that higher human life 
expectancy and neutering of the companion animals were associated with fewer 
zoonotic parasite infections in the animals. These findings highlight the need 
for an enhanced commitment of local authorities to establish prevention 
campaigns, including education programs, against zoonotic pathogens. These 
measures will play a crucial role in alleviating the impact of these diseases in 
companion animals and humans in Asia.

Endocrine cancer is an uncontrolled growth of cells in the hormone-producing 
glands. Endocrine cancers include the adrenal, thyroid, parathyroid, pancreas, 
pituitary, and ovary malignancy. Recently, there is an increase in the incidence 
of the most common endocrine cancer types, namely pancreatic and thyroid 
cancers. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) of endocrine tumors have received more 
attention due to their role in cancer progression, therapeutic resistance, and 
cancer relapse. Phytochemicals provide several health benefits and are effective 
in the treatment of various diseases including cancer. Therefore, finding the 
natural phytochemicals that target the CSCs will help to improve cancer 
patients' prognosis and life expectancy. Phytochemicals have been shown to have 
anticancer properties and are very effective in treating various cancer types. 
Curcumin is a common polyphenol found in turmeric, which has been shown to 
promote cellular drug accumulation and increase the effectiveness of 
chemotherapy. Moreover, various other phytochemicals such as resveratrol, 
genistein, and apigenin are effective against different endocrine cancers by 
regulating the CSCs. Thus, phytochemicals have emerged as chemotherapeutics that 
may have significance in preventing and treating the endocrine cancers.

INTRODUCTION: Rectus femoris injuries are common in sports requiring sprinting 
and kicking, especially in football. In addition to sports injuries, rectus 
femoris injuries can occur during physically active daily living and physical 
work. Most muscle injuries heal well by conservative treatment, but more severe 
ruptures often require surgical treatment, especially in athletes. Some ruptures 
can cause so severe functional loss of the muscle that it causes problems also 
in everyday life. Complete rectus femoris mid-substance rupture is a rare injury 
type, which tends to recover poorly and cause significant functional deficit. 
Descriptions of this injury type are mainly lacking in the literature and there 
is no consensus on the management of these injuries. To the best of our 
knowledge, this is the first report of this kind in the literature including 
strength measurements pre- and post-operatively.
CASE REPORT: We report a case of a 48-year-old Caucasian man who suffered a 
complete rectus femoris mid-substance rupture at physically active work. The 
injury mechanism was slipping on an asphalt ramp, leading to rapid eccentric 
contraction of rectus femoris involving knee flexion and hip extension. The 
rupture was treated surgically and the muscle strength of quadriceps femoris was 
measured pre- and postoperatively.
CONCLUSION: This case report showed that muscle strength in knee extension 
recovers well after an operative treatment of complete rectus femoris 
mid-substance rupture. Therefore, it can be concluded that operative treatment 
is beneficial for this specific injury type. This case report brings important 
and objective evidence on the relevance of surgical treatment in these injuries 
that are mainly lacking the consensus about the best treatment methods. To the 
best of our knowledge, this case report is also the first one which indirectly 
shows the value of isolated rectus femoris muscle in the whole quadriceps muscle 
group.

Introduction: Hypoxia context is highly specific for tumors and represents a 
unique niche which is not found elsewhere in the body. Clostridium novyi is an 
obligate anaerobic bacterium. It has a potential to treat tumors. The aim of 
this study was to produce the C. novyi nontoxic spores and to investigate its 
oncolytic effect on breast cancer in mice model. Methods: Primarily, the lethal 
toxin gene in C. novyi type B was removed. Colonies were isolated using PCR 
testing. To assure the removal of alpha-toxin, plasmid extraction and in vivo 
assay were conducted. Next, to treat breast cancer model in different sizes of 
tumors, a single dose of spores of C. novyi nontoxic was tested. Results: The 
results denoted that C. novyi nontoxic lost lethal toxin and a--ppeared to be 
safe. For smaller than 1000 mm3 tumors, a single dose of C. novyi nontoxic was 
able to cure 100% of mice bearing breast tumors. Hence the mice remained free of 
tumor relapse. Tumors larger than 1000 mm3 were not cured by a single dose- of 
C. novyi nontoxic treatment. Conclusion: The experiment concluded that the C. 
novyi nontoxic might be a suitable and safe candidate, a novel therapeutic 
approach to encounter such hypoxic regions in the center of tumors. Research 
also showed that bacteriolytic therapy by C. novyi nontoxic could lead to 
regression in small tumor.

Institute of Medical Sciences, Wardha, IND.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is one of the most frequent motor neuron 
illnesses. Motor neuron illnesses are various disorders that include upper and 
lower motor neuron abnormalities. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis accounts for 
roughly 80% of motor neuron disorders. ALS is a fatal motor neuron disease that 
involves the loss of motor neurons in the spinal cord and brain, resulting in 
gliosis and muscle weakening and wasting in the upper, lower, and respiratory 
muscles, reducing life expectancy to 2-5 years from the onset of symptoms. Up 
until now, oral riluzole, a glutamatergic neurotransmitter inhibitor, has been 
used to manage ALS, the only drug for the management of ALS that has been 
approved by the United States (US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA). In recent 
studies, edaravone has been used through intravenous mode to halt the 
progression of ALS. We conducted a systematic search on PubMed; we selected 
Google Scholar, PubMed, websites regarding ALS, WebMD, Researchgate, als.org, 
consultant360, and the relevant articles for the review. It shows us riluzole 
and edaravone's efficacy for managing A.L.S. and how it can increase the life 
span of the patients.

To determine the effect of calving season on perinatal nutrient availability and 
neonatal beef calf vigor, data were collected from 4 spring- (average calving 
date: February 14; n = 203 total) and 4 fall- (average calving date: September 
20; n = 179 total) calving experiments. Time to stand was determined as minutes 
from birth to standing for 5 s. After birth, calf weight and size (length, heart 
and abdominal girth, and cannon circumference) were recorded. Jugular blood 
samples and rectal temperatures were obtained at 0, 6, 12, and 24 h postnatally 
in 6 experiments and at 48 h postnatally in Exp. 2 to 8. Data were analyzed with 
fixed effects of season (single point) or season, hour, and their interaction 
(over time, using repeated measures). Experiment was a random effect; calf sex 
was included when P ≤ 0.25. Within calving season, correlations were determined 
between calf size, vigor, and 48-h serum total protein. Fall-born calves tended 
to have lighter (P = 0.09) birth weight and faster (P = 0.05) time to stand than 
spring-born calves. Season did not affect (P ≥ 0.18) gestation length, other 
calf size measures, or 48-h serum total protein. Fall-born calves had greater (P 
≤ 0.003) rectal temperature at 0, 24, and 48 h postnatal. Spring-born calves had 
greater (P ≤ 0.009) circulating glucose at 0 h, serum non-esterified fatty acids 
at 0 and 6 h, and plasma triglycerides at 0, 6, 12, and 48 h. Fall-born calves 
had greater (P ≤ 0.03) sodium from 6 to 48 h and magnesium from 0 to 24 h of 
age. Phosphorus was greater (P ≤ 0.02) at 6 and 12 h of age in spring-born 
calves. Spring-born calves had greater (P ≤ 0.04) aspartate aminotransferase at 
12 and 24 h and creatine kinase at 0 and 12 h of age. Fall-born calves had 
greater (P ≤ 0.03) albumin, calcium, and chloride, had lower (P ≤ 0.03) 
bicarbonate and direct bilirubin, and tended to have greater (P = 0.10) anion 
gap (all main effects of calving season). Calf birth weight had a weak positive 
relationship (P ≤ 0.03) with 48-h serum total protein and time to stand in 
fall-born, but not spring-born, calves. Overall, fetal growth was restricted and 
neonatal dehydration was increased by warm conditions for fall-born calves, but 
vigor and metabolism were negatively affected by cold conditions in spring-born 
calves. These data suggest that calving season influences perinatal nutrient 
availability, which may impact the transition of beef calves to postnatal life.

Cystic fibrosis is the most common life-limiting autosomal recessive condition 
in Australia. A defect in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance 
regulator protein affects chloride transport across epithelial cells. Patients 
with cystic fibrosis produce thick sticky mucus. This causes problems in 
multiple organs, particularly the lungs. Cystic fibrosis modulator therapies can 
partially correct the underlying pathophysiology and improve chloride transport, 
thereby improving morbidity. Life expectancy is improving, so many patients are 
now developing chronic diseases associated with ageing. All health professionals 
should be aware that the cystic fibrosis modulator therapies are metabolised via 
cytochrome P450 pathways in the liver. There are therefore significant drug-drug 
interactions with medicines metabolised by the same pathways.

Preliminary remarks to an integrative theory of evolution.

Witzany G(1).

Author information:
(1)Telos-Philosophische Praxis Buermoos, Austria - witzany @sbg.at.

For nearly a century the main focus in biological disciplines such as molecular 
biology, biochemistry, genetics and evolutionary theory was cellular life as a 
machine like process in which mechanistic pathways regulate metabolism, genetic 
reading and translation into proteins and evolution by variations (random error 
replications) and selection. Modern biochemistry started with the cellular 
theory of life. Also the modern synthesis focused on cells at the starting event 
of life. The dominance of this paradigm lasted until ten years ago. Then the 
comeback of virology offered new empirical data and explanatory models of how 
viruses determine cellular life through an abundance of parasite host 
interactions that overrule cellular processes. The RNA world hypothesis 
demonstrated that prior to cellular life RNA group interactions were at the 
beginning of biological selection before cellular life emerged. Last but not 
least the central dogma of molecular biology collapsed when epigenetics 
demonstrated that history and developmental experiences of the past can be 
epigenetically imprinted and serve as identity markings that in every 
replication process of any cell in any organism on this planet the timely and 
locally coordinated replication is regulated and orchestrated by these 
programmings. In the light of this knowledge a better explanatory model than an 
extension of the modern synthesis will be more successful in the 21st century.

INTRODUCTION: Urolithiasis is one of the most common urological diseases in 
adults. Increased life expectancy of the population in developed countries, make 
urolithiasis topical issue and requires close attention. Due to the high risk of 
recurrent stone formation causing repeated surgical interventions, the issue of 
effective urinary stone metaphylaxis is very important today.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: To study the current state of the problem of urolithiasis 
metaphylaxis among Russian urologists, an anonymous questionnaire was applied. A 
25-question questionnaire was sent to e-mail to more than 4,000 Russian 
urologists. A total of 1,238 specialists completed the questionnaire. The 
database compiled from the received responses was processed and presented with 
descriptive statistics in the form of tables and charts.
RESULTS: According to the survey, more than half of the 831 (67.1%) specialists 
specialized in the treatment of urolithiasis. It was noted that 626 (86%) 
inpatient urologists and 205 (40%) outpatient urologists specialized in the 
treatment of urolithiasis. Only 521 (69.6%) urologists specializing in surgical 
treatment of urolithiasis give a patient a stone fragment to analyze its 
chemical composition. At the same time, half of the respondents reported that 
less than 10% of patients come to them for further metaphylaxis. One of the main 
reasons for not analyzing the chemical composition of the stone was the fact 
that 877 (70,84%) specialists indicated the inaccessibility of analysis under 
the state guarantee program, 503 (40,63%) specialists indicated the patients 
satisfaction with the results of minimally invasive surgical treatment and lack 
of sufficient motivation for further examinations. At the same time, less than 
3% of specialists can perform stone analysis within the framework of the state 
guaranty program. 1180 (96,8%) respondents practiced the prophylaxis of 
recurrent calculi formation, but only 336 (28,47%) performed comprehensive 
metabolic examination of all patients followed by prescription of drug therapy 
and appropriate diet.
CONCLUSIONS: Our survey revealed low involvement of urologists at the outpatient 
level in the process of conservative treatment and metaphylaxis of urolithiasis, 
low activity of urologists in performing complex metabolic study and 
comprehensive prevention of recurrent stone formation, low percentage of 
performing chemical composition analysis of stone and low activity of urologists 
in performing primary litholytic therapy of urate stones. Based on this analysis 
of the responses of most Russian urologists, it is possible to formulate 
recommendations to remove the obstacles to providing patients with urolithiasis 
with quality medical care in terms of conservative therapy and metaphylaxis of 
urolithiasis.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of collaborative versus usual care 
in adults with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes and depression in India.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We performed a within-trial cost-effectiveness 
analysis of a 24-month parallel, open-label, pragmatic randomized clinical trial 
at four urban clinics in India from multipayer and societal perspectives. The 
trial randomly assigned 404 patients with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes 
(HbA1c ≥8.0%, systolic blood pressure ≥140 mmHg, or LDL cholesterol ≥130 mg/dL) 
and depressive symptoms (9-item Patient Health Questionnaire score ≥10) to 
collaborative care (support from nonphysician care coordinators, electronic 
registers, and specialist-supported case review) for 12 months, followed by 12 
months of usual care or 24 months of usual care. We calculated incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) in Indian rupees (INR) and international 
dollars (Int'l-$) and the probability of cost-effectiveness using 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and depression-free days (DFDs).
RESULTS: From a multipayer perspective, collaborative care costed an additional 
INR309,558 (Int'l-$15,344) per QALY and an additional INR290.2 (Int'l-$14.4) per 
DFD gained compared with usual care. The probability of cost-effectiveness was 
56.4% using a willingness to pay of INR336,000 (Int'l-$16,654) per QALY 
(approximately three times per-capita gross domestic product). The willingness 
to pay per DFD to achieve a probability of cost-effectiveness >95% was INR401.6 
(Int'l-$19.9). From a societal perspective, cost-effectiveness was marginally 
lower. In sensitivity analyses, integrating collaborative care in clinical 
workflows reduced incremental costs by ∼47% (ICER 162,689 per QALY, 
cost-effectiveness probability 89.4%), but cost-effectiveness decreased when 
adjusting for baseline values.
CONCLUSIONS: Collaborative care for patients with type 2 diabetes and depression 
in urban India can be cost-effective, especially when integrated in clinical 
workflows. Long-term cost-effectiveness might be more favorable. Scalability 
across lower- and middle-income country settings depends on heterogeneous 
contextual factors.

To promote health awareness and improve life expectancy in Hirosaki, a Japanese 
rural area, the Center of Healthy Aging Program (CHAP) was founded in 2013. The 
most important characteristic of CHAP is a personalized interview just after the 
checkup to discuss individual results. We evaluated the clinical and economic 
effects of CHAP by analyzing the cohort data of voluntary participants from 
annual health checkups since 2005 in the Iwaki district of Hirosaki. We 
calculated 10-year incidence risk scores for coronary heart diseases (CHDs) and 
stroke, and compared the risk-score trend before and after the start of CHAP by 
adjusting other risk factors using multivariate generalized linear regression 
analyses. We also predicted the 10-year incidences of CHDs and stroke based on 
the risk scores, for future scenarios of the two conditions, with and without 
CHAP, and compared them to their treatment costs between scenarios. The number 
of participants ranged between 808 and 1,167, from 2008 to 2016. The mean age 
(55 years) and proportion of women (60%) did not significantly change throughout 
the period. After adjusting for sex, age, outside temperature on the checkup 
date, the preparation effect of CHAP in 2012, and risk scores in the previous 
year, the annual increases in risk scores of CHDs and stroke were significant 
even after CHAP (+0.413, p <0.001; +0.169, p <0.001, respectively), but slightly 
less compared to before CHAP (+2.638, p <0.001; +1.155, p <0.001, respectively). 
Assuming the trend continued until 2021, the 10-year incidences of CHDs and 
stroke have decreases by 22,486 and 9,603, respectively, and treatment costs 
decreased by JPY 21,973 and 16,056 million, respectively. CHAP contributes to a 
significant decrease in the incidences of CHDs and stroke, and reduces economic 
burden on the local government.

OBJECTIVE: To describe the trend in incidence, mortality and Disability Adjusted 
Life Years of oral cancer in Latin America according to sex between 2000 and 
2020.
METHODS: This ecological study extracted oral cancer information from 20 Latin 
American countries from the GBD-2020 database. Oral cancer burden was described 
by age-standardized rate (ASR) of incidence, mortality, and DALYs. The data was 
compared according to sex and countries. Trends (Average Annual Percentage 
Change-AAPC) were estimated for each indicator, sex, and country between 2000 
and 2020 using Joint-point software.
RESULTS: Between 2000 and 2020, the highest incidence of oral cancer (ASR) 
occurred in Cuba (5.18), Brazil (4.38) and Uruguay (4.62). The countries with 
the highest mortality for both sexes were (ASR): Cuba (2.89), Brazil (2.71) and 
the Dominican Republic (2.58). The DALYs registered an average of 37.52 (Women: 
22.39; Men: 52.62). The Dominican Republic reports increasing trends in 
incidence (AAPC: Men: 2.2; Women: 1.4), in mortality (AAPC: Men: 1.8; Women: 
1.1), and in DALYs (AAPC: Men: 1.0; Women: 2.0). Costa Rica shows decreasing 
trends in men in incidence (AAPC: -1.3), mortality (AAPC: -1.6), and DALYs 
(AAPC: -1.8).
CONCLUSION: Oral cancer shows increasing trends in: the incidence in both sexes 
in 10 countries, in mortality and DALYs in 6 countries, while the affectation 
between sexes does not show differences in trends.

BACKGROUND: Racial inequities in maternal mortality in the U.S. continue to be 
stark.
METHODS: The 2015-2018, 4-year total population, county-level, pregnancy-related 
mortality ratio (PRM; deaths per 100,000 live births; National Center for Health 
Statistics (NCHS), restricted use mortality file) was linked with the Public 
Health Exposome (PHE). Using data reduction techniques, 1591 variables were 
extracted from over 62,000 variables for use in this analysis, providing 
information on the relationships between PRM and the social, health and health 
care, natural, and built environments. Graph theoretical algorithms and Bayesian 
analysis were applied to PHE/PRM linked data to identify latent networks.
RESULTS: PHE variables most strongly correlated with total population PRM were 
years of potential life lost and overall life expectancy. Population-level 
indicators of PRM were overall poverty, smoking, lack of exercise, heat, and 
lack of adequate access to food.
CONCLUSIONS: In this high-dimensional analysis, overall life expectancy, poverty 
indicators, and health behaviors were found to be the strongest predictors of 
pregnancy-related mortality. This provides strong evidence that maternal death 
is part of a broader constellation of both similar and unique health behaviors, 
social determinants and environmental exposures as other causes of death.

To understand the synergetic features of economy, society, and ecology in 
cities, we established an urban ecological-economic-social synergetic index 
evaluation system from three aspects (per capita green area, per capita GDP, and 
life expectancy per capita) and created an urban ecological-economic-social 
synergetic index eva-luation method. We analyzed the synergetic features by 
comparing the ecological-economic-social synergetic index and comprehensive 
function scores of 35 typical cities in China. The differences in 
ecological-economic-social synergy and function score for different city sizes 
and administrative divisions were investigated, while the synergy level of 
cities were classified. The results showed that the average 
ecological-economic-social synergetic index of 35 cities in China was 28.79, 
with the highest of 3.83 and the lowest of 63.04 in 2016. The synergetic index, 
urban econo-mic function, and social function were significantly positively 
correlated with urban population sizes and economic sizes. There were 
significant differences in synergetic index among cities with different 
population sizes, economic sizes, and administrative functions. The urbanization 
in China was still in the status of functional imbalance. Urban development was 
conducive to improve cities' function, but did not effectively improve the 
synergy of ecology, economy, and society. The ecological function of cities 
significantly affected urban synergy, which indicated that the poor urban 
ecological function was the main restrictive factor for urban synergy in China.

为认识城市经济社会和生态的协同特征,本研究基于城市人均绿地面积、人均GDP和人均期望寿命等构建城市生态与经济社会功能协同性指标评价体系,建立城市生态与经济社会协同性指数评价方法。通过比较中国35个典型城市的协同性指数与功能综合得分,分析了中国城市协同性特征,并按照城市规模、行政区类型分析城市协同性差异和城市功能综合得分差异,对协同水平进行分类。结果表明: 
2016年,中国35个城市生态与经济社会平均协同性指数为28.79,协同性最强城市的协同性指数为3.83,最弱的城市为63.04,表明中国城市协同性不高且城市间差异较大。协同性指数、城市经济功能、社会功能与城市人口规模、经济规模呈显著正相关。不同人口规模、经济规模、不同行政职能城市之间协同性指数差异具有显著性。中国城市化总体仍处于功能失衡的发展阶段,城市发展有利于各城市功能性提高但并未有效提升协同性,生态功能的高低显著影响城市协同性,城市生态功能不高是当前中国城市协同性高低的主要制约因素。.

In most eukaryotic organisms, cilia and flagella perform a variety of 
life-sustaining roles related to environmental sensing and motility. 
Cryo-electron microscopy has provided considerable insight into the morphology 
and function of flagellar structures, but studies have been limited to less than 
a dozen of the millions of known eukaryotic species. Ultrastructural information 
is particularly lacking for unicellular organisms in the Opisthokonta clade, 
leaving a sizeable gap in our understanding of flagella evolution between 
unicellular species and multicellular metazoans (animals). Choanoflagellates are 
important aquatic heterotrophs, uniquely positioned within the opisthokonts as 
the metazoans' closest living unicellular relatives. We performed cryo-focused 
ion beam milling and cryo-electron tomography on flagella from the 
choanoflagellate species Salpingoeca rosetta. We show that the axonemal dyneins, 
radial spokes, and central pair complex in S. rosetta more closely resemble 
metazoan structures than those of unicellular organisms from other 
suprakingdoms. In addition, we describe unique features of S. rosetta flagella, 
including microtubule holes, microtubule inner proteins, and the flagellar vane: 
a fine, net-like extension that has been notoriously difficult to visualize 
using other methods. Furthermore, we report barb-like structures of unknown 
function on the extracellular surface of the flagellar membrane. Together, our 
findings provide new insights into choanoflagellate biology and flagella 
evolution between unicellular and multicellular opisthokonts.

During the last decades, healthcare has undergone important changes. Increased 
life expectancy has given rise to an aging population that, according to the 
United Nations, is about to become one of the most important social 
transformations of the 21st century. Globally, there were 727 million people 
aged 65 or over in 2020 (9.3% of the total population) and this is estimated to 
increase to 16% by 2050 . In the European Union (EU), the percentage of the 
population aged 65 or over has increased from 9.6% in 1960 to 20.3% in 2019 and 
is projected to increase to 31.3% by 2100. We are also witnessing a process of 
aging of the elderly population, with a proportion of very old people (those 
aged 80 and over) in the total population of the European Union of 5.8% in 
2019 . Spain is one of the countries with the highest proportion of older 
people, with a percentage of citizens aged 65 or over in 2020 of 19.6% of the 
total population, and with a projection of 26.5% for 2035. Almost a third of 
this population (6%) are 80 years or older.

The mammalian cell nucleus contains dozens of membrane-less nuclear bodies that 
play significant roles in various aspects of gene expression. Several nuclear 
bodies are nucleated by specific architectural noncoding RNAs (arcRNAs) acting 
as structural scaffolds. We have reported that a minor population of cellular 
RNAs exhibits an unusual semi-extractable feature upon using the conventional 
procedure of RNA preparation and that needle shearing or heating of cell lysates 
remarkably improves extraction of dozens of RNAs. Because semi-extractable RNAs, 
including known arcRNAs, commonly localize in nuclear bodies, this feature may 
be a hallmark of arcRNAs. Using the semi-extractability of RNA, we performed 
genome-wide screening of semi-extractable long noncoding RNAs to identify new 
candidate arcRNAs for arcRNA under hyperosmotic and heat stress conditions. 
After screening stress-inducible and semi-extractable RNAs, hundreds of 
readthrough downstream-of-gene (DoG) transcripts over several hundreds of 
kilobases, many of which were not detected among RNAs prepared by the 
conventional extraction procedure, were found to be stress-inducible and 
semi-extractable. We further characterized some of the abundant DoGs and found 
that stress-inducible transient extension of the 3'-UTR made DoGs 
semi-extractable. Furthermore, they were localized in distinct nuclear foci that 
were sensitive to 1,6-hexanediol. These data suggest that semi-extractable DoGs 
exhibit arcRNA-like features and our semi-extractable RNA-seq is a powerful tool 
to extensively monitor DoGs that are induced under specific physiological 
conditions.

Estimation of kidney function is often part of daily clinical practice, mostly 
done by using the endogenous glomerular filtration rate (GFR)-markers creatinine 
or cystatin C. A recommendation to use both markers in parallel in 2010 has 
resulted in new knowledge concerning the pathophysiology of kidney disorders by 
the identification of a new set of kidney disorders, selective glomerular 
hypofiltration syndromes. These syndromes, connected to strong increases in 
mortality and morbidity, are characterized by a selective reduction in the 
glomerular filtration of 5-30 kDa molecules, such as cystatin C, compared to the 
filtration of small molecules <1 kDa dominating the glomerular filtrate, for 
example water, urea and creatinine. At least two types of such disorders, 
shrunken or elongated pore syndrome, are possible according to the pore model 
for glomerular filtration. Selective glomerular hypofiltration syndromes are 
prevalent in investigated populations, and patients with these syndromes often 
display normal measured GFR or creatinine-based GFR-estimates. The syndromes are 
characterized by proteomic changes promoting the development of atherosclerosis, 
indicating antibodies and specific receptor-blocking substances as possible new 
treatment modalities. Presently, the KDIGO guidelines for diagnosing kidney 
disorders do not recommend cystatin C as a general marker of kidney function and 
will therefore not allow the identification of a considerable number of patients 
with selective glomerular hypofiltration syndromes. Furthermore, as cystatin C 
is uninfluenced by muscle mass, diet or variations in tubular secretion and 
cystatin C-based GFR-estimation equations do not require controversial race or 
sex terms, it is obvious that cystatin C should be a part of future KDIGO 
guidelines.
