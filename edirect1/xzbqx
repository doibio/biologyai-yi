OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of routine intraoperative 
ultrasonography (IOUS), cholangiography (IOC), or expectant management without 
imaging (EM) for investigation of clinically silent common bile duct (CBD) 
stones during laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
BACKGROUND: The optimal algorithm for the evaluation of clinically silent CBD 
stones during routine cholecystectomy is unclear.
METHODS: A decision tree model of CBD exploration was developed to determine the 
optimal diagnostic approach based on preoperative probability of 
choledocholithiasis. The model was parameterized with meta-analyses of 
previously published studies. The primary outcome was incremental cost per 
quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained from each diagnostic strategy. A 
secondary outcome was the percentage of missed stones. Costs were from the 
perspective of the third party payer and sensitivity analyses were performed on 
all model parameters.
RESULTS: In the base case analysis with a prevalence of stones of 9%, IOUS was 
the optimal strategy, yielding more QALYs (0.9858 vs 0.9825) at a lower expected 
cost ($311 vs $574) than EM. IOC yielded more QALYs than EM in the base case 
(0.9854) but at a much higher cost ($1122). IOUS remained dominant as long as 
the preoperative probability of stones was above 3%; EM was the optimal strategy 
if the probability was less than 3%. The percentage of missed stones was 1.5% 
for IOUS, 1.8% for IOC and 9% for EM.
CONCLUSIONS: In the detection and resultant management of CBD stones for the 
majority of patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy, IOUS is 
cost-effective relative to IOC and EM.

BACKGROUND: While there have been investigations into the reduced neck injury 
rate of wearing protective helmets, there is little information on its effects 
on normal kinaesthetic neck function. This study aims to quantify the 
kinaesthetic and movement effects of the American football helmet.
METHODS: Fifteen British Collegiate American football players (mean age 22.2, SD 
1.9; BMI kg.m(2) 26.3, SD 3.7) were age and size matched to 11 non-American 
football playing university students (mean age 22.5, SD 3.6; BMI 24.3, SD 
3.3 kg.m(2)). Both groups had their active cervical range of motion and head 
repositioning accuracy measured during neck flexion/extension using a modified 
cervical range of motion device and a similarly modified football helmet.
RESULTS: Wearing helmets significantly reduced active cervical range of motion 
in extension in both groups (P = 0.007 and P = 0.001 Controls and American 
Footballers respectively). While both groups had similar repositioning when not 
wearing a helmet (flexion P = 0.99; extension P = 0.52), when wearing helmets, 
American football players appeared to be more accurate in relation to cervical 
kinaesthetic repositioning (ANOVA: P = 0.077: flexion effect size =0.84; 
extension effect size =0.38).
CONCLUSIONS: Wearing American football helmets significantly reduces the active 
cervical range of motion in extension, along with a change in the neutral head 
position. American footballers have a greater accuracy in repositioning their 
head from flexion (potentially enhanced proprioception) when wearing a helmet. 
This finding might allow development of a simple objective test to help discern 
presence of minor concussive or cervical musculoskeletal injury on or off the 
field.

Mortality rate, life expectancy, survival, and the impact of comorbidities on 
them in people with Parkinson's disease (PD) need to be assessed in settings 
with different sociodemographic backgrounds. We investigated mortality features 
in Iranian PD patients focusing on the role of cardiovascular multimorbidity on 
their survival. Data on mortality and comorbidity profile was gathered in a 
cohort of 190 individuals with idiopathic PD referred to a Movement Disorders 
Clinic. Standardized mortality ratio (SMR) compared to the Tehran general 
population was 3.44 and the life expectancy at birth was 67.4 (95% CI: 
59.1-75.8) yr. Patients with at least one cardiovascular comorbidity had a 
shorter survival time after PD onset (14.0 versus 29.2 yr, p = 0.012). The 
hazard ratio for death increased 2.8 times (95% CI: 1.5-5.2, p = 0.002) with one 
additional cardiovascular comorbidity. Among all comorbid conditions, stroke 
showed the strongest independent effect on mortality in PD patients [HR = 13.1 
(95% CI: 2.4-71.7), p = 0.003]. Conclusively, life expectancy was slightly lower 
in Iranian PD patients compared to the general population, while the SMR was 
high. Cardiometabolic multimorbidity substantially decreased survival in people 
with PD. Our study highlights the need for assessment, prevention, and treatment 
of cardiovascular morbidities in parkinsonian patients, given their effect on 
survival.

BACKGROUND: Atypical meningiomas are an intermediate grade brain tumour with a 
recurrence rate of 39-58 %. It is not known whether early adjuvant radiotherapy 
reduces the risk of tumour recurrence and whether the potential side-effects are 
justified. An alternative management strategy is to perform active monitoring 
with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and to treat at recurrence. There are no 
randomised controlled trials comparing these two approaches.
METHODS/DESIGN: A total of 190 patients will be recruited from 
neurosurgical/neuro-oncology centres across the United Kingdom, Ireland and 
mainland Europe. Adult patients undergoing gross total resection of intracranial 
atypical meningioma are eligible. Patients with multiple meningioma, optic nerve 
sheath meningioma, previous intracranial tumour, previous cranial radiotherapy 
and neurofibromatosis will be excluded. Informed consent will be obtained from 
patients. This is a two-stage trial (both stages will run in parallel): Stage 1 
(qualitative study) is designed to maximise patient and clinician acceptability, 
thereby optimising recruitment and retention. Patients wishing to continue will 
proceed to randomisation. Stage 2 (randomisation) patients will be randomised to 
receive either early adjuvant radiotherapy for 6 weeks (60 Gy in 30 fractions) 
or active monitoring. The primary outcome measure is time to MRI evidence of 
tumour recurrence (progression-free survival (PFS)). Secondary outcome measures 
include assessing the toxicity of the radiotherapy, the quality of life, 
neurocognitive function, time to second line treatment, time to death (overall 
survival (OS)) and incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) 
gained.
DISCUSSION: ROAM/EORTC-1308 is the first multi-centre randomised controlled 
trial designed to determine whether early adjuvant radiotherapy reduces the risk 
of tumour recurrence following complete surgical resection of atypical 
meningioma. The results of this study will be used to inform current 
neurosurgery and neuro-oncology practice worldwide.

The Dutch BETER consortium has established a national care infrastructure for 
Hodgkin lymphoma survivors. 'BETER' [the Dutch word for 'better'] stands for 
Better care after Hodgkin lymphoma (HL): Evaluation of long-term Treatment 
Effects and screening Recommendations. The survivorship care focuses on 
long-term effects of HL treatment. Over 10,000 HL survivors who were treated in 
the period spanning 1965-2008 have been identified. As part of the survivorship 
care initiative, specific BETER out-patient clinics have been set up. A 
dedicated website, www.beternahodgkin.nl, provides HL survivors with relevant 
information. The stakeholders of the BETER survivorship care programme aim to 
achieve an improved healthy life expectancy for patients treated for HL.

Because of early diagnosis, strict imaging follow-up, and advances in medical 
and surgical management, life expectancy of Marfan patients has dramatically 
improved since the 1970s. Although disease of the root and ascending aorta are 
more frequent in patients with connective tissue disorders, a subset of patients 
present with diffuse disease that might involve any portion of the 
thoracoabdominal aorta. Thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) has gained 
widespread acceptance for the treatment of different pathologies of the 
descending aorta. In contrast, TEVAR in patients with connective tissue 
disorders is associated with a high risk of early and mid-term complications and 
reinterventions. Currently, a consensus of experts recommend that an open 
approach should be reserved for use in acceptable risk candidates with 
connective tissue disorders. TEVAR should be considered solely in patients in a 
complex repeat surgical setting or in patients judged to have prohibitive open 
surgical risk. Finally, as a bridge to a definite open repair, TEVAR might be 
life-saving in patients with connective tissue disorders who present with 
exsanguination or severe malperfusion. Future developments in stent-graft 
technology might decrease stent-graft-related complications in patients with 
connective tissue disorders, although securing a device with radial force in a 
fragile aorta in the long-term will be challenging.

BACKGROUND: Retirement policies for surgeons differ worldwide. A range of normal 
human functional abilities decline as part of the ageing process. As life 
expectancy and their population increases, the performance ability of ageing 
surgeons is now a growing concern in relation to patient care. The aim was to 
explore the effects of ageing on surgeons' performance, and to identify current 
practical methods for transitioning surgeons out of practice at the appropriate 
time and age.
METHODS: A narrative review was performed in MEDLINE using the terms 'ageing' 
and 'surgeon'. Additional articles were hand-picked. Modified PRISMA guidelines 
informed the selection of articles for inclusion. Articles were included only if 
they explored age-related changes in brain biology and the effect of ageing on 
surgeons' performance.
RESULTS: The literature search yielded 1811 articles; of these, 36 articles were 
included in the final review. Wide variation in ability was observed across 
ageing individuals (both surgical and lay). Considerable variation in the 
effects of the surgeon's age on patient mortality and postoperative 
complications was noted. A lack of neuroimaging research exploring the ageing of 
surgeons' brains specifically, and lack of real markers available for measuring 
surgical performance, both hinder further investigation. Standard retirement 
policies in accordance with age-related surgical ability are lacking in most 
countries around the world.
CONCLUSION: Competence should be assessed at an individual level, focusing on 
functional ability over chronological age; this should inform retirement 
policies for surgeons.

INTRODUCTION: This study aimed at evaluating the overall survival (OS) gain 
associated with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-directed 
therapies in patients with metastatic breast cancer (mBC).
METHODS: A bibliographic search was conducted in PubMed and Cochrane databases. 
Only phase III randomized controlled trials (RCTs) including HER2-positive 
(HER2+) mBC patients were included in this review. OS was defined as time from 
randomization until the occurrence of death from any cause. Studies have been 
grouped according to the line of treatment, i.e., first-line or second-line or 
beyond.
RESULTS: Nineteen RCTs were eligible for inclusion, of which 12 assessed 
therapies targeting HER2+ mBC in the first-line setting. OS improved from 20.3 
months in the first RCT (standard chemotherapy; Slamon et al. (N Engl J Med 
344:783-92, 2001)) evaluating HER2-targeting therapies to 48 months in the study 
of Swain et al. (Lancet Oncol 14:461-71, 2013), with triple combination of 
pertuzumab, trastuzumab and docetaxel. Seven RCTs evaluated the OS of 
HER2-targeting therapies in the second-line setting and beyond. The OS in 
second-line setting improved from 15.3 months (capecitabine; Cameron et al. 
(Breast Cancer Res Treat 112:533-43, 2008)) to 30.7 months (trastuzumab 
emtansine; Verma et al. (N Engl J Med 367:1783-91, 2012)). In the third-line 
setting, the association of lapatinib and trastuzumab has demonstrated to 
improve OS to 4.5 months compared with lapatinib alone (14 months vs. 9.5 
months; Blackwell et al. (J Clin Oncol 30:2585-92, 2012)).
CONCLUSIONS: HER2-directed therapies had an undeniable beneficial impact on the 
OS of patients with HER2+ mBC. The triple combination of docetaxel, pertuzumab 
and trastuzumab is associated with a survival extent of more than 4.5 years, 
compared with a life expectancy of 1.5 years achieved 14 years ago.

How food valuation and decision-making influence the perception of food is of 
major interest to better understand food intake behavior and, by extension, body 
weight management. Our study investigated behavioral responses and 
spatio-temporal brain dynamics by means of visual evoked potentials (VEPs) in 
twenty-two normal-weight participants when viewing pairs of food photographs. 
Participants rated how much they liked each food item (valuation) and 
subsequently chose between the two alternative food images. Unsurprisingly, 
strongly liked foods were also chosen most often. Foods were rated faster as 
strongly liked than as mildly liked or disliked irrespective of whether they 
were subsequently chosen over an alternative. Moreover, strongly liked foods 
were subsequently also chosen faster than the less liked alternatives. Response 
times during valuation and choice were positively correlated, but only when 
foods were liked; the faster participants rated foods as strongly liked, the 
faster they were in choosing the food item over an alternative. VEP modulations 
by the level of liking attributed as well as the subsequent choice were found as 
early as 135-180ms after food image onset. Analyses of neural source activity 
patterns over this time interval revealed an interaction between liking and the 
subsequent choice within the insula, dorsal frontal and superior parietal 
regions. The neural responses to food viewing were found to be modulated by the 
attributed level of liking only when foods were chosen, not when they were 
dismissed for an alternative. Therein, the responses to disliked foods were 
generally greater than those to foods that were liked more. Moreover, the 
responses to disliked but chosen foods were greater than responses to disliked 
foods which were subsequently dismissed for an alternative offer. Our findings 
show that the spatio-temporal brain dynamics to food viewing are immediately 
influenced both by how much foods are liked and by choices taken on them. These 
valuation and choice processes are subserved by brain regions involved in 
salience and reward attribution as well as in decision-making processes, which 
are likely to influence prospective dietary choices in everyday life.

Spodoptera litura (F.) causes considerable economic damage to multiple 
agro-crops annually in many countries. In this study, the demography of S. 
litura reared on cabbage and taro was investigated using the age-stage, two-sex 
life table at 25±1°C, 60±10% relative humidity, and a photoperiod of 12: 12 
(L:D) h. Our results showed that the net reproductive rate, intrinsic rate, and 
finite rate of population increase on cabbage (1893.1 offspring, 0.2374 d(−1), 
and 1.2679 d(−1)) were all not significantly different from those on taro 
(1361.0 offspring, 0.2298 d(−1), and 1.2584 d(−1)). The net consumption rate on 
cabbage (439.1 cm2) was, however, three times higher than that on taro 
(141.7 cm2). According to the population parameters, both cabbage and taro are 
suitable host plants for S. litura. When both the population growth rate and the 
consumption rate were taken into consideration, the finite consumption rate on 
cabbage (ω=3.8054) was significantly higher than that on taro (ω=1.3184). In 
Taiwan, taro and cabbage are commonly planted in adjacent farm plots, with taro 
being grown from March to November and cabbage from October to April. Because of 
the overlapping growth periods of the two crops, S. litura can easily propagate 
throughout the year by switching between the adjacent crops during the overlap 
periods. Pest management strategies for controlling S. litura must be thoroughly 
reevaluated based on ecological characteristics, including its life table and 
consumption rate on its major host plants.

Lifelong smokers lose on average a decade of life vis-à-vis non-smokers. 
Globally, tobacco causes about 5-6 million deaths annually. One billion 
tobacco-related deaths are predicted for the 21st century, with about half 
occurring before the age of 70. In this paper, we consider a complete ban on the 
sale of cigarettes and find that such a ban, if effective, would be justified. 
As with many policy decisions, the argument for such a ban requires a weighing 
of the pros and cons and how they impact on different individuals, both current 
and future. The weightiest factor supporting a ban, we argue, is the often 
substantial well-being losses many individuals suffer because of smoking. These 
harms, moreover, disproportionally affect the disadvantaged. The potential gains 
in well-being and equality, we argue, outweigh the limits a ban places on 
individuals' freedom, its failure to respect some individuals' autonomous choice 
and the likelihood that it may, in individual cases, reduce well-being.

BACKGROUND: Numerous studies have compared patellar tendon (PT) and hamstring 
tendon (HS) anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstructions in the short to 
midterm, but fewer long-term results have been published.
HYPOTHESIS: There will be no difference in functional outcome between ACL 
reconstruction performed with PT and HS grafts, but PT grafts will have more 
donor site morbidity.
STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.
METHODS: Sixty-five patients undergoing ACL reconstruction were randomized to 
receive either a PT graft or a 4-strand HS graft. Early results were reported at 
4, 8, 12, 24, and 36 months. Forty-seven patients (22 of 31 PT and 25 of 34 HS) 
were reviewed at a mean of 15.3 years.
RESULTS: Four graft ruptures (1 PT, 3 HS) and 6 contralateral ACL injuries (4 
PT, 2 HS) occurred in the group that was reviewed. There was no statistically 
significant difference between the groups for any of the variables measured. 
There was a similar incidence of anterior knee pain and kneeling pain in both 
groups. The previously observed increased extension deficit in the PT group at 3 
years was not present at 15 years, and there was no significant between-group 
difference in knee laxity. A higher proportion of patients in the PT group were 
participating in sport on a weekly basis (73% PT, 48% HS; P = .05). There was no 
difference in the degree of osteoarthritis between the groups.
CONCLUSION: This randomized controlled trial showed that HS and PT ACL 
reconstructions have comparable results at an average 15-year follow-up. 
Contrary to the study hypothesis, some of the graft differences seen at earlier 
review were not present at 15 years, and patients with PT grafts were more 
active in sport participation. Overall, both graft types provided good long-term 
subjective and objective outcomes.

Understanding the population dynamics of megafauna that inhabited the mammoth 
steppe provides insights into the causes of extinctions during both the terminal 
Pleistocene and today. Our study area is Alaska's North Slope, a place where 
humans were rare when these extinctions occurred. After developing a statistical 
approach to remove the age artifacts caused by radiocarbon calibration from a 
large series of dated megafaunal bones, we compare the temporal patterns of bone 
abundance with climate records. Megafaunal abundance tracked ice age climate, 
peaking during transitions from cold to warm periods. These results suggest that 
a defining characteristic of the mammoth steppe was its temporal instability and 
imply that regional extinctions followed by population reestablishment from 
distant refugia were characteristic features of ice-age biogeography at high 
latitudes. It follows that long-distance dispersal was crucial for the long-term 
persistence of megafaunal species living in the Arctic. Such dispersal was only 
possible when their rapidly shifting range lands were geographically 
interconnected. The end of the last ice age was fatally unique because the 
geographic ranges of arctic megafauna became permanently fragmented after 
stable, interglacial climate engendered the spread of peatlands at the same time 
that rising sea level severed former dispersal routes.

Starting college is a major life transition. This study aims to characterize 
patterns of substance use across a variety of substances across the first year 
of college and identify associated factors. We used data from the first cohort 
(N = 2056, 1240 females) of the "Spit for Science" sample, a study of incoming 
freshmen at a large urban university. Latent transition analysis was applied to 
alcohol, tobacco, cannabis, and other illicit drug uses measured at the 
beginning of the fall semester and midway through the spring semester. 
Covariates across multiple domains - including personality, drinking motivations 
and expectancy, high school delinquency, peer deviance, stressful events, and 
symptoms of depression and anxiety - were included to predict the patterns of 
substance use and transitions between patterns across the first year. At both 
the fall and spring semesters, we identified three subgroups of participants 
with patterns of substance use characterized as: (1) use of all four substances; 
(2) alcohol, tobacco, and cannabis use; and (3) overall low substance use. 
Patterns of substance use were highly stable across the first year of college: 
most students maintained their class membership from fall to spring, with just 
7% of participants in the initial low substance users transitioning to spring 
alcohol, tobacco, and cannabis users. Most of the included covariates were 
predictive of the initial pattern of use, but covariates related to experiences 
across the first year of college were more predictive of the transition from the 
low to alcohol, tobacco, and cannabis user groups. Our results suggest that 
while there is an overall increase in alcohol use across all students, college 
students largely maintain their patterns of substance use across the first year. 
Risk factors experienced during the first year may be effective targets for 
preventing increases in substance use.

Life is unfair, and so are racing sports: some athletes can randomly benefit 
from alerting effects due to inconsistent starting procedures.

The Olympics are the world's largest sporting events, attracting billions of 
viewers worldwide. Important parts are racing sports, such as running, swimming 
and speed skating. In these sports, athletes compete against each other in 
different heats to determine who wins the gold, or who is granted a place in the 
final. Of course, the gold goes to whoever is the most talented and has trained 
the hardest. Or does it? Here we argue that subtle differences between athletes' 
starts can bias the competition, and demonstrate this in the results of speed 
skating at the 2010 Winter Olympics. This bias could be removed by simple 
alterations to current starting procedures. The proposed change would greatly 
improve racing sport fairness, which currently suffers from an injustice that 
disadvantages not only athletes, but entire nations rooting for them.

BACKGROUND/AIMS: The prognosis of spontaneous rupture of hepatocellular 
carcinoma (HCC) remains unclear. We investigated the prognosis of patients with 
ruptured HCC based on the treatments and prognostic factors associated with 
long-term survival.
METHODS: The prognoses of 64 consecutive patients treated for ruptured HCC from 
1986 to 2013 were analyzed according to their methods of treatment. The 
prognostic factors of 16 surgical patients were identified, and their overall 
survival (OS) and recurrence rates were compared to 1,157 surgical patients who 
underwent surgery for non-ruptured HCC. The surgical outcomes were also compared 
using a propensity score matching method.
RESULTS: Surgery was associated with a better OS. Curative resection was the 
only independent prognostic factor in surgical patients with ruptured HCC (p = 
0.040). Although the OS of surgical patients with non-ruptured HCC was found to 
be significantly better than that of the patients with ruptured HCC, no 
significant difference in OS was observed after propensity score matching.
CONCLUSION: A curative resection should be the objective of treatment, assuming 
the suitability of the patient's clinical condition. When the liver function 
reserve and tumor extension of patients with ruptured and non-ruptured HCC are 
similar, then their surgical outcomes may not be significantly different.

Wilson's disease is an inherited disorder of copper transport in the hepatocytes 
with a wide range of genotype and phenotype characteristics. Mutations in the 
ATP7B gene are responsible for the disease. Approximately, over 500 mutations in 
the ATP7B gene have been described to date. We report a method for the 
simultaneous detection of the ten most common ATP7B gene mutations in Greek 
patients. The method comprises 3 simple steps: (i) multiplex PCR amplification 
of fragments in the ATP7B gene flanking the mutations (ii) multiplex primer 
extension reaction of the unpurified amplification products using 
allele-specific primers and (iii) visual detection of the primer extension 
reaction products within minutes by means of dry-reagent multi-allele dipstick 
assay using anti-biotin conjugated gold nanoparticles. Optimization studies on 
the efficiency and specificity of the PEXT reaction were performed. The method 
was evaluated by genotyping 46 DNA samples of known genotype and 34 blind 
samples. The results were fully concordant with those obtained by reference 
methods. The method is simple, rapid, cost-effective and it does not require 
specialized instrumentation or highly qualified personnel.

OBJECTIVE: Analyze magnitude and trends in educational inequality in mortality 
and survival of women and men in countries of the Americas.
METHODS: Gap and gradient metrics were used to calculate inequality between 
countries in adult mortality, average age of death, life expectancy, and healthy 
life expectancy, according to educational level in men and women for 1990 and 
2010.
RESULTS: Between 1990 and 2010, the average number of years of education 
increased from 8 to 10 with no difference between sexes. Adult mortality (15-59 
years) did not change: 1.9 per 1 000 women and 3.7 per 1 000 men. The slope 
index of inequality (SII) increased from -1.0 to -2.0 per 1 000 women and from 
-1.2 to -4.4 per 1 000 men. Life expectancy increased from 75.6 to 78.7 years in 
women and from 68.9 to 72.4 in men; absolute inequality decreased from 7.8 to 
7.2 years in women and increased from 7.2 to 9.2 years in men. Healthy life 
expectancy increased from 63.7 to 65.9 years in women and from 59.5 to 62.5 
years in men; the SII declined from 6.9 to 5.8 years in women and increased from 
6.9 to 7.8 years in men.
CONCLUSIONS: In the countries of the Americas, men are at greater risk of dying, 
die earlier, and live fewer disease- and disability-free years than women; 
educational level is a determinant of mortality and survival in both sexes, and 
educational inequalities are more pronounced and increasing among men, and are 
disproportionately concentrated in the most socially disadvantaged populations.

Measuring the Sensitivity and Construct Validity of 6 Utility Instruments in 7 
Disease Areas.

BACKGROUND: Health services that affect quality of life (QoL) are increasingly 
evaluated using cost utility analyses (CUA). These commonly employ one of a 
small number of multiattribute utility instruments (MAUI) to assess the effects 
of the health service on utility. However, the MAUI differ significantly, and 
the choice of instrument may alter the outcome of an evaluation.
AIMS: The present article has 2 objectives: 1) to compare the results of 3 
measures of the sensitivity of 6 MAUI and the results of 6 tests of construct 
validity in 7 disease areas and 2) to rank the MAUI by each of the test results 
in each disease area and by an overall composite index constructed from the 
tests.
METHODS: Patients and the general public were administered a battery of 
instruments, which included the 6 MAUI, disease-specific QoL instruments (DSI), 
and 6 other comparator instruments. In each disease area, instrument sensitivity 
was measured 3 ways: by the unadjusted mean difference in utility between public 
and patient groups, by the value of the effect size, and by the correlation 
between MAUI and DSI scores. Content and convergent validity were tested by 
comparison of MAUI utilities and scores from the 6 comparator instruments. These 
included 2 measures of health state preferences, measures of subjective 
well-being and capabilities, and generic measures of physical and mental QoL 
derived from the SF-36.
RESULTS: The apparent sensitivity of instruments varied significantly with the 
measurement method and by disease area. Validation test results varied with the 
comparator instruments. Notwithstanding this variability, the 15D, AQoL-8D, and 
the SF-6D generally achieved better test results than the QWB and EQ-5D-5L.

The Chinese alligator Alligator sinensis is an endangered species endemic to 
China, up to date, little is known about the regulation of its growth and 
development. Insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) plays a vital role in 
regulating vertebrate growth and development. In this study, the full-length 
cDNA of IGF-I in Chinese alligator (caIGF-I) was obtained for the first time, it 
contains 890-bp nucleotides encoding a 153-amino acid precursor, the mature 
caIGF-I consists of 70 amino acids by cleaving the signal peptide and C-terminal 
extension (E domain). The caIGF-I contains all the features of IGF-I peptide 
with B, C, A, and D domains and the six conservative cysteine residues involved 
in the stable tertiary structure. Multiple alignment analysis showed that the 
amino acid sequence of caIGF-I shares high identity with American alligator 
Alligator mississippiensis (100%) and birds (95-97%). Phylogenetic tree analysis 
of the IGF-I amino acid sequences indicated that alligators cluster into the 
bird branch. Real-time quantitative PCR technique showed that caIGF-I is widely 
expressed in all the examined tissues with the highest expression level in 
liver, higher in pancreas and oviduct while lower in heart, spleen, lung, 
kidney, stomach, intestines, ovary and muscles. During hibernation, the caIGF-I 
expression level decreased significantly in liver, pancreas, oviduct and kidney, 
while did not significantly change in heart, spleen, lung, stomach, small 
intestine, ovary and muscles. The mRNA expression changes during the two periods 
implicate that caIGF-I might play an important role in the regulation of feeding 
and growth in the Chinese alligator.

BACKGROUND: Longer healthy life expectancy and the ageing of new generations 
result in rapid changes of life-styles and behaviors of the elderly.
OBJECTIVES: How far are trends to active ageing countervailing factors to 
processes of demographic ageing?
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Official statistics and survey data are analyzed.
RESULTS: Increased individualism particularly among healthy retired men and 
women result in more active attitudes to ageing processes. At least in affluent 
regions significant cohort changes in ageing are also observed among men and 
women aged 80 and older. These changes affect future medical treatments of
