Prolonging survival in good health is a fundamental societal goal. However, the 
leading determinants of disability-free survival in healthy older people have 
not been well established. Data from ASPREE, a bi-national placebo-controlled 
trial of aspirin with 4.7 years median follow-up, was analysed. At enrolment, 
participants were healthy and without prior cardiovascular events, dementia or 
persistent physical disability. Disability-free survival outcome was defined as 
absence of dementia, persistent disability or death. Selection of potential 
predictors from amongst 25 biomedical, psychosocial and lifestyle variables 
including recognized geriatric risk factors, utilizing a machine-learning 
approach. Separate models were developed for men and women. The selected 
predictors were evaluated in a multivariable Cox proportional hazards model and 
validated internally by bootstrapping. We included 19,114 Australian and US 
participants aged ≥65 years (median 74 years, IQR 71.6-77.7). Common predictors 
of a worse prognosis in both sexes included higher age, lower Modified 
Mini-Mental State Examination score, lower gait speed, lower grip strength and 
abnormal (low or elevated) body mass index. Additional risk factors for men 
included current smoking, and abnormal eGFR. In women, diabetes and depression 
were additional predictors. The biased-corrected areas under the receiver 
operating characteristic curves for the final prognostic models at 5 years were 
0.72 for men and 0.75 for women. Final models showed good calibration between 
the observed and predicted risks. We developed a prediction model in which age, 
cognitive function and gait speed were the strongest predictors of 
disability-free survival in healthy older people.Trial registration

This research assesses the effect of health expenditure and sanitation on life 
expectancy in Mediterranean countries. We also consider other drivers of life 
expectancy, such as CO2 emissions and economic growth. The study covers the 
period 2000-2018, and the recently developed method of moments quantile 
regression (MMQR) approach was utilised to assess these interconnections. This 
method is immune to outliers and creates an asymmetric interrelationship between 
variables. The outcomes from the MMQR unveiled that economic growth, health 
expenditure, and sanitation enhanced life expectancy in all quantiles 
(0.1-0.90). Furthermore, in all quantiles (0.1-0.90), the effect of CO2 
emissions on life expectancy was negative. Moreover, as a robustness check, the 
FMOLS, DOLS, and FE-OLS long-run estimators were applied, and the outcomes 
validated the MMQR outcomes. Based on the results generated, policymakers in 
these nations should implement effective environmental and public health 
measures that will pay off in the long run through improved health as a result 
of lower emissions of CO2, as well as increased economic expansion and 
productivity.

BACKGROUND: The Botswana Combination Prevention Project tested the impact of 
combination prevention (CP) on HIV incidence in a community-randomized trial. 
Each trial arm had ∼55,000 people, 26% HIV prevalence, and 72% baseline ART 
coverage. Results showed intensive testing and linkage campaigns, expanded 
antiretroviral treatment (ART), and voluntary male medical circumcision 
referrals increased coverage and decreased incidence over ∼29 months of 
follow-up. We projected lifetime clinical impact and cost-effectiveness of CP in 
this population.
SETTING: Rural and periurban communities in Botswana.
METHODS: We used the Cost-Effectiveness of Preventing AIDS Complications model 
to estimate lifetime health impact and cost of (1) earlier ART initiation and 
(2) averting an HIV infection, which we applied to incremental ART initiations 
and averted infections calculated from trial data. We determined the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio [US$/quality-adjusted life-years (QALY)] for CP vs. 
standard of care.
RESULTS: In CP, 1418 additional people with HIV initiated ART and an additional 
304 infections were averted. For each additional person started on ART, life 
expectancy increased 0.90 QALYs and care costs increased by $869. For each 
infection averted, life expectancy increased 2.43 QALYs with $9200 in care costs 
saved. With CP, an additional $1.7 million were spent on prevention and $1.2 
million on earlier treatment. These costs were mostly offset by decreased care 
costs from averted infections, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio of $79 per QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: Enhanced HIV testing, linkage, and early ART initiation improve 
life expectancy, reduce transmission, and can be cost-effective or cost-saving 
in settings like Botswana.

IMPORTANCE: Breast cancer (BC) diagnosis and treatment expose patients to a 
5-fold higher risk of depression compared with the general population, with an 
estimated prevalence of 10% to 25%. A depressive episode in patients with BC has 
implications for the tolerance of and adherence to treatment, impairing quality 
of life and reducing life expectancy.
OBJECTIVE: To identify and characterize distinct longitudinal patterns of 
depressive symptoms in patients with BC from diagnosis to 3 years after 
treatment.
DESIGN, SETTINGS, AND PARTICIPANTS: The CANTO-DEePRESS (Deeper in the 
Understanding and Prevention of Depression in Breast Cancer Patients) cohort 
study included women in the French multicenter CANTO (CANcer TOxicities) cohort 
study (conducted between March 20, 2012 and December 11, 2018), who were 18 
years or older with invasive stage I to III BC and no previous BC treatment. The 
study aimed to characterize toxicities over a 5-year period following stage I to 
III primary BC treatment. Assessments of depressive symptoms were performed on a 
subset of patients with available data at diagnosis and at least 2 other time 
points. All data were extracted from the CANTO database on October 1, 2020.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was the level of depressive 
symptoms at each assessment time point measured with the Hospital Anxiety and 
Depression Scale and depression subscale at BC diagnosis and at 3 to 6, 12, and 
36 months after the end of treatment. The group-based trajectory modeling was 
used to identify trajectory groups, and multinomial logistic regression models 
were used to characterize the following factors associated with trajectory group 
affiliation: demographic, socioeconomic, clinical, lifestyle, and 
quality-of-life data.
RESULTS: A total of 4803 women (mean [SD] age, 56.2 [11.2] years; 2441 patients 
[50.8%] with stage I BC) were included in the study. Six trajectory groups that 
described the heterogeneity in the expression of depressive symptoms were 
identified: noncases with no expression of symptoms (n = 2634 [54.8%]), 
intermediate worsening (1076 [22.4%]), intermediate improvement (480 [10.0%]), 
remission (261 [5.4%]), delayed occurrence (200 [4.2%]), and stable depression 
(152 [3.2%]). HADS-D scores at diagnosis were consistently associated with the 5 
depressive trajectory group affiliations, with an estimated higher probability 
per point increase of experiencing subthreshold or clinically significant 
depressive symptoms between diagnosis and the 3 years after the end of BC 
treatment. The higher probabilities ranged from 1.49 (95% CI, 1.43-1.54) for the 
intermediate worsening group to 10.53 (95% CI, 8.84-12.55) for the stable 
depression group. Trajectory groups with depressive symptoms differed from the 
noncases group without symptoms by demographic and clinical factors, such as 
having dependent children, lower household income, cancer stage, family history 
of BC, previous psychiatric hospitalizations, obesity, smoking status, higher 
levels of fatigue, and depression at diagnosis.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study, nearly a third of patients with 
BC experienced temporary or lasting significant depressive symptoms during and 
after treatment. Improving early identification of women at risk of developing 
long-term or delayed depression is therefore critical to increase quality of 
life and overall survival. Subjected to validation, this study is an important 
first step toward personalized care of patients with BC at risk of depression.

CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: Sandhoff disease comprises a phenotypic continuum 
encompassing acute infantile, subacute juvenile, and late-onset disease. 
Although classification into these phenotypes is somewhat arbitrary, it is 
helpful in understanding the variation observed in the timing of disease onset, 
presenting manifestations, rate of progression, and life span. Acute infantile 
Sandhoff disease (onset age <6 months). Infants are generally normal at birth 
followed by progressive weakness and slowing of developmental progress, then 
developmental regression and severe neurologic impairment. Seizures are common. 
Death usually occurs between ages two and three years. Subacute juvenile 
Sandhoff disease (onset age 2-5 years). After attaining normal developmental 
milestones, developmental progress slows, followed by developmental regression 
and neurologic impairment (abnormal gait, dysarthria, and cognitive decline). 
Death (usually from aspiration) typically occurs in the early to late teens. 
Late-onset Sandhoff disease (onset older teen years or young adulthood). Nearly 
normal psychomotor development is followed by a range of neurologic findings 
(e.g., weakness, spasticity, dysarthria, and deficits in cerebellar function) 
and psychiatric findings (e.g., deficits in executive function and memory). Life 
expectancy is not necessarily decreased.
DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: In a proband, the diagnosis of Sandhoff disease is 
established by: (1) enzymatic testing that identifies abnormally low activity of 
the enzymes beta-hexosaminidase A (HEX A) and beta-hexosaminidase B (HEX B) 
combined with an increased contribution from HEX A; and (2) identification 
biallelic pathogenic variants in HEXB on molecular testing.
MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: Treatment is symptomatic. Supportive 
care in acute infantile Sandhoff disease focuses on providing adequate nutrition 
and hydration, managing infectious disease, protecting the airway to reduce 
aspiration risk, controlling seizures, supporting motor development, and 
preventing deformities. Supportive care in subacute juvenile and late-onset 
Sandhoff disease focuses on maximizing motor function and speech and language as 
well as providing aids for activities of daily living and communication. 
Surveillance: Periodic multidisciplinary evaluations to monitor existing disease 
manifestations and identify new manifestations requiring modification of 
supportive care. Agents/circumstances to avoid: In acute infantile Sandhoff 
disease, avoid positioning that increases aspiration risk during feedings; and 
seizure medication dosages that result in excessive sedation. In subacute 
juvenile Sandhoff disease, avoid situations that increase the likelihood of 
contractures or pressure sores, such as extended periods of immobility; and 
circumstances that increase the risk of falling. In late-onset Sandhoff disease, 
avoid situations that increase the risk of falling (e.g., walking on uneven or 
unstable surfaces); and psychiatric medications that have been associated with 
worsening disease in late-onset Tay-Sachs disease, a similar disorder (e.g., 
haloperidol, risperidone, chlorpromazine).
GENETIC COUNSELING: Sandhoff disease is inherited in an autosomal recessive 
manner. If both parents are known to be heterozygous for a HEXB pathogenic 
variant, each sib of an affected individual has at conception a 25% chance of 
being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance 
of inheriting neither of the familial pathogenic variants. Once the HEXB 
pathogenic variants have been identified in an affected family member, carrier 
testing for at-risk relatives and prenatal/preimplantation genetic testing are 
possible.

Combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) increased the life expectancy of people 
living with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) (PLHIV) and remarkably reduced 
the morbidity and mortality associated with HIV infection. Consequently, PLHIV 
are experiencing non-acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) associated 
comorbid conditions including diabetes, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and 
cardiovascular disease. The aim of this study is to determine the frequency of 
non-AIDS associated comorbid conditions among a cohort of PLHIV on cART in 
Lebanon.Data were collected between November 2018 and December 2019 from 105 
voluntary participants. A standardized questionnaire was used to collect 
demographic and behavioral data including lifestyle, smoking, physical activity, 
substance use and abuse in addition to co-infections and family history of 
non-communicable diseases. Moreover, data on occurrence and treatment of 
cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, lipid and metabolic disorders as 
well as mental health were collected. Blood samples were used to assess the 
levels of fasting blood sugar (FBS), glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1C), 
triglycerides (TG), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein, 
total cholesterol, and serum creatinine.Hypertension (29.5%) and hyperlipidemia 
(29.5%) followed by diabetes (23.7%) and cardiovascular disease (9.7%) were 
mainly reported among study participants. Higher rate of comorbid conditions was 
observed among participants >40 years of age than those ≤40 years with both 
hypertension and hyperlipidemia most commonly reported. Older age (odds ratio 
[OR] 7.6; 95% CI: 1.83-31.98; P = .005) is associated with higher odds of having 
hyperlipidemia. Moreover, participants on cART for ≥10 years are 5 times more 
likely to have hyperlipidemia (OR 5; 95% CI: 1.08-22.73; P = .039). Our results 
also showed that study participants did not experience anxiety, depression or 
somatic symptoms and that there was no association between these mental 
disorders and older age or comorbidities.Our results provide important 
information on HIV trends and associated comorbidities in Lebanon and can be 
used to improve the management of non-communicable diseases among PLHIV.

OBJECTIVE: Improving the quality of life (QoL) of people living with HIV (PLWH) 
has been proposed as a new priority in HIV care. The objective of this 
cross-sectional, qualitative study was to explore the perspectives of PLWH in 
Greece regarding their QoL.
DESIGN: Twenty-four semi-structured interviews were conducted with PLWH 
receiving care across six HIV clinics in Greece. The thematic analysis of the 
transcribed interviews resulted in four themes and eleven subthemes.
RESULTS: First, fear of repercussions (e.g., stigmatization) makes PLWH 
reluctant to disclose their diagnosis in public settings or disclose accounting 
for factors like the confidant's discretion. Second, participants are challenged 
by HIV's unique biopsychosocial facets (e.g., uncertainty about symptoms) and 
fear for the future (e.g., a confidant revealing their HIV status without 
consent). Third, support received by specialist services is satisfactory in 
contrast to non-HIV specialist services, where significant improvements are 
needed to reduce stigmatization. Finally, the experiences of PLWH include 
contrasting elements of post-traumatic growth and an inability to accept their 
seropositivity (e.g., avoiding social interactions).
CONCLUSIONS: Empowering PLWH in these QoL areas is greatly needed. Increasing 
the life expectancy of PLWH is only the initial step; their QoL needs to be 
secured as the next priority in HIV care.

Estimating the range of incremental cost-effectiveness thresholds for healthcare 
based on willingness to pay and GDP per capita: A systematic review.

Japan.

BACKGROUND: Decision-making in healthcare policy involves assessing both costs 
and benefits. In determining the cost-effectiveness (CE) threshold, willingness 
to pay (WTP) per quality-adjusted life year (QALY), GDP per capita, and other 
factors are important. However, the relationship between WTP/QALY or GDP per 
capita and the CE threshold is unclear. It is important to clarify the 
relationship between WTP/QALY and GDP to provide a clear basis for setting the 
CE threshold.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to compare WTP/QALY and GDP per capita, 
and to develop a new CE threshold range based on WTP using GDP per capita. The 
relationship between WTP/QALY and healthy life expectancy (HALE) was also 
investigated.
METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE and Web of Science from 1980/01/01 to 
2020/12/31 using the following selection criteria (latest search: Dec 2021):1, 
studies that estimated WTP/QALY; 2, the general population was surveyed; 3, the 
article was in English. From the collected articles, we obtained average values 
of WTP/QALY for various countries and compared WTP/QALY with GDP per capita. The 
correlation between WTP/QALY and HALE was also examined.
RESULTS: We identified 20 papers from 17 countries. Comparison of mean WTP/QALY 
values with GDP per capita showed that most WTP/QALY values were in the range of 
0.5-1.5 times GDP per capita, though the median values were less than 0.5 times. 
Comparison of WTP/QALY with HALE showed a statistically significant positive 
correlation when Taiwan was excluded as an outlier.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest a CE threshold range of 0.5-1.5 times GDP per 
capita is appropriate but lower than the WHO-recommended range of 1-3 times. The 
correlation between WTP/QALY and HALE suggests that investment in healthcare is 
reflected in an increased healthy life expectancy. Since WTP is based on 
consumer preferences, this range could be used to set a generally acceptable 
criterion.

Recent scientific evidence has shown the importance of diet and lifestyle habits 
for the proper functioning of the human body. A balanced and healthy diet, 
physical activity, and psychological well-being have a direct beneficial effect 
on health and can have a crucial role in the development and prognosis of 
certain diseases. The Southern European Atlantic diet, also named the Atlantic 
diet, is a unique dietary pattern that occurs in regions that present higher 
life expectancy, suggesting that this specific dietary pattern is associated 
with positive health effects. In fact, it is enriched with nutrients of high 
biological value, which, together with its cooking methods, physical activity 
promotion, reduction in carbon footprint, and promoting of family meals, promote 
these positive effects on health. The latest scientific advances in the field of 
nutri-epigenetics have revealed that epigenetic markers associated with food or 
nutrients and environmental factors modulate gene expression and, therefore, are 
involved with both health and disease. Thus, in this review, we evaluated the 
main aspects that define the Southern European Atlantic diet and the potential 
epigenetic changes associated with them based on recent studies regarding the 
main components of these dietary patterns. In conclusion, based on the 
information existing in the literature, we postulate that the Southern European 
Atlantic diet could promote healthy aging by means of epigenetic mechanisms. 
This review highlights the necessity of performing longitudinal studies to 
demonstrate this proposal.

Heritability is a fundamental concept in genetic studies, measuring the genetic 
contribution to complex traits and bringing insights about disease mechanisms. 
The advance of high-throughput technologies has provided many resources for 
heritability estimation. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) score regression (LDSC) 
estimates both heritability and confounding biases, such as cryptic relatedness 
and population stratification, among single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) by 
using only summary statistics released from genome-wide association studies. 
However, only partial information in the LD matrix is utilized in LDSC, leading 
to loss in precision. In this study, we propose LD eigenvalue regression (LDER), 
an extension of LDSC, by making full use of the LD information. Compared to 
state-of-the-art heritability estimating methods, LDER provides more accurate 
estimates of SNP heritability and better distinguishes the inflation caused by 
polygenicity and confounding effects. We demonstrate the advantages of LDER both 
theoretically and with extensive simulations. We applied LDER to 814 complex 
traits from UK Biobank, and LDER identified 363 significantly heritable 
phenotypes, among which 97 were not identified by LDSC.

Owing to numerous biological activities of different parts of Moringa oleifera 
Lam., various studies have been carried out to isolate and explore the 
activities of its various bioactive compounds including polysaccharides. 
Polysaccharides of M. oleifera have been reported to possess a variety of 
biofunctionalities including antihyperlipidemic, anti-diabetic, 
immunomodulatory, antihypertensive and gastrointestinal protection. In addition 
to bioactive polysaccharides, the gum exudated by stem of this plant is of 
commercial importance with wide range of applications in pharmaceutical 
industries. Various extraction and purification methods as well as combination 
of methods have been used to isolate and purify moringa polysaccharides. Studies 
suggest that extraction methods influence the structure of polysaccharides and 
thus their biological activity. This review summarizes all the available 
literature to provide updated information related to extraction, purification, 
modification, structural characterization, bioactivities and potential 
applications of moringa polysaccharides. This review will provide novel insights 
for future research and applications of moringa polysaccharides.

Tilapia lake virus disease (TiLVD) caused by Tilapia lake virus (TiLV) is a 
great threat to the global tilapia culture industry. Effective prevention and 
control strategies have not been developed due to limited basic research of 
pathogenesis of TiLVD. Cell lines from different fish species have been found to 
be permissive to TiLV infection. In the current study, we comprehensively 
analyzed TiLV susceptibilities to 10 permanent growing fish cell lines. We found 
that the highest viral titers were generated onto TiB cells originated from the 
tilapia species Oreochromis mossambicus, MSF from the largemouth bass 
Micropterus salmoides, CAMK from the hybrid snakehead Channa argus × Channa 
maculata and SS derived from the perch species Siniperca chuatsi. Viral copy 
numbers from these four cell lines ranged from 4 × 107 copies/μL to 4.6 × 108 
copies/μL. Confocal immunofluorescent microscopy also indicated that all 10 cell 
lines can support varying degrees of viral infection and replication. TiLV 
particles can be observed in cells from randomly selected three fish species 
using electron microscope. This study will assist in research and development of 
prevention and control of TiLVD.

Life expectancy has increased substantially over the last 150 years. Yet this 
means that now most people also spend a greater length of time suffering from 
various age-associated diseases. As such, delaying age-related functional 
decline and extending healthspan, the period of active older years free from 
disease and disability, is an overarching objective of current aging research. 
Geroprotectors, compounds that target pathways that causally influence aging, 
are increasingly recognized as a means to extend healthspan in the aging 
population. Meanwhile, FOXO3 has emerged as a geroprotective gene intricately 
involved in aging and healthspan. FOXO3 genetic variants are linked to human 
longevity, reduced disease risks, and even self-reported health. Therefore, 
identification of FOXO3-activating compounds represents one of the most direct 
candidate approaches to extending healthspan in aging humans. In this work, we 
review compounds that activate FOXO3, or influence healthspan or lifespan in a 
FOXO3-dependent manner. These compounds can be classified as pharmaceuticals, 
including PI3K/AKT inhibitors and AMPK activators, antidepressants and 
antipsychotics, muscle relaxants, and HDAC inhibitors, or as nutraceuticals, 
including primary metabolites involved in cell growth and sustenance, and 
secondary metabolites including extracts, polyphenols, terpenoids, and other 
purified natural compounds. The compounds documented here provide a basis and 
resource for further research and development, with the ultimate goal of 
promoting healthy longevity in humans.

BACKGROUND: Concerns have grown that post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 may affect 
significant numbers of survivors. However, the analyses used to guide 
policy-making for Australia's national and state re-opening plans have not 
incorporated non-acute illness in their modelling. We, therefore, develop a 
model by which to estimate the potential acute and post-acute COVID-19 burden 
using disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) associated with the re-opening of 
Australian borders and the easing of other public health measures, with 
particular attention to longer-term, post-acute consequences and the potential 
impact of permanent functional impairment following COVID-19.
METHODS: A model was developed based on the European Burden of Disease Network 
protocol guideline and consensus model to estimate the burden of COVID-19 using 
DALYs. Data inputs were based on publicly available sources. COVID-19 infection 
and different scenarios were drawn from the Doherty Institute's modelling report 
to estimate the likely DALY losses under the Australian national re-opening 
plan. Long COVID prevalence, post-intensive care syndrome (PICS) and potential 
permanent functional impairment incidences were drawn from the literature. DALYs 
were calculated for the following health states: the symptomatic phase, Long 
COVID, PICS and potential permanent functional impairment (e.g., diabetes, 
Parkinson's disease, dementia, anxiety disorders, ischemic stroke). Uncertainty 
and sensitivity analysis were performed to examine the robustness of the 
results.
RESULTS: Mortality was responsible for 72-74% of the total base case COVID-19 
burden. Long COVID and post-intensive care syndrome accounted for at least 19 
and 3% of the total base case DALYs respectively. When included in the analysis, 
potential permanent impairment could contribute to 51-55% of total DALYs lost.
CONCLUSIONS: The impact of Long COVID and potential long-term post-COVID 
disabilities could contribute substantially to the COVID-19 burden in 
Australia's post-vaccination setting. As vaccination coverage increases, the 
share of COVID-19 burden driven by longer-term morbidity rises relative to 
mortality. As Australia re-opens, better estimates of the COVID-19 burden can 
assist with decision-making on pandemic control measures and planning for the 
healthcare needs of COVID-19 survivors. Our estimates highlight the importance 
of valuing the morbidity of post-COVID-19 sequelae, above and beyond simple 
mortality and case statistics.

BACKGROUND: Due to population aging, it is essential to examine to what extent 
rises in life expectancy (LE) consist of healthy or unhealthy years. Most health 
expectancy studies have been based on single health measures and have shown 
divergent trends. We used a multi-domain indicator, complex health problems 
(CHP), indicative of the need for integrated medical and social care, to 
investigate how LE with and without CHP developed in Sweden between 1992 and 
2011. We also addressed whether individuals with CHP more commonly lived in the 
community in 2011 compared to earlier years.
METHODS: CHP were defined as having severe problems in at least two of three 
health domains related to the need for medical and/or social care: 
symptoms/diseases, cognition/communication, and mobility. The Swedish Panel 
Study of Living Conditions of the Oldest Old (SWEOLD), a nationally 
representative survey of the Swedish population aged ≥ 77 years with waves in 
1992, 2002 and 2011 (n≈2000), was used to estimate the prevalence of CHP. Age- 
and gender-specific death rates were obtained from the Human Mortality Database. 
The Sullivan method was deployed to calculate the remaining life expectancy with 
and without CHP. The estimates were decomposed to calculate the contribution of 
changes from morbidity and mortality to the overall trends in LE without CHP.
RESULTS: Between 1992 and 2011, both total LE (+ 1.69 years [95% CI 1.56;1.83] 
and LE without CHP (+ 0.84 years [-0,87;2.55]) at age 77 increased for men, 
whereas LE at age 77 increased for women (+ 1.33 [1.21;1.47]) but not LE without 
CHP (-0.06 years [-1.39;1.26]). When decomposing the trend, we found that the 
increase in LE with CHP was mainly driven by an increase in the prevalence of 
CHP. Among individuals with CHP the proportion residing in care homes was lower 
in 2011 (37%) compared to 2002 (58%) and 1992 (53%).
CONCLUSIONS: The findings, that an increasing number of older people are 
expected to live more years with CHP, and increasingly live in the community, 
point towards a challenge for individuals and families, as well as for society 
in financing and organizing coordinated and coherent medical and social 
services.

BACKGROUND: Namibia is a large sparsely populated country with a high prevalence 
of HIV. People living with HIV who reside in remote areas often travel long 
distances through tough desert terrain to access HIV care and treatment. To 
address this barrier, community-based antiretroviral therapy (C-BART) sites were 
established in Okongo (2007-2008) and Eenhana districts (2016) of northern 
Namibia with the goal of bringing HIV and other health services closer patients'
