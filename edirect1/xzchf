BACKGROUND: The decision to implant a cardiac device in a person with 
Alzheimer's disease or related dementia requires considering the possible 
trade-offs of quality of life (QOL) and quantity of life. This study measured 
the decision-making experience of patients with and without cognitive impairment 
(CI) who received a cardiac device and their family members who were involved in 
the decision.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Semi-structured interviews and questionnaires were 
administered with 15 patient-family member dyads. Interviews revealed few 
conversations between physicians, patients and family members about the 
patient's cognitive status or about the benefits, risks, and long-term 
implications of the device for someone with CI. Participants largely stated that 
the decision to get the device was based on the patient's functional status at 
the time of the implant, and not on expectations about future functioning. 
Patients with CI had more regret, measured with the Decision Regret Scale (DRS), 
(p=0.037) and family members of patients without CI reported more decisional 
conflict, measured with the Decisional Conflict Scale (p=0.057).
CONCLUSIONS: Although CI impacts life expectancy and QOL, cognitive status was 
largely not discussed prior to device implant. Few differences were found 
between the experiences of dyads that included patients with or without CI.

AIMS: As the life expectancy of persons with spina bifida increases, sexual life 
in adulthood presents a considerable challenge for this population. The purpose 
of this study was to evaluate the sexual function of young women with spina 
bifida and its impact on their quality of life (QOL).
METHODS: To assess sexual function and QOL by using self-administered 
questionnaires (Female Sexual Function Index [FSFI] and 36-Item Short Form 
Health Survey) in young women with spina bifida, we collected data from 44 young 
women with spina bifida between June 2013 and October 2013 at the spina bifida 
clinic of our hospital.
RESULTS: Sexual dysfunction was noted in 55.5% of women with spina bifida who 
had sexual activity in the previous month. In sexually active women, the 
diagnosis, ventriculoperitoneal shunt in situ, mobility, and clean intermittent 
catheterization did not show a significant difference between each subdomain 
(desire, arousal, lubrication, orgasm, satisfaction, and pain) and the total 
FSFI score. However, women who did not have urinary incontinence experienced 
better sexual function in terms of lubrication and pain scores (P = 0.033 and 
P = 0.026, respectively). Both the physical and mental composites of QOL were 
positively weakly correlated with the arousal score of FSFI (r = 0.455, 
P = 0.044 and r = 0.507, P = 0.023, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: More than half of sexually active women with spina bifida 
experience sexual dysfunction. Therefore, health-care providers should pay 
attention to the symptoms and their management.

INTRODUCTION: Changes in the parameters of the power-time relationship (critical 
power (CP) and W') during endurance exercise would have important implications 
for performance. We tested the hypotheses that CP and W', estimated using the 
end-test power (EP) and the work done above EP (WEP), respectively, during a the 
3-min all-out test (3MT), can be reliably determined, and would be lower, after 
completing 2 h of heavy-intensity exercise.
METHODS: In study 1, six cyclists completed a 3MT immediately after 2 h of 
heavy-intensity exercise on two occasions to establish the reliability of EP and 
WEP. In study 2, nine cyclists completed a control 3MT, and a fatigued 3MT and 
constant power output tests to 30 min or the limit of tolerance (Tlim) below and 
above F-EP after 2 h of heavy-intensity exercise.
RESULTS: In study 1, EP (273 ± 52 vs 276 ± 58 W) and WEP (12.4 ± 4.3 vs 12.8 ± 
4.3 kJ) after 2 h of heavy-intensity exercise were not different (P > 0.05) and 
were highly correlated (r = 0.99; P < 0.001). In study 2, both EP (F-EP: 282 ± 
52 vs C-EP: 306 ± 56 W; P < 0.01) and WEP (F-WEP: 14.7 ± 4.9 vs C-WEP: 18.3 ± 
4.1 kJ; P < 0.05) were lower after 2-h heavy-intensity exercise. However, 
maximum O2 uptake was not achieved during exercise >F-EP and Tlim was shorter 
than 30 min during exercise <F-EP (18.2 ± 10.7 min).
CONCLUSIONS: The EP and WEP may be reliably determined after 2-h heavy-intensity 
exercise. The 8% and 20% reductions in EP and WEP, respectively, have important 
implications for performance during endurance exercise. The physiological 
characterization of EP (and, by extension, CP) may differ in a fatigued compared 
with a rested state.

PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to review our experience with palliative 
ostomy surgery in patients with bowel obstruction and advanced stage colorectal 
cancer.
DESIGN: A descriptive, retrospective review of data from a prospectively 
collected clinical database.
SUBJECTS AND SETTING: The sample comprised 86 patients (55 male) who underwent 
palliative surgery between October 1998 and January 2009.
METHODS: All patients undergoing palliative stoma formation without resection 
for colorectal carcinoma were identified from a prospectively compiled 
colorectal cancer database. Patients having colorectal stent placement and 
bypass surgery were excluded from analysis.
RESULTS: The median age at surgery was 71 years (interquartile range, 65-79 
years). The median survival following ostomy creation was 103 days 
(interquartile range, 19-263 days). Sixty-nine percent of participants (n = 59) 
survived 30 days and 18% (n=16) survived 12 months.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirm that patients undergoing palliative stoma 
formation have limited life expectancy. Nevertheless, these findings are 
encouraging when compared to the anticipated outcomes of untreated bowel 
obstruction.

Telomere maintenance protects the cell against genome instability and 
senescence. Accelerated telomere attrition is a characteristic of premature 
aging syndromes including Dyskeratosis congenita (DC). Mutations in hRTEL1 are 
associated with a severe form of DC called Hoyeraal-Hreidarsson syndrome (HHS). 
HHS patients carry short telomeres and HHS cells display telomere damage. Here 
we investigated how hRTEL1 contributes to telomere maintenance in human primary 
as well as tumor cells. Transient depletion of hRTEL1 resulted in rapid telomere 
shortening only in the context of telomerase-positive cells with very long 
telomeres and high levels of telomerase. The effect of hRTEL1 on telomere length 
is telomerase dependent without impacting telomerase biogenesis or targeting of 
the enzyme to telomeres. Instead, RTEL1 depletion led to a decrease in both 
G-overhang content and POT1 association with telomeres with limited telomere 
uncapping. Strikingly, overexpression of POT1 restored telomere length but not 
the overhang, demonstrating that G-overhang loss is the primary defect caused by 
RTEL1 depletion. We propose that hRTEL1 contributes to the maintenance of long 
telomeres by preserving long G-overhangs, thereby facilitating POT1 binding and 
elongation by telomerase.

[Effect of low -level laser therapy and exercise in reducing the symptoms of 
disease in patients with osteoarthritis of the knee].

[Article in Polish]

Ciosek Ż, Rotter I.

INTRODUCTION: Osteoarthritis is the most common disease of the joints 
contributing to the failure of movement. The disease mostly affects the older 
part of the population, and is associated with suffering and reduced quality of 
life. Knee osteoarthritis contributes to joint dysfunction of varying severity. 
These are common causes of chronic ailments limiting physical activity, which 
may even complicate the performance of activities of daily living. Low-level 
laser therapy is thought to have an analgesic effect, as well as a biomodulatory 
effect on the microcirculation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the 
effectiveness of low- -level laser therapy on pain relief and functional 
improvement in patients with osteoarthritis of the knee. The effects of laser 
therapy alone and in combination with exercise were compared.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: 40 patients of mean age 65 years with knee osteoarthritis 
of both sexes were divided into two groups. Laser alone was used in group I (n = 
20) and laser combined with kinesistherapy was used in group II (n = 20). All 
patients received the same dose of laser radiation, which was 3.0 J/cm², 10 Hz, 
400 mW. In both groups a series of 10 treatments was performed daily. VAS, 
ranges of motion in the knee joint, and the strength of the quadriceps and 
biceps femoris muscles were used as the criteria of pain assessment in both 
groups. All measurements were taken before and after treatment.
RESULTS: Significant pain reduction: I (p = 0.00009, R = 0.68); II (p = 0.00002, 
R = 0.86), increased range of flexion in the knee: I (p = 0.000001, R = 0.90); 
II (p = 0.00002, R = 0.85), increased range of extension in the knee: I (p = 
0.042, R = 0.87); II (p = 0.0004, R = 0.9) and increased strength of the 
quadriceps femoris muscle: I (p = 0.03, R = 0.77); II (p = 0.0002, R = 0.9) and 
the biceps femoris muscle: I (p = 0.04, R = 0.80); II (p = 0.0007, R = 0.91) 
were found in both groups after treatment. With the exception of flexion of the 
knee (p = 0.027; r = 0.17), there were no statistically significant differences 
in other analysed parameters between the use of laser alone and laser therapy 
combined with exercise.
CONCLUSION: The use of laser in knee osteoarthritis reduces pain and improves 
the functional status of the patient. Laser therapy combined with kinesistherapy 
produces better therapeutic effects, and effectively improves the functional 
status of knee osteoarthritis. Exercise therapy applied in a series of 10 
treatments is too short to significantly improve the functional status of the 
patient.

PURPOSE: Cardiovascular diseases are a major cause for the markedly reduced life 
expectancy in people with severe mental illness (SMI). Hospital departments 
should provide adequate prevention of cardiometabolic risk by optimizing 
prevention and treatment. Characteristics of cardiometabolic risk factors in 
inpatients are still not well known. We aimed to describe the status of 
cardiometabolic risk factors in inpatients with SMI and identify associations 
with psychiatric status and treatment.
METHODS: A cross sectional descriptive study of inpatients with SMI from long 
term psychosis treatment wards in South Eastern Norway was performed. 
Comprehensive assessments of cardiometabolic risk factors, physical activity, 
lifestyle habits, symptoms, life satisfaction and treatment were made. 
Associations and potential prognostic factors were analyzed using linear and 
logistic regressions.
RESULTS: A total of 83 patients were included in the study, but many individual 
datasets were incomplete. Over half of the subjects had unhealthy eating habits. 
Obesity (class 1-3) was found in 44%, 23% had elevated fasting triglycerides, 
26% had elevated blood pressure and 78% smoked daily. Low levels of physical 
activity were significantly associated with higher levels of depression 
(p = .007). A nominal increase in cardiometabolic risk factors was found for 
olanzapine and clozapine users.
CONCLUSION: Inpatients in long term psychosis treatment wards have alarmingly 
high cardiometabolic risk. Level of physical activity was associated with both 
psychiatric and somatic health. Focus on lifestyle and somatic health should be 
an integral part of the treatment for hospitalized SMI patients.

Our older physicians, an increasing number of those in practice, constitute a 
valuable human resource in the medical profession. Professional satisfaction, 
increasing life expectancy, concerns regarding financial security, and 
reluctance to retire are among the many reasons a physician might choose to 
extend practice into later adulthood. Despite the benefits of experience and 
expertise acquired by older physicians, cognitive changes associated with normal 
or pathological aging have been shown to have a significant negative effect on 
physician performance. Age-based cognitive assessment of physicians has been 
adopted in some countries and by some U.S. healthcare institutions for patient 
protection and improvement of physician quality of life, but there is no general 
guideline for the assessment and assistance of cognitively impaired late career 
physicians in the United States. Self-reports and reports from peers are an 
inadequate safeguard, leaving impaired physicians and their patients at risk. In 
this discussion, we will describe cognitive aging, the effects of cognitive 
aging on physician performance, some current monitoring systems, and 
recommendations for identifying and assisting physicians found to be impaired.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Global warming has attracted worldwide attention. 
Numerous studies have indicated that stroke is associated with temperature; 
however, few studies are available on the projections of the burden of stroke 
attributable to future climate change. We aimed to investigate the future trends 
of stroke years of life lost (YLL) associated with global warming.
METHODS: We collected death records to examine YLL in Tianjin, China, from 2006 
to 2011. We fitted a standard time-series Poisson regression model after 
controlling for trends, day of the week, relative humidity, and air pollution. 
We estimated temperature-YLL associations with a distributed lag nonlinear 
model. These models were then applied to the local climate projections to 
estimate temperature-related YLL in the 2050s and 2070s. We projected 
temperature-related YLL from stroke in Tianjin under 19 global-scale climate 
models and 3 different greenhouse gas emission scenarios.
RESULTS: The results showed a slight decrease in YLL with percent decreases of 
0.85%, 0.97%, and 1.02% in the 2050s and 0.94%, 1.02%, and 0.91% in the 2070s 
for the 3 scenarios, respectively. The increases in heat-related annual YLL and 
the decreases in cold-related YLL under the high emission scenario were the 
strongest. The monthly analysis showed that the most significant increase 
occurred in the summer months, particularly in August, with percent changes 
>150% in the 2050s and up to 300% in the 2070s.
CONCLUSIONS: Future changes in climate are likely to lead to an increase in 
heat-related YLL, and this increase will not be offset by adaptation under both 
medium emission and high emission scenarios. Health protections from hot weather 
will become increasingly necessary, and measures to reduce cold effects will 
also remain important.

The neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) has a pivotal role in albumin and IgG 
homeostasis. Internalized IgG captured by FcRn under acidic endosomal conditions 
is recycled to the cell surface where exocytosis and a shift to neutral pH 
promote extracellular IgG release. Although a similar mechanism is proposed for 
FcRn-mediated albumin intracellular trafficking and recycling, this pathway is 
less well defined but is relevant to the development of therapeutics exploiting 
FcRn to extend the half-life of short-lived plasma proteins. Recently, a 
long-acting recombinant coagulation factor IX-albumin fusion protein (rIX-FP) 
has been approved for the management of hemophilia B. Fusion to albumin 
potentially enables internalized proteins to engage FcRn and escape lysosomal 
degradation. In this study, we present for the first time a detailed 
investigation of the FcRn-mediated recycling of albumin and the albumin fusion 
protein rIX-FP. We demonstrate that following internalization via FcRn at low 
pH, rIX-FP, like albumin, is detectable within the early endosome and rapidly 
(within 10-15 min) traffics into the Rab11+ recycling endosomes, from where it 
is exported from the cell. Similarly, rIX-FP and albumin taken up by fluid-phase 
endocytosis at physiological pH traffics into the Rab11+ recycling compartment 
in FcRn-positive cells but into the lysosomal compartment in FcRn-negative 
cells. As expected, recombinant factor IX (without albumin fusion) and an FcRn 
interaction-defective albumin variant localized to the lysosomal compartments of 
both FcRn-expressing and nonexpressing cells. These results indicate that 
FcRn-mediated recycling via the albumin moiety is a mechanism for the half-life 
extension of rIX-FP observed in clinical studies.

Pharmacological administration of FGF21 analogues has shown robust body weight 
reduction and lipid profile improvement in both dysmetabolic animal models and 
metabolic disease patients. Here we report the design, optimization, and 
characterization of a long acting glyco-variant of FGF21. Using a combination of 
N-glycan engineering for enhanced protease resistance and improved solubility, 
Fc fusion for further half-life extension, and a single point mutation for 
improving manufacturability in Chinese Hamster Ovary cells, we created a novel 
FGF21 analogue, Fc-FGF21[R19V][N171] or PF-06645849, with substantially improved 
solubility and stability profile that is compatible with subcutaneous (SC) 
administration. In particular, it showed a low systemic clearance 
(0.243 mL/hr/kg) and long terminal half-life (~200 hours for intact protein) in 
cynomolgus monkeys that approaches those of monoclonal antibodies. Furthermore, 
the superior PK properties translated into robust improvement in glucose 
tolerance and the effects lasted 14 days post single SC dose in ob/ob mice. 
PF-06645849 also caused greater body weight loss in DIO mice at lower and less 
frequent SC doses, compared to previous FGF21 analogue PF-05231023. In summary, 
the overall PK/PD and pharmaceutical profile of PF-06645849 offers great 
potential for development as weekly to twice-monthly SC administered therapeutic 
for chronic treatment of metabolic diseases.

BACKGROUND: Nivolumab was the first programmed death receptor 1 (PD-1) immune 
checkpoint inhibitor to demonstrate long-term survival benefit in a clinical 
trial setting for advanced melanoma patients.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost effectiveness of nivolumab monotherapy for the 
treatment of advanced melanoma patients in England.
METHODS: A Markov state-transition model was developed to estimate the lifetime 
costs and benefits of nivolumab versus ipilimumab and dacarbazine for BRAF 
mutation-negative patients and versus ipilimumab, dabrafenib, and vemurafenib 
for BRAF mutation-positive patients. Covariate-adjusted parametric curves for 
time to progression, pre-progression survival, and post-progression survival 
were fitted based on patient-level data from two trials and long-term ipilimumab 
survival data. Indirect treatment comparisons between nivolumab, ipilimumab, and 
dacarbazine were informed by these covariate-adjusted parametric curves, 
controlling for differences in patient characteristics. Kaplan-Meier data from 
the literature were digitised and used to fit progression-free and overall 
survival curves for dabrafenib and vemurafenib. Patient utilities and resource 
use data were based on trial data or the literature. Patients are assumed to 
receive nivolumab until there is no further clinical benefit, assumed to be the 
first of progressive disease, unacceptable toxicity, or 2 years of treatment.
RESULTS: Nivolumab is the most cost-effective treatment option in BRAF 
mutation-negative and mutation-positive patients, with incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios of £24,483 and £17,362 per quality-adjusted life year, 
respectively. The model results are most sensitive to assumptions regarding 
treatment duration for nivolumab and the parameters of the fitted parametric 
survival curves.
CONCLUSIONS: Nivolumab is a cost-effective treatment for advanced melanoma 
patients in England.

OBJECTIVE: Work on longevity has found protective social, cognitive, and 
emotional factors, but to date we have little understanding of the impact of 
motivational dynamics. Autonomy orientation, or stable patterns of 
self-regulation, is theorized to be a protective factor for long-term mental and 
physical health (Ryan & Deci, 2017), and it is therefore a prime candidate for 
examining how stable psychosocial factors are linked to longevity, or life 
expectancy.
METHOD: Essays written in the 1930s by participants in the Nun Study were coded 
for indicators of an autonomy orientation. These were selected in line with an 
extensive theoretical literature based in self-determination theory (Deci & 
Ryan, 1985). Essays were coded for the propensity for choice in action, 
susceptibility to pressure, self-reflection, integration of experiences, and 
parental support for autonomy. These coded variables were used to predict age of 
death.
RESULTS: Using 176 codable essays provided by now-deceased participants, linear 
regression analyses revealed that choiceful behavior, self-reflection, and 
parent autonomy support predicted age of death. Participants who demonstrated 
these stable and beneficial motivational characteristics lived longer.
CONCLUSIONS: Personality constructs reflecting a healthy form of self-regulation 
are associated with long-term health. Implications for health interventions are 
discussed.

Expectancy in the Slovak Republic.

AIM: The aim of this study was to compute the potential gains in life expectancy 
(PGLEs) if the five main groups of non-communicable disease deaths were 
eliminated in the Slovak population during 1996-2014, and to decompose PGLEs by 
five-year age groups.
METHODS: PGLEs were computed from mortality reports for deaths from ischaemic 
heart disease (I20-25), cerebrovascular diseases (I60-I69), cancer (C00-C97), 
diabetes mellitus (E10-E14), and chronic respiratory diseases (J30-J98) using 
the life table decomposition technique.
RESULTS: In 2014, life expectancy at birth was 76.87 years compared to 72.87 in 
1996. The highest impact on life expectancy was recorded for ischaemic heart 
disease and PGLEs have changed from 3.9 years to 4.6 over 1996-2014. However, 
the trends for other diseases did not fluctuate. The PGLEs of cancer, as the 
second most influential disease, increased from 3.3 years to 3.6. Conversely, a 
slight decline was observed in cerebrovascular diseases from 1.13 years to 1.12, 
and diabetes mellitus from 0.14 years to 0.13. The proportion of diabetes 
mellitus and chronic respiratory diseases in PGLEs was low, approaching zero. As 
far as PGLEs among age groups in 2014 are concerened: whereas PGLEs for 
ischaemic heart disease mortality reduction are very similar among all age 
groups they are mostly on the decrease from other causes of death. However, 
PGLEs reached a value of 0.13 years in the 0-54 years age-group for diabetes 
mellitus; this means that the number of years of life lost are the same for 54 
year old people and younger, with the impact of diabetes mellitus declining at 
age 55 and over. The same scenario is apparent for cerebrovascular diseases. The 
impact of mortality from other causes of death is decreasing with age.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that optimum benefit would be gained from 
prevention programs for reduction of ischaemic heart disease mortality in all 
age groups.

Disparities of Potential Gains in Life Expectancy Development between the Slovak 
Republic and the Czech Republic.

Vagašová T(1), Gavurová B(1).

Author information:
(1)Faculty of Economics, Technical University of Košice, Košice, Slovak 
Republic.

AIM: The purpose of this paper is to determine how many years a person could be 
expected to live if a specific cause of death was eliminated, and to compare 
potential gains in life expectancy (PGLEs) between Slovakia (SVK) and the Czech 
Republic (CZE).
METHODS: PGLEs were computed from mortality reports (1996-2013) for deaths from 
the main groups of chronic diseases, namely ischaemic heart disease (IHD), 
cerebrovascular diseases (CVD), cancer (CA), diabetes mellitus (DM), and chronic 
respiratory diseases (CRD) for the Slovak and Czech populations in five-year age 
groups. Country comparative analysis was conducted by constructing rate ratios 
of PGLEs.
RESULTS: In 2013, life expectancy at birth for the Slovak and Czech populations 
was 76.5 and 78.3 years. Overall trends of standardised mortality rates of 
chronic diseases roughly paralleled the PGLEs trend. During 1996-2013, SVK 
reported the highest PGLEs of IHD at an average of 4.54 years, compared to PGLEs 
of CA reaching a value of 3.61 years in CZE. The PGLEs of IHD showed the largest 
gap between SVK and CZE, with an average of 1.65 higher values in SVK. With the 
elimination of CVD as the third most influential disease in both countries, 
PGLEs decreased from 1.65 to 0.93 years in CZE; a negligible drop from 1.13 to 
1.05 was recorded in SVK. The lowest impacts on life expectancy were recorded in 
DM and CRD. However, since 2005 these trends have deteriorated in CZE. In 2013, 
IHD had a similar impact on life expectancy in all age groups in SVK and a 
decreasing impact among 50-54 year olds in CZE. Similarly to SVK, people in CZE 
aged 45-49 could gain 0.94 years in LE after CVD elimination, which is nearly 
the same as at birth.
CONCLUSIONS: The higher the life expectancy after elimination of the cause of 
death is, the higher the impact of the disease on life expectancy. Health 
prevention programs should be mainly aimed at CA mortality in CZE, while the 
highest burden of IHD is seen in SVK.

Limitations.

Republic.

AIM: The concept of amenable mortality is intended to assess health care system 
performance. It is defined as "premature deaths that should not occur in the 
presence of timely and effective health care". The purpose of paper is to 
analyse differences in amenable mortality across European Union countries and to 
determine the associations between amenable mortality and life expectancy at 
birth.
METHODS: This is a cross-country and time trend analysis. Data on deaths by 
cause, and five-year age groups were obtained from the World Health Organization 
database for the 20 European Union countries, throughout the period from 2002 to 
2013. The rates of amenable mortality were expressed by the age-standardised 
death rates per 100,000 inhabitants. We applied the method of direct 
standardisation using the European Standard Population.
RESULTS: Throughout the explored period, the statistically significant 
variations of the age-standardised death rates in a relation to the European 
Union average fluctuated from 78.7 per 100,000 inhabitants (95% CI 72.4-84.9) in 
France to 374.3 per 100,000 inhabitants (95% CI 350.8-397.7) in Latvia. The 
leading causes of amenable mortality were ischaemic heart disease, 
cerebrovascular diseases, and colorectal cancer that accounted for, 
respectively, 42.2%, 19.5%, and 11.3% of overall amenable mortality. As 
expected, statistically significant strong negative relationship (R2=0.95; 
ρ=-0.98) between amenable mortality and life expectancy at birth was proved by 
linear regression. The concept has several limitations relating to the selection 
of causes of death and setting age threshold over time, not consideration 
actually available health care resources in each country, as well as differences 
in the prevalence of diseases among countries.
CONCLUSIONS: We found an explicit divide in amenable mortality rates between 
more developed countries of Western, Northern and Southern Europe, and less 
developed countries of Central and Eastern Europe. Increasing of amenable 
mortality may suggest deterioration in health care system performance.

Mastication enhances brain function and mental health, but little is known about 
the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of mastication on neural 
development in early childhood. Therefore, we analysed the gene expression in 
juvenile neural circuits in rats fed with a soft or chow diet immediately after 
weaning. We observed that the gene expression patterns in the thalamus varied 
depending on the diet. Furthermore, gene ontology analysis revealed that two 
terms were significantly enhanced: chemical synaptic transmission and positive 
regulation of dendritic spine morphogenesis. With respect to chemical synaptic 
transmission, glutamate decarboxylase and GABA receptors were upregulated in the 
chow diet group. The related genes, including vesicular GABA transporter, were 
also upregulated, suggesting that mastication activates GABAergic signalling. 
With respect to dendritic spine morphogenesis, Ingenuity Pathway Analysis 
predicted fewer extension of neurites and neurons and fewer number of branches 
in the chow diet group. The numbers of spines in the ventral posterolateral and 
posteromedial regions were significantly decreased. These results suggest that 
mastication in the early developing period upregulates GABAergic signalling 
genes, with a decrease of spines in the thalamus.

BACKGROUND: The measurement of health benefits is a key issue in health economic 
evaluations. There is very scarce empirical literature exploring the differences 
of using quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) or disability-adjusted life years 
(DALYs) as benefit metrics and their potential impact in decision-making.
METHODS: Two previously published models delivering outputs in QALYs, were 
adapted to estimate DALYs: a Markov model for human papilloma virus (HPV) 
vaccination, and a pneumococcal vaccination deterministic model (PNEUMO). 
Argentina, Chile, and the United Kingdom studies were used, where local EQ-5D 
social value weights were available to provide local QALY weights. A primary 
study with descriptive vignettes was done (n = 73) to obtain EQ-5D data for all 
health states included in both models. Several scenario analyses were 
carried-out to evaluate the relative importance of using different metrics 
(DALYS or QALYs) to estimate health benefits on these economic evaluations.
RESULTS: QALY gains were larger than DALYs avoided in all countries for HPV, 
leading to more favorable decisions using the former. With discounting and 
age-weighting - scenario with greatest differences in all countries - 
incremental DALYs avoided represented the 75%, 68%, and 43% of the QALYs gained 
in Argentina, Chile, and United Kingdom respectively. Differences using QALYs or 
DALYs were less consistent and sometimes in the opposite direction for PNEUMO. 
These differences, similar to other widely used assumptions, could directly 
influence decision-making using usual gross domestic products (GDPs) per capita 
per DALY or QALY thresholds.
CONCLUSION: We did not find evidence that contradicts current practice of many 
researchers and decision-makers of using QALYs or DALYs interchangeably. 
Differences attributed to the choice of metric could influence final decisions, 
but similarly to other frequently used assumptions.

BACKGROUND: The effects of underlying noncodified risks are unclear on the 
prognosis of patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). We aimed to evaluate 
the association of residential area life expectancy with outcomes and processes 
of care for patients with ESRD in the United States.
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.
SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: Adult patients with incident ESRD between 2006 and 2013 
recorded in the US Renal Data System (n=606,046).
PREDICTOR: The primary exposure was life expectancy in the patient's residential 
county estimated by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation.
OUTCOMES: Death, placement on the kidney transplant wait list, living and 
deceased donor kidney transplantation, and posttransplantation graft loss.
RESULTS: Median life expectancies of patients' residences were 75.6 (males) and 
80.4 years (females). Compared to the highest life expectancy quintile and 
adjusted for demographic factors, disease cause, and multiple comorbid 
conditions, the lowest quintile had adjusted HRs for mortality of 1.20 (95% CI, 
1.18-1.22); placement onto the waiting list, 0.68 (95% CI, 0.67-0.70); living 
donor transplantation, 0.53 (95% CI, 0.51-0.56); posttransplantation graft loss, 
1.35 (95% CI, 1.27-1.43); and posttransplantation mortality, 1.29 (95% CI, 
1.19-1.39). Patients living in areas with lower life expectancy were less likely 
to be informed about transplantation, be under the care of a nephrologist, or 
receive an arteriovenous fistula as the initial dialysis access. Results 
remained consistent with additional adjustment for zip code-level median income, 
population size, and urban-rural locality.
LIMITATIONS: Potential residual confounding and attribution of effects to 
individuals based on residential area-level data.
CONCLUSIONS: Residential area life expectancy, a proxy for socioeconomic, 
environmental, genetic, and behavioral factors, was independently associated 
with mortality and process-of-care measures for patients with ESRD. These 
results emphasize the underlying effect on health outcomes of the environment in 
which patients live, independent of patient-level factors. These findings may 
have implications for provider assessments.
