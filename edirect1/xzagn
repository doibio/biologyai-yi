BACKGROUND/AIMS: While cognitive impairment (CI) and dementia are among the most 
common morbid conditions in later life, life expectancies free from CI or 
dementia have been the object of much less investigation than life expectancy 
based on measures of physical functioning.
METHODS: We estimated sex-specific CI-free life expectancy in Canada for people 
aged 65 and older using data from a nationwide, multicenter Canadian study on 
the epidemiology of dementia.
RESULTS: The absolute number of years with CI remains virtually constant with 
increasing age. Whatever the current age, senior men can expect to live 2.5-3 
years of their remaining life with some form of CI and about 1.5 years of those 
with dementia. For women, these figures rise to 3-4 years with CI, of which 
2-2.5 years are spent with dementia.
CONCLUSION: Surviving to an older age does not result in a longer average 
absolute period of CI. This period is associated with a significant reduction in 
quality of life, the use of home and institutional services, as well as 
psychological and physical distress for formal and informal caregivers. Results 
are compared to findings reported in other countries.

BACKGROUND: With an increasing life expectancy, there is a rapidly growing 
sector that is aging. Depression is the most prevalent functional mental 
disorder of older population. It is estimated that about 21% of the older 
population in Shanghai are suffering from depression.
AIM: This study investigated the self-rated health related quality of life of 
community-dwelling older people diagnosed with depression in Shanghai, and to 
examine the relationships between this and mental and physical health, 
functional status and social support.
METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in two community centres with a 
convenience sample of 71 participants. Measures included subjective perception 
of health related quality of life, level of depression, cognitive function, 
number of medical conditions, activities of daily living, functional abilities, 
and social support. The majority of the participants were female (n=52, 73.23%), 
and married (n=51, 71.8%).
RESULTS: A higher level of depression was related to a poorer health related 
quality of life. Participants were least satisfied with their physical health. 
The level of depression, activities of daily living and satisfaction with social 
support were predictors of health related quality of life ratings.
CONCLUSION: The study identified how depression affects the bio-psychosocial 
status of Chinese older people. Findings are discussed in light of the 
socio-cultural environment in Shanghai.

Lord Joffe's revised Assisted Dying for the Terminally III Bill was defeated in 
the House of Lords in May 2006, but it may return to Parliament in Autumn 2006. 
Assisted dying is being promoted as a logical extension to patient autonomy for 
those who are terminally ill and suffering intolerably, and proponents claim to 
have overwhelming public support. Those who have most experience of caring for 
the terminally ill, however, come out most strongly against any change in the 
current law. This paper suggests that estimates of public opinion are 
unreliable; that assisted dying is unnecessary if we are prepared to prioritise 
good end-of-life care; and that a change in the law would do little to protect 
patients but would put other vulnerable members of society at risk.

OBJECTIVE: To measure the association between major causes of mortality and 
tobacco use; and the association between major causes of mortality and alcohol 
use, after adjusting for tobacco use.
METHOD: Employees of Australian Institute of Petroleum member companies were 
enrolled in the cohort in four industry-wide surveys between 1981 and 1999. 
Mortality of 16,547 men was determined up to 31 December 2001 and cancer 
incidence to 31 December 2000. Relative mortality and cancer incidence rates 
were computed for smoking categories compared with never smokers, and for 
alcohol consumption compared with total abstainers.
RESULTS: The highest category of smoking, more than 30 cigarettes per day, was 
associated with more than a threefold increase in all-cause mortality, a 60% 
increase in cancer incidence, a 43-fold increase in lung cancer incidence, and a 
more than fourfold increase in mortality from ischaemic heart disease. There 
were only four cancers in lifelong non-smokers. Moderate alcohol consumption 
provided a protective effect from death from all causes combined, relative to 
nil or low consumption, and relative to heavy alcohol consumption. The main 
contributor to the protective effect was protection against death from ischaemic 
heart disease.
CONCLUSIONS: Lifelong avoidance of tobacco and moderate alcohol consumption 
confer significant improvements on life expectancy.

OBJECTIVES: First, to establish whether a deprivation gradient in all-cause 
mortality exists for all ethnic groups within New Zealand; second, if such 
gradients do exist, whether their absolute slopes are the same; and third, if 
such gradients exist, what impact the unequal deprivation distributions of the 
different ethnic groups have on the observed ethnic inequalities in life 
expectancy at birth.
METHOD: Abridged lifetables for the period 1999-2003 were constructed using 
standard demographic methods for each of four ethnic groups (Asian, Pacific, 
Maori and European) by NZDep2001 quintile and sex. Gradients were estimated by 
fitting generalised linear models to the quintile-specific life expectancy 
estimates for each ethnic group (by sex). The contribution of variation in 
deprivation distributions to inter-ethnic inequalities in life expectancy was 
estimated by re-weighting the quintile-specific mortality rates for each ethnic 
group using weights derived from the European deprivation distribution and 
recalculating the lifetable.
RESULTS: All four ethnic groups exhibit deprivation gradients in all-cause 
mortality (life expectancy). Maori show the steepest gradients, with slopes 
approximately 25% steeper than those of Europeans for both males and females. By 
contrast, gradients among Asian and Pacific peoples are shallower than those of 
their European counterparts.
CONCLUSION: While socio-economic gradients in health exist among all ethnic 
groups, they are relatively shallow among Pacific and (especially) Asian 
peoples. For these ethnic groups, caution should be exercised in applying 
deprivation or other socio-economic measures as proxy indicators of need for 
health services.

Cost-effectiveness analysis of open colposuspension versus laparoscopic 
colposuspension in the treatment of urodynamic stress incontinence.

Study Group.

UK.

OBJECTIVES: To compare the cost effectiveness of laparoscopic versus open 
colposuspension for the treatment of female urinary stress incontinence.
DESIGN: Cost utility analysis alongside a randomised controlled trial.
SETTING: Six gynaecological surgical centres within the UK.
POPULATION/SAMPLE: Women with proven stress urinary incontinence requiring 
surgery.
METHODS: Open abdominal retropubic colposuspension or laparoscopic 
colposuspension carried out by experienced surgeons.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cost, measured in pounds sterling and generic 
health-related quality of life, measured using the EQ-5D. The latter was used to 
estimate patient-specific quality-adjusted life years (QALYs).
RESULTS: Healthcare resource use over 6-month follow up translated into costs of 
pound 1805 for the laparoscopic arm and pound 1433 for the open arm 
(differential mean cost pound 372; 95% credibility interval [CrI]: 274-471). At 
6 months, QALYs were slightly higher in the laparoscopic arm relative to the 
open arm (0.005; 95% CrI: -0.012 to 0.023). Therefore, the cost of each extra 
QALY in the laparoscopic group (the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio [ICER]) 
was pound 74,400 at 6 months. At 24 months, the laparoscopic arm again had a 
higher mean QALY score compared to the open surgery group. Thus, assuming that 
beyond 6 months the laparoscopic colposuspension would not lead to any 
significant additional costs compared with open colposuspension, the ICER was 
reduced to pound 9300 at 24 months. Extensive sensitivity analyses were carried 
out to test assumptions made in the base case scenario.
CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic colposuspension is not cost effective when compared 
with open colposuspension during the first 6 months following surgery, but it 
may be cost effective over 24 months.

Use of DNA quantification to measure growth and autolysis of Lactococcus and 
Propionibacterium spp. in mixed populations.

Autolysis is self-degradation of the bacterial cell wall that results in the 
release of enzymes and DNA. Autolysis of starter bacteria, such as lactococci 
and propionibacteria, is essential for cheese ripening, but our understanding of 
this important process is limited. This is mainly because the current tools for 
measuring autolysis cannot readily be used for analysis of bacteria in mixed 
populations. We have now addressed this problem by species-specific detection 
and quantification of free DNA released during autolysis. This was done by use 
of 16S rRNA gene single-nucleotide extension probes in combination with 
competitive PCR. We analyzed pure and mixed populations of Lactococcus lactis 
subsp. lactis and three different species of Propionibacterium. Results showed 
that L. lactis subsp. lactis INF L2 autolyzed first, followed by 
Propionibacterium acidipropionici ATCC 4965, Propionibacterium freudenreichii 
ISU P59, and then Propionibacterium jensenii INF P303. We also investigated the 
autolytic effect of rennet (commonly used in cheese production). We found that 
the effect was highly strain specific, with all the strains responding 
differently. Finally, autolysis of L. lactis subsp. lactis INF L2 and P. 
freudenreichii ISU P59 was analyzed in a liquid cheese model. Autolysis was 
detected later in this cheese model system than in broth media. A challenge with 
DNA, however, is DNA degradation. We addressed this challenge by using a DNA 
degradation marker. We obtained a good correlation between the degradation of 
the marker and the target in a model experiment. We conclude that our DNA 
approach will be a valuable tool for use in future analyses and for 
understanding autolysis in mixed bacterial populations.

Assaying chemotaxis of Dictyostelium cells.

Mendoza MC(1), Firtel RA.

Author information:
(1)University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA.

Both prokaryote and eukaryote cells can sense and move up chemical concentration 
gradients (chemotax). As a means of finding food sources during vegetative 
growth, Dictyostelium discoideum naturally chemotaxes toward chemicals released 
by bacteria. As part of its developmental life cycle, D. discoideum chemotaxes 
towards cAMP. This chapter describes protocols for using Dictyostelium to 
understand the cell biology behind and the signaling events necessary for 
eukaryotic amoeboid chemotaxis. The chapter includes analyses of random cell 
motility, directed motility up chemical gradients, cellular responses to uniform 
chemoattractant exposure, and the utility of fluorescent probes for chemotaxis 
signaling events. Random cell motility in the absence of chemoattractant is 
analyzed to decipher the properties of self-organizing pseudopodia extension and 
retraction. Monitoring chemotaxis toward cAMP and folate allows the 
determination of signaling events required for sensing a chemical gradient and 
moving in a directed, persistent manner up the gradient. Uniform chemoattractant 
exposure is employed to elucidate the immediate intracellular responses to 
chemoattractant stimulation. Finally, analyzing cells expressing fluorescent 
fusion proteins is vital to elucidating the location of signaling events during 
chemotaxis.

Hearing-impaired children in the United Kingdom, IV: cost-effectiveness of 
pediatric cochlear implantation.

Barton GR(1), Stacey PC, Fortnum HM, Summerfield AQ.

OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of pediatric cochlear implantation 
by conducting a cost-utility analysis from a societal perspective.
DESIGN: In a cross-sectional survey, the parents of a representative sample of 
hearing-impaired children assessed the health utility of their child using a 
revised version of the Health Utilities Index Mark III questionnaire. Linear 
regression was used to estimate the gain in health utility associated with 
implantation while controlling for eight potentially confounding variables: 
average (4-frequency, unaided, preoperative) hearing level (AHL), age at onset 
of hearing-impairment, age, gender, number of additional disabilities, parental 
occupational skill level, ethnicity, and parental hearing status. The gain in 
health utility was accumulated to estimate the number of quality-adjusted life 
years (QALYs) that would be gained from implantation over 15 yr and over a 
child's lifetime. The incremental societal cost of implantation, calculated in 
euros at 2001/2 levels, was estimated by summing the incremental costs of 
implantation that are incurred in the health sector, in the education sector, 
and by the child's family. The cost-effectiveness of cochlear implantation was 
estimated by calculating the incremental societal cost per QALY gained and was 
compared with an upper limit of acceptability of 50,000 euros per QALY.
RESULTS: The parents of 403 implanted children, and 1863 nonimplanted children, 
completed the health utility questionnaire. Higher health utility was associated 
with a more favorable AHL, an older age at onset of hearing impairment, female 
gender, having fewer additional disabilities, having parents with a greater 
occupational skill level, white ethnicity, and implantation. The gain in health 
utility associated with implantation was estimated to be higher for children 
with a worse preoperative AHL and who were implanted when younger. Over 15 yr, 
for a child implanted at age 6 with a preoperative loss of 115 dB, 2.23 QALYs 
were estimated to be gained, compared with a mean incremental societal cost of 
57,359 euros, yielding a mean cost per QALY of 25,629 euros. Cost-effectiveness 
was more favorable: (1) when estimated over a child's lifetime rather than 15 
yr, (2) for children with a worse preoperative AHL, and (3) for children who 
were implanted when younger.
CONCLUSIONS: The mean cost of gaining a QALY for the children in the present 
sample falls within acceptable limits. The strategy of giving highest priority 
for implantation to children with the greatest loss of hearing, and who are 
younger, maximizes benefit for a given cost.

When is critical care medicine cost-effective? A systematic review of the 
cost-effectiveness literature.

Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.

BACKGROUND: Receiving care in an intensive care unit can greatly influence 
patients' survival and quality of life. Such treatments can, however, be 
extremely resource intensive. Therefore, it is increasingly important to 
understand the costs and consequences associated with interventions aimed at 
reducing mortality and morbidity of critically ill patients. Cost-effectiveness 
analyses (CEAs) have become increasingly common to aid decisions about the 
allocation of scarce healthcare resources.
OBJECTIVES: To identify published original CEAs presenting cost/quality-adjusted 
life year or cost/life-year ratios for treatments used in intensive care units, 
to summarize the results in an accessible format, and to identify areas in 
critical care medicine that merit further economic evaluation.
METHODS: We conducted a systematic search of the English-language literature for 
original CEAs of critical care interventions published from 1993 through 2003. 
We collected data on the target population, therapy or program, study results, 
analytic methods employed, and the cost-effectiveness ratios presented.
RESULTS: We identified 19 CEAs published through 2003 with 48 cost-effectiveness 
ratios pertaining to treatment of severe sepsis, acute respiratory failure, and 
general critical care interventions. These ratios ranged from cost saving to 
958,423 US dollars/quality-adjusted life year and from 1,150 to 575,054 US 
dollars/life year gained. Many studies reported favorable cost-effectiveness 
profiles (i.e., below 50,000 US dollars/life year or quality-adjusted life 
year).
CONCLUSIONS: Specific interventions such as activated protein C for patients 
with severe sepsis have been shown to provide good value for money. However, 
overall there is a paucity of CEA literature on the management of the critically 
ill, and further high-quality CEA is needed. In particular, research should 
focus on costly interventions such as 24-hr intensivist availability, early 
goal-directed therapy, and renal replacement therapy. Recent guidelines for the 
conduct of CEAs in critical care may increase the number and improve the quality 
of future CEAs.

BACKGROUND: More than half of all patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma are 
over 70 years of age. Life expectancy for the elderly population is increasing 
and currently major pancreatic resection provides the only meaningful chance of 
cure for periampullary and pancreatic tumors. Controversy over what constitutes 
the correct treatment of these tumors in elderly patients continues to this day. 
The aim of our study was to determine whether age alone or age plus some 
prognostic factors constitute contraindications to major pancreatic resections.
METHODS: Between 2000 and 2005, data from 88 consecutive patients who had major 
pancreatic resection for periampullary or pancreatic tumors were entered into a 
prospective database. Fifty-three patients under 70 years of age (young 
patients), and 35 patients 70 years of age or older (elderly patients) were 
compared with respect to several characteristics and the postoperative course.
RESULTS: Postoperative mortality and morbidity, length of hospital stay, and 
long-term survival were similar in the two groups. In the elderly group, the 
mortality rate was significantly higher in patients with chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease (COPD), and the morbidity rate was significantly higher in 
patients with ASA 3 than in patients with ASA 1-2, in whom a 
pancreaticoduodenectomy or total pancreatectomy had been performed.
CONCLUSIONS: Age alone is not a contraindication for major pancreatic resection. 
In elderly patients a careful evaluation of the co-morbidities and of the type 
of surgical procedure is mandatory in order to allow the proper selection of 
those patients best suited for surgery in specialized centers.

Molecular and clinical aspects of iron homeostasis: From anemia to 
hemochromatosis.

und Immunologie, Medizinische UniversitÃ¤t Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria.

The discovery in recent years of a plethora of new genes whose products are 
implicated in iron homeostasis has led to rapid expansion of our knowledge in 
the field of iron metabolism and its underlying complex regulation in both 
health and disease. Abnormalities of iron metabolism are among the most common 
disorders encountered in practical medicine and may have significant negative 
impact on physical condition and life expectancy. Basic insights into the 
principles of iron homeostasis and the pathophysiological and clinical 
consequences of iron overload, iron deficiency and misdistribution are thus of 
crucial importance in modern medicine. This review summarizes our current 
understanding of human iron metabolism and focuses on the clinically relevant 
features of hereditary and secondary hemochromatosis, iron deficiency anemia, 
anemia of chronic disease and anemia of critical illness. The interconnections 
between iron metabolism and immunity are also addressed, in as much as they may 
affect the risk and course of infections and malignancies.

Consider a system where units having independent and identically distributed 
lifetimes enter according to a nonhomogeneous Poisson process. After the unit's 
life in the system, the unit departs the system. For a fixed system time, this 
paper relates the units' common underlying life distribution with the 
distribution of the ages of units in the system, the distribution for the system 
life of units that departed the system and the distribution for the system life 
of units that have recently departed the system. Results can be used to estimate 
the underlying life distribution or a truncated version of that distribution 
based on the ages and/or most recent ages at death in both one sample and two 
sample situations. Results include a complete characterization of the possible 
distribution of the ages of those units in the system, how to estimate the 
underlying life distribution from the most recent ages at death, and how to test 
for an underlying monotone failure rate function based on independent samples 
from the ages and most recent ages at death. Two sample inferences that involve 
a likelihood ratio ordering make use of the results in Dykstra et al. (1995, J 
Amer Statisc Assoc 90(431):1030-1040), which provides the maximum likelihood 
estimators and a likelihood ratio test when the two distributions satisfy a 
likelihood ratio ordering. For the ages of the active units and the ages at 
death among the departed units, limits for their distributions and strong 
limiting results for their empirical distributions will be provided.

This paper reports a 5-year life-table analysis on wide neck (WN) ITI implants 
placed in a private practice. In 212 patients, 263 implants were placed in the 
posterior region; 97% rehabilitated the molar area. Implants in the mandible and 
in the maxilla were 61.2% and 38.8%, respectively; the mean implant length was 
9.7 and 8.9 mm, respectively. Eighty-nine percent sites had both vestibular and 
buccal bone lamellae > or =1 mm, 9.1% had one of them <1 mm and 1.9% had both 
lamellae <1 mm. Sinus perforation during surgery occurred in 52% of the 
maxillary implants. Prosthetic information was available for 249 implants; 
implants were involved in 157 single crowns (SC) and 80 fixed partial dentures 
(FPD). Radiographic analysis was performed on 102 implants that reached the 
2-year control, and crestal bone loss (CBL) was measured. Results showed that 
five implants failed; the 5-year cumulative survival rate was 97.89%. The 1-year 
survival rate based on 259 implants was 98.8% and the 2-year survival rate based 
on 174 implants was 97.7%. In this 5-year timeframe, 94.3% of the SCs and 96.2% 
of the FPDs were free of complication. The mean CBL at the mesial and distal 
sides was 0.71 and 0.60 mm, respectively; bone losses >1 and >2 mm were recorded 
for 29.7% and 2.5% of the sides, respectively. This mid-term study showed that 
the WN ITI implants were highly predictable in private practice and that 
prosthetic complication in the molar area was an infrequent event.

BACKGROUND: Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is an essential outcome of 
health care, but there is no gold standard of HRQoL measurement. We investigated 
the impact of major chronic conditions on HRQoL using 15D and EQ-5D in a 
representative sample of Finns.
METHODS: Information on chronic somatic conditions was obtained by interviews. 
Psychiatric disorders were diagnosed using a structured interview (M-CIDI). 
Tobit and CLAD regression analysis was used to estimate the impact of conditions 
on HRQoL at the individual and population level.
MAIN RESULTS: Adjusted for other conditions and sociodemographic variables, 
Parkinson's disease had the largest negative impact on HRQoL at the individual 
level, followed by anxiety disorders, depressive disorders and arthrosis of the 
hip and knee. Based on prevalence, arthrosis of the hip or knee, depression, 
back problems and urinary incontinence caused the greatest loss of HRQoL at the 
population level. The results obtained with the two HRQoL measures differed 
markedly for some conditions and the EQ-5D results also varied with the 
regression method used.
CONCLUSIONS: Musculoskeletal disorders are associated with largest losses of 
HRQoL in the Finnish population, followed by psychiatric conditions. Different 
HRQoL measures may systematically emphasize different conditions.

In this paper, we propose the conditional optimal spacing defined as the optimal 
spacing after specifying a predetermined order statistic. If we specify a 
censoring time, then the optimal inspection times for grouped inspection can be 
determined from this conditional optimal spacing. We take an example of 
exponential distribution, and provide a simple method of finding the conditional 
optimal spacing.

[How are quality-adjusted life years defined in German studies?].

[Article in German]

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Cost-utility analysis, a way of evaluating 
health-economic data, is of increasing importance in Germany. It was the aim of 
this study to provide a systematic survey of all published cost-utility studies 
on the German health system. In addition to collecting general study 
characteristics, particular attention was paid to three questions: (1) On what 
populations are the utility values based that are necessary for calculating 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs); (2) by what method were the data generated; 
and (3) how was the construction of the health-related results documented?
METHODS: In the course of systematically reviewing all German health-economic 
evaluations, cost-utility studies published between 1990 and 2004 were 
identified. For this purpose both generic and specific health-economic databanks 
were searched using clearly defined criteria. The fulfillment of explicit 
criteria for inclusion and exclusion were tested and relevant items of 
information extracted from the full text.
RESULTS: Among 730 studies for which the full text was analysed 18 cost-utility 
studies were identified. Most of them were in medical journals in English and 
their objective was to evaluate curative medical interventions. The methods used 
for generating utility values differed greatly between them and in general were 
inadequately documented.
CONCLUSION: Most cost-utility studies combine utility values that were generated 
from different perspectives and countries of origin. In addition they used 
different methods of assessment. As a rule the methods for determining utility 
values were not transparent and inadequately documented. The calculations of 
QALYs based on these studies are not comparable. Most of the studies cannot be 
assumed to reflect the utility of medical care in respect to German patients or 
the German population.

Seeing the NICE side of cost-effectiveness analysis: a qualitative investigation 
of the use of CEA in NICE technology appraisals.

Resource scarcity is the raison d'Ãªtre for the discipline of economics. Thus, 
the primary purpose of economic analysis is to help decision-makers when 
addressing problems arising due to the scarcity problem. The research reported 
here was concerned with how cost-effectiveness information is used by the 
National Institute for Health & Clinical Excellence (NICE) in national 
technology coverage decisions in the UK, and how its impact might be increased. 
The research followed a qualitative case study methodology with semi-structured 
interviews, supported by observation and analysis of secondary sources. Our 
research highlights that the technology appraisal function of NICE represents an 
important progression for the UK health economics community: new 
cost-effectiveness work is commissioned for each technology and that work 
directly informs national health policy. However, accountability in policy 
decisions necessitates that the information upon which decisions are based 
(including cost-effectiveness analysis, CEA) is accessible. This was found to be 
a serious problem and represents one of the main ongoing challenges. Other 
issues highlighted include perceived weaknesses in analysis methods and the poor 
alignment between the health maximisation objectives assumed in economic 
analyses and the range of other objectives facing decision-makers in reality.

Implantable or external defibrillators for individuals at increased risk of 
cardiac arrest: where cost-effectiveness hits fiscal reality.

OBJECTIVES: Implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) are highly effective 
at preventing cardiac arrest, but their availability is limited by high cost. 
Automated external defibrillators (AEDs) are likely to be less effective, but 
also less expensive. We used decision analysis to evaluate the clinical and 
economic trade-offs of AEDs, ICDs, and emergency medical services equipped with 
defibrillators (EMS-D) for reducing cardiac arrest mortality.
METHODS: A Markov model was developed to compare the cost-effectiveness of three 
strategies in adults meeting entry criteria for the MADIT II Trial: strategy 1, 
individuals experiencing cardiac arrest are treated by EMS-D; strategy 2, 
individuals experiencing cardiac arrest are treated with an in-home AED; and 
strategy 3, individuals receive a prophylactic ICD. The model was then used to 
quantify the aggregate societal benefit of these three strategies under the 
conditions of a constrained federal budget.
RESULTS: Compared with EMS-D, in-home AEDs produced a gain of 0.05 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) at an incremental cost of $5225 ($104,500 
per QALY), while ICDs produced a gain of 0.90 QALYs at a cost of $114,660 
($127,400 per QALY). For every $1 million spent on defibrillators, 1.7 
additional QALYs are produced by purchasing AEDs (9.6 QALYs/$million) instead of 
ICDs (7.9 QALYs/$million). Results were most sensitive to defibrillator 
complication rates and effectiveness, defibrillator cost, and adults' risk of 
cardiac arrest.
CONCLUSIONS: Both AEDs and ICDs reduce cardiac arrest mortality, but AEDs are 
significantly less expensive and less effective. If financial constraints were 
to lead to rationing of defibrillators, it might be preferable to provide more 
people with a less effective and less expensive intervention (in-home AEDs) 
instead of providing fewer people with a more effective and more costly 
intervention (ICDs).

OBJECTIVES: The principal aim of this study was to illustrate applying 
discrete-choice methods for eliciting preferences for technology adoption 
criteria, including threshold values for cost-effectiveness ratios. A secondary 
objective was to compare the criteria weights of a sample of industry 
stakeholders with the results obtained from a study of National Institute for 
Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) recommendations.
METHODS: We administered a two-stage stated-preference (SP) question format to a 
sample of respondents who have expertise in applying economic analysis to 
technology adoption decisions. We elicited paired comparisons and recommendation 
judgments for similar criteria from a sample of International Society for 
Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research members. Respondents evaluated nine 
pairs of hypothetical drugs, first indicating which drug was "better," then 
indicating what they would recommend to a reimbursement authority such as the 
National Health Service. Stated-choice studies often obtain only 
paired-comparison judgments.
RESULTS: Parameter estimates from the initial paired-comparison question 
indicate only incremental cost-effectiveness ratio and number of affected 
patients influence evaluations. These two factors have identical weights in the 
second recommendation question, but all four factors were considered in 
determining the recommendation threshold. Our sample was more willing than NICE 
to accept trade-offs between cost-effectiveness and other drug features and was 
less concerned about cost-effectiveness ratios and information uncertainty. 
Nevertheless, our sample was in agreement with NICE about the importance of the 
number of patients who would benefit as a criterion for influencing adoption 
recommendations.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that including a question allowing 
respondents the opportunity to reject both alternatives in a forced-choice 
paired comparison can be important for obtaining accurate preference estimates. 
Our results demonstrate that SP methods offer a feasible means of quantifying a 
broad set of valuations that incorporate the preferences of patient, citizen, 
payer, and other stakeholder groups.

A dollar is a dollar is a dollar--or is it?

It is normally stated that an economic evaluation should take the societal 
perspective and that this implies the incorporation of all costs and effects, 
regardless of where these occur. Nevertheless, this broad perspective may be in 
conflict with the narrower perspective of the health-care decision-makers we are 
usually trying to aid. In this article, it is argued that not all costs have to 
be considered equally important for health-care decision-making and that there 
is a discrepancy between the economically preferred societal perspective and the 
aim of aiding health-care decision-makers. This is related to the concept of 
local rationality. Three reasons why some costs may be considered more important 
for health-care decision-makers than others are: 1) relevance; 2) equity; and 3) 
responsibility. We suggest that it may be useful to adopt a two-perspective 
approach as a standard, presenting one cost-effectiveness ratio following a 
strict health-care perspective and one following the common societal 
perspective. The health-care perspective may assist the health-care policymaker 
better in achieving health-care goals, while the societal perspective indicates 
whether the local rationality of the narrow health-care perspective is also in 
line with societal optimality. More research on actual decisions should provide 
more insight into the relative weights attached to different types of costs.

The 5' stem-loop and its role in mRNA stability in maize S cytoplasmic male 
sterility.

Molecular Breeding, College of Life Science and Technology, Huazhong 
Agricultural University, Wuhan 430070, China.

The co-transcribed orf355-orf77 region of the mitochondrial genome is associated 
with S cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS-S) in maize; the amounts of its 1.6- and 
2.8-kb transcripts were previously shown to be greatly reduced in 
fertility-restored microspores relative to the amounts in sterile plants. To 
investigate the mechanism underlying this reduction, detailed analysis of the 5' 
and 3' termini of these transcripts was conducted. Using 3' RACE analysis, the 
polyadenylation sites of the 1.6- and 2.8-kb transcripts were mapped adjacent to 
a 3' stem-loop, which may play an important role in stabilizing their 3' ends. 
No difference was found between the polyadenylation sites in sterile and 
fertility-restored microspores that could account for the differences in 
orf355-orf77 transcript levels. The 5' terminus of the 1.6-kb transcript was 
further studied by primer extension; the result revealed that there was a 
deletion of nine nucleotides only in fertility-restored microspores, and that 
this deletion eliminated a 5' stem-loop sequence. We propose that the 
elimination of the 5' stem-loop in the fertility-restored microspores could be 
the cause of the degradation of the 1.6-kb transcript. Because the 2.8-kb 
transcript can be cleaved to generate the 1.6-kb transcript, the amount of the 
2.8-kb transcript is also reduced in fertility-restored microspores.

BACKGROUND: Black, older, and less affluent women are less likely to receive 
adjuvant breast cancer therapy than their counterparts. Whereas preference 
contributes to disparities in other health care scenarios, it is unclear if 
preference explains differential rates of breast cancer care.
OBJECTIVE: To ascertain utilities from women of diverse backgrounds for the 
different stages of, and treatments for, breast cancer and to determine whether 
a treatment decision modeled from utilities is associated with socio-demographic 
characteristics.
PARTICIPANTS: A stratified sample (by age and race) of 156 English-speaking 
women over 25 years old not currently undergoing breast cancer treatment.
DESIGN AND MEASUREMENTS: We assessed utilities using standard gamble for 5 
breast cancer stages, and time-tradeoff for 3 therapeutic modalities. We 
incorporated each subject's utilities into a Markov model to determine whether 
her quality-adjusted life expectancy would be maximized with chemotherapy for a 
hypothetical, current diagnosis of stage II breast cancer. We used logistic 
regression to determine whether socio-demographic variables were associated with 
this optimal strategy.
RESULTS: Median utilities for the 8 health states were: stage I disease, 0.91 
(interquartile range 0.50 to 1.00); stage II, 0.75 (0.26 to 0.99); stage III, 
0.51 (0.25 to 0.94); stage IV (estrogen receptor positive), 0.36 (0 to 0.75); 
stage IV (estrogen receptor negative), 0.40 (0 to 0.79); chemotherapy 0.50 (0 to 
0.92); hormonal therapy 0.58 (0 to 1); and radiation therapy 0.83 (0.10 to 1). 
Utilities for early stage disease and treatment modalities, but not metastatic 
disease, varied with socio-demographic characteristics. One hundred and 
twenty-two of 156 subjects had utilities that maximized quality-adjusted life 
expectancy given stage II breast cancer with chemotherapy. Age over 50, black 
race, and low household income were associated with at least 5-fold lower odds 
of maximizing quality-adjusted life expectancy with chemotherapy, whereas women 
who were married or had a significant other were 4-fold more likely to maximize 
quality-adjusted life expectancy with chemotherapy.
CONCLUSIONS: Differences in utility for breast cancer health states may 
partially explain the lower rate of adjuvant therapy for black, older, and less 
affluent women. Further work must clarify whether these differences result from 
health preference alone or reflect women's perceptions of sources of disparity, 
such as access to care, poor communication with providers, limitations in health 
knowledge or in obtaining social and workplace support during therapy.

PURPOSE: To assess the prognostic value of symptoms in hospitalised advanced 
cancer patients.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A prospective analysis was performed of 181 hospitalised 
patients referred to a Palliative Care Team. Comprehensive symptom 
questionnaire, functional status, estimated life expectancy and survival were 
assessed. Using a Cox regression model, a predictive survival model was built.
RESULTS: Median survival: 53 d. Median number of symptoms: 4; 20 symptoms 
occurred in 10%. Multivariate analysis showed nausea, dysphagia, dyspnoea, 
confusion and absence of depressed mood as independent prognostic factors for 
survival (p<0.05) with relative risks of dying of 1.96, 1.81, 1.79, 2.35 and 
1.79, respectively. Patients with 2, 3 or 4 of these factors at the same time 
had a relative risk of dying of 2.7, 2.1 and 9.0, respectively.
CONCLUSION: A cluster of factors comprising nausea, dysphagia, dyspnoea, 
confusion and absence of depressed mood may be used to accurately predict 
survival in hospitalised advanced cancer patients.

Inequality and mortality: long-run evidence from a panel of countries.

We investigate whether changes in economic inequality affect mortality in rich 
countries. To answer this question we use a new source of data on income 
inequality: tax data on the share of pretax income going to the richest 10% of 
the population in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, 
New Zealand, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the UK, and the US between 1903 and 
2003. Although this measure is not a good proxy for inequality within the bottom 
half of the income distribution, it is a good proxy for changes in the top half 
of the distribution and for the Gini coefficient. In the absence of country and 
year fixed effects, the income share of the top decile is negatively related to 
life expectancy and positively related to infant mortality. However, in our 
preferred fixed-effects specification these relationships are weak, 
statistically insignificant, and likely to change their sign. Nor do our data 
suggest that changes in the income share of the richest 10% affect homicide or 
suicide rates.

The ecology and biodemography of Caenorhabditis elegans.

CA 95616, USA.

The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is a well-known model organism for research 
on aging and life span, but very little is known about its ecology and natural 
history. The strain N2 is the standard wild-type C. elegans and arose from the 
progeny of a single hermaphrodite. Since N2 has passed through laboratory 
culture, the influence of inadvertent selection and genetic drift on C. elegans 
strains kept in culture is unclear. Because it seems that other wild-type 
strains have also been subject to lengthy laboratory culture, the life span and 
biodemography of wild-caught C. elegans is of interest. We recovered C. elegans 
from snails (Helix aspersa) in ca. 50% of the California locations where we made 
collections. In experiments with one of the wild-caught isolates, it differed in 
important demographic properties, mortality, fertility, fitness, and activity 
patterns, from the standard N2 strain, when both strains were evaluated in a 
common laboratory environment. The differences were not only statistically 
significant; they were also large enough to be biologically important. The 
differences are consistent with the hypothesis that N2 has adapted to laboratory 
conditions.
