Severe mental disorders are associated with a life expectancy that is 
10-20 years shorter than the general population's. The prevalence of cigarette 
smoking in these populations is very high. We examined the effect of smoking on 
life expectancy and survival in patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia, 
schizoaffective disorder or bipolar affective disorder from 2007 to 2018 in 
South East London, UK. Smoking status was determined using unstructured text 
data extracted from electronic health records. A total of 21,588 patients were 
identified of which 16,717, (77.4%) were classified as current smokers and 3438 
(15.9%) as non-smokers. In female participants, life expectancy at birth was 
67.6 years in current smokers (95% CI: 66.4-68.8) and 74.9 years in non-smokers 
(95% CI: 72.8-77.0), a difference of 7.3 years. In male participants, life 
expectancy at birth was 63.5 years in current smokers (95% CI: 62.5-64.5) and 
68.5 years in non-smokers (95% CI, 64.4-72.6), a difference of 5.0 years. 
Adjusted survival models found that current smoking status was associated with 
an increased mortality risk for both females (aHR: 1.42, 95% CI: 1.21-1.66, 
p < 0.001) and males (aHR: 1.49; 95% CI: 1.25-1.79, p < 0.001). In terms of the 
effect sizes, these risks were similar to those associated with a diagnosis of 
co-morbid alcohol or opioid use disorder. Smoking may account for a substantial 
proportion of the reduced life expectancy in patients with psychotic disorders. 
Increased emphasis on reducing cigarette smoking in these populations may be the 
most effective way to reduce the mortality gap with the general population.

Introduction: Acute occlusions of the visceral arteries result in fulminant 
clinical consequences and without fast and appropriate treatment may lead to 
fatal outcome. If the obliterative disease has slow progression the huge 
capacity of the collateral circulation of the visceral arteries may remain free 
of symptoms at long run. By progression of the obliterative disease and 
extension to both, the renal arteries and the aortoiliac segment the clinical 
picture becomes more colourful. Symptoms mimicking other abdominal disorders may 
easily lead to misdiagnosis and/or unnecessary delay of adequate treatment – 
finally to organ or life threatening condition. In the present paper we deal 
with this infrequent, but severe disease in order to recognize it in time, to 
recommend proper diagnostic workup and propose adequate treatment.

Publisher: Összefoglaló. Bevezetés: A zsigeri artériák akut elzáródása fulmináns 
klinikai képpel társul, és az esetek jelentős százalékában gyorsan halálhoz 
vezet. Ha ezen artériák obliteratív folyamata lassan alakul ki, a zsigeri 
artériák gazdag kollaterális kapacitása a klinikai tüneteket sokáig elfedi. Az 
esetek egy részében az anatómiailag közel fekvő renalis artériák obliteratív 
folyamata, illetve a társuló aortoiliacalis szűkületek és/vagy elzáródások 
rendkívül szerteágazó klinikai képet okozhatnak. Az átfedések más hasi 
betegségekkel félrevezetők lehetnek, emiatt késedelmes felismerésük súlyos 
következményekkel járhat. Előfordulásuk nem gyakori, ismeretük azonban 
nélkülözhetetlen mind a diagnosztika, mind a megoldás szempontjából. 
Dolgozatunkban e bonyolult kórkép eseteit tárgyaljuk, és ismertetjük a 
megoldások lehetőségeit.

BACKGROUND: Variations in the age patterns and magnitudes of excess deaths, as 
well as differences in population sizes and age structures, make cross-national 
comparisons of the cumulative mortality impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic 
challenging. Life expectancy is a widely used indicator that provides a clear 
and cross-nationally comparable picture of the population-level impacts of the 
pandemic on mortality.
METHODS: Life tables by sex were calculated for 29 countries, including most 
European countries, Chile and the USA, for 2015-2020. Life expectancy at birth 
and at age 60 years for 2020 were contextualized against recent trends between 
2015 and 2019. Using decomposition techniques, we examined which specific age 
groups contributed to reductions in life expectancy in 2020 and to what extent 
reductions were attributable to official COVID-19 deaths.
RESULTS: Life expectancy at birth declined from 2019 to 2020 in 27 out of 29 
countries. Males in the USA and Lithuania experienced the largest losses in life 
expectancy at birth during 2020 (2.2 and 1.7 years, respectively), but 
reductions of more than an entire year were documented in 11 countries for males 
and 8 among females. Reductions were mostly attributable to increased mortality 
above age 60 years and to official COVID-19 deaths.
CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic triggered significant mortality increases in 
2020 of a magnitude not witnessed since World War II in Western Europe or the 
breakup of the Soviet Union in Eastern Europe. Females from 15 countries and 
males from 10 ended up with lower life expectancy at birth in 2020 than in 2015.

Longevity is a complex process controlled by environmental and genetic factors. 
We evaluated the association of seven drug metabolising and DNA-repair gene 
polymorphisms with longevity in an Italian cohort. A sample of 756 subjects aged 
18-98 was genotyped for CYP1A1 (rs1048943, A>G), GSTM1 (rs 1183423000, 
presence/absence), GSTT1 (rs1601993659, presence/absence), GSTP1 (rs1695, A>G), 
XRCC1 (rs1799782, C>T), XRCC1 (rs25489, A>G) and XPC (rs2228001, A>C) gene 
polymorphisms. The association between the studied gene polymorphisms and 
longevity was evaluated by dividing the sample into three age groups: 18-50, 
51-85, and 86-98. We observed a significant decrease in the frequency of the 
GSTT1 null, GSTP1 G and XPC C alleles in the oldest group with respect to the 
youngest one. We also obtained the same results when dividing the sample into 
18-85 and 86-98 age groups. The general linear model analyses confirmed a 
significant decreasing trend with age of the above mentioned alleles. We 
hypothesised that these minor alleles, being important in the sensitivity 
against the development of different types of cancer, may reflect a reduced 
life-expectancy in carrier subjects and may explain their significantly lower 
frequency observed among subjects belonging to the oldest age group.

BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has caused almost unprecedented change across health, 
education, the economy and social interaction. It is widely understood that the 
existing mechanisms which shape health inequalities have resulted in COVID-19 
outcomes following this same, familiar, pattern. Our aim was to estimate 
inequalities in the population health impact of COVID-19 in Scotland, measured 
by disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) in 2020. Our secondary aim was to 
scale overall, and inequalities in, COVID-19 DALYs against the level of 
pre-pandemic inequalities in all-cause DALYs, derived from the Scottish Burden 
of Disease (SBoD) study.
METHODS: National deaths and daily case data were input into the European Burden 
of Disease Network consensus model to estimate DALYs. Total Years of Life Lost 
(YLL) were estimated for each area-based deprivation quintile of the Scottish 
population. Years Lived with Disability were proportionately distributed to 
deprivation quintiles, based on YLL estimates. Inequalities were measured by: 
the range, Relative Index of Inequality (RII), Slope Index of Inequality (SII), 
and attributable DALYs were estimated by using the least deprived quintile as a 
reference.
RESULTS: Marked inequalities were observed across several measures. The SII 
range was 2048 to 2289 COVID-19 DALYs per 100,000 population. The rate in the 
most deprived areas was around 58% higher than the mean population rate 
(RII = 1.16), with 40% of COVID-19 DALYs attributed to differences in area-based 
deprivation. Overall DALYs due to COVID-19 ranged from 7 to 20% of the annual 
pre-pandemic impact of inequalities in health loss combined across all causes.
CONCLUSION: The substantial population health impact of COVID-19 in Scotland was 
not shared equally across areas experiencing different levels of deprivation. 
The extent of inequality due to COVID-19 was similar to averting all annual 
DALYs due to diabetes. In the wider context of population health loss, overall 
ill-health and mortality due to COVID-19 was, at most, a fifth of the annual 
population health loss due to inequalities in multiple deprivation. Implementing 
effective policy interventions to reduce health inequalities must be at the 
forefront of plans to recover and improve population health.

World's population is exponentially aging as people reaching 100 years old has 
increased. The number of areas with the highest centennial population rates 
(Blue Zones), are significantly higher. Are there any determinant factors that 
favor this situation in Spain? The goal of this study was to determine the 
possible influence of sex, rurality and socioeconomic factors (Gross Domestic 
Product (GDP)) on the prevalence of the centennial population of the Spanish 
society. The Spanish register of inhabitants was published in 2017 by the 
National Statistics Institute. The analysis was carried out both by Autonomous 
Communities and by provinces in phases: a first descriptive analysis, followed 
by an inferential analysis, based on statistical tests (independent T- Student 
test, Pearson correlation and ANOVA). There were significant interactions 
between: i) sex and longevity (in favor of the female population); ii) female 
and rural housing and iii) female, GDP and urban areas. Feminization was proven 
in the longevity revolution, but, in general, GDP per Capita was not a 
significant survival factor on its own. This study was the first step of further 
analysis related to extreme longevity in Spain, which will include other 
dependent variables such as state of health and well-being as well as social 
factors.

Background: This study aimed to investigate the disparities in stroke knowledge 
between older adults and the oldest old. Methods: Family physicians conducted a 
cross-sectional survey through face-to-face interviews with the older and oldest 
old adults of two suburban communities in the Minhang district, Shanghai between 
October 1, 2020, and November 30, 2020. All participants were classified as 
oldest old (age ≥80 years) and older adults (age 60-79 years). Between-group 
differences in stroke knowledge were investigated by multivariate logistic 
regression analysis. Results: Overall, 466 older adults including 101 (21.67%) 
oldest old persons were qualified. Older adults were more familiar with the risk 
factors and symptoms of stroke than the oldest old. By multivariable logistic 
regression analysis, older adults were more familiar with the following risk 
factors: smoking [odds ratio (OR) 0.32, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.16-0.61], 
alcohol abuse (OR 0.45, 95% CI 0.23-0.87), dyslipidemia (OR 0.51, 95% CI 
0.31-0.85), and obesity (OR 0.30, 95% CI 0.17-0.53) than the oldest old. 
Regarding stroke symptoms, older adults were more aware regarding vision 
alteration (OR 0.42, 95% CI 0.25-0.69) and face-drop (OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.35-0.95) 
than the oldest old. The oldest old were less aware of acute stroke therapy (OR 
0.11, 95% CI 0.02-0.48) and calling the emergency medical service (OR 0.30, 95% 
CI 0.12-0.70) than older adults. Finally, the older adults used television (OR 
0.53, 95% CI 0.28-1.0), WeChat (OR 0.21, 95% CI 0.05-0.89), and the community 
bulletin board (OR 0.43, 95% CI 0.23-0.80) as knowledge sources more than the 
oldest old. Conclusion: The older adults and the oldest old had significantly 
high disparities in stroke knowledge. Given the aging population across China, 
the life expectancy is expected to be longer in future decades. These 
differences should be addressed in stroke educational campaigns targeting the 
oldest old.

Forest insects are emerging in large extension in response to ongoing climatic 
changes, penetrating geographic barriers, utilizing novel hosts, and influencing 
many hectares of conifer forests worldwide. Current management strategies have 
been unable to keep pace with forest insect population outbreaks, and therefore 
novel and aggressive management strategies are urgently required to manage 
forest insects. RNA interference (RNAi), a Noble Prize-winning discovery, is an 
emerging approach that can be used for forest protection. The RNAi pathway is 
triggered by dsRNA molecules, which, in turn, silences genes and disrupts 
protein function, ultimately causing the death of the targeted insect. RNAi is 
very effective against pest insects; however, its proficiency varies 
significantly among insect species, tissues, and genes. The coleopteran forest 
insects are susceptible to RNAi and can be the initial target, but we lack 
practical means of delivery, particularly in systems with long-lived, 
endophagous insects such as the Emerald ash borer, Asian longhorn beetles, and 
bark beetles. The widespread use of RNAi in forest pest management has major 
challenges, including its efficiency, target gene selection, dsRNA design, lack 
of reliable dsRNA delivery methods, non-target and off-target effects, and 
potential resistance development in wood-boring pest populations. This review 
focuses on recent innovations in RNAi delivery that can be deployed against 
forest pests, such as cationic liposome-assisted (lipids), nanoparticle-enabled 
(polymers or peptides), symbiont-mediated (fungi, bacteria, and viruses), and 
plant-mediated deliveries (trunk injection, root absorption). Our findings guide 
future risk analysis of dsRNA-based forest protection products (FPPs) and risk 
assessment frameworks incorporating sequence complementarity-based analysis for 
off-target predictions. This review also points out barriers to further 
developing RNAi for forest pest management and suggests future directions of 
research that will build the future use of RNAi against wood-boring 
coleopterans.

There is a global unmet need for rapid and cost-effective prognostic and 
diagnostic tools that can be used at the bedside or in the doctor's office to 
reduce the impact of serious disease. Many cancers are diagnosed late, leading 
to costly treatment and reduced life expectancy. With prostate cancer, the 
absence of a reliable test has inhibited the adoption of screening programs. We 
report a microelectronic point-of-care metabolite biomarker measurement platform 
and use it for prostate cancer detection. The platform, using an array of 
photodetectors configured to operate with targeted, multiplexed, colorimetric 
assays confined in monolithically integrated passive microfluidic channels, 
completes a combined assay of 4 metabolites in a drop of human plasma in under 
2 min. A preliminary clinical study using l-amino acids, glutamate, choline, and 
sarcosine was used to train a cross-validated random forest algorithm. The 
system demonstrated sensitivity to prostate cancer of 94% with a specificity of 
70% and an area under the curve of 0.78. The technology can implement many 
similar assay panels and hence has the potential to revolutionize low-cost, 
rapid, point-of-care testing.

Many patients lapse into a physically inactive lifestyle within months after 
cardiac rehabilitation (CR) programme completion. A mobile-health (mHealth) 
home-based training application can be used to intensify and/or prolong the CR 
programme to induce long-lasting improvements of habitual physical activity 
levels. This study will assess the effect of an additional home-based training 
module during CR and post-CR on habitual physical activity levels among coronary 
artery disease patients. A total of 132 patients (>18 years old) will be 
recruited in an 18-week randomised controlled trial with four arms: (1) 6 weeks 
centre-based CR (ie, standard care), (2) 6 weeks combined centre-based+mHealth 
home-based CR, (3) 6 weeks centre-based CR followed by 12 weeks mHealth 
home-based CR, (4) 6 weeks combined centre-based+mHealth home-based CR followed 
by 12 weeks mHealth home-based CR. The intervention groups will receive a daily 
and personalised exercise training using a smartphone application (Virtual 
Training) in addition to and/or as extension of the centre-based CR programme. 
The participants will be assessed prior to the centre-based CR programme, after 
completion of the 6-week CR programme and after the 12 weeks extension. Primary 
outcome will be objectively measured habitual physical activity levels expressed 
as moderate to vigorous intensity activities (min/week). Secondary outcome 
parameters include sedentary behaviour, physical fitness (estimated VO2max), 
handgrip strength, cardiovascular risk profile, quality of life and cardiac

Background: There are substantial geographic disparities in the life expectancy 
(LE) across the U.S. with myocardial infarction (MI) contributing significantly 
to the differences between the states with highest (leading) and lowest 
(lagging) LE. This study aimed to systematically investigate the epidemiology of 
geographic disparities in MI among older adults. Methods: Data on MI outcomes 
among adults aged 65+ were derived from the Center for Disease Control and 
Prevention-sponsored Wide-Ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research 
database and a 5% sample of Medicare Beneficiaries for 2000-2017. Death 
certificate-based mortality from MI as underlying/multiple cause of death 
(CBM-UCD/CBM-MCD), incidence-based mortality (IBM), incidence, prevalence, 
prevalence at age 65, and 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival, and remaining LE at age 
65 were estimated and compared between the leading and lagging states. Cox model 
was used to investigate the effect of residence in the lagging states on MI 
incidence and survival. Results: Between 2000 and 2017, MI mortality was higher 
in the lagging than in the leading states (per 100,000, CBM-UCD: 236.7-583.7 vs. 
128.2-357.6, CBM-MCD: 322.7-707.7 vs. 182.4-437.7, IBM: 1330.5-1518.9 vs. 
1003.3-1197.0). Compared to the leading states, lagging states had higher MI 
incidence (1.1-2.0% vs. 0.9-1.8%), prevalence (10.2-13.1% vs. 8.3-11.9%), 
pre-existing prevalence (2.5-5.1% vs. 1.4-3.6%), and lower survival (70.4 vs. 
77.2% for 1-year, 63.2 vs. 67.2% for 3-year, and 52.1 vs. 58.7% for 5-year), and 
lower remaining LE at age 65 among MI patients (years, 8.8-10.9 vs. 9.9-12.8). 
Cox model results showed that the lagging states had greater risk of MI 
incidence [Adjusted hazards ratio, AHR (95% Confidence Interval, CI): 1.18 
(1.16, 1.19)] and death after MI diagnosis [1.22 (1.21, 1.24)]. Study results 
also showed alarming declines in survival and remaining LE at age 65 among MI 
patients. Conclusion: There are substantial geographic disparities in MI 
outcomes, with lagging states having higher MI mortality, incidence, and 
prevalence, lower survival and remaining LE at age 65. Disparities in MI 
mortality in a great extent could be due to between-the-state differences in MI 
incidence, prevalence at age 65 and survival. Observed declines in survival and 
remaining LE require an urgent analysis of contributing factors that must be 
addressed.

With advancements in medical treatments for cancer, an increase in the life 
expectancy of patients undergoing new treatments is expected. Consequently, the 
field of statistics has evolved to present increasingly flexible models to 
explain such results better. In this paper, we present a lung cancer dataset 
with some covariates that exhibit nonproportional hazards (NPHs). Besides, the 
presence of long-term survivors is observed in subgroups. The proposed modeling 
is based on the generalized time-dependent logistic model with each subgroup's 
effect time and a random term effect (frailty). In practice, essential 
covariates are not observed for several reasons. In this context, frailty models 
are useful in modeling to quantify the amount of unobservable heterogeneity. The 
frailty distribution adopted was the weighted Lindley distribution, which has 
several interesting properties, such as the Laplace transform function on closed 
form, flexibility in the probability density function, among others. The 
proposed model allows for NPHs and long-term survivors in subgroups. Parameter 
estimation was performed using the maximum likelihood method, and Monte Carlo 
simulation studies were conducted to evaluate the estimators' performance. We 
exemplify this model's use by applying data of patients diagnosed with lung 
cancer in the state of São Paulo, Brazil.

England.

Healthy ageing has been defined as the process of developing and maintaining the 
functional ability that enables well-being in older age. However, as people age, 
many will develop chronic diseases. Therefore, while life expectancy worldwide 
has been increasing, this does not necessarily result in a healthy full 
lifespan, with disability and ill-health often negatively affecting a person's 
end of life. This article examines the nursing skills required to support older 
people to live healthy lives against a backdrop of rising levels of chronic 
conditions. Nurses have a vital role in supporting health improvements in older 
people by providing targeted solutions such as lifestyle modifications, 
strengthened social networks and enhanced resilience.

In case of a disease or nutritional deficit, the growth curve may show 
deviations from the percentile it was depicting, and once damage is removed, a 
strong regulatory force tends to restore its path. Such phenomenon is known as 
catch-up growth and is an example of canalization of growth. Girls are more 
favored than boys because, when faced with the same damage, their growth (and 
also their psychomotor development) shows less deviation than that of boys. Such 
difference is also shown in a higher prevalence among boys of growth retardation 
in general and some developmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorder 
and cerebral palsy. Infant mortality is lower in girls at all ages and life 
expectancy is several years longer in women from all countries. The cause of 
such differences in favor of girls has a strong genetic component and is 
enriching for the interpretation of clinical and epidemiological studies.

Publisher: Ante una enfermedad o carencia nutricional, la curva de crecimiento 
puede desviarse del percentil que recorría, y cuando el daño es neutralizado, 
hay una fuerza regulatoria que tiende a restaurar su trayectoria. Este fenómeno, 
llamado crecimiento compensatorio o catch-up, es un ejemplo de canalización del 
crecimiento. Las niñas se ven favorecidas respecto de los niños porque, ante un 
mismo daño, su crecimiento (y también su desarrollo psicomotor) se desvía menos 
que el de los niños. Esta diferencia también se expresa en una mayor prevalencia 
masculina de retraso del desarrollo en general y de algunos trastornos del 
desarrollo, como trastorno del espectro autista y parálisis cerebral, entre 
otros. La mortalidad infantil es menor en niñas a todas las edades y la 
esperanza de vida es varios años mayor en mujeres en todos los países. La causa 
de estas diferencias a favor de las niñas tiene un fuerte componente genético y 
enriquece la interpretación de estudios clínicos y epidemiológicos.

Pearson syndrome (PS), shares a number of overlapping features with 
Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA), including early onset of severe anemia, making 
differential diagnosis important. Differential diagnosis of DBA and PS is 
critical, since those with DBA may respond to treatment with steroids, may 
undergo remission, or may benefit from hematopoietic stem cell transplantation 
(HSCT). However, patients with PS have a different prognosis, with a very high 
risk of developing acidosis, metabolic problems, and pancreatic dysfunction, and 
a shorter life expectancy than those with DBA. Here we present a patient who 
underwent HSCT for DBA but was subsequently diagnosed with PS after developing 
some complications.

Publisher: El síndrome de Pearson (SP) comparte varias características con la 
anemia de Diamond-Blackfan (ADB), incluida la anemia grave de inicio temprano, 
por lo que es importante hacer un diagnóstico diferencial. El diagnóstico 
diferencial de la ADB y el SP es fundamental, ya que los pacientes con ADB 
podrían responder al tratamiento con corticoesteroides, presentar remisión o 
beneficiarse del trasplante de células madre hematopoyéticas (TCMH). Sin 
embargo, los pacientes con SP tienen un pronóstico diferente, con un riesgo muy 
elevado de acidosis, problemas metabólicos y disfunción pancreática, y una 
expectativa de vida menor en comparación con aquellos con ADB. En este artículo, 
presentamos el caso de un paciente sometido a TCMH para la ADB, pero que luego 
fue diagnosticado con SP tras desarrollar algunas complicaciones.

Recently, the Food and Drug Administration granted accelerated approvals for 
four exon skipping therapies -Eteplirsen, Golodirsen, Viltolarsen, and 
Casimersen -for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD). However, these treatments 
have only demonstrated variable and largely sub-therapeutic levels of restored 
dystrophin protein in DMD patients, limiting their clinical impact. To better 
understand variable protein expression and the behavior of truncated dystrophin 
protein in vivo, we assessed turnover dynamics of restored dystrophin and 
dystrophin glycoprotein complex (DGC) proteins in mdx mice after exon skipping 
therapy, compared to those dynamics in wild type mice, using a targeted, 
highly-reproducible and sensitive, in vivo stable isotope labeling mass 
spectrometry approach in multiple muscle tissues. Through statistical modeling, 
we found that restored dystrophin protein exhibited altered stability and slower 
turnover in treated mdx muscle compared with that in wild type muscle (∼44 d vs. 
∼24 d, respectively). Assessment of mRNA transcript stability (quantitative 
real-time PCR, droplet digital PCR) and dystrophin protein expression (capillary 
gel electrophoresis, immunofluorescence) support our dystrophin protein turnover 
measurements and modeling. Further, we assessed pathology-induced muscle fiber 
turnover through bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) labeling to model dystrophin and DGC 
protein turnover in the context of persistent fiber degeneration. Our findings 
reveal sequestration of restored dystrophin protein after exon skipping therapy 
in mdx muscle leading to a significant extension of its half-life compared to 
the dynamics of full-length dystrophin in normal muscle. In contrast, DGC 
proteins show constant turnover attributable to myofiber degeneration and 
dysregulation of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in dystrophic muscle. Based on 
our results, we demonstrate the use of targeted mass spectrometry to evaluate 
the suitability and functionality of restored dystrophin isoforms in the context 
of disease and propose its use to optimize alternative gene correction 
strategies in development for DMD.

Updated Health and Cost Impacts of Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems, Using 
Recent Estimates of Relative Harm for Vaping Compared to Smoking.

BACKGROUND: Measuring population health and costs effects of liberalizing access 
to electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) is an evolving field with high 
persisting uncertainty. A critical area of uncertainty for policy-makers are 
estimates of net harms from ENDS relative to cigarettes, therefore, we model 
these harms using updated estimates incorporating disease specificity.
METHODS: We use updated estimates of relative harm of vaping vs smoking, based 
upon relevant biomarker studies to model the impact of liberalizing access to 
ENDS in New Zealand (NZ), relative to a ban (where ENDS are not legally 
available), in an existing proportional multi-state life-table model of 16 
tobacco-related diseases.
RESULTS: This modeling suggests that ENDS liberalization results in an expected 
gain of 195 000 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) over the remainder of the NZ 
population's lifespan. There was wide uncertainty in QALYs gained (95% 
uncertainty interval [UI] = -8000 to 406 000) with a 3.2% probability of net 
health loss (based upon the number of simulation runs returning positive QALY 
gains). The average per capita health gain was 0.044 QALYs (equivalent to an 
extra 16 days of healthy life). Health system cost-savings were expected to be 
NZ$2.8 billion (US$2.1 billion in 2020 US$; 95%UI: -0.3 to 6.2 billion [2011 
NZ$]), with an estimated 3% chance of a net increase in per capita cost.
CONCLUSIONS: This updated modeling around liberalizing ENDs in NZ, still 
suggests likely net health and cost-saving benefits-but of lesser magnitude than 
previous work and with a small possibility of net harm to population health.
IMPLICATIONS: This study found evidence using updated biomarker studies that 
ENDS liberalization could result in QALY gains across the New Zealand population 
lifespan that are also cost-saving to the health system. Governments should 
include the information from these types of modeling studies in their 
decision-making around potentially improving access to ENDS for existing 
smokers, while at the same further reducing access to tobacco.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Chronic shoulder pain is a frequent cause of 
suffering and impaired quality of life. Treatment includes non-pharmacological 
and pharmacological therapies, and interventional procedures such as 
suprascapular nerve blocks and radiofrequency. This prospective study aims to 
evaluate the efficacy of ultrasound-guided pulsed radiofrequency of 
suprascapular nerve for chronic shoulder pain in a clinical setting.
METHODS: Therapeutic efficacy was evaluated through pain intensity using numeric 
pain rating scale at baseline, immediately, 3, and 6 months after, and patient's 
motor function improvement. The secondary outcome was patient satisfaction.
RESULTS: A total of 34 patients were enrolled and all patients presented a 
reduction in the numeric pain rating scale immediately after treatment. Pain 
reduction from baseline to 6 months after the procedure was 34.4% and 36.9% 
static and dynamic, respectively. The median percentage reduction was 
statistically significant immediately, 3 and 6 months after. There was also an 
improvement in range of motion, 39.6% in abduction, 24.1% in flexion, and 29.5% 
in extension. Ninety percent of patients reported patient's global impression of 
change superior to six.
CONCLUSION: This study concludes that ultrasound-guided pulsed radiofrequency of 
suprascapular nerve reduces pain intensity for at least 6 months, accompanied by 
improvement of motor function and higher levels of patients' satisfaction. 
Therefore, this technique represents a valid analgesic approach to chronic 
shoulder pain.

Water scarcity is a global challenge, yet existing responses are failing to cope 
with current shocks and stressors, including those attributable to climate 
change. In sub-Saharan Africa, the impacts of water scarcity threaten 
livelihoods and wellbeing across the continent and are driving a broad range of 
adaptive responses. This paper describes trends of water scarcity for Africa and 
outlines climate impacts on key water-related sectors on food systems, cities, 
livelihoods and wellbeing, conflict and security, economies, and ecosystems. It 
then uses systematic review methods, including the Global Adaptation Mapping 
Initiative, to analyse 240 articles and identify adaptation characteristics of 
planned and autonomous responses to water scarcity across Africa. The most 
common impact drivers responded to are drought and participation variability. 
The most frequently identified actors responding to water scarcity include 
individuals or households (32%), local government (15%) and national government 
(15%), while the most common types of response are behavioural and cultural 
(30%), technological and infrastructural (27%), ecosystem-based (25%) and 
institutional (18%). Most planned responses target low-income communities (31%), 
women (20%), and indigenous communities (13%), but very few studies target 
migrants, ethnic minorities or those living with disabilities. There is a lack 
of coordination of planned adaptation at scale across all relevant sectors and 
regions, and lack of legal and institutional frameworks for their operation. 
Most responses to water scarcity are coping and autonomous responses that showed 
only minor adjustments to business-as-usual water practices, suggesting limited 
adaptation depth. Maladaptation is associated with one or more dimension of 
responses in almost 20% of articles. Coordinating institutional responses, 
carefully planned technologies, planning for projected climate risks including 
extension of climate services and increased climate change literacy, and 
integrating indigenous knowledge will help to address identified challenges of 
water scarcity towards more adaptive responses across Africa.
