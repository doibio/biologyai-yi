The acaricidal activity of Asarum heterotropoides root-derived principles, 
methyleugenol, safrole, 3-carene, α-asarone, pentadecane and A. heterotropoides 
root steam distillate constituents was tested against poultry red mites 
Dermanyssus gallinae (De Geer). All active principles were identified by 
spectroscopic analysis. Results were compared with those of two conventional 
acaricides, benzyl benzoate and N,N-diethyl-3-methylbenzamide (DEET). 
Methyleugenol (24 h LC50 = 0.57 µg/cm(2)) and safrole (24 h LC50 = 8.54 
µg/cm(2)) were the most toxic compounds toward D. gallinae, followed by 
3,4,5-trimethoxytoluene, 3,5-dimethoxytoluene, estragole, α-terpineol, 
verbenone, eucarvone, linalool, and terpinen-4-ol (LC50 = 15.65-27.88 µg/cm(2)). 
Methyleugenol was 16.7× and 11.0× more toxic than benzyl benzoate (LC50 = 9.52 
μg/cm(2)) and DEET (LC50 = 6.28 μg/cm(2)), respectively; safrole was 1.1× and 
0.73× more toxic. Asarum heterotropoides root-derived materials, particularly 
methyleugenol and safrole, merit further study as potential acaricides. Global 
efforts to reduce the level of highly toxic synthetic acaricides in indoor 
environments justify further studies on A. heterotropoides root extract and 
steam distillate preparations containing the active constituents described as 
potential contact-action fumigants for the control of mites.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the comparative cost effectiveness of day care over 
inpatient management of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy (NVP).
STUDY DESIGN: A cost utility analysis was performed using a decision analytical 
model in which a Markov model was constructed. The Markov model was primarily 
populated with data from a recently published randomised controlled trial. Which 
included pregnant women presenting to Cork University Maternity Hospital, a 
tertiary referral maternity hospital, seeking treatment for NVP. Costs and 
outcomes were estimated from the perspective of the Irish health service (HSE) 
and patients. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis, using a Monte Carlo 
simulation, was also performed. A Bayesian Value of Information analysis was 
used to estimate the value of collecting additional information.
RESULTS: When both the healthcare provider and patient's perspective was 
considered, day care management of NVP remained less costly (mean €985; 95% C.I. 
705-1456 vs. €3837 (2124-8466)) and more effective (9.42; 4.19-12.25 vs. 9.49; 
4.32-12.39 quality adjusted life years) compared with inpatient management. The 
Cost Effectiveness Acceptability Curve indicates the probability that day care 
management is 70% more cost effective compared to inpatient management at a 
ceiling ratio of €45,000 per QALY, indicating little decision uncertainty. The 
Bayesian Value of Information analysis indicates there is value in collecting 
further information; the Expected Value of Perfect Information (EVPI) is 
estimated to be €5.4 million.
CONCLUSION: Day care management of NVP is cost effective compared to inpatient 
management.

Severe obesity leads to a high incidence of complications and a decrease in life 
expectancy, especially among younger adults. Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy 
(LSG) first intended as the first step of biliopancreatic diversion with 
duodenal switch is gaining a per-se procedure role because of its effectiveness 
on weight loss and comorbidity resolution. Different techniques have been 
described for specimen extraction in LSG. In this article we report the 
technique adopted in 275 LSGs performed in our department. In the first 120 LSGs 
performed from 2007, the specimen was extracted through a mini laparotomy. In 
the following 155 cases the technique has been simplified: the grasped specimen 
has been withdrawn through the 15 mm trocar site. We registered in the fist 
group six cases of wound infection (5%), ten cases of hematoma (8.3%) and four 
cases of port site hernia (3.3%). In the second group only one case of hematoma 
(0.6%, p = 0.01) but no cases of wound infection (p = 0.01) or port site hernia, 
(p = 0.03) although we registered a specimen perforation during retrieval in 16 
patients, were reported. The technique described in the 155 cases of the control 
group has shown to be more effective than the technique we used in the case 
group, allowing significantly lower operative time (112.9 ± 1.0 vs 74.9 ± 9.1 p 
< 0.001) and complications, and providing unchanged costs.

The Study of Heart and Renal Protection (SHARP) found that treatment with 
ezetemibe and low-dose simvastatin reduced the incidence of major 
atherosclerotic events in patients with kidney disease. Due to the paucity of 
evidence-based interventions that lower cardiovascular morbidity in this 
high-risk population, the SHARP trial will likely have a large impact on 
clinical practice. However, applying the results of clinical trials conducted in 
select populations to the care of individual patients in real-world settings can 
be fraught with difficulty. This is especially true when caring for older adults 
with complex comorbidity and limited life expectancy. These patients are often 
excluded from clinical trials, frequently have competing health priorities, and 
may be less likely to benefit and more likely to be harmed by medications. We 
discuss key considerations in applying the results of the SHARP trial to the 
care of older adults with CKD in real-world clinical settings using guiding 
principles set forth by the American Geriatrics Society's Expert Panel on the 
Care of Older Adults with Multimorbidity. Using this schema, we emphasize the 
importance of evaluating trial results in the unique context of each patient's 
goals, values, priorities, and circumstances.

The number of patients with end-stage kidney disease 65 years and older is 
growing, and this growth is expected to continue. The presence of medical 
comorbidities, limited life expectancy, frailty, and poor functional status in 
these patients poses substantial challenges in clinical decision-making and 
provision of optimal care. Frailty is more common in elderly patients with CKD 
than without and is associated with poor outcomes. Several prognostic tools were 
developed to estimate the rate of CKD progression among elderly, and risk of 
mortality after dialysis initiation. Risk factors for CKD progression among 
elderly include low estimated glomerular filtration rate, high baseline 
proteinuria, acute kidney injury, low serum albumin, and presence of congestive 
heart failure. The decision to initiate dialysis in the elderly should take into 
consideration life expectancy, risks and benefits of each dialysis modality, 
quality of life, and patient and caregiver preferences. This article discusses 
common issues in the elderly with end-stage kidney disease, with particular 
emphasis on the impact of frailty and functional status, choice of dialysis 
modality and vascular access, and prognosis after dialysis initiation, to assist 
the nephrologist in making decisions regarding optimal care for this complex 
group of patients.

Life expectancy in the U.S. and globally continues to increase. Despite 
increased life expectancy quality of life is not enhanced, and older adults 
often experience chronic age-related disease and functional disability, 
including frailty. Additionally, changes in body composition such as the 
involuntary loss of skeletal muscle mass (i.e. sarcopenia) and subsequent 
increases in adipose tissue can augment disease and disability in this 
population. Furthermore, increased oxidative stress and decreased antioxidant 
concentrations may also lead to metabolic dysfunction in older adults. Specific 
amino acids, including leucine, cysteine and its derivative taurine, and 
arginine can play various roles in healthy aging, especially in regards to 
skeletal muscle health. Leucine and arginine play important roles in muscle 
protein synthesis and cell growth while cysteine and arginine play important 
roles in quenching oxidative stress. Evidence suggests that supplemental doses 
of each of these amino acids may improve the aging phenotype. However, 
additional research is required to establish the doses required to achieve 
positive outcomes in humans.

OBJECTIVE: Falls are associated with neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (nOH) 
and are an economic burden on the US healthcare system. Droxidopa is approved by 
the US FDA to treat symptomatic nOH. This study estimates the cost-effectiveness 
of droxidopa vs standard of care from a US payer perspective.
METHODS: A Markov model was used to predict numbers of falls and treatment 
responses using data from a randomized, double-blind trial of patients with 
Parkinson's disease and nOH who received optimized droxidopa therapy or placebo 
for 8 weeks. The severity of falls, utility values, and injury-related costs 
were derived from published studies. Model outcomes included number of falls, 
number of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and direct costs. Incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated. Outcomes were extrapolated 
over 12 months.
RESULTS: Patients receiving droxidopa had fewer falls compared with those 
receiving standard of care and gained 0.33 QALYs/patient. Estimated droxidopa 
costs were $30,112, with estimated cost savings resulting from fall avoidance of 
$14,574 over 12 months. Droxidopa was cost-effective vs standard of care, with 
ICERs of $47,001/QALY gained, $24,866 per avoided fall with moderate/major 
injury, and $1559 per avoided fall with no/minor injury. The main drivers were 
fall probabilities and fear of fall-related inputs.
LIMITATIONS: A limitation of the current study is the reliance on falls data 
from a randomized controlled trial where the placebo group served as the proxy 
for standard of care. Data from a larger patient population, reflecting 
'real-life' patient use and/or comparison with other agents used to treat nOH, 
would have been a useful complement, but these data were not available.
CONCLUSION: Using Markov modeling, droxidopa appears to be a cost-effective 
option compared with standard of care in US clinical practice for the treatment 
of nOH.

INTRODUCTION: The occurrence of two synchronous, primary cancers is rare. 
Thyroid carcinoma is incidentally found in the resection specimen after surgery 
for head and neck cancer in 0.3-1.9% of the patients.
PRESENTATION OF CASE: In this report, we describe the case of a 72-year-old 
patient in whom a primary (synchronous) papillary thyroid carcinoma was found 
coincidentally upon pathologic examination of lymph nodes recovered from the 
cervical neck lymph node dissection specimen after a 'commando' procedure for 
carcinoma of the oral cavity.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: There is no gold standard concerning treatment of the 
incidentally discovered thyroid gland carcinoma. The decision to perform surgery 
depends on the life expectancy of the patient, whether the thyroid gland 
demonstrates clinical or radiologic lesions, the already completed treatment for 
the head and neck cancer and should always be adjusted to the specific patient.

[Years of Life Lost Due to Premature Death and Their Relationship with Climate 
and Socio-Economic Performance of Regions].

[Article in Russian]

Boytsov SA, Samorodskaya IV, Tret'jakov VV, Vatolina MA.

BACKGROUND: The "years of potential life lost" (YPLL) indicator is widely used 
in international studies. Still YPLL's variety in the Russian regions is poorly 
investigated.
OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to study the performance of YPLL in the regions of Russia 
in 2013 and their relationship with the regional socio-economic indicators.
METHODS: Non-clinical observational study was conducted. The object of 
study--YPLL in the Russian regions. YPLL per 100 thousand population 
(non-standardized and standardized to the world standard population age 
structure) is based on data of Rosstat. Subject of investigation--YPLL 
variability in the regions, the evaluation of the correlation between YPLL, 
climatic effect and socio-economic indicators of the regions.
RESULTS: The average standardized YPLL in the region was 20,185 (95% CI 
19,272-21,029); non-standardized--25,880 (95% CI 24,744-26,957). Maximum 
standardized YPLL above the minimum in 3.4 times. Minimum YPLL rates were 
recorded in the North Caucasus, Moscow and St. Petersburg; maximum--in Chukotka, 
Republic of Tuva and the Jewish Autonomous Region. Negative statistically 
significant correlation to the average power detected between YPLL and: 1) 
specific weight of the total space, equipped with water supply, hot water supply 
and sanitation; 2) share of population with tertiary education in total 
population; 3) road density (km of roads per 1000 sq km); 4) climatic 
conditions.
CONCLUSION: The regional YPLL indicators vary considerably and are higher than 
the similar indicators in developed countries. According to the findings PYLL 
indicator are influenced by economic factor,indicators of household living 
conditions of the population, the infrastructure system in the region, the level 
of education of the population and climatic effect. The resuts we got require 
further multidisciplinary study of the problem.

BACKGROUND: In Japan, the care burden for elderly requiring care is a serious 
social issue due to increasing life expectancy and the resulting need for 
long-term care. We qualitatively described how caregivers dealt with the 
prolonged caregiving and incorporated caregiving into their lives. We also 
explained the process of "everlasting caregiving" among primary long-term family 
caregivers at home.
METHODS: Data were obtained from semi-structured interviews conducted in Japan 
from 2009 to 2011 about caregiving experience with 23 primary caregivers of care 
recipients. The grounded theory approach was applied for data analysis.
RESULTS: In this study, caregivers perceived their caregiving as everlasting. In 
particular, when care recipients stayed alive or when caregivers suffered from 
diseases, caregivers were not determined to be "unable to perform caregiving." 
However, when they undertook caregiving, they thought of it in a finite sense. 
As a result, caregivers feel that they endure caregiving for an endless period. 
The long-term period of caregiving was divided into two phases, depending on 
whether caregivers realized the finiteness of caregiving or not. We identified 
five categories for surviving caregiving in these two phases as follows: 
Addition of a positive meaning of the use of caregiving services, Management of 
the use of caregiving services under the initiative of the caregivers, Receiving 
assistance that can be accomplished without making considerable changes in the 
lifestyles of family members and relatives, Obtaining available assistances as 
necessary provided by neighbors and friends, and Re-definition of caregiving 
needs. This process was named "Handling of the amount and quality of care: 
surviving strategies for the endless caregiving of impaired elderly at home."
CONCLUSIONS: In this study, caregivers carried out long-term caregiving, but not 
without struggles. Caregivers could continue their caregiving due to initiative, 
maintaining the role of primary caregiver. Family members and relatives 
respected caregivers' individuality and decisions.

Chronic myeloid leukemia in pregnancy: an absolute contraindication to neuraxial 
anesthesia?

Chronic myeloid leukemia is rare in pregnancy with an estimated incidence of 
1:75000. It is a genetic myeloproliferative disorder marked by increased and 
unregulated growth of myeloid cells in the bone marrow. The terminal phase of 
chronic myeloid leukemia may develop into a blast crisis, defined as >30% 
myeloblasts in the circulation. A blast crisis resembles an acute leukemia and 
is associated with rapid clinical deterioration and short survival. Targeted 
gene therapy with tyrosine kinase inhibitors is effective in treatment but when 
these agents are discontinued, as in pregnancy, the patient may relapse and 
blast cells may enter the circulation. Theoretically, a central nervous system 
blast crisis may be induced by inadvertent intrathecal seeding of circulating 
blast cells, and is associated with a high mortality rate and a median life 
expectancy of three months. We describe the anesthetic management of a patient 
with chronic myeloid leukemia and blast cells in the circulation who required 
cesarean delivery. After considering the potential anesthetic risks and 
benefits, general anesthesia was chosen. Although an iatrogenic central nervous 
system blast crisis is extremely rare, the high morbidity and mortality 
associated with such an event should be considered when formulating an 
anesthetic plan.

BACKGROUND: Endovascular aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR) is a prophylactic 
procedure, so the decision to operate should consider, as recent guidelines 
suggest, the life expectancy of the patient. Several models for predicting life 
span have been already designed, but little is known about how intervened 
patients evolve in Southern European Countries, where the incidence of coronary 
artery disease, the main cause of death among these subjects, is low.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of 176 consecutive patients who 
underwent elective EVAR at the Vascular Surgery Department of the Hospital del 
Mar (Barcelona, Spain) during 2000-2014. Cox regressions were performed to 
identify preoperative factors associated with long-term survival after EVAR, and 
a risk model was developed.
RESULTS: Three- and five-year survival rates were 73.9 and 53.9 %, respectively. 
During the follow-up, 72 deaths (40.9 %) were registered, cancer being the most 
frequent cause (41.7 %). Preoperative variables negatively associated with 
long-term survival were serum creatinine ≥ 150 µmol/L (HR 2.5; 95 % CI 1.4-4.2), 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (HR 1.9; 95 % CI 1.2-3.1), atrial 
fibrillation (HR 2.0; 95 % CI 1.2-3.4), and prior cancer history (HR 1.9; 95 % 
CI 1.2-3.1). Distal pulses present in both lower limbs were marginally 
associated with survival (HR 0.65; 95 % CI 0.4-1.07). The survival predictive 
model showed a good discrimination capacity (C statistic = 0.703; 95 % CI 
0.641-0.765).
CONCLUSIONS: Long-term survival of patients submitted to EVAR in our setting was 
worse than expected and markedly related to cancer. Our study suggests that 
predictive models for long-term survival after EVAR may be influenced by 
regional characteristics of the intervened population. This effect should be 
taken in consideration in the decision-making process of these patients.

Nanotechnology is a promising, novel field of technological development. There 
is great potential in research and clinical applications for neurological 
diseases. Here we chronicle the inception of nanotechnology, discuss its 
integration with neurology, and highlight the challenges in current application. 
Some of the problems involving practical use of neuronanotechnology are direct 
biological toxicity, visualization of the nanodevice, and the short life 
expectancy of nanomachinery. Neuron cell therapy is an upcoming field for the 
treatment of challenging problems in neurology. Peptide nanofibers based on 
amphiphilic molecules have been developed that can autoregulate their structure 
depending on the conditions of the surrounding milieu. Such frameworks are 
promising for serving as drug delivery systems or communication bridges between 
damaged neurons. For common disabling diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), 
Parkinson's disease (PD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and multiple 
sclerosis (MS), recent developments have seen revolutionary nanotech-based 
novelties, which are discussed here in detail. Bioimaging integrated with 
nanoneuromedicine has opened up new doors for cancer and infection therapeutics.

This study involved a cost-utility analysis of early diagnosis and treatment of 
diabetic retinopathy depending on the screening strategy used. The four 
screening strategies evaluated were no screening, opportunistic examination, 
systematic fundus photography, and systematic examination by an 
ophthalmologists. Each strategy was evaluated in 10,000 adults aged 40 yr with 
newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus (hypothetical cohort). The cost of each 
strategy was estimated in the perspective of both payer and health care system. 
The utility was estimated using quality-adjusted life years (QALY). Incremental 
Cost Effectiveness Ratio (ICER) for the different screening strategies was 
analyzed. After exclusion of the weakly dominating opportunistic strategy, the 
ICER of systematic photography was 57,716,867 and that of systematic examination 
by ophthalmologists was 419,989,046 from the perspective of the healthcare 
system. According to the results, the systematic strategy is preferable to the 
opportunistic strategy from the perspective of both a payer and a healthcare 
system. Although systematic examination by ophthalmologists may have higher 
utility than systematic photography, it is associated with higher cost. The 
systematic photography is the best strategy in terms of cost-utility. However 
systematic examination by ophthalmologists can also be a suitable policy 
alternative, if the incremental cost is socially acceptable.

The Corynebacterium glutamicum R cgR_1959 gene encodes an endoribonuclease of 
the RNase III family. Deletion mutant of cgR_1959 (Δrnc mutant) showed an 
elongated cell shape, and presence of several lines on the cell surface, 
indicating a required of RNase III for maintaining normal cell morphology in C. 
glutamicum. The level of mraZ mRNA was increased, whereas cgR_1596 mRNA encoding 
a putative cell wall hydrolase and ftsEX mRNA were decreased in the Δrnc mutant. 
The half-life of mraZ mRNA was significantly prolonged in the Δrnc and the Δpnp 
mutant strains. This indicated that the degradation of mraZ mRNA was performed 
by RNase III and the 3'-to-5' exoribonuclease, PNPase. Northern hybridization 
and primer extension analysis revealed that the cleavage site for mraZ mRNA by 
RNase III is in the coding region. Overproduction of MraZ resulted in an 
elongated cell shape. The expression of ftsEX decreased while that of cgR_1596 
unchanged in an MraZ-overexpressing strain. An electrophoretic mobility shift 
assay and a transcriptional reporter assay indicate that MraZ is a 
transcriptional repressor of ftsEX in C. glutamicum. These results indicate that 
RNase III is required for efficient expression of MraZ-dependent ftsEX and 
MraZ-independent cgR_1596.

BACKGROUND: Cardiac rehabilitation can reduce mortality of patients with 
cardiovascular disease, but a frequently low participation rate in 
rehabilitation programs has been found globally. The objective of the Teledialog 
study was to assess the cost-utility (CU) of a cardiac telerehabilitation (CTR) 
program. The aim of the intervention was to increase the patients' participation 
in the CTR program. At discharge, an individualized 3-month rehabilitation plan 
was formulated for each patient. At home, the patients measured their own blood 
pressure, pulse, weight, and steps taken for 3 months.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The analysis was carried out together with a randomized 
controlled trial with 151 patients during 2012-2014. Costs of the intervention 
were estimated with a health sector perspective following international 
guidelines for CU. Quality of life was assessed using the 36-Item Short Form 
Health Survey.
RESULTS: The rehabilitation activities were approximately the same in the two 
groups, but the number of contacts with the physiotherapist was higher among the 
intervention group. The mean total cost per patient was €1,700 higher in the 
intervention group. The quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gain was higher in 
the intervention group, but the difference was not statistically significant. 
The incremental CU ratio was more than €400,000 per QALY gained.
CONCLUSIONS: Even though the rehabilitation activities increased, the program 
does not appear to be cost-effective. The intervention itself was not costly 
(less than €500), and increasing the number of patients may show reduced costs 
of the devices and make the CTR more cost-effective. Telerehabilitation can 
increase participation, but the intervention, in its current form, does not 
appear to be cost-effective.

Cognitive Ageing in Great Britain in the New Century: Cohort Differences in 
Episodic Memory.

Manchester, United Kingdom.

BACKGROUND: Dementias in high income countries are set to be the third major 
burden of disease even as older people are increasingly required to think for 
themselves how to provide for their lives in retirement. Meanwhile the period of 
older age continues to extend with increase in life expectancy. This challenge 
demands an understanding of how cognition changes over an extended period in 
later life. But studying cognitive ageing in the population faces a difficulty 
from the fact that older respondents are liable to leave (attrite) before study 
completion. This study tested three hypotheses: trajectories of cognitive ageing 
in Britain show an improvement beyond the age of 50; and they are lifted by 
secular improvement in cognition across cohorts; lastly they are susceptible to 
distortion due to attrition.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: Using the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing, this paper 
studied trajectories of episodic memory of Britons aged 50-89 from 2002 to 2013 
(N = 5931). Using joint models the analysis found that levels of episodic memory 
follow a curvilinear shape, not a steady decline, in later life. The findings 
also revealed secular improvement in cognitive ageing such that as a cohort is 
being replaced episodic memory levels in the population improve. The analysis 
lastly demonstrated that failure to simultaneously model attrition can produce 
distorted pictures of cognitive ageing.
CONCLUSION: Old age in this century is not necessarily a period dominated by 
cognitive decline. In identifying behavioural factors associated with better 
cognitive ageing, such as social connections of traditional and online kinds, 
the paper raises possibilities of mustering an adequate response to the 
cognition challenge.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a new generation integrase 
inhibitor (INI), dolutegravir (DTG), in France, in treatment-experienced (TE) 
and INI-naïve HIV-infected adults with at least two classes resistance compared 
to raltegravir (RAL), by adapting previously published Anti-Retroviral Analysis 
by Monte Carlo Individual Simulation (ARAMIS) model.
METHODS: ARAMIS is a microsimulation Markov model with a lifetime time horizon 
and a monthly cycle length. Health states are defined as with or without 
opportunistic infection and death. In the initial cohort, efficacy and safety 
data were derived from a phase III study comparing DTG to RAL. Antiretroviral 
treatment algorithms, accounting for patient history, were based on French 
guidelines and experts opinion. Costs are mainly including treatment costs, 
routine HIV and opportunistic infection care, and death. Utilities depend on 
CD4+ cell count and the occurrence of opportunistic infections.
RESULTS: The ARAMIS model indicates in the TE population that DTG compared to 
RAL over a life time is associated with 0.35 additional quality-adjusted life 
years (QALY; 10.75 versus 10.41) and additional costs of €7,266 (€390,001 versus 
€382,735). DTG increased costs are mainly related to a 9.1-month increase in 
life expectancy for DTG compared with RAL, and consequently a longer time spent 
on ART. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for DTG compared with 
RAL is €21,048 per QALY gained. About 83% and 14% of total lifetime costs are 
associated with antiretroviral therapy and routine HIV care respectively. 
Univariate deterministic sensitivity analyses demonstrate the robustness of the 
model.
CONCLUSION: DTG is cost-effective in the management of TE INI naive patients in 
France, from a collective perspective. These results could be explained by the 
superior efficacy of DTG in this population and its higher genetic barrier to 
resistance compared to RAL. These data need to be confirmed with longer-term 
real life data.

There are few studies evaluating the cost-effectiveness of self-management 
interventions for patients with psoriasis. Motivational interviewing (MI) as a 
telephone follow-up after climate-heliotherapy was effective on several clinical 
parameters, but its cost-effectiveness is unknown. A cost-utility analysis was 
conducted alongside a randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing MI with usual 
care. A total of 169 Norwegian patients were included. A within-trial analysis 
compared the costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Utilities were 
measured with the 15D instrument, supplemented with Dermatological Life Quality 
Index (DLQI). A time-integrated summary score defined the clinical effects. 
QALYs were adjusted for baseline differences. MI provided equivalent quality of 
life and utility (15D: -0.0022 QALYs (95% Cl -0.02, 0.01), p = 0.77, and DLQI: 
-0.62 QALYs (95%CI -0.65, 0.41), p = 0.24, at lower costs €-1103 (-2293, 87), 
p = 0.058, compared with treatment-as-usual. The MI intervention was thus 
cost-effective. This result was more evident when using the DLQI as outcome 
measure compared with 15D.

BACKGROUND: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a common chronic inflammatory disease 
causing joint damage, disability, and reduced life expectancy. Highly effective 
drugs are now available for the treatment of RA. However, poor adherence to drug 
regimens remains a significant barrier to improving clinical outcomes in RA. 
Poor adherence has been shown to be linked to patients' beliefs about medicines 
with a potential impact on adherence. These beliefs are reported to be different 
between ethnic groups. The purpose of this study was to identify potential 
determinants of adherence to disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) 
including an assessment of the influence of beliefs about medicines and 
satisfaction with information provided about DMARDs and compare determinants of 
adherence between RA patients of White British and South Asian.
METHODS: RA patients of either White British (n = 91) or South Asian (n = 89) 
origin were recruited from secondary care. Data were collected via 
questionnaires on patients': (1) self-reported adherence (Medication Adherence 
Report Scale-MARS); (2) beliefs about medicines (Beliefs about Medicines 
Questionnaire-BMQ); (3) illness perceptions (Illness Perceptions 
Questionnaire-IPQ) and (4) satisfaction with information about DMARDs 
(Satisfaction with Information about Medicines questionnaire-SIMS). In addition, 
clinical and demographic data were collected.
RESULTS: The results revealed that socio-demographic factors only explained a 
small amount of variance in adherence whereas illness representations and 
treatment beliefs were more substantial in explaining non-adherence to DMARDs. 
Patients' self-reported adherence was higher in White British than South Asian 
patients (median 28 (interquartile range 26-30) vs median 26 (interquartile 
range 23-30) respectively; P = 0.013, Mann-Whitney test). Patients who reported 
lower adherence were more dissatisfied with the information they had received 
about their DMARDs (P < 0.001, Spearman correlation, SIMS action and usage 
subscale; P < 0.001, Spearman correlation, SIMS potential problems subscale) and 
had more negative beliefs about their DMARDs and were related to ethnicity with 
South Asian patients having more negative views about medicines.
CONCLUSIONS: Socio-demographic factors were found to explain a small amount of 
variance in adherence. Illness representations and treatment beliefs were more 
important in explaining non-adherence to DMARDs. Clinicians managing South Asian 
patients with RA need to be aware that low adherence may be linked to negative 
beliefs about medicines and illness representations of RA.

BACKGROUND: Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) is common, affecting nearly 400 
million people worldwide. Achieving good health for people with T2DM requires 
active self-management; however, uptake of self-management education is poor, 
and there is an urgent need to find better, more acceptable, cost-effective 
methods of providing self-management support. Web-based self-management support 
has many potential benefits for patients and health services. The aim of this 
trial is to determine the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a web-based 
self-management support programme for people with T2DM.
METHODS: This will be a multi-centre individually randomised controlled trial in 
primary care, recruiting adults with T2DM who are registered with participating 
general practices in England. Participants will be randomised to receive either 
an evidence-based, theoretically informed, web-based self-management programme 
for people with T2DM which addresses medical, emotional, and role management, 
called Healthy Living for People with type 2 Diabetes (HeLP-Diabetes) or a 
simple information website. The joint primary outcomes are glycated haemoglobin 
(HbA1c) and diabetes-related distress, measured by the Problem Areas In Diabetes 
(PAID) questionnaire. Secondary outcomes include cardiovascular risk factors, 
depression and anxiety, and self-efficacy for self-management of diabetes. 
Health economic data include health service use, costs due to the intervention, 
and EQ-5D for calculation of Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYS). Data will be 
collected at baseline, 3 months and 12 months, with the primary endpoint at 12 
months. Practice nurses, blinded to patient allocation, collect clinical data; 
patients complete online questionnaires for patient reported measures. A sample 
size of 350 recruited participants allows for attrition of up to 15 % and will 
provide 90 % power of detecting at a 5 % significance level a true average 
difference in the PAID score of 4.0 and 0.25 % change in HbA1c (both small 
effect sizes). The analysis will follow a pre-specified analysis plan, based on 
comparing the groups as randomised (intention-to-treat).
DISCUSSION: The findings of this trial are likely to be of interest to policy 
makers, clinicians, and commissioners, all of whom are actively seeking 
additional forms of self-management support for people with T2DM.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: The Trial Registration number is ISRCTN 02123133 ; date of 
registration 14.2.13.
