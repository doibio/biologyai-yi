The majority of men with prostate cancer are diagnosed when they are older than 
65 years; however, clinical trial participants are disproportionately younger 
and more fit than the real-world population treated in typical clinical 
practices. It is, therefore, unknown whether the optimal approach to prostate 
cancer treatment is the same for older men as it is for younger and/or more fit 
men. Short screening tools can be used to efficiently assess frailty, functional 
status, life expectancy, and treatment toxicity risk. These risk assessment 
tools allow for targeted interventions to increase a patient's reserve and 
improve treatment tolerance, potentially allowing more men to experience the 
benefit of the significant recent treatment advances in prostate cancer. 
Treatment plans should also take into consideration each patient's individual 
goals and values considered within their overall health and social context to 
reduce barriers to care. In this review, we will discuss evidence-based risk 
assessment and decision tools for older men with prostate cancer, highlight 
intervention strategies to improve treatment tolerance, and contextualize these 
tools within the current treatment landscape for prostate cancer.

Since the publication of the 2015 EAPCI consensus on rotational atherectomy, the 
number of percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) performed in patients with 
severely calcified coronary artery disease has grown substantially. This has 
been prompted on one side by the clinical demand for the continuous increase in 
life expectancy, the sustained expansion of the primary PCI networks worldwide, 
and the routine performance of revascularization procedures in elderly patients; 
on the other side, the availability of new and dedicated technologies such as 
orbital atherectomy and intravascular lithotripsy, as well as the optimization 
of the rotational atherectomy system, has increased operators' confidence in 
attempting more challenging PCI. This current EAPCI clinical consensus statement 
prepared in collaboration with the EURO4C-PCR group describes the comprehensive 
management of patients with heavily calcified coronary stenoses, starting with 
how to use non-invasive and invasive imaging to assess calcium burden and inform 
procedural planning. Objective and practical guidance is provided on the 
selection of the optimal interventional tool and technique based on the specific 
calcium morphology and anatomic location. Finally, the specific clinical 
implications of treating these patients are considered, including the prevention 
and management of complications and the importance of adequate training and 
education.

BACKGROUND: Uterine fibroids are the most common benign neoplasm of the uterus 
and a major source of morbidity for women. We report an overview of trends in 
uterine fibroids of incidence rate, prevalence rate, years lived with disability 
(YLDs) rate in 204 countries and territories over the past 30 years and 
associations with age, period, and birth cohort.
METHODS: The incident case, incidence rate, age-standardized rate (ASR) for 
incidence, prevalent case, prevalence rate, ASR for prevalence, number of YLDs, 
YLD rate, and ASR for YLDs were derived from the Global Burden of Disease 2019 
(GBD 2019) study. We utilized an age-period-cohort (APC) model to estimate 
overall annual percentage changes in the rate of incidence, prevalence, and YLDs 
(net drifts), annual percentage changes from 10 to 14 years to 65-69 years 
(local drifts), period and cohort relative risks (period/cohort effects) between 
1990 and 2019.
RESULTS: Globally, the incident cases, prevalent cases, and the number of YLDs 
of uterine fibroids increased from 1990 to 2019 with the growth of 67.07%, 
78.82% and 77.34%, respectively. High Socio-demographic Index (SDI) and 
high-middle SDI quintiles with decreasing trends (net drift < 0.0%), and 
increasing trends (net drift > 0.0%) were observed in middle SDI, low-middle 
SDI, and low SDI quintiles in annual percentage change of incidence rate, 
prevalence rate and YLDs rate over the past 30 years. There were 186 countries 
and territories that showed an increasing trend in incidence rate, 183 showed an 
increasing trend in prevalence rate and 174 showed an increasing trend in YLDs 
rate. Moreover, the effects of age on uterine fibroids increased with age and 
peaked at 35-44 years and then declined with advancing age. Both the period and 
cohort effects on uterine fibroids showed increasing trend in middle SDI, 
low-middle SDI and low SDI quintiles in recent 15 years and birth cohort later 
than 1965.
CONCLUSIONS: The global burden of uterine fibroids is becoming more serious in 
middle SDI, low-middle SDI and low SDI quintiles. Raising awareness of uterine 
fibroids, increasing medical investment and improving levels of medical care are 
necessary to reduce future burden.

Palestinian citizens of Israel (PCI) constitute almost 20% of the Israeli 
population. Despite having access to one of the most efficient healthcare 
systems in the world, PCI have shorter life expectancy and significantly worse 
health outcomes compared to the Jewish Israeli population. While several studies 
have analysed the social and policy determinants driving these health 
inequities, direct discussion of structural racism as their overarching etiology 
has been limited. This article situates the social determinants of health of PCI 
and their health outcomes as stemming from settler colonialism and resultant 
structural racism by exploring how Palestinians came to be a racialized minority 
in their homeland. In utilising critical race theory and a settler colonial 
analysis, we provide a structural and historically responsible reading of the 
health of PCI and suggest that dismantling legally codified racial 
discrimination is the first step to achieving health equity.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To highlight the added benefits of approved and upcoming, 
centrally-acting, anti-obesity drugs, focusing not only on the most common 
metabolic and cardiovascular effects but also on their less explored clinical 
benefits and drawbacks, in order to provide clinicians with a tool for more 
comprehensive, pharmacological management of obesity.
RECENT FINDINGS: Obesity is increasingly prevalent worldwide and has become a 
challenge for healthcare systems and societies. Reduced life expectancy and 
cardiometabolic complications are some of the consequences of this complex 
disease. Recent insights into the pathophysiology of obesity have led to the 
development of several promising pharmacologic targets, so that even more 
effective drugs are on the horizon. The perspective of having a wider range of 
treatments increases the chance to personalize therapy. This primarily has the 
potential to take advantage of the long-term use of anti-obesity medication for 
safe, effective and sustainable weight loss, and to concomitantly address 
obesity complications/comorbidities when already established. The evolving 
scenario of the availability of anti-obesity drugs and the increasing knowledge 
of their added effects on obesity complications will allow clinicians to move 
into a new era of precision medicine.

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of niraparib 
versus routine surveillance as maintenance therapy for patients with 
platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer in China.
METHOD: A three-state partitioned survival model that adopted a lifetime horizon 
with a 4-week cycle length was developed. Efficacy data were derived from the 
NORA study. Cost and utility data were obtained from published studies and 
online databases. The cost and health outcomes were discounted at an annual rate 
of 5%. In this analysis, the primary outcomes included quality-adjusted 
life-year (QALY) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). The 
willingness-to-pay (WTP) thresholds were set at 1 to 3 times the gross domestic 
product per capita of China in 2022 ($12,741 to $38,233/QALY). Sensitivity 
analyses were conducted to verify the robustness of the model results.
RESULTS: In the base-case analysis, niraparib was not found to be 
cost-effective, with an ICER of $42,888/QALY compared with routine surveillance 
at the WTP thresholds. One-way deterministic sensitivity analyses indicated that 
the ICER value was most sensitive to the cost of subsequent treatment in placebo 
group. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis suggested that at the WTP 
thresholds, the probability of niraparib being cost-effective was 2.9% to 50.1%.
CONCLUSIONS: Niraparib improves the survival benefit of platinum-sensitive 
recurrent ovarian cancer patients. However, it seems to be less cost-effective, 
as it has higher costs than routine surveillance at the WTP thresholds. 
Reasonable dose reduction according to the patient's actual situation or 
lowering the price of niraparib can improve its cost-effectiveness.

OBJECTIVES: Relmacabtagene autoleucel (relma-cel) was recently approved in China 
for treating relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma (r/r LBCL). We 
conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis from the perspective of Chinese 
healthcare system.
METHODS: A mixture-cure model was developed to project life-years (LYs), 
quality-adjusted LYs (QALYs), and overall direct cost with a lifetime horizon 
for patients with r/r LBCL treated with relma-cel versus salvage chemotherapy. 
Patient-level data from RELIANCE trial and published data from Collaborative 
Trial in Relapsed Aggressive Lymphoma extension study were used to inform the 
model. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was estimated and 
cost-effectiveness was evaluated at the willingness-to-pay threshold of 3 times 
the national gross domestic product per capita.
RESULTS: The model projected that treatment with relma-cel was associated with 
incremental gains of 5.11 LYs and 5.26 QALYs compared with salvage chemotherapy 
at an increased cost of ¥1 067 430 (∼$154 152), resulting in an ICER of ¥203 137 
(∼$29 435) per QALY. The model was most sensitive to the uncertainty around the 
estimated cure rate. The ICER of relma-cel was within the willingness-to-pay 
threshold in the base case and the probability of relma-cel treatment being 
considered cost-effective was approximately 74%.
CONCLUSIONS: Compared with salvage chemotherapy, treatment with relma-cel for 
r/r LBCL in patients who have failed at least 2 lines of systemic therapy is 
within the cost-effective range from the perspective of Chinese healthcare 
system and represents a good use of healthcare resources.

BACKGROUND: Valbenazine is a highly selective vesicular monoamine transporter 2 
(VMAT2) inhibitor approved for treatment of tardive dyskinesia. To address the 
ongoing need for improved symptomatic treatments for individuals with 
Huntington's disease, valbenazine was evaluated for the treatment of chorea 
associated with Huntington's disease.
METHODS: KINECT-HD (NCT04102579) was a phase 3, randomised, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled trial, performed in 46 Huntington Study Group sites in the 
USA and Canada. The study included adults with genetically confirmed 
Huntington's disease and chorea (Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale 
[UHDRS] Total Maximal Chorea [TMC] score of 8 or higher) who were randomly 
assigned (1:1) via an interactive web response system (with no stratification or 
minimisation) to oral placebo or valbenazine (≤80 mg, as tolerated) for 12 weeks 
of double-blinded treatment. The primary endpoint was a least-squares mean 
change in UHDRS TMC score from the screening and baseline period (based on the 
average of screening and baseline values for each participant) to the 
maintenance period (based on the average of week 10 and 12 values for each 
participant) in the full-analysis set using a mixed-effects model for repeated 
measures. Safety assessments included treatment-emergent adverse events, vital 
signs, electrocardiograms, laboratory tests, clinical tests for parkinsonism, 
and psychiatric assessments. The double-blind placebo-controlled period of 
KINECT-HD has been completed, and an open-label extension period is ongoing.
FINDINGS: KINECT-HD was performed from Nov 13, 2019, to Oct 26, 2021. Of 128 
randomly assigned participants, 125 were included in the full-analysis set (64 
assigned to valbenazine, 61 assigned to placebo) and 127 were included in the 
safety-analysis set (64 assigned to valbenazine, 63 assigned to placebo). The 
full-analysis set included 68 women and 57 men. Least-squares mean changes from 
the screening and baseline period to the maintenance period in the UHDRS TMC 
score were -4·6 for valbenazine and -1·4 for placebo (least-squares mean 
difference -3·2, 95% CI -4·4 to -2·0; p<0·0001). The most commonly reported 
treatment-emergent adverse event was somnolence (ten [16%] with valbenazine, two 
[3%] with placebo). Serious treatment-emergent adverse events were reported in 
two participants in the placebo group (colon cancer and psychosis) and one 
participant in the valbenazine group (angioedema because of allergic reaction to 
shellfish). No clinically important ch anges in vital signs, electrocardiograms, 
or laboratory tests were found. No suicidal behaviour or worsening of suicidal 
ideation was reported in participants treated with valbenazine.
INTERPRETATION: In individuals with Huntington's disease, valbenazine resulted 
in improvement in chorea compared with placebo and was well tolerated. Continued 
research is needed to confirm the long-term safety and effectiveness of this 
medication throughout the disease course in individuals with Huntington's 
disease-related chorea.

Mice thermoneutral zone lies at temperatures much higher than expected when 
considering the geographical extension of the species. Growing evidence shows 
that mouse-dependent thermogenesis experimentation needs to cope with 
temperatures below those at which the animals are most comfortable. The 
associated physiological changes interfere with experimental results, thereby 
highlighting the apparently trivial subject of room-temperature. Working at 
above 25 °C is difficult for researchers and animal care technicians. Herein, we 
explore alternative solutions related to living habits of wild mice that could 
improve translation of research on mice to humans. Standard murine environments 
are often colder than those in laboratory facilities and their behavior is 
mainly characterized by a gregarious, nesting and exploratory way of life. 
Optimization of their thermal environment can thus also be achieved by avoiding 
individual housing and providing high-quality nesting material and devices that 
would allow locomotor activity, hence muscle thermogenesis. These options have 
additional relevance in terms of animal welfare. When precise monitoring of the 
temperature is required, temperature-controlled cabinets can be used for the 
duration of the experiments. During the manipulation of mice, a heated laminar 
flow hood or tray could create an optimized microenvironment. The specification 
of temperature-related data in publications should contain information on the 
translatability of the described mouse models to humans. Furthermore, 
publications should describe the premises of the laboratory in relation to 
housing possibilities and murine behavior.

OBJECTIVES: The US Preventive Services Task Force lowered the recommended 
starting age for colorectal cancer (CRC) screening in average-risk adults from 
50 to 45 years. We aimed to estimate the global burden and trends of colorectal 
cancer in adults aged 20-49 years (early-onset CRC).
METHODS: This is an analysis of the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and 
Risk Factors Study 2019 (GBD 2019). The GBD 2019 estimation methods were used to 
describe the incidence, mortality, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) of 
early CRC from 1990 to 2019. Data from 204 countries and geographic areas were 
available.
RESULTS: The global incidence rate of early-onset CRC increased from 4.2/100 000 
to 6.7/100 000 from 1990 to 2019. Mortality and DALYs of early-onset CRC also 
increased. The CRC incidence rate increased faster in younger adults (1.6%) than 
in adults aged 50-74 years (0.6%) as measured by the annual percentage change. 
The increase in early-onset CRC incidence was consistently observed in all five 
socio-demographic index (SDI) regions and 190 out of 204 countries and 
territories. Middle and high-middle SDI regions had faster annual increases in 
early-onset CRC, which warrants further attention.
CONCLUSIONS: The global incidence, mortality, and DALYs of early-onset CRC 
increased from 1990 to 2019. The increase in early-onset CRC incidence was 
prevalent worldwide. Several countries were found to have higher incidence rates 
than the United States or fast increase in early-onset CRC, which warrants 
further attention.

BACKGROUND: Demand for donor kidneys outstrips supply. Using kidneys from 
selected donors with an increased risk of blood-borne virus (BBV) transmission 
(hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus [HCV], human immunodeficiency virus) 
may expand the donor pool, but cost-effectiveness of this strategy is uncertain.
METHODS: A Markov model was developed using real-world evidence to compare 
healthcare costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) of accepting kidneys 
from deceased donors with potential increased risk of BBV transmission, because 
of increased risk behaviors and/or history of HCV, versus declining these 
kidneys. Model simulations were run over a 20-y time horizon. Parameter 
uncertainty was assessed through deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity 
analyses.
RESULTS: Accepting kidneys from donors at increased risk of BBVs (2% from donors 
with increased-risk behaviors and 5% from donors with active or past HCV 
infection) incurred total costs of 311 303 Australian dollars with a gain of 
8.53 QALYs. Foregoing kidneys from these donors incurred total costs of $330 517 
and a gain of 8.44 QALYs. A cost-saving of $19 214 and additional 0.09 QALYs 
(~33 d in full health) per person would be generated compared with declining 
these donors. Increasing the availability of kidneys with increased risk by 15% 
led to further cost-savings of $57 425 and additional 0.23 QALY gains (~84 d in 
full health). Probabilistic sensitivity analysis using 10 000 iterations showed 
accepting kidneys from donors at increased risk led to lower costs and higher 
QALY gains.
CONCLUSIONS: Shifting clinical practice to accept increased BBV risk donors 
would likely produce lower costs and higher QALYs for health systems.

The mature mammalian brain connectome emerges during development via the 
extension and pruning of neuronal connections. Glial cells have been identified 
as key players in the phagocytic elimination of neuronal synapses and 
projections. Recently, phosphatidylserine has been identified as neuronal 
"eat-me" signal that guides elimination of unnecessary input sources, but the 
associated transduction systems involved in such pruning are yet to be 
described. Here, we identified Xk-related protein 8 (Xkr8), a phospholipid 
scramblase, as a key factor for the pruning of axons in the developing mammalian 
brain. We found that mouse Xkr8 is highly expressed immediately after birth and 
required for phosphatidylserine exposure in the hippocampus. Mice lacking Xkr8 
showed excess excitatory nerve terminals, increased density of cortico-cortical 
and cortico-spinal projections, aberrant electrophysiological profiles of 
hippocampal neurons, and global brain hyperconnectivity. These data identify 
phospholipid scrambling by Xkr8 as a central process in the labeling and 
discrimination of developing neuronal projections for pruning in the mammalian 
brain.

Diabetes and prediabetes in children with cystic fibrosis.

Schiaffini R(1), Pampanini V.

Author information:
(1)Endocrine and Diabetes Unit - Bambino Gesù Childrens' Hospital, Rome, Italy.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Glucose metabolism alterations in cystic fibrosis range from 
the classic cystic fibrosis-related diabetes (CFRD) to forms of glucose 
intolerance and prediabetes. The aim of the present work is to review the most 
up-to-date novelties in terms of CFRD diagnosis and therapy. This review is 
timely and relevant because it allows an update for the early and correct 
classification of glucose abnormalities in cystic fibrosis and because it 
favours an appropriate therapeutic approach.
RECENT FINDINGS: Confirm that Oral Glucose Tolerance Test is still the 
diagnostic gold standard despite the advent of continuous glucose monitoring 
(CGM) systems; this latter is spreading very rapidly, however, to date, there is 
still no strong evidence to hypothesize the use of CGM for diagnostic purposes. 
CGM has indeed proven to be very useful in managing and guiding CFRD therapy.
SUMMARY: Tailored and personalized insulin therapy is still the recommended 
therapy for children and adolescents with CFRD, although nutritional 
intervention and oral hypoglycaemic treatment are equally important and 
efficacious. Finally CFTR modulators have allowed the increase of the life 
expectancy of cystic fibrosis patients and have proven effective not only in 
improving the pulmonary function and the nutritional status but also the glucose 
control.

Device profile of the Orchid safety release valve for the prevention of 
accidental catheter dislodgement.

INTRODUCTION: More than 4 out of 5 patients in acute care require intravenous 
catheters. Complications of catheter dislodgement and failure are commonly 
reported at rates of 15-69% causing interrupted treatment and greater resource 
consumption when catheter replacement is required.
AREAS COVERED: This manuscript outlines unmet needs in the prevention of 
catheter dislodgement and how a novel safety release device (Orchid SRV™, Linear 
Health Sciences) might address these gaps based on available evidence.
EXPERT OPINION: Healthcare initiatives focus on reducing complications and 
associated costs with the delivery of intravenous treatments. Tension-activated 
safety release valve devices, attached to intravenous tubing, are a new feature 
that adds a level of safety to intravenous catheters to reduce mechanical 
catheter dislodgement when a pull force of greater than 3 pounds is applied. 
Incorporating a tension-activated accessory into and between existing 
intravenous tubing and the catheter and extension set protects the catheter from 
dislodgement. Flow continues until excessive pull force separates and closes the 
flow pathway in both directions, while the SRV provides a quick replacement to 
reestablish flow. The safety release valve is used to prevent accidental 
catheter dislodgement, limit tubing contamination, and avoid more serious 
complications while maintaining a functional catheter.

Plain Language Summary: It is common for intravenous treatment to be disrupted 
due to accidental dislodgement of the catheter. Once this happens, the catheter 
must be replaced. This dislodgement may cause patient discomfort, loss of 
intravenous access to treatment, increase the chance of catheter failure due to 
blockage, and increase the risk of life-threatening infection. A new tension 
release device, the Orchid SRV, is designed to increase patient safety with a 
release valve, activated with any pulling force on the connected tubing, to 
prevent dislodgement and complications associated with catheter failure.

BACKGROUND: Undiagnosed Type 2 diabetes (T2D) has been associated with advanced 
stage cancer at diagnosis, higher mortality, and lower long-term all-cause 
survival. This was a RCT pilot study to examine the feasibility of a nurse-led 
T2D intervention for adults with newly diagnosed cancer (≤3 months), and T2D, 
undiagnosed or untreated with medication, conducted at an outpatient oncology 
clinic affiliated with a large academic institution.
METHODS: Participants needed to meet the eligibility criteria including a HbA1c 
level between 6.5% and 9.9%. Randomization was 1:1 to a 3-month intervention 
that consisted of nursing-led diabetes education and immediate initiation of 
metformin versus referral to primary care for usual care (control).
RESULTS: Three hundred and seventy nine patients were screened using EHR, 55 
agreed to participate, and 3 had eligible HbA1c levels and were randomized in 
the study. Primary reasons for study exclusion included life expectancy ≤2 years 
(16.9%), current use or inability to tolerate metformin (14.8%), and abnormal 
labs that contraindicated metformin use (13.9%).
CONCLUSION: This study was not feasible due to recruitment inefficiencies, but 
acceptable to all who qualified.

Hair is a natural polymeric composite primarily composed of tight macrobundles 
of keratin proteins, which are highly responsive to external stimuli, similarly 
to the hydrogels and other natural fibrous gel systems like collagen and 
fibrin.Hair and its appearance play a significant role in human society. As a 
highly complex biocomposite system, it has been traditionally challenging to 
characterize and thus develop personal care products. Over the last few decades, 
a significant societal paradigm shift occurred among those with curly hair, 
accepting the natural morphological shape of their curls and styling their hair 
according to its innate, distinct, and unique material properties, which has 
given rise to the development of new hair classification systems, beyond the 
traditional and highly limited race-based distinction (Caucasian, Mongolian, and 
African). L'Oréal developed a hair typing taxonomy based on quantitative 
geometric parameters among the four key patterns─straight, wavy, curly, and 
kinky, but it fails to capture the complex diversity of curly and kinky hair. 
Acclaimed celebrity hair stylist Andre Walker developed a classification system 
that is the existing gold standard for classifying curly and kinky hair, but it 
relies upon qualitative classification measures, making the system vague and 
ambiguous of phenotypic differences. The goal of this research is to use 
quantitative methods to identify new geometric parameters more representative of 
curly and kinky hair curl patterns, therefore providing more information on the 
kinds of personal care products that will resonate best with them and thus 
maximize desired appearance and health, and to correlate these new parameters 
with its mechanical properties. This was accomplished by identifying new 
geometric and mechanical parameters from several types of human hair 
samples.Geometric properties were measured using scanning electron microscopy 
(SEM), photogrammetry, and optical microscopy. Mechanical properties were 
measured under tensile extension using a texture analyzer (TA) and a dynamic 
mechanical analyzer (DMA), which bears similarity to the common act of brushing 
or combing. Both instruments measure force as a function of applied 
displacement, thus allowing the relationship between stress and applied stretch 
ratio to be measured as a hair strand uncurls and stretches to the point of 
fracture. From the resulting data, correlations were made between fiber geometry 
and mechanical performance. This data will be used to draw more conclusions on 
the contribution that fiber morphology has on hair fiber mechanics and will 
promote cultural inclusion among researchers and consumers possessing curly and 
kinky hair.

People with severe mental illness (SMI) have a shorter life expectancy than the 
rest of the population. Multimorbidity and poorer physical health contribute to 
this health inequality. Cardiometabolic multimorbidity confers a significant 
mortality risk in this population. Multimorbidity is not restricted to older 
people and people with SMI present with multimorbidity earlier in life. Despite 
this, most screening, prevention and treatment strategies target older people. 
People under 40 years with SMI are underserved by current guidelines for 
cardiovascular risk assessment and reduction. Research is needed to develop and 
implement interventions to reduce cardiometabolic risk in this population.

BACKGROUND: Decompensated cirrhosis patients have a high risk of death which can 
be considerably reduced with liver transplantation (LT). This study aimed to 
simultaneously investigate the effect of some patients' characteristics on 
mortality among those with/without LT and also LT incident.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this historical cohort study, the information from 780 
eligible patients aged 18 years or older was analyzed by the Markov multistate 
model; they had been listed between 2008 and 2014, needed a single organ for 
initial orthotopic LT, and followed at least for up to 5 years.
RESULTS: With a median survival time of 6 (5-8) years, there were 275 (35%) 
deaths. From 255 (33%) patients who had LT, 55 (21%) subsequently died. Factors 
associated with a higher risk of mortality and LT occurrence were included: 
higher model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.16, 
confidence interval [CI]: 1.09-1.24 and HR = 1.22, CI: 1.41-1.30) and ascites 
complication (HR = 2.34, CI: 1.74-3.16 and HR = 11.43, CI: 8.64-15.12). Older 
age (HR = 1.03, CI: 1.01-1.06), higher creatinine (HR = 6.87, CI: 1.45-32.56), 
and autoimmune disease versus hepatitis (HR = 2.53, CI: 1.12-5.73) were 
associated with increased risk of mortality after LT.
CONCLUSION: The MELD and ascites are influential factors on waiting list 
mortality and occurrence of LT. Total life expectancy is not influenced by 
higher MELD.

OBJECTIVES: We aimed to test early feasibility, acceptability, and signals of 
improvement after the 8-week individually delivered asynchronous, web-based 
mind-body program (NF-Web) modeled after the synchronous group-based live video 
program (Relaxation Response Resiliency Program for NF; 3RP-NF).
METHODS: Two cohorts (cohort 1 n = 14, cohort 2 n = 14) completed baseline and
