group was hypertensive diabetic patients at the beginning of the cohort, and the 
non-exposed group had hypertension without diabetes. The cohort began in 2004, 
with follow-ups in 2009 and 2015. Variables used: gender, race, age, physical 
activity, alcohol consumption, smoking, blood pressure, body mass index, 
glycated hemoglobin, diabetes and hypertension diagnosis times, treatment time 
in specialized service, non-fatal cardiovascular outcomes, and renal impairment 
assessed by creatinine clearance.
RESULTS: 139 patients participated in the study (55 diabetic hypertensive; 84 
non-diabetic hypertensive), with an initial (2004) mean hypertension treatment 
time of 5.8 years. Females were the majority (75.5%) in both groups. Groups were 
similar regarding socio-demographic variables, but the group of hypertensive 
diabetic patients had higher frequency of obesity and uncontrolled BP, which 
persisted in all follow-ups. In 11 years of follow-up (2004-2015), the diabetic 
group had more cardiovascular events, with increased risk of acute myocardial 
infarction (RR 95% CI 1.6 12.2-95.0), stroke (RR 95% CI 1.3-6.1 27.7) and 
complications requiring hospitalization (RR 95% CI 1.6 2.2-3.0). Worsened renal 
function occurred more often in the non-exposed group, but in the end, the 
proportion of renal function loss was similar between groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to type 2 diabetes increased the risk of new 
cardiovascular outcomes over 11 years of follow-up of hypertensive patients. 
Diabetes by itself increased the risk of cardiovascular outcomes, justifying 
more intensive actions in this population.

BACKGROUND: Targeting low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) for lung cancer 
screening to persons at highest risk for lung cancer mortality has been 
suggested to improve screening efficiency.
OBJECTIVE: To quantify the value of risk-targeted selection for lung cancer 
screening compared with National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) eligibility 
criteria.
DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis using a multistate prediction model.
DATA SOURCES: NLST.
TARGET POPULATION: Current and former smokers eligible for lung cancer 
screening.
TIME HORIZON: Lifetime.
PERSPECTIVE: Health care sector.
INTERVENTION: Risk-targeted versus NLST-based screening.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Incremental 7-year mortality, life expectancy, 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), costs, and cost-effectiveness of screening 
with LDCT versus chest radiography at each decile of lung cancer mortality risk.
RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: Participants at greater risk for lung cancer 
mortality were older and had more comorbid conditions and higher 
screening-related costs. The incremental lung cancer mortality benefits during 
the first 7 years ranged from 1.2 to 9.5 lung cancer deaths prevented per 10 000 
person-years for the lowest to highest risk deciles, respectively (extreme 
decile ratio, 7.9). The gradient of benefits across risk groups, however, was 
attenuated in terms of life-years (extreme decile ratio, 3.6) and QALYs (extreme 
decile ratio, 2.4). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were 
similar across risk deciles ($75 000 per QALY in the lowest risk decile to 
$53 000 per QALY in the highest risk decile). Payers willing to pay $100 000 per 
QALY would pay for LDCT screening for all decile groups.
RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: Alternative assumptions did not substantially 
alter our findings.
LIMITATION: Our model did not account for all correlated differences between 
lung cancer mortality risk and quality of life.
CONCLUSIONS: Although risk targeting may improve screening efficiency in terms 
of early lung cancer mortality per person screened, the gains in efficiency are 
attenuated and modest in terms of life-years, QALYs, and cost-effectiveness.

This study aimed to investigate the efficacy of home-based, light gymnastic 
exercise plus dietary milk fat globule membrane (MFGM) intake on physical 
fitness of an elderly Japanese sample in a pilot, double-blind, randomized, 
placebo-controlled trial. Seventy-one subjects (male, n = 13; female, n = 58) 
were randomly assigned into two groups: placebo (n = 35 [male, n = 6; female, 
n = 29]) and MFGM group (n = 36 [male, n = 7; female, n = 29]). The intervention 
was eight weeks. Subjects ingested either MFGM (1 g/day) or placebo tablets 
daily and engaged in an exercise program daily. Physical function tests were 
performed at baseline and after four and eight weeks. Foot tapping and 
open-close stepping scores significantly increased from baseline to eight weeks 
in the MFGM group. Study results suggest daily MFGM ingestion might further 
enhance the effects of light-intensity exercise in healthy elderly people.

BACKGROUND: Gray whale, Eschrichtius robustus (E. robustus), is a single member 
of the family Eschrichtiidae, which is considered to be the most primitive in 
the class Cetacea. Gray whale is often described as a "living fossil". It is 
adapted to extreme marine conditions and has a high life expectancy (77 years). 
The assembly of a gray whale genome and transcriptome will allow to carry out 
further studies of whale evolution, longevity, and resistance to extreme 
environment.
RESULTS: In this work, we report the first de novo assembly and primary analysis 
of the E. robustus genome and transcriptome based on kidney and liver samples. 
The presented draft genome assembly is complete by 55% in terms of a total 
genome length, but only by 24% in terms of the BUSCO complete gene groups, 
although 10,895 genes were identified. Transcriptome annotation and comparison 
with other whale species revealed robust expression of DNA repair and 
hypoxia-response genes, which is expected for whales.
CONCLUSIONS: This preliminary study of the gray whale genome and transcriptome 
provides new data to better understand the whale evolution and the mechanisms of 
their adaptation to the hypoxic conditions.

Given a better quality of life and extended life expectancy in patients with 
immune suppression, the number of immunocompromised travellers is constantly 
growing. The aim of the article is to discuss travel-related health problems in 
immunocompromised patients, their most common destinations and reasons to 
travel, as well as complications associated with travel to regions with harsh 
environmental conditions. The article focuses on selected groups of 
immunocompromised travellers (ICTs), i.e., cancer patients, transplant patients 
receiving immunosuppressant agents, splenectomised patients and HIV-infected 
individuals. The most common infections and complications, including traveller's 
diarrhoea, vector-borne diseases (yellow fever, malaria, leishmaniasis, dengue, 
chikungunya), respiratory infections (including tuberculosis), and dermatoses 
were taken into account. Preventive measures dedicated to ICTs (pre-travel 
consultation, vaccinations, malaria chemoprophylaxis, prevention during 
travelling) have been also characterised.

BACKGROUND: We examined long-term outcomes across the domains of the 
International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health for 2 groups 
of participants with cerebral palsy who demonstrated crouch gait at clinical 
gait analysis. One group underwent a distal femoral extension osteotomy with 
patellar tendon advancement (DFEO + PTA). The other group received other 
treatments (non-DFEO + PTA).
METHODS: Fifty-one participants returned for a long-term gait analysis, physical 
examination, energy consumption test, knee radiographs, and questionnaires 
(median, 13 years post-DFEO + PTA or post-baseline [range, 8 to 21 years]). A 
subset of participants in the DFEO + PTA group also had a short-term analysis (9 
to 24 months postoperatively).
RESULTS: Participants were reasonably well-matched at baseline, although the 
DFEO + PTA group demonstrated greater crouch: minimum knee flexion, a median of 
37° (width of the interquartile range, 12°) compared with 27° (9°); and knee 
flexion contracture, a median of 15° (10°) compared with 10° (5°). The gait 
deviation index (GDI) and sagittal plane knee kinematics were most improved at 
short term for the DFEO + PTA participants, with a subsequent slight decline at 
long-term analysis. Fewer DFEO + PTA participants were in crouch at long term 
(37% compared with 65%). At the long-term assessment, group scores for function, 
mobility, participation, quality of life, and most pain questionnaires were 
similar. Knee pain and osteoarthritis ratings did not differ between the groups.
CONCLUSIONS: At long-term analysis, DFEO + PTA improves stance phase knee 
extension and knee flexion contracture compared with conventional treatment, but 
these benefits do not translate to improved activity, participation, or knee 
pain in early adulthood.

Biological therapy for moderate-to-severe psoriasis is highly effective but 
cost-intensive. This systematic review aimed at analyzing evidence on the 
cost-effectiveness of biological treatment of moderate-to-severe psoriasis. A 
literature search was conducted until 30/06/2017 in PubMed, Cochrane Library, 
LILACS, and EconLit. The quality of identified studies was assessed with the 
checklist by the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination guidance. Out of 482 
records, 53 publications were eligible for inclusion. Half of the studies met 
between 20 and 25 of the quality checklist items, displaying moderate quality. 
Due to heterogeneity of studies, a qualitative synthesis was conducted. Cost 
ranges per outcome were enormous across different studies due to diversity in 
assumptions and model design. Pairwise comparisons of biologicals revealed 
conflicting results. Overall, adalimumab appeared to be most cost-effective 
(100% of all aggregated pairwise comparisons), followed by ustekinumab (66.7%), 
and infliximab (60%). However, in study conclusions most recent publications 
favored secukinumab and apremilast (75% and 60% of the studies investigating 
these medications). Accepted willingness-to-pay thresholds varied between 30,000 
and 50,000 USD/Quality-Adjusted Life Year (QALY). Three-quarters of studies were 
financially supported, and in 90% of those, results were consistent with the 
funder's interest. Economic evaluation of biologicals is crucial for responsible 
allocation of health care resources. In addition to summarizing the actual 
evidence this review highlights gaps and needs for future research.

Prevalence and Trends in Morbidity and Disability Among Older Mexican Americans 
in the Southwestern United States, 1993-2013.

This study examines the prevalence of morbidity and disability among older 
Mexican Americans using 5-year age groups. Twenty-year panel data from the 
Hispanic Established Populations for the Epidemiological Study of the Elderly 
are used to make detailed comparisons by nativity and gender. Results show that 
prevalence rates for most chronic conditions for both males and females do not 
vary by nativity. For disabilities, nativity is a significant predictor of 
increased instrumental activity of daily living disability for foreign-born 
females and reduced activity of daily living disability for U.S.-born males. 
Additionally, results show significant interactions between nativity and age 
cohorts, with the gap increasing with age for males and decreasing with age for 
females. These results have important implications for health services and 
health policy. Given the rapid aging of the Mexican American population, the 
prevention and treatment of medical conditions, particularly among the 
foreign-born, should be a major public health priority to reduce dependence from 
disabilities.

Multiple-frequency bioimpedance devices for fluid management in people with 
chronic kidney disease receiving dialysis: a systematic review and economic 
evaluation.

BACKGROUND: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a long-term condition requiring 
treatment such as conservative management, kidney transplantation or dialysis. 
To optimise the volume of fluid removed during dialysis (to avoid underhydration 
or overhydration), people are assigned a 'target weight', which is commonly 
assessed using clinical methods, such as weight gain between dialysis sessions, 
pre- and post-dialysis blood pressure and patient-reported symptoms. However, 
these methods are not precise, and measurement devices based on bioimpedance 
technology are increasingly used in dialysis centres. Current evidence on the 
role of bioimpedance devices for fluid management in people with CKD receiving 
dialysis is limited.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of 
multiple-frequency bioimpedance devices versus standard clinical assessment for 
fluid management in people with CKD receiving dialysis.
DATA SOURCES: We searched major electronic databases [e.g. MEDLINE, MEDLINE 
In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, EMBASE, Science Citation Index and 
Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)] conference abstracts 
and ongoing studies. There were no date restrictions. Searches were undertaken 
between June and October 2016.
REVIEW METHODS: Evidence was considered from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) 
comparing fluid management by multiple-frequency bioimpedance devices and 
standard clinical assessment in people receiving dialysis, and non-randomised 
studies evaluating the use of the devices for fluid management in people 
receiving dialysis. One reviewer extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of 
included studies. A second reviewer cross-checked the extracted data. Standard 
meta-analyses techniques were used to combine results from included studies. A 
Markov model was developed to assess the cost-effectiveness of the 
interventions.
RESULTS: Five RCTs (with 904 adult participants) and eight non-randomised 
studies (with 4915 adult participants) assessing the use of the Body Composition 
Monitor [(BCM) Fresenius Medical Care, Bad Homburg vor der Höhe, Germany] were 
included. Both absolute overhydration and relative overhydration were 
significantly lower in patients evaluated using BCM measurements than for those 
evaluated using standard clinical methods [weighted mean difference -0.44, 95% 
confidence interval (CI) -0.72 to -0.15, p = 0.003, I2 = 49%; and weighted mean 
difference -1.84, 95% CI -3.65 to -0.03; p = 0.05, I2 = 52%, respectively]. 
Pooled effects of bioimpedance monitoring on systolic blood pressure (SBP) (mean 
difference -2.46 mmHg, 95% CI -5.07 to 0.15 mmHg; p = 0.06, I2 = 0%), arterial 
stiffness (mean difference -1.18, 95% CI -3.14 to 0.78; p = 0.24, I2 = 92%) and 
mortality (hazard ratio = 0.689, 95% CI 0.23 to 2.08; p = 0.51) were not 
statistically significant. The economic evaluation showed that, when dialysis 
costs were included in the model, the probability of bioimpedance monitoring 
being cost-effective ranged from 13% to 26% at a willingness-to-pay threshold of 
£20,000 per quality-adjusted life-year gained. With dialysis costs excluded, the 
corresponding probabilities of cost-effectiveness ranged from 61% to 67%.
LIMITATIONS: Lack of evidence on clinically relevant outcomes, children 
receiving dialysis, and any multifrequency bioimpedance devices, other than the 
BCM.
CONCLUSIONS: BCM used in addition to clinical assessment may lower overhydration 
and potentially improve intermediate outcomes, such as SBP, but effects on 
mortality have not been demonstrated. If dialysis costs are not considered, the 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio falls below £20,000, with modest effects on 
mortality and/or hospitalisation rates. The current findings are not 
generalisable to paediatric populations nor across other multifrequency 
bioimpedance devices.
FUTURE WORK: Services that routinely use the BCM should report clinically 
relevant intermediate and long-term outcomes before and after introduction of 
the device to extend the current evidence base.

Between 'Pioneers' of the Cardiovascular Revolution and Its 'Late Followers': 
Mortality Changes in the Czech Republic and Poland Since 1968.

After several decades of stagnation, mortality in most Central European 
countries started to decrease after 1989. The Czech Republic and Poland were the 
first former Communist countries in this region to experience a rapid and 
sustained increase in life expectancy. This study focuses on the trends in 
cause-of-death mortality that have contributed to the recent progress in these 
two countries. The analysis is based on the cause-of-death time series 
(1968-2013) reconstructed in accordance with the 10th ICD revision, which makes 
the data fully comparable over the full period under study. Actual trends in 
cause-specific mortality are presented, and age, sex and causes of death 
components of life expectancy changes are disentangled. In both countries, the 
reduction in cardiovascular mortality at adult and old ages was crucial for the 
increase in life expectancy after 1991. Results are discussed in the context of 
institutional changes that occurred after the fall of Communism, such as the 
reorientation of health policies and the emergence of non-governmental 
organizations. Changes in health-related attitudes and behaviours as well as 
structural changes in societies, notably the rising share of persons with 
tertiary education, are also discussed.

After several decades of negative trends and short-term fluctuations, life 
expectancy has been increasing in Russia since 2004. Between 2003 and 2014, the 
length of life rose by 6.6 years among males and by 4.6 years among females. 
While positive trends in life expectancy are observed in all regions of Russia, 
these trends are unfolding differently in different regions. First, regions 
entered the phase of life expectancy growth at different points in time. Second, 
the age- and cause-specific components of the gains in life expectancy and the 
number of years added vary noticeably. In this paper, we apply decomposition 
techniques-specifically, the stepwise replacement algorithm-to examine the age- 
and cause-specific components of the changes in inter-regional disparities 
during the current period of health improvement. The absolute inter-regional 
disparities in length of life, measured by the population-weighted standard 
deviation, decreased slightly between 2003 and 2014, from 3.3 to 3.2 years for 
males, and from 2.0 to 1.8 years for females. The decomposition of these small 
changes by ages and causes of death shows that these shifts were the result of 
diverse effects of mortality convergence at young and middle ages, and of 
mortality divergence at older ages. With respect to causes of death, the 
convergence is mainly attributable to external causes, while the inter-regional 
divergence of trends is largely determined by cardiovascular diseases. The two 
major cities, Moscow and Saint Petersburg, are currently pioneering mortality 
improvements in Russia and are making the largest contributions to the 
inter-regional divergence.

PURPOSE: To assess how trends in urinary diversion (UD) type following radical 
cystectomy (RC) have changed in recent years and investigate pre-operative 
predictors of UD type.
METHODS: Data were abstracted from the American College of Surgeons National 
Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS NSQIP) from 2011 to 2015. We 
quantified the percentages of continent diversions (CD) versus incontinent 
diversions (ID) completed over this time frame. Using univariate and 
multivariable logistic regression analyses, we compared UD type across year of 
operation as well as predictors of type of diversion.
RESULTS: We identified 4790 patients in the cohort, of which 81% underwent an 
incontinent diversion. Patients undergoing incontinent diversions were older 
(p < 0.001), more likely to be female (p < 0.001), had higher American Society 
of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classification (p < 0.001) and had more comorbidities 
with worse preoperative lab values. On multivariable analysis, the odds of 
incontinent diversion increased per year (OR 1.16, 95% CI 1.06-1.26; p = 0.001). 
Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) was associated with lower odds of receiving an ID 
(OR 0.33, 95% CI 0.17-0.64; p = 0.001). Being male, healthy and young were 
associated with higher odds of CD.
CONCLUSION: We demonstrate that there has been a decrease in continent diversion 
use in recent years. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy, proxies of life expectancy and 
gender are significant predictors of continent diversion. Further investigation 
to determine the underlying cause of decreased utilization of CD is warranted.

AIMS: We quantified the impact of type 2 diabetes on incidence of non-fatal 
cardiovascular disease (CVD) and mortality, considering CVD as a continuum from 
occurrence of diabetes to the end point, and estimated the 15-year life 
expectancy with and without CVD.
METHODS: A total of 7239 Iranian adults (3246 men), aged ≥ 30 years, were 
followed from 1999 to 2014. We applied a multi-state semi-Markov model with 
three transitions including CVD-free to non-fatal CVD, CVD-free to death and 
non-fatal CVD to death, and studied the influence of diabetes on each transition 
rate, stratifying by sex and adjusting for confounders.
RESULTS: Diabetes was significantly associated with increased risk of non-fatal 
CVD in men [hazard ratio, 1.70 (1.36-3.53)] and women [2.19 (1.74-2.77)], and of 
all-cause death [2.72 (2.03-3.63) and 1.92 (1.37-2.67) in men and women, 
respectively]. An increased risk of mortality was found only among diabetic men, 
when non-fatal CVD was occurred [2.19 (1.36-3.53)]. Men with diabetes 
experienced first non-fatal CVD and death without CVD 1.7 and 1.4 years, 
respectively, earlier than those without diabetes; the corresponding values were 
1.4 and 0.7 years for women. Moreover, diabetic men lived 1.3 years less than 
non-diabetic counterparts when non-fatal CVD was occurred.
CONCLUSIONS: Diabetes increased the risk of non-fatal CVD events and all-cause 
mortality and consequently decreased the number of years lived without CVD. A 
decrease in LE was found only among diabetic men compared to non-diabetics after 
non-fatal CVD occurred.

PURPOSE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of BRCA testing in women with breast 
cancer, and cascade testing in family members of BRCA mutation carriers.
METHODS: A cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted using a cohort Markov model 
from a health-payer perspective. The model estimated the long-term benefits and 
costs of testing women with breast cancer who had at least a 10% pretest BRCA 
mutation probability, and the cascade testing of first- and second-degree 
relatives of women who test positive.
RESULTS: Compared with no testing, BRCA testing of affected women resulted in an 
incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained of AU$18,900 
(incremental cost AU$1,880; incremental QALY gain 0.10) with reductions of 0.04 
breast and 0.01 ovarian cancer events. Testing affected women and cascade 
testing of family members resulted in an incremental cost per QALY gained of 
AU$9,500 compared with testing affected women only (incremental cost AU$665; 
incremental QALY gain 0.07) with additional reductions of 0.06 breast and 0.01 
ovarian cancer events.
CONCLUSION: BRCA testing in women with breast cancer is cost-effective and is 
associated with reduced risk of cancer and improved survival. Extending testing 
to cover family members of affected women who test positive improves 
cost-effectiveness beyond restricting testing to affected women only.

OBJECTIVES: We assess how different scenarios of cardiovascular disease (CVD) 
prevention, aimed at meeting targets set by the World Health Organization (WHO) 
for 2025), may impact healthcare spending in Quebec, Canada over the 2050 
horizon.
METHODS: We provide long-term forecasts of healthcare use and costs at the 
Quebec population level using a novel dynamic microsimulation model. Using both 
survey and administrative data, we simulate the evolution of the Quebec 
population's health status until death, through a series of dynamic transitions 
that accounts for social and demographic characteristics associated with CVD 
risk factors.
RESULTS: A 25% reduction in CVD mortality between 2012 and 2025 achieved through 
decreased incidence could contain the pace of healthcare cost growth towards 
2050 by nearly 7 percentage points for consultations with a physician, and by 
almost 9 percentage points for hospitalizations. Over the 2012-2050 period, the 
present value of cost savings is projected to amount to C$13.1 billion in 2012 
dollars. The years of life saved due to improved life expectancy could be worth 
another C$38.2 billion. Addressing CVD mortality directly instead would bring 
about higher healthcare costs, but would generate more value in terms of years 
of life saved, at C$69.6 billion.
CONCLUSIONS: Potential savings associated with plausible reductions in CVD, 
aimed at reaching a World Health Organization target over a 12-year period, are 
sizeable and may help address challenges associated with an aging population.

Cold plasma (CP) technology has proven very effective as an alternative tool for 
food decontamination and shelf-life extension. The impact of CP on food quality 
is very crucial for its acceptance as an alternative food processing technology. 
Due to the non-thermal nature, CP treatments have shown no or minimal impacts on 
the physical, chemical, nutritional and sensory attributes of various products. 
This review also discusses the negative impacts and limitations posed by CP 
technology for food products. The limited studies on interactions of CP species 
with food components at the molecular level offers future research 
opportunities. It also highlights the need for optimization studies to mitigate 
the negative impacts on visual, chemical, nutritional and functional properties 
of food products. The design versatility, non-thermal, economical and 
environmentally friendly nature of CP offers unique advantages over traditional 
processing technologies. However, CP processing is still in its nascent form and 
needs further research to reach its potential.

BACKGROUND: Endometriosis is a common gynecological disorder that causes 
inflammation and pelvic pain. Endometriosis-related pain is best captured with 
patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures, however, assessment of 
endometriosis-related pain in clinical trials has been difficult in the absence 
of a reliable and valid PRO instrument. We describe the development of the 
Endometriosis Pain Daily Diary (EPDD), an electronic PRO developed as a survey 
instrument to assess endometriosis-related pain and its impact on patients' 
lives.
METHODS: The EPDD was initially developed on the basis of an existing 
Endometriosis Pain and Bleeding Diary, a targeted review of relevant literature, 
clinical expert interviews, and open-ended (concept elicitation) patient 
interviews in the United States (US) and Japan which captured patients' 
experience with endometriosis. Cognitive interviews of patients with 
endometriosis were conducted to evaluate patient comprehension of the EPDD 
items. A conceptual model of endometriosis was developed, and meetings with US 
and European regulatory authorities provided feedback for validating the EPDD in 
the context of clinical trials. Translatability assessments of the EPDD were 
conducted to confirm its appropriate interpretation and ease of completion 
across 17 languages.
RESULTS: The iterative development progressed through three versions of the 
instrument. The EPDDv1 included 18 items relating to dysmenorrhea/pelvic pain, 
dyspareunia and sexual activity, bleeding, hot flashes, daily activities, and 
use of rescue medication. The EPDDv2 was a larger 43-item survey tested in 
cognitive interviews and subsequently revised to yield the current 11-item 
EPDDv3, consisting of five core items relating to dysmenorrhea, non-menstrual 
pelvic pain, and dyspareunia, and six extension items relating to sexual 
activity, daily activities, and use of rescue medication.
CONCLUSIONS: The EPDD is a PRO for the evaluation of endometriosis-related pain 
and its associated impacts on patients' lives. The EPDD represents an important 
step in providing a PRO that is relevant to patients with endometriosis-related 
pain in the context of a clinical study setting (ie, fit-for-purpose), designed 
to evaluate pain associated with endometriosis, including regulatory agency 
support for its further exploration in clinical trials.

The burden of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) in high-income 
countries is mostly borne by the elderly. With increasing life expectancy, clear 
guidance on sensible use of statin therapy to prevent a first and potentially 
devastating ASCVD event is critically important to ensure a healthy aging 
population. Since 2013, 5 major North American and European guidelines on statin 
use in primary prevention of ASCVD have been released by the American College of 
Cardiology/American Heart Association, the UK National Institute for Health and 
Care Excellence, the Canadian Cardiovascular Society, U.S. Preventive Services 
Task Force, and the European Society of Cardiology/European Atherosclerosis 
Society. Guidance on using statin therapy in primary ASCVD prevention in 
the growing elderly population (>65 years of age) differs markedly. The authors 
discuss the discrepant recommendations, place them into the context of available 
evidence, and identify circumstances in which uncertainty may hamper 
the appropriate use of statins in the elderly.

All living beings undergo systemic physiological decline after ontogeny, 
characterized as aging. Modern medicine has increased the life expectancy, yet 
this has created an aged society that has more predisposition to degenerative 
disorders. Therefore, novel interventions that aim to extend the healthspan in 
parallel to the life span are needed. Regeneration ability of living beings 
maintains their biological integrity and thus is the major leverage against 
aging. However, mammalian regeneration capacity is low and further declines 
during aging. Therefore, modalities that reinforce regeneration can antagonize 
aging. Recent advances in the field of regenerative medicine have shown that 
aging is not an irreversible process. Conversion of somatic cells to 
embryonic-like pluripotent cells demonstrated that the differentiated state and 
age of a cell is not fixed. Identification of the pluripotency-inducing factors 
subsequently ignited the idea that cellular features can be reprogrammed by 
defined factors that specify the desired outcome. The last decade consequently 
has witnessed a plethora of studies that modify cellular features including the 
hallmarks of aging in addition to cellular function and identity in a variety of 
cell types in vitro. Recently, some of these reprogramming strategies have been 
directly used in animal models in pursuit of rejuvenation and cell replacement. 
Here, we review these in vivo reprogramming efforts and discuss their potential 
use to extend the longevity by complementing or augmenting the regenerative 
capacity.

Improvements in living conditions and increasing life expectancy have combined 
to result in ever older patients being admitted to hospital. In parallel, the 
increasing incidence of cancer, along with the improved efficacy of anti-cancer 
therapies has led to greater needs for intensive care among cancer patients. The 
objectives underpinning the management of cancer patients in the intensive care 
unit (ICU) are to achieve a return to a clinical status that would allow the 
patient to be either, transferred back to the original unit, or discharged from 
the hospital with an acceptable quality of life, and where warranted, pursuit of 
cancer therapy. The relevance of ICU admission should be assessed systematically 
for patients with active cancer. The decision needs to be made taking into 
account the expected benefit for the patient, the life-support therapies that 
are possible with discussion about a care project, and also considering the 
future quality of life and the short and long-term prognosis. Anticipating the 
question of potential ICU admission should help protect the patient against both 
inappropriate refusal of intensive care, and inappropriate admission to the ICU 
that might only lead to unreasonable therapeutic obstinacy. The intensive care 
physician has a major role to play in helping the cancer patient to develop an 
appropriate and flexible healthcare project. Anticipating the question of ICU 
admission in advance, as well as a close alliance between the oncologist and the 
intensive care physician are the two keys to the success of a healthcare project 
focused on the patient.

Proactive care of older people undergoing surgery.

The number of older patients undergoing surgery is increasing due to changing 
demographics, surgical and anaesthetic advances and shifts in patient 
expectations of healthcare. The benefits of surgery in older people are well 
documented and include symptom control and increased life expectancy. However, 
older surgical patients present not only with the index pathology requiring 
surgery but with concurrent age related physiological decline, multimorbidity 
and geriatric syndromes. These additional issues increase the risk of adverse 
postoperative outcome, in particular of postoperative medical and functional 
complications. In recent years, there has been recognition of the need for 
collaborative surgical and geriatric medicine working to address the health care 
needs of the increasingly complex older surgical population. Guidelines have 
been published to support clinicians looking after older surgical patients, 
however, there has been little published on the establishment of such services.
