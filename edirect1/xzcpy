the desired outcomes. Therefore, there is a need for new therapeutic strategies 
focusing on more integrated, personalized and effective approaches. The prospect 
of using neural stem cells (NSC) as regenerative therapies is very promising, 
however several issues still need to be addressed. In particular, the potential 
actions of pharmacological agents used to modulate NSC activity are highly 
relevant. With the ongoing discussion of cannabinoid usage for medical purposes 
and reports drawing attention to the effects of cannabinoids on NSC regulation, 
there is an enormous, and yet, uncovered potential for cannabinoids as treatment 
options for several neurological disorders, specifically when combined with stem 
cell therapy. In this manuscript, we review in detail how cannabinoids act as 
potent regulators of NSC biology and their potential to modulate several 
neurogenic features in the context of pathophysiology.

As the average life expectancy continues to increase, so does the need for 
resorbable materials designed to treat, augment, or replace components and 
functions of the body. Naturally occurring biopolymers such as silks are already 
attractive candidates due to natural abundance and high biocompatibility 
accompanied by physical properties which are easily modulated through blending 
with another polymer. In this paper, the authors report on the fabrication of 
biocomposite materials made from binary blends of Bombyx mori silk fibroin (SF) 
protein and renewably sourced low molecular weight nylon 610 and high molecular 
weight nylon 1010. Films were characterized using scanning electron microscopy 
(SEM), Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, differential scanning 
calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Results of this study 
demonstrated that enhanced structural and thermal properties were achievable in 
composite films SF-N610/N1010 due to their chemical similarity and the possible 
formation of hydrogen bonds between nylon and silk molecular chains. This study 
provides useful insight into the sustainable design of functional composite 
materials for biomedical and green technologies.

BACKGROUND: Many adults are living longer with health conditions in the United 
States. Understanding the disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) for such health 
conditions may help to inform healthcare providers and their patients, guide 
health interventions, reduce healthcare costs, improve quality of life, and 
increase longevity for aging Americans. The purpose of this study was to 
determine the burden of 10 health conditions for a nationally-representative 
sample of adults aged 50 years and older in the United States.
METHODS: Data from the 1998-2014 waves of the Health and Retirement Study were 
analyzed. At each wave, participants indicated if they were diagnosed with the 
following 10 conditions: cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), 
congestive heart failure, diabetes, back pain, hypertension, a fractured hip, 
myocardial infarction, rheumatism or arthritis, and a stroke. Years lived with a 
disability and years of life lost to premature mortality were summed for 
calculating DALYs. Sample weights were utilized in the analyses to make the DALY 
estimates nationally-representative. Results for the DALYs were presented in 
thousands.
RESULTS: There were 30,101 participants included. Sex stratified DALY estimates 
ranged from 4092 (fractured hip)-to-178,055 (hypertension) for men and 13,621 
(fractured hip)-to-200,794 (hypertension) for women. The weighted overall DALYs 
were: 17,660 for hip fractures, 62,630 for congestive heart failure, 64,710 for 
myocardial infarction, 90,337 for COPD, 93,996 for stroke, 142,012 for cancer, 
117,534 for diabetes, 186,586 for back pain, 333,420 for arthritis, and 378,849 
for hypertension. In total, there were an estimated 1,487,734 years of healthy 
life lost from the 10 health conditions examined over the study period.
CONCLUSIONS: The burden of these health conditions accounted for over a million 
years of healthy life lost for middle-aged and older Americans over the 16 year 
study period. Our results should be used to inform healthcare providers and 
guide health interventions aiming to improve the health of middle-aged and older 
adults. Moreover, shifting health policy and resources to match DALY trends may 
help to improve quality of life during aging and longevity.

BACKGROUND: To date, surgeons and physicians have found positive results 
treating metabolic syndrome with surgical and non-surgical weight loss 
therapies. The purpose of this study was to evaluate changes in telomere length 
in patients with metabolic syndrome after weight loss.
METHODS/DESIGN: This study is a three-arm randomized controlled trial. The first 
group is composed of patients who have undergone stapleless bypass surgery (one 
anastomosis gastric bypass with an obstructive stapleless pouch and anastomosis 
(LOAGB-OSPAN)). The second group of patients underwent standard gastric bypass 
surgery (laparoscopic mini-gastric bypass-one anastomosis gastric bypass 
(LMGB-OAGB). The patients in the third group received non-surgical weight loss 
therapy, including a hypocaloric diet with energy restriction (- 500 kcal/day). 
The aim is to compare changes-telomere length, body mass index, comorbidities, 
and quality of life-in patients with metabolic syndrome after weight loss.
DISCUSSION: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first randomized study to 
simultaneously compare the effects of surgical and non-surgical weight loss on 
changes in telomere length. It could provide a solution to the growing problem 
of metabolic syndrome. Normalization of the body mass index results in 
improvements in the health of patients with metabolic syndrome.

We compared the pharmacokinetics and efficacy of a combination of d-cycloserine 
(DCS) and ethionamide (ETO) via oral and inhalation routes in mice. The plasma 
half-life (t1/2) of oral ETO at a human-equivalent dose decreased from 
4.63 ± 0.61 h to 1.64 ± 0.40 h when DCS was coadministered. The area under the 
concentration-time curve from 0 h to time t (AUC0-t ) was reduced to one-third. 
Inhalation overcame the interaction. Inhalation, but not oral doses, reduced the 
lung CFU/g of Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv from 6 to 3 log10 in 4 weeks, 
indicating bactericidal activity.

Health care spending in the U.S. grew two trillion dollars from 1987 to 2010, a 
400% increase, but our understanding of the value of that increase is limited. 
In this paper we estimate the net value of spending for thirty chronic diseases 
between 1987 and 2010 by assigning a monetary value to changes in health 
outcomes and relating it to the costs of treating each disease. Changes in 
health outcomes are measured using a newly-available time series of disability 
adjusted life years (DALYs) data from the Institute for Health Metrics and 
Evaluation. Spending on treatments are determined using health care expenditure 
data from nationally representative surveys. We find the net value of treatment 
has grown substantially for several diseases. Overall, 20 of the 30 chronic 
conditions studied experienced an increase in health outcomes over the period, 
with 8 of those 20 showing a decrease in per-patient spending. Our estimates of 
net value of health spending using DALYs data are simple to apply and results 
are generally consistent with previous estimates which usually involve onerous 
data collection methods to study a single disease. The DALYs data have potential 
to be a useful, low-cost way to measure changes in health outcomes. However, 
challenges remain in using DALYs data to accurately measure the changing value 
of health care spending on the treatment of disease.

The effect of repetitive training on learned actions has been a major subject in 
behavioural neuroscience. Many studies of instrumental conditioning in mammals, 
including humans, suggested that learned actions early in training are 
goal-driven and controlled by outcome expectancy, but they become more automatic 
and insensitive to reduction in the value of the outcome after extended 
training. It was unknown, however, whether the development of value-insensitive 
behaviour also occurs by extended training of Pavlovian conditioning in any 
animals. Here we show that crickets Gryllus bimaculatus that had received 
minimal training to associate an odour with water (unconditioned stimulus, US) 
did not exhibit conditioned response (CR) to the odour when they were given 
water until satiation before the test, but those that had received extended 
training exhibited CR even when they were satiated with water. Further 
pharmacological experiments suggested that octopamine neurons, the invertebrate 
counterparts of noradrenaline neurons, mediate US value signals and control 
execution of CR after minimal training, but the control diminishes with the 
progress of training and hence the CR becomes insensitive to US devaluation. The 
results suggest that repetitive sensory experiences can lead to a change from a 
goal-driven response to a more automatic one in crickets.

Objectives: We aimed to assess the cost-utility of reslizumab for patients with 
severe eosinophilic asthma uncontrolled with high-dose inhaled corticosteroids 
and long-acting β2-agonists (ICS/LABAs) in Korea.Methods: A Markov model with 
limited societal perspective was used to compare the costs and quality-adjusted 
life years (QALYs) of reslizumab add-on therapy with standard-of-care (high-dose 
ICS/LABA) and standard-of-care alone. The model adopted a 4 week cycle with the 
following six health states over a lifetime (60 years): controlled asthma, 
uncontrolled asthma, moderate exacerbation, severe exacerbation, all-cause death 
and asthma-related death. The population comprised adult patients (age 
≥18 years) with severe eosinophilic asthma (eosinophils ≥400 cells/μL) at Global 
Initiative for Asthma (GINA) step 4 or 5 who had experienced at least three 
exacerbations in the preceding year. Model inputs were sourced from individual 
patient-level data from two 52 week randomized controlled trials of reslizumab 
(NCT01287039, NCT01285323). The model included discontinuation rules where 
patients uncontrolled with reslizumab add-on therapy were transitioned to the 
standard-of-care arm. Costs and QALYs were annually discounted at 5%. 
Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed.Results: 
Reslizumab add-on therapy was associated with increased cost (US$119,394) and 
improved QALYs (5.17) compared with standard-of-care alone, resulting in an 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of US$23,081 per QALY gained. Body weight, 
time horizon and discount rate were influential factors in the 
model.Conclusions: The addition of reslizumab to high-dose ICS/LABA was 
cost-effective in Korean patients with severe eosinophilic asthma uncontrolled 
with high-dose ICS/LABA, based on the threshold of 1 gross domestic product in 
Korea.Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01285323.Trial

Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Total Neoadjuvant Therapy Followed by Radical 
Resection Versus Conventional Therapy for Locally Advanced Rectal Cancer.

BACKGROUND: Definitive surgery with total mesorectal excision is the mainstay of 
treatment for locally advanced rectal cancer. Multimodality therapy improves 
long-term survival. Current standards advise neoadjuvant chemoradiation followed 
by radical surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy. Nationally, compliance with 
adjuvant chemotherapy is only 32%. New research evaluates the effectiveness of 
total neoadjuvant therapy: complete chemotherapy and chemoradiation before 
surgery.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to determine the favored treatment for 
locally advanced rectal cancer by comparing the cost-effectiveness of total 
neoadjuvant therapy and the current standard of care.
DESIGN: Decision analytical modeling using long-term costs and 5-year 
disease-free survival was performed to determine the cost-effectiveness after 
total neoadjuvant therapy and the current standard of care. Sensitivity analysis 
was used to investigate the effect of uncertainty in model parameters.
SETTINGS: Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services billing data perspective was 
adopted and outcomes modeled according to local and national databases and 
literature consensus.
PATIENTS: Adult patients with stage II or III rectal cancer were selected.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cost-effectiveness in disease-free life-years, 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, and net monetary benefit were determined 
over a 5-year posttreatment period. The favored strategy was determined based on 
cost-effectiveness and sensitivity analyses.
RESULTS: Cost-effectiveness for total neoadjuvant therapy was 40,708 
$/life-year, and, for conventional therapy, cost-effectiveness was 44,248 
$/life-year. Sensitivity analysis showed that, for an estimated total 
neoadjuvant therapy completion rate of 90%, total neoadjuvant therapy would 
remain the dominant strategy for any adjuvant chemotherapy completion rate of 
less than 93%.
LIMITATIONS: The samples used to calculate completion rates are small, and 
survival probabilities are based on existing literature, local database values, 
and consensus estimates. The model encompasses a 5-year time period from 
diagnosis.
CONCLUSIONS: Cost-effectiveness analysis shows that a strategy of total 
neoadjuvant therapy followed by radical surgery is favored over the current 
standard of care for locally advanced rectal cancer. Sensitivity analysis shows 
that a low rate of adjuvant chemotherapy administration plays a key role in 
decreasing the cost-effectiveness of the current standard of care. See Video

RATIONALE: As part of the End TB Strategy, the World Health Organization calls 
for low-tuberculosis (TB) incidence settings to achieve pre-elimination (<10 
cases per million) and elimination (<1 case per million) by 2035 and 2050, 
respectively. These targets require testing and treatment for latent 
tuberculosis infection (LTBI).
OBJECTIVES: To estimate the ability and costs of testing and treatment for LTBI 
to reach pre-elimination and elimination targets in California.
METHODS: We created an individual-based epidemic model of TB, calibrated to 
historical cases. We evaluated the effects of increased testing (QuantiFERON-TB 
Gold) and treatment (three months of isoniazid and rifapentine). We analyzed 
four test and treat targeting strategies: (1) individuals with medical risk 
factors (MRF), (2) non-USB, (3) both non-USB and MRF, and (4) all Californians. 
For each strategy, we estimated the effects of increasing test and treat by a 
factor of 2, 4, or 10 from the base case. We estimated the number of TB cases 
occurring and prevented, and net and incremental costs from 2017 to 2065 in 2015 
U.S. dollars. Efficacy, costs, adverse events, and treatment dropout were 
estimated from published data. We estimated the cost per case averted and per 
quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: In the base case, 106,000 TB cases are predicted 
to 2065. Pre-elimination was achieved by 2065 in three scenarios: a 10-fold 
increase in the non-USB and persons with MRF (by 2052), and 4- or 10-fold 
increase in all Californians (by 2058 and 2035, respectively). TB elimination 
was not achieved by any intervention scenario. The most aggressive strategy, 
10-fold in all Californians, achieved a case rate of 8 (95% UI 4-16) per million 
by 2050. Of scenarios that reached pre-elimination, the incremental net cost was 
$20 billion (non-USB and MRF) to $48 billion. These had an incremental cost per 
QALY of $657,000 to $3.1 million. A more efficient but somewhat less effective 
single-lifetime test strategy reached as low as $80,000 per QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: Substantial gains can be made in TB control in coming years by 
scaling-up current testing and treatment in non-USB and those with medical 
risks.

BACKGROUND: The five-year survival rate for successful surgical treatment of 
cholangiocellular cancer is only 20-40%, and in the case of an unresectable 
tumor, the life expectancy does not usually exceed 6 months. Survival decreases 
with the presence of jaundice, due to the spread of the tumor process along the 
bile ducts, leading to their obstruction. We report outcomes of patients with 
nonresectable bile duct carcinoma complicated by obstructive jaundice treated 
with Photodynamic Therapy (PDT).
METHODS: Combined diagnosis and treatment included percutaneous cholangiostomy, 
intraductal video fluorescence diagnostics, photodynamic therapy, and bile duct 
stenting. All patients were treated at the Sechenov University Oncology Center 
in Moscow. The results of treatment of 33 patients have been presented. The 
intraductal diagnosis of malignant bile duct lesions was performed after 
cholangiostomy using the endovideofluorescence module for minimally invasive 
surgery and endoscopy. With the use of this method, it is the first time in 
Russia that it has become possible to obtain a videofluorescent image of the 
tumor and to determine the high level of photosensitizer accumulation in all 
cholangiocarcinoma patients. The preparations Photolon, Radachlorin, and 
Photosens were employed as photosensitizers (PS). Intraductal photodynamic 
therapy was used to achieve the antitumor effect. Laser power density was about 
200 mW/cm2.
RESULTS: We present initial results, improved the diagnostic possibilities in 
this difficult localization of carcinoma, and demonstrated the feasibility of 
prolongation of life without significant deterioration of its quality. The 
average survival time in the treatment group is 9.5 months.
CONCLUSION: The treatment of patients with nonresectable cholangiocarcinoma with 
Photodynamic Therapy should be an available option. In this context, the 
additional use of intraductal endovideofluorescence diagnostics is a highly 
specific technique that allows reliable detection of the photosensitizer 
accumulation predominantly by the tumor tissue and appears promising. As shown 
by our experience, flourescent localization followed by Photodynamic Therapy, 
enabled us to improve diagnostic techniques and treat the tumor with improved 
outcome.

Beef intended for production of mince (ground beef) was vacuum packed in minced 
and unminced form and in the presence and absence of solid CO2. Subsequently the 
meat was displayed using overwrap-type packs to assess its shelf-life as beef 
mince. The total microbial load was reduced by mincing after storage and this 
also helped maintain the bloom in overwrap packs. Addition of CO2 markedly 
reduced growth of aerobic spoilage organisms during storage and during 
subsequent display. Lactic acid bacteria were affected less than aerobes but 
levels of CO2 above 2 g/kg of meat slowed their growth in the vacuum packages 
but not in overwrap packs. Overall, CO2 addition helped maintain the bloom of 
the meat and reduced total microbial numbers. It thus reduced the adverse 
effects of storage in vacuum packages and could produce a product more stable, 
during display, than the fresh meat.

The effect on extension of refrigerated shelf life of boned trout, treated or 
not treated with a 2.3% potassium sorbate dip and packaged in laminated high/low 
density "semi-permeable" polyethylene bags in the presence of a CO2-enriched 
modified atmosphere (MA), was studied. The combination of packaging, 
refrigeration, and MA was effective in doubling the fresh shelf life of the 
trout product. Potassium sorbate limited bacterial growth but did not extend 
shelf life beyond what was obtained with MA alone. Changes in pH and ammonia 
concentration in the fish samples were not good quality indicators in this 
study. Although not detected by sensory evaluations, TBA analyses indicated the 
possible development of oxidative rancidity in the MA-held fish. Carbon dioxide 
content in the flesh of the trout appeared to be a function of CO2 in the 
headspace of the bags which was reduced by about 50% during the first 20 d of 
storage. Based on changes in organoleptic characteristics, the quality of the 
raw trout, including the potassium sorbate-treated trout, was only marginally 
acceptable after 25 d of storage in the MA. However, the cooked product was 
rated favorably by a consumer type taste panel. The maximum post-MA refrigerated 
shelf life of the trout held under the experimental conditions of this study, 
including those treated with potassium sorbate, was about 1 week.

Atom Transfer Radical Polymerization (ATRP) has been a powerful tool to 
synthesize well-defined functional polymers, which are widely used in biology, 
drug/gene delivery and antibacterial materials, etc. However, the potential 
toxic residues in polymer reduced its service life and limited its applications. 
In order to overcome the problem, in this work, a novel polymerization system of 
activators generated by electron transfer for atom transfer radical 
polymerization (AGET ATRP) for synchronous separation of the metal catalyst and 
byproduct of reducing agent was developed, using thiol-grafted cellulose paper 
(Cell-SH) as a solid reducing agent. The polymerization kinetics were 
investigated in detail, and the "living" features of the novel polymerization 
system were confirmed by chain-end analysis and chain extension experiment for 
the resultant polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA). It is noted that the copper 
residual in obtained PMMA was less than 20 ppm, just by filtering the sheet-like 
byproduct of the reducing agent.

In recent years, the search for biological methods to avoid the application of 
chemical products in agriculture has led to investigating the use of 
biopolymers-based materials. Among the tested biomaterials, the best results 
were obtained from those based on the biopolymer chitosan (CHT). CHT, available 
in large quantities from the deacetylation of chitin, has multiple advantages: 
it is safe, inexpensive and can be easily associated with other compounds to 
achieve better performance. In this review, we have summarized the latest 
researches of the application of CHT on plant productivity, plant protection 
against the attack of pathogens and extension of the commercial life of detached 
fruits.

The life expectancy of a transformer is largely depended on the service life of 
transformer polymer insulation materials. Nowadays, several papers have reported 
that the traditional system poles obtained from polarization and depolarization 
current (PDC) data can be used to assess the condition of transformer insulation 
systems. However, the traditional system poles technique only provides limited 
ageing information for transformer polymer insulation. In this paper, the 
modified system poles obtained from PDC data are proposed to assess the ageing 
condition of transformer polymer insulation. The aim of the work is to focus on 
reporting a comparative investigation on the performance of modified system 
poles and traditional system poles for assessing the ageing condition of a 
transformer polymer insulation system. In the present work, a series of 
experiments have been performed under controlled laboratory conditions. The PDC 
measurement data, degree of polymerization (DP) and moisture content of the 
oil-immersed polymer pressboard specimens were carefully monitored. It is 
observed that, compared to the relationships between traditional system poles 
and DP values, there are better correlations between the modified system poles 
and DP values, because the modified system poles can obtain much more ageing 
information on transformer polymer insulation. Therefore, the modified system 
poles proposed in the paper are more suitable for the diagnosis of the ageing 
condition of transformer polymer insulation.

Existing estimates of mortality for Papua New Guinea (PNG) have primarily been 
based on models using little empirical data, and without estimation of life 
expectancy at subnational level. We used data on deaths from the 2000 and 2011 
censuses and indirect demographic methods to estimate under-5 mortality (5q0), 
adult mortality (45q15), and life expectancy by province and sex. A 
Socioeconomic Composite Index was constructed to assess the plausibility of life 
expectancy estimates. We generated 5q0 estimates (68 per 1000 live births for 
males and 58 for females), 45q15 (269 per 1000 for males and 237 for females), 
and life expectancy (62.0 years for males and 64.3 for females) in PNG in 2011. 
Provinces with low life expectancy had correspondingly low levels of development 
as measured by the Composite Index, and vice versa. These subnational estimates 
of mortality levels and patterns maybe useful at the provincial level to improve 
population health in PNG.

OBJECTIVE: This study aims at evaluating the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility 
of a guided and unguided internet-based intervention for chronic pain patients 
(ACTonPainguided and ACTonPainunguided) compared with a waitlist control group 
(CG) as well as the comparative cost-effectiveness of the guided and the 
unguided version.
DESIGN: This is a health economic evaluation alongside a three-arm randomised 
controlled trial from a societal perspective. Assessments were conducted at 
baseline, 9 weeks and 6 months after randomisation.
SETTING: Participants were recruited through online and offline strategies and 
in collaboration with a health insurance company.
PARTICIPANTS: 302 adults (≥18 years, pain for at least 6 months) were randomly 
allocated to one of the three groups (ACTonPainguided, ACTonPainunguided, CG).
INTERVENTIONS: ACTonPain consists of seven modules and is based on Acceptance 
and Commitment Therapy. ACTonPainguided and ACTonPainunguided only differ in 
provision of human support.
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Main outcomes of the cost-effectiveness 
and the cost-utility analyses were meaningful change in pain interference 
(treatment response) and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), respectively. 
Economic evaluation estimates were the incremental cost-effectiveness and 
cost-utility ratio (ICER/ICUR).
RESULTS: At 6-month follow-up, treatment response and QALYs were highest in 
ACTonPainguided (44% and 0.280; mean costs = €6,945), followed by 
ACTonPainunguided (28% and 0.266; mean costs = €6,560) and the CG (16% and 
0.244; mean costs = €6,908). ACTonPainguided vs CG revealed an ICER of €45 and 
an ICUR of €604.ACTonPainunguided dominated CG. At a willingness-to-pay of €0 
the probability of being cost-effective was 50% for ACTonPainguided (vs CG, for 
both treatment response and QALY gained) and 67% for ACTonPainunguided (vs CG, 
for both treatment response and QALY gained). These probabilities rose to 95% 
when society's willingness-to-pay is €91,000 (ACTonPainguided) and €127,000 
(ACTonPainunguided) per QALY gained. ACTonPainguided vs ACTonPainunguided 
revealed an ICER of €2,374 and an ICUR of €45,993.
CONCLUSIONS: Depending on society's willingness-to-pay, ACTonPain is a 
potentially cost-effective adjunct to established pain treatment. 
ACTonPainunguided (vs CG) revealed lower costs at better health outcomes. 
However, uncertainty has to be considered. Direct comparison of the two 
interventions does not indicate a preference for ACTonPainguided.

Different strategies for treatment and prevention of Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
are currently under investigation, including passive immunization with 
anti-amyloid β (anti-Aβ) monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Here, we investigate the 
therapeutic potential of a novel type of Aβ-targeting agent based on an affibody 
molecule with fundamentally different properties to mAbs. We generated a 
therapeutic candidate, denoted ZSYM73-albumin-binding domain (ABD; 16.8 kDa), by 
genetic linkage of the dimeric ZSYM73 affibody for sequestering of monomeric 
Aβ-peptides and an ABD for extension of its in vivo half-life. Amyloid precursor 
protein (APP)/PS1 transgenic AD mice were administered with ZSYM73-ABD, followed 
by behavioral examination and immunohistochemistry. Results demonstrated rescued 
cognitive functions and significantly lower amyloid burden in the treated 
animals compared to controls. No toxicological symptoms or immunology-related 
side-effects were observed. To our knowledge, this is the first reported in vivo 
investigation of a systemically delivered scaffold protein against monomeric Aβ, 
demonstrating a therapeutic potential for prevention of AD.

BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a disorder that results in increased 
hospitalizations and higher mortality. Advances in management have resulted in 
increases in life expectancy and led to increasing awareness of sickle cell 
hepatopathy (SCH). However, its impact in patients on the natural history and 
outcomes of SCD is not known. Our study aims to describe the prevalence of 
extreme hyperbilirubinemia (EH), one form of SCH, its effect on morbidity and 
mortality, and correlations between sickle cell genotype and SCH type. We 
hypothesize that EH is associated with higher morbidity and mortality.
AIM: To investigate the effects of EH on morbidity and mortality among patients 
with SCD.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study was performed using a database of 
patients with SCD treated at Grady Memorial Hospital between May 2004 and 
January 2017. Patients with EH (defined as total bilirubin above 13.0 mg/dL) 
were identified. A control group was identified from the same database with 
patients with total serum bilirubin ≤ 5.0 mg/dL. Electronic medical records were 
used to extract demographic information, laboratory values, radiology results, 
current medications, need for transfusions and mortality data. Two samples 
T-test, chi-squared test and Fisher's exact test were then used to compare the 
parameters between the two groups.
RESULTS: Out of the database, fifty-seven charts were found of patients with 
bilirubin > 13 mg/dL. Prevalence of severe SCH as defined by EH was 4.8% 
(57/1172). There were no demographic differences between patients with and 
without EH. Significant genotypic differences existed between the two groups, 
with hemoglobin SS SCD being much higher in the EH group (P < 0.001). Patients 
with severe EH had a significant elevations in alanine aminotransferase (157.0 ± 
266.2 IU/L vs 19.8 ± 21.3 IU/L, P < 0.001), aspartate aminotransferase (256.5 ± 
485.9 U/L vs 28.2 ± 14.7 U/L, P < 0.001) and alkaline phosphatase (218.0 ± 176.2 
IU/L vs 85.9 ± 68.4 IU/L, P < 0.001). Patients with EH had significantly higher 
degree of end organ failure measured with quick Sequential Organ Failure 
Assessment scores (0.42 ± 0.68 vs 0.01 ± 0.12, P < 0.001), increased need for 
blood products (63% vs 5%, P < 0.001), and exchange transfusions (10.5% vs 1.3%, 
P = 0.022).
CONCLUSION: Among patients with SCD, elevated levels of total bilirubin are 
rare, but indicative of elevated morbidity, mortality, and need for blood 
transfusions. Large differences in sickle cell genotype also exist, but the 
significance of this is unknown.
