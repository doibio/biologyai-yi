It was recently reported that socio-economic factors related differences in 
human life expectancy are associated with differences in the variance of age at 
death. To determine whether anti-aging interventions also alter the variance of 
longevity, we have analyzed data from mice subjected to treatment with drugs 
that affect aging or to calorie restriction and from long-lived mutant mice. The 
relationship of changes in longevity and in longevity variance was found to 
depend on sex and treatment and apparently also on strain. Increased longevity 
of male mice treated with effective anti-aging drugs was accompanied by reduced 
variance of age at death and apparent reduction of early life mortality. Life 
extension induced by growth-hormone related mutations and calorie restriction 
tended to increase longevity variance in females only. We conclude that impact 
of anti-aging interventions on the variance of age at death and distribution of 
individual lifespans in laboratory mice is treatment-dependent and sexually 
dimorphic.

Gallbladder carcinoma (GBC) is a common malignancy with a poor prognosis. With 
the average life expectancy increasing globally, the incidence of GBC is 
predicted to increase as well. We investigated the safety and feasibility of 
surgical treatment for elderly patients with GBC. We retrospectively compared 
clinical pathological data and treatment outcomes in 45 consecutive GBC patients 
(23 patients ≥ 75 years [elderly group] and 22 patients < 75 years [younger 
group]) who underwent curative resection at the Iwakuni Center from January 2008 
to December 2017. The proportion of preoperative comorbidities and anticoagulant 
use was significantly higher in the elderly group. The American Society of 
Anesthesiologists score was higher in the elderly versus the younger group, and 
the elderly group had significantly shorter operation times. Reduced activities 
of daily living was more common in the elderly versus younger group. The 
percentage of radical resection and overall 3-year survival (66.6% younger vs. 
64.4% elderly) were similar between the groups. Controlling Nutritional Status 
(CONUT) score ≥ 3 and R0 resection were identified as prognostic factors for 
overall survival rate among all patients. After careful patient selection.

Purpose: Hispanic women are less likely to be screened for breast cancer than 
non-Hispanic women, which contributes to the disproportionate prevalence of 
advanced-stage breast cancer in this population group. Patient navigation may be 
a promising approach to help women overcome the complexity of accessing multiple 
health care services related to breast cancer screening and treatment. The goal 
of this study is to assess patient perception and cost-effectiveness of a 
multilevel, community-based patient navigation program to improve breast cancer 
screening among Hispanic women in South Texas. Methods: We used mixed 
methods-including focus groups of program participants and a microsimulation 
model of breast cancer-to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of 
the program on the target population. Program data from 2013 to 2016 were 
collected and used to conduct the analyses. Results: Focus groups showed that 
the patient navigation program improved patient knowledge, attitudes, and 
behaviors regarding breast health and increased the mammography screening rate 
from 60% to 80%. Cost-effectiveness analysis showed that the program could 
increase life expectancy by 0.71 years and yield an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio of $3120 per quality-adjusted life year compared to no 
intervention. Conclusion: The 3-year multilevel, community-based patient 
navigation program effectively increased mammography screening uptake and 
adherence and improved knowledge and behaviors on breast health among program 
participants. Future research is needed to translate and disseminate the program 
to other socioeconomic and demographic groups to test its robustness and design.

PURPOSE: The primary outcomes are the evaluation and quantification of pain 
relief and improvement in range of motion after OAT in OCD. The secondary 
outcomes are: resuming of sport activities, evaluation of the ADL recovery rate 
and subjective evaluation of the quality of life improvement.
METHODS: Nine patients, affected by an unstable and non-acute OCD lesion of the 
capitulum humeri, have been treated by the same surgeon. The patient mean age 
was 22.4 (16-45 years). All subjects were treated with the same surgical 
technique (arthroscopic OAT from the same side knee, a single cylinder of 
6.5-9 mm in diameter) and underwent the same rehabilitation. The mean follow-up 
was 48 months (30-52 months). The authors documented the clinical assessment of 
each patient and carried out a questionnaire which included the VAS scale, MEPS 
Score and Quick DASH score. Patients were asked for MRI and radiographs pre- and 
post-operatively at follow-up.
RESULTS: The mean range of motion improvement was 17.9° in extension (range 
13°-27°) and 10.6° in flexion (range 0°-20°) The VAS mean improvement was 7.1 
(range 6-8) and the mean post-op value 0.6 (range 0-3). The MEPS score mean 
post-operative value was 98.3 (range 85-100). The Quick-DASH mean post-operative 
value was 2.5 (range 0-9.1) with a mean improvement of 41.4 points (range 
36.4-47.7 points). All patients resumed sports in 6 months post-operatively.
CONCLUSIONS: The autologous transplant of an osteochondral plug is a safe and 
promising procedure. Despite being more demanding, the arthroscopic approach is 
a valuable tool if the surgeon aims to reduce the invasiveness of the procedure, 
with all the consequent advantages.

QALYs without bias? Nonparametric correction of time trade-off and standard 
gamble weights based on prospect theory.

Common health state valuation methodologies, such as standard gamble (SG) and 
time trade-off (TTO), typically produce different weights for identical health 
states. We attempt to alleviate these differences by correcting the confounding 
influences modeled in prospect theory: loss aversion and probability weighting. 
Furthermore, we correct for nonlinear utility of life duration. In contrast to 
earlier attempts at correcting TTO and SG weights, we measure and correct all 
these tenets simultaneously, using newly developed nonparametric methodology. 
These corrections were applied to three less-than-perfect health states, 
measured with TTO and SG. We found considerable loss aversion and probability 
weighting for both gains and losses in life years, and we observe concave 
utility for gains and convex utility for losses in life years. After correction, 
the initially significant differences in weights between TTO and SG disappeared 
for all health states. Our findings suggest new opportunities to account for 
bias in health state valuations but also the need for further validation of 
resulting weights.

A change in the expectations about future treatments may change the option value 
of a current treatment, thereby affecting its utilization. We conducted an 
interrupted time series analysis using a large administrative claims database to 
test whether the utilization of existing cancer treatments changed after the 
disclosures of the then-investigational drug ipilimumab's Phase II and Phase III 
results among metastatic melanoma patients from 2008 to 2011. We used a 
multinomial logistic regression to analyze the temporal probability of receiving 
antineoplastic systemic therapy, surgical resection of metastasis, or both, 
relative to no treatment, in the first 3 months following the first metastasis 
diagnosis. One thousand eight hundred forty-six metastatic melanoma patients 
were included. After adjusting for clinical and sociodemographic variables and 
the underlying time trend, the disclosure of ipilimumab's Phase II result was 
associated with a nearly twofold immediate increase in the probability of 
receiving surgical resection of metastasis relative to no treatment, which was 
significant at 5% level. No significant effect was observed for the time trend. 
No significant effects were found for the announcement of the Phase III result. 
Our findings in metastatic melanoma provide the first empirical evidence of the 
impact of option value in cancer treatment decision making.

BACKGROUND: Spectroscopic imaging based on the spontaneous Raman scattering 
effects can provide unique fingerprint information in relation to the vibration 
bands of molecules. Due to its advantages of high chemical specificity, 
non-invasive detection capability, low sensitivity to water, and no special 
sample pretreatment, Raman Spectroscopic Imaging (RSI) has become an invaluable 
tool in the field of biomedicine and medicinal chemistry.
METHODS: There are three methods to implement RSI, including point scanning, 
line scanning and wide-field RSI. Point-scanning can achieve two-and 
three-dimensional imaging of target samples. High spectral resolution, full 
spectral range and confocal features render this technique highly attractive. 
However, point scanning based RSI is a time-consuming process that can take 
several hours to map a small area. Line scanning RSI is an extension of point 
scanning method, with an imaging speed being 300-600 times faster. In the 
wide-field RSI, the laser illuminates the entire region of interest directly and 
all the images then collected for analysis. In general, it enables more accurate 
chemical imaging at faster speeds.
RESULTS: This review focuses on the recent advances in RSI, with particular 
emphasis on the latest developments on instrumentation and the related 
applications in biomedicine and medicinal chemistry. Finally, we prospect the 
development trend of RSI as well as its potential to translation from bench to 
bedside.
CONCLUSION: RSI is a powerful technique that provides unique chemical 
information, with a great potential in the fields of biomedicine and medicinal 
chemistry.

Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) is a chronic disease characterized by 
multiple life-threatening illnesses caused by a retro-virus, Human 
Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). HIV infection slowly destroys the immune system 
and increases the risk of various other infections and diseases. Although, there 
is no immediate cure for HIV infection/AIDS, several drugs targeting various 
cruxes of HIV infection are used to slow down the progress of the disease and to 
boost the immune system. One of the key therapeutic strategies is Highly Active 
Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART) or ' AIDS cocktail' in a general sense, which is 
a customized combination of anti-retroviral drugs designed to combat the HIV 
infection. Since HAART's inception in 1995, this treatment was found to be 
effective in improving the life expectancy of HIV patients over two decades. 
Among various classes of HAART treatment regimen, Protease Inhibitors (PIs) are 
known to be widely used as a major component and found to be effective in 
treating HIV infection/AIDS. For the past several years, a variety of protease 
inhibitors have been reported. This review outlines the drug design strategies 
of PIs, chemical and pharmacological characteristics of some mechanism-based 
inhibitors, summarizes the recent developments in small molecule based drug 
discovery with HIV protease as a drug target. Further discussed are the 
pharmacology, PI drug resistance on HIV PR, adverse effects of HIV PIs and 
challenges/impediments in the successful application of HIV PIs as an important 
class of drugs in HAART regimen for the effective treatment of AIDS.

As life expectancy in Ghana improves, a large and growing population of older 
adults require healthcare. Despite governmental support for the care of older 
adults, there have been no geriatricians and no in-country educational path for 
those desiring to become specialists in this field. In fact, 23 of 54 countries 
in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) lack even a single geriatrician. We describe a novel 
and collaborative approach used to develop the first geriatric training 
fellowship in Ghana. Faculty from the Ghana College of Physicians and Surgeons 
and the University of Michigan worked together to develop a rigorous and 
evidence-based geriatrics curriculum, based on US standards but adapted to be 
appropriate for the cultural, economic, educational, and social norms in Ghana. 
This approach led to a strong training model for care of older adults while also 
strengthening the ongoing collaboration between the two partner universities in 
Ghana and the United States. The fellowship has been inaugurated in Ghana and 
can serve as a concrete educational model for other countries in SSA. J Am

BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a major contributor to the burden 
from non-communicable diseases in Sub-Saharan Africa and hypertension is the 
leading risk factor for CVD. The objective of this modeling study is to assess 
the cost-effectiveness of a risk stratified approach to medication management in 
Kenya in order to achieve adequate blood pressure control to reduce CVD events.
METHODS: We developed a microsimulation model to evaluate CVD risk over the 
lifetime of a cohort of individuals. Risk groups were assigned utilizing 
modified Framingham study distributions based on individual level risk factors 
from the Kenya STEPwise survey which collected details on blood pressure, blood 
glucose, tobacco and alcohol use and cholesterol levels. We stratified 
individuals into 4 risk groups: very low, low, moderate and high risk. Mortality 
could occur due to acute CVD events, subsequent future events (for individual 
who survive the initial event) and other causes. We present cost and DALYs 
gained due to medication management for men and women 25 to 69 years.
RESULTS: Treating high risk individuals only was generally more cost-effective 
that treating high and moderate risk individuals. At the anticipated base levels 
of effectiveness, medication management was only cost-effective under the low 
cost scenario. The incremental cost per DALY gained with low cost ranged from 
$1,505 to $3,608, which is well under $4,785 (3 times GPD per capita) threshold 
for Kenya. Under the low cost scenario, even lower levels of effectiveness of 
medication management are likely to be cost-effective for high-risk men and 
women.
CONCLUSIONS: In Kenya, our results indicate that the risk stratified approach to 
treating hypertension may be cost-effective especially for men and women at a 
high risk for CVD events, but these results are highly sensitive to the cost of 
medications. Medication management would require significant financial 
investment and therefore other interventions, including lifestyle changes, 
should be evaluated especially for those with elevated blood pressure and 
overall 10-year risk that is less than 20%.

[Advances of optimized neoadjuvant therapy in the treatment of locally advanced

Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy is the current standard of care for locally 
advanced rectal cancer. However, this modality is facing more and more 
challenges. The research progress on this issue around the world can be 
summarized into three aspects. The first is to increase the intensity of 
treatment to obtain better tumor regression, such as adding a second drug during 
the neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, prolonging the interval and receiving 
sufficient chemotherapy before surgery. Current research data are not sufficient 
to support strategies for adding drugs or receiving sufficient chemotherapy 
before surgery, but it may be worth looking forward to adding irinotecan during 
neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, and an appropriate extension of the interval 
before surgery may also be a good option. Secondly, we can reduce the intensity 
of treatment to improve the quality of life of patients with a non-inferior 
clinical outcome, such as non-surgical approach, local excision rather than 
total mesorectal excision and removal of preoperative radiotherapy. The data of 
the International Watch & Wait Database (IWWD) suggest that patients with a 
Watch & Wait strategy have similar long-term survival outcomes as those who have 
undergone surgery and have pathologic complete response, meanwhile the data are 
still inadequate to support using local excision instead of total mesorectal 
excision, or removal of preoperative radiotherapy strategies. Finally, to 
achieve a precise individual treatment, some potential biomarkers are 
investigated via genomics, metabolomics and radiomics. But so far, there is no 
recognized biomarker for clinical treatment in the field of neoadjuvant therapy 
for rectal cancer. This article summarizes the clinical research progress of 
locally advanced rectal cancer in recent years from the above three aspects.

目前局部进展期直肠癌治疗主要的推荐方案为新辅助放化疗，其治疗模式的改进是临床关注的重点，也是近年来临床研究的重点议题。本文综合国际正在开展的相关研究进展，并将其归纳为以下3个方面。（1）增效：通过增加治疗强度获取更好的肿瘤退缩，如在新辅助化放疗期间增加药物、延长间隔期以或将辅助治疗前移。目前研究数据尚不足以支持在新辅助化放疗期间增加药物或将辅助治疗前移的策略，但伊立替康或许值得期待，而适当延长间隔期可能也是不错的选择。（2）减毒：在不明显减低疗效的前提下，减少治疗强度以改善患者的生活质量，如采取非手术治疗模式（"等待观察"策略）、用局部切除替代全直肠系膜切除术、或去除术前放疗策略。国际观察等待数据库（IWWD）的大数据提示，采用"等待观察"策略的患者长期生存结果与达到接受手术并获得病理完全缓解者相似；而局部切除替代全直肠系膜切除术、或去除术前放疗策略目前尚缺少足够数据支持。（3）预测：寻找生物标志物来区分敏感人群和抵抗人群，达到精准化治疗，如基因组学、代谢组学及影像组学等。但目前在直肠癌新辅助治疗领域，还没有公认的生物标志物能够用于临床治疗的指导。.

BACKGROUND: For patients with painful knee osteoarthritis, long-term symptomatic 
relief may improve quality of life. Cooled radiofrequency ablation (CRFA) has 
demonstrated significant improvements in pain, physical function and 
health-related quality of life compared with conservative therapy with 
intra-articular steroid (IAS) injections. This study aimed to establish the 
cost-effectiveness of CRFA compared with IAS for managing moderate to severe 
osteoarthritis-related knee pain, from the US Medicare system perspective.
METHODS: We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis utilizing efficacy data 
(Oxford Knee Scores) from a randomized, crossover trial on CRFA (NCT02343003), 
which compared CRFA with IAS out to 6 and 12 months, and with IAS patients who 
subsequently crossed over to receive CRFA after 6 months. Outcomes included 
health benefits (quality-adjusted life-years [QALYs]), costs and 
cost-effectiveness (expressed as cost per QALY gained). QALYs were estimated by 
mapping Oxford Knee Scores to the EQ-5D generic utility measure using a 
validated algorithm. Secondary analyses explored differences in the settings of 
care and procedures used in-trial versus real-world clinical practice.
RESULTS: CRFA resulted in an incremental QALY gain of 0.091 at an incremental 
cost of $1711, equating to a cost of US$18,773 per QALY gained over a 6-month 
time horizon versus IAS. Over a 12-month time horizon, the incremental QALY gain 
was 0.229 at the same incremental cost, equating to a cost of US$7462 per QALY 
gained versus IAS. Real-world cost assumptions resulted in modest increases in 
the cost per QALY gained to a maximum of US$21,166 and US$8296 at 6 and 
12 months, respectively. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated that findings were 
robust to variations in efficacy and cost parameters.
CONCLUSIONS: CRFA is a highly cost-effective treatment option for patients with 
osteoarthritis-related knee pain, compared with the US$100,000/QALY threshold 
typically used in the US.

Ovarian cancer is usually detected at a late stage and the overall 5-year 
survival is only 30-40%. Additional means for early detection and improved 
diagnosis are acutely needed. To search for novel biomarkers, we compared 
circulating plasma levels of 593 proteins in three cohorts of patients with 
ovarian cancer and benign tumors, using the proximity extension assay (PEA). A 
combinatorial strategy was developed for identification of different 
multivariate biomarker signatures. A final model consisting of 11 biomarkers 
plus age was developed into a multiplex PEA test reporting in absolute 
concentrations. The final model was evaluated in a fourth independent cohort and 
has an AUC = 0.94, PPV = 0.92, sensitivity = 0.85 and specificity = 0.93 for 
detection of ovarian cancer stages I-IV. The novel plasma protein signature 
could be used to improve the diagnosis of women with adnexal ovarian mass or in 
screening to identify women that should be referred to specialized examination.

Motivation for Longevity Across the Life Span: An Emerging Issue.

Lang FR(1), Rupprecht FS(1).

Author information:
(1)Institute of Psychogerontology, Friedrich-Alexander University of 
Erlangen-Nuremberg, Germany.

Over the past decades, increases in life expectancy in most modern societies 
have raised questions about whether and to what extent individuals value 
possible extensions of their personal lifetime. In this vein, a new field of 
research emerged that investigates the determinants, concomitants, and 
consequences of longevity values and personal preferences for an extended 
lifetime across adulthood. Based on a review of available theoretical and 
empirical work, we identified 3 mindsets on the challenges and potentials of 
human longevity common in research as well as personal views: (a) an 
essentialist mindset that builds on ideal principles of an infinite life, aimed 
at conquering or significantly postponing a biologically determined aging 
process, (b) a medicalist mindset that appraises aging as being primarily based 
on quality of health, and (c) a stoicist mindset that associates longevity and 
lifetime extension with the experience of grace and meaning. In this regard, we 
submit that motivation for longevity and its behavioral consequences differ 
depending on what mindsets individuals adopt in a given developmental context. 
We suggest that mindsets of longevity motivation are embedded in personal belief 
systems (e.g., death acceptance) that may depend on health, and on context 
influences (e.g., culture). Mindsets of longevity motivation may be related to 
differences in health behavior and late-life preparation. We illustrate such 
ideas with an exploratory analysis from a cross-cultural data set. We discuss 
the possible implications of these mindsets of longevity motivation for the 
aging sciences, and with regard to individual ways of approaching old age.

A tracheoesophageal fistula is the formation of an abnormal communication 
between the airway and the esophagus. Acquired tracheoesophageal fistulas can be 
benign or malignant. The management is either surgical or endoscopic depending 
on the etiology, size and anatomy of the fistula as well as on the patient's 
performance status. The interventional treatment of choice is endoscopic stent 
implantation. In general, tracheoesophageal fistulas in patients with benign 
conditions are managed surgically. If the patient is unfit for surgery silicone 
stents should be used because they can be more easily removed after a longer 
indwelling time compared to metal stents. Malignant fistulas are associated with 
very limited life expectancy of only a few weeks or months. In this situation 
fully covered self-expandable metal stents (FC-SEMS) are recommended, whereas 
surgical treatment approaches can only be considered in individual cases. 
Depending on the location of the fistula and the presence of an airway stenosis, 
tracheal stenting, esophageal stenting or parallel stenting of the trachea and 
the esophagus is carried out. Successful stent placement leads to immediate 
palliation of symptoms, such as cough or aspiration and results in a higher 
quality of life. Potential complications are stent migration, bleeding of the 
upper gastrointestinal tract, arrosion of neighboring organs and vessels with 
esophageal stents as well as secretion retention and obstruction with 
displacement of the airway with tracheobronchial stents.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The calculation of noncancer-specific life expectancy can 
guide shared decision-making and avoid over- and undertreatment in older adults 
with cancer. Several factors determine life expectancy, including 
socio-demographic background, comorbidities, physical performance, and geriatric 
assessment variables. We present an overview of existing tools to estimate life 
expectancy, as well as practical examples of how to take into account the 
patient's noncancer-specific life expectancy when discussing screening 
decisions, initiation of treatment, and end-of-life care.
RECENT FINDINGS: Life expectancy prognostication has been recently recommended 
by international societies as part of the initial assessment of all older adults 
with cancer. Additionally, online resources have been created in order to make 
life expectancy calculation tools accessible for clinicians. Understanding 
available methods to estimate life expectancy, as well as how to utilize them, 
is a fundamental part of geriatric oncology that should be integrated into 
everyday clinical practice.

A US Patient in Havana: Health Care the Cuban Way.

Kirkland D.

As a nurse and doctoral candidate, I learned from my research in and about Cuba 
that the country has an international reputation for having an excellent health 
system, providing universal care for its citizens, with major indicators-such as 
life expectancy-rivaling those of industrialized countries, including the USA. 
Little did I know that I would be accessing this health care system myself.

UK Medical Students' Experience of Culture & Communication in Cuban Health Care.

Levi J, Erbacher I.

Final-year medical students at UK universities are able to do elective 
placements elsewhere, to learn about other health care systems. We chose Cuba 
because of its excellent health outcomes despite relatively few resources. We 
were struck, for instance, when Cuba made global headlines in 2015 as the first 
country to eliminate mother-to-child transmission of HIV and syphilis. And, 
since the UK's underfunded National Health Service is experiencing high demand 
and increasing pressure, we sought to understand more about Cuba's socialist 
health system, where health care spending per capita is much lower than the 
UK's, but life expectancy is almost the same.

PURPOSE: Ageing in place is one of the greatest desires of elderly people. 
Assistive digital technologies could potentially delay the institutionalization 
of the elderly people and allow them ageing in place. This study develops a 
population-wide cost estimating framework for adopting digital technologies that 
can improve the quality of life of elderly people through examining an 
Australian region.
METHODS: We developed a five-stage cost estimation framework, which involved 
progressive forecasting of elderly population and direct cost estimation 
methods. The forecasting and cost estimation models have been set for a 10-year 
period because the prediction accuracy from cross-sectional data is better in 
the short to medium term compared to the long-term. For cost estimation, we 
categorised the ageing population on the basis of the number of chronic diseases 
that they have contracted. Costs of assistive technologies were collected from 
open sources. The model has been tested in the Fitzroy and Central West, a 
regional area of Queensland in Australia. A stakeholder panel discussion in a 
workshop format was used to validate the appropriateness of the proposed 
framework and the study findings.
RESULTS: This study identified eight common chronic diseases with different 
comorbidity patterns in Australia. We also identified the required assistive 
technologies to assist patients with chronic diseases. This study estimated that 
annual per capita cost for technological intervention could range from AUD 4,169 
to AUD 7,551 on the basis of different price margins of the technologies.
CONCLUSION: The approach of categorising the aged cohorts on the basis of the 
number of chronic diseases helps estimate population-wide costs compared to 
using single technology intervention costs for a particular chronic disease 
cohort. The cost estimation framework and the method developed in this study can 
assist the government to estimate costs for ageing-in-place programs.

RNA virus spillover from managed honeybees (Apis mellifera) to wild bumblebees 
(Bombus spp.).

The decline of many bumblebee species (Bombus spp.) has been linked to an 
increased prevalence of pathogens caused by spillover from managed bees. 
Although poorly understood, RNA viruses are suspected of moving from managed 
honeybees (Apis mellifera) into wild bumblebees through shared floral resources. 
We examined if RNA viruses spillover from managed honeybees, the extent to which 
viruses are replicating within bumblebees, and the role of flowers in 
transmission. Prevalence and active infections of deformed wing virus (DWV) were 
higher in bumblebees collected near apiaries and when neighboring honeybees had 
high infection levels. We found no DWV in bumblebees where honeybee foragers and 
honeybee apiaries were absent. The prevalence of black queen cell virus (BQCV) 
was also higher in bumblebees collected near apiaries. Furthermore, we detected 
viruses on 19% of flowers, all of which were collected within apiaries. Our 
results corroborate the hypothesis that viruses are spilling over from managed 
honeybees to wild bumblebees and that flowers may be an important route for 
transmission.

Thawed Cod Fillets Spoil Less Rapidly Than Unfrozen Fillets When Stored under 
Modified Atmosphere at 2°C.

The effect of two months of frozen storage at -20°C on the spoilage 
characteristics and shelf life of thawed and modified atmosphere packed (MAP) 
cod fillets stored at 2°C was studied. Thawed MAP cod fillets were compared with 
fresh cod fillets stored in CO2-containing modified atmospheres with and without 
added oxygen. The shelf life of 11 to 12 days in the fresh MAP cod was extended 
to more than 20 days in the thawed MAP cod at 2°C. This shelf life extension was 
most likely due to the inactivation of the spoilage bacterium Photobacterium 
phosphoreum during frozen storage as reflected both in Chemical analyses and 
sensory evaluation. In contrast to fresh MAP cod fillets no significant 
production of trimethylamine occurred and almost no amine odor and taste were 
detected during 20 days of chill storage of thawed MAP cod fillets. The use of 
frozen fillets as raw material not only provides a more stable product in MAP 
but also allows much greater flexibility for production and distribution. 
However, a slightly increased concentration of dimethylamine, a larger drip 
loss, and detection of weak frozen storage flavor were observed in the thawed 
MAP cod fillets.

Background and objectives: The purpose of the study is to correlate vascular 
calcification biomarkers osteoprotegerin (OPG) and 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 
(25-OH-D3), indicators of arterial stiffness carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity 
(c-f PWV) and renal resistive index (RRI), with parameters of left ventricular 
function in heart failure patients versus control. Materials and methods: Our 
case-control study compared 60 patients with ischemic heart failure and reduced 
left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (<40%) with a control group of 60 
healthy age-matched subjects (CON). Serum levels of OPG and 25-OH-D3 were 
determined by ELISA. Left ventricular volumes (LVESV, LVEDV) and LVEF were 
measured by echocardiography. C-f PWV was determined using the arteriograph 
device. RRI was measured by duplex Doppler. Peak systolic velocity (PSV) and 
minimum end-diastolic velocity (EDV) were determined using angle correction. The 
estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was calculated using the MDRD 
equation. The Pearson's correlation coefficient was used for interpretation of 
results. Results: OPG values were significantly higher in heart failure (HF) 
patients vs. CON (4.7 ± 0.25 vs. 1.3 ± 0.67 ng/mL, p < 0.001). 25-OH vitamin D3 
levels were significantly lower in HF patients vs. CON (20.49 ± 7.31 vs. 37.09 ± 
4.59 ng/mL, p < 0.001). Multiple regression analysis considering 25-OH D3 as a 
dependent variable demonstrated indicators of vascular stiffness RRI, c-f PWV 
and vascular calcification biomarker OPG as predictors. OPG values were 
significantly correlated with cardiac parameters LVEDV (r = 0.862, p < 0.001), 
LVEF (r = -0.832, p < 0.001), and c-f PWV(r = 0.833, p < 0.001), and also with 
25-OH-D3 (r = -0.636, p < 0.001). RRI values were significantly correlated with 
cardiac parameters LVEDV (r = 0.586, p < 0.001) and LVEF (r = -0.587, p < 
0.001), and with eGFR (r = -0.488, p < 0.001), c-f PWV(r = 0.640, p < 0.001), 
and 25-OH-D3 (r = -0.732, p < 0.001). Conclusions: This study showed significant 
correlations between vitamin D deficit and vascular stiffness indicators in 
heart failure patients with reduced ejection fraction, demonstrating the 
importance of these examinations for a better evaluation of these patients. 
Together with the evaluation of renal function, the measurement of vascular 
stiffness indicators and biomarkers might play a key role in identifying 
patients at greater risk for worsening disease prognosis and for shorter life 
expectancy, who could benefit from vitamin D supplementation. The abstract was 
accepted for presentation at the Congress of the European Society of Cardiology, 
Munich, 2018.

Dementia is one of the most frequent diseases of people aged 65 and older. As 
a result of the upcoming demographic transition, a significant increase is 
expected to the current number of around 1.7 million dementia patients. 
A precise estimate of this increase is especially important for decision-makers 
and payers to the health-care system. This study examined the effects of 
different assumptions on the future frequency of disease using a time-discrete 
Markov model with population-related and disease-specific components. Based on 
health insurers' administrative data from AOK Baden-Württemberg, we determined 
age- and gender-specific prevalence rates, incidence rates, and mortality 
differences of dementia patients and combined them with demographic components 
from German population statistics. As a result, our Markov model showed a 20 to 
25% higher number of dementia patients in 2030, compared to the results of the 
status quo projection applied in most previous studies, with the assumption of 
constant prevalence rates over time. Hence, our results indicate that even in 
the medium term payers will have to face significant increases in 
dementia-related health expenditures. By 2060, the number of dementia patients 
in Germany would rise to 3.3 million assuming a further increase to life 
expectancy and constant incidence rates over time. The assumption of 
a compression of the morbidity would reduce this number to 2.6 million.
