OBJECTIVES: To assess the cost-effectiveness of workplace-delivered 
interventions designed to reduce sitting time as primary prevention measures for 
cardiovascular disease (CVD) in Australia.
METHODS: A Markov model was developed to simulate the lifetime 
cost-effectiveness of a workplace intervention for the primary prevention of CVD 
amongst office-based workers. An updated systematic review and a meta-analysis 
of workplace interventions that aim to reduce sitting time was conducted to 
inform the intervention effect. The primary outcome was workplace standing time. 
An incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated for this 
intervention measured against current practice. Costs (in Australia dollars) and 
benefits were discounted at 3% annually. Both deterministic (DSA) and 
probabilistic (PSA) sensitivity analyses were performed.
RESULTS: The updated systematic review identified only one new study. Only the 
multicomponent intervention that included a sit-and-stand workstation showed 
statistically significant changes in the standing time compared to the control. 
The intervention was associated with both higher costs ($6820 versus $6524) and 
benefits (23.28 versus 23.27, quality-adjusted life year, QALYs), generating an 
ICER of $43,825/QALY. The DSA showed that target age group for the intervention, 
relative risk of CVD relative to the control and intervention cost were the key 
determinants of the ICER. The base case results were within the range of the 95% 
confidence interval and the intervention had a 85.2% probability of being 
cost-effective.
CONCLUSIONS: A workplace-delivered intervention in the office-based setting 
including a sit-and-stand desk component is a cost-effective strategy for the 
primary prevention of CVD. It offers a new option and location when considering 
interventions to target the growing CVD burden.

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective database analysis.
PURPOSE: To identify risk factors that predict mortality following acute spine 
fractures in geriatric patients of Singapore.
OVERVIEW OF LITERATURE: Acute geriatric spinal fractures contribute 
significantly to local healthcare costs and hospital admissions. However, 
geriatric mortality following acute spine fractures is scarcely assessed in the 
Asian population.
METHODS: Electronic records of 3,010 patients who presented to our hospital's 
emergency department and who were subsequently admitted during 2004-2015 with 
alleged history of traumatic spine fractures were retrospectively reviewed, and 
613 patients (mean age, 85.7±4.5 years; range, 80-101 years; men, 108; women, 
505) were shortlisted. Mortality rates were reviewed up to 1 year after 
admission and multivariate analyses were performed to identify independent risk 
factors correlating with mortality.
RESULTS: Women were more susceptible to spine fractures (82.4%), with falls 
(77.8%) being the most common mechanism of injury. Mortality rates were 6.0%, 
8.2%, and 10.4% at 3, 6, and 12 months, respectively. The most common causes of 
death at all 3 time points were pneumonia and ischemic heart disease. Based on 
the multivariate analysis at 1-year follow-up, elderly women had a lower 
mortality rate compared to men (p<0.001); mortality rates increased by 6.3% 
(p=0.024) for every 1-year increase in the patient's age; and patients with an 
American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) score of A-C had a much higher 
mortality rate compared to those with an ASIA score of D-E (p<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: An older age at presentation, male sex, and an ASIA score of A-C 
were identified as independent factors predicting increased mortality among 
geriatric patients who sustained acute spine fractures. The study findings 
highlight at-risk groups for acute spine fractures, thereby providing an 
opportunity to develop strategies to increase the life expectancy of these 
patients.

Background Cardiovascular mortality is the leading contributor to the shortened 
life expectancy in patients with severe mental illness (SMI), but efforts to 
predict cardiovascular outcomes in these patients have been lacking. In this 
study, we aimed to determine the severity of coronary artery calcification 
(CAC), and its effect on mortality rates in patients with SMI, compared with the 
general population. Methods All individuals with a registered cardiac computed 
tomography for calcium scoring in the Western Denmark Heart Registry, from 
January 1, 2008 to December 31, 2016, were included. We identified patients 
diagnosed with SMI ( International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision: 
F20, F30, F31), whereas the remaining individuals were used as a comparison 
group. Results Among 48 757 individuals, including 564 patients with SMI (1.2%), 
we found no difference in CAC score between patients with SMI and the comparison 
group. SMI patients with CAC >100 had an increased mortality rate (hazard ratio, 
3.16; 95% CI, 1.41-7.06), as well as SMI patients with CAC <100 (hazard ratio, 
3.95; 95% CI, 2.36-6.62), compared with the comparison group with CAC <100 as 
reference, adjusted for age, sex, and calendar period. Conclusions Patients with 
SMI have increased cardiovascular risks, but show no difference in CAC score, 
compared with the comparison group. Mortality rates were increased in patients 
with SMI, independent of CAC severity; however, the relatively large number of 
noncardiovascular causes of death in this sample might indicate other 
contributing factors to death than coronary artery disease in this sample of SMI 
patients.

In folate-mediated one-carbon metabolism (FOCM), 5-formyltetrahydrofolate 
(5fTHF), a one-carbon substituted tetrahydrofolate (THF) vitamer, acts as an 
intracellular storage form of folate and as an inhibitor of the folate-dependent 
enzymes phosphoribosylaminoimidazolecarboxamide formyltransferase (AICARFT) and 
serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT). Cellular levels of 5fTHF are regulated 
by a futile cycle comprising the enzymes SHMT and 5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolate 
synthetase (MTHFS). MTHFS is an essential gene in mice; however, the roles of 
both 5fTHF and MTHFS in mammalian FOCM remain to be fully elucidated. We present 
an extension of our previously published hybrid-stochastic model of FOCM by 
including the 5fTHF futile-cycle to explore its effect on the FOCM network. 
Model simulations indicate that MTHFS plays an essential role in preventing 
5fTHF accumulation, which consequently averts inhibition of all other reactions 
in the metabolic network. Moreover, in silico experiments show that 10-formylTHF 
inhibition of MTHFS is critical for regulating purine synthesis. Model 
simulations also provide evidence that 5-methylTHF (and not 5fTHF) is the 
predominant physiological binder/inhibitor of SHMT. Finally, the model 
simulations indicate that the 5fTHF futile cycle dampens the stochastic noise in 
FOCM that results from both folate deficiency and a common variant in the 
methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene.

Records of δ18O in stream flow are critical for understanding and modeling 
hydrological, ecological, biogeochemical and atmospheric processes. However, the 
number of such records are extremely limited globally and the length of such 
time series are usually less than a decade. This situation severely handicaps 
their use in model testing and evaluation. Here we present a global assessment 
of freshwater mollusk (bivalves & gastropods) isotope data from 25 river basins 
that have stream water isotope values, water temperature data and shell material 
isotope signatures. Our data span a latitude range of 37.50°S to 52.06°N. We 
show that δ18O signatures in freshwater mollusks are able to explain 95% of the 
variance of stream water δ18O. We use shell δ18O values and water temperature 
data to reconstruct stream water δ18O signatures. With freshwater mussel life 
expectancy ranging from a few years up to 200 years, this translation of mollusk 
metabolic properties into long term stream water isotope records is a promising 
approach for substantially extending global stream water isotope records in time 
and space.

Lynch syndrome (LS) is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder associated with 
germline mutations in DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes. The carriers of 
pathogenic mutations in these genes have an increased risk of developing a 
colorectal cancer and/or LS-associated cancer. The LS-associated cancer types 
include carcinomas of the endometrium, small intestine, stomach, pancreas and 
biliary tract, ovary, brain, upper urinary tract and skin. The criteria for the 
clinical diagnosis of LS and the procedures of the genetic testing for 
identification of pathogenetic mutations carriers in MMR genes have long been 
known. A crucial point in the mutation detection analysis is the correct 
definition of the pathogenecity associated with MMR genetic variants, especially 
in order to include the mutation carriers in the endoscopy surveillance programs 
more suited to them. Therefore, this may help to improve the LS-associated 
cancer prevention programs. In the present review, we also report the recent 
discoveries in molecular genetics of LS, such as the new roles of MMR protein 
and immune response of MMR repair deficiency in colorectal cancer. Finally, we 
discuss the main therapeutic approaches, including immunotherapy, which 
represent a valid alternative to traditional therapeutic methods and extend the 
life expectancy of patients that have already developed LS-associated colorectal 
cancer.

for Chronic Migraine Headaches.

    Aesthet Surg J. 2019 Nov 13;39(12):NP471-NP473.

BACKGROUND: Common treatments for chronic migraine headaches include injection 
of corticosteroid and anesthetic agents at local trigger sites. However, the 
effects of therapy are short term, and lifelong treatment is often necessary. In 
contrast, surgical decompression of migraine trigger sites accomplishes the same 
goal yet demonstrates successful long-term elimination of chronic migraines.
OBJECTIVES: Our primary objective was to perform a cost-utility analysis to 
determine which patients would benefit most from available treatment options in 
a cost-conscious model.
METHODS: A cost-utility analysis was performed, taking into consideration costs, 
probabilities, and health state utility scores of various interventions.
RESULTS: Injection therapy offered a minor improvement in quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs) compared with surgical decompression (QALY Δ = 0.6). However, 
long-term injection therapy was significantly costlier to society than surgical 
decompression: injection treatment was estimated to cost $106,887.96 more than 
surgery. The results of our cost-utility analysis thus conferred a positive 
incremental cost-utility ratio of $178,163.27 in favor of surgical 
decompression.
CONCLUSIONS: Surgery provides a durable intervention and has been shown in this 
study to be extremely cost effective despite a very minor QALY deficit compared 
with injection therapy. If patients are identified who require treatment in the 
form of injections for less than 8.25 years, they may fall into a group that 
should not be offered surgery.

[Rapid progressive glomerulonephritis].

[Article in German]

The rapid progressive glomerulonephritis is an emergency case. Renal function is 
rapidly lost within weeks or a few months (rarely within days) due to 
necrotizing extracapillary proliferative crescentic glomerulonephritis. Early 
diagnosis and treatment improve prognosis, as the best prognostic marker is 
creatinine when treatment is initiated. Three classes can be distinguished by 
immunofluorescence in histology. Firstly, there are no or only few 
immunoglobulins found (anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody [ANCA]-associated 
vasculitis). Secondly, there is linear immunofluorescence due to antibodies 
against the glomerular basement membrane (anti-glomerular basement membrane 
[GBM] disease or Goodpasture syndrome); and thirdly, there is a granular pattern 
of immunoglobulin deposition (for example systemic lupus erythematosus [SLE], 
Schoenlein-Henoch purpura or cryoglobulinaemia). The immunosuppressive 
repertoire has improved (such as induction therapy in ANCA-associated vasculitis 
with lower total steroid dose, cyclophosphamide pulses or rituximab). New 
treatment approaches are on their way and the prognosis regarding life 
expectancy and renal function has improved. There are still challenging 
questions to answer like treatment duration and markers of recurrence.

HIV infection in the combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) era has become a 
chronic disease with a life expectancy almost identical to those free from this 
infection. Concomitantly, chronic diseases such as neurodegenerative diseases 
have emerged as serious clinical problems. HIV-induced cognitive changes, 
although clinically very diverse are collectively called HIV-associated 
neurocognitive disorder (HAND). HAND, which until the introduction of cART 
manifested clinically as a subcortical disorder, is now considered primarily 
cognitive disorder, which makes it similar to diseases like Alzheimer's (AD) and 
Parkinson's disease (PD). The pathogenesis involves either the direct effects of 
the virus or the effect of viral proteins such as Tat, Ggp120, and Nef. These 
proteins are either capable of destroying neurons directly by inducing 
neurotoxic mediators or by initiating neuroinflammation by microglia and 
astrocytes. Recently, it has become recognized that HIV infection is associated 
with increased production of the beta-amyloid peptide (Aβ) which is a 
characteristic of AD. Moreover, amyloid plaques have also been demonstrated in 
the brains of patients suffering from HAND. Thus, the question arises whether 
this production of Aβ indicates that HAND may lead to AD or it is a form of AD 
or this increase in Aβ production is only a bystander effect. It has also been 
discovered that APP in HIV and its metabolic product Aβ in AD manifest antiviral 
innate immune peptide characteristics. This review attempts to bring together 
studies linking amyloid precursor protein (APP) and Aβ production in HIV 
infection and their possible impact on the course of HAND and AD. These data 
indicate that human defense mechanisms in HAND and AD are trying to contain 
microorganisms by antimicrobial peptides, however by employing different means. 
Future studies will, no doubt, uncover the relationship between HAND and AD and, 
hopefully, reveal novel treatment possibilities.

Male urinary incontinence is highly prevalent, leading to a miserable quality of 
life. The artificial urinary sphincter (AUS) is the device that closely 
simulates the function of the biological urinary sphincter. The precise 
evaluation of occlusion mechanisms and of interaction phenomena occurring 
between AUS cuff and urethral duct is fundamental for more reliable design. The 
action induced in the interaction with urethral duct under a specific pressure 
depends on its constitutive material and structural characteristics. The methods 
of experimental and computational bioengineering are exploited to investigate 
mechanical functionality of the coupled system, as AUS and urethral duct. 
Experimental tests are developed to investigate the response when the AUS is 
inflated around a urethral phantom. Numerical model of the cuff is developed 
mimicking the experimental tests for the validation. Subsequently, numerical 
models are exploited to interpret the interaction of the cuff with urethral 
phantoms considering the influence of urethral size and of tissues mechanical 
behavior, mimicking healthy and degraded configurations. The investigation 
provides useful information on the behavior of AUS cuff with urethral duct 
evaluating the action induced and represents a support for planning an extension 
of experimental tests on animal and human urethral samples.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The impact of tobacco control on European older adults has 
not been studied, despite evidence that smoking cessation at old age can bring 
significant life expectancy gains. Our aim was to evaluate the impact of tobacco 
control policies on smoking among older adults in Europe from 2004 to 2013.
DESIGN: We used longitudinal data from the Survey of Health, Ageing and 
Retirement in Europe (SHARE, aged 50+ years) from four waves from 2004 to 2013. 
We used logistic regression models with clustered standard errors to determine 
whether the implementation of tobacco control policies was associated with 
changes in smoking status. Furthermore, we studied whether these associations 
varied by socio-demographic characteristics. Regression coefficients were 
converted to changes the probability of smoking [marginal effects (ME)].
MEASUREMENTS: Smoking status was the dependent variable, and the Tobacco Control 
Scale (TCS) was the explanatory variable, overall and by its main policy 
components (pricing and smoke-free policies). Covariates included age, sex, 
education and country and wave fixed-effects.
FINDINGS: A 10-point increase in TCS was associated with a lower probability of 
smoking by 1.6 percentage points [95% confidence interval (CI) = -3.208, -0.056] 
for those aged 50-65, but not for older Europeans. Among those with primary 
school or no education, the associated drop was of 1.5 percentage points (95% 
CI = -2.751, -0.253). By contrast, no significant relation between TCS and 
smoking was observed among those with high education. Higher TCS scores for 
pricing (ME = -0.636, 95% CI = -0.998, -0.275) and smoke-free policies 
(ME = -0.243, 95% CI = -0.445, -0.041) were associated with a significantly 
lower probability of smoking (P = 0.001 and P = 0.018, respectively).
CONCLUSION: Increases in tobacco taxes and smoke-free policies are significantly 
related with a reduction in smoking among European older adults, suggesting 
potential health gains for this rising share of the population. These policies 
may be more effective among the lowest educated.

AIM: Increased life expectancy causes a higher prevalence of chronic and 
degenerative diseases, and greater frailty among older people. Hip fracture is a 
common event for older people, and 1-year mortality after hip fracture is high. 
The present study was carried out in the Abruzzo region, Italy, over the years 
from 2006 to 2015, entailing as its main objectives the assessment of age and 
sex-specific trends in the incidence of hip fractures, with the subsequent 
hospital mortality. Causes of 30-day hospital readmissions were assessed.
METHODS: Data were collected from all hospital discharge records. Information on 
all 30-day readmissions was also retrieved.
RESULTS: Overall, 23 075 patients were admitted to hospital for hip fracture 
(mean age 81.0 ± 11.7 years,72.6% women). The overall hip fracture incidence 
remained constant over the study period, varying from 175.9 cases in 2006 to 
179.3 cases per 100 000 in 2015. However, the incidence progressively increased 
from 40.0 to 51.0 among men, and from 61.6 to 80.9 among patients aged 
>85 years. The in-hospital mortality rate was 3.8%. Within 30 days from the hip 
fracture discharge, 10 526 patients (45.6%) had a second hospitalization, 
related to the condition of interest in >80% of the patients. Additionally, 414 
(3.9%) patients died during the second hospitalization.
CONCLUSIONS: Although women aged >65 years remain the category of patients at 
highest risk of hip fracture, an increasing trend is observed among men and 
patients aged >85 years. Hip fracture is frequently associated with early 
hospital readmission and is responsible for elevated in-hospital mortality.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate views, determinants and barriers to end-of-life 
discussions for doctors, nurses and members of the public (MoP) and their 
acceptability of risk prediction tools.
METHODS: Concurrent surveys of 360 doctors and nurses and 497 MoP.
RESULTS: Sixty per cent of clinicians reported high confidence in initiating 
end-of-life discussions, and 55.8% regularly engaged in them. Barriers to 
end-of-life communication reported by clinicians were uncertainty on the likely 
time to death (44.7%) and family requests to withhold information from patients 
(44.2%). By contrast, most (92.8%) MoP wanted information about life expectancy; 
89.9% wanted involvement in treatment decisions if the likelihood of death was 
high; and 23.8% already had an advance care directive.
CONCLUSIONS: A dissonance exists between doctor/nurses perception of older 
peoples' preference for receiving prognostic information and the public desire 
for involvement in decision-making at the end of life. As public attitudes 
change, strategies for greater involvement of patients in shared end-of-life 
planning are warranted.

BACKGROUND: Skull base meningioma management is complicated by their proximity 
to intracranial neurovascular structures because complete resection may pose a 
risk of worsening morbidity.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the influence of clinical outcomes and surgical management 
on patient-perceived quality-of-life outcomes, value, and cost-effectiveness.
METHODS: Patients who underwent resection of a skull base meningioma, had 
adequate clinical follow-up, and completed EQ-5D-3L questionnaires 
preoperatively and at 1 mo and 1 yr postoperatively were identified in a 
retrospective review. Cost data from the Value Driven Outcomes database were 
analyzed.
RESULTS: A total of 52 patients (83.0% women, mean age 51.9 yr) were categorized 
by worsened (n = 7), unchanged (n = 24), or improved (n = 21) EQ-5D-3L index 
scores at 1-mo follow-up. No difference in subcategory cost contribution or 
total cost was seen in the 3 groups. Patients with improved scores showed a 
steady improvement through each follow-up period, whereas those with unchanged 
or worsened scores did not. Mean quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and cost 
per QALY improved for all groups but at a higher rate for patients with better 
outcomes at 30-d follow-up. Female sex, absence of proptosis, nonfrontotemporal 
approaches, no optic nerve decompression, and absence of surgical complications 
demonstrated improved EQ-5D-3L scores at 1-yr follow-up. A mean cost per QALY of 
$27 731.06 ± 22 050.58 was observed for the whole group and did not 
significantly differ among patient groups (P = .1).
CONCLUSION: Patients undergoing resection of skull base meningiomas and who 
experience an immediate improvement in EQ-5D are likely to show continued 
improvement at 1 yr, with improved QALY and reduced cost per QALY.

BACKGROUND: Advances in medical technology have resulted in an increased life 
expectancy in pediatric patients with congenital heart diseases. Assessment of 
health-related quality of life is crucial to improving their healthcare status. 
We aimed to assess post-surgical pain prevalence and its impact on 
health-related quality of life in pediatric patients who underwent cardiac 
surgery during childhood.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study recruited patients aged 4 years or older who 
underwent cardiac surgery for congenital heart disease at least 1 year prior, 
during the age of 0-10 years, and were admitted for post-surgical follow-up at 
our institute. The prevalence, intensity, and location of pain and 
health-related quality of life were assessed in an interview. Perioperative 
information was collected from the patients' medical records. Health-related 
quality of life was assessed using the Pediatric quality of life inventory 4.0 
(PedsQL).
RESULTS: Pain was reported by 24 (17%) of the 141 participants. One-third of 
them reported moderate to severe pain that required medical intervention. After 
adjustment for several confounding factors, multivariable linear regression 
analysis demonstrated that the presence of pain and the number of surgeries were 
associated with lower total PedsQL scores.
CONCLUSIONS: Pain was present in 17% of the patients who underwent cardiac 
surgery during childhood. Presence of pain had a negative impact on long-term 
health-related quality of life after pediatric cardiac surgery.

PEGylation is the most widely used half-life extension strategy for protein 
therapeutics. While it imparts a range of attractive attributes PEGylation can 
impede protein binding and reduce efficacy. A model system to probe the effects 
of PEGylation on protein binding has practical applications. Here, we present a 
system based on complex formation between a hexavalent lectin (RSL) and the 
globular polysaccharide Ficoll PM70 (a type of glycocluster). Mutants of the 
lectin were used to generate conjugates with 3, 6, or 12 PEG (1 kDa) chains. 
Using NMR spectroscopy we monitored how the degree of PEGylation impacted the 
lectin-Ficoll interaction. The binding propensity was observed to decrease with 
increasing polymer density. Apparently, the extended PEG chains sterically 
impede the lectin-Ficoll binding. This deduction was supported by molecular 
dynamics simulations of the protein-polymer conjugates. The implications for 
protein-surface interactions are discussed.

OBJECTIVES: To report the results of health economic analyses comparing two 
treatment approaches for chronic low back pain (CLBP).
DESIGN: Observational prospective cohort study comparing effectiveness and 
cost-effectiveness of CLBP care provided at an integrative care clinic with that 
provided in other clinics within the same hospital. CLBP-related medical 
utilization, function, quality of life, and days of work incapacity were 
self-reported at baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months.
SETTINGS/LOCATION: Osher Clinical Center (OCC) based at a tertiary academic 
hospital (Brigham and Women's Hospital [BWH]) and other clinics at BWH.
SUBJECTS: CLBP patients seeking care at OCC or non-OCC BWH clinics.
INTERVENTIONS: Integrative or conventional care for CLBP as prescribed by the 
treating clinician(s).
OUTCOME MEASURES: Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were estimated per 
treatment approach based on the SF-12. Cost per QALY gained was evaluated using 
an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). ICERs based on CLBP-specific 
effectiveness measures (Roland Disability Questionnaire [RDQ] and bothersomeness 
of pain [BOP]) were exploratory outcomes.
RESULTS: Total adjusted annual CLBP-related costs per patient were greater in 
the OCC versus non-OCC group ($11,526.73 vs. $6,810.63). Between group 
differences in QALYs were small and ICER estimate of cost per QALY gained was 
high ($436,676). However, unadjusted mean direct costs per patient decreased 
over time in the OCC group. Savings in direct costs of $391 (95% confidence 
interval: -1,078 to 1,861) were observed in the OCC group for the 6- to 12-month 
period, driven primarily by reduced medication usage. ICERs based on adjusted 
RDQ and BOP group differences showed cost of $2,073 and $4,203 for a one-point 
reduction per respective scale.
CONCLUSIONS: When adjusted for baseline differences, self-reported costs were 
higher in the OCC group with only small effects on QALYs. However, trends toward 
decreased direct expenditures and medication usage over time warrant further 
investigation. Future studies evaluating potential benefits of integrative care 
models for the management of CLBP should employ randomized designs, longer 
observational periods, and explore multiple metrics of cost-effectiveness.

Nutritional stress targets LeishIF4E-3 to storage granules that contain RNA and 
ribosome components in Leishmania.

Leishmania parasites lack pathways for de novo purine biosynthesis. The 
depletion of purines induces differentiation into virulent metacyclic forms. In 
vitro, the parasites can survive prolonged periods of purine withdrawal changing 
their morphology to long and slender cells with an extended flagellum, and 
decreasing their translation rates. Reduced translation leads to the appearance 
of discrete granules that contain LeishIF4E-3, one of the six eIF4E paralogs 
encoded by the Leishmania genome. We hypothesize that each is responsible for a 
different function during the life cycle. LeishIF4E-3 is a weak cap-binding 
protein paralog, but its involvement in translation under normal conditions 
cannot be excluded. However, in response to nutritional stress, LeishIF4E-3 
concentrates in specific cytoplasmic granules. LeishIF4E-3 granulation can be 
induced by the independent elimination of purines, amino acids and glucose. As 
these granules contain mature mRNAs, we propose that these bodies store inactive 
transcripts until recovery from stress occurs. In attempt to examine the content 
of the nutritional stress-induced granules, they were concentrated over sucrose 
gradients and further pulled-down by targeting in vivo tagged LeishIF4E-3. 
Proteomic analysis highlighted granule enrichment with multiple ribosomal 
proteins, suggesting that ribosome particles are abundant in these foci, as 
expected in case of translation inhibition. RNA-binding proteins, RNA helicases 
and metabolic enzymes were also enriched in the granules, whereas no degradation 
enzymes or P-body markers were detected. The starvation-induced 
LeishIF4E-3-containing granules, therefore, appear to store stalled ribosomes 
and ribosomal subunits, along with their associated mRNAs. Following nutritional 
stress, LeishIF4E-3 becomes phosphorylated at position S75, located in its 
less-conserved N-terminal extension. The ability of the S75A mutant to form 
granules was reduced, indicating that cellular signaling regulates LeishIF4E-3 
function.

In plants, myo-inositol-1,2,3,4,5,6-hexakisphosphate (InsP6), also known as 
phytic acid (PA), is a major component of organic phosphorus (P), and accounts 
for up to 85% of the total P in seeds. In rice (Oryza sativa L.), PA mainly 
accumulates in rice bran, and chelates mineral cations, resulting in mineral 
deficiencies among brown rice consumers. Therefore, considerable efforts have 
been focused on the development of low PA (LPA) rice cultivars. In this study, 
we performed genetic and molecular analyses of OsLpa1, a major PA biosynthesis 
gene, in Sanggol, a low PA mutant variety developed via chemical mutagenesis of 
Ilpum rice cultivar. Genetic segregation and sequencing analyses revealed that a 
recessive allele, lpa1-3, at the OsLpa1 locus (Os02g0819400) was responsible for 
a significant reduction in seed PA content in Sanggol. The lpa1-3 gene harboured 
a point mutation (C623T) in the fourth exon of the predicted coding region, 
resulting in threonine (Thr) to isoleucine (Ile) amino acidsubstitution at 
position 208 (Thr208Ile). Three-dimensional analysis of Lpa1 protein structure 
indicated that myo-inositol 3-monophosphate [Ins(3)P1] could bind to the active 
site of Lpa1, with ATP as a cofactor for catalysis. Furthermore, the presence of 
Thr208 in the loop adjacent to the entry site of the binding pocket suggests 
that Thr208Ile substitution is involved in regulating enzyme activity via 
phosphorylation. Therefore, we propose that Thr208Ile substitution in lpa1-3 
reduces Lpa1 enzyme activity in Sanggol, resulting in reduced PA biosynthesis.

BACKGROUND: Despite the increased report of insecticide resistance in malaria 
vectors, its impact on mosquito's life-traits after exposure to 
insecticide-treated nets remains under investigated. Here, we assessed the 
effects of exposure to PermaNet 2.0 on several life traits of An. gambiae s.l. 
and An. funestus s.l. field mosquitoes in Cameroon.
METHODOLOGY: Female Anopheles mosquitoes were collected indoor using electric 
aspirators in southern Cameroon (Obout) in 2016. After assessing the resistance 
status of F1 from the field collected-mosquitoes, progeny of the first 
generation (An. funestus s.l.) and seventh generation (An. gambiae s.l.) were 
used to assess the long-term effect of exposure to PermaNet 2.0 on several 
life-traits of these vectors (longevity, blood feeding ability, fecundity and 
fertility) in comparison to untreated net. In addition, the L119F-GSTe2 mutation 
associated with DDT/pyrethroids resistance in An. funestus was genotyped to 
assess its association with increased life-span post-exposure.
PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Both An. funestus and An. gambiae were resistant to 
pyrethroids and DDT with a greater level in the latter. Pyrethroid-only nets 
PermaNet 2.0 (17.5% mortality) and Olyset (0% mortality) exhibited a 
significantly reduced efficacy against An. funestus in contrast to a greater 
efficacy for PBO-based Nets Olyset Plus (65% mortality), PermaNet 3.0 top (100% 
mortality). In both species, mosquitoes that survived exposure to PermaNet 2.0 
exhibited a significantly reduced longevity than those non-exposed (6.95 days vs 
12.46 for An. funestus P<0.001; 8.87 vs 11.25 days for An. gambiae; P<0.001). 
However, no significant difference was observed for blood feeding and fecundity 
in both species. In addition, molecular analysis of the L119F-GSTe2 mutation 
revealed that this mutation is associated with an increase in the chance of 
surviving after exposure to this net in An. funestus.
CONCLUSIONS: These results show that although the PermaNet 2.0 presents a 
reduced efficacy against resistant populations, it remains efficient after 
exposure by reducing the life expectancy of the vectors which could contribute 
in the reduction of malaria incidence.

BACKGROUND: Pneumonia is a serious disease associated with mortality among 
patients with dementia. However, the reported frequency of pneumonia as a cause 
of death in patients with dementia varies, the reason for which has not been 
fully elucidated.
METHODS: We conducted a systematic search in PubMed and the Cochrane Database of 
Systematic Reviews (inception to December 2016). Two authors independently 
determined the suitability of studies and potential bias and extracted the data. 
The primary outcome was frequency of pneumonia-associated death in patients with 
dementia. Stratified subgroup analysis was conducted among studies grouped 
according to type of mortality cause (immediate or underlying), information 
source of mortality cause (autopsy or death certificate), and study setting 
(clinic, hospital, or nursing home).
RESULTS: We included 7 studies reporting the cause of death among patients with 
dementia and 12 studies comparing the cause of death among patients with and 
without dementia. The frequency of pneumonia-associated death among 19 eligible 
studies was 29.69% (95% confidence interval [CI], 25.86-33.53). Those 
frequencies differed according to whether the source for information about cause
