Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.

Mesothelioma is a malignancy of serosal membranes. It is most commonly 
encountered in the visceral pleura with the second most common location in the 
peritoneum. The diagnosis is very rare and has been linked to toxic exposure to 
industrial pollutants, especially asbestos. Malignant peritoneal mesothelioma 
(MPM) commonly presents with diffuse, extensive spread throughout the abdomen 
with rare metastatic spread beyond the abdominal cavity. Due to its rarity and 
nonspecific symptoms, it is usually diagnosed late when the disease burden is 
extensive. Because pleural mesothelioma is more common than MPM, most research 
has been on the pleural variant and extrapolated for MPM. While treatment 
advances have been made for MPM, the disease is universally fatal from either 
abdominal complications secondary to the spread of disease or starvation. 
Untreated, the life expectancy is less than a year. Cytoreductive surgery (CRS) 
with heated intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) has become the mainstay of 
therapy with systemic therapies still being developed. We will review the 
epidemiology of MPM and discuss diagnostic and treatment strategies.

Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) are defined as focal dilatations of the 
abdominal aorta that are 50% greater than the proximal normal segment or when it 
is more than 3 cm in maximum diameter. The early diagnosis and treatment is very 
important to prevent catastrophic complications. Due to its ability to assess 
the peri-aortic soft tissue and the exact extension of aneurysm, as well as its 
excellent vascular opacification and multiplanar reconstruction capabilities, 
computed tomography angiography (CTA) has become an integral part of the 
evaluation of AAA and has virtually replaced conventional angiography for the 
evaluation of AAA. Knowledge of the characteristic imaging features of AAA is 
essential for the prompt diagnosis of life-threatening complications. In this 
pictorial essay, we will discuss the CTA findings in AAA and its complications 
including rupture, infection, aorto-enteric fistula and aorto-caval fistula.

PURPOSE: In low- and middle-income, HIV-endemic regions of sub-Saharan Africa, 
morbidity and mortality from the common epithelial cancers of the developed 
world are rising. Even among HIV-infected individuals, access to antiretroviral 
therapy has enhanced life expectancy, shifting the distribution of cancer 
diagnoses toward non-AIDS-defining malignancies, including breast cancer. 
Building on our prior research, we recently initiated the South African Breast 
Cancer and HIV Outcomes study.
METHODS: We will recruit a cohort of 3,000 women newly diagnosed with breast 
cancer at hospitals in high (average, 20%) HIV prevalence areas, in 
Johannesburg, Durban, Pietermaritzburg, and Empangeni. At baseline, we will 
collect information on demographic, behavioral, clinical, and other factors 
related to access to health care. Every 3 months in year 1 and every 6 months 
thereafter, we will collect interview and chart data on treatment, symptoms, 
cancer progression, comorbidities, and other factors. We will compare survival 
rates of HIV-infected and uninfected women with newly diagnosed breast cancer 
and their likelihood of receiving suboptimal anticancer therapy. We will 
identify determinants of suboptimal therapy and context-specific modifiable 
factors that future interventions can target to improve outcomes. We will 
explore molecular mechanisms underlying potentially aggressive breast cancer in 
both HIV-infected and uninfected patients, as well as the roles of pathogens, 
states of immune activation, and inflammation in disease progression.
CONCLUSION: Our goals are to contribute to development of evidence-based 
guidelines for the management of breast cancer in HIV-positive women and to 
improve outcomes for all patients with breast cancer in resource-constrained 
settings.

Over the past 20 years, cancer treatments have become more effective, leading to 
significant improvements in survival rates. However, anticancer drugs can have 
several possible cardiovascular side effects; in particular, the development of 
left ventricular dysfunction with chemoradiation therapy can negatively affect 
patients' cardiac outcome, and can limit anticancer treatments. This is an 
ongoing issue that will continue to persist, due to the ongoing development of 
new antitumor agents with potential cardiotoxic effects, and the prolonged life 
expectancy of long-term cancer survivors. Thus, the need for cooperation between 
oncologists and cardiologists in the management of cancer patients has led to 
the development of a new medical discipline-cardio-oncology-where the issue of 
cardiotoxicity is a topic of intense interest and research. However, several 
issues remain-the proper definition and diagnosis of cardiotoxicity, as well as 
monitoring and treatment strategies. In this review, the current advances in 
cardio-oncology, limitations of current approaches, and future research fields 
will be discussed.

We present a mathematical simplification for the evolutionary dynamics of a 
heritable trait within a two-sex population. This trait is assumed to control 
the timing of sex-specific life-history events, such as the age of sexual 
maturity and end of female fertility, and each sex has a distinct fitness 
trade-off associated with the trait. We provide a formula for the fitness 
landscape of the population and show a natural extension of the result to an 
arbitrary number of heritable traits. Our method can be viewed as a dynamical 
systems generalisation of the Price equation to include two sexes, age structure 
and multiple traits. We use this formula to examine the effect of 
grandmothering, whereby post-fertile females subsidise their daughter's 
fertility by provisioning grandchildren. Grandmothering can drive a shift 
towards increasingly male-biased mating sex ratios due to a post-fertile life 
stage in females, while male fertility continues to older ages. Our fitness 
landscapes show a net increase in fitness for both males and females at longer 
lifespans, and as a result, we find that grandmothering alone provides an 
evolutionary trajectory to higher longevities.

OBJECTIVES: We aimed to develop a model to predict long-term mortality after 
percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), to aid in selecting patients with 
sufficient life expectancy to benefit from bioabsorbable scaffolds.
BACKGROUND: Clinical trials are currently designed to demonstrate superiority of 
bioabsorbable scaffolds over metal devices up to 5 years after implantation.
METHODS: From 2000 to 2011, 19.532 consecutive patients underwent PCI in a 
tertiary referral hospital. Patients were randomly (2:1) divided into a training 
(N = 13,090) and validation (N = 6,442) set. Cox regression was used to identify 
determinants of long-term mortality in the training set and used to develop a 
risk model. Model performance was studied in the training and validation 
dataset.
RESULTS: Median age was 63 years (IQR 54-72) and 72% were men. Median follow-up 
was 3.6 years (interquartile range [IQR] 2.4-6.8). The ratio elective vs. 
non-elective PCIs was 42/58. During 88,620 patient-years of follow-up, 3,156 
deaths occurred, implying an incidence rate of 35.6 per 1,000. Estimated 5-year 
mortality was 12.9%.Regression analysis revealed age, body mass index, diabetes 
mellitus, renal insufficiency, prior myocardial infarction, PCI indication, 
lesion location, number of diseased vessels and cardiogenic shock at 
presentation as determinants of mortality. The long-term risk model showed good 
discrimination in the training and validation sets (c-indices 0.76 and 0.74), 
whereas calibration was appropriate.
CONCLUSIONS: A simple risk model, containing 9 baseline clinical and 
angiographic variables effectively predicts long-term mortality after PCI and 
may possibly be used to select suitable patients for bioabsorbable scaffolds.

Hydraulic redistribution (HR), the movement of water from wet to dry patches in 
the soil via roots, occurs in different ecosystems and plant species. By 
extension of the principle that HR is driven by gradients in soil water 
potential, HR has been proposed to occur for plants in saline soils. Despite the 
inherent spatial patchiness and salinity gradients in these soils, the lack of 
direct evidence of HR in response to osmotic gradients prompted us to ask the 
question: are there physical or physiological constraints to HR for plants in 
saline environments? We propose that build-up of ions in the root xylem sap and 
in the leaf apoplast, with the latter resulting in a large predawn 
disequilibrium of water potential in shoots compared with roots and soil, would 
both impede HR. We present a conceptual model that illustrates how processes in 
root systems in heterogeneous salinity with water potential gradients, even if 
equal to those in non-saline soils, will experience a dampened magnitude of 
water potential gradients in the soil-plant continuum, minimizing or preventing 
HR. Finally, we provide an outlook for understanding the relevance of HR for 
plants in saline environments by addressing key research questions on plant 
salinity tolerance.

BACKGROUND: Intraoperative nerve monitoring (IONM) provides dynamic neural 
information and is recommended for high-risk thyroid surgery. In this analysis, 
the cost-effectiveness of IONM in preventing bilateral recurrent laryngeal nerve 
(RLN) injury was investigated.
METHODS: A Markov chain model was constructed based on IONM use. The base-case 
patient was defined as a 40-year-old woman presenting with a 4·1-cm left-sided 
papillary thyroid cancer who developed RLN injury with loss of monitoring signal 
during planned bilateral thyroidectomy. It was hypothesized that, if the surgeon 
had used IONM, the RLN injury would have been detected and the operation would 
have been concluded as a thyroid lobectomy to avoid the risk of contralateral 
RLN injury. Cost in US dollars was converted to euros; probabilities and utility 
scores were identified from the literature and government resources. Length of 
follow-up was set as 20 years, and willingness-to-pay (WTP) as €38 000 (US $50 
000) per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY).
RESULTS: At the end of year 20, the not using IONM strategy accrued €163 995·40 
(US $215 783·43) and an effectiveness of 14·15 QALYs, whereas use of the IONM 
strategy accrued €170 283·68 (US $224 057·48) and an effectiveness of 14·33 
QALYs. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, comparing use versus no use of 
IONM, was €35 285·26 (US $46 427·97) per QALY, which is below the proposed WTP, 
indicating that IONM is the preferred and cost-effective management plan. A 
Monte Carlo simulation test that considered variability of the main study 
factors in a hypothetical sample of 10 000 patients showed IONM to be the 
preferred strategy in 85·8 per cent of the population.
CONCLUSION: Use of IONM is cost-effective in patients undergoing bilateral 
thyroid surgery.

The prostate commonly develops benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) in dogs over 5 
years, while in aged dogs other pathological findings might be revealed by 
ultrasonographic exam. The aim of the present study was to estimate the most 
suitable age for a preventive ultrasonographic examination of the prostate in 
the dog. The prostate of 1003 intact male dogs of 64 different breeds, of 
different ages (1-18 years) and bodyweights (2-55 kg) was evaluated with 
ultrasound, irrespective of the reason for clinical examination. The age of each 
dog was expressed as the ratio between the actual age and the maximum longevity 
expected for the breed. Dogs were divided in two groups based on breeds' life 
expectancy as short life (SL) and long life (LL). The size of the prostate 
(normal, enlarged or small) and the presence of abnormal sonographic findings 
were recorded for each dog. The results of the present study indicate that the 
most suitable age for a preventive ultrasonographic exam of the prostate in the 
dog is approximately at 40% of its expected longevity, both in short and long 
life breeds, because at this age there is a strong possibility to be able to 
detect abnormal prostatic findings. In 47.5% of the dogs at least one abnormal 
finding of the prostate was revealed by ultrasonographic exam, while dogs with 
long life expectancy showed a significantly higher prevalence of abnormalities, 
than dogs with short life expectancy. The most frequent findings were the 
increase of prostatic size (33.5%) and the presence of at least one cyst 
(33.6%), with no difference between SL and LL dogs. In conclusion, a preventive 
examination of the prostate starting at 40% of expected longevity in dogs of 
short and long life breeds is strongly recommended for early detection of 
abnormalities, for scheduling specific follow up and for suggesting effective 
therapeutic protocols.

The aim of this study was to compare the public health impact of introducing 2 
Herpes Zoster (HZ) vaccines, Zoster Vaccine Live (ZVL) versus a non-live 
adjuvanted subunit candidate vaccine (HZ/su), in the German population aged 50+ 
years split into 3 age cohorts, i.e. 50-59, 60-69 and 70+ years, respectively. A 
multi-cohort static Markov model was developed following age cohorts over their 
lifetime. Demographic data were obtained from the German federal statistical 
office. HZ incidence and the proportion of HZ individuals developing 
post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN) were derived from German specific sources. 
Age-specific vaccine efficacy and waning rates were based on published clinical 
trial data. Vaccine coverage for both vaccines was assumed to be 40%, with 
compliance of the second dose of the HZ/su vaccine of 70%. Sensitivity analyses 
were performed to assess the robustness of the results. It was estimated that, 
over the remaining lifetime since vaccination, the HZ/su vaccine would reduce 
the number of HZ cases by 725,233, 533,162 and 486,794 in the 3 age cohorts, 
respectively, compared with 198,477, 196,000 and 104,640, using ZVL. The number 
needed to vaccinate (NNV) to prevent one HZ case ranged from 8 to 11 using the 
HZ/su vaccine compared with 20 to 50 using ZVL. Corresponding NNV to prevent one 
PHN case ranged from 39 to 53 using the HZ/su vaccine compared with 94 to 198 
using ZVL. Due to the higher, sustained vaccine efficacy, the candidate HZ/su 
vaccine demonstrated superior public health impact compared with ZVL.

The springtail Collembola are characterized by having rolled spermatozoa, with a 
long cylindrical extracellular structure adhering to the acrosome. This 
structure is produced by the secretory activity of the testes epithelial cells 
at almost the end of spermiogenesis. At the beginning of its formation, it is a 
thin extension with a helical wall and a dense axial region. Later the 
cylindrical structure shows an inner organization which is different in the 
several species examined: species of Entomobryidae contain material with a 
paracrystalline structure, whilst some of Symphypleona contain ovoid structures. 
The outer envelope of the extracellular structure consists of two overlapped 
layers orthogonally arranged, clearly identified by cryo-preparations. 
Immunoblot analysis and lectin stainings have indicated that the cylindrical 
structure has a glycoproteic composition. As the structure is no longer visible 
after the sperm transfer into the female spermatheca, it is suggested that it 
could contain enzymes able to activate the sperm unwinding process and possibly 
allowing the reacquisition of sperm motility.

OBJECTIVES: Psychotic patients have poorer health behaviours, including poor 
diets and sedentary lifestyles increasing their risk for obesity, diabetes, 
hypertension, and dyslipidaemia, and tend to have a shorter life expectancy as 
compared to nonpsychiatric populations. Lifestyle intervention programmes that 
target modifiable risk factors in such patients have produced uneven results. 
The objective was to evaluate the efficacy of a package of health promotion 
strategies to improve diet and physical exercise in psychotic patients. Our 
hypothesis was that a pre- to post-treatment improvement in physical activity 
and dietary habits would occur in the group receiving intervention.
METHOD: This randomised controlled trial was carried out in four psychiatric 
services. The intervention included psychoeducation sessions on diet and 
physical activity and regular participation in walking groups (experimental 
group). The control group received routine treatment. The primary outcome was an 
improvement of at least one World Health Organization recommendation on diet and 
exercise.
RESULTS: Of a total of 326 subjects recruited, 169 were randomly assigned to the 
experimental group and 157 to the control group. An improvement in one or more 
World Health Organization criteria over baseline was observed in 25.4% of 
experimental group subjects and in 12.2% of control group subjects (odds ratio 
2.46, 95% confidence interval 1.22-4.97; p=0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: A statistically significant proportion of the sample achieved 
post-treatment improvement in lifestyle habits, especially as regarded increased 
physical activity. A post-intervention reduction in lifestyle variability was 
also noted. Interventions directly addressing dietary habits may be desirable in 
psychotic patients.

Good health while aging depends upon optimal cellular and organ functioning that 
contribute to the regenerative ability of the body during the lifespan, 
especially when injuries and diseases occur. Although diet may help in the 
maintenance of cellular fitness during periods of stability or modest decline in 
the regenerative function of an organ, this approach is inadequate in an aged 
system, in which the ability to maintain homeostasis is further challenged by 
aging and the ensuing suboptimal functioning of the regenerative unit, 
tissue-specific stem cells. Focused nutritional approaches can be used as an 
intervention to reduce decline in the body's regenerative capacity. This article 
brings together nutrition-associated therapeutic approaches with the fields of 
aging, immunology, neurodegenerative disease, and cancer to propose ways in 
which diet and nutrition can work with standard-of-care and integrated medicine 
to help improve the brain's function as it ages. The field of regenerative 
medicine has exploded during the past 2 decades as a result of the discovery of 
stem cells in nearly every organ system of the body, including the brain, where 
neural stem cells persist in discrete areas throughout life. This fact, and the 
uncovering of the genetic basis of plasticity in somatic cells and cancer stem 
cells, open a door to a world where maintenance and regeneration of organ 
systems maintain health and extend life expectancy beyond its present limits. An 
area that has received little attention in regenerative medicine is the 
influence on regulatory mechanisms and therapeutic potential of nutrition. We 
propose that a strong relation exists between brain regenerative medicine and 
nutrition and that nutritional intervention at key times of life could be used 
to not only maintain optimal functioning of regenerative units as humans age but 
also play a primary role in therapeutic treatments to combat injury and diseases 
(in particular, those that occur in the latter one-third of the lifespan).

PURPOSE AND HYPOTHESIS: The main purpose of the study is to put focus on the 
costs related to treating posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) injuries and the 
possible implications of chosen treatment strategy to the respective 
institutions and society.
METHODS: Costs of treating PCL injuries nonoperatively and for both 
single-bundle (SB) and double-bundle (DB) reconstruction were estimated. These 
costs were translated into equivalent quality-adjusted life years (QALY) given a 
threshold value of Euro (€) 70,000 per QALY. Expected gain in knee 
osteoarthritis outcome score (KOOS) quality of life (QoL) following surgery 
based on KOOS data from 112 patients was used as a basis for calculating the 
cost efficiency ratio.
RESULTS: The average calculated cost of nonoperative treatment was €3382. 
Incremental cost for SB PCLR was €8585 (154%) and another increment of €5220 
(61%) for DB PCLR using numbers from a European hospital. This is equivalent to 
increments of 0.074 (SB) and another 0.075 (DB) QALYs given the €70,000 
threshold. For DB to be as cost efficient as SB reconstruction, the incremental 
gain in KOOS QoL has to be at the same level as for SB reconstruction compared 
to nonoperative treatment.
CONCLUSION: Though surgical reconstruction adds a substantial cost to 
nonoperative treatment alone, it can be considered cost-effective. Double-bundle 
reconstruction is less cost efficient than SB reconstruction, but should 
probably still be considered the treatment of choice for certain patient 
categories. Randomized controlled trials looking at outcome following 
nonoperative, SB and DB PCL reconstruction are needed. The clinical relevance of 
this is that surgical reconstruction of PCL injuries is a cost-efficient 
treatment alternative in patients with an isolated PCL injury. This finding 
should be taken into consideration when deciding on how to treat these injuries.

The modulation of protein acetylation network is a promising strategy for life 
span extension and disease treatment (Sabari et al., 2016; Giblin et al., 2014) 
[1,2]. A variety of small molecules have been developed to target deacetylases, 
but extremely few of these molecules are capable of activating the mitochondrial 
NAD-dependent deacetylase sirtuin-3 (SIRT3) (Gertz and Steegborn, 2016; Scholz 
et al., 2015) [3,4]. Manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) is the major 
superoxide scavenger in mitochondria, whose activity is regulated by 
SIRT3-mediated deacetylation, particularly at the Lys68 site (Chen et al., 2011) 
[5]. To investigate the influence of Lys68 acetylation on MnSOD activity, we 
produced a mutant MnSOD protein-bearing N-acetyllysine (AcK) at its Lys68 
position through the genetic code expansion approach. We solved the crystal 
structure of this acetylated MnSOD (MnSODK68AcK), thus revealing the structural 
and electrostatic basis for the significant activity decrease upon Lys68 
acetylation. On the basis of an assay we developed for the SIRT3-mediated 
deacetylation of MnSODK68AcK, we identified a novel SIRT3 activator, 
7-hydroxy-3-(4'-methoxyphenyl) coumarin (C12), which binds to SIRT3 with high 
affinity and can promote the deacetylation and activation of MnSOD. C12 adds to 
the current repertoire of extremely few SIRT3 activators, which are potentially 
valuable for treating a wide array of diseases via modulating the cellular 
acetylome.

Comparing effectiveness and outcomes in asthma and cystic fibrosis.

As technology yields new treatments, pediatric pulmonologists need determine how 
best to use them and how to decide which ones are best for any specific group or 
individual patient. Physicians have always customized therapies based upon 
patient response, but the new concept of "Personalized (or precision) medicine" 
focuses attention to a greater degree on the individual needs of patients based 
on their genetic, biomarker, phenotypic, or psychosocial characteristics. The 
newly developed biologics for treatment of asthma and CFTR modulators for 
treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) highlight this newer approach. As we have more 
treatments available, new approaches to testing efficacy and effectiveness of 
these new therapies is necessary in order to efficiently bring them to market 
and compare their benefits in real world practice. While comparative 
effectiveness can be tested in pragmatic clinic trials, the most common 
approaches make use of observational data such as administrative databases and 
patient registries but their use for this is fraught with pitfalls that may or 
may not be methodologically surmountable. Once new therapies have been shown to 
be efficacious and effective, it is important to be cognizant of methods for 
ensuring that all patients actually receive the treatments that will be best for 
them. Comparisons of the effectiveness of clinical practice in the form of 
benchmarking is helpful for this, and consideration of costs and 
cost-effectiveness is essential to judging the best treatment for patients in a 
real-world setting.

OBJECTIVES: To quantify the potential value of new research in patients treated 
with thrombolytic treatment (tissue-type plasminogen activator [tPA]) in the 
4.5- to 6.0-hour time window after stroke onset and to determine the optimal 
size of a future trial using value of information analysis.
METHODS: Expected value of partial perfect and sample information (EVPPI and 
EVSI) analyses were conducted using a probabilistic Markov model. Data for 
modified Rankin Scale (mRS) distributions in patients 4.5 to 6.0 hours since 
stroke onset for tPA (n = 576) and placebo (n = 543) were obtained from pooled 
randomized controlled trials. EVSI was quantified with net monetary benefit 
(assuming willingness to pay for health as $100,000/QALY). We calculated 
discounted population-level EVSI by multiplying per-person EVSI by the annual 
number of eligible patients with stroke in the United States and assuming a 
10-year time frame of treatment use. Study costs were based on administrative 
costs and the costs of tPA.
RESULTS: The base-case lifetime cost-effectiveness analysis showed that tPA was 
dominated by placebo in this patient group. EVPPI for mRS distributions was 
$1003 per person. On the basis of EVSI, the optimal sample size of a new trial 
collecting data on tPA efficacy in these patients would be 5600 across study 
arms with expected population-level societal returns (EVSI minus study costs) of 
$68.7 million.
CONCLUSIONS: Expanding research attention to the 4.5- to 6.0-hour time window 
for tPA treatment of patients with acute ischemic stroke is justified because 
the expected returns are substantial. Even a relatively large trial in which 
more information on treatment efficacy on the basis of mRS scores is collected 
would represent good value for information.

Less Is More: Cross-Validation Testing of Simplified Nonlinear Regression Model 
Specifications for EQ-5D-5L Health State Values.

BACKGROUND: The conventional method for modeling of the five-level EuroQol 
five-dimensional questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L) health state values in national 
valuation studies is an additive 20-parameter main-effects regression model. 
Statistical models with many parameters are at increased risk of 
overfitting-fitting to noise and measurement error, rather than the underlying 
relationship.
OBJECTIVES: To compare the 20-parameter main-effects model to simplified, 
nonlinear, multiplicative regression models in terms of how accurately they 
predict mean values of out-of-sample health states.
METHODS: We used data from the Spanish, Singaporean, and Chinese EQ-5D-5L 
valuation studies. Four models were compared: an 8-parameter model with single 
parameter per dimension, multiplied by cross-dimensional parameters for levels 
2, 3, and 4; 9- and 11-parameter extensions with handling of differences in the 
wording of level 5; and the "standard" additive 20-parameter model. Fixed- and 
random-intercept variants of all models were tested using two cross-validation 
methods: leave-one-out at the level of valued health states, and of health state 
blocks used in EQ-5D-5L valuation studies. Mean absolute error, Lin concordance 
correlation coefficient, and Pearson R between observed health state means and 
out-of-sample predictions were compared.
RESULTS: Predictive accuracy was generally best using random intercepts. The 8-, 
9-, and 11-parameter models outperformed the 20-parameter model in predicting 
out-of-sample health states.
CONCLUSIONS: Simplified nonlinear regression models look promising and should be 
investigated further using other EQ-5D-5L data sets. To reduce the risk of 
overfitting, cross-validation is recommended to inform model selection in future 
EQ-5D valuation studies.

BACKGROUND: Hemodialysis dependence confers unique physiologic conditions. Prior 
reports of outcomes after infrainguinal open bypass operations in patients on 
hemodialysis have been based on relatively small sample institutional series. In 
this study, we evaluate long-term outcomes after open bypass operations in a 
large contemporary population-based cohort of hemodialysis patients. We studied 
all hemodialysis patients who underwent infrainguinal open operation using 
autogenous versus prosthetic conduits in the United States Renal Data System 
between January 2007 and December 2011.
METHODS: Univariate methods (χ2, analysis of variance) were used to compare the 
characteristics of the patient and type of bypass. Kaplan-Meier, univariate and 
multivariate logistic, and Cox regression analyses were used to evaluate 30-day 
postoperative outcomes as well as patency, limb salvage, and mortality in the 
long term.
RESULTS: There were 9,739 (autogenous: 59%, prosthetic: 49%) infrainguinal open 
bypass operations performed in this cohort. Of these, 4,717 (48%) were 
femoral-popliteal, 3,321 (34%) were femoral-tibial, and 1,701 (18%) were 
popliteal-tibial bypasses. Bypass operations were performed most commonly for 
critical limb ischemia (72%). Primary patency was 18% for both types of conduits 
at 5 years (P = .16). Comparing autogenous versus prosthetic conduits, 
primary-assisted patency was 23% vs 20% at 5 years (P = .98), while secondary 
patency was 30% for both conduits at 5 years (P = .05). Limb salvage was 35% vs 
41% at 5 years (P < .001). Multivariable analyses demonstrated greater patency 
(adjusted hazard ratio [aHR]: 1.16; 95% confidence interval, 1.05-1.28; 
P = .003) and limb salvage (aHR: 1.12; 95% confidence interval, 1.01-1.24; 
P = .03) for autogenous compared to prosthetic bypasses. The advantage conferred 
by autogenous conduits was most clinically relevant for femoral-tibial (aHR: 
1.34; 95% confidence interval, 1.17-1.55; P < .001) and popliteal-tibial (aHR: 
1.55; 95% confidence interval, 1.09-2.21; P = .014) configurations.
CONCLUSION: This large study evaluated the long-term outcomes of open bypass 
operations in patients on hemodialysis. The data confirm the long-term benefits 
of autogenous conduits compared with prosthetic conduits in this high-risk 
population of patients, especially for the treatment of distal lesions. 
Individual patient life expectancy, availability of adequate autogenous conduit 
options, indication for operation, level of disease, as well as potential need 
for future options for additional access for dialysis should be taken into 
consideration when deciding to construct an open bypass in a hemodialysis 
patient.

Many modern people suffer from sleep debt that has accumulated in everyday life 
but is not subjectively noticed [potential sleep debt (PSD)]. Our hypothesis for 
this study was that resolution of PSD through sleep extension optimizes mood 
regulation by altering the functional connectivity between the amygdala and 
prefrontal cortex. Fifteen healthy male participants underwent an experiment 
consisting of a baseline (BL) evaluation followed by two successive 
interventions, namely, a 9-day sleep extension followed by one night of total 
sleep deprivation (TSD). Tests performed before and after the interventions 
included a questionnaire on negative mood and neuroimaging with arterial spin 
labeling MRI for evaluating regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) and functional 
connectivity. Negative mood and amygdala rCBF were significantly reduced after 
sleep extension compared with BL. The amygdala had a significant negative 
functional connectivity with the medial prefrontal cortex (FCamg-MPFC), and this 
negative connectivity was greater after sleep extension than at BL. After TSD, 
these indices reverted to the same level as at BL. An additional path analysis 
with structural equation modeling showed that the FCamg-MPFC significantly 
explained the amygdala rCBF and that the amygdala rCBF significantly explained 
the negative mood. These findings suggest that the use of our sleep extension 
protocol normalized amygdala activity via negative amygdala-MPFC functional 
connectivity. The resolution of unnoticed PSD may improve mood by enhancing 
frontal suppression of hyperactivity in the amygdala caused by PSD accumulating 
in everyday life.

Immunodeficiency, centromeric instability, and facial anomaly (ICF) syndrome is 
a rare autosomal recessive genetic condition with severe immunodeficiency, which 
leads to lethal infections if not recognized and treated in early childhood. 
Up-to-date treatment regimens consist of prophylactic and supportive treatment 
of the recurrent infections. Here, we report the case of a 1-year-old boy of 
Moroccan consanguineous parents, who was diagnosed at 4 months of age with ICF 
syndrome with a homozygous missense mutation in the DNMT3B gene. He was 
initially admitted to the hospital with recurrent pulmonary infections from the
