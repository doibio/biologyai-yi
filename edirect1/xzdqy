BACKGROUND: lifestyle behaviours and chronic co-morbidities are leading risk 
factors for premature mortality and collectively predict wide variability in 
individual life expectancy (LE). We investigated whether a pre-selected panel of 
five serum markers of biological ageing could improve predicting the long-term 
mortality risk and LE in middle-aged and older women and men.
METHODS: we conducted a case-cohort study (n = 5,789 among which there were 
2,571 deaths) within the European Prospective Investigation into 
Cancer-Heidelberg cohort, a population cohort of middle-aged and older 
individuals, followed over a median duration of 18 years. Gompertz models were 
used to compute multi-adjusted associations of growth differentiation factor-15, 
N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide, glycated haemoglobin A1c, C-reactive 
protein and cystatin-C with mortality risk. Areas under estimated Gompertz 
survival curves were used to estimate the LE of individuals using a model with 
lifestyle-related risk factors only (smoking history, body mass index, waist 
circumference, alcohol, physical inactivity, diabetes and hypertension), or with 
lifestyle factors plus the ageing-related markers.
RESULTS: a model including only lifestyle-related factors predicted a LE 
difference of 16.8 [95% confidence interval: 15.9; 19.1] years in men and 9.87 
[9.20; 13.1] years in women aged ≥60 years by comparing individuals in the 
highest versus the lowest quintiles of estimated mortality risk. Including the 
ageing-related biomarkers in the model increased these differences up to 22.7 
[22.3; 26.9] years in men and 14.00 [12.9; 18.2] years in women.
CONCLUSIONS: serum markers of ageing are potentially strong predictors for 
long-term mortality risk in a general population sample of older and middle-aged 
individuals and may help to identify individuals at higher risk of premature 
death, who could benefit from interventions to prevent further ageing-related 
health declines.

A new strategy of peptide half-life extension has been evaluated. We 
investigated libraries of a small and very stable protein scaffold called 
Nanofitin, capable of high affinity for protein targets. We have identified 
Nanofitins targeting Human and mouse Serum Albumin, which could significantly 
improve the pharmacokinetics of an active associated peptide, mobilizing the 
patient's own albumin without external source. To demonstrate the impact of this 
approach on half-life extension, a genetic fusion of an Exenatide peptide with 
an Albumin Binding Nanofitin (ABNF) was performed. Specific activity of 
Exenatide-ABNF was measured and unaffected by the fusion. In vivo mice results 
provided convincing data (t½ of 8 min for Exenatide peptide compared to 20 h for 
Exenatide-ABNF) with sustained pharmacological activity over 3 days. This study 
constitutes a proof-of-concept of in vivo half-life extension of a biologic 
using an ABNF. Besides, the absence of cysteine in the Nanofitin scaffold, which 
is therefore devoid of structuring disulfide bonds, allows manufacturing in 
microbial cost effective systems.

With increasing life expectancy, grandparents and grandchildren have more years 
available to share. Furthermore, with lower fertility rates and fewer 
grandchildren, relationships can be more frequent and profound. 
Intergenerational relationships are expected to be associated with older 
people's quality of life, especially in Latin American countries such as Chile, 
with high intergenerational co-residence and contact between generations. This 
research aims to analyze the associations between the characteristics of 
intergenerational relationships and grandparents' subjective well-being (Diener 
Scale and Satisfaction) and self-rated health. The novelty stems from including 
the structural characteristics of relationships with grandchildren (frequency of 
contact, closeness, and care), the activities they share (generativity), and the 
quality of relationships (ambivalence). This study is based on data from a 
specific face-to-face grandparenting survey conducted on a sample of 464 
grandparents in January 2020. It is representative of older Chilean grandparents 
living in private dwellings. Multiple logistic and ordinary regression models 
were estimated using the Diener Scale, unique satisfaction question, and health 
self-perception. The results demonstrated that subjective well-being, but not 
self-rated health, was highly associated with the characteristics of 
intergenerational relationships, especially with the quality of relationships 
and with generative activities such as recreational activities and family 
identity. In conclusion, intergenerational relationships' quality and content 
are strongly associated with subjective well-being in old age, but not with 
health self-perception. Even in a Latin American country like Chile, with high 
co-residence and intergenerational contact, the variations in quality and 
generativity activities significantly explain the variations in subjective 
well-being. For this reason, policies for the promotion of well-being in older 
people must consider the family environment in which older people live, 
encompassing wider family networks, including grandchildren.

BACKGROUND: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) represents a financial burden to the 
healthcare system, patients, their families and society. Rehabilitation 
interventions with the potential for reducing costs associated with TBI are 
demanded. This study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of a randomized, 
controlled, parallel group trial that compared the effectiveness of a combined 
cognitive and vocational intervention to treatment as usual (TAU) on vocational 
outcomes.
METHODS: One-hundred sixteen participants with mild-to-moderate TBI were 
recruited from an outpatient clinic at Oslo University Hospital, Norway. They 
were randomized to a cognitive rehabilitation intervention (Compensatory 
Cognitive Training, CCT) and Supported Employment (SE) or TAU in a 1:1 ratio. 
Costs of CCT-SE and TAU, healthcare services, informal care and productivity 
loss were assessed 3, 6 and 12 months after study inclusion. Cost-effectiveness 
was evaluated from the difference in number of days until return to pre-injury 
work levels between CCT-SE and TAU and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) 
derived from the EQ-5D-5L across 12 months follow-up. Cost-utility was expressed 
in incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER).
RESULTS: The mean total costs of healthcare services was € 3,281 in the CCT-SE 
group and € 2,300 in TAU, informal care was € 2,761 in CCT-SE and € 3,591 in 
TAU, and productivity loss was € 30,738 in CCT-SE and € 33,401 in TAU. Costs 
related to productivity loss accounted for 84% of the total costs. From a 
healthcare perspective, the ICER was € 56 per day earlier back to work in the 
CCT-SE group. Given a threshold of € 27,500 per QALY gained, adjusting for 
baseline difference in EQ-5D-5L index values revealed a net monetary benefit 
(NMB) of € -561 (0.009*27,500-979) from the healthcare perspective, indicating 
higher incremental costs for the CCT-SE group. From the societal perspective, 
the NMB was € 1,566 (0.009*27,500-(-1,319)), indicating that the CCT-SE 
intervention was a cost-effective alternative to TAU.
CONCLUSIONS: Costs associated with productivity loss accounted for the majority 
of costs in both groups and were lower in the CCT-SE group. The CCT-SE 
intervention was a cost-effective alternative to TAU when considering the 
societal perspective, but not from a healthcare perspective.

BACKGROUND: There is a need to develop cost-effective weight loss maintenance 
interventions to prolong the positive impact of weight loss on health outcomes. 
Conducting pre-trial health economic modelling is recommended to inform the 
design and development of behavioural interventions. We aimed to use health 
economic modelling to estimate the maximum cost per-person (justifiable cost) of 
a cost-effective behavioural weight loss maintenance intervention, given an 
estimated intervention effect for individuals with: i) a Body Mass Index (BMI) 
of 28 kg/m2 or above without diabetes and ii) a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes 
prescribed a single non-insulin diabetes medication.
METHODS: The School for Public Health Research Diabetes prevention model was 
used to estimate the lifetime Quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gains, 
healthcare costs, and maximum justifiable cost associated with a weight loss 
maintenance intervention. Based on a meta-analysis, the estimated effect of a 
weight loss maintenance intervention following a 9 kg weight loss, was a regain 
of 1.33 kg and 4.38 kg in years one and two respectively compared to greater 
regain of 2.84 kg and 5.6 kg in the control group. Sensitivity analysis was 
conducted around the rate of regain, duration of effect and initial weight loss.
RESULTS: The justifiable cost for a weight loss maintenance intervention at an 
ICER of £20,000 per QALY was £104.64 for an individual with a BMI of 28 or over 
and £88.14 for an individual with type 2 diabetes. Within sensitivity analysis, 
this varied from £36.42 to £203.77 for the former, and between £29.98 and 
£173.05 for the latter.
CONCLUSIONS: Researchers developing a weight loss maintenance intervention 
should consider these maximum justifiable cost estimates and the potential 
impact of the duration of effect and initial weight loss when designing 
intervention content and deciding target populations. Future research should 
consider using the methods demonstrated in this study to use health economic 
modelling to inform the design and budgetary decisions in the development of a 
behavioural interventions.

BACKGROUND: Individuals suffering from schizophrenia have a reduced life 
expectancy with cardiovascular disease (CVD) as a major contributor. Low 
educational attainment is associated with schizophrenia, as well as with 
all-cause and CVD mortality. However, it is unknown to what extent low 
educational attainment can explain the increased mortality in individuals with 
schizophrenia.
AIM: Here, we quantify associations between educational attainment and all-cause 
and CVD mortality in individuals with schizophrenia, and compare them with the 
corresponding associations in the general population.
METHOD: All Norwegian citizens born between January 1, 1925, and December 31, 
1959, were followed up from January 1, 1990, to December 31, 2014. The total 
sample included 1,852,113 individuals, of which 6548 were registered with 
schizophrenia. We estimated hazard ratios (HR) for all-cause and CVD mortality 
with Cox models, in addition to life years lost. Educational attainment for 
index persons and their parents were included in the models.
RESULTS: In the general population individuals with low educational attainment 
had higher risk of all-cause (HR: 1.48 [95% CI: 1.47-1.49]) and CVD (HR: 1.59 
[95% CI: 1.57-1.61]) mortality. In individuals with schizophrenia these 
estimates were substantially lower (all-cause: HR: 1.13 [95% CI: 1.05-1.21] and 
CVD: HR: 1.12 [95% CI: 0.98-1.27]). Low educational attainment accounted for 
3.28 (3.21-3.35) life years lost in males and 2.48 (2.42-2.55) years in females 
in the general population, but was not significantly associated with life years 
lost in individuals with schizophrenia. Results were similar for parental 
educational attainment.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that while individuals with schizophrenia in 
general have lower educational attainment and higher mortality rates compared 
with the general population, the association between educational attainment and 
mortality is smaller in schizophrenia subjects than in the general population.

In recent years, the number of diabetic patients has gradually increased, and 
the number of patients with diabetic foot has also increased. Diabetic foot has 
a high rate of disability and death, seriously affects the patients' quality of 
life, shortens life expectancy, and brings heavy social burden. The current 
treatment methods for diabetic foot are insufficient. The concepts and methods 
of tissue engineering provide new thoughts and means for the treatment of 
diabetic foot. This article introduces the pathogenesis of diabetic foot wounds, 
the factors leading to non-healing of diabetic foot, the applications of 
functional hydrogel dressings in the treatment of diabetic foot and their 
technical methods of functional hydrogel dressings for treating skin wounds in 
diabetic animals, and the future development direction of functional hydrogel 
dressing for treating diabetic foot wounds is prospected.

Previous guidelines for the treatment of people with type 2 diabetes mellitus 
(T2D) have relied heavily upon rigid algorithms for the sequential addition of 
pharmacotherapies to achieve target glycemic control. More recent guidelines 
advocate a personalized approach for diabetes treatment, to improve patient 
satisfaction, quality of life, medication adherence and overall health outcomes. 
Clinicians should work with patients to develop personalized goals for their 
treatment, including targeted glycemic control, weight management, prevention 
and treatment of associated comorbidities and avoidance of complications such as 
hypoglycemia. Factors that affect the intensity of treatment and choice of 
pharmacotherapy should include medical and patient influences. Medical 
considerations include the diabetes phenotype, biomarkers including genetic 
tests, and the presence of comorbidities such as cardiovascular, renal, or 
hepatic disease. Patient factors include their treatment preference, age and 
life expectancy, diabetes duration, hypoglycemia fear and unawareness, 
psychological and social circumstances. The use of a personalized approach in 
the management of people with T2D can reduce the cost and failure associated 
with the algorithmic "one-size-fits-all" approach, to anticipate disease 
progression, improve the response to diabetes pharmacotherapy and reduce the 
incidence of diabetes-associated complications. Ultimately, the use of 
personalized medicine in people with T2D should improve medication adherence, 
patient satisfaction and quality of life to reduce diabetes distress and improve 
physical health outcomes.

Understanding of the patterns of and changes in mortality from respiratory 
infectious diseases (RID) and its contribution to loss of life expectancy (LE) 
is inadequate in the existing literature. With rapid sociodemographic changes 
globally, and the current COVID-19 pandemic, it is timely to revisit the disease 
burden of RID. Using the approaches of life table and cause-eliminated life 
table based on data from the Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD), the study 
analyses loss of LE due to RID in 195 countries/territories and its changes 
during the period 1990-2017. Results indicate that loss of LE due to RID stood 
at 1.29 years globally in 2017 globally and varied widely by age, gender, and 
geographic location, with men, elderly people, and populations in middle/low 
income countries/territories suffering a disproportionately high loss of LE due 
to RID. Additionally, loss of LE due to RID decreased remarkably by 0.97 years 
globally during the period 1990-2017 but increased slightly among populations 
older than 70 years and in many high income countries/territories. Results 
suggest that RID still pose a severe threat for population and public health, 
and that amid dramatic sociodemographic changes globally, the disease burden of 
RID may resurge. The study presents the first examination of the life-shortening 
effect of RID at the global and country/territory levels, providing new 
understanding of the changing disease burden of RID and shedding light on the 
potential consequences of the current COVID-19 pandemic.

As human life expectancy increases, cognitive decline and memory impairment 
threaten independence and quality of life. Therefore, finding prevention and 
treatment strategies for memory impairment is an important health concern. 
Moreover, a better understanding of the mechanisms involved underlying memory 
preservation will enable the development of appropriate pharmaceuticals drugs 
for those who are activity limited. Exercise training as a non-pharmacological 
tool, has been known to increase the mean lifespan by maintaining general body 
health and improving the cardiovascular and nervous systems function. Among 
different exercise training protocols, aerobic exercise has been reported to 
prevent the progression of memory decline, provided adequate exertion level, 
duration, and frequency. Mechanisms underlying exercise training effects on 
memory performance have not been understood yet. Convergent evidence suggest 
several direct and indirect mechanisms at molecular and supramolecular levels. 
The supramolecular level includes improvement in blood circulation, synaptic 
plasticity and neurogenesis which are under controls of complex molecular 
signaling of neurotransmitters, neurotrophic factors, exerkines, and epigenetics 
factors. Among these various factors, irisin/BDNF signaling seems to be one of 
the important mediators of crosstalk between contracted skeletal muscles and the 
brain during exercise training. This review provides an affordable and effective 
method to improve cognitive function in old ages, particularly those who are 
most vulnerable to neurodegenerative disorders.

Cancer is the leading cause of death and one of the greatest barriers to 
increased life expectancy worldwide. Currently, chemotherapy with synthetic 
drugs remains one of the predominant ways for cancer treatment, which may lead 
to drug resistance and normal organ damage. Increasing researches have suggested 
that apoptosis, a type of programmed cell death, is a promising way for cancer 
therapy. Furthermore, natural products are important sources for finding new 
drugs with high availability, low cost and low toxicity. As a well-known 
isoquinoline alkaloid, accumulating evidence has revealed that berberine (BBR) 
exerts potential pro-apoptotic effects on multiple cancers, including breast, 
lung, liver, gastric, colorectal, pancreatic, and ovarian cancers. The related 
potential signal pathways are AMP-activated protein kinase, mitogen-activated 
protein kinase, and protein kinase B pathways. In this review, we provide a 
timely and comprehensive summary of the detailed molecular mechanisms of BBR in 
treating three types of cancer (breast, lung and liver cancer) by inducing 
apoptosis. Furthermore, we also discuss the existing challenges and strategies 
to improve BBR's bioavailability. Hopefully, this review provides valuable 
information for the comprehension of BBR in treating three types of cancer and 
highlight the pro-apoptotic effects of BBR, which would be beneficial for the 
further development of this natural compound as an effective clinical drug for 
treating cancers.

Despite the long history of the study of the biodiversity-ecosystem function 
relationship, uncertainty remains about the relationship of natural grassland 
ecosystems under stressful conditions. Recently, trait- and phylogenetic-based 
tests provide a powerful way to detect the relationship in different spaces but 
have seldom been applied to stressful zones on a large spatial scale. We 
selected Qinghai-Tibetan as the study area and collected a grassland community 
database involving 581 communities. We calculated biomass and species', 
functional, and phylogenetic diversity of each community and examined their 
relationships by using linear and non-linear regression models. Results showed 
an overall positive biodiversity-productivity relationship in species', 
functional and phylogenetic space. The relationship, however, was non-linear, in 
which biodiversity explained better the variation in community biomass when 
species diversity was more than a threshold, showing a weak effect of 
biodiversity on ecosystem function in low species diversity communities. We also 
found a filled triangle for the limit of the relationship between species and 
functional diversity, implying that functional diversity differs significantly 
among communities when their species diversity is low but finally converges to 
be a constant with increasing communities' species diversity. Our study suggests 
that multiple niche processes may structure the grassland communities, and their 
forces tend to balance in high-biodiversity communities.

Rationale: Employing in situ bioorthogonal catalysis within subcellular 
organelles, such as lysosomes, remains a challenge. Lysosomal membranes pose an 
intracellular barrier for drug sequestration, thereby greatly limiting drug 
accumulation and concentrations at intended targets. Here, we provide a 
proof-of-concept report of a nanozyme-based strategy that mediates in situ 
bioorthogonal uncaging reactions within lysosomes, followed by lysosomal escape 
and the release of uncaged drugs into the cytoplasm. Methods: A model system 
composed of a protein-based nanozyme platform (based on the transition metals 
Co, Fe, Mn, Rh, Ir, Pt, Au, Ru and Pd) and caged compound fluorophores was 
designed to screen for nanozyme/protecting group pairings. The optimized 
nanozyme/protecting group pairing was then selected for utilization in the 
design of anti-cancer pro-drugs and drug delivery systems. Results: Our 
screening system identified Pd nanozymes that mimic mutant P450BM3 activity and 
specifically cleave propargylic ether groups. We found that the intrinsic 
peroxidase-like activity of Pd nanozymes induced the production of free radicals 
under acid conditions, resulting in lysosomal membrane leakage of uncaged 
molecules into the cytoplasm. Using a multienzyme synergistic approach, our Pd 
nanozymes achieved in situ bioorthogonal catalysis and nanozyme-mediated 
lysosomal membrane leakage, which were successfully applied to the design of 
model pro-drugs for anti-cancer therapy. The extension of our nanozyme system to 
the construction of a liposome-based "all-in-one" delivery system offers promise 
for realizing efficacious in vivo tumor-targeted therapies. Conclusions: This 
strategy shows a promising new direction by utilizing nanotechnology for drug 
development through in situ catalyzing bioorthogonal chemistry within specific 
subcellular organelles.

Minimal Residual Disease Assessment in Multiple Myeloma Patients: Minimal 
Disease With Maximal Implications.

Multiple Myeloma (MM), the second most common hematologic malignancy, has been 
the target of many therapeutic advances over the past two decades. The 
introduction of novel agents, such as proteasome inhibitors, immunomodulatory 
drugs, and monoclonal antibodies, along with autologous hematopoietic stem cell 
transplantation (ASCT) in the current standard of care, has increased the median 
survival of myeloma patients significantly. Nevertheless, a curative treatment 
option continues to elude us, and MM remains an incurable disease, with patients 
relapsing even after achieving deep conventionally defined responses, 
underscoring the need for the development of sensitive methods that will allow 
for proper identification and management of the patients with a higher 
probability of relapse. Accurate detection of Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) 
from a bone marrow biopsy represents a relatively new approach of evaluating 
response to treatment with data showing clear benefit from obtaining MRD(-) 
status at any point of the disease course. As life expectancy for patients with 
MM continues to increase and deep responses are starting to become the norm, 
establishing and refining the role of MRD in the disease course is more relevant 
than ever. This review examines the different methods used to detect MRD and 
discusses future considerations regarding the implementation in day-to-day 
clinical practice and as a prospective primary endpoint for clinical trials.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: High-dose-rate interstitial brachytherapy (HDR-ISBT) is 
recommended to obtain a better local tumor control for uterine cancer patients 
in specific situations such as bulky lesions, an extension to the lateral 
parametrium, or tumors with irregular shapes. Our group uses real-time 
transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS) to guide freehand interstitial needle 
insertion. Occasionally, target tumors locate deeper beyond the rectum and 
cannot be visualized by TRUS. CT can guide needles to deeply located tumors, but 
in such cases, repeated image obtainment is required to achieve ideal needle 
localization. In this report, we present nine cases of patients who underwent 
HDR-ISBT for deeply situated tumors guided by a combination of transrectal and 
transabdominal ultrasonography (TR/TA-US).
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Nine uterine cancer patients whose tumors were located 
deeper than the reach of TRUS and underwent HDR-ISBT guided by TR/TA-US were 
presented. All nine cases had no distal organ metastasis and underwent external 
beam radiation therapy (EBRT) to the pelvic region for 45-50.4 Gy in 25-28 
fractions followed by boost HDR-ISBT for deeply situated tumors guided by 
TR/TA-US.
RESULTS: There were seven cervical cancer and two endometrial cancer patients: 
six with extensive uterine corpus invasion, one cervical cancer with massive 
pelvic lymph node metastasis, one cervical cancer with postoperative pelvic 
recurrence, and one with left ovarian direct tumor invasion. The median 
follow-up period was 15 months (range 3-28 months). The average clinical target 
volume at the time of first HDR-ISBT was 131 ml (range 44-335 ml). The linear 
distance from the vaginal entrance to the deepest part of the tumor at first 
time brachytherapy of nine cases was 14.0 (9.0-17.0) cm. HDR-ISBT dose 
fractionation was 24-30 Gy in four or five fractions. Seven out of nine cases 
had no local recurrence in the follow-up period. One had local in-field 
recurrence 25 months after HDR-ISBT. Another case with carcinosarcoma could not 
obtain local control and underwent salvage hysterectomy for a residual uterine 
tumor 11 months after HDR-ISBT. Four cases had extra-field recurrence in lymph 
nodes or distant organs.
CONCLUSIONS: In brachytherapy for gynecologic malignancies, deeply situated 
tumors located out of reach of TRUS may obtain favorable local control by 
HDR-ISBT guided with TR/TA-US.

Life expectancy steadily increases, and so do age-associated diseases, leading 
to a growing population suffering from cognitive decline and dementia. 
Impairments in working memory (WM) and episodic memory (EM) are associated with 
an increased risk of developing dementia. While there are no effective 
pharmacological therapies to preserve or enhance cognition and to slow down the 
progression from mild memory complaints to dementia so far, plant-based 
nutrients including polyphenols have been suggested to exert beneficial effects 
on brain aging. This review studies whether supplementary polyphenols are 
effective in preserving or enhancing memory in both non-pathological and 
pathological aging, and whether there are polyphenol efficiency differences 
between WM and EM. A systematic literature search was conducted and 66 out of 
294 randomized clinical trials with 20 participants or more per group, aged 40 
years or older were included. These covered a daily intake of 35-1,600 mg 
polyphenols, e.g., flavonols, flavonoids, isoflovones, anthocyanins, and/or 
stilbenes, over the course of 2 weeks to 6.5 years duration. In total, around 
half of the studies reported a significantly improved performance after 
polyphenol administration compared to control, while three studies reported a 
worsening of performance, and the remainder did not observe any effects. 
According to pooled WM and EM meta-analysis of all memory outcomes reported in 
49 studies, overall effect size for WM and EM indicated a significant small 
positive effect on EM and WM with similar estimates (b ~ 0.24, p < 0.001), with 
large study heterogeneity and significant Funnel asymmetry tests suggesting a 
positivity bias. These results remained similar when excluding studies reporting 
extremely large positive effect sizes from the meta-analyses. While Ginkgo 
biloba and isoflavones did not show benefits in subgroup meta-analyses, those 
suggested some effects in extracts containing anthocyanins, other flavonoids and 
resveratrol, again potentially resulting from publication bias. To conclude, a 
systematic review and meta-analysis indicate that short- to moderate-term 
polyphenol interventions might improve WM and EM in middle-to older aged adults, 
however, publication bias in favor of positive results seems likely, rendering 
definite conclusions difficult. Future studies with larger, more diverse samples 
and sensitive monitoring of cardiovascular, metabolic and beginning brain 
pathologies as well as longer follow-up are needed to better understand the 
impact of age, (beginning) pathologies, gender, and long-term use on polyphenol 
action.

Jobelyn® (JB), a dietary supplement, derived from polyphenol-rich leaf sheath of 
Sorghum bicolor, has been reported to attenuate sensorimotor deficits and 
oxidative stress evoked by complete Freund-adjuvant in mice. This present study 
evaluated its effects on the life span, motor function and changes in oxidative 
stress parameters as well as acetylcholinesterase activity in Drosophila 
melanogaster exposed to lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The flies (50 per vial), in 5 
replicates were fed with LPS (250 μg/kg diet) alone or in combination with JB 
(0.25-1.0 mg/kg diet) daily for 7 days. The mortality rate and motor function 
were evaluated on day 7. The flies were afterwards processed for determination 
of oxidative stress parameters and acetylcholinesterase activity. The effects of 
JB (0.25-1.0 mg/g diet) on the longevity of Drosophila was also investigated 
wherein the flies were monitored daily for mortality throughout their lifespan. 
The flies exposed to LPS (250 μg/kg diet) had reduced life span and elevated 
oxidative stress when compared with control. However, JB (0.25 and 1.0 mg/kg 
diet) improved the motor function and also reduced the mortality rate of the 
flies exposed to LPS. It also restored the cellular antioxidant status and 
reduced acetylcholinesterase activity, accumulation of hydrogen peroxide as well 
as nitric oxide in Drosophila fed with LPS. JB also extended the longevity of 
the flies relative to control. The findings that JB improves motor function and 
extended the lifespan of Drosophila flies by boosting the antioxidant status and 
cholinergic function, suggest it might be helpful in delaying the onset of 
neuropsychiatric illnesses associated with the aging processes.

BACKGROUND: Uterine cancer is one of the most common female cancers worldwide, 
with huge heterogeneity in morbidity and mortality. Although a high body-mass 
index (BMI) has been linked to uterine cancer, systematic reports about the 
influence of high BMI and its temporal trends are scarce.
METHODS: The annual morbidity, mortality, and disability-adjusted life years 
(DALYs) of uterine cancer in 204 countries or territories were retrieved from 
the GBD 2019 study. To reflect trends in disease burden, we also calculated the 
estimated annual percentage change (EAPC) based on the age-standardized rates of 
uterine cancer from 1990 to 2019.
RESULTS: The global incident cases of uterine cancer increased 2.3 times from 
187,190 in 1990 to 435,040 in 2019. Although the age-standardized incidence rate 
(ASIR) of uterine cancer increased worldwide from 8.67/100,000 in 1990 to 
9.99/100,000 in 2019, the age-standardized death rate (ASDR) and DALY rate 
decreased during the same period. High socio-demographic index (SDI) countries 
tended to have a higher ASIR than developing regions, and their increasing trend 
in ASIR was also more pronounced. The disease was rare before 40 years old, but 
its risk rose sharply among women aged 50-70. A high BMI was linked to more than 
one-third of deaths from uterine cancer in 2019.
CONCLUSIONS: The incidence in developed areas was significantly higher than in 
developing areas and also increased much more rapidly. Elderly females, 
especially those with a high BMI, have a higher risk of uterine cancer. 
Therefore, more health resources may be needed to curb the rising burden in 
specific populations.

In the expanding world of cardiovascular diseases, rapidly reaching pandemic 
proportions, the main focus is still on coronary atherosclerosis and its 
clinical consequences. However, at least in the Western world, middle-aged male 
patients with acute myocardial infarction are no more the rule. Due to a higher 
life expectancy and major medical advances, physicians are to treat older and 
frailer individuals, usually with multiple comorbidities. In this context, 
myocardial ischaemia and infarction frequently result from an imbalance between 
myocardial oxygen supply and demand-i.e., type 2 myocardial infarction (T2MI),
