BACKGROUND: We herein evaluate the Spanish population's trends in health burden 
by comparing results of two Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk 
Factors Studies (the GBD studies) performed 20 years apart.
METHODS: Data is part of the GBD study for 1990 and 2010. We present results for 
mortality, years of life lost (YLLs), years lived with disability, and 
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) for the Spanish population. Uncertainty 
intervals for all measures have been estimated.
RESULTS: Non-communicable diseases accounted for 3,703,400 (95% CI 
3,648,270-3,766,720) (91.3%) of 4,057,400 total deaths, in the Spanish 
population. Cardiovascular and circulatory diseases were the main cause of 
mortality among non-communicable diseases (34.7% of total deaths), followed by 
neoplasms (27.1% of total deaths). Neoplasms, cardiovascular and circulatory 
diseases, and chronic respiratory diseases were the top three leading causes for 
YLLs. The most important causes of DALYs in 2010 were neoplasms, cardiovascular 
and circulatory diseases, musculoskeletal disorders, and mental and behavioral 
disorders.
CONCLUSIONS: Mortality and disability in Spain have become even more linked to 
non-communicable diseases over the last years, following the worldwide trends. 
Cardiovascular and circulatory diseases, neoplasms, mental and behavioral 
disorders, and neurological disorders are the leading causes of mortality and 
disability. Specific focus is needed from health care providers and policy 
makers to develop health promotion and health education programs directed 
towards non-communicable disorders.

BACKGROUND: As life expectancy is increasing, the use of minimally invasive 
surgery (MIS) in the elderly is gaining interest. The aim of this study was to 
identify the impact of minimally invasive gastrectomy by comparing the procedure 
to open surgery in octogenarians. In addition, we also evaluated the role of 
gastrectomy in elderly gastric cancer patients by assessing long-term outcomes.
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed data from 99 gastric cancer patients aged 
80 years or older, who underwent gastrectomy by either MIS or open surgery from 
2005 to 2010. Patient characteristics, operative outcomes, pathologic results, 
morbidity, mortality, and follow-up data (including survival) were compared.
RESULTS: Thirty patients underwent gastrectomy with MIS (19 laparoscopic and 11 
robotic) and 69 patients underwent open gastrectomy. MIS demonstrated 
significantly less blood loss, lower analgesic consumption, faster time to first 
flatus and soft diet, and a shorter post-operative hospital stay. Multivariate 
analysis revealed that the type of operation had no effect on the occurrence of 
complications. There were two postoperative mortalities, both in the open group. 
Excluding these patients, the overall and disease-specific 5-year survival rates 
were 57.4 and 70.0 %, respectively. The overall (MIS 70.0 %; open 52.0 %) and 
disease-specific (MIS 81.8 %; open 65.1 %) 5-year survival rates were similar 
for the two groups. When we analyzed the 85 patients underwent curative 
resection only, the overall (MIS 71.4 %; open 58.4 %) and disease-specific (MIS 
84.1 %; open 73.6 %) 5-year survival rates were similar for the two groups.
CONCLUSIONS: MIS for gastric cancer may be performed safely and maintains the 
advantages of minimal invasiveness, even in extremely old patients. Furthermore, 
gastrectomy by either by MIS or open surgery can reduce gastric cancer-related 
deaths, even in patients 80 years or older.

BACKGROUND: Estimating the burden of diseases, injuries and major risk factors 
is necessary for adopting appropriate health policies in every country, and this 
paper aims to explain the study protocol of national and sub-national burden of 
breast cancer in Iran from 1990 to 2013.
METHODS: We will perform a systematic review of the confirmed databases and 
literature to gather data on breast cancer epidemiology in Iran. The 
definitions, data sources, organizing the team, methods of data gathering and 
data generating will be explained in this paper. The methodology of estimating 
the trend of prevalence, years of life lost due to premature death (YLLs), years 
of life lost due to disability (YLDs) and disability-adjusted life years lost 
(DALYs) of breast cancer by age groups, provinces and probable inequalities will 
be explained. We will tackle possible data problems due to the lack of data 
points on provinces and years and also geographical misalignment by using two 
advanced statistical methods, namely Bayesian autoregressive multilevel and 
Spatio-temporal models. Trend estimation will be reported using these two models 
together with uncertainty intervals.
CONCLUSION: This study provides a comprehensive assessment of breast cancer and 
its specific pattern in Iran. The results will help policy makers to know the 
trend of prevalence, the distribution, and the inequalities of breast cancer in 
Iran to allocate resources in a better way.

BACKGROUND: End Stage Renal Diseases (ESRD) imposes a huge economic burden on 
the health system; however, there is a serious lack of data related to ESRD, 
especially at Sub-national level, in Iran. Calculating the burden of ESRD at 
National and Sub-national level provides an opportunity to apply cost-effective 
interventions for the purpose of prevention and treatment. The current study 
protocol aims to explain the general structure and methods that will be used in 
the burden of ESRD study in Iran from 1990 to 2013.
METHODS: The prevalence, incidence, mortality and geographical and socioeconomic 
inequality trend of ESRD will be calculated through a comprehensive systematic 
review of published and unpublished data. Years of Life Lost due to premature 
mortality, and Years Lived with Disability and Disability-Adjusted Life Years 
(DALYs) will be quantified for ESRD by gender, age group, and province with 
their uncertainly intervals. "Spatio-Temporal" and "Bayesian multilevel 
autoregressive" will be applied to deal with data scarcity and misalignment 
problem which exist in the data sources.
DISCUSSION: The findings of the burden of ESRD study will be useful to organize 
preventive, treatment also research priorities at national and sub-national 
levels in Iran. Better understanding of the magnitude of ESRD burden is 
essential to prevent the progression of chronic kidney diseases to the end stage 
phase which is considered as a devastating illness.

BACKGROUND: Asthma is a chronic inflammatory airway disease caused or worsened 
by environmental factors in genetically vulnerable people. The study of national 
and sub-national burden of asthma aims to provide a quantitative method and 
valid estimates for the prevalence, incidence, and economic burden of asthma 
disease in Iran from 1990 to 2013 and this papers explains measures, data 
sources, methods, and challenges that we will use in the study.
METHODS: In order to conduct this study, we will use all available unpublished 
data sources, including claim databases and data collected by the food and drug 
organization (FDO). Moreover, we will devise and run a systematic review of all 
studies and literature published about asthma epidemiology in Iran, which 
includes all cross-sectional, cohort and case-control studies with asthma 
epidemiology focus that are population based. In this study, we will use two 
statistical models, including spatio-temporal and multilevel autoregressive 
models to estimate mean and uncertainty intervals for the parameters under study 
by gender, age, year, and province. All programs will be written in R 
statistical packages (version 3.0.1).
CONCLUSION: This study helps to obtain information concerning the variation 
among regions and provinces, and in general among sub-national divisions. Our 
study can be contribute to better allocation of resources, since it helps 
policymakers to recognize inequalities between regions and provinces and 
consequently help them to allocate resources more efficiently.

BACKGROUND: Although Visual impairment (VI) and its prevention is a public 
health issue, sub-optimal information about its magnitude in national level and 
its distribution is one of the impediments for visual health advocacy. In this 
article, we are detailing the approaches which will be taken to estimate the 
magnitude (prevalence, incidence, and burden), distribution, and trend (1990 to 
2013) of low vision and blindness in Iran. Besides that, an attempt will be made 
to describe inequalities and their determinants.
METHODS: After finalizing the list of diseases, a systematic search will be 
started using confirmed search terms and all published and unpublished data will 
be extracted. Other data sources, including data from hospital records will be 
added to the data extraction sheet. Using distinct statistical models including 
spatio-temporal model and multilevel autoregressive model, we will estimate rate 
of burden measures of eye disease and their uncertainty interval by sex, age, 
year, and province as well as social determinants of visual impairment 
inequality. The results are to be reported in separated analyses of 
meta-analysis, trend, risk factors and diseases burden, inequality, Bayesian 
prediction modeling, and map for visualizing the results.
CONCLUSION: The results of the current study will address gaps in different 
regions and have implication for evidence-based policy making in Iran.

Disability is strongly associated with musculoskeletal conditions such as 
arthritis, low back pain and other soft tissue and joint disorders. The burden 
of these conditions may become exponentially high in the absence of 
rehabilitation. To understand disability, the ICF (International Classification 
of Functioning, Disability and Health) provides the framework to disentangle the 
different domains that comprise disability. Disability in ICF term is defined as 
an impairment of the body functions and body structure and limited activity and 
restricted participation and can be influenced by environmental and personal 
factors. The ICF can provide the domains of disability pertinent to individuals 
with musculoskeletal conditions by using ICF Core Sets. Musculoskeletal-related 
disability is amenable to rehabilitation and there is evidence to suggest the 
effectiveness of multidisciplinary forms of rehabilitation programs. 
Community-based programs as an extension of rehabilitation also have evidence to 
improve clinical and quality of life outcomes in people with musculoskeletal 
conditions.

Inhaled antibiotics, such as tobramycin, for the treatment of Pseudomonas 
aeruginosa pulmonary infections are associated with the increase in life 
expectancy seen in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients over recent years. However, the 
effectiveness of this aminoglycoside is still limited by its inability to 
penetrate the thick DNA-rich mucus in the lungs of these patients, leading to 
low antibiotic exposure to resident bacteria. In this study, we created novel 
polymeric nanoparticle (NP) delivery vehicles for tobramycin. Using isothermal 
titration calorimetry, we showed that tobramycin binds with alginate polymer 
and, by exploiting this interaction, optimised the production of tobramycin 
alginate/chitosan NPs. It was established that NP antimicrobial activity against 
P. aeruginosa PA01 was equivalent to unencapsulated tobramycin (minimum 
inhibitory concentration 0.625mg/L). Galleria mellonella was employed as an in 
vivo model for P. aeruginosa infection. Survival rates of 90% were observed 
following injection of NPs, inferring low NP toxicity. After infection with P. 
aeruginosa, we showed that a lethal inoculum was effectively cleared by 
tobramycin NPs in a dose dependent manner. Crucially, a treatment with NPs prior 
to infection provided a longer window of antibiotic protection, doubling 
survival rates from 40% with free tobramycin to 80% with NP treatment. 
Tobramycin NPs were then functionalised with dornase alfa (recombinant human 
deoxyribonuclease I, DNase), demonstrating DNA degradation and improved NP 
penetration of CF sputum. Following incubation with CF sputum, tobramycin NPs 
both with and without DNase functionalisation, exhibited anti-pseudomonal 
effects. Overall, this work demonstrates the production of effective 
antimicrobial NPs, which may have clinical utility as mucus-penetrating 
tobramycin delivery vehicles, combining two widely used CF therapeutics into a 
single NP formulation. This nano-antibiotic represents a strategy to overcome 
the mucus barrier, increase local drug concentrations, avoid systemic adverse 
effects and improve outcomes for pulmonary infections in CF.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the effects of social support on mortality among the 
aged people with major diseases or ADL disabilities.
METHOD: In this prospective cohort study, data were retrieved from the Taiwan 
Longitudinal Study on Aging from 1996 to 2007. Data for 1297 males and 1666 
females aged ≥65 years were collected. The participants were divided into having 
major diseases or ADL disability or none. Subjects received financial, 
instrumental, and emotional support, and they actively provided instrumental and 
emotional support to others. The effect of the association between providing and 
receiving social support on mortality was examined using Cox regression analysis 
after adjusting several covariates.
RESULTS: Results showed a significant finding that providing instrumental 
support can lower mortality rates in the aged people [Hazard ratio (HR)=0.77; 
95% confidence interval (CI)=0.66-0.90; p=0.0009] and those with major diseases 
or impairment of activities of daily living [Hazard ratio (HR)=0.62; 95% 
confidence interval (CI)=0.50-0.78; p≤0.0001] after adjusting for several 
covariates. Providing instrumental social support to others may prolong life 
expectancy in the aged people and even those with major diseases or those facing 
difficulties performing ADL.
CONCLUSION: Based on the finding, we should encourage older adults who have 
major diseases or ADL disabilities to be supporting providers especially in 
providing instrumental social support.

Congenital dislocation of the knee popularly known as genu recurvatum; is a very 
rare condition, about 0.45% of all congenital anomalies. Furthermore isolated 
genu recurvatum is extremely rare because 60% of this condition is associated 
with other congenital anomalies. Congenital dislocation of hip is the commonest 
associated anomaly. Two babies 1 male and 1 female were born with severe 
hyperextension deformity of the knees about 30° degrees. Clinically and 
radiologically they were diagnosed as isolated genu recurvatum due to congenital 
dislocation of the knees. Gentle manipulation in the form of passive stretching 
and knee flexion was started at first day of life. The deformity of male and 
female baby was corrected in 34 and 30 days respectively. The babies were moving 
the knees and lower limbs normally at final follow up at 6 months follow up and 
were confirmed clinically and radiologically. Early recognition and immediate 
manipulation cures the condition fully in short time without operation.

BACKGROUND: Cymbidium is a genus of 68 species in the orchid family, with 
extremely high ornamental value. Marker-assisted selection has proven to be an 
effective strategy in accelerating plant breeding for many plant species. 
Analysis of cymbidiums genetic background by molecular markers can be of great 
value in assisting parental selection and breeding strategy design, however, in 
plants such as cymbidiums limited genomic resources exist. In order to obtain 
efficient markers, we deep sequenced the C. ensifolium transcriptome to identify 
simple sequence repeats derived from gene regions (genic-SSR).
RESULT: The 7,936 genic-SSR markers were identified. A total of 80 genic-SSRs 
were selected, and primers were designed according to their flanking sequences. 
Of the 80 genic-SSR primer sets, 62 were amplified in C. ensifolium 
successfully, and 55 showed polymorphism when cross-tested among 9 Cymbidium 
species comprising 59 accessions. Unigenes containing the 62 genic-SSRs were 
searched against Non-redundant (Nr), Gene Ontology database (GO), eukaryotic 
orthologous groups (KOGs) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) 
database. The search resulted in 53 matching Nr sequences, of which 39 had GO 
terms, 18 were assigned to KOGs, and 15 were annotated with KEGG. Genetic 
diversity and population structure were analyzed based on 55 polymorphic 
genic-SSR data among 59 accessions. The genetic distance averaged 0.3911, 
ranging from 0.016 to 0.618. The polymorphic index content (PIC) of 55 
polymorphic markers averaged 0.407, ranging from 0.033 to 0.863. A model-based 
clustering analysis revealed that five genetic groups existed in the collection. 
Accessions from the same species were typically grouped together; however, C. 
goeringii accessions did not always form a separate cluster, suggesting that C. 
goeringii accessions were polyphyletic.
CONCLUSION: The genic-SSR identified in this study constitute a set of markers 
that can be applied across multiple Cymbidium species and used for the 
evaluation of genetic relationships as well as qualitative and quantitative 
trait mapping studies. Genic-SSR's coupled with the functional annotations 
provided by the unigenes will aid in mapping candidate genes of specific 
function.

The lack of evolutionary established mechanisms linking genes to age-related 
traits makes the problem of genetic susceptibility to health span inherently 
complex. One complicating factor is genetic trade-off. Here we focused on 
long-living participants of the Long Life Family Study (LLFS), their offspring, 
and spouses to: (1) Elucidate whether trade-offs in the effect of the 
apolipoprotein E e4 allele documented in the Framingham Heart Study (FHS) are a 
more general phenomenon, and (2) explore potential mechanisms generating age- 
and gender-specific trade-offs in the effect of the e4 allele on cancer, 
diseases of the heart, and neurodegenerative disorders assessed retrospectively 
in the LLFS populations. The e4 allele can diminish risks of cancer and diseases 
of the heart and confer risks of diseases of the heart in a sex-, age-, and 
LLFS-population-specific manner. A protective effect against cancer is seen in 
older long-living men and, potentially, their sons (>75 years, relative risk 
[RR]>75=0.48, p=0.086), which resembles our findings in the FHS. The protective 
effect against diseases of the heart is limited to long-living older men 
(RR>76=0.50, p=0.016), as well. A detrimental effect against diseases of the 
heart is characteristic for a normal LLFS population of male spouses and is 
specific for myocardial infarction (RR=3.07, p=2.1×10(-3)). These trade-offs are 
likely associated with two inherently different mechanisms, including 
disease-specific (detrimental; characteristic for a normal male population) and 
systemic, aging-related (protective; characteristic for older long-living men) 
mechanisms. The e4 allele confers risks of neurological disorders in men and 
women (RR=1.98, p=0.046). The results highlight the complex role of the e4 
allele in genetic susceptibility to health span.

The perinatal (prenatal and early neonatal) period is a critical stage for 
hypothalamic programming of sexual differentiation as well as for the 
development of energy and metabolic homeostasis. We hypothesized that neonatal 
treatment with antidiabetic drug biguanide metformin would positively modify 
regulation of growth hormone--IGF-1--insulin signaling pathway slowing down 
aging and improving cancer preventive patterns in rodents. To test this 
hypothesis male and female 129/Sv mice were s.c. injected with metformin (100 
mg/kg) at the 3rd, 5th and 7th days after birth. Metformin-treated males 
consumed less food and water and their body weight was decreased as compared 
with control mice practically over their entire lifespan. There were no 
significant differences in age-related dynamics of food and water consumption in 
females and they were heavier than controls. The fraction of mice with regular 
estrous cycles decreased with age and demonstrated a tendency to decrease in the 
females neonatally treated with metformin. Neonatal exposure to metformin 
practically failed to change the extent of hormonal and metabolic parameters in 
blood serum of male and female mice. In males, neonatal metformin treatment 
significantly increased the mean life span (+20%, P < 0.05) and slightly 
increased the maximum life span (+3.5%). In females, the mean life span and 
median in metformin-treated groups were slightly decreased (-9.1% and -13.8% 
respectively, P > 0.05) in comparison to controls, whereas mean life span of 
last 10% survivors and maximum life span were the same as in controls. Almost 
half (45%) of control male mice and 71.8% male mice neonatally exposed to 
metformin survived up to 800 d of age, the same age was achieved by 54.3% of 
mice in control female group and 30% of metformin-treated females (P < 0.03). 
Thus, neonatal metformin exposure slows down aging and prolongs lifespan in male 
but not in female mice.

of breast cancer screening in Japan and the United States.

Sciences Hiroshima University.

BACKGROUND: Although the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) 
downgraded their recommendation for breast cancer screening for women aged 40-49 
years in 2009, Japanese women in their 40s have been encouraged to attend breast 
cancer screenings since 2004. The aim of this study is to examine whether these 
different mass-screening strategies are justifiable by the different situations 
of these countries and to provide evidence for suitable judgment.
METHODS: Performance of screening strategies (annual/biennial intervals; 
initiating/terminating ages) was evaluated using a mathematical model based on 
the natural history of breast cancer and the transition between its stages. 
Benefits (reduced number of deaths and extended average life expectancy) and 
harm (false-positives) associated with these strategies were calculated.
RESULTS: Additional average life expectancy by including women in their 40s as 
participants were 13 days (26%) and 25 days (22%) in Japan and the United 
States, respectively, under the biennial screening condition; however, the 
respective increases in numbers of false-positive cases were 65% and 53% in 
Japan and the United States. Moreover, the number of screenings needed to detect 
one diagnosis or to avert one death was smaller when participants were limited 
to women of age 50 or over than when women in their 40s were included. The 
validity of including women in their 40s in Japan could not be determined 
without specifying the weight of harms compared to benefits.
CONCLUSIONS: Whether screening of women in their 40s in Japan is justifiable 
must be carefully determined based the quantitative balance of benefits and 
harms.

【背景】: 
2009年、米国予防医学専門委員会（USPSTF）が40歳代の定期的なマンモグラフィ検診に関して推奨グレードを下げたが、わが国では、2004年から40歳代の乳がん検診の受診が推奨されている。本研究の目的は、両国の異なる背景を考慮すれば、最適な検診条件が異なるのかどうか、根拠を示して検討することである。
【方法】: 
乳がん自然史に基づいて、いくつかの段階を時間の経過とともに確率的に移行するように設定された数理モデルを使用して、様々な条件下（毎年と隔年の検診間隔、検診の開始年齢と終了年齢）での検診成績を評価した。利益としては、減少した死亡者数と延長された平均余命、不利益としては、偽陽性者数を計算した。
【結果】: 
隔年検診で、検診開始年齢を50歳代から40歳代にした場合、平均余命の延長効果は、日本では13日（26％）、米国では25日（22％）であった。一方、偽陽性者数は、日本では65％、米国では53％増加した。さらに、1人の乳がんを発見するために必要な検診受診者数と1人の乳がん死亡を防ぐために必要な受診者数は、40歳代を含めた時より50歳代以上に限定した方がより少なかった。わが国で40歳代を乳がん検診の対象年齢にするかどうかの正当性は、利益と不利益の評価を明確にしなければ決定できなかった。
【結論】: わが国で40歳代を検診の対象年齢にするかどうかは、利益と不利益の量的なバランスにかかっており、慎重に決定することが必要である。

BACKGROUND: Despite the increased risk of cardiovascular disease and type 2 
diabetes associated with excess bodyweight, development of a clinically 
meaningful metric for health professionals remains a challenge. We estimated the 
years of life lost and the life-years lost from diabetes and cardiovascular 
disease associated with excess bodyweight.
METHODS: We developed a disease-simulation model to estimate the annual risk of 
diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and mortality for people with BMI of 25-<30 
kg/m(2) (overweight), 30-<35 kg/m(2) (obese), or 35 kg/m(2) and higher (very 
obese), compared with an ideal BMI of 18·5-<25 kg/m(2). We used data from 3992 
non-Hispanic white participants in the National Nutrition and Examination Survey 
(2003-10) for whom complete risk factor data and fasting glucose concentrations 
were available. After validation of the model projections, we estimated the 
years of life lost and healthy life-years lost associated with each bodyweight 
category.
FINDINGS: Excess bodyweight was positively associated with risk factors for 
cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. The effect of excess weight on years 
of life lost was greatest for young individuals and decreased with increasing 
age. The years of life lost for obese men ranged from 0·8 years (95% CI 0·2-1·4) 
in those aged 60-79 years to 5·9 years (4·4-7·4) in those aged 20-39 years, and 
years lost for very obese men ranged from 0·9 (0-1·8) years in those aged 60-79 
years to 8·4 (7·0-9·8) years in those aged 20-39 years, but losses were smaller 
and sometimes negligible for men who were only overweight. Similar results were 
noted for women (eg, 6·1 years [4·6-7·6] lost for very obese women aged 20-39 
years; 0·9 years [0·1-1·7] lost for very obese women aged 60-79 years). Healthy 
life-years lost were two to four times higher than total years of life lost for 
all age groups and bodyweight categories.
INTERPRETATION: Our estimations for both healthy life-years and total years of 
life lost show the effect of excess bodyweight on cardiovascular disease and 
diabetes, and might provide a useful health measure for discussions between 
health professionals and their patients.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to estimate long-term cost‑effectiveness of 
a hepatitis B vaccination catch-up program among children born between 1994 and 
2001 (when they were 8‑15 y old) in Shandong province, China, to provide 
information for nationwide evaluation and future policy making.
METHODS: We determined the cost-effectiveness of the catch-up program compared 
with the status quo (no catch-up program). We combined a Decision Tree model and 
a Markov model to simulate vaccination and clinical progression after hepatitis 
B virus (HBV) infection. Parameters in the models were from the literature, a 
field survey, program files, and the National Notifiable Disease Reporting 
System (NNDRS). The incremental cost‑effectiveness ratio (ICER) was used to 
compare the 2 alternative strategies. One-way sensitivity analysis, 2-way 
sensitivity analysis, and probability sensitivity analysis were used to assess 
parameter uncertainties.
RESULTS: The catch-up program was dominant compared with the status quo. Using a 
total of 5.53 million doses of vaccines, the catch-up program could prevent 
21,865 cases of symptomatic acute hepatitis B, 3,088 carrier states with 
positive hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), and 812 deaths due to HBV 
infection. The catch-up program could add 28,888 quality-adjusted life years 
(QALYs) and save $192.01 million in the targeted population in the future. The 
models were robust, considering parameter uncertainties.
CONCLUSION: The catch-up program in Shandong province among children born 
between 1994 and 2001 was 'very cost-saving.' It could save life years and 
reduce total future costs. Our study supported the desirability and impact of 
such a catch-up program throughout China.

Potential impact of vaccination against Neisseria meningitidis on Neisseria 
gonorrhoeae in the United States: results from a decision-analysis model.

Régnier SA(1), Huels J.

Components in 4CMenB vaccine against Neisseria meningitidis serogroup B have 
shown to potentially cross-react with Neisseria gonorrhoeae. We modeled the 
theoretical impact of a US 4CMenB vaccination program on gonorrhea outcomes. A 
decision-analysis model was populated using published healthcare utilization and 
cost data. A two-dose adolescent vaccination campaign was assumed, with 
protective immunity starting at age 15 years and a base-case efficacy against 
gonorrhea of 20%. The 20%-efficacy level is an assumption since no clinical data 
have yet quantified the efficacy of 4CMenB against Neisseria gonorrhoea. Key 
outcome measures were reductions in gonorrhea and HIV infections, reduction in 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) lost, and the economically justifiable price 
assuming a willingness-to-pay threshold of $75,000 per QALY gained. Adolescent 
vaccination with 4CMenB would prevent 83,167 (95% credible interval [CrI], 
44,600-134,600) gonorrhea infections and decrease the number of HIV infections 
by 55 (95% CrI, 2-129) per vaccinated birth cohort in the USA. Excluding 
vaccination costs, direct medical costs for gonorrhea would reduce by $28.7 
million (95% CrI, $6.8-$70.0 million), and income and productivity losses would 
reduce by $40.0 million (95% CrI, $8.2-$91.7 million). Approximately 83% of the 
reduction in lost productivity is generated by avoiding HIV infections. At a 
cost of $75,000 per QALY gained, and incremental to the vaccine's effect on 
meningococcal disease, a price of $26.10 (95% CrI, $9.10-$57.20) per dose, 
incremental to the price of the meningococcal vaccine, would be justified from 
the societal perspective. At this price, the net cost per infection averted 
would be $1,677 (95% CrI, $404-$2,564). Even if the cross-immunity of 4CMenB 
vaccine and gonorrhea is only 20%, the reduction in gonorrhea infections and 
associated costs would be substantial.

AIM: To evaluate the clinical benefits and cost-effectiveness of the 
sensor-augmented pump compared with self-monitoring of plasma glucose plus 
continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion in people with Type 1 diabetes.
METHODS: The CORE Diabetes Model was used to simulate disease progression in a 
cohort of people with baseline characteristics taken from a published 
meta-analysis. Direct and indirect costs for 2010-2011 were calculated from a 
societal payer perspective, with cost-effectiveness calculated over the 
patient's lifetime. Discount rates of 3% per annum were applied to the costs and 
the clinical outcomes.
RESULTS: Use of the sensor-augmented pump was associated with an increase in 
mean discounted, quality-adjusted life expectancy of 0.76 quality-adjusted life 
years compared with continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (13.05 ± 0.12 
quality-adjusted life years vs 12.29 ± 0.12 quality-adjusted life years, 
respectively). Undiscounted life expectancy increased by 1.03 years for the 
sensor-augmented pump compared with continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion. In 
addition, the onset of complications was delayed (by a mean of 1.15 years) with 
use of the sensor-augmented pump. This analysis resulted in an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio of 367,571 SEK per quality-adjusted life year gained 
with the sensor-augmented pump. The additional treatment costs related to the 
use of the sensor-augmented pump were partially offset by the savings 
attributable to the reduction in diabetes-related complications and the lower 
frequency of self-monitoring of plasma glucose.
CONCLUSIONS: Analysis using the CORE Diabetes Model showed that improvements in 
glycaemic control associated with sensor-augmented pump use led to a reduced 
incidence of diabetes-related complications and a longer life expectancy. Use of 
the sensor-augmented pump was associated with an incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio of 367,571 SEK per quality-adjusted life year gained, which is likely to 
represent good value for money in the treatment of Type 1 diabetes in Sweden.

AIMS: To develop a health economic model to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of 
new interventions for Type 1 diabetes mellitus by their effects on long-term 
complications (measured through mean HbA1c ) while capturing the impact of 
treatment on hypoglycaemic events.
METHODS: Through a systematic review, we identified complications associated 
with Type 1 diabetes mellitus and data describing the long-term incidence of 
these complications. An individual patient simulation model was developed and 
included the following complications: cardiovascular disease, peripheral 
neuropathy, microalbuminuria, end-stage renal disease, proliferative 
retinopathy, ketoacidosis, cataract, hypoglycemia and adverse birth outcomes. 
Risk equations were developed from published cumulative incidence data and 
hazard ratios for the effect of HbA1c , age and duration of diabetes. We 
validated the model by comparing model predictions with observed outcomes from 
studies used to build the model (internal validation) and from other published 
data (external validation). We performed illustrative analyses for typical 
patient cohorts and a hypothetical intervention.
RESULTS: Model predictions were within 2% of expected values in the internal 
validation and within 8% of observed values in the external validation 
(percentages represent absolute differences in the cumulative incidence).
CONCLUSIONS: The model utilized high-quality, recent data specific to people 
with Type 1 diabetes mellitus. In the model validation, results deviated less 
than 8% from expected values.
