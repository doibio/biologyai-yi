Locomotion inextricably links biomechanics to ecology as animals maneuver 
through mechanically challenging environments. Faster individuals are more 
likely to escape predators, surviving to produce more offspring. Fast sprint 
speed evolved several times in lizards, including geckos. However, the 
underlying mechanisms determining performance await discovery in many clades. 
Novel morphological structures influence these mechanisms by adding complexity 
to the government of locomotion. Gecko adhesion coevolves with modified muscles, 
tendons, and reflexes. We explored how the Namib Day Gecko, Rhoptropus afer, 
sprints on ecologically relevant substrates. Locomotion requires that many 
moving parts of the animal work together; we found knee and ankle extension are 
the principal drivers of speed on a level surface while contributions to 
sprinting uphill are more evenly distributed among motions of the femur, knee, 
and ankle. Although geckos are thought to propel themselves with specialized, 
proximally located muscles that retract and rotate the femur, we show with path 
analysis that locomotion is altered in this secondarily terrestrial gecko. We 
present evidence of intraspecific variation in the use of adhesive toe pads and 
suggest that the subdigital adhesive toe pad may increase sprint speed in this 
species. We argue kinematics coevolve with the secondarily terrestrial lifestyle 
of this species.

This literature search concerning the potential role of spinal orthoses for 
rehabilitation and treatment of atraumatic vertebral fractures between Th4 and 
L5 with osteoporosis and without any evidence for a secondary cause, provided no 
evidence for the benefits of traditional rigid thoracolumbar corsets, which only 
had a poor compliance. In addition, there are indications that these rigid 
corsets may even worsen the disease condition especially in the long-term. 
Wearing these corsets can result in further loss of muscle mass and strength 
followed by loss of bone and bone mass. Both together can worsen the functional 
capabilities of patients. On the other hand the functional capabilities of 
patients suffering from acute or subacute vertebral fractures due to 
osteoporosis can be improved by flexible backpack orthoses. These spinal 
orthoses generate an extension moment about the spine, increase perception of 
one's own body posture via biofeedback and therefore lead to improved posture. 
This results in a strengthening of the trunk musculature, a more stable 
equilibrium and a reduction of pain, which are associated with an increase in 
functional capabilities and improvement in the parameters of the quality of 
life. During a long-term phase of rehabilitation individually tailored spinal 
orthoses guarantee a high level of compliance and adherence. Finally, there is 
high-quality evidence that spinal orthoses with additional weighting can improve 
the equilibrium in women with vertebral osteoporosis and hyperkyphosis. Future 
studies should also be carried out with other groups of patients.

BACKGROUND: Molecular identification based on microsatellite loci is an 
important technology to improve the commercial breeding of the moth orchid. 
There are more than 30,000 cultivars have been enrolled at the Royal 
Horticultural Society (RHS). In this study, genomic microsatellite primer sets 
were developed from Phalaenopsis aphrodite subsp. formosana to further examine 
the transferability of across 21 Phalaenopsis species.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Twenty-eight polymorphic microsatellite markers were 
obtained using the magnetic bead enrichment method, with high transferability of 
the 21 species of the genus Phalaenopsis, especially in the subgenus 
Phalaenopsis. The 28 newly developed polymorphic microsatellite markers with 
high polymorphism information content values. The best and second fit grouping 
(K) are inferred as two and four by the ΔK evaluation in the assignment test. 
This result indicates that these microsatellite markers are discernible to 
subgenus Phalaenopsis.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that these new microsatellite markers are 
useful for delimiting species within genus Phalaenopsis. As expected, the 
genetic relationships between species of subgenus Phalaenopsis can be well 
distinguished based on the assignment test. These molecular markers could apply 
to assess the paternity of Phalaenopsis as well as investigating hybridization 
among species of genus Phalaenopsis.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review summarizes the unmet need of headache burden and 
management in resource-limited settings. It provides a general overview of the 
nuances and peculiarities of headache disorders in resource-limited settings. 
The review delivers perspectives and explanations for the emerging burden of 
both primary and secondary headache disorders. Important discussion on 
demographic and epidemiologic transition pertinent to low-resource settings is 
included. A critical analysis of headache disorders is made within the context 
of growing burden non-communicable disorders in low-resource countries. 
Challenges are examined and prospective feasible solutions tailored to existing 
resources are provided to address headache disorders in resource-limited 
settings.
RECENT FINDINGS: Many low-resource countries are entering into the third 
epidemiological transition featuring increasing burden of non-communicable 
disorders of which headache disorders contribute a significant proportion. 
Exponential population growth involving youthful demographic and massive 
rural-urban migration is taking place in low-resource countries. Youthful 
demographic is the natural cohort for primary headache such as migraine. 
Socioeconomic mobility and lifestyle changes are leading to higher levels of 
physical inactivity and obesity, both of which are related to headache. Life 
expectancy is rising in some resource-restricted countries; this increases 
prevalence of secondary headache attributed to neurovascular causes. Many 
low-resource countries are still burdened with tropical infectious causes of 
secondary headache. Health care facilities are primarily designed to respond to 
infectious epidemic and not to chronic burden such as headache. Many 
low-resource-restricted settings are plagued by poor and corrupt governance, 
ill-equipped regimes with malfunctioning health policies, war, and poverty. Many 
low-resource settings do not have access to generic headache medications such as 
triptans. Headache training and expertise is low. Healthy lifestyle changes 
emphasizing on improving regular exercise can be inexpensive method to reducing 
primary headache burden and its comorbidities (e.g. obesity). Addressing the 
increasing burden of headache disorders in resource-limited settings is 
important to avert accrued disability which in turn lowers productivity and 
socioeconomic performance in a young booming population.

Spinal metastases are the most commonly encountered tumour of the spine, 
occurring in up to 40% of patients with cancer. Each year, approximately 5% of 
cancer patients will develop spinal metastases. This number is expected to 
increase as the life expectancy of cancer patients increases. Patients with 
spinal metastases experience severe and frequently debilitating pain, which 
often decreases their remaining quality of life. With a median survival of less 
than 1 year, the goals of treatment in spinal metastases are reducing pain, 
improving or maintaining level of function and providing mechanical stability. 
Currently, conventional treatment strategies involve a combination of 
analgesics, bisphosphonates, radiotherapy and/or relatively extensive surgery. 
Despite these measures, pain management in patients with spinal metastases is 
often suboptimal. In the last two decades, minimally invasive percutaneous 
interventional radiology techniques such as vertebral augmentation and 
radiofrequency ablation (RFA) have shown progressive success in reducing pain 
and improving function in many patients with symptomatic spinal metastases. Both 
vertebral augmentation and RFA are increasingly being recognised as excellent 
alternative to medical and surgical management in carefully selected patients 
with spinal metastases, namely those with severe refractory pain limiting daily 
activities and stable pathological vertebral compression fractures. In addition, 
for more complicated lesions such as spinal metastasis with soft tissue 
extension, combined treatments such as vertebral augmentation in conjunction 
with RFA may be helpful. While combined RFA and vertebral augmentation have 
theoretical benefits, comparative trials have not been performed to establish 
superiority of combined therapy. We believe that a multidisciplinary approach as 
well as careful pre-procedure evaluation and imaging will be necessary for 
effective and safe management of spinal metastases. RFA and vertebral 
augmentation should be considered during early stages of the disease so as to 
maintain the remaining quality of life in this patient population group.

Tomato leaf mold disease is caused by the biotrophic fungus Cladosporium fulvum. 
During infection, C. fulvum produces extracellular small secreted protein (SSP) 
effectors that function to promote colonization of the leaf apoplast. Resistance 
to the disease is governed by Cf immune receptor genes that encode receptor-like 
proteins (RLPs). These RLPs recognize specific SSP effectors to initiate a 
hypersensitive response (HR) that renders the pathogen avirulent. C. fulvum 
strains capable of overcoming one or more of all cloned Cf genes have now 
emerged. To combat these strains, new Cf genes are required. An effectoromics 
approach was employed to identify wild tomato accessions carrying new Cf genes. 
Proteomics and transcriptome sequencing were first used to identify 70 
apoplastic in planta-induced C. fulvum SSPs. Based on sequence homology, 61 of 
these SSPs were novel or lacked known functional domains. Seven, however, had 
predicted structural homology to antimicrobial proteins, suggesting a possible 
role in mediating antagonistic microbe-microbe interactions in planta. Wild 
tomato accessions were then screened for HR-associated recognition of 41 SSPs, 
using the Potato virus X-based transient expression system. Nine SSPs were 
recognized by one or more accessions, suggesting that these plants carry new Cf 
genes available for incorporation into cultivated tomato.

Cost-effectiveness of gammaCore (non-invasive vagus nerve stimulation) for acute 
treatment of episodic cluster headache.

Mwamburi M, Liebler EJ, Tenaglia AT.

Cluster headache is a debilitating disease characterized by excruciatingly 
painful attacks that affects 0.15% to 0.4% of the US population. Episodic 
cluster headache manifests as circadian and circannual seasonal bouts of 
attacks, each lasting 15 to 180 minutes, with periods of remission. In chronic 
cluster headache, the attacks occur throughout the year with no periods of 
remission. While existing treatments are effective for some patients, many 
patients continue to suffer. There are only 2 FDA-approved medications for 
episodic cluster headache in the United States, while others, such as high-flow 
oxygen, are used off-label. Episodic cluster headache is associated with 
comorbidities and affects work, productivity, and daily functioning. The 
economic burden of episodic cluster headache is considerable, costing more than 
twice that of nonheadache patients. gammaCore adjunct to standard of care (SoC) 
was found to have superior efficacy in treatment of acute episodic cluster 
headaches compared with sham-gammaCore used with SoC in ACT1 and ACT2 trials. 
However, the economic impact has not been characterized for this indication. We 
conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis of gammaCore adjunct to SoC compared 
with SoC alone for the treatment of acute pain associated with episodic cluster 
headache attacks. The model structure was based on treatment of acute attacks 
with 3 outcomes: failures, nonresponders, and responders. The time horizon of 
the model is 1 year using a payer perspective with uncertainty incorporated. 
Parameter inputs were derived from primary data from the randomized controlled 
trials for gammaCore. The mean annual costs associated with the 
gammaCore-plus-SoC arm was $9510, and mean costs for the SoC-alone arm was 
$10,040. The mean quality-adjusted life years for gammaCore-plus-SoC arm were 
0.83, and for the SoC-alone arm, they were 0.74. The gammaCore-plus-SoC arm was 
dominant over SoC alone. All 1-way and multiway sensitivity analyses were 
cost-effective using a threshold of $20,000. gammaCore dominance, representing 
savings, was driven by superior efficacy, improvement in quality of life (QoL), 
and reduction in costs associated with successful and consistent abortion of 
episodic attacks. These findings serve as additional economic evidence to 
support coverage for gammaCore. Additional real-world data are needed to 
characterize the long-term impact of gammaCore on comorbidities, utilization, 
QoL, daily functioning, productivity, and social engagement of these patients, 
and for other indications.

Impact of the surgical strategy on the incidence of C5 nerve root palsy in 
decompressive cervical surgery.

OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to identify the impact of different surgical strategies 
on the incidence of C5 palsy.
BACKGROUND: Degenerative cervical spinal stenosis is a steadily increasing 
morbidity in the ageing population. Postoperative C5 nerve root palsy is a 
common complication with severe impact on the patients´ quality of life.
METHODS: We identified 1708 consecutive patients who underwent cervical 
decompression surgery due to degenerative changes. The incidence of C5 palsy and 
surgical parameters including type and level of surgery were recorded to 
identify predictors for C5 nerve palsy.
RESULTS: The overall C5 palsy rate was 4.8%, with 18.3% of cases being 
bilateral. For ACDF alone the palsy rate was low (1.13%), compared to 14.0% of 
C5 palsy rate after corpectomy. The risk increased with extension of the 
procedures. Hybrid constructs with corpectomy plus ACDF at C3-6 showed 
significantly lower rates of C5 palsy (10.7%) than corpectomy of two vertebrae 
(p = 0.005). Multiple regression analysis identified corpectomy of C4 or C5 as a 
significant predictor. We observed a lower overall incidence for ventral (4.3%) 
compared to dorsal (10.9%) approaches (p<0.001). When imaging detected a 
postoperative shift of the spinal cord at index segment C4/5, palsy rate 
increased significantly (33.3% vs. 12.5%, p = 0.034).
CONCLUSIONS: Extended surgical strategies, such as dorsal laminectomies, 
multilevel corpectomies and procedures with extensive spinal cord shift were 
shown to display a high risk of C5 palsy. The use of extended procedures should 
therefore be employed cautiously. Switching to combined surgical methods like 
ACDF plus corpectomy can reduce the rate of C5 palsy.

IMPORTANCE: Thyroid cancer generally grows at a very slow rate in adults, and 
overdiagnosis is a global issue. However, the detection of early-stage thyroid 
cancer by screening is not well described in young patients. To prevent 
overdiagnosis, it is essential to understand the natural course of thyroid 
cancer growth detection by ultrasonography screening in young patients.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the natural progression of thyroid cancer in young 
patients.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: An observational study evaluated changes in 
the diameter of malignant or suspected malignant thyroid tumors on 2 occasions. 
Changes in malignant thyroid tumor diameter were estimated during the 
observation period between the screening and confirmatory examinations in the 
first-round thyroid ultrasonography examination of the Fukushima Health 
Management Survey in patients younger than 21 years after a nuclear accident at 
a power plant in Fukushima, Japan. In total, 116 patients cytologically 
diagnosed with or suspected to have thyroid cancer were classified into 3 groups 
based on a greater than 10% reduction, a change of -10% to +10% in diameter, and 
a greater than 10% increase in tumor diameter. The association between tumor 
growth rate and tumor diameter was analyzed. The study was conducted from March 
1, 2016, to August 6, 2017.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Tumor volume changes, the coefficient of growth of 
thyroid cancer in young patients, and the association between the observation 
period or tumor diameter and them.
RESULTS: Of 116 patients, 77 were female; the mean age was 16.9 years (median, 
17.5 years). The mean observation period was 0.488 (range, 0.077-1.632) years. 
No significant differences in age, sex, tumor diameter, observation period, or 
serum levels of thyrotropin and thyroglobulin were observed among the groups. 
Whereas tumor volume changes were not linearly correlated with the observation 
period (Pearson R = 0.121; 95% CI, -0.062 to 0.297), the coefficient of growth 
was significantly and negatively correlated with the tumor diameter in the 
screening examination (Spearman ρ = -0.183; 95% CI, -0.354 to -0.001), 
suggesting growth arrest after the initial proliferation phase.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Ultrasonography screening could reveal asymptomatic 
thyroid cancer that is falling into a growth arrest pattern in many young 
patients. Considering the long life expectancy, prevention of overdiagnosis 
necessitates careful long-term monitoring without immediate diagnosis for 
suspected noninvasive thyroid cancer.

BACKGROUND: It remains controversial as to whether active stone removal should 
be performed in patients with poor performance status because of their short 
life expectancy and perioperative risks. Our objectives were to evaluate 
treatment outcomes of active stone removal in patients with poor performance 
status and to compare life prognosis with those managed conservatively.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 74 patients with Eastern Cooperative 
Oncology Group performance status 3 or 4 treated for upper urinary tract calculi 
at our four hospitals between January 2009 and March 2016. Patients were 
classified into either surgical treatment group or conservative management group 
based on the presence of active stone removal. Stone-free rate and perioperative 
complications in surgical treatment group were reviewed. In addition, we 
compared overall survival and stone-specific survival between the two groups. 
Cox proportional hazards analysis was performed to investigate predictors of 
overall survival and stone-specific survival.
RESULTS: Fifty-two patients (70.3%) underwent active stone removal (surgical 
treatment group) by extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (n = 6), ureteroscopy 
(n = 39), percutaneous nephrolithotomy (n = 6) or nephrectomy (n = 1). The 
overall stone-free rate was 78.8% and perioperative complication was observed in 
nine patients (17.3%). Conservative treatment was undergone by 22 patients 
(29.7%) (conservative management group). Two-year overall survival rates in 
surgical treatment and conservative management groups were 88.0% and 38.4%, 
respectively (p < 0.01) and two-year stone-specific survival rates in the two 
groups were 100.0% and 61.3%, respectively (p < 0.01). On multivariate analysis, 
stone removal was not significant, but was considered a possible favorable 
predictor for overall survival (p = 0.07). Moreover, stone removal was the only 
independent predictor of stone-specific survival (p < 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: Active stone removal for patients with poor performance status 
could be performed safely and effectively. Compared to conservative management, 
surgical stone treatment achieved longer overall survival and stone-specific 
survival.

OBJECTIVE: The health gains and cost savings from tobacco tax increase peak many 
decades into the future. Policy-makers may take a shorter-term perspective and 
be particularly interested in the health of working-age adults (given their role 
in economic productivity). Therefore, we estimated the impact of tobacco taxes 
in this population within a 10-year horizon.
METHODS: As per previous modelling work, we used a multistate life table model 
with 16 tobacco-related diseases in parallel, parameterised with rich national 
data by sex, age and ethnicity. The intervention modelled was 10% annual 
increases in tobacco tax from 2011 to 2020 in the New Zealand population 
(n=4.4 million in 2011). The perspective was that of the health system, and the 
discount rate used was 3%.
RESULTS: For this 10-year time horizon, the total health gain from the tobacco 
tax in discounted quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) in the 20-65 year age 
group (age at QALY accrual) was 180 QALYs or 1.6% of the lifetime QALYs gained 
in this age group (11 300 QALYs). Nevertheless, for this short time horizon: (1) 
cost savings in this group amounted to NZ$10.6 million (equivalent to 
US$7.1 million; 95% uncertainty interval: NZ$6.0 million to NZ$17.7 million); 
and (2) around two-thirds of the QALY gains for all ages occurred in the 20-65 
year age group. Focusing on just the preretirement and postretirement ages, the 
QALY gains in each of the 60-64 and 65-69 year olds were 11.5% and 10.6%, 
respectively, of the 268 total QALYs gained for all age groups in 2011-2020.
CONCLUSIONS: The majority of the health benefit over a 10-year horizon from 
increasing tobacco taxes is accrued in the working-age population (20-65 years). 
There remains a need for more work on the associated productivity benefits of 
such health gains.

of lifestyle programmes and metformin, with and without screening, for 
pre-diabetes.

OBJECTIVE: Explore the cost-effectiveness of lifestyle interventions and 
metformin in reducing subsequent incidence of type 2 diabetes, both alone and in 
combination with a screening programme to identify high-risk individuals.
DESIGN: Systematic review of economic evaluations.
DATA SOURCES AND ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Database searches (Embase, Medline, 
PreMedline, NHS EED) and citation tracking identified economic evaluations of 
lifestyle interventions or metformin alone or in combination with screening 
programmes in people at high risk of developing diabetes. The International 
Society for Pharmaco-economics and Outcomes Research's Questionnaire to Assess 
Relevance and Credibility of Modelling Studies for Informing Healthcare Decision 
Making was used to assess study quality.
RESULTS: 27 studies were included; all had evaluated lifestyle interventions and 
12 also evaluated metformin. Primary studies exhibited considerable 
heterogeneity in definitions of pre-diabetes and intensity and duration of 
lifestyle programmes. Lifestyle programmes and metformin appeared to be cost 
effective in preventing diabetes in high-risk individuals (median incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios of £7490/quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) and 
£8428/QALY, respectively) but economic estimates varied widely between studies. 
Intervention-only programmes were in general more cost effective than programmes 
that also included a screening component. The longer the period evaluated, the 
more cost-effective interventions appeared. In the few studies that evaluated 
other economic considerations, budget impact of prevention programmes was 
moderate (0.13%-0.2% of total healthcare budget), financial payoffs were delayed 
(by 9-14 years) and impact on incident cases of diabetes was limited 
(0.1%-1.6% reduction). There was insufficient evidence to answer the question of 
(1) whether lifestyle programmes are more cost effective than metformin or (2) 
whether low-intensity lifestyle interventions are more cost effective than the 
more intensive lifestyle programmes that were tested in trials.
CONCLUSIONS: The economics of preventing diabetes are complex. There is some 
evidence that diabetes prevention programmes are cost effective, but the 
evidence base to date provides few clear answers regarding design of prevention 
programmes because of differences in denominator populations, definitions, 
interventions and modelling assumptions.

Dynamic treatment selection and modification for personalised blood pressure 
therapy using a Markov decision process model: a cost-effectiveness analysis.

OBJECTIVE: Personalised medicine seeks to select and modify treatments based on 
individual patient characteristics and preferences. We sought to develop an 
automated strategy to select and modify blood pressure treatments, incorporating 
the likelihood that patients with different characteristics would benefit from 
different types of medications and dosages and the potential severity and impact 
of different side effects among patients with different characteristics.
DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: We developed a Markov decision process (MDP) 
model to incorporate meta-analytic data and estimate the optimal treatment for 
maximising discounted lifetime quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) based on 
individual patient characteristics, incorporating medication adjustment choices 
when a patient incurs side effects. We compared the MDP to current US blood 
pressure treatment guidelines (the Eighth Joint National Committee, JNC8) and a 
variant of current guidelines that incorporates results of a major recent trial 
of intensive treatment (Intensive JNC8). We used a microsimulation model of 
patient demographics, cardiovascular disease risk factors and side effect 
probabilities, sampling from the National Health and Nutrition Examination 
Survey (2003-2014), to compare the expected population outcomes from adopting 
the MDP versus guideline-based strategies.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Costs and QALYs for the MDP-based treatment (MDPT), JNC8 
and Intensive JNC8 strategies.
RESULTS: Compared with the JNC8 guideline, the MDPT strategy would be 
cost-saving from a societal perspective with discounted savings of US$1187 per 
capita (95% CI 1178 to 1209) and an estimated discounted gain of 0.06 QALYs per 
capita (95% CI 0.04 to 0.08) among the US adult population. QALY gains would 
largely accrue from reductions in severe side effects associated with higher 
treatment doses later in life. The Intensive JNC8 strategy was dominated by the 
MDPT strategy.
CONCLUSIONS: An MDP-based approach can aid decision-making by incorporating 
meta-analytic evidence to personalise blood pressure treatment and improve 
overall population health compared with current blood pressure treatment 
guidelines.

Evaluation of the primary spindle cell sarcoma prostate, which is seen extremely 
rare, is aimed. Literature search was made through a search in the MedLine 
database using PubMed and Scopus for the articles published between January 1988 
and September 2013. Electronic search was limited to the following keywords: 
"spindle cell sarcoma", "primary prostate sarcoma". Primary prosatate sarcoma 
was reported as 100 patients in literature. High-grade primary spindle cell 
sarcoma of the prostate was encountered as 16 patients in literature. This 
patients was reported as the 17th case. It is a difficult cancer due to 
diagnosis and treatment because of the short average life expectancy, high 
potential of asymptomatic aggressive and metastatic. Histopatogenesis is not 
exactly known. In 50% of composed of patients who are previously diagnosed with 
prostate adenocarcinom. The case was reported as high-grade primary prosatate 
sarcoma at an early age. The case is different from other cases because of not 
being adenocarcinom component.

Even though management of thyroid cancer is generally standardized and has an 
overall excellent long-term outcome, anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) continues 
to be a major diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. ATC is an uncommon thyroid 
malignancy with a poor prognosis. American Thyroid Association guidelines 
acknowledge the complexity of airway management in these patients. We studied 
the literature with the aim of providing guidance in airway management in ATC. 
Tracheotomy can facilitate completion of palliative treatment in those patients 
with ATC and stridor. Given the short life expectancy of these patients, a 
balanced decision must be made regarding the role and timing of tracheotomy.

BACKGROUND: The life expectancy and presence of co-morbidities cause 
reservations in treatment decisions for elderly patients with cancer. In this 
study, we retrospectively evaluated 102 patients who are considered as 
middle-old aged (aged 75 - 84) by gerontologists.
METHODS: Medical records of patients were reviewed. One hundred and two patients 
with a diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose follow-up ended 
with death between March 2006 and May 2013 were examined.
RESULTS: The median age at diagnosis was 77 (75 - 85) years. Thirty-three 
patients (67.6%) were over 80 years old. The number of patients with metastasis 
was 57 (55.8%). Forty-two (41.2%) patients had stage IIIA and IIIB disease. 
Fifteen of the metastatic patients (26.3%) were given chemotherapy, while 12 of 
the non-metastatic patients (26.6%) were given chemotherapy. Of the 
non-metastatic patients, 25 (55.6%) were treated with radiotherapy, and five 
(11.1%) were treated with chemotherapy. The median duration of follow-up was 4 
(1-55) months. Progression-free survival (PFS) was 4 months in non-metastatic 
patients, and 3 months in metastatic patients. Overall survival (OS) was 4 
months. OS rates for 1 and 2 years were 10% and 2%.
CONCLUSION: Chemotherapy and radiotherapy may be administered even to patients 
of this age group. The beneficial effect of chemotherapy in patients with 
metastasis on OS is an important finding of our study.

INTRODUCTION: With improved life expectancy and quality of life, elderly 
patients constitute a progressively larger fraction of consumers utilising renal 
replacement therapy (RRT). Although substantial data exist for younger cohorts, 
minimal evidence exists for outcomes of arteriovenous fistula (AVF) and central 
catheters (CVC) placed in those patients over 80 years. We examined outcomes of 
primary AVF placement in this cohort to ascertain durability and benefits of AVF 
in the over 80-year-old population.
METHODS: Retrospective analysis was undertaken of all autogenous AVFs and CVCs 
placed in patients aged over 80 years at Gold Coast University Hospital between 
March 2010 and February 2016. Prospectively collected demographic data, 
co-morbidities and operative factors were analysed.
RESULTS: Sixty-five AVF and 12 CVC patients were identified. Mean age at 
intervention was 83.9 years and 76% of the patients were male. The majority of 
procedures were autogenous radio-cephalic AVF; median post-operative length of 
stay was 2 days. Cumulative AVF patient survival at 12 and 24 months was 82% and 
72%, respectively. This was significantly better than survival rates of CVC 
patients, with 12-month survival of 45%. Primary patency at 6, 12 and 24 months 
was 58%, 39% and 31%. There were 113 follow-up procedures in 41 patients 
required to maintain patency.
CONCLUSIONS: Although patency rates are inferior and re-intervention rates 
higher than in younger patients, AVF can be a durable option for RRT in selected 
elderly patients with improved mortality rates compared with CVC. Age alone 
should not preclude primary AVF placement.

BACKGROUND: Multiple comorbidities have been reported among rescue/recovery 
workers responding to the 9/11/2001 WTC disaster. In this study, we developed an 
index that quantifies the cumulative physiological burden of comorbidities and 
predicts life expectancy in this cohort.
METHODS: A machine learning approach (gradient boosting) was used to model the 
relationship between mortality and several clinical parameters (laboratory test 
results, blood pressure, pulmonary function measures). This model was used to 
construct a risk index, which was validated by assessing its association with a 
number of health outcomes within the WTC general responder cohort.
RESULTS: The risk index showed significant associations with mortality, 
self-assessed physical health, and onset of multiple chronic conditions, 
particularly COPD, hypertension, asthma, and sleep apnea.
CONCLUSION: As an aggregate of several clinical parameters, this index serves as 
a cumulative measure of physiological dysregulation and could be utilized as a 
prognostic indicator of life expectancy and morbidity risk.

BACKGROUND: Metastases to the bone are common in cancer patients, and it has 
been estimated that up to 50% of patients with pelvic bone metastases will not 
achieve adequate pain control with medications alone. This has led to a paradigm 
shift over recent years towards the use and development of minimally invasive 
image-guided treatment options for palliation of bony metastases. Despite these 
developments, large metastatic lesions are still often considered to be 
"hopeless cases" that would garner little to no benefit from image-guided 
intervention. This study is the first large series to describe the novel use of 
combination percutaneous cryoablation and cementoplasty for palliation of such 
large metastases to the pelvis.
OBJECTIVES: We aim to evaluate the efficacy and safety of image-guided 
percutaneous cryoablation and cementoplasty for palliation of large pelvic bone 
metastases.
STUDY DESIGN: This retrospective analysis was approved by our institutional 
review board. This study was conducted from January 2013 to December 2016, where 
consecutive patients referred for pain management of large pelvic bone 
metastases underwent combination percutaneous cryoablation and cementoplasty.
SETTING: This study took place at a tertiary care center after patients were 
referred following formal review from a multidisciplinary conference, which was 
comprised of interventional radiologists, pain management and palliative care 
physicians, radiation and medical oncologists, and when available, 
anesthesiologists.
METHODS: Forty-eight patients (36 men and 12 women) with a mean cohort age of 
77.5 years (range: 52 - 89 years) were referred from the multidisciplinary 
conference for palliation of pelvic bone metastases. The inclusion criteria 
included patients with metastases greater or equal to 5.0 cm and significant 
pain refractory to conventional pain management regimens. All of the patients 
were deemed not to be surgical candidates. Mean pain scores were collected at 
numerous time-points along with procedural technical success rates and 
complication rates.
RESULTS: Combination cryoablation and cementoplasty was performed on 48 
consecutively referred patients with a 100% technical success rate and no 
immediate complications. The pain levels demonstrated a significant decrease (P 
< 0.001) following intervention, with mean pain scores of 7.9 (range: 5 - 10) 
and 1.2 (range: 0 - 7) throughout the week prior to intervention and at 24 hours 
post-intervention, respectively. The post-intervention pain scores remained 
stable at 1 to 9 weeks follow-up (mean: 4.1 weeks). Three patents (6.3%) 
reported no change in pain following the intervention; however, no patients 
reported worsened pain.
LIMITATIONS: The limitations of this study include its retrospective nature and 
the length of follow-up, which was often restricted given the life expectancy of 
our patient cohort.
CONCLUSION: Combination cryoablation and cementoplasty is a novel and 
efficacious treatment option for palliation of large pelvic bone metastases. 
Marked improvements in pain, as well as mobility and quality of life, are often 
attainable.
