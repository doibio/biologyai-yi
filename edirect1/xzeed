Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is often associated with antiphospholipid 
syndrome (APS), which potentially results in a more severe disease course and 
reduced life expectancy. Since the therapeutic guidelines have been refined in 
the last 15 years, we assumed that the diseases course has become more 
favorable. In order to shed light on these achievements, we compared the data of 
SLE patients diagnosed before and since 2004. In our retrospective study, we 
assessed a wide spectrum of clinical and laboratory data of 554 SLE patients who 
received regular follow-up care and therapy at our autoimmune center. Among 
these patients, 247 had antiphospholipid antibodies (APAs) without clinical 
signs of APS, and 113 had definitive APS. In the APS group, among patients 
diagnosed since 2004, deep vein thrombosis (p = 0.049) and lupus anticoagulant 
positivity (p = 0.045) were more frequent, while acute myocardial infarction was 
less frequent (p = 0.021) compared with patients diagnosed before 2004. Among 
the APA positive patients without definitive APS, anti-cardiolipin antibody 
positivity (p = 0.024) and development of chronic renal failure (p = 0.005) 
decreased in patients diagnosed since 2004. Our study demonstrates that the 
disease course has changed in recent years; however, in the presence of APS, we 
have to expect repeated thrombotic events despite adequate anticoagulant 
therapy.

Osteoporosis is a major public health problem today. We are facing an aging 
society where the average life expectancy continues to increase. Osteoporosis 
affects more than 30% of postmenopausal women due to hormonal changes that occur 
during this time. Postmenopausal osteoporosis is therefore of particular 
concern. The aim of this review is to identify the etiology, pathophysiology, 
diagnosis and treatment of this disease and lay the foundation for the role 
nurses should play in preventing postmenopausal osteoporosis. Several risk 
factors are associated with osteoporosis. In addition to age and sex, genetics, 
ethnicity, diet, or the presence of other disorders determine the development of 
this disease. The key factors include exercise, a balanced diet, and high levels 
of vitamin D. This is primarily from a solar source, and infancy is the time 
when future bone formation is greatest. There are now medications that can 
complement these preventive measures. The work of nursing staff is not only 
prevention, but also early detection and early treatment. In addition, imparting 
information and knowledge about the disease to the population is key to 
preventing an osteoporosis epidemic. In this study, a detailed description is 
provided of the biological and physiological disease, the preventive measures 
currently being researched, the information currently available to the 
population, and how health professionals address osteoporosis from a preventive 
perspective.

Traditionally, the goal of AML therapy has been to induce remission through 
intensive chemotherapy, maintain long-term remission using consolidation 
therapy, and achieve higher rates of a cure by allogeneic transplantation in 
patients with a poor prognosis. However, for the elderly patients and those with 
comorbidities, the toxicity often surpasses the therapeutic benefits of 
intensive chemotherapy. Consequently, low-intensity therapies, such as the 
combination of a hypomethylating agent with venetoclax, have emerged as 
promising treatment options for elderly patients. Given the rise of 
low-intensity therapies as the leading treatment option for the elderly, it is 
increasingly important to consider patients' age and comorbidities when 
selecting a treatment option. The recently proposed comorbidity-based risk 
stratification for AML allows prognosis stratification not only in patients 
undergoing intensive chemotherapy, but also in those receiving low-intensity 
chemotherapy. Optimizing treatment intensity based on such risk stratification 
is anticipated to balance treatment efficacy and safety, and will ultimately 
improve the life expectancy for patients with AML.

Gliomas are primary malignant brain tumors. These tumors seem to be more and 
more frequent, not only because of a true increase in their incidence, but also 
due to the increase in life expectancy of the general population. Among gliomas, 
malignant gliomas and more specifically glioblastomas (GBM) are a challenge in 
their diagnosis and treatment. There are few effective therapies for these 
tumors, and patients with GBM fare poorly, even after aggressive surgery, 
chemotherapy, and radiation. Over the last decade, it is now appreciated that 
these tumors are composed of numerous distinct tumoral and non-tumoral cell 
populations, which could each influence the overall tumor biology and response 
to therapies. Monocytes have been proved to actively participate in tumor 
growth, giving rise to the support of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). In 
GBM, TAMs represent up to one half of the tumor mass cells, including both 
infiltrating macrophages and resident brain microglia. Infiltrating 
macrophages/monocytes constituted ~ 85% of the total TAM population, they have 
immune functions, and they can release a wide array of growth factors and 
cytokines in response to those factors produced by tumor and non-tumor cells 
from the tumor microenvironment (TME). A brief review of the literature shows 
that this cell population has been increasingly studied in GBM TME to understand 
its role in tumor progression and therapeutic resistance. Through the knowledge 
of its biology and protumoral function, the development of therapeutic 
strategies that employ their recruitment as well as the modulation of their 
immunological phenotype, and even the eradication of the cell population, can be 
harnessed for therapeutic benefit. This revision aims to summarize GBM TME and 
localization in tumor niches with special focus on TAM population, its origin 
and functions in tumor progression and resistance to conventional and 
experimental GBM treatments. Moreover, recent advances on the development of TAM 
cell targeting and new cellular therapeutic strategies based on 
monocyte/macrophages recruitment to eradicate GBM are discussed as complementary 
therapeutics.

OBJECTIVES: Large amounts of healthcare data are now generated via patient 
health records, records of diagnosis and treatment, smart devices, and 
wearables. Extracting insights from such data can transform healthcare from a 
traditional, symptom-driven practice into precisely personalized medicine. 
Dialysis treatments generate a vast amount of data, with more than 100 
parameters that must be regulated for ideal treatment outcomes. When 
complications occur, understanding electrolyte parameters and predicting their 
outcomes to deliver the optimal dialysis dosing for each patient is a challenge. 
This study focused on refining dialysis dosing by utilizing emerging data from 
the growing number of dialysis patients to improve patients' quality of life and 
well-being.
METHODS: Exploratory data analysis and data prediction approaches were performed 
to gather insights from patients' vital electrolytes on how to improve the 
patients' dialysis dosing. Four predictive models were constructed to predict 
electrolyte levels through various dialysis parameters.
RESULTS: The decision tree model showed excellent performance and more accurate 
results than the support vector machine, linear regression, and neural network 
models.
CONCLUSIONS: The predictive models identified that pre-dialysis blood urea 
nitrogen, pre-weight, dry weight, anticoagulation, and sex had the most 
significant effects on electrolyte concentrations. Such models could fine-tune 
dialysis dosing levels for the growing number of dialysis patients to improve 
each patient's quality of life, life expectancy, and well-being, and to reduce 
costs, efforts, and time consumption for both patients and physicians. The 
study's results need to be validated on a larger scale.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Oral cancer is now a top priority for non-communicable 
illnesses and universal health care plans, according to the WHO. There is no 
general estimate of the incidence of oral cavity cancer in Iran, despite 
multiple investigations. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the 
age-standardized incidence rate (ASR) of oral cavity cancers in Iran.
METHOD: In accordance with the MOOSE (Meta-analyses of Observational Studies in 
Epidemiology) Checklist recommendations, this systematic review was conducted. 
PubMed/MEDLINE, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, Embase, Scopus, ProQuest, and 
Google Scholar were used as the international databases for the systematic 
literature search, while SID (Scientific Information Database), Magiran and 
element were used as the Iranian databases. The heterogeneity of the research 
will be evaluated by means of the inverse variance and Cochran Q tests, along 
with random-effect models. It was determined what caused the heterogeneity using 
a meta-regression model. By eliminating experiments one at a time, sensitivity 
analysis was used. The meta-analysis was corrected utilizing the Trim-and-fill 
method due to the identification of noteworthy publication bias via the Egger's 
test and asymmetry of the funnel plot.
RESULTS: This research incorporated a total of 22 journal articles. The pooled 
ASR of oral cavity cancer for males and females was estimated at 1.96 (95% CI: 
1.65-2.26) (Q statistic = 1118.09, df = 25, p < .0001, I2  = 97.8%), and 1.46 
(95% CI: 1.14-1.77) (Q statistic = 2576.99, df = 26, p < .0001, I2  = 99.0%), 
respectively. According to the funnel plots and Egger's test, there is no 
evidence of publication bias in studies reporting on males (bias = 1.3220, 95% 
CI: -3.9571, 6.6012, p = .610), but for ASR in females, Egger's test was 
significant (bias = -7.6366, 95% CI: 2.2141, 13.05904, p = .008). Based on 
Trim-and-fill methods, overall ASR corrected in females was estimated to be 1.36 
(95% CI: 1.05%-1.66%).
CONCLUSION: Iran's oral cavity cancer incidence was lower than the global 
average, but owing to variables including an aging population, a rise in life 
expectancy, and exposure to risk factors like smoking, we anticipate an 
increasing trend.

The increase in life expectancy is accompanied with an increased consultation of 
age-related pathologies including endocrine disorders. Two main areas are 
focusing the attention of medical and social research in older population: the 
diagnosis and care of this heterogeneous population, and the interventional 
measures potentially useful to mitigate age-related functional declines and to 
increase health and quality of lifespan. Thus, better understanding the 
physiopathology of aging and establishing accurate diagnostic and personalized 
approaches are a priority and currently an unmet need of the medical community. 
The endocrine system plays a major role in survival and lifespan through 
regulating vital processes such as energy consumption and optimizing the stress 
response among others. The aim of this paper is to review the physiological 
evolution of the main hormonal functions in aging and its clinical translation 
to improve our approach to the aging patient.

The purposes of this study were to examine the compositional changes in the 
salivary microbiota according to the severity of periodontal disease and to 
verify whether the distribution of specific bacterial species in saliva can 
distinguish the severity of disease. Saliva samples were collected from 8 
periodontally healthy controls, 16 patients with gingivitis, 19 patients with 
moderate periodontitis, and 29 patients with severe periodontitis. The V3 and V4 
regions of the 16S rRNA gene in the samples were sequenced, and the levels of 9 
bacterial species showing significant differences among the groups by sequencing 
analysis were identified using quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). The predictive 
performance of each bacterial species in distinguishing the severity of disease 
was evaluated using a receiver operating characteristic curve. Twenty-nine 
species, including Porphyromonas gingivalis, increased as the severity of 
disease increased, whereas 6 species, including Rothia denticola, decreased. The 
relative abundances of P. gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia, Filifactor alocis, 
and Prevotella intermedia determined by qPCR were significantly different among 
the groups. The three bacterial species P. gingivalis, T. forsythia, and F. 
alocis were positively correlated with the sum of the full-mouth probing depth 
and were moderately accurate at distinguishing the severity of periodontal 
disease. In conclusion, the salivary microbiota showed gradual compositional 
changes according to the severity of periodontitis, and the levels of P. 
gingivalis, T. forsythia, and F. alocis in mouth rinse saliva had the ability to 
distinguish the severity of periodontal disease. IMPORTANCE Periodontal disease 
is one of the most widespread medical conditions and the leading cause of tooth 
loss, imposing high economic costs and an increasing burden worldwide as life 
expectancy increases. Changes in the subgingival bacterial community during the 
progression of periodontal disease can affect the entire oral ecosystem, and 
bacteria in saliva can reflect the degree of bacterial imbalance in the oral 
cavity. This study explored whether the specific bacterial species in saliva can 
distinguish the severity of periodontal disease by analyzing the salivary 
microbiota and suggested P. gingivalis, T. forsythia, and F. alocis as 
biomarkers for distinguishing the severity of periodontal disease in saliva.

Endocrine care of pediatric and adult patients continues to be plagued by health 
and health care disparities that are perpetuated by the basic structures of our 
health systems and research modalities, as well as policies that impact access 
to care and social determinants of health. This scientific statement expands the 
Society's 2012 statement by focusing on endocrine disease disparities in the 
pediatric population and sexual and gender minority populations. These include 
pediatric and adult lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, intersex, and 
asexual (LGBTQIA) persons. The writing group focused on highly prevalent 
conditions-growth disorders, puberty, metabolic bone disease, type 1 (T1D) and 
type 2 (T2D) diabetes mellitus, prediabetes, and obesity. Several important 
findings emerged. Compared with females and non-White children, non-Hispanic 
White males are more likely to come to medical attention for short stature. 
Racially and ethnically diverse populations and males are underrepresented in 
studies of pubertal development and attainment of peak bone mass, with current 
norms based on European populations. Like adults, racial and ethnic minority 
youth suffer a higher burden of disease from obesity, T1D and T2D, and have less 
access to diabetes treatment technologies and bariatric surgery. LGBTQIA youth 
and adults also face discrimination and multiple barriers to endocrine care due 
to pathologizing sexual orientation and gender identity, lack of culturally 
competent care providers, and policies. Multilevel interventions to address 
these disparities are required. Inclusion of racial, ethnic, and LGBTQIA 
populations in longitudinal life course studies is needed to assess growth, 
puberty, and attainment of peak bone mass. Growth and development charts may 
need to be adapted to non-European populations. In addition, extension of these 
studies will be required to understand the clinical and physiologic consequences 
of interventions to address abnormal development in these populations. Health 
policies should be recrafted to remove barriers in care for children with 
obesity and/or diabetes and for LGBTQIA children and adults to facilitate 
comprehensive access to care, therapeutics, and technological advances. Public 
health interventions encompassing collection of accurate demographic and social 
needs data, including the intersection of social determinants of health with 
health outcomes, and enactment of population health level interventions will be 
essential tools.

IMPORTANCE: Amid efforts in the US to promote health equity, there is a need to 
assess recent progress in reducing excess deaths and years of potential life 
lost among the Black population compared with the White population.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate trends in excess mortality and years of potential life 
lost among the Black population compared with the White population.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Serial cross-sectional study using US 
national data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from 1999 
through 2020. We included data from non-Hispanic White and non-Hispanic Black 
populations across all age groups.
EXPOSURES: Race as documented in the death certificates.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Excess age-adjusted all-cause mortality, 
cause-specific mortality, age-specific mortality, and years of potential life 
lost rates (per 100 000 individuals) among the Black population compared with 
the White population.
RESULTS: From 1999 to 2011, the age-adjusted excess mortality rate declined from 
404 to 211 excess deaths per 100 000 individuals among Black males (P for trend 
<.001). However, the rate plateaued from 2011 through 2019 (P for trend = .98) 
and increased in 2020 to 395-rates not seen since 2000. Among Black females, the 
rate declined from 224 excess deaths per 100 000 individuals in 1999 to 87 in 
2015 (P for trend <.001). There was no significant change between 2016 and 2019 
(P for trend = .71) and in 2020 rates increased to 192-levels not seen since 
2005. The trends in rates of excess years of potential life lost followed a 
similar pattern. From 1999 to 2020, the disproportionately higher mortality 
rates in Black males and females resulted in 997 623 and 628 464 excess deaths, 
respectively, representing a loss of more than 80 million years of life. Heart 
disease had the highest excess mortality rates, and the excess years of 
potential life lost rates were largest among infants and middle-aged adults.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Over a recent 22-year period, the Black population in 
the US experienced more than 1.63 million excess deaths and more than 80 million 
excess years of life lost when compared with the White population. After a 
period of progress in reducing disparities, improvements stalled, and 
differences between the Black population and the White population worsened in 
2020.

Sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (sCJD) is the most common form of prion 
diseases. The causes of sCJD are still unknown and exogenous factors may play a 
role. Worldwide, the number of patients with sCJD has progressively increased 
over time. This increase can be partly explained by increasing life expectancy 
and better case ascertainment, but a true increase in the number of sCJD cases 
cannot be excluded. We estimated mortality rates from sCJD in France (1992-2016) 
and studied variation in mortality rates by age, period, and time.We included 
all cases aged 45-89 years old who died with a probable/definite sCJD diagnosis 
based on the French national surveillance network. We used age-period-cohort 
(APC) Poisson regression models to study variation in mortality rates by sex, 
age, period, and time.A total of 2475 sCJD cases aged 45-89 years were included. 
Mortality rates increased with age, reached a peak between 75 and 79 years, and 
decreased thereafter. Mortality rates were higher in women than men at younger 
ages and lower at older ages. The full APC model with a sex×age interaction 
provided the best fit to the data, thus in favour of sex, age, period, and 
cohort effects on mortality rates. In particular, mortality rates increased 
progressively with successive birth cohorts.Based on 25 years of active 
surveillance in France, we show evidence for sex, age, period, and cohort 
effects on sCJD mortality. The identification of cohort effects suggests that 
environmental exposures may play a role in sCJD etiology.

INTRODUCTION: Pembrolizumab was approved in the US as adjuvant treatment of 
patients with stage IIB or IIC melanoma post-complete resection, based on 
prolonged recurrence-free survival vs. placebo in the Phase 3 KEYNOTE-716 trial. 
This study aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of pembrolizumab vs. 
observation as adjuvant treatment of stage IIB or IIC melanoma from a US health 
sector perspective.
METHODS: A Markov cohort model was constructed to simulate patient transitions 
among recurrence-free, locoregional recurrence, distant metastasis, and death. 
Transition probabilities from recurrence-free and locoregional recurrence were 
estimated via multistate parametric modeling based on patient-level data from an 
interim analysis (data cutoff date: 04-Jan-2022). Transition probabilities from 
distant metastasis were based on KEYNOTE-006 data and network meta-analysis. 
Costs were estimated in 2022 US dollars. Utilities were based on applying US 
value set to EQ-5D-5L data collected in trial and literature.
RESULTS: Compared to observation, pembrolizumab increased total costs by $80,423 
and provided gains of 1.17 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and 1.24 life 
years (LYs) over lifetime, resulting in incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of 
$68,736/QALY and $65,059/LY. The higher upfront costs of adjuvant treatment were 
largely offset by reductions in costs of subsequent treatment, downstream 
disease management, and terminal care, reflecting the lower risk of recurrence 
with pembrolizumab. Results were robust in one-way sensitivity and scenario 
analyses. At a $150,000/QALY threshold, pembrolizumab was cost-effective vs. 
observation in 73.9% of probabilistic simulations that considered parameter 
uncertainty.
CONCLUSION: As an adjuvant treatment of stage IIB or IIC melanoma, pembrolizumab 
was estimated to reduce recurrence, extend patients' life and QALYs, and be 
cost-effective versus observation at a US willingness-to-pay threshold.

INTRODUCTION: The primary aim is to determine the factors associated with breast 
cancer-related lymphedema and to identify new associated factors for the 
recurrence of breast cancer and depression. The secondary objective is to 
investigate the incidence of breast cancer-related events (breast cancer-related 
lymphedema, recurrence of breast cancer, and depression). Finally, we want to 
explore and validate the complex relationship among multiple factors influencing 
breast cancer complications and breast cancer recurrence.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A cohort study of females with unilateral breast cancer 
will be conducted in West China Hospital between February 2023 and February 
2026. Breast cancer survivors in the age range of 17-55 will be recruited before 
breast cancer surgery. We will recruit 1557 preoperative patients with a first 
invasive breast cancer diagnosis. Consenting breast cancer survivors will 
complete demographic information, clinicopathological factors, surgery 
information, baseline information, and a baseline depression questionnaire. Data 
will be collected at four stages: the perioperative stage, chemotherapy therapy 
stage, radiation therapy stage, and follow-up stage. Data including the 
incidence and correlation of breast cancer-related lymphedema, breast cancer 
recurrence, depression, and medical cost will be collected and computed through 
the four stages above. For every statistical analysis, the participants will be 
classified into two groups based on whether they develop secondary lymphedema. 
Incidence rates of breast cancer recurrence and depression will be calculated 
separately for groups. Multivariate logistic regression will be used to 
determine whether secondary lymphedema and other parameters can predict breast 
cancer recurrence.
DISCUSSION: Our prospective cohort study will contribute to establishing an 
early detection program for breast cancer-related lymphedema and recurrence of 
breast cancer, which are both associated with poor quality of life and reduced 
life expectancy. Our study can also provide new insights into the physical, 
economic, treatment-related and mental burdens of breast cancer survivors.

BACKGROUND: Disability-adjusted life years (DALY) are a common public health 
metric used to estimate disease burden. The DALY due to pediatric 
out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) in the United States is unknown. We aimed 
to estimate pediatric OHCA DALY and to compare it with the other leading causes 
of pediatric death and disability in the United States.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective observational analysis of the national 
Cardiac Arrest Registry to Enhance Survival database. DALY were calculated as 
the sum of years of life lost and years lived with disability. Years of life 
lost were calculated using all pediatric (age <18 years) nontraumatic OHCA from 
the Cardiac Arrest Registry to Enhance Survival from 2016 to 2020. Disability 
weights based on cerebral performance category scores, an outcome measure of 
neurologic function, were used to estimate years lived with disability . Data 
were reported as total, mean, and rate per 100 000 individuals, and were 
compared with the leading causes of pediatric DALY in the United States 
published by the Global Burden of Disease study for 2019.
RESULTS: Totally 11 177 OHCA met the study inclusion criteria. A modest increase 
in total OHCA DALY in the United States was observed from 407 500 (years of life 
lost = 407 435 and years lived with disability =65) in 2016 to 415 113 (years of 
life lost = 415 055 and years lived with disability =58) in 2020. The DALY rate 
increased from 553.3 per 100 000 individuals in 2016 to 568.3 per 100 000 
individuals in 2020. For 2019, OHCA was the 10th leading cause of pediatric DALY 
lost behind neonatal disorders, injuries, mental disorders, premature birth, 
musculoskeletal disorders, congenital birth defects, skin diseases, chronic 
respiratory diseases, and asthma.
CONCLUSIONS: Nontraumatic OHCA is one of the top 10 leading causes of annual 
pediatric DALY lost in the United States.

STUDY OBJECTIVES: To describe early diagnostic clues in Cyclin-Dependent 
Kinase-Like 5 (CDKL5) refractory encephalopathy, to improve treatment 
strategies.
METHODS: We retrospectively studied 35 patients (25 females, 10 males) with 
CDKL5 gene mutations or deletion, focusing on their early seizure semiology, the 
electroencephalogram (EEG) pattern, the effect of treatment, and developmental 
outcome.
RESULTS: The first seizures were recognizable and consisted of tonic, then 
clonic, and spasms phases, occurring in sleep at a median age of 6 weeks. 
Clusters of spasms were observed in quiet sleep or slow-wave sleep (SWS), with 
screaming, staring, and arms' extension that mimicked sleep terror in 28 of 35 
patients (80%). Programmed awakening prevented these spasms in 9 of 16 patients 
and small doses of clonazepam given at night improved epilepsy in 14 of 23 
patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Peculiar seizures with spasms starting in SWS are an early 
diagnostic clue in infants with CDKL5 encephalopathy. Sleep video-EEG polygraphy 
is an easy tool to disclose these early seizures and epileptic spasms in infants 
during the first months of life while polysomnography is unlikely to give a 
contribution at that early age. While conventional antiepileptic treatment and 
corticosteroids are poorly, transiently, or not efficient, therapeutic strategy 
used for sleep terror could help, although the mechanism of spasms generation in 
SWS needs to be elucidated.

BACKGROUND: Extending the number of active working years is an important goal 
both for maintaining individual quality of life and safeguarding social security 
systems. Against this background, we examined the development of healthy and 
unhealthy working life expectancy (HWLE/UHWLE) in the general population and for 
different educational groups.
METHODS: The study is based on data from the German Socio-Economic Panel study, 
including 88 966 women and 85 585 men aged 50-64 years and covering four time 
periods (2001-05, 2006-2010, 2011-2015 and 2016-2020). Estimates of HWLE and 
UHWLE in terms of self-rated health (SRH) were calculated using the Sullivan's 
method. We adjusted for hours worked and stratified by gender and educational 
level.
RESULTS: Working-hours adjusted HWLE at age 50 increased in women and men from 
4.52 years (95% CI 4.42 to 4.62) in 2001-2005 to 6.88 years (95% CI 6.78 to 
6.98) in 2016-2020 and from 7.54 years (95% CI 7.43 to 7.65) to 9.36 years 
(95% CI 9.25 to 9.46), respectively. Moreover, UHWLE also rose with the 
proportion of working life spent in good SRH (health ratio) remaining largely 
stable. At age 50, educational differences in HWLE between the lowest and 
highest educational groups increased over time in women and in men from 3.72 to 
4.99 years and from 4.06 to 4.40 years, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: We found evidence for an overall increase but also for substantial 
educational differences in working-hours adjusted HWLE, which widened between 
the lowest and highest educational group over time. Our findings suggest that 
policies and health prevention measures at workplace should be more focused on 
workers with low levels of education in order to extend their HWLE.

Normal circulatory function is a key determinant of disease-free life expectancy 
(healthspan). Indeed, pathologies affecting the cardiovascular system, which are 
growing in prevalence, are the leading cause of global morbidity, disability and 
mortality, whereas the maintenance of cardiovascular health is necessary to 
promote both organismal healthspan and lifespan. Therefore, cardiovascular 
ageing might precede or even underlie body-wide, age-related health 
deterioration. In this Review, we posit that eight molecular hallmarks are 
common denominators in cardiovascular ageing, namely disabled macroautophagy, 
loss of proteostasis, genomic instability (in particular, clonal haematopoiesis 
of indeterminate potential), epigenetic alterations, mitochondrial dysfunction, 
cell senescence, dysregulated neurohormonal signalling and inflammation. We also 
propose a hierarchical order that distinguishes primary (upstream) from 
antagonistic and integrative (downstream) hallmarks of cardiovascular ageing. 
Finally, we discuss how targeting each of the eight hallmarks might be 
therapeutically exploited to attenuate residual cardiovascular risk in older 
individuals.

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disease that results in dysfunction of the CF 
transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein, which is a chloride and 
bicarbonate channel expressed in the apical portion of epithelial cells of 
various organs. Dysfunction of that protein results in diverse clinical 
manifestations, primarily involving the respiratory and gastrointestinal 
systems, impairing quality of life and reducing life expectancy. Although CF is 
still an incurable pathology, the therapeutic and prognostic perspectives are 
now totally different and much more favorable. The purpose of these guidelines 
is to define evidence-based recommendations regarding the use of pharmacological 
agents in the treatment of the pulmonary symptoms of CF in Brazil. Questions in 
the Patients of interest, Intervention to be studied, Comparison of 
interventions, and Outcome of interest (PICO) format were employed to address 
aspects related to the use of modulators of this protein (ivacaftor, 
lumacaftor+ivacaftor, and tezacaftor+ivacaftor), use of dornase alfa, 
eradication therapy and chronic suppression of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 
eradication of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Burkholderia 
cepacia complex. To formulate the PICO questions, a group of Brazilian 
specialists was assembled and a systematic review was carried out on the themes, 
with meta-analysis when applicable. The results obtained were analyzed in terms 
of the strength of the evidence compiled, the recommendations being devised by 
employing the GRADE approach. We believe that these guidelines represent a major 
advance to be incorporated into the approach to patients with CF, mainly aiming
