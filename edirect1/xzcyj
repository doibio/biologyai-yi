The novel COVID-19 pandemic has placed medical triage decision-making in the 
spotlight. As life-saving ventilators become scarce, clinicians are being forced 
to allocate scarce resources in even the wealthiest countries. The pervasiveness 
of air travel and high rate of transmission has caused this pandemic to spread 
swiftly throughout the world. Ethical triage decisions are commonly based on the 
utilitarian approach of maximising total benefits and life expectancy. We 
present triage guidelines from Italy, USA and the UK as well as the Jewish 
ethical prospective on medical triage. The Jewish tradition also recognises the 
utilitarian approach but there is disagreement between the rabbis whether human 
discretion has any role in the allocation of scarce resources and triage 
decision-making.

PURPOSE: This study investigated the psychometric yield of extension of the 
EQ-5D-5L with a cognitive domain (EQ-5D+C) in a mixed cohort of trauma patients 
with repeated data.
METHODS: A stratified sample of patients that presented at the emergency 
department filled out a follow-up survey 6 and 12 months after trauma. The 
surveys included the EQ-5D-5L+C, EQ-VAS, and the impact of events scale-revised 
(IES-R), a validated post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) self-assessment 
scale. Generally, results of the EQ-5D and EQ-5D+C were compared. Psychometrics 
included the following: distributional features (ceiling/floor effects), 
discriminatory performance, convergent validity with the EQ-VAS as reference, 
and responsiveness to change. Psychometric properties were compared between 
predefined subgroups based on conditions with cognitive impact (Traumatic Brain 
Injury (TBI)/PTSD).
RESULTS: In total, 1799 trauma patients responded 6 and 12 months after trauma, 
including 107 respondents with PTSD, and 273 with TBI. Six months post-trauma, 
ceiling of the EQ-5D (26.3%) was reduced with 2.2% with the additional cognitive 
domain. Using EQ-VAS as reference, convergent validity increased slightly with 
the addition of the cognitive domain: correlation increasing from 0.651 to 
0.664. Cognitive level was found to slightly improve over time in TBI (delta: 
0.04) and PTSD patients (delta: 0.05), while (almost) no change was found in 
patients without TBI and PTSD.
CONCLUSION: Adding a cognitive domain to the EQ-5D-5L slightly improved 
measurement properties and better captured change in health status for trauma 
patients with TBI and PTSD. Inclusion of the cognitive domain in the EQ-5D-5L 
when measuring in populations with cognitive problems should be considered.

BACKGROUND: As waxy maize is considered a key economic crop in Korea, an 
understanding of its genetic variation and differentiation is fundamental for 
the selective plant breeding. The maize genome is primarily composed of 
transposable elements, for which large and stable insertions generate variations 
that reflect selection during evolution.
OBJECTIVES: This study was to elucidate the genetic diversity based on the 
contribution of TEs and to investigate the effect of Mu transposition on the 
genetic divergence of waxy and common maize. We also performed an association 
analysis on these inbred lines to determine the Mu insertions associated with 
agronomic traits.
METHODS: In this study, we utilized a Mutator-based transposon display method to 
study the genetic diversity and population structure of 40 waxy and 40 common 
inbred lines of maize in the Gangwon Agricultural Research and Extension 
Services collection at the Maize Research Institute.
RESULTS: We detected polymorphisms in 86.33% of 278 Mutator (Mu) anchored loci, 
reflecting the activity of the Mu element and its contribution to genetic 
variation. Common maize showed a substantial amount of genetic diversity, which 
was greater than that observed in waxy maize. Principal-coordinate and 
neighbor-joining cluster analyzes consistently supported the presence of two 
genetically distinct groups. However, the distribution of genetic variation 
within the populations was much higher than the genetic differentiation among 
the populations. To explore the contribution of the Mu element to phenotypic 
variation, we analyzed the associations with ten important agronomical traits. 
On the basis of the combined results from two models (QGLM and Q + KLM), we 
found significant associations between seven Mu loci and four different traits.
CONCLUSIONS: These results will assist waxy maize breeders in choosing parental 
lines and be useful for marker-assisted selection.

PURPOSE: To evaluate the efficacy of first-line and not-conventional 
antineoplastic drug combinations in colorectal adenocarcinoma primary cultures 
(CRAC PCs).
METHODS: The efficacy and safety of 21 drug combinations (DCs) were evaluated 
using a simplified adenosine triphosphate-based chemotherapy response assay 
(sATP-CRA). The efficacy of each DC was reported as the percentage of cell death 
(PCD) produced on each of 12 CRAC-PCs, and the safety of each DC was evaluated 
as a safety window (SW). The SW was calculated as the quotient of PCD-CRAC 
PC/PCD-hMSC-TA (human mesenchymal stem cells derived from adipose tissue). Nine 
DCs contained 5-fluorouracil and oxaliplatin, and 1-3 non-front line drugs 
(NFLDs [carboplatin, doxorubicin, cisplatin, aspirin, or 3,3' 
diindolylmethane]). The other 11 DCs only contained 2-4 NFLDs.
RESULTS: The efficacy and safety each DC were highly variable and depended on 
each CRAC PC and DC. The usefulness of DCs was considered as a combination of 
PCD >20 and an SW >0.6: 13 /21 DCs (62%) met the requirements of efficacy and 
safety on 7/12 CRAC PCs (58.3%).
CONCLUSIONS: The resistance to 5-fluorouracil/oxaliplatin of CRAC PCs and the 
usefulness of seven new DCs strongly suggest the convenience of performing ex 
vivo individualized assays to evaluate DCs, and implement new and more useful 
treatments, instead of submitting patients to standardized chemotherapies in a 
blinded manner. Approaches such as this and properly evaluated in clinical 
assays could increase the life expectancy of patients with cancer and improve 
their quality of life.

Recent trials have shown impressive results in low-risk patients undergoing 
Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement (TAVR) with low procedural complication 
rates, short hospital length of stay, zero mortality, and zero disabling stroke 
at 30 days and have led to a Food and Drug Administration indication for TAVR in 
these patients. The long-term data on subclinical leaflet thrombosis, valve 
durability, effects of pacemaker implantation, right ventricular pacing, and 
progressive paravalvular leak is unclear. We describe clinical and procedural 
considerations for patient selection and introduce future potential procedural 
challenges. Finally, we discuss the importance of considering life expectancy 
and durability prior to TAVR in this low risk relatively young cohort and 
emphasize the importance of a heart team approach.

BACKGROUND: The cost-effectiveness of bariatric surgery to achieve weight loss 
prior to total hip arthroplasty (THA), and decrease the complications and costs 
associated with THA in the morbidly obese, is unknown. This study evaluated the 
cost-effectiveness of bariatric surgery prior to THA for morbidly obese patients 
with end-stage hip osteoarthritis (OA).
METHODS: A state-transition Markov model was constructed to compare the 
cost-utility of 2 treatment protocols for patients with morbid obesity and 
end-stage hip OA: (1) immediate THA and (2) bariatric surgery 2 years prior to 
THA (combined protocol). The analysis was performed from both a payer and a 
societal perspective using direct and indirect costs over a 40-year time 
horizon. Utilities, associated costs, and probabilities for health state 
transitions were derived from the literature. One-way, 2-way and probabilistic 
sensitivity analyses were performed to validate the robustness of the base case 
results, using the standard willingness-to-pay threshold of 
$100,000/quality-adjusted life years.
RESULTS: From the societal perspective, the combined protocol was more effective 
(13.16 vs 12.26) with less cost ($91,717 vs $92,684) and thus was the dominant 
strategy over immediate THA. These results were stable across broad ranges for 
independent model variables. Monte Carlo simulation with 100,000 samples 
demonstrated that bariatric surgery prior to THA was the preferred 
cost-effective strategy over 95% of the time from both a societal and payer 
perspective.
CONCLUSION: In the morbidly obese patient with end-stage hip OA, bariatric 
surgery prior to THA is a cost-effective strategy for improving quality of life 
and decreasing societal and payer costs.

Alhydwan, has been used in bakery products for many years in South of Yemen. 
Alhydwan primary function in bakery products is to inhibit moisture content 
during storage, leading to improved shelf life. However, as a fresh strategy to 
bread staling, no extensive study has been conducted to evaluate its potential. 
The present study therefore examined the alhydwan as a comparison with 
Carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) at 0.5% (w/w) level in dough rheology improvement, 
microstructure, quality parameters and delayed wheat bread staling. The CMC or 
alhydwan for farinograph characteristics comprising the dough's portrayed showed 
greater water absorption, while growth and stability time was significantly 
decreased. Staling of bread, the findings showed that in both alhydwan and CMC 
minimized crumb hardening frequency and enhanced freshness, quality and 
retention ability for moisture, making the bread softer and postponed staling. 
The microstructure of CMC or alhydwan supplemented formulation showed the 
distinguishable characteristics and constituents that could explain, to some 
degree, that the CMC and alhydwan had antistaling effect. The incorporation of 
alhydwan such as CMC into the formulation of bread could thus play a sustainable 
role in improving the quality of bread by having an extended shelf life.

It Only Affects Me: Pharmaceutical Regulation and Harm to Others.

Kianpour CK(1).

Author information:
(1)Georgia State University, Atlanta, USA. ckianpour1@gsu.edu.

In her Pharmaceutical Freedom, Jessica Flanigan argues that antibiotics can be 
regulated consistent with her otherwise largely deregulatory view with respect 
to pharmaceuticals and recreational drugs. I contend in this essay that the 
reasons for justifying antibiotic regulation are reasons that can be offered to 
justify the regulation of many other drugs, both pharmaceutical and 
recreational. After laying out the specifics of Flanigan's view, I suggest that 
it is amenable to the regulation of drugs like varenicline. Though such drugs 
can legitimately improve the quality of a patient's life by helping them quit 
smoking, they could be permissibly regulated if they expose others to 
impermissible risks. I then argue that recreational drugs like alcohol could be 
regulated using the same reasoning. In the penultimate section of this essay, I 
anticipate objections that one might have to my extension of arguments favoring 
antibiotic regulation to drugs correlated with aggression. Flanigan might find 
my extrapolation of her view as entirely plausible and accept that her view is 
relatively friendly to these regulations, or she might reconsider her antibiotic 
caveat if these regulations are overly paternalistic on her understanding. I 
conclude by briefly considering the benefits and drawbacks of adopting each 
view.

The effect of five photoperiods (0:24, 6:18; 12:12, 18:6, and 24:0 light:dark 
(L:D)) on the development, reproduction, and survival of the predatory thrips 
Scolothrips longicornis Priesner fed on the two-spotted spider mite, Tetranychus 
urticae Koch, was tested under laboratory conditions at 60% RH and 25°C. 
Development time of almost all immature stages in S. longicornis was the 
shortest under long day lengths (18:6 and 24:0 L:D). The adult duration of both 
sexes decreased with increasing light length from 6 to 24 h. The longevity of 
male and female decreased with increasing light length. Under a 12:12 L:D 
photoperiod, S. longicornis females had the longest oviposition period and 
longevity, highest net reproductive rate (R0 = 15.37), intrinsic rate of natural 
increase (r = 0.141), and finite rate of increase (λ = 1.151). Life table 
parameters showed a significant difference with various photoperiods. The 
consequences of the present research demonstrated that a 12:12 L:D photoperiod 
is the most favorable for the reproduction and development of S. longicornis fed 
on T. urticae, and that for mas rearing for augmentative biological control 
programs, would be the ideal photoperiod to maximize production.

The influence of education on health: an empirical assessment of OECD countries 
for the period 1995-2015.

York, NY 10023 USA.

BACKGROUND: A clear understanding of the macro-level contexts in which education 
impacts health is integral to improving national health administration and 
policy. In this research, we use a visual analytic approach to explore the 
association between education and health over a 20-year period for countries 
around the world.
METHOD: Using empirical data from the OECD and the World Bank for 26 OECD 
countries for the years 1995-2015, we identify patterns/associations between 
education and health indicators. By incorporating pre- and post-educational 
attainment indicators, we highlight the dual role of education as both a driver 
of opportunity as well as of inequality.
RESULTS: Adults with higher educational attainment have better health and 
lifespans compared to their less-educated peers. We highlight that tertiary 
education, particularly, is critical in influencing infant mortality, life 
expectancy, child vaccination, and enrollment rates. In addition, an economy 
needs to consider potential years of life lost (premature mortality) as a 
measure of health quality.
CONCLUSIONS: We bring to light the health disparities across countries and 
suggest implications for governments to target educational interventions that 
can reduce inequalities and improve health. Our country-level findings on NEET 
(Not in Employment, Education or Training) rates offer implications for 
economies to address a broad array of vulnerabilities ranging from unemployment, 
school life expectancy, and labor market discouragement. The health effects of 
education are at the grass roots-creating better overall self-awareness on 
personal health and making healthcare more accessible.

Products, Wuhan Polytechnic University, Wuhan, PR China.

The potential use of ultraviolet (UV)-C (254 nm) to extend postharvest shelf 
life of fresh unprocessed lotus root (Nelumbo nucifera G.) was determined. UV 
treatment for 30 and 60 min effectively reduced weight loss, improved moisture, 
color retention, and soluble solids of samples when stored at 25°C for 15 days. 
Microbial growth inhibition of UV was evidenced by 1.8 and 1.0 log reductions in 
the 30 and 60 min-treated samples. Phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) activity 
and total phenol contents (TPCs) detected in lotus root were higher, while 
oxidative enzymes peroxidase (POD) and polyphenol oxidase (PPO) were inhibited 
by UV treatment. Gallic acid, gallocatechin, and catechin levels were increased 
in 30 min-treated samples by about 0.9, 13.4, 8.0 mg/100 g. The results suggest 
that extension of postharvest storage life by UV-C is most likely through the 
protective roles exerted from stimulation of the phenylpropanoid pathway in the 
treated roots. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Unlike previous studies that are mainly 
focused on shelf life extension of processed products of the rhizome, this study 
determines the potential use of a nonchemical and ecologically friendly 
ultraviolet (UV-C) treatment to extend shelf life of intact uncut fresh lotus 
root. Our results demonstrated that UV-C treatment significantly prolonged the 
shelf life of lotus root. Use of this method is promising as a treatment to 
improve postharvest storage life of fresh lotus root, to improve its export 
potential and help to address unmet local demands for the crop.

BACKGROUND: Life expectancy of the U.S. population will continue to rise, 
increasing the workforce demands in the treatment of musculoskeletal 
pathologies. With a declining primary care physician workforce, physical 
therapists (PT) may be in a unique situation to help absorb this demand.
OBJECTIVE: Our primary objective was to compare physical function between two 
primary care groups, a "physical therapy-led pathway" versus "physician-led 
pathway" in the management of recent-onset musculoskeletal pain at 1-month 
follow-up. Our secondary objectives were to compare other patient-important 
outcomes between the groups at 1 month and health utilization at 1 month and 1 
year.
METHODS: A pragmatic randomized controlled trial with a 1-year follow-up was 
conducted, enrolling 150 university employees with recent onset musculoskeletal 
pain. Participants were randomized at first contact to either a PT-led pathway 
or physician-led pathway. The primary outcome was change in Patient-Reported 
Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) ShortForm v1-Physical Function 
10a at 1 month; groups were compared with repeated measurement of analysis of 
variance and chi-square for both primary and secondary outcomes, except for 
satisfaction score at 1 month, which was cross-sectionally compared by 
independent two-sample t-test. At 1 year, healthcare utilization was assessed 
through medical record extraction, and healthcare utilization was converted to 
total episodic standard cost. Utilization was compared between groups using 
chi-square and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests.
RESULTS: Both groups demonstrated improvement at 1-month follow-up but showed no 
significant between-group difference in mean PROMIS scores at 1 month (PT-led 
pathway vs physician-led pathway, 2.04, [95% CI -0.28 to 4.36]; P = .082). At 1 
year, there was no difference in healthcare utilization or cost between groups. 
No harm or misdiagnosis was found, filed, or reported by participants at 1 year.
CONCLUSION: This study shows equivalence in outcomes for two low-cost 
musculoskeletal care pathways with no risk of harm. These results reinforce 
other findings in the literature that support PTs as safe and effective initial 
providers for individuals with musculoskeletal disorders.

Schizophrenia: opportunities to improve outcomes and reduce economic burden 
through managed care.

Schizophrenia is a complicated chronic disease affecting approximately 3.5 
million people in the United States, and its annual healthcare costs exceed $155 
billion. People living with schizophrenia often experience a reduced quality of 
life (QOL) and are more likely to be homeless, unemployed, or living in poverty 
compared with the general population. Life expectancy for patients with 
schizophrenia is 15 to 20 years below the average and is complicated by numerous 
comorbidities, such as weight gain, increased cardiovascular risk, and changes 
in mood and cognition. Treatment nonadherence can increase the risk of relapse, 
rehospitalization, and self-harm, leading to a reduced QOL and increased 
economic burden. Managed care professionals are positioned to improve adherence 
and outcomes through various drug utilization strategies. Clinicians may also 
empower patients with schizophrenia through shared decision making and the 
creation of a therapeutic alliance. Careful monitoring of medication-related 
adverse effects and offering potential medication alternatives and routes of 
administration when indicated may also improve adherence to treatment regimens, 
resulting in improved outcomes and reduced healthcare costs.

Importance: The importance of this study is to understand the impact of 
rhinoplasty as perceived by society and to conceptualize the health utility 
metric of cosmetic rhinoplasty in relation to other health interventions. 
Objective: This novel study seeks to measure and quantify the health state 
utility and valuation of cosmetic rhinoplasty. Design, Setting, Participants: 
This is a cross-sectional survey administered through public online forums to 
161 casual observers in America. Main Outcomes and Measures: Participants were 
shown pre- and postoperative photographs of six patients who underwent cosmetic 
rhinoplasty and two patients who did not undergo surgery. Observers were asked 
to imagine that the external nose in each image was on their own face and rated 
(1) their health state utility and (2) how much they were willing to pay (WTP) 
to have the ideal nose. Results: Established metrics of standard gamble and 
visual analog scale were explored in detail. Using these valuation and health 
utility data, we calculated WTP per quality-adjusted-life-year (WTP/QALY). The 
WTP/QALY for cosmetic rhinoplasty is $12,264 per QALY, which is significantly 
below cost-effective thresholds. Participants were willing to accept 10% risk of 
death to undergo cosmetic rhinoplasty. Conclusions and Relevance: Calculating 
WTP/QALY as a metric, we assess and quantify the social importance of 
rhinoplasty. This is the first study to demonstrate that elective cosmetic 
rhinoplasty can be a high-value intervention as perceived by society. 
Furthermore, the high percentage of risk of death that participants are willing 
to accept for cosmetic rhinoplasty suggests there is a profound psychosocial 
impact of external nasal deformity. These findings have implications for 
patients, surgeons, and health policy makers.

The study aimed to calculate years of life lost (YLL) and years of potential 
life lost (YPLL) due to malignant mesothelioma (MM) in Turkey. YLL was computed 
by estimating the difference between age at death due to MM and the expected 
death age. To calculate YPLL, all deaths above 65 years (retirement age) were 
disregarded. Of the 5,617 deaths due to MM in the study period, 3,241 (57.70%) 
were male and 2,376 (42.30%) were female. The median YLL and YPLL were 16.58 and 
25.13 for males and 19.83 and 28.50 years for females. YLL and YPLL were shorter 
in males than females (p < 0.001). Premature mortality cost per death was $ 
45,963.57 (2.23 times higher for males). MM is associated with high YLL, YPLL 
and economic burden in a country with environmental asbestos exposure in the 
rural areas.

To inform proposed changes in hepatitis C virus (HCV) screening guidelines in 
the United States, we assessed the cost-effectiveness of HCV antenatal 
rescreening for women without evidence of HCV during a prior pregnancy, using a 
previously published model. Universal HCV rescreening among pregnant women was 
cost-effective (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, $6000 per quality-adjusted 
life-year) and should be recommended nationally.

In spite of advances in chelation therapy and screening of blood, mortality 
associated with the most common life-threatening noncommunicable disease of 
children in India, transfusion-dependent thalassemia (TDT), remains poorly 
defined. This study aims at estimating death rates and mortality risk factors 
associated with TDT. The clinical records of 1087 patients from 5 thalassemia 
centers in India were retrospectively analyzed from 2011 to 2018. Median patient 
age was 8.5 years, with 107 patients older than 18 years; 656 patients were male 
and 431 were female. Demographic details and clinical parameters were analyzed 
at presentation and at last visit. With 41 recorded deaths, actuarial survival 
at 26.9 years was 50%, and under-5 mortality was 7 times higher than in the 
general population. Patients with transfusion-transmitted infections (TTIs) had 
3.4 times higher risk for death (P = .031). Serum ferritin higher than 4000 
ng/dL had 4.6 times higher risk for mortality compared with ferritin lower than 
1000 ng/dL (P = .00063). A hemoglobin drop lower than 2 g/dL per week had 7.7 
times higher mortality risk compared with a drop of less than 1 g/dL per week (P 
< .0001). Social determinants (sex, economic status, and distance from center), 
splenectomy, and even cardiac complications were not associated with higher 
mortality risk. Main causes of death were infection, iron overload, TTIs, and 
allo-immunization. Patients who received more than 4 years of adequate care had 
more than 66% mortality risk reduction (P < .0001). TDT in India continues to 
result in high mortality. Ineffective transfusion, TTIs, and chelation continue 
to be the most significant risk factors. Comprehensive care in dedicated day 
care centers from early age is likely to improve outcomes.

OBJECTIVE: Maternal unbalanced nutritional habits during embryonic development 
and perinatal stages perturb hypothalamic neuronal programming of the offspring, 
thus increasing obesity-associated diabetes risk. However, the underlying 
molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown. In this study we sought to 
determine the translatomic signatures associated with pro-opiomelanocortin 
(POMC) neuron malprogramming in maternal obesogenic conditions.
METHODS: We used the RiboTag mouse model to specifically profile the translatome 
of POMC neurons during neonatal (P0) and perinatal (P21) life and its 
neuroanatomical, functional, and physiological consequences.
RESULTS: Maternal high-fat diet (HFD) exposure did not interfere with 
offspring's hypothalamic POMC neuron specification, but significantly impaired 
their spatial distribution and axonal extension to target areas. Importantly, we 
established POMC neuron-specific translatome signatures accounting for aberrant 
neuronal development and axonal growth. These anatomical and molecular 
alterations caused metabolic dysfunction in early life and adulthood.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides fundamental insights on the molecular mechanisms 
underlying POMC neuron malprogramming in obesogenic contexts.

Lymantria dispar asiatica is a globally distributed herbivorous pest. Avermectin 
is a highly effective, broad-spectrum insecticide. In this study, fourth instar 
L. dispar asiatica larvae were exposed to a LC30 dose of avermectin. The 
structure and function of larval gut microbial community was analyzed to examine 
how gut microbiota in L. dispar asiatica larvae responded to avermectin stress. 
Results showed that the structure and function of gut microbial community in L. 
dispar asiatica larvae were varied by avermectin stress. To be precise, more 
than half quantity of the observed Optical Taxonomic Units (OTUs) showed 
significantly different abundances under avermectin stress. Linear discriminant 
analysis effect size (LEfSe) suggested nine bacterial genera and 12 fungal 
genera contributed to the different gut microbial community structure in L. 
dispar asiatica larvae. Gut microbial function classification (PICRUSt and 
FUNGuild) suggested that three bacterial function categories and a fungal 
function guild were significantly increased, and two fungal function guilds were 
significantly decreased by avermectin stress. This study furthers our 
understanding of the physiology of L. dispar asiatica larvae under avermectin 
stress, and is an essential step towards future development of potential 
pesticide targets.

Human serum albumin (HSA) has been used to extend the serum half-lives of 
various protein therapeutics through genetic fusion because HSA exhibits an 
exceptionally long circulation time as a result of neonatal Fc receptor 
(FcRn)-mediated recycling. As another serum half-life extender, the human 
antibody Fab SL335 that strongly binds HSA was developed. When SL335 was fused 
to a protein therapeutic, SL335 was shown to prolong the half-life of the drug. 
Despite the significance of SL335-HSA binding in the extension of drug 
circulation time, it remains unclear how SL335 interacts with HSA at a molecular 
structural level. To reveal the structural basis of HSA recognition by SL335, we 
determined the crystal structure of the SL335-HSA complex at a resolution of 
2.95 Å. SL335 binds HSA at a 1:1 stoichiometry. SL335 uses the exposed loops of 
its heavy and light chains to specifically recognize the IIa and IIb subdomains 
of HSA. The SL335 epitope is located on the opposite side of the FcRn-binding 
site and does not overlap with it, suggesting that SL335 extends the serum 
half-lives of itself and its fusion partner through an FcRn-dependent recycling 
mechanism.

(1)Complejo Asistencial Universitario de León, Servicio de Farmacia, León, 
España.

INTRODUCTION: Although HAART cannot eradicate HIV, it suppresses viral 
replication, resulting in a progressive reduction in HIV-related morbidity and 
mortality. The increase in life expectancy for HIV-infected patients has turned 
this disease into a chronic disease and, therefore, to the appearance of 
comorbidities. At the same time there is an increase in the use of concomitant 
medication, making HIV-infected patient a polymedicated patient.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the degree of polypharmacy and to describe clinically 
relevant drug interactions, as well as the comorbidities and adherence to HAART 
in HIV + patients over 50 years.
METHODS: Observational, transversal study. Patients ≥50 years on HAART 
ambulatory were included. The variables were collected: aged, sex, VL, CD4, 
comorbidities, ARV, concomitant medication, herbal products and adherence. 
Patients who did not sign informed consent were excluded.
RESULTS: Were included 154 patients ≥50 years on HAART. The presence of 
polypharmacy, defined as the use of 5 or more medications including HAART, was 
40.3%. 73.4% of the patients had concomitant medication: lipid-lowering agents 
(33.8%), anxiolytics / sedatives (28.6%), proton-pump inhibitors (26.0%) 
antihypertensive agents (23.4%). 102 relevant interactions were recorded, 
finding statistically significant differences in relation to the presence of 
polypharmacy and pharmacologic drugs classes (p <0.001).
CONCLUSION: The prevalence of polypharmacy among HIV+ patients ≥50 years is 
high. Comorbidities, interactions and drugs associated were similar to those 
described in the literature. It is necessary to establish priorities in relation 
to drug interactions with polypharmacy and a correct approach to the pathologies 
that may develop.

Publisher: INTRODUCCIÓN: El HAART, si bien no puede erradicar la infección por 
el VIH, mantiene suprimida la replicación viral obteniendo una progresiva 
reducción de la morbimortalidad. El aumento de la esperanza de vida ha 
convertido a esta enfermedad en una patología crónica y por tanto, a la 
aparición de comorbilidades. Paralelamente, se produce un incremento en el uso 
de medicamentos que califican al paciente VIH como polimedicado.
OBJETIVOS: Determinar el grado de polifarmacia, describir las interacciones 
relevantes, así como conocer las comorbilidades y la adherencia al HAART en 
pacientes VIH+ ≥50 años.
MÉTODOS: Estudio descriptivo, transversal. Se incluyeron pacientes ≥50 años VIH 
+ con terapia HAART ambulatoria. Se recogieron las variables: edad, sexo, carga 
viral, CD4, comorbilidades, tratamiento antirretroviral, medicación 
concomitante, productos de herboristería y adherencia.
RESULTADOS: Se incluyeron 154 pacientes ≥50 años con HAART. La polifarmacia, 
definida como la presencia de 5 o más principios activos incluido el HAART, se 
presentaron en el 40.3% de los pacientes. El 73.4% tenía medicación 
concomitante: hipolipemiantes (33.8%), ansiolíticos/sedantes (28.6%), 
inhibidores de la bomba de protones (26.0%), antihipertensivos (23.4%). Se 
registraron 102 interacciones relevantes encontrándose diferencias 
estadísticamente significativas en relación a la presencia de polifarmacia y al 
grupo farmacológico antirretroviral (p <0.001).
CONCLUSIONES: Existe una alta prevalencia de polifarmacia en pacientes VIH+ ≥50 
años. Las comorbilidades, las interacciones identificadas y la medicación 
concomitante fueron similares a las descritas en la literatura. Es necesario 
establecer prioridades en relación a las interacciones farmacológicas con la 
polifarmacia y un correcto abordaje de las patologías que se puedan desarrollar.
