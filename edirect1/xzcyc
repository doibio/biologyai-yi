metastasis of MDA-MB-231 cells. Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) 
staining and filamentous-actin rings analysis were used to detect the regulatory 
effects of gold clusters on MDA-MB-231 cell-conditioned medium (MDA-MB-231 CM) 
triggered and receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL)-induced 
osteoclastogenesis in mouse bone marrow-derived mononuclear cells (BMMs). A 
mouse model of breast cancer bone metastasis was used to evaluate the in vivo 
activity of the gold cluster on the tumor induced osteolysis. Results: The gold 
clusters suppressed the migration, invasion and colony formation of MDA-MB-231 
cells in a dose-dependent manner in vitro. The gold clusters strongly inhibited 
both MDA-MB-231 CM triggered and RANKL-induced osteoclast formation from BMMs in 
vitro. Cell studies indicated that the gold clusters suppressed the expression 
of osteolysis-related factors in MDA-MB-231 cells and inhibited the subsequent 
activation of NF-κB pathway in BMMs. Treatment with the clusters at a dose of 10 
mg Au/kg.bw significantly reduces the breast cancer cell induced osteolysis in 
vivo. Conclusion: Therefore, the gold clusters may offer new therapeutic agents 
for preventing breast cancer bone metastasis and secondary osteolysis to improve 
patient outcomes.

INTRODUCTION: Deep neck space infections most commonly arise from a septic focus 
of the mandibular teeth, tonsils, parotid gland, middle ear or sinuses, usually 
with a rapid onset and frequently with progression to life-threatening 
complications. Lemierre's syndrome is classically defined by an oropharyngeal 
infection with internal jugular vein thrombosis followed by metastatic 
infections in other organs.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 32-year-old female patient, with no significant past 
medical history, was diagnosed with a dental abscess on her left inferior 3rd 
molar. Six days later, the condition complicated with severe upper respiratory 
distress, odynophagia and trismus, and extension of the inflammatory signs to 
the anterior cervical region, involving the upper airway. Computed tomography 
scan confirmed extension to submandibular, parapharyngeal and retrosternal 
spaces), which required nasotracheal intubation due to compromised airway. 
Urgent and subsequent surgical drainages were performed, alongside with 
concomitant antibiotic therapy. Additionally, left internal jugular vein 
thrombosis was described - with later extension to the brachiocephalic vein, 
without other complications, consistent with Lemierre's syndrome, although 
without full features. Streptococcus anginosus was identified in the drained pus 
specimens. The patient made a satisfactory clinical progress and was discharged 
after 25 days, still under therapeutic hypocoagulation.
CONCLUSION: As deep neck space infections can be life-threatening, clinicians 
must be aware and not underestimate their potential severity. Lemierre's 
syndrome is a complication difficult to recognize, which requires additional 
awareness of the many possible presentations, for appropriate diagnostic studies 
and therapeutic plan.

INTRODUCTION: The efficacy and safety of recombinant factor VIII Fc fusion 
protein (rFVIIIFc) as an extended half-life treatment for severe haemophilia A 
were demonstrated in the Phase 3 A-LONG and Kids A-LONG studies. Eligible 
subjects who completed A-LONG and Kids A-LONG could enrol in ASPIRE 
(NCT01454739), an open-label extension study.
AIM: To report the long-term safety and efficacy of rFVIIIFc in subjects with 
severe haemophilia A who enrolled in ASPIRE.
METHODS: Previously treated subjects received one or more of the following 
regimens: individualized prophylaxis (IP), weekly prophylaxis, modified 
prophylaxis or episodic treatment. Subjects could switch treatment regimen at 
any time. The primary endpoint was inhibitor development.
RESULTS: A total of 150 subjects from A-LONG and 61 subjects from Kids A-LONG 
enrolled in ASPIRE. Most subjects received the IP regimen (A-LONG: n = 110; Kids 
A-LONG: n = 59). Median (range) treatment duration in ASPIRE for subjects from 
A-LONG and Kids A-LONG was 3.9 (0.1-5.3) years and 3.2 (0.3-3.9) years, 
respectively. No inhibitors were observed (0 per 1000 subject-years; 95% 
confidence interval, 0-5.2) and the overall rFVIIIFc safety profile was 
consistent with prior studies. For subjects on the IP regimen, annualized bleed 
rates (ABR) remained low (median overall ABR for adults and adolescents was 
<1.0) and extended-dosing intervals were maintained (median of 3.5 days) for the 
majority of subjects in ASPIRE.
CONCLUSION: ASPIRE results, which include up to 5 years of follow-up data, 
confirm earlier reports on the consistent and well-characterized safety and 
efficacy of rFVIIIFc treatment for severe haemophilia A.

OBJECTIVE: To compare costs and quality-adjusted life years of patients 
receiving endoscopic polypectomy in the clinic those receiving endoscopic sinus 
surgery from the perspective of Canada's health system.
METHOD: We developed a Markov model to simulate costs and quality-adjusted life 
years among a cohort of patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with polyps who 
received endoscopic polypectomy in clinic or endoscopic sinus surgery, over a 
patient's lifetime. Our study focused on patients with chronic rhinosinusitis 
with polyps who have the predominant symptom of bilateral nasal obstruction. 
Cost data were obtained from Canadian sources. Health utility values were 
derived from Sino-nasal Outcome Test (SNOT-22) scores reported in the published 
literature. A cycle length of six months was used. Both costs and 
quality-adjusted life years were discounted using an annual rate of 1.5%. We 
conducted one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses to assess the 
robustness of the study findings.
RESULTS: Endoscopic polypectomy in clinic was a cost-saving option as it had a 
lower cost (C$736 vs. C$6,728) and produced more quality-adjusted life years 
(13.85 vs 13.06) compared to endoscopic sinus surgery. Our findings were, 
however, highly sensitive to health utility values. Results from probabilistic 
sensitivity analysis showed that endoscopic polypectomy in clinic had a lower 
cost and was more effective compared to endoscopic sinus surgery in 99.86% of 
iterations.
CONCLUSION: From the perspective of the publicly funded healthcare system, 
endoscopic polypectomy in clinic was economically attractive compared to 
endoscopic sinus surgery for chronic rhinosinusitis with polyps patients who 
have a primary symptom of bilateral nasal obstruction. The cost-effectiveness 
results are, however, highly dependent on the relative impact of endoscopic 
polypectomy in the clinic and endoscopic sinus surgery on post-surgery health 
utility values.

The economic and public health impact of influenza vaccinations: contributions 
of Swiss pharmacies in the 2016/17 and 2017/18 influenza seasons and 
implications for vaccination policy.

Brunner I, Schmedders K, Wolfensberger A, Schreiber PW, Kuster SP.

AIMS OF THE STUDY: Healthy adults have had the option to receive 
prescriptionless vaccination against influenza in pharmacies of several Swiss 
cantons since the 2015/16 influenza season. We aimed to assess in a cost-benefit 
analysis the resulting net benefits for the Swiss economy and public health, and 
the benefits that could be expected if an extension of the current vaccination 
recommendations was implemented.
METHODS: The proportion of influenza vaccines administered in pharmacies was 
calculated from data provided by pharmacies entering information in phS-net.ch, 
data from vaccines covered by insurance companies, and vaccine supply data. The 
economic and public health impact was estimated in a cost-benefit analysis based 
on published data.
RESULTS: In the 2016/17 and 2017/18 influenza seasons, 7306 of a total of 1.07 
million (0.7%) and 15,617 of a total of 1.15 million (1.4%) influenza vaccine 
doses, respectively, were administered in pharmacies in Switzerland. The net 
cost savings for the economy due to vaccination in pharmacies in the 2016/17 and 
2017/18 seasons were CHF 66,633 and CHF 143,021, respectively. In the 2017/18 
season, this resulted –in a net saving per 100,000 inhabitants of CHF 1918, 94.4 
cases of illness, 17.6 visits to primary care physicians, 0.328 
hospitalisations, 1.1 hospitalisation days, 0.019 deaths prevented, and 0.353 
life-years gained. Influenza vaccination proved to be cost-effective provided 
that a vaccine efficacy of 59% is exceeded. Extrapolations for the healthy, 
working-age population revealed that a vaccination coverage rate of 50% and a 
vaccine efficacy of 70% could save the Swiss economy CHF 18.4 million annually.
CONCLUSIONS: The service allowing citizens to receive influenza vaccination in 
Swiss pharmacies is sparsely used. Since influenza vaccination is 
cost-beneficial as soon as vaccine efficacy surpasses a critical threshold, an 
extension of the vaccine recommendation for healthy, working-age adults should 
be considered from an economic point of view.

AIMS: The aim is to assess the cost-effectiveness of patellofemoral arthroplasty 
(PFA) in comparison with total knee arthroplasty (TKA) for the treatment of 
isolated patellofemoral osteoarthritis (OA) based on prospectively collected 
data on health outcomes and resource use from a blinded, randomized, clinical 
trial.
METHODS: A total of 100 patients with isolated patellofemoral osteoarthritis 
were randomized to receive either PFA or TKA by experienced knee surgeons 
trained in using both implants. Patients completed patient-reported outcomes 
including EuroQol five-dimension questionnaire (EQ-5D) and 6-Item Short-Form 
Health Survey questionnaire (SF-6D) before the procedure. The scores were 
completed again after six weeks, three, six, and nine months, and again after 
one- and two-year post-surgery and yearly henceforth. Time-weighted outcome 
measures were constructed. Cost data were obtained from clinical registrations 
and patient-reported questionnaires. Incremental gain in health outcomes 
(quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs)) and incremental costs were compared for 
the two groups of patients. Net monetary benefit was calculated assuming a 
threshold value of €10,000, €35,000, and €50,000 per QALY and used to test the 
statistical uncertainty and central assumptions about outcomes and costs.
RESULTS: The PFA group had an incremental 12 month EQ-5D gain of 0.056 (95% 
confidence interval (CI) 0.01 to 0.10) and an incremental 12 month cost of minus 
€328 (95% CI 836 to 180). PFA therefore dominates TKA by providing better and 
cheaper outcomes than TKA. The net monetary benefit of PFA was €887 (95% CI 324 
to 1450) with the €10,000 threshold, and it was consistently positive when 
different measures of outcomes and different cost assumptions were used.
CONCLUSION: This study provides robust evidence that PFA from a one-year 
hospital management perspective is cheaper and provides better outcomes than TKA 
when applied to patients with isolated patellofemoral osteoarthritis and 
performed by experienced knee surgeons. Cite this article: Bone Joint J

BACKGROUND: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the main cause of mortality and 
severe morbidity in cyclists admitted to Dutch emergency departments (EDs). 
Although the use of bicycle helmets is an effective way of preventing TBI, this 
is uncommon in the Netherlands. An option to increase its use is through a legal 
enforcement. However, little is known about the cost-effectiveness of such 
mandatory use of helmets in the Dutch context. The current study aimed to assess 
the cost-effectiveness of a law that enforces helmet use to reduce TBI and 
TBI-related mortality.
METHODS: The cost-effectiveness was estimated through decision tree modelling. 
In this study, wearing bicycle helmets enforced by law was compared with the 
current situation of infrequent voluntary helmet use. The total Dutch cycling 
population, consisting of 13.5 million people, was included in the model. Model 
data and parameters were obtained from Statistics Netherlands, the National Road 
Traffic Database, Dutch Injury Surveillance System, and literature. Effects 
included were numbers of TBI, death, and disability-adjusted life years (DALY). 
Costs included were healthcare costs, costs of productivity losses, and helmet 
costs. Sensitivity analysis was performed to assess which parameter had the 
largest influence on the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER).
RESULTS: The intervention would lead to an estimated reduction of 2942 cases of 
TBI and 46 deaths. Overall, the incremental costs per 1) death averted, 2) per 
TBI averted, and 3) per DALY averted were estimated at 1) € 2,002,766, 2) € 
31,028 and 3) € 28,465, respectively. Most favorable were the incremental costs 
per DALY in the 65+ age group: € 17,775.
CONCLUSIONS: The overall costs per DALY averted surpassed the Dutch willingness 
to pay threshold value of € 20,000 for cost-effectiveness of preventive 
interventions. However, the cost per DALY averted for the elderly was below this 
threshold, indicating that in this age group largest effects can be reached. If 
the price of a helmet would reduce by 20%, which is non-hypothetical in a 
situation of large-scale purchases and use of these helmets, the introduction of 
this regulation would result in an intervention that is almost cost-effective in 
all age groups.

BACKGROUND: Clinical outcomes of patients with osteosarcoma remain 
unsatisfactory, with little improvement in a 5-year overall survival over the 
past three decades. There is a substantial need for further research and 
development to identify and develop more efficacious agents/regimens in order to 
improve clinical outcomes of patients for whom the prognosis is unfavorable. 
Recently, mycophenolate mofetil, a prodrug of mycophenolic acid, has been found 
to have anticancer activity against osteosarcoma in both in vitro and animal 
experiments, so that further investigation in humans is warranted.
METHODS: A total of 27 patients with high-grade locally advanced or metastatic 
osteosarcoma will be enrolled into this phase II, multi-center, open-label, 
single-arm, two-stage clinical trial. The main objectives of this study are to 
determine the efficacy and safety of mycophenolate mofetil in the patients. The 
primary endpoint is progression-free survival at 16 weeks; the secondary 
endpoints include progression-free survival, overall survival, overall response 
rate, safety parameters, pharmacokinetic parameters, biomarkers, pain score, and 
quality of life. Mycophenolate mofetil at the initial dose of 5 g/day or lower 
will be administered for 4 cycles (28 days/cycle) or until disease progression 
or unacceptable toxicity. The dose of mycophenolate mofetil may be reduced by 
1-2 g/day or withheld for some Grade 3 or Grade 4 toxicities whenever clinically 
needed. The duration of study participation is approximately 4-5 months, with a 
minimum of 12 study visits. If mycophenolate mofetil proves beneficial to some 
patients, as evidenced by stable disease or partial response at 16 weeks, 
administration of mycophenolate mofetil will continue in the extension period.
DISCUSSION: This trial is the first step in the translation of therapeutic 
potential of mycophenolate mofetil emerging from in vitro and animal studies 
into the clinical domain. It is designed to assess the efficacy and safety of 
mycophenolate mofetil in patients with high-grade locally advanced or metastatic 
osteosarcoma. The results will provide important information about whether or 
not mycophenolate mofetil is worth further development.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial was prospectively registered on Thai Clinical 
Trials Registry (registration number: TCTR20190701001). The posted information 
will be updated as needed to reflect protocol amendments and study progress.

BACKGROUND: Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of 
blindness. This study aims to analyze regional differences on the global burden 
of AMD and help direct related policy making.
METHODS: Disability-adjusted life years (DALY) data were collected from the 
Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD) 2017 to estimate the AMD burden. Mean 
education years, human development index (HDI) and Public Health Expenditure 
were extracted from the Human Development Report 2018, and latitude data were 
obtained from the Google Earth. These four factors were analyzed to see their 
importance in regional differences of AMD burden, using Kruskal-Wallis test, 
Dunn's multiple comparisons test as well as regression analysis.
RESULTS: Global age-standardized DALY rates have decreased since 2011. Based on 
the WHO region system, age-standardized DALY rates in African and Eastern 
Mediterranean region were significantly lower than those of other four regions. 
Linear regression analysis indicated that age-standardized DALY rates were 
inversely related to HDI and mean education years.
CONCLUSIONS: The age-standardized AMD burden had a decreasing tendency recently. 
Lower socioeconomic status and fewer education years were associated with higher 
AMD burden. The finding of this study may highlight the importance of national 
development and education on relieving AMD burden.

BACKGROUND: Goals play an important role in the choices that individuals make. 
Yet, there is no clear approach of how to incorporate goals in discrete choice 
experiments. In this paper, we present such an approach and illustrate it in the 
context of lifestyle programs. Furthermore, we investigate how non-health vs. 
health goals affect individuals' choices via non-goal attributes.
METHODS: We used an unlabeled discrete choice experiment about lifestyle 
programs based on two experimental conditions in which either a non-health goal 
(i.e., looking better) or a health goal (i.e., increasing life expectancy) was 
presented to respondents as a fixed attribute level for the goal attribute. 
Respondents were randomly distributed over the experimental conditions. 
Eventually, we used data from 407 Dutch adults who reported to be overweight 
(n = 212 for the non-health goal, and n = 195 for the health goal).
RESULTS: Random parameter logit model estimates show that the type of goal 
significantly (p < 0.05) moderates the effect that the attribute diet has on 
lifestyle program choice, but that this is not the case for the attributes 
exercise per week and expected weight loss.
CONCLUSIONS: A flexible diet is more important for individuals with a non-health 
goal than for individuals with a health goal. Therefore, we advise policy makers 
to use information on goal interactions for developing new policies and 
communication strategies to target population segments that have different 
goals. Furthermore, we recommend researchers to consider the impact of goals 
when designing discrete choice experiments.

The application of hollow nerve conduits in the repair of peripheral nerve 
defects is effected by inferior recovery, and nerve extension is hampered by the 
scar tissue generated during the repair process. In this study, the filler in 
hollow nerve conduit, chitosan/oxidized hydroxyethyl cellulose (CS/OHEC) 
hydrogel loaded asiaticoside liposome and the conductive reduced graphene oxide 
(rGO) were developed and used to reform the microenvironment for peripheral 
nerve regeneration. The physiochemical properties of CS/OHEC/rGO/asiaticoside 
liposome hydrogel were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy 
(FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and compressive modulus, porosity, 
swelling ratio, degradation and conductivity. In addition, the asiaticoside 
release profiles in vitro were investigated. The hydrogel had a continuous 
porous network structure with pore size distribution in the range of 50-250 μm. 
The majority of the hydrogels had porosities above 70%, and a compressive 
modulus of 0.45 MPa. The weight loss rate of hydrogel reached 76.14 ± 4.45% 
within 8 weeks. The conductivity of the hydrogel was 5.27 ± 0.42 × 10-4 S/cm. 
The hydrogel was non-toxic and suitable for adhesion and proliferation of nerve 
cells in vitro. In addition, the application of electrical stimulation after the 
addition of rGO can promote the differentiation and proliferation of nerve 
cells, accelerating nerve regeneration. The asiaticoside released from the 
hydrogel had a significant inhibitory effect on the growth and collagen 
secretion of fibroblasts, eliminating scars for regenerative nerves, which can 
promote the function recovery of defected peripheral nerve. Together, these 
positive results indicate that the hydrogel would be a promising candidate for 
peripheral nerve regeneration.

Earlier work suggested that subjective life expectancy (SLE) functions as 
reference point in time trade-off (TTO), but has not tested or modelled this 
explicitly. In this paper we construct a model based on prospect theory to 
investigate these predictions more thoroughly. We report the first experimental 
test of reference-dependence with respect to SLE for TTO and extend this 
approach to standard gamble (SG). In two experiments, subjects' SLEs were used 
to construct different versions of 10-year TTO and SG tasks, with the gauge 
duration either described as occurring above or below life expectation. Our 
analyses suggest that both TTO and SG weights were affected by SLE as predicted 
by prospect theory with SLE as reference point. Subjects gave up fewer years in 
TTO and were less risk-tolerant in SG below SLE, implying that weights derived 
from these health state valuation methods for durations below SLE will be biased 
upwards.

INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Self-expanding metallic stents (SEMS) are the ideal 
treatment for malignant gastric outlet obstruction (MGOO) in patients with a 
short life expectancy, but stent dysfunction is frequent. The primary aim of our 
study was to identify the predictive factors of SEMS dysfunction in MGOO and the 
secondary aim was to determine the technical success, clinical success, and 
nutritional impact after SEMS placement.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective, longitudinal study was conducted at the 
gastrointestinal endoscopy department of the Instituto Nacional de Cancerología 
in Mexico City. Patients diagnosed with MGOO that underwent SEMS placement 
within the time frame of January 2015 to May 2018 were included. We utilized the 
gastric outlet obstruction scoring system (GOOSS) to determine clinical success 
and SEMS dysfunction.
RESULTS: The study included 43 patients, technical success was 97.7% (n=42), and 
clinical success was 88.3% (n=38). SEMS dysfunction presented in 30.2% (n=13) of 
the patients, occurring in<6 months after placement in 53.8% (n=7) of them. In 
the univariate analysis, the histologic subtype, diffuse gastric adenocarcinoma 
(p=0.02) and the use of uncovered SEMS (p=0.02) were the variables associated 
with dysfunction. Albumin levels and body mass index did not increase after SEMS 
placement. Medical follow-up was a mean 5.8 months (1-24 months).
CONCLUSIONS: SEMS demonstrated adequate technical and clinical efficacy in the 
treatment of MGOO. SEMS dysfunction was frequent and diffuse type gastric cancer 
and uncovered SEMS appeared to be dysfunction predictors.

The incidence of oropharyngeal cancer induced by human papillomavirus (HPV) 
infection is steadily increasing in developed countries. These tumors are more 
chemoradiosensitive and have a better prognosis than HPV-negative one. In 
addition, they occur in younger and better-off patients with longer life 
expectancy. Current radiotherapy and chemotherapy protocols are currently being 
questioned as they may expose HPV-positive patients to excessive treatment and 
unnecessary toxic effects. Less intensive treatment regimens could possibly 
achieve similar efficacy with lower toxicity and improved quality of life. The 
aim of this work was to summarize the knowledge on these tumors and their 
implications for radiation oncologists. In this update, we will discuss ongoing 
de-escalation trials and highlight the issues raised by these studies. We will 
also comment on the results of recently published de-intensification studies. 
Three main strategies are analyzed in the present article: the de-escalation of 
the drug associated with radiotherapy, the de-escalation of the radiotherapy 
dose (in concomitant chemoradiotherapy, after induction chemotherapy, in a 
postoperative setting) and de-escalation of radiation target volumes. Our 
findings ultimately indicate that clinicians should not change the management of 
oropharyngeal cancer patients outside of clinical trials.

Homo sapiens and naked mole rats (Heterocephalus glaber) are vivid examples of 
social mammals that differ from their relatives in particular by an increased 
lifespan and a large number of neotenic features. An important fact for 
biogerontology is that the mortality rate of H. glaber (a maximal lifespan of 
more than 32 years, which is very large for such a small rodent) negligibly 
grows with age. The same is true for modern people in developed countries below 
the age of 60. It is important that the juvenilization of traits that separate 
humans from chimpanzees evolved over thousands of generations and millions of 
years. Rapid advances in technology resulted in a sharp increase in the life 
expectancy of human beings during the past 100 years. Currently, the human life 
expectancy has exceeded 80 years in developed countries. It cannot be excluded 
that the potential for increasing life expectancy by an improvement in living 
conditions will be exhausted after a certain period of time. New types of 
geroprotectors should be developed that protect not only from chronic 
phenoptosis gradual poisoning of the body with reactive oxygen species (ROS) but 
also from acute phenoptosis, where strong increase in the level of ROS 
immediately kills an already aged individual. Geroprotectors might be another 
anti-aging strategy along with neoteny (a natural physiological phenomenon) and 
technical progress.

PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the correlation between 
muscle strength and knee symptoms (pain, stiffness, and functional limitation) 
regardless of the presence of radiologic knee osteoarthritis (RKOA) in 
community-dwelling elderly.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: This cross-sectional study used data from the Namgaram-2 
cohort. The Namgaram-2 cohort consisted of participants living in three rural 
communities. Such participants were included for studies on activity limitation 
due to age-related musculoskeletal disorders including knee osteoarthritis, 
osteoporosis, and sarcopenia. The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities 
Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), a health assessment tool for patients with 
arthritis in lower extremities, was used to assess health-related quality of 
life (HRQOL). Muscle strengths were measured by knee strength (by using the 
isokinetic dynamometer) and hand grip strength.
RESULTS: The WOMAC pain of Kallgren-Lawrence (K/L) grade < 2 was correlated with 
age, grip strength, nutrition status, and knee extension 180 peak torque. The 
WOMAC pain of K/L grade ≥ 2 was correlated with age, nutrition status, and knee 
extension 60 peak torque. The WOMAC stiffness of K/L grade < 2 was correlated 
with having a spouse, nutrition status, and knee extension 60 peak torque. The 
WOMAC stiffness of K/L grade ≥ 2 was correlated with knee extension 60 peak 
torque. The WOMAC function of K/L grade < 2 was correlated with age, grip 
strength, osteoporosis, nutrition status, and knee extension 180 peak torque. 
The WOMAC function of K/L grade ≥ 2 was correlated with age, nutrition status, 
and knee extension 60 peak torque.
CONCLUSION: Muscle strength as measured by grip strength and knee extension was 
statistically significantly correlated with the WOMAC scores in patients with 
knee symptoms regardless of whether radiologic signs of knee osteoarthritis were 
observed.

The tobacco epidemic is one of the most prominent public health threats the 
world has ever faced. Public health policy that seeks to limit the problem may 
have to target not only the price of tobacco but also the initiation stage in a 
smoker's life-the adolescent stage. Most research on teen smoking focuses on 
initiation and other stories. Moreover, what determines the desire to quit 
smoking among teens is not well understood, even though planning to quit smoking 
is an important stage toward successful cessation. This research contributes to 
healthcare literature by using Bayesian hierarchical techniques, estimated using 
Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) and its extension, the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS), 
to empirically identify what drives the intention to quit smoking among teen 
smokers in Zambia. Results suggest that, among the junior secondary school-going 
adolescent smokers in Zambia, about 63% have plans to quit smoking. We find 
socio-demographic characteristics and several tobacco-smoking-related factors as 
salient drivers of adolescent smokers' plans to quit smoking. For policymaking, 
we recommend that school-going teen smokers should have access to smoking 
cessation aids to help them quit smoking. Most importantly, increased awareness 
of dangers of smoking, advice by health professionals, stringent public policies 
on smoking, as well as parental guidance could be useful to help adolescent 
smokers realize their quitting plans.

BACKGROUND: The loss of motor functions resulting from spinal cord injury can 
have devastating implications on the quality of one's life. Functional 
electrical stimulation has been used to help restore mobility, however, current 
functional electrical stimulation (FES) systems require residual movements to 
control stimulation patterns, which may be unintuitive and not useful for 
individuals with higher level cervical injuries. Brain machine interfaces (BMI) 
offer a promising approach for controlling such systems; however, they currently 
still require transcutaneous leads connecting indwelling electrodes to external 
recording devices. While several wireless BMI systems have been designed, high 
signal bandwidth requirements limit clinical translation. Case Western Reserve 
University has developed an implantable, modular FES system, the Networked 
Neuroprosthesis (NNP), to perform combinations of myoelectric recording and 
neural stimulation for controlling motor functions. However, currently the 
existing module capabilities are not sufficient for intracortical recordings.
METHODS: Here we designed and tested a 1 × 4 cm, 96-channel neural recording 
module prototype to fit within the specifications to mate with the NNP. The 
neural recording module extracts power between 0.3-1 kHz, instead of 
transmitting the raw, high bandwidth neural data to decrease power requirements.
RESULTS: The module consumed 33.6 mW while sampling 96 channels at approximately 
2 kSps. We also investigated the relationship between average spiking band power 
and neural spike rate, which produced a maximum correlation of R = 0.8656 
(Monkey N) and R = 0.8023 (Monkey W).
CONCLUSION: Our experimental results show that we can record and transmit 96 
channels at 2ksps within the power restrictions of the NNP system and 
successfully communicate over the NNP network. We believe this device can be 
used as an extension to the NNP to produce a clinically viable, fully 
implantable, intracortically-controlled FES system and advance the field of 
bioelectronic medicine.

BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Guidelines recommend against routine screening for 
breast, colorectal, and prostate cancers in older adults with less than 10 years 
of life expectancy. However, clinicians often continue to recommend cancer 
screening for these patients. We examined primary care clinicians' perspectives 
regarding overscreening, as defined by limited life expectancy.
DESIGN: Semistructured, in-depth individual interviews.
SETTING: Twenty-one academic and nonacademic primary care clinics in Maryland.
PARTICIPANTS: Thirty primary care clinicians from internal medicine, family 
medicine, medicine/pediatrics, and geriatric medicine.
MEASUREMENTS: Interviews explored whether the clinicians believed that 
overscreening for breast, colorectal, or prostate cancers existed in older 
adults and their views on using life expectancy to decide on stopping routine 
screening. Audio recordings of the interviews were transcribed verbatim. Two 
investigators independently coded all transcripts using qualitative content 
analysis.
RESULTS: Most clinicians were physicians (24/30) and women (16/30). Content 
analysis generated three major themes. (1) Many, but not all, clinicians 
perceived overscreening in older adults as a problem. (2) There was controversy 
around using limited life expectancy to define overscreening due to concerns 
that the guidelines did not capture potential nonmortality benefits of 
screening; that population-based screening data could not be easily applied to 
individuals; that this approach failed to account for patient choice; and that 
life expectancy predictions were inaccurate. (3) Some clinicians worried that 
using life expectancy to define overscreening may inadvertently introduce bias 
and lead to unintended harms.
CONCLUSIONS: Several clinicians disagreed with guideline frameworks of using 
limited life expectancy to guide cancer screening cessation. Some disagreement
