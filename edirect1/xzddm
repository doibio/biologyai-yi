calculating the difference between inflation-only changes in benefits and the 
reforms.
RESULTS: We estimated that changes to household income resulting from the 
reforms would result in an additional 1041 (+3.7%) female deaths and 1013 
(+3.8%) male deaths. These deaths represent an estimated reduction of female LE 
from 81.6 years to 81.2 years (-20 weeks), and male LE from 77.6 years to 
77.2 years (-23 weeks). Cuts to benefits and tax credits were modelled to have 
the most detrimental impact on LE, and these were estimated to be most severe in 
the most deprived areas. The modelled impact on inequalities in LE was widening 
of the gap between the most and least deprived 20% of areas by a further 
21 weeks for females and 23 weeks for males.
INTERPRETATION: This study provides further evidence that austerity, in the form 
of cuts to social security benefits, is likely to be an important cause of 
stalled LE across the UK.

OBJECTIVE: Multiple arterial grafting (MAG) in coronary artery bypass grafting 
(CABG) is associated with higher survival and freedom from major adverse cardiac 
and cerebrovascular events (MACCEs) in observational studies of mostly men. It 
is not known whether MAG is beneficial in women. Our objectives were to compare 
the long-term clinical outcomes of MAG versus single arterial grafting (SAG) in 
women undergoing CABG for multivessel disease.
METHODS: Clinical and administrative databases for Ontario, Canada, were linked 
to obtain all women with angiographic evidence of left main, triple or double 
vessel disease undergoing isolated non-emergent primary CABG from 2008 to 2019. 
1:1 propensity score matching was performed. Late mortality and MACCE (composite 
of stroke, myocardial infarction, repeat revascularisation and death) were 
compared between the matched groups with a stratified log-rank test and Cox 
proportional-hazards model.
RESULTS: 2961 and 7954 women underwent CABG with MAG and SAG, respectively, for 
multivessel disease. Prior to propensity-score matching, compared with SAG, 
those who underwent MAG were younger (66.0 vs 68.9 years) and had less 
comorbidities. After propensity-score matching, in 2446 well-matched pairs, 
there was no significant difference in 30-day mortality (1.6% vs 1.8%, p=0.43) 
between MAG and SAG. Over a median and maximum follow-up of 5.0 and 11.0 years, 
respectively, MAG was associated with greater survival (HR 0.85, 95% CI 0.75 to 
0.98) and freedom from MACCE (HR 0.85, 95% CI 0.76 to 0.95).
CONCLUSIONS: MAG was associated with greater survival and freedom from MACCE and 
should be considered for women with good life expectancy requiring CABG.

The maternal immune system is going through considerable changes during 
pregnancy. However, little is known about the determinants of the inflammatory 
proteome and its relation to pregnancy stages. Our aim was to investigate the 
plasma inflammatory proteome before, during and after pregnancy. In addition we 
wanted to test whether maternal and child outcomes were associated with the 
proteome. A cohort of 94 healthy women, enrolled in a longitudinal study with 
assessments at up to five time points around pregnancy, ninety-two inflammatory 
proteins were analysed in plasma with a multiplex Proximity Extension Assay. 
First, principal components analysis were applied and thereafter regression 
modelling while correcting for multiple testing. We found profound shifts in the 
overall inflammatory proteome associated with pregnancy stage after multiple 
testing (p < .001). Moreover, maternal body mass index (BMI) was associated with 
inflammatory proteome primarily driven by VEGFA, CCL3 and CSF-1 (p < .05). The 
levels of most inflammatory proteins changed substantially during pregnancy and 
some of these were related to biological processes such as regulation of immune 
response. Maternal BMI was significantly associated with higher levels of three 
inflammation proteins calling for more research in the interplay between 
pregnancy, inflammation and BMI.

Mexico is an upper-middle income country located in North America, with an 
increasing life expectancy and a growing population of older adults. Due to 
population ageing and lifestyle changes, the number of cancer cases amongst 
older individuals is expected to increase in the upcoming decades, representing 
a challenge to the healthcare system. The challenges for implementing geriatric 
oncology care in Mexico include a fragmented healthcare system, as well as the 
lack of geriatric training amongst healthcare professionals. In this 
mini-review, we present an overview of the epidemiology of cancer amongst older 
adults in Mexico, the Mexican healthcare system and ongoing initiatives for the 
development of geriatric oncology programmes in the country. In addition, we 
highlight the priorities for future developments in the field of cancer and 
ageing in Mexico, with a focus on the various stakeholders involved.

In France, cancer is the leading cause of death. Its incidence is increasing due 
to the growing population and longer life expectancy. Although older adults 
represent most new cases, they remain underrepresented in clinical trials. Their 
prognosis is often worse due to delayed diagnosis and multimorbidities. 
Geriatric oncology has made great strides worldwide, highlighted by important 
studies implementing geriatric assessment in clinical research and supported by 
the successive national cancer plans. This paper reviews the most important 
actions taken in France during the last decade to improve the management of 
older patients with cancer.

Older patients tend to have multimorbidity represented by multiple chronic 
diseases or geriatric conditions due to aging changes of organs, which require a 
variety of medical management. Currently, there are no sufficient disease 
treatment guidelines for older people with multimorbidity, therefore physicians 
have difficulty managing multimorbidity, such as which diseases should be 
treated intensively or to what extent the conditions should be improved. 
Furthermore, there are other points to be considered when initiating the 
treatment of diseases. For example, physicians must assess physical function. 
Some people have no difficulty with ambulation, but some are bedridden and have 
difficulty getting up on their own. As there are differences in disease 
severity, comorbid conditions and life expectancy, there should be differences 
in deciding treatment and prescribing drugs. It may be necessary to change the 
option for treatment depending on cognitive function, the living environment and 
the care environment, using comprehensive geriatric assessments. In addition, 
when treating multimorbidity, patients tend to have polypharmacy, which is a 
risk for adverse drug events. Because of this, it is necessary to consider dose 
reduction and drug discontinuation in patients with polypharmacy. Because of the 
global increase in older patients with multimorbidity, developing an essential 
method for managing multimorbidity is an urgent issue. More research and 
practices are necessary to achieve high-quality care in patients with 
multimorbidity. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2020; 20: 1105-1111.

AIMS: Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a chronic skin condition causing 
inflammatory lesions, pain, scarring, and impaired mobility. Treatment options 
are limited and often lack success implying the need for additional/improved 
treatments. This research aimed to estimate the potential economic value of a 
treatment candidate, explore drivers of cost-effectiveness, and highlight 
economic evidence requirements for successful future value assessments.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: An early cost-effectiveness model was developed to assess 
the cost-effectiveness (cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained) of a 
treatment candidate compared against the only authorized biologic, adalimumab, 
for moderate to severe HS, from a UK National Health Service and Personal Social 
Service perspective. A targeted literature review of clinical and economic 
references and previous health technology assessments (HTA) was performed for 
development and validation of the early economic model used to present 
sensitivity analyses accompanying the base case cost-effectiveness results.
RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Base case results revealed the candidate not to be 
cost-effective compared to adalimumab when considering a formal 
cost-effectiveness threshold of £30,000 per QALY gained. Scenario- and threshold 
analyses highlighted that reducing dosing or drug price by half improved the 
cost-effectiveness of the candidate. Cost-effectiveness was highly sensitive to 
health states' utility values, treatment discontinuation, and resource 
utilization, in line with existing HTA evidence. The paucity of economic studies 
and uncertainties around the candidate presented methodological constraints that 
were addressed through sensitivity analyses.
CONCLUSIONS: Key costs and health effects drivers were highlighted to 
contextualize under which circumstances a treatment candidate for moderate to 
severe HS would reach acceptable cost-effectiveness levels. This early economic 
evaluation suggested promising economic perspectives for treatment candidates in 
HS. Exploring novel ways to use clinical endpoints to simulate the patient 
pathway and clinically meaningful treatment achievements in future research will 
facilitate the value demonstration of candidates in disease areas with high 
unmet care need.

A cost-utility analysis of SIR-Spheres Y-90 resin microspheres versus best 
supportive care in the treatment of unresectable metastatic colorectal cancer 
refractory to chemotherapy in the UK.

BACKGROUND: Limited treatment options are available in chemotherapy-refractory 
or -intolerant metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). The objective of the present 
analysis was to evaluate the cost-utility of SIR-Spheres Y-90 resin microspheres 
relative to best supportive care (BSC) in the treatment of chemotherapy 
refractory mCRC from the perspective of the UK national healthcare payer.
METHODS: A cost-utility model was developed in Microsoft Excel to simulate 
transitions from progression-free survival to post-progression survival and 
death in patients with mCRC. Unit costs were captured in 2019 pounds sterling 
(GBP) based on the literature, formulary listings, and National Health Service 
(NHS) England reference costs. Future costs and effects were discounted at 3.5% 
per annum. A series of one-way sensitivity analyses, and probabilistic 
sensitivity analysis (PSA) were conducted.
RESULTS: The base case analysis showed that SIR-Spheres Y-90 resin microspheres 
would result in an increase in discounted quality-adjusted life years gained 
from 0.69 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) to 1.50 QALYs, with an associated 
increase in cost from GBP 15,268 to GBP 34,168 yielding an incremental 
cost-utility ratio of GBP 23,435 per QALY. PSA showed that there would be a 56% 
likelihood that SIR-Spheres Y-90 resin microspheres would be cost-effective 
relative to BSC at a willingness-to-pay threshold of GBP 30,000 per QALY gained.
CONCLUSIONS: This cost-utility analysis showed that, relative to BSC, 
SIR-Spheres Y-90 resin microspheres would be a cost-effective treatment option 
for patients with mCRC in the UK setting from the national healthcare payer 
perspective.

With a growing number of obese patients throughout the world, weight loss 
surgery has surged in popularity. Not only have bariatric surgeries been shown 
to improve obesity-related comorbidities, but they have also had a great impact 
on both the quality of life and life expectancy of patients.  Care for the 
bariatric patient does not cease in the OR. These patients need close follow up 
and care from experts in the fields of nutrition, psychiatry, and internal 
medicine in addition to their surgeon. This paper will provide a review of the 
types of bariatric surgery and anticipated benefits in regard to weight loss and 
co-morbidity improvement, expected alterations in nutrition and eating habits, 
potential complications, and the psychological impact surgery and subsequent 
weight loss has on bariatric patients.

Renal cell carcinoma, of which clear cell carcinoma is the most common 
histological subtype (80 to 90 percent), comprises 90 percent of all Kidney 
tumors. Traditional morphological classification of these tumors divides them 
into three main subtypes – clear cell, papillary, and chromophobe 
subtypes. Clear cell and papillary cell cancer originate from the proximal 
tubular cells, while chromophobe cell cancers originate from the intercalated 
cells. The percentage of distant metastases in these various subtypes varies 
from 15 percent in clear cell carcinoma to 3 percent in papillary and 4 percent 
in chromophobe cell cancers.  The cancer-specific 10-year survival ranges from 
71 percent in clear cell cancer to 91 percent in papillary cancer, 88 percent in 
chromophobe cancer, and 33 percent in collecting duct cancers. As is expected, 
diagnosis at an earlier stage offers a relatively higher chance of cure. The 
goals of the management of advanced RCC emphasize a focus upon improvement in 
the quality of life parameters. Clear cell tumors have the propensity to spread 
hematogenous, with direct extension into the major vessels – namely the renal 
veins and the inferior vena cava. Lung, bone, brain, liver, lymph nodes, liver, 
and adrenal glands form the main sites of dissemination. Lytic bony metastases, 
which might become sclerotic with treatment, can be present. Clear cell 
carcinoma is considered uniformly metastatic, irrespective of the tumor size.

Cost-effectiveness of ribociclib as initial treatment for premenopausal women 
with advanced breast cancer in Singapore.

BACKGROUND: CDK4/6 inhibitors have shown promising results for treating advanced 
breast cancer (ABC) and are routinely used in Singapore. In view of their high 
costs, it is important to assess their relative value compared to existing 
standards of care in the local setting.
AIMS: This study evaluates the cost-effectiveness of adding ribociclib to 
goserelin and a nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor or tamoxifen as initial therapy 
for premenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive (HR+), human epidermal 
growth factor receptor 2-negative (HER2-) ABC in Singapore.
METHODS: A partitioned survival model with four health states (progression-free 
on first-line treatment, progression-free on second-line treatment, progressed 
disease, and death) was developed from a healthcare system perspective over a 
10-year time horizon. Key clinical inputs were derived from the MONALEESA-7 
trial, and survival curves were extrapolated beyond the trial period. Health 
state utilities were derived from the literature and direct medical costs were 
obtained from local public healthcare institutions. A discount rate of 3% was 
applied to both costs and outcomes. One-way deterministic and probabilistic 
sensitivity analyses were conducted to explore uncertainties.
RESULTS: The base-case analysis resulted in an incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio (ICER) of SGD197, 667 per quality-adjusted life-year. Sensitivity analyses 
showed that the ICER was sensitive to the survival parametric distribution, 
ribociclib price, time horizon, and utility weights used. Even when these were 
varied, ICERs remained high and not cost-effective in the local context.
CONCLUSION: At its current price, adding ribociclib to endocrine therapy is 
unlikely to be cost-effective in Singapore for HR+, HER2- ABC. Results from this 
study are useful to inform future funding decisions for CDK4/6 inhibitors 
alongside other factors including clinical effectiveness, safety, and budget 
impact considerations.

This study aimed to assess the cost-utility and cost-effectiveness of 
group-based behavioral activation with mindfulness (BAM) versus care as usual 
(CAU) for treating subthreshold depression in primary care. Adults aged 18 years 
or older with subthreshold depression were randomized into two arms and were 
followed up for 12 months. BAM group was provided with eight 2-h weekly 
treatment by trained allied healthcare workers. CAU group could access to usual 
medical care but did not receive extra interventions. The health service cost in 
the past 12 months was self-reported by the participants. Quality-adjusted Life 
Years (QALYs) and clinical outcome (incidence of major depressive disorder 
progression) were measured. Willingness-to-pay ratio for cost-utility analysis 
(CUA) and cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) was US$50,000 per QALY and US$20,000 
per prevented major depression case, respectively. These ratios were used in the 
cost-effective acceptability curve analyses to estimate the probability of 
cost-effectiveness of the estimated incremental cost effectiveness ratios (ICER) 
of BAM versus CAU. A total of 115 and 116 participants were included in the BAM 
group and CAU respectively. The estimated CUA ICER was US5,979 per QALY and had 
a probability of 0.93 that BAM was cost-effective when compared to CAU. 
Furthermore, when compared to CAU, BAM was cost-effective in preventing 
progression of major depression: the estimated CEA ICER was US$1046 per 
preventable case of major progression with a probability of 0.99 to be 
cost-effective. Group-based BAM is considered as a cost-effective alternative 
treatment for treating subthreshold depression by preventing major depressive 
disorder.

Skeletal muscle, the largest organ in the human body, accounting for 
approximately 40% of body weight, plays important roles in exercise and energy 
expenditure. In the elderly, there is often a progressive decline in skeletal 
muscle mass and function, a condition known as sarcopenia, which can lead to 
bedridden conditions, wheelchair confinement as well as reducing the quality of 
life (QOL). In developed countries with aging populations, the prevention and 
management of sarcopenia are important for the improvement of health and life 
expectancy in these populations. Recently, vitamin D, a fat-soluble vitamin, has 
been attracting attention due to its importance in sarcopenia. This review will 
focus on the effects of vitamin D deficiency and supplementation on sarcopenia.

As life expectancy in people living with HIV (PLWH) has increased, the focus of 
management has shifted to preventing and treating chronic illnesses, but few 
services exist for the assessment and management of these individuals. Here, we 
provide an initial description of a geriatric service for people living with HIV 
and present data from a service evaluation undertaken in the clinic. We 
conducted an evaluation of the first 52 patients seen in the clinic between 2016 
and 2019. We present patient demographic data, assessment outcomes, diagnoses 
given, and interventions delivered to those seen in the clinic. The average age 
of attendees was 67. Primary reasons for referral to the clinic included 
management of complex comorbidities, polypharmacy, and suspected geriatric 
syndrome (falls, frailty, poor mobility, or cognitive decline). The median 
(range) number of comorbidities and comedications (non-antiretrovirals) was 7 
(2-19) and 9 (1-15), respectively. All attendees had an undetectable viral load. 
Geriatric syndromes were observed in 26 (50%) patients reviewed in the clinic, 
with frailty and mental health disease being the most common syndromes. 
Interventions offered to patients included combination antiretroviral therapy 
modification, further health investigations, signposting to rehabilitation or 
social care services, and in-clinic advice. High levels of acceptability among 
patients and healthcare professionals were reported. The evaluation suggests 
that specialist geriatric HIV services might play a role in the management of 
older people with HIV with geriatric syndromes.

INTRODUCTION: Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a silent, progressive disease 
that can lead to death. It is easily diagnosed with noninvasive methods and its 
routine treatment has excellent results. This creates an optimal situation for 
population screening programs. The aim of this paper was to assess results and 
methodological quality of cost-utility studies on screening versus no screening 
scenarios for AAA to assess future establishment of new AAA screening programs.
EVIDENCE ACQUISITON: A systematic review of efficiency (cost-effectiveness and 
cost-utility) studies was performed, finally selecting cost-utility studies on 
AAA screening versus no screening. Papers were selected that dealt with 
efficiency of screening for AAA according to PICOTS framework and the 
methodological quality assessed according to the economic evaluation analyses 
described by Drummond and Caro. Two independent reviewers were involved in the 
procedure.
EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Research retrieved 88 studies. From those, 26 showed 
cost-effectiveness and cost-utility results. Finally, 10 studies had 
cost-utility results and suited criteria (published in the last 10 years; 
time-horizon: 10 years or more) for exhaustive analysis. All publications, 
except one, showed adequate incremental cost-utility ratios according to 
different national perspectives. Methodological assessment showed some quality 
limitations, but the majority of items analyzed were favorably answered after 
applying the questionnaires.
CONCLUSIONS: Confirmation of the cost-utility results in this revision at a 
national/regional level should be the basis for the implantation of new national 
screening programs worldwide. The methodological evaluation applied in this 
revision is crucial for the corresponding future piggy-back trials to assess 
routine application of national AAA screening programs.

Network analysis reveals how lipids and other cofactors influence membrane 
protein allostery.

Many membrane proteins are modulated by external stimuli, such as small molecule 
binding or change in pH, transmembrane voltage, or temperature. This modulation 
typically occurs at sites that are structurally distant from the functional 
site. Revealing the communication, known as allostery, between these two sites 
is key to understanding the mechanistic details of these proteins. Residue 
interaction networks of isolated proteins are commonly used to this end. 
Membrane proteins, however, are embedded in a lipid bilayer, which may 
contribute to allosteric communication. The fast diffusion of lipids hinders 
direct use of standard residue interaction networks. Here, we present an 
extension that includes cofactors such as lipids and small molecules in the 
network. The novel framework is applied to three membrane proteins: a 
voltage-gated ion channel (KCNQ1), a G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR-β2 
adrenergic receptor), and a pH-gated ion channel (KcsA). Through systematic 
analysis of the obtained networks and their components, we demonstrate the 
importance of lipids for membrane protein allostery. Finally, we reveal how 
small molecules may stabilize different protein states by allosterically 
coupling and decoupling the protein from the membrane.

BACKGROUND: Identifying regions with low life expectancy is important to policy 
makers, in particular for allocating resources in the health system. Life 
expectancy estimates for small regions are, however, often unreliable and lead 
to statistical uncertainties when the underlying populations are relatively 
small.
METHODS: We combine the most recent German data available (2015-2017) with a 
Bayesian model that includes several methodological advances. This allows us to 
estimate male and female life expectancy with good precision for all 402 German 
districts and to quantify the uncertainty of those estimates.
RESULTS: Across districts, life expectancy varies between 75.8 and 81.2 years 
for men and from 81.8 to 85.7 years for women. The spatial pattern is similar 
for women and men. Rural districts in eastern Germany and some districts of the 
Ruhr region have relatively low life expectancy. Districts with relatively high 
life expectancies cluster in Baden-Wuerttemberg and southern Bavaria. 
Exploratory analysis shows that average income, population density, and number 
of physicians per 100 000 inhabitants are not strongly correlated with life 
expectancy at district level. In contrast, indicators that point to particularly 
disadvantaged segments of the population (unemployment rate, welfare benefits) 
are better predictors of life expectancy.
CONCLUSIONS: We do not find a consistent urban-rural gap in life expectancy. Our 
results suggest that policies that improve living standards for poorer segment 
of the population are the most likely to reduce the existing differences in life 
expectancy.

Heat shock factor-1 (HSF-1) is a master regulator of stress responses across 
taxa. Overexpression of HSF-1 or genetic ablation of its conserved negative 
regulator, heat shock factor binding protein 1 (HSB-1), results in robust 
life-span extension in Caenorhabditis elegans Here, we found that increased 
HSF-1 activity elevates histone H4 levels in somatic tissues during development, 
while knockdown of H4 completely suppresses HSF-1-mediated longevity. Moreover, 
overexpression of H4 is sufficient to extend life span. Ablation of HSB-1 
induces an H4-dependent increase in micrococcal nuclease protection of both 
nuclear chromatin and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), which consequently results in 
reduced transcription of mtDNA-encoded complex IV genes, decreased respiratory 
capacity, and a mitochondrial unfolded protein response-dependent life-span 
extension. Collectively, our findings reveal a previously unknown role of 
HSB-1/HSF-1 signaling in modulation of mitochondrial function via mediating 
histone H4-dependent regulation of mtDNA gene expression and concomitantly 
acting as a determinant of organismal longevity.

INTRODUCTION: A new health state classification system has been developed for 
dental caries - Dental Caries Utility Index (DCUI) to facilitate the assessment 
of oral health interventions in the cost-utility analysis (CUA). This paper 
reports the protocol for a valuation study, which aims to generate a 
preference-based algorithm for the classification system for the DCUI.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Discrete choice experiments (DCEs) will be conducted to 
value health states generated by the DCUI classification system and preferences 
for these health states will be modelled to develop a utility algorithm. DCEs 
produce utility values on a latent scale and these values will be anchored into 
the full health-dead scale to calculate the quality-adjusted life years in CUA. 
There is no previous evidence for the most suitable anchoring method for dental 
caries health state valuation. Hence, we will first conduct pilot studies with 
two anchoring approaches; DCE including duration attribute and DCE anchoring to 
worst heath state in Visual Analogue Scale. Based on the pilot studies, the most 
suitable anchoring method among two approaches will be used in the main 
valuation survey, which will be conducted as an online survey among a 
representative sample of 2000 adults from the Australian general population. 
Participants will be asked to complete a set of DCE choice tasks along with 
anchoring tasks, basic social-demographic questions, DCUI, a generic 
preference-based measure and oral health quality of life instrument.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval for this study was obtained from the 
Human Research Ethics Committee, Griffith University (reference number 
HREC/2019/550). The generated algorithm will facilitate the use of the new 
dental caries preference-based measure in economic evaluations of oral health 
interventions. The results will be disseminated through journal articles and 
professional conferences.

Ciona robusta (Ciona intestinalis type A), a model organism for biological 
studies, belongs to ascidians, the main class of tunicates, which are the 
closest relatives of vertebrates. In Ciona, a project on the ontology of both 
development and anatomy is ongoing for several years. Its goal is to standardize 
a resource relating each anatomical structure to developmental stages. Today, 
the ontology is codified until the hatching larva stage. Here, we present its 
extension throughout the swimming larva stages, the metamorphosis, until the 
juvenile stages. For standardizing the developmental ontology, we acquired 
different time-lapse movies, confocal microscope images and histological serial 
section images for each developmental event from the hatching larva stage 
(17.5 h post fertilization) to the juvenile stage (7 days post fertilization). 
Combining these data, we defined 12 new distinct developmental stages (from 
Stage 26 to Stage 37), in addition to the previously defined 26 stages, referred 
to embryonic development. The new stages were grouped into four Periods named: 
Adhesion, Tail Absorption, Body Axis Rotation, and Juvenile. To build the 
anatomical ontology, 203 anatomical entities were identified, defined according 
to the literature, and annotated, taking advantage from the high resolution and 
the complementary information obtained from confocal microscopy and histology. 
The ontology describes the anatomical entities in hierarchical levels, from the 
cell level (cell lineage) to the tissue/organ level. Comparing the number of 
entities during development, we found two rounds on entity increase: in addition 
to the one occurring after fertilization, there is a second one during the Body 
Axis Rotation Period, when juvenile structures appear. Vice versa, one-third of 
anatomical entities associated with the embryo/larval life were significantly 
reduced at the beginning of metamorphosis. Data was finally integrated within 
the web-based resource "TunicAnatO", which includes a number of anatomical 
images and a dictionary with synonyms. This ontology will allow the 
standardization of data underpinning an accurate annotation of gene expression 
and the comprehension of mechanisms of differentiation. It will help in 
understanding the emergence of elaborated structures during both embryogenesis 
and metamorphosis, shedding light on tissue degeneration and differentiation 
occurring at metamorphosis.

Sphenoethmoidal meningoencephalocele is a rare congenital meningocele with 
unclear clinical course. Its clinical symptoms are diverse, and this disease is 
widely observed across all ages. The prognosis of this disease depends on the 
severity of the central nervous system complications. We reported a case of 
sphenoethmoidal meningoencephalocele incidentally discovered in a 2-yr-old 
patient, with the subsequent appearance of diabetes insipidus at school age. An 
endocrinological evaluation performed when the patient was nine years old using 
the TRH/CRH/LH-RH load test showed a low response of gonadotropins and slightly 
hyper-response and normal response of ACTH and TSH, respectively. GH provocative 
tests indicated severe GH deficiency. Desmopressin and GH treatment efficiently 
improved his growth rate and quality of life. His pituitary function had 
presumably been normal from the neonatal period to infancy, but the dysfunction 
gradually progressed over the next few years along with his physical growth. The 
symptoms were suspected to be the product of the natural course of his 
hypothalamus or pituitary gland degeneration, or were otherwise due to gradual 
damage by chronic mechanical compression or extension. These findings underscore 
the importance of conducting careful systemic management in the long term, 
specifically with respect to the endocrinological evaluation of sphenoethmoidal 
meningoencephalocele.

BACKGROUND: Demographic and epidemiological transitions have increased the life 
expectancy of middle aged women, resulting in higher burden of morbidities 
related to menopausal symptoms and also effect the quality of life (QOL).
OBJECTIVES: To study the prevalence of menopausal symptoms and its effect on QOL 
among rural middle aged women (40-60 years) of Haryana, India.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A community based cross-sectional study was conducted in 
400 middle aged women (40-60 years) from April 2018 to March 2019 by random 
sampling technique. The menopause rating scale was used to assess the prevalence 
of menopausal symptoms and the QOL and data were collected for sociodemographic 
factors, relevant menstrual history and other variables.
RESULTS: Prevalence of menopausal symptoms was found to be 87.7%. Majority of 
the study subjects had anxiety (80%), followed by physical and mental exhaustion 
(71.5%), sleep problem (61.2%), irritability (60.7%), Joint and muscular 
discomfort (56%) and heart problems (54%). The most classical symptom of 
menopause i.e., hot flushes were reported in 36.7%. The mean age of menopause 
was 47.53 standard deviation 4.5 years. Statistical significant difference was 
seen for the mean score of few symptoms i.e., hot flushes, sweating (P < 0.003) 
and joint and muscular discomfort (P < 0.014) between post and peri-menopausal 
groups. The QOL was impaired in 70.2% of study subjects. The psychological 
symptoms attributed 70.8% to the poor QOL.
CONCLUSION: To improve the QOL and to decrease the menopausal symptoms in these 
women, a holistic approach in the form of lifestyle and behavioral modification 
are required.
