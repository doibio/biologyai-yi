Senolytics are basically anti-cancer drugs, repurposed to kill senescent cells 
selectively. It is even more difficult to selectively kill senescent cells than 
to kill cancer cells. Based on lessons of cancer therapy, here I suggest how to 
exploit oncogene-addiction and to combine drugs to achieve selectivity. However, 
even if selective senolytic combinations will be developed, there is little 
evidence that a few senescent cells are responsible for organismal aging. I also 
discuss gerostatics, such as rapamycin and other rapalogs, pan-mTOR inhibitors, 
dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitors, which inhibit growth- and aging-promoting pathways. 
Unlike senolytics, gerostatics do not kill cells but slow down cellular 
geroconversion to senescence. Numerous studies demonstrated that inhibition of 
the mTOR pathways by any means (genetic, pharmacological and dietary) extends 
lifespan. Currently, only two studies demonstrated that senolytics (fisetin and 
a combination Dasatinib plus Quercetin) extend lifespan in mice. These 
senolytics slightly inhibit the mTOR pathway. Thus, life extension by these 
senolytics can be explained by their slight rapamycin-like (gerostatic) effects.

Urbanization is a pressing challenge for earth's humans because it is changing 
not only natural environments but also agricultural lands. Yet, the consequences 
of cropland loss on pest insect populations that largely depend on these 
habitats remain largely unclear. We used a 17-year data set to investigate the 
dynamics of three moth pest species (i.e., striped stem borer, yellow stem 
borer, and pink stem borer) and their driving forces across the largest 
mega-urban region of China. Total abundance of three pest species is declined by 
about 80%, which was strongly associated with cropland loss during rapid 
urbanization. Our findings indicate that not only the increasing conversion of 
natural areas to human-dominated landscapes but also that of agricultural lands 
to urban landscapes can be critical to insect populations. It is therefore 
essential to monitor and understand the insect dynamics in rapidly urbanizing 
regions, which are currently found in many developing countries worldwide.

Ambient ozone becomes one of significant environmental threats to chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in recent decades. To date, however, few 
systematic analyses have been performed to quantify ozone-attributable disease 
burden, globally and regionally. In this study, we aimed to comprehensively 
depict the global trend of ozone-related COPD premature deaths and 
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). We derived estimates of COPD burden 
attributable to ambient ozone for 204 countries and territories during 1990-2019 
from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019. We examined the number of deaths 
and DALYs, as well as age-standardized mortality rate (ASMR) and DALYs rate 
(ASDR) by sex, socio-demographic index (SDI), countries, and regions. Population 
attributable fractions (PAFs) were adopted to identify age groups vulnerable to 
ozone-related COPD. Estimated annual percentage changes (EAPCs) were calculated 
to assess the temporal trend of ozone-attributable COPD burden (e.g., ASMR and 
ASDR) between 1990 and 2019, using generalized linear models. Spearman rank 
correlation was applied to measure the relationships of estimated ASMR, ASDR, 
and EAPC with SDI. In 2019, COPD attributable to ambient ozone gave rise to 
365.22 (95% uncertainty interval: 174.93 to 564.27) thousand deaths and 6.21 
(2.99 to 9.63) million DALYs globally, representing a corresponding increase of 
76.11% and 56.37% versus 1990. During 1990-2019, however, a yearly decline of 
1.07% (0.81 to 1.33) was observed for ASMR and 1.30% (1.07 to 1.52) for ASDR. 
Considerable gender inequality continues in ozone-attributable COPD burden, with 
much greater impacts among men, and the gap is enlarged with the increase of 
age. In all age groups, the fractional contribution of ozone to COPD burden 
exhibited an overall increasing trend globally for both deaths (8.22% in 1990 
versus 11.13% in 2019) and DALYs (6.70% in 1990 versus 8.34% in 2019). The 
burden of COPD caused by ambient ozone varied substantially by geographical and 
socioeconomic regions. In 2019, the greatest ASMR and ASDR were seen in South 
Asia, followed by East Asia and Central Sub-Saharan Africa. Despite the clear 
drop of age-standardized rates (EAPC<0) in high, high-middle, and middle SDI 
regions, ASMR and ASDR in low and low-middle SDI regions continuously raised 
between 1990 and 2019. Higher SDI was found to be associated with lower EAPCs in 
ASMR (rs=-0.4405, p<0.001) and ASDR (rs=-0.4510, p<0.001). Although the global 
ASMR and ASDR of COPD attributable to ambient ozone have decreased from 1990 to 
2019, there has been an unnegligible increase in some low and low-middle SDI 
regions such as Southeast Asia, South Asia, and Andean Latin America. Findings 
may have some implications for formulating targeted plans and policies for 
future COPD prevention and ambient ozone management in different regions.

Preferably, lifespan-extending therapies should work when applied late in life 
without causing undesired pathologies. Reducing insulin/insulin-like growth 
factor (IGF)-1 signaling (IIS) increases lifespan across species, but the 
effects of reduced IIS interventions in extreme geriatric ages remains unknown. 
Using the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, we engineered the conditional 
depletion of the DAF-2/insulin/IGF-1 transmembrane receptor using an 
auxin-inducible degradation (AID) system. This allowed for the temporal and 
spatial reduction in DAF-2 protein levels at time points after which 
interventions such as RNAi become ineffective. Using this system, we found that 
AID-mediated depletion of DAF-2 protein surpasses the longevity of daf-2 
mutants. Depletion of DAF-2 during early adulthood resulted in multiple adverse 
phenotypes, including growth retardation, germline shrinkage, egg retention, and 
reduced brood size. By contrast, AID-mediated depletion of DAF-2 
post-reproduction, or specifically in the intestine in early adulthood, resulted 
in an extension of lifespan without these deleterious effects. Strikingly, at 
geriatric ages, when 75% of the population had died, AID-mediated depletion of 
DAF-2 protein resulted in a doubling in lifespan. Thus, we provide a 
proof-of-concept that even close to the end of an individual's lifespan, it is 
possible to slow aging and promote longevity.

Plain Language Summary: The goal of geroscience, or research into old age, is to 
promote health during old age, and thus, to increase lifespan. In the body, the 
groups of biochemical reactions, or ‘pathways’, that allow an organism to sense 
nutrients, and regulate growth and stress, play major roles in ensuring healthy 
aging. Indeed, organisms that do not produce a working version of the 
insulin/IGF-1 receptor, a protein involved in one such pathway, show increased 
lifespan. In the worm Caenorhabditis elegans, mutations in the insulin/IGF-1 
receptor can even double their lifespan. However, it is unclear whether this 
increase can be achieved once the organism has reached old age. To answer this 
question, Venz et al. genetically engineered the nematode worm C. elegans so 
that they could trigger the rapid degradation of the insulin/IGF-1 receptor 
either in the entire organism or in a specific tissue. Venz et al. started by 
aging several C. elegans worms for three weeks, until about 75% had died. At 
this point, they triggered the degradation of the insulin/IGF-1 receptor in some 
of the remaining worms, keeping the rest untreated as a control for the 
experiment. The results showed that the untreated worms died within a few days, 
while worms in which the insulin/IGF-1 receptor had been degraded lived for 
almost one more month. This demonstrates that it is possible to double the 
lifespan of an organism at the very end of life. Venz et al.’s findings suggest 
that it is possible to make interventions to extend an organism’s lifespan near 
the end of life that are as effective as if they were performed when the 
organism was younger. This sparks new questions regarding the quality of this 
lifespan extension: do the worms become younger with the intervention, or is 
aging simply slowed down?

As nucleobases in RNA and DNA, uracil and 5-methyluracil represent a recognized 
class of bioactive molecules and versatile ligands for coordination compounds 
with various biofunctional properties. In this study, 6-chloro-3-methyluracil 
(Hcmu) was used as an unexplored building block for the self-assembly generation 
of a new bioactive copper(II) complex, [Cu(cmu)2(H2O)2]·4H2O (1). This compound 
was isolated as a stable crystalline solid and fully characterized in solution 
and solid state by a variety of spectroscopic methods (UV-vis, EPR, fluorescence 
spectroscopy), cyclic voltammetry, X-ray diffraction, and DFT calculations. The 
structural, topological, H-bonding, and Hirshfeld surface features of 1 were 
also analyzed in detail. The compound 1 shows a distorted octahedral {CuN2O4} 
coordination environment with two trans cmu- ligands adopting a bidentate 
N,O-coordination mode. The monocopper(II) molecular units participate in strong 
H-bonding interactions with water molecules of crystallization, leading to 
structural 0D → 3D extension into a 3D H-bonded network with a tfz-d topology. 
Molecular docking and ADME analysis as well as antibacterial and antioxidant 
activity studies were performed to assess the bioactivity of 1. In particular, 
this compound exhibits a prominent antibacterial effect against Gram negative 
(E. coli, P. aeruginosa) and positive (S. aureus, B. cereus) bacteria. The 
obtained copper(II) complex also represents the first structurally characterized 
coordination compound derived from 6-chloro-3-methyluracil, thus introducing 
this bioactive building block into a family of uracil metal complexes with 
notable biofunctional properties.

Rates of survival with functional recovery for both in-hospital and 
out-of-hospital cardiac arrest are notably low. Extracorporeal cardiopulmonary 
resuscitation (ECPR) is emerging as a modality to improve prognosis by 
augmenting perfusion to vital end-organs by utilizing extracorporeal membrane 
oxygenation (ECMO) during conventional CPR and stabilizing the patient for 
interventions aimed at reversing the aetiology of the arrest. Implementing this 
emergent procedure requires a substantial investment in resources, and even the 
most successful ECPR programs may nonetheless burden healthcare systems, 
clinicians, patients, and their families with unsalvageable patients supported 
by extracorporeal devices. Non-randomized and observational studies have 
repeatedly shown an association between ECPR and improved survival, versus 
conventional CPR, for in-hospital cardiac arrest in select patient populations. 
Recently, randomized controlled trials suggest benefit for ECPR over standard 
resuscitation, as well as the feasibility of performing such trials, in 
out-of-hospital cardiac arrest within highly coordinated healthcare delivery 
systems. Application of these data to clinical practice should be done 
cautiously, with outcomes likely to vary by the setting and system within which 
ECPR is initiated. ECPR introduces important ethical challenges, including 
whether it should be considered an extension of CPR, at what point it becomes 
sustained organ replacement therapy, and how to approach patients unable to 
recover or be bridged to heart replacement therapy. The economic impact of ECPR 
varies by health system, and has the potential to outstrip resources if used 
indiscriminately. Ideally, studies should include economic evaluations to inform 
health care systems about the cost-benefits of this therapy.

PURPOSE: For patients with advanced cancer, timely referral to palliative care 
(PC) services can ensure that end-of-life care aligns with their preferences and 
goals. Overestimation of life expectancy may result in underutilization of PC 
services, counterproductive treatment measures, and reduced quality of life for 
patients. We assessed the impact of a commercially available augmented 
intelligence (AI) tool to predict 30-day mortality risk on PC service 
utilization in a real-world setting.
METHODS: Patients within a large hematology-oncology practice were scored weekly 
between June 2018 and October 2019 with an AI tool to generate insights into 
short-term mortality risk. Patients identified by the tool as being at high or 
medium risk were assessed for a supportive care visit and further referred as 
appropriate. Average monthly rates of PC and hospice referrals were calculated 5 
months predeployment and 17 months postdeployment of the tool in the practice.
RESULTS: The mean rate of PC consults increased from 17.3 to 29.1 per 1,000 
patients per month (PPM) pre- and postdeployment, whereas the mean rate of 
hospice referrals increased from 0.2 to 1.6 per 1,000 PPM. Eliminating the first 
6 months following deployment to account for user learning curve, the mean rate 
of PC consults nearly doubled over baseline to 33.0 and hospice referrals 
increased 12-fold to 2.4 PPM.
CONCLUSION: Deployment of an AI tool at a hematology-oncology practice was found 
to be feasible for identifying patients at high or medium risk for short-term 
mortality. Insights generated by the tool drove clinical practice changes, 
resulting in significant increases in PC and hospice referrals.

Cancer is now a formidable health care burden in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) due to 
lifestyle westernization and longer life expectancy. The exponential increase in 
cancer incidence coupled with high mortality rate is not comparable with that 
seen in westernized countries. To address global cancer disparity, globalization 
of cancer clinical trials to involve sub-Saharan Africa can serve as a platform 
where innovative targeted therapies can be made available to patients in the 
environ. In the 2019 African Organization for Research and Training in Cancer 
(AORTIC) conference held at Maputo, Mozambique, a group of clinical trialists 
spanning across multiple continents highlighted the opportunities in Africa for 
the conduct of cancer clinical trials. The secondary purpose of the meeting was 
to address the belief that Africa was incapable of conducting interventional 
cancer trials but showed the in-continent strengths, such as available 
capacities, trained local clinical trialists with clinical trial experiences, 
clinical trial consortia, local capabilities, mapping out logistics, ethical 
consideration, political will, real-time benefits of clinical trials to clinical 
practice, and future directions for trials.

The gender gap in life expectancy and cancer incidence suggests differences in 
the aging process between the sexes. Genomic instability has been recognized as 
a key factor in aging, but little is known about sex-specific differences. 
Therefore, we analyzed DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair in cycling human 
peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) from male and female donors of different age. 
Reporter-based DSB repair analyses revealed differential regulation of pathway 
usage in PBL from male and female donors with age: Non-homologous end joining 
(NHEJ) was inversely regulated in men and women; the activity of pathways 
requiring end processing and strand annealing steps such as 
microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ) declined with age in women but not in 
men. Screening candidate proteins identified the NHEJ protein KU70 as well as 
the end resection regulatory factors ATM and BLM showing reduced expression 
during aging in women. Consistently, the regulatory factor BLM contributed to 
the MMEJ proficiency in young but not in old women as demonstrated by knockdown 
analysis. In conclusion, we show that DSB repair is subject to changes upon 
aging and age-related changes in DSB repair are distinct in men and women.

Nepal.

INTRODUCTION: As the medical facilities are improving, the life expectancy is 
increasing which has led to rapid rise in elderly population. The epidemiology 
of many diseases in elderly has been modified, including calcium imbalance. This 
study aims to know the prevalence of hypocalcemia in elderly population visiting 
a tertiary care center of Kathmandu.
METHODS: A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted in a tertiary care 
center of Kathmandu from March to July 2020 after obtaining ethical clearance 
(Ref: 2003202007). Total 402 participants at or above 60 years of age groups 
visiting outpatient departments were included in the study by convenience 
sampling method excluding those under vitamin D and calcium supplements. Serum 
total calcium level was measured using standard routine method and corrected 
with albumin. The serum calcium value less than 8 mg/dl was considered as 
hypocalcemia in accordance with the reference range of our laboratory. Data 
analysis for calculation of frequency and proportion was done in Statistical 
Package of Social Sciences.
RESULTS: The prevalence of hypocalcaemia in elderly was found to be 97 (24.1%). 
Out of 286 participants of age group 60-74 years, hypocalcemia was seen in 75 
(26.2%) and among 116 participants of age group >74 years, 22 (19%) were 
hypocalcemic. Among 181 male participants, 44 (24.3%) had hypocalcemia and out 
of 221 female participants, 53 (24%) had hypocalcemia.
CONCLUSIONS: The finding of present study suggests that hypocalcemia is common 
among elderly which can be life threatening. Therefore, regular monitoring of 
serum calcium is recommended for this age group.

BACKGROUND: Schizophrenia patients have shorter life expectancy often owing to 
preventable physical illnesses and sub-optimal utilization of medical services. 
However, the association between service-utilization and mortality has not been 
explored.
AIM: To assess whether medical service-utilization moderates the association 
between physical morbidity and premature mortality in a nation-wide cohort.
METHODS: A population representative database of the largest health provider in 
Israel was analyzed. All electronic health records of patients with 
schizophrenia diagnosis (ICD code F.20) (n = 24,679) were followed-up between 
2012 and 2015, and compared to the general population (n = 2,232,804), in terms 
of metabolic and cardiovascular morbidity, all-cause mortality, primary medical 
and specialist health service-utilization and general hospitalizations.
RESULTS: Schizophrenia was associated with increased mortality risk (adjusted 
hazard ratio (aHR) = 3.52, 95%CI 3.35-3.72). Most deaths were related to 
physical illnesses. Metabolic syndrome components, except chronic hypertension, 
were more prevalent among patients. They were referred more frequently to 
primary and less to secondary services (aHR = 1.05, 95%CI 1.04-1.06, aHR = 0.95, 
95%CI 0.94-0.97, respectively), with higher hospitalization rates (0.23 ± 0.90 
vs 0.10 ± 0.50 per year), and longer mean duration of hospitalization 
(2.02 ± 10.24 vs 0.68 ± 5.51 days, P < 0.001). More contacts with primary care 
physicians or specialists positively moderated the association between mortality 
and metabolic disturbances in patients with schizophrenia; more contacts were 
associated with better outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: An association between premature mortality and metabolic syndrome 
was found among schizophrenia patients while utilization of primary/secondary 
medical services moderated the lethal effects of metabolic dysregulation. 
Increased integrative primary care and a national monitoring system are 
warranted to reduce mortality rate in this population.

OBJECTIVES: Concerns about the increasing impact of severe COVID-19 in younger 
individuals in Brazil came after a recent synchronised country-wide wave of 
cases in Brazil. This communication analyses how hospitalisations due to 
COVID-19 changed in the age groups 18-49 years and ≥70 years.
STUDY DESIGN: Longitudinal study based on secondary data.
METHODS: Data from SIVEP-Gripe, a public and open-access database of Severe 
Acute Respiratory Illness records (including COVID-19 notifications), were used 
in this study. Statistical control charts examined changes in the magnitude and 
variation of younger (18-49 years) and older (≥70 years) adults who were 
hospitalised between 15th March 2020 and 19th June 2021.
RESULTS: During the few first weeks of the pandemic in Brazil, the number of 
COVID-19 hospitalisations increased in older adults but decreased in younger 
adults. Subsequently, hospitalisations reached statistical control zones in 
epidemiological weeks (EW) 19-48 of 2020 (EW 19-48/2020) and EW 03-05/2021 
(18-49 y, mean = 26.1%; ≥70 y, mean = 32.8%). Between EW 49/2020 and EW 02/2021, 
the number of hospitalisations of younger adults dropped to levels below the 
lower control limit. In contrast, the number of hospitalisations of older adults 
surpassed the upper limit of the corresponding statistical control zones. 
However, from EW 06/2021, numbers of hospitalisations changed from statistical 
control zones, with hospitalisations of younger adults increasing and reaching 
44.9% in EW 24/2021 and hospitalisations of older adults decreasing until EW 
19/2021 (14.1%) and reaching 17.3% in EW 24/2021.
CONCLUSIONS: An increasing number of COVID-19 hospitalisations were observed in 
younger adults from EW 06/2021. This could be a result of the successful 
vaccination programme in older adults, who were initially prioritised, and 
possibly an increased exposure to highly transmissible variants of COVID-19 in 
younger adults who had to go to work in the absence of social protection (i.e. 
government financial support). Potential consequences of COVID-19 
hospitalisations in younger adults could include a reduced life expectancy of 
the population and an increased number of people unable to perform daily 
activities due to post-COVID-19 conditions.

BACKGROUND: Patients with stage 5 chronic kidney disease (CKD5) collaborate with 
their clinicians when choosing their future treatment modality. Most elderly 
patients with CKD5 may only have two treatment options: dialysis or conservative 
kidney management (CKM). The objective of this systematic review was to 
investigate whether CKM offers a quantity or quality of life benefit compared to 
dialysis for some patients with CKD5.
METHODS: The databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, and CINAHL were 
systematically searched for studies comparing patients with CKD5 who had chosen 
or were treated with either CKM or dialysis. The primary outcomes were mortality 
and quality of life (QoL). Hospitalization, symptom burden, and place of death 
were secondary outcomes. For studies reporting hazard ratios, pooled values were 
calculated, and forest plots conducted.
RESULTS: Twenty-five primary studies, all observational, were identified. All 
studies reported an increased mortality in patients treated with CKM (pooled 
hazard ratio 0.47, 95 % confidence interval 0.34-0.65). For patients aged ≥ 80 
years and for elderly individuals with comorbidities, results were ambiguous. In 
most studies, CKM seemed advantageous for QoL and secondary outcomes. Findings 
were limited by the heterogeneity of studies and biased outcomes favouring 
dialysis.
CONCLUSIONS: In general, patients with CKD5 who have chosen or are on CKM live 
for a shorter time than patients who have chosen or are on dialysis. In patients 
aged ≥ 80 years old, and in elderly individuals with comorbidities, the survival 
benefits of dialysis seem to be lost. Regarding QoL, symptom burden, 
hospitalization, and place of death, CKM may have advantages. Higher quality 
studies are needed to guide patients and clinicians in the decision-making 
process.

Temporal bone squamous cell carcinoma (TBSCC) is a rare head and neck malignancy 
with the incidence 0.8 -1.0 cases in 1 million population. We are reporting a 
case series on the TBSCC cases that were operated on at Sarawak General 
Hospital, Malaysia. Ten patients were identified and collected with the 
presentation and type of surgery performed. It has been challenging for us to 
manage with recorded 2 years surviving in 6 out of 10 patients operated within 
this period. An adequate management with proper surgical resection of tumour and 
radiotherapy can extend the life expectancy for TBSCC patients.

INTRODUCTION: Osteoporosis and resulting fracture is a major public health 
concern worldwide. With increase in life expectancy, osteoporosis and fragility 
fracture is expected to be more prevalent. It is associated with high patient 
morbidity, while hip and vertebral fractures have high mortality. The real 
burden of the problem is yet to be established in developing countries like 
Nepal. This study aims to find out the prevalence of osteoporosis among 
postmenopausal women visiting a tertiary care hospital.
METHODS: This descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted among 89 
postmenopausal women attending at Orthopedic Outpatient Department of Bharatpur 
Hospital from 1st January 2019 to 30th December 2019 with postmenopausal status. 
The ethical clearance was taken from the Institutional Review Committee of 
Bharatpur Hospital. Convenience sampling technique was used. Bone Mineral 
Density was estimated with dual energy x-ray absorptiometry scan Statistical 
Package for Social Science was used for analysis. Point estimate at 95% 
Confidence Interval was calculated along with frequency and proportion for 
binary data.
RESULTS: Out of 89 postmenopausal women, 29 (32.58%) (Confidence Interval = 
32.48-32.68) women had osteoporosis. The mean age and Bone Mineral Density were 
62.16±8.17 years and 0.968±0.14 g/cm² respectively. The women with history of 
fragility fracture had low bone mineral density.
CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence of osteoporosis was high. Women with history of 
fragility fracture are at increased risk of another fragility fracture. It is 
hence necessary to have awareness programs and early screening to minimize the 
magnitude of morbidity and mortality associated with osteoporosis.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate a national vitamin D supplementation 
program's cost-effectiveness among Iranian adolescents to prevent cardiovascular 
diseases (CVDs) in adulthood.
STUDY DESIGN: A cost-effectiveness analytical study.
METHODS: A decision tree model was adopted to evaluate the cost per 
quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) of monthly intake of nine pearls of 50,000 IU 
vitamin D for nine months to prevent CVD a one-year horizon compared to no 
intervention. The analysis was conducted in Iranian adolescents in first or 
second high school grades of 47 climatically different Iran regions.
RESULTS: Our analytical analysis estimated the 1090$ cost per QALY gained of the 
monthly intake of 50,000 IU vitamin D for nine months among adolescents over a 
one-year horizon. Based on the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) 
threshold of 1032-2666, vitamin D supplementation was cost-effective for 
adolescents to prevent adulthood CVD. It means that vitamin D supplementation 
costs were substantially less than the costs of CVD treatments compared to the 
no intervention.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on these findings, the national program of vitamin D 
supplementation in adolescents would be cost effective to prevent CVD 
development in adulthood. From an economic perspective, vitamin D 
supplementation, especially in adolescents with vitamin D deficiency, would be 
administrated.

The shelf life of chestnut rose beverage is largely dependent on packaging 
method and storage temperature. In this study, we investigated the effects of 
packaging beverages in bottles made of either polyethylene terephthalate (PET) 
or PEN (polyethylene naphthalate)/PET and storage temperature (4, 25, 37, and 55 
℃) on the shelf life of chestnut rose beverage. The physicochemical parameters 
and enzyme activity of beverages were evaluated, and we found that at 4 °C, the 
vitamin C, superoxide dismutase, and total polyphenol contents of beverages 
stored in PEN/PET bottles increased by 9.95 ± 0.49%, 2.86 ± 0.13%, and 
3.23 ± 0.09% respectively, compared to beverages in ordinary PET bottles. In 
addition, other characteristic indicators including total soluble solids, 
browning index, and color value were also significantly improved. A shelf-life 
model was established based on the Arrhenius equation, and it will help 
distributors and consumers to determine the storage time and optimal shelf life 
of chestnut rose beverage.

BACKGROUND: Dengue is the most prevalent and rapidly spreading mosquito-borne 
viral disease. We present the global, regional and national burden of dengue 
from 1990 to 2019 based on the findings from the Global Burden of Diseases, 
Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2019 (GBD 2019).
METHODS: Based upon GBD 2019 dengue data on age-standardized incidence rate 
(ASIR), age-standardized death rate (ASDR) and age-standardized 
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) rate, this study estimates and presents 
annual percentage change (EAPC) to quantify trends over time to assess potential 
correlates of increased dengue activity, such as global travel and warming.
RESULTS: Globally from 1990 to 2019, dengue incident cases, deaths and DALYs 
gradually increased. Those under 5 years of age, once accounting for the largest 
portion of deaths and DALYs in 1990, were eclipsed by those who were 15-49 years 
old in 2019. Age standardized incidence [ASIR: EAPC: 3.16, 95% confidence 
interval (CI): 2.90-3.43], death (ASDR: EAPC: 5.42, 95% CI: 2.64-8.28) and DALY 
rates (EAPC: 2.31, 95% CI: 2.00-2.62) accelerated most among high-middle and 
high sociodemographic index (SDI) regions. South-East Asia and South Asia had 
most of the dengue incident cases, deaths and DALYs, but East Asia had the 
fastest rise in ASIR (EAPC: 4.57, 95% CI: 4.31, 4.82), while Tropical Latin 
America led in ASDR (EAPC: 11.32, 95% CI: 9.11, 13.58) and age-standardized 
DALYs rate (EAPC: 4.13, 95% CI: 2.98, 5.29). SDI showed consistent bell-shaped 
relationship with ASIR, ASDR and age-standardized DALYs rate. Global land-ocean 
temperature index and air passenger travel metrics were found to be remarkably 
positively correlated with dengue burden.
CONCLUSIONS: The burden of dengue has become heavier from 1990 to 2019, amidst
