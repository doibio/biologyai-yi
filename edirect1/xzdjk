RESULTS: Thirty patients met the inclusion criteria. A statistically significant 
change in PTH over time was observed (Friedman ANOVA; p = 0.0001). The post-hoc 
test showed a statistically significant decrease in PTH: measurements 5-8 
relative to measurement 1, and measurements 4-8 relative to measurement 2 (p < 
0.05). No significant correlations between 25 hydroxyvitamin D3 deficiency, age, 
diagnosis, SOFA score, and PTH levels were observed. A statistical test 
indicated that serum concentrations of PTH were significantly higher in the de 
novo sepsis group (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: The PTH serum concentration decreases during the course of CRRT in 
the majority of patients. When the course of the disease starts to be 
complicated by sepsis, PTH serum levels then remain high. A probable reason for 
this is the existence of the inflammatory state triggered by sepsis.

AIM: One approach to measure the demographic impacts of death is to examine the 
number of lost years of life. The present paper aims to estimate the "Years of 
Lost Life" (YLL) due to the main causes of death in Yazd province of Iran.
METHOD: The present study is an epidemiological examination for which the 
statistical population included all the death incidents in Yazd province 
(excluding stillbirth cases) over two time periods of 2011 and 2016 with a 
5-year distance. The required data were obtained based on the Comprehensive 
System of Mortality Registration maintained by the Ministry of Health and 
Medical Education; while the standard life expectancy data were based on the 
World Health Organization standards using standard life table, level 26 of the 
West model (Coale and Demeny) for Japanese men and women. The standard YLL was 
calculated according to the WHO standard using a 0.03 relaxation rate for the 
future time and weighting coefficient for various ages and life years through 
the formula using the Microsoft Excel software.
RESULTS: The findings of the present study suggest that two main causes of YLL 
in Yazd province during the year of 2011 were cardiovascular difficulties with 
the rates of 31.6 per 1000 persons for women and 27.1 per 1000 persons for men, 
and cancers with the rates of 14.9 per 1000 persons for women and 16.2 per 1000 
persons for men. While the above numbers in 2016 were, respectively 22.5 per 
1000 persons for women and 25.5 per 1000 persons for men due to cardiovascular 
difficulties; and 18 per 1000 persons for women and 15.5/1000 for men due to 
various types of cancers.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that cardiovascular diseases and cancers are 
the main factors leading to Years of Lost Lifetime for the residents of Yazd 
province in Iran.

BACKGROUND: Age is considered as one of the most important risk-factor for many 
types of solid and hematological cancers, as their incidence increases with age 
in parallel to the ever-growing elderly population. Moreover, cancer incidence 
is constantly increasing as a consequence of the increase in life expectancy 
that favors the process of cellular senescence. Geriatric assessment has been 
increasingly recognized as predictive and prognostic instrument to detect 
frailty in older adults with cancer. In particular, the G8 score is a simple and 
reproducible instrument to identify elderly patients who should undergo full 
geriatric evaluation. Due to their frailty, elderly patients may be often 
under-treated and a therapeutic choice based also on a comprehensive geriatric 
assessment (CGA) is recommended. With these premises, we aim to test the impact 
of the CGA based interventions on the quality of life (QoL) of frail elderly 
onco-hematological patients, identified by the G8 screening, candidate for 
innovative target directed drugs or treatments including the combination of 
radiotherapy and chemotherapy (RT + CT).
METHODS: Patients aged > 65 years, candidate to target directed agents or to 
RT + CT treatments are screened for frailty by the G8 test; those patients 
classified as frail (G8 ≤ 14) are randomized to receive a CGA at baseline or to 
conventional care. The primary endpoint is QoL, assessed by EORTC QLQ-C30C. As 
collateral biological study, the potential prognostic/predictive role of T-cell 
senescence and myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC) are evaluated on plasma 
samples.
DISCUSSION: This trial will contribute to define the impact of CGA on the 
management of frail elderly onco-hematologic patients candidate to innovative 
biological drugs or to integrated schedules with the association of RT + CT. 
Furthermore, the use of plasma samples to assess the potential prognostic value 
of imbalance of immune-competent cells is expected to contribute to the 
individualized care of elderly patients, resulting into a fine tuning of the 
therapeutic strategies.

BACKGROUND: Baseline imbalances, skewed costs, the correlation between costs and 
effects, and missing data are statistical challenges that are often not 
adequately accounted for in the analysis of cost-effectiveness data. This study 
aims to illustrate the impact of accounting for these statistical challenges in 
trial-based economic evaluations.
METHODS: Data from two trial-based economic evaluations, the REALISE and 
HypoAware studies, were used. In total, 14 full cost-effectiveness analyses were 
performed per study, in which the four statistical challenges in trial-based 
economic evaluations were taken into account step-by-step. Statistical 
approaches were compared in terms of the resulting cost and effect differences, 
ICERs, and probabilities of cost-effectiveness.
RESULTS: In the REALISE study and HypoAware study, the ICER ranged from 
636,744€/QALY and 90,989€/QALY when ignoring all statistical challenges to 
- 7502€/QALY and 46,592€/QALY when accounting for all statistical challenges, 
respectively. The probabilities of the intervention being cost-effective at 0€/ 
QALY gained were 0.67 and 0.59 when ignoring all statistical challenges, and 
0.54 and 0.27 when all of the statistical challenges were taken into account for 
the REALISE study and HypoAware study, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Not accounting for baseline imbalances, skewed costs, correlated 
costs and effects, and missing data in trial-based economic evaluations may 
notably impact results. Therefore, when conducting trial-based economic 
evaluations, it is important to align the statistical approach with the 
identified statistical challenges in cost-effectiveness data. To facilitate 
researchers in handling statistical challenges in trial-based economic 
evaluations, software code is provided.

Several randomized controlled trials evaluating the effectiveness of 
transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) against surgical aortic valve 
replacement have been published to date. The fact that higher risk populations 
were implemented first does not necessarily mean that they benefit more from a 
TAVR procedure. We performed meta-analysis of the 8 randomized clinical trials 
performing TAVR for both mortality and stroke outcomes. Meta-regression was used 
to evaluate the association between mean surgical risk using the Society of 
Thoracic Surgeons (STS) score and hazard ratio observed in each of the trials. 
Overall, TAVR was associated with a significant reduction of both mortality and 
stroke across the whole spectrum of patients enrolled, with no evidence of 
significant heterogeneity. Metaregression analysis does not suggest a 
statistically significant association between STS score and hazard ratio for 
both mortality and stroke. This observation suggests reconsidering the use of 
risk scores to prioritize TAVR utilization in higher risk patients, while more 
focus should be done on patient's life expectancy related to TAVR durability.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this economic evaluation was to assess whether home 
management could represent a cost-effective strategy in the patient pathway of 
type 1 diabetes (T1D). This is based on the Delivering Early Care In Diabetes 
Evaluation trial (ISRCTN78114042), which compared home versus hospital 
management from diagnosis in childhood diabetes and found no statistically 
significant difference in glycaemic control at 24 months.
DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis alongside a randomised controlled trial.
SETTING: Eight paediatric diabetes centres in England, Wales and Northern 
Ireland.
PARTICIPANTS: 203 clinically well children aged under 17 years, with newly 
diagnosed T1D and their carers.
OUTCOME MEASURES: The base-case analysis adopted n National Health Service (NHS) 
perspective. A scenario analysis assessed costs from a broader societal 
perspective. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), expressed as cost 
per mmol/mol reduction in glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), was based on the mean 
difference in costs between the home and hospital groups, divided by mean 
differences in effectiveness (HbA1c). Uncertainty was considered in terms of the 
probability of cost-effectiveness.
RESULTS: At 24 months postintervention, the base-case analysis showed a 
difference in costs between home and hospital, in favour of home management 
(mean difference -£2,217; 95% CI -£2825 to -£1,609; p<0.001). Home care 
dominated, with an ICER of £7434 (saved) per mmol/mol reduction of HbA1c. The 
results of the scenario analysis also favoured home management. The greatest 
driver of cost differences was hospitalisation during the initiation period.
CONCLUSIONS: Home management from diagnosis of children with T1D who are 
medically stable represents a less costly approach for the NHS in the UK, 
without impacting clinical effectiveness.

PURPOSE: This research determines the extent to which farmers benefit from 
agricultural extension activities and services through realizing higher 
biological crop yields in the Al-Baha region of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. 
Additionally, the nature of the relationship between the personal, economic and 
social characteristics of farmers and the degree to which they benefit from 
agricultural extension activities and services are studied.
METHODOLOGY: A simple random sample representing the community of 315 farmers 
was drawn. Data were collected through a personal interview with a pre-tested 
questionnaire to satisfy the objectives of the study. Data are subjected to 
analyses and are interpreted in terms of percentages, arithmetic averages, and 
standard deviations in addition to the simple Pearson correlation coefficients.
RESULTS: The results show that most of the respondents depend on personal 
experience, friends, family and neighbors, merchants and sellers of agricultural 
production supplies as sources of agricultural information for enhanced crop 
yields. Multiple regression analysis reveals that both the educational status 
and the agricultural information sources are important factors that increase 
farmers benefit from extension activities. Farmers receive most benefits from 
the extension activities and services from bringing in foreign workers, 
conducting field trips to farms, and identifying problems faced by farmers.
RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS: The outcome of this questionnaire limits 
generalization of the findings for other parts of the Kingdom due to 
geographical and natural resources variations.
PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: The personal and socio-economic characteristics of the 
surveyed population provide the extension service with insight into their 
composition - a basis to formulate workable extension programs. For the 
extension planners of the area, this effort provides a baseline study and may 
assist with targeting the appropriate farmers and catering the right solutions 
to the problems. Such a study will help devise meaningful extension programs and 
save time and resources.
ORIGINALITY/VALUE: Little previous research on the usefulness of the Extension 
Service has been conducted in the region.
CONCLUSIONS: Effective, well-planned extension programs targeting the educated 
and mature farmers provided more benefits and helped them obtain higher crop 
yields.

INTRODUCTION: Elderly population is growing fast in the western world due to a 
reduction in birth rates and a marked increase in life expectancy with multiple 
co-morbidity that warrants greater attention by health care workers.
AIM: The purpose of the study is to investigate the levels of physical and 
mental health of elderly people living in Central Greece.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study design was adopted with self completed 
questionnaires. Data collected, included socio-demographic and general health 
information using the Greek version of General Health Questionnaire 28. 
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and regularity diagrams were employed.
RESULTS: The sample included 230 elderly people with an average age of 73.1 
years, women (53.5%), married (75.7%), with children (100%), primary school 
graduates (47.8%), residing in a city (72.2%), retired (90.9%), living with a 
spouse (68.3%), worked previously (96%) and 37.4% with a present monthly income 
of 301-600€. In the General Health Questionnaire, the internal consistency 
factor Cronbach's alpha for 'physical depressive symptoms' was 0.85, for 
'anxiety and insomnia' 0.86, for 'social dysfunction' 0.86 and for 'depressive 
sentiment' 0.89, which indicates an excellent reliability of the questionnaire. 
The 'social malfunction' sub-scale showed the highest score (8.9) then 'anxiety 
and insomnia' (6.9) followed by 'physical symptoms of depression' (6.2) and 
'depressive sentiment' (3.4). For the 'anxiety and insomnia' sub-scale, marital 
status shows another important correlation: unmarried elderly people had higher 
levels of stress. A lower educational level was associated with higher levels of 
anxiety and insomnia. Marital status appears to affect the manifestation of 
depressive symptoms as widows, singles and divorced showed a higher mean rate of 
depression than married people. [Table: see text] [Table: see text].
CONCLUSIONS: Various demographic as well as bio-psycho-social factors affecting 
health and particularly mental health are distributed unevenly between older men 
and women and between older people living in urban and rural areas. Therefore as 
our findings show, special care and priority should be granted to those who are 
single or widowed or divorced as they seem to be at greatest risk for overall 
declining mental health.

Technology, Cyprus.

BACKGROUND: The health sector should adopt integrated quality systems because of 
the need to survive and develop in a highly competitive environment. 
Inefficiency of mechanistic procedures, along with inadequate administrative 
infrastructure, impose innovative appoaches to improve operations and increase 
revenues by reducing quality feilures.
OBJECTIVE: A health system that relies on quality healthcare services can 
directly benefit the entire society, may reduce mortality, disease severity, and 
increase life expectancy. The following literature review constitutes an attempt 
to assess the contribution of healthcare professionals in issues that relate to 
quality management over the course of recent years.
METHODS: This systematic review took place between May 2019 and June 2020 in the 
databases PubMed, Cochrane Library, Wiley Online Library, Web of Science, Google 
Scholar and Scopus search engine databases. Study Selection and Data Extraction: 
This review includes articles written in English language, which contain 
quantitative and qualitative analysis of healthcare professionals' involvement 
in quality activities. Correspondingly, the exclusion criteria were: languages 
other than English, secondary surveys (general and systematic reviews or 
post-analyses), letters to the publisher, and editorials or articles that did 
not illuminate the subject under study. After an extensive literature review, a 
standardised Excel spreadsheet was developed for data extraction from the 
included studies. The main characteristics of the studies were recorded 
(author's name, place and time of work, the article under study and the 
methodology) so that all research articles corresponding to the review could be 
included. 31 articles were included.
RESULTS: Healthcare professionals are engaged in quality improvement activities 
and there is high association between quality management strategies and clinical 
processes. A systematic approach on healthcare activities based on the input of 
healthcare professionals can help increase business performance, reduce errors, 
improve patient safety, and contribute to a more proactive care.
CONCLUSION: Health professionals' contribution in the strategic planning of 
healthcare organisations that address quality activities can lead to better 
output, both in patient satisfaction and safety.

BACKGROUND: Pandemics greatly interfere with overall health care delivery as 
resources are diverted to combat the crisis. Kidney transplantation programs 
were closed temporarily during the COVID-19 pandemic. Given the critical 
shortage of organs, their short shelf life, and their overall importance to 
improving length and quality of life for those with kidney disease, this 
analysis examines the impact of discarding deceased donor organs.
METHODS: The net benefit (or harm) of discarding deceased donor organs was 
measured in projected life years from a societal and individual perspective 
using a Markov model. A wide range of infection rates, pandemic durations, and 
case fatality rates associated with infection in wait listed and transplant 
recipients were examined.
RESULTS: Overall, patient life expectancy fell for both wait listed and 
transplant recipients as the pandemic conditions became more unfavorable. 
However, the overall net benefit of a transplant during the pandemic was 
preserved. For example, prior to the pandemic, the net benefit of a kidney 
transplant over dialysis was calculated to be 6.25 life years (LYs) or 8.24 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) in a 40-year old recipient. This fell to 
5.86 LYs (7.78 QALYs) during the pandemic. Even assuming plausible but higher 
relative case fatality rates and risks of nosocomial and donor transmission in 
transplant recipients compared to wait listed patients, the net benefit remained 
>4 years for most deceased donor organs.
CONCLUSION: As long as hospitals have adequate resources to deal with the 
pandemic and can limit nosocomial infection, kidney transplantation should not 
be curtailed.

BACKGROUND: Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is a systemic autoinflammatory 
disease that causes recurrent attacks of fever, polyserositis, arthritis or skin 
eruptions, resulting in pain in the abdomen, muscles, joints and chest. All of 
these might lead to a reduction in exercise capacity, muscle strength, physical 
activity level (PAL) and quality of life (QoL). Therefore, assesment of these 
parameters are important. The aim of this study was to assess exercise capacity, 
muscle strength, PAL, and QoL in patients with FMF as compared to controls.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 40 subjects with FMF and 36 healthy control 
subjects participated in the study. The 6-minute walk test (6MWT) was used to 
assess exercise capacity. Muscle strength measurements for shoulder flexors, 
extensors and abductors, hip flexors, extensors and abductors, knee flexors and 
extensors, and ankle dorsiflexors were evaluated by hand-held dynamometer. PAL 
was assessed using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Short Form 
(IPAQ-SF). QoL was investigated by Nottingham Health Profile (NHP).
RESULTS: Significant differences were found between patients and healthy 
subjects for 6MWT (p = 0.003), muscle strength of ankle dorsiflexors (p = 
0.001), hip flexors (p = 0.047), extensors (p = 0.003) and abductors (p = 
0.004), total scores of IPAQ-SF (p = 0.004), and pain (p < 0.001), physical 
mobility (p < 0.001) and energy level (p = 0.026) subscales of NHP. However, 
there were no significant differences between groups for the shoulder flexion (p 
= 0.089), extension (p = 0.440) and abduction (p = 0.232), hand grip strength (p 
= 0.160) , and knee flexion (p = 0.744) and extension (p = 0.155) muscle 
strength and emotional reaction (p = 0.088), sleep (p = 0.070) and social 
isolation (p = 0.086) subsets of NHP.
CONCLUSION: Subjects with FMF demonstrated lower exercise capacity, muscle 
strength, PAL and QoL than healthy peers. Therefore, it is important to evaluate 
and improve these parameters in patients with FMF.

BACKGROUND: Climate change presents an increasing challenge for food-nutrition 
security. Nutrition metrics calculated from quantitative food system projections 
can help focus policy actions.
OBJECTIVES: To estimate future chronic and hidden hunger disability-adjusted 
life years (DALYs)-due to protein-energy undernutrition and micronutrient 
deficiencies, respectively-using food systems projections to evaluate the 
potential impact of climate change and agricultural sector investment for 
adaptation.
METHODS: We use a novel combination of a chronic and hidden hunger DALY 
estimation procedure and food system projections from quantitative foresight 
modeling to assess DALYs under alternative agricultural sector scenarios to 
midcentury.
RESULTS: Total chronic and hidden hunger DALYs are projected to increase 
globally out to 2050-by over 30 million compared with 2010-even without climate 
change. Climate change increases total DALY change between 2010 and 2050 by 
nearly 10% compared with no climate change. Agricultural sector investments show 
promise for offsetting these impacts. With investments, DALY incidence due to 
chronic and hidden hunger is projected to decrease globally in 2050 by 0.24 and 
0.56 per 1000 capita, respectively. Total global DALYs will still rise because 
projected population growth will outpace the rate reduction, especially in 
Africa south of the Sahara. However, projections also show important regional 
reductions in total DALYs due to chronic (13.9 million in South Asia, 4.3 
million in East Asia and the Pacific) and hidden hunger (7.5 million in East 
Asia and the Pacific) with investments.
CONCLUSIONS: Food system projections to 2050 show a decreasing DALY incidence 
from both chronic and hidden hunger. Population growth is projected to outpace 
these improvements and lead to increasing total chronic and hidden hunger DALYs 
globally, concentrated in Africa south of the Sahara. Climate change increases 
per-capita chronic and hidden hunger DALY incidence compared with no climate 
change. Agricultural sector investments show the potential to offset the climate 
impact on DALYs.

IMPORTANCE: Treatments for geographic atrophy (GA), a late stage of age-related 
macular degeneration (AMD), are currently under development. Understanding the 
natural course is needed for optimal trial design. Although enlargement rates of 
GA and visual acuity (VA) in the short term are known from clinical studies, 
knowledge of enlargement in the long term, life expectancy, and visual course is 
lacking.
OBJECTIVE: To determine long-term enlargement of GA.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this study, participant data were 
collected from 4 population-based cohort studies, with up to 25 years of 
follow-up and eye examinations at 5-year intervals: the Rotterdam Study cohorts 
1, 2, and 3 and the Blue Mountains Eye Study. Data were collected from 1990 to 
2015, and data were analyzed from January 2019 to November 2020.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Area of GA was measured pixel by pixel using all 
available imaging. Area enlargement and enlargement of the square 
root-transformed area, time until GA reached the central fovea, and time until 
death were assessed, and best-corrected VA, smoking status, macular lesions 
according to the Three Continent AMD Consortium classification, a modified 
version of the Wisconsin age-related maculopathy grading system, and AMD genetic 
variants were covariates in Spearman, Pearson, or Mann-Whitney analyses.
RESULTS: Of 171 included patients, 106 (62.0%) were female, and the mean (SD) 
age at inclusion was 82.6 (7.1) years. A total of 147 of 242 eyes with GA 
(60.7%) were newly diagnosed in our study. The mean area of GA at first 
presentation was 3.74 mm2 (95% CI, 3.11-4.67). Enlargement rate varied widely 
between persons (0.02 to 4.05 mm2 per year), with a mean of 1.09 mm2 per year 
(95% CI, 0.89-1.30). Stage of AMD in the other eye was correlated with GA 
enlargement (Spearman ρ = 0.34; P = .01). Foveal involvement was already present 
in incident GA in 55 of 147 eyes (37.4%); 23 of 42 eyes (55%) developed this 
after a mean (range) period of 5.6 (3-12) years, and foveal involvement did not 
develop before death in 11 of 42 eyes (26%). After first diagnosis, 121 of 171 
patients with GA (70.8%) died after a mean (SD) period of 6.4 (5.4) years. 
Visual function was visually impaired (less than 20/63) in 47 of 107 patients 
(43.9%) at last visit before death.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this study, enlargement of GA appeared to be 
highly variable in the general population. More than one-third of incident GA 
was foveal at first presentation; those with extrafoveal GA developed foveal GA 
after a mean of 5.6 years. Future intervention trials should focus on recruiting 
those patients who have a high chance of severe visual decline within their life 
expectancy.

Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) methylation is a pivotal process in the assembly and 
activity of ribosomes, which in turn play vital roles in the growth, development 
and stress responses of plants. Although few methyltransferases responsible for 
rRNA methylation have been identified in plant chloroplasts, the nature and 
function of these enzymes in chloroplasts remain largely unknown. In this study, 
we characterized ArabidopsisRsmD (At3g28460), an ortholog of the 
methyltransferase responsible for N2-methylguanosine (m2G) modification of 16S 
rRNA in Escherichia coli. Confocal microscopic analysis of an RsmD- green 
fluorescent protein fusion protein revealed that RsmD is localized to 
chloroplasts. Primer extension analysis indicated that RsmD is responsible for 
m2G methylation at position 915 in the 16S rRNA of Arabidopsis chloroplasts. 
Under cold stress, rsmd mutant plants exhibited retarded growth, i.e. had 
shorter roots, lower fresh weight and pale-green leaves, compared with wild-type 
(WT) plants. However, these phenotypes were not detected in response to drought 
or salt stress. Notably, the rsmd mutant was hypersensitive to erythromycin or 
lincomycin and accumulated fewer chloroplast proteins compared with the WT, 
suggesting that RsmD influences translation in chloroplasts. Complementation 
lines expressing RsmD in the rsmd mutant background recovered WT phenotypes. 
Importantly, RsmD harbored RNA methyltransferase activity. Collectively, the 
findings of this study indicate that RsmD is a chloroplast 16S rRNA 
methyltransferase responsible for m2G915 modification that plays a role in the 
adaptation of Arabidopsisto cold stress.

Modelling of anthropogenic induced climate suggests more frequent and severe 
heatwaves in the future, which are likely to result in the mass die-off of 
several species of organisms. Oxidative stress induced by severe heat stress has 
previously been associated with a reduction in animal cognitive performance, 
depressed reproduction and lower life expectancy. Little is known about the 
non-lethal consequences of species should they survive extreme heat exposure. We 
investigated the oxidative stress experienced by the Namaqua rock mouse, a 
nocturnal rodent, using two experimental heat stress protocols, a 6 hour acute 
heat stress protocol without access to water and a 3-day heatwave simulation 
with ad libitum water. Oxidative stress was determined in the liver, kidney and 
brain using malondialdehyde (MDA) and protein carbonyl (PC) as markers of 
oxidative damage, and superoxide dismutase (SOD) and total antioxidant capacity 
(TAC) as markers of antioxidant defence. Incubator heat stress (heat and 
dehydration stress) was brought about by increasing the body temperatures of 
animals to 39-40.8 °C for 6 hours. Following incubator heat stress, 
significantly higher levels of MDA were observed in the liver. Dehydration did 
not explain the variation in oxidative markers and is likely a combined effect 
of thermal and dehydration stress. Individual body mass was significantly 
negatively correlated to kidney SOD and lipid peroxidation. A heatwave was 
simulated using a temperature cycle that would naturally occur during a heatwave 
in the species' local habitat, with a maximal ambient temperature of 38 °C. 
Following the simulated heatwave, SOD activity of the kidney demonstrated 
significantly lowered activity suggesting oxidative stress. Current heat waves 
in this species have the potential of causing oxidative stress. Heat and 
dehydration stress following exacerbated temperatures are likely to incur 
significant oxidative stress in multiple tissues demonstrating the importance of 
water availability to allow for rehydration to prevent oxidative stress.

BACKGROUND: Deleterious long-term effects in the offspring from women with 
pregravid obesity have been described; however, the evidence supporting early 
metabolic and inflammatory markers in the offspring at birth and gender 
differences are conflicting.
OBJECTIVE: The present study aimed to compare cord blood adipokines and 
cytokines concentrations and anthropometric characteristics of the offspring of 
women with maternal obesity (MO) and normal-weight mothers (NWM). Also, maternal 
and neonatal variables on the association of maternal body mass index (BMI) with 
cord blood adipokines were evaluated.
METHODS: A cross-sectional analysis of a subsample of mother-child dyads 
participating in a cohort study (n = 221) was assessed. Anthropometrics, cord 
blood adipokines (leptin and adiponectin) and cytokines (interleukin [IL]-1β, 
IL-4, IL-10, IL-12 p40, IL-12p70, IL-13, and tumor necrosis factor α) 
concentrations in the offspring of normal-weight women (BMI >18.5 and 
<24.9 kg/m2) and women with pregravid obesity (BMI > 30 kg/m2) without 
comorbidities was performed.
RESULTS: Offspring from mothers with obesity had higher birth weight, a higher 
proportion of large for gestational age, higher ponderal index, and heavier 
placentae than offspring from normal-weight mothers (P < 0.05). Within the 
offspring from women with obesity, males had significantly higher weight, 
length, the proportion of large-for-gestational-age newborns, higher weight for 
length ratio. Males had more efficient placentas than females (P < 0.05). Higher 
adiponectin and leptin in both sexes and higher leptin in female offspring of 
mothers with obesity after adjusting for birth size (P < 0.05) were found. 
Higher IL-12p40 in the offspring of women with MO with no other differences in 
other cytokines among groups were evidenced.
CONCLUSIONS: Maternal obesity associates with a higher concentration of 
adiponectin and leptin in their offspring at birth. There is a relevant effect 
on anthropometrics in male offspring and on leptin in female newborn. Further 
studies need to evaluate the extension of these effects in postnatal life.

OBJECTIVE: To explore the application effect of a three-color ladder management 
system for knee osteoarthritis in the community.
METHODS: Eighty-six patients with knee osteoarthritis in our community were 
obtained for study and randomly grouped. The control group received routine 
management, while the research group received three-color ladder management for 
12 months. The knee joint function (WOMAC score), pain degree (VAS score), joint 
flexibility, health-related behavior score, self-care ability scale (exercise of 
self-care agency scale (ESCA) score), quality of life (knee osteoarthritis 
quality of life scale (AIMS2-SF) score) and knee replacement rate were compared 
between the two groups before and after management, and the changes of patients' 
visits and treatment costs before and after management were observed.
RESULTS: After 12 months, the scores of WOMAC and VAS in the research group were 
significantly lower than those of the control group (P<0.05), while the scores 
of joint flexibility and extension, cognition, behavior and condition of Omaha 
System health-related behaviors, ESCA and AIMS2-SF were significantly higher 
than those of the control group (P<0.05). After 12 months, the monthly visits 
and expenses of green cards, yellow cards and red cards in the research group 
were significantly lower than those before entering the group (P<0.05). After 12 
months, the knee replacement rate was 20.93% (9/43) in the research group, while 
it was 27.91% (12/43) in the control group, with no significant difference 
between the two groups (P>0.05).
CONCLUSION: The three-color ladder management system for knee osteoarthritis 
patients in the community can reduce the number of doctor visits and overall 
expenses, improve knee joint function, reduce pain, improve self-management 
ability and quality of life, and it has high community popularization.

Social insects are hosts of diverse parasites, but the influence of these 
parasites on phenotypic host traits is not yet well understood. Here, we tracked 
the survival of tapeworm-infected ant workers, their uninfected nest-mates and 
of ants from unparasitized colonies. Our multi-year study on the ant Temnothorax 
nylanderi, the intermediate host of the tapeworm Anomotaenia brevis, revealed a 
prolonged lifespan of infected workers compared with their uninfected peers. 
Intriguingly, their survival over 3 years did not differ from those of 
(uninfected) queens, whose lifespan can reach two decades. By contrast, 
uninfected workers from parasitized colonies suffered from increased mortality 
compared with uninfected workers from unparasitized colonies. Infected workers 
exhibited a metabolic rate and lipid content similar to young workers in this 
species, and they received more social care than uninfected workers and queens 
in their colonies. This increased attention could be mediated by their deviant 
chemical profile, which we determined to elicit more interest from uninfected 
nest-mates in a separate experiment. In conclusion, our study demonstrates an 
extreme lifespan extension in a social host following tapeworm infection, which 
appears to enable host workers to retain traits typical for young workers.

Global pandemic due to corona virus disease (COVID-19) has exposed 
vulnerabilities of the geriatric population all over the world. India has been 
adding progressively increasing number of elderly to its population. This is 
happening with increasing life expectancy and decreasing mortality. In 
comparison to children, the population as well as deaths in elderly are rising 
with changing demography. The elderly population has its own vulnerabilities 
based on education, socioeconomic condition, gender, place of residence etc. 
They are affected by various non-communicable diseases which form predominant 
cause of morbidity and mortality like cardiovascular diseases, stroke, cancer, 
respiratory illnesses etc. The elderly also contribute to various kinds of 
disabilities like movement, vision, hearing and in many cases multiple 
disabilities. They are also more vulnerable to mental health problems and
