Calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) represents a significant threat to 
cardiovascular health worldwide, and the incidence of this sclerocalcific valve 
disease has rapidly increased along with a rise in life expectancy. Compelling 
evidence has suggested that CAVD is an actively and finely regulated 
pathophysiological process even though it has been referred to as "degenerative" 
for decades. A striking similarity has been noted in the etiopathogenesis 
between CAVD and atherosclerosis, a classical proliferative sclerotic vascular 
disease.1 Nevertheless, pharmaceutical trials that attempted to target 
inflammation and dyslipidemia have produced disappointing results in CAVD. While 
senescence is a well-documented risk factor, the sophisticated regulatory 
networks have not been adequately explored underlying the aberrant calcification 
and osteogenesis in CAVD. Valvular endothelial cells (VECs), a type of resident 
effector cells in aortic leaflets, are crucial in maintaining valvular integrity 
and homeostasis, and dysfunctional VECs are a major contributor to disease 
initiation and progression. Accumulating evidence suggests that VECs undergo a 
phenotypic and functional transition to mesenchymal or fibroblast-like cells in 
CAVD, a process known as the endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT) 
process. The relevance of this transition in CAVD has recently drawn great 
interest due to its importance in both valve genesis at an embryonic stage and 
CAVD development at an adult stage. Hence EndMT might be a valuable diagnostic 
and therapeutic target for disease prevention and treatment. This mini-review 
summarized the relevant literature that delineates the EndMT process and the 
underlying regulatory networks involved in CAVD.

The current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic (COVID-19) is affecting elderly people worldwide 
with greater incidence and severity. In Spain, 68% of all coronavirus 
hospitalizations correspond to those over 60 years of age. This work aims to 
highlight the evidence about the measures to be implemented through current and 
future guidelines. The need to prepare for action by implementing international 
protocols stand out. There is a trend towards biopsychosocial care of elderly 
people in all settings where they are, adapting care and personalizing decisions 
on hospital admissions, palliative care, among other criteria, to years adjusted 
to quality of life, as well as alternatives for monitoring and treatment of 
COVID-19 pathology and others existing in this population group. Measures to 
reduce the transmission of the virus through hygiene and social distancing are 
necessary, attending to biopsychosocial health of the elderly isolated. 
Intersectoral communication is proposed as innovative alternatives, and the use 
of technological tools, accompanied by adequate digital health literacy. Future 
lines focus on guaranteeing social and health rights, equating the social and 
health system at the same level, and achieving real coordination. A new 
framework of person-centered care could be a great ally to achieve integrated 
care for the elderly, guided by an increase in resources bound to funding 
longevity research projects.

La pandemia actual por SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) afecta con mayor incidencia y 
gravedad a las personas mayores en todo el mundo. En España, el 68% del total de 
hospitalizaciones por coronavirus, corresponden a mayores de 60 años. Este 
trabajo tiene como objetivo incrementar la evidencia sobre las medidas a 
implementar con directrices actuales y futuras en diferentes escenarios. Destaca 
la necesidad de prepararnos para la acción mediante la implementación de 
protocolos de carácter internacional. Existe una tendencia hacia la atención 
biopsicosocial de las personas mayores en todos los entornos donde se 
encuentran, adecuando la atención y personalizando decisiones de ingresos 
hospitalarios, cuidados paliativos, atendiendo, entre otros criterios, a los 
años ajustados a la calidad de vida, así como alternativas para el monitoreo y 
tratamiento de la patología por COVID-19 y otras ya existentes. Son necesarias 
medidas de reducción de la transmisión del virus a través de la higiene y el 
distanciamiento, atendiendo a la salud biopsicosocial de los mayores aislados. 
Como alternativas innovadoras se propone la comunicación intersectorial, y el 
uso de herramientas tecnológicas, acompañado de una adecuada alfabetización 
digital en salud. Las líneas futuras se centran en garantizar los derechos 
sociales y sanitarios, equiparando al mismo nivel el sistema social y de salud, 
y consiguiendo una coordinación real. Un nuevo marco de atención centrada en la 
persona podría ser un gran aliado para conseguir una atención integrada a los 
mayores, guiada por un aumento de los recursos destinados a la financiación de 
proyectos de investigación sobre longevidad.

Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most frequent and aggressive primary tumor of the 
brain and averages a life expectancy in diagnosed patients of only 15 months. 
Hence, more effective therapies against this malignancy are urgently needed. 
Several diseases, including cancer, are featured by high levels of reactive 
oxygen species (ROS), which are possible GBM hallmarks to target or benefit 
from. Therefore, the covalent linkage of drugs to ROS-responsive molecules can 
be exploited aiming for a selective drug release within relevant pathological 
environments. In this work, we designed a new ROS-responsive prodrug by using 
Melphalan (MPH) covalently coupled with methoxy polyethylene glycol (mPEG) 
through a ROS-cleavable group thioketal (TK), demonstrating the capacity to 
self-assembly into nanosized micelles. Full chemical-physical characterization 
was conducted on the polymeric-prodrug and proper controls, along with in vitro 
cytotoxicity assayed on different GBM cell lines and "healthy" astrocyte cells 
confirming the absence of any cytotoxicity of the prodrug on healthy cells (i.e. 
astrocytes). These results were compared with the non-ROS responsive 
counterpart, underlining the anti-tumoral activity of ROS-responsive compared to 
the non-ROS-responsive prodrug on GBM cells expressing high levels of ROS. On 
the other hand, the combination treatment with this ROS-responsive prodrug and 
X-ray irradiation on human GBM cells resulted in an increase of the antitumoral 
effect, and this might be connected to radiotherapy. Hence, these results 
represent a starting point for a rationale design of innovative and tailored 
ROS-responsive prodrugs to be used in GBM therapy and in combination with 
radiotherapy.

BACKGROUND: There is growing interest in assessing psychological well-being in 
patients after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. It is unknown 
whether an assessment of psychological outcome in addition to tests of muscle 
function can facilitate decisions on return to sport (RTS). Therefore, the aim 
of this study was to evaluate passing rates in different physical RTS test 
batteries, with and without the inclusion of psychological outcome measures 
1 year after ACL reconstruction.
METHOD: In this cross-sectional cohort study a total of 320 patients (51% men) 
aged 18-65 years were included 1 year after ACL reconstruction. Passing rates on 
different muscle function (MF) test batteries (with results presented as Limb 
Symmetry Index (LSI)), consisting of knee extension and flexion strength tests, 
3 hop tests, and 2 psychological patient-reported outcomes (PROs); Quality of 
Life subscale from the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS QoL) 
and ACL Return to Sport after Injury (ACL-RSI), were evaluated 1 year after ACL 
reconstruction. Muscle function test batteries comprised: 2 MF tests (vertical 
hop and hop for distance; pass = 90% LSI); 2 MF tests and 2 PRO (pass = 90% LSI, 
62.5 points on KOOS QoL and 76.6 points on ACL-RSI), 5 MF tests (2 strength and 
3 hop tests, pass = 90% LSI), and 5 MF tests and 2 PRO (pass = 90% LSI, 62.5 
points on KOOS QoL and 76.6 points on ACL-RSI).
RESULTS: Passing rates in the different test batteries were 47% for 2 MF tests, 
19% for 2 MF tests and 2 PROs, 29% for 5 MF tests and 13% for 5 MF tests and 2 
PROs. The use of psychological PROs together with tests of muscle function gave 
the lowest passing rate (13%). There was a very strong correlation between 
passing 2 hop tests and 2 PROs and passing 5 MF tests (rφ = 0.41) as well as 
passing 5 MF tests and 2 PROs (rφ = 0.79).
CONCLUSION: The use of hop tests together with psychological PROs provides a 
clinician-friendly RTS test battery for assessment 1 year after ACL 
reconstruction as the passing rate was 19% when using 2 hop-tests combined with 
2 PROs, compared with 29% when using 5 tests of MF requiring advanced testing 
equipment.

BACKGROUND: Law enforcement officers have decreased life expectancy, attributed 
to work-related exposure to traumatic stress and circadian disruption. Autonomic 
dysregulation is reported with traumatic stress and chronic insomnia.
OBJECTIVE: We explore potential benefits for reduced symptoms related to stress 
and insomnia and improved autonomic function associated with open label use of 
high-resolution, relational, resonance-based, electroencephalic mirroring 
(HIRREM®), in a cohort of sworn law enforcement personnel.
METHODS: Closed-loop noninvasive therapies utilizing real-time monitoring offer 
a patient-centric approach for brain-based intervention. HIRREM® is a 
noninvasive, closed-loop, allostatic, neurotechnology that echoes specific brain 
frequencies in real time as audible tones to support self-optimization of brain 
rhythms. Self-report symptom inventories done before and after HIRREM included 
insomnia (ISI), depression (CES-D), traumatic stress (PCL-C), anxiety (GAD-7), 
perceived stress (PSS), and quality of life (EQ-5D). Ten-minute recordings of 
heart rate and blood pressure allowed analysis of baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) 
and heart rate variability (HRV).
RESULTS: Fifteen participants (1 female), mean (SD) age 45.7 (5.6), received 
12.2 (2.7) HIRREM sessions, over 7.9 in-office days. Data were collected at 
baseline, and at 22.8 (9.2), and 67.2 (14.1) days after intervention. All 
symptom inventories improved significantly (P < .01), with durability for 
2 months after completion of the intervention. The use of HIRREM was also 
associated with significant increases (P < .001) in HRV measured as rMSSD and 
BRS measured by high-frequency alpha index. There were no serious adverse events 
or drop outs.
CONCLUSION: These pilot data provide the first report of significant symptom 
reductions, and associated improvement in measures of autonomic cardiovascular 
regulation, with the use of HIRREM in a cohort of law enforcement personnel. 
Randomized clinical trials are warranted.

Sirtuin 1 (Sirt1) is a NAD+ dependent lysine deacetylase associated with the 
pathogenesis of various diseases including cancer. In many cancer types Sirt1 
expression is increased and higher levels have been associated with metastasis 
and poor prognosis. However, it was also shown, that Sirt1 can have tumor 
suppressing properties and in some instances even a dual role for the same 
cancer type has been reported. Increased Sirt1 activity has been linked to 
extension of the life span of cells, respectively, organisms by promoting DNA 
repair processes and downregulation of tumor suppressor proteins. This may have 
the downside of enhancing tumor growth and metastasis. In mice embryonic 
fibroblasts depletion of Sirt1 was shown to decrease levels of the DNA damage 
sensor histone H2AX. Impairment of DNA repair mechanisms by Sirt1 can promote 
tumorigenesis but also lower chemoresistance toward DNA targeting therapies. 
Despite many biological studies, there is currently just one small molecule 
Sirt1 inhibitor in clinical trials. Selisistat (EX-527) reached phase III 
clinical trials for treatment of Huntington's Disease. New small molecule Sirt1 
modulators are crucial for further investigation of the contradicting roles of 
Sirt1 in cancer. We tested a small library of commercially available compounds 
that were proposed by virtual screening and docking studies against Sirt1, 2 and 
3. A thienopyrimidone featuring a phenyl thiocyanate moiety was found to 
selectively inhibit Sirt1 with an IC50 of 13 μM. Structural analogs lacking the 
thiocyanate function did not show inhibition of Sirt1 revealing this group as 
key for the selectivity and affinity toward Sirt1. Further analogs with higher 
solubility were identified through iterative docking studies and in vitro 
testing. The most active compounds (down to 5 μM IC50) were further studied in 
cells. The ratio of phosphorylated γH2AX to unmodified H2AX is lower when Sirt1 
is depleted or inhibited. Our new Sirtuin 1 inhibiting thiocyanates (S1th) lead 
to similarly lowered γH2AX/H2AX ratios in mouse embryonic fibroblasts as Sirt1 
knockout and treatment with the reference inhibitor EX-527. In addition to that 
we were able to show antiproliferative activity, inhibition of migration and 
colony forming as well as hyperacetylation of Sirt1 targets p53 and H3 by the 
S1th in cervical cancer cells (HeLa). These results reveal thiocyanates as a 
promising new class of selective Sirt1 inhibitors.

AIM: Physical health inequalities experienced by people with mental health 
conditions are labelled an international scandal; due to the 15 to 30-year gap 
in life expectancy, driven mostly by physical health conditions. Lifestyle 
interventions are recommended to prevent the onset of poor physical health in 
people with mental illness. Yet, there is less high-quality evidence for 
adolescents, particularly those in inpatient settings. We aimed to assess 
existing literature reporting physical health or lifestyle interventions 
conducted on adolescent mental health inpatient units.
METHOD: An electronic search of MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Embase, the Cochrane Central 
Register of Controlled Trials and AMED was conducted on 13th June 2019. Eligible 
studies included peer-reviewed English language research articles of physical 
health interventions delivered within child and adolescent mental health 
inpatient services. A narrative synthesis was conducted on the data.
RESULTS: Only three studies were identified implementing health interventions 
for adolescent inpatients. The interventions consisted of two physical health 
interventions aiming to increase activity levels within routine care (one 
gym-based, one sports led) and a yoga intervention. Outcome measurements varied 
and benefits were observed in relation to overall health (HONOSCA), physical 
health (waist, hip and chest circumference) and behaviour.
CONCLUSIONS: Although preliminary results suggest lifestyle interventions may be 
feasible and beneficial for this group, more work is needed to fully understand 
the best way to implement these interventions within adolescent clinical 
settings. Adolescent inpatients are an important target for such interventions, 
affording the opportunity to prevent the onset of physical comorbidities.

Life emerging in an RNA world is expected to propagate RNA as hereditary 
information, requiring some form of primitive replication without enzymes. 
Non-enzymatic template-directed RNA primer extension is a model of the copying 
step in this posited form of replication. The sequence space accessed by primer 
extension dictates potential pathways to self-replication and, eventually, 
ribozymes. Which sequences can be accessed? What is the fidelity of the 
reaction? Does the recently illuminated mechanism of primer extension affect the 
distribution of sequences that can be copied? How do sequence features respond 
to experimental conditions and prebiotically relevant contexts? To help answer 
these and related questions, we here introduce a deep-sequencing methodology for 
studying RNA primer extension. We have designed and vetted special RNA 
constructs for this purpose, honed a protocol for sample preparation and 
developed custom software that analyzes sequencing data. We apply this new 
methodology to proof-of-concept controls, and demonstrate that it works as 
expected and reports on key features of the sequences accessed by primer 
extension.

Colitis is associated with the development of colorectal cancer (CRC) by largely 
undefined mechanisms that are critical for understanding the link between 
inflammation and cancer. Intestinal stem cells (ISCs) marked by leucine-rich 
repeat-containing G protein-coupled receptor 5 (LGR5) expression are of 
importance in both the inflammatory response to colitis and progression to 
colitis-associated colon cancer (CACC). Here, we report in human mucin 
1-transgenic (MUC1-transgenic) mouse models of CACC, targeting the MUC1-C 
oncogenic protein suppresses the (a) Lgr5+ ISC population, (b) induction of Myc 
and core pluripotency stem cell factors, and (c) severity and progression of 
colitis to dysplasia and cancer. By extension to human colon cancer cells, we 
demonstrate that MUC1-C drives MYC, forms a complex with MYC on the LGR5 
promoter, and activates LGR5 expression. We also show in CRC cells that MUC1-C 
induces cancer stem cell (CSC) markers (BMI1, ALDH1, FOXA1, LIN28B) and the 
OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG pluripotency factors. Consistent with conferring the CSC 
state, targeting MUC1-C suppresses the capacity of CRC cells to promote wound 
healing, invasion, self-renewal, and tumorigenicity. In analysis of human 
tissues, MUC1 expression associates with activation of inflammatory pathways, 
development of colitis, and aggressiveness of CRCs. These results collectively 
indicate that MUC1-C is of importance for integrating stemness and pluripotency 
in colitis and CRC. Of clinical relevance, the findings further indicate that 
MUC1-C represents a potentially previously unrecognized target that is druggable 
for treating progression of colitis and CRC.

The lung function laboratory frequently provides relevant information to the 
practice of pulmonology. Clinical interpretation of pulmonary function and 
exercise tests, however, has been complicated more recently by temporal changes 
in demographic characteristics (higher life expectancy), anthropometric 
attributes (increased obesity prevalence), and the surge of polypharmacy in a 
sedentary population with multiple chronic degenerative diseases. In this 
narrative review, we concisely discuss some key challenges to test 
interpretation that have been affected by these epidemiologic shifts: (a) the 
confounding effects of advanced age and severe obesity, (b) the contemporary 
controversies in the diagnosis of obstruction (including asthma and/or COPD), 
(c) the importance of considering the diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon 
monoxide (Dlco)/"accessible" alveolar volume (carbon monoxide transfer 
coefficient) in association with Dlco to uncover the causes of impaired gas 
exchange, and (d) the modern role of the pulmonary function laboratory 
(including cardiopulmonary exercise testing) in the investigation of 
undetermined dyspnea. Following a Bayesian perspective, we suggest 
interpretative algorithms that consider the pretest probability of abnormalities 
as indicated by additional clinical information. We, therefore, adopt a 
pragmatic approach to help the practicing pulmonologist to apply the information 
provided by the lung function laboratory to the care of individual patients.

Leiomyosarcomas are an uncommon malignant subset of tumors accounting for 
approximately 20% of soft tissue sarcomas. Primary vascular leiomyosarcomas 
(PVLs) are a rare subset of leiomyosarcomas that may originate in the arterial 
or venous circulation but most commonly affect the inferior vena cava (IVC). 
PVLs more commonly affect women to men in a 2:1 ratio and most frequently occur 
in the fourth to sixth decades of life. Few reports have described this 
infrequent pathologic state in the setting of advanced pregnancy. Presented is a 
case of a 44-year-old 30-week pregnant woman who presented with a PVL of the 
retrohepatic IVC, which was complicated by occlusion of the IVC and tumor 
thrombus extension into the hepatic veins and right atrium. Herein, we describe 
our multidisciplinary management of this rare problem with successful surgical 
resection of her tumor and IVC reconstruction.

Incidence of breast cancer increases with age up until age 80. Screening 
mammography has demonstrated efficacy in decreasing mortality from breast cancer 
among women between 50 and 74 years of age. However, most major organizations do 
not include women over 74 in their recommendations due to the lack of evidence 
in this age-group. This article will review current recommendations for breast 
cancer screening in women over the age of 74. It will also present clear 
guidelines for primary care clinicians to follow that incorporate shared 
decision-making techniques, tools for estimating the risks and benefits of 
screening mammography, and strategies for integrating a patient's life 
expectancy and comorbidities into the decision-making process. We also emphasize 
the importance of using thoughtful communication strategies to fully engage 
older women in the breast cancer screening discussion.

BACKGROUND: Endoscopic stenting has demonstrated value over emergent surgery as 
a palliative intervention for patients with acute large bowel obstruction due to 
advanced colorectal cancer. However, concerns regarding high reintervention 
rates and the risk of perforation have brought into question its 
cost-effectiveness.
METHODS: A decision tree analysis was performed to analyze costs and survival in 
patients with unresectable or metastatic colorectal cancer who present with 
acute large bowel obstruction. The model was designed with two treatment arms: 
self-expanding metallic stent (SEMS) placement and emergent surgery. Costs were 
derived from medicare reimbursement rates (US$), while effectiveness was 
represented by quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). The primary outcome measure 
was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). The model was tested for 
validation using one-way, two-way, and probabilistic sensitivity analyses.
RESULTS: Endoscopic stenting resulted in an average cost of $43,798.06 and 0.68 
QALYs. Emergent surgery cost $5865.30 more, while only yielding 0.58 QALYs. This 
resulted in an ICER of - $58,653.00, indicating that SEMS placement is the 
dominant strategy. One-way and two-way sensitivity analyses demonstrated that 
emergent surgery would require an improved survival rate in comparison to 
endoscopic stenting to become the favored treatment modality. In 100,000 
probabilistic simulations, endoscopic stenting was favored 96.3% of the time.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with acute colonic obstruction in the presence of 
unresectable or metastatic disease, endoscopic stenting is a more cost-effective 
palliative intervention than emergent surgery. This recommendation would favor 
surgery over SEMS placement with improved surgical survival, or if the majority 
of patients undergoing stenting required reintervention.

PURPOSE: This study aims to evaluate the performance of 18F-FDG PET for 
distinguishing the epileptogenic zone (EZ) from propagation and non-involved 
zones at brain area level, as defined using stereo-EEG (SEEG), in patients with 
pharmacoresistant epilepsy due to malformations of cortical development (MCD). 
Additionally, we seek to determine the relationship between 18F-FDG-PET data and 
post-surgical seizure outcome.
METHODS: Thirty-eight patients with MCD were explored with 18F-FDG PET and SEEG. 
We compared PET metabolism of each patient to a control population of healthy 
subjects. Based on MRI and SEEG, we separated 4 distinct zones at individual 
level: lesional, epileptogenic non-lesional, propagation, and non-involved. 
Then, we analysed (1) difference of PET metabolism within these four distinct 
zones; (2) performance of PET in defining the EZ within the SEEG-sampled areas; 
and (3) relation between extension of PET hypometabolism and post-surgical 
seizure outcome.
RESULTS: We found (1) a gradient of PET hypometabolism from non-involved to 
propagation, then to epileptogenic and lesional zones (p < 0.001); (2) good 
performance of PET in defining the EZ (AUC of ROC curve = 0.82); (3) poorer 
post-surgical prognosis associated with PET hypometabolism extension beyond SEEG 
sampling (p = 0.024).
CONCLUSION: 18F-FDG-PET has good accuracy in determining EZ in patients with MCD 
even if the hypometabolism is not limited to the EZ. Furthermore, hypometabolic 
extension is unfavourably associated with post-surgical prognosis.

BACKGROUND: Marfan syndrome (MFS) is a multi-systemic autosomal dominant disease 
of the connective tissue characterized by the early development of thoracic 
aneurysms/dissections, along with various manifestations of the ocular and 
skeletal systems. Due to the genetic and clinical heterogeneity, the clinical 
diagnosis of this disorder is challenging. Loss-of-function mutations in FBN1 
(encodes fibrillin-1) lead to MFS type 1. Also, similar mutations in 
transforming growth factor β receptor 2 (TGFBR2) gene cause MFS type 2. Both 
proteins involve in TGF-β signaling.
METHODS: In this study, genetic screening using a panel involving 14 genes, 
especially FBN1 and TGFBR2, were performed on seven representatives affected 
members of seven unrelated Iranian families suspected with MFS. To confirm the 
variants, Sanger sequencing was applied to other affected/unaffected members of 
the families.
RESULTS: A total of 13 patients showed MFS manifestations. Using genetic 
screening, two novel and three previously reported variants in FBN1 were 
identified. We also detected two variants (a novel and a previously reported 
variant) in the TGFBR2 gene.
CONCLUSION: In this study, we introduce three novel variants identified through 
gene screening in seven Iranian MFS families. This report is expected to 
considerably improve genetic counseling for Iranian MFS families. Early precise 
molecular diagnosis can be helpful for better management and improving the life 
expectancy of these patients.

Background: The World Health Organization (WHO) regions of Africa and South-East 
Asia are the epicentres of the global tuberculosis (TB) epidemic. This study 
aimed at examining the trend and determinants of TB case notifications in the 
two regions during 2000-2018.Methods: This was a retrospective analysis of 
yearly, new TB cases notified to the WHO. We obtained data on potential 
determinants for the 58 countries in the two regions during 2000-2018. 
Multivariable longitudinal fixed-effects regression analysis was used to 
quantify the association between the determinants and TB notifications.Results: 
During 2000-2018, TB notifications and incidence declined in Africa. In 
South-East Asia, case notifications increased while the incidence declined, on 
average, by 2% per year during the same period. After controlling for health, 
socioeconomic indicators, country and year fixed-effects, each 1% increase in 
the antiretroviral therapy (ART) coverage and the TB treatment success was 
associated with a decrease per 100,000 population in the TB case notification 
rate of -1.62 (95% CI: -4.93, -1.90; p = .037) and -0.91(95% CI: -1.54, -0.28; 
p = .005) respectively. Similarly, each 1-year increase in the life expectancy 
at birth resulted in a decrease in TB case notification rates of -6.64 (95% CI: 
-12.32, -0.95; p = .037). By contrast, a 1% increase in the unemployment rate 
resulted in an increase in TB notification rate of 3.49 cases (95% CI: 0.19, 
6.79; p = .039).Conclusion: Improving population health and the broad scale-up 
of ART coverage could complement existing TB treatment coverage and cure 
programmes to drive down new cases in Africa and South-East Asia.

University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR.

Sciences, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR.

Background: In Hong Kong, there have been significant changes in suicide rates 
during the period 1996-2015. Aim: We aimed to assess the impact of change in 
suicide rates on life expectancy in Hong Kong. Method: A decomposition method 
was used to quantify the impact of suicide on life expectancy in Hong Kong. 
Results: During 1996-2003, the increase in total suicide rate made negative 
contributions to the increase in life expectancy in Hong Kong (-0.15 years), 
with incidence component and age component accounting for -0.17 years and 0.02 
years, respectively. However, during 2003-2015, the decrease in the number of 
suicide deaths contributed to the life expectancy by 0.16 years, with the 
incidence component still playing a predominant role. Furthermore, the 
contribution mechanism of suicide varied across suicide methods and gender. 
Limitations: Apart from suicide, the change in life expectancy could be affected 
by various factors, which needs to be considered. Moreover, conclusions of the 
study were made at the population level rather than the individual level. 
Conclusion: Suicide has a non-negligible impact on life expectancy in Hong Kong. 
Understanding the contribution pattern of suicide and sustaining effective 
strategies for suicide intervention would contribute positively to improvements 
in Hong Kong life expectancy.

Physiological, Behavioral, and Life-History Adaptations to Environmental 
Fluctuations in the Edible Dormouse.

Ruf T(1), Bieber C(1).

Author information:
(1)Research Institute of Wildlife Ecology, Department of Interdisciplinary Life 
Sciences, University of Veterinary Medicine, Vienna, Austria.

The edible dormouse (Glis glis, formerly Myoxus glis) is a small arboreal mammal 
inhabiting deciduous forests in Europe. This rodent shows behavioral and 
physiological adaptations to three types of environmental fluctuations: (i) 
predictable seasonal variation in climate and food resources (ii) unpredictable 
year-to-year fluctuation in seed-production by trees and (iii) day-to-day 
variation in ambient temperature and precipitation. They cope with seasonally 
fluctuating conditions by seasonal fattening and hibernation. Dormice have 
adjusted to tree-mast fluctuations, i.e., pulsed resources, by sensing future 
seed availability in spring, and restricting reproduction to years with at least 
some seed production by beech and oak trees, which are a crucial food-resource 
for fast-growing juveniles in fall. Finally, dormice respond to short-term drops 
in ambient temperature by increased use of daily torpor as well as by huddling 
in groups of up to 24 conspecifics. These responses to environmental 
fluctuations strongly interact with each other: Dormice are much more prone to 
using daily torpor and huddling in non-reproductive years, because active gonads 
can counteract torpor and energy requirements for reproduction may prevent the 
sharing of food resources associated with huddling. Accordingly, foraging 
activity in fall is much more intense in reproductive mast years. Also, 
depending on their energy reserves, dormice may retreat to underground burrows 
in the summers of non-reproductive years, causing an extension of the 
hibernation season to up to 11.4 months. In addition to these interactions, 
responses to environmental fluctuations are modulated by the progression of 
life-history stages. With increasing age and diminishing chances of future 
reproduction, females reproduce with increasing frequency even under suboptimal 
environmental conditions. Simultaneously, older dormice shorten the hibernation 
season and phase-advance the emergence from hibernation in spring, apparently to 
occupy good breeding territories early, despite increased predation risk above 
ground. All of the above adaptions, i.e., huddling, torpor, hibernation, and 
reproduction skipping do not merely optimize energy-budgets but also help to 
balance individual predation risk against reproductive success, which adds 
another layer of complexity to the ability to make flexible adjustments in this 
species.

This study focuses on a safety evaluation method for underground gas storage. 
Gas storage is usually constructed underground in complex environments, and the 
service life of such facilities is limited. To ensure the secure and long-term 
operation of gas storage facilities, safety evaluation has become the focus of 
management. The present paper provides an effective method for safety 
evaluation. An index system was established as the foundation of the analysis 
for this evaluation, and the matter-element extension method was applied to 
obtain a quantitative evaluation result. For the weight values of each index in 
the matter-element extension method, this paper presents a comprehensive weight 
computation method based on vague sets and entropy. By application of this 
method, the safety level of a gas storage facility in the Jintan salt mines (in 
Jiangsu, China) was calculated, and the evaluation result was 4.6433, which 
meant the safety level was V and the underground gas storage was slightly at 
risk. It indicated that the influence on the overall safety and tightness of 
this gas storage could be ignored in the operation process, but the frequency of 
regular monitoring should be increased. The defective indexes were also 
obtained, such as salt rock cohesion, the roof thickness, the volume contraction 
ratio, the interlayer content, the height of the casing shoe and the adjacent 
cavity pressure difference, which need to be monitored and modified. This paper 
evaluated the safety of the underground gas storage from a unique perspective. 
It is expected that the results of this research will contribute to the 
maintenance and operational decisions, and provide a reference for management in 
the energy industry.

We present our experience following a unique case of coincident intracranial 
hemorrhage and comminuted fractures of both the squamous temporal bone and 
zygomaticofrontal orbit. Surgical techniques and outcome for this presentation 
have yet to be sufficiently described. A 55-year-old male presented following 
trauma with Glasgow Coma Scale score of 7. Radiographic evaluation revealed 
comminuted fractures of the squamous temporal bone with extension into the 
lateral orbit, along with zygomatic process fracture extending 2.5 cm medially 
into the orbital roof. Zygomaticofrontal orbital roof fragments reached 
superiorly into the middle cranial fossa and inferiorly into the orbit. Surgical 
intervention was deemed necessary to address underlying epidural hematoma, 
subarachnoid hemorrhage, correction of cranial bone defects, and decompression 
of the optic nerve and other intraorbital nerves. A frontotemporal approach was 
employed. Repair of temporal and orbital fractures was accomplished using a
