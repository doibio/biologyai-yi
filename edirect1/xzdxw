States, 2004-2018.

PROBLEM/CONDITION: Sickle cell disease (SCD), an inherited blood disorder 
affecting an estimated 100,000 persons in the United States, is associated with 
multiple complications and reduced life expectancy. Complications of SCD can 
include anemia, debilitating acute and chronic pain, infection, acute chest 
syndrome, stroke, and progressive organ damage, including decreased cognitive 
function and renal failure. Early diagnosis, screenings and preventive 
interventions, and access to specialist health care can decrease illness and 
death. Population-based public health surveillance is critical to understanding 
the course and outcomes of SCD as well as the health care use, unmet health care 
needs, and gaps in essential services of the population affected by SCD.
PERIOD COVERED: 2004-2018.
DESCRIPTION OF THE PROGRAM: In 2015, CDC established the Sickle Cell Data 
Collection (SCDC) program to characterize the epidemiology of SCD in two states 
(California and Georgia). Previously, surveillance for SCD was conducted by two 
short-term projects: Registry and Surveillance System for Hemoglobinopathies 
(RuSH), which was conducted during 2010-2012 and included 2004-2008 data, and 
Public Health Research, Epidemiology, and Surveillance for Hemoglobinopathies 
(PHRESH), which was conducted during 2012-2014 and included 2004-2008 data. Both 
California and Georgia participated in RuSH and PHRESH, which guided the 
development of the SCDC methods and case definitions. SCDC is a population-based 
tracking system that uses comprehensive data linkages in state health systems. 
These linkages serve to synthesize and disseminate population-based, 
longitudinal data for persons identified with SCD from multiple sources using 
selected International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical 
Modification, and Tenth Revision codes and laboratory results confirmed through 
state newborn screening (NBS) programs or clinic case reporting. Administrative 
and clinical data sources include state Medicaid and Children's Health Insurance 
Program databases, death certificates, NBS programs, hospital discharge and 
emergency department records, and clinical records or case reports. Data from 
multiple sources and years are linked and deduplicated so that states can 
analyze and report on SCD population prevalence, demographic characteristics, 
health care access and use, and health outcomes. The SCD case definition is 
based on an algorithm that classifies cases with laboratory confirmation as 
confirmed cases and those with a reported clinical diagnosis or three or more 
diagnostic codes over a 5-year period from an administrative data source as 
probable cases. In 2019, nine states (Alabama, California, Georgia, Indiana, 
Michigan, Minnesota, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia) were funded as 
part of an SCDC capacity-building initiative. The newly funded states developed 
strategies for SCD case identification and data linkage similar to those used by 
California and Georgia. As of 2021, the SCDC program had expanded to 11 states 
with the addition of Colorado and Wisconsin.
RESULTS: During 2004-2018, the cumulative prevalence of confirmed and probable 
SCD cases identified in California and Georgia was 9,875 and 14,777 cases, 
respectively. The 2018 annual prevalence count was 6,027 cases for California 
and 9,141 for Georgia. Examination of prevalence counts by contributing data 
source during 2014-2018 revealed that each data source captured 16%-71% of cases 
in California and 17%-87% in Georgia; therefore, no individual source is 
sufficient to estimate statewide population prevalence. The proportion of 
pediatric SCD patients (children aged 0-18 years) was 27% in California and 40% 
in Georgia. The percentage of females with SCD in California and Georgia was 58% 
and 57%, respectively. Of the cases with SCD genotyping data available (n = 
5,856), 63% of patients had sickle cell anemia. SCDC data have been used to 
directly apprise health care providers and policymakers about health care needs 
and gaps for patients with SCD. For example, an SCDC Georgia assessment 
indicated that 10% of babies born during 2004-2016 with SCD lived more than a 
1-hour drive from any SCD specialty care option, and another 14% lived within a 
1-hour drive of a periodic SCD specialty clinic only. Likewise, an SCDC 
California assessment indicated that during 2016-2018, most patients with SCD in 
Los Angeles County lived approximately 15-60 miles from hematologists 
experienced in SCD care. A surveillance capacity and performance assessment of 
all 11 SCDC states during 2020-2021 indicated that states differed in the 
availability of data sources used for SCD surveillance and the time frames for 
accessing each state data source. Nonetheless, methods for standardizing 
reporting were developed across all participating states.
INTERPRETATION: This report is the first comprehensive description of CDC's 
efforts in collaboration with participating states to establish, maintain, and 
expand SCD surveillance through the SCDC program to improve health outcomes for 
persons living with SCD. Findings from California and Georgia analyses 
highlighted a need for additional SCD specialty clinics. Despite different 
approaches, expansion of SCDC to multiple states was possible using 
standardized, rigorous methods developed across all participating states for 
reporting on disease prevalence, health care needs and use, and deaths.
PUBLIC HEALTH ACTION: Findings from surveillance can be used to improve and 
monitor care and outcomes for persons with SCD. These and other SCDC analyses 
have had a role in opening new SCD clinics, educating health care providers, 
developing state health care policies, and guiding new research initiatives. 
Public health officials can use this report as a guiding framework to plan or 
implement surveillance programs for persons with SCD. Both data-related 
activities (data sources; patient identifiers; and obtaining, transferring, and 
linking data) and the administrative considerations (stakeholder engagement, 
costs and resources, and long-term sustainability) are crucial to the success of 
these programs.

PURPOSE: When deliberating palliative cancer treatment, insight into patients' 
attitudes toward striving for quality of life (QL) and length of life (LL) may 
facilitate goal-concordant care. We investigated the (1) attitudes of patients 
with advanced cancer toward striving for QL and/or LL and whether these change 
over time, and (2) characteristics associated with these attitudes (over time).
METHODS: We performed a secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial on 
improving shared decision making (SDM), without differentiation between 
intervention arms. Patients (n = 173) with advanced cancer, a median life 
expectancy of < 12 months without anticancer treatment, and a median survival 
benefit of < 6 months from systemic therapy were included in seven Dutch 
hospitals. We used audio-recorded consultations and surveys at baseline (T0), 
shortly after the consultation (T2), at 3 and 6 months (T3 and T4). Primary 
outcomes were patients' attitudes toward striving for QL and LL (Quality 
Quantity Questionnaire; T2, T3, and T4).
RESULTS: Overall, patients' attitudes toward striving for QL became less 
positive over 6 months (P < .01); attitudes toward striving for LL did not 
change on group level. Studying individual patients, 76% showed changes in their 
attitudes toward striving for QL and/or LL at some point during the study, which 
occurred in various directions. More helplessness/hopelessness (P < .001), less 
fighting spirit (P < .05), less state anxiety (P < .001), and more observed SDM 
(P < .05) related to more positive attitudes toward striving for QL. Lower 
education, less helplessness/hopelessness, more fighting spirit, and more state 
anxiety (P < .001) related to more positive attitudes toward striving for LL.
CONCLUSION: Oncologists may explore patients' attitudes toward striving for QL 
and LL repeatedly and address patients' coping style and emotions during SDM to 
facilitate goal-concordant care throughout the last phase of life.

AIMS: The aims of this study were to quantify the burden, and the cost of health 
loss, following hospitalisation for major trauma in New Zealand.
METHOD: Hospitalised major trauma patients injured between July 2017 and June 
2020 were extracted from the New Zealand Trauma Registry. Case-mix of major 
trauma in each year was summarised using descriptive statistics. 
Disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) were calculated for the cohort. A cost 
per DALY was applied to estimate the cost of health loss.
RESULTS: A total of 6,629 major trauma cases were recorded, rising from 2,072 in 
2017-2018 to 2,191 in 2019-2020. The patient case-mix remained relatively 
consistent over the timeframe while the in-hospital mortality rate declined from 
9.2% to 7.3%. Hospitalised major trauma patients accrued 22,718 DALYs (average 
7,573 DALYs per year) at an estimated health loss cost of $1.02 billion ($341 
million per year). The cost of health loss per case declined from $162,747 in 
2017-2018 to $143,577 in 2019-2020.
CONCLUSION: The burden of major trauma is high. As injury is a preventable 
condition, the findings highlight the need for dedicated investment in both 
primary prevention and trauma care in New Zealand to reduce these avoidable 
costs.

BACKGROUND: The use of opioids is increasing globally, but data from low- and 
middle-income countries on opioid-related mental and behavioural disorders 
(hereafter referred to as opioid-related disorders) are scarce. This study 
examines the incidence of opioid-related disorders, opioid agonist use, and 
excess mortality among persons with opioid-related disorders in South Africa's 
private healthcare sector.
METHODS: We analysed longitudinal data of beneficiaries (≥ 11 years) of a South 
African medical insurance scheme using reimbursement claims from Jan 1, 2011, to 
Jul 1, 2020. Beneficiaries were classified as having an opioid-related disorder 
if they received an opioid agonist (buprenorphine or methadone) or an ICD-10 
diagnosis for harmful opioid use (F11.1), opioid dependence or withdrawal 
(F11.2-4), or an unspecified or other opioid-related disorder (F11.0, F11.5-9). 
We calculated adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) for factors associated with 
opioid-related disorders, estimated the cumulative incidence of opioid agonist 
use after receiving an ICD-10 diagnosis for opioid dependence or withdrawal, and 
examined excess mortality among beneficiaries with opioid-related disorders.
RESULTS: Of 1,251,458 beneficiaries, 1286 (0.1%) had opioid-related disorders. 
Between 2011 and 2020, the incidence of opioid-related disorders increased by 
12% (95% CI 9%-15%) per year. Men, young adults in their twenties, and 
beneficiaries with co-morbid mental health or other substance use disorders were 
at increased risk of opioid-related disorders. The cumulative incidence of 
opioid agonist use among beneficiaries who received an ICD-10 diagnosis for 
opioid dependence or withdrawal was 18.0% (95% CI 14.0-22.4) 3 years after 
diagnosis. After adjusting for age, sex, year, medical insurance coverage, and 
population group, opioid-related disorders were associated with an increased 
risk of mortality (aHR 2.28, 95% CI 1.84-2.82). Opioid-related disorders were 
associated with a 7.8-year shorter life expectancy.
CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of people diagnosed with or treated for an 
opioid-related disorder in the private sector is increasing rapidly. People with 
opioid-related disorders are a vulnerable population with substantial 
psychiatric comorbidity who often die prematurely. Evidence-based management of 
opioid-related disorders is urgently needed to improve the health outcomes of 
people with opioid-related disorders.

Fabry disease (FD) is a rare, progressive, X-linked inherited disorder of 
glycosphingolipid metabolism. It is a monogenic disease due to α-galactosidase A 
(α-GAL) enzyme deficiency, leading to the accumulation of globotriaosylceramide 
(GL3) within lysosomes beginning in utero. Multiple systems are involved, most 
notably the vascular, renal, cardiac, and nervous systems. Early clinical 
manifestations include neuropathic pain, angiokeratomas, anhidrosis, cornea 
verticillata, and gastrointestinal symptoms. In the later stages, FD manifests 
with transient ischemic attacks, strokes, hearing loss, and life-threatening 
complications involving the kidneys and heart. Cardiac involvement in Fabry 
disease is typically characterized by increased left ventricular wall 
thickness/mass, functional abnormalities, valvular heart disease, arrhythmias, 
and heart failure. The life expectancy of the patient with untreated Fabry 
disease falls significantly once cardiac or renal manifestations develop. This 
review will focus on the cardiac manifestations of FD and the role of 
multimodality imaging in diagnosis and follow-up.

The world population's life expectancy is growing, and neurodegenerative 
disorders common in old age require more efficient therapies. In this context, 
neural stem cells (NSCs) are imperative for the development and maintenance of 
the functioning of the nervous system and have broad therapeutic applicability 
for neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore, knowing all the mechanisms that 
govern the self-renewal, differentiation, and cell signaling of NSC is 
necessary. This review will address some of these aspects, including the role of 
growth and transcription factors, epigenetic modulators, microRNAs, and 
extracellular matrix components. Furthermore, differentiation and 
transdifferentiation processes will be addressed as therapeutic strategies 
showing their significance for stem cell-based therapy.

BACKGROUND: Malignant pleural effusion (MPE) is a common complication in 
patients with advanced lung cancer that can severely compromise the quality of 
life and limit life expectancy. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have shown 
that Chinese herbal injections (CHIs) may be beneficial in improving quality of 
life. This network meta-analysis (NMA) aims to explore several CHIs used for 
lung cancer patients with MPE.
METHODS: Seven databases were systematically searched for eligible RCTs from 
inception to November 2021. The primary outcome was the clinical effective rate. 
Secondary outcomes were the improvement rate of Karnofsky performance status 
(KPS) score and incidence of adverse events (AEs). The Cochrane risk of bias 2 
tool was used to assess the quality of included studies. Data analysis was 
performed using STATA 16.0 and R software 4.1.0. Both pairwise meta-analysis and 
Bayesian NMA were conducted. Competing interventions were ranked using the 
surface under the cumulative ranking (SUCRA) probabilities. Evidence grading was 
evaluated using the Confidence in Network Meta-Analysis online software 
(https://cinema.ispm.unibe.ch/).
RESULTS: A total of 44 studies involving 2,573 patients were included. The 
combined Huachansu injection (HCS) with intrapleural cisplatin 
(cis-diamminedichloro-platinum, DDP) had the highest probability of improving 
the clinical effective rate (SUCRA, 84.33%). The Kangai injection (KA) combined 
with DDP had the most improvement rate of KPS score (SUCRA, 80.82%), while the 
Fufangkushen injection (FFKS) alone was more likely to reduce AEs including 
gastrointestinal reactions (SUCRA, 89.92%), leukopenia (SUCRA, 91.85%), and 
chest pain (SUCRA, 98.17%). FFKS combined with DDP ranked the best in reducing 
the incidence of fever (SUCRA, 75.45%).
CONCLUSIONS: Our NMA showed that CHIs alone or combined with DDP could improve 
clinical effectiveness and quality of life and reduce AEs, compared to DDP 
alone. HSC and KA, combined with DDP, may be the most effective considering 
clinical effective rate and improvement of KPS score, respectively. FFKS, either 
used alone or in combination therapy with DDP, may be the best in reducing AEs. 
However, high-quality RCTs with larger sample sizes are needed to further 
support the evidence.

In order to guide and meet people's health needs, various resources are flowing 
to the health sector, and the regional health economy is bound to develop 
rapidly, which increases the possibility of integrating and developing the 
sports economy and health industry in the context of the public health sector. 
As the health of the population improves, life expectancy increases, science and 
technology develops, and lifestyles change, the health economy sector is 
becoming increasingly active and both sport and healthcare will contribute to 
the development of the regional health economy. Big data, as a new management 
mindset and technical tool, brings new opportunities and challenges to the 
integrated development of sports economy and health industry. Based on the basic 
characteristics of big data, this paper provides a strategy for the development 
of the sports and health integration industry by using research methods such as 
grey correlation analysis, expert interviews, and agglomeration measures, 
starting from the problems faced by the integration development of China's 
sports industry to guarantee the construction of conditions. The experiment is 
analysed through the big data presentation of the health industry and the big 
data modelling ideas of grey correlation analysis, which provides new ideas to 
expand the application research of grey correlation analysis in the field of 
integration development.

Investing in the health of women and girls has been shown to produce good 
returns not only for women and girls, but also for the society as a whole. It 
yields high returns on investment through improved productivity, reduced 
absenteeism, and reduced health care costs. Over the past decades the terms 
women's health and reproductive health were used interchangeably to refer to 
conditions related to pre-conception, pregnancy, childbirth, and postnatal care 
only. However, with the improvement in life expectancy, reduction in maternal 
mortality ratios and the constant reduction in fertility rates, women now enjoy 
more years and are exposed to risk factors and diseases that are not always 
related to the reproductive function. Women in the post-menopausal period 
undergo physiological and psychological changes that may cause discomfort or 
change their response to several risk factors, and some diseases may present 
differently in women than in men. With this in mind, and in an attempt to better 
understand and respond to women's comprehensive health needs, the WHO Office for 
the Eastern Mediterranean Region (WHO/EMRO) launched a programme on women's 
health to generate and analyze evidence related to women's overall health beyond 
the reproductive component and propose relevant solutions. We need to act now to 
ensure that health services for women are available, acceptable, and accessible, 
to ensure that women's health needs are well-covered in the hope of achieving 
Universal Health Coverage by 2030.

Determining the age of any species allows it to be analyzed from the 
ontogenetic, demographic, and ecological perspectives. In the present study, we 
tested the hypothesis that the age structure of congener species (Lacerta media 
and Lacerta viridis) with the same ecological niche may vary in different areas. 
In this context, we applied skeletochronology method to reveal various 
demographic parameters, such as age structure, longevity, age at sexual 
maturity, growth rate, survival rate, adult life expectancy, and the 
relationship between age and body size in the green lizard, L. viridis, and the 
medium lizard, L. media. In L. media and L. viridis, the maximum lifespan was 10 
and 8 years, respectively. The mean age and body size of females were 
significantly greater than those of males in L. media. However, in the examined 
L. viridis population, no appreciable variation in mean age or body size was 
found to exist between the sexes. It was estimated that the green lizards reach 
maturity at the age of 2 or 3 years. However, the L. media reached sexual 
maturity approximately 1 year later than the congener. The body size markedly 
increased with age in males for both studied populations. However, in females, 
body size positively increased with age only in L. media. The approach of 
skeletochronology that we utilized in this study to assess age structure makes 
it simple to gather a variety of time-dependent ecological data for such 
ectothermic species.

BACKGROUND: This study investigated the ability of patients, naïve to adalimumab 
treatment and self-injection with an autoinjector (AI), to successfully 
self-administer AVT02, an adalimumab biosimilar, using a custom, ergonomic AI 
(Alvotech hf., Reykjavik, Iceland).
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a single-arm, open-label study, consisting 
of an 8-week active period and 48-week extension phase. Patients with moderate 
to severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA) self-administered 40 mg AVT02 subcutaneously 
via AI in the active period, followed by prefilled syringe in the extension 
phase. The primary endpoint was the percentage of successful self-injections up 
to Week 8. Usability and robustness of the AI were evaluated in the active 
period; safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetic and immunogenicity data were assessed 
throughout the study.
RESULTS: The AI success rate was 100%. No handling events were noted up to Week 
8. Both Ctrough measurements and immunogenicity profile were in line with 
expectations from previous studies, with no unexpected safety signals.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that AVT02-AI can be successfully and 
reliably used for repeated self-injections of AVT02 by moderate to severe RA 
patients, despite no previous experience of adalimumab self-administration. The 
extension phase provides long-term efficacy and safety data for AVT02 in RA.

INTRODUCTION: Global clinical trials in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) often do not 
recruit enough patients from diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds to identify 
any potential differences in treatment outcome across such groups. To overcome 
this limitation, using data from five previous clinical trials and two ongoing 
trial extensions, this study aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of 
filgotinib in patients with RA across geographic regions.
METHODS: This was a post hoc, exploratory analysis of data from male and female 
patients with RA meeting the 2010 RA criteria as defined by the American College 
of Rheumatology (ACR) and European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology. 
Data were analyzed from phase 2 (DARWIN 1-2) and phase 3 (FINCH 1-3) clinical 
trials, as well as two long-term extension studies (DARWIN 3, FINCH 4), of 
filgotinib. Efficacy endpoints included ACR 20%/50%/70% improvement 
(ACR20/50/70) responses, disease activity score in 28 joints using C-reactive 
protein [DAS28(CRP)], Clinical Disease Activity Index scores, Boolean remission, 
and change from baseline in Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index 
(HAQ-DI). Safety data were presented as exposure-adjusted incidence rates per 
100 patient-years of exposure of treatment-emergent adverse events.
RESULTS: Compared with placebo, at week 12 a greater proportion of patients 
receiving filgotinib 200 mg (FIL200) or 100 mg (FIL100) achieved ACR20 
(p < 0.01), with similar outcomes in most regions. Overall, the reduction in 
HAQ-DI with FIL200 or FIL100 was greater than with placebo (p < 0.05) at week 
12. Compared with placebo, at week 24 the proportions of patients achieving 
DAS28(CRP) ≤ 3.2 were greater for both doses of FIL, as seen in most regions 
(p < 0.01). Safety outcomes did not indicate regional or ethnic differences in 
the safety profile of filgotinib.
CONCLUSION: Filgotinib efficacy and safety in patients with RA were generally 
consistent across geographic regions.
GOV TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBERS: NCT02889796; NCT02873936; NCT02886728;

Plain Language Summary: Clinical trials in rheumatoid arthritis recruit too few 
patients from diverse ethnic backgrounds to be able to identify differences in 
treatment outcomes. In adults with moderate-to-severe active rheumatoid 
arthritis who do not tolerate or have responded poorly to other advanced 
treatments, the Janus kinase inhibitor filgotinib can be used alone or in 
combination with the immunosuppressant methotrexate. Using data from 4695 
patients with rheumatoid arthritis from five previous clinical trials and two 
ongoing trial extensions, this paper examined the efficacy and safety of 
filgotinib in patients with rheumatoid arthritis across geographic locations 
worldwide.Patients were grouped by region: North America, South and Central 
America, Western Europe, Eastern Europe, East Asia, South and Southeast Asia, 
and Other (South Africa, New Zealand, Australia, and Israel). The efficacy of 
filgotinib in treating the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis was assessed using 
several measures of disease activity, with changes in patient quality of life 
determined using a health assessment questionnaire. Safety data were reported as 
the rates of side effects experienced by patients.Across different geographic 
regions, no major differences in filgotinib treatment response were observed. 
Rheumatoid arthritis disease activity levels were consistently lower in patients 
receiving filgotinib than in patients receiving placebo. Across the regions 
examined, quality-of-life scores also improved to a greater degree in patients 
receiving filgotinib compared with placebo. The rates of side effects, including 
infections, were similar irrespective of region. The number of deaths was low, 
mostly resulting from cardiovascular events, infections, and malignancies.This 
study demonstrates that the efficacy and safety of filgotinib are consistent in 
patients with rheumatoid arthritis from a broad range of geographic regions and 
ethnic backgrounds.

In the past two decades, most high-income countries have reduced their hospital 
bed capacity. This could be a sign of increased efficiency but could also 
reflect a degradation in quality of care. In this paper, we use repeated 
cross-sections on mortality and staffed hospital beds per capita in all 21 
Swedish regions to estimate the potential death toll from reduced bed capacity. 
Between 2001 and 2019, mortality and beds decreased across all regions, but 
regions making smaller bed reductions experienced on average greater decreases 
in mortality, equivalent to one less death per three beds retained. This 
estimate is stable to a wide range of specifications and to adjustment for 
potential confounders, which supports a causal interpretation. Our results imply 
that by providing one more bed, Swedish health care could produce about three 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) at a cost of SEK 400,000 (∼US$40,000) per 
QALY. These findings could be informative about the marginal productivity of 
health care and support the credibility of empirical work attempting to estimate 
the opportunity cost of funding new healthcare interventions subject to a 
constrained budget.

BACKGROUND: Using balanced placebo designs, seminal alcohol administration 
research has shown individuals' beliefs about whether they have consumed 
alcohol, irrespective of the actual presence of alcohol, can determine level of 
alcohol consumption and impact social behavior. Despite the known effect of 
expecting alcohol on drinking behavior, few studies have used the placebo 
manipulation to directly investigate the neural underpinnings of the 
expectancy-related effects that occur following perceived alcohol consumption in 
humans. The present paper examined placebo responses in the laboratory to better 
understand the neural basis for the psychological phenomenon of expectancies.
METHODS: As part of a larger within-subjects study design, healthy young adults 
(N = 22, agemean+SD=23 +1) completed resting state fMRI scans and measures of 
subjective response before and after consuming placebo beverages. Effect of 
placebo beverage consumption (pre- versus post-beverage consumption) on 
functional connectivity within prefrontal cortical networks was examined using 
the CONN Toolbox. Relations between perceived subjective response to alcohol 
with functional connectivity response following placebo beverage consumption 
were examined.
RESULTS: Compared to pre-beverage scan, placebo beverage consumption was 
associated with increased positive functional connectivity between right nucleus 
accumbens - ventromedial prefrontal cortex and subcallosal cingulate cortex 
(pFDR<0.05). Subjective ratings of intoxication (i.e., feeling 'drunk') 
positively correlated with placebo beverage-related increases in nucleus 
accumbens - subcallosal cingulate cortex functional connectivity.
CONCLUSION: Results suggest placebo response to alcohol is associated with 
increased functional connectivity within a key reward network (nucleus accumbens 
- ventromedial prefrontal cortex and subcallosal cingulate cortex) and put forth 
a mechanism by which alcohol expectancies may contribute to the subjective 
experience of intoxication.

OBJECTIVES: Heart failure is a worldwide health problem and is the leading cause 
of hospitalization in older patients. Heart failure with preserved ejection 
fraction (HFpEF) accounts for about 38% of heart failure cases. The latest 
EMPEROR-Preserved study shows that empagliflozin can reduce the risk of 
hospitalization in HFpEF, but whether empagliflozin is cost-effective in HFpEF 
in a Chinese setting remained uninvestigated.
METHODS: A simulation of lifetime horizon for a 72-year-old HFpEF patient was 
conducted using a Markov model. The primary outcome was incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), expressed as incremental costs per 
quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). Three times the per capita GDP of China was 
set as the willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold. Empagliflozin was considered 
cost-effective if the ICER was below the WTP threshold, otherwise it would be 
regarded as not cost-effective. One-way sensitivity and probabilistic 
sensitivity analysis (PSA) were used to assess uncertainty.
RESULTS: After a simulation of lifetime horizon, a 72-year-old HFpEF patient is 
expected to have an expected QALY of 4.80 in the empagliflozin group, and 4.67 
QALY with standard treatment. The costs of empagliflozin and standard treatment 
are 34,987 (US$5423) and 27,027 (US$4189) Chinese Yuan (CNY), respectively, with 
an ICER of 63,746 (US$9881)/QALY, lower than the WTP threshold. One-way 
sensitivity and PSA show that our results are robust.
CONCLUSION: In Chinese HFpEF patients, adding empagliflozin to standard 
treatment is cost-effective, but studies based on real-world data are needed.

BACKGROUND: Polygenic risk scores (PRS), which offer information about genomic 
risk for common diseases, have been proposed for clinical implementation. The 
ways in which PRS information may influence a patient's health trajectory depend 
on how both the patient and their primary care provider (PCP) interpret and act 
on PRS information. We aimed to probe patient and PCP responses to PRS clinical 
reporting choices METHODS: Qualitative semi-structured interviews of both 
patients (N=25) and PCPs (N=21) exploring responses to mock PRS clinical reports 
of two different designs: binary and continuous representations of PRS.
RESULTS: Many patients did not understand the numbers representing risk, with 
high numeracy patients being the exception. However, all the patients still 
understood a key takeaway that they should ask their PCP about actions to lower 
their disease risk. PCPs described a diverse range of heuristics they would use 
to interpret and act on PRS information. Three separate use cases for PRS 
emerged: to aid in gray-area clinical decision-making, to encourage patients to 
do what PCPs think patients should be doing anyway (such as exercising 
regularly), and to identify previously unrecognized high-risk patients. PCPs 
indicated that receiving "below average risk" information could be both 
beneficial and potentially harmful, depending on the use case. For "increased 
risk" patients, PCPs were favorable towards integrating PRS information into 
their practice, though some would only act in the presence of evidence-based 
guidelines. PCPs describe the report as more than a way to convey information, 
viewing it as something to structure the whole interaction with the patient. 
Both patients and PCPs preferred the continuous over the binary representation 
of PRS (23/25 and 17/21, respectively). We offer recommendations for the 
developers of PRS to consider for PRS clinical report design in the light of 
these patient and PCP viewpoints.
CONCLUSIONS: PCPs saw PRS information as a natural extension of their current 
practice. The most pressing gap for PRS implementation is evidence for clinical 
utility. Careful clinical report design can help ensure that benefits are 
realized and harms are minimized.
