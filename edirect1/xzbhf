The inclusion of household production and caring costs increased the total cost 
to €945.7 million.
CONCLUSION: Lost productivity costs due to cancer-related premature mortality 
are significant. The higher premature mortality cost in males than females 
reflects higher wages and rates of workforce participation. Productivity costs 
provide an alternative perspective on the cancer burden on society and may 
inform cancer control policy decisions.

Changes in fatigue and physical function following laparoscopic colonic surgery.

Jensen MB, Nørager CB, Sommer T, Madsen MR, Laurberg S.

The aim of the study was to describe changes in postoperative fatigue, quality 
of life, physical performance, and body composition in patients undergoing 
laparoscopic colonic cancer surgery.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: In a follow-up study from 2009-2011 at two regional 
hospitals in Denmark we examined 62 patients having a right hemicolectomy ora 
sigmoid resection performed. The main outcome measures were fatigue level 
subjectively scored from 1 ("fit") to 10 ("fatigued") on a modified visual 
analogue scale and by objective measurements of hand grip and knee extension 
strength, work capacity, weight, and lean body mass. Quality of life was 
assessed using the SF-36 questionnaire and pain using an ordinal scale. Patients 
were examined preoperatively, 1-2 and 4 weeks postoperatively.
RESULTS: Eight patients (13%) were converted to open surgery and the median 
bleeding (95% confidence interval of the median) was 75 (50-100) ml. One to two 
weeks after surgery the fatigue level and pain when moving had increased 
significantly (p=0.0011 and p=0.0002 respectively) and the SF-36 physical 
component quality of life score decreased (p<0.0001) when compared to 
preoperatively. However, at 4 weeks postoperatively fatigue level, pain, and 
quality of life scores were at the preoperative level. There were no significant 
changes from preoperatively to postoperatively in any of the measures of 
physical performance, whereas there was a slight reduction in weight and lean 
body mass after the operation. CONCLUSIONS. Laparoscopic colonic cancer surgery 
was associated with a short lasting increased fatigue and pain and reduced 
quality of life, but no significant reduction in physical performance after 
surgery.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Achieving functioning vascular access in hemodialysis 
patients remains challenging. Current guidelines recommend creating 
arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) as the initial form of vascular access and are 
primarily based on outdated, observational data. Determining the optimal access 
for each individual patient is, therefore, of great interest.
RECENT FINDINGS: Multiple recent studies suggest that certain subgroups of 
patients may benefit from alternative forms of vascular access. In particular, 
the elderly and patients with limited life-expectancy may be less likely to 
benefit from an AVF first approach. These patients may be more likely to die 
before benefiting from an AVF and are more likely to experience primary failure 
of an AVF. If these factors are considered, arteriovenous grafts, and in some 
cases central venous catheters, become a valid alternative form of vascular 
access. Patients may also have strong opinions about each type of vascular 
access, leading to a preference for alternative forms of access.
SUMMARY: A patient-centered approach to the choice of dialysis access that 
incorporates a balance between recent evidence from the literature and patient 
preferences may be preferred to the current fistula first focus in vascular 
access choice.

Research suggests that persons with multiple sclerosis (MS) are much less 
physically active than the general population and that increased physical 
activity in persons with MS is associated with numerous benefits such as 
improvements in fatigue, mobility, and quality of life (). Potentially 
modifiable theory-based determinants of physical activity behavior need to be 
identified so that researchers may study their effectiveness in randomized 
clinical trials and clinicians may integrate them into practice to promote 
physical activity in this population. The purpose of this study was to explore 
the multidimensional (physical, social, and self-evaluative) outcome 
expectations for physical activity among persons with longstanding MS. A sample 
of 369 participants diagnosed with MS for more than 15 years completed surveys 
to measure multidimensional outcome expectations for exercise, MS functional 
limitations, and physical activity using two different instruments: one 
measuring physical activity engagement and the other measuring physical activity 
capability. Results indicated that MS functional limitation was the strongest 
predictor of both physical activity engagement and physical activity capability. 
Physical and social outcome expectations contributed to the model explaining 12% 
of the variation in physical activity engagement, whereas none of the outcome 
expectancy dimensions (physical, social, or self-evaluative) contributed to the 
model explaining variation in physical activity capability. Although analyses of 
cross-sectional data do not infer causation, these findings suggest that 
positive physical and social outcome expectations for physical activity are 
associated with engagement in physical activity as well as being potential 
sources of motivation for increasing physical activity behavior in individuals 
living with longstanding MS.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of strategies 
to treat hepatitis C virus (HCV) in HIV/HCV coinfected patients in the United 
States.
PARTICIPANTS: Simulated cohort of HIV/HCV genotype 1 coinfected, noncirrhotic, 
HCV treatment-naive individuals enrolled in US HIV guideline-concordant care.
DESIGN/INTERVENTIONS: Monte Carlo simulation comparing five strategies: no 
treatment; dual therapy with pegylated-interferon (PEG) and ribavirin (RBV); 
'PEG/RBV trial' in which all patients initiate dual therapy and switch to triple 
therapy upon failure; 'IL28B triage' in which patients initiate either dual 
therapy or triple therapy based on their IL28B allele type; and PEG/RBV and 
telaprevir (TPV) triple therapy. Sensitivity analyses varied efficacies and 
costs and included a scenario with interferon (IFN)-free therapy.
MAIN MEASURES: Sustained virologic response (SVR), life expectancy, discounted 
quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE), lifetime medical costs, and incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) in $/quality-adjusted life years (QALY) 
gained.
RESULTS: 'PEG/RBV trial,' 'IL28B triage,' and 'triple therapy' each provided 72% 
SVR and extended QALE compared with 'dual therapy' by 1.12, 1.14, and 1.15 QALY, 
respectively. The ICER of 'PEG/RBV trial' compared with 'dual therapy' was 
$37 500/QALY. 'IL28B triage' and 'triple therapy' provided little benefit 
compared with 'PEG/RBV trial,' and both had ICERs exceeding $300 000/QALY. In 
sensitivity analyses, IFN-free treatment attaining 90% SVR had an ICER less than 
$100 000/QALY compared with 'PEG/RBV trial' when its cost was $109 000 or less 
(125% of the cost of PEG/RBV/TVR).
CONCLUSION: HCV protease inhibitors are most efficiently used in HIV/HCV 
coinfection after a trial of PEG/RBV, sparing protease inhibitors for those who 
attain rapid virologic response and SVR. The cost-effectiveness of IFN-free 
regimens for HIV/HCV coinfection will depend on the cost of these therapies.

BACKGROUND: The application of disability weights by nature of injury is central 
to the calculation of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). Such weights 
should represent injury diagnosis groups that demonstrate homogeneity in 
disability outcomes. Existing classifications have not used empirical data in 
their development to inform groups that are homogeneous for disability outcomes, 
limiting the capacity to make informed recommendations for best practice in 
measuring injury burden.
METHODS: The Validating and Improving injury Burden Estimates (Injury-VIBES) 
Study includes pooled data from over 30 000 injured participants recruited to 
six cohort studies. The International Classification of Disease 10th Revision 
(ICD-10) diagnosis codes were mapped to existing injury burden study groupings 
and prediction models were developed to measure the capacity of the injury 
groupings and ICD-10 diagnoses to predict disability outcomes at 12 months. 
Models were adjusted for age, gender and data source and investigated for 
discrimination using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 
(AUC) and calibration using Hosmer-Lemeshow statistics and calibration curves.
RESULTS: Discrimination and calibration of models varied depending on the 
outcome measured. Models using full four-character ICD-10 diagnosis codes, 
rather than groupings of codes, demonstrated the highest discrimination ranging 
from an AUC (95% CI) of 0.627 (0.618 to 0.635) for the pain or discomfort item 
of the EQ-5D to 0.847 (0.841 to 0.853) for the extended Glasgow Outcome Scale 
independent living outcome. However, gain over other groupings was marginal.
CONCLUSIONS: Prediction performance was best for measures of function such as 
independent living, mobility and self-care. The classifications were poorer 
predictors of anxiety/depression and pain/discomfort. There was no clearly 
superior classification.

Using the EuroQol EQ-5D in Swiss cancer patients, which value set should be 
applied?

Klingelbergstrasse 61, 4056, Basel, Switzerland, klazien.matter@unibas.ch.

BACKGROUND: The European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) instrument 
combines questionnaire responses into a single utility estimate using 
country-specific value sets. Countries without a national value set are advised 
to select one based on geographic proximity. In the absence of a Swiss value 
set, we used foreign value sets to gain insights into their appropriateness for 
use with Swiss cancer patients.
METHODS: EQ-5D health states and visual analogue scale (VAS) ratings were 
collected in one German and three Swiss oncology trials. Utilities were 
calculated based on the United Kingdom (UK), German (GE), French (FR) and 
European Union (EU) value sets. Resulting differences and Pearson partial 
correlation coefficients with corresponding VAS ratings were assessed.
RESULTS: In total, 202 Swiss and 154 German patients undergoing cancer treatment 
completed at least two EQ-5D forms. The mean difference between GE-based and 
FR-, UK- or EU-based utilities was significantly larger than the differences 
between the latter. The absolute mean difference between utilities and VAS 
ratings was highest for GE-based utilities, for Swiss (0.170, 95 % confidence 
interval [CI] 0.146-0.194) and German patients (0.174, 95 % CI 0.145-0.202). The 
correlation between GE-based utilities and VAS ratings was the lowest (r = 0.36, 
95 % CI 0.33-0.40); the highest was between FR-based utilities and VAS ratings 
(r = 0.43, 95 % CI 0.39-0.46).
CONCLUSION: For Switzerland, utility calculations based on the German or French 
value set would be an obvious choice. Our results suggest that the German value 
set may not be the most appropriate for use with Swiss cancer patients. The 
French and EU value sets may be relevant alternatives and improve international 
comparability.

Neurons extend two types of neurites-axons and dendrites-that differ in 
structure and function. Although it is well understood that the cytoskeleton 
plays a pivotal role in neurite differentiation and extension, the mechanisms by 
which membrane components are supplied to growing axons or dendrites is largely 
unknown. We previously reported that the membrane supply to axons is regulated 
by lemur kinase 1 (LMTK1) through Rab11A-positive endosomes. Here we investigate 
the role of LMTK1 in dendrite formation. Down-regulation of LMTK1 increases 
dendrite growth and branching of cerebral cortical neurons in vitro and in vivo. 
LMTK1 knockout significantly enhances the prevalence, velocity, and run length 
of anterograde movement of Rab11A-positive endosomes to levels similar to those 
expressing constitutively active Rab11A-Q70L. Rab11A-positive endosome dynamics 
also increases in the cell body and growth cone of LMTK1-deficient neurons. 
Moreover, a nonphosphorylatable LMTK1 mutant (Ser34Ala, a Cdk5 phosphorylation 
site) dramatically promotes dendrite growth. Thus LMTK1 negatively controls 
dendritic formation by regulating Rab11A-positive endosomal trafficking in a 
Cdk5-dependent manner, indicating the Cdk5-LMTK1-Rab11A pathway as a regulatory 
mechanism of dendrite development as well as axon outgrowth.

BACKGROUND: Menopausal health demands priority in Indian scenario due to 
increase in life expectancy and growing population of menopausal women. Most are 
either unaware or do not pay adequate attention to these symptoms.
AIMS: To find the prevalence of menopausal symptoms and perceptions regarding 
menopause among menopausal women of Kerala.
SETTINGS AND DESIGN: A community based cross-sectional house to house survey was 
conducted at Anjarakandy a field practice area under Kannur Medical College, 
Anjarakandy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was conducted among 106 postmenopausal women 
staying more than 6 months at Anjarakandy with the help of pretested 
questionnaire administered by a trained social worker from January to October 
2009. Before that a pilot study was conducted and required sample size of 100 
was calculated. Random sampling of houses was done.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Data was coded, entered, and analyzed using SPSS 15. 
Chi-square test, proportions, and percentages were used.
RESULTS: The mean age of attaining menopause was 48.26 years. Prevalence of 
symptoms among ladies were emotional problems (crying spells, depression, 
irritability) 90.7%, headache 72.9%, lethargy 65.4%, dysuria 58.9%, 
forgetfulness 57%, musculoskeletal problems (joint pain, muscle pain) 53.3%, 
sexual problems (decreased libido, dyspareunia) 31.8%, genital problems 
(itching, vaginal dryness) 9.3%, and changes in voice 8.4%. Only 22.4% of women 
knew the correct cause of menopause.
CONCLUSIONS: Thus study stated that all the ladies were suffering from one or 
more number of menopausal symptoms. Ladies should be made aware of these 
symptoms, their causes and treatment respectively.

[Heart rate variability: a cardiometabolic risk marker with public health 
implications].

[Article in French]

Marsac J.

Heart rate variability (HRV) is a noninvasive, practical and reproducible 
measure of autonomic nervous system function. Although the heart is reasonably 
stable, the time between two beats (R-R) can be very different. HRV is the time 
variation between two consecutive heartbeats. HRV is believed to correspond to 
the balance between the sympathic and parasympathic influences on the intrinsic 
rhythm of the sinoatrial node. HRV is influenced by lifestyle factors, including 
physical activity, eating habits, sleep pattern, and smoking. In adults, 
decreased HRV is associated with a higher risk of cardiac events, including 
death, and is a predictor of hypertension. HRV may also have predictive value 
for life expectancy and health. HRV changes due to lifestyle factors precede the 
onset of cardiovascular disorders. Measurement of HRV and its components is of 
major interest for medical practitioners and public health specialists, in order 
to predict and evaluate the risk of cardiometabolic events related to lifestyle 
factors.

A United Kingdom-based economic evaluation of ranibizumab for patients with 
retinal vein occlusion (RVO).

Taylor M(1), Serbetci E, Ferreira A, Gairy K, Lewis L, Blouin J, Mitchell P.

OBJECTIVE: This study compares the cost-effectiveness of intravitreal 
ranibizumab vs observation and/or laser photocoagulation for treatment of 
macular edema secondary to retinal vein occlusion in a UK-based model.
METHODS: A Markov model was constructed using transition probabilities and 
frequency of adverse events derived using data from the BRAVO, CRUISE, and 
HORIZON trials. Outcomes associated with treatments and health states were 
combined to predict overall health costs and outcomes for cohorts treated with 
each option.
RESULTS: In branch retinal vein occlusion, ranibizumab produced a gain of 0.518 
quality-adjusted life years at an incremental cost of £8141, compared with laser 
photocoagulation. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was £15,710 per 
quality-adjusted life year, and the incremental cost per month free from 
blindness was £658. In central retinal vein occlusion, ranibizumab produced a 
gain of 0.539 quality-adjusted life years at an incremental cost of £9216, 
compared with observation only. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was 
£17,103, and the incremental cost per month free from blindness was £423.
CONCLUSIONS: These incremental cost-effectiveness ratios are below the 
£20,000-30,000 range typically accepted as a threshold for cost-effectiveness. 
This suggests that ranibizumab may be regarded as a cost-effective therapy for 
patients with macular edema secondary to retinal vein occlusion, relative to 
grid laser photocoagulation (for BRVO) and observation (for CRVO). Limitations 
include sparse data for utilities associated with the severity of visual 
impairment in the WSE in patients with RVO. A lack of direct comparative 
evidence between ranibizumab and the dexamethasone intravitreal implant for the 
treatment of BRVO and CRVO and the infeasibility of an indirect comparison due 
to significant heterogeneity in trial designs prevented the inclusion of this 
treatment as a comparator in the Markov model.

From whole brain to hospice: patterns of care in radiation oncology.

Nashville, Tennessee.

OBJECTIVES: The development of brain metastases is a common cause of morbidity 
and mortality in cancer patients. Limited life expectancy is well established 
once a patient requires whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT). There is emerging 
evidence demonstrating the value of involving palliative care services alongside 
traditional treatments. However, data regarding the utilization of these 
services in patients requiring WBRT remain unexplored.
METHODS: Patients with histologic or radiographic evidence of brain metastases 
treated with WBRT alone between July 2010 and June 2012 were reviewed 
retrospectively. Patient demographics, the number of hospital admissions in the 
last 6 months of life, survival, and referrals to palliative care services were 
evaluated.
RESULTS: Ninety-eight patients were diagnosed with brain metastases and treated 
with WBRT alone. The median overall survival following WBRT was 80 days. 
Twenty-eight of the patients presented to the emergency department ≥2 times in 
the last 6 months of life. Sixty-eight percent of patients were referred to 
palliative care. Of those referrals, 57% were during an inpatient 
hospitalization. The median survival from palliative care referral to death was 
27 days.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with brain metastasis requiring WBRT have a predictable 
dying trajectory. These patients are likely to have a high symptom burden and 
would benefit from palliative care. Timely palliative care referrals in this 
population remain inadequate and classically follow a hospital admission. 
Referrals continued to be late in the dying process and the recommendation for 
WBRT can be used as an independent marker for initiating end-of-life discussions 
and involving palliative care.

BACKGROUND: Many patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) are believed to have 
unrecognized diabetes, which is associated with a worse prognosis. This study 
aimed to describe glucose tolerance in a general stable CHF population and to 
identify determinants of glucose tolerance focusing on body composition and 
skeletal muscle strength.
METHODS: A prospective observational study was set up. Inclusion criteria were 
diagnosis of CHF, stable condition and absence of glucose-lowering medication. 
Patients underwent a 2 h oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), isometric strength 
testing of the upper leg and dual energy x-ray absorptiometry. Health-related 
quality of life and physical activity level were assessed by questionnaire.
RESULTS: Data of 56 participants were analyzed. Despite near-normal fasting 
glucose values, 55% was classified as prediabetic, 14% as diabetic, and 20% as 
normal glucose tolerant. Of all newly diagnosed diabetic patients, 79% were 
diagnosed because of 2 h glucose values only and none because of HbA1c. 
Univariate mixed model analysis revealed ischaemic aetiology, daily physical 
activity, E/E', fat trunk/fat limbs and extension strength as possible 
explanatory variables for the glucose curve during the glucose tolerance test. 
When combined in one model, only fat trunk/fat limbs and E/E' remained 
significant predictors. Furthermore, fasting insulin was correlated with fat 
mass/height2 (r = 0.51, p < 0.0001), extension strength (r = -0.33, p < 0.01) 
and triglycerides (r = 0.39, p < 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: Our data confirm that a large majority of CHF patients have 
impaired glucose tolerance. This glucose intolerance is related to fat 
distribution and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure.

INTRODUCTION: Incidence of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is increasing over the 25 
last years. Pancreatic metastases of RCC are rare. The aim of this work was to 
study overall survival of patients operated for pancreatic metastases of RCC in 
Montpellier cancer institute.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 2000 and 2012, a retrospective monocentric study 
was performed at Montpellier cancer institute. We evaluated the outcomes of 
curative pancreatic metastases from renal primary and the impact of targeted 
therapies.
RESULTS: Thirty-eight patients were treated in our center for pancreatic 
metastases of RCC. Twelve patients had a curative surgery of metachronous 
pancreatic metastases. Four patients were without recurrence after pancreatic 
resection (33.3%). None had adjuvant therapy. Six patients were treated by 
targeted therapies, because of metastatic progression. Five of 6 died, the sixth 
evolved with targeted therapies by thyrosine kinase inhibitor. Average deadline 
between appearance of metastases and death was 89.9 months for operated 
patients. Average deadline between appearance of c metastases and death was 33.1 
months for the others (P=0.004).
CONCLUSION: Surgical treatment of pancreatic metastases should increase life 
expectancy of patients. Others studies are necessary to prove the impact of 
targeted therapies in metastatics patients in this indication.

OBJECTIVE: Sickle cell disease is associated with a decreased life expectancy, 
half of the deaths occurring in the ICU. We aimed to describe the 
characteristics of sickle cell disease patients admitted to ICU and to identify 
early predictors of a complicated outcome, defined as the need for vital support 
or death.
DESIGN: Retrospective observational cohort study of sickle cell disease patients 
over a 6-year period.
SETTING: ICU of a French teaching hospital and sickle cell disease referral 
center.
PATIENTS: Hundred thirty-eight ICU admissions in 119 sickle cell disease 
patients.
INTERVENTIONS: None.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: ICU admission was mainly indicated for sickle 
cell disease-related events, especially acute chest syndrome. Mechanical 
ventilation, vasoactive drugs, and renal replacement therapy were administered 
to 25 (18%), 10 (7%), and 10 (7%) episodes, respectively. The complicated 
outcome group (n = 28; 20%) was characterized by a more aggressive acute disease 
within the 48 hours preceding ICU admission, with a higher respiratory rate, a 
more frequent acute kidney injury, and a more sustained drop of hemoglobin (all 
p < 0.01). All nine deaths (7%) were sickle cell disease related. None of the 
sickle cell disease baseline characteristics predicted accurately a complicated 
outcome. In multivariate analysis, hemoglobin less than or equal to 7.8 g/dL 
(odds ratio, 3.6; 95% CI, 1.1-11.9), respiratory rate more than or equal to 32 
cycles/min (odds ratio, 5.6; 95% CI, 1.8-17.2), and acute kidney injury on ICU 
admission (odds ratio, 11.5; 95% CI, 2.5-52.6) were independently associated 
with a complicated outcome.
CONCLUSIONS: Sickle cell disease patients are at high risk of complications when 
admitted to the ICU. A sustained drop of hemoglobin, acute respiratory distress, 
and kidney injury at admission are strong predictors of a complicated outcome.

Older age is associated with a decline in physical fitness and reduced 
efficiency of the respiratory system. Paradoxically, it is also related to 
reduced report of dyspnea, that is, the experience of difficult and 
uncomfortable breathing. Reduced symptom reporting contributes to misdiagnosis 
or late diagnosis of underlying disease, suboptimal treatment, faster disease 
progression, shorter life expectancy, lower quality of life for patients, and 
considerably increased costs for the health care system in an aging society. 
However, pathways in the complex relationship between dyspnea and age are not 
well explored yet. We propose a model on geriatric dyspnea that integrates 
physiological, neurological, psychological and social pathways which link older 
age with dyspnea perception and expression. We suggest that the seemingly 
paradox of reduction of dyspnea in older age, despite physiological decline, can 
be solved by taking age-related changes on these multiple levels into account. 
In identifying these variables, the Geriatric Dyspnea Model highlights risk 
factors for reduced dyspnea perception and report in older age and pathways for 
intervention.

The effects of immunosuppressive medications on outcomes in microvascular free 
tissue transfer.

(1)San Francisco, Calif. From the University of California, San Francisco.

BACKGROUND: Reported 10-year patient survival after liver transplantation is 
nearing 70 percent, with similar trends seen for kidney transplantation. With 
increasing life expectancy, these patients have an increased need for 
posttransplant reconstructive surgery. Thus, plastic surgeons must know the 
effects of immunosuppressive medications on outcomes in microvascular 
reconstruction.
METHODS: A retrospective review was performed on all immunosuppressed 
solid-organ transplant patients who underwent subsequent free tissue transfer of 
all types, over an 8-year period. Patient demographics, type of solid organ 
transplant, immunosuppressive regimen, anticoagulation regimen, associated 
medical comorbidities, and complication rates were analyzed.
RESULTS: Twenty-four microvascular free tissue transfers were performed over an 
8-year period on immunosuppressed patients, for head and neck and lower 
extremity reconstruction. Fifteen patients (63 percent) underwent prior kidney 
transplant, seven (29 percent) underwent prior liver transplant, and two (8 
percent) underwent prior lung transplant. Prednisone (79 percent of patients), 
cyclosporine (33 percent), and tacrolimus (33 percent) were the most commonly 
used immunosuppressive medications. Complications included one total flap loss 
(4 percent), three intraoperative arterial thromboses (13 percent), and two 
postoperative venous thromboses (8 percent). Univariate analysis illustrated a 
statistically significant association between prednisone and overall 
complication rate (p = 0.032).
CONCLUSIONS: Microvascular free tissue transfer is a challenge in 
immunosuppressed patients. Univariate analysis showed prednisone to correlate 
statistically with operative morbidity. Transplant patients receiving prednisone 
at the time of their elective free flap procedure will require additional care 
to lower the additional risk of delayed wound healing, partial flap loss, and 
anastomotic thrombosis.

Jr.

Hospital; Harvard Medical School; and the Faculty of Medicine, McGill 
University.

BACKGROUND: Cost-utility studies, common in medicine, are rare within plastic 
surgery despite their capability of measuring the value of procedures by 
considering the societal costs of improving quality of life. The objectives of 
this study were to analyze the design quality of the plastic surgery 
cost-utility literature and to identify areas of needed improvement for future 
studies.
METHODS: A scoring tool was constructed based on the Recommendations of the 
Panel on Cost-Effectiveness in Health and Medicine. A PubMed search through 
October of 2012 was conducted for English-language plastic surgery utility 
studies. Articles were selected using two inclusion criteria and evaluated using 
the scoring tool.
RESULTS: A 9-point scoring tool was created, and 37 publications were selected. 
Their average score was 3 out of 9 points. Thirty studies (81 percent) used 
population preferences in utility measurements. Fifteen studies (41 percent) 
measured costs, but only four (11 percent) included indirect costs and only five 
(14 percent) applied discount rates to calculate the value of treatments over 
time. Three studies (8 percent) earned zero points. The highest scoring study 
earned 8 points.
CONCLUSIONS: The identified studies manifest the potential of cost-utility 
analyses in plastic surgery. Nonetheless, they are inconsistent in applying 
established cost-utility guidelines, especially in measuring costs and 
conducting recommended sensitivity analysis. Following this simple scoring tool 
can help future studies achieve some necessary improvements.

BACKGROUND: The widespread availability of genetic testing allowing the 
identification of "milder" individuals with CF coincided with improvements in CF 
life expectancy but the relative contribution of case mix to that improved 
survival is uncertain.
METHODS: Patients in the U.K. CF registry were divided into 'mild phenotype' 
defined as pancreatic sufficient and 'typical CF' defined as pancreatic 
insufficient. Distributions of age at death were compared with Mann-Whitney 
test. Temporal trends in incidence and prevalence were described. 
Jonckheere-Terpstra test was used to compare the trend for median age at death 
from 2007 to 2010.
RESULTS: Patients with 'mild phenotype' had significantly higher age at death 
(32 years, interquartile range 14 years versus 27 years, interquartile range 29 
years; Mann-Whitney test p-value = 0.026). The proportion of patients with 'mild 
phenotype' appeared to be increasing (0.128 in 2007, 0.144 in 2010). The trend 
for increasing age at death (from 25 years in 2007 to 29 years in 2010, 
Jonckheere-Terpstra test p-value = 0.012) was independent of the 'mild 
phenotype' patients.
CONCLUSION: The impact of mild phenotypes on the improvement in the median age 
at death among people with CF was trivial.

Prognostic factors in older patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer in 
China.

Su Q, Sun YP, Liu YH, Li Z, Yang HY, Sun ZG, Cao BW, Jia JH.

AIMS AND BACKGROUND: The human life expectancy and the incidence of lung cancer 
have increased dramatically in recent years. As a result, there is a high demand 
for the management of older patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer 
(NSCLC) in clinical practice. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the 
prognostic factors in ≥65-year-old patients with advanced NSCLC in China.
METHOD: This study involved a retrospective review of 78 ≥65-year-old patients 
with a diagnosis of NSCLC and at an advanced stage of disease, defined as stage 
IIIB or IV. All patients were followed up for a 3-year interval to determine the 
survival rates. Clinical data including gender, smoking history, comorbidities, 
performance status (PS), histological differentiation, disease stage, treatment 
and overall survival were recorded. The log-rank test was used to calculate 
survival rates. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was performed to determine 
independent prognostic factors.
RESULTS: The 1-year, 2-year and 3-year survival rates of the 78 patients were 
44.9%, 23.1% and 9.0%, respectively. In univariate analysis by the log-rank 
test, the 3-year survival rate was significantly associated with PS (P <0.01), 
disease stage (P <0.01) and chemotherapy treatment (P <0.01). The results of 
multivariate Cox regression analysis confirmed that PS and disease stage were 
independent prognostic factors.
CONCLUSION: The 3-year survival rate in ≥65-year-old patients with advanced 
NSCLC was significantly associated with PS, disease stage and chemotherapy. PS 
and disease stage were independent prognostic factors. Older patients with 
advanced NSCLC in China might benefit from chemotherapy.

BACKGROUND: The conventional treatment of obesity presents unsatisfactory 
results on weight loss and its long-term sustainability, therefore bariatric 
surgery has been suggested as an effective therapy, determining sustainable 
long-term weight loss, reversal of components of cardiometabolic risk and 
improved quality and life expectancy.
AIM: To investigate the clinical component of the cardiometabolic risk in 
patients undergoing bariatric surgery assisted on outpatient basis. Methods : 
The sample consisted of 47 patients with ages between 18 and 60 years, 72% 
females. Diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and dyslipidemia were prospectively 
evaluated by using the Assessment of Obesity-Related Co-morbidities scale.
RESULTS: Occurred improvement in these co-morbidities within 12 months after 
surgery. Co-morbidities resolved were greater than those improved.
CONCLUSION: The study revealed that the Assessment of Obesity-Related 
Co-morbidities is a system that can be effectively used to quantify the degree 
of reduction of the severity of the cardiometabolic risk in response to 
bariatric surgery.

RACIONAL: Diante dos resultados insatisfatórios do tratamento convencional da 
obesidade na perda ponderal e na sua sustentabilidade em longo prazo, a cirurgia 
bariátrica vem sendo apontada como terapêutica eficaz, determinando perda 
ponderal sustentável em longo prazo, reversão de componentes do risco 
cardiometabólico e melhora da qualidade e expectativa de vida.
OBJETIVO: Acompanhar a evolução clínica dos componentes do risco 
cardiometabólico em pacientes submetidos à cirurgia bariátrica.
MÉTODOS: A amostra constituiu-se de 47 pacientes de 18 a 60 anos de idade, 72% 
do sexo feminino. A evolução clínica das comorbidades diabete melito, 
dislipidemia e hipertensão arterial, foi quantificada, procedendo-se ao cálculo 
de escores relativos à Avaliação das Comorbidades Relacionadas à Obesidade.
RESULTADOS: Houve redução significativa do escore médio de todas as comorbidades 
relacionadas à obesidade, desde a admissão até os 12 meses seguintes. 
Independente do momento de assistência nutricional, o contingente de pacientes 
que as tiveram revertidas superou aqueles apenas melhoradas.
CONCLUSÃO: O estudo revelou que a Avaliação das Comorbidades Relacionadas à 
Obesidade é sistema efetivo para quantificar o grau de redução da gravidade do 
risco cardiometabólico em resposta à cirurgia bariátrica.

Zinc finger protein 521 (ZFP521) regulates a number of cellular processes in a 
wide range of tissues, such as osteoblast formation and adipose commitment and 
differentiation. In the field of neurobiology, it is reported to be an essential 
factor for transition of epiblast stem cells into neural progenitors in vitro. 
However, the role of ZFP521 in the brain in vivo still remains elusive. To 
elucidate the role of ZFP521 in the mouse brain, we generated mice lacking exon 
4 of the ZFP521 gene. The birth ratio of our ZFP521Δ/Δ mice was consistent with 
Mendel's laws. Although ZFP521Δ/Δ pups had no apparent defect in the body and 
were indistinguishable from ZFP521+/+ and ZFP521+/Δ littermates at the time of 
birth, ZFP521Δ/Δ mice displayed significant weight reduction as they grew, and 
most of them died before 10 weeks of age. They displayed abnormal behavior, such 
as hyper-locomotion, lower anxiety and impaired learning, which correspond to 
the symptoms of schizophrenia. The border of the granular cell layer of the 
dentate gyrus in the hippocampus of the mice was indistinct and granular neurons 
were reduced in number. Furthermore, Sox1-positive neural progenitor cells in 
the dentate gyrus and cerebellum were significantly reduced in number. Taken 
together, these findings indicate that ZFP521 directly or indirectly affects the 
formation of the neuronal cell layers of the dentate gyrus in the hippocampus, 
and thus ZFP521Δ/Δ mice displayed schizophrenia-relevant symptoms. ZFP521Δ/Δ 
mice may be a useful research tool as an animal model of schizophrenia.

OBJECTIVE: Cutaneous and mucosal disorders are the most common problems in 
patients on long-term hemodialysis. The dialysis prolongs the life expectancy, 
giving time of these changes to manifest. The aim of this study was to evaluate 
the prevalence of dermatologic problems among patients with chronic renal 
disease (CRD) undergoing hemodialysis.
METHODS: One hundred forty-five patients with chronic renal disease undergoing 
hemodialysis were studied. All patients were thoroughly examined for skin 
changes, hair, nails and mucous membranes by a single examiner and laboratory 
tests were assessed. The data were stored in a database Microsoft Excel and 
analyzed using descriptive statistics. The continuous variables were compared 
using Student's t-test and categorical variables the chi-square test or Fisher's 
Exact test.
RESULTS: The study included 145 patients, mean age of 53.6 ± 14.7 years, 
predominantly male (64.1%) and caucasian (90.0%). The average time of dialysis 
was 43.3 ± 42.3 months. The main underlying diseases were: hypertension in 
33.8%, diabetes mellitus in 29.6% and chronic glomerulonephritis in 13.1% of the 
patients. The main dermatologic manifestations observed were: xerosis in 109 
(75.2%), ecchymosis in 87 (60.0%), pruritus in 78 (53.8%) and lentigo in 33 
(22.8%) patients.
CONCLUSION: Our study showed the presence of more than one alteration per 
patient. Cutaneous alterations are frequent in patients on dialysis. Further 
studies are needed to better characterization and management of these 
dermatosis.
