INTRODUCTION: The human genome-scale metabolic reconstruction details all known 
metabolic reactions occurring in humans, and thereby holds substantial promise 
for studying complex diseases and phenotypes. Capturing the whole human 
metabolic reconstruction is an on-going task and since the last community effort 
generated a consensus reconstruction, several updates have been developed.
OBJECTIVES: We report a new consensus version, Recon 2.2, which integrates 
various alternative versions with significant additional updates. In addition to 
re-establishing a consensus reconstruction, further key objectives included 
providing more comprehensive annotation of metabolites and genes, ensuring full 
mass and charge balance in all reactions, and developing a model that correctly 
predicts ATP production on a range of carbon sources.
METHODS: Recon 2.2 has been developed through a combination of manual curation 
and automated error checking. Specific and significant manual updates include a 
respecification of fatty acid metabolism, oxidative phosphorylation and a 
coupling of the electron transport chain to ATP synthase activity. All 
metabolites have definitive chemical formulae and charges specified, and these 
are used to ensure full mass and charge reaction balancing through an automated 
linear programming approach. Additionally, improved integration with 
transcriptomics and proteomics data has been facilitated with the updated 
curation of relationships between genes, proteins and reactions.
RESULTS: Recon 2.2 now represents the most predictive model of human metabolism 
to date as demonstrated here. Extensive manual curation has increased the 
reconstruction size to 5324 metabolites, 7785 reactions and 1675 associated 
genes, which now are mapped to a single standard. The focus upon mass and charge 
balancing of all reactions, along with better representation of energy 
generation, has produced a flux model that correctly predicts ATP yield on 
different carbon sources.
CONCLUSION: Through these updates we have achieved the most complete and best 
annotated consensus human metabolic reconstruction available, thereby increasing 
the ability of this resource to provide novel insights into normal and disease 
states in human. The model is freely available from the Biomodels database 
(http://identifiers.org/biomodels.db/MODEL1603150001).

KwaZulu-Natal, Pietermaritzburg, Private Bag X01, Scottsville, 3209, South 
Africa.

BACKGROUND: In sub-Saharan African countries, the chance of a child dying before 
the age of five years is high. The problem is similar in Ethiopia, but it shows 
a decrease over years.
METHODS: The 2000; 2005 and 2011 Ethiopian Demographic and Health Survey results 
were used for this work. The purpose of the study is to detect the pattern of 
under-five child mortality overtime. Indirect child mortality estimation 
technique is adapted to examine the under-five child mortality trend in 
Ethiopia.
RESULTS: From the result, it was possible to see the trend of under-five child 
mortality in Ethiopia. The under-five child mortality shows a decline in 
Ethiopia.
CONCLUSION: From the study, it can be seen that there is a positive correlation 
between mother and child survival which is almost certain in any population. 
Therefore, this study shows the trend of under-five mortality in Ethiopia and 
decline over time.

BACKGROUND: The Japanese and Korean healthcare systems are very similar and 
thus, they have the same problems and weaknesses. This study discusses the 
problems and proposes complementary solutions based on the results of a 
comparative analysis of conditions in the healthcare systems of the two 
countries.
METHODS: This article presents a comparative analysis of the healthcare status 
of the two countries based on certain health criteria used worldwide, a 
literature review, and data from the Korean Ministry of Health and Welfare, 
Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, World Health Organization 
(WHO), World Bank, and Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development 
(OECD).
RESULTS: The scores of the healthcare systems were calculated for quantitative 
comparison. The performance of the Japanese health system was the best, followed 
by the Korean health system. Both countries observed an increased life 
expectancy and decreased infant and under-five mortality rates during the last 
14 years. However, lower fertility rates were found, which could lead to a 
decreased working population and a subsequent increase in the economic burden of 
governments and households. A higher alcohol consumption rate was found in 
Korea, which was related to the establishment of interpersonal relationships.
CONCLUSION: The reform of the healthcare systems in Korea and Japan led to an 
increased life expectancy; concurrently, reduced fertility rates led to an 
increasing aging population. As a result, increasing health costs require 
additional measures to improve health equity and strengthen health promotion.

MKHITAR GOSH'S MEDIEVAL LAW CODE AND ITS IMPLICATIONS FOR ARMENIAN COMMUNITIES 
ABROAD.

Davtyan S, Khachatryan M, Johrian A, Ghazaryan K.

The Law Book of the medieval Armenian legal and economic thought is an 
exceptional work that encompasses valuable information of the Armenian nation's 
domestic life. Mkhitar Gosh was considered to be one of the most outstanding 
figures and lawyers (lawmakers) of all times. Armenian Law Code after Mkhitar 
Gosh is writhed at 12 century. One of the primary sources for the law code was 
Armenian customary law. This Code became moral code for guiding for hall 
Armenians over the world because of high moral spirit reflecting Armenian 
mentality. This article presents the brief history of extension of legal rules 
setting out in the Law Code. The Law Code was established and widely used not 
only in Armenia but also in a number of Armenian communities abroad (Russian, 
Poland, Georgia, Latvia, India etc.). Law Code was accepted by all Armenians. 
Moreover, it served for the development of legislation for a number of civilized 
European and Asian countries.

THE ADOPTION OF BUDDHISM'S PRINCIPLES AS A MEANS OF IMPROVING PHYSICIANS' WORK 
WITH TERMINALLY ILL PATIENTS.

Wolf R.

The medical approach as summarized by Leibowitz--"We must treat the person, not 
just the disease"--highlights the importance of treating the sick person and not 
only the illness' pathology. This approach calls for healing not only the 
physical side, but also--and mainly--the mental aspect of the patient. One of 
the goals of this article is to turn physicians' attention towards the 
compassion necessary in treating a person with a severe or chronic illness, or a 
person who is dying--precisely because sometimes there is no medical cure for 
the physical state of such a patient. Therefore, physicians' attention does need 
to be directed to providing emotional assistance to such a patient. Sometimes, 
the emotional strength the patient draws from the medical team that is treating 
him can change his view of, and approach to, the illness, and can enable his 
body to muster the emotional strength necessary to deal with his situation. 
Buddhism's approach enables the sick patient to experience his illness in a 
different way, by making peace with one's situation and, sometimes, even viewing 
the situation differently--viewing the illness as a type of renewal. Buddhism, 
therefore, enables a sick person to choose a different point of view when his 
energy is exhausted and he loses hope, providing quality of life to patients. In 
such a situation, a sick person finds emotional strength in the knowledge that 
the end of his life is actually a renewal somewhere else. The limited life 
expectancy of the terminally ill patient demands that he be able to spend his 
time with minimal concerns and worries, and does not leave much time for 
treating the emotional side--the patient's fear. In light of this fact, the 
patient's ability to look ahead and grasp at hope is the most important issue. 
As much as possible, this is accomplished in an atmosphere of acceptance and 
with the absence, or reduction, of fear. The freedom to decide for oneself how 
to behave, according to one's own approach, is what makes it possible for the 
sick individual to feel empowered, and is liable to encourage the patient to 
adopt a different point of view. The Buddhist approach recommends replacing the 
helplessness that usually accompanies the predicament of terminally ill patients 
with acceptance of responsibility for their behavior in any given situation; 
this is Buddhism's main contribution to both physicians and patients alike.

THE BUDGET, THE FAMILY PHYSICIAN AND THE PATIENT A DIFFERENT APPROACH.

Keidar I.

Modern medicine offers better health and longer life expectancy, yet consumes 
huge budgets. The Israeli Health Insurance Law (IHIL) regulates the delivery of 
health services to all Israel's residents through Health Maintenance 
Organizations (HMOS). These organizations confront constant struggles with their 
budgets and have to reduce expenses as much as possible (without harming the 
health level rendered). In the constant necessity to restrain expenses are 
embedded difficulties that might cause unrest to the Public Health System (PHS). 
At the edge of the public health spear are the Family Physicians (FPS) who have 
not only to supply the best possible medicine to their patients, and at the same 
time confront budgetary constraints that have the potential to hinder the level 
of rendered medicine, but also have, at times, to mediate between the 
conflicting interests of their patients' wish to receive the best available 
health measures, the FP own medical believes, the HMO's directives and, between 
the FPS wish, to keep up the number of their (content) patients. One of the 
World Health Organization's (WHO) concepts, like Israel's one, is that soul and 
body are inseparable and must be addressed simultaneously in the process of 
healing. Real life at the Family Physicians' clinics shows, at times, that 
despite the Israeli physicians' very high professional level, and the Israeli 
Health System (IHS)'s high efficiency, such a process, due to budgetary 
constraints, workload and various other reasons, does not always take place and, 
on the personal level, there are patients who feel that the "system" has treated 
them incorrectly and in an unsatisfactory manner. Unsatisfied and restless 
patients might cause undesirable consequences to the "system", like losing faith 
in one's FP and HMO, which might lead to the patients' reduced cooperation in 
the healing process, lawsuits amplification, patients leaving their FPS and 
their HMOs etc. Addressing the patient's soul and body as an inseparable unit 
would help harnessing the patients' will and mental resources to the healing 
process. A content and satisfied patient tends to less argue with his/her FP, to 
be more satisfied with the rendered health services, to be more grateful for the 
provided services, to be healthier (as some would argue), to be more motivated 
and committed to the healing process, thus, all parties would benefit, 
emotionally, physically and from the budgetary point of view. This article would 
like to offer a "simple" 'yet very effective way' to keep the HMO's members feel 
that they are not alone at their sensitive time of illness, that behind the FP's 
desk sits not only a professional figure, but also a "human being" who is there 
to support their "souls" as well, thus, harnessing the patients to the healing 
process, reducing the patients' possible discontent from the HMOS's ways of 
rendering services including, at times, in cases when the required or desired 
medical measures is not received. The correct use of Interpersonal Communication 
(IPC) by the FP encompasses tremendous opportunities to achieve the desired 
connection between soul and body during the healing process, and offers many 
personal, budgetary and other benefits to the patient, FP, HMO and the health 
system at large. Its use is almost costless, its contribution to the health 
system is huge and, last, but not least, it can easily be learned and adopted by 
FPS in their daily work with their patients and the system.

Cyanobacterial Polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB): Screening, Optimization and 
Characterization.

Ansari S(1), Fatma T(1).

Millia Islamia (Central University), New Delhi, India.

In modern life petroleum-based plastic has become indispensable due to its 
frequent use as an easily available and a low cost packaging and moulding 
material. However, its rapidly growing use is causing aquatic and terrestrial 
pollution. Under these circumstances, research and development for biodegradable 
plastic (bioplastics) is inevitable. Polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB), a type of 
microbial polyester that accumulates as a carbon/energy storage material in 
various microorganisms can be a good alternative. In this study, 23 
cyanobacterial strains (15 heterocystous and 8 non-heterocystous) were screened 
for PHB production. The highest PHB (6.44% w/w of dry cells) was detected in 
Nostoc muscorum NCCU- 442 and the lowest in Spirulina platensis NCCU-S5 (0.51% 
w/w of dry cells), whereas no PHB was found in Cylindrospermum sp., Oscillatoria 
sp. and Plectonema sp. Presence of PHB granules in Nostoc muscorum NCCU- 442 was 
confirmed microscopically with Sudan black B and Nile red A staining. 
Pretreatment of biomass with methanol: acetone: water: dimethylformamide [40: 
40: 18: 2 (MAD-I)] with 2 h magnetic bar stirring followed by 30 h continuous 
chloroform soxhlet extraction acted as optimal extraction conditions. Optimized 
physicochemical conditions viz. 7.5 pH, 30¬∞C temperature, 10:14 h light:dark 
periods with 0.4% glucose (as additional carbon source), 1.0 gl-1 sodium 
chloride and phosphorus deficiency yielded 26.37% PHB on 7th day instead of 21st 
day. Using FTIR, 1H NMR and GC-MS, extracted polymer was identified as PHB. 
Thermal properties (melting temperature, decomposition temperatures etc.) of the 
extracted polymer were determined by TGA and DSC. Further, the polymer showed 
good tensile strength and young's modulus with a low extension to break ratio 
comparable to petrochemical plastic. Biodegradability potential tested as weight 
loss percentage showed efficient degradation (24.58%) of PHB within 60 days by 
mixed microbial culture in comparison to petrochemical plastic.

OBJECTIVES: Many of the cost-effectiveness analyses of apixaban against warfarin 
focused on Western populations but Asian evidence remains less clear. The 
present study aims to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of apixaban against 
warfarin in Chinese patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) from a 
public institutional perspective in Hong Kong.
METHODS: We used a Markov model incorporating 12 health state transitions, and 
simulated the disease progression of NVAF in 1,000 hypothetical patients treated 
with apixaban/warfarin. Risks of clinical events were based on the ARISTOTLE 
trial and were adjusted with local International Normalized Ratio control, 
defined as the time in therapeutic range. Real-life input for the model, 
including patients' demographics and clinical profiles, post-event treatment 
patterns, and healthcare costs, were determined by a retrospective cohort of 
40,569 incident patients retrieved from a Hong Kong-wide electronic medical 
database. Main outcome measurements included numbers of thromboembolic and 
bleeding events, life years, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and direct 
healthcare cost. When comparing apixaban and warfarin, treatment with 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) less than one local GDP per capita 
(USD 33,534 in 2014) was defined to be cost-effective.
RESULTS: In the lifetime simulation, fewer numbers of events were estimated for 
the apixaban group, resulting in reduced event-related direct medical costs. The 
estimated ICER of apixaban was USD 7,057 per QALY at base-case analysis and 
ranged from USD 1,061 to 14,867 per QALY under the 116 tested scenarios in 
deterministic sensitivity analysis. While in probabilistic sensitivity analysis, 
the probability of apixaban being the cost-effective alternative to warfarin was 
96% and 98% at a willingness to pay threshold of USD 33,534 and 100,602 per 
QALY, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Apixaban is likely to be a cost-effective alternative to warfarin 
for stroke prophylaxis in Chinese patients with NVAF in Hong Kong.

The increased life expectancy of persons infected with human immunodeficiency 
virus (HIV) treated with antiretroviral therapy (ART) has resulted in renewed 
attention to non-HIV-related diseases exacerbated by HIV infection. Coinfection 
with hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a particular area of concern, as the global 
prevalence has been estimated at 2.5-5 million people. In this article, we 
discuss the epidemiology of HCV infection and reinfection, HCV-related liver 
disease progression in the era of effective ART, and the efficacy of emerging 
HCV treatment strategies in persons with HIV/HCV coinfection. New data regarding 
treatment of persons with HIV/HCV coinfection suggest that HCV treatment should 
be a priority in those with HIV. Results from recent studies using all-oral HCV 
regimens have shown high rates of sustained virologic response in both clinical 
trials and real-world settings. A multidisciplinary approach to HCV treatment in 
those with HIV is recommended for optimal patient management. Following HCV 
cure, practitioners also need to be mindful of the risks for HCV reinfection and 
educate patients on protective measures.

Differences between male and female affect diseases onset, evolution and 
prognosis. In terms of survival, women have a higher life expectancy at birth 
than men, with strong differences at regional level (the highest values in 
Trento AP and the lowest in Campania). Smoking, alcohol consumption, overweight 
and obesity and physical activities indicators are analyzed among men and woman. 
A reduction in smokers and number of smoked cigarettes is observed, especially 
among men. Men also show a higher number of ex-smokers than woman. Also for 
alcohol consumption, the prevalence of consumers at risk is higher among men 
than women. Overweight and obesity are more prevalent among men than women, the 
same as physical activity played continuously and occasionally. Gender 
differences are also shown in hospitalization rate and mortality rate for 
ischemic heart disease, affecting men twice more than women. The analysis shows 
a good health status condition of Italian people, but it is important to be 
aware that gender is one of essential characteristics in health care field, 
independently of people age.

BACKGROUND: There is evident benefit in terms of reduced aneurysm-related 
mortality from screening programs of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) in men aged 
65 years and more. Recent studies in the United Kingdom and Sweden have shown a 
decline of the prevalence of AAA in the general population. Current screening 
policies (e.g., men aged 65-74¬†years), however, do not account for aging and 
increased life expectancy of Western populations. This study investigated AAA 
detection by extending the target population to older age groups (75-85¬†years).
METHODS: AAA screening was conducted in the County of Chaudfontaine (Li√®ge, 
Belgium) on the population of elderly (n¬†=¬†3,054). The participation rate was 
36%. The 1,101 participants (722 men aged 65-85 years and 379 women aged 
74-85¬†years) were examined by ultrasound scan. AAA was defined as an infrarenal 
aortic outer-outer diameter of at least 3¬†cm. Demographics, clinical parameters, 
and risk factors were also recorded. AAA prevalence was estimated, and patients 
with and without AAA were compared by logistic regression.
RESULTS: The overall AAA prevalence was 3.6% (n¬†=¬†40). In female participants, 
AAA prevalence was low (1.3%). In men, it amounted 2.7% in the 65-74 age group 
but rose to 7.3% in the age-extended group (75-85¬†years). Further in addition to 
age, height, current smoking, history of coronary artery disease, 
hypercholesterolemia, peripheral artery disease of the lower limbs, and varicose 
veins were significantly associated with the presence of AAA.
CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary findings, based on a representative sample of the 
elderly population of the Li√®ge region, support the idea that current AAA 
screening policies should be updated to cover an increasingly aging population. 
The presence of varicose veins as a potential risk factor for AAA should also be 
considered during screening.

BACKGROUND: Obtaining cancer screening on patients with limited life expectancy 
has been proposed as a measure for low quality care for primary care physicians 
(PCPs). However, administrative data may underestimate life expectancy in 
patients who undergo screening.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the association between receipt of screening mammography 
or PSA and overall survival.
DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study from 1/1/1999 to 12/31/2012. Receipt of 
screening was assessed for 2001-2002 and survival from 1/1/2003 to 12/31/2012. 
Life expectancy was estimated as of 1/1/03 using a validated algorithm, and was 
compared to actual survival for men and women, stratified by receipt of cancer 
screening.
PARTICIPANTS: A 5¬†% sample of Medicare beneficiaries aged 69-90¬†years as of 
1/1/2003 (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ906,723).
INTERVENTIONS: Receipt of screening mammography in 2001-2002 for women, or a 
screening PSA test in 2002 for men.
MAIN MEASURES: Survival from 1/1/2003 through 12/31/2012.
KEY RESULTS: Subjects were stratified by life expectancy based on age and 
comorbidity. Within each stratum, the subjects with prior cancer screening had 
actual median survivals higher than those who were not screened, with 
differences ranging from 1.7 to 2.1¬†years for women and 0.9 to 1.1¬†years for 
men. In a Cox model, non-receipt of screening in women had an impact on survival 
(HR‚Äâ=‚Äâ1.52; 95¬†% CI‚Äâ=‚Äâ1.51, 1.54) similar in magnitude to a diagnosis of 
complicated diabetes or heart failure, and was comparable to uncomplicated 
diabetes or liver disease in men (HR‚Äâ=‚Äâ1.23; 1.22, 1.25).
CONCLUSIONS: Receipt of cancer screening is a powerful marker of health status 
that is not captured by comorbidity measures in administrative data. Because 
life expectancy algorithms using administrative data underestimate the life 
expectancy of patients who undergo screening, they can overestimate the problem 
of cancer screening in patients with limited life expectancy.

An excessive amount of iron may become extremely toxic both for its ability to 
generate reactive oxygen species, and for the lack of regulatory mechanisms for 
iron excretion in humans. Chelation therapy has been introduced in clinical 
practice in the 1970's to defend thalassemia patients from the effects of iron 
overload and it has dramatically changed both life expectancy and quality of 
life. The disadvantages of the drugs in clinical use make the research for new, 
more suitable iron chelating agents, urgent. This review defines the 
requirements of an iron chelator, then points out the principal chemical 
features of the iron chelators in use. Finally, a survey on the last ten years 
of the literature relative to iron chelators is done, and the most interesting 
ligands are presented, with particular emphasis to those that reached clinical 
trials.

Palmitoylation of cdc42 Promotes Spine Stabilization and Rescues Spine Density 
Deficit in a Mouse Model of 22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome.

22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS) is associated with learning and cognitive 
dysfunctions and a high risk of developing schizophrenia. It has become 
increasingly clear that dendritic spine plasticity is tightly linked to 
cognition. Thus, understanding how genes involved in cognitive disorders affect 
synaptic networks is a major challenge of modern biology. Several studies have 
pointed to a spine density deficit in 22q11DS transgenic mice models. Using the 
LgDel mouse model, we first quantified spine deficit at different stages using 
electron microscopy. Next we performed repetitive confocal imaging over several 
days on hippocampal organotypic cultures of LgDel mice. We show no imbalanced 
ratio between daily spine formation and spine elimination, but a decreased spine 
life expectancy. We corrected this impaired spine stabilization process by 
overexpressing ZDHHC8 palmitoyltransferase, whose gene belongs to the LgDel 
microdeletion. Overexpression of one of its substrates, the cdc42 brain-specific 
variant, under a constitutively active form (cdc42-palm-CA) led to the same 
result. Finally, we could rescue spine density in vivo, in adult LgDel mice, by 
injecting pups with a vector expressing cdc42-palm-CA. This study reveals a new 
role of ZDHHC8-cdc42-palm molecular pathway in postsynaptic structural 
plasticity and provides new evidence in favor of the dysconnectivity hypothesis 
for schizophrenia.

AIMS: To examine the mid-term outcome and cost utility of the BioPro metallic 
hemiarthroplasty for the treatment of hallux rigidius.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We reviewed 97 consecutive BioPro metallic 
hemiarthroplasties performed in 80 patients for end-stage hallux rigidus, with a 
minimum follow-up of five years. There were 19 men and 61 women; their mean age 
was 55 years (22 to 74). No patient was lost to follow-up.
RESULTS: A total of 12 patients (15 first metatarso-phalangeal joints (MTPJs)) 
required a revision; one for infection, two for osteolysis and 12 for pain. The 
all cause rate of survival at five years was 85.6% (95% confidence interval (CI) 
83.5 to 87.9). Younger age was a significant predictor of revision (odds ratio 
1.09, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.17, p = 0.014) on excluding infection and adjusting for 
confounding variables (Cox regression). Significant improvements were 
demonstrated at five years in the Manchester Oxford Foot Questionnaire (13.9, 
95% CI 10.5 to 17.2) and in the physical component of the Short Form-12 score 
(6.5, 95% CI 4.1 to 8.9). The overall rate of satisfaction was 75%. The cost per 
quality adjusted life year at five years, accounting for a 14% rate of revision 
was between ¬£4431 and ¬£6361 depending on the complexity and morbidity of the 
patient.
CONCLUSION: The BioPro hemiarthroplasty offers good short to mid-term functional 
outcome and is a cost effective intervention. The relatively high revision rate 
is associated with younger age and perhaps the use of this implant should be 
limited to older patients. Cite this article: Bone Joint J 2016;98-B:945-51.

CONTEXT: Functional growth hormone producing adenomas have long-term deleterious 
effects on the visual apparatus, the cardiovascular and musculoskeletal systems, 
and often predispose to malignancies. Since persistence of acromegaly affects 
outcome and quality of life, therapeutic interventions become mandatory.
AIM: This study represents an analysis of long-term clinical and endocrinal 
outcome of 115 patients of acromegaly after surgical management.
SETTING AND DESIGN: Tertiary care retrospective study.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred and fifteen patients (male:female ratio: 
1:1.09) with acromegalic features were studied. Apart from acromegalic features, 
their main clinical presentation also included headache, diminution of vision, 
field defects, ptosis, irregular menstruation, diabetes insipidus, diabetes 
mellitus and hypertension. Six of them presented with apoplexy. Their 
preoperative endocrinal evaluation included basal and suppressed growth hormone 
(GH), prolactin and thyroid levels. On the basis of axial and coronal CT scan or 
multiplanar MR imaging or both, the tumors were classified according to their 
suprasellar and parasellar extension (Hardy's grade). Transnasal 
trans-sphenoidal surgery (TSS) (n = 37) and sublabial, rhinoseptal TSS (n = 72) 
were the preferred approaches. Six patients with significant parasellar 
extensions underwent trans-cranial explorations. The patients were followed up 
at 6 and 12 weeks and then at 6 monthly intervals. Hormonal and CT/MR evaluation 
were also done. Attainment of random GH value less than 2.5 ¬µg/L, and the nadir 
GH value after oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) less than 1 ¬µg/L were used as 
the criteria of cure.
FINDINGS: The patients were preoperatively in Hardy's tumor grade 0 (29), A 
(21), A+E (3), B (21), B+E (5), C (9), C+E (10), D (1) D+E (11), E (5), 
respectively. One hundred and one patients were available for follow-up (FU; 
median FU duration: 84 months; range: 6 to 132 months). Surgical cure was 
achieved in 73 patients following the first surgery; and, in 10 additional 
patients following a second intervention. No patient with a preoperative grade 
0, A, B, C had a recurrence after attaining the initial remission. Recurrence 
after an initial cure occurred in 7 patients (overall remission rate following 
surgery: 75.24%). The preoperative grade of the latter patients was A+E:1, 
B+E:1, C+E:1, D:1, D+E:2, E:1, respectively. All these patients underwent 
subsequent radiotherapy (RT). The twelve patients with persistent symptoms and 
high GH levels following surgery underwent RT; six others with improved symptoms 
despite high GH levels were kept under strict observation. There was no surgical 
mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: A high remission rate without significant morbidity could be 
achieved following surgical intervention in acromegalic patients. Following 
surgery, tumors with greater than or equal to 3 cm suprasellar height and 
without parasellar extension had no clinical recurrence at FU. A continuous 
monitoring is mandatory to pick up relapsed cases as well as those who develop 
delayed signs of hypopituitarism. A subset of patients who show clinical 
improvement following surgery but still have higher GH levels may be followed up 
without additional therapy unless clinical signs reappear or the serum GH levels 
progressively increase.

Griscelli syndrome (GS) is an autosomal recessive disorder that is characterized 
by partial albinism of the skin and hair shaft. Prompt and early diagnosis is a 
crucial step for the follow up and management of GS, which would otherwise 
dramatically decrease the life expectancy of the patients. This case report 
presents the clinical course of a femoral fracture treated with closed reduction 
and pelvic-pedal cast, and progression of acute phase reaction during the follow 
up period.

The reliability and longevity of any storage medium is a key issue for 
archivists and preservationists as well as for the creators of important 
information. This is particularly true in the case of digital media such as DVD 
and CD where a sufficient number of errors may render the disc unreadable. This 
paper describes an initial stability study of commercially available recordable 
DVD and CD media using accelerated aging tests under conditions of increased 
temperature and humidity. The effect of prolonged exposure to direct light is 
also investigated and shown to have an effect on the error rates of the media. 
Initial results show that high quality optical media have very stable 
characteristics and may be suitable for long-term storage applications. However, 
results also indicate that significant differences exist in the stability of 
recordable optical media from different manufacturers.

Hepatitis C Virus Core Protein Promotes miR-122 Destabilization by Inhibiting 
GLD-2.

The liver-specific microRNA miR-122, which has essential roles in liver 
development and metabolism, is a key proviral factor for hepatitis C virus 
(HCV). Despite its crucial role in the liver and HCV life cycle, little is known 
about the molecular mechanism of miR-122 expression regulation by HCV infection. 
Here, we show that the HCV core protein downregulates the abundance of miR-122 
by promoting its destabilization via the inhibition of GLD-2, a non-canonical 
cytoplasmic poly(A) polymerase. The decrease in miR-122 expression resulted in 
the dysregulation of the known functions of miR-122, including its proviral 
activity for HCV. By high-throughput sequencing of small RNAs from human liver 
biopsies, we found that the 22-nucleotide (nt) prototype miR-122 is modified at 
its 3' end by 3'-terminal non-templated and templated nucleotide additions. 
Remarkably, the proportion of miR-122 isomers bearing a single nucleotide tail 
of any ribonucleotide decreased in liver specimens from patients with HCV. We 
found that these single-nucleotide-tailed miR-122 isomers display increased 
miRNA activity and stability over the 22-nt prototype miR-122 and that the 
3'-terminal extension is catalyzed by the unique terminal nucleotidyl 
transferase activity of GLD-2, which is capable of adding any single 
ribonucleotide without preference of adenylate to the miR-122 3' end. The HCV 
core protein specifically inhibited GLD-2, and its interaction with GLD-2 in the 
cytoplasm was found to be responsible for miR-122 downregulation. Collectively, 
our results provide new insights into the regulatory role of the HCV core 
protein in controlling viral RNA abundance and miR-122 functions through miR-122 
stability modulation.

INTRODUCTION: Since 2007, the German Standing Vaccination Committee recommends 
HPV vaccination for girls aged 12-17 with a 2- (Cervarix¬Æ) or 4-valent 
(Gardasil¬Æ) vaccine. A 9-valent vaccine (Gardasil 9¬Æ) recently received a 
European market authorization in 2015.
METHODS: A dynamic transmission model was calibrated to the German setting and 
used to estimate costs and QALYs associated with vaccination strategies.
RESULTS: Compared to the current vaccination program, the 9-valent vaccine 
extended to boys shows further reductions of 24% in the incidence of cervical 
cancer, 30% and 14% in anal cancer for males and females, as well as over a 
million cases of genital warts avoided after 100¬†years. The new strategy is 
associated with an ICER of 22,987‚Ç¨ per QALY gained, decreasing to 329‚Ç¨ when 
considering the vaccine switch for girls-only.
CONCLUSION: Universal vaccination with the 9-valent vaccine can yield 
significant health benefits when compared to the current program.

OBJECTIVE: In adult congenital heart disease (ACHD), mental health status and 
quality of life become important issues due to improved life expectancy. Current 
literature provides conflicting data regarding mental health status in ACHD. 
Furthermore, none of the studies so far compared prevalence rates with a matched 
control group.
METHODS: The prevalence of mental disorders was assessed in 150 ACHD using a 
structured interview, and compared to 12-months estimates of the general German 
population. Quality of life (QoL) was measured with World Health Organization 
Quality of Life instrument. Furthermore, we related the diagnostic results of 
widely used screening instruments for depression (Beck Depression Inventory-2; 
BDI-2; Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale; HADS) with clinical diagnoses, to 
receive optimal sensitivity and specificity values.
RESULTS: The prevalence of psychiatric disorders was significantly higher in 
ACHD than in the general population (48.0%; CI: 44.7-60.0 vs. 35.7%; CI: 
33.5-37.9). Mood (30.7%; CI: 24.0-38.0 vs. 10.7%;CI:9.4-12.0) and anxiety 
disorders (28.0%; CI:22.0-36.7 vs. 16.8%; CI: 15.0-18.6) were the leading causes 
of psychiatric illness. Sixteen of 150 ACHD patients (10.7%) received specific 
treatment for psychiatric disorders before entering the study. Overall quality 
of life was independently and negatively associated with a diagnosis of major 
depression (p<0.001), alcohol dependency (p=0.004), nicotine dependency 
(p=0.036), and NYHA class (p=0.007). Accuracy of the HADS-D and BDI-2 as 
screening instruments was moderate (AUC 0.60-0.81), depending on the cut-off 
score used.
CONCLUSIONS: Psychiatric disorders, particularly mood and anxiety disorders are 
significantly more frequent in ACHD compared to the general population. However, 
these disorders are rarely diagnosed resulting in under treatment and loss of 
quality of life. Quality of life is independently associated with the existence 
of mood, anxiety and substance use disorders. When self-rating instruments 
(BDI-2, HADS) are used as screening instruments in ACHD care, lower cut-off 
values are recommended.

Listeria monocytogenes is a Gram-positive bacillus and facultative intracellular 
bacterium whose transmission occurs mainly through the consumption of 
contaminated food, L. monocytogenes invades the host cells using various protein 
and can escape to the human T-cell immune system by cell-to-cell spreading. If 
the infection is not controlled at the stage in which the bacterium is in the 
liver, for instance, due to a severe immunodepression, a secondary bacteraemia 
can be developed and L. monocytogenes reaches the preferred sites transgressing 
the blood-brain barrier or the placental barrier. Individuals with T-cell 
dysfunction, such as pregnant women, the elderly, and those receiving
