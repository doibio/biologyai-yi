Almost all diseases have a genetic basis. However, several disorders stem from a 
combination of genes and environmental conditions. In the present study, 
databases including PubMed, Scopus and Google scholar were searched and reviewed 
and those relevant studies that investigated the association between 
environmental and genetic factors with the incidence of diseases were extracted 
and used. At the final step, it is concluded that in many cases, disorders have 
a multifactorial etiology. Having a gene related to a specific disorder is not 
the only reason for contracting the disease. Both genes and environmental 
factors play a role in human disease etiology. Everything outside of DNA, may 
affect health and even in many people with a positive family history of a 
specific disorder, environmental factors can facilitate or prevent the 
occurrence of the disease. Therefore, living a healthy lifestyle is important in 
reducing exposure to diseases, and long-life expectancy.

Myosins are essential components of organelle trafficking in all the eukaryotic 
cells. Myosin driven movement plays a vital role in the development of pollen 
tubes, root hairs and root tips of flowering plants. The present research 
characterized the myosin genes in Arabidopsis thaliana and Helianthus annuus by 
using different computational tools. We discovered a total of 50 myosin genes 
and their splice variants in both pant species. Phylogenetic analysis indicated 
that myosin genes were divided into four subclasses. Chromosomal location 
revealed that myosin genes were located on all five chromosomes in A. thaliana, 
whereas they were present on nine chromosomes in H. annuus. Conserved motifs 
showed that conserved regions were closely similar within subgroups. Gene 
structure analysis showed that Atmyosin2.2 and Atmyosin2.3 had the highest 
number of introns/exons. Gene ontology analysis indicated that myosin genes were 
involved in vesicle transport along actin filament and cytoskeleton trafficking. 
Expression analysis showed that expression of myosin genes was higher during the 
flowering stage as compared to the seedling and budding stages. Tissue specific 
expression indicated that HanMYOSIN11.2, HanMYOSIN16.2 were highly expressed in 
stamen, whereas HanMYOSIN 2.2, HanMYOSIN 12.1 and HanMYOSIN 17.1 showed higher 
expression in nectary. This study enhance our understanding the function of 
myosins in plant development, and forms the basis for future research about the 
comparative genomics of plant myosin in other crop plants.

BACKGROUND: As a population, living kidney donors have a longer life expectancy 
than the general population. This is generally thought to be an artifact of 
selection, as only healthy individuals are allowed to donate, and the operative 
mortality and risk of subsequent renal failure are very low. However, there may 
also be an additional benefit to the process, as the donor evaluation may 
uncover an early occult cancer or a potentially serious medical problem. While 
these problems may preclude donation, they may be lifesaving, as they are likely 
to be diagnosed and treated before the donor develops symptoms.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We looked at the incidence of occult cancer and other 
previously undiagnosed medical problems including renal disease, diabetes, 
hypertension, cardiac disease, and hepatitis C, in individuals volunteering to 
become a kidney donor at our center who proceeded with the evaluation between 
January 1, 1996 and May 31, 2011.
RESULTS: Of 4088 potential donors, 19 (.46%) were discovered to have an 
unsuspected cancer, and 286 (7%) were found to have a previously undiagnosed 
medical problem.
CONCLUSIONS: The living donor evaluation may lead to the early diagnosis of a 
life-threatening illness. This should be considered as one of the potential 
benefits of living donation.

PURPOSE: For controlling symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD) together with 
treating additional comorbidities, patients often face complex medication 
regimens, with suboptimal adherence, drug-related problems, and diminished 
therapy efficacy as a common consequence. A medication review could potentially 
tackle these issues, among others by optimizing drug treatment. Even if no 
change in clinical outcomes is observed, this intervention might decrease health 
care costs by reducing drug-related problems and hospital admissions. This study 
aimed to gain more insight in the health benefits and costs of a structured 
medication review (SMR) in PD.
METHODS: A cost-utility analysis was performed, based on a multicenter 
randomized controlled trial with 202 PD patients with polypharmacy. The 
intervention group received an SMR, whereas the control group received usual 
care. The intervention effect after 6 months of follow-up was presented as 
incremental quality-adjusted life years (QALY) using the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire. 
Costs were based on real-world data. Missing data was imputed using multiple 
imputation techniques. Bootstrapping was used to estimate the uncertainty in all 
health and economic outcomes.
RESULTS: The QALY gain in the intervention group compared to the control group 
was - 0.011 (95% CI - 0.043; 0.020). Incremental costs were €433 (95% CI - 873; 
1687). When adapting a willingness-to-pay threshold of €20,000/QALY and 
€80,000/QALY, the probability of SMRs being cost-effective was 18% and 30%, 
respectively.
CONCLUSION: A community pharmacist-led SMR in PD patients in the current setting 
shows no apparent benefit and is not cost-effective after 6 months, compared to 
usual care.

Low socioeconomic status (SES) is associated with early onset of chronic 
diseases and reduced life expectancy. The involvement of neighborhood-level 
factors in defining cancer risk and outcomes for marginalized communities has 
been an active area of research for decades. Yet, the biological processes that 
underlie the impact of SES on chronic health conditions, such as cancer, remain 
poorly understood. To date, limited studies have shown that chronic life stress 
is more prevalent in low SES communities and can affect important molecular 
processes implicated in tumor biology such as DNA methylation, inflammation, and 
immune response. Further efforts to elucidate how neighborhood-level factors 
function physiologically to worsen cancer outcomes for disadvantaged communities 
are underway. This review provides an overview of the current literature on how 
socioenvironmental factors within neighborhoods contribute to more aggressive 
tumor biology, specifically in Black U.S. women and men, including the impact of 
environmental pollutants, neighborhood deprivation, social isolation, structural 
racism, and discrimination. We also summarize commonly used methods to measure 
deprivation, discrimination, and structural racism at the neighborhood-level in 
cancer health disparities research. Finally, we offer recommendations to adopt a 
multi-faceted intersectional approach to reduce cancer health disparities and 
develop effective interventions to promote health equity.

Down syndrome is the main genetic cause of intellectual disability. Many studies 
describe the clinical characteristics of DS patients; however, few have 
investigated the clinical profile of mothers who have children with DS. Advanced 
maternal age (≥ 35 years old) is a risk factor for DS. Although there is an 
overall increase in pregnancies among women with advanced maternal age, there is 
still a lack of awareness of the increased risk of aneuploidy. Here, we reported 
the clinical and epidemiological profile of DS children and their mothers in a 
public reference hospital in the State of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. For data 
collection, we performed a face-to-face interview guided by a structured 
questionnaire with closed-ended questions. A total of 344 individuals, 172 
mothers and their DS children, were included in this study. Our results show 
that 56% of the mothers sampled were ≥ 35 years of age at childbirth. Although 
98% of them received prenatal care, only 4% obtained a prenatal diagnosis of DS. 
Most mothers reported not drinking alcohol or smoking cigarettes during 
pregnancy. Furthermore, 91% of women took prenatal vitamins and supplements; 
however, 47% were not aware of their benefits for a healthy pregnancy. Given the 
strict correlation between advanced maternal age and DS, prenatal care should 
include genetic counseling for women over 35 years of age. This study highlights 
the importance of prenatal care and the urgent need for better DS screening 
allowing for immediate postnatal care, positively impacting the life expectancy 
of these patients.

BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer is the fourth most common cause of cancer death in 
women worldwide. Smoking is one of the risk factors for cervical cancer. 
Understanding the global distribution of the disease burden of cervical cancer 
attributable to smoking and related changes is of clear significance for the 
prevention and control of cervical cancer in key populations and for tobacco 
control. As far as we know, research on the burden of cervical cancer 
attributable to smoking is lacking.
OBJECTIVE: We estimated the disease burden and mortality of cervical cancer 
attributable to smoking and related trends over time at the global, regional, 
and national levels.
METHODS: Data were obtained from the Global Burden of Disease study website. 
Age-standardized rates were used to facilitate comparisons of mortality and 
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) at different levels. The estimated annual 
percentage change (EAPC) was used to assess trends in the age-standardized 
mortality rate (ASMR) and the age-standardized DALY rate (ASDR). A Pearson 
correlation analysis was used to evaluate correlations between the 
sociodemographic index and the age-standardized rates.
RESULTS: In 2019, there were 30,136.65 (95% uncertainty interval [UI]: 
14,945.09-49,639.87) cervical cancer-related deaths and 893,735.25 (95% UI 
469,201.51-1,440,050.85) cervical cancer-related DALYs attributable to smoking. 
From 1990 to 2019, the global burden of cervical cancer attributable to smoking 
showed a decreasing trend around the world; the EAPCs for ASMR and ASDR were 
-2.11 (95% CI -2.16 to -2.06) and -2.22 (95% CI -2.26 to -2.18), respectively. 
In terms of age characteristics, in 2019, an upward trend was observed for age 
in the mortality of cervical cancer attributable to smoking. Analysis of the 
trend in DALYs with age revealed an initially increasing and then decreasing 
trend. From 1990 to 2019, the burden of disease in different age groups showed a 
downward trend. Among 204 countries, 180 countries showed downward trends, 10 
countries showed upward trends, and the burden was stable in 14 countries. The 
Pearson correlation analysis revealed a significant negative correlation between 
sociodemographic index and the age-standardized rates of cervical cancer 
attributable to smoking (ρ=-0.228, P<.001 for ASMR and ρ=-0.223, P<.001 for 
ASDR).
CONCLUSIONS: An increase over time in the absolute number of cervical cancer 
deaths and DALYs attributable to smoking and a decrease over time in the ASMR 
and ASDR for cervical cancer attributable to smoking were observed in the 
overall population, and differences in these variables were also observed 
between countries and regions. More attention should be paid to cervical cancer 
prevention and screening in women who smoke, especially in low- and 
middle-income countries.

Gun violence is a leading cause of premature death and a driver of racial 
disparities in life expectancy in the United States. Community-based 
interventions are the foremost policy strategy for reducing gun violence without 
exacerbating harm associated with criminal justice approaches. However, little 
is known about the interventionist workforce. In 2021, we used a 
researcher-guided survey to obtain a near-census of Chicago violence 
interventionists (n = 181, 93% response rate). Workers were mostly male (84%) 
and Black (80.9%), with a mean age of 43.6 years. Interventionists commonly 
experienced work-related exposure to violence and direct victimization. A total 
of 59.4% witnessed someone being shot at, whereas 32.4% witnessed a victim 
struck by gunfire. During work hours, 19.6% were shot at, while 2.2% were 
nonfatally shot. Single-year rates of gun violence victimization exceeded those 
of Chicago police. Results suggest that investment in community violence 
intervention should prioritize improving worker safety and reducing violence 
exposure while developing support for vulnerable frontline practitioners.

Extensive consumption of cobalt in the chemical field such as for battery 
materials, alloy, pigments, and dyes has aggravated the pollution of cobalt both 
in food and the environment, and assays for its on-site monitoring are urgently 
demanded. Herein, we utilized enzyme dependence on metal cofactors to develop 
terminal transferase (TdT) as a recognition element, achieving a one-pot 
sensitive and specific assay for detecting cobalt pollution. We engineered a 
3'-OH terminus primer to improve the discrimination capacity of TdT for Co2+ 
from other bivalent cations. The TdT extension reaction amplified the 
recognition of Co2+ and yielded a limit of detection of 0.99 μM for Co2+ 
detection. Then, the TdT-based assay was designed to precisely detect cobalt in 
food and agricultural soil samples. By end-measurement of fluorescence using a 
microplate reader, the multiplexing assay enabled the rapid screening of the 
peptide remover for cobalt pollution. The TdT-based assay can be a promising 
tool for cobalt pollution monitoring and control.

Human awareness of the need for health and wellness practices that enhance 
disease resilience has increased as a result of recent health risks. 
Plant-derived polysaccharides with biological activity are good candidates to 
fight diseases because of their low toxicity. Tinospora cordifolia (Willd.) 
Hook.f. & Thomson polysaccharides extract from different plant parts have been 
reported to possess significant biological activity such as anti-oxidant, 
anti-cancer, immunomodulatory, anti-diabetic, radioprotective and 
hepatoprotective. Several extraction and purification techniques have been used 
to isolate and characterize T. cordifolia polysaccharides. Along with hot-water 
extraction (HWE), other novel techniques like microwave-assisted extraction 
(MAE), ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE), pulsed electric field (PEF), 
supercritical-fluid extraction (SFE), and enzyme-assisted extraction (EAE) are 
used to extract T cordifolia polysaccharides. SFE is a revolutionary technology 
that gives the best yield and purity of low-molecular-weight polysaccharides. 
According to the findings, polysaccharides extracted and purified from T. 
cordifolia have a significant impact on their structure and biological activity. 
As a result, the methods of extraction, structural characterization, and 
biological activity of T. cordifolia polysaccharides are covered in this review.

We identified children diagnosed with kernicterus in the California Department 
of Developmental Services and estimated an incidence of 0.42 per 100 000 births 
from 1988 to 2014, significantly decreasing to 0.04 per 100 000 births after 
2009. We also examined national infant kernicterus mortality from 1979 to 2016 
using CDC data. It did not decrease significantly.

OBJECTIVES: Reliable and valid information on burden of road traffic injuries 
(RTIs) is essential for short-term and long-term planning. We designed the 
present study to describe the levels and trends of burden of RTIs in Iran from 
1990 to 2019.
METHODS: This is an observational epidemiological study. We used the Global 
Burden of Disease (GBD) 2019 estimates to report RTIs incidence, prevalence, 
mortality and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) by sex, age group and road 
user category in Iran and each of the 31 provinces from 1990 to 2019.
RESULTS: Age-standardised incidence, prevalence, death and DALY rates of RTIs 
decreased by 31.7% (95% uncertainty interval (UI): 29.4 to 33.9), 34.9% (33.8 to 
36.0), 57.7% (48.1 to 62.3) and 60.1% (51.7 to 65.2), respectively between 1990 
and 2019. The 2019 age-standardised DALY rates varied from smallest value in 
Tehran 303.8 (216.9 to 667.2) per 100 000 to largest value in Sistan-Baluchistan 
2286.8 (1978.1 to 2627.9) per 100 000. The burden of RTIs was mainly related to 
injuries sustained by drivers or passengers of motorised vehicles with three or 
more wheels and pedestrians' injuries, mostly affected males aged 15-29 years 
and individuals aged ≥70 years.
CONCLUSION: The reducing trend in the burden of RTIs in Iran possibly reflects 
the effectiveness of the intervention programmes. However, with regard to the 
Sustainable Development Goals the burden is still at an alarming level. Further 
reductions are necessary for specific road user groups such as adolescent and 
adult male drivers or passengers of motorised vehicles, also pedestrians aged 
≥70 years.

AIM: To investigate the gender and socioeconomic disparities in the global 
burden of chronic kidney disease (CKD) due to glomerulonephritis from 1990 to 
2019.
METHODS: Data were extracted from the global burden of diseases (GBD) 2019 
study, including incidence, prevalence and disability-adjusted life-years 
(DALYs). Estimated annual percentage changes (EAPCs) were calculated to quantify 
the temporal trends in age-standardized rate (ASR) of CKD due to 
glomerulonephritis. Paired t-test, paired Wilcoxon signed-rank test and Spearman 
correlation were performed to analyse the association and gender disparity in 
CKD due to glomerulonephritis.
RESULTS: Globally, incident cases of CKD due to glomerulonephritis increased 81% 
from 9 557 397 in 1990 to 17 308 071 in 2019. The age-standardized incidence 
rate increased by 1.47 compared with 1990 and DALYs increased by 1.35 compared 
with 1990 (per 100 000). The number of patients with CKD due to 
glomerulonephritis in low-middle SDI (3829917) and middle SDI (6268817) regions 
accounts for more than 55% of the total cases. CKD due to glomerulonephritis 
caused a higher burden including the incidence rate (p < .0001) and DALY rate 
(p < .0001) in men compared to women. The age-standardized DALY rate was 
negatively correlated with SDI (ρ = -0.64, p < .001). In the analysis of risk 
factors for DALYs, male individuals had a larger burden of hypertension, high 
BMI and high sodium diet in the DALY rates than female subjects.
CONCLUSION: The burden of CKD due to glomerulonephritis was more skewed towards 
developing and less developed economies and differed by gender, so certain 
nations should implement far more focused and targeted policies.

BACKGROUND: Despite rising interest in sex differences in dementia, it is 
unclear whether sex differences in dementia incidence and prevalence are 
apparent globally.
OBJECTIVE: We examine sex differences in incidence and prevalence of Any 
dementia, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and vascular dementia (VaD), and evaluate 
whether country-level indicators of gender inequality account for differences.
METHODS: Systematic review with meta-analysis was used to obtain estimates of 
incidence and prevalence of Any dementia, AD, and VaD using random effects 
meta-analysis, and population-based studies with clinical or validated dementia 
measures. Meta-regression was used to evaluate how country-specific factors of 
life expectancy, education, and gender differences in development, unemployment, 
and inequality indices influenced estimates.
RESULTS: We identified 205 eligible studies from 8,731 articles, representing 
998,187 participants across 43 countries. There were no sex differences in the 
incidence of Any dementia, AD, or VaD, except in the 90+ age group (women 
higher). When examined by 5-year age bands, the only sex difference in 
prevalence of Any dementia was in the 85+ group and there was no sex difference 
in VaD. AD was more prevalent in women at most ages. Globally, the overall 
prevalence of dementia in adults 65 + was higher for women (80.22/1000, 95% CI 
62.83-97.61) than men (54.86/1000, 95% CI 43.55-66.17). Meta-regression revealed 
that sex differences in Any dementia prevalence were associated with gender 
differences in life expectancy and in education.
CONCLUSION: Globally, there are no sex differences in age-specific dementia 
incidence, but prevalence of AD is higher in women. Country-level factors like 
life expectancy and gender differences in education may explain variability in 
sex differences.

Plant specific SHORT INTERNODES/STYLISH (SHI/STY) protein is a transcription 
factor involved in the formation and development of early lateral organs in 
plants. However, research on the SHI/STY protein family is not focused enough. 
In this article, we review recent studies on SHI/STY genes and explore the 
evolution and structure of SHI/STY. The biological functions of SHI/STYs are 
discussed in detail in this review, and the application of each biological 
function to modern agriculture is discussed. All SHI/STY proteins contain 
typical conserved RING-like zinc finger domain and IGGH domain. SHI/STYs are 
involved in the formation and development of lateral root, stem extension, leaf 
morphogenesis, and root nodule development. They are also involved in the 
regulation of pistil and stamen development and flowering time. At the same 
time, the regulation of some GA, JA, and auxin signals also involves these 
family proteins. For each aspect, unanswered or poorly understood questions were 
identified to help define future research areas. This review will provide a 
basis for further functional study of this gene family.

94 million people are blind or visually impaired globally, and cataract is the 
most common cause of blindness worldwide. However, most cases of blindness are 
avoidable. Cataract is associated with decreased quality of life and reduced 
life expectancy. Most cases of cataract occur after birth and share ageing and 
oxidative stress as primary causes, although several non-modifiable and 
modifiable risk factors can accelerate cataract formation. In most patients, 
phacoemulsification with intraocular lens implantation is the preferred 
treatment and is highly cost-effective. There has been an increase in the use of 
comprehensive cataract surgical services, including diagnoses, treatment 
referrals, and rehabilitation. However, global inequity in surgical service 
quality is still a limitation. Implementation of preoperative risk assessment, 
risk reduction strategies, and new surgical technologies have made cataract 
surgery possible at an earlier stage of cataract severity with the expectation 
of good refractive outcomes. The main challenge is making the service that is 
currently available to some patients accessible to all by use of universal 
health coverage.

BACKGROUND: Previous efforts to characterize the burden of peripheral artery 
disease (PAD) have focused on national populations. A need for a more detailed 
analysis of how PAD impacts the global population has been identified. Our 
objective was to study in greater detail the global burden of PAD, including its 
impact on mortality, over the past three decades.
METHODS: Using data and models from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries and 
Risk Factors Study, we estimated the prevalence, years of life lost, years lived 
with disability and disability-adjusted life-years (a measure accounting for 
incurred morbidity and mortality), attributable to PAD. We analyzed results over 
time and stratified by sex, age, and sociodemographic index (SDI) group. We 
compared PAD with other atherosclerosis-related conditions and assessed the 
contribution of risk factors to PAD disability-adjusted life-years.
RESULTS: We observed a 72% increase in the global prevalence of PAD from an 
estimated 65,764,499 persons in 1990 to 113,443,016 in 2019. Prevalence per 
100,000 persons increased 13% and the prevalence per 100,000 age-standardized 
decreased 22%. Similar patterns were seen for years of live lost, mortality, 
years lived with disability, and disability-adjusted life-years. The prevalence 
and disability were higher among women, whereas mortality and years of life lost 
were higher among men. Disease burden increased with increasing SDI. These 
increases in PAD were in contrast with global trends for the overall burden of 
ischemic heart disease and ischemic stroke, which had decreasing prevalence and 
disease-related mortality over the same time frame. Overall, only approximately 
55% of PAD disease burden could be attributed to identified risk factors, with 
tobacco use, diabetes, and hypertension being the three major contributors in 
all SDI groups.
CONCLUSIONS: The global prevalence and mortality associated with PAD has 
increased substantially, in contrast with other forms of ischemic cardiovascular 
disease. Globally, there is a growing need for vascular surgical resources to 
manage PAD, as well as public health efforts to address risk factors for this 
increasing health threat.

Hops' (Humulus lupulus L.) phytochemicals are well known for their bioactivity. 
In the present study, the functional properties of hop extract rich in β-acids, 
as potassium-salts structures (KBA), were investigated to develop a sustainable 
active food packaging. Polylactic acid (PLA)-based sheets were incorporated with 
increasing concentrations of hop extract (0.1-5 % w/w in terms of KBA) and 
characterized through performance and bioactive properties. KBA-added sheets 
presented decreased crystallinity and affected mechanical and thermal 
properties, especially with higher KBA amounts. The sheets' surface 
hydrophobicity gradually decreased by KBA-extract addition, while the water 
vapor permeability was not affected. A Fickian diffuse behavior and a better fit 
to application in fatty foods were observed during release tests. UV-blocking 
and antioxidant properties were improved by KBA incorporation. Furthermore, 
results from antibacterial assays revealed great susceptibility of 
Staphylococcus aureus and Listeria monocytogenes towards sheets added with 5 % 
of KBA. Moreover, the atomic force microscopy (AFM) observations revealed that 
KBA led to strong effects on the cell membranes of both bacteria, including 
disruption of membrane integrity and cell death. Therefore, this study is a sign 
of great prospects of hop β-acids use, as KBA compound, in the production of 
sustainable active packaging for safe food shelf-life extension.

BACKGROUND: The implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) has been proven to 
improve survival in adults with congenital heart disease (ACHD), but it is 
associated with a high rate of complications. We aimed to quantify the incidence 
of early (≤ 3 months; ECs) and late (> 3 months; LCs) complications in ACHD 
patients implanted with an ICD and to identify their clinical predictors.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 207 patients who had ICD follow-up at 
Toronto General Hospital from 1996 to 2019.
RESULTS: The most common diagnoses were tetralogy of Fallot (32.4%), 
dextro-transposition of the great arteries (17.9%), and congenital corrected 
transposition of the great arteries (13%). No intraprocedural complications were 
observed. Median follow-up was 3.4 years (IQR 0.1-23). 24 patients (12%) 
developed EC (4 hematomas, 20 lead dislodgements). A total of 56 LCs occurred 
(46% lead failure, 21% infection, 11% prophylactic lead extraction, 9% 
neurologic pain, 9% erosion, 4% other) with an incidence rate of LCs of 18% per 
5 person-years. Anatomic complexity (odds ratio 2.9; P = 0.02) and cardiac 
resynchronization therapy defibrillator implant (odds ratio 2.5; P = 0.04) were 
associated with ECs. Survival rates free from LCs were 92%, 86%, and 65%, 
respectively, after 1, 5, and 10 years. Presence of legacy leads (hazard ratio 
2.9; P = 0.006) and subpulmonary ejection fraction (5% increase, hazard ratio 
1.35; P = 0.031) were associated with LCs.
CONCLUSIONS: ACHD patients at risk of sudden cardiac death continue to benefit 
from newer device technology. However, these patients, particularly those with 
greater anatomic and device complexity, remain at increased risk of developing 
complications over their lifetime. Given the life expectancy of this population, 
careful consideration needs to be given when a device for primary prevention is 
being contemplated.
