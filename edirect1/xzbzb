BACKGROUND: Both aerobic training (AT) and resistance training (RT) have 
multidimensional health benefits for older adults including increased life 
expectancy and decreased risk of chronic diseases. However, the volume (i.e., 
frequency*time) of AT combined with RT in which untrained older adults can 
feasibly and safely participate remains unclear. Thus, our primary objective was 
to investigate the feasibility and safety of a high-volume exercise program 
consisting of twice weekly AT combined with twice weekly RT (i.e., four times 
weekly exercise) on a group of untrained older adults. In addition, we 
investigated the effects of the program on physical function, aerobic capacity, 
muscular strength, and explored factors related to participant adherence.
METHODS: We recruited eight inactive older adults (65+ years) to participate in 
a 6-week, single-group pre-post exercise intervention, consisting of 2 days/week 
of AT plus 2 days/week of progressive RT for 6 weeks. We recorded program 
attendance and monitored for adverse events during the course of the program. 
Participants were tested at both baseline and follow-up on the following: (1) 
physical function (i.e., timed-up-and-go test (TUG) and short physical 
performance battery (SPPB)), (2) aerobic capacity (VO2max) using the modified 
Bruce protocol; and (3) muscular strength on the leg press and lat pull-down. 
Post intervention, we performed qualitative semi-structured interviews of all 
participants regarding their experiences in the exercise program. We used these 
responses to examine themes that may affect continued program adherence to a 
high-volume exercise program.
RESULTS: We recorded an average attendance rate of 83.3% with the lowest 
attendance for one session being five out of eight participants; no significant 
adverse events occurred. Significant improvements were observed for SPPB score 
(1.6; 95% CI: [0.3, 2.9]), VO2max (8.8 ml/kg/min; 95% CI: [2.8, 14.8]), and lat 
pull-down strength (11.8 lbs; 95% CI: [3.3, 20.2]). Qualitative results revealed 
two themes that promote older adults' adherence: (1) convenience of the program 
and (2) the social benefits of exercise.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest untrained older adults can be successful at 
completing twice weekly AT combined with twice weekly progressive RT; however, 
these exercise programs should be group-based in order to maintain high 
adherence.

Objective: The aim of the present study was to elucidate the influence of 
self-rated masticatory ability on independent living in community-dwelling older 
adults. Method: A total of 1,377 subjects aged 65 and over who lived in Kumamoto 
City, Japan were participated in a survey to investigate critical factors for 
self-reliance in older adults. In this study, we defined independent life in 
older adults as self-perceived adequate health without long-term care 
certification. Logistic regression analysis was used to assess self-perceived 
masticatory ability in relation to the independent life. Results: The population 
with adequate self-rated masticatory ability included a significantly higher 
proportion of subjects with good self-perceived health without long-term care 
(72.7%) than the remaining subjects (27.3%). A logistic regression analysis 
revealed that there was significant relationship between subjective adequate 
mastication and living a self-reliant healthy life (p < .001). Conclusion: Our 
results showed that satisfactory masticatory function was positively related to 
a self-reliant life with subjective healthy conditions in community-dwelling 
older adults, which was associated with an extended active life expectancy.

Objective: To create personalized estimates of future health and ability status 
for older adults. Method: Data came from the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS), 
a large longitudinal study. Outcomes included years of life, years of healthy 
life (based on self-rated health), years of able life (based on activities of 
daily living), and years of healthy and able life. We developed regression 
estimates using the demographic and health characteristics that best predicted 
the four outcomes. Internal and external validity were assessed. Results: A 
prediction equation based on 11 variables accounted for about 40% of the 
variability for each outcome. Internal validity was excellent, and external 
validity was satisfactory. The resulting CHS Healthy Life Calculator (CHSHLC) is 
available at http://healthylifecalculator.org. Conclusion: CHSHLC provides a 
well-documented estimate of future years of healthy and able life for older 
adults, who may use it in planning for the future.

Singapore's life expectancy at birth and at age 65 continues to improve. 
Although this is a positive development, it is necessary to understand how much 
of this increased life expectancy is spent with and without mobility 
limitations. This research uses the latest round of the National Survey of 
Senior Citizens to examine the situation in 2011 and the possible changes that 
may have occurred since the last survey in 2005. It seeks to add to earlier 
research in this area in Singapore and uses the prevalence-based Sullivan method 
to calculate lifetime free of mobility limitations for this population. 
Pertinent conclusions drawn from this research include evidence pointing to 
changing prevalence rates among the older adult population and observations that 
suggest the possibility of a compression of morbidity for this population in 
2011 compared with an expansion of morbidity observed in the previous survey 
conducted in 2005. The research also shows that women continue to be 
disadvantaged as they age compared with men.

PURPOSE: Because of the improvement of medical therapy and the corresponding 
increase in life expectancy, orthopaedic surgeons are obliged to perform more 
wide resections rather than intramedullary stabilization nailing for patients 
affected by tumours of the hip compared to the past. Wide resection often causes 
joint instability, so prosthetic reconstruction presents a higher risk of 
dislocation than in primary osteoarthritis cases. The aim of the present paper 
is to classify the indications for the dual mobility cup (DMC) hip prosthesis 
based on the anatomic structures involved in the disease and to analyse the 
rationale to reduce the risk of dislocation.
METHODS: Indications were analyzed and classified based on all the cases in 
which the DMC prosthesis was used for reconstruction after hip resection in an 
oncological research hospital.
RESULTS: Four classes of indications were identified; for classes I and IV the 
indication for DMC prosthesis can be considered strong; for classes II and III 
the indications must be evaluated considering the specific case, based on life 
expectancy, performance status, presence of osteoarthritis, and availability of 
adjuvant local therapies. When the DMC prosthesis is indicated, the cup should 
always be cemented, either alone or with augmentation techniques, to decrease 
the risk of mobilization due to local disease progression.
CONCLUSIONS: DMC can be a valid alternative in reconstruction of the hip after 
tumor removal; nevertheless, prospective, randomized studies are necessary to 
verify the real dislocation rate based on the entity of resection.

OBJECTIVE: To examine whether response to first treatment with 
onabotulinumtoxinA is predictive of long-term treatment outcome in patients with 
neurogenic detrusor overactivity (NDO).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with NDO who were enrolled in a 3-year extension 
study (after a 52-week phase III study) received onabotulinumtoxinA 'as needed', 
based on fulfilment of prespecified retreatment criteria. This post hoc analysis 
included patients who received only the 200-U dose during the phase III and 
extension studies. Data on mean percent reduction from baseline in urinary 
incontinence (UI) episodes at week 6 after the first treatment were analysed, 
and the patients were stratified into three response groups: <50% (group 1; n = 
33), 50-74% (group 2; n = 23), and 75-100% (group 3; n = 139). The following 
were assessed: change from baseline in mean percent UI reduction; proportions of 
patients who achieved ≥50% and 100% UI reduction after each subsequent 
treatment, and patients who achieved ≥50% UI reduction after all subsequent 
treatments; change from baseline in Incontinence Quality of Life (I-QOL) total 
summary score; and the proportion of patients who achieved or exceeded the 
minimally important difference (MID; +11 points) in I-QOL score. Adverse events 
(AEs) were also assessed.
RESULTS: The majority of the patients (83.1%; 162/195) experienced a ≥50% UI 
reduction after onabotulinumtoxinA treatment 1. Baseline characteristics were 
largely similar across the groups. After treatment 1, the mean percent reduction 
in UI remained consistent in subsequent treatments 2-6 for patients in response 
group 2 (range: 64.5-83.5%) and group 3 (range: 79.4-88.0%), but increased for 
those in the low response group (range: 36.3-60.3%). After treatment 1, the 
proportion of patients who achieved ≥50% reduction in UI episodes was consistent 
with subsequent treatments 2-6 in group 2 (range: 75.0-100%) and group 3 (range: 
87.3-97.1%), but increased in the low response group (range: 48.3-72.7%). Even 
among those who achieved a low response after treatment 1, 37.9% of patients 
achieved ≥50% UI reduction in all subsequent treatments. Improvements in I-QOL 
scores in groups 2 and 3 were consistently 2-3 times the MID. In the low 
response group, at least 50% of the patients achieved or exceeded the MID with 
treatments 2-6. AEs were similar across all response groups and consistent 
across repeated treatments.
CONCLUSION: Patients with NDO with a ≥50% UI reduction after their first 
onabotulinumtoxinA treatment continued to experience consistent improvements in 
UI and quality of life with subsequent treatments over the duration of 4 years. 
A <50% UI reduction after first treatment did not necessarily predict low 
response with subsequent treatments. Thus, these results underscore the 
importance of attempting at least a second treatment with onabotulinumtoxinA 
before deeming patients unsuitable for onabotulinumtoxinA therapy.

BACKGROUND: Fibromyalgia (FM) is a disease with symptoms that significantly 
limit the life of affected patients. Earlier studies have shown that the 
application of self-myofascial release provides benefits in variables such as 
fatigue, range of motion (ROM) or perceived muscle pain in a healthy population. 
Despite this, the self-myofascial release technique has not yet been used in 
people with FM. This study aimed to find out the benefits of applying a 
self-myofascial release program on health-related quality of life in people with 
FM.
METHODS: Sixty-six participants with FM were randomized into two groups, 
intervention (N.=33) and control (N.=33). The intervention group (IG) 
participated in the self-myofascial release program for twenty weeks. The study 
assessed the impact of a self-myofascial release program on cervical spine, 
shoulder and hip ROM and self-reported disease impact. Two measurements were 
performed, one at baseline (preintervention) and one postintervention. Two-way 
mixed-effect (between-within) ANOVA was used for the statistical analysis.
RESULTS: Significant changes (P<0.05) were achieved between the two measurements 
and between groups for final Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ-S) Score and 
for five of its seven subscales, including: days per week feeling good, pain 
intensity, fatigue, stiffness and depression/sadness, as well as all the ROM 
variables evaluated (neck flexion, neck extension, lateral neck flexion and 
rotation (bilateral), shoulder flexion and abduction and hip abduction) 
excluding hip flexion.
CONCLUSIONS: The application of a self-myofascial release program can improve 
the health-related quality of life of people with FM, provided that regular, 
structured practice is carried out.

[Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome - two sides of the same coin].

[Article in Czech]

Páleníková P, Adamcová M, Šturdík I, Ftáčniková B, Copáková L, Payer J.

Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome (VHL) is a rare genetic disease. Its incidence is 1 : 
36,000, there is the familial occurrence in 80 % of cases , the remaining cases 
are de novo mutations. The disease is caused by the highly penetrant mutations 
in the VHL gene (3p25.3) and is characterized by the occurrence of benign and 
malignant neoplasms. The most common VHL tumors are the tumors of the retina, 
brain and spinal hemangioblastomas, renal cell carcinoma, pheochromocytoma, 
endolymfatic sac tumors and pancreatic tumors and cysts. The mean age of the VHL 
patients during the diagnosis is 20-40 years. The diagnosis can be confirmed by 
a positive family history and the presence of one of the typical tumor. In case 
of no family history, the diagnosis has to be assessed by the presence of the 
multiple tumors. The clinical signs and prognosis of VHL depend on the location 
and extent of the tumors. The life expectancy is 50 years. The most common 
causes of death are complications of the renal cancer and the brain tumors. The 
treatment requires a multidisciplinary collaboration through the whole life of 
patients. This 2 cases report we demonstrate the differences among the patients 
with de novo mutations disease and the patient with familial incidence.Key 
words: pheochromocytoma - renal cell carcinoma - von Hippel-Lindau syndrome.

PURPOSE: Low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH) followed by vitamin K antagonists 
(VKAs) are the current standard treatment of acute venous thromboembolism (VTE) 
and prevention of recurrent VTE. The direct oral anticoagulant apixaban was 
recently found noninferior in efficacy and superior in preventing major bleeding 
compared with LMWH/VKAs in the AMPLIFY (Apixaban for the Initial Management of 
Pulmonary Embolism and Deep-Vein Thrombosis as First-Line Therapy) trial. The 
objective of this study was to calculate the cost-effectiveness of apixaban 
compared with LMWH/VKA in the treatment of acute VTE and prevention of recurrent 
VTE in the Netherlands.
METHODS: A Markov model was designed to simulate a cohort of 1,000 VTE patients 
receiving either apixaban or LMWH/VKA. Transition probabilities, costs, and 
utilities were obtained from the AMPLIFY trial and other literature. The 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated from the societal 
perspective; therefore, the model included both direct (inside and outside the 
health care sector) and indirect costs. In the univariate and probabilistic 
sensitivity analyses (PSAs) the robustness of the results was tested, and 
various additional scenario analyses were conducted.
FINDINGS: In the base-case analysis, apixaban saved €236 and 0.044 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and 0.039 LYs were gained compared with 
LMWH/VKA. In the univariate sensitivity analysis the model appeared to be 
robust. The results of 2,000 iterations in the PSA found that the probability of 
apixaban being cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of €20,000/QALY 
was 100% and cost-saving was 94%. The scenario of 18-month treatment duration 
was the only scenario not indicating cost-savings with an ICER of €425/QALY.
IMPLICATIONS: In acute anticoagulation use apixaban was found to be cost-saving. 
A longer anticoagulation period (18 months) resulted in a higher difference in 
drug costs, indicating a higher ICER. The cost-effectiveness of long-term or 
life-long use should be examined in future research.

Slovakia: Health System Review.

and Policies.

This analysis of the Slovak health system reviews recent developments in 
organization and governance, health financing, health-care provision, health 
reforms and health system performance. The health care system in Slovakia is 
based on universal coverage, compulsory health insurance, a basic benefit 
package and a competitive insurance model with selective contracting of health 
care providers. Containment of health spending became a major policy goal after 
the 2008 financial crisis. Health spending stabilized after 2010 but remains 
well below European averages. Some health indicators, such as life expectancy, 
healthy life years and avoidable deaths are worrisome. Furthermore, weak 
hospital management, high numbers of unused acute beds, overprescribing 
pharmaceuticals, and poor gatekeeping of the system all lead to over-utilization 
of services and system inefficiency. This suggests substantial room for 
improvement in delivery of care, especially for primary and long-term care. 
Additionally, there is inequity in the distribution of health providers, 
resulting in lengthy travelling distances and waiting times for patients. Given 
the ageing workforce, this trend is likely to continue. Current strategic 
documents and reform efforts aim to address the lack of efficiency and 
accountability. There has been a strong will to tackle these challenges but this 
has often been hindered by a lack of political consensus over issues such as the 
role of the state, the appropriate role of market mechanisms and profits, as 
well as the extent of out-of-pocket payments. Successive governments have taken 
different positions on these issues since the establishment of the current 
health system in 2002, and major reforms remain to be implemented.

The complexity and diversity of a neural network requires regulated elongation 
and branching of axons, as well as the formation of synapses between neurons. In 
the present study we explore the role of AP-2, a key endocytic adaptor protein 
complex, in the development of rat hippocampal neurons. We found that the loss 
of AP-2 during the early stage of development resulted in impaired axon 
extension and failed maturation of the axon initial segment (AIS). Normally the 
AIS performs two tasks in concert, stabilizing neural polarity and generating 
action potentials. In AP-2 silenced axons polarity is established, however there 
is a failure to establish action potential firing. Consequently, this impairs 
activity-driven Ca2+ influx and exocytosis at nerve terminals. In contrast, 
removal of AP-2 from older neurons does not impair axonal growth or signaling 
and synaptic function. Our data reveal that AP-2 has important roles in 
functional axogenesis by proper extension of axon as well as the formation of 
AIS during the early step of neurodevelopment.

OBJECTIVES: To determine the lifetime social value of using the 
guideline-recommended vaccines for children born in the United States in 2009.
STUDY DESIGN: This study utilized an economic model with parameter values 
sourced from clinical and observational data, as well as the literature.
METHODS: The model quantified the health effects of routine vaccination for 14 
diseases in terms of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) saved. The health 
effects were then valued by applying an economic value of a QALY. Producers' 
profits were estimated using data on vaccine prices, profit margins, and the 
number of vaccines administrated in the 2009 US birth cohort. The costs of 
producing the vaccines were subtracted from the value of the health effects to 
yield the total social value of vaccination. The producers' and consumers' 
shares of this social value were calculated. Sensitivity analyses were conducted 
to determine how results depend on underlying parameter assumptions.
RESULTS: Estimates indicated that vaccination of this cohort will save 1.2 
million QALYs, relative to no vaccination. Of those health gains, 88% stemmed 
from reduced mortality and 12% from reduced morbidity. We estimated a social 
value of $184.1 billion from these gains, of which $3.4 billion accrues to 
manufacturers as profits, while $180.7 billion accrues to the rest of society. 
In sensitivity analysis, the total social value ranged from $40 billion to $675 
billion, and the manufacturers' share ranged from 0.3% to 11.5%.
CONCLUSIONS: Policy makers should account for this social value when considering 
policies affecting incentives to vaccinate and develop new vaccines.

BACKGROUND: Healthy life expectancy (HLE) is used as one of the primary 
objectives of fundamental health promotion plans and social development plans. 
Activity limitation is used to calculate HLE, but little study has been done to 
identify determinants of activity limitation in order to extend HLE. The purpose 
of this study is to identify diseases and injuries that commonly lead to 
activity limitation to prioritize countermeasures against activity limitation.
METHODS: We used anonymous data from the 2007 "Comprehensive Survey of Living 
Conditions," collected by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare of Japan 
according to the Statistics Act, Article 36. We used logistic regression 
analyses and calculated odds ratios (ORs) after adjusting for age and sex. 
Limitation in daily activities was applied as the dependent variable, and each 
disease/injury was applied as an independent variable in this analysis. 
Furthermore, population attributable fractions (PAFs) were calculated.
RESULTS: The provided data included 98,789 subjects. We used data for 75,986 
valid subjects aged 12 years or older. The following diseases showed high PAF: 
backache (PAF 13.27%, OR 3.88), arthropathia (PAF 7.61%, OR 4.82), eye and 
optical diseases (PAF 6.39%, OR 2.01), and depression and other mental diseases 
(PAF 5.70%, OR 11.55). PAFs of cerebrovascular diseases, hypertension, and 
diabetes were higher for males than for females; on the other hand, PAFs of 
orthopedic diseases were higher among females.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that orthopedic diseases, ophthalmic diseases, 
and psychiatric diseases particularly affect activity limitation.

Diagnostic Accuracy of Handheld Dynamometry and 1-Repetition-Maximum Tests for 
Identifying Meaningful Quadriceps Strength Asymmetries.

Sinacore JA, Evans AM, Lynch BN, Joreitz RE, Irrgang JJ, Lynch AD.

Study Design Clinical measurement, cross-sectional. Background Quadriceps 
deficits are common in individuals with knee joint impairments and impact 
functional and quality-of-life outcomes. Quadriceps strength symmetry influences 
clinical decisions after knee injury. Isometric electromechanical dynamometry 
(ISO-ED) is the gold standard for measuring symmetry, but is not available in 
all clinical settings. Objectives To compare concurrent validity of handheld 
dynamometry and 1-repetition-maximum leg press, knee extension from 90° to 0°, 
and knee extension from 90° to 45° to that of ISO-ED in identifying meaningful 
quadriceps strength deficits. Methods Fifty-six participants with knee joint 
impairments completed ISO-ED and 4 alternative measures of quadriceps strength 
symmetry in a single session. Absolute agreement of alternative measures with 
ISO-ED was calculated with intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs). Clinical 
agreement values at thresholds of 80% and 90% symmetry were compared between the 
alternatives and ISO-ED. Results Knee extension from 90° to 45° (ICC = 0.67) and 
handheld dynamometry (ICC = 0.70) had the greatest ICCs. Clinical agreement was 
also best for these measures for 80% symmetry (κ = 0.56 and 0.55, respectively) 
and 90% symmetry (κ = 0.19 and 0.33, respectively). Conclusion Handheld 
dynamometry and 1-repetition-maximum testing of knee extension from 90° to 45° 
are fair alternatives, although symmetry is typically overestimated. Receiver 
operating characteristic analysis identified alternative measure thresholds that 
correlated with the 80% and 90% symmetry thresholds on the ISO-ED. Clinicians 
should use more stringent symmetry values for these alternative tests to 
increase the probability that individuals have a minimum ISO-ED symmetry of 80% 
or 90%. J Orthop Sports Phys Ther 2017;47(2):97-107.

BACKGROUND: The 1000s of people who die from cancer each year have become one of 
the leading causes of death among the Chilean population, placing it as the 
second cause of death in the region of Valparaiso between 1997 and 2003. 
Statistics have provided different measures regarding the life expectancy of 
cancer patients which have resulted in being useful to establish courses of 
action for prevention and treatment plans to follow.
METHODS: Data was extracted from the cancer module of the Epidemiology 
Assistance System (SADEPI for its initials in Spanish) which stores information 
about cancer cases in the provinces of Valparaiso and Petorca. The survival 
period is defined as the difference in days between the date of occurrence and 
the date of death of the patient by separating the data into quartiles.
RESULTS: The more frequent cancers in the region of Valparaiso behave similarly 
to global behaviours of the disease. The majority of affected patients are 
around 65 years of age which progressively lowers its occurrence in younger 
adults under the age of 45.
CONCLUSIONS: Further efforts are required for early detection and timely access 
to treatment for cancer patients. Statistics are an important support in 
achieving this.

Ageing with Muscular Disease.

Martinsen B(1), Dreyer P(1).

(1)Section of Nursing, Department of Public Health, Faculty of Health, Aarhus 
University, Aarhus, Denmark.

BACKGROUND: The demographic development with an ageing population is predicted 
to be the next global public health challenge. Advances in medicine and the 
socioeconomic development have reduced mortality and morbidity due to infectious 
conditions and non-communicable diseases. The increase in longevity will not be 
restricted to healthy people.
OBJECTIVE: To understand how people with muscular diseases experience ageing.
METHOD: A literature review was conducted using the Matrix Method developed by 
Garrard (2007). This systematic method was used to identify, describe and 
interpret studies, irrespective of the methods applied. To avoid the exclusion 
of important sources, experiences and topics, we chose an integrative approach 
that accommodates the inclusion of studies with different methodologies. People 
with MD have gradually extended their life expectancy during the last 30 years. 
Thus, we reviewed the literature regarding MD and ageing without time limit.
RESULTS: We identified three themes: 1) Slowing down early 2) Accepting lifelong 
deterioration and 3) Striving for normality.
CONCLUSION: People with MD live in a field of tension between a feeling of 
autonomy and normality and difficulties coping with reduced physical abilities. 
Getting older accentuates this tension since the physical strength diminishes 
and it is harder to maintain autonomy. The bodily challenges may coincide with 
the end of the rehabilitation people living with MD have received. Seemingly, no 
age-related rehabilitation is offered, and people living with MD are thus at 
risk of an unnecessarily passive life.

The aim of the study was to determine the effects of various petroleum-derived 
substances, namely petrol, diesel fuel and spent engine oil, on life history 
traits and population dynamics of the black bean aphid Aphis fabae Scop. and on 
growth and chemical composition of its host plant Vicia faba L. Each substance 
was tested separately, using two concentrations (9 g kg-1 and 18 g kg-1). The 
experiment was conducted in four replications (four pots with five plants in 
each pot per treatment). Plants were cultivated in both control and contaminated 
soils. After six weeks from soil contamination and five weeks from sowing the 
seeds, observations of the effect of petroleum-derived substances on traits of 
three successive generations of aphids were conducted. Aphids were inoculated 
separately on leaves using cylindrical cages hermetically closed on both sides. 
Contamination of aphid occurred through its host plant. Results showed that all 
tested substances adversely affected A. fabae life history traits and population 
dynamics: extension of the prereproductive period, reduction of fecundity and 
life span, reduction of the population intrinsic growth rate. In broad bean, 
leaf, roots, and shoot growth was also impaired in most conditions, whereas 
nutrient and heavy metal content varied according to substances, their 
concentration, as well as plant part analysed. Results indicate that soil 
contamination with petroleum-derived substances entails far-reaching changes not 
only in organisms directly exposed to these pollutants (plants), but also 
indirectly in herbivores (aphids) and consequently provides information about 
potential negative effects on further links of the food chain, i.e., for 
predators and parasitoids.

OBJECTIVES: The birth process has been studied extensively in many human 
societies, yet little is known about this essential life history event in other 
primates. Here, we provide the most detailed account of behaviors surrounding 
birth for any wild nonhuman primate to date.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Over a recent ∼10-year period, we directly observed 15 
diurnal births (13 live births and 2 stillbirths) among geladas (Theropithecus 
gelada) at Guassa, Ethiopia. During each birth, we recorded the occurrence (or 
absence) of 16 periparturitional events, chosen for their potential to provide 
comparative evolutionary insights into the factors that shaped birth behaviors 
in humans and other primates.
RESULTS: We found that several events (e.g., adopting standing crouched 
positions, delivering infants headfirst) occurred during all births, while other 
events (e.g., aiding the infant from the birth canal, licking infants following 
delivery, placentophagy) occurred during, or immediately after, most births. 
Moreover, multiparas (n = 9) were more likely than primiparas (n = 6) to (a) 
give birth later in the day, (b) isolate themselves from nearby conspecifics 
while giving birth, (c) aid the infant from the birth canal, and (d) consume the 
placenta.
DISCUSSION: Our results suggest that prior maternal experience may contribute to 
greater competence or efficiency during the birth process. Moreover, face 
presentations (in which infants are born with their neck extended and their face 
appearing first, facing the mother) appear to be the norm for geladas. Lastly, 
malpresentations (in which infants are born in the occiput anterior position 
more typical of human infants) may be associated with increased mortality in 
this species. We compare the birth process in geladas to those in other primates 
(including humans) and discuss several key implications of our study for 
advancing understanding of obstetrics and the mechanism of labor in humans and 
nonhuman primates.

Microglia are widely accepted as surveillants in the central nervous system that 
are continually searching the local environment for signs of injury. Following 
an inflammatory situation, microglia alter their morphology, extend ramified 
processes, and undergo cell body hypertrophy. Extracellular nucleotides are 
recognized as a danger signal by microglia. ADP acting on P2Y12 receptors induce 
process extension of microglia thereby attracting microglia to the site of 
adenosine tri-phosphate/ADP leaking or release. However, the question whether 
ADP/P2Y12 receptor signaling directly stimulates the production or release of 
inducible factors such as cytokines remains unclear. In this study, we found 
that CC chemokine ligand 3 (CCL3) is induced by ADP-treated primary microglia. 
Pharmacological characterization using pertussis toxin, a P2Y12 receptor 
inhibitor, and a calcium chelator revealed that CCL3 induction was caused by 
P2Y12 receptor-mediated intracellular calcium elevation. Next, nuclear factor of 
activated T-cell dephosphorylation and nuclear translocalization were observed. 
Calcineurin, an inhibitor for nuclear factor of activated T cell, suppressed 
CCL3 induction. These data indicate that microglial P2Y12 receptors are utilized 
to trigger an acute inflammatory response in microglia via rapid CCL3 induction 
after ADP stimulation.

While the mass distribution of limbs is known to influence the metabolic energy 
consumed during locomotion, it remains unknown how the mass distribution of 
limbs may influence overall limb kinematics and whether the influence of limb 
mass distribution on limb kinematics differs between fore- and hindlimbs. To 
examine limb mass distribution's influence upon fore- and hindlimb kinematics, 
temporal stride parameters and swing phase joint kinematics were recorded from 
four dogs trotting on a treadmill with 0.5% and 1.0% body mass added to each 
limb, forelimbs alone, and hindlimbs alone, as well as with no added mass. Under 
all loading conditions, stride period did not differ between fore- and 
hindlimbs; however, forelimbs exhibited greater duty factors and stance 
durations, whereas hindlimbs exhibited greater swing durations, which may be 
related to the hindlimb's greater mass. Changes in forelimb joint and hip range 
of motion (RoM), flexion, and extension were subject to a high amount of 
kinematic plasticity among dogs. In contrast, for the knee and ankle, distally 
loading all four limbs or hindlimbs alone substantially increased joint RoM and 
flexion. Increased flexion of the knee and ankle has the potential to reduce the 
hindlimb's rotational inertia during swing phase. The differing response of 
fore- and hindlimbs with regard to joint kinematics is likely due to differences 
in their mass and mass distribution and differences in the physiological traits 
of fore- and hindlimb protractors and joint flexors.

BACKGROUND: Life expectancy is increasing continuously, which increases the 
likelihood of developing dementia or cancer. Both dementia and cancer are 
serious conditions that give manifold symptoms. The interaction of these 
conditions is however complex and less explored.
OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to identify the prevalence of cancer and 
differences regarding neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) and medication among 
nursing home (NH) patients with and without dementia and cancer.
METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study of Norwegian NH patients (N = 1825). 
Participants were categorized according to degree of dementia (Clinical Dementia 
Rating > 1) and cancer diagnoses. Differences in NPS and other symptoms, as well 
as the use of medication, were explored.
RESULTS: Eighty-four percent of NH patients had dementia, and 5.5% had comorbid 
dementia and cancer. Patients with comorbid dementia and cancer received 
significantly more analgesics compared with patients without cancer but with 
dementia (P < .05). Compared with patients without dementia but with cancer, 
patients with comorbid dementia and cancer had significantly more NPS, including 
sleep disturbances and agitation.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with comorbid dementia and cancer receive more analgesics 
than patients with dementia but still display more agitation and sleep 
disturbances than patients with cancer and patients with neither dementia nor 
cancer, suggesting that symptoms may not be treated adequately.
IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The results indicate a considerable strain for 
patients with comorbid dementia and cancer and highlight essential challenges 
for the clinician who is responsible for treatment and care. Nurses should pay 
attention to agitation and sleep disturbances among patients with comorbid 
dementia and cancer.
