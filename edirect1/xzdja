(ED) pathology is well-established in general female samples, less is known 
about contextual body image (CBI) among female athletes. CBI refers to female 
athletes' body image concerns in two contexts: sport and daily life. The 
Contextual Body Image Questionnaire for Athletes (CBIQA) measures four 
dimensions of body image (Appearance, Thin-Fat Self-Evaluation, Thin-Fat Others' 
Evaluation, and Muscularity) in both contexts. In a sample of female collegiate 
athletes, this study sought to A) investigate the psychometric properties of the 
CBIQA, B) examine the cross-sectional relation of CBI with ED pathology and 
negative affect, and C) assess the degree to which CBI prospectively predicts ED 
pathology and negative affect.
METHOD: Using self-report data collected from a multi-site parent trial, we 
examined the psychometric properties of the CBIQA by confirmatory factor 
analysis. We assessed construct and criterion validity via cross-sectional 
bivariate correlation analyses with thin-ideal internalization, negative affect, 
and ED pathology. Using data from Time 1 and 6 months later (Time 2), we 
investigated the degree to which CBI prospectively predicted ED pathology and 
negative affect.
RESULTS: Results from the CFA largely confirmed de Bruin et al.'s (2011) 
original factor analysis. Two CBIQA dimensions (Thin-Fat Self and Appearance) in 
both contexts correlated with ED pathology and negative affect. Thin-Fat Others 
also correlated with ED pathology in both contexts and negative affect in the 
sport context. The Muscularity dimension was predominantly orthogonal with other 
measures. CBIQA dimensions were uncorrelated with thin-ideal internalization. 
When controlling for BMI and Time 1 scores, daily life and sport appearance 
concerns predicted ED pathology, whereas perceived evaluation of thin-fat by 
others in the sport context predicted negative affect 6 months later.
CONCLUSIONS: Results support the psychometric validity of the CBIQA and suggest 
that it captures variance discrete from thin-ideal internalization. The 
Muscularity dimension largely was not related to other outcomes. Further, 
specific elements of perceived self- and other-evaluation in both contexts is 
relevant to risk for ED pathology and negative affect. Future research could 
examine the impact of dual body image between sports seasons and after 
transitioning out of sport.
CLINICAL TRIALS REGISTRATION: NCT01735994 .

Publisher: Female athletes evaluate their bodies in two separate contexts, based 
on their identities in their sport and daily life: this is called contextual 
body image (CBI). The Contextual Body Image Questionnaire for Athletes (CBIQA) 
measures four specific elements of CBI among athletes. This study found that the 
CBIQA measures its intended four elements of CBI, and that it measures an aspect 
of body image that is different from traditional thin-ideal internalization. 
Except for evaluation of Muscularity, the elements of CBI were also related to 
eating disorder measures. Lastly, taking into account earlier scores on the two 
outcomes (eating disorder behaviors and negative mood), appearance concerns in 
both daily life and sport predicted eating disorder symptoms 6 months later. 
Only perceived evaluation of being fat in sport predicted negative mood 6 months 
later. Our findings suggest that the CBIQA is measuring body image elements that 
are unique from other types of body image measures, but are still related to 
eating disorder symptoms, among female competitive athletes. More research is 
needed to better understand how athletes are affected by body image concerns in 
both contexts of their identity.

The main findings of this study on the self-care behaviors contain 
"identification of knowledge gaps," "established networking for seeking 
information," "information from trust-to-distrust," "information-seeking 
inhibiting factors," "information-seeking facilitating factors," and "self-care 
behaviors based on required knowledge."
PURPOSE: Health information-seeking behavior affects self-care and could promote 
quality of life and life expectancy. This study aimed at assessing health 
information-seeking and self-care behaviors of women with osteoporosis in Iran.
METHODS: This study was conducted using a content analysis approach. Data were 
collected through semi-structured interviews with 15 women with osteoporosis 
aged above 50 years. The participants were selected by purposeful sampling. The 
data were analyzed by the conventional content analysis method using MAXQdata 
software version 10.
RESULTS: From in-depth descriptions of the participants' experiences, 246 
primary codes were extracted. Subsequently, constant comparison analysis was 
done and 35 sub-categories and 6 main categories have appeared from the data.
DISCUSSION: Based on the experiences of women with osteoporosis, they received 
limited information from the health care providers, so they were seeking 
reliable information sources to meet their information needs. They obtained most 
of their information from other patients, family members, and network of 
friends. In the process of seeking information, they face various barriers such 
as lack of time in the health care team that affect their ability to self-care.
CONCLUSION: The results can guide health policymakers, patient educators, health 
care providers, information specialists, and patients and their families.

Background Intensive systolic blood pressure treatment (<120 mm Hg) in SPRINT 
(Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial) improved survival compared with 
standard treatment (<140 mm Hg) over a median follow-up of 3.3 years. We 
projected life expectancy after observed follow-up in SPRINT using 
SPRINT-eligible participants in the NHLBI-PCS (National Heart, Lung, and Blood 
Institute Pooled Cohorts Study). Methods and Results We used propensity scores 
to weight SPRINT-eligible NHLBI-PCS participants to resemble SPRINT 
participants. In SPRINT participants, we estimated in-trial survival (<4 years) 
using a time-based flexible parametric survival model. In SPRINT-eligible 
NHLBI-PCS participants, we estimated posttrial survival (≥4 years) using an 
age-based flexible parametric survival model and applied the formula to SPRINT 
participants to predict posttrial survival. We projected overall life expectancy 
for each SPRINT participant and compared it to parametric regression (eg, 
Gompertz) projections based on SPRINT data alone. We included 8584 SPRINT and 
10 593 SPRINT-eligible NHLBI-PCS participants. After propensity weighting, mean 
(SD) age was 67.9 (9.4) and 68.2 (8.8) years, and 35.5% and 37.6% were women in 
SPRINT and NHLBI-PCS, respectively. Using the NHLBI-PCS-based method, projected 
mean life expectancy from randomization was 21.0 (7.4) years with intensive and 
19.1 (7.2) years with standard treatment. Using the Gompertz regression, life 
expectancy was 11.2 (2.3) years with intensive and 10.5 (2.2) years with 
standard treatment. Conclusions Combining SPRINT and NHLBI-PCS observed data 
likely offers a more realistic estimate of life expectancy than parametrically 
extrapolating SPRINT data alone. These results offer insight into the potential 
long-term effectiveness of intensive SBP goals.

AIMS: Anxiety disorders are widespread across the world. A systematic 
understanding of the disease burden, temporal trend and risk factors of anxiety 
disorders provides the essential foundation for targeted public policies on 
mental health at the national, regional, and global levels.
METHODS: The estimation of anxiety disorders in the Global Burden of Disease 
Study 2019 using systematic review was conducted to describe incidence, 
prevalence and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) in 204 countries and 
regions from 1990 to 2019. We calculated the estimated annual percentage change 
(EAPC) to quantify the temporal trends in anxiety disorders burden by sex, 
region and age over the past 30 years and analysed the impact of epidemiological 
and demographic changes on anxiety disorders.
RESULTS: Globally, 45.82 [95% uncertainty interval (UI): 37.14, 55.62] million 
incident cases of anxiety disorders, 301.39 million (95% UI: 252.63, 356.00) 
prevalent cases and 28.68 (95% UI: 19.86, 39.32) million DALYs were estimated in 
2019. Although the overall age-standardised burden rate of anxiety disorders 
remained stable over the past three decades, the latest absolute number of 
anxiety disorders increased by 50% from 1990. We observed huge disparities in 
both age-standardised burden rate and changing trend of anxiety disorders in 
sex, country and age. In 2019, 7.07% of the global DALYs due to anxiety 
disorders were attributable to bullying victimisation, mainly among the 
population aged 5-39 years, and the proportion increased in almost all countries 
and territories compared with 1990.
CONCLUSION: Anxiety disorder is still the most common mental illness in the 
world and has a striking impact on the global burden of disease. Controlling 
potential risk factors, such as bullying, establishing effective mental health 
knowledge dissemination and diversifying intervention strategies adapted to 
specific characteristics will reduce the burden of anxiety disorders.

BACKGROUND: Reports suggest that preoperative optimization of a patient's 
serious comorbidities is associated with a reduction in postoperative 
complications.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to assess the cost and benefits of 
preoperative optimization, accounting for total costs associated with 
postoperative morbidity.
DESIGN: This study is a decision tree cost-effectiveness analysis with 
probabilistic sensitivity analysis (10,000 iterations).
SETTING: This is a hypothetical scenario of stage II colon cancer surgery.
PATIENT: The simulated 65-year-old patient has left-sided, stage II colon 
cancer.
INTERVENTION: Focused preoperative optimization targets high-risk comorbidities.
OUTCOMES: Total discounted (3%) economic costs (US $2018), effectiveness 
(quality-adjusted life-years), incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio, cost/quality-adjusted life-years gained), and net 
monetary benefit.
RESULTS: We calculated the per individual expected health care sector total cost 
of preoperative optimization and sequelae to be $12,395 versus $15,638 in those 
not optimized (net monetary benefit: $1.04 million versus $1.05 million). A 
nonoptimized patient attained an average 0.02 quality-adjusted life-years less 
than one optimized. Thus, preoperative optimization was the dominant strategy 
(lower total costs; higher quality-adjusted life-years). Probabilistic 
sensitivity analysis demonstrated 100% of simulations favoring preoperative 
optimization. The breakeven cost of optimization to remain cost-effective was 
$6421 per patient.
LIMITATIONS: Generalizability must account for the lack of standardization among 
existing preoperative optimization efforts, and decision analysis methodology 
provides guidance for the average patient or general population, and is not 
patient-specific.
CONCLUSIONS: Although currently not comprehensively reimbursed, focused 
preoperative optimization may reduce total costs of care while also reducing 
complications from colon cancer surgery. See Video Abstract at

$ 1.05 millones, respectivamente). Un paciente no optimizado alcanzó un promedio 
de 0.02 AVAC menos que uno optimizado. Por lo tanto, la optimización 
preoperatoria fue la estrategia dominante (menores costos totales; mayores 
AVAC). El análisis de sensibilidad probabilístico demostró que el 100% de las 
simulaciones favorecían la optimización preoperatoria. El costo de equilibrio de 
la optimización para seguir siendo rentable fue de $ 6,421 por 
paciente.LIMITACIONES:La generalización debe tener en cuenta la falta de

OBJECTIVES: In most countries, life expectancy at birth (e0) has improved for 
many decades. Recently, however, progress has stalled in the UK and Canada, and 
reversed in the USA. Lifespan variation, a complementary measure of mortality, 
increased a few years before the reversal in the USA. To assess whether this 
measure offers additional meaningful insights, we examine what happened in four 
other high-income countries with differing life expectancy trends.
DESIGN: We calculated life disparity (a specific measure of lifespan variation) 
in five countries -- USA, UK, France, Japan and Canada -- using sex- and age 
specific mortality rates from the Human Mortality Database from 1975 to 2017 for 
ages 0--100 years. We then examined trends in age-specific mortality to identify 
the age groups contributing to these changes.
SETTING: USA, UK, France, Japan and Canada.
PARTICIPANTS: aggregate population data of the above nations.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Life expectancy at birth, life disparity and age-specific 
mortality.
RESULTS: The stalls and falls in life expectancy, for both males and females, 
seen in the UK, USA and Canada coincided with rising life disparity. These 
changes may be driven by worsening mortality in middle-age (such as at age 40). 
France and Japan, in contrast, continue on previous trajectories.
CONCLUSIONS: Life disparity is an additional summary measure of population 
health providing information beyond that signalled by life expectancy at birth 
alone.

PRECIS: The FP8 glaucoma valve was demonstrated to be reasonably safe with 
reliable results in an advanced age patient population.
PURPOSE: As life expectancy increases, a growing number of patients with 
glaucoma are of an advanced age. There are little to no data looking at glaucoma 
surgical treatment options in patients over the age of 85. Our study describes 
the safety and efficacy of the FP8 Ahmed glaucoma valve in this patient 
population.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective study of patients over 85 years 
of age undergoing FP8 Ahmed glaucoma valve implantation. Preoperative age, sex, 
intraocular pressure (IOP), and number of glaucoma medications were recorded. 
Primary outcome variables were IOP and number of medications. Secondary outcome 
variables included any intraoperative or postoperative complications.
RESULTS: Mean IOP preoperatively was 26 mm Hg on an average of 3 glaucoma 
medications (n=56). IOP was significantly reduced at all time points in 
follow-up for an overall reduction of 42% at 1 year and 46% at 2 years. Mean IOP 
at 1 year follow-up was 15 mm Hg and 14 mm Hg at 2 years follow-up. Glaucoma 
medications were reduced from a mean of 3 preoperatively to 2 postoperatively.
CONCLUSIONS: Implantation of an FP8 Ahmed glaucoma valve is a relatively safe 
procedure to achieve satisfactory IOP and decreased reliance on glaucoma 
medications in an advanced age population.

IMPORTANCE: Nivolumab and pembrolizumab are approved for treating 
platinum-refractory recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell 
carcinoma (R/M HNSCC). Physicians and patients are uncertain which drug is 
preferable, rendering a cost-effectiveness comparison between them necessary.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of nivolumab vs pembrolizumab in 
treating platinum-refractory R/M HNSCC.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Both the network meta-analysis and 
cost-effectiveness analysis included patients from the CheckMate 141 and the 
KEYNOTE 040 phase 3 randomized clinical trials. The Checkmate 141 trial started 
on May 1, 2014, with the present analysis based on a September 2017 data cutoff. 
The KEYNOTE 040 trial started on November 17, 2014, with the present analysis 
based on a May 15, 2017, data cutoff. A bayesian network meta-analysis that 
included 856 patients was carried out, and a cost-effectiveness analysis that 
included 487 patients was conducted by developing a partitioned survival model, 
both between February and November 2020. The robustness of the model was 
assessed via 1-way, 2-way, and probabilistic sensitivity analyses; subgroup 
analyses were included; and scenario analyses were conducted to investigate the 
associations of dosage adjustment of nivolumab with cost-effectiveness.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Life-years, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), 
overall costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were measured.
RESULTS: In the cost-effectiveness analysis that included 487 patients, for US 
health care payers, when nivolumab was administered based on patient weight (3 
mg/kg biweekly), at a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of $100 000 per QALY, 
the probability of nivolumab being cost-effective compared with pembrolizumab 
was 56%; at a WTP threshold of $150 000 per QALY, the probability was 62%. When 
nivolumab was administered at a fixed dose of 240 mg biweekly or 480 mg monthly, 
at a WTP threshold of $100 000 per QALY, the probability of nivolumab being 
cost-effective was 42% to 45%; at a WTP threshold of $150 000 per QALY, the 
probability was 52% to 55%.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Findings from this network meta-analysis and 
cost-effectiveness analysis suggest considering both WTP threshold and patient 
body weight when choosing between nivolumab and pembrolizumab for the treatment 
of patients with platinum-refractory R/M HNSCC. When the WTP threshold was 
$100 000 per QALY, for patients weighing less than 72 kg, nivolumab (3 mg/kg, 
biweekly) was considered cost-effective; otherwise, pembrolizumab was 
preferable. When the WTP threshold was $150 000 per QALY, nivolumab (3 mg/kg 
biweekly) was considered cost-effective for patients weighing less than 75 kg; 
otherwise, fixed-dose nivolumab (240 mg biweekly or 480 mg monthly) provided 
more cost savings.

Multidisciplinary Perspectives.

Older adults comprise a considerable proportion of patients with cancer in the 
world. Across multiple cancer types, cancer treatment outcomes among older age 
groups are often inferior to those among younger adults. Cancer care for older 
individuals is complicated by the need to adapt treatment to baseline health, 
fitness, and frailty, all of which vary widely within this age group. Rates of 
social deprivation and socioeconomic disparities are also higher in older 
adults, with many living on reduced incomes, further compounding health 
inequality. It is important to recognize and avoid undertreatment and 
overtreatment of cancer in this age group; however, simply addressing this 
problem by mandating standard treatment of all would lead to harms resulting 
from treatment toxicity and futility. However, there is little high-quality 
evidence on which to base these decisions, because older adults are poorly 
represented in clinical trials. Clinicians must recognize that simple 
extrapolation of outcomes from younger age cohorts may not be appropriate 
because of variance in disease stage and biology, variation in fitness and 
treatment tolerance, and reduced life expectancy. Older patients may also have 
different life goals and priorities, with a greater focus on quality of life and 
less on length of life at any cost. Health care professionals struggle with 
treatment of older adults with cancer, with high rates of variability in 
practice between and within countries. This suggests that better national and 
international recommendations that more fully address the needs of this special 
patient population are required and that primary research focused on the older 
age group is urgently required to inform these guidelines.

    Clin Infect Dis. 2021 May 17;:

Recent randomized trials suggest that interleukin-6 inhibitors reduce mortality 
due to severe coronavirus disease 2019. Using a decision tree model, we found 
that tocilizumab is cost-effective with an estimated incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio of $16 520 per quality-adjusted life year gained (95% 
credible interval, 10 760-51 530).

BACKGROUND: An estimated 862 000 to 2.4 million people have chronic hepatitis B 
infection (CHB). Hepatitis B screening is recommended for pregnant women and 
populations with increased CHB risk. However, diagnosis rates remain low, with 
only 33% of people with CHB aware of their infection. This study aimed to assess 
the cost-effectiveness of universal adult screening for CHB.
METHODS: We used a Markov model to calculate the costs, population health 
impact, and cost-effectiveness of 1-time universal screening and CHB monitoring 
and treatment compared with current practice. Sensitivity analysis was performed 
on model parameters to identify thresholds for cost-saving or cost-effectiveness 
based on a willingness to pay of $50 000/quality-adjusted life-year. The 
analysis assumed testing would be performed during routine healthcare visits and 
that generic tenofovir or entecavir would be dispensed for treatment. Testing 
costs were based on Medicare reimbursement rates.
RESULTS: At an estimated 0.24% prevalence of undiagnosed CHB, universal 
hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) screening in adults aged 18-69 years is 
cost-saving compared with current practice if antiviral treatment drug costs 
remain below $894/year. Compared with current practice, universal screening 
would avert an additional 7.4 cases of compensated cirrhosis, 3.3 cases of 
decompensated cirrhosis, 5.5 cases of hepatocellular carcinoma, 1.9 liver 
transplants, and 10.3 hepatitis B virus-related deaths at a saving of $263 
000/100 000 adults screened.
CONCLUSIONS: Universal HBsAg screening of adults in the US general population 
for CHB is cost-effective and likely cost-saving compared with current CHB 
screening recommendations.

BACKGROUND: Knowing which diseases and causes of death account for most of the 
years of life lost (YLL) can help to better target appropriate prevention and 
intervention measures. The YLL in Germany for specific causes of death were 
estimated as part of the BURDEN 2020 project at the Robert Koch Institute.
METHODS: Data from cause-of-death statistics were used for the analysis. ICD 
codes were grouped into causes of death categories at different levels of 
disaggregation. The YLL were estimated by combining each cause of death with the 
remaining life expectancy at the age of death. Deaths and YLL were compared by 
sex, age category, and regional distribution.
RESULTS: Approximately 11.6 million years were estimated to be lost in Germany 
in 2017, of which 42.8% were lost by women and 57.2% by men. The largest number 
of YLL were due to (malignant) neoplasms (35.2%), followed by cardiovascular 
diseases (27.6%), gastrointestinal diseases (5.8%), and neurological diseases 
(5.7%). Deaths at younger ages had a greater impact on population health if 
expressed in YLL: the death share of persons under age 65 was 14.7%, but the 
years of life lost in this age group amounted to 38.3% of all YLL. The most 
common causes of death in this group include accidents, self-injury and 
violence, malignant neoplasms, and alcohol-related diseases.
CONCLUSION: A large proportion of YLL is borne by young and middle-aged persons. 
These findings emphasize the need to introduce preventive strategies early in 
life to reduce the YLL at younger ages, as well as to prevent risk factors for 
diseases in older ages.

BACKGROUND: The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic presented major challenges to the health 
sector in 2020. The burden of disease arising from COVID-19 can be expressed as 
the number of years of life lost to disease or death. For example, death at age 
40 involves a loss of far more years of life than death at age 80.
METHODS: The disability-adjusted life years (DALY) lost to COVID-19 were 
calculated as the sum of the years of life lost through death (YLL) and the 
number of years lived with disability (YLD), on the basis of 
laboratory-confirmed notifiable cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Germany in 2020 
(documented as of 18 January 2021). The methodology was based on that used in 
the Global Burden of Disease Study. Pre-existing diseases do not enter into the 
determination of YLL; rather, the residual life expectancy that is applied in 
this calculation corresponds to a mean age-specific level of morbidity.
RESULTS: 305 641 years of life were lost to COVID-19 in Germany in 2020. The 
percentage of DALY lost by persons under 70 was 34.8% in men and 21.0% in women. 
99.3% of the COVID-19 disease burden was accounted for by death (YLL). The daily 
average years of life lost due to death was lower for COVID-19 than for the 
major non-communicable diseases. Persons who died of COVID-19 lost a mean of 9.6 
years of life; those who were under 70 when they died lost a mean of 25.2 years 
of life. Men lost more years of life than women (11.0 vs. 8.1 years).
CONCLUSION: The effects of COVID-19 on public health can be expressed through 
the burden of disease indicators. This method yields additional information that 
should be put to use early in the course of future outbreaks.

INTRODUCTION: Upsurge in life expectancy, filial responsibility of caring, and 
healthcare advances have increased the older adult population in Asia. The last 
decade has witnessed nuclear families' proliferation in Asia, leaving family 
caregivers with more accountability and responsibility. This review explores the 
pattern of caregiver burden among caregivers of older adults with chronic 
illness in Asia.
METHODS: PRISMA guidelines serves as the framework for this systematic review. 
Studies from selected databases assessed caregivers' physical state, 
psychological dysfunction, and or burden as an outcome measure. The Newcastle - 
Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale appraised the quality of the selected studies.
RESULTS: The review included 12 research articles. Caregivers consistently 
report mild to a moderate burden. Care recipient with functional dependency, 
comorbidities, memory, and sleep impairments, escalate caregiver burden. 
Caregiver variables intensifying burden were advancing age, male gender, spouse 
as a care recipient, longer care provision duration, and no assistance.
CONCLUSION: Optimal levels of emotional well-being, significant family/social 
support, and self-preparedness among caregivers are grounds for their 
empowerment.
PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: A paradigm shift from 'caregiver burden' to 'caregiver 
resilience' is advocated. Routine screening, preventive measures (skill-building 
and psychosocial empowerment), and restorative services (respite care and 
problem-based home visiting) for caregivers are forecasted.

BACKGROUND: Two previous phase 3, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled 
trials showed that duloxetine 60 mg/day for 14 weeks significantly improved pain 
and quality of life in Japanese patients with knee osteoarthritis or chronic low 
back pain. In their open-label extension studies, these improvements were 
maintained for ≥48 weeks. This post-hoc analysis assessed the relationship 
between initial response to duloxetine and long-term pain reduction and quality 
of life in patients with knee osteoarthritis or chronic low back pain.
METHODS: Patients (knee osteoarthritis: N = 43; chronic low back pain: N = 41) 
were subdivided based on extent of pain reduction from baseline to Week 4 of 
duloxetine (≥30%, 10-30%, or <10% reduction in Brief Pain Inventory-Severity 
average pain score). Outcome measures were changes from baseline for Brief Pain 
Inventory-Severity and Brief Pain Inventory-Interference at regular intervals up 
to Week 65.
RESULTS: Mean change from baseline in Brief Pain Inventory-Severity was greater 
in patients with ≥30% early pain reduction than in patients with <10% early pain 
reduction through Week 27 for both conditions, and also Weeks 47-65 for back 
pain. Compared with the <10% early pain reduction group, mean change from 
baseline in the average of seven Brief Pain Inventory-Interference domain scores 
was greater in the ≥30% or 10-30% early pain reduction groups for knee 
osteoarthritis (except Weeks 63-65), and in the ≥30% early pain reduction group 
for chronic low back pain through Week 19.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that patients with knee osteoarthritis who 
respond well to duloxetine in the first month might experience sustained, 
long-term pain relief with generally greater quality-of-life improvement than 
patients with poor initial response. Patients with chronic low back pain who had 
strong initial response may experience a greater long-term pain relief, but not 
greater quality-of-life improvement, than patients with poor initial response.

OBJECTIVES: To compare the benefits of a tight-control/treat-to-target strategy 
(TC/T2T) in axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) with those of usual care (UC).
METHODS: Pragmatic, prospective, cluster-randomised, controlled, open, 1-year 
trial (NCT03043846). 18 centres were randomised (1:1). Patients met Axial 
Spondylo Arthritis International Society (ASAS) criteria for axSpA, had an 
Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score (ASDAS) ≥2.1, received non-optimal 
treatment by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and were biologic-naive.
INTERVENTIONS: (1) TC/T2T: visits every 4 weeks and prespecified strategy based 
on treatment intensification until achieving target (ie, ASDAS <2.1); (2) UC: 
visits every 12 weeks and treatment at the rheumatologist's discretion.
MAIN OUTCOME: Percentage of patients with a ≥30% improvement on the ASAS-Health 
Index (ASAS-HI). Other efficacy outcomes and adverse events were recorded. A 
health economic evaluation was performed.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Two-level mixed models were used to estimate efficacy 
outcomes. Cost-effectiveness was assessed by the incremental cost per 
quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained for TC/T2T versus UC.
RESULTS: 160 patients were included (80/group). Mean (SD) age was 37.9 (11.0) 
years and disease duration was 3.7 (6.2) years; 51.2% were men. ASDAS at 
inclusion was 3.0 (0.7), and ASAS-HI was 8.6 (3.7). ASAS-HI improved by ≥30% in 
47.3% of the TC/T2T arm and in 36.1% of those receiving UC (non-significant). 
All secondary efficacy outcomes were more frequent in the TC/T2T arm, although 
not all statistically significant. Safety was similar in both arms. From a 
societal perspective, TC/T2T resulted in an additional 0.04 QALY, and saved €472 
compared with UC.
CONCLUSION: TC/T2T was not significantly superior to UC for the primary outcome, 
while many secondary efficacy outcomes favoured it, had a similar safety profile 
and was favourable from a societal health economic perspective.

The importance of the COVID-19 pandemic requires us to break down the walls 
between medical specialties to optimise the management of patients with 
post-acute COVID-19 syndrome https://bit.ly/3gzqEik

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has provoked an 
ongoing global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which has 
affected 130 million people worldwide and caused nearly 3 million deaths in just 
over 1 year [1]. In 2020, COVID-19 represented the third highest cause of death 
in the USA after heart disease and cancer [2], and this outbreak has led to the 
largest drop in life expectancy since World War II [2]. Evidence-based medical 
treatment of COVID-19 (anticoagulants, corticosteroids, anti-inflammatory drugs, 
oxygenation therapy and ventilation) [3] seems to have improved patients’ 
outcomes, and the vast majority will recover spontaneously or after acute phase 
management.
